abstract={Since 2005, two cases of natural bovine spongiform encephalopathies (BSE) have been reported in goats. Furthermore, experimental transmissions of classical (C-BSE) and atypical (L-BSE) forms of BSE in goats were also reported. To minimize further spreading of prion diseases in small ruminants the development of a highly sensitive and specific test for ante-mortem detection of infected animals would be of great value. Recent studies reported high diagnostic value of a second generation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Real-Time Quaking-Induced Conversion (RT-QuIC) assay across a wide spectrum of human prions. Here, we applied this improved QuIC (IQ-CSF) for highly efficient detection of TSEs prion protein in goat cerebrospinal fluid. IQ-CSF sensitivity and specificity were evaluated on CSF samples collected at disease endpoint from goats naturally and experimentally infected with scrapie or bovine isolates of C-BSE and L-BSE, respectively. Next, CSF samples collected from L-BSE infected goats during pre-symptomatic stage were also analysed. PrP L-BSE associated seeding activity was detected at early time points after experimental inoculation, with an average time of 439 days before clinical symptoms appeared. Taken together these data are indicative of the great potential of this in vitro prion amplification assay as ante-mortem TSE test for live and asymptomatic small ruminants. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={Orthobunyaviruses (OBVs) form a distinct genus of arthropod-borne bunyaviruses that can cause severe disease upon zoonotic transmission to humans. Antigenic drift or genome segment re-assortment have in the past resulted in new pathogenic OBVs, making them potential candidates for causing emerging zoonoses in the future. Low-resolution electron cryo-tomography studies have shown that OBV particles feature prominent trimeric spikes, but their molecular organization remained unknown. Here we report X-ray crystallography studies of four different OBVs showing that the spikes are formed by an N-terminal extension of the fusion glycoprotein Gc. Using Schmallenberg virus, a recently emerged OBV, we also show that the projecting spike is the major target of the neutralizing antibody response, and provide X-ray structures in complex with two protecting antibodies. We further show that immunization of mice with the spike domains elicits virtually sterilizing immunity, providing fundamental knowledge essential in the preparation for potential newly emerging OBV zoonoses. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is one of the most important causes of mastitis in dairy cattle. Control and eradication programs of S. aureus intra-mammary infections (IMI) are based on different factors included the correct detection and management of the infected cows. The present study aimed at evaluating the efficacy of composite milk samples (CMS) analysis, compared to quarter milk samples (QMS) analysis, for the bacteriological detection of S. aureus intra-mammary infections. During 2016, 661 CMS (hygienically collected) and 2644 QMS (aseptically collected) were obtained from 661 cows in 5 herds. All the samples were submitted to S. aureus bacteriological culture and somatic cell count (SCC) analysis. QMS bacteriological analysis on blood agar plates was able to detect 236 cows excreting S. aureus, while the bacteriological analysis of CMS, using selective agar, identified 229 positive cows. The concordance was 95% with an excellent Cohen's κ (0.89). Relative sensitivity and specificity of CMS vs QMS, considered as the reference test, were 91.5% ± 2.1 and 96.9% ± 1.3 (CI 95%), respectively. In addition, the relative sensitivity of CMS improved as the number of infected quarters per cow and the number of colony forming units (cfu) per sample increased. The predictive value of CMS results was better when paired with SCC data, in particular CMS showed better negative predictive value when SCC was <200,000 cells/mL and better positive predictive value when SCC was>200,000 cells/mL. The probability for a cow to be S. aureus positive was 56.4% in case of SCC > 200,000 cells/mL, while it was 18.6% in case of SCC < 200,000 cells/mL. The average SCC in CMS was significantly higher in positive cows and the value rose as the number of infected quarters per cow increased. Given the intermittent excretion of S. aureus in milk from dairy cows, it could be more advantageous to carry out several serial CMS, rather than few QMS, being CMS an easier to collect and less expensive milk sampling method. Thus, bacteriological examination of CMS, combined with SCC data of the same sample, could be extremely useful for the success of S. aureus IMI control plans, because repeated CMS are easier to be performed and could be more easily proposed to the farmers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The Chlamydiaceae are Gram-negative bacteria causing diseases in humans and in both, endothermic (mammals and birds) and poikilothermic (e.g. reptiles, amphibians) animals. As most chlamydial species described today were isolated from humans and endothermic animals, the commonly used culturing temperature in vitro is 37 °C, although the centrifugation temperature during experimental infection, a technique necessary to improve the infection rate, may vary from 25 to 37 °C. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of different centrifugation (28° or 33 °C) and incubation temperatures (28 °C or 37 °C) on the average inclusion size, infectivity and ultrastructural morphology of human and animal chlamydial strains, as well as two recently described species originating from snakes, C. poikilothermis and C. serpentis, in LLC-MK2 cells at 48 h post infection. Infectivity and average inclusion size was reduced at an incubation temperature of 28 °C compared to 37 °C for all strains including C. poikilothermis, although the latter formed larger, fully matured inclusions at 28 °C in comparison to the other investigated Chlamydia species. C.psittaci displayed a shorter developmental cycle than the other species confirming previous studies. Higher centrifugation temperature increased the subsequent inclusion size of C. trachomatis, C. abortus and C. suis but not their infectivity, while the incubation temperature had no discernable effect on the morphology, inclusion size and infectivity of the other chlamydial strains. In conclusion, we found that all Chlamydia species are viable and can grow at low incubation temperatures, although all strains grew better and more rapidly at 37 °C compared to 28 °C. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Mycobacterium bovis is known to have a wide host range and has been isolated from numerous free-ranging wildlife species, carnivores included. In bears, M. bovis has been previously reported only from a culture of pooled lymph nodes of a black bear (Ursus americanus) in the absence of lesions. The aims of this study were to describe gross and microscopic pathological findings of M. bovis tuberculosis in a deceased Marsican brown bear (Ursus arctos marsicanus). Case presentation: In March 2014, an adult female Marsican brown bear was found in the Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise National Park (Italy) showing severe non-specific clinical signs. The animal died soon after its discovery and the carcass was submitted to post-mortem examination to identify the cause of death. The bear was diagnosed with a severe Mycobacterium bovis infection, with both pathological and microbiological aspects suggesting ongoing generalization. A presumptive diagnosis of mycobacterial infection was initially made based on gross findings. Histopathology showed the presence of acid-fast bacilli in all sampled tissues along with poorly organized granulomatous lesions. Slow-growing Mycobacterium sp. was isolated from multiple organs (intestine, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, lung and kidneys). The PCR and sequencing algorithm identified the Mycobacterium sp. isolate as M. bovis. Spoligotyping demonstrated that the M. bovis isolate belonged to spoligotype SB0120. Conclusions: This is the first report of lethal M. bovis tuberculosis infection in a free-ranging brown bear. This pathogen could have serious adverse effects in an endangered relic population such as the Marsican brown bear. Stricter application of health regulations in force, surveillance of M. bovis infections in wild ungulates and carnivore scavengers, along with dismissal of supplementary feeding points intended for cattle or wildlife, are warranted to control the presence of bovine tuberculosis in wild and domestic animals in protected areas. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={Monitoring environmental contaminants in edible animal species is important for the assessment of environmental quality and for food safety as well. In this study, the occurrence of 2,3,7,8 dioxins, and furans, dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls, six non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyl indicators (ndl-PCBs), seven polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs), four polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and four metals (As, Hg, Ni, Pb) was evaluated in 90 European eels (Anguilla anguilla) from Lake Garda. The results on eel samples showed a frequent contamination of dl-PCBs, found at concentrations higher than the maximum limit (ML) provided by European Union in 41 % of the eels. Two PBDE congeners (BDE 47 and BDE 99) were detected in almost all the samples. The contamination by PAHs was found negligible; only one sample had a high concentration of benzo[a]pyrene. Concerning metals, Pb showed concentrations higher than the maximum level (ML) in 77% of the samples, while Ni content could be a cause of acute toxicity due to dermatitis. Extreme consumers (95th percentile) are subjected to an actual risk attributable to dioxins, furans, and mainly dl-PCBs and PBDEs. The contamination of Lake Garda eels is therefore a matter of concern and a constant monitoring of the pollution levels of its freshwater is mandatory. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={A total of 172 different salamis were purchased from farms and small salami factories located in four Italian regions (Piedmont, Veneto, Calabria, and Sicily) and analyzed for the presence of ochratoxin A (OTA). Analysis was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a fluorimetric detector (HPLC-FLD). The detection limit (LOD) for the method used was 0.05 μg/kg, while the quantitation limit (LOQ) was 0.20 μg/kg; the average recovery rate was 89.1%. OTA was detected in 22 salamis, and 3 samples exceeded the Italian guidance value for OTA in pork meat (1 μg/kg). In particular, what emerges from this research is the high percentage of spicy salamis among positive samples (68.2%, 15 out of 22), although spicy salamis are only 27.3% of the total number of samples collected and analyzed. Red chili pepper contaminated by OTA could be responsible for the presence of the mycotoxin in these spicy salamis. It follow that, also the control of some ingredients used in the manufacture of these meat products, like spices, should not be neglected. © 2018, Society for Mycotoxin Research and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In view of the large number of soil analyses in environmental studies dealing with metal contamination, the use of simple, fast, sustainable and cost-effective methodologies is desired. In this sense, the role of total reflection X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (TXRF) has to be highlighted due to the possibility of direct analysis of solid suspensions without the need for a digestion process. Internal standardization is successfully used as a quantification approach in multielement TXRF analysis of liquid samples, including soil digests. However, its application for the analysis of soil suspensions is not always possible. In the present manuscript we found that although acceptable results were obtained for TXRF quantification by internal standardization when considering soil certified reference materials (recoveries: 80-120%), a systematic underestimation of the concentration values was found when using the same approach for real soil sample analysis (recoveries <70%). In view of these problems, we explored the possibilities of different quantification approaches, including external calibration, which can be used in combination with soil suspension preparation and TXRF analysis to obtain reliable results for metal determination in soils. Data obtained showed that the best strategy was the use of internal standardization with correction of the TXRF results using a calibration curve obtained in the analysis of a set of soil samples with a matrix similar to the unknown ones by using a reference technique (digestion and ICP-OES analysis). With this analytical approach quantitative results were obtained for all the studied metals with recovery values around 95%. As a study case, the proposed TXRF method has been applied for the specific determination of Pb, Zn and Cd concentrations in soils from an abandoned metal mining area but the developed methodology could be extended to other environmental studies dealing with the determination of other metals and soil types. Taking into account the selectivity and sensitivity limitations when determining high Z elements such as Cd using TXRF systems equipped with Mo X-ray tubes, we compare the analytical performance of TXRF systems with different sources (Mo and W) as well. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Simple Summary: Consumers are currently more sensitive regarding the way animals are kept and handled and, in general, have increased their awareness towards animal welfare. There is a close link between welfare of animals and stakeholders’ perception of their needs. This study aimed at investigating stakeholders’ perception of the welfare of equines, small ruminants, and turkeys using a text mining approach to analyze their answers to open-ended questions. A total of 270 surveys were collected from respondents of 32 different countries. Independently from the species, respondents considered that an animal needs appropriate nutrition to be fit, healthy, and productive. The “environment” was considered particularly important for turkey stakeholders, whereas housing factors were relevant for goat stakeholders. Horse stakeholders also considered “exercise”, “pasture” and “proper training” important. Although the sample was too small to analyze variation in welfare perception among stakeholders of different species, text mining analysis seems to be a promising method to investigate stakeholders’ perception of animal welfare, as it emphasizes their real perception, without the constraints deriving by close-ended questions. Abstract: Welfare of animals significantly depends on how stakeholders perceive their needs and behave in a way to favor production systems that promote better welfare outcomes. This study aimed at investigating stakeholders’ perception of the welfare of equines, small ruminants, and turkeys using text mining analysis. A survey composed by open-ended questions referring to different aspects of animal welfare was carried out. Text mining analysis was performed. A total of 270 surveys were filled out (horses = 122, sheep = 81, goats = 36, turkeys = 18, donkeys = 13). The respondents (41% veterinarians) came from 32 different countries. To describe welfare requirements, the words “feeding” and “water” were the most frequently used in all the species, meaning that respondents considered the welfare principle “good feeding” as the most relevant. The word “environment” was considered particularly important for turkeys, as well as the word “dry”, never mentioned for other species. Horses stakeholders also considered “exercise” and “proper training” important. Goat stakeholders’ concerns are often expressed by the word “space”, probably because goats are often intensively managed in industrialized countries. Although the sample was too small to be representative, text mining analysis seems to be a promising method to investigate stakeholders’ perception of animal welfare, as it emphasizes their real perception, without the constraints deriving by close-ended questions. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={Staphylococcus aureus is able to produce enterotoxins causing staphylococcal food poisoning, and is frequently harboured by dairy products. Also, S. aureus is able to form biofilm in the production environment, enhancing the risk of food contamination. The ability of 49 S. aureus isolates from the dairy production chain to form biofilm aim was tested, and their genetic diversity in terms of population structure and presence of genes involved in biofilm formation or enterotoxins production was explored. The majority of the genotypes found were generally bovine associated; however, some have been also reported frequently in human clinical cases. Two isolates were methicillin-resistant. In total, 38.7% of the isolates were biofilm producers, and among them 47.3%, 42.1% and 10.5% exhibited weak, moderate, or strong biofilm-forming ability, respectively. In total 68% of the biofilm producing isolates were also positive for enterotoxins genes, raising concerns for consumer safety. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a complex zoonosis with domestic and sylvatic life-cycles, involving different intermediate and definitive host species. Many previous studies have highlighted the lack of a surveillance system for CE, its persistence in Italy, and endemicity in several Italian regions. Because of the absence of a uniform surveillance program for both humans and animals, disease occurrence is widely underestimated. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of ovine CE in Italy. Survey data on the prevalence of Echinococcus granulosus complex infections in Italian sheep farms from 2010 to 2015 were obtained in collaboration with Regional Veterinary Epidemiology Observatories (OEVRs). Bayesian analysis was performed to estimate the true CE farm prevalence. The prior true CE prevalence was estimated using data from Sardinia. Second, Bayesian modelling of the observed prevalence in different regions and the true prevalence estimation from the first step were used to ultimately estimate the prevalence of ovine CE in Italy. We obtained survey data from 10 OEVRs, covering 14 Italian regions. We observed that the risk of CE infection decreased over the years, and it was strictly correlated with the density of susceptible species. Using Sardinia as prior distribution, where the disease farm prevalence was approximately 19% (95% CI, 18.82–20.02), we estimated that the highest endemic CE farm prevalence was in Basilicata with a value of 12% (95% BCI: 7.49–18.9%) and in Piemonte 7.64%(95% BCI: 4.12–13.04%). Our results provide spatially relevant data crucial for guiding CE control in Italy. Precise information on disease occurrence location would aid in the identification of priority areas for disease control implementation by the authorities. The current underestimation of CE occurrence should urge the Italian and European governments to become aware of the public health importance of CE and implement targeted interventions for high-risk areas. © 2019 Loi et al.

abstract={Berries have repeatedly been associated with outbreaks of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection. The fruits are usually minimally processed in the food industry due to their delicate nature. While washing treatments partially remove enteric viruses, the commonly used chemical additives produce toxic by-products. A valid alternative to preserve the food safety of these products could be the use of essential oils (EOs). EOs exert antimicrobial activity and do not interfere with the nutritional characteristics of food products. We investigated the efficacy of four essential oils, lemon (Citrus limon), sweet orange (Citrus sinensis), grapefruit (Citrus paradisi), and rosemary cineole (Rosmarinus officinalis chemotype 1.8 cineole) in reducing viral loads of HAV in soft fruits. Mixed fruit berries were inoculated with 10 6.74 TCID 50 /ml of HAV, and treated with four different EOs (0.5% lemon, 0.1% sweet orange and grapefruit, and 0.05% rosemary) for 1 h at room temperature. Virus infectivity was then assessed by titration assays for its ability to grow on cell cultures. A statistically significant reduction in HAV titer on the fruit surface was observed after treating the berries with EOs of lemon (2.84 log TCID 50 /ml), grapefruit (2.89 log TCID 50 /ml), and rosemary cineole (2.94 log TCID 50 /ml). Rosemary cineole was the most effective EO in reducing viral titer on berries, followed by grapefruit EO. These results improve our knowledge about the antiviral activity of these EOs and highlight their potential use in fresh produce sanitation. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Mammalian orthoreoviruses (MRV) type 3 have been recently identified in human and several animal hosts, highlighting the apparent lack of species barriers. Here we report the identification and genetic characterization of MRVs strains in alpine chamois, one of the most abundant wild ungulate in the Alps. Serological survey was also performed by MRV neutralization test in chamois population during five consecutive years (2008-2012). Three novel MRVs were isolated on cell culture from chamois lung tissues. No respiratory or other clinical symptoms neither lung macroscopic lesions were observed in the chamois population. MRV strains were classified as MRV-3 within the lineage III, based on S1 phylogeny, and were closely related to Italian strains identified in dog, bat and diarrheic pig. The full genome sequence was obtained by next-generation sequencing and phylogenetic analyses showed that other segments were more similar to MRVs of different geographic locations, serotypes and hosts, including human, highlighting genome reassortment and lack of host specific barriers. By using serum neutralization test, a high prevalence of MRV-3 antibodies was observed in chamois population throughout the monitored period, showing an endemic level of infection and suggesting a self-maintenance of MRV and/or a continuous spill-over of infection from other animal species. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={West Nile virus (WNV) is an important zoonotic pathogen maintained in a natural transmission cycle between mosquitoes and birds as reservoir hosts. In dead-end hosts, such as humans, infection may result in fatal neurologic disease translating into disease and death-related suffering and increased health care costs. In humans, WNV may also be transmitted through blood transfusions and organ transplants. WNV is not present in Switzerland yet, but competent vector species (especially Culex pipiens and Aedes japonicus) are prevalent and an introduction of the virus, likely through wild birds, is expected at any time. Therefore, it is important for Switzerland to be prepared and establish a surveillance system for WNV to initiate increased prevention activities, such as the screening of blood and organ donations and public education activities in case virus circulation is detected. The long-term goal of these surveillance measures would be a reduced infection rate in humans resulting in less suffering and reduced health care costs. To provide the basis for a pragmatic and resource-effective WNV surveillance program, this study used aliquots of serum samples of free-range laying hens taken at the abattoir and collected in the frame of the ongoing Swiss Avian Influenza and Newcastle Disease monitoring program for a 2-year period. All 961 aliquots were analyzed using a commercial competitive WNV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The study allowed to set up sampling and laboratory routines as a basis for future WNV surveillance activities. At this stage there is no evidence for circulation of WNV in Switzerland. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.},

abstract={Resistance to new generation cephalosporins is an important public health problem globally, in terms of economic and social costs, morbidity and mortality. Βeta-lactamase enzymes are mainly responsible for the antibiotic resistance of Gram negative bacteria and extended-spectrum-β-lactamases (ESβLs) are one of the major determinants of resistance against oxymino-cephalosporins in Enterobacteriaceae. Food-producing animals represent one of the sources of antibiotic resistant bacteria, including pigs. Here we analysed the presence of E. coli resistant to III generation cephalosporins isolated from different matrices collected from intensively bred pigs. A total of 498 E. coli were isolated from faeces and carcasses of pigs at slaughterhouse as well as from pork meat and sausages. Among these, 73 were phenotypically confirmed to be ESβL producers. Genetic analysis revealed that all except two harboured at least one of the three selected genes: blaCTX-M, blaTEM, and blaSHV. Furthermore, six of the E. coli ESβL isolated from faeces and carcasses swabs, were also able to produce biofilm, highlighting the virulence potential of these strains. The presence of Multi-Drug-Resistance patterns (MDR) recorded by the 73 ESβL E. coli was significant (60% of the strains were resistant to more than six antibiotics in MIC test). Results from the present study show that the transmission of resistant bacteria is possible along the food chain, including production of pork, one the most highly consumed meats around the world. Transmission is possible through the ingestion of raw meat products, and following cross-contamination between raw and cooked foods during preparation. The potential risk for human health demonstrated here, associated with the consumption of pork contaminated with bacterial strains characterized by multidrug resistance patterns, and the ability to produce ESβL and biofilm, is cause for concern. It is imperative to study future control strategies to avoid or limit as much as possible the transmission of these highly pathogenic strains through food consumption and/or contact with the environment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Influenza D virus (IDV) was first reported in 2011 in swine in Oklahoma and consequently found in cattle, sheep, and goats across North America and Eurasia. Cattle have been proposed as the natural reservoir. In this study, we developed and validated a MAb-based competitive ELISA for the detection of antibodies against IDV. Thirty-one hybridomas specific to IDV were generated using Balb/C mice immunised with purified IDV/Swine/Italy/199724-3/2015. The specificity of MAbs was determined by comparing their reactivity with the homologous and other influenza A viruses along with additional bovine and swine viruses. A solid-phase competitive ELISA (IDV-cELISA) was set up using the partially purified antigen coated to the plate and incubation of two serum dilutions (1/10 and 1/20) followed by addition of a peroxidase-conjugated MAb as competitor, which had shown wide intratype cross-reactivity and positivity in HI. To evaluate the diagnostic performances of IDV-cELISA, we used 884 sera (414 negative and 470 positive) from different species. ROC analyses were performed to enable the selection of best cut-off value and estimation of diagnostic specificity and sensitivity. The agreement between IDV-cELISA and HI test was assessed by Cohen's kappa value (κ). The κ analysis showed an almost perfect agreement (κ = 0.93; 95%CI −0.899 to 0.961) between HI test and IDV-cELISA. ROC analysis showed that IDV-cELISA was accurate with an area under the curve (AUC) = 0.999, 95% CI 0.993–1.000). A cut-off value of 65% was selected with Se and Sp values of 99.35 (95% CI 98.1–99.9) and 98.75 (95% CI 97.1–99.6). These results proved excellent diagnostic performances of IDV-cELISA, which compared to HI presented major advantages, such as suitability for automation, low dependence on individual skills, spectrophotometric reading, and easy interpretation of the results. This assay can be exploited to detect anti-IDV antibodies in different animal species. © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Following the persistent detection of Listeria monocytogenes in raw bovine milk sold through a vending machine, the 120 lactating cows of the herd producing the milk were subjected to bacteriological investigation. A single cow with subclinical mastitis (1.2–1.3 × 10 5 somatic cells/mL) and persistent L. monocytogenes excretion was detected. The cow was subjected to antimicrobial therapy, but L. monocytogenes excretion remained high (&gt;3.0 × 10 2 cfu/mL). Following culling of the infected cow, L. monocytogenes disappeared from the tank milk, and further isolates were recovered from the mammary parenchyma and lymph nodes of the infected cow. To investigate the clonal nature of the contamination, all isolates recovered in the study (n = 13) were analyzed by serogroup PCR, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and whole-genome sequencing. Our results demonstrated the clonal nature of the contamination. All isolates belonged to lineage II, serogroup IIa, sequence type 37, clonal complex 37 and harbored some virulence determinants. This case showed that, although relatively rare, prolonged milk contamination by L. monocytogenes can originate from subclinical and persistently infected cows, posing a health risk to consumers. © 2019 American Dairy Science Association},

abstract={This study describes the genetic characterization of serotype A viruses collected during outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) that occurred in Algeria in 2017. These are the first reports of clinical cases due to this serotype in the country since 1977. One complete genomic sequence (comprising 8,119 nucleotides) and three additional near-complete genomic sequences were generated. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that these viruses were classified within the A/AFRICA/G-IV lineage, most closely related to viruses circulating in Nigeria between 2009 and 2015. These unexpected results motivate further studies to define the precise pathways by which this viral lineage has been introduced into North Africa in order to understand risks of future disease incursions into the region. © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Paratuberculosis is a chronic enteric infection, caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), affecting virtually all ruminants as well as other animals. MAP is also suspected to be involved in the etiology of some human diseases, like Crohn's disease and others. In surveillance studies, different analytical methodologies were employed to detect MAP, showing different results and incidence in dairy products. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance characteristics of three analytical methods [culture, quantitative PCR (qPCR) and peptide-mediated magnetic separation (PMS) phage-based assay] for MAP detection in raw, heat-treated and powdered milk. The methods were evaluated according to performance characteristics defined for qualitative methods in ISO 16140-2:2016. To estimate sensitivity (including trueness) and LOD, 720, and 900 test portions, respectively, were blind tested by two laboratories. Considering all matrices, different sensitivities, expressed as the percentage of positives from the total of true positive test portions, were obtained for IS900 qPCR (94%), f57 qPCR (76%), culture (83%), and PMS-phage (40%). Trueness, expressed as results correctly assigned (including positive and negative) to the reference value, was 93% for the IS900 qPCR method, 89% for culture and 49% for the PMS-phage. The LODs obtained in this study were similar to the LODs previously published for cultural and qPCR methods. However, for the PMS-phage method, the obtained results showed higher LOD values compared to the limited data available in the scientific literature. Our results highlight that while the PMS-phage assay is workable in pure liquid culture for estimation of MAP counts, its usage for surveillance of dairy matrices should be treated with a lot of caution as performance characteristics obtained were lower than for the two other methods tested. qPCR and culture are the most appropriate methods to detect MAP in milk-based matrices according to ISO 16140 methodology. Cultural techniques are considered the gold standard for detection of viable MAP, but qPCR, which is widely used in analytical and surveillance studies, can be considered a suitable and recommendable alternative to cultural methods for screening, if confirmation of MAP's viability is not requested. © 2019 Butot, Ricchi, Sevilla, Michot, Molina, Tello, Russo, Arrigoni, Garrido and Tomas.},

abstract={Swine influenza viruses (SIVs) have been repeatedly demonstrated to circulate in wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations, whereas no evidence of exposure to avian influenza viruses (AIVs) has been described in wild boar. To better understand how different environments may influence the ecology of influenza A viruses (IAVs) in wild suid populations, we examined biologic samples of wild boars from two study areas represented by an upland (UL) and a wetland (WL) in northern and central Italy, respectively. Serum samples were collected from 388 wild boars sampled in the UL, whereas both a serum sample and a nasal swab were obtained from each of 35 wild boars sampled in the WL. Twenty of 388 (5.2%) sera from the UL were positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the presence of antibodies against influenza A nucleoprotein and some of these samples showed antibodies by hemagglutination inhibition to SIVs of H1N1 (1/20), H1N2 (10/20), and H3N2 (1/20) antigenic subtypes. No IAV-seropositive wild boar was detected in the WL, although one of 35 animals was found to be IAV-positive by both a reverse transcriptase PCR and a real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. We hypothesize an SIV exposure for IAV-seropositive wild boars occupying the UL, whereas a possible AIV spillover from aquatic bird species—natural reservoirs of IAVs— to wild boars in the WL cannot be ruled out. Further research is needed to better understand the role played by wild boars in IAV ecology in Mediterranean habitats. © Wildlife Disease Association 2019.},

Total reflection X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (TXRF) is used to determine the composition, particularly the presence of potentially toxic elements, of cosmetics. Three sample preparation methods based on suspension preparation were developed for different types of cosmetic samples, e.g. lipsticks, eye shadows and body creams. Limits of detection within the low mg kg−1 range were obtained and enabled cosmetic screening for compliance with the legal thresholds for some major toxic elements. A good accuracy of the results on a wide range of concentration levels (&gt;10000 mg kg−1) was found without the need of sample dilution. Results obtained for most elements in the lipstick and cream samples agreed with those obtained by the reference method recommended by the Food and Drug Administration, based on using inductively coupled plasma techniques after microwave digestion. However, for eyeshadow analysis, a more sophisticate approach is needed to improve the analytical results. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The study assessed Salmonella carriage in wild boars (Sus scrofa) and compared their isolates with those recovered from the domestic swine population of the same area of northern Italy (Emilia-Romagna), characterized by intensive pig farming and rather high density of wild boars. A total of 189 wild boars hunted during twelve months (2017–2018) were tested for Salmonella in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and faecal samples. Antimicrobial resistance of recovered strains was tested against 14 antimicrobials. Salmonella was detected in 33/189 wild boars (17.5%), specifically from 30/189 MLN (15.9%) and 6/189 faecal samples (3.2%). Three animals were positive in both samples. Thirteen Salmonella serovars were identified, i.e. Typhimurium (the most common), Bovismorbificans, Coeln, Derby, Enteritidis, Gaminara, Hessarek, Houtenae IV, Kottbus, Napoli, Stanleyville, Thompson and Veneziana. Salmonella carriage was higher in warm than in cold months (P = 0.0013). Pregnancy status was never associated with Salmonella carriage, with significant difference in the recovery of the pathogen between non-pregnant and pregnant females (P = 0.003). Only one resistance pattern to streptomycin and tetracycline was found in 15 isolates (41.7%) belonging to Typhimurium (14/14; 100%) and Kottbus (1/3; 33.3%) serovars. Overlap with isolates from farmed pigs was limited at serotype level (Typhimurium, Derby, Enteritis, Bovismorbificans, Kottbus) and absent at PFGE level, and also antimicrobial resistance patterns were substantially different. This evidence indicates a substantial segregation of the two animal populations with regard to infectious contacts, possibly suggesting that biosecurity measures in place at industrial farm level limit the exchange of Salmonella. © 2019, EcoHealth Alliance.},

abstract={The wide geographical distribution and genetic diversity of bat-associated lyssaviruses (LYSVs) across Europe suggest that similar viruses may also be harboured in Italian insectivorous bats. Indeed, bats were first included within the passive national surveillance programme for rabies in wildlife in the 1980s, while active surveillance has been performed since 2008. The active surveillance strategies implemented allowed us to detect neutralizing antibodies directed towards European bat 1 lyssavirus in six out of the nine maternity colonies object of the study across the whole country. Seropositive bats were Myotis myotis, M. blythii and Tadarida teniotis. On the contrary, the virus was neither detected through passive nor active surveillance, suggesting that fatal neurological infection is rare also in seropositive colonies. Although the number of tested samples has steadily increased in recent years, submission turned out to be rather sporadic and did not include carcasses from bat species that account for the majority of LYSVs cases in Europe, such as Eptesicus serotinus, M. daubentonii, M. dasycneme and M. nattereri. A closer collaboration with bat handlers is therefore mandatory to improve passive surveillance and decrypt the significance of serological data obtained up to now. © 2018 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract={Many infectious diseases originating from, or carried by, wildlife affect wildlife conservation and biodiversity, livestock health, or human health. We provide an update on changes in the epidemiology of 25 selected infectious, wildlife-related diseases in Europe (from 2010–16) that had an impact, or may have a future impact, on the health of wildlife, livestock, and humans. These pathogens were selected based on their: 1) identification in recent Europe-wide projects as important surveillance targets, 2) inclusion in European Union legislation as pathogens requiring obligatory surveillance, 3) presence in recent literature on wildlife-related diseases in Europe since 2010, 4) inclusion in key pathogen lists released by the Office International des Epizooties, 5) identification in conference presentations and informal discussions on a group email list by a European network of wildlife disease scientists from the European Wildlife Disease Association, or 6) identification as pathogens with changes in their epidemiology during 2010–16. The wildlife pathogens or diseases included in this review are: avian influenza virus, seal influenza virus, lagoviruses, rabies virus, bat lyssaviruses, filoviruses, canine distemper virus, morbilliviruses in aquatic mammals, bluetongue virus, West Nile virus, hantaviruses, Schmallenberg virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, African swine fever virus, amphibian ranavirus, hepatitis E virus, bovine tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis), tularemia (Francisella tularensis), brucellosis (Brucella spp.), salmonellosis (Salmonella spp.), Coxiella burnetii, chytridiomycosis, Echinococcus multilocularis, Leishmania infantum, and chronic wasting disease. Further work is needed to identify all of the key drivers of disease change and emergence, as they appear to be influencing the incidence and spread of these pathogens in Europe. We present a summary of these recent changes during 2010–16 to discuss possible commonalities and drivers of disease change and to identify directions for future work on wildlife-related diseases in Europe. Many of the pathogens are entering Europe from other continents while others are expanding their ranges inside and beyond Europe. Surveillance for these wildlife-related diseases at a continental scale is therefore important for planet-wide assessment, awareness of, and preparedness for the risks they may pose to wildlife, domestic animal, and human health. © Wildlife Disease Association 2019.},

abstract={Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea Virus (PEDV) causes watery diarrhoea, dehydration, and a high mortality rate among suckling pigs. Recently, PEDV had a large negative economic impact on the swine industries in Asia and North America. In 2014, PEDV re-emerged in many European countries, but most countries only reported a few sporadic cases. Here, we report the epidemic wave that occurred in Italy from 2015 to 2017. During this time, PEDV was detected by real-time PCR in 438 farms located mainly in the high-density pig production area in Northern Italy. Most of the outbreaks were in farrow-to-finish, farrow-to-wean and finisher farms. Clinical signs were observed mainly in suckling and fattening animals, while mortality rates were higher in piglets, reaching 50%. A sequence analysis showed that a PEDV strain, similar to the OH851 S-INDEL strain isolated in the USA in January 2014, was responsible for the outbreaks in Italy in 2015 and 2016. However, from January 2017, a recombinant variant strain, containing a portion of the Swine Enteric Coronavirus in the S1 gene, spread and almost completely outcompeted the previous nonrecombinant strain. In total, 14.1% of the environmental swabs collected from trucks at slaughterhouses after animals were unloaded tested positive for PEDV before the trucks were cleaned and disinfected, and 46% remained positive after cleaning and disinfection processes were performed. Moreover, environmental swabs indicated that 17.3% of the empty trucks arriving at the farms to load animals were PEDV-positive. This study indicates that trucks can have an important role in the spread of PEDV in Italy. © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae and causes severe diarrhoea, vomiting, dehydration and high mortality in seronegative newborn piglets. Thus, a precise and rapid diagnosis of PEDV infection is important for the application of control measures to limit viral dissemination. In this investigation, a monoclonal antibodies (MAbs)-based competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting antibodies against PEDV was developed and validated. The diagnostic performance of the test was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis using a panel of 829 known sera collected from different commercial pig farms, with or without a history of PED presence and from experimentally infected pigs. The competitive ELISA showed excellent diagnostic performance and discriminatory power with high sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) values (Se = 96.5%, 95% IC 94.1–98.1; Sp = 98.2%, 95% IC 96.3–99.3). Moreover, this competitive ELISA method has other properties, such as high feasibility of testing sera without pre-treatment and automatic and instrument-mediated revealing, that makes it appropriate for large-scale screenings of affected pig farms in endemic regions or for monitoring plans in PEDV-free areas. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The genetic variability of Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is one of the main challenges for its control, hindering not only the development of effective vaccination strategies but also its classification and, consequently, epidemiology understanding. The 624/I and Q1 genotypes, now recognized to be part of the GI-16 lineage, represent an excellent example of the practical consequences of IBV molecular epidemiology limited knowledge. In fact, being their common origin unrecognized for a long time, independent epidemiological pictures were drawn for the two genotypes. To fix this misinterpretation, the present study reconstructs the history, population dynamics and spreading patterns of GI-16 lineage as a whole using a phylodynamic approach. A collection of worldwide available hypervariable region 1 and 2 (HVR12) and 3 (HVR3) sequences of the S1 protein was analysed together with 258 HVR3 sequences obtained from samples collected in Italy (the country where this genotype was initially identified) since 1963. The results demonstrate that after its emergence at the beginning of the XX century, GI-16 was able to persist until present days in Italy. Approximately in the late 1980s, it migrated to Asia, which became the main nucleus for further spreading to Middle East, Europe and especially South America, likely through multiple introduction events. A remarkable among-country diffusion was also demonstrated in Asia and South America. Interestingly, although most of the recent Italian GI-16 strains originated from ancestral viruses detected in the same country, a couple were closely related to Chinese ones, supporting a backward viral flow from China to Italy. Besides to the specific case-study results, this work highlights the misconceptions that originate from the lack of a unified nomenclature and poor molecular epidemiology data generation and sharing. This shortcoming appears particularly relevant since the described scenario could likely be shared by many other IBV genotypes and pathogens in general.

abstract={Mycobacterium genavense infection was diagnosed in an adult ferret with ptosis of the left eye, a proliferative lesion of the conjunctiva of the nictitating membrane, conjunctival swelling, and tumefaction of the periorbital tissues with a watery ocular discharge and the presence of a retrobulbar mass. The diagnosis was based on characteristic cytology of the retrobulbar mass and left mandibular lymph node that revealed granulomatous inflammation. Ziehl-Neelsen staining showed the presence of positive acid-fast bacilli in the cytoplasm of the macrophages. The diagnosis was confirmed by sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene amplified by using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction from a fresh lymph node biopsy. Therapy with marbofloxacin, rifampicin, and clarithromycin was recommended for 6 months and after this period, the veterinarian who was treating the ferret reported the disappearance of clinical signs. Six months after the end of the antibiotic treatment, the symptoms described previously reoccurred. Confirmatory laboratory tests were not performed but a recurrence of M genavense infection was suspected and the veterinarian, in agreement with the owner, euthanized the ferret. © 2018},

abstract={Responses of animals to environmental changes and their interactions with other species play an important role in conservation. Sharing a common habitat may lead to interspecific competition for resources, but field assessment of these biological events is not always easily accomplished. By using a non-invasive method, we evaluated the physiological stress responses of Apennine chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata) to the presence of cattle, sheep and goat, red deer (Cervus elaphus), people (hikers), and predators to identify which factors may affect this endangered species. During September 2012, November 2012, and July 2013, a total of 318 faecal samples were collected in representative sites and analysed for faecal cortisol metabolites (FCM). FCM concentration was analysed through linear mixed-effect models. A significant increase in FCM values in Apennine chamois sharing their habitat with domestic animals was recorded during all study periods. On the contrary, stress responses to red deer and people were limited in time and emerged only during summer months, when hikers are more frequent and red deer extend their altitudinal range reaching chamois’ habitat. The observed effects of domestic animals, red deer, and hikers should be considered in future Apennine chamois management plans, which should include the regulation of pastured domestic livestock, anthropogenic disturbances, and possible interferences with other wild species within parks. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The epidemiology of invasive listeriosis in humans appears to be weakly characterized in Poland, the sixth most populous member state of the European Union. We obtained antimicrobial susceptibility data, PCR-serogroups and genotypic profiles for 344 invasive isolates of Listeria monocytogenes, collected between 1997 and 2013 in Poland. All isolates were susceptible to the 10 tested antimicrobials, except one that was resistant to tetracycline and minocycline and harbored the tet(M), tet(A) and tet(C) genes. Overall, no increasing MIC values were observed during the study period. Four PCR-serogroups were observed: IVb (55.8%), IIa (34.3%), IIb (8.1%) and IIc (1.8%). We identified clonal complexes (CCs) and epidemic clones (ECs) previously involved in outbreaks worldwide, with the most prevalent CCs/ECs being: CC6/ECII (32.6%), CC1/ECI (17.2%), CC8/ECV (6.1%) and CC2/ECIV (5.5%). The present study is the first extensive analysis of Polish L. monocytogenes isolates from invasive infections. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease of livestock affecting animal production and trade throughout Asia and Africa. Understanding FMD virus (FMDV) global movements and evolution can help to reconstruct the disease spread between endemic regions and predict the risks of incursion into FMD-free countries. Global expansion of a single FMDV lineage is rare but can result in severe economic consequences. Using extensive sequence data we have reconstructed the global space-time transmission history of the O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 lineage (which normally circulates in the Indian sub-continent) providing evidence of at least 15 independent escapes during 2013–2017 that have led to outbreaks in North Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, the Far East and the FMD-free islands of Mauritius. We demonstrated that sequence heterogeneity of this emerging FMDV lineage is accommodated within two co-evolving divergent sublineages and that recombination by exchange of capsid-coding sequences can impact upon the reconstructed evolutionary histories. Thus, we recommend that only sequences encoding the outer capsid proteins should be used for broad-scale phylogeographical reconstruction. These data emphasise the importance of the Indian subcontinent as a source of FMDV that can spread across large distances and illustrates the impact of FMDV genome recombination on FMDV molecular epidemiology. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={Mass strandings of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) are rare in the Mediterranean Sea. Nevertheless, in 2014 a pod of 7 specimens stranded alive along the Italian coast of the Central Adriatic Sea: 3 individuals died on the beach after a few hours due to internal damages induced by prolonged recumbency; the remaining 4 whales were refloated after great efforts. All the dead animals were genetically related females; one was pregnant. All the animals were infected by dolphin morbillivirus (DMV) and the pregnant whale was also affected by a severe nephropathy due to a large kidney stone. Other analyses ruled out other possible relevant factors related to weather conditions or human activities. The results of multidisciplinary post-mortem analyses revealed that the 7 sperm whales entered the Adriatic Sea encountering adverse weather conditions and then kept heading northward following the pregnant but sick leader of the pod, thereby reaching the stranding site. DMV infection most likely played a crucial role in impairing the health condition and orientation abilities of the whales. They did not steer back towards deeper waters, but eventually stranded along the Central Adriatic Sea coastline, a real trap for sperm whales. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={Tuberculosis (TB) affects humans and other animals and is caused by bacteria from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC). Previous studies have shown that there are at least nine members of the MTBC infecting animals other than humans; these have also been referred to as ecotypes. However, the ecology and the evolution of these animal-adapted MTBC ecotypes are poorly understood. Here we screened 12,886 publicly available MTBC genomes and newly sequenced 17 animal-adapted MTBC strains, gathering a total of 529 genomes of animal-adapted MTBC strains. Phylogenomic and comparative analyses confirm that the animal-adapted MTBC members are paraphyletic with some members more closely related to the human-adapted Mycobacterium africanum Lineage 6 than to other animal-adapted strains. Furthermore, we identified four main animal-adapted MTBC clades that might correspond to four main host shifts; two of these clades are hypothesized to reflect independent cattle domestication events. Contrary to what would be expected from an obligate pathogen, MTBC nucleotide diversity was not positively correlated with host phylogenetic distances, suggesting that host tropism in the animal-adapted MTBC seems to be driven by contact rates and demographic aspects of the host population rather by than host relatedness. By combining phylogenomics with ecological data, we propose an evolutionary scenario in which the ancestor of Lineage 6 and all animal-adapted MTBC ecotypes was a generalist pathogen that subsequently adapted to different host species. This study provides a new phylogenetic framework to better understand the evolution of the different ecotypes of the MTBC and guide future work aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying host range.

Classification was performed on the fused data by Partial Least Squares – Discriminant Analysis; a strict validation protocol was used to estimate the predictive performances of the models. The best results were obtained with high-level data fusion combining Raman and NIR spectroscopy and PTR-MS, with classification performances better than those obtained on single analytical sources (accuracy of 99% and 100% on test and training samples respectively). The combination of just three analytical sources assures a limited time of analysis. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={PRRS is one of the main viral diseases in pig production, causing huge economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. The virus shows an intrinsic genomic instability and is able to change continuously, with the emergence of new strains, with different pathogenicity patterns. Commercially available vaccines only partially prevent or counteract the disease and the correlated losses. Moreover, the emergence of highly virulent and pathogenetic isolates represents a particular concern for PRRS control and diagnosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a modified-live virus (MLV) PRRSV-1 commercial vaccine in reducing the severity of the disease and minimizing losses upon challenge with a highly pathogenic PRRSV-1.1 Italian isolate (PRRSV-1_PR40/2014). Four different groups were compared: C (unvaccinated-uninfected), VAC-C (vaccinated-uninfected), PR40 (unvaccinated-infected) and VAC-PR40 (vaccinated-infected). The tested vaccine provided partial, but statistically significant clinical, virological and pathological protection after challenge under experimental conditions. In particular, vaccinated animals showed reduced viremia in terms of duration and magnitude, reduced respiratory signs and pathological lesions. Vaccination was able to trigger adaptive immunity able to respond efficiently also against the HP PR40 isolate. Vaccinated animals showed higher average daily weight gain, even during the viremic period, compared to non-vaccinated challenged pigs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The acute course of disease in young oysters infected by OsHV-1 and the rapid tissue degradation often preclude histological examination of specimens collected during outbreaks in field. Herein, live spat originated from two geographical areas were sampled just at the onset of a mortality event that occurred in Normandy (France) in June 2016. The lesions, associated with high OsHV-1 DNA quantities, were characterized by severe and diffuse haemocytosis mainly involving blast-like cells, myocyte degeneration and large, irregularly shaped degenerate eosinophilic cells in the connective tissue. The herpesvirus was identified by negative staining TEM and real-time PCR. Sequencing of the C region and ORFs 42/43 confirmed that the variants met the definition of OsHV-1 μVar. We sequenced 30 other ORFs in twenty OsHV-1-positive individuals and compared them to the μVar specimens isolated between 2009 and 2011. The ORFs encoding putative membrane proteins showed the highest number of variations. Seven different genotypes were identified, confirming the presence of relevant genetic diversity. Phylogenetic analysis provided evidence for a well-separated μVar new group, with an evolutionary divergence estimated at 0.0013 from the other μVar variants. The geographical distribution of these newly described variants and their effective virulence should be investigated in future. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={7-Hydroxymatairesinol (7-HMR) is a plant lignan abundant in various concentrations in plant foods. The objective of this study was to test HMRLignan™, a purified form of 7-HMR, and the corresponding Picea abies extract (total extract P. abies; TEP) as dietary supplements on a background of a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic syndrome in mice and in the 3T3-L1 adipogenesis model. Mice, 3 weeks old, were fed a HFD for 60 d. Subgroups were treated with 3 mg/kg body weight 7-HMR (HMRLignan™) or 10 mg/kg body weight TEP by oral administration. 7-HMR and TEP limited the increase in body weight (-11 and -13 %) and fat mass (-11 and -18 %) in the HFD-fed mice. Epididymal adipocytes were 19 and -12 % smaller and the liver was less steatotic (-62 and -65 %). Serum lipids decreased in TEP-treated mice (-11 % cholesterol, -23 % LDL and -15 % TAG) and sugar metabolism was ameliorated by both lignan preparations, as shown by a more than 70 % decrease in insulin secretion and insulin resistance. The expression of several metabolic genes was modulated by the HFD with an effect that was reversed by lignan. In 3T3-L1 cells, the 7-HMR metabolites enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol (END) showed a 40 % inhibition of cell differentiation accompanied by the inhibited expression of the adipogenic genes PPARγ, C/EBPα and aP2. Furthermore, END and ENL caused a 10 % reduction in TAG uptake in HEPA 1-6 hepatoma cells. In conclusion, 7-HMR and TEP reduce metabolic imbalances typical of the metabolic syndrome and obesity in male mice, whereas their metabolites inhibit adipogenesis and lipid uptake in vitro. © © The Authors 2018.},

abstract={The sand flies are the biological vectors of a variety of viruses belonging to the Phlebovirus genus. As several of these viruses, like Toscana virus, are important agents of diseases in humans, the definition the phleboviruses circulating in a particular area is an important health issue. This work presents results obtained between 2013 and 2016, by testing 25,853 field-collected sand flies, sampled at 50 sites in the Northern edge of the Apennine Mountains, in Emilia-Romagna and Lombardy regions (Italy). Isolation of the three reassortant Ponticelli I, II, and III viruses was successful from five pools of sand flies. These results, and phylogenetic analysis made by obtained sequences, suggest the presence of eight different viruses: Toscana virus, Fermo-like virus, Corfou virus, Ponticelli viruses, and two unknown putative viruses. The co-circulation of different phlebovirus reported in this study, indicate a very dynamic and complex situation, which deserves a more detailed investigation to characterize their possible pathogenicity to humans and animals. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper presents the successful application of total reflection X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (TXRF) for the identification of products obtained from mechanically separated meat (MSM), a very important issue for food quality and safety. According to the European Food Safety Authority, one of the most important parameters to distinguish MSM is the content of Ca. Consequently, the development of reliable and cost-effective analytical tools is very important to monitor the chemical composition of these foods. In this study, we have developed an analytical method for elemental analysis of meat samples based on total reflection X-ray fluorescence. A simple sample preparation by suspending the grinded meat sample in a solution of diluted Triton X-100 and polyvinyl alcohol in water showed to be the best for this kind of samples. Fresh chicken meat, chicken meat with different percentage of MSM, pure MSM and meat products prepared with MSM were analyzed. The content of K, Ca, Fe, Cu and Zn was determined. Results show that Ca, but also K and Fe are significant markers to distinguish MSM from fresh meat. A limit of 40% MSM for differentiation was achieved by applying principal component analysis. The method accuracy was evaluated comparing the obtained results with those obtained after acidic digestion and ICP-MS analysis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The recent outbreak of Salmonella Agona linked to the consumption of infant formula (powdered formula) has rekindled the attention about the correct procedures for preparation and use of these products. International guidelines have already been published so far, particularly in association with Cronobacter sakazakii in early 2000s. FAO/WHO suggested to reconstitute formula with water at no less than 708C. We therefore contaminated powdered formula with low levels of Salmonella spp and C sakazakii to evaluate the pathogens inactivation during the formula preparation using water at 708C. In these conditions we observed a survival of both pathogens, indicating that the suggested recommendations may be not enough to guarantee the safety of this product. Higher temperatures are needed to reduce the biological risk, even if it may be not easily realized in actual domestic conditions. Moreover, the impact on the nutritional value of reconstituted formulas should be evaluated. Copyright © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.},

abstract={Mitogens are diverse compounds of plant and microbial origin, widely employed to test immunocompetence in animals. The blastogenic response of bovine Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) to lypopolysaccharides (LPS) has been investigated in our laboratories for a long time. In particular, a possible correlation between blastogenic response to LPS and disease resistance of periparturient dairy cows had been observed in previous studies. Most important, low responder cows presented a higher frequency of disease cases after calving, compared with high responder animals. Owing to the above, different aspects of the blastogenic response to LPS were investigated on PBMC of healthy Friesian cows, using a 72-hour Bromodeoxyuridin (BrDU) cell proliferation assay. Stimulation with LPS induced little if any replication of bovine PBMC over 72 hours despite consistent BrDU detection in all the PBMC samples under study. Poor replication of LPS-stimulated PBMC was confirmed by cell cycle and cell growth flow cytometry analyses. In particular, LPS stimulation gave rise to very low percentages of S phase cells, sometimes lower than in control, unstimulated cells, as opposed to Concanavalin A-stimulated PBMC. Magnetic separation and analysis of BrDU-treated bovine PBMC after exposure to LPS showed that both B and CD4 T cells are involved in the blastogenic response to LPS, in contrast with current data based on human and murine models. Finally, LPS caused an early, specific up-regulation of TNF-α and TLR4 genes in bovine PBMC, and significant correlations were shown between the expression of inflammatory cytokine and Indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) genes. On the whole, our data indicate that differences in the blastogenic response to LPS could be partly accounted for by heterogenicity of responding cells (B and T lymphocytes), which might also have an impact on induction and regulation of inflammatory responses and endotoxin tolerance. © 2018 Amadori et al.},

abstract={There is currently an increased interest in the use of serological approaches in combination with traditional cell-mediated immunity-based techniques to improve the detection of tuberculosis (TB)-infected animals. In the present study, we developed and validated two different serological TB-detection assays using four antigens, MPB70, MPB83, ESAT6 and CFP10, and the tuberculin PPDb. A conventional multi-antigen TB-ELISA method and a novel TB multiplex test, based on Luminex technology, were developed to detect antibodies to multiple antigen targets. The performance levels of the two tests were evaluated and compared using selected panels of samples having known TB states. The TB-ELISA test (containing five antigens, including PPDb) had a sensitivity (Se) of 74.2% and a specificity (Sp) of 94.9%, while the TB-Luminex test had higher Se (79.0%) and Sp (99.1%) rates even when only one reactive antigen was used to classify the test as positive. If a more restrictive criterion, requiring two positive antigens to classify the test as positive, was used, then the TB-ELISA's Sp rate increased to 99.8% but the Se decreased to 61.3%, while the TB-Luminex test's Sp rate increased to 100% but the Se decreased to 51.2%. TB-ELISA and TB-Luminex were applied to a panel of 257 sera collected from bTB-positive herds, as determined by a post-mortem inspection. They showed good performance levels, identifying 49 (80.3%) and 48 (78.7%), respectively, of 61 samples that had tested positive by the intradermal tuberculin (IDT) test and/or interferon-gamma assay. In addition, TB-ELISA and TB-Luminex were able to identify 60 and 42 samples as positive, respectively, out of the 196 samples that tested negative to IDT and interferon-gamma at the time of serum collection. Subsequent IDT tests performed after 1–2 months, confirmed the positivity of 18 samples, indicating the strategic value of having two serological assays to detect TB-infected herds that were not reactive to initial IDT testing, thereby allowing for the rapid control of outbreaks and eradication of the disease. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={6-Aminonicotinamide (6AN) is an antimetabolite used to inhibit the NADPH-producing pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in many cellular systems, making them more susceptible to oxidative stress. It is converted by a NAD(P)+ glycohydrolase to 6-aminoNAD and 6-aminoNADP, causing the accumulation of PPP intermediates, due to their inability to participate in redox reactions. Some parasites like Plasmodium falciparum and Coccidia are highly sensitive but not all cell types showed a strong responsiveness to 6AN, probably due to the different targeted pathway. For instance, in bacteria the main target is the Preiss-Handler salvage pathway for NAD+ biosynthesis. We were interested in testing 6AN on the kinetoplastid protozoan Leishmania as another model to clarify the mechanisms of action of 6AN, by using metabolomics. Leishmania promastigotes, the life-cycle stage residing in the sandfly, demonstrated a three order of magnitude higher EC50 (mM) compared to P. falciparum and mammalian cells (μM), although pre-treatment with 100 μM 6AN prior to sub-lethal oxidative challenge induced a supra-additive cell kill in L. infantum. By metabolomics, we did not detect 6ANAD/P suggesting that NAD+ glycohydrolases in Leishmania may not be highly efficient in catalysing transglycosidation as happens in other microorganisms. Contrariwise to the reported effect on 6AN-treated cancer cells, we did not detect 6-phosphogluconate (6 PG) accumulation, indicating that 6ANADP cannot bind with high affinity to the PPP enzyme 6 PG dehydrogenase. By contrast, 6AN caused a profound phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) decrease and nucleobases accumulation confirming that PPP is somehow affected. More importantly, we found a decrease in nicotinate production, evidencing the interference with the Preiss-Handler salvage pathway for NAD+ biosynthesis, most probably by inhibiting the reaction catalysed by nicotinamidase. Therefore, our combined data from Leishmania strains, though confirming the interference with PPP, also showed that 6AN impairs the Preiss-Handler pathway, underlining the importance to develop compounds targeting this last route. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Dry and early lactation periods represent the most critical phases for udder health in cattle, especially in highly productive breeds, such as the Holstein Friesian (HF). On the other hand, some autochthonous cattle breeds, such as the Rendena (REN), have a lower prevalence of mastitis and other transition-related diseases. In this study, milk microbiota of 6 HF and 3 REN cows, all raised on the same farm under the same conditions, was compared. A special focus was placed on the transition period to define bacterial groups’ prevalence with a plausible effect on mammary gland health. Four time points (dry-off, 1 d, 7–10 d and 30 d after calving) were considered. Through 16S rRNA sequencing, we characterized the microbiota composition for 117 out of the 144 milk samples initially collected, keeping only the healthy quarters, in order to focus on physiological microbiome changes and avoid shifts due to suspected diseases. Microbial populations were very different in the two breeds along all the time points, with REN milk showing a significantly lower microbial biodiversity. The taxonomic profiles of both cosmopolitan and local breeds were dominated by Firmicutes, mostly represented by the Streptococcus genus, although in very different proportions (HF 27.5%, REN 68.6%). Large differences in HF and REN cows were, also, evident from the metabolic predictive analysis from microbiome data. Finally, only HF milk displayed significant changes in the microbial composition along the transition period, while REN maintained a more stable microbiota. In conclusion, in addition to the influence on the final characteristics of dairy products obtained from milk of the two breeds, differences in the milk microbiome might, also, have an impact on their mammary gland health.

abstract={Salmonella Typhimurium (including S.Typhimurium 1,4,[5],12:i-) and other enteric pathogens cause acute infection in pigs during the weaning stage, often evolving into chronic infections responsible for the introduction of zoonotic bacteria into the slaughterhouse and thus determining carcass contamination. In addition to being zoonotic hazards, these pathogens are responsible for economic losses in affected farms. Traditionally, antibiotic treatments have been largely administered in order to reduce the infection burden but it favored, as a direct consequence, an increase in the number of multi-drug resistance strains. In order to overcome antibiotic-resistance concerns, new alternative control strategies should be developed. In this context, a blend of organic acids, phytochemicals and a permeabilizing complex, administered in feed (Group A - 459 piglets) or water (Group B – 458 piglets), was tested in field conditions for its capability of reducing Salmonella-infection in weaned piglets of an endemic farm. Data recorded were compared to results of a control group (Group C - 456 piglets). Zootechnical parameters were recorded in all animals, while microbiological, serological and PCR analyses were conducted in 15 piglets for each group. Results demonstrated that additive administered in feed improved animal weight gain (better average daily gain [A.D.G.] and increment), and rapidly reduced Salmonella-shedding in feces. Administration of additive in feed gave better results than in water. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In 2016 and 2017, 509 raw milk samples were collected from bulk milk tanks in 315 dairy farms in Parma province, Italy. Yersinia pseudotuberculosis was never detected. Yersinia enterocolitica was isolated from 17 (3.1%) bulk milk samples by culture methods. Estimated apparent prevalence was 3.91% in 2016, and 2.63% in 2017, with no significant difference between the two years (df = 1; p-value = 0.419). Five BT 2/O:5,27 and 12 BT 1A isolates were detected. The most common virulence genes (ail, inv, virF, yadA, ystA, ystB, myfA, irp2, fyuA) were screened and the genes ail, virF, yadA, ystA were harboured only by 2 O:5,27 isolates. The Italian strains were very close by SNP analysis. The 2 O:5,27 isolates showed a unique antimicrobial resistance pattern, being resistant to amoxicillin, cefoxitin, cephalexin and amoxicillin - clavulanic acid. The study suggests that consumption of raw or improperly pasteurised milk may be hazardous for the consumers. © 2018},

abstract={Fishing activities are considered one of the most relevant threats for cetaceans and sea turtles conservation since these animals are sometimes found dead entangled in fishing gears. Currently, postmortem diagnosis is based mainly on the presence of nets and lines on the body and the related marks and injuries evident at gross examination. A more detailed and objective evidence is needed to clarify doubts cases and the diatoms technique, used in forensic human medicine, could support drowning diagnosis also in this field. Diatoms’ investigation was implemented to be applied in marine vertebrate on 8 striped (Stenella coeruleoalba) and 1 bottlenose (Tursiops truncatus) dolphins and 5 sea turtles (Caretta caretta) stranded along the Italian coastlines with a likely cause of death hypothized on necropsies carried out by veterinary pathologists. Diatoms were microscopically searched in the bone marrow collected from long bones implementing protocols used in human medicine and their presence was observed in 4 cetaceans and 2 sea turtles. Despite a clear relation between diatoms’ presence and amount and the likely cause of death was not proved due to the poor number of samples, the higher burden of diatoms was found in 3 animals deemed to be death for the interaction with human activity. Despite more studied are necessary to identify the possible relation between the cause of death and diatoms’ findings, the present study implemented this technique to be adapted to marine animals, confirming its possible application also in veterinary forensic medicine. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a zoonotic pathogen with consumption of pork and derived products identified in different countries as a risk factor for human exposure to HEV. Great efforts have been made to understand the dynamics of virus transmission within domestic swine populations through modelling. However, from a food safety prospective, it is critical to integrate the parameters involved in the transmission dynamics with those governing the actual presence of HEV in the bloodstream, the liver, gallbladder or faeces. To date, several aspects related to the pathogenesis of the disease are still unknown or characterized by significant levels of uncertainty, making this conjunction challenging. We used published serological data obtained from pigs in a farrow-to-finish farm to implement an Immune-Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (MSIR) model reproducing the on-farm dynamics that lead to the occurrence of viraemic pigs at slaughter. Expert opinion on the length of time infectious HEV can be detected in liver, gallbladder/bile and faeces after recovery from viraemic status were used to inform a stochastic model aimed at estimating the expected proportion of viraemic pigs, pigs with infectious HEV in liver, gallbladder/bile and faeces entering the slaughterhouse. To simulate the potential effect of on-farm mitigation strategies, we estimated the changes in outcomes of interest as a function of variations in the baseline transmission parameters. The model predicted a proportion of viraemic pigs entering the slaughterhouse of 13.8% while the proportions of, and ranged from 13.8% to 94.4%, 13.8% to 94.7% and from 25.3% to 30.8% respectively, due to the uncertainty surrounding the experts’ opinions. Variations in MSIR model's parameters alert of the need to carefully consider the application of mitigation strategies aimed at delaying the decay of maternal immunity or the peak of the within herd transmission. When the rate of decay of maternal immunity and the transmission rate were decreased between 80% and 5% and 40% and 5% from the baseline values respectively, adverse effects on were observed. The model highlights the relevance of specific aspects in the pathogenesis of the disease from a food safety prospective and it was developed to be easily reproducible and updatable as soon as accurate data becomes available. As presented, the model can be directly connected to existing or future pig-related models to estimate the significance of the identified parameters on the risk of human exposure to HEV through consumption of pork products. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Wild dabbling ducks are the main reservoir for avian influenza (AI) viruses and pose an ongoing threat to commercial poultry flocks. Combining the (i) size of that population, (ii) their flight distances and (iii) their AI prevalence, the density of AI-infected dabbling ducks (DID) was calculated as a risk factor for the introduction of AI viruses into poultry holdings of Emilia-Romagna region, Northern Italy. Data on 747 poultry holdings and on 39 AI primary outbreaks notified in Emilia-Romagna between 2000 and 2017 were used to validate that risk factor. A multivariable Bayesian logistic regression was performed to assess whether DID could be associated with the occurrence of AI primary outbreaks. DID value, being an outdoor flock, hobby poultry trading, species reared, length of cycle and flock size were used as explanatory variables. Being an outdoor poultry flock was significantly associated with a higher risk of AI outbreak occurrence. The probability of DID to be a risk factor for AI virus introduction was estimated to be 90%. A DID cut-off of 0.23 was identified to define high-risk areas for AI virus introduction. Using this value, the high-risk area covers 43% of the region. Seventy-four per cent of the primary AI outbreaks have occurred in that area, containing 39% of the regional poultry holdings. Poultry holdings located in areas with a high DID value should be included in a risk-based surveillance programme aimed at AI early detection. © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) affects economically important livestock and is one of the most contagious viral diseases. The most commonly used FMD diagnostic assay is a sandwich ELISA. However, the main disadvantage of this ELISA is that it requires anti-FMD virus (FMDV) serotype-specific antibodies raised in small animals. This problem can be, in part, overcome by using anti-FMDV monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) as detecting reagents. However, the long-term use of MAbs may be problematic and they may need to be replaced. Here we have constructed chimeric antibodies (mouse/rabbit D9) and Fabs (fragment antigen-binding) (mouse/cattle D9) using the Fv (fragment variable) regions of a mouse MAb, D9 (MAb D9), which recognises type O FMDV. The mouse/rabbit D9 chimeric antibody retained the FMDV serotype-specificity of MAb D9 and performed well in a FMDV detection ELISA as well as in routine laboratory assays. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis confirmed engagement with antigenic site 1 and peptide competition studies identified the aspartic acid at residue VP1 147 as a novel component of the D9 epitope. This chimeric expression approach is a simple but effective way to preserve valuable FMDV antibodies, and has the potential for unlimited generation of antibodies and antibody fragments in recombinant systems with the concomitant positive impacts on the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement) principles. © 2018 Shimmon et al.

abstract={Salmonella enterica serovar Napoli (serovar Napoli) is an emerging cause of human salmonellosis in Northern Italy. No specific reservoirs of serovar Napoli have been identified in Italy, so far. However, the environment, especially surface waters, has been hypothesized as an important source of infection based on the observation that genotypically different clusters of serovar Napoli are detected in different geographical macro-areas. To further support the hypothesis of a spatially-restricted pattern of serovar Napoli diffusion, a spatial segregation of serovar Napoli lineages should be observed also at smaller geographical scale. However, classical genotyping techniques used for Salmonella, such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), did not possess enough discriminatory power to highlight spatial clustering of serovar Napoli within the macro-areas. To this purpose, we performed phylogeographical analyses based on genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms to test whether spatiotemporal evolution patterns of serovar Napoli in Northern Italy could be recognized with high geographical resolution, i.e. at local level. Specifically, we analyzed the local spread of the main PFGE clonal group, responsible for more than 60% of human infections in the study area, that did not show any geographical differentiation by PFGE within Northern Italy, i.e. the macro-area considered in the study. Both discrete and continuous phylogeography highlighted the existence of two main geographically-restricted clades: a Southern clade corresponding to the Po Valley and a Northern clade corresponding to the Pre-Alps area. Furthermore, the phylogeographical analyses suggested that the most probable site of origin of the clone was in an area of the Po Valley at the confluence of the Po and Ticino rivers, one of the most important Italian wetlands. These findings provide further support to the hypothesis that environmental transmission may play an important role in the ecology of serovar Napoli. © 2018 Gori et al.

abstract={The study summarises the results obtained over the period 2002-2013 by the Italian IT-Enter-Vet network, aimed at collecting data on Salmonella isolates from non-human sources. A total of 42,491 Salmonella isolates were reported with a progressive decrease over the years. S. Typhimurium was the most frequent serovar up to 2011, but then, it was overtaken by S. 4,[5],12,:i:-, S. Derby, S. Livingstone and S. Enteritidis alternated as the third most commonly isolated serovars. With regard to the sources of isolation, S. Typhimurium was distributed ubiquitously among the animal species. On the contrary, S. 4,[5],12,:i:- and S. Derby were strictly associated with pigs, whereas S. Livingstone, S. Enteritidis and S. Infantis were clearly related to poultry. Intriguingly, when the frequency of serovar distribution along the food chain was considered, it was evident that S. Typhimurium and S. Derby tended to persist along the chain, as they were isolated even more frequently from foods than from animals. A similar distribution was found for S. Enteritidis and S. Hadar. Despite limitations related to non-mandatory participation of laboratories in the network, the data presented are valuable to obtain a picture of the evolution of Salmonella from non-human sources over time in Italy. © British Veterinary Association (unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

abstract={Background: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by Leishmania infantum is an ongoing health problem in southern Europe, where dogs are considered the main reservoirs of the disease. Current data point to a northward spread of VL and canine leishmaniasis (CanL) in Italy, with new foci in northern regions previously regarded as non-endemic. Methodology/Principal findings: Multilocus microsatellite typing (MLMT) was performed to investigate genetic diversity and population structure of L. infantum on 55 samples from infected humans, dogs and sand flies of the E-R region between 2013 and 2017. E-R samples were compared with 10 L. infantum samples from VL cases in other Italian regions (extra E-R) and with 52 strains within the L. donovani complex. Data displayed significant microsatellite polymorphisms with low allelic heterozygosity. Forty-one unique and eight repeated MLMT profiles were recognized among the L. infantum samples from E-R, and ten unique MLMT profiles were assigned to the extra E-R samples. Bayesian analysis assigned E-R samples to two distinct populations, with further sub-structuring within each of them; all CanL samples belonged to one population, genetically related to Mediterranean MON-1 strains, while all but one VL cases as well as the isolate from the sand fly Phlebotomus perfiliewi fell under the second population. Conversely, VL samples from other Italian regions proved to be genetically similar to strains circulating in dogs. Conclusions/Significance: A peculiar epidemiological situation was observed in northeastern Italy, with the co-circulation of two distinct populations of L. infantum; one population mainly detected in dogs and the other population detected in humans and in a sand fly. While the classical cycle of CanL in Italy fits well into the data obtained for the first population, the population found in infected humans exhibits a different cycle, probably not involving a canine reservoir. This study can contribute to a better understanding of the population structure of L. infantum circulating in northeastern Italy, thus providing useful epidemiologic information for public health authorities. © 2018 Rugna et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.},

abstract={Aims: To evaluate the survival of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) during anaerobic digestion (AD), we studied two different biogas plants loaded with manure and slurry from paratuberculosis-infected dairy herds. Methods and Results: Both plants were operating under mesophilic conditions, the first with a single digester and the second with a double digester. Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis detection was performed by sampling each stage of the process, specifically the prefermenter, fermenter, liquid digestate and solid digestate stages, for 11 months. In both plants, MAP was isolated from the prefermenter stage. Only the final products, the solid and liquid digestates, of the one-stage plant showed viable MAP, while no viable MAP was detected in the digestates of the two-stage plant. Conclusions: Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis showed a significant decrease during subsequent steps of the AD process, particularly in the two-stage plant. We suggest that the second digester maintained the digestate under anaerobic conditions for a longer period of time, thus reducing MAP survival and MAP load under the culture detection limit. Significance and Impact of the Study: Our data are unable to exclude the presence of MAP in the final products of the biogas plants, particularly those products from the single digester; therefore, the use of digestates as fertilizers is a real concern related to the possible environmental contamination with MAP. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={This study fully describes a severe disease outbreak occurred in 2016 in black bullhead catfish farmed in Italy. Affected fish showed nervous clinical signs as well as emaciations and haemorrhagic petechiae on the skin at the fin bases, abdomen and gills. Viral isolation in cell culture allowed the subsequent identification of a rhabdovirus, tentatively named ictalurid rhabdovirus (IcRV), through electron microscopy, immunofluorescence and whole genome sequencing (WGS). The newly isolated virus, together with 14 additional viral strains stored in our repository and detected during similar mortality episodes in the period 1993–2016, was phylogenetically analysed on the basis of the nucleoprotein and the glycoprotein nucleotide and amino acid sequences. The genetic distances among Italian IcRV strains were also estimated. Our results show that all the IcRV strains belong to the genus Sprivivirus and are closely related to the tench rhabdovirus (TenRV). Italian catfish production is constantly decreasing, mainly due to viral infections, which include the newly characterized IcRV. Data presented in this work will assist to investigate the molecular epidemiology and the diffusive dynamics of this virus and to develop adequate surveillance activities. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={Midichloria mitochondrii is a tick-borne intracellular bacterium of the order Rickettsiales, found with high prevalence in the sheep tick (Ixodes ricinus). Midichloria mitochondrii is capable of vertical transmission in the tick, but recently evidence of potential horizontal transmission to the tick hosts through the blood meal has been reported. We investigated the presence of the bacterium in the blood of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) collected from an area known to be highly infested with I. ricinus ticks. We collected blood and sera samples for 3 yr in Gardouch (Haute Garonne, France) and subjected them to molecular screening through PCR and to serological investigation using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blot. Bacterial DNA was detected in the blood of four of seven animals, but only at one or two points in time, whereas all sera were positive for M. mitochondrii antigens at all times. Our results indicated that the presence of the bacterium in the blood is transient, but the antibody response appeared to be long-lasting, possibly due to constant exposure to tick bites, and thus to repeated injection of bacteria. The role of M. mitochondrii in the mammalian host, and its interaction with other tick-borne bacteria, remains unknown. © Wildlife Disease Association 2018.},

abstract={The implementation of the European Union strategy for polychlorodibenzo-dioxins and -furans (PCDD/Fs), and dioxin-like polychlorobiphenyls (DL-PCBs) is determining a general reduction of their presence in the environment and in the food chain. The most important route for human exposure to these substances is food consumption and, as a consequence, a progressive decrease of their dietary intake has been observed in the last decades. In this context, it seemed worth updating the PCDD/F and DL-PCB intake estimation for the Italian population. A total of 2659 samples of food of animal and vegetable origin analyzed for PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs in the period 2013–2016 by accredited official laboratories and the national food consumption database were considered for the dietary intake assessment in different age groups of the Italian general population The median cumulative intake estimates expressed as pg WHO-TEQ/kg body weight per day and computed with a deterministic and a probabilistic approach were 1.40–1.52 for children, 0.82–0.85 for adolescents, and 0.64–0.61 for adults, respectively. Such results confirm the decreasing trend of PCDD/F and DL-PCB dietary intake even though the Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) value of 2 WHO-TEQ/kg body weight per day is exceeded at the 95th percentile for all age groups, with children as sensitive group. Most contributing food categories to the intake resulted fish, food of vegetable origin, and cheese. A sensitivity analysis was also performed to calculate the target contamination levels able to keep the dietary exposure below the TDI.

abstract={Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) is an elusive model of host/virus relationship in which disease is determined by virus pathogenicity, pig breed susceptibility and phenotype, microbial infectious pressure and environmental conditions. Successful disease control in PRRS-endemic Countries corresponds to “stability”, i.e. a condition with no clinical signs of PRRS in the breeding-herd population and no viremia in weaning-age pigs. The aim of this work was to compare the profile and time-course of humoral and cell-mediated immunity in stable and unstable herds, respectively. In particular, we investigated PRRS virus (PRRSV) in serum and group oral fluid samples by Real-time RT-PCR, PRRSV-specific IgA and IgG in oral fluids, serum IgG antibody and the cell-mediated response (PRRSV-specific release of interferon-gamma) in whole blood samples. These parameters were measured in order to identify possible discrepancies in the development and kinetics of the immune response against PRRSV. PRRS-free gilts got regularly infected after entering PRRS-stable and unstable farms. In an open cycle, unstable pig farm PRRSV infection could be demonstrated in all groups of pigs, including suckling piglets. Four main results should be highlighted: A) the precocity of the Ab response in group oral fluids was generally similar to that recorded in sera; B) circulation of PRRSV was consistently detected in all age groups in the unstable herds, as opposed to the stable ones; C) an early, balanced, IgA and IgG response in oral fluids was only observed in the stable herds; D) an early IFN-gamma response after PRRSV infection was often observed in stable herds, as opposed to the unstable ones. These were characterized by IFN-gamma responses in piglets, likely due to transfer of maternal immunity. Most important, the mucosal IgA response was associated with cessation of virus excretion in oral fluid samples of PRRS-unstable herds. The above findings indicate that a peculiar profile of immune response to PRRSV can be found in PRRS-stable herds. Therefore, the outlined immune parameters can represent a useful readout system to evaluate successful adaptation to PRRSV based on acclimatization of breeding animals and management of pig flow. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={During 2014-2015, 300 pig carcasses before chilling and 85 food contact surfaces (FCSs) at cutting lines were tested for Salmonella in three slaughterhouses (namely A, B, and C) of northern Italy. In slaughterhouses A and B, four carcass sites of 100 cm 2 each (from both the exterior and interior side) were swabbed with a single sponge. In abattoir C, four 100 cm 2 sites of the exterior and the interior sides were swabbed with two independent sponges. The population average prevalence of Salmonella-positive carcasses (which takes into account the structure of the study design, with multiple samples collected in a single day) in slaughterhouses A and B was 12.3%, while in slaughterhouse C it was 11.2%. Presence of Salmonella on exterior and interior sides of carcasses showed a low level of concordance (only 3/12 of the contaminated carcasses were positive on both sides). No significant difference was found for FCSs contamination in the three slaughterhouses, with a population average prevalence of Salmonella-positive FCSs of 19.9%. In addition, we found that the clustering due to the day of sampling account for more than 36% and 60% of the overall prevalence variation on carcasses and FCSs, respectively. Eight serovars were identified, with Salmonella Derby as the most common type. The counting of Salmonella on carcasses showed large variability. It was low (&lt;0.0075 most probable number [MPN]/cm 2 ) in 46.6% of the carcasses and as high as 2.7 MPN/cm 2 in 4.7%. Specifically, we found that counts on carcasses fit with "heavy tailed" distributions (lognormal and Weibull with a small shape parameter), suggesting not negligible probability of episodes of high Salmonella contamination. The mean values of contamination obtained with the two distributions ranged from 0.235 to 0.435 MPN/cm 2 . © Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2018.},

abstract={Protothecal mastitis poses an emergent animal health problem in dairy herds, with a high impact on dairy industries, causing heavy economic losses. Current methods of treating protothecal infections are ineffective, and no drug is licensed for use in cattle. The aim of the present study was to check the antialgal activity of 30 chemically defined essential oils (EOs) against Prototheca zopfii and Prototheca blaschkeae isolated from the milk of dairy cows with mastitis. A microdilution test was carried out to estimate the antialgal effectiveness of the selected chemically defined EOs. The microdilution test showed different degrees of inhibition among the examined Prototheca species. The activity of some of the examined EOs seem interesting. In particular, Citrus paradisi yielded the lowest minimal inhibitory concentration values (0.75%) for both algal species. P. zopfii appeared to be more sensitive to EOs in comparison to P. blaschkeae. The present study investigated the in vitro susceptibility of P. zopfii and P. blaschkeae to a wide range of EOs, obtained from different botanical families. Further investigations are necessary to evaluate the efficacy of EO-based formulations intended for the disinfection of both udder and milking products. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Female reproductive performance is a central component of ungulate population dynamics, and it can be influenced by individual, social, and environmental factors. Researchers have often assumed direct effects of different predictors on reproduction, yet more complex relationships should be considered when investigating temporal variations in life-history traits within a broader eco-evolutionary context. In this study, we explored direct effects of individual, social, and environmental predictors on female reproductive performance and investigated potential causal chains among variables. We analyzed the variation in fecundity, measured as the probability of being pregnant, in 215 adult female deer Cervus elaphus culled on the Italian Alps, with respect to age, body mass, kidney fat, jaw length, lactation status, population size, temperature and precipitation in spring–summer, temperature and snow depth in winter, and the delayed effect of spring–summer temperature. We used random forest and logistic regression models to select variables whose direct effects best explained variation in fecundity. Path analysis was used to test for alternative hypotheses of direct/indirect effects between pre-selected weather (spring–summer temperature) and individual (age, kidney fat index [KFI]) predictors. The most important direct predictors of fecundity were age, kidney fat, and the interaction between kidney fat and spring–summer temperature. Path analysis supported the hypothesis that higher spring–summer temperature had negative, indirect effects on the probability of being pregnant, mediated by decreasing values of KFI. Our study revealed some complex, cause–effect relationships between weather stochasticity, body condition, and reproduction, possibly suggesting a conditional trade-off between opportunity for reproduction and survival, and emphasizing how environmental variations and individual characteristics may interact to shape life-history traits in ungulate populations. © 2018 The Authors.},

abstract={Objectives: KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) represent a serious problem worldwide. Herein, we describe the evolution of ceftazidime/avibactam resistance by sequencing longitudinal clinical isolates from a patient with KPC-Kp bloodstream infection undergoing ceftazidime/avibactam treatment. Methods: WGS was performed on one ceftazidime/avibactam-susceptible KPC-Kp (BOT-CA-S) and two phenotypically different ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant KPC-Kp with low (BOT-CA-R) and high (BOT-EMO) carbapenem MICs. The population diversity was assessed by the frequency of allele mutations and population analysis profiles (PAPs). Results: Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated clonal relatedness of the KPC-Kp isolates, all belonging to the clone ST1519. The D179Y mutation in blaKPC-3 was detected in both of the ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant KPCKp, whereas it was absent in the ceftazidime/avibactam-susceptible isolate. The mutation emerged independently in the two ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant isolates and was associated with a significant reduction in carbapenem MICs in BOT-CA-R, but not in BOT-EMO. WGS analysis revealed that the frequency of the D179Y mutation was 96.32% and 51.05% in BOT-CA-R and BOT-EMO, respectively. PAP results demonstrated that carbapenem resistance in BOT-EMO was due to the coexistence of mixed subpopulations harbouring WT and mutated blaKPC-3. A bacterial subpopulation with high ceftazidime/avibactam resistance for BOT-EMO KPC-Kp showed low carbapenem MICs, whereas a subpopulation with highmeropenem resistance had a low MIC of ceftazidime/ avibactam. Conclusions: Our analysis indicates that mixed subpopulations of ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant KPC-Kp emerge after ceftazidime/avibactam treatment. The evolution of different subpopulations that are highly resistant to ceftazidime/avibactam likely contributes to treatment failure, thereby highlighting the need for combination treatment strategies to limit selection of ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant KPC-Kp subpopulations. © The Author(s) 2018.

abstract={Taurine (TAU) is a sulfur-containing beta amino acid that is not involved in protein composition and anabolism, conditionally essential in mammals provided through diet. Growing evidence supports a protective role of TAU supply in osmoregulation, calcium flux, and reduction of inflammation and oxidant damage in renal diseases like diabetes. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, due to abnormal proteostasis, is a contributor to nephrotic syndrome and related renal damage. Here, we investigated the effect of dietary TAU (1.5% in drinking water for 15 days) in an established rat model that mimics human minimal change nephrosis, consisting of a single puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) injection (intraperitoneally 15 mg/100 g body weight), with sacrifice after eight days. TAU limited proteinuria and podocytes foot processes effacement, and balanced slit diaphragm nephrin and glomerular claudin 1 expressions. In cortical proximal tubules, TAU improved lysosomal density, ER perimeter, restored proper ER-mitochondria tethering and mitochondrial cristae, and decreased inflammation. Remarkably, TAU downregulated glomerular ER stress markers (GRP78, GRP94), pro-apoptotic C/EBP homologous protein, activated caspase 3, tubular caspase1, and mitochondrial chaperone GRP75, but maintained anti-apoptotic HSP25. In conclusion, TAU, by targeting upstream ER stress separate from mitochondria dysfunctions at crucial renal sites, might be a promising dietary supplement in the treatment of the drug-resistant nephrotic syndrome. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={Fungi have a crucial role in the correct maturation of salami, but special attention should be addressed to the production of the nephrotoxic, immunotoxic, and carcinogenic mycotoxin ochratoxin A (OTA). In a monitoring study conducted in Northern Italy, OTA was detected by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry in 13 out 133 samples of traditional salami (9.8% of the total count). Mycological analysis of these samples yielded 247 fungal isolates which were identified to species level. The most frequent species were Penicillium nalgiovense, P. solitum, and P. chrysogenum. P. nordicum, an OTA-producing species commonly found in proteinaceous food, was not found in these samples. Three isolates were found to be Aspergillus westerdijkiae, an OTA-producing species. In order to check the results of the microbiological identification, 19 different strains of Aspergillus and 94 of Penicillium were tested for the presence of a sequence common to OTA-producing fungi by real-time PCR. None of the studied isolates, including the three A. westerdijkiae, possessed the otanpsPN target which is common to OTA-producing strains. Two out of three isolates of the A. westerdijkiae were also PCR-negative for the otanpsPN gene and did not produce OTA in culture. Conversely, this target sequence was amplified from the DNA purified from 14 salami casings including three casings harboring A. westerdijkiae.

abstract={We tested cadmium (Cd2+) effects on porcine IPEC-J2 cells, which represent an in vitro model of the interaction between intestinal cells and both infectious and non-infectious stressors. Accordingly, we investigated the effects of low (2 μM) to moderate (20 μM) concentrations of Cd2+, in terms of pro-inflammatory gene expression and protein release, as well as of infectivity in a Salmonella typhimurium penetration model. Our data showed a significant (P <.001) increase of intracellular Cd2+ after 3, 6 and 24 h of exposure with respect to levels at 1 h. These data showed the ability of IPEC-J2 to absorb Cd2+ as a function of both time and concentration. Also, the absorption of this heavy metal was related to a significant modulation of important pro-inflammatory messengers. In particular, down-regulation of IL-8 was associated with a significant decrease of Salmonella typhimurium ability to penetrate into IPEC-J2 cells, in agreement with a previous study in which an anti-IL 8 antibody could significantly inhibit Salmonella penetration into the same cells (Razzuoli et al., 2017). This finding demonstrates the ability of Cd2+ to affect the outcome of an important host-pathogen relationship. In conclusion, our study highlighted the ability of an environmental pollutant like Cd2+ to modulate innate immune responses in terms of chemokine release and gene expression, and susceptibility to microbial infections. © 2018},

abstract={Monitoring of small ruminants for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) has recently become more relevant after two natural scrapie suspected cases of goats were found to be positive for classical BSE (C-BSE). C-BSE probably established itself in this species unrecognized, undermining disease control measures. This opens the possibility that TSEs in goats may remain an animal source for human prion diseases. Currently, there are no data regarding the natural presence of the atypical BSE in caprines. Here we report that C-BSE and L-type atypical BSE (L-BSE) isolates from bovine species are intracerebrally transmissible to goats, with a 100% attack rate and a significantly shorter incubation period and survival time after C-BSE than after L-BSE experimental infection, suggesting a lower species barrier for classical agentin goat. All animals showed nearly the same clinical features of disease characterized by skin lesions, including broken hair and alopecia, and abnormal mental status. Histology and immunohistochemistry showed several differences between C-BSE and L-BSE infection, allowing discrimination between the two different strains. The lymphoreticular involvement we observed in the C-BSE positive goats argues in favour of a peripheral distribution of PrPSc similar to classical scrapie. Western blot and other currently approved screening tests detected both strains in the goats and were able to classify negative control animals. These data demonstrate that active surveillance of small ruminants, as applied to fallen stock and/or healthy slaughter populations in European countries, is able to correctly identify and classify classical and L-BSE and ultimately protect public health. © 2018 Vallino Costassa et al.

abstract={Brown rot, caused by Monilinia spp., is a major disease of stone fruit and, in favorable environmental conditions and in the absence of fungicide treatments, it causes important economic losses. In the present work, we propose a modification of classical susceptible, exposed, infectious and removed compartmental models to grasp the peculiarities of the progression of brown rot epidemics in stone fruit orchards in the last stage of the fruit growth (i.e., from the end of the pit hardening to harvest time). Namely, we took into account (i) the lifespan of airborne spores; (ii) the dependence of the latent period on the cuticle crack surface area, which itself varies in time with fruit growth; (iii) the impossibility of recovery in infectious fruit; and (iv) the abrupt interruption of disease development by the elimination of the host fruit at harvest time. We parametrized the model by using field data from a peach Prunus persica orchard infected by Monilinia laxa and M. fructicola in Avignon (southern France). The basic reproduction number indicates that the environmental conditions met in the field were extremely favorable to disease development and the model closely fitted the temporal evolution of the fruit abundance in the different epidemiological compartments. The model permits us to highlight crucial mechanisms undergoing brown rot build up and to evaluate the consequences of different agricultural practices on the quantity and quality of the yield. We found that winter sanitation practices (which decrease the initial infection incidence) and the control of the fruit load (which affects the host fruit density and the single fruit growth trajectory) can be effective in controlling brown rot in conjunction with or in place of fungicide treatments. © 2018 The American Phytopathological Society.},

abstract={The effective control of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) requires sensitive, specific and rapid diagnostic tools. However, the control and eradication of FMD in Africa is complicated by, among other factors, the existence of five of the seven FMD virus (FMDV) serotypes, including the SAT-serotypes 1, 2 and 3 that are genetically and antigenically the most variable FMDV serotypes. A key diagnostic assay to enable a country to re-gain its FMD-free status and for FMD surveillance, is the 3ABC or the non-structural protein (NSP) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Although many kits are available to detect 3ABC antibodies, none has been developed specifically for the variable SAT serotypes. This study designed a SAT-specific NSP ELISA and determined whether this assay could better detect NSP-specific antibodies from FMDV SAT-infected livestock. The assay's performance was compared to validated NSP assays (PrioCheck®-NSP and IZSLER-NSP), using panels of field and experimental sera, vaccinated and/or infected with FMDV SAT1, SAT2 or SAT3. The sensitivity of the SAT-NSP was estimated as 76% (70%, 81%) whereas the specificity was 96% (95%, 98%) at a 95% confidence interval. The sensitivity and specificity were comparable to the commercial NSP assays, PrioCheck®-NSP (82% and 99%, respectively) and IZSLER-NSP (78% and 98%, respectively). Good correlations were observed for all three assays. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={During the past decade, African swine fever (ASF) has spread from the Caucasus region to eastern European Union countries affecting domestic pig and wild boar populations. In order to avert ASF spread, mitigation measures targeting both populations have been established. However, despite these efforts, ASF has been reported in thirteen different countries (Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Moldova, Czech Republic, and Romania). In the absence of an effective vaccine or treatment to ASF, introduction and spread of ASF onto domestic pig farms can only be prevented by strict compliance to control measures. This study systematically reviewed available measures to prevent the spread of ASF in the EU domestic pig sector distinguishing between commercial, non-commercial, and outdoor farms. The search was performed in PubMed and using a common browser. A total of 52 documents were selected for the final review process, which included scientific articles, reports, EU documents and official recommendations, among others. From this literature review, 37 measures were identified as preventive measures for the introduction and spread of ASF. Subsequently, these measures were assessed by ASF experts for their relevance in the mitigation of ASF spread on the three mentioned types of farms. All experts agreed that some of the important preventive measures for all three types of farms were: the identification of animals and farm records; strict enforcement of the ban on swill feeding; and containment of pigs, so as to not allow direct or indirect pig-pig and/or pig-wild boar contacts. Other important preventive measures for all farms were education of farmers, workers, and operators; no contact between farmers and farm staffand external pigs; appropriate removal of carcasses, slaughter residues, and food waste; proper disposal of manure and dead animals, and abstaining from hunting activities during the previous 48 h (allowing a 48 h interval between hunting and being in contact with domestic pigs). Finally, all experts identified that the important preventive measures for non-commercial and outdoor farms is to improve access of those farms to veterinarians and health services. © 2018 Jurado, Martínez-Avilés, De La Torre, Štukelj, de Carvalho Ferreira, Cerioli, Sánchez-Vizcaíno and Bellini.},

abstract={Paratuberculosis (or Johne's disease) is an infectious disease which affects mainly ruminants and it is caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). During a culling program (years 2011–2015) aimed at controlling the red deer (Cervus elaphus) population in Stelvio National Park (Italian Alps), where paratuberculosis was already described in this species, 382 tissue samples from the Lombardy Region and 102 fecal specimens from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano were analyzed by PCR. Of these, 77 samples (20.16%) from the Lombardy area and 19 specimens (18.63%) from the Bolzano area resulted PCR positive. The cultural test was carried out on PCR positive samples (n = 96), enabling the isolation of 19 MAP field strains which were genotyped using MIRU-VNTR typing and Short Sequence repeats (SSRs). Our results suggest that all isolates share an identical VNTR profile corresponding to the INMV1 genotype. The only variation was on the locus SSR2, but the utility of this last locus has already been questioned because of its instability. Overall, these data suggest a common clonal origin and host adaptation during the diffusion of paratuberculosis in this population.

abstract={Many production diseases of dairy cows are related to digestive troubles. The rumen subacute acidosis is the most relevant one, albeit not easily recognized. Recent studies suggest that forestomachs can perform regulatory actions at both regional and systemic levels, since forestomach walls express immune receptors and cytokines, and the rumen liquor is infiltrated by leukocytes. Therefore, the rumen fluid could be conveniently collected for investigating metabolic production diseases. Thus, we investigated the origin of the leukocytes of the rumen fluid and demonstrated that they partly derive from saliva. Next, we carried out a field survey of innate immunity in rumen fluids of 128 cows from 12 dairy farms, along with clinical inspections, assessment of milk yield, rumen pH, volatile fatty acids (VFA) and major inflammo-metabolic parameters. Significant statistical correlations were found between immune markers in rumen fluids and biochemical parameters. A significant negative correlation was found in rumen between CD45 gene expression (leukocyte infiltration) and pH level. B cells were the most frequent mononuclear leukocyte population in the rumen liquor and their infiltration was negatively affected by low ruminal pH and high concentrations of VFA. Moreover, total Ig and IgM in rumen fluids were negatively correlated with ruminal pH and positively correlated with uremia. Our data suggest that forestomach immune responses could be directed to “dangers” arising within the forestomach environment. The immune markers could integrate consolidated diagnostic parameters (e.g. rumen pH) and contribute to robust, early diagnosis of tricky digestive troubles of cattle. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Mortality caused by rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) in wild rabbits is reduced in parts of Australia where the related, non-pathogenic calicivirus RCV-A1 is endemic. Laboratory experiments previously showed that prior infection with RCV-A1 enabled rabbits to better withstand subsequent infection with highly virulent RHDV, and this was assumed to explain higher survival. Here, we analyse serological data from the field suggesting that reduced mortality rates among wild rabbits may also result from rabbits previously infected with RCV-A1 having a reduced likelihood of RHDV infection. We discuss the possible mechanisms underlying this finding and its implications. The methods we describe for analysing field data gave far greater insights into epidemiological processes and virus interactions than gained from reporting basic seroprevalence rates alone. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={The present case study concerns a case of predation of 4 individuals of captive pink flamingo in Emilia Romagna Region, Northeastern Italy. The pink flamingo (Phoenicopterus roseus) is a species included in the Red List of Threatened Species established by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) which lists species in danger of extinction. During the Winter of 2013, 4 flamingos (2 in the Comacchio area, and 2 from Argenta and Codigoro oases – Ferrara province) were found dead some of them headless, with their bodies severely bitten. At first, a fox (Vulpes vulpes) was suspected to be the predator responsible for the killing and the birds were taken to the laboratory for further investigations. The investigations included: field observations, study of the predator behaviour, necropsy examinations, assessment of the intercanine distance, and genetic analysis on the predator’s traces. The intercanine distance indicated that the predator could not have been a fox. The analysis of salivary DNA samples enabled us to establish that the predator was in fact a dog. This case highlights the importance of co-operation among the various branches of forensic sciences and the great usefulness of the roles filled by other veterinary forensic experts involved in solving crime. © 2018, Istituto Zooprofilattico dell'Abruzzo e del Molise.

abstract={Background and aim: Epidemiology of human nontyphoid salmonellosis is characterised by recurrent emergence of new clones of the pathogen over time. Some clonal lines of Salmonella have shaped epidemiology of the disease at global level, as happened for serotype Enteritidis or, more recently, for Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:-, a monophasic variant of serotype Typhimurium. The same clonal behaviour is recognisable at sub-serotype level where single outbreaks or more generalised epidemics are attributable to defined clones. The aim of this study was to understand the dynamics of a clone of Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:-over a 3-year period (2012–15) in a province of Northern Italy where the clone caused a large outbreak in 2013. Furthermore, the role of candidate outbreak sources was investigated and the accuracy of multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) was evaluated. Methods: we retrospectively investigated the outbreak through whole genome sequencing (WGS) and further monitored the outbreak clone for 2 years after its conclusion. Results: The study showed the transient nature of the clone in the population, possibly as a consequence of its occasional expansion in a food-processing facility. We demonstrated that important weaknesses characterise conventional typing methods applied to clonal pathogens such as Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:-, namely lack of accuracy for MLVA and inadequate resolution power for PFGE to be reliably used for clone tracking. Conclusions: The study provided evidence for the remarkable prevention potential of whole genome sequencing used as a routine tool in systems that integrate human, food and animal surveillance. © 2018, Eurosurveillance.

abstract={1. A 2 × 2 factorial experiment was conducted to compare the effects of wheat or maize based diets differing in dietary electrolyte balance (DEB) on litter moisture and foot pad dermatitis (FPD) at 4, 8 and 12 weeks of age in heavy-medium turkeys. A second objective was to investigate the effects on foot pad dermatitis of the interaction between dietary composition and artificially increasing litter moisture by adding water to the litter. 2. High DEB diets contained soya as the main protein source whereas low DEB diets did not contain soya bean meal. Diets were formulated to be iso-caloric and iso-nitrogenous in each of 3 successive 4-week phases following recommended dietary compositions. DEB concentrations were 330, 290 and 250 mEq/kg in high DEB diets and 230, 200 and 180 mEq/kg in low DEB diets. 3. Litter moisture and mean FPD score were higher in turkeys fed on high DEB diets compared with low DEB diets whereas there was no difference between maize and wheat. 4. Food intake was similar and body weight was lower after litter moisture was artificially raised in the wet compared with the dry litter treatment and there was no interaction with dietary composition. 5. Mean body weight and feed intake were higher in turkeys fed on wheat compared with maize and in high DEB compared with low DEB diets at 12 weeks of age. 6. Lowering dietary DEB for turkeys may improve litter moisture and lower the prevalence of FPD in commercial turkey flocks. © 2018 The Author(s).

abstract={Highly pathogenic (HP) PRRSV isolates have been discovered within both PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 genotypes and investigated in recent years especially for their ability to cause extremely severe disease in conventional pig herds. The exacerbation of general and respiratory clinical signs has been attributed not only to an efficient replication (virulence) but also to the ability to dysregulate viral recognition and induce mechanisms of immune evasion or immune enhancement of humoral and cellular anti-viral responses differently from non-HP PRRSV isolates in terms of intensity and temporal onset. Thus, the understanding of the immunopathogenesis of HP PRRSV is a major concern for the study of virus biology and development of efficacious vaccines. The present study aims at addressing the modulation of relevant immune cell subsets by flow cytometry in the blood of 4-week-old pigs experimentally infected with the recently discovered PR40/2014 HP PRRSV-1.1 strain phenotypically characterized in Canelli et al. (2017) compared to pigs infected with a non-HP PRRSV isolate (PR11/2014) and uninfected controls. PR40 infected animals showed an early and marked reduction of pro-inflammatory CD172α+ CD14+CD16+ and CD14+CD163+ monocytes and TCRγδ+CD8α+/CD8α- lymphocytes when pigs were most infected, possibly due to a recruitment sustaining an acute inflammatory response in target tissues. The prolonged increased CD3+CD16+ NKT cell levels may sustain peripheral inflammation and/or the anti-viral response. The late reduction (potential depletion) of γ/δ T lymphocytes and CD3+CD4+CD8α- naïve Th lymphocytes paralleled with the delayed increase of CD3+CD4+CD8α+ memory and CD3+CD4-CD8α/β + cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In addition, PR40 infection showed an early depletion of activated CD4+CD25+ T lymphocytes and Tregs together with an intense and lasting depletion of CD21+ B lymphocytes. Overall, these features demonstrate that the more severe clinical signs observed upon infection with the HP PR40 strain are sustained by remarkable changes in the peripheral blood distribution of immune cells and provide further insights into the immune regulation/immunopathogenesis induced by PRRSV-1 subtype 1 European isolates. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The complex life cycle of taeniids represents an ideal model of a multi-host system. The complexity of these parasites can therefore cover the epidemiological issues of the interface between wild and domestic animals, especially once spatial overlap between wild and domestic definitive and intermediate hosts occurs. Here we use the occurrence of Taenia ovis krabbei in two model areas as an example of this epidemiological complexity. In two contiguous areas in the Italian northern Apennines, two hunted roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) showed numerous cysticerci in the muscles of their whole body and an adult tapeworm was recorded in a semi-stray dog (Canis lupus familiaris). Through molecular typing of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (cox1) gene, cysticerci and the adult tapeworm of T. krabbei were identified. Taenia krabbei cysticercosis was recorded for the first time in Italy. Although the role of dogs in the parasite's life cycle emerges, the overlap between wild and domestic definitive hosts and the increase of wild population densities raise concerns about the temporal (old or new) introduction and the spread of this parasite by one of these canid species (wolf (Canis lupus) or dog). Although T. krabbei is not a public health issue, economic concerns emerged for hunters and meat producers, related to the damage of carcasses by cysticerci. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate the spread of T. krabbei in the intermediate and definitive host populations, and to ensure the relevant sanitary education for hunters in order to avoid practices that could favour the spread and maintenance of its life cycle. © Copyright Cambridge University Press 2017.},

abstract={Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus, strain CV777, was initially characterized in 1978 as the causative agent of a disease first identified in the UK in 1971. This coronavirus has been widely distributed among laboratories and has been passaged both within pigs and in cell culture. To determine the variability between different stocks of the PEDV strain CV777, sequencing of the full-length genome (ca. 28kb) has been performed in 6 different laboratories, using different protocols. Not surprisingly, each of the different full genome sequences were distinct from each other and from the reference sequence (Accession number AF353511) but they are >99% identical. Unique and shared differences between sequences were identified. The coding region for the surface-exposed spike protein showed the highest proportion of variability including both point mutations and small deletions. The predicted expression of the ORF3 gene product was more dramatically affected in three different variants of this virus through either loss of the initiation codon or gain of a premature termination codon. The genome of one isolate had a substantially rearranged 5´-terminal sequence. This rearrangement was validated through the analysis of sub-genomic mRNAs from infected cells. It is clearly important to know the features of the specific sample of CV777 being used for experimental studies. © 2018 Rasmussen et al.

abstract={African swine fever (ASF) is a devastating disease for which there is no vaccine. The ASF virus (ASFV) can infect dendritic cell (DC), but despite the critical role these cells play in induction of adaptive immunity, few studies investigated their response to ASFV infection. We characterized the in vitro interactions of porcine monocyte-derived DCs (moDC) with a virulent (22653/14), a low virulent (NH/P68) and an avirulent (BA71V) ASFV strain. At a high multiplicity of infection (MOI = 1), all three strains infected immature moDC. Maturation of moDC, with IFN-α/TNF-α, increased susceptibility to infection with 22653/14 and other virulent strains, but reduced susceptibility to NH/P68 and BA71V. The reduced moDC susceptibility to BA71V/NH/P68 was IFN-α mediated, whereas increased susceptibility to 22653/14 was induced by TNF-α. Using an MOI of 0.01, we observed that BA71V replicated less efficiently in moDC compared to the other isolates and we detected increased replication of NH/P68 compared to 22653/14. We observed that BA71V and NH/P68, but not 22653/14, downregulated expression of MHC class I on infected cells. All three strains decreased CD16 expression on moDC, whereas ASFV infection resulted in CD80/86 down-regulation and MHC class II DR up-regulation on mature moDC. None of the tested strains induced a strong cytokine response to ASFV and only modest IL-1α was released after BA71V infection. Overall our results revealed differences between strains and suggest that ASFV has evolved mechanisms to replicate covertly in inflammatory DC, which likely impairs the induction of an effective immune response. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={The prevalence and genetic diversity of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) in a geographic area are largely influenced by live animal trade and management practices. Despite control and eradication programs currently underway in several European countries, the risk of BVDV spread within and among countries is still present. BVDV-1 is the predominant type circulating in European cattle population. In this study, a phylogeographic analysis was applied to the BVDV-1 highest prevalent subtypes in Italy to reconstruct the origin and spatial-temporal distribution and to trace main viral flows between different locations to highlight priority areas for BVDV control. A comprehensive dataset of BVDV-1b (n = 173) and 1e (n = 172) 5′ UTR sequences was analysed, including both novel and published sequences from Italy and from European countries bordering and/or with commercial cattle flows with Italy. A common phylogeographic pattern was observed for BVDV-1b and 1e subtypes: interspersion from multiple Italian areas and European countries was widespread until the end of the last century, whereas significant local clusters were observed starting from 2000. These findings support a continuous viral flow among different areas over long time scales with no evidence of significant geographical structure, while local transmission networks are limited to more recent years. Northern Italy has been confirmed as the area of origin of the main clades of both BVDV subtypes at national level, acting both as a crucial area for introduction and a maintenance source for other areas. Piedmont, Central and Southern Italian regions contributed to limited geographical distribution and local BVDV-1b and 1e persistence. On the whole, priority control measures for BVDV-1b and 1e in Italy should be focused on: i) implementation of BVDV systematic control in all Northern Italian regions to break the viral flow from larger to smaller animal populations; and ii) breaking the dynamics of infections in regions with self-maintenance of BVDV by voluntary control programs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Rhabdoviridae is one of the most ecologically diverse families of RNA viruses which can infect a wide range of vertebrates and invertebrates. Bats, among mammals, are pointed to harbor a significantly higher proportion of unknown or emerging viruses with zoonotic potential. Herein, we report the isolation of a novel rhabdovirus, detected in the framework of a virological survey on bats implemented in North Italy. Methods: Virus isolation and identification were performed on samples of 635 bats by using cell cultures, negative staining electron microscopy and PCRs for different viruses. NGS was commonly performed on cell culture supernatants showing cytopathic effect or in case of samples resulted positive by at least one of the PCRs included in the diagnostic protocol. Results: A rhabdovirus was isolated from different organs of a Pipistrellus kuhlii. Virus identification was obtained by electron microscopy and NGS sequencing. The complete genome size was 11,774 nt comprised 5 genes, encoding the canonical rhabdovirus structural proteins, and an additional transcriptional unit (U1) encoding a hypothetical small protein (157aa) (3'-N-P-M-G-U1-L-5′). The genome organization and phylogenetic analysis suggest that the new virus, named Vaprio virus (VAPV), belongs to the recently established genus Ledantevirus (subgroup B) and it is highly divergent to its closest known relative, Le Dantec virus (LDV) (human, 1965 Senegal). A specific RT-PCR amplifying a 350 bp fragment of the ORF 6 gene, encoding for L protein, was developed and used to test retrospectively a subset of 76 bats coming from the same area and period, revealing two more VAPV positive bats. Conclusions: VAPV is a novel isolate of chiropteran rhabdovirus. Genome organization and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that VAPV should be considered a novel species within the genus Ledantevirus for which viral ecology and disease associations should be investigated. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: Different phleboviruses are important pathogens for humans; most of these viruses are transmitted by sand flies. An increasing number of new phleboviruses have been reported over the past decade, especially in Mediterranean countries, mainly via their detection in sand flies. Results: At least five different phleboviruses co-circulated in sand flies that were collected in three sites in Emilia-Romagna (Italy) in the summer of 2013. The well-known Toscana virus (TOSV) was isolated; three new, closely related phleboviruses differing in their M segments and tentatively named Ponticelli I, Ponticelli II and Ponticelli III virus, respectively, were isolated; a fifth putative phlebovirus, related to the sand fly fever Naples phlebovirus species, was also detected. The co-circulation, in a restricted area, of three viruses characterized by different M segments, likely resulted from reassortment events. According to the phylogenetic analysis of complete genome sequences, the TOSV belongs to clade A, together with other Italian isolates, while the Ponticelli viruses fall within the Salehabad phlebovirus species. Conclusions: Results highlight an unexpected diversity of phleboviruses that co-circulate in the same area, suggesting that interactions likely occur amongst them, that can present challenges for their correct identification. The co-circulation of different phleboviruses appears to be common, and the bionomics of sand fly populations seem to play a relevant role. Such a complex situation emphasizes the need for detailed investigations of the biology of these viruses to better characterize their pathogenic potential for mammals, including humans. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={An expert opinion elicitation, based on a modified Delphi technique, was organized to collect the opinion of 16 Italian veterinarians with the aim of conducting a hazard and a welfare promoter characterization for defining and weighing a list of management and housing factors potentially associated with negative or positive welfare outcomes in dairy cows kept in loose housing systems. In addition, the 16 experts judged a set of animal-based measures in order to rate them by appropriateness and by the level of animal pain and suffering due to the welfare consequences they measure. Veterinary experts were asked to score 52 hazards, 47 welfare promoters and 18 animal-based measures. Management and housing hazards, that were determined to be associated with a very high impact on the welfare of dairy cows, were mainly referred to lactating cows (absence of bedding material, presence of inadequate or slippery floor in walking areas, wrong design of the lying area), but also the use of harmful tools for animal handling and the lack of scheduled foot inspection, trimming and foot bathing reached very high impact scores. Management and housing welfare promoters dealing with optimal cow comfort around resting obtained the highest ratings, together with the presence of experienced and trained stockpersons, the implementation of an attentive animal grouping strategy and the control of temperature, humidity and ventilation. Considering animal-based measures, the highest ranking of importance was given to observation of lameness, records of mortality of adult cows and calves, observation of integument alterations and body condition scoring. This study has been the starting point for the development of the first Italian national protocol for the assessment of the welfare of dairy cows farmed in loose housing systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Introduction: The study investigated the effect of untreated cardiac arrest (CA), that is, "no-flow" time, on postresuscitation myocardial and neurological injury, and survival in a pig model to identify an optimal duration that adequately reflects the most frequent clinical scenario. Methods: An established model of myocardial infarction followed by CA and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was used. Twenty-two pigs were subjected to three no-flow durations: short (8-10 min), intermediate (12-13 min), and long (14-15 min). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was assessed together with thermodilution cardiac output (CO) and high sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT). Neurological impairment was evaluated by neurological scores, serum neuron specific enolase (NSE), and histopathology. Results: More than 60% of animals survived when the duration of CA was ≤13 min, compared to only 20% for a duration ≥14 min. Neuronal degeneration and neurological scores showed a trend toward a worse recovery for longer no-flow durations. No animals achieved a good neurological recovery for a no-flow ≥14 min, in comparison to a 56% for a duration ≤13 min (P = 0.043). Serum NSE levels significantly correlated with the no-flow duration (r = 0.892). Longer durations of CA were characterized by lower LVEF and CO compared to shorter durations (P < 0.05). The longer was the no-flow time, the higher was the number of defibrillations delivered (P = 0.043). The defibrillations delivered significantly correlated with LVEF and plasma hs-cTnT. Conclusions: Longer no-flow durations caused greater postresuscitation myocardial and neurological dysfunction and reduced survival. An untreated CA of 12-13 min may be an optimal choice for a clinically relevant model. © Copyright 2017 by the Shock Society.},

abstract={Incursion of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) into Sweden was documented in 1990 and it is now considered endemic in wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) populations. Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2), a new, related lagovirus was first detected in France in 2010, and has spread rapidly throughout Europe and beyond. However, knowledge of RHDV2 in northern Europe is sporadic and incomplete, and in Sweden, routinely available diagnostic methods to detect rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) do not distinguish between types of virus causing disease. Using RHDV2-specific RT-qPCR, sequencing of the VP60 gene and immunological virus typing of archived and prospective case material from the National Veterinary Institute's (SVA) wildlife disease surveillance programme and diagnostic pathology service, we describe the emergence of RHDV2 in Sweden in both wild and domestic rabbits. The earliest documented outbreak occurred on 22 May 2013, and from May 2013 to May 2016, 10 separate incidents of RHDV2 were documented from six different municipalities in the southern half of Sweden. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP60 gene shows clear clustering of Swedish isolates into three separate clusters within two different clades according to geographic location and time, suggesting viral evolution, multiple introduction events or both. Almost all cases of RHD examined by SVA from May 2013 to May 2016 were caused by RHDV2, suggesting that RHDV2 may be replacing RHDV as the predominant cause of RHD in Sweden. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={We conducted a cross-sectional study during 2013 to quantify the serological prevalence of peste des petits ruminants (PPR) infection and to investigate host factors associated with PPR infection in small ruminants in Libya. A two-stage sampling design was carried out. A total number of 148 flocks owning at least 100 heads each were randomly selected. Sixteen to forty-eight samples were collected from each selected flock. A total number of 3,508 serum samples from unvaccinated animals were collected and analysed at IZSLER Brescia, Italy, by using competitive ELISA, IDvet innovative diagnostics (IDvet 310, France). The overall serological prevalence among SR was 33% (95% CI: 31.4–34.5). Significant differences between the prevalence in the geographical branches were observed. The lowest prevalence level was observed in Zawiyah branch (16.1%), whereas the highest value was obtained for the Sabha branch (56.8%). Considering the age, a serological prevalence of 24.7%, 31.5% and 42.1% was observed in SR <1 year, between 1 and 2 years and more than 2 years, respectively. Statistically significant differences (p <.001) in the sero-prevalence levels were also observed between the age groups. Our findings suggest that the southern part of Libya could be more exposed to the infections coming from the neighbouring countries and this should be better investigated to correctly identify wherever specific entry points can be considered at higher risk than others. The results also confirmed the endemic status of PPR in Libya, with a constant exposure to the infection of the animals during their life. In the framework of the global strategy for control and eradication of PPR, our results, even if obtained by a preliminary study, can contribute to the assessment of the epidemiological situation of PPR in Libya as required by the Stage 1 of the plan. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Influenza A virus (IAV) infection in swine plays an important role in the ecology of influenza viruses. The emergence of new IAVs comes through different mechanisms, with the genetic reassortment of genes between influenza viruses, also originating from different species, being common. We performed a genetic analysis on 179 IAV isolates from humans (n. 75) and pigs (n. 104) collected in Northern Italy between 2010 and 2015, to monitor the genetic exchange between human and swine IAVs. No cases of human infection with swine strains were noticed, but direct infections of swine with H1N1pdm09 strains were detected. Moreover, we pointed out a continuous circulation of H1N1pdm09 strains in swine populations evidenced by the introduction of internal genes of this subtype. These events contribute to generating new viral variants—possibly endowed with pandemic potential—and emphasize the importance of continuous surveillance at both animal and human level. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={In Holstein Friesian dairy cows, selective pressure for increased milk production has led to a higher propensity to disease, including mastitis, when compared to less selected and lower producing dairy breeds. The biology underpinning the higher resistance to disease of such “local breeds” is not fully understood. With the aim of investigating the factors associated to this phenomenon, we applied a multidisciplinary approach to compare innate immune response patterns, metabolic parameters, milk protein profiles and the milk microbiota in Holstein Friesian and Rendena cows reared in the same farm and under the same management conditions. Quarter milk samples and blood plasma were collected from all cows at dry-off, 1 day after calving, 7–10 days after calving and 30 days after calving. Quarter milk samples were subjected to bacteriological culture, characterization of the milk microbiota by 16S metagenomics, milk protein profiling by electrophoresis and densitometry, somatic cell counting, measurement of the inflammation marker cathelicidin and assessment of different innate immune-related mediators such as lysozyme, CD45, IL-1β, TNF-α, PTX3, IL-1R8. In parallel, the main inflammometabolic parameters were measured in blood plasma samples. Despite having relatively few animals (6 moderate-yielding Holstein Friesian and 4 low-yielding Rendena) some important differences were apparent. Holstein Friesian cows showed a more severe fat mobilization and systemic inflammatory response postpartum in comparison with Rendena cows, which had a greater postpartum muscle mass and an increased amino acid mobilization compared to Holstein Friesians. Upon bacteriological analysis, contagious bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae were absent, but significant differences were seen in the general composition of the milk microbiota of the two breeds. Concerning the milk protein abundance profile, pronounced differences were seen in colostrum, with significantly higher amounts of immunoglobulins and other immune-related proteins in Rendena. Added to this, the expression of innate immune related genes such as PTX-3, IL-1β, TNF-α, and KRT5 expression in milk epithelial and leukocyte cell components, respectively, was lower in Holstein Friesian colostrum compared with Rendena. In conclusion, several differences were observed in the two breeds, in spite of the same farming conditions. The observations reported in this work present numerous pointers to the factors that may provide autochthonous, more rustic breeds with a higher resistance to disease. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A closer monitoring of tropane alkaloids (TA) in foods is now recommended by the European Commission, following a series of alerts related to the contamination of buckwheat with weeds of the genus Datura. A novel, accurate UHPLC–MS/MS method was developed and validated for the rapid detection of scopolamine and atropine in buckwheat foods. A suitable extraction protocol was set up to maximize recoveries and detection limits in different raw, processed and baked foods. The method offers good performances in terms of sensitivity, accuracy and precision, with LOQs at 0.04 and 0.10 µg/kg. The established method is suitable for routine determination of trace levels of TA and was applied to 26 different buckwheat-derived organic foods, detecting TA in 3 samples (13.9–83.9 µg/kg for atropine and 5.7–10.4 µg/kg for scopolamine). Only in one case the level of contamination was relevant in terms of food safety. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background: Direct and indirect contact among animals and holdings are important in the spread of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of slaughterhouse vehicles in spreading B. hyodysenteriae between unconnected farms. Results: Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and Multiple Locus Variable number tandem repeat Analysis (MLVA) were used to characterize B. hyodysenteriae strains isolated from trucks. Before cleaning, 976 batches of finishing pigs transported by 174 trucks from 540 herds were sampled. After cleaning, 763 of the 976 batches were also sampled. Sixty-one of 976 and 4 of 763 environmental swabs collected from trucks before and after cleaning and disinfection operations, respectively, were positive for B. hyodysenteriae. The 65 isolates in this study originated from 48 farms. Trucks were classified into five categories based on the number of visited farms as follows: category 1: 1-5 farms, category 2: 6-10 farms, category 3: 11-15 farms, category 4: 16-20 farms, category 5: >21 farms. Although the largest number of vehicles examined belonged to category 1, the highest percentage of vehicles positive for B. hyodysenteriae was observed in categories 3, 4 and 5. Specifically, 90.9% of trucks belonging to category 5 were positive for B. hyodysenteriae, followed by categories 4 and 3 with 85.7% and 83.3%, respectively. The results of MLST and MLVA suggest that trucks transporting pigs from a high number of farms also play a critical role in spreading different B. hyodysenteriae genetic profiles. STVT 83-3, which seems to be the current dominant type in Italy, was identified in 56.25% of genotyped isolates. The genetic diversity of isolated strains from trucks was high, particularly, in truck categories 3, 4 and 5. This result confirmed that MLST and MLVA can support the study of epidemiological links between different B. hyodysenteriae farm strains. Conclusions: This study highlights the potential role of shipments in B. hyodysenteriae spread. Moreover, it emphasizes the importance of strict vehicle hygiene practices for biosecurity programmes. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={1. An experiment was conducted to compare 5 different methods for the evaluation of litter moisture. 2. For litter collection and assessment, 55 farms were selected, one shed from each farm was inspected and 9 points were identified within each shed. 3. For each device, used for the evaluation of litter moisture, mean and standard deviation of wetness measures per collection point were assessed. 4. The reliability and overall consistency between the 5 instruments used to measure wetness were high (α = 0.72). 5. Measurement of three out of the 9 collection points were sufficient to provide a reliable assessment of litter moisture throughout the shed. 6. Based on the direct correlation between litter moisture and footpad lesions, litter moisture measurement can be used as a resource based on-farm animal welfare indicator. 7. Among the 5 methods analysed, visual scoring is the most simple and practical, and therefore the best candidate to be used on-farm for animal welfare assessment. © 2017 British Poultry Science Ltd.},

abstract={Salmonella is the second cause of foodborne infection in humans in the USA and Europe. Pigs represent the second most important reservoir for the pathogen and the consumption of pork meat is a major risk factor for human salmonellosis. Here, we evaluated the virulence patterns of eleven Salmonella isolated from pigs (carcasses and faces) bred in intensive farms in the north of Italy. The two serotypes identified were S. Typhimurium and its monophasic variant 1,4,5,12:i:-. None of the isolates was an ESBL producer, as confirmed also by PCR. However, the presence of a multidrug resistant pattern was evident, with all the isolates being resistant to at least to five antimicrobial agents belonging to various classes. Moreover, six out of eleven isolates showed important resistance profiles, such as resistance against colistin and ciprofloxacin, with nine to twelve recorded resistances. The isolates were negative for the biofilm synthesis test, while four different virulotypes were characterized. All the isolates showed the presence of invA, hilA, stn, ssrA, sipC. One sample also harbored ssaR and spvC genes. One strain was positive for all the virulence genes tested and was resistant to 12 antimicrobial agents. The present study contributes new data to the surveillance program for antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, the presence of eleven highly virulent isolates poses concern for human health in relation to their diffusion in the environment. © E. Barilli et al.},

abstract={American foulbrood (AFB) is a severe bacterial brood disease of honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) caused by the spore-forming bacterium Paenibacillus larvae. Low-levels of P. larvae in honey bee colonies are very widespread and can be considered endemic, whereas AFB occurs in clinical form only when a certain level of spores is reached in the colony. We studied for the first time the relationship between the level of the wintry contamination by P. larvae in materials taken from the hive and the onset of the disease in the following spring. In ten apiaries, from 125 colonies without signs of AFB, samples of adult bees, honey from the brood chamber and hive debris were collected in winter and cultured to detect P. larvae spore levels. The colonies were then checked in spring, until the end of May, for AFB symptoms. The performance of tests based on bees, honey and hive debris was evaluated, with respect to the results of clinical examination, by determination and comparison of sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp) and positive predictive value (PPV) at different cut-off thresholds. Using the presence or absence of spores as a cut-off threshold, the examination of debris and bees showed a good Se (100%), while the Se of honey was limited (81.25%). At the same cut-off threshold, debris showed a greater Sp than that of bees (57.80% vs 7.34%). At increased cut-off thresholds, the Se was always higher for bee examination than for debris examination, whereas Sp and PPV were always higher for debris than for bees. The results showed that the levels of P. larvae spores in adult bees and, above all, in hive debris can be a useful tool for AFB risk assessment. The identification and proper management of the colonies with an increased risk of developing the disease is crucial for reducing the impact of AFB. © 2018, Department of Agricultural and Food Sciences.

abstract={The aim of our study was to investigate the infection epidemiology in dairy farms with recent history of Streptococcus agalactiae intramammary-infection with special reference to: farming conditions, prevalence of infected cows, susceptibility to antimicrobials and molecular characteristics of the involved strains. In 15 dairy farms of the Lodi's Province, resulted positive for S. agalactiae at the official tank bulk milk test in the last two years, 1794 individual composite milk samples were obtained (range 24-217) and selective bacteriological examination were performed. The results showed the presence of S. agalactiae in 13 herds, with a prevalence of infected cows ranging from 10.4 to 54.7%. The analysis of the milking and biosecurity checklists on farms highlight some critical factors correlating with the prevalence of infection, such as: insufficient udder preparation (R = 0.66), failure to perform post-dipping (R = 0.77), incorrect milking routine (R = 0.58), inappropriate washing and disinfection procedures of the milking machine (R = 0.61), the administration of the infected milk to the calves (R = 0.85), poor udder hygiene (R = 0.64), high counts of both somatic cells and UFC/mL of S. agalactiae in bulk tank milk (respectively R = 0.63 and R = 0.64). Results of the minimum inhibitory concentration on one strain for farm (n. 13) showed strains resistant to tetracycline (n. 5), erythromycin (n. 1) and pirlimycin (n. 1); all strains were sensitive to β-lactams tested. Results of RAPD-PCR on 55 strains (4 for each farm) showed a genetic variability between strains (6 different profiles), but also evidenced that in 11 herds out of 13, strains with the same genetic profile were spread (clonal diffusion), while in 2 herds, different strains were simultaneously present. Eighteen strains representative of the strains circulating in the investigated farms were all positive at PCR-RT for a specific species gene and for neuC and cpsL virulence genes factors. Our findings confirm the severity of infection by S. agalactiae and underline the need of constant monitoring of the correct and hygienic procedures of milking, the animal management and bulk tank milk analysis. © 2018 Massimo Morgante.

abstract={Over the last few years a considerable spread of ethnic foods was observed in Italy. Among them is the Doner kebab. During 2014-2015, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of traditional cooking process, raw product (defrosted), sliced cooked portions cut through electric knife and assembled sandwich were officially sampled in kebab houses and in a local industrial kebab producer in Reggio Emilia (a province in Italy). Microbiological researches for safety and hygienic microbiological indicators were carried out (research of Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli; enumeration mesophilic aerobic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria, sulfite-reducing bacteria growing under anaerobic conditions, yeasts and molds). Between the raw and the cooked product an average of 3 log reduction in mesophilic aerobic bacteria counts was observed. In two out of three kebab houses sampled, which were supplied by the same local industrial producer, the presence of L. monocytogenes was detected. During the official inspection carried out at the production plant a contamination of L. monocytogenes was assessed in both ambient and instruments. Furthermore, 3 lots of products were analyzed and all were found to be contaminated by L. monocytogenes (always above 100 CFU/g). In order to verify the capability of the traditional cooking process to reduce the risk of contamination at an acceptable level, a batch of naturally contaminated kebab (4.5 log CFU/g) was cooked and sliced simulating a day work activity in a kebab shop. The product was then sampled during preparation and enumeration of L. monocytogenes was obtained. After an hour of cooking, the residual contamination was 1.8 log CFU/g, after two hours and a half L. monocytogenes was no longer detectable in the product, but half an hour later it was again detectable in 25g. At the end of the experiment, the contamination grown up to the same level enumerated after an hour of cooking (1.8 log CFU/g). Considering the microbiological results, traditional cooking obtained a rate of −2.40 log CFU/gh -1 , a D=26 min that corresponds to a temperature of maximum 60°C (z=6). In conclusion, our experiment demonstrates the traditional kebab cooking process could not always guarantee a complete product decontamination. © P. Bonilauri et al.},

We document an adult female found dead with many lead shot in the digestive tract, mixed with the remains of a feral Pigeon Columba livia domestica and a European Starling Sturnus vulgaris. Concentrations in heart blood clot, liver, kidney and bone suggest that lead poisoning was not the ultimate cause of death. However, lead levels in the blood clot suggest that a small amount of lead may have been absorbed from the shot.

abstract={The Trypanosoma theileri group includes several trypanosome species hardly distinguishable due to the lack of discriminating morphological characters. Trypanosomes belonging to this group have been isolated from different bovine, ovine, and cervids in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Americas. The principal vectors of the T. theileri group are considered tabanid flies; however, T. melophagium is transmitted exclusively by sheep keds. In 2016, 128 sand flies out of 2,728 trapped in Valsamoggia municipality, Italy, were individually dissected and an unknown trypanosome strain, named TrPhp1, was isolated from a female of the sand fly Phlebotomus perfiliewi. Sequence analysis placed this trypanosome in the T. theileri group with very high homology to other trypanosomes detected in European cervids. This is the first report of the T. theileri group isolation from a sand fly, and the possible role of this insect group in the trypanosome transmission cycle is discussed. Within the T. theileri group, the phylogenetic analysis distinguished several lineages, which, unfortunately, do not correspond with their host specificity and their taxonomic status remains ambiguous. © 2018 Mattia Calzolari et al.},

abstract={This study presents a novel technique to inactivate coccidian oocysts in an aqueous solution. The technique consists of treating the contaminated liquid by using an atmospher- ic-pressure air dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma in contact with it. Many experiments in several operating conditions were performed. The discharge was supplied by sinusoidal and nanosecond-pulsed voltages with a constant average power of ~7 W in both cases. Biological effects due to the plasma were investigated by performing tests with increasing treatment time. A sudden ~40% drop in the number of survived oocysts was reached in 4 min and a two-fold reduction was detected after 12 min of exposure. No significant differences in the biocidal efficacy were detected between the AC-driven and the nanosecond-pulsed discharge. Chi-squared statistical analysis on the treated samples showed significant statistical difference (with a statistical significance P value parameter less than 0.01) and nonrandomness warranty of the results, opening interesting scenarios for fimire developments. © 2018 by Begell House, Inc.},

abstract={Migratory birds have an important role in transporting ticks and associated tick-borne pathogens over long distances. In this study, 2,793 migratory birds were captured by nets in a ringing station, located in northern Italy, and checked for the presence of ticks. Two-hundred and fifty-one ticks were identified as nymphs and larvae of Ixodes ricinus (Linnaeus, 1758) and they were PCR-screened for the presence of bacteria belonging to Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Rickettsia spp., Francisella tularensis and Coxiella burnetii. Four species of Borrelia (B. garinii, B. afzelii, B. valaisiana and B. lusitaniae) and three species of Rickettsia (R. monacensis, R. helvetica and Candidatus Rickettsia mendelii) were detected in 74 (30%) and 25 (10%) respectively out of 251 ticks examined. Co-infection with Borrelia spp. and Rickettsia spp. in the same tick sample was encountered in 7 (7%) out of the 99 infected ticks. We report for the first time the presence of Candidatus Rickettsia mendelii in I. ricinus collected on birds in Italy. This study, besides confirming the role of birds in dispersal of I. ricinus, highlights an important route by which tick-borne pathogens might spread across different countries and from natural environments towards urbanised areas. © 2018, Czech Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={Nonstructural protein 2B of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus (FMDV) is comprised of a small, hydrophobic, 154-amino-acid protein. Structure-function analyses demonstrated that FMDV 2B is an ion channel-forming protein. Infrared spectroscopy measurements using partially overlapping peptides that spanned regions between amino acids 28 and 147 demonstrated the adoption of helical conformations in two putative transmembrane regions between residues 60 and 78 and between residues 119 and 147 and a third transmembrane region between residues 79 and 106, adopting a mainly extended structure. Using synthetic peptides, ion channel activity measurements in planar lipid bilayers and imaging of single giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) revealed the existence of two sequences endowed with membrane-porating activity: one spanning FMDV 2B residues 55 to 82 and the other spanning the C-terminal region of 2B from residues 99 to 147. Mapping the latter sequence identified residues 119 to 147 as being responsible for the activity. Experiments to assess the degree of insertion of the synthetic peptides in bilayers and the inclination angle adopted by each peptide regarding the membrane plane normal confirm that residues 55 to 82 and 119 to 147 of 2B actively insert as transmembrane helices. Using reverse genetics, a panel of 13 FMD recombinant mutant viruses was designed, which harbored nonconservative as well as alanine substitutions in critical amino acid residues in the area between amino acid residues 28 and 147. Alterations to any of these structures interfered with pore channel activity and the capacity of the protein to permeabilize the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to calcium and were lethal for virus replication. Thus, FMDV 2B emerges as the first member of the viroporin family containing two distinct pore domains. Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={As reported on RASFF's portal, in the first 9 months of 2016, a total of 13 “alerts/information for attention” were issued concerning the presence of Listeria monocytogenes in mould cheeses throughout Europe. This study analyzes the behaviour of L. monocytogenes in Gorgonzola cheese, a typical Italian soft blue-veined cheese, when contaminated at different time points. In the first challenge test, the pasteurized milk was contaminated and the complete cheese manufacture (cheesemaking, ripening) and shelf life was simulated. After a decrease during the first days of the cheesemaking, the pH remained constant for 35 days (5 weeks) and then it increased rapidly reaching the final values of 6.8 ± 0.02 in the core and 5.8 ± 0.4 on the rind. At the same time, the pathogen concentration decreased (about 2 log CFU/g), although during the last week a rapid pathogen growth was observed after the rise in pH values. When the cheese was stored at thermal abuse condition (8–12 °C), the pathogen concentration on the rind was 4.8 ± 0.3 log CFU/g and after 66 days (about 9 weeks) no significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) was observed; whereas, a growth from 5.4 ± 0.4 to 7.1 ± 0.5 log CFU/g was observed in the core. A second challenge test was performed using three batches of commercial slices of Gorgonzola cheese inoculated by L. monocytogenes and stored at 8 °C. The maximum specific growth rates (μ max , 1/h) of L. monocytogenes estimated ranged from 0.007 to 0.061. The square root model was used to predict the μ max at others temperature and to establish the time necessary to reach the European critical legal limit of 2 log CFU/g, in different storage scenarios. The predictions obtained in this study can be applied to any time-temperature profile, and in particular to the conditions to which the product is most likely to be subject in normal use, up to its final consumption. This study can be considered a valuable contribution also aimed at supporting the monitoring surveys carried out by officers of the Regional Veterinary Authority. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The inactivation of Salmonella during curing of Italian traditional pork salami was investigated. A total of 150 batches of ground raw meat (GRM) used for salami manufacturing by four producers were tested for Salmonella by real-time PCR followed by ISO 6579 cultural confirmation and MPN enumeration. Salami produced with Salmonella positive GRMs were re-tested at the end of their curing period. Aw, pH and NaCl content were also measured. Detection of Salmonella was performed testing both 25 and 50 g of the samples. By Real-Time PCR 37% of the GRMs resulted positive, but cultural detection of Salmonella was obtained in 14% of the samples only. Salmonella enumeration ranged from 31 MPN/g to < 1.3 MPN/g. The difference between testing 50 g and 25 g of the samples was statistically significant (p value ≤ 0.01). In particular, ISO-50 g detected Salmonella in 100% of all positive samples, vs. 62% of ISO-25 g. Salami made of the contaminated GRMs were 29% Salmonella-positive, as most batches of salami produced with Salmonella-positive GRMs resulted negative after regular curing (20–48 days). Overall, 13% of salami produced with Salmonella-contaminated GRMs were positive. They belonged to six batches, which turned out negative after prolonged curing ranging between 49 and 86 days. Salmonella enumeration in salami ranged from 8.7 MPN/g to < 1.3 MPN/g. Unlike GRMs, no significant difference was observed between the ISO-50 g and the ISO-25 g in detecting Salmonella in cured salami (p value: > 0.05). The most common Salmonella serovars in GRMs were Derby (52%), Typhimurium monophasic variant 4, (Barbuti et al., 1993), 12:i:- (19%) and Stanley (10%). Salmonella Derby (56%), London, Branderup, Panama (13%, respectively) and Goldcoast (6%) were most frequent in cured salami. The study showed negative correlation between real-time CT values and cultural confirmation of Salmonella, as well as the importance of sample size for Salmonella detection. Among considered factors with possible effect on the occurrence of Salmonella in salami, statistical analysis revealed a role for aw in salami and for Salmonella load in GRMs, while pH and NaCl content did not significantly affect the probability of finding Salmonella in dry-cured salami in the context of this study. In particular the lower aw values due to longer curing were associated with lower Salmonella presence in traditional dry-cured salami. © 2017},

abstract={Objective To investigate some pathogenic characters of Salmonella enterica strains isolated from poultry. Methods Twenty-three genetically distinct Salmonella enterica strains, of different serovars and pulsotype, were examined for virulence traits. Resistance to gastric acid environment was estimated by measuring the percentage of survived bacterial cells after exposure for 2 h to a synthetic gastric juice. Strains were analyzed with PCR for the presence of the following virulence genes: mgtC and rhuM located on SPI-3, sopB and pipB located on SPI-5, Salmonella virulence plasmid (spv) R (spvR), spvB and spvC located on Salmonella plasmid virulence and sodCI, sopE, and gipA located on prophage. Finally, resistance to 21 antibiotics was tested with Kirby–Bauer method. Results A percentage of 82.60% of strains were resistant to gastric environment after induction and 60.87% of the strains exhibited constitutive resistance too. Nineteen different virulence profiles were detected. The phage related genes sodCI and sopE and the plasmid mediated operon spvR, spvB and spvC (spvRBC) were detected in 82.60%, 47.82% and 52.17% of strains, respectively. Typhimurium and Enteritidis strains showed the highest number of virulence genes. Twenty-one different antibiotic resistance profiles were obtained and two isolates (Typhimurium and Enteritidis) resulted sensible to all the tested molecules. The ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamide and tetracycline resistance profile was detected in seven isolates (30.43%). Conclusion Our results show that paratyphoid Salmonella strains with several characters of pathogenicity, that may be cause of severe pathology in animals and humans, are circulating among poultry. © 2017 Hainan Medical University},

abstract={Infectious diseases in livestock can be transmitted through fomites: objects able to convey infectious agents. Between-farm spread of infections through fomites is mostly due to indirect contacts generated by on-farm visits of personnel that can carry pathogens on their clothes, equipment, or vehicles. However, data on farm visitors are often difficult to obtain because of the heterogeneity of their nature and privacy issues. Thus, models simulating disease spread between farms usually rely on strong assumptions about the contribution of indirect contacts on infection spread. By using data on veterinarian on-farm visits in a dairy farm system, we built a simple simulation model to assess the role of indirect contacts on epidemic dynamics compared to cattle movements (i.e. direct contacts). We showed that including in the simulation model only specific subsets of the information available on indirect contacts could lead to outputs widely different from those obtained with the full-information model. Then, we provided a simple preferential attachment algorithm based on the probability to observe consecutive on-farm visits from the same operator that allows overcoming the information gaps. Our results suggest the importance of detailed data and a deeper understanding of visit dynamics for the prevention and control of livestock diseases. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={The incidence of pesticides in poisoned baits recovered from 2005 to 2014 in Italian northern regions of Emilia Romagna and Lombardy was analysed. A total of 956 baits tested positive for pesticides during the study period. In 9.3% (n = 89) of the baits analysed more than one toxic compound was present. Insecticides (53.2%) proved to be the pesticides most commonly involved followed by rodenticides (34.3%), molluscicides (12.3%) and herbicides (0.2%). Among insecticides, the anticholinesterases (organophosphates and carbamates) were the most frequently detected (59.1%, n = 412) followed by organochlorines (39.8%; n = 277). Anticoagulants proved to be the rodenticides most commonly involved (78.5%; n = 353) with many baits containing brodifacoum or bromadiolone, while metaldehyde was the most used molluscicide (88.2%; n = 142). A high number of baits contained banned pesticides such as endosulfan, methamidophos, carbofuran and strychnine indicating that the restrictions and the bans on the use of toxic and highly toxic pesticides are not accompanied by a lower use in poisoned baits. The high incidence of banned pesticides detected in the present survey is extremely worrying and poses the question of where and how these compounds were obtained. Efforts have to be made to reduce this illegal practice and its environmental impact. Moreover, education and awareness campaigns should be instituted. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Influenza D virus (IDV), a new member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, was first reported in 2011 in swine in Oklahoma, and consequently found in cattle across North America and Eurasia. To investigate the circulation of IDV among pigs in Italy, in the period between June 2015 and May 2016, biomolecular and virological tests were performed on 845 clinical samples collected from 448 pig farms affected by respiratory distress located in the Po Valley. Serological tests were conducted on 3698 swine sera, including archive sera collected in 2009, as well as samples collected in 2015 from the same region. Viral genome was detected in 21 (2.3%) samples from 9 herds (2%), while virus was successfully isolated from 3 samples. Genetic analysis highlighted that Italian swine IDVs are closely related to the D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 cluster. Sera collected in 2015 showed a high prevalence of IDV antibody titers (11.7%), while archive sera from 2009 showed statistically significant lower positivity rates (0.6%). Our results indicate an increasing epidemiological relevance of the pathogen and the need for in-depth investigations towards understanding its pathogenesis, epidemiology and possible zoonotic potential of this emerging virus. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis: (MAP) causes a contagious chronic infection results in Johne’s disease in a wide range of animal species, including cattle. Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been carried out to identify loci putatively associated with MAP susceptibility by testing each marker separately and identifying SNPs that show a significant association with the phenotype, while SNP with modest effects are usually ignored. The objective of this study was to identify modest-effect genes associated with MAP susceptibility using a pathway-based approach. The Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip was used to genotype 966 Holstein cows, 483 positive and 483 negative for antibody response to MAP, data were then analyzed using novel SNP-based Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA–SNP) and validated with Adaptive Rank Truncated Product methodology. An allele-based test was carried out to estimate the statistical association for each marker with the phenotype, subsequently SNPs were mapped to the closest genes, considering for each gene the single variant with the highest value within a window of 50 kb, then pathway-statistics were tested using the GSEA–SNP method. The GO biological process “embryogenesis and morphogenesis” was most highly associated with antibody response to MAP. Within this pathway, five genes code for proteins which play a role in the immune defense relevant to response to bacterial infection. The immune response genes identified would not have been considered using a standard GWAS, thus demonstrating that the pathway approach can extend the interpretation of genome-wide association analyses and identify additional candidate genes for target traits. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is a lagovirus that can cause fatal hepatitis (rabbit haemorrhagic disease, RHD) with mortality of 80–90% in farmed and wild rabbits. Since 1986, RHDV has caused outbreaks in rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in Europe, but never in European brown hares (Lepus europaeus, EBH). In 2010, a new RHDV-related virus, called RHDV2, emerged in Europe, causing extended epidemics because it largely overcame the immunity to RHDV present in most rabbit populations. RHDV2 also was identified in Cape hare (Lepus capensis subsp. mediterraneus) and in Italian hare (Lepus corsicanus). Here, we describe two distinct incidents of RHDV2 infection in EBH that occurred in Italy (2012) and Spain (2014). The two RHDV2 strains caused macroscopic and microscopic lesions similar to European brown hare syndrome (EBHS) in hares, and they were genetically related to other RHDV2 strains in Europe. EBHs are common in Europe, often sharing habitat with rabbits. They likely have been exposed to high levels of RHDV2 during outbreaks in rabbits in recent years, yet only two incidents of RHDV2 in EBHs have been found in Italy and Spain, suggesting that EBHs are not a primary host. Instead, they may act as spillover hosts in situations when infection pressure is high and barriers between rabbits and hares are limited, resulting in occasional infections causing EBHS-like lesions. The serological survey of stocked hare sera taken from Italian and Spanish hare populations provided an understanding of naturally occurring RHDV2 infection in the field confirming its sporadic occurrence in EBH. Our findings increase the knowledge on distribution, host range and epidemiology of RHDV2. © 2016 The Authors. Transboundary and Emerging Diseases Published by Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={A molecular screening for tick-borne pathogens was carried out in engorged and in questing ticks collected in Verbano Cusio Ossola county, Piemonte region, Italy. Engorged ticks were removed from wild and domestic animal hosts. The most abundant and common tick species in the area was Ixodes ricinus (192 adults, 907 nymphs). Few individuals of Ixodes hexagonus (15) and Rhipicephalus sanguineus (7) were found among the ticks removed from domestic animals (46 examined ticks). The presence of Rickettsia spp., Borrelia burgdorferi sensu latu, Francisella tularensis and Coxiella burnetii was evaluated by PCR and sequencing in 392 individuals of I. ricinus (adult and nymphal stages) and 22 individuals of the two other tick species. Five Borrelia species (i.e. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii, B. afzelii, B. valaisiana and B. lusitaniae), proved or suspected to cause clinical manifestations of Lyme disease in humans, showed 10.5 and 2.2% combined prevalence in questing and engorged I. ricinus, respectively. In addition, two species of rickettsiae (R. helvetica and R. monacensis) were identified and reported with 14.5 and 24.8% overall prevalence in questing and in engorged ticks. The prevalence of F. tularensis in the ticks collected on two wild ungulate species (Capreolus capreolus and Cervus elaphus) was 5.7%.

abstract={The genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae includes some of the most important examples of emerging zoonotic arboviruses that are rapidly spreading across the globe. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV), St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) and Usutu virus (USUV) are mosquito-borne members of the JEV serological group. Although most infections in humans are asymptomatic or present with mild flu-like symptoms, clinical manifestations of JEV, WNV, SLEV, USUV and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) can include severe neurological disease and death. In horses, infection with WNV and JEV can lead to severe neurological disease and death, while USUV, SLEV and TBEV infections are mainly asymptomatic, however, and induce antibody responses. Horses often serve as sentinels to monitor active virus circulation in serological surveillance programmes specifically for WNV, USUV and JEV. Here, we developed and validated a NS1-antigen protein microarray for the serological differential diagnosis of flavivirus infections in horses using sera of experimentally and naturally infected symptomatic as well as asymptomatic horses. Using samples from experimentally infected horses, an IgG and IgM specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 95% for WNV and 100% for JEV was achieved with a cut-off titre of 1 : 20 based on ROC calculation. In field settings, the microarray identified 93–100% of IgG-positive horses with recent WNV infections and 87% of TBEV IgG-positive horses. WNV IgM sensitivity was 80%. Differentiation between closely related flaviviruses by the NS1-antigen protein microarray is possible, even though we identified some instances of cross-reactivity among antibodies. However, the assay is not able to differentiate between naturally infected horses and animals vaccinated with an inactivated WNV whole-virus vaccine. We showed that the NS1-microarray can potentially be used for diagnosing and distinguishing flavivirus infections in horses and for public health purposes within a surveillance setting. This allows for fast, cheap, syndrome-based laboratory testing for multiple viruses simultaneously for veterinary and public health purposes. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={In Europe, Trichinella spiralis, the most dangerous species for humans of the genus Trichinella, has a patchy distribution with important foci in Eastern countries and Spain. This zoonotic pathogen was apparently not circulating among wild and domestic animals of Italy. In 2016, muscle larvae belonging to this nematode species were detected in a red fox (Vulpes vulpes) shot in the Piacenza province (Northern Italy). This parasite may have been introduced into northern Italy from eastern Europe by hunters, by a hunting dog, or by immigrants, who illegally carried infected meat in their personal baggage. In the same year, T. spiralis infected sausages illegally introduced by personal baggage into Italy from Romania, were inadequately disposed of in the garbage of a central Italian town. Even though these two episodes may not be connected in time and space, they represent an increased risk of infection for domestic and wild swine, which are highly susceptible to this pathogen. In these animals, T. spiralis shows a higher larval burden and a longer survival time than other Trichinella species. Since most of the Italian pig production plants are in northern Italy, the circulation of T. spiralis should be strictly monitored in wildlife living in these areas. © 2017},

abstract={Since 2013 in Emilia-Romagna, Italy, surveillance information generated in the public health and in the animal health sectors has been shared and used to guide public health interventions to mitigate the risk of West Nile virus (WNV) transmission via blood transfusion. The objective of the current study was to identify and estimate the costs and benefits associated with this One Health surveillance approach, and to compare it to an approach that does not integrate animal health information in blood donations safety policy (uni-sectoral scenario). Costs of human, animal, and entomological surveillance, sharing of information, and triggered interventions were estimated. Benefits were quantified as the averted costs of potential human cases of WNV neuroinvasive disease associated to infected blood transfusion. In the 2009–2015 period, the One Health approach was estimated to represent a cost saving of €160,921 compared to the uni-sectoral scenario. Blood donation screening was the main cost for both scenarios. The One Health approach further allowed savings of €1.21 million in terms of avoided tests on blood units. Benefits of the One Health approach due to short-term costs of hospitalization and compensation for transfusion-associated disease potentially avoided, were estimated to range from €0 to €2.98 million according to the probability of developing WNV neuroinvasive disease after receiving an infected blood transfusion. © 2017 Paternoster et al.

abstract={Laminitis, a highly debilitating disease of the foot in ungulates, is characterized by pathological changes of the complex lamellar structures that maintain the appendicular skeleton within the hoof. Laminitis is a multifactorial disease that involves perturbation of the vascular, hematological, and inflammatory homeostasis of the foot. Interestingly, the pathogenesis of the disease resembles what is observed in metabolic syndromes and sepsis-induced organ failure in humans and animals. We hypothesized that local administration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) might contribute to establishing an anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic environment, and could stimulate the injured tissue in order to restore its functional integrity. According to this assumption, an experimental protocol based on the local intravenous administration of adipose tissue-derived MSCs (aMSCs) in combination with PRP was developed for the treatment of horses affected by chronic laminitis. Nine horses with severely compromised venograms (showing grade III and IV laminitis) that had been unsuccessfully treated with conventional therapies were enrolled. aMSCs and PRP (15 × 106 cells resuspended in 15 mL of PRP) were injected into the lateral or medial digital vein three times, at one-month intervals. The first administration was performed with allogeneic aMSCs, while for the following administrations, autologous aMSCs were used. There was no adverse short-term reaction to the intravenous injection of aMSCs. In the long term, venograms outlined, in all subjects, a progressive amelioration of the vascularization of the foot. An improvement in the structure and function of the hoof was also observed. No adverse events were reported during the follow-up, and the horses returned to a comfortable quality of life. Although the number of animals enrolled in the study is limited, both clinical observations and venography demonstrated an enhancement in the condition of all horses, suggesting that the regenerative therapies in chronic laminitis could be useful, and are worthy of further investigation. © 2017 by the authors.

abstract={Highly pathogenic (HP) isolates of the PRRS virus started emerging in North America and Asia in the late 1990s. More recently, they have emerged in Europe. These isolates are characterized by high viral loads, severe general clinical signs and high mortality, in sows or in weaners and growers. Their genome shows a discontinuous aminoacids deletion in the non-structural protein 2 (NSP2). The present study was aimed at characterizing the clinical, pathological and immunological features of a highly pathogenetic, Italian PRRSV-1 subtype 1 isolate (PRRSV1_PR40/2014), following experimental infection in conventional 4 weeks-old pigs. The PRRSV1_PR40/2014 infected group showed severe clinical signs (high fever and dispnoea). Pathological lesions, including severe lymphocytopenia in bronchial lymph-nodes and thymus were also recorded. Higher serum PRRSV genome copies and lower virus neutralizing antibody titre were observed when compared to homologous virus. The genetic analysis of the strain, and the phenotypic features observed in the field and reproduced in the experimental study, confirmed the high pathogenicity of the Italian PRRSV-1 subtype 1 PR40 isolate. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Vero cell lines are extensively employed in viral vaccine manufacturing. Similarly to all established cells, mutations can occur during Vero cells in vitro amplification which can result in adverse features compromising their biological safety. To evaluate the potential neoplastic evolution of these cells, in vitro transformation test, gene expression analysis and karyotyping were compared among low- (127 and 139 passages) and high-passage (passage 194) cell lines, as well as transformed colonies (TCs). In vivo tumorigenicity was also tested to confirm preliminary in vitro data obtained for low passage lines and TCs. Moreover, Vero cells cultivated in foetal bovine serum-free medium and derived from TCs were analysed to investigate the influence of cultivation methods on tumorigenic evolution. Low-passage Vero developed TCs in soft agar, without showing any tumorigenic evolution when inoculated in the animal model. Karyotyping showed a hypo-diploid modal chromosome number and rearrangements with no difference among Vero cell line passages and TCs. These abnormalities were reported also in serum-free cultivated Vero. Gene expression revealed that high-passage Vero cells had several under-expressed and a few over-expressed genes compared to low-passage ones. Gene ontology revealed no significant enrichment of pathways related to oncogenic risk. These findings suggest that in vitro high passage, and not culture conditions, induces Vero transformation correlated to karyotype and gene expression alterations. These data, together with previous investigations reporting tumour induction in high-passage Vero cells, suggest the use of low-passage Vero cells or cell lines other than Vero to increase the safety of vaccine manufacturing. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={We investigate the time-optimal control problem in SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) epidemic models, focusing on different control policies: vaccination, isolation, culling, and reduction of transmission. Applying the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP) to the unconstrained control problems (i.e. without costs of control or resource limitations), we prove that, for all the policies investigated, only bang–bang controls with at most one switch are admitted. When a switch occurs, the optimal strategy is to delay the control action some amount of time and then apply the control at the maximum rate for the remainder of the outbreak. This result is in contrast with previous findings on the unconstrained problems of minimizing the total infectious burden over an outbreak, where the optimal strategy is to use the maximal control for the entire epidemic. Then, the critical consequence of our results is that, in a wide range of epidemiological circumstances, it may be impossible to minimize the total infectious burden while minimizing the epidemic duration, and vice versa. Moreover, numerical simulations highlighted additional unexpected results, showing that the optimal control can be delayed also when the control reproduction number is lower than one and that the switching time from no control to maximum control can even occur after the peak of infection has been reached. Our results are especially important for livestock diseases where the minimization of outbreaks duration is a priority due to sanitary restrictions imposed to farms during ongoing epidemics, such as animal movements and export bans. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV), genus Flavivirus, are members of the Japanese encephalitis virus antigenic complex, and are maintained primarily in an enzootic cycle between mosquitoes and birds. WNV is zoonotic, and poses a threat to public health, especially in relation to blood transfusion. Serosurveillance of wild birds is suitable for early detection of WNV circulation, although concerns remain to be addressed as regards i) the type of test used, whether ELISA, virus neutralization test (VNT), plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), ii) the reagents (antigens, revealing antibodies), iii) the different bird species involved, and iv) potential cross-reactions with other Flaviviruses, such as USUV. The authors developed an indirect IgG ELISA with pan-avian specificity using EDIII protein as antigen and a monoclonal antibody (mAb 1A3) with broad reactivity for avian IgG. A total of 140 serum samples were collected from juvenile European magpies (Pica pica) in areas where both WNV and USUV were co-circulating. The samples were then tested using this in-house ELISA and VNT in parallel. Estimation of test accuracy was performed using different Bayesian two latent class models. At a cut-off set at an optical density percentage (OD%) of 15, the ELISA showed a posterior median of diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) of 88% (95%PCI: 73–99%) and a diagnostic specificity (DSp) of 86% (95%PCI: 68–99%). At this cut-off, ELISA and VNT (cut-off 1/10) performances were comparable: DSe = 91% (95%PCI: 79–99%), and DSp = 77% (95%PCI: 59–98%). With the cut-off increased to 30 OD%, the ELISA DSe dropped to 78% (95%PCI: 52–99%), and the DSp rose to 94% (95%PCI: 83–100%). In field conditions, the cut-off that yields the best accuracy for the ELISA appears to correspond to 15 OD%. In areas where other Flaviviruses are circulating, however, it might be appropriate to raise the cut-off to 30 OD% in order to achieve higher specificity and reduce the detection of seropositive birds infected by other Flaviviruses, such as USUV. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={An increase in autochthonous hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections has been recorded in Italy suspected to be zoonotically transmitted from pigs; this study was carried out to determinate the seroprevalence and risk factors associated with hepatitis HEV exposition, both in swine and humans working in pig farms, located within a high-density pig farming area in Piedmont region, north-western Italy. The presence of viral RNA in human and swine samples was also evaluated, and phylogenetic analysis was performed on HEV-positive samples. Forty-two swine farms were sampled; 142 workers were enrolled in the study and classified into two groups: (i) 69 workers with occupational contact with swine (including veterinarians and farmers) recruited in the 42 sampled farms; (ii) 73 without occupational contact with swine. Forty-one of 42 (97%) swine farms resulted positive to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test for HEV antibodies (Abs). Overall seroprevalence in swine was 50% (441/879), with seropositivity rate higher in sows (333/469, 71%). HEV RNA in stool samples was detected in animals from 13 of 42 tested farms (31%), and a higher positivity resulted in weaners (40/246, 16.3%). Phylogenetic analysis classified all HEV isolates within genotype 3 (subtypes 3f, 3e, 3c). All humans were negative for HEV viral genome in blood. Five of 142 sera were positive for IgG anti-HEV with an overall prevalence of 3.52% with no statistically significant differences in prevalence rates between workers at zoonotic risk and the control group (5.7% versus 1.3%). In contrast, a significant difference (OR 10.1) was observed within the subgroup including subjects exposed for short periods (veterinarians) compared with those who worked for long periods (farmers) suggesting a correlation between the time of exposure and the likelihood of HEV infection. Reporting HEV infection is not mandatory in Italy, but a constant epidemiological surveillance should be ensured to clarify the epidemiology of this disease. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={The eradication of tuberculosis, brucellosis and leucosis in cattle has not yet been achieved in the entire Italian territory. The region of Lazio, Central Italy, represents an interesting case study to evaluate the evolution of costs for these eradication programmes, as in some provinces the eradication has been officially achieved, in some others the prevalence has been close to zero for years, and in still others disease outbreaks have been continuously reported. The objectives of this study were i) to describe the costs for the eradication programmes for tuberculosis, brucellosis and leucosis in cattle carried out in Lazio between 2007 and 2011, ii) to calculate the ratio between the financial contribution of the European Union (EU) for the eradication programmes and the estimated total costs and iii) to estimate the potential savings that can be made when a province gains the certification of freedom from disease. For the i) and ii) objectives, data were collected from official sources and a costing procedure was applied from the perspective of the Regional Health Service. For the iii) objective, a Bayesian AR(1) regression was used to evaluate the average percentage reduction in costs for a province that gained the certification. The total cost for the eradication programmes adjusted for inflation to 1 January 2016 was estimated at 18 919 797 euro (5th and 95th percentiles of the distribution: 18 325 050–19 552 080 euro). When a province gained the certification of freedom from disease, costs decreased on average by (median of the posterior distribution) 47.5%, 54.5% and 54.9% for the eradication programmes of tuberculosis, brucellosis and leucosis, respectively. Information on possible savings from the reduction of control costs can help policy makers operating under budget constraints to justify the use of additional resources for the final phase of eradication. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={A strain of an achlorophyllic alga, named PR24T, was isolated from cow milk samples from the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Based on 18S rDNA, 28S rRNA, D1/D2 region of the LSU rDNA and SSU rRNA gene sequence similarities, this strain was found to be a member of the genus Prototheca and closely related to Prototheca blaschkeae SAG2064T. However, the novel strain could easily be distinguished from recognized Prototheca species by internal transcribed spacer, species-specific PCR, single-strand conformation polymorphism-PCR analysis and phenotypic characteristics. The inability to grow in Sabouraud broth at pH 4.0 and the different cellular fatty acid composition clearly distinguished PR24T from the reference strain of P. blaschkeae. The combination of genotypic and phenotypic data indicates that strain PR24T represents a subspecies of P. blaschkeae, for which the name Prototheca blaschkeae subsp. brasiliensis subsp. nov. is proposed. The respective type strain is PR24T (=DSM 103592T=IHEM 26958T). © 2017 IUMS.},

abstract={Background: Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis (S. Choleraesuis) infection causes a systemic disease in pigs. Vaccination could represent a solution to reduce prevalence in farms. In this study, we aimed to assess the efficacy of an attenuated strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium (increment)znuABC) against S. Choleraesuis infection. The vaccination protocol combined priming with attenuated S. Typhimurium (increment)znuABC vaccine and boost with an inactivated S. Choleraesuis vaccine and we compared the protection conferred to that induced by an inactivated S. Choleraesuis vaccine. Methods: The first group of piglets was orally vaccinated with S. Typhimurium (increment)znuABC and boosted with inactivated S. Choleraesuis, the second one was intramuscularly vaccinated with S. Choleraesuis inactivated vaccine and the third group of piglets was unvaccinated. All groups of animals were challenged with a virulent S. Choleraesuis strain at day 35 post vaccination. Results: The results showed that the vaccination protocol, priming with S. Typhimurium (increment)znuABC and boosted with inactivated S. Choleraesuis, applied to group A was able to limit weight loss, fever and organs colonization, arising from infection with virulent S. Choleraesuis, more effectively, than the prime-boost vaccination with homologous S. Choleraesuis inactivated vaccine (group B). Conclusion: In conclusion, these research findings extend the validity of attenuated S. Typhimurium (increment)znuABC strain as a useful mucosal vaccine against S. Typhimurium and S. Choleraesuis pig infection. The development of combined vaccination protocols can have a diffuse administration in field conditions because animals are generally infected with different concomitant serovars. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={West Nile virus (WNV) is endemic in the Po valley area, Northern Italy, and within the legal framework of the national plan for the surveillance of human vector-borne diseases, WNV surveillance has over time been implemented. The surveillance plans are based on the transdisciplinary and trans-sectorial collaboration between regional institutions involved in public, animal, and environmental health. This integrated surveillance targets mosquitoes, wild birds, humans, and horses and aims at early detecting the viral circulation and reducing the risk of infection in the human populations. The objective of our study was to assess the degree of One Health (OH) implementation (OH-ness) of the WNV surveillance system in three North Italian regions (Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy, Piedmont) in 2016, following the evaluation protocol developed by the Network for Evaluation of One Health (NEOH). In detail, we (i) described the OH initiative (drivers, outcomes) and its system (boundaries, aim, dimensions, actors, stakeholders) and (ii) scored different aspects of this initiative (i.e., OH-thinking, -planning, -sharing, -learning, transdisciplinarity and leadership), with values from 0 (=no OH approach) to 1 (=perfect OH approach). We obtained a mean score for each aspect evaluated. We reached high scores for OH thinking (0.90) and OH planning (0.89). Lower scores were attributed to OH sharing (0.83), transdisciplinarity and leadership (0.77), and OH learning (0.67), highlighting some critical issues related to communication and learning gaps. The strengths and weaknesses detected by the described quantitative evaluation will be investigated in detail by a qualitative evaluation (process evaluation), aiming to provide a basis for the development of shared recommendations to refine the initiative and conduct it in a more OH-oriented perspective. © 2017 Paternoster, Tomassone, Tamba, Chiari, Lavazza, Piazzi, Favretto, Balduzzi, Pautasso and Vogler.},

abstract={1. An experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of crude protein (CP) concentration and dietary electrolyte balance (DEB) on growth performance, processing yields, litter quality and foot pad dermatitis (FPD) in male turkeys from two commercial hybrids. Soya bean meal was replaced by vegetable protein sources selected for lower K concentrations to lower DEB in order to improve litter quality and subsequent quality of foot pads. 2. Effects of CP on litter friability and wetness were not consistent during the production period. FPD in turkeys fed on diets with low CP was significantly lower than FPD in turkeys fed on diets with high CP until 84 d. Growth performance was adversely affected at low CP. Processing yields were not affected by CP. 3. Litter was significantly dryer in pens of turkeys fed on diets with low DEB than in pens of turkeys fed on diets with high DEB. FPD in turkeys fed on diets with low DEB was significantly lower than in turkeys fed on diets with high DEB. Growth performance and processing yields were adversely affected at low DEB. 4. FPD in turkey hybrid A was higher than in turkey hybrid B at 28 d of age. Thereafter, no differences in FPD between turkey hybrids were observed. Growth performance and processing yields were not affected by turkey hybrid. 5. Overall, a significant interaction effect of CP × DEB was observed for FCR: in turkeys fed on the high DEB treatment, FCR of turkeys fed on the high CP diets was lower than FCR of turkeys fed on the low CP (LCP) diets whereas on the low DEB treatment, FCR was not affected by CP treatment. 6. It was concluded that litter quality can be improved and FPD may be decreased in turkeys fed on diets containing lower CP and DEB levels. © 2017 British Poultry Science Ltd.},

Cured hams were analyzed by PCR, bioassay and in-vitro cultivation on Vero cells followed by real-time PCR. Pigs seroconverted from day 21 p.i. Bioassays were positive for all fresh thighs, but negative for cured hams. PCR was positive for parasite DNA from most thighs both at slaughter and post curing, but parasite growth was not observed following in vitro cultivation and real-time PCR. Results indicate that the curing process of Parma Ham (PDO), when carried out according to the Parma Ham consortium regulations, can inactivate T. gondii tissue cysts.

abstract={Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of plasmid-mediated colistin resistance genes in Escherichia coli from pigs affected by post-weaning diarrhoea (PWD). Methods DNA samples collected from 51 E. coli isolates from Italian pigs affected by PWD in 2015–2016 were studied. Isolates were classified as presumptively resistant to colistin by routine susceptibility testing and were investigated for the presence of the mcr-1 gene of plasmid origin by PCR. E. coli isolates testing negative for mcr-1 were analysed for the presence of a novel plasmid-mediated gene, mcr-2. Isolates were characterised for fimbrial [F4 (k88), F5 (k99), F6 (987P), F18 and F41] and toxin (LT, STa, STb and Stx2e) determinants by PCR as well as for the occurrence of haemolysis by phenotypic observation. Susceptibility to apramycin, cefquinome, enrofloxacin, florfenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT) was also determined by disk diffusion. Results Most of the isolates showed the presence of at least one virulence factor, confirming their pathogenic potential. The presence of mcr-1 was shown in 37 (72.5%) of the 51 isolates. All of the mcr-1-negative isolates tested negative for the mcr-2 gene. Moreover, 80.4% of the isolates were resistant to apramycin, 9.8% to cefquinome, 54.9% to enrofloxacin, 52.9% to florfenicol, 76.5% to gentamicin, 96.1% to tetracycline and 78.4% to SXT.

abstract={Usutu virus (USUV), a member of the genus Flavivirus, is known to circulate at low prevalence in Northern Italy, and has been reported to cause overt infection. USUV was first reported in Europe in 2001, but a retrospective study showed that it has been present in Italy at least since 1996. Seroprevalence data for USUV antibodies in sera are being collected in different European countries, showing circulation at low prevalence in human populations. Interestingly, two consecutive studies in Northern Italy indicate a possible increase in the presence of the virus, from 0% to 0.23% seroprevalence in blood donors. In this study, antibodies against USUV were measured in 3 consecutive blood samples collected from October 2014 to December 2015 from 33 forestry workers in the Po river valley, while samples from 200 blood donors from the same geographical area were tested in parallel. Neutralizing and IgG antibodies were found in six forestry workers (18.1%) and in two blood donors (1%). Our results indicate that USUV circulation in the examined area, part of a highly populated region in Northern Italy, is higher than expected. Healthy subjects exhibit a higher prevalence than what was found in a previous report in an adjoining region (0.23%), while the population at risk shows a much higher prevalence value (18.1%). © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.},

abstract={The objective of this study was to assess the in vitro effect of iodopropynyl butylcarbamate (IPBC) and amphotericin B (AMB) on Prototheca zopfii genotype 2 and Prototheca blaschkeae isolates recovered from dairy herds of Belgium, France, Italy, Germany, and Poland. The combination of IPBC with AMB on Prototheca isolates and toxicity of IPBC to the bovine mammary epithelial cells were also evaluated. The in vitro activity of IPBC and AMB against 96 isolates of P. zopfii genotype 2 and 42 isolates of P. blaschkeae was performed. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum algicidal concentrations (MAC) of IPBC and AMB were determined. To determine any synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effect of the combination of IPBC and AMB, 2-dimensional checkerboard combination tests were also performed to calculate fractional inhibitory concentrations. Cytotoxicity analysis of IPBC to the bovine mammary epithelial cell line was performed using a 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The MIC for 50 and 90% of isolates (MIC50 and MIC90, respectively) for IPBC were 4 and 8 mg/L versus 0.5 and 1 mg/L for AMB, respectively. The MIC profiles differed between P. zopfii genotype 2 and P. blaschkeae, with the latter species being more susceptible to both compounds. The MIC50 and MIC90 of IPBC were 4 and 8 mg/L for P. zopfii genotype 2 and 1 and 2 mg/L for P. blaschkeae, respectively. The MIC50 and MIC90 of AMB were both 1 mg/L for P. zopfii genotype 2 and 0.25 and 1 mg/L for P. blaschkeae, respectively. Both IPBC and AMB exhibited the ability to kill Prototheca spp. The MAC for 90% of isolates of IPBC was twice the MIC90, whereas an 8-fold increase of the MIC90 was algicidal in the case of AMB. Overall, the combined use of IPBC and AMB exhibited an increased algicidal effect, albeit the fractional inhibitory concentration index showed synergistic activity only against 3 P. zopfii genotype 2 isolates. For all the remaining isolates (87.5%), this combination produced only an additive effect. The MTT assay results showed both IPBC and AMB, at the concentrations employed in the study, to be nontoxic to the epithelial mammary gland cells (cell viability &gt;90%). Notably, only IPBC at the highest concentration (i.e., 8 mg/L) exerted a slight cytotoxic effect on the cell line tested (mean cell viability: 88.54 ± 3.88 and 90.66 ± 3.0, after 2 and 4 h of MTT treatment, respectively). The anti-Prototheca activity of IPBC was here demonstrated for the first time. In addition, the combined use of IPBC with AMB enhanced each other's effect, creating an additive rather than synergistic interaction. Both agents, used at concentrations corresponding to MIC values against Prototheca spp., showed no toxic effect for the mammary epithelial cells. In conclusion, IPBC, used either alone or in combination with AMB, can be considered a promising option in the treatment armamentarium for protothecal mastitis in dairy cows. © 2017 American Dairy Science Association},

abstract={Intestinal infection with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is an important disease in swine resulting in significant economic losses. Knowledge about the epidemiology, the diagnostic approach and methods of control are of fundamental importance to tackle the disease. The ETEC causing neonatal colibacillosis mostly carry the fimbriae F4 (k88), F5 (k99), F6 (987P) or F41, while the ETEC of post-weaning diarrhoea carry the fimbriae F4 (k88) and F18. These fimbriae adhere to specific receptors on porcine intestinal brush border epithelial cells (enterocytes), starting the process of enteric infection. After this colonization, the bacteria produce one or more enterotoxins inducing diarrhoea, such as the heat stable toxin a (STa), the heat stable toxin b (STb), and the heat labile toxin (LT). A role in the pathogenesis of the disease was demonstrated for these toxins. The diagnosis of enteric colibacillosis is based on the isolation and quantification of the pathogenic E.coli coupled with the demonstration by PCR of the genes encoding for virulence factors (fimbriae and toxins). The diagnostic approach to enteric colibacillosis must consider the differential diagnosis and the potential different causes that can be involved in the outbreak. Among the different methods of control of colibacillosis, the use of antimicrobials is widely practiced and antibiotics are used in two main ways: as prophylactic or metaphylactic treatment to prevent disease and for therapeutic purposes to treat diseased pigs. An accurate diagnosis of enteric colibacillosis needs an appropriate sampling for the isolation and quantification of the ETEC responsible for the outbreak by using semi-quantitative bacteriology. Definitive diagnosis is based on the presence of characteristic lesions and results of bacteriology along with confirmation of appropriate virulence factors to identify the isolated E.coli. It is important to confirm the diagnosis and to perform antimicrobial sensitivity tests because antimicrobial sensitivity varies greatly among E. coli isolates. Growing concern on the increase of antimicrobial resistance force a more rational use of antibiotics and this can be achieved through a correct understanding of the issues related to antibiotic therapy and to the use of antibiotics by both practitioners and farmers. © The Author(s). 2018.},

abstract={Aims: To evaluate and compare the capabilities of multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and multiple locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) techniques to characterize Brachyspira hyodysenteriae isolates and to investigate the relationship between pleuromutilin resistance and genetic variability. Methods and Results: MLST genotyping was performed on 180 B. hyodysenteriae isolates, and the results were evaluated considering profiles from 108 other strains previously reported in the database. In total, 37 sequence types were obtained. The MLVA approach completely characterized 172 strains and grouped the isolates into 22 different profiles. The combination of MLST and MLVA showed a slight increase in the discriminatory power, identifying 33 joint profiles. An antibiotic resistance analysis showed a reduction in the susceptibility to pleuromutilins over time, and a weak association between susceptibility to valnemulin and inclusion in clonal complex 4. Conclusion: MLST and MLVA are reliable methods for characterizing B. hyodysenteriae strains and they have comparable discriminatory power. Significance and Impact of the Study: The genotyping of B. hyodysenteriae isolates and a database of all the genetic profiles collected during the diagnostic activities could support traditional epidemiological investigations in identifying infection sources and routes of transmission among herds, and in developing more effective control measures. © 2017 The Society for Applied Microbiology},

abstract={Introduction: Recently a new genus of influenza virus, tentatively named Influenzavirus D (IDV), was detected in swine and cattle firstly in USA and then in China, Japan, France, Mexico and in Italy. At present it seems that the bovine species is the reservoir of IDV and that this virus plays a role in bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC). Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of this new respiratory viral infection in bovine population in Northern Italy, an area with high density of swine and cattle farms, by applying molecular, virological and serologi-cal tests on samples submitted to the laboratory for routine diagnostic or surveillance investigations. Materials and method: Between April 2014 and October 2016, 895 samples, 744 nasal swabs and 151 lung tissues, from cattle with or without BRDC, were analyzed by RealTime RT-PCR and virological methods. The samples originated from 574 different herds. Genetic characterization of IDV isolated strains was performed by NGS sequencing. A serological study, using HI test with the Italian isolate D/swine/Italy/199724/2015, was performed on 420 serum samples randomly selected from 42 farms located in Man-tova province, an area where the virus was detected in several herds. Results and discussion: Fifty-eight samples (6.5%) were found to be positive for IDV with RT-PCR. Among these, 48 samples were taken from cattle with BRDC and 10 from subjects without BRDC. IDV was identified in 32 outbreaks of respiratory disease, 5 in beef fattening unit and 27 in dairy herds. These farms were located in 12 different provinces of Northern Italy. In 20 outbreaks (62.5%) the IDV was the only respiratory virus detected, while in 12 outbreaks (37.5%) the infection was mixed with other major viral respiratory pathogens (BVDV, BRSV, BoHV-1, PI3V, BCoV). Eleven influenza D strains were isolated and their genetic analysis indicated that all clustered with the first detected virus D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011. Serology data showed that all the tested farms from Mantova province were positive to IDV, with a global animal prevalence amounted to a value of 92.4%. Conclusion: This study shows evidences of a widespread circulation of influenza D virus in cattle in Italy and provides some data on the involvement of this virus in the etiology of the bovine respiratory disease complex. Many other aspects concerning the field of epidemiology, virology and pathobiology of this new respiratory infection need to be investigated in the future to better delineate the role of In-fluenzavirus D in BRDC.},

abstract={Gut is often a receptacle for many different pathogens in feed and/or the environment, such as Salmonella spp. The current knowledge about pathogenicity of Salmonella is restricted to few serotypes, whereas other important ones like S. Coeln, S. Thompson, S. Veneziana, have not been investigated yet in human and animal models. Therefore, the aim of our work was to verify the ability of widespread environmental Salmonella strains to penetrate and modulate innate immunity in pig intestinal IPEC-J2 cells. Our results outline the different ability of Salmonella strains to modulate innate immunity; the expression of the IFN-β gene was increased by S. Typhimurium, S. Ablogame and S. Diarizonae 2, that also caused an inflammatory response in terms of Interleukin (IL)-1β and/or IL-8 gene espression. In particular, IL-8 gene expression and protein release were significantly modulated by 5 Salmonella strains out of 7. Interestingly, S. Typhimurium, S. Coeln and S. Thompson strains, characterized by a peculiar ability to penetrate into IPEC-J2 cells, up-regulated both IL-8 and TNF-α gene expression. Accordingly, blocking IL-8 was shown to decrease the penetration of S. Typhimurium. On the contrary, S. Diarizonae strain 1, showing lesser invasion of IPEC-J2 cells, down-regulated the p38-MAPK pathway, and it did not induce an inflammatory response. Our results confirm that IPEC-J2 cells are a useful model to evaluate host-gut pathogen interaction and indicate IL-8 and TNF-α as possible predictive markers of invasiveness of Salmonella strains in enterocytes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Pathogens transmitted to humans by phlebotomine sand flies are neglected, as they cause infectious diseases that are not on the priority list of national and international public health systems. However, the infections caused by protozoa of the Leishmania genus and viruses belonging to the Phlebovirus genus (family Phenuiviridae)—the most significant group of viruses transmitted by sand flies—have a relevant role for human pathology. These infections are emerging in the Mediterranean region and will likely spread in forthcoming decades, posing a complex threat to human health. Four species and 2 hybrid strains of Leishmania are pathogenic for humans in the Mediterranean Basin, with an estimated annual incidence of 239,500–393,600 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis and 1,200–2,000 cases of visceral leishmaniasis. Among the phleboviruses, Toscana virus can cause neuroinvasive infections, while other phleboviruses are responsible for a typical “3-day fever”; the actual incidence of Phlebovirus infections in the Mediterranean area is unknown, although at least 250 million people are exposed. Here, we reviewed the current literature on epidemiology of sand fly–borne infections in the Mediterranean Basin, with a focus on humans. Our analysis indicates the need for increased public health activities directed to determine the disease burden of these infections as well as to improve their surveillance. Among the emerging challenges concerning sand fly–borne pathogens, the relationships between sand fly–borne protozoa and viruses should be considered in future studies, including epidemiological links between Leishmania and phleboviruses as well as the conditional capacity for these pathogens to be involved in interactions that may evolve towards increased virulence. © 2017 Moriconi et al.},

abstract={Purpose. Highly discriminatory genotyping strategies are essential in molecular epidemiological studies of tuberculosis. In this study we evaluated, for the first time, the efficacy of the repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) DiversiLab Mycobacterium typing kit over spoligotyping, 12-locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing and embB single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis for Mycobacterium bovis typing. Methodology. A total of 49 M. bovis animal isolates were used. DNA was extracted and genomic DNA was amplified using the DiversiLab Mycobacterium typing kit. The amplified fragments were separated and detected using a microfluidics chip with Agilent 2100. The resulting rep-PCR-based DNA fingerprints were uploaded to and analysed using web-based DiversiLab software through Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Results. Rep-PCR DiversiLab grouped M. bovis isolates into ten different clusters. Most isolates sharing identical spoligotype, MIRU-VNTR profile or embB gene polymorphism were grouped into different rep-PCR clusters. Rep-PCR DiversiLab displayed greater discriminatory power than spoligotyping and embB SNP analysis but a lower resolution power than the 12-locus MIRU-VNTR analysis. MIRU-VNTR confirmed that it is superior to the other PCR-based methods tested here. Conclusion. In combination with spoligotyping and 12-locus MIRU-VNTR analysis, rep-PCR improved the discriminatory power for M. bovis typing. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={This study evaluated the vector competence of Aedes albopictus in transmitting USUV after oral infection under laboratory conditions. Ae. albopictus showed a low vector competence for USUV, although the positive body sample found with a very high number of viral copies at one week post infection indicates that a replication in the mosquito body can occur, and that USUV can escape the midgut barrier. Field data from an extensive entomological arboviruses surveillance program showed a relevant incidence of Ae. albopictus USUV positive pools in the period 2009–2012 while all pools were negative from 2013 on. No conceivable explanation regarding this field evidence was addressed, suggesting that attention must be paid to the trend of development of this vector-pathogen association, being aware of the potential rapid arbovirus’ adaptation to new vectors, to prevent possible new disease's emergence. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Usutu virus is an arbovirus closely related to West Nile virus (genus Flavivirus), which circulates between mosquitoes and wild birds. This virus has been increasingly reported in Europe, raising concerns for its possible pathogenic potential for wild birds and humans. This study reports the whole genome sequences of 15 strains of USUV, isolated between 2010 and 2014 from mosquitoes and wild birds in the course of West Nile virus surveillance in the Emilia-Romagna and Lombardy regions of Northern Italy. Both whole and 656 partial genome sequences, obtained from isolated viruses and field samples (mosquitoes and wild birds), were analyzed to describe the temporal and geographical spread of USUV in the surveyed area. The detected sequences belonged to two groups, with one circulating primarily in the northwestern part of the area and the other in the southeastern part. This pattern is likely the result of different routes of introduction from the North (over the Alps) and from the East, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis of obtained sequences and other European sequences demonstrated that the majority of European strains belonged to one main clade, while less common strains, mainly from Western Europe, fell in other two clades. This analysis strongly suggested an autochthonous evolution process of strains of the main clade from a common ancestor with an estimated time of arrival in Europe at the beginning of the 1990s. In addition to causing mass mortality in wild birds, Usutu virus can infect humans and can sporadically cause disease. These factors and the endemization of the Usutu virus in a large area of Europe, sustained by the obtained data, strongly support the need to adequately survey Usutu virus in areas in which its circulation is detected. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Fibromyalgia is a chronic syndrome characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain and an extensive array of other symptoms including disordered sleep, fatigue, depression and anxiety. Important factors involved in the pathogenic process of fibromyalgia are inflammation and oxidative stress, suggesting that ant-inflammatory and/or antioxidant supplementation might be effective in the management and modulation of this syndrome. Recent evidence suggests that melatonin may be suitable for this purpose due to its well known ant-inflammatory, antioxidant and analgesic effects. Thus, in the current study, the effects of the oral supplementation of melatonin against fibromyalgia-related skeletal muscle alterations were evaluated. In detail, 90 Sprague Dawley rats were randomly treated with reserpine, to reproduce the pathogenic process of fibromyalgia and thereafter they received melatonin. The animals treated with reserpine showed moderate alterations at hind limb skeletal muscles level and had difficulty in moving, together with significant morphological and ultrastructural alterations and expression of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in the gastrocnemius muscle. Interestingly, melatonin, dose and/or time dependently, reduced the difficulties in spontaneous motor activity and the musculoskeletal morphostructural, inflammatory, and oxidative stress alterations. This study suggests that melatonin in vivo may be an effective tool in the management of fibromyalgia-related musculoskeletal morphofunctional damage. © 2017 by the authors.

abstract={Many prokaryote species are known to have fluid genomes, with different strains varying markedly in accessory gene content through the combined action of gene loss, gene gain via lateral transfer, as well as gene duplication. However, the evolutionary forces determining genome fluidity are not yet well understood. We here for the first time systematically analyse the degree to which this distinctive genomic feature differs between bacterial species. We find that genome fluidity is positively correlated with synonymous nucleotide diversity of the core genome, a measure of effective population size N e. No effects of genome size, phylogeny or homologous recombination rate on genome fluidity were found. Our findings are consistent with a scenario where accessory gene content turnover is for a large part dictated by neutral evolution.},

abstract={Lagoviruses belong to the Caliciviridae family. They were first recognized as highly pathogenic viruses of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and European brown hare (Lepus europaeus) that emerged in the 1970–1980s, namely, rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) and European brown hare syndrome virus (EBHSV), according to the host species from which they had been first detected. However, the diversity of lagoviruses has recently expanded to include new related viruses with varying pathogenicity, geographic distribution and host ranges. Together with the frequent recombination observed amongst circulating viruses, there is a clear need to establish precise guidelines for classifying and naming lagovirus strains. Therefore, here we propose a new nomenclature based on phylogenetic relationships. In this new nomenclature, a single species of lagovirus would be recognized and called Lagovirus europaeus. The species would be divided into two genogroups that correspond to RHDV- and EBHSV-related viruses, respectively. Genogroups could be subdivided into genotypes, which could themselves be subdivided into phylogenetically well-supported variants. Based on available sequences, pairwise distance cutoffs have been defined, but with the accumulation of new sequences these cutoffs may need to be revised. We propose that an international working group could coordinate the nomenclature of lagoviruses and any proposals for revision. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a major agent of dairy cow intramammary infections: the different prevalences of mastitis reported might be related to a combination of S. aureus virulence factors beyond host factors. The present study considered 169 isolates from different Italian dairy herds that were classified into four groups based on the prevalence of S. aureus infection at the first testing: low prevalence (LP), medium–low (MLP), medium–high (MHP) and high (HP). We aimed to correlate the presence of virulence genes with the prevalence of intramammary infections in order to develop new strategies for the control of S. aureus mastitis. Microarray data were statistically evaluated using binary logistic regression and correspondence analysis to screen the risk factors and the relationship between prevalence group and gene. The analysis showed: (1) 24 genes at significant risk of being detected in all the herds with infection prevalence >5%, including genes belonging to microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMMs), immune evasion and serine proteases; and (2) a significant correlation coefficient between the genes interacting with the host immune response and HP isolates against LP ones. These results support the hypothesis that virulence factors, in addition to cow management, could be related to strain contagiousness, offering new insights into vaccine development. © 2017 by the authors.

abstract={After the H7N7 highly pathogenic (HP) avian influenza (AI) outbreak in 2013, and a single case of H5N8 HPAI in 2014, in April 2016, a H7N7 HPAI virus was detected in northeastern Italy. The case occurred in an organic free-range laying hen farm located in proximity with one of the highest densely populated poultry areas (DPPAs) in Italy. Control measures provided by the Council of the European Union in directive 2005/94/CE were promptly applied, and enhanced surveillance activities were implemented in the DPPAs. On May 16, 2016, a second case was confirmed in a fattening Turkey farm within the protection zone of the previous outbreak. Following an epidemiologic inquiry, another Turkey farm was considered at risk of transmission and was subjected to preemptive culling. Epidemiologic data and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the virus was likely introduced from wild birds as a low pathogenicity AI strain, through direct contact. The rapid containment of the outbreak proves the level of preparedness of the veterinary public health sector in Italy. Nevertheless, the recurrent introductions from wild birds indicate the need of improving both the biosecurity levels in the DPPA and the surveillance activities in wild birds to quickly detect the presence of AI in the territory.},

abstract={This study was conducted to investigate the presence of Enterococcus spp. in meat, meat products and seafood. A hundred and four samples were randomly collected from different geographic localities in Libya. The samples were subjected to microbiological analysis for enumeration and isolation of Enterococcus spp. by conventional cultural and molecular identification using PCR and partial sequencing of 16S rDNA techniques. Out of 104 samples, 73 (70.2%) isolates were found to be enterococci based on their cultural characteristics on ESD medium. However, out of 36 samples subjected to molecular identification, only six isolates were confirmed to be Enterococcus spp. using PCR and partial sequencing of 16S rDNA technique. All enterococci strains tested for their antibiotic sensitivity profiles showed high percentage of multi-resistance phenotype. These results can be used for further studies on enterococci as an emerging food borne pathogen and its role in human infection in Libya and would suggest that meat, meat products and seafood might play a role in the spreading of enterococci through the food chain with antimicrobial resistance characteristics.},

abstract={Orthobunyaviruses are enveloped viruses that can cause human and animal diseases. A novel and major member is the Schmallenberg virus (SBV), the etiological agent of an emerging disease of ruminants that has been spreading all over Europe since 2011. The glycoproteins Gn and Gc of orthobunyaviruses mediate the viral entry, and specifically Gc is a major target for the humoral immune response. For example, the N terminal subdomain of the SBV glycoprotein Gc is targeted by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that recognize conformational epitopes. Here, we determined the structural features of the N terminus of Gc, and analysed its interaction with monoclonal antibodies. We were able to demonstrate that one of two N-glycosylation sites is essential for secretion and interaction with a subset of Gc-specific monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, four disulfide bonds (S-S) were identified and the deletion of the third S-S blocked reactivity with another subset of mAbs with virus-neutralizing and non-neutralizing activity. The mutagenesis of the N-glycosylation sites and the disulfide bonds strongly indicated the independent folding of two subdomains within the SBV Gc N terminus. Further, the epitopes recognized by a panel of mAbs could be grouped into two clusters, as revealed by fine mapping using chimeric proteins. Combining the disulfide bonding and epitope mapping allowed us to generate a structural model of the SBV Gc N- terminus. This novel information about the role and structure of the amino terminal region of SBV Gc is of general relevance for the design of antivirals and vaccines against this virus. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={Human leishmaniasis is an emerging problem in Italy and is on the increase in the Emilia-Romagna region, northeastern part of the country. Nevertheless, studies dealing with the molecular characterization of Leishmania spp. circulating in these areas are limited. In the present work, we explored the genetic polymorphism of Leishmania isolates from 28 cases of canine leishmaniasis and three cases of human visceral leishmaniasis (VL), which occurred in 2013-2014 in the Emilia-Romagna region. The characterization was carried out in comparison with nine human isolates of Leishmania from other VL endemic Italian regions and two reference strains. Nucleic acid from 31 Leishmania-positive phlebotomine sandfly pools, sampled in 2012-2013 in the Emilia-Romagna region, were also evaluated. DNA amplification and sequencing of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer-1 and of a repetitive nuclear region on chromosome 31 were carried out for genotyping. Two size polymorphic targets were also analyzed by PCR, the cpb E/F-gene and the k26-gene. Altogether, the analysis showed the circulation of different Leishmania infantum genotypes in the Emilia-Romagna region: two genotypes found in dogs from public kennels were similar to VL isolates from other Italian regions, whereas a third genotype was detected in VL cases of the Emilia-Romagna region and in all but one of the sandfly pools. The combined molecular tools applied in this study can constitute a helpful support for parasite tracking (e.g., in outbreak investigations) and for a better understanding of the epidemiological evolution of leishmaniasis in northeastern Italy. © 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract={In spring there is often a rise in honey bee mortality incidents. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential correlation, in the reported incidents, between exposure to pesticide treatments and virus infections. Here we summarize the situation in northeastern Italy during spring 2014, evaluated by monitoring 150 active ingredients and three honey bee viruses in dead honey bees and other matrices. At least one active ingredient was found in 72.2% of the 79 dead honey bee samples, with the most abundant (59.4%) being insecticides, mainly belonging to the class of neonicotinoids (41.8%), followed by fungicides (40.6%). Imidacloprid, chlorpyrifos, tau-fluvalinate, and cyprodinil were the most frequently detected active ingredients. Multiple virus infections were monitored, revealing a high prevalence of chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) and deformed wing virus (DWV), detected in all samples except one. 71 and 37% of the CBPV- and DWV positive samples, respectively, showed a high number of viral copies per bee (&gt;10 7 ). This work emphasizes the possible relationship between spring mortality in honey bees and pesticide treatments. Honey bee viruses could synergistically exacerbate the negative impact of pesticides on honey bee health, endangering the survival of colonies. © 2017 International Bee Research Association.},

abstract={Fresh vegetables and their ready-to-eat (RTE) salads have become increasingly recognized as potential vehicles for foodborne diseases. The EU Reg. 1441/2007 establishes microbiological criteria for bacterial pathogens for products placed on the market during their shelf-life (i.e. Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes) for pre-cut fruits and vegetables (RTE) whilst it does not address the problem of contamination by enteric viruses. In this study we investigated the contamination by hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis E virus (HEV) and norovirus (NoV) in 911 ready-to-eat vegetable samples taken from products at retail in Apulia and in Lombardia. The vegetable samples were tested using validated real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) assays, ISO standardized virological methods and ISO culturing methods for bacteriological analysis. The total prevalence of HAV and HEV was 1.9% (18/911) and 0.6% (6/911), respectively. None of the samples analysed in this study was positive for NoV, Salmonella spp. or Listeria monocytogenes. The detection of HAV and HEV in RTE salads highlights a risk to consumers and the need to improve production hygiene. Appropriate implementation of hygiene procedures is required at all the steps of the RTE vegetable production chain and this should include monitoring of emerging viral pathogens. © 2017},

abstract={Background: Molecular subtyping and enhanced surveillance in Lombardy region identified a cluster of possibly related listeriosis cases from 2006 to 2010. This cluster grouped 31 isolates that belonged to serotype 1/2a and Sequence Type 38 (ST38) as defined by Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST). Methods: Our study expanded the previous investigation to include cases from 2011 to 2014 and used Multi-Virulence-Locus Sequence Typing (MVLST) on all ST38 isolates to better understand their epidemiology and possibly identify a common source outbreak. Results: Out of 306L. monocytogenes clinical isolates collected, 43 (14.1%) belonged to ST38 with cases occurring in nine out of twelve Lombardy provinces. The ST38 isolates were split by MVLST into two Virulence Types (VTs): VT80 (n=12) and VT104 (n=31). VT104 cases were concentrated between 2009 and 2011 in two provinces, Bergamo and Milan. An epidemiologic investigation was performed and in one case, a matching VT104 isolate was retrieved from a soft cheese sample from a patient's refrigerator. Conclusions: Our findings revealed a major listeriosis outbreak in Northern Italy linked to soft cheese in 2009-2011, which went undetected by local health authorities. Our study shows that integrating subtyping methods with conventional epidemiology can help identify the source of L. monocytogenes outbreak clones. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in North Africa (2013) and the Gulf States (2013) of the Middle East have been caused by a FMD viral lineage (O/ME-SA/Ind-2001) that was before 2013 restricted to the Indian Sub-continent. This study was undertaken to assess the in vivo efficacy of a FMD virus emergency vaccine type O1 Manisa against heterologous challenge with a representative field virus (O/ALG/3/2014) from this emerging lineage. This widely available vaccine was selected since in vitro vaccine-matching results gave inconclusive results as to whether or not it would be protective. Three groups of five cattle were vaccinated with O1 Manisa (homologous potency ≥6PD50/dose) using study guidelines outlined in the European Pharmacopeia, and challenged at 21 days post-vaccination by tongue inoculation. All animals that were vaccinated with the lowest dose (1/16) of vaccine developed generalised FMD, defined as vesicular lesions at the feet. One animal vaccinated with a 1/4 dose of the vaccine also developed generalised disease, as did two animals vaccinated with the full dose of vaccine. These results indicate that the heterologous potency of this high potency O1 Manisa vaccine was approximately 3.5 PD50/dose. These data support the use of the O1 Manisa vaccine for FMD control in areas where FMDV is endemic e.g. North Africa, and motivate further studies to evaluate other vaccine candidates (or multivalent combinations) that might be potentially used for emergency purposes in FMD-free settings. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The occurrence of virus belonging to the putative genus Influenzavirus D, has been demonstrated all-around the world arousing interest within the scientific community. Most of the published virological surveys are based on the first described Real-Time PCR method, designed on the PB1 gene of the first isolate. The necessity of extending investigation to different animal species and geographic areas, requires a continuous update of molecular tests, considering newly sequenced strains. Moreover, the availability of an alternative assay, is essential either to confirm data, or for ensuring the detection of the widest number of strains. A new Real-Time PCR, specific for influenza D virus (IDV), was developed and evaluated. The target sequences of primers and probe are highly conserved among IDV strains currently known. The specificity of the method was demonstrated in silico by BLAST, and in vitro with a huge panel of common swine and bovine respiratory pathogens. The analytical sensitivity of the Real-Time PCR was estimated through synthetic RNA molecules and the limit of detection was about 20 copies/μL. The assay was assessed in field and proved to be a valuable tool for the detection of IDV strains. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This work investigated the effects of mercury chloride (HgCl2) acute exposure on virgin, pregnant and lactating rats by determination of renal and hepatic morphological and ultrastructural parameters and the expression of oxidative stress and stress tolerance markers, due to kidney and liver are the organs that more accumulate inorganic mercury. Adult Wistar rats virgin (90 days old), pregnant (18th gestation day) and lactating (7th lactation day) were injected once with HgCl2 (5 mg/kg) or saline (controls). We observed that HgCl2 exposure of virgin rats caused significant inflammatory infiltration and severe morphological variations, like glomeruli atrophy, dilatation of Bowman's capsule, tubular degeneration and hepatocytes alteration. Moreover, virgin rats presented mitochondrial modification, important oxidative stress and increase in stress tolerance proteins at both kidney and liver level, compared with virgin controls. In detail, virgin rats exposed to HgCl2 presented significantly elevated level of inducible nitric oxide synthase, heat shock protein 27 and glucose regulated proteins 75 expressions at both renal tubular and hepatocytes level, respect untreated virgin rats. Interestingly, pregnant and lactating rats exposed to HgCl2 presented weak renal and liver morphological alterations, showing weak inflammatory infiltration and no significant difference in structural mitochondrial transmembrane protein, oxidative stress markers and stress tolerance proteins expressions respect controls (virgin, pregnant and lactating rats). Although, both control and HgCl2-exposed pregnant and lactating rats showed renal glomeruli greater in diameter respect virgin rats. In conclusion, we believe that virgin rats are more sensitive to HgCl2 toxicity respect pregnant and lactating rats. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract={The current circulating swine influenza virus (IV) subtypes in Europe (H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2) are associated with clinical outbreaks of disease. However, we showed that pigs could be susceptible to other IV strains that are able to cross the species barrier. In this work, we extended our investigations into whether different IV strains able to cross the species barrier might give rise to different innate immune responses that could be associated with pathological lesions. For this purpose, we used the same samples collected in a previous study of ours, in which healthy pigs had been infected with a H3N2 Swine IV and four different H3N8 IV strains circulating in different animal species. Pigs had been clinically inspected and four subjects/group were sacrificed at 3, 6, and 21 days post infection. In the present study, all groups but mock exhibited antibody responses to IV nucleoprotein protein. Pulmonary lesions and high-titered viral replication were observed in pigs infected with the swine-adapted virus. Interestingly, pigs infected with avian and seal H3N8 strains also showed moderate lesions and viral replication, whereas equine and canine IVs did not cause overt pathological signs, and replication was barely detectable. Swine IV infection induced interferon (IFN)-alpha and interleukin-6 responses in bronchoalveolar fluids (BALF) at day 3 post infection, as opposed to the other non-swine-adapted virus strains. However, IFN-alpha responses to the swine-adapted virus were not associated with an increase of the local, constitutive expression of IFN-alpha genes. Remarkably, the Equine strain gave rise to a Serum Amyloid A response in BALF despite little if any replication. Each virus strain could be associated with expression of cytokine genes and/or proteins after infection. These responses were observed well beyond the period of virus replication, suggesting a prolonged homeostatic imbalance of the innate immune system. © 2017 Montoya, Foni, Solórzano, Razzuoli, Baratelli, Bilato, Córdoba, del Burgo, Martinez, Martinez-Orellana, Chiapponi, Perlin, del Real and Amadori.},

abstract={Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm) and its monophasic variant 4,[5],12:i:(VMSTm) have been responsible for an increased number of foodborne infections in humans in Europe in recent years. The aim of this study was to investigate the origin of three foodborne salmonellosis outbreaks that occurred in Pavia Province (Lombardy region, northern Italy) in 2010. Phenotypic and genetic characteristics of the STm and VMSTm isolates from patients and from food that were recovered in the framework of the three outbreaks were evaluated through serotyping, phage typing, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, pulsedfield gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). Salami from three artisan producers, which had all purchased meat from the same slaughterhouse, was the food source of infection in outbreak I. STm isolates were recovered from salami and patients with symptoms of gastroenteritis. These isolates had the same PFGE type and the same rare MLVA profile (3-18-9-NA-211). The same molecular profiles were found in an STm isolate from a salami, which likely was the source of another family outbreak (II). A VMSTm strain with common phenotypic and molecular profiles was isolated from three hospitalized patients and identified as the cause of another putative outbreak (III). During the following 3 years (2011 through 2013), 360 salami produced in Pavia Province were monitored for the presence of S. enterica. In 2011, no STm and VMSTm isolates were recovered from 159 salami tested. During 2012 and 2013, 13.9% of 201 tested salami harbored S. enterica, and half of the isolates were VMSTm, mainly in salami from those artisan producers involved in the previous outbreaks. These isolates were genetically variable, especially in terms of MLVA profiles. The data collected suggest that from 2012, VMSTm has replaced STm in the environments of the salami producers monitored in this study, and these data confirm the dominance of this emergent serovar along the pork supply chain.

abstract={Fresh (frozen/thawed) muscle samples from four 2–12-year-old roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) from the Sondrio province in north-eastern Italy were examined under a dissecting microscope, and about 180 sarcocysts were isolated and identified to morphological type in wet mounts by light microscopy (LM). Seventy-seven of these sarcocysts were subsequently examined by molecular methods, comprising polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing of the partial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (cox1) of all isolates, as well as PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing of the complete18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene of two isolates of each species found. By LM, three major sarcocyst types were recognised: spindle-shaped sarcocysts, 0.5–3 mm long, either with no clearly recognisable protrusions (thin-walled) or with finger-like protrusions (thick-walled); and slender, thread-like sarcocysts, 2–3 mm long, with hair-like protrusions. Sequencing of cox1 revealed that the sarcocysts belonged to four different species. Those with no visible protrusions either belonged to Sarcocystis gracilis (n = 24) or to a Sarcocystis taeniata-like species (n = 19), whereas those with finger- and hair-like protrusions belonged to Sarcocystis silva (n = 27) and Sarcocystis capreolicanis (n = 7), respectively. The 19 cox1 sequences of the S. taeniata-like species, comprising five haplotypes, differed from each other at 0–16 of 1038 nucleotide positions (98.5–100% identity). They differed from 25 previous cox1 sequences of S. taeniata from moose and sika deer (with 98.0–100% intraspecific identity), at 33–43 nucleotide positions (95.9–96.8% interspecific identity), and there were 20 fixed nucleotide differences between the two populations. In the phylogenetic analysis based on cox1 sequences, the two populations formed two separate monophyletic clusters. The S. taeniata-like species in roe deer was therefore considered to represent a separate species, which was named Sarcocystis linearis n. sp. At the 18S rRNA gene, however, the two species could not be clearly separated from each other. Thus, there was considerable intraspecific sequence variation in the 18S rRNA gene of S. linearis (98.1–99.9% identity between 24 sequences), which was similar both in magnitude and nature to the variation previously found in this gene of S. taeniata. The new 18S rRNA gene sequences of S. linearis shared an identity of 97.9–99.6% with those of S. taeniata (overlap between intra- and interspecific identity), and in the phylogenetic tree, sequences of the two species were interspersed. By scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the sarcocysts of S. linearis were found to possess regularly spaced, thin and narrow ribbon-like cyst wall protrusions (about 2.8–3.2 μm long, 0.3–0.4 μm wide and about 0.02–0.03 μm thick), terminating in a plate-like structure of the same thickness but with an elliptic outline (about 0.3–0.4 μm wide and 0.7–0.9 μm long). The terminal plates were connected in the middle with the band-like portion of the protrusions like the board of a seesaw (tilting board). The terminal plates of adjacent protrusions were neatly arranged in a hexagonal pattern resembling tiles on a roof. Together, they formed an outer roof-like layer facing the surrounding cytoplasm of the host cell and completely covering the band-like proximal portion of the protrusions, which overlapped and were stacked in three to four layers close to the cyst surface. The sarcocyst morphology of S. linearis was consistent with that of an unnamed Sarcocystis sp. in roe deer previously found by transmission electron microscopy in several countries, including Italy. A few sarcocysts of S. gracilis and S. silva were also examined by SEM, confirming the presence of regularly distributed, short knob-like protrusions in S. gracilis (as seen in previous SEM studies) and revealing tightly packed, erect 6–7-μm-long villus-like protrusions having regularly distributed round depressions on their surface in S. silva. The sequencing of cox1 of 7, 24 and 27 new isolates of S. capreolicanis, S. gracilis and S. silva, respectively, recovered 7, 11 and 10 new haplotypes from each of the three species and expanded our knowledge on the intraspecific sequence variation at this marker. Similarly, the study revealed a more extensive intragenomic sequence variation at the 18S rRNA gene of S. capreolicanis and S. silva than known from previous studies and confirmed a near absence of such variation in the 18S rRNA gene of S. gracilis. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Usutu (USUV) and West Nile (WNV) are mosquito-borne Flavivirus emerged in Italy in 1996 and 1998, respectively, and reappeared 10 years later. The aim of this work is to review the Italian mosquito species found positive for WNV and USUV between 2008 and 2014. Moreover, the role of mosquitoes in promoting the overwintering of these viruses is discussed, as a result of the mosquito collections performed in Molise region between September 2010 and April 2011. Overall 99,000 mosquitoes were collected: 337 and 457 mosquito pools tested positive by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (real time RT-PCR) for WNV and USUV, respectively. West Nile virus was detected in pools of Culex pipiens s.l. (329), Ochlerotatus caspius (4), Culex modestus (2), and Culex spp. (2). Positive USUV pools were from Cx. pipiens s.l. (435), Aedes albopictus (12), Oc. caspius (5), Culex spp. (2), Anopheles maculipennis s.l. (1), Culiseta annulata (1), and Ochlerotatus detritus (1). In Molise region, 1,694 mosquitoes were collected, and USUV was identified in Cx. pipiens s.l., Cs. annulata, and Oc. detritus pools. This paper shows that Cx. pipiens s.l. is the mosquito species most involved in the WNV and USUV circulation in Italy, although other species would also support the spread of both the viruses during Winter. © Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell’Abruzzo e del Molise 2017.},

abstract={The possibility of using genetic control strategies to increase disease resistance to infectious diseases relies on the identification of markers to include in the breeding plans. Possible incomplete exposure of mastitis-free (control) animals, however, is a major issue to find relevant markers in genetic association studies for infectious diseases. Usually, designs based on elite dairy sires are used in association studies, but an epidemiological case-control strategy, based on cows repeatedly field-tested could be an alternative for disease traits. To test this hypothesis, genetic association results obtained in the present work from a cohort of Italian Holstein cows tested for mastitis over time were compared with those from a previous genome-wide scan on Italian Holstein sires genotyped with 50k single nucleotide polymorphisms for de-regressed estimated breeding values for somatic cell counts (SCCs) on Bos taurus autosome (BTA6) and BTA14. A total of 1121 cows were selected for the case-control approach (cases=550, controls=571), on a combination of herd level of SCC incidence and of within herd individual level of SCC. The association study was conducted on nine previously identified markers, six on BTA6 and four on BTA14, using the R statistical environment with the 'qtscore' function of the GenABEL package, on high/low adjusted linear score as a binomial trait. The results obtained in the cow cohort selected on epidemiological information were in agreement with those obtained from the previous sire genome-wide association study (GWAS). Six out of the nine markers showed significant association, four on BTA14 (rs109146371, rs109234250, rs109421300, rs109162116) and two on BTA6 (rs110527224 and rs42766480). Most importantly, using mastitis as a case study, the current work further validated the alternative use of historical field disease data in case-control designs for genetic analysis of infectious diseases in livestock. © 2016 The Animal Consortium.},

abstract={Demineralized bone matrix (DBM) is a natural, collagen-based, osteoinductive biomaterial. Nevertheless, there are conflicting reports on the efficacy of this product. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether DBM collagen structure is affected by particle size and can influence DBM cytocompatibility and osteoinductivity. Sheep cortical bone was ground and particles were divided in three fractions with different sizes, defined as large (L, 1–2 mm), medium (M, 0.5–1 mm), and small (S, <0.5 mm). After demineralization, the chemical–physical analysis clearly showed a particle size-dependent alteration in collagen structure, with DBM-M being altered but not as much as DBM-S. DBM-M displayed a preferable trend in almost all biological characteristics tested, although all DBM particles revealed an optimal cytocompatibility. Subcutaneous implantation of DBM particles into immunocompromised mice resulted in bone induction only for DBM-M. When sheep MSC were seeded onto particles before implantation, all DBM particles were able to induce new bone formation with the best incidence for DBM-M and DBM-S. In conclusion, the collagen alteration in DBM-M is likely the best condition to promote bone induction in vivo. Furthermore, the choice of 0.5–1 mm particles may enable to obtain more efficient and consistent results among different research groups in bone tissue-engineering applications. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract={Listeria monocytogenes causes invasive syndromes with high fatality rates in specific population groups. Cheeses have been commonly implicated in outbreaks worldwide. Gorgonzola is a cheese only produced in Northwestern Italy (it is the third Italian cheese in terms of production and export) and L. monocytogenes is frequently isolated from the production chain. The aims of this study were to assess the distribution of L. monocytogenes Virulence Types (VTs) in isolates collected in Gorgonzola processing plants and to determine the presence of Epidemic Clones (ECs). Fifty-Six L. monocytogenes strains collected between 2004 and 2016 from cheese and environmental samples were subtyped with Multi-Virulence-Locus Sequence Typing (MVLST) and compared to previously typed strains. Most isolates (n = 50) belonged to two new VTs (VT113 and VT114). The remaining isolates belonged to previously identified VTs: VT14-ECVIII (milk chocolate outbreak, 1994, USA) and VT80 (ricotta salata outbreak, 2012, USA). VT14, VT80 and VT113 were shared with isolates from apparently sporadic human cases in the same geographical area and temporal period (Piedmont and Lombardy, 2005–2016). The overall L. monocytogenes population appears to be homogeneous and may be characteristic of Gorgonzola production. Nevertheless, the detection in cheese and environmental samples of VTs observed in clinical isolates or outbreak related strains (VT80, VT14) contributed to better describe the current scenario and pointed out the need for increased surveillance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The rising prevalence of celiac disease leads to an increased demand of “gluten-free” products. A survey study on the gluten content and on the microbiological quality of “gluten-free” flour, and processing flour products, was carried out from 2010 to 2015 in Northern Italy. Overall 12,419 samples were analyzed, and 94.7% contained a gluten concentration less than 5 mg kg −1 (lower limit of detection). Only 0.1% of samples showed a gluten concentration above 80 mg kg −1 (maximum limit of detection). In the remaining 5.2%, the gluten concentration was between 5 and 80 mg kg −1 , underlining how a gluten-free diet completely devoid of gluten is unrealistic. The microbiological quality of these products was investigated. Overall, the majority of samples revealed microbial loads of less than 1 l g CFU g −1 (lower limit of detection). High levels of spoilage bacteria were found in egg-containing products. Total mesophilic bacteria were counted in all analyzed food categories with concentrations up to about 6, 8 and 9 l g CFU g −1 in dry pasta, flours and egg products respectively. Listeria monocytogenes was found only in one sample, whereas Salmonella spp. was never found. Buckwheat flour was the most frequently contaminated product by presumptive Bacillus cereus, with a prevalence of 12.5%. Also, a contamination by Coagulase-Positive Staphylococci was found during this investigation, especially in buckwheat dry pasta and flour and in egg dry pasta, with a prevalence of 54.7%. This study aimed to enhance the knowledge about the “gluten-free” products which are still poorly studied, even if their impact on the food market is increasingly considerable. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The calicivirus Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is widely used in Australia as a biocontrol agent to manage wild European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) populations. However, widespread herd immunity limits the effectiveness of the currently used strain, CAPM V-351. To overcome this, we developed an experimental platform for the selection and characterisation of novel RHDV strains. As RHDV does not replicate in cell culture, variant viruses were selected by serially passaging a highly virulent RHDV field isolate in immunologically naïve laboratory rabbits that were passively immunised 18-24 hours post-challenge with a neutralising monoclonal antibody. After seven passages, two amino acid substitutions in the P2 domain of the capsid protein became fixed within the virus population. Furthermore, a synonymous substitution within the coding sequence of the viral polymerase appeared and was also maintained in all subsequent passages. These findings demonstrate proof-of-concept that RHDV evolution can be experimentally manipulated to select for virus variants with altered phenotypes, in this case partial immune escape. © 2017 Hall et al.

abstract={Essential oils (EOs) have deserved much attention in the past decades for their antimicrobial activity, since many of them have demonstrated efficacy against food-borne pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms. Moreover, they have potential application in animal nutrition as multifunctional feed supplements, avoiding or diminishing the use of antibiotics in livestock. However, low solubility and bioavailability as well as volatility and marked aromatic note are important limitations in food and feed applications. In this study we present the synthesis, characterization and evaluation of the antibacterial activity of new thymol, carvacrol and menthol derivatives. The new compounds have been designed to overcome the limitations of the precursors, such as poor water solubility and volatility, still maintaining a good antimicrobial profile. We evaluated the activity of the synthetized compounds against pathogens causing important foodborne diseases, i.e. Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis and Escherichia coli. The low MICs and MBCs values for some of the studied compounds, combined with water solubility and negligible cytotoxicity towards HT-29 human cells, confirmed the potential use for EOs derivatives in the food industry. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Purpose. In 2013/2014, Italy experienced one of the largest community-wide prolonged outbreaks of hepatitis A virus (HAV) throughout the country. The article provides a comprehensive description of the outbreak and the investigation carried out by a multidisciplinary National Task Force, in collaboration with regional and local public health authorities. Control strategies of food-borne HAV infection in both the human and food sectors are also described. Methodology. Enhanced human epidemiological and microbiological surveillance together with microbiological monitoring of HAV in food and trace-back investigation were conducted. Results. A total of 1803 HAV cases were identified from 1 January 2013 to 31 August 2014, in Italy. Sequencing was possible for 368 cases (20.4 %), mostly collected between 1 January 2013 and 28 February 2014, and 246 cases (66.8 %) harboured an HAV outbreak strain. Imported frozen berries contaminated with HAV were identified as the vehicle of the outbreak which also involved many other European countries in 2013 and 2014. Epidemiological evidence obtained through a case-control study was supported by the finding of a 100% nucleotide similarity of the VP1/2A sequences of HAVs detected in human and food samples. Trace-back investigation revealed an extremely complex supplying network with no possibility for a point source potentially explaining the vast contamination of berries found in Italy. Conclusion. The investigation benefited from an excellent collaboration among different sectors who shared proactively the available information. Our findings highlight the importance of considering frozen berries among the highest risk factors for HAV. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={Background: Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a neglected parasitic zoonosis with considerable socioeconomic impact on affected pastoral communities. CE is endemic throughout the Mediterranean, including Morocco, where the Mid Atlas is the most prevalent area for both human and animal infection. The highest hospital annual incidence of human CE is recorded in the provinces of Ifrane and El Hajeb. However, hospital-based statistics likely underestimate the real prevalence of infection, as a proportion of cases never reach medical attention or official records. Methodology/Principal findings: In 2012, a project on clinical management of CE in Morocco was launched with the aims of estimating the prevalence of human abdominal CE in selected rural communes of the above mentioned provinces using ultrasound (US) screening and training local physicians to implement US-based focused assessment and rational clinical management of CE according to the WHO-IWGE Expert Consensus. A total of 5367 people received abdominal US during four campaigns in April-May 2014. During the campaigns, 24 local general practitioners received >24 hours of hands-on training and 143 health education sessions were organized for local communities. We found an overall CE prevalence of 1.9%, with significantly higher values in the rural communes of Ifrane than El Hajeb (2.6% vs 1.3%; p<0.001). CE cysts were predominantly in inactive stage, especially in older age groups. However, active cysts were present also in adults, indicating acquisition of infection at all ages. Province of residence was the only risk factor consistently associated with CE infection. Conclusions/Significance: Our results show a high prevalence and on-going, likely environmental transmission of CE in the investigated provinces of Morocco, supporting the implementation of control activities in the area by national health authorities and encouraging the acceptance and divulgation of diagnosis and treatment algorithms based on imaging for CE at both national and local level. © 2017 Chebli et al.},

abstract={The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) established an Emerging Risks Exchange Network (EREN) to exchange information between EFSA and the Member states (MSs) on possible emerging risks for food and feed safety in 2010. The Network is composed of delegates from MSs and Norway designated through the Advisory Forum of EFSA and observers from the European Commission, EU pre-accession countries, the Food and Drug Administration of the USA and the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations. Through 2010 to 2014, the EREN met 12 times. The EREN discussed a total of 63 signals of potential emerging issues that were presented and assessed using a standard template developed by the Emerging Risks unit of EFSA (EMRISK). Out of these signals, 39 originated from EFSA, 24 from MSs. The issues discussed were mainly microbiological and chemical hazards, but also food safety issues as result of illegal activity, new consumer consumption trends, biotoxins, new technologies and processes, allergens, animal health, environmental pollution, new analytical methods, new food packaging technology and unknown hazards were on the agenda. Based on the available evidence, EREN recommended whether an issue should be considered emerging or not, and if it merited further consideration, such as generating data on the issue, starting a full risk assessment and/or consultation of other bodies. According to the emerging risks identification process set in place at EFSA, the issues discussed and found of relevance by EREN were sent to the EFSA's Scientific Committee Standing Working Group on Emerging Risks for final evaluation. With four case studies, i.e the zoonotic potential of Usutu virus, risk of ciguatera fish poisoning in EU, zoonotic aspects of illegally imported wildlife products and benefits and risks of 3D food printing, the method developed to preliminary assess signals of potential emerging issues is presented and discussed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Androgens, the main male sex steroids, are the critical factors responsible for the development of the male phenotype during embryogenesis and for the achievement of sexual maturation and puberty. In adulthood, androgens remain essential for the maintenance of male reproductive function and behavior. Androgens, acting through the androgen receptor (AR), regulate male sexual differentiation during development, sperm production beginning from puberty, and maintenance of prostate homeostasis. Several substances present in the environment, now classified as endocrine disruptors (EDCs), strongly interfere with androgen actions in reproductive and non-reproductive tissues. EDCs are a heterogeneous group of xenobiotics which include synthetic chemicals used as industrial solvents/lubricants, plasticizers, additives, agrochemicals, pharmaceutical agents, and polyphenols of plant origin. These compounds are even present in the food as components (polyphenols) or food/water contaminants (pesticides, plasticizers used as food packaging) rendering the diet as the main route of exposure to EDCs for humans. Although huge amount of literature reports the (anti)estrogenic effects of different EDCs, relatively scarce information is available on the (anti)androgenic effects of EDCs. Here, the effects and mechanism of action of phytochemicals and pesticides and plasticizers as possible modulators of AR activities will be reviewed taking into account that insight derived from principles of endocrinology are required to estimate EDC consequences on endocrine deregulation and disease. © 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: Two main genetic groups (B.12 and B.FTNF002-00) of Francisella tularensis ssp. holarctica are endemic in Europe. The B.FTNF002-00 group proved to be dominant in Western European countries, while strains of the B.12 group were isolated mainly in Northern, Central and Eastern Europe. The clinical course of tularemia in the European brown hare (Lepus europaeus) also shows distinct patterns according to the geographical area. Acute course of the disease is observed in hares in Western European countries, while signs of sub-acute or chronic infection are more frequently detected in the eastern part of the continent. The aim of the present study was to examine whether there is any difference in the virulence of the strains belonging to the B.FTNF002-00 and B.12 genetic clades. Results: Experimental infection of Fischer 344 rats was performed by intra-peritoneal injection of three dilutions of a Hungarian (B.12 genotype) and an Italian (B.FTNF002-00 genotype) F. tularensis ssp. holarctica strain. Moderate difference was observed in the virulence of the two genotypes. Significant differences were observed in total weight loss values and scores of clinical signs between the two genotypes with more rats succumbing to tularemia in groups infected with the B.FTNF002-00 genotype. Conclusions: Results of the experimental infection are consistent with previous clinical observations and pathological studies suggesting that F. tularensis ssp. holarctica genotype B.FTNF002-00 has higher pathogenic potential than the B.12 genotype. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={A questionnaire survey about on farm dairy cow mortality was carried out among veterinary practitioners in Italy between January 2013 and May 2014. The study aimed at investigating the main circumstances of death in dairy cows (euthanasia, emergency slaughter or unassisted death), the primary causes and the risk factors of death. Out of 251 dead cows involved (across 137 farms), 54.6% died assisted and 45.4% were found dead. The main causes of death were metabolic/digestive disorders (22.3%) and mastitis/udder problems (17.1%), while in 14.7% of all cases, reasons of death were unknown. From the univariable generalised linear mixed models, dry cows showed a significantly higher odds to die unassisted compared to lactating cows (OR = 3.2); dry cows also had higher odds of dying from unknown reasons (OR = 11.7). Season was not significantly related to the risk of dying unassisted and for unknown reasons, but during the summer (characterised by hot and muggy weather in Northern Italy) cows died mostly for problems at calving. 54.2% of cows died during the first 30 days in milk (DIM). Half of the multiparous cows that died, died in the first 29.5 DIM, while half of the primiparous cows that died, died in the first 50 DIM. Results pointed out that, especially in dry cows, around calving and during the summer, some failure in management practices and daily inspections may occur. Improvements should be done in monitoring activities and in recognising early symptoms of diseases among stockperson. In addition, in case of diagnosed diseases with poor prognosis, euthanasia procedures should be implemented to prevent cows from dying unassisted. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The use of methodologies, including X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry, for direct analysis of solid food samples has increased over the last few years. Among XRF techniques, total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) is preferred, having higher sensitivity and a limit of detection at the nanogram level. TXRF is a variation of energy dispersive XRF spectrometry (EDXRF). It differs from EDXRF mainly in the experimental setup geometry. An angle lower than 0.1° is required in TXRF to obtain the reflection of the whole beam on the reflector, instead of the conventional angle of 45°. TXRF is primarily used for chemical micro and trace analyses. For these purposes, small quantities, mostly solutions and suspensions, are deposited on optical flat reflectors.},

abstract={Seven hundred seventy-eight samples of packaged smoked fish (774 smoked salmon and 4 smoked swordfish) on sale in Italy, from 50 different manufacturers located in 12 European Union countries, were purchased from the Italian market between May and December 2011. The surface temperatures of the samples on sale ranged from 0 to 13°C (3.4 ± 1.5°C, mean ± SD). Six hundred eighty (87.4%) of 778 samples were stored at ≤4°C. One hundred fifty-seven samples (20.2%, 95% confidence interval 17.5 to 23.1%) were contaminated by Listeria monocytogenes, with 26 samples (3.3%, 95% confidence interval 2.3 to 4.8%) at levels &gt;100 CFU/g. The maximum level of contamination was 1.3×10 6 CFU/g. The differences in the level of contamination of smoked fish between countries (χ 2 = 91.54, P &lt; 0.05) and manufacturers (χ 2 = 193.22, P &lt; 0.05) were significant. The frequency of detection for products from different manufacturing premises ranged from 0 to 76.9%. Serotyping by serological agglutination revealed that the main serotypes detected were 1/2a (65.3%) and 1/2b (22.4%). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing with restriction enzymes AscI and ApaI yielded 36 pulsotypes from 144 isolates, clustering into 17 groups. Eight main pulsotypes accounted for 70.8% of the isolates. Three of the main pulsotypes were exclusively from products of a single manufacturer. In general, products from the same manufacturer showed genetic homogeneity, with one strongly prevalent pulsotype. Different manufacturers usually showed very different levels of contamination of the final product, confirming the importance of the management of process hygiene for controlling L. monocytogenes contamination. © 2017 International Association for Food Protection.},

abstract={Background: Staphylococcus aureus (Staph. aureus) is one of the major pathogens causing mastitis in dairy ruminants worldwide. The chronic nature of Staph. aureus infection enhances the contagiousness risk and diffusion in herds. In order to identify the factors involved in intra-mammary infection (IMI) and diffusion in dairy cows, we investigated the molecular characteristics of two groups of Staph. aureus strains belonging to ST8 and ST398, differing in clinical properties, through comparison of whole genome and whole transcriptome sequencing. Results: The two groups of strains, one originated from high IMI prevalence herds and the other from low IMI prevalence herds, present a peculiar set of genes and polymorphisms related to phenotypic features, such as bacterial invasion of mammary epithelial cells and host adaptation. Transcriptomic analysis supports the high propensity of ST8 strain to chronicity of infection and to a higher potential cytotoxicity. Conclusions: Our data are consistent with the invasiveness and host adaptation feature for the strains GTB/ST8 associated to high within-herd prevalence of mastitis. Variation in genes coding for surface exposed proteins and those associated to virulence and defence could constitute good targets for further research. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Infectious bronchitis is considered to be one of the most devastating diseases in poultry. Control of its spread is typically attempted through biosecurity measures and extensive vaccination. However, the remarkable genetic and antigenic variability of the virus, which originate from both mutations and recombination events, represents an unsolved challenge for this disease. The present study reports on the emergence and spread of recombinant clusters detected in Italy and Spain between 2012 and 2014. A total of 36 Spanish and Italian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) field strains were investigated and genetically characterized using phylogenetic, molecular, recombination and selection pressure analyses of the complete S1 gene. Based on the partial S1 sequencing, 27 IBV strains originating from Spain and nine from Italy were initially classified as being closely related to the Guandong/Xindadi (XDN) genotype. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete S1 gene revealed that the XDN strains formed a homogeneous clade with the Spanish IBV isolates within the QX genotype, whereas there was higher variability within the Italian strains. Recombination analysis determined that these strains belonged to four groups, which originated from independent recombination events between the QX and 793B IBV genotypes. Our data support the hypothesis of two different scenarios: firstly, in Spain, the large and homogeneous clade probably originated from a single offspring of the recombinant founder, which became dominant and spread throughout the country. Secondly, the nine Italian recombinants, which are characterized by three different recombination patterns, probably represent less fitted strains, because they were less viable with respect to their recombinant parents. © 2016 Houghton Trust Ltd.},

abstract={The demand for rapid methods for the quantification of pathogens is increasing. Among these methods, those based on nucleic acids amplification (quantitative PCRs) are the most widespread worldwide. Together with the qPCR, a new approach named digital PCR (dPCR), has rapidly gained importance. The aim of our study was to compare the results obtained using two different dPCR systems and one qPCR in the quantification of three different bacterial pathogens: Listeria monocytogenes, Francisella tularensis, and Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis. For this purpose, three pre-existing qPCRs were used, while the same primers and probes, as well as PCR conditions, were transferred to two different dPCR systems: the QX200 (Bio-Rad) and the Quant Studio 3D (Applied Biosystems). The limits of detection and limits of quantification for all pathogens, and all PCR approaches applied, were determined using genomic pure DNAs. The quantification of unknown decimal suspensions of the three bacteria obtained by the three different PCR approaches was compared through the Linear Regression and Bland and Altman analyses. Our results suggest that, both dPCRs are able to quantify the same amount of bacteria, while the comparison among dPCRs and qPCRs, showed both over and under-estimation of the bacteria present in the unknown suspensions. Our results showed qPCR over-estimated the amount of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis and F. tularensis cells. On the contrary, qPCR, compared to QX200 dPCR, under-estimated the amount of L. monocytogenes cells. However, the maximum difference among PCRs approaches was &lt; 0.5 Log10, while cultural methods underestimated the number of bacteria by one to two Log10 for Francisella tularensis and Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis. On the other hand, cultural and PCRs methods quantified the same amount of bacteria for L. monocytogenes, suggesting for this last pathogen, PCRs approaches can be considered as a valid alternative to the cultural ones. © 2017 Ricchi, Bertasio, Boniotti, Vicari, Russo, Tilola, Bellotti and Bertasi.},

abstract={Introduction - Milk and dairy products are considered an important source of fatty acids in the diet that varies in quantity according to the methods of bovine rearing and feeding. In the last decades, evaluation of the fatty acid composition in bovine milk has been the subject of several studies for the beneficial effects on human health. The aim of this study is to quantify satured and unsatured fatty acids by indirect estimation with Infrared spectroscopy in bovine bulk tank milk samples collected in typical mountain farms, in particular to confirm the effect of pasture period on the milk composition. Materials and methods - The 189 milk samples were collected from 37 dairy farms representative of the typical "farm" in a mountainous area of North Italy (Valle Camonica): small (12 heads/farm on average), prevalence of Brown Alpine and Red Piebald, low production level (about 16 Lt/head/die), mainly fed with local hay, integration of feedstuffs under 30% of the feed ration, without maize silage. The samples were collected directly from farms (first period, April-May 2015) or from pasture areas (second period, June- July 2015). Results and discussion - Our observations confirm the change in milk composition related to the grazing period as well with the increased content in fat and unsatured fatty acids and, in particular, the "grazing effect" was statistically confirmed by a significant increase in the unsatured/satured fatty acids ratio: 0.42 (SD 0.025) in farms vs 0.57 (SD 0.048) in pasture areas, as already highlighted by other studies made with reference method. Conclusions - The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analytical method, easy to use and cheap, although the indirect evaluation of the milk composition, produces results and information useful to support the quality of milk and milk products in mountain areas, also for larger projects in the future.},

abstract={Aims: The aim of the study was to explore the suitability of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for a rapid and correct identification of Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP) field isolates. Methods and Results: MALDI-TOF MS approach is becoming one of the most popular tests for the identification of intact bacterial cells which has been shown to be fast and reliable. For this purpose, 36 MAP field isolates were analysed through MALDI-TOF MS and the spectra compared with two different databases: one provided by the vendor of the system employed (Biotyper ver. 3·0; Bruker Daltonics) and a homemade database containing spectra from both tuberculous and nontuberculous Mycobacteria. Moreover, principal component analysis procedure was employed to confirm the ability of MALDI-TOF MS to discriminate between very closely related subspecies. Our results suggest MAP can be differentiated from other Mycobacterium species, both when the species are very close (M. intracellulare) and when belonging to different subspecies (M. avium ssp. avium and M. avium ssp. silvaticum). Conclusions: The procedure applied is fast, easy to perform, and achieves an earlier accurate species identification of MAP and nontuberculous Mycobacteria in comparison to other procedures. Significance and Impact of the Study: The gold standard test for the diagnosis of paratuberculosis is still isolation of MAP by cultural methods, but additional assays, such as qPCR and subculturing for determination of mycobactin dependency are required to confirm its identification. We have provided here evidence pertaining to the usefulness of MALDI-TOF MS approach for a rapid identification of this mycobacterium among other members of M. avium complex. © 2016 The Society for Applied Microbiology},

abstract={Head space (HS) solid phase microextraction (SPME) followed by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry detection (GC-MS) is the most widespread technique to study the volatile profile of honey samples. In this paper, the experimental SPME conditions were optimized by a multivariate strategy. Both sensitivity and repeatability were optimized by experimental design techniques considering three factors: extraction temperature (from 50°C to 70°C), time of exposition of the fiber (from 20 min to 60 min), and amount of salt added (from 0 to 27.50%). Each experiment was evaluated by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) that allows to take into consideration all the analytes at the same time, preserving the information about their different characteristics. Optimal extraction conditions were identified independently for signal intensity (extraction temperature: 70°C; extraction time: 60 min; salt percentage: 27.50% w/w) and repeatability (extraction temperature: 50°C; extraction time: 60 min; salt percentage: 27.50% w/w) and a final global compromise (extraction temperature: 70°C; extraction time: 60 min; salt percentage: 27.50% w/w) was also reached. Considerations about the choice of the best internal standards were also drawn. The whole optimized procedure was than applied to the analysis of a multiflower honey sample and more than 100 compounds were identified. © 2017 Elisa Robotti et al.},

abstract={Background: Antimicrobial resistance is a growing threat to public health. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a relevant pathogen causing human and animal infections, frequently displaying high levels of resistance to commonly used antimicrobials. The increasing difficulty to develop new effective antibiotics have discouraged investment in this area and only a few new antibiotics are currently under development. An approach to overcome antibiotic resistance could be based on antimicrobial peptides since they offer advantages over currently used microbicides. Methods: The antimicrobial activity of the synthetic peptide AMP2041 was evaluated against 49 P. aeruginosa clinical strains with high levels of antimicrobial resistance, isolated from humans (n = 19) and animals (n = 30). In vitro activity was evaluated by a microdilution assay for lethal dose 90% (LD 90 ), while the activity over time was performed by time-kill assay with 12.5 µg/ml of AMP2014. Evidences for a direct membrane damage were investigated on P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 reference strain, on animal isolate PA-VET 38 and on human isolate PA-H 24 by propidium iodide and on P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 by scanning electron microscopy. Results: AMP2041 showed a dose-dependent activity, with a mean (SEM) LD 90 of 1.69 and 3.3 µg/ml for animal and human strains, respectively. AMP2041 showed microbicidal activity on P. aeruginosa isolates from a patient with cystic fibrosis (CF) and resistance increased from first infection isolate (LD 90 = 0.3 μg/ml) to the mucoid phenotype (LD 90 = 10.4 μg/ml). The time-kill assay showed a time-dependent bactericidal effect of AMP2041 and LD 90 was reached within 20 min for all the strains. The stain-dead assay showed an increasing of membrane permeabilization and SEM analysis revealed holes, dents and bursts throughout bacterial cell wall after 30 min of incubation with AMP2041. Conclusions: The obtained results assessed for the first time the good antimicrobial activity of AMP2041 on P. aeruginosa strains of human origin, including those deriving from a CF patient. We confirmed the excellent antimicrobial activity of AMP2041 on P. aeruginosa strains derived from dog otitis. We also assessed that AMP2041 antimicrobial activity is linked to changes of the P. aeruginosa cell wall morphology and to the increasing of membrane permeability. © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={Brown hares have undergone a substantial population decline in Europe during recent decades, caused by, among other factors, the occurrence of European Brown Hare Syndrome (EBHS). To improve our knowledge regarding EBHS epidemiology, we developed a mathematical model that takes into consideration both brown hare biology and the infection dynamics of the EBHS virus (EBHSV). The model consists of eight ordinary differential equations simulating the spread of the virus in a closed hare population. Simulations showed that EBHSV’s transmission has complex dynamics, which are strongly affected by the hare density. In particular, a density threshold of 7 individuals/km2 was identified, determining two opposite epidemiological patterns: the extinction of the EBHSV below the threshold and its endemic stability when the hare population density is above the threshold, with a seroprevalence proportional to the population density. The model was validated using serological data collected in different areas in the province of Brescia (Northern Italy). The results suggested that the maintenance of the endemic circulating viral level through density control mechanisms is the best strategy for reducing EBHS’s impact. © 2017, Associazione Teriologica Italiana onlus.

abstract={Introduction-Bovine papillomatosis is an infectious disease distributed worldwide among cattle herds consisting of hyperproliferative lesions affecting cutaneous tissue and mucosa. The disease, known as papillomas, may occur in different part of the body. Bovine papillomaviruses (BPVs) are non-enveloped double stranded DNA viruses belonging to the Papillomaviridae family, a group of viruses that infect all amniotes. Despite the benign characters of the lesions, in some cases bovine papillomatosis may dramatically reduce the productive performances when the lesions are extensive over the body involving teats and udders. Aim-This work was particularly aimed at the identification and characterization of BPVs circulating in Sicily in order to obtain autovaccine against BPVs. Material and methods-Thirty-one epithelial lesions, collected from cattle, clinically diagnosed as papillomas, were referred to the Laboriatories of Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale of Sicily. Samples were analyzed by electron microscopy, PCR amplification, Rolling Circle Amplification, sequencing, negative staining electronic microscopy and standard histological examinations. Results and discussion-The investigation revealed the presence of different BPV types 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, mostly in the form of co-infections. Besides BPV amplification, zoonotic viruses belonging to the genus parapoxvirus within the Poxviridae family were screened and detected in 11 samples. This is the first study performed in Sicily, reporting a wide diversity of BPV genera and types circulating in the territory. Conclusion-The data collected showed the necessity of proper diagnosis to produce an effective vaccine while virus characterization is important to know the epidemiological scenario of the region and set appropriate control measures and reliable diagnostic methods for bovine papillomatosis. The presence of co-infecting zoonotic viral agents underlies the need for a better understanding of the possible interactions between the two viruses and suggests the importance of identifying proper measures to prevent the infection to humans.},

abstract={Pasteurella multocida is a widespread pathogen associated with major animal diseases of economic significance. Despite this, little is known about the capsular types, virulence gene pattern, and antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates from hosts affected by different diseases, and no data are available in Italy. One hundred eighty six isolates of P. multocida, were taken from different species in different states of health in several Italian regions, and were tested for genes encoding for capsular types (cap) and major virulence factors (tbpA, toxA, hgbB and pfhA). Antimicrobial susceptibility was investigated with the agar diffusion test. The majority of isolates was capA+. However, the distribution differed according to species and disease of origin, with a greater heterogeneity in isolates from rabbits; capE was never found, while capB was detected once. Only capA+ and capF+ strains tested positive for pfhA. Conversely, almost all capD+ isolates were hgbB+. In bovine respiratory disease, pfhA+/tbpA+/capA+ isolates predominated, while tbpA+/toxA+/capD+ isolates predominated in sheep. Overall, low levels of resistance were found, with full susceptibility to ceftiofur and florfenicol. Lower susceptibility to older antimicrobials was recorded, since only approximately 1/3 of the isolates showed susceptibility to tylosin and erythromycin, and resistance to tetracycline (7.5%), and trimethoprim - sulphametoxazole (4.8%) was also observed. © 2017, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise "G.Caporale".

abstract={Animals’ exchanges are considered the most effective route of between-farm infectious disease transmission. However, despite being often overlooked, the infection spread due to contaminated equipment, vehicles, or personnel proved to be important for several livestock epidemics. This study investigated the role of indirect contacts in a potential infection spread in the dairy farm network of the Province of Parma (Northern Italy). We built between-farm contact networks using data on cattle exchange (direct contacts), and on-farm visits by veterinarians (indirect contacts). We compared the features of the contact structures by using measures on static and temporal networks. We assessed the disease spreading potential of the direct and indirect network structures in the farm system by using data on the infection state of farms by paratuberculosis. Direct and indirect networks showed non-trivial differences with respect to connectivity, contact distribution, and super-spreaders identification. Furthermore, our analyses on paratuberculosis data suggested that the contributions of direct and indirect contacts on diseases spread are apparent at different spatial scales. Our results highlighted the potential role of indirect contacts in between-farm disease spread and underlined the need for a deeper understanding of these contacts to develop better strategies for prevention of livestock epidemics. © 2017 Rossi et al.},

abstract={The ability of live yeasts to modulate pig intestinal cell signals in response to infection with Escherichia coli F4ac (ETEC) has not been studied in-depth. The aim of this trial was to evaluate the effect of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-4407 (Sc), supplied at different times, on the transcriptome profile of the jejunal mucosa of pigs 24 h after infection with ETEC. In total, 20 piglets selected to be ETEC-susceptible were weaned at 24 days of age (day 0) and allotted by litter to one of following groups: control (CO), CO+colistin (AB), CO+5×1010 colony-forming unit (CFU) Sc/kg feed, from day 0 (PR) and CO+5×1010 CFU Sc/kg feed from day 7 (CM). On day 7, the pigs were orally challenged with ETEC and were slaughtered 24 h later after blood sampling for haptoglobin (Hp) and C-reactive protein (CRP) determination. The jejunal mucosa was sampled (1) for morphometry; (2) for quantification of proliferation, apoptosis and zonula occludens (ZO-1); (3) to carry out the microarray analysis. A functional analysis was carried out using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. The normalized enrichment score (NES) was calculated for each gene set, and statistical significance was defined when the False Discovery Rate % was &lt;25 and P-values of NES were &lt;0.05. The blood concentration of CRP and Hp, and the score for ZO-1 integrity on the jejunal villi did not differ between groups. The intestinal crypts were deeper in the AB (P=0.05) and the yeast groups (P&lt;0.05) than in the CO group. Antibiotic treatment increased the number of mitotic cells in intestinal villi as compared with the control group (P&lt;0.05). The PR group tended to increase the mitotic cells in villi and crypts and tended to reduce the cells in apoptosis as compared with the CM group. The transcriptome profiles of the AB and PR groups were similar. In both groups, the gene sets involved in mitosis and in mitochondria development ranked the highest, whereas in the CO group, the gene sets related to cell junction and anion channels were affected. In the CM group, the gene sets linked to the metabolic process, and transcription ranked the highest; a gene set linked with a negative effect on growth was also affected. In conclusion, the constant supplementation in the feed with the strain of yeast tested was effective in counteracting the detrimental effect of ETEC infection in susceptible pigs limits the early activation of the gene sets related to the impairment of the jejunal mucosa. © 2016 The Animal Consortium.},

abstract={Sporadic outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) have occurred in Libya for almost fifty years. During the spring of 2013, a countrywide serosurvey was undertaken to assess the level of FMD virus circulation and identify FMD virus serotypes in the country. A total of 4221 sera were collected, comprising samples from large ruminants (LR; n=1428 samples from 357 farms) and small ruminants (SR; n=2793 samples from 141 farms). FMD sero-prevalence of NSP antibodies determined by ELISA were 19.0% (271/1428) with 95% CI (16.9 – 21.0) and 13.5% (378/2793) with 95% CI (12.3 – 14.8) for LR and SR samples, respectively. The sero-prevalence of NSP antibodies in LR was 12.3% and 19.8% for age group &lt; 1 year and ≥ 1 year, respectively (X2= 4.95, P= 0.026), while in SR was 3.7%, 13.6% and 21.3% for age group &lt; 1 year, 1-2 year and &gt; 2 year, respectively (X2 = 118.1, P= 0.000). These observed NSP serologic profiles support the hypothesis of an endemic level of FMD circulation in Libya. All positive sera were tested for SP antibodies for O, A and SAT-2 FMD virus serotypes. Serotype O was the dominant circulating serotype followed by serotype A, while evidence of SAT-2 was not found. These data provide an insight into the wider epidemiology of FMD in Libya, and contribute to field and laboratory investigations that during 2013 serotype O (O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 lineage) was isolated from clinical samples collected from the country. © 2017, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tripoli and National Authority for Scientific Research.

abstract={Early detection of animal diseases is one of the primary aims of epidemiosurveillance networks in western and central Africa. A sufficiently high sensitivity is an essential characteristic of an epidemiosurveillance network. Foot and-mouth-disease (FMD) is a highly contagious viral disease that affects all artiodactyla. It is included in the list of diseases monitored by the national animal disease epidemiosurveillance network (REPIMAT) in Chad. Surveillance of this disease is passive and primarily concerns bovine. Numerous bovine clinical suspicions are raised annually by the epidemiosurveillance network, but they are only rarely further investigated in the laboratory. A serological survey was conducted in the cattle population in eight of the nine administrative regions of the country (regions with the highest bovine densities) with the aim to evaluate the sensitivity of REPIMAT for FMD. The samples randomly selected were analysed in the OIE/FAO FMD reference laboratory at IZSLER, Brescia (Italy) with the support of EuFMD (The European Commission for the control of foot-and-mouth disease). Antibodies against non-structural proteins (NSP), indicative of recent or past infection, were analysed by a 3ABC-ELISA. A total of 106 villages/herds and 796 cattle were investigated. The herd-level seroprevalence was 63% (95% CI: 51.9-71.2) and the animal-level seroprevalence was 35.6% (95% CI: 32.2- 39.0). A global significant positive relation was found between the estimated seroprevalence and the number of registered clinical suspicions. However, this relation is weak but heterologous and this could lead to an improvement of the declaration of FMD suspicions in some administrative regions where some correctives measures could be introduced. © 2017 L'Association pour l'Etude de l'Epidemiologie des Maladies Animales.

abstract={Electrospray Ionization and collision induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry are usually employed to obtain compound identification through a mass spectra match. Different algorithms have been developed for this purpose (for example the nist match algorithm). These approaches compare the tandem mass spectra of the unknown analyte with the tandem mass spectra spectra of known compounds inserted in a database. The compounds are usually identified on the basis of spectral match value associated with a probability of recognition. However, this approach is not usually applied to multiple reaction monitoring transition spectra achieved by means of triple quadrupole apparatus, mainly due to the lack of a transition spectra database. The Surface Activated Chemical Ionization-Electrospray-NIST Bayesian model database search (SANIST) platform has been recently developed for new potential metabolite biomarker discovery, to confirm their identity and to use them for clinical and diagnostic applications. Here, we present an improved version of the SANIST platform that extends its application to forensic, pharmaceutical, and food analysis studies, where the compound identification rules are strict. The European Union (EU) has set directives for compound identification (EU directive 2002/657/EC). We have applied the SANIST method to identification of 11-nor-9-carboxytetrahydro-cannabinol in urine samples (an example of a forensic application), circulating levels of the immunosuppressive drug tacrolimus in blood (an example of a pharmaceutical application) and glyphosate in fruit juice (an example of a food analysis application) that meet the EU directive requirements.

abstract={Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has caused extensive economic losses to pig producers in many countries. It was recently introduced, for the first time, into North America and outbreaks have occurred again in multiple countries within Europe as well. To assess the properties of various diagnostic assays for the detection of PEDV infection, multiple panels of porcine sera have been shared and tested for the presence of antibodies against PEDV in an inter-laboratory ring trial. Different laboratories have used a variety of “in house” ELISAs and also one commercial assay. The sensitivity and specificity of each assay has been estimated using a Bayesian analysis applied to the ring trial results obtained with the different assays in the absence of a gold standard. Although different characteristics were found, it can be concluded that each of the assays used can detect infection of pigs at a herd level by either the early European strains of PEDV or the recently circulating strains (INDEL and non-INDEL). However, not all the assays seem suitable for demonstrating freedom from disease in a country. The results from individual animals, especially when the infection has occurred within an experimental situation, show more variation. © 2016},

abstract={Carnivores are potential carriers of agents that infect their prey species, even though they themselves are not susceptible, such as the lagovirus that causes European brown hare syndrome (EBHS), a severe disease of brown hares endemic in Europe. During our wildlife surveillance in Lombardy, we identified an EBHS outbreak in a protected area by both virological analyses (sandwich ELISA and RT-PCR) of the target organs from one dead hare and serological examinations (competitive ELISA) of captured animals. Since four red foxes were contemporarily hunted in the same area, we examined their organs by RT-PCR for the EBHS agent (EBHSv). The intestinal content of one fox tested positive, while the fox’ other organs (liver, spleen, and mesenteric lymph nodes), and all of the samples from the remaining three foxes, tested negative. Moreover, in the gastrointestinal content of the positive fox, we found food debris that was genetically identified as being of hare origin. The competitive ELISA test for EBHSv antibodies gave negative results in all of the fox sera. Genetic analyses of the EBHSv amplicons obtained by RT-PCR in the hare and the fox indicated a full homology (99.9 % nucleotide and 100 % amino acid identity). These results support the fact that red fox, as other predators, feeding on EBHSv infected hares may have genetic prints of the virus in their gut contents. Even if we did not prove that lagovirus particles remained infective in the excreted feces and, thus, contaminated the ground in the outbreak area, these eventualities cannot be excluded, and we could at least conclude that red foxes might assume a potential role in the indirect transmission of lagovirus, as EBHSv. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The Culex pipiens complex includes species with reported differences in vector competence for arthropod-borne viruses, many of which are of significant importance to human health such as the West Nile virus and the Sindbis virus. This group of mosquitoes is difficult to distinguish morphologically; particularly as adult females. In Europe, the two species of the complex, Culex pipiens Linnaeus 1758 and Culex torrentium Martini 1925, are often found sympatrically. With the aim to characterize the presence and spread of both species in the Emilia-Romagna region, Northern Italy, mosquitoes of the complex – collected during the West Nile virus surveillance plans – were tested by multiplex real-time PCR for the detection of the two species Cx. pipiens and Cx. torrentium. A total of 24 165 mosquitoes, collected between 2012 and 2014 from 105 sites, and sorted in 204 pools, were tested. All tested pools were found to be composed of Cx. pipiens, whereas Cx. torrentium was not detected. These results indicate a likely absence of Cx. torrentium mosquitoes within the surveyed territory, whereas Cx. pipiens is widely distributed in the area mentioned. This is in line with previous reports, which describe a pre-alpine distribution of Cx. torrentium in Italy. © 2016 The Royal Entomological Society},

abstract={The purpose of this study was to provide data on the disposition of stanozolol after bilateral intra-articular injection in the tarsal joints, to discover the length of time for which the drug can be detected in plasma after administration. Fourteen horses were included in the study. After aseptically preparing the injection site, 1 mL of an aqueous suspension containing 5 mg of stanozolol was injected into both the right and left tarsal joints of 12 horses; the two remaining animals were not treated and were used as a control group. Five milliliters of blood was collected immediately before stanozolol administration (t0) and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144, 156, and 168 hours after injection. The plasma concentration was determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) after solid phase extraction. The maximum plasma concentration was 1.7 ng/mL (range, 0.5–3.0 ng/mL), measured at 6 hours (range, 4–12 hours). The plasma elimination half life varied between 4 and 12 hours, whereas the plasma clearance per fraction of dose absorbed was in the 257.85–820.88 L/h range. The results of the present study make a preliminary contribution toward understanding the elimination profile of intra-articularly administered stanozolol in the horse. The drug passes rapidly into the systemic circulation, is eliminated rapidly, and is detected in plasma for no more than 36 hours after local administration. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has caused economic losses in the Americas, Asia and Europe in recent years. Reliable serological assays are essential for epidemiological studies and vaccine evaluation. The objective of this study was to compare the ability of five enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to detect antibodies against different PEDV strains in pig serum. A total of 732 serum samples from North American or European pigs were tested. Samples included experimental samples from pigs infected with classical (G1a PEDV) or variant genogroup 1 PEDV (G1b PEDV), pandemic genogroup 2 PEDV (G2b PEDV) or non-infected controls. Field samples from herds with confirmed or unknown PEDV exposure were also used. Three indirect ELISAs based on G2b antigens (ELISAs 1, 2 and 3), a competitive ELISA based on the G2b antigen (ELISA 4) and a competitive ELISA based on the G1a antigen (ELISA 5) were compared. Overall, the tests had a moderate agreement (κ = 0.61). G1a PEDV infected pigs were earliest detected by ELISA 3, G1b PEDV infected pigs were earliest detected by ELISAs 4 and 5 and the performance of all tests was similar for the G2b PEDV group. ELISA 1 showed the overall lowest detection on experimentally and field derived samples. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity with a 95% probability interval were estimated to be 68.2% (62.1–74.4%) and 97.5% (95.2–99.0%) for ELISA 1, 73.7% (71.5–79.6%) and 98.4% (96.6–99.5%) for ELISA 2, 86.2% (81.1–90.6%) and 91.6% (87.7–94.8%) for ELISA 3, 78.3% (72.8–83.5%) and 99.7% (98.2–100%) for ELISA 4, and 93.5% (90.3–96.0%) and 91.2% (83.8–97.9%) for ELISA 5. Differences in detection among assays seem to be more related to intrinsic factors of an assay than to the PEDV antigen used. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Staphylococcus aureus is a major agent of bovine mastitis in dairy herds, causing economic losses in dairy industry worldwide. In addition, milk and milk-products contaminated by Staph. aureus can cause harmful human diseases. The aim of this study was to characterize Staph. aureus strains isolated from dairy farms in Tunisia. Bulk tank milk (n = 32) and individual cow milk (n = 130) samples were collected during the period of 2013–2014. Forty-three Staph. aureus isolates were recovered and typed by spa typing, 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer (RS-PCR) and multiplex PCRs for 22 virulence genes. Antimicrobial resistance was also investigated with a disc diffusion test. A selected subsample of 22 strains was additionally genotyped by multilocus sequence typing. Seventeen spa types were recovered, and t2421 (n = 10), t521 (n = 6) and t2112 (n = 5) were the most common. Fourteen different RS-PCR genotypes grouped into 11 clusters were detected in our study, with predominance of the RVI genotype (n = 24). Eight sequence types were identified and Clonal Complex 97, corresponding to RS-PCR cluster R, was the most common (n = 10), followed by CC1 (n = 4), CC15 (n = 3) and other four accounting for one or two strains. Different combinations of virulence genes were reported, and enterotoxin genes were present in few strains (seh, n = 4; sea, n = 2; sea and seh, n = 2; sec and sel, n = 2). The majority of strains were resistant only to penicillin; only one strain was found to be multiresistant and no methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus was demonstrated. Our study reported the isolation of CC97 from bovine milk in Tunisia for the first time and confirmed the relevance of this lineage in intramammary infection in cows. Significance and Impact of the Study: This paper describes the characteristics of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from bulk tank and individual cow milk in Tunisia. All strains were genotyped by spa typing and RS-PCR, a method based on the amplification of the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region, and multiplex PCRs for 22 virulence genes. A selected subsample of strains was also genotyped by multilocus sequence typing. All strains were tested for antimicrobial resistance. Our study evidences a predominance of strains belonging to Clonal Complex 97. Methicillin-resistant strains were not detected, and overall low level of antimicrobial resistance was reported. © 2016 The Society for Applied Microbiology},

These viruses are known to reassort, and coinfection of the same cell is one of the prerequisites for reassortment. Here, a mammalian cell line was infected with various members of this virus group, inoculated after several time points with a second Simbu serogroup virus, and analyzed by strain or species specific immunofluorescence staining. Different virus species or different strains of the same virus species were able to co-infect mammalian cells, but only for a limited time frame. After a few hours, the replication of the first virus led to a gradual inhibition of a second virus until a complete resistance to superinfection after 24 h regardless whether it is another strain of the same virus species or a distinct member of the serogroup. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={African swine fever (ASF) is one of the most severe diseases of pigs; it has a drastic impact on the pig industry, causing serious socio-economic consequences to pig farmers and pork producers. In Europe, there are currently two main clusters of infection; one in Sardinia caused by strains of African swine fever virus (ASFV) belonging to genotype I and another in Eastern Europe caused by strains of ASFV belonging to genotype II. The latter is inducing an acute form of ASF and it represents a serious threat to the pig sector. ASF is a disease for which there is no effective vaccine; therefore, prevention has a pivotal role in the control strategy of the disease. This review describes the main preventive measures to adopt to mitigate the risk of ASF spread in pig farming systems. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: The Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) is a small, non enveloped, positive sense single-stranded RNA virus in the genus Cardiovirus, family Picornaviridae, with two known serotypes. It is spread worldwide and infects a huge range of vertebrate hosts with zoonotic potential for humans. The pig is the mammal most likely to be impacted on with the disease, but EMCV occurrence has also been reported in non-human primates and in a variety of domestic, captive and wild animals. Until now, human cases have been very rare and the risk appears to be almost negligible in spite of human susceptibility to the infection. Case presentation: Between September and November 2012 a fatal Encephalomyocarditis virus outbreak involving four Barbary macaques and 24 crested porcupines occurred at a rescue centre for wild and exotic animals in Central Italy. In this open-field zoo park located near Grosseto, Tuscany about 1000 animals belonging to different species, including various non-human primates were hosted at that time. Sudden deaths were generally observed without any evident symptoms or only with mild nonspecific clinical signs. The major gross change was characterised by grey-white necrotic foci in the myocardium and the same EMCV strain was isolated both in macaques and crested porcupines. Phylogenetic analysis has confirmed that only one EMCV strain is circulating in Italy, capable of infecting different animal species. Conclusions: This report confirms the susceptibility of non-human primates to the EMCV infection and describes the disease in porcupine, a common wild Italian and African species. No human cases were observed, but given the zoonotic potential of EMCV these findings are of importance in the context of animal-human interface. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) type 1 in Italy is characterized by high genetic diversity, with at least 20 subtypes. Subtype 1f is endemic in a restricted geographic area, meaning that it has local distribution. We investigated the population dynamics of BVDV-1f in Northern Italy and characterized the transmission chains of a subset of samples from Piedmont and Aosta Valley regions. A total of 51 samples from 1966 to 2013 were considered and 5′ UTR sequences were used for phylogeography. A subset of 12 samples was selected for Npro gene sequencing and further characterization of the transmission chains using both molecular and epidemiological data. Phylogeography estimated the root of BVDV-1f tree in Veneto in 1965. Four significant subclades included sequences clustering by region: Lombardy (n = 3), Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna (n = 7), Piedmont (n = 17), Piedmont and Aosta Valley (n = 21). The Piedmont-only subclade has a ladder-like branching structure, while the Piedmont and Aosta Valley subclade has a nearly complete binary structure. In the subset, the outbreak reconstruction identified one sample from Piedmont as the most probable source of infection for the Aosta Valley cases. An ad hoc questionnaire submitted to public veterinarians revealed connections between sampled and non-sampled farms by means of trades, exhibitions and markets. According to the phylogeography, BVDV-1f moved westward, entering from Veneto, and spreading to Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna in the early 1990s, and finally to Piedmont and Aosta Valley in the first decade of 2000s. Both phylogeographic analyses on the whole dataset and on the selection of Npro dataset pointed out that subtype 1f entered Aosta Valley from Piedmont. The integration of molecular and epidemiological data revealed connections between farms, and such approach should be considered in any control plan. In Aosta Valley, the study showed that BVDV1f can be controlled only monitoring the introduction of cattle from Piedmont region. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: A diversifying pool of mammalian-adapted influenza A viruses (IAV) with largely unknown zoonotic potential is maintained in domestic swine populations worldwide. The most recent human influenza pandemic in 2009 was caused by a virus with genes originating from IAV isolated from swine. Swine influenza viruses (SIV) are widespread in European domestic pig populations and evolve dynamically. Knowledge regarding occurrence, spread and evolution of potentially zoonotic SIV in Europe is poorly understood. Objectives: Efficient SIV surveillance programmes depend on sensitive and specific diagnostic methods which allow for cost-effective large-scale analysis. Methods: New SIV haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) subtype- and lineage-specific multiplex real-time RT-PCRs (RT-qPCR) have been developed and validated with reference virus isolates and clinical samples. Results: A diagnostic algorithm is proposed for the combined detection in clinical samples and subtyping of SIV strains currently circulating in Europe that is based on a generic, M-gene-specific influenza A virus RT-qPCR. In a second step, positive samples are examined by tetraplex HA- and triplex NA-specific RT-qPCRs to differentiate the porcine subtypes H1, H3, N1 and N2. Within the HA subtype H1, lineages “av” (European avian-derived), “hu” (European human-derived) and “pdm” (human pandemic A/H1N1, 2009) are distinguished by RT-qPCRs, and within the NA subtype N1, lineage “pdm” is differentiated. An RT-PCR amplicon Sanger sequencing method of small fragments of the HA and NA genes is also proposed to safeguard against failure of multiplex RT-qPCR subtyping. Conclusions: These new multiplex RT-qPCR assays provide adequate tools for sustained SIV monitoring programmes in Europe. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Dairy products can harbor various microorganisms (e.g., Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli) arising from animal reservoirs, and which can become important sources of foodborne illness. Therefore, early detection of food pathogens is crucial to prevent diseases. We wished to develop an accurate quantitative protocol based on a droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) involving eight individual TaqMan™ reactions to detect simultaneously, without selective enrichment, Listeria spp., L. monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., verocytotoxin-producing E. coli and Campylobacter spp. in cheese. ddPCR (a "third-generation PCR") provides absolute quantification of target DNAs without requirement of a standard curve, which simplifies experimentation and data comparability. The accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of the developed ddPCR system were assessed using purified DNA from 50 reference pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains from international or Italian collections and analyzing soft cheese samples artificially contaminated with serial dilutions (from 4 × 106 to 4 × 101 CFU/g) of pure cultures from the American Type Culture Collection. Finally, the performance of our ddPCR system was compared by parallel testing with quantitative PCR: it gave higher sensitivity (102 CFU/g for the Listeria spp. assay) without the necessity of a standard curve. In conclusion, this is the first ddPCR system developed for simultaneous detection of common foodborne pathogens in cheese using a single set of amplification conditions. As such, it could become a useful strategy for high-throughput screening of microorganisms to evaluate the quality and safety of food products. © 2016 Cremonesi, Cortimiglia, Picozzi, Minozzi, Malvisi, Luini and Castiglioni.},

abstract={Yersiniosis is the third most common reported zoonoses in Europe, with Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis responsible for 98.66% and 0.94% of the confirmed human cases in 2013. From June 2013 to October 2014, 201 pigs at slaughter belonging to 67 batches were tested for Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis in tonsils. Diaphragm muscle samples were tested for antibodies against Yersinia by a commercially available ELISA test. Y. enterocolitica 4/O:3 was detected in 55/201 pig tonsils (27.4%; 95% CI 23.1–37.1). The positive pigs came from 38/67 batches (56.7%) and were reared in 36/61 farms (59.0%). There was no statistical difference between farrow-to-finish and finishing farms. The mean count of Y. enterocolitica was 3.56 ± 0.85 log10 CFU/g with a minimum of 2.0 log10 CFU/g and a maximum of 4.78 log10 CFU/g. Y. pseudotuberculosis was isolated from 4/201 pig tonsils (2.0%; 95% CI 0.0–4.5). Three isolates belonged to serotype O:3 and one to serotype O:1. The positive pigs belonged to 4/67 batches (6.0%) and came from finishing farms only. Y. pseudotuberculosis could be enumerated in one sample only (4.27 log10 CFU/g). The ELISA test demonstrated that 56.1% of the meat juice samples were positive for Yersinia antibodies. Serological positivity was found in 67.9% (36/53) of the Y. enterocolitica- and 75.0% (3/4) of the Y. pseudotuberculosis positive pigs. A significant association was found between serological results and the presence of Y. enterocolitica in tonsils (OR = 1.97, p = 0.044). All the Y. enterocolitica 4/O:3 isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, gentamicin, ceftazidime, ertapenem and meropenem, 94.5% to cefotaxime, 89.1% to kanamycin and 78.2% to tetracycline. The highest resistance rates were observed for ampicillin (100%), sulphonamides (98.2%) and streptomycin (78.2%). Y. pseudotuberculosis strains were sensitive to all the antimicrobials tested, i.e. amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, azithromycin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, sulphonamide, tetracycline and ticarcillin. The study shows that Italian fattening pigs are frequently infected with human pathogenic Y. enterocolitica 4/O:3. Although the isolation rate is slightly lower than in other European countries, the serological test demonstrates that the infection is widespread among pig population. In fact, seroprevalence is similar to other EU countries. The detection of Y. pseudotuberculosis serotypes O:1 and O:3 in pig tonsils is of concern. Since tonsils may represent a contamination source for pig meat at slaughter, further studies regarding human infections by both microbial species are strongly recommended. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Mycobacterium microti has recently been described as the causative agent of tuberculosis-like lesions in wild boar (Sus scrofa), a reservoir specie of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) in some European Mediterranean ecosystem. Through a five-year survey on tuberculosis in free-living wild boars, the epidemiological trend of M. microti infections and the host and population risk factors linked with its occurrence were described. Retropharyngeal and mandibular lymph nodes of 3041 hunted wild boars from six different districts were macroscopically inspected. The sex and age of each animal were registered, as well as the animal abundance in each district. Lesions compatible with tuberculosis (190) were collected and analysed using a gyrB PCR-RFLP assay. M. microti was identified directly in 99 tissue samples (Prev = 3.26%; 95% CI: 2.67-3.97%), while neither Mycobacterium bovis, nor other members of the MTBC were detected. The probability of being M. microti positive showed spatio-temporal variability, with 26% of increase of risk of being infected for each year. Moreover, a positive effect of wild boar abundance and age on the prevalence was detected. The generalized increase in the European wild boar population, coupled with its sensitivity to M. microti infection, poses a future concern for the identification and management of MTBC members in wild boar. © 2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={In the framework of a European Union (EU) Coordinated Monitoring Programme, different types of ready-to eat (RTE) products, including soft and semi-soft cheese (n = 398) and cooked meat products (n = 403), were collected at retail in Italy and tested for detection and enumeration of Listeria monocytogenes. An Integrative Survey of 2696 samples, including soft and semi-soft cheese (n = 894) and cooked meat products (n = 1802) was carried out to have statistically representative results at the national level. Considering the results obtained both from the EU and the national Integrative Survey, prevalence of contamination of meat products was 1.66% (95% CL: 1.02–2.73%) at the arrival of the samples at the laboratory and 1.92% (95% CL: 1.31%–2.82%) at the end of shelf-life. Spalla cotta was the most frequently contaminated meat product. Prevalence of contamination in cheese was 2.13% (95% CL: 1.37%–3.3%) at the arrival at the laboratory and 1.01% (95% CL: 0.41%–2.55%) at the end of shelf-life. To get information about differences between cheese rinds and pastes, these two parts were separately analysed in the Integrative Survey samples. L. monocytogenes was detected in 4.02% (95% CL: 2.60%–6.19%) of cheese rinds (n = 473), whereas only the 0.34% (95% CL: 0.12%–0.98%) of cheese pastes (n = 894) were contaminated. This difference was statistically significant (χ2 = 10.026, P &lt; 0.05). Gorgonzola and Taleggio were the most frequently contaminated cheeses. Non-compliance with EU official criteria (100 CFU/g) was reported in 0.55% of meat products at arrival at the laboratory, in 0.46% at the end of shelf-life, and in 1.9% of cheese rinds. PFGE showed that cheese rinds could have been the origin of the few pastes' contamination, highlighting genetic similarity between isolates found in these two cheese components. Genetic subtyping also showed the presence of different pulsotypes, usually belonging to different clusters, in isolates from different food types. The presence of some pulsotypes predominantly prevalent over the others, in products from the same manufacturer, could suggest environmental strains as the main source of contamination. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

Here we describe results of the WNV integrated veterinary and human surveillance systems in Italy from 2008 to 2015. A real time data exchange protocol is in place between the surveillance systems to rapidly identify occurrence of human and animal cases and to define and update the map of affected areas i.e. provinces during the vector activity period from June to October. WNV continues to cause severe illnesses in Italy during every transmission season, albeit cases are sporadic and the epidemiology varies by virus lineage and geographic area. The integration of surveillance activities and a multidisciplinary approach made it possible and have been fundamental in supporting implementation of and/or strengthening preventive measures aimed at reducing the risk of transmission of WNV trough blood, tissues and organ donation and to implementing further measures for vector control. © 2016, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

abstract={Reproductive failure in sows is one of the most important factors affecting pig breeding. Many reproductive disorders are linked to both environmental factors and infectious agents. The goal of our study was to determine the presence of pathogens that are known to cause abortion, considering a set of conditioning factors, such as seasonality and pregnancy period. A large number of aborted fetuses (1,625 fetuses from 140 farms) from a high-density breeding area in northern Italy was analyzed for a period of 3 years. The pigs were diagnosed based on direct (culture, PCR) or indirect (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) evidence. An infectious etiologic agent was found in 323 of 549 cases of abortion (58.8%). These included viral agents (Porcine circovirus-2, 138/323; Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, 108/323; porcine parvovirus, 20/323; pseudorabies virus, 6/323; and Encephalomyocarditis virus, 3/323) and bacteria (Escherichia coli, 64/323; Streptococcus sp., 63/323; Staphylococcus sp., 5/323; Pasteurella sp., 3/323; Shigella sp., 1/323; and Yersinia sp., 1/323). This study describes the prevalence of infectious agents involved in reproductive failure in a high-density swine population. The data can be useful to swine breeders, practitioners, and medical specialists in monitoring animal health and in supervising the breeding process. © 2016, © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: Post-weaning diarrhoea (PWD), due to Escherichia coli, is an important cause of economic losses to the pig industry primarily as a result of mortality and worsened productive performance. In spite of its relevance, recent data about the prevalence of virulence genes and pathotypes among E. coli isolates recovered from cases of PWD in Europe are scarce. Results: This study investigates the prevalence of fimbrial and toxin genes of E. coli by PCR among 280 farms with PWD across Europe. A total of 873 samples collected within the first 48 h after the onset of PWD (occurring 7-21 days post weaning) were submitted to the laboratory for diagnostic purposes. Isolation and identification of E. coli were performed following standard bacteriological methods and PCR assays for the detection of genes encoding for fimbriae (F4, F5, F6, F18 and F41) and toxins (LT, STa, STb and Stx2e). The prevalence of fimbriae and toxins among E. coli isolates from cases of PWD was: F4 (45.1 %), F18 (33.9 %), F5 (0.6 %), F6 (0.6 %), F41 (0.3 %), STb (59.1 %), STa (38.1 %), LT (31.9 %) and Stx2e (9.7 %). E. coli isolates carrying both fimbrial and toxin genes were detected in 52. 5 % of the cases (178 out of 339 isolates), with 94.9 % of them being classified as enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC). The most common virotype detected was F4, STb, LT. Conclusions: This study confirms that ETEC is frequently isolated in pig farms with PWD across Europe, with F4-and F18-ETEC variants involved in 36.1 % and 18.2 % of the outbreaks, respectively. © The Author(s). 2018.},

abstract={Consumption of milk and dairy products is considered one of the main routes of human exposure to Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). Quantitative data on MAP load in raw cows’ milk are essential starting point for exposure assessment. Our study provides this information on a regional scale, estimating the load of MAP in bulk tank milk (BTM) produced in Emilia-Romagna region (Italy). The survey was carried out on 2934 BTM samples (88.6% of the farms herein present) using two different target sequences for qPCR (f57 and IS900). Data about the performances of both qPCRs are also reported, highlighting the superior sensitivity of IS900-qPCR. Seven hundred and eighty-nine samples tested MAP-positive (apparent prevalence 26.9%) by IS900 qPCR. However, only 90 of these samples were quantifiable by qPCR. The quantifiable samples contained a median load of 32.4 MAP cells mL−1 (and maximum load of 1424 MAP cells mL−1). This study has shown that a small proportion (3.1%) of BTM samples from Emilia-Romagna region contained MAP in excess of the limit of detection (1.5 × 101 MAP cells mL−1), indicating low potential exposure for consumers if the milk subsequently undergoes pasteurization or if it is destined to typical hard cheese production. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is endemic in many regions of the world and is one of the most prevalent epizootic animal diseases. FMD affects livestock, such as cattle, sheep, goats and pigs, and causes enormous economic losses due to reduced productivity and trade restrictions. Preparedness and early diagnosis are essential for effective control of FMD. Many diagnostic assays are dependent on raising high-affinity, anti-FMD virus (FMDV) serotype-specific antibodies in small animals (rabbits and Guinea pigs) that give broad virus coverage. Here we show that soluble, truncated forms of bovine αvβ6 bind FMDV in an authentic RGD and divalent cation dependent interaction and can be used as the trapping reagent in a FMDV sandwich ELISA. In addition, inclusion of FLAG or His tags facilitates simple purification without the loss of virus binding. We also provide evidence that when combined with a Guinea pig polyclonal serum, or serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies, the integrin can be used to detect viruses representative of all FMDV serotypes. We also show that recombinant FMDV empty capsids, with stabilising disulphide bonds, can serve as an antigen in the ELISA and can therefore replace inactivated virus antigen as a positive control for the assay. Our results demonstrate the potential use of bovine αvβ6 and FMDV empty capsids in FMD diagnostic assays. © 2016 Shimmon et al.

abstract={Stressful housing and management practices affect animals, potentially increasing their receptiveness to pathogens. Since some pathogens do not lead to clinical signs of sickness, subclinical pigs could enter the food-chain, contaminating carcases and offal at slaughter, representing a threat to human health. Here, we assess the feasibility of a new approach (using animal-based welfare outcomes) to investigate the association between the animal welfare status of finishing pigs on-farm and the occurrence of Yersinia enterocolitica and Salmonella enterica in slaughtered pigs in Northern Italy. Thirty batches of finishing pigs were assessed for animal-, resource- and management-based measures according to the Welfare Quality® protocol for pigs on-farm and at slaughter. A sample of five individuals per batch was tested for Y. enterocolitica and S. enterica in tonsils and in mesenteric lymph nodes, respectively, and gross pathological changes were recorded. Environmental faecal samples per batch on-farm were tested for the same pathogens. Univariable logistic regression models were used to investigate the association between batches of pigs that were positive to Y. enterocolitica and S. enterica and indicators of poor welfare. The animal-based measures of welfare, greater on-farm mortality and poor human-animal relationship, were found to be associated with Y. enterocolitica. This study provides a good indication of the validity of this approach, but there is a need for larger-scale studies in the future to confirm the magnitude of the associations between these animal welfare and food safety indicators. © 2016 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.},

abstract={Bovine mastitis caused by Prototheca is a serious and complex problem that accounts for high economic losses in the dairy industry. The main objective of this study was to identify and characterize at genetic level different Prototheca strains and provide the most complete data about protothecal antibiotic resistance. The study involves 46 isolates from Italian (13 strains) and Brazilian (33 strains) mastitic milk. These strains were identified by multiplex PCR and single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and characterized by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR. Moreover, biofilm production and antibiotic susceptibility were evaluated. Forty-two strains resulted as Prototheca zopfii genotype 2, whereas 4 isolates could belong to a potential new Prototheca species. The RAPD-PCR, performed with 3 primers (M13, OPA-4, and OPA-18), showed a notable heterogeneity among isolates and grouped the strains according to the species and geographical origin. Biofilm production was species-dependent and P. zopfii genotype 2 strains were classified as strong biofilm producers. In vitro antibiotic susceptibility tests indicated that Prototheca strains were susceptible to antibacterial drugs belonging to aminoglycosides group; the highest activity against Prototheca strains was observed in the case of colistin sulfate, gentamicin, and netilmicin (100% of susceptible strains). It is interesting to note that all the Italian P. zopfii genotype 2 strains showed lower minimum inhibitory concentration values than the Brazilian ones. Nisin showed more efficacy than lysozyme and potassium sorbate, inhibiting 31% of the strains. Results obtained in this study confirmed that RAPD-PCR is a rapid, inexpensive, and highly discriminating tool for Prototheca strains characterization and could give a good scientific contribution for better understanding the protothecal mastitis in dairy herd. © 2016 American Dairy Science Association},

abstract={The objective of this study was to assess the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of 73 isolates of Mycoplasma bovis isolated from milk of dairy cattle herds of Belgium, Germany, and Italy. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined by the microbroth dilution method for the following antimicrobials: erythromycin, spiramycin, tilmicosin, tylosin, lincomycin, enrofloxacin, doxycycline, oxytetracycline, florfenicol, and tiamulin. Macrolides, florfenicol, oxytetracycline, and enrofloxacin, were chosen because they represent antimicrobials families commonly used in several countries for treatment of M. bovis, and their MIC values in cattle population are reported in several studies, allowing a comparison with previous data. Doxycycline and tiamulin were selected to assess the susceptibility of M. bovis to new antimicrobials, because they are not registered in the European Union for the treatment of dairy cattle. Among the agents of the different antimicrobial classes, the macrolides showed the highest concentration to inhibit 90% of isolates (MIC90), all above the highest concentration tested: &gt;8 μg/mL for erythromycin, &gt;16 μg/mL for spiramycin, and &gt;32 μg/mL for tilmicosin and tylosin. Also the MIC90 of lincomycin was above the highest concentration tested (&gt;32 μg/mL), but the distribution of the MIC values was almost perfectly bimodal: 41 isolates had a MIC ≤0.5 μg/mL and 30 isolates &gt;32 μg/mL. Oxytetracycline had a 2-fold higher concentration to inhibit 50% of isolates (2 vs. 0.5 μg/mL) and 1-fold higher MIC90 (4 vs. 2 μg/mL) than doxycycline. Enrofloxacin and florfenicol had both a MIC90 of 2 μg/mL, whereas tiamulin had a MIC90 of 0.5 μg/mL. Significant differences on the MIC values were found among the 3 countries for several antimicrobials: compared with Germany, Belgium and Italy showed significantly higher MIC for lincomycin, spiramycin, and tylosin, and lower for oxytetracycline and florfenicol. The Belgian isolates showed the lowest MIC for enrofloxacin compared with Germany and Italy. The MIC results obtained in our study suggest the presence of a high level of resistance of M. bovis isolates originating from milk to macrolides in all countries involved in this study. On the contrary, a low level of resistance was found against the antimicrobials that are not used in cattle, such as tiamulin and doxycycline, highlighting a possible link between antimicrobial treatments and development of resistance in the studied M. bovis population. © 2016 American Dairy Science Association},

abstract={Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is a disease of zoonotic importance for which control and eradication programmes have been carried out in many countries for decades. While the impact of these programmes on public health is still uncertain, the impact on trade is significant because of movement restrictions for animals, costs of testing and culling. The objective of this systematic review was to provide a contribution to the general debate over costs against benefits for the control and eradication of bovine TB in cattle. The search strategy was performed on four electronic databases following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. The selection process, data abstraction and quality appraisal were carried out according to the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. The search identified 66 articles out of which eight fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The evidence gathered in this review by combining the conclusions of the most methodologically sound articles supports the idea that, when multiple cost and benefit components are taken into account, efforts to control or eradicate bovine TB may be effective in reducing disease prevalence, economically viable and worth doing.},

abstract={Poultry transport systems are currently under investigation with a particular focus on design and dimensions of commercially available transport crates. The height of the crates currently used is debated and considered by some parties to be insufficient to fulfill animal welfare needs. The opposing view is that the welfare of birds transported in higher crates is even worst. The European Food Safety Authority highlighted the lack of scientific evidence supporting recommendations on the height of crates used for poultry transportation. To fill this gap and provide scientific knowledge on the effect of crate height on the welfare of poultry during transport, a field trial was carried out on a commercial journey of 2,618 broilers, comparing the welfare of birds transported in commercial crates with that of others transported in crates of doubled height. Animal welfare was evaluated through the use of animal-based parameters, such as behavior, physiologic variables, dead on arrivals, and postmortem lesions observed at slaughter. None of the parameters assessed proved advantages of the higher crates over those currently used. On the other hand, several parameters underlined favorable aspects of current crates toward the modified ones. Although based on the results of 1 single test, it appears from this trial that the suggestion to replace the transport crates commercially in use at present with crates doubled in height is not supported by improvements in animal welfare. On the contrary, this replacement would have a negative effect on the welfare of broilers during transport. © 2016},

abstract={From 1 May 2015 to 31 October 2015 over 20 million visitors from all over the world visited the Universal Exhibition (EXPO) hosted by Milan (Lombardy region, Italy), raising concerns about the possible introduction of mosquito-borne diseases from endemic countries. The entomological surveillance protocol performed in Lombardy over the last three years was implemented in the EXPO area and in the two major regional airports using both Center for Disease Control CO2 and Biogents Sentinel traps. This surveillance aimed to estimate the presence and densities of putative vectors, and also to support investigations, including the vector species involved and area of diffusion, on the local spread of Chikungunya, Dengue and West Nile viruses (WNV) by competent vectors. From 3544 mosquitoes belonging to five different species, 28 pools of Culex spp. and 45 pools of Aedes spp. were screened for the presence of WNV, and for both Chikungunya and flaviviruses, respectively. The entomological surveillance highlighted a low density of potential vectors in the surveyed areas and did not reveal the presence of Chikungunya or Dengue viruses in the local competent vectors inside the EXPO area or in the two airports. In addition, the surveillance reported a low density of Culex spp. mosquitoes, which all tested negative for WNV. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Neospora caninum is worldwide recognized as one of the major abortive pathogens in cattle. Although cases of abortion are also registered in sheep and goats, information and epidemiological data on neosporosis in small ruminants are usually scant. In Italy, but few exceptions, data are limited to spare reports of abortions. This survey was aimed to i) update information on N. caninum infection in sheep and goats from north-eastern Italy; ii) analyze associated individual and flock risk factors and iii) compare N. caninum positivity with previously obtained data on Toxoplasma gondii. Four hundred and fourteen goats and 428 sheep from 39 flocks in Lombardy region were enrolled. Blood samples were collected and analyzed by an in-house ELISA followed by a confirmatory Western Blot. The test resulted positive for 5.7% of goats and 19.3% of sheep. As to farms, 32.1% and 89.4% of caprine and ovine flocks showed positive, respectively. Managerial variables, including rearing system and farm size, affected N. caninum infection. Small, family-run farms were at higher risk rather than intensive caprine farms or transhumant sheep flocks. Outcomes from the survey mainly indicate that these farms should implement their care about proper sanitary measures and monitor the spread of the infection among small ruminants. © 2016 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract={MicroRNA (miRNA) have been identified in circulating blood and might have the potential to be used as biomarkers for several pathophysiological conditions. To identify miRNA that are altered following stress events, turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) were subjected to 2 h of road transportation. The expression levels of five circulating miRNA, namely miR-22, miR-155-5p, miR-181a-3p, miR-204 and miR-365-3p, were detected and assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction using TaqMan® probes, as potential biomarkers of stress. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were then used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of miRNA. A panel of three stress-responsive miRNA, miR-22, miR-155 and miR-365 were identified; their expression levels were significantly higher after road transportation and the area under the curve (AUC) were 0.763, 0.71 and 0.704, respectively. Combining the three miRNA a specificity similar to the one found for the three miRNA separately was found. The AUC of the weighted average of the three miRNA was 0.763. This preliminary study suggests that the expression levels of circulating miR-22, miR-155 and miR-365 are increased during transport-related stress and that they may have diagnostic value to discriminate between stressed- and unstressed animals. © The Animal Consortium 2016.},

abstract={The order Lagomorpha comprises about 90 living species, divided in 2 families: the pikas (Family Ochotonidae), and the rabbits, hares, and jackrabbits (Family Leporidae). Lagomorphs are important economically and scientifically as major human food resources, valued game species, pests of agricultural significance, model laboratory animals, and key elements in food webs. A quarter of the lagomorph species are listed as threatened. They are native to all continents except Antarctica, and occur up to 5000 m above sea level, from the equator to the Arctic, spanning a wide range of environmental conditions. The order has notable taxonomic problems presenting significant difficulties for defining a species due to broad phenotypic variation, overlap of morphological characteristics, and relatively recent speciation events. At present, only the genomes of 2 species, the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and American pika (Ochotona princeps) have been sequenced and assembled. Starting from a paucity of genome information, the main scientific aim of the Lagomorph Genomics Consortium (LaGomiCs), born from a cooperative initiative of the European COST Action "A Collaborative European Network on Rabbit Genome Biology - RGBNet" and the World Lagomorph Society (WLS), is to provide an international framework for the sequencing of the genome of all extant and selected extinct lagomorphs. Sequencing the genomes of an entire order will provide a large amount of information to address biological problems not only related to lagomorphs but also to all mammals. We present current and planned sequencing programs and outline the final objective of LaGomiCs possible through broad international collaboration. © The American Genetic Association. 2016.

abstract={Wild ruminants have an important role in the epidemiology of bovine tuberculosis (bTB). This study describes an outbreak of bovine tuberculosis occurring in a fallow deer herd in Sicily. In 2012 a Sicilian herd of 47 animals was referred for cachexia. Pathological examination of 2 dead animals revealed disseminated granulomas predominantly involving the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Tissue samples were submitted for histological analysis, bacteriological culture, and biomolecular assay. PCR analysis identified Mycobacterium strains. Genotyping by spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR profiles identified Mycobacterium bovis spoligotype SB0120 in both animals. In 2014, bTB skin testing of 28 fallow deer from the same group was positive in 4 and inconclusive in another 4. All 8 positive/inconclusive reactors were euthanized. Disseminated granulomatous lesions were noted in 6 of these animals, 3 of which (2 positive and 1 negative to skin tests) also presented cutaneous lesions. M. bovis spoligotype SB0120 was identified from all animals in which tuberculous-like lesions were observed, including 2 negative reactors. Many of the animals involved in this outbreak presented diffuse skin lesions, a potential route of transmission of M. bovis infection. Given the epidemiological role wildlife play in the maintenance of bTB infection and its potential risk for humans, a comprehensive monitoring plan for this zoonosis in wildlife species in Sicily is needed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Several flaviviruses are important pathogens for humans and animals (Dengue viruses, Japanese encephalitis virus, Yellow-fever virus, Tick-borne encephalitis virus, West Nile virus). In recent years, numerous novel and related flaviviruses without known pathogenic capacity have been isolated worldwide in the natural mosquito population. However, phylogenetic studies have shown that genomic sequences of these viruses diverge from other flaviviruses. Moreover, these viruses seem to be exclusive of insects (they do not seem to grow on vertebrate cell lines), and were already defined as mosquito-only flaviviruses or insect-specific flaviviruses. At least eleven of these viruses were isolated worldwide, and sequences ascribable to other eleven putative viruses were detected in several mosquito species. A large part of the cycle of these viruses is not well known, and their persistence in the environment is poorly understood. These viruses are detected in a wide variety of distinct mosquito species and also in sandflies and chironomids worldwide; a single virus, or the genetic material ascribable to a virus, was detected in several mosquito species in different countries, often in different continents. Furthermore, some of these viruses are carried by invasive mosquitoes, and do not seem to have a depressive action on their fitness.The global distribution and the continuous detection of new viruses in this group point out the likely underestimation of their number, and raise interesting issues about their possible interactions with the pathogenic flaviviruses, and their influence on the bionomics of arthropod hosts. Some enigmatic features, as their integration in the mosquito genome, the recognition of their genetic material in DNA forms in field-collected mosquitoes, or the detection of the same virus in both mosquitoes and sandflies, indicate that the cycle of these viruses has unknown characteristics that could be of use to reach a deeper understanding of the cycle of related pathogenic flaviviruses. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: This study was aimed at evaluating the clinical protection, the level of Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) viremia and the immune response (antibodies and IFN-γ secreting cells (SC)) in piglets derived from PCV2 vaccinated sows and themselves vaccinated against PCV2 at different age, namely at 4, 6 and 8 weeks. The cohort study has been carried out over three subsequent production cycles (replicates). At the start/enrolment, 46 gilts were considered at first mating, bled and vaccinated. At the first, second and third farrowing, dams were bled and re-vaccinated at the subsequent mating after weaning piglets. Overall 400 piglets at each farrowing (first, second and third) were randomly allocated in three different groups (100 piglets/group) based on the timing of vaccination (4, 6 or 8 weeks of age). A fourth group was kept non-vaccinated (controls). Piglets were vaccinated intramuscularly with one dose (2 mL) of a commercial PCV2a-based subunit vaccine (Porcilis® PCV). Twenty animals per group were bled at weaning and from vaccination to slaughter every 4 weeks for the detection of PCV2 viremia, humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Clinical signs and individual treatments (morbidity), mortality, and body weight of all piglets were recorded. Results: All vaccination schemes (4, 6 and 8 weeks of age) were able to induce an antibody response and IFN-γ SC. The highest clinical and virological protection sustained by immune reactivity was observed in pigs vaccinated at 6 weeks of age. Overall, repeated PCV2 vaccination in sows at mating and the subsequent higher levels of maternally derived antibodies did not significantly interfere with the induction of both humoral and cell-mediated immunity in their piglets after vaccination. Conclusions: The combination of vaccination in sows at mating and in piglets at 6 weeks of age was more effective for controlling PCV2 natural infection, than other vaccination schemas, thus sustaining that some interference of MDA with the induction of an efficient immune response could be considered. In conclusion, optimal vaccination strategy needs to balance the levels of passive immunity, the management practices and timing of infection. © 2016 Martelli et al.},

abstract={The complex life cycle of Toxoplasma gondii involves many animal species, raising zoonotic, economic, and conservation issues. This complexity is reflected in the molecular structure of T. gondii, whose different genotypes differ in pathogenicity. Among the intermediate hosts of T. gondii, wild ungulates may be a source of human infection. Despite intense hunting activity and the consumption of raw or undercooked meat, little information is available on the spread of T. gondii and the distribution of its genotypes in these species, including the alpine chamois (Rupicapra r. rupicapra). Ninety-three sera and 50 brain tissues from chamois were sampled (1) to investigate the spread of T. gondii with serological and molecular analyses, and (2) to genotype the strains with a restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the SAG2 locus. The prevalence of T. gondii was low on both serological (3.2 %) and molecular (2 %) analyses, and infections were concentrated in individuals >1 year old. These findings demonstrate the sporadic presence of the protozoan in this species on consistent diagnostic tests. Horizontal transmission seems to be the main route of infection, and cats are the only definitive host in the study area. This prevalence suggests that the environment of the chamois is less contaminated with oocysts than environments close to human settlements. The SAG2 type II genotype was detected in this species for the first time. Although this genotype is predominant in human toxoplasmosis, these results suggest that the chamois is a minor source of human infection. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The recent identification in rabbits of hepatitis E viruses (HEV) related to viruses infecting humans raises the question of the role of this species as possible HEV reservoir. A serological survey on rabbit HEV infection was conducted in Italy during 2013-2014, including both farmed and pet rabbits. We found an anti-HEV antibody seroprevalence of 3.40 % in 206 farmed rabbits (collected on 7 farms) and 6.56 % in 122 pets. RNA was extracted from IgG-positive sera and analyzed by HEV-specific real-time RT-PCR. None of the samples were positive, confirming that no viremia was present in the presence of IgG. Only one serum sample from a farmed rabbit was positive for IgM, but no HEV RNA was detected in it. Pet rabbit feces were also tested for HEV RNA, with negative results. This finding suggests that HEV is circulating in rabbits in Italy. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.},

abstract={Background: In the last decades, Aedes albopictus has become an increasing public health threat in tropical as well as in more recently invaded temperate areas due to its capacity to transmit several human arboviruses, among which Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika. Enhancing the efficiency of currently used collection approaches, such as ovitraps and sticky traps, is desirable for optimal monitoring of the species abundance, for assessment of the risk of arbovirus transmission and for the optimisation of control activities. Findings: Two sets of 4 × 4 Latin-square experiments were carried out in Tirana (Albania) to test whether modifications in ovitrap shape and size and in oviposition substrate would increase collections of Ae. albopictus eggs and whether hay-infusion would increase adult catches by sticky trap. Generalized Linear Mixed Models with negative binomial error distribution were carried out to analyse the data. Cylindrical ovitraps lined with germination paper yielded significantly higher egg catches than those exploiting either the (commonly used) wooden paddles or floating polystyrene blocks as oviposition substrates. No difference was observed between cylindrical and conical shaped ovitraps. Ovitraps and sticky traps baited with hay infusion yielded significantly higher egg and adult catches than un-baited ones. A significant relationship between ovitrap and sticky trap catches was observed both in the absence and in the presence of attractants, with ovitrap catches increasing more than sticky trap catches at increasing adult female densities. Conclusions: This study provides grounds for optimisation of ovitraps and sticky traps as monitoring tools for Ae. albopictus by (i) supporting use of germination paper as most appropriate oviposition substrate; (ii) suggesting the possible use of stackable conical ovitraps for large scale monitoring; (iii) confirming the use of hay-infusion to increase egg catches in ovitraps, and showing that hay-infusion also significant increases adult catches by sticky traps. © 2016 Velo et al.},

abstract={Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) is an important cause of acute food- borne zoonoses worldwide, typically carried by pigs. It is well known that Salmonella has evolved a wide array of strategies enabling it to invade the host, but little information is available on the specific host responses to Salmonella infections. In the present study, we used an in vivo approach (involving piglets infected with a virulent or an attenuated S. Typhimurium strain) coupled to histological and proteomic analysis of the cecum mucosa, to highlight the host pathways activated during S. Typhimurium infection. We confirm the complex host-pathogen interaction. Our data showed that the metabolic and the cytoskeleton organization functions were the most significantly altered. In particular, the modifications of energy metabolic pathway could suggest a "nutriprive" mechanism, in which the host reduce its metabolic and energetic status to limit Salmonella infection. This study could represent a preliminary approach, providing information useful to better understand the host-Salmonella interaction. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The aims of this study were to (1) study the optimal growth condition for two Lactococcus lactis strains to produce the anti-listeria compounds and (2) evaluate the effect of films activated with a twofold concentrated cell-free supernatant of La.lactis to inhibit Listeria monocytogenes. For the growth conditions, skimmed milk added to either Ml7 or MRS provided the highest levels of anti-listeria activity assayed (800 arbitrary unit per milliliter) for both La.lactis strains. A significant decrease of Li.monocytogenes counts was observed in cheese packed in films treated with an average decrease of 2.12 log colony-forming unit per gram after 15 days of storage. Practical Applications: The antimicrobial film for food packaging can be used for the preservation of perishable foods such as the sliced cheese. This film developed in our study inhibits Listeria monocytogenes growth in sliced cheese, and does not have an adverse effect on the lactic microbiota, contributing to the preservation of the quality of the product. Thus, it could be a useful tool for the control of the development of pathogens in foods during storage of dairy products. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Animal welfare during transportation has been investigated in several studies, as opposed to post-transportation phases. In this study, we evaluated the effect of a novel environment after transportation on 26 Friesian bulls, 242 ± 42 day-old, from ten different dairy farms. Animals were shipped to a breeding center in different seasons, and selected parameters of innate immunity (serum bactericidal activity, hemolytic complement, serum albumin, α, β, and γ-globulins, interleukin-6, TNF-α) were monitored before and after the arrival at days-4/0/4/15/30. Our results showed significant differences of IL-6 and TNF-α protein levels at destination in December (94 ± 1.3 pg/ml) and June (+788 pg/ml), respectively. Moreover, the serum levels of these cytokines increased between days 0 and 15 after the arrival, the modulation of IL-6 being in agreement with established models of physical and/or psychological stress. Concerning the modulation of albumin, alpha and beta-globulins, the highest levels were detected in April, whereas a significant decrease was observed between day 15 and 30 after arrival; on the contrary, γ-globulin levels significantly increased after day 15. The results of this study highlight the occurrence of innate immune responses of young bulls to the combined effects of climate (season) and novel farming conditions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract={Nowadays, leptospirosis is a re-emerging widespread infectious disease often underestimate worldwide. The National Reference Centre for Leptospirosis (NRCL), at the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell’Emilia Romagna, Brescia (Italy), with the cooperation of all the other Istituti Zooprofilattici Sperimentali (IIZZSS), evaluated the distribution of such important zoonosis in Italy. Serological data obtained between 2010-2011 by each laboratory were collected by the NRCL and discussed. Serum samples collected from 43,935 animal specimens were analysed by the Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT), using a panel of 8 serogroups as antigens (Australis, Ballum, Canicola, Grippotyphosa, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Pomona, Sejroe, Tarassovi). A MAT cut-off of 1:100 was used to identify the serological positivities, 6,279 sera showed positive titers. Bovine (46.9%), swine (27.5%), ovine and goat (7.4%), dog (6.9%), and wild boar (4.5%) samples were delivered to the Laboratories more frequently than equine and other species sera. Data analysis showed that the most common serogroups in Italy are: Australis present in dogs, wild boars, horses, hares, swine, foxes, and rodents; Sejroe detected in cattle, sheep, goats, and buffaloes; Icterohaemorrhagiae present in dogs, goats, and foxes; Pomona detected in swine, cattle, and wild species; Grippotyphosa reported in hares. © 2016, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell’Abruzzo e del Molise “G.Caporale”.

abstract={Orthobunyaviruses are enveloped viruses that are arthropod-transmitted and cause disease in humans and livestock. Viral attachment and entry are mediated by the envelope glycoproteins Gn and Gc, and the major glycoprotein, Gc, of certain orthobunyaviruses is targeted by neutralizing antibodies. The domains in which the epitopes of such antibodies are located on the glycoproteins of the animal orthobunyavirus Schmallenberg virus (SBV) have not been identified. Here, we analysed the reactivity of a set of mAbs and antisera against recombinant SBV glycoproteins. The M-segment-encoded proteins Gn and Gc of SBV were expressed as full-length proteins, and Gc was also produced as two truncated forms, which consisted of its amino-terminal third and carboxyl-terminal two-thirds. The sera from convalescent animals reacted only against the full-length Gc and its subdomains and not against the SBV glycoprotein Gn. Interestingly, the amino-terminal domain of SBV-Gc was targeted not only by polyclonal sera but also by the majority of murine mAbs with a neutralizing activity. Furthermore, the newly defined amino-terminal domain of about 230 aa of the SBV Gc protein could be affinity-purified and further characterized. This major neutralizing domain might be relevant for the development of prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for SBV and other orthobunyaviruses. © 2016 The Authors.},

abstract={The methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has recently frequently been reported in dairy cattle, usually with low prevalence. The livestock-associated MRSA (LA-MRSA) ST398 is especially involved in cases of subclinical and clinical mastitis. Swine carry LA-MRSA without clinical symptoms and are considered its reservoir and shedder. People exposed to swine are particularly at risk of LA-MRSA colonization. Environments with relevant livestock density are a demonstrated risk factor for humans to be carriers of a LA-MRSA. This work investigated dairy farms located in an area with a high livestock density, mainly represented by swine. Bulk tank milk samples from 224 dairy farms were collected, and their status was defined as MRSA-positive or MRSA-negative based on culture on chromogenic medium. The number of fattening swine and of fattening swine herds was calculated in an area of 3 km around each dairy farm through georeferencing. The probability of a Staphylococcus aureus-positive dairy farm to be MRSA positive based on the extent of potential infective pressure due to swine density was calculated. Both the number of swine herds and the number of swine were associated with the MRSA status of dairy herds. The 9 MRSA isolated were typed by multi-locus sequence typing and spa-typing, and characterized for their virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance profiles. The ST and spa-types detected are consistent with those present in the Italian swine population. Virulence and resistance profiles are mostly consistent with the types detected. This work provides the first evidence of the epidemiological challenge exerted by the density of the swine population on MRSA in dairy cows. © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.},

abstract={The 129 mouse strain is commonly used for the generation of genetically engineered mice. Genetic drift or accidental contamination during outcrossing has resulted in several 129 substrains. Comprehensive data on spontaneous age-related pathology exist for the 129S4/SvJae substrain, whereas only limited information is available for other 129 substrains. This longitudinal aging study describes the life span and spontaneous lesions of 44 male and 18 female mice of the 129S6/SvEvTac substrain. Median survival time was 778 and 770 days for males and females, respectively. Tumors of lung and Harderian gland were the most common neoplasms in both sexes. Hepatocellular tumors occurred mainly in males. Hematopoietic tumors were observed at low frequency. Suppurative and ulcerative blepharoconjunctivitis was the most common nonneoplastic condition in both sexes. Corynebacteria (primarily Corynebacterium urealyticum and C. pseudodiphtheriticum) were isolated from animals with blepharoconjunctivitis and in some cases from unaffected mice, although a clear causal association between corynebacterial infections and blepharoconjunctivitis could not be inferred. Polyarteritis occurred only in males and was identified as the most common nonneoplastic contributory cause of death. Eosinophilic crystalline pneumonia occurred in both sexes and was a relevant cause of death or comorbidity. Epithelial hyalinosis at extrapulmonary sites was noted at higher frequency in females. This study contributes important data on the spontaneous age-related pathology of the 129S6/SvEvTac mouse substrain and is a valuable reference for evaluation of the phenotype in genetically engineered mice obtained with this 129 substrain. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.},

abstract={The genus Vibrio includes several food-borne pathogens that cause a spectrum of clinical conditions including septicemia, cholera and milder forms of gastroenteritis. Several Vibrio spp. are commonly associated with food-borne transmission including Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahemolyticus, and Vibrio vulnificus. Microbiological analysis for enumeration and isolation of Vibrio spp. were carried out for a total of 93 samples of seafood, meat and meat products from different geographic localities in Libya (Tripoli, Regdalin, Janzour and Tobruk). Vibrio spp. were detected by conventional cultural and molecular method using PCR and sequencing of 16S rDNA. Out of the 93 cultured samples only 48 (51.6%) yielded colonies on Thiosulfate Citrate Bile Salt agar (TCBS) with culture characteristics of Vibrio spp. More than half (n=27) of processed seafood samples (n=46) yielded colonies on TCBS, while only 44.6% of samples of meat and meat products showed colonies on TCBS. Among cultured seafood samples, the highest bacterial count was recorded in clam with a count of 3.8 х104 CFU\g. Chicken burger samples showed the highest bacterial count with 6.5 х104 CFU\g. Molecular analysis of the isolates obtained in this study, showed that 11 samples out of 48 (22.9%) were Vibrio spp. Vibrio parahemolyticus was isolated from camel meat for the first time. This study is an initial step to provide a baseline for future molecular research targeting Vibrio spp. foodborne illnesses. This data will be used to provide information on the magnitude of such pathogens in Libyan seafood, meat and meat products. © 2016, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tripoli and National Authority for Scientific Research.

abstract={In 2013-2014, 201 pigs belonging to 67 batches were tested for Salmonella in their mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) in one abattoir of Northern Italy. For each batch, faecal material was collected at lairage by swabbing the pen floor for approximately 1600cm2. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of Salmonella in MLN of pigs at slaughter, to assess Salmonella contamination at lairage and to evaluate the effect of lairage duration on its prevalence. Serotyping, XbaI PFGE typing and antimicrobial testing of the isolates were performed. Pig and human Salmonella isolates of the same region of Italy were compared to evaluate possible correlations.Salmonella enterica was isolated from 19.9% of the MLN and 49.3% of the environmental faecal samples. Nine different serovars were identified among 75 S. enterica isolates. In MLN Salmonella Derby was the most common (52.5%), followed by S. enterica 4,[5],12:i:- (17.5%) and Salmonella Rissen (10.0%). In faecal samples S. Derby was prevalent (51.4%), followed by S. enterica 4,[5], 12:i:- (20.0%) and Salmonella Brandenburg (14.3%).Lairage holding varied between 1 and ≥. 12. h (median value: 2.5. h). In pigs held for 1-3. h, 14.1% were positive for Salmonella in MLN but the prevalence reached 31.8% when they were held for ≥. 12. h. The contamination of MLN was statistically different (p=. 0.0045) between the two groups, thus confirming the role of long-lasting lairage in Salmonella contamination of pigs.XbaI PFGE typing detected 36 PFGE types. Twenty-three PFGE types were identified among the 40 MLN isolates and 22 PFGE types among the 35 faecal isolates. A total of 11 PFGE types were shared between the MLN of pigs and the lairage environment. Among S. Derby, 6 shared PFGE types between MLN and faeces were found and among S. enterica 4,[5],12:i:- one PFGE type was common between MLN and the faecal samples. Shared profiles between human and swine isolates of S. Derby, S. enterica 4,[5],12:i:-, S. Rissen, Salmonella Manhattan, S. Brandenburg, Salmonella Livingstone, Salmonella London and Salmonella Muenchen were identified. Among S. Derby and S. enterica 4,[5],12:i:- isolates found in pigs, 6/15 profiles (40.0%) and 8/10 (80.0%) were shared with human isolates.High resistance rates to streptomycin (97.3%), sulphonamide compounds (84.0%) and tetracycline (56.0%) were observed. No resistance was detected to ertapenem and meropenem. High proportions of isolates showed intermediate sensitivity to ciprofloxacin (85.3%) and cefotaxime (66.7%). High sensitivity rates were found to chloramphenicol (96.0%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (81.3%). © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Listeria monocytogenes is an important food-borne pathogen causing meningitis, meningo-encephalitis and abortion. Both sporadic and epidemic human listeriosis cases are associated with the consumption of contaminated foods. To assess the potential risk to consumer health, the presence of L. monocytogenes was investigated using qualitative and quantitative methods in raw milk (bulk tank milk and milk for vending machine) collected from 2010 to 2013 in Northern Italy (Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna regions). Overall, L. monocytogenes was detected in 145 on 8716 of raw milk samples, with a prevalence of 1.66% (95% C.I. 1.4%-1.7%). The prevalence ranged from 0.52% (95% C.I. 0.3%-0.9%) in 2012 to 2.7% (95% C.I. 2.0%-3.8%) in 2013, but no trend of increase was observed in four-years of investigation. The pathogen was detected from 2.2% (95% C.I. 1.9%-2.6%) of bulk tank milk and from 0.5% (95% C.I. 0.3%-0.8%) of milk for vending machine. A significative difference (p &lt; 0.05) of the prevalence data was observed between data collected in two different regions of Northern Italy with an higher prevalence in Lombardy. In addition to the geographical area, the L. monocytogenes presence was influenced also by the seasonal period of collection samples, with peaks in spring and autumn. These results confirm the raw milk can be a source of foodborne illness outbreaks if consumed without sanitizing treatments, but the low prevalence and the low contamination levels (more than 80% of the contaminated samples contained &lt;10 cfu ml -l of L. monocytogenes) proving the hygienic quality of the milk produced in Northern Italy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is an acute and highly contagious respiratory disease of chickens caused by an alphaherpesvirus, infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV). Recently, full genome sequences of wild-type and vaccine strains have been determined worldwide, but none was from Europe. The aim of this study was to determine and analyse the complete genome sequences of five ILTV strains. Sequences were also compared to reveal the similarity of strains across time and to discriminate between wild-type and vaccine strains. Genomes of three ILTV field isolates from outbreaks occurred in Italy in 1980,2007 and 2011, and two commercial chicken embryo origin (CEO) vaccines were sequenced using the 454 Life Sciences technology. The comparison with the Serva genome showed that 35 open reading frames (ORFs) differed across the five genomes. Overall, 54 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 27 amino acid differences in 19 ORFs and two insertions in the UL52 and ORFC genes were identified. Similarity among the field strains and between the field and the vaccine strains ranged from 99.96% to 99.99%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a close relationship among them, as well. This study generated data on genomic variation among Italian ILTV strains revealing that, even though the genetic variability of the genome is well conserved across time and between wild-type and vaccine strains, some mutations may help in differentiating among them and maybe involved in ILTV virulence/attenuation. The results of this study can contribute to the understanding of the molecular bases of ILTV pathogenicity and provide genetic markers to differentiate between wild-type and vaccine strains. © 2016 Piccirillo et al.

abstract={The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of transport-related stress on the liver gene expression of four acute phase proteins (APP), namely α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Serum Amyloid A (SAA) and PIT54, in turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo). A group of seven BUT BIG 6 commercial hens was subjected to a two-hour long road transportation and the quantitative gene expression of APP in the liver was compared to that of a non transported control group. The expression of AGP and CRP mRNA was found to be increased in animals slaughtered after road transport. The presence of AGP protein was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. The results of this study showed that road-transport may induce the mRNA expression of immune related proteins. The finding that AGP and CRP can be upregulated during transport could suggest their use as for the assessment of turkey welfare during transport. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The aim of the present study was to determine seroprevalence for Toxoplasma gondii by meat juice ELISA and evaluate the presence of T. gondii and Sarcocystis spp. within host tissues by histology, PCR and in vitro isolation, in the indigenous Cornigliese sheep breed in northern Italy. Seventeen out of 24 (70.8%) sheeps were positive for T. gondii by meat juice ELISA. Twenty sheep (83.3%) were positive by PCR for T. gondii, while 24/24 sheep (100%) were positive by PCR for Sarcocystis spp. Tissues cysts compatible with Sarcocystis spp. were visible in all animals on histology. PCR confirmed the presence of T. gondii after three weeks of in vitro culture on Vero cells in only one sample. Genotyping of T. gondii by RLFP with 5 markers showed a predominance of genotypes II/III. Sequence analysis of Sarcocystis spp. showed only the presence of Sarcocystis tenella.T. gondii and S. tenella are present in a high percentage of Cornigliese sheep in northern Italy. Future studies should concentrate upon the reproductive and economic effects of these parasitic infections, in light of the necessary conservation of this local, indigenous sheep breed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background. Foodborne Hepatitis A Virus (HAV) outbreaks are being recognized as an emerging public health problem in industrialized countries. In 2013 three foodborne HAV outbreaks occurred in Europe and one in USA. During the largest of the three European outbreaks, most cases occurred in Italy (>1,200 cases as of March 31, 2014). A national Task Force was established at the beginning of the outbreak by the Ministry of Health. Mixed frozen berries were early demonstrated to be the source of infection by the identity of viral sequences in patients and in food. In the present study the molecular characterization of HAV isolates from 355 Italian cases is reported. Methods. Molecular characterization was carried out by PCR/sequencing (VP1/2A region), comparison with reference strains and phylogenetic analysis. Results. A unique strain was responsible for most characterized cases (235/355, 66.1%). Molecular data had a key role in tracing this outbreak, allowing 110 out of the 235 outbreak cases (46.8%) to be recognized in absence of any other link. The data also showed background circulation of further unrelated strains, both autochthonous and travel related, whose sequence comparison highlighted minor outbreaks and small clusters, most of them unrecognized on the basis of epidemiological data. Phylogenetic analysis showed most isolates from travel related cases clustering with reference strains originating from the same geographical area of travel. Conclusions. In conclusion, the study documents, in a real outbreak context, the crucial role of molecular analysis in investigating an old but re-emerging pathogen. Improving the molecular knowledge of HAV strains, both autochthonous and circulating in countries from which potentially contaminated foods are imported, will become increasingly important to control outbreaks by supporting trace back activities, aiming to identify the geographical source(s) of contaminated food, as well as public health interventions.

abstract={A multiclass method for screening and confirmatory analysis of antimicrobial residues in muscle has been developed and validated, according to Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. Sixty-two antibiotics belonging to ten different drug families (amphenicols, beta-lactams, diamino-pyrimidine, lincosamides, macrolides, pleuromutilins, quinolones, rifamycins, sulfonamides and tetracyclines) have been included in the method. After the addition of an aqueous solution of EDTA, the minced muscle was extracted with acetonitrile/water mixture and, later, with pure acetonitrile. The extract was evaporated and redissolved in ammonium acetate buffer prior to LC injection. Instrumental determination was performed by liquid chromatography coupled to hybrid high resolution mass analyser (LC-HRMS/MS) operating in positive electrospray ionization mode. Chromatographic separation was optimized on a Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column (100×3.0mm, 2.7μm) with gradient using methanol and water containing 0.1% of formic acid as mobile phases. The method was validated in bovine muscle in the range 3.3-150μgkg -1 for all antibiotics; for some compounds with MRL higher than 100μgkg -1 , the validation interval has been extended until 1500μgkg -1 . The studied performance characteristics were selectivity, linearity, precision, trueness (recovery), decision limits, detection capabilities, detection and quantification limits. Satisfactory quantitative performances were obtained for all the analytes. Ruggedness tests demonstrated the applicability to swine and poultry muscle, too. Finally the wide participation in proficiency tests allowed to investigate in deep the method performances. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract={The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes an acute and highly contagious enteric disease characterized by severe enteritis, vomiting, watery diarrhea, and a high mortality rate in seronegative neonatal piglets. In the last few years, PED had a large economic impact on the swine industries in Asia and the US, and in 2014, the PEDV also re-emerged in Europe. Two main PEDV variants circulate worldwide but only the S INDEL variant, considered a mild strain, is spreading in Europe. To gain insights into the pathogenicity of this variant, its viral load and temporal shedding pattern were evaluated in piglets from infected farms. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) targeting the spike gene, was validated according to the minimum information for quantitative real-time PCR experiments guidelines. The qPCR was applied to longitudinal studies conducted in four swine farms naturally infected with the PEDV S INDEL variant. Clinical data, fecal swabs, and blood samples were collected from 103 piglets at 15-30-day intervals for 2-5 months. On all four farms, diarrhea was observed in sows during gestation and in farrowing units, and the mortality rates of piglets were 18, 25, 30, and 35%. Different clinical pictures (0-50% of diarrhea positivity), viral titer levels (mean 5.3-7.2 log10 genome copies/mL), and antibody conditions (30-80% of positivity) were registered among sows on the four farms. The percentage of qPCR positive piglets varied greatly from the beginning (63-100%) to the end (0%) of the infection course. Clinical signs were present in 96% of the qPCR positive animals. Viral loads ranged from 8.5 log10 to 4 log10 genome copies/mL in suckling pigs at 3-6 days of age and were not statistically different among farms, despite the different patterns observed in sows. After 2-3 weeks, only a few piglets still showed detectable viral levels and clinical signs, and they developed antibody responses. Moreover, co-infections with other pathogens and biosecurity procedures limiting the circulation of the virus could have influenced the severity of PED infection. QPCR and clinical data were useful in understanding the dynamics of PEDV infections and, therefore, in implementing appropriate control measures. © 2016 Bertasio, Giacomini, Lazzaro, Perulli, Papetti, Lavazza, Lelli, Alborali and Boniotti.},

abstract={Staphylococcus aureus is the most important causative agent of subclinical mastitis in cattle resulting in reduced milk production and quality. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains has a clear zoonotic relevance, especially in the case of occupational exposure. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of S. aureus and MRSA in bulk tank milk (BTM) from dairy cattle herds in the Lombardy Region (Northern Italy) and to identify the main MRSA circulating genotypes. MRSA strains were characterized by susceptibility testing, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), spa typing and SCCmec typing. A total 844 BTM samples were analysed and S. aureus and MRSA were detected in 47·2% and 3·8% of dairy herds, respectively. MLST showed that the majority (28/32) of isolates belonged to the typical livestock-associated lineages: ST398, ST97 and ST1. Interestingly, in this study we report for the first time the new ST3211, a single locus variant of ST(CC)22, with the newly described 462 aroE allele. Our study indicates high diffusion of S. aureus mastitis and low, but not negligible, prevalence of MRSA in the considered area, suggesting the need for planning specific control programmes for bovine mastitis caused by S. aureus, especially when MRSA is implicated. © Cambridge University Press 2016.},

Six enzymatic patterns were observed. Kinetoplast DNA RFLP-PCR confirmed to have a good discriminatory power within the same zymodeme and proved to be useful for comparing few strains or discriminating between relapse and reinfection in the same host.

abstract={In recent years, cell therapy has evolved quickly gaining great interest in both human and veterinary medicine. In particular, it has evoked considerable excitement in the animal-owning public because of the promise that stem cell technology could deliver tissue regeneration for injuries, for which natural repair mechanisms do not deliver functional recovery and for which current therapeutic strategies have minimal effectiveness. Stem cells are undifferentiated cells characterized by self-renewal ability, high potential for proliferation and differentiation capacity. The main use regards the adult multipotent cells, which carry none of the ethical issues associated with embryonic stem cells because they are obtained from fully developed adult tissues. In fact, while application of embryonic stem cells is associated with immune rejection and teratoma formation, alternatively proposed mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have several advantages for theimplementation in regenerative medicine. Ethical and easy isolation of MSCs from adult tissues, their involvement in tissue regeneration due to differentiation capacity and immunosuppressive properties, are among the most important ones. In particular, some adult stem cells are considered more valuable than others, due to their accessibility, abundance, selfrenewal properties, plasticity and ability to proliferate and differentiate. In fact, MSCs can differentiate into many cell types including the chondrogenic, adipogenic, osteogenic, and myogenic lineages. They are immuno-compatible and have an immuno-regulatory effect, both of which are advantageous when making therapeutic use of them. For this reason, MSC-based cell therapies have been investigated for several years in human medicine and, more recently, the same approach has been considered in veterinary medicine, as a novel potential therapy for treatment of different disorders. The isolation of stem cells from adult subject is usually performed from the bone marrow (BM), but this technique is invasive and, in order to obviate this problem it is considered appropriate to isolate cells from biological material of different nature. Peripheral blood would represent an ideal alternative source, although it contains a small number of stem cell elements in natural conditions. Recently, adipose tissue has been identified as an alternative source; in fact, it is particularly rich in stem cells (2% of the cellular component). In veterinary medicine, application of MSCs has been considered for reparation of several tissue damaged: epithelial wound, musculoskeletal disorders, corneal reparation. Nowadays, equine orthopaedic field is the main field of interest, in fact tendon and ligament repairs are often weak and susceptible to reinjury. In particular, traditional therapeutic approaches to tendon healing do not always result in a satisfactory anatomical and functional repair, and healed tendon is often characterized by functional impairment and high risk of re-injury. For this reason, MSCs have been proposed as novel therapeutic treatment to improve the tendon repair process. Furthermore, other promising clinical fields of application regard treatment of cartilage and bone disorders. Finally, interesting results obtained in human medicine for ophthalmology pathologies have promoted this approach also in veterinary field. Corneal damages are successfully treated with stem cell application, particularly in cats and dogs, either for mechanical lesions or for infectious diseases. © 2017 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

abstract={Wild boar (Sus scrofa) is considered a potential source of several viral and bacterial pathogens that represent a risk to humans and other mammals. Among these the spirochete of the genus Leptospira causes Leptospirosis, a neglected zoonotic disease. This study investigates the presence of antibodies against pathogenic Leptospira spp. serovars in wild boar in different areas of the Lombardy region (northern Italy) and the risk factors associated with its presence in a specific population. Blood and tissue samples from wild boars were collected from 2008 to 2013 during a wildlife survey. A total of 2101 serum samples were analysed using a microscopic agglutination test (MAT) to detect antibodies against Leptospira interrogans sensu lato. Culture isolation and Leptospira DNA detection by PCR were carried out using 189 kidney and 159 urine samples, respectively. Antibodies against 5 serovars were detected in 321 serum samples (15.3%). Bratislava was the most frequently identified serovar (14.6%; 95% C.I. 13.1–16.2%), followed by Copen-hageni (1.48%; 95% C.I. 1.0–2.1%), Grippotyphosa and Pomona (0.48%; 95% C.I. 0.23–0.87%), and Canicola (0.05%; 95% C.I. 0–0.3%). Genotyping by multilocus sequence typing and multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis of a single leptospire isolate confirmed the presence of L. interrogans serovar Bratislava with the same genetic profile as Jez Bratislava. The statistical analyses confirmed the wild boar’s age class as an important risk factor for the seroprevalence of leptospirosis, whereas no effect of wild boar abundance on seroprevalence was observed. In addition, an increasing seroprevalence was observed, in particular that of Australis Bratislava showed a general increasing pattern over the years. Our results confirmed that wild boars are a potential source of pathogenic Leptospira spp., which can infect humans, domestic animals and other wild animal species in low-density regions, such as those on the Alps. © 2016 Associazione Teriologica Italiana.},

abstract={The mineral nutritional values of foods is an important aspect that should be considered (especially the intake for iron, calcium, potassium, manganese, copper, chromium and zinc) to obtain a correct balanced diet, that is essential to maintaining good health. In the literature there are many information on mineral content of different foods, but due to the high analytical costs of traditional methods (AAS, ICP-MS) in the real world, only few data are routinely produced. The use of an alternative cheap analytical technique as TXRF can help to overcome this knowledge gaps. [1-8] The TXRF quantification were improved using triplicates analysis and two internal standard, the first (Gallium) for quantification and the second one (Vanadium) for verify the accuracy and repeatability of method. The results show that TXRF technique is reliable and could be successfully used for determination of main mineral contents in food, and also for trace elements. Finally, a complete mineral characterization can be used to define the authenticity and can help for traceability of food products.},

abstract={The quantitative and qualitative patterns of environmental contamination by Listeria monocytogenes were investigated in the production chain of dry-cured Parma ham. Standard arrays of surfaces were sampled in processing facilities during a single visit per plant in the three compartments of the food chain, i.e., ham production (19 plants) and postproduction, which was divided into deboning (43 plants) and slicing (25 plants) steps. The numbers of sampled surfaces were 384 in ham production, with 25 positive for L. monocytogenes, and 1,084 in postproduction, with 83 positives. Statistical analysis of the prevalence of contaminated surfaces showed that in ham production, contamination was higher at the beginning of processing and declined significantly toward the end, while in postproduction, prevalence rose toward the end of processing. Prevalence was higher in the deboning facilities than in slicing facilities and was dependent on the type of surface (floor/drainage > clothing > equipment). The qualitative pattern of contamination was investigated through an analysis of the survey isolates and a set of isolates derived from routine monitoring, including longitudinal isolations. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole-genome singlenucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis revealed a remarkable clonality of L. monocytogenes within plants, with the detection of 16 plant-specific clones out of 17 establishments with multiple isolates. Repeated detections of clonal isolates > 6 months apart were also observed. Six was the maximum number of between-isolate differences in core SNPs observed within these clones. Based on the same six-SNP threshold, three clusters of clonal isolates, shared by six establishments, were also identified. The spread of L. monocytogenes within and between plants, as indicated by its clonal behavior, is a matter of concern for the hygienic management of establishments. © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.},

abstract={In the three-years period 2012e2014, 160 cow milk samples from farms located in Lombardy and Emilia Romagna regions (Italy) were analyzed during the implementation of the Italian National Residues Monitoring Plan to assess the presence of PCDD/F, DL-PCB and NDL-PCB residues. The obtained contamination data were combined with cow milk consumption data from the Italian national dietary survey to estimate PCDD/F, DL-PCB and NDL-PCB human dietary exposure through the consumption of whole, semi skimmed and skimmed bovine milk. The exposure assessment was carried out separately for children, teenagers, adults and elderly. Average contamination levels of the analyzed samples were found to be 1.26 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat for the sum of PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs and 9.30 ng/g fat for the sum of the 6 NDL-PCB indicators. PCB 126 was found to be the main contributor to the total WHO-TEQ. Using the upper bound approach, the estimated mean dietary intakes ranged from 0.07 pg WHO-TEQ/kg bw per day to 0.39 pg WHO-TEQ/kg bw per day for the sum of PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs and considering exposure from whole milk.

abstract={This study determined the seroprevalence of Encephalitozoon cuniculi in pet rabbits from north-central Italy and correlated it with data (age and clinical signs) obtained from private veterinary practitioners. During the period 2007 to 2010, 826 pet rabbit sera were collected and tested using carbon immunoassay. In total, 310 out of 826 rabbits (37.53%, 95% CI: 34.23 to 40.94) displayed clinical signs consistent with infection, whereas the remaining 516 animals presented for wellness examination or to be vaccinated. The results were analyzed according to age, serological status, and the presence or absence of clinical signs. Seropositive results were observed in 59.56% (95% CI: 56.12 to 62.92) of the examined animals. Seroprevalence in the clinically ill rabbits was 70.65% (95% CI: 65.18 to 75.59), much higher than in healthy animals, which showed a prevalence of 52.91% (95% CI: 48.5 to 57.27). Clinical signs were classified into 4 groups: nonvestibular neurologic signs, vestibular signs (including head tilt), renal failure, and ocular lesions. Odds of animals presenting with clinical disease signs were higher in seropositive rabbits (odds ratio = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.59 to 2.9), and this association was particularly true for vestibular signs (odds ratio = 4.1, 95% CI: 2.48 to 7.13). The prevalence values were different with regard to age, with a peak in 3- to 4-year-old animals. Average titers in both healthy and clinically ill rabbits at various ages were different; rabbits with overt disease signs had higher titers when very young (<3 months) and from 1 to 4 years of age. In conclusion, this study provides more precise indications of the prevalence of E. cuniculi in pet rabbits in Italy, underlying growing interest and concern among veterinarians and pet owners regarding this organism. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The H1N1 Eurasian avian-like swine (EAsw) influenza viruses originated from an avian H1N1 virus. To characterize potential changes in the membrane fusion activity of the hemagglutinin (HA) during avian-to-swine adaptation of the virus, we studied EAsw viruses isolated in the first years of their circulation in pigs and closely related contemporary H1N1 viruses of wild aquatic birds. Compared to the avian viruses, the swine viruses were less sensitive to neutralization by lysosomotropic agent NH4Cl in MDCK cells, had a higher pH optimum of hemolytic activity, and were less stable at acidic pH. Eight amino acid substitutions in the HA were found to separate the EAsw viruses from their putative avian precursor; four substitutions-T492S, N722D, R752K, and S1132F-were located in the structural regions of the HA2 subunit known to play a role in acid-induced conformational transition of the HA. We also studied low-pH-induced syncytium formation by cell-expressed HA proteins and found that the HAs of the 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009 pandemic viruses required a lower pH for fusion induction than did the HA of a representative EAsw virus. Our data show that transmission of an avian H1N1 virus to pigs was accompanied by changes in conformational stability and fusion promotion activity of the HA. We conclude that distinctive host-determined fusion characteristics of the HA may represent a barrier for avian-to-swine and swine-to-human transmission of influenza viruses. © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.},

abstract={Background. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by Leishmania infantum is endemic in the Mediterranean area. In the last decades a northward spread of the parasite has been observed in Italy. This paper describes a VL outbreak in Modena province (Emilia-Romagna, Northern Italy) between 2012 and 2015. Methods. Retrospective, observational study to evaluate epidemiological, microbiological characteristics, and clinical management of VL in patients referring to Policlinico Modena Hospital. Results. Sixteen cases of VL occurred in the study period. An immunosuppressive condition was present in 81.3%. Clinical presentation included anemia, fever, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and hepatosplenomegaly. Serology was positive in 73.3% of cases, peripheral blood PCR in 92.3%, and bone marrow blood PCR in 100%. Culture was positive in 3/6 cases (50%) and all the isolates were identified as L. infantum by ITS1/ITS2 sequencing. The median time between symptom onset and diagnosis was 22 days (range 6-131 days). All patients were treated with liposomal amphotericin b. 18.8% had a VL recurrence and were treated with miltefosine. Attributable mortality was 6.3%. Conclusions. VL due to L. infantum could determine periodical outbreaks, as the one described; thus it is important to include VL in the differential diagnosis of fever of unknown origin, even in low-endemic areas. © 2016 E.

abstract={Live Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains are widely used as feed additives for dairy cows. Although, perfectly safe and applied in several food processes, the potential contamination of milk by the strain and more generally its possible influence on the microbial profile of milk could be questioned, this concerns particularly traditional cheeses made with raw milk. In an attempt to address these questions, two experiments were performed: A trial in an experimental farm, where two groups of cows, one receiving yeast supplementation and the other one being an unsupplemented control, were compared and a field trial where herds received alternatively yeast-supplemented and control diets. In both cases, viable counts of different microbial groups, including yeasts and molds in general and S. cerevisiae in particular were analysed in tank milk and results from supplemented groups or periods were compared with control ones. No viable S. cerevisiae were detected in any of the samples analysed. Moreover, no noticeable differences in the microbial profiles were observed. This applies also to the evolution of the microbial composition during an experimental cheese processing trial. These data suggest that live yeast additive distributed to dairy cows does not influence milk microbial composition and cheese-making abilities. © 2016 Ester Grilli et al.},

abstract={Diagnostic tests for veterinary surveillance programs should be efficient, easy to use and, possibly, economical. In this context, classic Enzyme linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) remains the most common analytical platform employed for serological analyses. The analysis of pooled samples instead of individual ones is a common procedure that permits to certify, with one single test, entire herds as "disease-free". However, diagnostic tests for pooled samples need to be particularly sensitive, especially when the levels of disease markers are low, as in the case of anti-BoHV1 antibodies in milk as markers of Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR) disease. The avidin-nucleic-acid-nanoassembly (ANANAS) is a novel kind of signal amplification platform for immunodiagnostics based on colloidal polyavidin nanoparticles that, using model analytes, was shown to strongly increase ELISA test performance as compared to monomeric avidin. Here, for the first time, we applied the ANANAS reagent integration in a real diagnostic context. The monoclonal 1G10 anti-bovine IgG1 antibody was biotinylated and integrated with the ANANAS reagents for indirect IBR diagnosis from pooled milk mimicking tank samples from herds with IBR prevalence between 1 to 8%. The sensitivity and specificity of the ANANAS integrated method was compared to that of a classic test based on the same 1G10 antibody directly linked to horse-radish peroxidase, and a commercial IDEXX kit recently introduced in the market. ANANAS integration increased by 5-fold the sensitivity of the 1G10 mAb-based conventional ELISA without loosing specificity. When compared to the commercial kit, the 1G10-ANANAS integrated method was capable to detect the presence of anti-BHV1 antibodies from bulk milk of gE antibody positive animals with 2-fold higher sensitivity and similar specificity. The results demonstrate the potentials of this new amplification technology, which permits improving current classic ELISA sensitivity limits without the need for new hardware investments. © 2016 Casarin et al.

abstract={Our study describes a newly developed mini-array test for the rapid detection of poxviruses in animals and humans. The method is based on detection that combines target nucleic acid amplification by polymerase chain reaction and specific hybridization, using enzyme-linked antibodies, allowing identification of zoonotic orthopoxviruses and parapoxviruses in animal and human biological samples. With 100% specificity, the test rules out the possibility of cross-reactions with viral agents causing look-alike diseases. The assay was employed in the field to investigate the causes of several outbreaks of a malignant proliferative skin disease that affected domestic ruminants in Sicily during 2011–2014. Due to specific aspects of the lesions, the animals were clinically diagnosed with papillomatosis. The mini-array test allowed the identification of coinfections caused by more than 1 viral species belonging to the Parapoxvirus and Orthopoxvirus genera, either in goats or in cattle. Our study suggests that the so-called “papillomatosis” can be the result of multiple infections with epitheliotropic viruses, including zoonotic poxviruses that cannot be properly identified with classical diagnostic techniques. © 2015, © 2015 The Author(s).},

abstract={Next-generation sequencing technology is now being increasingly applied to study the within-and between-host population dynamics of viruses. However, information on avian influenza virus evolution and transmission during a naturally occurring epidemic is still limited. Here, we use deep-sequencing data obtained from clinical samples collected from five industrial holdings and a backyard farm infected during the 2013 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H7N7 epidemic in Italy to unravel (i) the epidemic virus population diversity, (ii) the evolution of virus pathogenicity, and (iii) the pathways of viral transmission between different holdings and sheds. We show a high level of genetic diversity of the HPAI H7N7 viruses within a single farm as a consequence of separate bottlenecks and founder effects. In particular, we identified the cocirculation in the index case of two viral strains showing a different insertion at the hemagglutinin cleavage site, as well as nine nucleotide differences at the consensus level and 92 minority variants. To assess interfarm transmission, we combined epidemiological and genetic data and identified the index case as the major source of the virus, suggesting the spread of different viral haplotypes from the index farm to the other industrial holdings, probably at different time points. Our results revealed interfarm transmission dynamics that the epidemiological data alone could not unravel and demonstrated that delay in the disease detection and stamping out was the major cause of the emergence and the spread of the HPAI strain. © 2016 American Society for Microbiology.},

abstract={Background: Obesity is a common risk factor for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Currently, there are no specific treatments against NAFLD. Thus, examining any molecule with potential benefits against this condition emerged melatonin as a molecule that influences metabolic dysfunctions. The aim of this study was to determine whether melatonin would function against NAFDL, studying morphological, ultrastuctural and metabolic markers that characterize the liver of ob/ob mice. Methods: Lean and ob/ob mice were supplemented with melatonin in the drinking water for 8 weeks. Histology and stereology were performed to assess hepatic steatosis and glycogen deposition. Ultrastructural features of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and their juxtapositions were evaluated in livers of all experimental groups. Furthermore, hepatic distribution and expression of markers of ER and mitochondria (calnexin, ATP sintase β, GRP78 and CHOP) and metabolic dysfunction (RPB4, β-catenin) and cellular longevity (SIRT1) were analyzed. Results: Melatonin significantly reduced glycemia, identified also by a decrease of hepatic RBP4 expression, reversed macrosteatosis in microsteatosis at the hepatic pericentral zone, enlarged ER-mitochondrial distance and ameliorated the morphology and organization of these organelles in ob/ob mouse liver. Furthermore, in ob/ob mice, calnexin and ATP synthase β were partially restored, GRP78 and CHOP decreased in periportal and midzonal hepatocytes and β-catenin expression was, in part, restored in peripheral membranes of hepatocytes. Melatonin supplementation to ob/ob mice improves hepatic morphological, ultrastructural and metabolic damage that occurs as a result of NAFLD. Conclusions: Melatonin may be a potential adjuvant treatment to limit NAFLD and its progression into irreversible complications. © 2016 Stacchiotti et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.},

abstract={Introduction. Salmonella is a ubiquitous pathogen that can infect host species, like wild birds, rodents, and/or arthropods, which may transmit infection to domestic animals and human population. Aim. In order to assess the related risk, a cross-sectional study was performed on 1114 carcasses of wild animals from a north-eastern area of the Emilia-Romagna Region, Italy. Materials and methods. During postmortem examination, intestine samples were cultured. A statistical analysis demonstrated that there is no correlation between the presence of sub-clinically infected animals and greater human population density. In contrast, a significant correlation between the number of carcasses positive for Salmoriclla spp. and greater spatial density of pig, poultry, and cattle farms was observed (p < 0.01). Results. The results of the present study show that wild animals with omnivorous feeding habits are particularly exposed to Salmonella colonization and, consequently, to spreading the organism. Regarding drug resistance, this study confirms the resistance to antimicrobials is increasing in commensal and environmental isolates.},

abstract={Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is an important zoonotic gastrointestinal pathogen responsible for foodborne disease worldwide. It is a successful enteric pathogen because it has developed virulence strategies allowing it to survive in a highly inflamed intestinal environment exploiting inflammation to overcome colonization resistance provided by intestinal microbiota. In this study, we used piglets featuring an intact microbiota, which naturally develop gastroenteritis, as model for salmonellosis. We compared the effects on the intestinal microbiota induced by a wild type and an attenuated S. Typhimurium in order to evaluate whether the modifications are correlated with the virulence of the strain. This study showed that Salmonella alters microbiota in a virulence-dependent manner. We found that the wild type S. Typhimurium induced inflammation and a reduction of specific protecting microbiota species (SCFA-producing bacteria) normally involved in providing a barrier against pathogens. Both these effects could contribute to impair colonization resistance, increasing the host susceptibility to wild type S. Typhimurium colonization. In contrast, the attenuated S. Typhimurium, which is characterized by a reduced ability to colonize the intestine, and by a very mild inflammatory response, was unable to successfully sustain competition with the microbiota. © 2016 Drumo, Pesciaroli, Ruggeri, Tarantino, Chirullo, Pistoia, Petrucci, Martinelli, Moscati, Manuali, Pavone, Picciolini, Ammendola, Gabai, Battistoni, Pezzotti, Alborali, Napolioni, Pasquali and Magistrali.},

abstract={Staphylococcus aureus is globally one of the most important pathogens causing contagious mastitis in cattle. Previous studies using ribosomal spacer (RS)-PCR, however, demonstrated in Swiss cows that Staph. aureus isolated from bovine intramammary infections are genetically heterogeneous, with Staph. aureus genotype B (GTB) and GTC being the most prominent genotypes. Furthermore, Staph. aureus GTB was found to be contagious, whereas Staph. aureus GTC and all the remaining genotypes were involved in individual cow disease. In addition to RS-PCR, other methods for subtyping Staph. aureus are known, including spa typing and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). They are based on sequencing the spa and various housekeeping genes, respectively. The aim of the present study was to compare the 3 analytic methods using 456 strains of Staph. aureus isolated from milk of bovine intramammary infections and bulk tanks obtained from 12 European countries. Furthermore, the phylogeny of animal Staph. aureus was inferred and the zoonotic transfer of Staph. aureus between cattle and humans was studied. The analyzed strains could be grouped into 6 genotypic clusters, with CLB, CLC, and CLR being the most prominent ones. Comparing the 3 subtyping methods, RS-PCR showed the highest resolution, followed by spa typing and MLST. We found associations among the methods but in many cases they were unsatisfactory except for CLB and CLC. Cluster CLB was positive for clonal complex (CC)8 in 99% of the cases and typically positive for t2953; it is the cattle-adapted form of CC8. Cluster CLC was always positive for tbl 2645 and typically positive for CC705. For CLR and the remaining subtypes, links among the 3 methods were generally poor. Bovine Staph. aureus is highly clonal and a few clones predominate. Animal Staph. aureus always evolve from human strains, such that every human strain may be the ancestor of a novel animal-adapted strain. The zoonotic transfer of IMI- and milk-associated strains of Staph. aureus between cattle and humans seems to be very limited and different hosts are not considered as a source for mutual, spontaneous infections. Spillover events, however, may happen. © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.},

Major genotypes with their variants were combined into genotypic clusters (CL). This study revealed 5 major CL representing 76% of all strains and comprised CLB, CLC, CLF, CLI, and CLR. The clusters were characterized by the same genetic properties as the Swiss isolates, demonstrating high clonality of bovine Staph. aureus. Interestingly, CLB was situated in central Europe whereas the other CL were widely disseminated. The remaining 24% of the strains comprised 41 genotypes and variants, some of which (GTAM, GTBG) were restricted to certain countries; many others, however, were observed only once. © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.},

abstract={Background: The aims of this field trial were to describe the clinical-pathologic findings in calves with otitis media (OM) and media-interna (OMI), to evaluate, through the development of a scoring system, the effectiveness of a standardized therapeutic protocol, and to identify the causative pathogens and their possible correlation with concurrent respiratory disease. All animals underwent physical and neurological examinations at three experimental time points: at diagnosis/beginning of treatment (T0), 1 week (T1) and 2 weeks (T2) after therapy was started, respectively. Follow-up telephone interviews with animal owners were conducted 1 month later. The therapeutic protocol consisted of tulathromycin (Draxxin®; Zoetis), oxytetracycline hydrochloride (Terramicina 100®; Zoetis), and carprofen (Rimadyl®; Zoetis). Results: Twenty-two calves were enrolled. Physical and otoscopic examination at T0 revealed monolateral and bilateral otorrhea in 16 and 6 calves, respectively, with peripheral vestibular system involvement in calves presenting with neurological signs (n = 17; 77 %). A significant improvement of clinical and neurological scores was observed in 20 (90 %) calves, a full recovery in only 1 (5 %). One calf worsened between T0 and T1 and it was removed from the study. None of the other animals showed a worsening of clinical conditions and/or required further treatments at one month follow up. Mycoplasma bovis was isolated in 89 % of the affected ears either alone or together with P. multocida (n = 5), Streptococcus spp. (n = 1), Staphylococcus spp. (n = 1), and Pseudomonas spp. (n = 1). M. bovis either alone or together with these bacteria was also isolated from the upper and/or lower respiratory tract in 19 (86 %) calves. Conclusions: This is the first prospective study to evaluate the effectiveness of a standardized therapeutic protocol for the treatment of OM/OMI in calves. The therapy led to clinical improvement in the majority of the calves. Persistence of mild clinical-neurological signs did not compromise productive performance. The numerical scoring system for clinical and neurological signs permitted objective evaluation of response to therapy. M. bovis was the pathogen most often isolated. This finding should be considered in the treatment of OM/OMI in calves. Moreover, respiratory tract infection should not be underrated, since it is one of the major risk factors for the development of OM/OMI. © 2015 Bertone et al.},

abstract={An LC-MS/MS method is proposed for the analysis of sterigmatocystin in cereals and feed. The method is based on a solid–liquid extraction and a dilute-and-shoot approach. Accuracy and precision were established at the LOQ (1 μg kg−1); the mean overall recovery (n = 6) was 98%, with a confidence interval of 3.8% and a CV% of 3.7%. Accuracy and precision were also assessed at three other concentration levels (2.03, 5.07 and 10.14 μg kg−1; six replicates per level). The mean overall recovery (n = 24, LOQ included) was 99% with a confidence interval of 0.8% and a CV% of 1.9%. The method was then applied to 14 naturally incurred feed samples. Aflatoxin B1 was present in the range 28.7–240.1 µg kg−1, while lower concentrations of sterigmatocystin were found (0.7–2.2 µg kg−1). This method may represent a valuable choice, ensuring a high level of accuracy and precision, as well as high-throughput performance. Therefore, it meets the recent EFSA opinion recommendation in terms of availability of fast and sensitive methods (recommended LOQ = 1.5 μg kg−1) in order to increase data collection to allow for the assessment of dietary exposure. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

Four weeks later, they were intranasally challenged with 2 × 105 TCID50 of a PCV2a strain. Antibody was measured in blood and oral fluids by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a neutralization assay. PCV2 was quantified in serum by real-time polymerase chain reaction for ORF2 gene. PCV2-specific cell-mediated responses were investigated by an IFN-γ release assay in whole blood, IFN-γ ELISPOT, and lymphocyte proliferation (Ki-67 and BrDU assays). All the vaccines under study but mock provided complete or incomplete protection from PCV2 infection in terms of post-challenge viremia. Serum antibody titers (ELISA and neutralizing) after vaccination were not correlated with protection, as opposed to the early neutralizing antibody levels of vaccinated pigs at day 7 after infection. Cell-mediated immune parameters showed a good correlation with vaccine efficacy. In particular, the IFN-γ release assay at 3 weeks after vaccination was an effective marker for predicting protection. All control pigs always tested negative in assays of cell-mediated immunity. Our results outline in vitro testing procedures toward reduced animal usage in the control of PCV2 vaccine batches. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.},

abstract={Traditionally, embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) are considered the gold standard for Influenza virus isolation and vaccine production. Nowadays, different biological systems have been improved and performed, in order to evaluate a feasible alternative to ECE. In fact, in a previous study, mammalian and avian cell cultures were successfully used for avian influenza viruses primary isolation from target tissues and virus propagation. This research is focused on the investigation of adaptive mutations that occur after influenza A virus amplification in ECE and cell cultures. The results of the study shows that avian influenza viruses after multiple passages in different biological systems undergo mutations, in particular, the largest number of amino acid substitutions occurred in all biological substrates in the hemagglutinin. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Interferons (IFNs) play a crucial role in the host's immune response and other homeostatic control actions. Three IFN types and several IFN families within the types allow for a plethora of regulatory actions. The number of distinct IFN molecules is highest among type I IFNs and, in particular, within the IFN-α family. In pigs, there are 17 IFN-α subtypes with different antiviral activities and different expression profiles; however, no data are available about biological properties other than the antiviral effector activities. Therefore, 16 porcine IFN-α genes were cloned, expressed in mammalian Chinese hamster ovary cells, and characterized for antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and MHC-modulating activities at a pre-established level of 10 IU/mL. Antiviral activity: IFN-α2, -α5, -α9, and -α10 showed the highest level of activity in a pseudorabies virus yield reduction assay. On the contrary, little, if any, activity was shown by IFN-α3, -α7, -α13, -α4, and -α15. Anti-inflammatory activity: With the exception of IFNs-α2, -α7, -α9, and -α11, all IFN-α subtypes had significant anti-inflammatory control activity in an interleukin-8 (IL-8) yield reduction assay. Gene expression analyses showed that some IFN-α subtypes can significantly downregulate the expression of IL-8, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), IL-6, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), βD1, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-kB) genes, while maintaining or upregulating the expression of βD4. Immunomodulation: A significant upregulation of class I and/or class II MHC was induced by all the IFNs under study, with the exception of IFNs-α11, -α15, and -α16, which instead significantly downregulated class I MHC. Our results indicate that gene duplications in the porcine IFN-α family underlie diverse effector and regulatory activities, being therefore instrumental in host survival and environmental adaptation. This role of IFN-α could be founded on fine-tuning and regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory control actions after exposure to both infectious and noninfectious environmental stressors. © 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract={Although wild boar can act as a persistent Aujeszky’s disease (AD) reservoir, limited data are available on long-term epidemiology in free-ranging wild boar living in areas where industrial swine herds are limited. Hence, this study provides crucial information, which fills this knowledge gap, on the natural dynamics of AD infection. From 3260 sera sampled during eight hunting seasons, 162 (4.97%) were tested positive. Factors, including the animal’s age class, and the sampling year, had significant effects on the probability of the wild boar being seropositive, while wild boar mean abundance per area, yearly abundance and the total number of pig farms, as well as interactions among age, year and sex, were not significant. In particular, a positive trend of seroprevalence was observed over the years, with values ranging from 2.1 to 10.8%. This long-term surveillance showed an increase in seroprevalence with a higher probability of being seropositive in older individuals and the independence of wild boar seropositivity from the likelihood of contact with pigs in the area. © 2015, International Association for Ecology and Health.},

abstract={A 5-month-old female calf hospitalized for diarrhea showed petechial bleedings on the oral, conjunctival and vaginal mucosa. Pulse- and respiratory-rate were respectively 76 bpm and 44 breaths/min. The mental status of the calf was alert, although the appetite was bad. The calf was born in Italy through Ovum Pick Up and in vitro embryo production starting from a donor cow coming from Netherlands. Laboratory analysis were characterized by leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and altered coagulation times. Differential diagnosis consisted in coccidiosis, poisoning by Warfarin, septicemia and type 2 BVDV infection. Other causes of hemorrhagic diathesis such as hemophilia and bovine neonatal pancytopenia were not considered among differential diagnosis due to the age of the subject. After fluid and electrolyte therapy and antibiotic administration, the calf got better, but 5 days later the clinical status worsened. The clinical condition was characterized by mental status depressed, sternal recumbence, severe bloody diarrhea and petechial hemorrhages. The calf died few hours later. BVDV-2 was detected by means of PCR-RT; virus isolation failed due to a low-level viremia. The absence of NS 2-3 antibodies in serum (ELISA) can be explained as sign of immune tolerance or as a first stage of an acute infection; symptoms observed were consistent with a BVDV-2 acute hemorrhagic syndrome. To further confirm the diagnosis, a seroconversion test would have been useful. Data concerning the oocyte donor are not available; oocytes employed for in vitro embryo production have been demonstrated to contain BVDV when they come from infected or persistently infected animals. A few months before, in the same farm, an apparently healthy heifer was found to be positive for BVDV-2. Due to the economic loss related to BVDV infection, many european countries underwent BVDV eradication. BVDV-2 has a lower prevalence than type-1, but the detection of BVDV-2 throughout Europe is increasing. To conclude, BVDV-2 should be now considered among differential diagnosis in case not only of hemorrhagic syndrome but even in case of mild or subclinical disease.},

abstract={Background: The invasive species Aedes (Finlaya) koreicus was first identified in north-eastern Italy in 2011, during the ongoing surveillance activity of Aedes albopictus. Following this finding, a more intensive monitoring was carried out to assess the distribution of the species and to collect biological data. Herein, we report the new records obtained by four years of surveillance. Findings: The presence of Ae. koreicus was checked using ovitraps, adults traps and by larval collections in all possible breeding sites from May 2011 to July 2015. The monitoring started in the site of the first detection (Province of Belluno) and was then extended in the neighbouring Provinces belonging to four Regions. Aedes koreicus was found in 73 municipalities out of 155 monitored (47.1 %), including 23 municipalities (14.8 %) previously not infested. The area of first detection of Ae. koreicus (Province of Belluno) was also the most infested (68 %). However the mosquito has also been found to the west (Province of Trento) and to the south and south-west (Provinces of Vicenza and Treviso) of the initially infested area. Conclusions: The spread of Ae. koreicus is directed towards south and west from the original infested area, likely due to the dense road connections and the habitat suitability of the new areas. According to these records, northern Italy has a high probability to be invaded by Ae. koreicus in the next decade. These data can be useful to validate predictive models of potential distribution and dispersal of this species in Italy or in Europe. © 2015 Montarsi et al.},

abstract={We report the spread of a clone of multidrug-resistant (MDR), ESBL-producing (blaCTX-M-1) Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Infantis, in the Italian broiler chicken industry and along the food-chain. This was first detected in Italy in 2011 and led to human infection in Italy in 2013-2014.A set (n = 49) of extended-spectrum cephalosporin (ESC)-resistant (R) isolates of S. Infantis (2011-2014) from humans, food-producing animals and meat thereof, were studied along with a selected set of earlier and more recent ESC-susceptible (ESC-S) isolates (n = 42, 2001-2014). They were characterized by macrorestriction-PFGE analysis and genetic environment of ESC-resistance. Isolates representative of PFGE-patterns and origin were submitted to Whole Genome Sequencing. The emerging ESC-R clone, detected mainly from broiler chickens, broiler meat and humans, showed a minimum pattern of clinical resistance to cefotaxime, tetracycline, sulfonamides, and trimethoprim, beside ciprofloxacin microbiological resistance (MIC 0.25 mg/L). All isolates of this clone harbored a conjugative megaplasmid (~ 280-320 Kb), similar to that described in ESC-susceptible S. Infantis in Israel (pESI-like) in 2014. This megaplasmid carried the ESBL gene blaCTX-M-1, and additional genes [tet(A), sul1, dfrA1 and dfrA14] mediating cefotaxime, tetracycline, sulfonamide, and trimethoprim resistance. It also contained genes conferring enhanced colonization capability, virulence (fimbriae, yersiniabactin), resistance and fitness (qacE1, mer) in the intensive-farming environment. This emerging clone of S. Infantis has been causing infections in humans, most likely through the broiler industry. Since S. Infantis is among major serovars causing human infections in Europe and is an emerging non-typhoidal Salmonella globally, further spread of this lineage in primary productions deserves quick and thorough risk-management strategies. © 2015 Franco et al. 2015 Franco et al.

abstract={Avian rotaviruses are still largely undefined despite being widespread in several avian species and despite the economic impact of rotavirus (RV) enteritis in poultry flocks. In this study, the presence of different avian RV groups was investigated in commercial poultry flocks reared in Northern and Central Italy and with a history of enteric diseases. Faeces or intestinal contents from different avian species previously found to contain RV particles by electron microscopy (EM) were analysed by both RNA-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction specific for groups A, D, F and G RVs. Group D avian RV was detected in 107 of 117 samples tested (91.5%), whereas groups A, F and G avian RVs were present in 70 (59%), 61 (52.1%) and 31 (26.5%) samples, respectively. Multiple presence of different RV groups was detected in 83% of samples. This study provides novel data on the prevalence of genetically different avian RVs in Italian poultry flocks. This information is useful to elucidate the epidemiology of avian RVs circulating in Italy. © 2015 Houghton Trust Ltd.},

abstract={The monophasic variant of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, namely Salmonella 1,4,[5],12:i-, has been increasingly responsible for foodborne human cases of disease and is most frequently detected in pork, since the variant is widely spread in pig farms.The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of an autologous vaccine in decreasing the prevalence of Salmonella 1,4,[5],12:i-, in pigs. The trial was performed in a multisite pig production system of Northern Italy. The autogenous vaccine was prepared from the Salmonella 1,4,[5],12:i- strain isolated from the clinical case occurring in the Farm. Different immunization protocols were applied, ranging from interventions only in sows or piglets, or both. Microbiological analysis was performed to assess faecal shedding in sows and their offspring from birth till end of the production cycle and organ colonization of slaughtered pigs. Body weight of pigs was recorded at different time-points. Humoral immune response was evaluated in serum samples of sows and piglets.S. Typhimurium 1,4,[5],12:i- determines reduction of animal growth and farm production, furthermore, contamination of carcasses at the slaughterhouse. The load of bacteria entering into the food processing chain is differently influenced by the regimen of administration of inactivated vaccine. In particular, a combined vaccination of sows and their offspring was able to improve the weight gain of growing pigs, to limit Salmonella colonization of organs and to reduce the number of carrier pigs, and hence lowering the risk of introducing Salmonella organisms in the slaughter process. © 2015.},

abstract={Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is a pathogen that infects both animals and humans worldwide. The epidemiology of infection caused by Y. pseudotuberculosis is poorly understood; however, its outbreaks have been traced back to a probable source in wildlife. This study aimed to characterise Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates collected from animals with yersiniosis. This study included 90 isolates of Y. pseudotuberculosis collected from different animals with yersiniosis between 1996 and 2013 in Italy. The isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility and were biotyped. Genes associated with virulence plasmid pYV and those encoding O-antigen, high pathogenicity island (HPI), and superantigenic toxin (YPM) were determined by performing PCR. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed using NotI and SpeI enzymes, and 3 dendrograms were generated. No antibiotic resistance was found. The presence of pYV was shown in 57 out of 90 isolates. Virulence profiles of majority of the isolates indicated that they belonged to O:1a and O:1b serotypes, biotype 1, and genetic type 2. Isolates belonging to O:2a serotype were detected in sheep and cattle and were found to be associated (for the first time) with septicemia in hares. Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates belonging to O:5a and O:12-O13 serotypes were also detected in hares. To our knowledge, this is the first study to detect Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates belonging to the O:12-O13 serotype from a clinical case in Europe. Results of PFGE indicated that it was a reliable method for investigating the genetic relatedness of Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates. Thus, characterisation of Y. pseudotuberculosis infection in animals should be considered a possible tool for the surveillance of pseudotuberculosis. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={West Nile virus (WNV) is a recently re-emerged health problem in Europe. In Italy, an increasing number of outbreaks of West Nile disease, with occurrences of human cases, have been reported since 2008. This is particularly true in northern Italy, where entomological surveillance systems have been implemented at a regional level. The aim of this study was to use, for the first time, all the entomological data collected in the five regions undergoing surveillance for WNV in northern Italy to characterize the viral circulation (at a spatial and temporal scale), identify potential mosquito vectors, and specify relationships between virus circulation and meteorological conditions. In 2013, 286 sites covering the entire Pianura Padana area were monitored. A total of 757,461 mosquitoes were sampled. Of these, 562,079 were tested by real-time PCR in 9,268 pools, of which 180 (1.9%) were positive for WNV. The largest part of the detected WNV sequences belonged to lineage II, demonstrating that, unlike those in the past, the 2013 outbreak was mainly sustained by this WNV lineage. This surveillance also detected the Usutu virus, a WNV-related flavivirus, in 241 (2.6%) pools. The WNV surveillance systems precisely identified the area affected by the virus and detected the viral circulation approximately two weeks before the occurrence of onset of human cases. Ninety percent of the sampled mosquitoes were Culex pipiens, and 178/180 WNV-positive pools were composed of only this species, suggesting this mosquito is the main WNV vector in northern Italy. A significantly higher abundance of the vector was recorded in the WNV circulation area, which was characterized by warmer and less rainy conditions and greater evapotranspiration compared to the rest of the Pianura Padana, suggesting that areas exposed to these conditions are more suitable for WNV circulation. This observation highlights warmer and less rainy conditions as factors able to enhance WNV circulation and cause virus spillover outside the sylvatic cycle. Copyright: © 2015 Calzolari et al.

abstract={In contrast to the depth of knowledge on the pathological effects of parasitism in domestic animals, the impact of the vast majority of parasites on wildlife hosts is poorly understood and, besides, information from domestics is rarely usable to disclose the parasites' impact on free-ranging populations' dynamics. Here we use Toxoplasmosis as a study model since, until now, the infection process and the protozoan's effects in natural conditions has received little attention. We analysed 81 sera from red deer (Cervus elaphus) sampled in Italian Alps and through generalized linear models we evaluated (1) the epidemiological factors influencing T. gondii infection dynamics; (2) its impact on female fertility. High seroprevalence of T. gondii infection was recorded in yearling (1 year-old; prevalence = 52.4%) and adult (>2 year-old; prevalence = 51.3%) red deer, while calves (<1 year-old) did not contract the infection suggesting horizontal transmission as the main route of infection. The stable prevalence between yearlings and adults and the higher serological titres of younger individuals lead to two alternative infection processes suggesting a difference between age classes or in acquiring the infection or in responding to the pathogen. No associations between T. gondii serological titres and pregnancy status was observed indicating no direct effect on the probability of being pregnant; nevertheless a relation between females' higher serological titres and lower foetal development emerged, suggesting potential effects of the parasite infection on deer reproduction. The results demonstrate high seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in free-ranging red deer and, furthermore, the effect on foetal development suggests the potential impact of the parasite on red deer fertility and thus on its population dynamics. © 2015 Formenti et al.},

abstract={Mesophilic anaerobic digestion (MAD) produces renewable energy, but it also plays a role in reducing the impact of digestates, both by reducing odor and pathogen content. Ten full-scale biogas plants characterized by different plant designs (e.g. single digesters, parallel or serial digesters), plant powers (ranging from 180 to 999kWe), hydraulic retention time (HRT) (ranging between 20 to 70days) and feed mixes were monitored and odors and pathogens were observed in both ingestates and digestates.

abstract={Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae is one of the most important causes of nosocomial infections worldwide. After the spread of strains resistant to beta-lactams at the end of the previous century, the diffusion of isolates resistant to carbapenems and colistin is now reducing treatment options and the containment of infections. Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae strains have spread rapidly among Italian hospitals, with four subclades of pandemic clonal group 258 (CG258). Here we show that a single Italian hospital has been invaded by three of these subclades within 27 months, thus replicating on a small scale the "Italian scenario." We identified a single clone responsible for an epidemic outbreak involving seven patients, and we reconstructed its star-like pattern of diffusion within the intensive care unit. This epidemiological picture was obtained through phylogenomic analysis of 16 carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates collected in the hospital during a 27-month period, which were added to a database of 319 genomes representing the available global diversity of K. pneumoniae strains. Phenotypic and molecular assays did not reveal virulence or resistance determinants specific for the outbreak isolates. Other factors, rather than selective advantages, might have caused the outbreak. Finally, analyses allowed us to identify a major subclade of CG258 composed of strains bearing the yersiniabactin virulence factor. Our work demonstrates how the use of combined phenotypic, molecular, and whole-genome sequencing techniques can help to identify quickly and to characterize accurately the spread of MDR pathogens. © 2015 American Society for Microbiology.

abstract={Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most common mastitis-causing pathogens worldwide. In the last decade, livestock-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (LA-MRSA) infections have been described in several species, included the bovines. Hence, this paper investigates the diffusion of MRSA within Italian dairy herds; the strains were further characterized using a DNA microarray, which detects 330 different sequences, including the methicillin-resistance genes mecA and mecC and SCC. mec typing. The analysis of overall patterns allows the assignment to Clonal Complexes (CC). Overall 163 S. aureus isolates, collected from quarter milk samples in 61 herds, were tested. MRSA strains were further processed using spa typing. Fifteen strains (9.2%), isolated in 9 herds (14.75%), carried mecA, but none harboured mecC. MRSA detection was significantly associated (. P<. 0.011) with a within-herd prevalence of S. aureus intra-mammary infections (IMI) ≤5%. Ten MRSA strains were assigned to CC398, the remaining ones to CC97 (. n=. 2), CC1 (. n=. 2) or CC8 (. n=. 1). In 3 herds, MRSA and MSSA co-existed: CC97-MRSA with CC398-MSSA, CC1-MRSA with CC8-MSSA and CC398-MRSA with CC126-MSSA. The results of spa typing showed an overall similar profile of the strains belonging to the same CC: t127-CC1, t1730-CC97, t899 in 8 out of 10 CC398. In the remaining 2 isolates a new spa type, t14644, was identified. The single CC8 was a t3092. The SCC. mec cassettes were classified as type IV, type V or type IV/V composite. All or most strains harboured the genes encoding the β-lactamase operon and the tetracycline resistance. Streptogramin resistance gene was related to CC398. Enterotoxin and leukocidin genes were carried only by CC1, CC8 and CC97-MRSA. The persistence of MRSA clones characterized by broader host range, in epidemiologically unrelated areas and in dairy herds with low prevalence of S. aureus IMI, might enhance the risk for adaptation to human species. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract={Background: Tularemia is a zoonosis caused by the Francisella tularensis, a highly infectious Gramnegative coccobacillus. Due to easy dissemination, multiple routes of infection, high environmental contamination and morbidity and mortality rates, Francisella is considered a potential bioterrorism threat and classified as a category A select agent by the CDC. Tick bites are among the most prevalent modes of transmission, and ticks have been indicated as a possible reservoir, although their reservoir competence has yet to be defined. Tickborne transmission of F. tularensis was recognized in 1923, and transstadial transmission has been demonstrated in several tick species. Studies on transovarial transmission, however, have reported conflicting results. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of ticks as reservoirs for Francisella, assessing the transovarial transmission of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica in ticks, using experimentally-infected females of Dermacentor reticulatus and Ixodes ricinus. Results: Transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization showed F. tularensis within oocytes. However, cultures and bioassays of eggs and larvae were negative; in addition, microscopy techniques revealed bacterial degeneration/death in the oocytes. Conclusions: These results suggest that bacterial death might occur in oocytes, preventing the transovarial transmission of Francisella. We can speculate that Francisella does not have a defined reservoir, but that rather various biological niches (e.g. ticks, rodents), that allow the bacterium to persist in the environment. Our results, suggesting that ticks are not competent for the bacterium vertical transmission, are congruent with this view. Copyright © 2015 Genchi et al.},

abstract={Background: A sudden decline of the European brown hare (Lepus europaeus) population in one of the best hunting districts for small game species in northern Germany, the German North-Sea island Pellworm, in the years 2007/08 following marked habitat changes led to the implementation of a thorough health assessment program of the population. 110 animals were collected during the normal hunting season in the years 2010 and 2011. A post-mortem examination and histopathological investigation was performed on all animals. Additionally, routine bacteriology of the small intestine and parasitology were carried out. Sera of hares were tested for European Brown Hare Syndrome (EBHS) by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, and for Treponema sp. by indirect immunofluorescent test. Additional testing was performed when deemed necessary. Results: The most striking result was a shift in the intestinal bacterial flora towards Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae with a predominance of either Escherichia coli, or Aeromonas sp., or a high-grade double-infection with these two pathogens with subsequent catarrhal enteritis. Additionally, a marked coccidiosis, and varying infestations with the nematode Trichostrongylus retortaeformis were found. The sero-prevalence for EBHS was 78.1%, and for Treponema 43.9%. Conclusions: The shift and decrease in diversity of the intestinal flora was the main and most consistent result found. In the authors' opinion the change of the habitat combined with other stressors increased the animals' sensitivity to ubiquitous bacterial species and parasites which usually would not have such fatal effects. © 2015 Posautz et al.},

abstract={Influenza A virus is the principal agent responsible of the respiratory tract's infections in humans. Every year, highly pathogenic and infectious strains with new antigenic assets appear, making ineffective vaccines so far developed. The discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) opened the way to the progress of new promising drugs against Influenza A virus and also to the introduction of disease resistance traits in genetically modified animals. In this paper, we show that Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell line expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) cassette, designed on a specific conserved region of the nucleoprotein (NP) viral genome, can strongly inhibit the viral replication of four viral strains sharing the target sequence, reducing the viral mRNA respectively to 2.5 × 10-4, 7.5 × 10-5, 1.7 × 10-3, 1.9 × 10-4 compared to the control, as assessed by real-time PCR. Moreover, we demonstrate that during the challenge with a viral strain bearing a single mismatch on the target sequence, although a weaker inhibition is observed, viral mRNA is still lowered down to 1.2 × 10-3 folds in the shRNA-expressing clone compared to the control, indicating a broad potential use of this approach. In addition, we developed a highly predictive and fast screening test of siRNA sequences based on dual-luciferase assay, useful for the in vitro prediction of the potential effect of viral inhibition. In conclusion, these findings reveal new siRNA sequences able to inhibit Influenza A virus replication and provide a basis for the development of siRNAs as prophylaxis and therapy for influenza infection both in humans and animals. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Milk supplied to a dairy plant in Brescia City (Northern Italy) was found to be contaminated by dioxin like PCBs at levels above the European (EU) action limit (2 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat). As a consequence, 14 dairy farms were sampled individually, in order to identify and possibly eliminate the source of contamination. All the farms were located in Brescia or just nearby, an area that is characterized by a strong industrialization. Four out of the 14 farms showed contamination levels above the legal maximum limit set by European Commission at 5.5 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat for the sum of dioxins and DL-PCBs. Concentrations of 8.16, 6.83, 5.71 and 5.65 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat were detected. In the three most polluted farms, cow ration was substituted with feed coming from uncontaminated areas and the time needed to reduce milk pollution was evaluated. In all the three farms, contamination levels dropped below the EU legal limit after only 1 month from the removal of the pollution source. In each sampled farm, DL-PCBs were the major contributors to the total WHO-TEQ level, with percentages up to 87 % in the most contaminated one. PCB 126 WHO-TEQ value explained by itself large part of this contamination, and its decrease was fundamental for the reduction of milk contamination levels. This study provides an example of an on-field successful emergency intervention that succeeded in decontamination of dairy cows, allowing a fast restart of their production activity. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Poly-γ-glutamate (γ-PGA) is an industrially interesting polymer secreted mainly by members of the class Bacilli which forms a shield able to protect bacteria from phagocytosis and phages. Few enzymes are known to degrade γ-PGA; among them is a phage-encoded γ-PGA hydrolase, PghP. The supposed role of PghP in phages is to ensure access to the surface of bacterial cells by dismantling the γ-PGA barrier. We identified four unannotated B. subtilis genes through similarity of their encoded products to PghP; in fact these genes reside in prophage elements of B. subtilis genome. The recombinant products of two of them demonstrate efficient polymer degradation, confirming that sequence similarity reflects functional homology. Genes encoding similar γ-PGA hydrolases were identified in phages specific for the order Bacillales and in numerous microbial genomes, not only belonging to that order. The distribution of the γ-PGA biosynthesis operon was also investigated with a bioinformatics approach; it was found that the list of organisms endowed with γ-PGA biosynthetic functions is larger than expected and includes several pathogenic species. Moreover in non-Bacillales bacteria the predicted γ-PGA hydrolase genes are preferentially found in species that do not have the genetic asset for polymer production. Our findings suggest that γ-PGA hydrolase genes might have spread across microbial genomes via horizontal exchanges rather than via phage infection.We hypothesize that, in natural habitats rich in γ-PGA supplied by producer organisms, the availability of hydrolases that release glutamate oligomers from γ-PGA might be a beneficial trait under positive selection.

abstract={Heterogeneity in transmission and stochastic events can play a significant role in shaping the epidemic dynamics of vector-borne infections, especially in the initial phase of an outbreak. In this work, by using multi-type branching process methodologies, we assess how heterogeneities in transmission among a large number of host groups can affect the invasion probabilities of a mosquito-borne disease.We show with both analytical and numerical methods that heterogeneities in transmission can shape the invasion probabilities differently from how they affect the basic reproduction number (R<inf>0</inf>). In particular, we find that, while R<inf>0</inf> always increases with the heterogeneity, the invasion probability after the introduction of infected hosts can decrease with the increase of transmission heterogeneity, even approaching zero when the number of host groups is very large. In addition, we show that the invasion probability via infected vectors is always larger than via infected hosts when heterogeneous transmission is sufficiently high.Our findings suggest that, for multi-species infections (e.g. West Nile fever and Rift Valley fever) or for single-species infections with patchy host distribution, the introduction of primary infected vectors may represent a higher risk for major outbreaks occurrence than introductions of infected hosts. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Paratuberculosis of ruminants is characterised by chronic enteritis but, at advanced stages of the disease, a systemic dissemination of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) in tissues and organs can occur. MAP has been recovered from lymph nodes and muscles of clinical and sub-clinical cows. In most countries, dairy and beef cattle infected with paratuberculosis are routinely sent to slaughter and the consumption of their meat could be a possible route of human exposure to MAP. However, few studies on MAP in ground beef are currently available. During the period November 2013-March 2014 we carried out a survey on the ground beef produced in an industrial meat processing plant. One-hundred and forty samples of ground meat were analysed by IS900-qPCR and culture (VersaTrek System®). The limit of detection (LOD) of qPCR was 630 MAP cells/g (107 CFU/g) while the LOD for culture was 170-230 MAP cells/g (62-115 CFU/g). No samples were positive by direct IS900 qPCR, while two samples were positive by liquid culture. Our data suggest that the presence of live MAP in raw minced meat is possible. In order to avoid exposure for humans through the consumption of contaminated meat, proper cooking of meat is recommended. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Aujeszky's disease (AD) is one of the most economically important diseases of farmed pigs. Wild boars can act as reservoirs and might represent a potential threat for domestic animals, including dogs. The aim of this study was to report the results of an AD survey based on the Pseudorabies virus (PRV) genome detection in samples of dogs clinically suspected of AD and of wild boars collected during four consecutive hunting seasons in the period 2010-2014. Genomic characterization was based on the partial gC sequence of the Italian strains and the comparison with those from domestic pigs and European PRV strains circulating in wild boars. The Italian PRV strains were mainly distributed into three different clusters and revealed two interesting findings. First, there was a clear distinction between the viral strains that were isolated from dogs used for hunting and subsequently traced back to wild boars and the strains that were isolated from working dogs and subsequently found to be closely related to domestic pigs. Second, the Italian epidemiological situation was found to be different from those of European countries in that the Italian situation was characterized by the presence of both the typical Italian clades 1 and 2 and supported by new patterns of aa deletions/insertions. Italian clade 1 included strains from hunting dogs and two Italian wild boars, and Italian clade 2 grouped with recent strains from dogs that were unable to hunt and domestic pigs that were related to one old reference strain (S66) and not included elsewhere. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses of PRV strains are therefore necessary to improve the understanding of the distribution of the PRV clusters and their evolution. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Assessing the performance of a surveillance system for infectious diseases of domestic animals is a challenging task for health authorities. Therefore, it is important to assess what strategy is the most effective in identifying the onset of an epidemic and in minimizing the number of infected farms.The aim of the present work was to evaluate the performance of the bovine tuberculosis (bTB) surveillance system in the network of dairy farms in the Emilia-Romagna (ER) Region, Italy. A bTB-free Region since 2007, ER implements an integrated surveillance strategy based on three components, namely routine on-farm tuberculin skin-testing performed every 3 years, tuberculin skin-testing of cattle exchanged between farms, and post-mortem inspection at slaughterhouses. We assessed the effectiveness of surveillance by means of a stochastic network model of both within-farm and between-farm bTB dynamics calibrated on data available for ER dairy farms. Epidemic dynamics were simulated for five scenarios: the current ER surveillance system, a no surveillance scenario that we used as the benchmark to characterize epidemic dynamics, three additional scenarios in which one of the surveillance components was removed at a time so as to outline its significance in detecting the infection. For each scenario we ran Monte Carlo simulations of bTB epidemics following the random introduction of an infected individual in the network. System performances were assessed through the comparative analysis of a number of statistics, including the time required for epidemic detection and the total number of infected farms during the epidemic.Our analysis showed that slaughterhouse inspection is the most effective surveillance component in reducing the time for disease detection, while routine surveillance in reducing the number of multi-farms epidemics. On the other hand, testing exchanged cattle improved the performance of the surveillance system only marginally. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={Negative staining electron microscopy methods can be employed for the diagnosis of viral particles in animal samples. In fact, negative staining electron microscopy methods are used to identify viruses, especially in minor species and wild animals, when no other methods are available and in cases of rare, emerging or re-emerging infections. In particular, immune-electron-microscopy with convalescent sera is employed to detect etiological agents when there are undiagnosed clinical outbreaks, when alternative diagnostic methods fail due to the lack of immunological reagents and primers, and when there is no indicative clinical suspect. An overview of immune-electron-microscopy with convalescent sera’s use in the diagnosis of new and unsuspected viruses in animals of domestic and wild species is provided through the descriptions of the following four diagnostic veterinary cases: (I) enteric viruses of pigs: Porcine Rotavirus, Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, Porcine Circovirus and Porcine Torovirus; (II) Rotavirus and astrovirus in young turkeys with enteritis; (III) Parvovirus-like particles in pheasants; and (IV) Lagoviruses: Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus and European Brown Hare Syndrome Virus. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={West Nile virus (WNV) is continuously spreading across Europe, and other continents, i.e. North and South America and many other regions of the world. Despite the overall sporadic nature of outbreaks with cases of West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WNND) in Europe, the spillover events have increased and the virus has been introduced into new areas. The high genetic diversity of the virus, with remarkable phenotypic variation, and its endemic circulation in several countries, require an intensification of the integrated and multidisciplinary research efforts built under the 7th Framework Programme of the European Union (FP7). It is important to better clarify several aspects of WNV circulation in Europe, including its ecology, genomic diversity, pathogenicity, transmissibility, diagnosis and control options, under different environmental and socio-economic scenarios. Identifying WNV endemic as well as infection-free areas is becoming a need for the development of human vaccines and therapeutics and the application of blood and organs safety regulations. This review, produced as a joint initiative among European experts and based on analysis of 118 scientific papers published between 2004 and 2014, provides the state of knowledge on WNV and highlights the existing knowledge and research gaps that need to be addressed with high priority in Europe and neighbouring countries. © 2015, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

abstract={Background: Bovine Amyloidotic Spongiform Encephalopathy (BASE) is a variant of classical BSE that affects cows and can be transmitted to primates and mice. BASE is biochemically different from BSE and shares some molecular and histo-pathological features with the MV2 sub-type of human sporadic Creutzfeld Jakob Disease (sCJD). Results: The present work examined the effects of BASE on gene expression in circulating immune cells. Ontology analysis of genes differentially expressed between cattle orally challenged with brain homogenate from cattle following intracranial inoculation with BASE and control cattle identified three main pathways which were affected. Within the immune function pathway, the most affected genes were related to the T cell receptor-mediated T cell activation pathways. The differential expression of these genes in BASE challenged animals at 10,12 and 24months following challenge, vs unchallenged controls, was investigated by real time PCR. Conclusions: The results of this study show that the effects of prion diseases are not limited to the CNS, but involve the immune system and particularly T cell signalling during the early stage following challenge, before the appearance of clinical signs. © 2015 Trovato et al.},

abstract={The development of effective feeding strategies to reduce the detrimental effect of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli F4ac (ETEC) plays a crucial role in reducing the occurrence of therapeutic intervention with antibiotics in livestock. The ability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-4407 (SCC), supplied in different patterns to counteract ETEC infection in weaned pigs, was evaluated. Fifty pigs weaned at 24 d were then divided into 5 groups: control (CO), CO + colistin (AB), CO + 5 × 1010 cfu of SCC/ kg feed, from d 0 to 21 (PR), CO + 5 × 1010 cfu of SCC/ kg feed from d 7 to 11 (CM), and CO + 1 shot of 2 × 1011 cfu of SCC when the first diarrhea appeared (CU). On d 7 postweaning, all the pigs were orally challenged with 108 cfu of ETEC. Blood samples were taken from the pigs (d 7, 8, 12, and 21) while the fecal excretion of ETEC was assessed on d 7 and 10. Fecal consistency was scored from 12 h before infection to 144 h postinfection (p.i.). On d 21, the pigs were sacrificed. The in vitro adhesion test on the intestinal villi confirmed individual susceptibility to ETEC, excluding the presence of resistant pigs. Growth performance did not differ between the treatments. Mortality was reduced in the AB group (P &lt; 0.01) and, marginally, in the PR group (P = 0.089) when compared to the CO group. The CO group had a higher fecal score than AB in the period of observation (from P = 0.01 to P &lt; 0.001). Yeast administration reduced the fecal score when compared to the CO group 12 and 48 h p.i. (P = 0.04). Total IgA never differed among the treatments, but the ETECspecific IgA concentration was lower in the AB group than in CO (P = 0.04) at d 12. Four days p.i., the pigs fed live yeast had reduced ETEC excretion compared with the CO pigs (P = 0.05). Blood concentrations of dodecenoyl-L-carnitine (P &lt; 0.01), glutaryl-L-carnitine/hydroxyhexanoyl-L-carnitine, phosphatidylcholine diacyl and phosphatidylcholine diacyl (P = 0.01 and P &lt; 0.01, respectively), and α-amino adipic acid (P &lt; 0.01) were reduced in the AB group compared to the CO group; PR + CM reduced the concentration of sphingomyelin-ceramide (P = 0.02) and increased the concentration of decadienyl-L-carnitine (C10:2; P = 0.02) vs. CO. The CM group had an increased concentration of C10:2 (P &lt; 0.01) compared to the PR group. In conclusion, the administration of live yeast, even in concomitance with ETEC infections, reduces pig illness and mortality.

abstract={Background: Understanding wildlife disease ecology is becoming an urgent need due to the continuous emergence and spread of several wildlife zoonotic diseases. West Nile Virus (WNV) is the most widespread arthropod-borne virus in the world, and in recent decades there has been an increase both in geographic range, and in the frequency of symptomatic infections in humans and wildlife. The principal vector for WNV in Europe is the common house Culex pipiens mosquito, which feeds on a wide variety of vertebrate host species. Variation in mosquito feeding preference has been described as one of the most influential parameters driving intensity and timing of WNV infection in the United States, but feeding preferences for this species have been little studied in Europe. Methods: Here, we estimated feeding preference for wild Cx. pipiens in northern Italy, using molecular analysis to identify the origin of blood meals, and avian census to control host abundance variations. Additionally, we used host bird odour extracts to test experimentally mosquito preferences in the absence of environmental variations. Results: For the first time, we demonstrate a clear feeding preference for the common blackbird (Turdus merula), both for wild collected specimens and in the lab, suggesting a potential important role for this species in the WNV epidemiology in Europe. A seasonal decrease in abundance of blackbirds is associated with increased feeding on Eurasian magpies (Pica pica), and this may be linked to seasonal emergence of WNV in humans. Feeding preferences on blackbirds are more marked in rural areas, while preference for magpies is higher in peridomestic areas. Other species, such as the house sparrow (Passer domesticus) appear to be selected by mosquitoes opportunistically in relation to its abundance. Conclusions: Our findings provide new insights into the ecology of Cx. pipiens in Europe and may give useful indications in terms of implementing targeted WNV surveillance plans. However, a clearer understanding of spatio-temporal variations of Cx. pipiens feeding preferences, and targeted studies on reservoir competence for WNV for these species are therefore now urgently needed as this is essential to describe disease dynamics and quantify virus transmission risk. © 2015 Rizzoli et al.; licensee BioMed Central.},

abstract={Pyrazinamide-resistant Mycobacterium bovis isolates of animal origin were assessed for drug susceptibility to five antituberculosis drugs by the agar based Middlebrook 7H11 method as gold standard as well as by a simplified, dichotomous resazurin microtitre assay (d-REMA). Methods: A total of 53. M. bovis isolates were typed and tested against isoniazid, rifampin, streptomycin, ethambutol, kanamycin and the control drug pyrazinamide. On the basis of the results obtained, pncA and embB genes were PCR-amplified and DNA-sequenced for all isolates. Results: All M. bovis isolates, classified into 21 spoligotype/MIRU-VNTR profiles, were resistant to pyrazinamide by both methods, as expected. The pncA gene sequencing confirmed the presence of the resistance-conferring H57D mutation. All strains were found to be susceptible to the other five drugs by the agar based gold standard method. The d-REMA was in agreement with these results for all five drugs, with the exception of 12 isolates, which showed ambiguous and therefore inconclusive results in ethambutol testing. Mutations in the embB gene were observed in all 53 isolates: four new single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified. No association was found between embB genetic profiles and ethambutol resistance results by the gold standard. Conclusion: All M. bovis isolates were sensitive to the most common antituberculosis drugs used for treatment. There was a good agreement between the d-REMA assay and the agar based reference method. Among ethambutol susceptible isolates, four new embB mutations were found. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={The use of antibiotics on lactating cows should be monitored for the possible risk of milk contamination with residues. Accordingly, Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs) are established by the European Commission to guarantee consumers safety. As pointed out by Dec 2002/657/EC, screening is the first step in the strategy for antibiotic residue control, thus playing a key role in the whole control procedure. However, current routine screening methods applied in milk chain still fail to detect residues of quinolones at concentrations of interest.This paper reports the findings of a new bio-optical method for the screening of quinolones residues in bovine milk, based on E. coli ATCC 11303 growth inhibition.The effect of blank and spiked cow milk samples (aliquots equivalents to 0.8%, v/v) is evaluated in Mueller Hinton Broth (MHb) and MHb enriched with MgSO 4 2% (MHb-Mg) inoculated with the test strain at the concentration of 10 4 CFU/mL.The presence of quinolones inhibits the cellular growth in MHb, while this effect is neutralized in MHb-Mg allowing both detection and presumptive identification of quinolones.Growth of the test strain is monitored at 37°C in a Bioscreen C automated system, and Optical Density (OD) at 600nm is recorded every 10min after shaking for 10s. Growth curves (OD vs. time) of E. coli ATCC 11303 are assessed in milk samples, with and without quinolones, and their differences in terms of δOD (δOD 600nm =OD MHb-Mg -OD MHb ) are calculated.The presence of quinolones is detected by the cellular growth inhibition (OD vs time, none increase in the value OD) and presumptively identified through the increase of the slope of δOD 600nm curve (δOD vs. time), after about 3h of incubation.The detection limit for ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin is at the level of MRL, for marbofloxacin is at 2-fold the MRL whereas for danofloxacin is at 4-fold the MRL. Although the sensitivity of the method could be further improved and the procedure automated, it is a promising step forward to integrate screening assays into the control process and, in particular, to fill in the gap for quinolones; moreover, these technological developments contribute to the One Health perspective through the monitoring of safe and correct use of veterinary antibiotics. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Porcine Circovirus 2 (PCV2) is involved in porcine circovirus-associated disease, that causes great economic losses to the livestock industry worldwide. Vaccination against PCV2 proved to be very effective in reducing disease occurrence and it is currently performed on a large scale. Starting from a previous model concerning Foot-and Mouth Disease Virus antigens, we developed a rapid and simple method to quantify PCV2 whole virion particles in inactivated vaccines. This procedure, based on sucrose gradient analysis and fluorometric evaluation of viral genomic content, allows for a better standardization of the antigen payload in vaccine batches. It also provides a valid indication of virion integrity. Most important, such a method can be applied to whole virion vaccines regardless of the production procedures, thus enabling meaningful comparisons on a common basis. In a future batch consistency approach to PCV2 vaccine manufacture, our procedure represents a valuable tool to improve in-process controls and to guarantee conformity of the final product with passmarks for approval. This might have important repercussions in terms of reduced usage of animals for vaccine batch release, in the framework of the current 3Rs policy. © 2015 The International Alliance for Biological Standardization.},

Blood samples of 75 cows from 26 herds were collected before calving between - 23 and - 33 days (T1) and also between - 2 and - 6 days (T2) to investigate a panel of clinical immunology and chemistry parameters. Cows with abnormal serum lysozyme and interleukin-6 concentrations showed a greater disease prevalence until the 60th day in milk compared with non-responder cows (P < 0.05 and lower at T1). Differences in disease prevalence were observed on the basis of T1 data, and also by combining the results at T1 and T2. The other laboratory parameters under study were not predictive of a disease risk. Results indicate that environmental stressors in the dry period may cause a negative imprinting of the innate immune response, underlying predisposition to later disease occurrence. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={In 2012-2013 Emilia-Romagna Region introduced a monitoring plan for Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) in foodstuff. Six hundred eighty-nine meat samples and 273 fruit and vegetable products were analyzed according to ISOTS13136. Pre-enriched samples were tested by multiplex real time PCR targeting the virulence genes eae, stx1 and stx2. Stx2 positive samples were investigated for the presence of serogroup O104 associated gene. O103, O111, O145, O157, O26 associated genes were tested on samples positive for stx in association with eae gene. Isolation of E. coli strains was attempted from samples positive for serogroup-associated genes. Thirty-four meat products (4.9%) resulted positive for stx1 and/or stx2 genes and 46 (6.7%) for stx1 and/or stx2 genes in association with eae gene. Forty-five (6.5%) samples resulted positive at least at one serogroup. Serogroup O103, O104, O111, O145, O157 and O26 genes were detected respectively in 1.3, 0.3, 0.1, 3.9, 2.9 and 2.5% samples; 0.6% samples resulted positive for STEC isolation (2 E. coli O103 and 2 E. coli O157). It is worth noting that STEC virulence genes were detected at high frequency (19%) in fresh pork meat sausages. Four (1.5%) vegetable samples were positive for stx1 and/or stx2 genes and 1 (0.4%) for stx1 and/or stx2 genes in association with eae gene; none resulted positive for the tested serogroups. Only a low number of samples positive by molecular methods were confirmed by cultural isolation. It is therefore of the uttermost importance for appropriate risk management, to be fully aware of the meaning of the analytical result. © L. Bardasi et al., 2015.},

abstract={Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is the etiological agent of paratuberculosis, a chronic contagious bacterial disease primarily affecting dairy cattle. Paratuberculosis represents a dual problem for the milk production chain: in addition to economic losses to affected herds, MAP may have zoonotic potential. Infected herds must be identified in order to implement programs designed to reduce the incidence of disease within and between herds and to prevent MAP from entering the food chain. The objective of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a screening sampling plan (SSP) to detect MAP-positive dairy cattle herds by repetitive analysis of bulk tank milk (BTM) samples by ELISA and in-line milk filter (ILMF) samples by real-time PCR. Samples from BTM and ILMF were collected twice from 569 dairy herds in southern Italy. Additionally, 12,312 individual milk samples were collected: 9,509 from 102 SSP-positive herds and 2,803 from 24 randomly selected SSP-negative herds. In our study we detected a total of 121 SSP-positive herds (i.e., 21.3%; 95% CI: 18.0-24.9%); the within-herd apparent prevalence (AP) ranged between 0.00 and 22.7% (mean 5.7%). A significant difference in within-herd AP was shown between SSP-positive herds and SSP-negative herds. A highly significant association was shown between the median AP herd status (>5%) and positivity to at least one ILMF or BTM sample. The SSP detected a minimum of 56.2% of low AP herds (AP ≤2.0%) up to a maximum of 100% of herds with a within-herd AP ≥8.0%. Overall, the SSP detected 85.6% of herds in which at least one individual milk sample was positive by ELISA. The proposed SSP was an inexpensive and useful tool to detect MAP-positive herds with a higher risk of infection diffusion and milk contamination. Although the SSP cannot be used for MAP-free certification of herds, it could be useful to prioritize appropriate control measures aimed at reducing the prevalence of infection in dairy herds and milk contamination.},

abstract={Staphylococcus aureus is a known major cause of foodborne illnesses, and raw milk and dairy products are often contaminated by enterotoxigenic and antimicrobial-resistant S. aureus strains. In the present study, 35 S. aureus strains were isolated from 383 raw milk samples collected from various dairy herds in the province of Milan (northern Italy). The isolates were characterized based on their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and the presence of genes encoding staphylococcal enterotoxins (sea, seb, sec, sed, and see). About half (45.7%) of the strains were enterotoxigenic, and 37.1% were resistant to at least one of the antimicrobial drugs tested. Seven (20%) of 35 isolates were identified as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and SCCmec typing performed with a multiplex PCR assay revealed the presence of gene cassettes IV and V, typical of communityacquired MRSA, and I and II, characteristic of health care-associated MRSA. The MRSA strains were evaluated for the presence of the Panton-Valentine leukocidin gene, but this gene was not found. The results of the present study revealed the presence of toxin-producing S. aureus and MRSA strains in raw milk. MRSA and enterotoxigenic S. aureus in dairy farms are an important risk factor for the spread of staphylococcal infections; therefore, further studies are needed to find strategies for monitoring and controlling the presence of S. aureus, especially MRSA, in dairy products.

abstract={Background: Paenibacillus larvae is the etiological agent of American foulbrood (AFB), a widespread and severe bacterial brood disease of honey bees. The genomic characterization of P. larvae strains by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus–polymerase chain reaction (ERIC–PCR) is able to differentiate four genotypes (ERIC I, ERIC II, ERIC III, ERIC IV). The information on the presence of P. larvae ERIC genotypes worldwide is few. Objectives: We have characterized P. larvae strains isolated in Italy from AFB outbreaks to obtain information on ERIC genotypes and phenotypes of the strains circulating in the country. Methods: A total of 117 P. larvae isolates from 115 AFB outbreaks occurring in 2008–2012 were subjected to phenotypic and genetic characterization. Results: The genomic characterization allowed the identification of ERIC I and ERIC II genotypes. Examining the data of Northern and Central Italy separately it was noted that in Northern Italy most outbreaks were caused by the ERIC I genotype (78.6%), followed by the ERIC II genotype (18.6%) and by co-infections (ERIC I + ERIC II) (2.6%). In Central Italy, only outbreaks caused by the ERIC I genotype were observed. With regard to phenotypic characteristics all examined strains of ERIC II genotype fermented fructose while no strains of ERIC I genotype possessed this ability. Conclusion: Both P. larvae ERIC I and ERIC II genotypes were isolated from the AFB outbreaks, but ERIC II genotype was isolated only in Northern Italy. The fermentation of fructose seems to be a genotype-specific biochemical marker. © 2015, Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Four-hundred and forty-two F4+ pathogenic Escherichia coli were isolated in a period of 10 years (2002-2011), from pigs that were suffering from diarrhoea belonging to Italian swine herds. The strains were analysed for their susceptibility to 12 antimicrobials using the disc diffusion method. During the study period, a statistically significant proportion of isolates resistant to enrofloxacin (14.5-89.3%), marbofloxacin (5.4-60.7%), flumequine (49.1-92.9%), danofloxacin (21.6-80%), florfenicol (9.8-64.3%), thiamphenicol (50-92%) and cefquinome (3.8-44%) was recorded. An increase in resistance (not statistically significant) to gentamicin (63.6-85.7%), apramycin (61.8-82.1%), trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (75-89.3%), tetracycline (97-100%) and erythromycin (92.4-100%) was also observed. Based on antimicrobial multiresistance, the strains were collected into three groups: I. resistant to 2-5 antimicrobials; II. resistant to 6-8 antimicrobials; III. resistant to 9-12 antimicrobials. The number of isolates belonging to the first group showed a statistically significant decrease (P &lt; 0.05; R2 = 0.896; r = -0.9608), while the isolates belonging to the second and third groups showed a statistically significant increase in resistance (P &lt; 0.05; R2 = 0.753; r = 0.8890 and P &lt; 0.05; R2 = 0.727; r = 0.8701, respectively) over the period of study.

abstract={The present trial investigated the effect of PCV2 vaccination on viremia, virus shedding and viral load in maternal tissues and foetuses of conventional gilts inseminated with PCV2b-spiked semen. Twelve gilts were randomly divided into two groups of six animals each (vaccinated infected, VI; non-vaccinated infected, NVI). Estrus synchronization was followed by artificial insemination (AI) with a single PCV2 negative semen dose supplemented with 0.2 mL of a PCV2b suspension containing 104.4 TCID<inf>50</inf>/50 μL (total viral dose: 105 TCID<inf>50</inf>). Vaginal, nasal and faecal swabs, and blood samples were collected weekly from two days before artificial insemination till the end of the experimental period (55 days post AI; DPAI) and tested by real-time PCR (qPCR) for PCV2; sera were tested for anti- PCV2 antibodies. During necropsy foetal and maternal tissues were collected for qPCR and histopathology. In each of the VI and NVI groups three out of the six gilts were pregnant at 29 DPAI. The VI group showed a significantly lower proportion of PCR-positive swabs: 24.6% VI vs 71.3% NVI. PCV2 clearance was demonstrated by qPCR in lymphoid tissue during the trial in the VI group. Only one foetus was PCV2-positive (in the NVI group) and three amniotic fluids of the NVI group. PCV2 was found in a significantly lower proportion of the placenta of foetuses in the VI group (39%) than the NVI group (77%). The PCV2 vaccine seems to play an active role in reducing virus shedding, tissue viral load and foetoplacental infection. © 2015 PVJ.},

abstract={Introduction: The problem of antimicrobial resistance is considered by the international scientific community one of the main public health topics, both in human and veterinary medicine. Knowledge about the real antimicrobial consumption is essential for setting an efficient strategy focused on their rational and prudent use. In fact, only starting from the real consumption data in different zootechnical sectors, will it be possible to build strategies for an effective reduction of antibiotic use in animals. Aim: This study was carried out to determine the antibiotic consumption during 2012 in a sample of 50 dairy cattle farms in the province of Piacenza. Since the collection of data through an informative system was not available, we checked all the veterinary prescriptions collected in the selected farms. Materials and methods: Through the verification of recorded treatments and using the official checklists for drug surveillance in the Emilia Romagna region, we calculated the total consumption of the different classes of antibiotics, and compliance with leaflet prescriptions. Finally, we analyzed the data obtained for the CIA (Critically Important Antimicrobials) for human medicine (third and fourth generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, macrolides and polypeptides). Results and discussion: Data collected didn't show any statistically significant correlation neither between antibacterial amount per head and herd consistency, nor between antibacterial amount and milk production per cow. In 72% of the inspected farms, antibacterial therapies were established only on the basis of a clinical diagnosis, while bacteriological exams and antibiograms were sistematically performed in only 18% of farms. For this reason it's possible to conclude that, in most farms, the breeder was not aware of the real health state of his herd. From the results of this research, a frequent failure in compliance to leaflet instructions regarding doses and treatment duration was evident, although it is well known that this could lead to emergence of resistant bacterial strains. Conclusions: The availability of data on the consumption of antibacterial drugs is a key element for surveillance of their correct use and for setting objectives; however, manual collection requires a significant commitment of resources, unsustainable over time. It would be essential in the future to have an informative system about the real antimicrobial consumption, to make the data promptly available to the Veterinary Health Service and to all the stakeholders. Other aspects, however, should be taken into consideration for a comprehensive assessment of the problem, such as proper health management of the herd, compliance to animal welfare and bio-security standards, genetic selection and managerial aspects such as staff training.},

abstract={Staphylococcus aureus is regarded as a leading cause of mastitis in goats. However, few data are available on the presence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in this species. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of S. aureus and MRSA in bulk tank milk samples from dairy goat farms in Northern Italy. Eighty-five out of 197 samples (43.1%) tested positive for S. aureus with counts ranging from 10 to more than 1.5×104 cfu/mL. The MRSA was screened by both direct plating followed by a disk diffusion test to evaluate methicillin resistance and a selective enrichment method. Methicillin-resistance was confirmed by mecA-specific PCR. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus was identified in 4 samples (2.0%) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) showed the presence of livestock-associated MRSA belonging to lineages ST398 (n=3) and ST1 (n=1). In one case we demonstrated that the same MRSA strain was able to persist over time on the farm, being isolated from both bulk tank milk and the udder of 3 goats 1 yr after the first isolation. The high prevalence of S. aureus-positive herds detected in this study and the presence of MRSA strains belonging to livestock-associated genotypes is of concern, and represents a novel finding in the Italian dairy goat production system. The application of stringent measures for the control of S. aureus mastitis at the farm level seems appropriate to reduce the economic losses, and to minimize the risk of foodborne illness and the transmission of MRSA to humans by occupational exposure. © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.},

abstract={Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most important causes of mastitis in dairy cattle. Based on previous research, Staph. aureus genotypes with different pathogenic and contagious properties can cause intramammary infection (IMI) and coexist in the same herd. Our study aimed to compare Staph. aureus strains from herds that differed in IMI prevalence using different molecular approaches such as ribosomal spacer (RS)-PCR, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), spa typing, ribotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and multiplex PCR. For this purpose, 31 dairy herds with Staph. aureus IMI were selected, and 16 of these were chosen for a comparison study: the 8 high-prevalence (HP) herds had Staph. aureus IMI prevalence >28% and the 8 low-prevalence (LP) herds had an IMI prevalence <4%. A total of 650 isolates of Staph. aureus from mammary quarters of all positive cows were genotyped with RS-PCR, a technique based on amplification of a portion of the intergenic spacer 16S-23S rRNA, and a subset of 54 strains was also analyzed by multiplex PCR, ribotyping, PFGE, MLST, and spa typing. The RS-PCR analysis revealed 12 different profiles. Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from 5 out of 8 HP herds showed a profile identical to the genotype B (GTB), described in previous studies as being strongly associated with high within-herd prevalence of Staph. aureus mastitis and the presence of the genes coding for enterotoxins sea, sed, and sej, a long x-region of spa gene, and 3 lukE fragments. Moreover, all strains isolated in the HP herds possessed genes coding for staphylococcal enterotoxins. In LP herds, a limited number of strains of 6 genotypes, different from those isolated in HP herds, were identified and GTB was not found. Within these genotypes, 4 strains were positive for the mecA gene. Preliminary results and comparison with other genotyping methods confirmed that genotyping by RS-PCR is an accurate, rapid, and inexpensive tool for future field studies on Staph. aureus mastitis strains and generates clinically relevant results. © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.},

abstract={Description of the subject. The growth of new antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogens represents a huge problem in poultry rearing. There is evidence that dietary yeast could be effective in the protection against a variety of pathogens that can affect poultry health and cause foodborne diseases in humans. Since still few or contradictory information are available for this topic. Objectives. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of live yeast supplementation in broiler chickens on Salmonella enteritidis and Campylobacter jejuni content in feces, cecum, and skin. Method. Supplemented yeast consisted of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Levucell® SB20, type boulardii I-1079, Lallemand, France) and was administered at a rate of 1 x 106 CFU.g-1 of feed. On day ten of life, birds were orally challenged with S. enteritidis (1 x 105 CFU/bird) and C. jejuni (3 x 105 CFU/bird). Growth performance, and coliforms, yeasts and lactobacilli enumeration were evaluated on day 0, 10, 20 and 38. Ten and eighteen days post infection (PI), 10 animals per replicate were slaughtered and pooled ceca content were analyzed for yeast enumeration and Salmonella and Campylobacter frequency and enumeration. The presence and the enumeration of Salmonella and Campylobacter in neck and breast skin were performed on one subject per replicate. Results. Dietary S. cerevisiae increased yeast and lactobacilli (p = 0.01) count, while Salmonella enumeration and frequency significantly decreased in neck (p = 0.03) and tended to decrease in cecum (p = 0.06), feces (p = 0.06), and breast (p = 0.08). On 10d PI Campylobacter presence was decreased in cecum (p = 0.01), feces (p &lt; 0.01), breast skin (p = 0.04) and neck skin (p &lt; 0.01), while the enumeration was found to be lower in feces (p &lt; 0.01) and neck skin (p = 0.05). At the end of the trial the frequency of this pathogen was decreased in feces (p &lt; 0.01), and breast skin (p = 0.02), while the enumeration was diminished in cecum (p &lt; 0.05) and feces (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions. The present study shows that the inclusion of Levucell® SB20 can significantly control Campylobacter carriage in chickens with some positive effects also on Salmonella presence, thus reducing the contamination of carcasses at slaughtering and preventing human foodborne diseases. © 2015, FAC UNIV SCIENCES AGRONOMIQUES GEMBLOUX.

abstract={Objective. The aim of the survey was to evaluate Toxoplasma gondii seroprevalence in small ruminants and possible risk factors associated with the infection. Materials and methods. Sera from 474 goats and 502 sheep reared on 42 farms in northern Italy were collected and tested for IgG antibodies to T. gondii by IFAT (indirect immunofluorescence antibody test). To identify risk factors, a binary logistic regression analysis of the variables was performed. An audit form about farm management was used. Results. Antibodies to T. gondii were found in 96.6% of goat farms and in 87.5% of sheep farms; 41.7% goats and 59.3% sheep resulted positive. Seroprevalence was significantly higher in sheep than in goats. Seroprevalence values were similar in goats from eastern and western areas, whereas goats from the southern area were at lower risk of infection. Saanen goats presented the lowest seroprevalence (30.7 %), whereas cross-breed exhibited the highest rate (48.7%). Goats from farms housing both sheep and goats had an infection risk 1.39 times higher than goats from farms that did not house sheep. Animals bred on intensive farms showed lower prevalence (22.1%) in comparison with those from extensive (45.6%) or semiintensive farms (60%). Sampling area was one of the strongest predictors of T. gondii infection in sheep flocks. Transhumant flocks showed a higher risk of infection by T. gondii compared with semi-intensive farms (66.8% vs. 38.4%). Conclusions. The highest T. gondii seroprevalence values were registered in transhumant flocks of sheep and in family businesses rearing goats. As these traditional activities represent an important resource for the conservation of the territory and its economy, management practices for a better control of the disease should be improved. © 2015, Institute of Agricultural Medicine.

abstract={The relationships between litter moisture, footpad dermatitis (FPD) and pain in medium-heavy turkey strains was studied by gait analysis in two medium-heavy with and without analgesia (betamethasone or bupivacaine). The relationship between FPD and litter moisture was linear above a breakpoint of 49% litter moisture, and there were no differences between the two breeds in susceptibility to FPD. Gait analysis showed higher impulse, single support time, stride time and stance time in breed A compared to breed B. Significant interactions between breed, litter and analgesic for impulse, single support time and stride time were associated with higher means for breed A given saline injection on wet litter. Data from betamethasone analgesia in Experiments 1 and 3 were combined for analysis. Peak vertical force was higher in saline- compared to betamethasone-treated birds. Compared to the wet (high FPD) litter treatments, birds on dry (low FPD) litter had greater speed and lower double support time and longer stride length. Turkeys kept on wet litter had a longer stride length compared to dry litter when given saline, whereas in betamethasone-treated birds the means were similar. There were no differences between birds with or without bupivacaine analgesia. Peak vertical force was higher in breed A than B and in birds with a low FPD compared to a high FPD score. It was concluded that breeds A and B did not differ in susceptibility to develop FPD when housed on wet litter but may have natural gait differences. Significant changes in gait parameters were associated with wet litter and with analgesic treatments. The results showed that FPD affected the gait of the turkeys and, combined with evidence of behavioural changes when given analgesia, suggest that footpad lesions are painful. © 2015 The Author(s).

abstract={Two experiments were conducted to investigate the differences in susceptibility to foot pad dermatitis (FPD) of two medium-heavy lines of turkeys, and whether FPD is painful, by detailed analysis of behaviour in birds with and without analgesic treatment (betamethasone). Turkeys housed on dry litter in the first experiment generally had more frequent bouts of different behaviours that were of shorter duration than birds on wet litter. T-patterns (behavioural sequences) were more frequent, varied and complex on dry than on wet litter. Betamethasone-injected birds of line B, but not breed A, had shorter resting and longer standing durations on wet litter than saline-injected birds. In the second experiment, turkeys on wet litter given saline stood less and rested more than all other treatment groups, suggesting that they experienced pain that was alleviated in birds receiving betamethasone. Turkeys on dry litter had more frequent, varied and complex patterns of behaviour than turkeys on wet litter and birds kept on intermediate litter wetness. Betamethasone provision increased pattern variety regardless of litter treatment. Turkeys with low FPD scores transferred to wet litter and given saline injections had a longer total duration of resting and shorter duration of standing compared to betamethasone-treated birds. Low FPD birds transferred to wet litter had a similar number of patterns and total pattern occurrence as high FPD birds transferred to dry litter. Betamethasone increased pattern variety and frequency compared to saline injections whereas overall pattern complexity was similar. It was concluded that wet litter affects the behaviour of turkey poults independently of FPD and that betamethasone may also change the behaviour of turkeys. There was some evidence from analgesic treatment and T-pattern analyses that FPD was painful. However, there was no evidence of differences in susceptibility to FPD of the two commercial hybrids. © 2015 The Author(s). Published by Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={A panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for the nucleocapsid (N) protein or the glycoprotein Gc of Schmallenberg virus (SBV), a novel member of the Simbu serogroup (genus Orthobunyavirus, family Bunyaviridae), was produced and used to analyze antigenic differences among members of this serogroup. Reactivity with various SBV-isolates and other Simbu serogroup viruses was assessed by an indirect immunofluorescence test and by immunoblotting. The Gc-specific mAbs detected different SBV isolates as well as two closely related members of the Simbu serogroup. In addition, one mAb showed a highly specific reactivity with the homologous SBV strain only. Based on their differing reactivity with different SBV-strains, these antibodies represent a valuable novel tool to rapidly determine the phenotype of new SBV isolates. In contrast, the N-specific mAbs showed a broad reactivity spectrum and detected not only all the tested SBV-isolates, but also several other viruses of the Simbu serogroup. One out of these mAbs even recognized all of the tested Simbu serogroup viruses in the indirect immunofluorescence assay. In order to further characterize the N-specific antibodies, PepScan analysis was performed and a specific epitope could be identified. In summary, the newly generated mAbs showed differing pan-Simbu virus-, pan-SBV- as well as SBV-isolate-specific reactivity patterns. Thus, they represent valuable tools for the development of novel antigen and antibody detection systems either specific for SBV or, in a broader approach, for the pan-Simbu serogroup diagnostics. © 2015 Wernike et al.; licensee BioMed Central.},

abstract={In 2013, the circulation of West Nile virus (WNV) was detected in the Lombardy region and the following year a surveillance programme was activated with the aim of early identification of the viral distribution in mosquitoes and wild birds. A total of 50 959 Culex spp. mosquitoes grouped in six hundred and forty-seven pools as well as 1400 birds were screened by RT-PCR for the presence of West Nile virus leading to the identification of the viral genome in 32 mosquito pools and 13 wild birds. The surveillance was able to detect the WNV circulation on an average of 42 days (CI 95% 29.98-53.86; Student's t-distribution) before the occurrence of human West Nile disease (WND) cases in the same area. These results demonstrate the presence of WNV in the Lombardy region and confirm entomological and wild birds surveillance as an effective measure for the early identification of WNV circulation in infected areas, thus providing a useful and cost-effective tool for the public health authorities in the application of measures to prevent human infection. © 2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={Background and aim: Alternative therapies based on homeopathy can be effective in improving reproductive performance in intensive pig breeding. In this study, the effect of a homeopathic complex on reproductive performance of sows under intensive farming has been investigated. Material and methods: Over period of three years, 186 sows were recruited from a farm where a large proportion of animals were suffering from prolonged weaning-to-oestrus intervals (WEI) and weaning-to-service intervals (WSI). Sows were allocated to two groups; once per month, one group was given a homeopathic complex (Borax 10 mK plus Lycopodium 10 mK), while the other group was given a hydro-alcoholic solution (placebo). The follow-up period started one week before the expected date of oestrus, continued for two pregnancies and ended after the weaning of the second farrowing. To evaluate reproductive performance, during the follow-up we collected data on quantitative parameters such as the average number of stillbirths, newborns, and repeat services per farrowing. Time-related data such as WEI, WSI, length of the two pregnancies and weaning periods were also collected to measure the length of the follow-up of each sow. Differences in quantitative parameters between the two groups were evaluated using parametric and non-parametric statistics. Time-related data were used to plot Kaplan-Meier curves and in Cox regression models to evaluate whether treated sows had a higher probability of experiencing a shorter follow-up in comparison to untreated sows. Results: We did not found significant differences in the number of newborns, while the number of stillbirths was higher in the treatment group, even if the difference was slightly significant (p-value=0.03). The number of repeat services was lower in the treatment group, and this difference was highly significant (p-value&lt;0.001). Results from the Cox regression models suggest that the end of the follow-up was reached by sows of the treatment group at about twice the rate of sows of the control group (model 2, Hazard Ratiotreatment=2.27; 95%CI: 1.56-3.24). © 2014 The Faculty of Homeopathy.},

abstract={This work was performed to highlight the advantages of total reflection X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (TXRF) for multi-elemental qualitative and quantitative analysis of wine. Indeed the International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV) selected some potentially toxic elements and proposed limit values for their concentration in wines. Direct TXRF analysis of nine wine samples from Emilia Romagna region of Italy was performed in two different laboratories: Italy and Japan. Wine dehydration was also evaluated as sample conservation mean. Traces of Fe, Cu, Zn and Pb are present in all the analysed samples, with concentrations lower than the limits established by the OIV. The target hazard quotients (THQs) were also calculated for seven elements (Cl, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn and Sr) to determine their potential detrimental effects. The results show that TXRF is a fast, simple and accurate analytical technique for trace element analysis of wine. Moreover, dehydration is an effective way to store wine samples for further elemental analysis. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={We retrospectively analyzed a rare Salmonella enterica serovar Manhattan outbreak that occurred in Italy in 2009 to evaluate the potential of new genomic tools based on differential single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis in comparison with the gold standard genotyping method, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. A total of 39 isolates were analyzed from patients (n = 15) and food, feed, animal, and environmental sources (n = 24), resulting in five different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles. Isolates epidemiologically related to the outbreak clustered within the same pulsotype, SXB-BS.0003, without any further differentiation. Thirty-three isolates were considered for genomic analysis based on different sets of SNPs, core, synonymous, nonsynonymous, as well as SNPs in different codon positions, by Bayesian and maximum likelihood algorithms. Trees generated from core and nonsynonymous SNPs, as well as SNPs at the second and first plus second codon positions detailed four distinct groups of isolates within the outbreak pulsotype, discriminating outbreak-related isolates of human and food origins. Conversely, the trees derived from synonymous and third-codon-position SNPs clustered food and human isolates together, indicating that all outbreak-related isolates constituted a single clone, which was in line with the epidemiological evidence. Further experiments are in place to extend this approach within our regional enteropathogen surveillance system. Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={The debate about the origins of boldenone in bovine urine is ongoing for two decades in Europe. Despite the fact that its use as a growth promoter has been banned in the European Union (EU) since 1981, its detection in bovine urine, in the form of α-boldenone conjugate, is considered fully compliant up to 2 ng mL-1. The conjugated form of β-boldenone must be absent. In recent years, the literature about boldenone has focused on the identification of biomarkers that can indicate an illicit treatment. β-boldenone sulfate is a candidate molecule, even if the only studies currently available have taken place in small populations. In this study, a method for the determination of sulfate and glucuronate conjugates of β-boldenone was developed and validated according to the European Commission Decision 2002/657/EC and applied to α-boldenone sulfate and glucuronide, α- and β-boldenone free forms and androstadienedione (ADD), too. The clean-up with immunoaffinity columns enabled the direct determination of the conjugates and free forms and allowed specific and sensitive analyses of urine samples randomly selected to verify this method. The decision limits (CCα) ranged between 0.07 and 0.08 ng mL-1, the detection capabilities (CCβ) between 0.08 and 0.1 ng mL-1. Recovery was higher than 92% for all the analytes. Intra-day repeatability was between 5.8% and 17.2%, and inter-day repeatability was between 6.0% and 21.8% for the studied free and conjugated forms. This method has been developed as a powerful tool with the aim to study the origin of boldenone in a trial on a significant number of animals. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Helicobacter pylori is responsible for gastritis and gastric adenocarcinoma in humans, but the routes of transmission of this bacterium have not been clearly defined. Few studies led to supposing that H. pylori could be transmitted through raw milk, and no one investigated the presence of other Helicobacteraceae in milk. In the current work, the presence of Helicobacteraceae was investigated in the bulk tank milk of dairy cattle herds located in northern Italy both by direct plating onto H. pylori selective medium and by screening PCR for Helicobacteraceae, followed by specific PCRs for H. pylori, Wolinella spp., and "Candidatus Helicobacter bovis." Three out of 163 bulk milk samples tested positive for Helicobacteraceae, but not for the subsequent PCRs. H. pylori was not isolated in any case. However, given similar growth conditions, Arcobacter butzleri, A. cryaerophilus, and A. skirrowii were recovered. In conclusion, the prevalence of Helicobacteraceae in raw milk was negligible (1.8%), and H. pylori was not identified in any of the positive samples, suggesting that, at least in the farming conditions of the investigated area, bovine milk does not represent a potential source of infection. © 2015 Valentina Bianchini et al.},

abstract={Swine dysentery is a mucohaemorrhagic colitis of pigs caused by infection with Brachyspira hyodysenteriae. The disease can be controlled by treatment with antimicrobial agents, with the pleuromutilins tiamulin and valnemulin being widely used. In recent years, the occurrence of B.hyodysenteriae with reduced susceptibility to these drugs has been increasing. The aim of this study was to determine temporal changes in genetic groups and pleuromutilin susceptibility amongst B.hyodysenteriae isolates from Italy. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed on 108 isolates recovered from 87 farms in different regions of Italy from 2003 to 2012, and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for tiamulin and valnemulin were determined. Logistic regression was performed to assess associations between susceptibility to the two antimicrobial agents and genetic group, year and region of isolation. The isolates were allocated to 23 sequence types (STs), with five clonal clusters (Ccs) and seven singletons. More than 50% of isolates were resistant to both pleuromutilins (MIC >2.0 μg/mL for tiamulin and >1.0 μg/mL for valnemulin). All 10 isolates in ST 83 were resistant; these were first isolated in 2011 and came from nine farms, suggesting recent widespread dissemination of a resistant strain. Significant associations were found between the proportion of pleuromutilin susceptible isolates and the genetic group and year of isolation. Although resistant isolates were found in all Ccs, isolates in Ccs 2 and 7 were over five times more likely to be susceptible than those in the other Ccs. A significant trend in the reduction of susceptibility over time also was observed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Avian influenza A viruses have gained increasing attention due to their ability to cross the species barrier and cause severe disease in humans and other mammal species as pigs. H3 and particularly H3N8 viruses, are highly adaptive since they are found in multiple avian and mammal hosts. H3N8 viruses have not been isolated yet from humans; however, a recent report showed that equine influenza A viruses (IAVs) can be isolated from pigs, although an established infection has not been observed thus far in this host. To gain insight into the possibility of H3N8 avian IAVs to cross the species barrier into pigs, in vitro experiments and an experimental infection in pigs with four H3N8 viruses from different origins (equine, canine, avian, and seal) were performed. As a positive control, an H3N2 swine influenza virus A was used. Although equine and canine viruses hardly replicated in the respiratory systems of pigs, avian and seal viruses replicated substantially and caused detectable lesions in inoculated pigs without previous adaptation. Interestingly, antibodies against hemagglutinin could not be detected after infection by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) test with avian and seal viruses. This phenomenon was observed not only in pigs but also in mice immunized with the same virus strains. Our data indicated that H3N8 IAVs from wild aquatic birds have the potential to cross the species barrier and establish successful infections in pigs that might spread unnoticed using the HAI test as diagnostic tool. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.},

abstract={This study investigated the mortality of dairy cows during heat waves. Mortality data (46,610 cases) referred to dairy cows older than 24. mo that died on a farm from all causes from May 1 to September 30 during a 6-yr period (2002-2007). Weather data were obtained from 12 weather stations located in different areas of Italy. Heat waves were defined for each weather station as a period of at least 3 consecutive days, from May 1 to September 30 (2002-2007), when the daily maximum temperature exceeded the 90th percentile of the reference distribution (1971-2000). Summer days were classified as days in heat wave (HW) or not in heat wave (nHW). Days in HW were numbered to evaluate the relationship between mortality and length of the wave. Finally, the first 3 nHW days after the end of a heat wave were also considered to account for potential prolonged effects. The mortality risk was evaluated using a case-crossover design. A conditional logistic regression model was used to calculate odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for mortality recorded in HW compared with that recorded in nHW days pooled and stratified by duration of exposure, age of cows, and month of occurrence. Dairy cows mortality was greater during HW compared with nHW days. Furthermore, compared with nHW days, the risk of mortality continued to be higher during the 3 d after the end of HW. Mortality increased with the length of the HW. Considering deaths stratified by age, cows up to 28. mo were not affected by HW, whereas all the other age categories of older cows (29-60, 61-96, and >96. mo) showed a greater mortality when exposed to HW. The risk of death during HW was higher in early summer months. In particular, the highest risk of mortality was observed during June HW. Present results strongly support the implementation of adaptation strategies which may limit heat stress-related impairment of animal welfare and economic losses in dairy cow farm during HW. © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.},

abstract={The eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus) is an American lagomorph. In 1966, it was introduced to Italy, where it is currently widespread. Its ecological niche is similar to those of native rabbits and hares and increasing overlap in distribution brings these species into ever closer contact. Therefore, cottontails are at risk of infection with the two lagoviruses endemically present in Italy: Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease virus (RHDV) and European Brown Hare Syndrome Virus (EBHSV). To verify the susceptibility of Sylvilagus to these viruses, we analyzed 471 sera and 108 individuals from cottontail populations in 9 provinces of north-central Italy from 1999 to 2012. In total, 15-20% of the cottontails tested seropositive for EBHSV; most titres were low, but some were as high as 1/1280. All the cottontails virologically tested for RHDV and EBHSV were negative with the exception of one individual found dead with hares during a natural EBHS outbreak in December 2009. The cottontail and the hares showed typical EBHS lesions, and the EBHSV strain identified was the same in both species (99.9% identity). To experimentally confirm the diagnosis, we performed two trials in which we infected cottontails with both EBHSV and RHDV. One out of four cottontails infected with EBHSV died of an EBHS-like disease, and the three surviving animals developed high EBHSV antibody titres. In contrast, neither mortality nor seroconversion was detected after infection with RHDV. Taken together, these results suggest that Sylvilagus is susceptible to EBHSV infection, which occasionally evolves to EBHS-like disease; the eastern cottontail could therefore be considered a "spill over" or " dead end " host for EBHSV unless further evidence is found to confirm that it plays an active role in the epidemiology of EBHSV. © 2015 Lavazza et al.; licensee BioMed Central.},

abstract={Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is a postsuppurative sequela caused by Streptococcus pyogenes infections affecting school-age children. We describe here the occurrence of an ARF outbreak that occurred in Bologna province, northeastern Italy, between November 2012 and May 2013. Molecular analysis revealed that ARF-related group A Streptococcus (GAS) strains belonged to the M-18 serotype, including subtypes emm18.29 and emm18.32. All M-18 GAS strains shared the same antigenic profile, including SpeA, SpeB, SpeC, SpeL, SpeM, and SmeZ. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis revealed that M-18 GAS strains grouped separately from other serotypes, suggesting a different S. pyogenes lineage. Single nucleotide polymorphisms and phylogenetic analysis based on whole-genome sequencing showed that emm18.29 and emm18.32 GAS strains clustered in two distinct groups, highlighting genetic variations between these subtypes. Comparative analysis revealed a similar genome architecture between emm18.29 and emm18.32 strains that differed from noninvasive emm18.0 strains. The major sources of differences between M-18 genomes were attributable to the prophage elements. Prophage regions contained several virulence factors that could have contributed to the pathogenic potential of emm18.29 and emm18.32 strains. Notably, phage ωSPBO.1 carried erythrogenic toxin A gene (speA1) in six ARF-related M-18 GAS strains but not in emm18.0 strains. In addition, a phage-encoded hyaluronidase gene (hylP.2) presented different variants among M-18 GAS strains by showing internal deletions located in the α-helical and TSβH regions. In conclusion, our study yielded insights into the genome structure of M-18 GAS strains responsible for the ARF outbreak in Italy, thus expanding our knowledge of this serotype.

abstract={Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) is responsible for foodborne zoonotic infections that, in humans, induce self-limiting gastroenteritis. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the wild-type strain S. Typhimurium (STM14028) is able to exploit inflammation fostering an active infection. Due to the similarity between human and porcine diseases induced by S. Typhimurium, we used piglets as a model for salmonellosis and gastrointestinal research. This study showed that STM14028 is able to efficiently colonize in vitro porcine mono-macrophages and intestinal columnar epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells, and that the colonization significantly increases with LPS pre-treatment. This increase was then reversed by inhibiting the LPS stimulation through LPS antagonist, confirming an active role of LPS stimulation in STM14028-intracellular colonization. Moreover, LPS in vivo treatment increased cytokines blood level and body temperature at 4 h post infection, which is consistent with an acute inflammatory stimulus, capable to influence the colonization of STM14028 in different organs and tissues. The present study proves for the first time that in acute enteric salmonellosis, S. Typhimurium exploits inflammation for its benefit in piglets. © 2015 Chirullo, Pesciaroli, Drumo, Ruggeri, Razzuoli, Pistoia, Petrucci, Martinelli, Cucco, Moscati, Amadori, Magistrali, Alborali and Pasquali.},

abstract={Klebsiella pneumoniae is at the forefront of antimicrobial resistance for Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, as strains resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems are widely reported. The worldwide diffusion of these strains is of great concern due to the high morbidity and mortality often associated with K. pneumoniae infections in nosocomial environments. We sequenced the genomes of 89 K. pneumoniae strains isolated in six Italian hospitals. Strains were selected based on antibiotypes, regardless of multilocus sequence type, to obtain a picture of the epidemiology of K. pneumoniae in Italy. Thirty-one strains were carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae carbapenemase producers, 29 were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, and 29 were susceptible to the aforementioned antibiotics. The genomes were compared to all of the sequences available in the databases, obtaining a data set of 319 genomes spanning the known diversity of K. pneumoniae worldwide. Bioinformatic analyses of this global data set allowed us to construct a whole-species phylogeny, to detect patterns of antibiotic resistance distribution, and to date the differentiation between specific clades of interest. Finally, we detected an ∼1.3-Mb recombination that characterizes all of the isolates of clonal complex 258, the most widespread carbapenem-resistant group of K. pneumoniae. The evolution of this complex was modeled, dating the newly detected and the previously reported recombination events. The present study contributes to the understanding of K. pneumoniae evolution, providing novel insights into its global genomic characteristics and drawing a dated epidemiological scenario for this pathogen in Italy. © 2015 American Society for Microbiology.

abstract={The emergence in humans of the A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus, a complex reassortant virus of swine origin, highlighted the importance of worldwide influenza virus surveillance in swine. To date, large-scale surveillance studies have been reported for southern China and North America, but such data have not yet been described for Europe. We report the first large-scale genomic characterization of 290 swine influenza viruses collected from 14 European countries between 2009 and 2013. A total of 23 distinct genotypes were identified, with the 7 most common comprising 82% of the incidence. Contrasting epidemiological dynamics were observed for two of these genotypes, H1 hu N2 and H3N2, with the former showing multiple long-lived geographically isolated lineages, while the latter had short-lived geographically diffuse lineages. At least 32 human-swine transmission events have resulted in A(H1N1)pdm09 becoming established at a mean frequency of 8% across European countries. Notably, swine in the United Kingdom have largely had a replacement of the endemic Eurasian avian virus-like ("avian-like") genotypes with A(H1N1)pdm09-derived genotypes. The high number of reassortant genotypes observed in European swine, combined with the identification of a genotype similar to the A(H3N2)v genotype in North America, underlines the importance of continued swine surveillance in Europe for the purposes of maintaining public health. This report further reveals that the emergences and drivers of virus evolution in swine differ at the global level. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.},

abstract={Swine influenza causes concern for global veterinary and public health officials. In continuing two previous networks that initiated the surveillance of swine influenza viruses (SIVs) circulating in European pigs between 2001 and 2008, a third European Surveillance Network for Influenza in Pigs (ESNIP3, 2010-2013) aimed to expand widely the knowledge of the epidemiology of European SIVs. ESNIP3 stimulated programs of harmonized SIV surveillance in European countries and supported the coordination of appropriate diagnostic tools and subtyping methods. Thus, an extensive virological monitoring, mainly conducted through passive surveillance programs, resulted in the examination of more than 9 000 herds in 17 countries. Influenza A viruses were detected in 31% of herds examined from which 1887 viruses were preliminary characterized. The dominating subtypes were the three European enzootic SIVs: avian-like swine H1N1 (53.6%), human-like reassortant swine H1N2 (13%) and human-like reassortant swine H3N2 (9.1%), as well as pandemic A/H1N1 2009 (H1N1pdm) virus (10.3%). Viruses from these four lineages co-circulated in several countries but with very different relative levels of incidence. For instance, the H3N2 subtype was not detected at all in some geographic areas whereas it was still prevalent in other parts of Europe. Interestingly, H3N2-free areas were those that exhibited highest frequencies of circulating H1N2 viruses. H1N1pdm viruses were isolated at an increasing incidence in some countries from 2010 to 2013, indicating that this subtype has become established in the European pig population. Finally, 13.9% of the viruses represented reassortants between these four lineages, especially between previous enzootic SIVs and H1N1pdm. These novel viruses were detected at the same time in several countries, with increasing prevalence. Some of them might become established in pig herds, causing implications for zoonotic infections. © 2014 Simon et al.},

abstract={The aim of this work was to study the microbiological and physico-chemical changes throughout three cheesemaking replicates of Italian Formaggelle di capra cheese made from raw goat milk. Therefore, during the process, three samples of milk, curd and cheese at 3, 7, 11, 14, 21 and 30 days of ripening old cheese were taken from three cheesemaking replicates. The average of total mesophilic bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae count in raw milk was 5.27±0.57 and 3.8±1.02 Log cfu/mL, respectively. Lactic acid bacteria was the predominant bacterial group during the process, and they developed in different ways in each of the media used (M17 and MRS agar). Variability of microbial concentrations was observed between three cheesemaking replicates. A correlation between the presence of higher levels of Enterobacteriaceae in milk and the presence of other contaminants bacteria such as Escherichia coli β-glucuronidase-positive and coagulase-positive staphylococci was observed. In cheesemaking replicate n. 2, E. coli level was 5.07±0.03 Log cfu/mL and increased by about 1 log until the last week of ripening, when the level decreased to 5.69±0.2 Log cfu/mL. The milk used for the cheesemaking replicate n. 2 was found to be contaminated also by coagulase-positive staphylococci (3.18±0.06 Log cfu/mL), but the behaviour of this group appeared to be very variable. In this study a first step of process control and microbial groups study was performed and the cheesemaking process was registered in the website www.ars-alimentaria.it, the Italian site supported by the Italian Board of Health. © 2015, Page Press Publications.

abstract={Toscana virus (TOSV), transmitted by phlebotomine sandflies, is recognised as one of the most important causes of viral meningitis in summer in Mediterranean countries. A surveillance plan based on both human and entomological surveys was started in 2010 in the Emilia-Romagna region, Italy. Clinical samples from patients with neurological manifestations were collected during 2010 to 2012. The surveillance protocol was improved during these years, allowing the detection of 65 human infections. Most of these infections were recorded in hilly areas, where sandflies reach the highest density. Entomological sampling around the homes of the patients resulted in a low number of captured sandflies, while later sampling in a hilly area with high number of human cases (n=21) resulted in a larger number of captured sandflies. Using this approach, 25,653 sandflies were sampled, of which there were 21,157 females, which were sorted into 287 pools. TOSV RNA was detected by real-time PCR in 33 of the pools. The results highlighted the role of Phlebotomus perfiliewi as the main vector of TOSV and a potential link between vector density and virus circulation. This integrated system shows that an interdisciplinary approach improves the sensitiveness and effectiveness of health surveillance. © 2014, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

abstract={Biobanking is an essential tool for ensuring easy availability of high-quality biomaterial collections that combine essential samples and epidemiological, clinical, and research data for the scientific community. Specimen collection is an integral part of clinical research. Indeed, every year throughout the world, millions of biological samples are stored for diagnostics and research, but in many fields the lack of biological material and models is a major hindrance for ongoing research. A biobank facility provides suitable samples for large-scale screening studies and database repositories. Software dedicated to biological banks simplify sample registration and identification, the cataloging of sample properties (type of sample/specimen, associated diseases and/or therapeutic protocols, environmental information, etc.), sample tracking, quality assurance, and specimen availability characterized by well-defined features. Biobank facilities must adopt good laboratory practices (GLPs) and a stringent quality control system and also comply with ethical issues, when required. The creation of a veterinary network can be useful under different aspects: the first one is related to the importance of animal sciences itself to improve research and strategies in the different branches of the veterinary area, and the second aspect is related to the possibility of data management harmonization to improve scientific cooperation. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.

abstract={Antigen recognition by immunoglobulins depends upon initial rearrangements of heavy chain V, D, and J genes. In leporids, a unique system exists for the VH genes usage that exhibit highly divergent lineages: the VHa allotypes, the Lepus sL lineage and the VHn genes. For the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), four VHa lineages have been described, the a1, a2, a3 and a4. For hares (Lepus sp.), one VHa lineage was described, the a2L, as well as a more ancient sL lineage. Both genera use the VHn genes in a low frequency of their VDJ rearrangements. To address the hypothesis that the VH specificities could be associated with different environments, we sequenced VDJ genes from a third leporid genus, Sylvilagus. We found a fifth and equally divergent VHa lineage, the a5, and an ancient lineage, the sS, related to the hares’ sL, but failed to obtain VHn genes. These results show that the studied leporids employ different VH lineages in the generation of the antibody repertoire, suggesting that the leporid VH genes are subject to strong selective pressure likely imposed by specific pathogens. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Predicting West Nile virus (WNV) circulation and the risk of WNV epidemics is difficult due to complex interactions of multiple factors involved. Surveillance systems that timely detect virus activity in targeted areas, and allow evidence-based risk assessments may therefore be necessary. Since 2009, a system integrating environmental (mosquitoes and birds) and human surveillance has been implemented and progressively improved in the Emilia-Romagna region, Italy. The objective is to increase knowledge of WNV circulation and to reduce the probability of virus transmission via blood, tissue and organ donation. As of 2013, the system has shown highly satisfactory results in terms of early detection capacity (the environmental surveillance component allowed detection of WNV circulation 3–4 weeks before human cases of West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WNND) occurred), sensitivity (capacity to detect virus circulation even at the enzootic level) and area specificity (capacity to indicate the spatial distribution of the risk for WNND). Strong correlations were observed between the vector index values and the number of human WNND cases registered at the province level. Taking into consideration two scenarios of surveillance, the first with environmental surveillance and the second without, the total costs for the period from 2009 to 2013 were reduced when environmental surveillance was considered (EUR 2.093 million for the first scenario vs EUR 2.560 million for the second). Environmental surveillance helped to reduce costs by enabling a more targeted blood unit testing strategy. The inclusion of environmental surveillance also increased the efficiency of detecting infected blood units and further allowed evidence-based adoption of preventative public health measures. © 2014 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

abstract={The study was based on data collected during 5 yr (2003–2007) and was aimed at assessing the effects of the month, slaughter house of destination (differing for stocking density, openings, brightness, and cooling device types), length of the journey, and temperature– humidity index (THI) on mortality of heavy slaughter pigs (approximately 160 kg live weight) during transport and lairage. Data were obtained from 24,098 journeys and 3,676,153 pigs transported from 1,618 farms to 3 slaughter houses. Individual shipments were the unit of observation. The terms dead on arrival (DOA) and dead in pen (DIP) refer to pigs that died during transport and in lairage at the abattoir before slaughtering, respectively. These 2 variables were assessed as the dependent counts in separate univariate Poisson regressions. The independent variables assessed univariately in each set of regressions were month of shipment, slaughter house of destination, time traveled, and each combination of the month with the time traveled. Two separate piecewise regressions were done. One used DOA counts within THI levels over pigs transported as a dependent ratio and the second used DIP counts within THI levels over pigs from a transport kept in lairage as a dependent ratio. The THI was the sole independent variable in each case. The month with the greatest frequency of deaths was July with a risk ratio of 1.22 (confidence interval: 1.06–1.36; P &lt; 0.05) and 1.27 (confidence interval: 1.06–1.51; P &lt; 0.05) for DOA and DIP, respectively. The lower mortality risk ratios for DOA and DIP were recorded for January and March (P &lt; 0.05). The aggregated data of the summer (June, July, and August) versus non-summer (January, March, September, and November) months showed a greater risk of pigs dying during the hot season when considering both transport and lairage (P &lt; 0.05). The mortality risk ratio of DIP was lower at the slaughter house with the lowest stocking density (0.64 m 2 /100 kg live weight), large open windows on the roof and sidewalls, low brightness (40 lx) lights, and high-pressure sprinklers as cooling devices. The mortality risk ratio of DOA increased significantly for journeys longer than 2 h, whereas no relationship was found between length of transport and DIP. The piecewise analysis pointed out that 78.5 and 73.6 THI were the thresholds above which the mortality rate increased significantly for DOA and DIP, respectively. These results may help the pig industry to improve the welfare of heavy slaughter pigs during transport and lairage. © 2014 American Society of Animal Science. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Obesity is a common and complex health problem, which impacts crucial organs; it is also considered an independent risk factor for chronic kidney disease. Few studies have analyzed the consequence of obesity in the renal proximal convoluted tubules, which are the major tubules involved in reabsorptive processes. For optimal performance of the kidney, energy is primarily provided by mitochondria. Melatonin, an indoleamine and antioxidant, has been identified in mitochondria, and there is considerable evidence regarding its essential role in the prevention of oxidative mitochondrial damage. In this study we evaluated the mechanism(s) of mitochondrial alterations in an animal model of obesity (ob/ob mice) and describe the beneficial effects of melatonin treatment on mitochondrial morphology and dynamics as influenced by mitofusin-2 and the intrinsic apoptotic cascade. Melatonin dissolved in 1% ethanol was added to the drinking water from postnatal week 5-13; the calculated dose of melatonin intake was 100 mg/kg body weight/day. Compared to control mice, obesity-related morphological alterations were apparent in the proximal tubules which contained round mitochondria with irregular, short cristae and cells with elevated apoptotic index. Melatonin supplementation in obese mice changed mitochondria shape and cristae organization of proximal tubules, enhanced mitofusin-2 expression, which in turn modulated the progression of the mitochondria-driven intrinsic apoptotic pathway. These changes possibly aid in reducing renal failure. The melatonin-mediated changes indicate its potential protective use against renal morphological damage and dysfunction associated with obesity and metabolic disease. © 2014 Stacchiotti et al.},

abstract={Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an elusive model of host/virus relationship in which disease is determined by virus pathogenicity, pig breed susceptibility and phenotype, microbial infectious pressure, and environmental conditions. The disease can be controlled by farm management programs, which can be supported by vaccination or conditioning of animals to circulating PRRS virus (PRRSV) strains. Yet, PRRS still represents a cause of heavy losses for the pig industry worldwide. Immunological control strategies are often compounded by poor and late development of adaptive immunity in both vaccinated and infected animals. Also, there is evidence that results of field trials can be worse than those of experimental studies in isolation facilities. Neutralizing antibody (NA) was shown to prevent PRRSV infection. Instead, the role of NA and adaptive immunity on the whole in virus clearance after established PRRSV infections is still contentious. Pigs eventually eliminate PRRSV infection, which may be correlated with an "educated," innate immune response, which may also develop following vaccination. In addition to vaccination, an immunomodulation strategy for PRRS can be reasonably advocated in pig "problem" farms, where a substantial control of disease prevalence and disease-related losses is badly needed. This is not at odds with vaccination, which should be preferably restricted to PRRSV-free animals bound for PRRSV-infected farm units. Oral, low-dose, interferon-a treatments proved effective on farm for the control of respiratory and reproductive disease outbreaks, whereas the results were less clear in isolation facilities. Having in mind the crucial interaction between PRRSV and bacterial lipopolysaccharides for occurrence of respiratory disease, the strong control actions of low-dose type I interferons on the inflammatory response observed in vitro and in vivo probably underlie the rapid clinical responses observed in field trials. © 2014 Amadori and Razzuoli.},

abstract={Chlamydia (C.) pecorum, an obligate intracellular bacterium, may cause severe diseases in ruminants, swine and koalas, although asymptomatic infections are the norm. Recently, we identified genetic polymorphisms in the ompA, incA and ORF663 genes that potentially differentiate between high-virulence C. pecorum isolates from diseased animals and lowvirulence isolates from asymptomatic animals. Here, we expand these findings by including additional ruminant, swine, and koala strains. Coding tandem repeats (CTRs) at the incA locus encoded a variable number of repeats of APA or AGA amino acid motifs. Addition of any non-APA/AGA repeat motif, such as APEVPA, APAVPA, APE, or APAPE, associated with low virulence (P&lt;10-4), as did a high number of amino acids in all incA CTRs (P = 0.0028). In ORF663, high numbers of 15-mer CTRs correlated with low virulence (P = 0.0001). Correction for ompA phylogram position in ORF663 and incA abolished the correlation between genetic changes and virulence, demonstrating co-evolution of ompA, incA, and ORF663 towards low virulence. Pairwise divergence of ompA, incA, and ORF663 among isolates from healthy animals was significantly higher than among strains isolated from diseased animals (P≤10-5), confirming the longer evolutionary path traversed by low-virulence strains. All three markers combined identified 43 unique strains and 4 pairs of identical strains among all 57 isolates tested, demonstrating the suitability of these markers for epidemiological investigations. © 2014 Mohamad et al.},

Thirteen laboratories from seven European Countries participated to this trial, and pork meat was selected as food model. The limit of detection observed was down to 10. CFU per 25. g of sample, showing excellent concordance and accordance values between samples and laboratories (100%). In addition, excellent values were obtained for relative accuracy, specificity and sensitivity (100%) when the results obtained for the Real-Time PCR-based methods were compared to those of the ISO 6579:2002 standard method. The results of this international trial demonstrate that the evaluated Real-Time PCR-based method represents an excellent alternative to the ISO standard. In fact, it shows an equal and solid performance as well as it reduces dramatically the extent of the analytical process, and can be easily implemented routinely by the Competent Authorities and Food Industry laboratories. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The classical microbiological method for detection of Listeria monocytogenes requires around 7. days for final confirmation, and due to perishable nature of RTE food products, there is a clear need for an alternative methodology for detection of this pathogen. This study presents an international (at European level) ISO 16140-based validation trial of a non-proprietary real-time PCR-based methodology that can generate final results in the following day of the analysis. This methodology is based on an ISO compatible enrichment coupled to a bacterial DNA extraction and a consolidated real-time PCR assay. Twelve laboratories from six European countries participated in this trial, and soft cheese was selected as food model since it can represent a difficult matrix for the bacterial DNA extraction and real-time PCR amplification. The limit of detection observed was down to 10. CFU per 25 of sample, showing excellent concordance and accordance values between samples and laboratories (>. 75%). In addition, excellent values were obtained for relative accuracy, specificity and sensitivity (82.75%, 96.70% and 97.62%, respectively) when the results obtained for the real-time PCR-based methods were compared to those of the ISO 11290-1 standard method. An interesting observation was that the L. monocytogenes detection by the real-time PCR method was less affected in the presence of Listeria innocua in the contaminated samples, proving therefore to be more reliable than the reference method. The results of this international trial demonstrate that the evaluated real-time PCR-based method represents an excellent alterative to the ISO standard since it shows a higher performance as well as reduce the extent of the analytical process, and can be easily implemented routinely by the competent authorities and food industry laboratories. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Oral, low-dose IFN-α treatments proved effective in several models of viral infections and immunopathological conditions. Also, they do not give rise to the serious side effects observed after parenteral inoculation of high doses (105U/kg b.w. and higher). There is convincing evidence that such treatments work through an early, effective interaction with oral lymphoid tissues before the IFN-α molecules are rapidly destroyed by gut enzymes. Yet, the paucity of detailed information about these crucial interactions and the lack of recognized in vitro models hamper the development of proper administration protocols. On the basis of a previous study, we developed an in vitro model of interaction between different types of human and porcine IFNs-α at low/moderate concentrations and pig tonsil cells. The IFNs-α under study showed different properties with respect to three fundamental control actions: (1) IgA release in culture, (2) release of natural antimicrobial compounds, and (3) homeostatic regulation of the inflammatory response. This was checked in pig intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2 cell line) treated with supernatants of control and IFN α-treated tonsil cell cultures, respectively, in terms of inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses. Some IFNs-α caused a significant inhibition of IL-8 (protein release and gene expression) and beta-defensin 1 (gene expression) probably through second messengers released by IFN α-treated tonsil cells. Interestingly, a human lymphoblastoid IFN-α under study caused the decrease of polyclonal IgA release by pig tonsil cells and significantly stimulated the in vitro recall antibody response of swine PBMC to Foot-and-Mouth Disease virus. The modulation of IgA and antibacterial compounds was accompanied by an anti-inflammatory control action at the same, low to moderate IFN-α concentrations (1-100U/ml). This highlights the very foundation of the homeostatic control actions performed by Type I IFNs: to promote an effective host response to infectious and non-infectious stressors and to turn off noxious inflammatory responses associated with tissue damage and waste of metabolic energy. The described tonsil cell model in vitro can be conducive to a further development of oral cytokine treatments in humans and animals in the "one health" conceptual framework. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Campylobacter jejuni is the most common food-borne zoonotic pathogen causing human gastroenteritis worldwide and has assumed more importance in Italy following the increased consumption of raw milk. Our objectives were to get an overview of genotypes and antibiotic resistances in C. jejuni isolated from milk, cattle feces, and pigeons in dairy herds of Northern Italy. flaB-typing was applied to 78 C. jejuni isolates, previously characterized by Multi-Locus Sequence Typing, and genotypic resistances towards macrolides and quinolones based on point mutations in the 23S rRNA and gyrA genes, respectively, were determined. flaB-typing revealed 22 different types with one of them being novel and was useful to further differentiate strains with an identical Sequence Type (ST) and to identify a pigeon-specific clone. Macrolide resistance was not found, while quinolone resistance was detected in 23.3% of isolates. A relationship between specific genotypes and antibiotic resistance was observed, but was only significant for the Clonal Complex 206. Our data confirm that pigeons do not play a role in the spread of C. jejuni among cattle and they are not responsible for milk contamination. A relevant number of bulk milk samples were contaminated by C. jejuni resistant to quinolones, representing a possible source of human resistant strains. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={A major cause of salmonellosis in humans is the contamination of pork products. Infection in pigs can be controlled using bio-security programs, but they are not sufficient in countries where a high level of infection is recorded. In this context, the use of vaccines can represent a valid supplementary method of control. Recently, we have demonstrated that an attenuated strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella Typhimurium δznuABC) is protective against systemic and enteric salmonellosis in mouse and pig infection models, candidating this strain as an oral attenuated vaccine. In this study, we compared the efficacy of this attenuated Salmonella Typhimurium strain when administered orally or parenterally. Furthermore, in order to reproduce a pseudo-natural infection model, vaccinated pigs were allocated in the same pen with animals shedding virulent Salmonella Typhimurium. Animals were monitored weekly after vaccination and contact with infected piglets. Diarrhea and ataxia were recorded and Salmonella shedding was tested individually through bacterial culture. After four weeks of cohousing, piglets were euthanized, after which lymph nodes reactivity and gross lesions of the gut sections were scored at necropsy. Organs were submitted to microbiological and histological analyses. The data reported herein show that parenterally vaccinated animals do not shed the attenuated strain, and at the same time the absence of symptoms and decrease in virulent strain shedding in feces from day 6 after challenge demonstrated protection against infection induced by virulent Salmonella Typhimurium. In conclusion, our findings suggest that this is an alternative route of Salmonella Typhimurium δznuABC administration, without ignoring the advantages associated with oral vaccination. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of plant polyphenols (PP) on antioxidant activity in weaned piglets. First, a uniform design, one optimising an experimental technique that can rationally arrange the concentrations of mixture components, was used to obtain the best PP mixture of apple, grape seed, green tea and olive leaf polyphenols based on in vitro antioxidant capacity and inhibitory action on bacterial growth. Second, the optimised PP mixture was tested in vivo with an efficacy trial on piglets. The optimal effects of the mix were observed in vitro when apple, grape seed, green tea, olive leaf polyphenols and a carrier (silicon dioxide) accounted for 16.5, 27.5, 30, 2.5 and 23.5%, respectively, of the mixture. Forty-eight weaned piglets were randomly allocated to two dietary treatments (6 replicates of 4 piglets each per treatment) and fed a control diet (CTR) or CTR supplemented with 0.1% of the optimised PP mixture. Dietary PP did not affect growth performance compared to the CTR group. Plasma total protein, urea nitrogen and lysozyme content were not affected by dietary treatment. No differences of E. coli or Clostridia counts in the faeces and caecum content between the CTR and PP groups were observed. A reduced malondialdehyde concentration in the PP group was observed on day 21 compared to the CTR group (P=0.02). In conclusion, the prepared PP mixture has the potential to improve plasma antioxidant activity. © H.J. Zhang et al., 2014. Licensee PAGEPress, Italy.},

abstract={Background: West Nile Virus (WNV) is an emerging global health threat. Transmission risk is strongly related to the abundance of mosquito vectors, typically Culex pipiens in Europe. Early-warning predictors of mosquito population dynamics would therefore help guide entomological surveillance and thereby facilitate early warnings of transmission risk. Methods. We analysed an 11-year time series (2001 to 2011) of Cx. pipiens mosquito captures from the Piedmont region of north-western Italy to determine the principal drivers of mosquito population dynamics. Linear mixed models were implemented to examine the relationship between Cx. pipiens population dynamics and environmental predictors including temperature, precipitation, Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and the proximity of mosquito traps to urban areas and rice fields. Results: Warm temperatures early in the year were associated with an earlier start to the mosquito season and increased season length, and later in the year, with decreased abundance. Early precipitation delayed the start and shortened the length of the mosquito season, but increased total abundance. Conversely, precipitation later in the year was associated with a longer season. Finally, higher NDWI early in the year was associated with an earlier start to the season and increased season length, but was not associated with abundance. Proximity to rice fields predicted higher total abundance when included in some models, but was not a significant predictor of phenology. Proximity to urban areas was not a significant predictor in any of our models. Predicted variations in start of the season and season length ranged from one to three weeks, across the measured range of variables. Predicted mosquito abundance was highly variable, with numbers in excess of 1000 per trap per year when late season temperatures were low (average 21°C) to only 150 when late season temperatures were high (average 30°C). Conclusions: Climate data collected early in the year, in conjunction with local land use, can be used to provide early warning of both the timing and magnitude of mosquito outbreaks. This potentially allows targeted mosquito control measures to be implemented, with implications for prevention and control of West Nile Virus and other mosquito borne diseases. © 2014 Rosà et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Tonsils from 150 pigs slaughtered at 270days or older were tested for Yersinia enterocolitica with different cultural methods. Samples were collected in three different abattoirs of Northern Italy between April and November 2012 and were analysed by direct plating on cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin (CIN) agar and by enrichment procedures following the ISO 10273:2003 reference method. Twenty-three (15.3%) samples were positive: 22 tonsils (14.7%) were positive for human pathogenic Y. enterocolitica bio-serotype 4/O:3 and one tonsil (0.7%) for Y. enterocolitica bio-serotype 1A/7,8-8,8,19. Seventeen samples out of 23 (73.9%) were positive by direct plating method. Among the enrichment procedures, the best recovery rate (8 positives out of 23; 34.8%) was obtained by the two-day enrichment in peptone-sorbitol-bile (PSB) broth followed by plating on CIN agar plates. The two-day enrichment in PSB followed by potassium hydroxide (KOH) treatment before plating onto CIN agar gave 7 positives out of 23 (30.4%), decreasing to 3 positives (13.0%) without KOH treatment. The worst results were obtained by prolonged (five days) enrichment in PSB, with or without KOH treatment, followed by plating on CIN agar: 4.3% (1 out of 23) and 0.0% recovery rates, respectively. The mean concentration was 1.9×104CFU/g, with a minimum of 1.0×102CFU/g and a maximum of 5.8×104CFU/g, thus demonstrating that tonsils may play an important role in contamination of pluck sets, carcasses, and slaughterhouse environment.Prevalence of virulence genes among the Y. enterocolitica 4/O:3 isolates was as follows: 12/22 (54.5%) for yadA, 21/22 (95.5%) for ail, 21/22 (95.5%) for inv and 22/22 (100%) for ystA.All Y. enterocolitica 4/O:3 isolates were sensitive to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime and resistant to ampicillin and cephalotin. High proportions of 4/O:3 isolates (95%) were sensitive to cefotaxime, gentamicin, kanamicin and nalidixic acid. High levels of resistance were observed to sulphonamide compounds (91%), streptomycin (64%) and chloramphenicol (55%). Multi-resistant isolates were very common; resistance to three or more antimicrobials was observed in 91% (20/22) of 4/O:3 isolates. High level of resistance to chloramphenicol was possibly due to coresistance to tiamphenicol, which was detected in 100% of the isolates.XbaI-PFGE detected four clusters among the 22 Y. enterocolitica 4/O:3 isolates. The most represented accounted for 77% (17/22) of the isolates, the second most common was found in 14% (3/22) of the isolates and the two other profiles were observed in single isolates. The comparison with a selection of human isolates supported the role of the pig as reservoir of 4/O:3 Y. enterocolitica. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Trichinella spp. infections in wild boar (Sus scrofa), one of the main sources of human trichinellosis, continue to represent a public health problem. The detection of Trichinella spp. larvae in muscles of wild boar by digestion can prevent the occurrence of clinical trichinellosis in humans. However, the analytical sensitivity of digestion in the detection process is dependent on the quantity of tested muscle. Consequently, large quantities of muscle have to be digested to warrant surveillance programs, or more sensitive tests need to be employed. The use of indirect detection methods, such as the ELISA to detect Trichinella spp. infections in wild boar has limitations due to its low specificity. The aim of the study was to implement serological detection of anti-Trichinella spp. antibodies in meat juices from hunted wild boar for the surveillance of Trichinella spp. infections. Methods. Two tests were used, ELISA for the initial screening test, and a specific and sensitive Western blot (Wb) as a confirmatory test. The circulation of anti-Trichinella IgG was determined in hunted wild boar muscle juice samples in 9 provinces of 5 Italian regions. Results: From 1,462 muscle fluid samples, 315 (21.5%, 95% C.I. 19.51-23.73) were tested positive by ELISA. The 315 ELISA-positive muscle fluid samples were further tested by Wb and 32 (10.1%, 95% C.I. 7.29-13.99) of these were positive with a final seroprevalence of 2.2% (95% C.I 1.55-3.07; 32/1,462). Trichinella britovi larvae were detected by artificial digestion in muscle tissues of one (0.07%, 95%C.I. 0.01-0.39) out of the 1,462 hunted wild boars. No Trichinella spp. larvae were detected in Wb-negative wild boar. From 2006 to 2012, a prevalence of 0.017% was detected by muscle digestion in wild boar hunted in the whole Italian territory. Conclusions: The combined use of both serological methods had a sensitivity 31.4 times higher than that of the digestion (32/1,462 versus 1/1,462), suggesting their potential use for the surveillance of the Trichinella spp. infection in wild boar populations. © 2014 Gómez-Morales et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={The objective of this study was to analyse over time the evolution of E. coli O157:H7 faecal shedding in a dairy herd producing raw milk for direct human consumption. The study was performed between October 2012 and September 2013 in an average size Italian dairy farm where animals are housed inside the barn all over the year. The farm housed about 140 animals during the study – 70 cows and 70 calves and heifers. Twenty-six animals were randomly selected from both the cows and young animals group, and faecal sampling was performed rectally six times two months apart in each animal. Eleven animals were culled during the study and a total of 285 faecal samples were collected. At each faecal sampling, three trough water samples and two trough feed samples were also collected for a total of 36 water samples and 24 feed samples. Samples were analysed by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and culture. Overall, 16 (5.6%) faecal samples were positive for E. coli O157 by RT-PCR. Cultural examination found 9 (3.1%) samples positive for E. coli O157; all the isolates were positive for stx1, stx 2 and eae genes. One (4.1%) feed sample was positive for E. coli O157 by RT-PCR; none of the water samples was positive for E. coli O157. The model highlighted a general significant reduction of the number of positive samples observed during the study from the first to the sixth sampling (P=0.000) and a positive relation between the presence of positive samples and average environmental temperature (P=0.003). The results of the study showed that in an Italian dairy farm housing animals all year, faecal shedding of E. coli O157 followed the same temporal trend reported for other types of farming. The enhanced faecal shedding during warmer months may have a significant impact on environmental contamination and the safety of raw milk and its byproducts. © G. Merialdi et al., 2014.},

abstract={West Nile virus (WNV) is a zoonotic arboviral pathogen transmitted by mosquitoes in a cycle involving wild birds as reservoir hosts. The virus has recently emerged in North America and re-emerged in Europe. North American WNV outbreaks are often accompanied by high mortality in wild birds, a feature that is uncommon in Europe. The reason for this difference is unknown, but the intrinsic virulence of the viruses circulating in each continent and/or the susceptibility to the disease of Palearctic as opposed to Nearctic wild bird species could play a role. To assess this question, experimental inoculations with four lineage 1 WNV strains, three from southern Europe (Italy/2008, Italy/2009 and Spain/2007) and one from North America (NY99) were performed on house sparrows (Passer domesticus), a wild passerine common in both continents. Non-significant differences which ranged from 0% to 25% were observed in mortality for the different WNV strains. Viremias lasted from 1 to 5-6 days post-inoculation (dpi) in all cases; individuals inoculated with NY99 had significantly higher titres than those inoculated with any of the Euro-Mediterranean strains. Remarkably, host competence was found to be higher for NY99 than for the other strains. Consequently, albeit being pathogenic for house sparrows, some Euro-Mediterranean strains had reduced capacity for replication in -and transmission from- this host, as compared to the NY99 strain. If applicable also to other wild bird host species, this relatively reduced transmission capacity of the Euro-Mediterranean strains could explain the lower incidence of this disease in wild birds in the Euro-Mediterranean area. © 2014 Del Amo et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Thermotolerant Campylobacter spp. are frequently the cause of human gastroenteritis and have assumed more importance in Italy following the increased consumption of raw milk. Our objectives were to determine the prevalence and genotypes of Campylobacter spp. in dairy herds and to investigate the possible sources of bulk milk contamination. Bulk milk from dairy herds (n = 282) was cultured for Campylobacter spp. and Enterobacteriaceae. At three Campylobacter jejuni-positive farms, bovine feces, pigeon intestines, milk, and water points were also investigated. Isolates were identified by PCR and genotyped using multilocus sequence typing (MLST). C. jejuni was detected in 34 (12%) bulk milk samples. The strains belonged to 14 sequence types, and the most common clonal complexes were CC-21, CC-48, and CC-403. No association was demonstrated between the presence of C. jejuni and high levels of Enterobacteriaceae in bulk milk. At the three farms examined, C. jejuni was isolated from bovine feces (25/82 [30.5%]), pigeon intestines (13/60 [21.7%]), bulk milk (10/24 [41.7%]), and water points (4/16 [25%]). MLST revealed lineages that were common between milk and bovine feces but distinct between cattle and pigeons. In one herd, C. jejuni with the same genotype was isolated repeatedly from bulk milk and a cow with an udder infection. Our results showed a high prevalence of C. jejuni in bulk milk and suggested that udder excretion, in addition to fecal matter, may be a route of bulk milk contamination. MLST analysis indicated that pigeons are probably not relevant for the transmission of C. jejuni to cattle and for milk contamination. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.},

abstract={Nonstructural protein 3A of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a partially conserved protein of 153 amino acids in most FMDVs examined to date. The role of 3A in virus growth and virulence within the natural host is not well understood. Using a yeast two-hybrid approach, we identified cellular protein DCTN3 as a specific host binding partner for 3A. DCTN3 is a subunit of the dynactin complex, a cofactor for dynein, a motor protein. The dynactin-dynein duplex has been implicated in several subcellular functions involving intracellular organelle transport. The 3A-DCTN3 interaction identified by the yeast two-hybrid approach was further confirmed in mammalian cells. Overexpression of DCTN3 or proteins known to disrupt dynein, p150/Glued and 50/dynamitin, resulted in decreased FMDV replication in infected cells. We mapped the critical amino acid residues in the 3A protein that mediate the protein interaction with DCTN3 by mutational analysis and, based on that information, we developed a mutant harboring the same mutations in O1 Campos FMDV (O1C3A-PLDGv). Although O1C3A-PLDGv FMDV and its parental virus (O1Cv) grew equally well in LFBK-αvβ6, O1C3APLDGv virus exhibited a decreased ability to replicate in primary bovine cell cultures. Importantly, O1C3A-PLDGv virus exhibited a delayed disease in cattle compared to the virulent parental O1Campus (O1Cv). Virus isolated from lesions of animals inoculated with O1C3A-PLDGv virus contained amino acid substitutions in the area of 3A mediating binding to DCTN3. Importantly, 3A protein harboring similar amino acid substitutions regained interaction with DCTN3, supporting the hypothesis that DCTN3 interaction likely contributes to virulence in cattle. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.},

abstract={A survey was carried out to determine the prevalence of Encephalitozoon spp. in lagomorphs of Sardinia (Italy) at nine industrial rabbit farms (Oryctogalus cuniculus) and in two breedings of hares (Lepus capensis mediterraneus). A total of 378 slaughtered rabbits (meat rabbits and breeders) and 45 living hares were examined. The survey was carried out including three different approaches: serological, pathological, and biomolecular. Sera obtained after centrifugation were frozen at -18°C until examination by carbon immunoassay (Medicago, Uppsala, Sweden). Six out of the nine rabbit farms were found to be serologically positive for E. cuniculi (66.7%), while the number of seropositive rabbits was 68 of 378 (18.5%). All hare sera tested negative. In all slaughtered rabbits, macroscopic renal lesions, presumably attributable to infection with E. cuniculi, were detected. Gross lesions were found in 62 out of the 378 individuals examined (16.4%). DNA was extracted from 22 samples that were positive for microsporidia and subjected to sequencing and genotyping. All isolates investigated showed 100% homology to E. cuniculi. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. All rights are reserved.},

From 2007 to 2012, 20,931 dogs, 89.8% of which were identified by microchip and housed in 73 kennels, were examined using an indirect fluorescent antibody test. In all, 528 (2.8%) dogs tested positive, and 43.0% of these were asymptomatic. The authors used monitoring results, in particular serological tests performed on dogs at admittance to the kennel and annual controls of sentinel dogs, to estimate CanL risk in the whole region and to evaluate the efficacy of the preventive measures adopted. CanL seroprevalence in dogs tested at the admittance in kennels increased significantly from 2010 (1.0%; 29/2858) to 2012 (2.4%; 69/2841). In contrast, the number of seroconversions in sentinel dogs was stable in 2010 (1.2%; 11/896) and 2011 (1.6%; 13/825) and decreased in 2012 (0.9%; 8/850), suggesting the efficacy of the preventive measures applied. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract={Staphylococcus aureus is the most important etiologic agent of contagious mastitis able to produce a number of virulence factors that may play important roles in the development of this disease. Recently, a rapid technique based on the amplification of the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic space (RS-PCR) was developed for S. aureus genotyping The aim of the present study was to characterize certain strains collected from North Italy herds to verify the presence of a specific genotype associated in Switzerland with severe clinical expression in the herd. In the 30 strains analyzed, our preliminary results showed the presence of four isolates similar to Switzerland genotype B and the possibility to link an electrophoretic profile to a specific pattern of virulence. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

abstract={The rise of resistant pathogens and chronic infections tolerant to antibiotics presents an unmet need for novel antimicrobial compounds. Identifying broad-spectrum leads is challenging due to the effective penetration barrier of Gram-negative bacteria, formed by an outer membrane restricting amphipathic compounds, and multidrug resistance (MDR) pumps. In chronic infections, pathogens are shielded from the immune system by biofilms or host cells, and dormant persisters tolerant to antibiotics are responsible for recalcitrance to chemotherapy with conventional antibiotics. We reasoned that the dual need for broad-spectrum and sterilizing compounds could be met by developing prodrugs that are activated by bacterium-specific enzymes and that these generally reactive compounds could kill persisters and accumulate over time due to irreversible binding to targets. We report the development of a screen for prodrugs, based on identifying compounds that nonspecifically inhibit reduction of the viability dye alamarBlue, and then eliminate generally toxic compounds by testing for cytotoxicity. A large pilot of 55,000 compounds against Escherichia coli produced 20 hits, 3 of which were further examined. One compound, ADC111, is an analog of a known nitrofuran prodrug nitrofurantoin, and its activity depends on the presence of activating enzymes nitroreductases. ADC112 is an analog of another known antimicrobial tilbroquinol with unknown mechanism of action, and ADC113 does not belong to an approved class. All three compounds had a good spectrum and showed good to excellent activity against persister cells in biofilm and stationary cultures. These results suggest that screening for overlooked prodrugs may present a viable platform for antimicrobial discovery. Copyright © 2014, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={The family Chlamydiaceae with the recombined single genus Chlamydia currently comprises nine species, all of which are obligate intracellular organisms distinguished by a unique biphasic developmental cycle. Anecdotal evidence from epidemiological surveys in flocks of poultry, pigeons and psittacine birds have indicated the presence of non-classified chlamydial strains, some of which may act as pathogens. In the present study, phylogenetic analysis of ribosomal RNA and ompA genes, as well as multi-locus sequence analysis of 11 field isolates were conducted. All independent analyses assigned the strains into two different clades of monophyletic origin corresponding to pigeon and psittacine strains or poultry isolates, respectively. Comparative genome analysis involving the type strains of currently accepted Chlamydiaceae species and the designated type strains representing the two new clades confirmed that the latter could be classified into two different species as their average nucleotide identity (ANI) values were always below 94%, both with the closest relative species and between themselves.In view of the evidence obtained from the analyses, we propose the addition of two new species to the current classification: Chlamydia avium sp. nov. comprising strains from pigeons and psittacine birds (type strain 10DC88T; DSMZ: DSM27005T, CSUR: P3508T) and Chlamydia gallinacea sp. nov. comprising strains from poultry (type strain 08-1274/3T; DSMZ: DSM27451T, CSUR: P3509T). © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract={Formagelle di capra is a raw goat cheese produced from whole chilled goat milk; traditional technology involving unpasteurised milk and indigenous lactic starter cultures is employed for its production in Italy. The purpose of this study was to assess the behavior of Escherichia coli O157:H7 during the manufacturing and ripening of this raw goat milk cheese. Raw milk was experimentally inoculated with E. coli O157:H7 in a laboratory scale plant and the count was monitored during production and 30 days of ripening required for this cheese. Results showed that E. coli O157:H7 count increased to more than 1.5 Log cfu g-1 during cheese production and remained constant until the end of ripening. The evidence that E. coli O157:H7 is able to survive during the manufacturing and ripening process suggests that the 30-day ripening period alone is insufficient to eliminate levels of viable E. coli O157:H7 in Formaggelle di capra cheese and that the presence of low numbers of E. coli O157:H7 in milk destined for the production of raw goat milk cheeses could represent a potential source of infection for humans and a threat for consumers. © E.

abstract={Sixteen haemagglutinin (HA) subtypes of avian influenza viruses (AIV) have been described to date. Rapid subtype identification of any AIV is of major interest because of the possible serious consequences for the poultry industry and even public health. Molecular techniques currently allow immediate accurate subtype characterisation prior to virus isolation. In this study, a set of fourteen specific real-time RT-PCR methods were developed and evaluated for AIV HA subtyping (H1-H4, H6-H8, H10-H16), H5 and H9 being excluded on the basis of the current validity of the European Union (EU) recommended specific assays. Specific primers and probes sets for each HA-subtype were designed to hybridise the largest isolates range within each single subtype, considering the Eurasian lineage as a major target. The robustness and general application of the 14 HA-subtype methods were verified by the analysis of 110 AIV isolates belonging to all 16 HA-subtypes, performed in different laboratories. The developed real-time RT-PCR assays proved to be highly specific and revealed suitable sensitivity, allowing direct HA-subtyping of clinical material. In summary, this study provides for the first time a panel of molecular tests using specific hydrolysis probes for rapid and complete AIV HA-subtype identification. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Previous studies had indicated an active role of bovine forestomachs in the response to alimentary disorders as well as to inflammatory and infectious processes in both the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract and elsewhere. We investigated the potential of bovine forestomachs to receive, elaborate and produce signals and mediators of the innate immune response. Indeed, we detected the expression of Toll IL-1R8/single Ig IL-1-related receptor (TIR8/SIGIRR) and other receptors and cytokines, such as Toll-like receptor (TLR)4, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-10 and Caspase-1 in the forestomach walls of healthy cows. Their presence suggests an active role of forestomachs in inflammatory disorders of the GI tract and other body compartments. Moreover, interferon (IFN)-γ was revealed in ruminal content. We confirmed and further characterized the presence of leukocytes in the rumen fluids. In particular, T-, B-lymphocytes and myeloid lineage cells were detected in the ruminal content of both rumen-fistulated heifers and diseased cows. An acidogenic diet based on daily supplements of maize was shown to inhibit leukocyte accumulation, as opposed to a control, hay-based diet, with or without a soy flour (protein) supplement. On the whole, results indicate that bovine forestomachs can receive and elaborate signals for the immune cells infiltrating the rumen content or other organs. Forestomachs can thus participate in a cross-talk with the lymphoid tissues in the oral cavity and promote regulatory actions at both regional and systemic levels; these might include the control of dry matter intake as a function of fundamental metabolic requirements of ruminants. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={In order to evaluate the effect of long transport on weaned piglets transported under warm weather conditions, 144 piglets, previously submitted to a backtest during nursing, were monitored during 4 journeys, each lasting 14. h, carried out from May to September 2009. Into the truck, piglets were allocated in 8 pens on the basis of backtest classification identified as High Resisting (HR), Low resisting (LR), Mixed (M) and Mixed at Loading (MAL). During transport, truck air temperature, skin temperatures and postural and behavioural occurrences were recorded. Prior to and after transportation, blood samples and body weight were also recorded. Piglets lost 5% of their body weight. Environmental conditions affected slightly the behaviour of piglets which were more active during the first 4. h of transport. The behaviour of the piglets was significantly influenced by the type of pen since some differences in biting and exploratory behaviours were found in M pens. Conversely, no differences were found between HR and LR pens. Significant variations with respect to the baseline levels were found only for glucose which decreased and for urea which increased after journey as a result of the prolonged fasting.In general, the results suggest that long-lasting journeys did not have consistent effects on physiological and behavioural parameters of early-weaned piglets while grouping and mixing procedures may affect how they cope with transport. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Italy has experienced recurrent incursions of H5N2 avian influenza (AI) viruses in different geographical areas and varying sectors of the domestic poultry industry. Considering outbreak heterogeneity rather than treating all outbreaks of low pathogenicity AI (LPAI) viruses equally is important given their interactions with the environment and potential to spread, evolve and increase pathogenicity. This study aims at identifying potential environmental drivers of H5N2 LPAI outbreak occurrence in time, space and poultry populations. Thirty-four environmental variables were tested for association with the characteristics of 27 H5N2 LPAI outbreaks (i.e. time, place, flock type, number and species of birds affected) occurred among domestic poultry flocks in Italy in 2010-2012. This was done by applying a recently proposed analytical approach based on a combined non-metric multidimensional scaling, clustering and regression analysis. Results indicated that the pattern of (dis)similarities among the outbreaks entailed an underlying structure that may be the outcome of large-scale, environmental interactions in ecological dimension. Increased densities of poultry breeders, and increased land coverage by industrial, commercial and transport units were associated with increased heterogeneity in outbreak characteristics. In areas with high breeder densities and with many infrastructures, outbreaks affected mainly industrial turkey/layer flocks. Outbreaks affecting ornamental, commercial and rural multi-species flocks occurred mainly in lowly infrastructured areas of northern Italy. Outbreaks affecting rural layer flocks occurred mainly in areas with low breeder densities in south-central Italy. In savannah-like environments, outbreaks affected mainly commercial flocks of galliformes. Suggestive evidence that ecological ordination makes sense genetically was also provided, as virus strains showing high genetic similarity clustered into ecologically similar outbreaks. Findings were informed by hypotheses about how ecological interactions among poultry populations, viruses and their environments can be related to the observed patterns of H5N2 LPAI occurrence. This may prove useful in enhancing future interventions by developing site-specific, ecologically-grounded strategies. © 2014 Mughini-Gras et al.},

abstract={Background: Chlamydia pecorum is the causative agent of a number of acute diseases, but most often causes persistent, subclinical infection in ruminants, swine and birds. In this study, the genome sequences of three C. pecorum strains isolated from the faeces of a sheep with inapparent enteric infection (strain W73), from the synovial fluid of a sheep with polyarthritis (strain P787) and from a cervical swab taken from a cow with metritis (strain PV3056/3) were determined using Illumina/Solexa and Roche 454 genome sequencing.Results: Gene order and synteny was almost identical between C. pecorum strains and C. psittaci. Differences between C. pecorum and other chlamydiae occurred at a number of loci, including the plasticity zone, which contained a MAC/perforin domain protein, two copies of a >3400 amino acid putative cytotoxin gene and four (PV3056/3) or five (P787 and W73) genes encoding phospholipase D. Chlamydia pecorum contains an almost intact tryptophan biosynthesis operon encoding trpABCDFR and has the ability to sequester kynurenine from its host, however it lacks the genes folA, folKP and folB required for folate metabolism found in other chlamydiae. A total of 15 polymorphic membrane proteins were identified, belonging to six pmp families. Strains possess an intact type III secretion system composed of 18 structural genes and accessory proteins, however a number of putative inc effector proteins widely distributed in chlamydiae are absent from C. pecorum. Two genes encoding the hypothetical protein ORF663 and IncA contain variable numbers of repeat sequences that could be associated with persistence of infection.Conclusions: Genome sequencing of three C. pecorum strains, originating from animals with different disease manifestations, has identified differences in ORF663 and pseudogene content between strains and has identified genes and metabolic traits that may influence intracellular survival, pathogenicity and evasion of the host immune system. © 2014 Sait et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={During tuberculosis (TB) surveillance, 53 hunted red deer (Cervus elaphus) were collected to determine whether TB was present in free-ranging animals from an Italian alpine area. Samples (lungs, liver, intestine, and lymph nodes) were cultured and analyzed by real-time PCR assay carried out directly on tissue. Mycobacterium caprae was isolated from small granulomatous, tuberculosis-like lesions in the liver of a 12-yr-old female. Identification of suspect colonies was done by PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the gyrb gene, and genotyping was performed by spoligotyping and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit variable number tandem repeat analysis. The isolated strain was genetically identical to strains isolated in the study area in 2001 from dairy cows imported from Austria and in 2010 from an indigenous cow. The genotype, called "Lechtal," is the most frequently detected in the TB outbreaks in Austria and Germany. The possibility that red deer act as a maintenance host of M. caprae between TB outbreaks could be not excluded. Despite the high red deer population density, the detection of only one infected red deer could suggest that the wildlife management measures applied in the study area (prohibition of artificial feeding and secure removal of offal from hunted animals) may reduce the risk of TB spreading. © Wildlife Disease Association 2014.},

Reassortant influenza A viruses subtypes in swine appeared in European pig population. In particular reassortant viruses carrying genome segment from the pandemic H1N1 (H1N1pdm) are reported in many European countries, including Italy. In a 1000 sows farrow-to feeder farm, in Northern Italy, we isolated 10 IAVs from recurrent episodes of respiratory disease in 45-70 days-old pigs from September 2012 to June 2013. The antigenic and genetic characterization of the swine IAV isolates showed the contemporary circulation of H1N1 avian-like and H1N1pdm strains in the first outbreak. The analysis of the viruses isolated subsequently showed the circulation of H1N1pdm IAV and then the establishment of a new previously undescribed H1N1 reassortant strain with a pandemic derived hemagglutinin gene and all the other seven segments of swine H1N1 avian-like lineage. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a RNA non-enveloped virus that comprises four genotypes. The genome of HEV is organized into three Open Reading Frames (ORFs), and the ORF2 is responsible for encoding capsid proteins. HEV can infect a wide range of hosts, and pigs are considered the main reservoir. HEV infection is considered a zoonosis and it is responsible for acute hepatitis in humans, especially in developing countries.The development of a blocking ELISA would be of high value for screening purpose, because there is no need of species specific reagents. The present study was conducted to assess three in-house ELISAs for the detection of HEV infection in 779 sera collected from breeding and fattening farms under field conditions. Two assays were indirect ELISAs, while the third was a blocking ELISA.Two different recombinant antigens were generated from specific sequences of the HEV-ORF2, and a Latent Class approach in a Bayesian framework was used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of each ELISA. Because the three ELISAs cannot be thought of as independent, all possible dependence structures were modelled starting from the general case of conditional independence to the most complex situation of three mutually dependent assays. Results showed that none of the three ELISAs was significantly superior to the others in terms of sensitivity (posterior median value ranging from 89% to 94%, all 95% posterior credible intervals (95%PCI) overlapped). In terms of specificity, one of the indirect ELISAs was superior to blocking ELISA (posterior median indirect ELISA: 99%, 95%PCI: 98-100%; blocking ELISA: 90%; 95%PCI: 86-94%). However, this difference could be due to the potential wider spectrum of antibodies that blocking ELISA can actually detect. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In this study, we undertook the genomic characterization of 54 pseudorabies virus (PRV) strains isolated in Italy during 1984-2010. The characterization was based on partial sequencing of the UL44 (gC) and US8 (gE) genes; 44 strains (38 for gene gE and 36 for gC) were isolated on pig farms; 9 originated from dogs and 1 from cattle. These porcine PRV strains, which were closely related to those isolated in Europe and America in the last 20 years, and the bovine strain bovine/It/2441/1992 belong to cluster B in both phylogenetic trees. Six porcine strains that do not belong to cluster B are related in both gE and gC phylogenetic trees to the 'old' porcine PRV strains isolated in the 1970s and 1980s. In the last two decades, the presence of these strains in domestic pig populations has been reduced drastically, whereas they are prevalent in wild boar. The two remaining strains have an interesting genomic profile, characterized by the gC gene being closely related to the old porcine PRV strains, and the gE gene being similar to that of recently isolated strains. Three strains originating from working dogs on pig farms are located in cluster B in both phylogenetic trees. Five strains isolated from hunting dogs have a high degree of correlation with PRV strains circulating in wild boar. The last isolate has a gC gene similar to that in the two porcine strains mentioned previously, and the gE gene is correlated with the strains isolated from hunting dogs. These results provide interesting insight into the genomic characterization of PRV strains and reveal a clear differentiation between the strains isolated from hunting dogs that are related to the wild boar strains and those originating from domestic pigs. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={According to Council Regulation 1099/2009 regular checks at stunning are compulsory to ensure that the animals do not present any signs of consciousness or sensibility in the period between the end of the stunning process and death. So far there are no data available on the prevalence of correctly electrically stunned pigs in Italy and on the signs more effective to use in practice to evaluate poorly stunned animals or return of consciousness. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of correctly stunned pigs by electrical stun in Italian commercial abattoirs through the clinical analysis of signs of consciousness. Four commercial abattoirs using three different electric stunning systems were studied to assess the efficiency of stunning. The abattoirs A and C used head-only manual stunning with an intensity ≥ 1.3A; the abattoir D used head-only manual stunning with an intensity 0.4 - 2A and the abattoir B used head-heart automatic stunning with an intensity ≥ 2.5A and ≥ 1A for the head and the chest respectively. A total of 1620 heavy pigs were evaluated from stunning to complete bleeding to evaluate the presence of signs of consciousness (animal alert, presence of rhythmic breathing, head uplift, pain reaction) and other signs (vocalizations, tongue movements, etc.). At the end of the observation the evaluator expressed a judgment concerning the state of consciousness for each pig conscious: presence of rhythmic breathing and/or pain reaction and/or righting reflex and/or the animal appeared alert; unconscious: presence of loss of posture, tonic phase, and clonic phase (not for head-heart automatic stunning); absence of rhythmic breathing, pain reaction, righting reflex; doubtful: not clear presence of rhythmic breathing or pain reaction or righting reflex. A statistically significant difference was observed in the distribution of the state of consciousness between the different abattoirs (p=0.01) and between the three different stunning systems (p=0.04). Abattoir B resulted to be more efficient (0% conscious; 0.25% doubtful) in stunning, compared to the others: abattoir A (0.5% conscious; 1.5% doubtful); C (2% conscious; 0.5% doubtful); D (1.7% conscious; 0.7% doubtful). Pain reaction, rhythmic respiration and head uplift could be used as practical key parameters for a regular evaluation of stunning, however future investigations are needed to better clarify their effectiveness taking into consideration the site of application of tongs and the current applied to each animal. The importance of tongue movements in apparently unconscious animals should be also investigated with more attention. No correlation was found between the state of consciousness and any of the anamnestic variables considered (signs of recent fighting; weight higher or lower than the range; signs of stress).},

abstract={Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Mhyo) is the principal etiological agent of enzootic pneumonia (EP), one of the most economically important diseases in the pig production industry worldwide. Although swine and wild boars (Sus scrofa) share susceptibility to Mhyo infection, information regarding the dynamics of Mhyo infections and pathology in wild boars is currently limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the spatiotemporal dynamics of Mhyo infections in free-living wild boars through serological ELISA testing. Additionally, the presence of EP-like gross lesions and their association with the presence of Mhyo, based on a PCR assay, were assessed. Over a period of 5 years, antibodies against Mhyo were detected in 655 (30.0 %) of the 2,177 analyzed wild boars. A generalized temporal increase of seroprevalence coupled with an increase of mean antibody titers of seropositive individuals was found. Moreover, a similar seroprevalence between age classes associated with higher antibody titers of younger individuals indicated the wild boars were infected during the early stages of their life. Out of 99 lungs tested, 43 showed EP-like lesions and 45 were PCR positive for the presence of Mhyo DNA. The lung lesion scores were related to the sex and age of the wild boars, with young individuals having higher lung scores than others, and there was a positive association with the Mhyo PCR-positive status. The temporal increase of the Mhyo seroprevalence and infection association with EP-like lesions, when coupled with the spreading of wild boar populations, raises concerns on the epidemiological role of this species. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Biobanking is an essential tool for ensuring easy availability of high-quality biomaterial collections that combine essential samples and epidemiological, clinical, and research data for the scientific community. Specimen collection is an integral part of clinical research. Indeed, every year throughout the world, millions of biological samples are stored for diagnostics and research, but in many fields the lack of biological material and models is a major hindrance for ongoing research. A biobank facility provides suitable samples for large-scale screening studies and database repositories. Software dedicated to biological banks simplify sample registration and identification, the cataloging of sample properties (type of sample/specimen, associated diseases and/or therapeutic protocols, environmental information, etc.), sample tracking, quality assurance, and specimen availability characterized by well-defined features. Biobank facilities must adopt good laboratory practices (GLPs) and a stringent quality control system and also comply with ethical issues, when required.
The creation of a veterinary network can be useful under different aspects: the first one is related to the importance of animal sciences itself to improve research and strategies in the different branches of the veterinary area, and the second aspect is related to the possibility of data management harmonization to improve scientific cooperation. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.},

abstract={The causative agent of paratuberculosis in ruminants, Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), although still a matter of debate, has been linked with Crohn's and other human diseases. The availability of rapid methods for assessing the viability of MAP cells in food, in particular milk, could be of great use for risk management in food safety. MAP viability is generally assessed using culture techniques that require prolonged incubation periods for the growth of MAP. To differentiate between viable and nonviable MAP cells in milk samples, this study explores the combination of two already described techniques: peptide magnetic bead separation followed by Propidium Monoazide qPCR. Using an Ordinal Multinomial Logistic Regression model to analyze the results obtained after spiking milk samples with mixtures containing different percentages of viable/dead cells, we were able to assess the probability of the viability status of MAP found in milk. This model was applied to contaminated pasteurized milk to ascertain the efficacy of heat treatment in MAP killing. The method reported herein can potentially be used for direct detection of MAP viability in milk. © 2014 Federation of European Microbiological Societies. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Three batches of sliced Mortadella were vacuum packed, stored at 8°C and samples collected at different time intervals were enumerated for L. monocytogenes. The pathogen counts were fitted using the DMFit version 2.1 Excel® add-in, based on Baranyi model, to determine the specific growth rates. At 8°C the sliced Mortadella supported rapid and prolific L. monocytogenes growth: The μmax varied between 0.035/h and 0.044/h, and the pathogen counts increased up to 108 CFU/g after 21-27 days. A square root type model, Ratkowsky model, was used to describe how μmax changes as a function of storage temperature. Growth kinetics data could be useful for establishing a safe shelf life, once the product could be post process contaminated and stored under different handling scenarios.},

For FBOs it is essential to demonstrate for each production process whether the substrate allows the growth of L. monocytogenesand whether L. monocytogenescould reach or exceed the limit of 100 cfu g -1 at the end of the shelf life, as stated by EC Regulation no. 2073/2005. In the present study, the growth potential of L. monocytogenes during the shelf life of low fat salami packed in modified atmosphere was evaluated.

abstract={Leptospirosis is an important zoonotic disease diffused worldwide, and wildlife species are commonly considered to be important epidemiological carriers. Four-hundred and forty‑one serological and 198 renal samples from red deer, roe deer and chamois collected in the Province of Sondrio were analysed using the microscopic agglutination test and histopathologic examination. Positive serological findings were found only in 15 red deer and 19 positive serologic reactions were recorded. The most frequent serovars were Bratislava and Grippotyphosa, followed by Pomona, Hardjo and Copenhagheni. Twenty-two per cent of renal samples from seropositive red deer were affected by mild to moderate multifocal chronic lymphoplasmacytic and fibrosing tubulo-interstitial nephritis, mainly involving the cortical parenchyma. In this study, antibodies to Leptospira spp. were infrequent in wild ruminants, and only red deer seemed to be sensitive to the infection. Given the low presence and the fact that there was no record of Leptospira spp. infections in cattle, sheep, goats and also hunters in area during the study period, wild ruminants in Alpine environments cannot be considered as reservoirs or important sources of Leptospira spp. infection for humans or domestic animals. © 2014, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise "G.Caporale".

Another batch was inoculated (1% v:w) with sterile physiological saline solution and used to check the lactic acid bacteria (Lab) behaviour and the changes of physicochemical parameters (pH and aw). Both batches were then processed to obtain a semi-dry salami (Hungarian-style): microbiological and physico-chemical properties were monitored during 94 days of ripening. During the manufacturing process, the levels of pathogen decreased of about 2.18 log CFU/g with respect to the initial inoculated levels.

abstract={In 2008, a media crisis flared up and the issue triggered a prolonged "food scare": raw milk was blamed as the cause of several cases of Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (HUS) due to shiga-toxin producing strains Escherichia coli, which are highly pathogenic and sometimes lethal in children. The immediate response of the Minister of Health was an urgent decree, that ordered to report "raw milk: to be boiled before consumption" in front of the distributors in red-characters and with a defined size. Therefore, instead of reassuring consumers, this warning appeared as the admission that milk was unsafe, and a confirmation that there was a real food safety problem out there. Scope of the present article is to highlight how the risk-management cycle developed, departing from the media framing of the issue. The lack of time (5 days passed from problem recognition to risk management measures) resulted in an over-conservative yet effective policy option, but at the expense of farmers, blamed of selling dangerous milk. Results suggests that there was an inverted policy-making cycle, in the try to reassure the citizens while providing a protective risk management (and at the same time allowing raw milk sales to continue, even if under rigid conditions). We consider how the framework given by the media conditioned strongly the policy measures undertaken, limiting a wider set of policy options and suggestions © Mattioli 1885},

abstract={The frequency and timing of rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) epizootics and their impact on different age groups of rabbits were studied for 15 years in a recovering rabbit population in South Australia. We recorded the number and body size of rabbits dying during RHD epizootics, collected tissue for genetic analysis of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus variants and compared the number of carcasses found to the number of susceptible rabbits present at the beginning of each epizootic. All RHD epizootics occurred between late winter and spring, but, progressively, epizootics started earlier and became more frequent and prolonged, fewer susceptible adult rabbits were present during epizootics, and the age of rabbits dying of RHD declined. Increased infection and virus shedding in juvenile rabbits offers the most plausible explanation for those epidemiological changes; the disease is now increasingly transmitted through populations of kittens, starting before young-of-the-year reach adult size and persisting late in the breeding season, so that most rabbits are challenged in their year of birth. These changes have increased juvenile mortality due to RHD but reduced total mortality across all age groups, because age-specific mortality rates are lower in young rabbits than in older rabbits. We hypothesise that this may be the proximate cause of recovery in rabbit populations across Australia and possibly elsewhere. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The method is based on a solid–liquid extraction followed by a Mycosep 226 clean-up. Accuracy and precision were established at the LOQ (1 µg kg−1) with a spiked sample as well as with two other different naturally contaminated reference materials. The mean overall recovery (n = 18) was 100.8%, with a confidence interval of 2.7% and a CV% of 5.5%. The performance of the proposed method was compared with the AOAC method based on the use of immunoaffinity chromatography columns, proving that it could be considered a valid alternative. Moreover, the sample preparation is very simple and straightforward, potentially being applicable as a high-throughput method. On account of its simplicity and low cost, the method may be applied to the analysis of a large number of samples in the occasion of outbreaks of large-scale contamination. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

Herein is described a case of malakoplakia in a 10-month-old slaughter pig. Diffuse, pleomorphic, round cell infiltrates, mainly histiocytes, with a tumor-like growth pattern at gross examination, infiltrated the stomach, pancreas, omentum, and mesenteric lymph nodes. The histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells had concentric, target-like inclusions known as Michaelis-Gutmann bodies. Microorganisms were not detected by the periodic acid–Schiff reaction, Ziehl-Neelsen, Gram, and Warthin-Starry staining or by electron microscopic and bacteriologic investigations. Porcine circovirus type 2 and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome viruses were not detected by immunohistochemistry in the sections examined. © The Author(s) 2013.},

abstract={Consumption of raw or insufficiently cooked mussels contaminated with hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a major cause of infection to humans. The origin of mussels commonly used for the preparation of marinated seafood salads is often unknown, since different producers worldwide undergo a precooking treatment at the original collection site with methods and parameters not always indicated. These treatments could be insufficient for the inactivation of HAV, which is characterized by a high temperature resistance. Both high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) and marinade treatments have been shown to affect HAV vitality. In this study, two treatments (HHP and marinating) were combined in order to assess a potential synergistic effect on the virus vitality. A kinetic test was conducted by subjecting the experimentally-contaminated mussels (HAV titre: 106/ml TCID<inf>50</inf>) to marinating, and to different HHP treatment (4,000; 5,000; and 6,000 bar for 1, 5, and 9 min). Virus post-treatment vitality was assessed by its ability to grow on cell cultures and by quantitative real-time RT-PCR to evaluate virus resistance under such conditions. Marinating treatment alone (final pH 4.3, and NaCl 2 %) did not inactivate the virus. On the other hand, the use of HHP treatment alone on non-marinated HAV-contaminated mussels was effective only above 5,000 bar for 5 min. The results of the present study elucidate the synergistic effect of a combination between marination and HHP treatments on the inactivation of the virus. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Group A rotaviruses (RVA) cause acute dehydrating diarrhea in young of man and many animal species, including pigs. Swine RVA has an important economic impact on the farming industry, and pigs represent a potential reservoir for zoonotic transmission of RVA to humans.To investigate the genetic diversity of porcine RVA strains in Italy and identify their possible zoonotic characteristics, 25 RVA-positive feces were collected from diarrheic pigs in Northern Italy, in 2009-2010; all viral strains were characterized by G and P genotyping RT-PCR. Three samples were selected for full genome sequencing. Sequencing of the NSP3 genes of all samples was also performed.Rotavirus diagnosis was carried out by ELISA and electron microscopy. RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing were performed in a one-tube format, using primer sets specific for each of the 11 genome segments. Analysis of the G (VP7) and P (VP4) genotypes showed that all strains identified were typical porcine RVAs (G4, G5, G9; P[6], P[13], P[23]).Full-length genome sequencing was performed on selected G9 isolates. Most segments belonged to the genotype constellation 1 (Wa-like), which is shared by most human RVA strains, but gene types such as I5 (VP6) and A8 (NSP1), which are typical of porcine and rare among human RVAs, were also detected. We identified RVA strains showing the T7 genotype, an NSP3 gene type that was previously reported in unusual strains of possible porcine or bovine origin from children with diarrhea.Recent reports suggested that G9 RVA may have been introduced from swine to human populations involving gene reassortment events. The observation that some of the RVA genotypes from swine in Italy were similar to viruses characterized in children underlines the importance of animal RVA surveillance, to clarify and monitor the role of animals as genetic reservoirs of emerging RVA strains pathogenic for humans. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Salmonella spp. have been isolated from a wide range of wild animals. Opportunistic wild carnivores such as red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and badgers (Meles meles) may act as environmental indicators or as potential sources of salmonellosis in humans. The present study characterizes Salmonella spp. isolated from the intestinal contents of hunted or dead red foxes (n = 509) and badgers (n = 17) in northern Italy. Findings: Thirty-one strains of Salmonella belonging to 3 Salmonella enterica subspecies were isolated. Fourteen different serovars of S. enterica subsp. enterica were identified, among which were serovars often associated with human illness. Conclusions: Wild opportunistic predators can influence the probability of infection of both domestic animals and humans through active shedding of the pathogen to the environment. The epidemiological role of wild carnivores in the spread of salmonellosis needs to be further studied. © 2014 Chiari et al.},

abstract={Following the emergence of the A(H1N1)pdm09 in humans, this novel influenza virus was reverse transmitted from infected people to swine population worldwide. In this study we investigated the molecular evolution of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus identified in pigs reared in a single herd. Nasal swabs taken from pigs showing respiratory distress were tested for influenza type A and A(H1N1)pdm09 by real-time RT-PCR assays. Virus isolation from positive samples was attempted by inoculation of nasal swabs samples into specific pathogen free embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) and complete genome sequencing was performed on virus strains after replication on ECE or from original swab sample. The molecular analysis of hemagglutinin (HA) showed, in four of the swine influenza viruses under study, a unique significant amino acid change, represented by a two-amino acid insertion at the HA receptor binding site. Phylogenetic analysis of HA, neuraminidase, and concatenated internal genes revealed a very similar topology, with viruses under study forming a separate cluster, branching outside the A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates recognized until 2014. The emergence of this new cluster of A(H1N1)pdm09 in swine raises further concerns about whether A(H1N1)pdm09 with new molecular characteristics will become established in pigs and potentially transmitted to humans. © 2014 Arianna Boni et al.},

Considering a shelf life of 90 days, as defined by manufacturer, the packages of sliced bresaola were stored at 5°C for 7 days and at 8°C for the remaining storage time (83 days). L. monocytogenes count decreased during storage test from 1.43/1.98 log cfu/g in the three batches tested to 1.03 log cfu/g in one batch and to undetectable levels in the other two batches.

Forty conventional M. hyopneumoniae-free pigs were randomly assigned to four groups (ten animals each): Group A=intradermal administration of the test vaccine by using the needle-less IDAL® vaccinator at a dose of 0.2ml; Group B=intramuscular administration of a commercially available vaccine (vaccine B); Group C=intramuscular administration of the adjuvant only (2ml of X-solve adjuvant); Group D=intramuscular administration of a commercially available vaccine (vaccine D). Pigs were vaccinated at 28 days of age. Blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples were collected at vaccination (blood only), 4 and 8 weeks post-vaccination. Serum and BAL fluid were tested for the presence of antibodies by ELISA test. Peripheral blood monomorphonuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated to quantify the number of IFN-γ secreting cells by ELISpot. Moreover, cytokine gene expression from the BAL fluid was performed. Total antibodies against M. hyopneumoniae and specific IgG were detected in serum of intradermally and intramuscularly (vaccine B only) vaccinated pigs at 4 and 8 weeks post-vaccination. M. hyopneumoniae specific IgA were detected in BAL fluid from vaccinated animals (Groups A and B) but not from controls and animals vaccinated with the bacterin D (p&lt;0.05). Significantly higher gene expression of IL-10 was observed in the BAL fluid at week 8 post-vaccination in the intradermally vaccinated pigs (p&lt;0.05). The results support that the intradermal administration of an adjuvanted bacterin induces both systemic and mucosal immune responses. Moreover, the intramuscularly administered commercial vaccines each had a different ability to stimulate the immune response both systemically and locally. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Biogas production is mainly based on the anaerobic digestion of cereals silages and maize silage is the most utilized. Regarding biogas production, the most important portion of the plant is the ear. The corn ear, due to high starch content, is characterized by a higher biogas production compared to the silage of the whole plant.In this paper, we present the results of experimental field tests carried out in Northern Italy that aim to evaluate the anaerobic methane potential (BMP) of different portions of ensiled maize hybrids. The BMP production is evaluated considering the possibility of harvesting and ensiling: the whole plant; the plant cut at 75cm of height; the ear only; the plant without the ear. For the different solutions, the results are reported as specific BMP and as average biogas production achievable per hectare. The methane production by harvesting and ensiling the whole plant (10,212 and 10,605m 3 ha -1 , for maize class 600 and 700, respectively) is higher than the ones achievable by the other plant portions (7961 and 7707m 3 ha -1 , from the ear; 9523 and 9784m 3 ha -1 , from the plant cut at 75cm; 3328 and 3554m 3 ha -1 , from the plant without the ear, for maize class 600 and 700, respectively). The harvest of the whole plant, although it is the most productive solution, could not be the best solution under an economic and environmental point of view. Harvesting only the ear can be interesting considering the new Italian subsidy framework and for the biogas plants fed by biomass transported over long distances. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Introduction - Quantification of the economic losses related to Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) infection is essential to encourage participation of dairy cattle producers in Paratuberculosis control programs. The aim of this study was to estimate the loss of income related to MAP infection in dairy herds of the Emilia-Romagna Region, Northern Italy. Materials - Results of a monitoring plan carried out on bulk milk samples in 2011-2012 were used to recruit case (n=40) and control dairy herds (n=46). Herds were tested using a commercial ELISA every four months, for a total of three tests. Cases were selected among herds positive to at least one bulk milk test. In these herds, serological testing was carried out on heads older than 36 months using the same ELISA to confirm MAP infection and estimate prevalence. In 175 herds where all the bulk milk tests were negative, we serologically tested a sample of 30 cows older than 36 months, and collected six fecal environmental samples for PCR and cultural tests. If all these tests were negative, the herd was considered as control. Each case was matched with at least one control according to the geographic location and herd size. For the selected herds, we collected data on cows older than 24 months reared during the two years preceding the individual serological testing. Data such as ear-tag, sex, breed, type of movement, date of birth, date of death/culling were extracted from the farm register of the Cattle National Database. Results - A total of 19,215 cows, mostly Friesian, were considered. For cases we found a shorter life of culled cows (62.3 vs 64.5 months; p<0.01), a higher culling rate (31.7% vs 27.3%; p=0.02), and a higher mortality rate (3.6% vs 2.6%; p=0.07). We used a spreadsheet to quantify costs due to the observed differences. For case herds we estimated a loss of more than 200 €/cow/year: 60% of costs were related to reduced milk production due to the shorter life of cows. Conclusions - This study, the first on economic impact of Paratuberculosis in Italy, suggests that MAP is associated with herd-level economic losses, supporting the implementation of control programs to recover producers profitability.},

abstract={The efficacies of two commercial Porcine Circovirus 2 (PCV2) vaccines were compared in conventional pigs based on humoral response, viral load, clinical observation, and growth performance from weaning to 220 days of age. A double-blind, randomised, and controlled field trial was performed on an Italian 420-sow farrow-to-finish farm. One thousand and fifty piglets, from five consecutive batches, were included in this trial. The piglets were stratified by sex, weight, parity of the sow and randomly allocated to 3 groups. At inclusion (weaning at 25±2 days of age), 349 animals (group A) received a 0.5 ml intramuscular dose of Circovac®, 351 animals (group B) received a 1 ml intramuscular dose of CircoFLEX®. Another group (group C) of 350 pigs was kept as unvaccinated control. Weights were recorded at inclusion, at 105 and 220 days of age, and the average daily weight gain (ADWG) was calculated. For serologic and virologic studies, blood samples were collected monthly, from weaning to 180 days of life, from a randomly selected sample of animals coming from batch no. 3. Compared to the control group, vaccinated animals showed a significant increase of ADWG from 25-105, 105-220 and 25-220 days of age. Both animals vaccinated with Circovac® and those vaccinated with Circoflex® showed ADWG significantly higher than those of the control group during the three considered periods. The difference between ADWG of group A and group B was not statistically significant for any of the three time periods. The percentage of 25-to-220-day dead pigs and runts were very similar; however, incidence of underweight pigs was statistically lower in the vaccinated groups. The vaccination seemed to reduce the viral pressure in the facilities. This observation is supported by the qPCR data, which showed, that vaccinated animals had a lower serum viral load. No statistically significant difference in the considered parameters was observed between the two vaccines.},

abstract={Bovine mastitis caused by Prototheca spp. infection is increasing worldwide, therefore becoming more relevant to the dairy industry. Almost all Prototheca isolates from bovine mammary protothecosis came from P. zopfii genotype 2, with a lower prevalence of infection due to P. blaschkeae and rarely to P. wickerhamii. In this study, we report the development of two multiplex PCR assays able to discriminate among the three species responsible for bovine intramammary infection (IMI). Our assay is based on the specific amplification of new DNA target from mitochondria and chloroplasts partial sequences, of different Prototheca isolates. Both methods were set up using reference strains belonging to all Prototheca species and validated by the analysis of 93 isolates from bovine and buffalo IMI and bulk tank milk samples. The investigation involves 70 isolates from North, 13 from Central and 10 from South Italian regions. Isolates from bovine were most commonly identified as P. zopfii genotype 2, and only in one case as P. blaschkeae, whereas isolates from buffaloes belonged both to P. zopfii genotype 2 and P. wickerhamii. These findings proved the suitability of our multiplex PCRs as a rapid test to discriminate among pathogenic Prototheca strains. © 2014 The Society for Applied Microbiology.},

abstract={We investigated the circulation dynamics of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs) in the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) reservoir in Italy. In particular, we evaluated the temporal distribution of virologic findings by combining virus isolation data with a new population genetic-based study approach. Thus, during 11 consecutive sampling periods (wintering periods between 1993/94 and 2003/04), categorised into 40 sampling sub-periods, cloacal swab samples were collected from 996 wild and 16 captive-reared mallards, to be screened by RT-PCR before attempting influenza A virus isolation in embryonated eggs. Forty-eight LPAIVs were isolated from wild mallards and antigenically characterised by haemagglutination-inhibition and neuraminidase-inhibition assays. When considering LPAIV antigenic subtypes in which more than one mallard tested virus isolation positive (H1N1, n. 22; H2N3, n. 2; H5N3, n. 2; H6N5, n. 3; H6N8, n. 2; H7N3, n. 3; H11N6, n. 5), at least two birds infected with a specific HN subtype clustered within one same sampling sub-period. In the context of the novel population genetic approach, total DNA was extracted from a subset of 16 captive-reared and 65 wild ducks (2000/01 and 2001/02 sampling periods) to assess genetic diversity by amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) markers. Analyses of AFLP results showed that captive-reared mallards clustered together, whereas two main independent clusters characterised the distribution pattern of most wild mallards. Within this subset of samples, nearly identical H7N3 LPAIV strains were isolated from two wild mallards belonging to the same genetic cluster. Blood sera were also collected from the above subset of mallards and examined for antibodies to the homologous H7N3 virus strain. Four out of six wild mallards testing H7N3-seropositive by haemagglutination-inhibition assay (2001/02 period) belonged to the genetic cluster including H7N3 virus shedding ducks. Overall, our data raise the possibility of an enhanced transmission and circulation of LPAIVs in genetic or social groups of wild mallards, gathered in flocks possibly related by parentage and/or geographic origin. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Approximately 23,000 hunter-harvested wild boars from the pre-Alpine area of northern Italy were examined for tuberculosis over a 9-year period (2003 to 2011). Retropharyngeal and mandibular lymph nodes from the wild boars were examined grossly, and 1,151 of the lymph nodes were analyzed in our laboratory by histology (728 samples) and culture isolation (819 samples). Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC)-specific PCR (1,142 samples) was used for molecular-level detection in tissue samples, as was a gyrB restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay (322 samples). Lesions compatible with tuberculosis and indistinguishable from those described in cases of Mycobacterium bovis infection had been observed since 2003. Mycobacterium microti was identified directly in 256 tissue samples by the adopted molecular approaches. However, only 26 M. microti strains were obtained by culture isolation due to the well-known difficulties in isolating this slow-growing mycobacterium. During 2006, a prevalence study was performed in two provinces of the area, and the diffusion of M. microti was calculated to be 5.8% (95% confidence intervals surrounding the estimated prevalences [CIP95%], 3.94 to 7.68%). Over the following years (2007 to 2011), the presence of M. microti appeared to be stable. All isolates were genotyped by spoligotyping and exact tandem repeat analysis (ETR types A to F). In addition to the typical vole type (SB0118), a new spoligotype lacking the 43 spacers was found. Spoligotyping was also applied directly to tissue samples, and a geographical cluster distribution of the two spoligotypes was observed. This is the first report studying the diffusion and genetic variability of M. microti in wild boar. Copyright © 2014, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.},

The anaerobic digestion of animal manure and energy crops is a promising way of reducing GHG emissions.The increasing number of biogas plants involves a high consumption of energy crops and the needed of big agricultural area. In Italy, cereals silages are the main feedstock for biogas production and are commonly grown under two different crop systems: single crop (only maize) and double crops (maize later winter cereals).In this paper we present the results of experimental field tests carried out by monitoring the anaerobic biomethane potential (BMP) of different cereals silages commonly grown in the Padanian Plan.A laboratory device has been developed to measure the specific biomethane production of the different cereal silages. The different energy crops have been evaluated, in single and double crop systems, expressing the biomethane production per hectare.The maize hybrids show higher specific biomethane potentials respect to winter cereals. Maize FAO class 700 achieves the highest production per hectare as a single crop. Nevertheless, the highest biomethane productions per hectare are reached with double crop system in particular when maize FAO class 500 follows triticale (+12% respect the best single crop system). © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Context Recovery of Australian rabbit populations from the impact of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) contrasts with more prolonged suppression of wild rabbits in Europe, and has been widely discussed in the scientific community, but not yet documented in formal scientific literature. The underlying causes of recovery remain unclear, but resistance to RHDV infection has been reported in laboratory studies of wild-caught rabbits. Aims We document numerical changes in two South Australian wild rabbit populations that were initially suppressed by RHDV, and examine serological data to evaluate several alternative hypotheses for the cause of recovery. Methods Rabbit numbers were assessed from spotlight transect counts and dung mass transects between 1991 and 2011, and age and RHDV antibody sero-prevalence were estimated from rabbits shot in late summer. Key results Rabbit numbers were heavily suppressed by RHDV between 1995 and 2002, then increased 5-to 10-fold between 2003 and 2010. During the period of increase, annual RHDV infection rates remained stable or increased slightly, average age of rabbits remained stable and annual rainfall was below average. Conclusions Rabbit populations recovered but neither avoidance of RHDV infection, gradual accumulation of long-lived RHD-immune rabbits, nor high pasture productivity were contributing factors. This leaves increased annual survival from RHDV infection as the most likely cause of recovery. Implications Previously documented evidence of resistance to RHDV infection may be of little consequence to post-RHD recovery in rabbit numbers, unless the factors that influence the probability of infection also shape the course of infection and affect survival of infected rabbits. © 2014 CSIRO.},

abstract={Hygiene and biosecurity deficiencies in breeding farms are amplified exponentially in the hatchery. The microbial population present in the hatchery has a significant impact on the quality of the chicks, on their chances of survival and their productive performances. The purpose of the present study was to assess the degree of bacterial contamination of chicken eggs in an industrial poultry hatchery. Samples of twenty batches of eggs, collected at different stages of the incubation, from the arrival to the hatcher, were subjected to bacteriological tests. The bacterial contamination of the eggs at the arrival, both of the shells than of the yolks, was found to be rather low. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other bacteria of minor importance such as Citrobacter freundii, Providencia alcalifaciens, Enterobacter spp., Enterobacter agglomerans, Pseudomonas cepacia, Sphingomonas paucimobilis were isolated. At the hatching, the bacterial contamination was significantly larger. Escherichia coli was present in the 88,25% of eggs pipped but chicks dead-in-shell, and in most of the chicks dead-in-shell without pipping (22%). Various other bacteria species were also isolated (in association or not with Escherichia coli or Salmonella Livingstone), in particular: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter spp., Escherichia fergusonii, Citrobacter koseri, Citrobacter amalonaticus, Citrobacter freundii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter lwoffii, Serratia liquefaciens. Salmonella Livingstone was isolated from dead-in-shell chicks of two batches of eggs. The results of the present survey confirm the role of Escherichia coli as one of the major bacterial contaminant of poultry hatcheries. Moreover, results of our study highlight how the hatchery may have an amplifier effect of the bacterial contamination. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, present respectively in the 5% and in the 10% of the batches of eggs at the arrival, were found during the hatching respectively in the 15% and 100% of dead-in-shell chicks.},

abstract={The need for antibiotic treatments in dairy cattle farms can be reduced by a combined intervention scheme based on: (1) timely clinical inspections, (2) the assessment of animal-based welfare parameters, and (3) the use of predictive laboratory tests. These can provide greater insight into environmental adaptation of dairy cows and define animals at risk of contracting disease. In the long-term, an improved disease control justifies the adoption of such a combined strategy. Many antibiotic treatments for chronic disease cases are often not justified with a cost/benefit analysis, because the repeated drug administration does not give rise to the expected outcome in terms of animal health. In particular, compared with untreated cases, antibiotics may not lead to greater cure rates for some forms of mastitis. Lastly, a substantial reduction of antibiotic usage in dairy farms can be achieved through the proper use of immunomodulators, aimed at increasing immunocompetence and disease resistance of cows. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Bovine udder infections induce a variety of changes in gene expression of different growth factors that may suggest their possible role in glandular tissue protection or repair processes. Growth factors and also chemokines and cytokines may act synergistically to increase the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages to promote angiogenesis, fibroplasia, matrix deposition, and, ultimately, re-epithelialization. Considering the vast applications, typically in human medicine, of platelet concentrate (PC) and its ease of preparation, the aim of our study was to evaluate an alternative therapy to stimulate the regeneration of glandular tissue, administering a concentration in excess of the growth factors contained in the PC. In each one of the 3 farms examined in the trial, PC was prepared from donor cows in good health, free from infections, and with no records of medications administered during the previous 2 mo. The platelet produced in one farm was used only for treating the cows of the same farm in a heterologous way. A total of 229 mastitic quarters were divided in 3 groups: antibiotic group (treated with intramammary antibiotic), antibiotic and PC group (treated intramammarily with antibiotics in association with PC), and PC group (treated with intramammary PC alone). The diagnosis of mastitis was based on somatic cell count and bacteriological evaluation of the milk from the affected quarter. Platelet concentrate, alone or in association with antibiotic, was used for 3 consecutive days as an unconventional therapy in bovine acute and chronic mastitis. Our data show that the associated action of antibiotic and PC performed significantly better than the antibiotic alone, either for the recovery of the affected mammary quarters or for somatic cell count reduction. In the same way, the association antibiotic plus PC showed significantly fewer relapses compared with the antibiotic alone, either for acute or chronic mastitis. The treatment with only PC did not show statistically significant differences compared with both antibiotic alone or associated treatment for acute mastitis, and it was better than the use of only antibiotic for chronic mastitis. Our results show that PC alone may be useful for a quick resolution of the inflammatory response, playing a role in limiting the tissue damage to the mammary gland parenchyma and reducing the recurrence rates. © 2014 American Dairy Science Association.},

abstract={Bubaline herpesvirus 1 (BuHV1) is a member of ruminant alphaherpesviruses antigenically related to bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV1). The impact of BuHV1 infection in infectious bovine rhinotracheitis control program is difficult to establish, due to the lack of specific diagnostic test. The ectodomain of glycoprotein E of BuHV1 was expressed as recombinant secreted protein and used in indirect ELISA as well as in a discriminatory test using the BoHV1 counterpart. A panel of monoclonal antibodies was produced against BuHV1; 6 out of 7 anti-gE monoclonal antibodies specifically recognized the BuHV1 gE. Results indicated BuHV1 gE as a sensitive marker of infection compared to seroneutralization (SN) test or blocking ELISA. When BoHV1 and BuHV1 gEs were immobilized in different wells of the same ELISA microplate, bovine and water buffalo sera were more reactive against the respective infecting virus. About one third of seropositive buffaloes with no history of contact with cattle and having higher SN titres, reacted in BoHV1 gE blocking ELISA, possibly because of steric hindrance. Since in two occasions BuHV1 was also isolated from water buffalo scoring gB+/gE+ BoHV1 blocking ELISA, we conclude that the combination of the two blocking ELISAs is not suitable to differentiate between BoHV1 and BuHV1. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The progressive decline in the hare population across Europe has been associated with the occurrence of European brown hare syndrome (EBHS), a highly contagious disease considered endemic in all European countries. This study aimed to evaluate the in-field temporal dynamics of European brown hare syndrome virus (EBHSV) infection in wild European brown hares (Lepus europaeus) and to test the influence of population density on EBHS seroprevalence. A total of 512 blood samples were collected from free ranging hares captured for restocking in seven different areas of the province of Brescia (Northern Italy) during seven consecutive years (2006–2013) and tested using a competitive ELISA. A generalized linear mixed model estimated the yearly effects of population density on EBHS prevalence. Of the 512 tested, 344 (67.2 %) tested positive for EBHSV antibodies, with the annual seroprevalence ranging from 94.3 to 35.8 %. The prevalence was 3.303 times higher in areas with a density of over 15 hares/km2 and declined over the years. The results indicate the ongoing transmission of the virus in the tested brown hare population. Since the eradication of EBHS in a wild population is not feasible, a strategy aimed at promoting the endemic stability of the virus through density-dependent mechanisms could be applied; however, this seems more difficult in practice than in theory and would most likely require a very high density of brown hares. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Cisplatin (CisPt) is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug whose side effects include muscle weakness and cachexia. Here we analysed CisPt-induced atrophy in C2C12 myotubes by a multidisciplinary morphological approach, focusing on the onset and progression of autophagy, a protective cellular process that, when excessively activated, may trigger protein hypercatabolism and atrophy in skeletal muscle. To visualize autophagy we used confocal and transmission electron microscopy at different times of treatment and doses of CisPt. Moreover we evaluated the effects of taurine, a cytoprotective beta-amino acid able to counteract oxidative stress, apoptosis, and endoplasmic reticulum stress in different tissues and organs. Our microscopic results indicate that autophagy occurs very early in 50 μM CisPt challenged myotubes (4 h-8 h) before overt atrophy but it persists even at 24 h, when several autophagic vesicles, damaged mitochondria, and sarcoplasmic blebbings engulf the sarcoplasm. Differently, 25 mM taurine pretreatment rescues the majority of myotubes size upon 50 μM CisPt at 24 h. Taurine appears to counteract atrophy by restoring regular microtubular apparatus and mitochondria and reducing the overload and the localization of autophagolysosomes. Such a promising taurine action in preventing atrophy needs further molecular and biochemical studies to best define its impact on muscle homeostasis and the maintenance of an adequate skeletal mass in vivo. © 2014 Alessandra Stacchiotti et al.},

abstract={The impact of weather variables on Culex pipiens L. (Diptera: Culicidae) population dynamics in the Po Valley, Northern Italy, a densely populated region containing the largest industrial and agricultural areas in Italy, was investigated. Monitoring of mosquitoes was carried out by using CO2-baited traps without light, collecting data weekly from 1700 to 0900 hours during the period May-September, from 1997 to 2011. Daily minimum, average, and maximum relative humidity; daily minimum, maximum, and average temperature; rainfall; and hydroclimatic balance (rainfall-potential evapotranspiration) were obtained from three weather stations within the surveillance zone. The average population dynamic trend over the 15-yr period showed a bell-shaped curve with a major peak in June and a secondary peak at the end of August in the rural areas, whereas bimodality was not evidenced in the urban areas. The correlation analyses showed that the mosquito seasonal population and the population in the period of maximum West Nile virus circulation (August-September) was mostly affected by the relative humidity registered from March to July, particularly in May, and, to a lower extent, also by hydroclimatic balance registered in April-July, and by the rainfall occurred in June-July. In addition, the rate of increase of the population during the spring months influenced the development of the mosquito population of the following months. © 2014 Entomological Society of America.},

abstract={We applied optimal control theory to an SI epidemic model to identify optimal culling strategies for diseases management in wildlife. We focused on different forms of the objective function, including linear control, quadratic control, and control with limited amount of resources. Moreover, we identified optimal solutions under different assumptions on disease-free host dynamics, namely: self-regulating logistic growth, Malthusian growth, and the case of negligible demography. We showed that the correct characterization of the disease-free host growth is crucial for defining optimal disease control strategies. By analytical investigations of the model with negligible demography, we demonstrated that the optimal strategy for the linear control can be either to cull at the maximum rate at the very beginning of the epidemic (reactive culling) when the culling cost is low, or never to cull, when culling cost is high. On the other hand, in the cases of quadratic control or limited resources, we demonstrated that the optimal strategy is always reactive. Numerical analyses for hosts with logistic growth showed that, in the case of linear control, the optimal strategy is always reactive when culling cost is low. In contrast, if the culling cost is high, the optimal strategy is to delay control, i.e. not to cull at the onset of the epidemic. Finally, we showed that for diseases with the same basic reproduction number delayed control can be optimal for acute infections, i.e. characterized by high disease-induced mortality and fast dynamics, while reactive control can be optimal for chronic ones. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={In the last decade an increase of the number of red foxes in anthropized habitats across European countries, including Italy, has been observed. This pones implications in terms of disease transmission between wildlife and domestic animals; in fact, there are evidences of the role of foxes as reservoirs and amplifiers of a broad spectrum of parasites infecting pets. The present study evaluated the prevalence of Eucoleus boehmi, an emerging extra-intestinal nematodes of the Capillariinae subfamily, in red foxes. The nasal passages and sinuses of 179 red foxes culled from several areas of northern and central Italy were inspected and the mucosal surfaces were scrapped and examined for adult nematodes and eggs, microscopically and genetically identified. Overall 55 foxes (30.7%) were found to be infected with E. boehmi, i.e. 27 on inspection of the nasal passages and sinuses and 28 on mucosal flush and scraping. The occurrence of E. boehmi was significantly (p < 0.05) correlated to the sampling location, the age and gender of the animals examined; the higher rates of prevalence were observed in animals culled in Piedmont (43.3%) and in female (60.6%) and adult (38.1%) subjects. A total of 184 adult parasites were recovered, with a mean intensity of infection of 3.34, and a more frequent localization of E. boehmi in the nasal passages rather than in the sinuses. A significant (p < 0.05) relationship was found between the parasite burden and body condition and age of the animals; the intensity of infection was significantly higher in juveniles (mean: 6.3 specimens) and in animals showing poor fox body condition (mean: 7.8 specimens).These results show that E. boehmi is highly prevalent in the red fox populations of certain areas of Italy. Epidemiological implications are discussed, with a special focus on the role that this wild canid may have in the increasing transmission of nasal eucoleosis to domestic dogs. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Avian influenza (AI) viruses of the H7 subtype have the potential to evolve into highly pathogenic (HP) viruses that represent a major economic problem for the poultry industry and a threat to global health. However, the emergence of HPAI viruses from low-pathogenic (LPAI) progenitor viruses currently is poorly understood. To investigate the origin and evolution of one of the most important avian influenza epidemics described in Europe, we investigated the evolutionary and spatial dynamics of the entire genome of 109 H7N1 (46 LPAI and 63 HPAI) viruses collected during Italian H7N1 outbreaks between March 1999 and February 2001. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the LPAI and HPAI epidemics shared a single ancestor, that the HPAI strains evolved from the LPAI viruses in the absence of reassortment, and that there was a parallel emergence of mutations among HPAI and later LPAI lineages. Notably, an ultradeep-sequencing analysis demonstrated that some of the amino acid changes characterizing the HPAI virus cluster were already present with low frequency within several individual viral populations from the beginning of the LPAI H7N1 epidemic. A Bayesian phylogeographic analysis revealed stronger spatial structure during the LPAI outbreak, reflecting the more rapid spread of the virus following the emergence of HPAI. The data generated in this study provide the most complete evolutionary and phylogeographic analysis of epidemiologically intertwined high- and low-pathogenicity viruses undertaken to date and highlight the importance of implementing prompt eradication measures against LPAI to prevent the appearance of viruses with fitness advantages and unpredictable pathogenic properties. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.},

abstract={Background: Bovine besnoitiosis, caused by the apicomplexan Besnoitia besnoiti, is a chronic and debilitating disease considered as emerging in Europe. In Spain, Portugal and France it is endemic and foci of infection were recorded in Germany, Switzerland, Hungary, Greece and Italy. In Italy, cases of bovine besnoitiosis were registered both in imported and autochthonous cattle, and mostly in central regions; high seroprevalence was also revealed by an epidemiological survey performed in the southern part of the country. Aiming to update information on the disease in northwestern and insular areas of Italy, where data on bovine besnoitiosis were missing, a serosurvey was designed for the present study. Methods: Three thousand one hundred and forty bovine blood samples from both dairy and beef farms (n = 126) were collected in northwestern regions (Lombardy, Piedmont and Liguria) and in the island of Sardinia. Samples were analyzed by a standardized in-house ELISA and those resulted positive were re-tested by Western Blot (WB) for confirmation. On results obtained by both ELISA and WB, apparent (AP) and true prevalence (TP) were calculated at individual and herd levels. Further, a panel of sera resulted positive to ELISA was analyzed by IFAT. Results: A total of 712 animals (AP = 22.7%; TP = 18.8%) and 109 farms (AP = 86.5%; TP = 88.2%) showed a positive reaction in ELISA. Only ten (AP = 0.3%; TP = 0%) specimens proceeding from five farms (AP = 3.9%; TP = 1.7%) from Lombardy were confirmed positive to the WB, corresponding to two Holstein Friesian cows and eight beef cattle. IFAT showed a low sensitivity (44.4%) scoring positive in only four samples out of 9 positive to WB. Conclusions: The survey demonstrated that bovine besnoitiosis cannot still be considered endemic in whole Italy. In fact, independent foci of infection were registered only in Lombardy region. Therefore, a sanitary strategy aimed to increase control measures and to organize monitoring plans, by adequate diagnostic tools is necessary to avoid overestimation of B. besnoiti in Italy. © 2014 Gazzonis et al.; licensee BioMed Central.},

abstract={The spread of tick-borne pathogens represents an important threat to human and animal health in many parts of Eurasia. Here, we analysed a 9-year time series of Ixodes ricinus ticks feeding on Apodemus flavicollis mice (main reservoir-competent host for tick-borne encephalitis, TBE) sampled in Trentino (Northern Italy). The tail of the distribution of the number of ticks per host was fitted by three theoretical distributions: Negative Binomial (NB), Poisson-LogNormal (PoiLN), and Power-Law (PL). The fit with theoretical distributions indicated that the tail of the tick infestation pattern on mice is better described by the PL distribution. Moreover, we found that the tail of the distribution significantly changes with seasonal variations in host abundance. In order to investigate the effect of different tails of tick distribution on the invasion of a non-systemically transmitted pathogen, we simulated the transmission of a TBE-like virus between susceptible and infective ticks using a stochastic model. Model simulations indicated different outcomes of disease spreading when considering different distribution laws of ticks among hosts. Specifically, we found that the epidemic threshold and the prevalence equilibria obtained in epidemiological simulations with PL distribution are a good approximation of those observed in simulations feed by the empirical distribution. Moreover, we also found that the epidemic threshold for disease invasion was lower when considering the seasonal variation of tick aggregation. © 2014 Ferreri et al.},

Clinical signs of blindness in birds included aimless wandering, failure to find feed and water, lateral recumbency, loss of weight, and increased mortality. The birds lacked papillary reflexes to light, and there were no gross lesions in the eyes. Histologically there was degeneration and disorganization of photoreceptors in the retina. The guinea fowl came from three different breeder sources but all of the birds were given the same feed. The condition was not observed in the subsequent flocks that came from the same breeder sources but that were given different feed. Based on these observations, toxicity of an unknown ingredient in the feed is suspected as the cause of blindness in the guinea fowl. © American Association of Avian Pathologists.},

abstract={M.bovis and M.caprae, members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), are the major causative agents of tuberculosis in domestic animals. Notably, M.bovis exhibits a wide host range; the infection has been reported in many domesticated animals and free or captive wildlife. Despite most of them acting as spill-over hosts in particular epidemiological scenarios, some domesticated species as pigs, camelids and goats may display high rates of infection and possibly play a role in the inter-species transmission of the disease. The aim of this review is to make an updated overview of the susceptibility and the role in the transmission of the disease of the most common domesticated animals species such as small ruminants, pigs, horses, camelids, dogs and cats.

abstract={Genetic typing of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) has distinguished BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 species and an emerging putative third species (HoBi-like virus), recently detected in southern Italy, signaling the occurrence of natural infection in Europe. Recognizing the need to update the data on BVDV genetic variability in Italy for mounting local and European alerts, a wide collection of 5 ′ UTR sequences (n = 371) was selected to identify the frequency of genotypes and subtypes at the herd level. BVDV-1 had the highest frequency, followed by sporadic BVDV-2. No novel HoBi-like viruses were identified. Four distribution patterns of BVDV-1 subtypes were observed: highly prevalent subtypes with a wide temporal-spatial distribution (1b and 1e), low prevalent subtypes with a widespread geographic distribution (1a, 1d, 1g, 1h, and 1k) or a restricted geographic distribution (1f), and sporadic subtypes detected only in single herds (1c, 1j, and 1l). BVDV-1c, k, and l are reported for the first time in Italy. A unique genetic variant was detected in the majority of herds, but cocirculation of genetic variants was also observed. Northern Italy ranked first for BVDV introduction, prevalence, and dispersion. Nevertheless, the presence of sporadic variants in other restricted areas suggests the risk of different routes of BVDV introduction. © 2014 Camilla Luzzago et al.},

abstract={Objectives: To examine cross-reactivity between hemagglutinin (HA) derived from A/California/7/09 (CA/09) virus and that derived from representative Eurasian "avian-like" (EA) H1N1 swine viruses isolated in Italy between 1999 and 2008 during virological surveillance in pigs. Design: Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) expressing the HA gene of CA/09 virus (MVA-HA-CA/09) was used as a vaccine to investigate cross-protective immunity against H1N1 swine viruses in mice. Sample: Two classical swine H1N1 (CS) viruses and four representative EA-like H1N1 swine viruses previously isolated during outbreaks of respiratory disease in pigs on farms in Northern Italy were used in this study. Setting: Female C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated with MVA/HA/CA/09 and then challenged intranasally with H1N1 swine viruses. Main outcome measures: Cross-reactive antibody responses were determined by hemagglutination- inhibition (HI) and virus microneutralizing (MN) assays of sera from MVA-vaccinated mice. The extent of protective immunity against infection with H1N1 swine viruses was determined by measuring lung viral load on days 2 and 4 post-challenge. Results and Conclusions: Systemic immunization of mice with CA/09-derived HA, vectored by MVA, elicited cross-protective immunity against recent EA-like swine viruses. This immune protection was related to the levels of cross-reactive HI antibodies in the sera of the immunized mice and was dependent on the similarity of the antigenic site Sa of H1 HAs. Our findings suggest that the herd immunity elicited in humans by the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus could limit the transmission of recent EA-like swine HA genes into the influenza A virus gene pool in humans. © 2013 The Authors Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={European brown hare syndrome virus (EBHSV) is the aetiological agent of European brown hare syndrome (EBHS), a disease affecting Lepus europaeus and Lepus timidus first diagnosed in Sweden in 1980. To characterize EBHSV evolution we studied hare samples collected in Sweden between 1982 and 2008. Our molecular clock dating is compatible with EBHSV emergence in the 1970s. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two lineages: Group A persisted until 1989 when it apparently suffered extinction; Group B emerged in the mid-1980s and contains the most recent strains. Antigenic differences exist between groups, with loss of reactivity of some MAbs over time, which are associated with amino acid substitutions in recognized epitopes. A role for immune selection is also supported by the presence of positively selected codons in exposed regions of the capsid. Hence, EBHSV evolution is characterized by replacement of Group A by Group B viruses, suggesting that the latter possess a selective advantage. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Objectives: An epidemiological survey was carried out in order to obtain a better understanding of the role of wild boars in the epidemiology of the influenza virus. Design: The samples were submitted to Real-Time PCR testing for gene M of the swine influenza virus (SIV), and virus isolation was performed from the positive PCR samples. Genome sequence analysis was performed on the isolates. Additionally, 1,977 boar sera samples were analyzed using ELISA and hemoagglutination inhibition. Setting: Over recent years, the wild boar population has greatly increased in Italy, including in areas of high-density industrial pig farming, where the influenza virus is widespread. From July to December 2012, wild boar lung samples were collected in the Parma and Piacenza area, in the Emilia Romagna region. Sample: 354 wild boar lung samples were collected. Main outcome measures: Wild-boar influenza A virus infection should be studied more broadly in order to obtain a better understanding of the epidemiological role played by this species. Results: Three SIV strains were isolated out of 12 samples that resulted positive using PCR analysis and they were identified as avian-like SIV subtype H1N1. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences obtained from isolate A/wild boar/291320/2012 showed that it clustered with recent Italian avian-like H1N1 SIVs isolated from domestic pigs. Sixty-eight sera samples showed a positive titer to the isolate A/wild boar/291320/2012. Conclusions: This study suggests that SIV actively circulates in the wild boar population in the investigated. area. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Introduction - Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus are the main fungi responsible for Aflatoxin (AF) production. To provide an adequate margin of safety to protect human and animal health European Commission (EC) established maximum levels for AFs presence in food and feed (Commission Regulation N° 1881/2006). The limit for AFM1 in milk is fixed at 0,050 μg/kg (50 ppt); in Lombardy Region a more restrictive limit has been fixed at 0,030 μg/kg (30 ppt) for raw milk for direct sale (CIR/19/SAN 2007 Lombardia). The impact of climatic conditions has been identified as an emerging issue for food and feed safety. In summer 2012 an alert was launched because of AF feed contamination due to drought conditions. The surveillance performed on milk was increased in order to assess the risk for consumers and to warrant food safety. The aim of this paper is to present the results of AFM1 detection in milk samples collected by producers or dairy industries for own-check purposes in Lombardy Region from August 2012 to February 2013. Material - Commercial ELISA kit "I'screen Afla M1" (TECNA S.r.l., I) was used for screening AFM1 concentration in 4.977 bulk tank milk samples; among them, about 400 samples originated from official control of raw milk for direct sale. Results - From August 2012 to February 2013, tolerance level of 50 ppt was exceeded in 2,2 to 23,3% of the samples: the higher AFM1 value was found in September; the tolerance level of 30 ppt in raw milk for direct sale was exceeded in 3,5 to 35,5% of the samples with the higher value in October. Conclusions - The monitoring of the AFM1 in bulk tank milk through a rapid screening method, mainly during critic period of the year, is able to describe the dynamic trend of AFM1 contamination, giving useful information to support the decision making actions, for example monitoring of effects of changes in bovine diet at single farm level.},

abstract={Introduction - Bovine mastitis is a major cause of economic losses in the dairy sector and Staphylococcus aureus represents the most prevalent and contagious aetiologic agent, resulting responsible for about one-third of clinical and subclinical mastitis worldwide. ®-lactams, lincosamides and macrolides are among the most recommended antimicrobial agents for treating mastitis and increasing level of acquired resistance to penicillin G, lincomycin, erythromycin, gentamycin and streptomycin has been reported. Therefore, antimicrobial susceptibility tests are important for the selection of the most appropriate antimicrobial agent for treatment of bovine mastitis caused by S. aureus. Aim - The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance rates and the trend in resistance of S. aureus strains isolated from bovine with clinical or sub-clinical mastitis in Italy from 2005 to 2011. Materials and methods - A total of 1,200 S. aureus isolates recovered from milk samples from bovine with clinical or sub-clinical mastitis were collected from 2005 to 2011 at the Diagnostic Sections of Piacenza of the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by the disk diffusion method. Results and discussion - High resistance rates were observed mostly for penicillin G, erythromycin and lincomycin, while a high in vitro activity was showed by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and cefquinome, confirming these antimicrobial agents as an alternative choice for the treatment of bovine mastitis. Resistance showed a significant increasing trend for cephalotin, cefquinome, enrofloxacin, lincomycin, nafcillin, oxacillin and tetracycline, while resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefoperazone, erythromycin, penicillin G and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole did not change significantly over the study period. Conclusions - Periodic surveillance for antimicrobial resistance of S. aureus isolated from dairy cows with mastitis is strongly recommended as an important component of prudent antimicrobial use practices.},

abstract={Herpesviral infections frequently occur in horses. The objective of this study was to investigate the possible association of equine herpesviruses (EHV-1, EHV-2, EHV-3, EHV-4, EHV-5) with other causes of abortion, neonatal mortality or placental disorder. Sixty-seven abortions, 22 stillbirths, 14 cases of neonatal foal mortality and 3 cases of placental disease were investigated for infectious and non-infectious causes. Type-specific nested PCR assays and virus isolation were performed to detect EHV infections. A cause of fetal loss or placental disease was reached in 68 out 116 (58.7 %) cases. Twenty-seven cases were positive for EHV, and 22/27 (81.5 %) were positive for EHV-1 (16 neuropathogenic and 6 non-neuropathogenic strains), 4 (14.8 %) for EHV-2 and 3 (11.1 %) for EHV-5. The association between EHV infections and other etiological agents was statistically significant (two sided P = 0.002). The odds ratio of EHV DNA associated with other diagnoses, especially with bacterial infection and premature placental separation, was 10.88 (95 % confidence interval: 2.15-55.16). EHV-1 was the main viral cause of pregnancy loss in this study, also associated with other etiological agents, including EHV-2 and EHV-5. The latter viruses in particular need to be more fully investigated to elucidate what role either or both may play as co-infecting agents with other established infectious causes of reproductive disease. © 2013 European Union.},

abstract={European H1N2 swine influenza viruses (EU H1N2SIVs) arose from multiple reassortment events among human H1N1, human H3N2, and avian influenza viruses. We investigated the evolutionary dynamics of 53 Italian H1N2 strains by comparing them with EU H1N2 SIVs. Hemagglutinin (HA) phylogeny revealed Italian strains fell into four groups: Group A and B (41 strains) had a human H1 similar to EU H1N2SIVs, which probably originated in 1986. However Group B (38 strains) formed a subgroup that had a two-amino acid deletion at positions 146/147 in HA. Group C (11 strains) contained an avian H1 that probably originated in 1996, and Group D (1 strain) had an H1 characteristic of the 2009 pandemic strain. Neuraminidase (NA) phylogeny suggested a series of genomic reassortments had occurred. Group A had an N2 that originated from human H3N2 in the late 1970s. Group B had different human N2 that most likely arose from a reassortment with the more recent human H3N2 virus, which probably occurred in 2000. Group C had an avian-like H1 combined with an N2 gene from one of EU H1N2SIVs, EU H3N2SIVs or Human H3N2. Group D was part of the EU H3N2SIVs clade. Although selection pressure for HA and NA was low, several positively selected sites were identified in both proteins, some of which were antigenic, suggesting selection influenced the evolution of SIV. The data highlight different evolutionary trends between European viruses and currently circulating Italian B strains and show the establishment of reassortant strains involving human viruses in Italian pigs. © 2013 Moreno et al.},

Five batches of bovine meat were collected. Samples were treated with EOW, vacuum-packed and analysed to determine the mesophilic microbial load, count of Enterobacteriaceae, lactic acid bacteria, Brocholhrix thermosphacta and Pseudomonas spp. during 20 days of storage at different temperatures (4°, 8°, 12°C). Comparison between data obtained from the analysis of untreated and treated samples showed no significant difference in the samples analysed immediately after treatment and during storage. Treatment by immersion of bovine meat cuts for 45 seconds in EOW has shown to be ineffective in reducing contamination by the bacteria more frequently involved in meat spoilage.},

Some extra European Union (EU) countries request importation of MAP-free products. Italy has not yet actualised a control programme and the diffusion of the infection is still unknown in Southern Italy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of the infection in five regions of Southern Italy. Bulk tank milk and in-line milk filters were sampled in 780 dairy cattle herds and respectively analysed by ELISA and real time-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). One hundred and 55 out of 780 herds (19.9%) were found positive by ELISA and/or real time PCR. Individual milk samples were then collected from all the producing animals of positive herds and from a selection of negative herds. The estimated prevalence varies from region to region between 2.8 and 5.5%. Our results indicate that the disease is widespread in the five regions. The observed prevalence could be underestimated. © G. Marchetti et al., 2013.},

abstract={The effects of early weaning on the performances and molecular ontogeny of digestive enzyme precursors in common sole (Solea solea) larvae were studied. Four experimental weaning time protocols (WPs) were performed in triplicate. One protocol was used for the control group where larvae were fed live feed until 27. days post-hatching (dph) (WP-27) and weaned with dry feed. The other groups provided only with dry feed (WP-4), live feed until 13. dph (WP-13) and live feed until 18. dph (WP-18), followed by weaning on to the same commercial microdiet (MD) used in the WP-27 group (AgloNorse K/S Tromsø Fiskeindustry A/S & Co., Norway). The trial lasted until 33. dph. The larvae of the WP-4 group displayed a significantly lower survival rate, lower growth increase and a delay in the onset of metamorphosis when compared with the other groups. The WP-13 and WP-18 groups displayed significantly lower weight increases when compared with the WP-27 group, whereas metamorphosis development and survival were not influenced. Partial transcripts of trypsinogen 1 (tryp1), trypsinogen 3 (tryp3), trypsinogen Y (trypY), chymotrypsinogen (chymt), amylase (amy) and hepatic lipase (HL) were cloned and analysed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The tryp1 and chymt mRNA levels displayed a rapid increase in all the treatments between 4 and 8. dph and thereafter displayed a homogeneous fluctuating pattern with a higher increasing tendency for chymt at the end of the trial. The amount of tryp3 and trypY mRNA remained stable or slightly increased until 27. dph in all WP groups and thereafter displayed a general up-regulation trend. The amy transcript levels displayed a gradual increase throughout the study in all WP groups. The HL mRNA levels increased until 13. dph in the WP-27, WP-18 and WP-13 groups and thereafter remained generally stable until 27. dph, whereas in the WP-4 group, there was a linear time-related increasing trend until the end of the trial. This study supports previous results on the feasibility of early weaning of common sole larvae using a MD before the end of metamorphosis. The molecular ontogeny of some important digestive enzyme precursors is described for the first time in this species. The transcripts analysed were not greatly influenced by the WPs. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Lower thresholds (tL) for development were estimated from the linear regression of the developmental rates on each temperature. These data have made it possible to calculate the accumulated degree days (ADD) necessary for C. vicina to complete the larval stage and to achieve adult emergence. The minimal duration of development from oviposition to adult emergence was found to be inversely related to temperature. Additionally, six landmarks in pupal development are showed, and for each of the landmarks, the ADD value was calculated for every rearing temperature involved. These data assist in calculating the duration of the pupal stage based on morphological characteristics and would be of great value for future forensic entomological casework. © 2013 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.},

abstract={Mosquito-borne arboviruses (MBV) represent an important health problem, causing diseases and deaths both in human and animals mainly in tropical and subtropical countries. In recent years, they have emerged also in temperate regions where they have caused epidemics. Of mounting concern among public health authorities in Europe are zoonotic mosquito-borne viruses belonging to the Flavivirus genus. The aim of this study was to carry out active surveillance on mosquitoes in two regions of northwestern Italy (Liguria and Piedmont) to gain a better knowledge of the mosquito populations by identifying potential vectors of arboviruses and to investigate arbovirus infection. A network of 61 CO2 CDC traps was placed in the study area; sampling was conducted from May to October 2011. A total of 46 677 mosquitoes was collected, identified to species level, and classified according to their vector competence. Mosquitoes collected from 16 traps, selected according to risk-based factors, were tested by biomolecular analysis to detect flavivirus infection. This study highlights the importance of entomological surveillance in northwestern Italy because most of the mosquitoes collected were found to have high vector competence. Moreover, the risk-based virological surveillance allowed to detect the presence of mosquito flavivirus RNA, phylogenetically closely related to the MMV Spanish isolate, in three pools and USUV RNA in one pool in new areas where it has not been reported previously. The availability of continuous data on mosquito populations provides invaluable information for use in cases of an epidemic emergency. Maintenance of this integrated system for the next years will provide stronger data that can inform the design of a risk-based surveillance for the early detection of the occurrence of outbreaks of tropical MBDs. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

Sixty-nine faecal samples and 126 carcasses were tested using pan-coronavirus RT-PCR. Coronavirus RNAs were detected in seven faecal samples and nine carcasses. A phylogenetic analysis of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence fragments aided in identifying two alphacoronaviruses from Kuhl's pipistrelle (Pipistrellus kuhlii), three clade 2b betacoronaviruses from lesser horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus hipposideros), and 10 clade 2c betacoronaviruses from Kuhl's pipistrelle, common noctule (Nyctalus noctula), and Savi's pipistrelle (Hypsugo savii). This study fills a substantive gap in the knowledge on bat-CoV ecology in Italy, and extends the current knowledge on clade 2c betacoronaviruses with new sequences obtained from bats that have not been previously described as hosts of these viruses. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The study was aimed at obtaining data regarding the prevalence of Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus type 2 (BVDV-2) in dairy cattle population of the Po Valley, Northern Italy. The survey was carried out in the period 2009-2011 and involved five diagnostic laboratories located in five provinces of Lombardia and Emilia Romagna regions, namely Brescia, Cremona, Lodi, Mantova e Parma. The area is characterized for a high density of bovine dairy herds, even large herds rearing animals with high genetic value. Despite of the lack of official control-eradication programmes by Authorities, the consciousness about BVD damages is widespread among practitioners and dairy farmers. Therefore, voluntary control-eradication programmes to BVDV are set up on herd level. The programmes, besides the vaccination practice, provided for detection and cull of persistently infected (PI) animals. Bulk milk, blood samples, aborted foetuses and specimens from organs of cattle died for suspected BVD were examined by PCR or real-time PCR to detect BVDV-1 and 2. In addition blood serum samples from BVDV unvaccinated herds were submitted to comparative serology through serum neutralization test (SN) to both the viral types. On the whole 4,464 dairy herds were submitted to diagnostic investigation. Direct diagnostic tests (PCR or real-time PCR) allowed BVDV-2 to be detected in 2.9% of the examined herds. Indirect diagnostic test (comparative SN) showed 4% of the tested herds positive for BVDV-2 infection. Sometimes both the viral types were present together in a single herd. Taken together our data pointed out that BVDV-2, introduced in Italy in 1999 by a contaminated vaccine, at present circulates among the considered cattle population but the prevalence is low. So that BVDV-1 must be considered the most relevant viral type circulating among the domestic dairy cattle population. This evidence is consistent with the epidemiological situation of other European Countries but in contrast with the US picture where BVDV-2 infection is widespread in dairy and beef cattle. The reason of this epidemiological disagreement is not yet elucidated.},

abstract={A tuberculosis (TB) outbreak caused by Mycobacterium bovis occurred in a mixed herd of three cattle and eighteen goats in Northern Italy in 2005. All the cattle were removed, as opposed to the co-existing goats, who remained in the farm and were not subsequently tested by the official intradermal tuberculin test. At the beginning of May 2006, a 7-day old calf was introduced into the herd from an officially TB-free (OTF) farm. On October 2006, tuberculous lesions were detected at the slaughterhouse in the same animal. The following epidemiological investigation on the herd highlighted a clinical suspicion of TB in one goat out of 35, and visible lesions were found at necropsy in the respiratory and intestinal tracts. Bacteriological culture and molecular tests confirmed the presence of M. bovis in both animals. Spoligotyping and Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Units - Variable Number of Tandem Repeats (MIRU-VNTR) showed the same genomic profile of the previous breakdown occurred in 2005. Since this profile has never been described in Italy, these findings suggest the probable transmission of TB within the farm among cattle and goats. The remaining 34 goats were also tested by single intradermal cervical comparative tuberculin (SICCT) test, Interferon (IFN)-γ assay and ELISA for antibody to M. bovis. The SICCT test and the IFN-γ showed a good concordance with 20 and 19 positive reactors, respectively. By ELISA we found 12. Ab-positive animals, seven of which had not been detected by the tests for cell-mediated immunity. Finally, 15 goats were found positive for gross lesions at necropsy. The in vivo tests revealed a total of 27 positive animals out of 35, which highlights the usefulness of the serology in parallel with SICCT and IFN-γ when an advanced stage of infection is suspected. Moreover, our results confirm the necessity for adopting the official tuberculin test on goats co-existing with cattle. © 2013.},

abstract={Mycoplasma bovis is an important cause of bovine respiratory disease, especially in young calves where it can also cause arthritis, tenosynovitis and otitis. During 2009 and 2010 a survey was carried out on carcasses of calves less than one month old sent to the Diagnostic Laboratory of the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna in Brescia, regardless of the presence of lung lesions, to detect this pathogen. PCR tests for Mycoplasma spp. and M. bovis were applied. 83 out of 224 (37%) lung tissue samples examined were positive at PCR test for Mycoplasma spp.; in 64 cases of these we observed typical respiratory lesions (P< 0.001). M. bovis was identified in 26 out of 83 (31%) lung tissue samples positive at PCR test for Mycoplasma spp.; in 24 cases of these we observed typical respiratory lesions (P= 0.039). Our data demonstrate that presence of Mycoplasma spp. and M. bovis positively correlates with pneumonic lung lesions in young dairy calves. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Interferon-alpha (IFN-α) shows potent immunomodulatory properties, which underlies its use for low-dose oral treatments of diverse viral infections and immunopathological conditions. The studies on oral administration have been hampered by the lack of recognized in vitro models, reproducing the in vivo control action of IFN-α over inflammatory cytokine responses. Owing to these reasons, the aim of our study was to validate IPEC-J2 (a continuous cell line of porcine intestinal epithelial cells) as a reporter system of the properties of IFN-α. Three different experimental conditions (oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and amplification of lymphoid cell signals) were selected to evaluate the effects of porcine recombinant IFN-α1 (rIFN-α) and 2 natural porcine IFN-α preparations (nIFN-α). The IFNs under study showed significantly different control actions in IPEC-J2 cells. In particular, rIFN-α was shown to down-regulate interleukin (IL)-8, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and β-defensin 1 genes either directly, or indirectly through second messengers released by IFN-α-treated lymphoid cells. With regard to IL-6, only second messengers from IFN-α-treated lymphoid cells could regulate the expression of this cytokine. Our results suggest that IPEC-J2 cells can be a useful tool for investigating the regulatory actions of type I IFNs and the second messengers thereof. The results provided by this model could be conveniently exploited in studies on enteric diseases sustained by infectious or noninfectious stressors. © 2013 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract={Zoonotic infections with hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotype 3 are presumably transmitted via contaminated pig meat products, which raises the necessity for enhanced serological surveillance of pig herds. The aim of the study was to set up a novel protein expression system to overcome the well-known problems in (HEV-) protein expression using the standard Escherichia coli tools such as inclusion body formation and loss of protein conformation. A recombinant strain of the protozoan organism Leishmania tarentolae (L. tarentolae) was therefore established. A fragment of HEV ORF2 coding for a truncated capsid protein of a porcine HEV strain was cloned and parts of the plasmid DNA were introduced into the Leishmania genome, resulting in stably transformed cells. Via a C-terminal His-tag the recombinant HEVδORF2 protein could be purified and concentrated directly from the medium, resulting in a total protein amount of approximately 1.4. mg/l Leishmania culture. The recombinant protein was coated on ELISA plates and was proven to be highly reactive and well-suited to be applied in a serological assay. By investigating 144 porcine sera, the in-house assay detected specific antibodies in 43.1% of the samples and demonstrated a higher sensitivity than a commercially available antibody test. Taken together, it was shown that L. tarentolae exhibits a remarkable alternative expression strategy for viral antigens with considerable advantages of a eukaryotic protein expression host. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Since summer 2010, numerous cases of Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD) have been reported in north-western France both in rabbitries, affecting RHD-vaccinated rabbits, and in wild populations. We demonstrate that the aetiological agent was a lagovirus phylogenetically distinct from other lagoviruses and which presents a unique antigenic profile. Experimental results show that the disease differs from RHD in terms of disease duration, mortality rates, higher occurrence of subacute/chronic forms and that partial cross-protection occurs between RHDV and the new RHDV variant, designated RHDV2. These data support the hypothesis that RHDV2 is a new member of the Lagovirus genus. A molecular epidemiology study detected RHDV2 in France a few months before the first recorded cases and revealed that one year after its discovery it had spread throughout the country and had almost replaced RHDV strains. RHDV2 was detected in continental Italy in June 2011, then four months later in Sardinia. © 2013 Le Gall-Reculé et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

PV particles were first observed by electron microscopy and PV DNA was then identified by PCR using degenerate primers. Subsequently we cloned the entire genome and determined its complete sequence. CePV1 genome is 8009. bp long and contains all 9 ORFs and the long untranslated regulatory region characteristic for Delta-papillomaviruses. Pairwise nucleotide alignments and phylogenetic analyses based on concatenated E1-E2-L1 ORFs allowed to determine the highest similarity with the Capreolus caprelus papillomavirus CcaPV1. The analysis of the host-parasite phylogenetic tree interactions suggest the co-divergence of CePV1 and C. elaphus while the identified topological incongruences leading us to speculate that CcaPV1 could eventually be the result of an earlier host switch event. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We randomly allocated 150 broiler chickens within 5 poultry isolators (30 birds each). Dietary treatments consisted of a basal diet (C) composed of corn [575 g/kg on dry matter (DM)] and soybean meal (100 g/kg DM), barley bran (220 g/kg DM), corn gluten feed (30 g/kg DM), soybean oil (25 g/kg DM), vitamin mineral premix (49.5 g/kg DM), and four other diets obtained by adding chestnut tannin extract (1.5, 3, 5, and 12 g/kg during week 1, 10.0 g/kg during week 2, and 8.0 g/kg during the last two weeks, respectively) to C. At the age of 20 days, 15 birds/group were euthanised and individually examined for the level of gut infection by counting Clostridium perfringens and macroscopic gut lesions. Results demonstrated that chestnut tannin gave significant results even at low concentration levels in the feed (1.5 to 3.0 g/kg), but was actually efficient in controlling necrotic enteritis at levels ≥5.0 g/kg. The treatment (12.0 g/kg during the first week and 8.0 g/kg during the last two weeks of age) resulted very efficient in controlling the proliferation of Clostridium perfringens and in reducing the severity of gut damage compared to the untreated infected group. © G.

Resistance to challenge with the fully virulent strain S. Typhimurium ATCC 14028 was assessed in animals vaccinated with S. Typhimurium δznuABC (two dosages tested), in controls vaccinated with a formalin-inactivated virulent strain and in unvaccinated controls. Clinical signs of salmonellosis, faecal shedding and bacterial colonization of organs were used to assess vaccine-induced protection. After the challenge, pigs vaccinated with the attenuated S. Typhimurium δznuABC strain did not display clinical signs of salmonellosis (fever or diarrhoea). The vaccine also reduced intestinal tract colonization and faecal shedding of the fully virulent Salmonella strain, as compared to control groups. S. Typhimurium δznuABC represents a promising candidate vaccine against salmonellosis in pigs. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Introduction - Every year Italy imports from France more than 850,000 young beef cattle reared at pasture, called "broutard", for fattening in specialized farms. The main health losses in these farms are due to "bovine respiratory disease complex" (BRDC), involving animals generally in the first weeks of the production cycle. BRDC is a multifactorial disease where a great number of risk factors, able to decrease defensive capacity of the animals and increase exposure to pathogens, play a major role. Aim - The purpose of this study was to evaluate, through surveys on blood samples taken from calves prior to export from France, some of the factors that can affect the immune defenses of the animals. Materials and methods - We studied the amount of copper and zinc in serum, the activity of the erythrocyte GSHPx, the amount of total thyroxine (T4), the rate of hemoglobin, the amount of total protein and gamma-globulin, the presence of antibodies against BHV1 and BRSV and the presence of animals viremic with BVDV. 293 calves from 12 Departments and 8 Regions of France were included in the study. Results and discussion - Animals with values below the reference values were 80.5% for copper, 76.2% for zinc, 78.1% for GSH-PXE, 30.7% for hemoglobin and 78.8% for gamma- globulins. Normal values were found for T4 and total serum protein. Only 3.1% of the subjects were positive for antibodies against BHV1. For BRSV, 23.9% of the samples were seropositive. No calf was identified as viremic with BVDV. Conclusions - During this study, a copper, zinc and selenium deficiency was found in most of the subjects tested. According to these data, a specific supplementation of the diet of beef cattle kept on pasture in France is advisable. The high number of seronegative calves for BHV1 and BRSV suggests the application of an adequate isolation of the animals upon arrival in the fattening units and their rapid immunization against these two viruses.},

abstract={This paper reports a simple and reliable mass spectrometry hyphenated chromatographic method for ochratoxin A determination in hard cheese. The method is based on a simple extraction using an acetonitrile:water (84:16, v/v) solution acidified with 2.5% acetic acid. After a defatting step with n-hexane, the extract was directly analysed by LC-MS/MS without any further clean-up step. The method showed good linearity and specificity, and it was in-house validated in the range of 1-16 μg/kg, resulting in 93.75% mean overall recovery (confidence interval 1.36%) and 3.42% coefficient of variatioin (CV). The analytical performances were also satisfactory in terms of sensitivity (limit of quantification = 1 μg/kg); although no legal limits have been set up for cheese, this value is consistent with the tolerances fixed for other regulated foods. Preliminary results on 40 commercial samples of grated hard cheese are presented. © 2013 Informa UK, Ltd.},

abstract={Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus that re-emerged in 2004 and has caused massive outbreaks in recent years. The lack of a licensed vaccine or treatment options emphasize the need to obtain more insight into the viral life cycle and CHIKV-host interactions. Infectious cDNA clones are important tools for such studies, and for mechanism of action studies on antiviral compounds. Existing CHIKV cDNA clones are based on a single genome from an individual clinical isolate, which is expected to have evolved specific characteristics in response to the host environment, and possibly also during subsequent cell culture passaging. To obtain a virus expected to have the general characteristics of the recent E1-226V CHIKV isolates, we have constructed a new CHIKV full-length cDNA clone, CHIKV LS3, based on the consensus sequence of their aligned genomes. Here we report the characterization of this synthetic virus and a green fluorescent protein-expressing variant (CHIKV LS3-GFP). Their characteristics were compared to those of natural strain ITA07-RA1, which was isolated during the 2007 outbreak in Italy. In cell culture the synthetic viruses displayed phenotypes comparable to the natural isolate, and in a mouse model they caused lethal infections that were indistinguishable from infections with a natural strain. Compared to ITA07-RA1 and clinical isolate NL10/152, the synthetic viruses displayed similar sensitivities to several antiviral compounds. 3-deaza-adenosine was identified as a new inhibitor of CHIKV replication. Cyclosporin A had no effect on CHIKV replication, suggesting that cyclophilins -opposite to what was found for other +RNA viruses- do not play an essential role in CHIKV replication. The characterization of the consensus sequence-based synthetic viruses and their comparison to natural isolates demonstrated that CHIKV LS3 and LS3-GFP are suitable and representative tools to study CHIKV-host interactions, screen for antiviral compounds and unravel their mode of action. © 2013 Scholte et al.},

abstract={This report describes the clinicopathological features of a case of diffuse scaling dermatitis that occurred in a 16-week-old female athymic nude (CrTac:NCr-Foxn1nu) mouse. Gross presentation was suggestive of Corynebacterium bovis infection (scaly skin disease). However, C. bovis was not isolated from the skin of the affected animal or from the skin of unaffected CrTac:NCr-Foxn1nu mice housed in the same cage or room. Staphylococcus xylosus was instead isolated in high numbers from the skin lesion, whereas only a few colonies were recovered from the skin of unaffected mice. Microscopically, the affected skin was characterized by chronic hyperplastic and hyperkeratotic dermatitis with focal ulcerations, extensive serocellular crusts, and intralesional clusters of Gram-positive coccoid bacteria. Although gross presentation of the reported case was suggestive of C. bovis infection, epidemiological, histopathological, and bacteriological findings definitively ruled out an outbreak of scaly skin disease. A diagnostic hypothesis of hyperplastic and hyperkeratotic dermatitis associated with opportunistic S. xylosus infection was formulated based on increased bacterial burden and presence of intralesional Gram-positive coccoid bacteria. © The Author(s) 2012.},

abstract={The use of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) in orthopedic practice has recently and rapidly acquired an important role. Therapies based on the use of MSCs for the treatment of acute injuries as well as chronic inflammatory disorders are gradually becoming clinical routine. These cells have demonstrated intriguing therapeutic potentialities (i.e.: inflammation control, tissue regeneration and pathological scar prevention), that have been taken into consideration for use in both human and veterinary medicine. In particular, horses represent high performance athletes considered models for human pathologies since musculo-skeletal disorders frequently occur in this species. In the past, repair of tendon injures were performed by different methods. In particular, clinical therapy was based on ice application, bandage, box rest and controlled exercise. An alternative approach consisted on the use of corticosteroid (inflammation reduction) and other drugs (sodium hyaluronate, polysulphated glycosaminoglycans, beta aminoproprionitrile fumarate). Furthermore, surgical treatments like accessory ligament desmotomy, local irritation by line firing or pin firing were commonly used. More recently ultrasound, laser therapy, electromagnetic field therapy have been considered. Unfortunately, they did not allow complete tissue healing and quite often animals did not regain competitiveness. In order to minimize this inconvenience, the use of MSCs has been introduced as an alternative to the traditional approach since it represents a potential tool to improve tissue regeneration.Aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of MSCs to improve the functional outcome of horses affected by tendonitis and desmitis. Thirty-three breed and activity-matched horses affected by tendonitis or desmitis, were included in clinical trial scored for lesions and subdivided into two groups. Group 1 animals were treated with autologous MSCs, associated with platelet rich plasma (group 1). Bone marrow samples were collected from the sternum of the treated horses and processed in order to isolate MSCs. Following cell therapy, they were subjected to a rehabilitation period and their ability to resume training was evaluated. In this study, implanted MSCs caused no adverse reactions and thirteen out of the eighteen inoculated horses returned to race competitions. On the contrary, no improvement was seen in the twelve animals of group 2 treated with pin firing, that were not able to resume sport activity. In conclusion the clinical trial proves the safety of equine bone-marrow derived MSCs and a successful outcome of the treated animals that returned to their previous level of sport activity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Swine influenza virus (SwIV) is considered a zoonosis and the fact that swine may act as an intermediate reservoir for avian influenza virus, potentially infectious for humans, highlights its relevance and the need to understand the interaction of different influenza viruses with the porcine immune system. Thus, in vitro porcine bone marrow-derived dendritic cell (poBMDCs) were infected with a circulating SwIV A/Swine/Spain/SF32071/2007(H3N2), 2009 human pandemic influenza virus A/Catalonia/63/2009(H1N1), low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) A/Anas plathyrhynchos/Spain/1877/2009(aH7N2) or high pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) A/Chicken/Italy/5093/1999(aH7N1). Swine influenza virus H3N2 infection induced an increase of SLA-I and CD80/86 at 16 and 24. h post infection (hpi), whereas the other viruses did not. All viruses induced gene expression of NF-κB, TGF- β, IFN-β and IL-10 at the mRNA level in swine poBMDCs to different extents and in a time-dependent manner. All viruses induced the secretion of IL-12 mostly at 24. hpi whereas IL-18 was detected at all tested times. Only swH3N2 induced IFN-α in a time-dependent manner. Swine H3N2, aH7N2 and aH7N1 induced secretion of TNF-α also in a time-dependent manner. Inhibition of NF-κB resulted in a decrease of IFN-α and IL-12 secretion by swH3N2-infected poBMDC at 24. hpi, suggesting a role of this transcription factor in the synthesis of these cytokines. Altogether, these data might help in understanding the relationship between influenza viruses and porcine dendritic cells in the innate immune response in swine controlled through soluble mediators and transcription factors. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={West Nile virus (WNV) is one of the most serious public health threats that Europe and the Mediterranean countries are currently facing. In Italy, WNV emerged in 1998 and has been circulating since 2008. To tackle its continuous incursions, Italian national and regional institutions set up a surveillance program, which includes the serological screening of sentinel horses, sentinel-chickens and backyard poultry flocks and the surveillance on all equine neurological cases, resident captured and wild dead birds, and vectors. This communication aims to assess the importance of the entomological surveillance program as an early warning system for WNV circulation. In the province of Modena, the circulation of WNV lineage 2 strains was first detected in pools of Culex pipiens on July the 3 rd , 42 days prior to the onset of the first 2013 human WNV neuroinvasive case reported in the same province. Similarly in Veneto, WNV was first detected on July 3 rd in a pool of Cx. pipiens collected in the province of Venezia. The first human neuroinvasive case in this region occurred in the Rovigo province on July the 24 th , seven days after the detection of WNV lineage 2 in a mosquito pool collected in the same province. Up to the end of July 2013, WNV circulation was further detected in several other pools of Cx. pipiens mosquitoes collected in Emilia-Romagna, Veneto and Lombardia. According to the NS3 partial sequence alignments including all recent European and Italian Lineage 2 strains, the new circulating WNV lineage 2 strains share high nt homology with the Hungarian and with the previous lineage 2 strains isolated in Veneto and Sardegna in 2011 and 2012. These data provide a clear and practical demonstration of the relevance of a reliable entomological surveillance program to early detect WNV in Italy.},

abstract={Meat contamination by Salmonella spp. is emerging as a major cause of human enteric infections in industrialized countries. The attempts to reduce human cases of salmonellosis encompass pre- and post-harvest interventions. In this context, vaccination of pigs may represent an effective instrument in eliminating/reducing Salmonella burden through the food chain. We have previously demonstrated that Salmonella Typhimurium lacking the ZnuABC transporter (. S. Typhimurium δ. znuABC) is a promising candidate live vaccine in different mouse models of Salmonella Typhimurium infection. In this study, we confirmed in pigs the attenuation of S. Typhimurium δ. znuABC. Moreover, we evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of S. Typhimurium δ. znuABC administered to pigs by the oral route. We monitored clinical conditions of animals and we conducted a microbiological culture and a quantification of the humoral and cellular immune response, respectively, on fecal and blood samples of pigs. After vaccination with attenuated S. Typhimurium δ. znuABC, pigs showed a modest degree of hyperthermia. In addition, fecal shedding of S. Typhimurium δ. znuABC could not be detected 28 days after the inoculum. Furthermore, vaccination with S. Typhimurium δz. nuABC elicited a distinct production of anti-.

abstract={Major discrepancies are observed between experimental trials of PRRS-virus (PRRSV) infection in isolation facilities and observations made in the field on farm. Owing to the above, a cohort study was carried out in a farrow-to-finish, PRRSV-infected pig farm to characterize the time-course of the virus-specific immune response in two groups of replacement gilts. Despite the occurrence of three and two distinct waves of infection in groups 1 and 2, respectively, the large majority of animals showed little if any PRRSV-specific response in an interferon-gamma release assay on whole blood, whereas non-specific responses were consistently observed. To rule out any possible bias of our test procedure, this was used along with an ELISPOT assay for interferon-gamma-secreting cells with the same reagents on a group of PRRS-virus infected pigs in isolation facilities. A very good agreement was shown between the two sets of results. Also, as opposed to the PRRS model, plenty of Pseudorabies virus-vaccinated pigs under field conditions scored positive in another experiment in the interferon-gamma release assay, ad hoc modified for the Pseudorabies virus. Our results indicate that under field conditions poor or no development rather than delayed development of the PRRS virus-specific interferon-gamma response could be the rule for a long time in non-adult pigs after PRRS virus infection. Housing and hygiene conditions, as well as heavy exposure to environmental microbial payloads in intensive pig farms could adversely affect the host's immune response to PRRS virus and partly account for the discrepancies between experimental and field studies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The aim of the study is to better understand MRSA environmental contamination in pig holdings in relation to the productive phase and the application of environmental cleaning and disinfection practices (C&D). This study was carried out on six herds. Dust samples from farrowing crates, weaning boxes, growing and finishing pens were collected from each herd environment prior to and after C&D and cultured for MRSA. Ten samples were collected at the end of each productive phase with the animals present and 10 additional samples were collected after C&D, prior to introduction of a new stock. The proportion of positive samples prior to C&D was lower in fattening than in other phases. The proportion of positive samples prior to and after C&D was 121/240 (50%) and 46/240 (19%) respectively. In the mixed effects logistic regression analysis it was shown not only that both productive phase and C&D were associated with the probability of having a positive sample but also that the C&D effect was different in the different productive phases. In particular the effect of C&D was stronger in farrowing crates than in the other productive phases. The results of this study show that, although current practices of cleaning and disinfection reduce MRSA environmental contamination, they are likely to be inadequate to the elimination of the microorganism. However, a strict application of hygienic protocols can lead to a marked reduction of MRSA environmental contamination. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Prednisolone is a steroid belonging to the corticosteroid group. The results obtained in the application of the 2008 and 2009 Italian Residue Control Plans show the frequent detection of prednisolone traces in cow's urine. Since most of the positive samples were detected at the slaughterhouse, the researchers hypothesised that, together with an increase of cortisol concentration, traces of prednisolone could be produced endogenously during stressful situations due to transport and handling before slaughter. In the present trial, 52 lactating cows housed in seven different farms in Lombardy, Italy, were studied. Urine samples were collected at the farm (after urethral catheterisation) and immediately after slaughter (from urinary bladder) together with 40 adrenal gland samples belonging to the same animals. All the samples were analysed for the determination of prednisolone and cortisol by LC/MSn. The results demonstrated that prednisolone can be endogenously produced in dairy cows and, furthermore, its endogenous presence in bovine urine seems to be strongly related to a state of stress in the animals (at the farm and at the slaughterhouse). The data from adrenal glands do not, however, clarify if the endogenous production occurs, partially or totally, in this organ. © 2013 Copyright Taylor &amp; Francis.},

abstract={Norovirus (NoV) are increasingly important as etiological agents of gastrointestinal infections. Consumption of bivalve molluscs and ready-to-eat fishery products is one of the most common ways of acquiring NoV foodborne infections, and the rise of outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis represents an important health problem that is also responsible for economic losses. The aim of this work was to define the prevalence of NoV contamination in preserved fishery products and in shellfish commercialized in Italy, taking into account the results obtained during 9 years of survey (2003-2011) and paying special attention to the regions more involved in national production. A total of 4463 samples were examined (2310 mussels, 1517 clams, 510 oysters, 22 other shellfish species, 104 preserved seafood products) and the average positivity rate for NoV presence was 4.1% and ranged from 0.6% in 2007 to 9.8% in 2003 and from 1.9% in preserved seafood products to 4.7% in mussels. Genetic characterization of circulating strains showed a prevalence of genogroup II genotypes, including GII.b and GII.e polymerase types and different GII.4 variants. This information could contribute to the optimization of risk-based sampling strategies for NoV contamination in seafood, taking into account variability in different species and from year to year. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract={Background: The common sole (Solea solea) is a promising candidate for European aquaculture; however, the limited knowledge of the physiological mechanisms underlying larval development in this species has hampered the establishment of successful flatfish aquaculture. Although the fact that genomic tools and resources are available for some flatfish species, common sole genomics remains a mostly unexplored field. Here, we report, for the first time, the sequencing and characterisation of the transcriptome of S. solea and its application for the study of molecular mechanisms underlying physiological and morphological changes during larval-to-juvenile transition.Results: The S. solea transcriptome was generated from whole larvae and adult tissues using the Roche 454 platform. The assembly process produced a set of 22,223 Isotigs with an average size of 726 nt, 29 contigs and a total of 203,692 singletons. Of the assembled sequences, 75.2% were annotated with at least one known transcript/protein; these transcripts were then used to develop a custom oligo-DNA microarray. A total of 14,674 oligonucleotide probes (60 nt), representing 12,836 transcripts, were in situ synthesised onto the array using Agilent non-contact ink-jet technology. The microarray platform was used to investigate the gene expression profiles of sole larvae from hatching to the juvenile form. Genes involved in the ontogenesis of the visual system are up-regulated during the early stages of larval development, while muscle development and anaerobic energy pathways increase in expression over time. The gene expression profiles of key transcripts of the thyroid hormones (TH) cascade and the temporal regulation of the GH/IGF1 (growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor I) system suggest a pivotal role of these pathways in fish growth and initiation of metamorphosis. Pre-metamorphic larvae display a distinctive transcriptomic landscape compared to previous and later stages. Our findings highlighted the up-regulation of gene pathways involved in the development of the gastrointestinal system as well as biological processes related to folic acid and retinol metabolism. Additional evidence led to the formation of the hypothesis that molecular mechanisms of cell motility and ECM adhesion may play a role in tissue rearrangement during common sole metamorphosis.Conclusions: Next-generation sequencing provided a good representation of the sole transcriptome, and the combination of different approaches led to the annotation of a high number of transcripts. The construction of a microarray platform for the characterisation of the larval sole transcriptome permitted the definition of the main processes involved in organogenesis and larval growth. © 2013 Ferraresso et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={In 2006 and 2007 pig farming in the region of Lombardy, in the north of Italy, was struck by an epidemic of Swine Vesicular Disease virus (SVDV). In fact this epidemic could be viewed as consisting of two sub-epidemics, as the reported outbreaks occurred in two separate time periods. These periods differed in terms of the provinces or municipalities that were affected and also in terms of the timing of implementation of movement restrictions. Here we use a simple mathematical model to analyse the epidemic data, quantifying between-farm transmission probability as a function of between-farm distance. The results show that the distance dependence of between-farm transmission differs between the two periods. In the first period transmission over relatively long distances occurred with higher probability than in the second period, reflecting the effect of movement restrictions in the second period. In the second period however, more intensive transmission occurred over relatively short distances. Our model analysis explains this in terms of the relatively high density of pig farms in the area most affected in this period, which exceeds a critical farm density for between-farm transmission. This latter result supports the rationale for the additional control measure taken in 2007 of pre-emptively culling farms in that area. © 2013 Nassuato et al.},

abstract={Background:The circulation of West Nile virus and Usutu virus was detected in the Emilia-Romagna region in 2008 and 2009. To evaluate the extent of circulation of both viruses, environmental surveillance, based on bird and mosquito testing, was conducted in 2008 and gradually improved over the years.Methods:In February-March 2009-2011, 5,993 hibernating mosquitoes were manually sampled, out of which 80.1% were Culex pipiens; none tested positive for the viruses. From 2008 to 2011, 946,213 mosquitoes, sampled between May and October, were tested; 86.5% were Cx. pipiens. West Nile virus was detected in 32 Cx. pipiens pools, and Usutu virus was detected in 229 mosquito pools (217 Cx. pipiens, 10 Aedes albopictus, one Anopheles maculipennis s.l., and one Aedes caspius). From 2009 to 2011, of 4,546 birds collected, 42 tested positive for West Nile virus and 48 for Usutu virus. West Nile virus and Usutu virus showed different patterns of activity during the 2008-2011 surveillance period. West Nile virus was detected in 2008, 2009, and 2010, but not in 2011. Usutu virus, however, was continuously active throughout 2009, 2010, and 2011.Conclusions:The data strongly suggest that both viruses overwinter in the surveyed area rather than being continually reintroduced every season. The lack of hibernating mosquitoes testing positive for the viruses and the presence of positive birds sampled early in the season support the hypothesis that the viruses overwinter in birds rather than in mosquitoes. Herd immunity in key bird species could explain the decline of West Nile virus observed in 2011, while the persistence of Usutu virus may be explained by not yet identified reservoirs. Reported results are comparable with a peri-Mediterranean circulation of the West Nile virus lineage 1 related strain, which became undetectable in the environment after two to three years of obvious circulation. © 2013 Calzolari et al.},

abstract={In 2005-2008, 1152 samples (451 faecal samples, 451 carcass swabs and 250 tonsils) were collected from 451 finishing pigs slaughtered in three abattoirs of northern Italy. In two abattoirs, 34 scalding water samples were collected. The aim of this study was to investigate the faecal and palatine tonsil carriage rate of Salmonella enterica and Yersinia enterocolitica in pigs at slaughter and the degree of carcass contamination by these bacteria. Typing of the isolates, virulence characterization and antimicrobial testing were also performed.S. enterica was isolated from 21.5% of the faecal samples, 10.9% of the carcasses and 10.4% of the tonsils, but not from scalding water. Nineteen different serovars were identified among 172 S. enterica isolates. The prevalent serovars were Derby (41.3%), Rissen (12.2%), Typhimurium (11%), 4,[5],12:i:- (8.7%) and Give (4.1%). S. enterica ser. Typhimurium and S. enterica ser. 4,[5],12:i:- isolates were phage-typed and PT DT120 was the most common (23.5%). Y. enterocolitica was detected in 17.1% of the faecal samples, 2.4% of the carcasses, 10.8% of the tonsils and 11.8% of the scalding water samples. A total of 119 isolates were found, four of them in water. Of the 115 Y. enterocolitica isolates of pig origin, 24 (20.9%) were 4/O:3 and 4 (3.5%) were 2/O:9. Y. enterocolitica 4/O:3 represented 85.7% of the pathogenic isolates found in all types of samples and 100% of those found in tonsils. In 4/O:3 isolates the most common virulence-associated genes were ystA (100%), inv (95.8%), ail (87.5%) and yadA (54.2%). In 2/O:9 isolates the prevalent genes were ail (100%), inv (100%) and ystA (100%), followed by ystB (25.0%). The majority (75.7%) of Y. enterocolitica isolates was biotype 1A, belonging to 13 serotypes (O:3; O:5; O:4,32-4,33; O:6,30-6,31; O:7,8-8; O:7,8-8-8,19; O:7,13; O:8; O:9; O:13; O:16-16,29; O:41,42-41,43; O:52). The most common virulence genes in 1A isolates were inv (95.4%) and ystB (72.4%).The antimicrobial resistance test showed that all Salmonella isolates were susceptible to cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, cefalothin, gentamicin and enrofloxacin. Resistances to tetracycline (56%), sulphonamide compounds (42%) and streptomycin (34%) were the most common. All Y. enterocolitica isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, enrofloxacin, gentamicin, kanamicin and neomycin. Most isolates were resistant to cefalothin (92%) and ampicillin (89%).Apparently, carcass contamination by S. enterica and Y. enterocolitica was more likely attributable to cross-contamination than to self-contamination, suggesting that good hygienic measures and slaughtering procedures can control transmission of these pathogens to pork meat. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The main goal in cancer chemotherapy is to drive the drug into the tumor microenvironment to kill as many cancer cells as possible while producing the lowest collateral toxicity. Previously, we have shown that human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hBM-MSCs) exposed to Paclitaxel (PTX) were able to uptake and subsequently release the drug in the culture medium. PTX primed hBM-MSCs (hBM-MSCsPTX) located in the vicinity of cancer cells produced a strong inhibition of tumor cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. To expand these observations, in the present study we exposed human skin derived fibroblasts (hSDFs) to 2,000 ng/ml of PTX and then tested both cells and their conditioned medium (CM) in vitro for their capacity to inhibit the proliferation of human tumor cell lines (MOLT-4, DU-145, U87-MG, SH-SY5Y(+) and LAN-5). We found that hSDFs primed with PTX (hSDFsPTX) were able to uptake and subsequently release PTX in a time dependent manner. hSDFsPTX-derived CM(hSDFsPTX-CM) from 1:4 to 1:10 dilutions produced a significant (p<0.05) in vitro tumor growth inhibition. hSDFsPTX co-cultured with leukemia cells at 1:1 to 1:10 ratio, completely inhibited cells growth whereas no inhibition was induced by normal hSDFs cells. Our results demonstrate for the first time that hSDFs can be loaded in vitro with PTX and thus can acquire a potent anti-tumor activity. Since hSDFs can be easily isolated from skin biopsies without any particular pain and discomfort to donor patients, we conclude that hSDFs may represent a valid cell type option for carrying and delivering anti-cancer drugs. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Summary: From January 2007 to December 2011, a total of 106 Haemophilus parasuis strains isolated from pigs were serotyped by agar gel diffusion test (DG). Serovar 4 was the most prevalent (24.5%), followed by serovar 13 (19.8%) and serovar 5 (11.3%). Twenty-nine strains were non-typeable (27.3%). The strains were divided into two groups, depending on whether they were isolated from specific pathological lesions of systemic disease such as polyserositis, arthritis or meningitis (73 cases of 106) or from the lower respiratory tract of pigs suffering from bronchopneumonia (33 cases of 106). Serovars 4 and 13 had a higher prevalence in systemic infection (polyserositis) than in respiratory disease only. Pasteurella multocida (14/106), Streptococcus suis (7/106), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (4/106), Bordetella bronchiseptica (3/106) and Arcanobacterium pyogenes (3/106) were isolated in association with H. parasuis. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={The aim of the study was the comparative evaluation of an isothermal amplification and bioluminescence detection of DNA (IMBD) method and method ISO 6579:2002 for detection of Salmonella in retail meat products of unknown contamination status. A total of 200 meat samples were tested: 116 minced meat and meat preparations to be eaten cooked (52 chicken, 48 pork, and 16 beef samples) and 84 fresh meat samples (68 poultry and 16 pork). With one or both methods, 21 samples (10.5%) were positive for Salmonella enterica. Fifteen samples were positive with both methods (71.4% of all positive samples), two more samples (9.5%) were positive with the IMBD method only, and four samples (19.1%) were positive with the ISO method only. One ISO-positive sample was inhibited with the IMBD method. For the IMBD method, relative accuracy was 97.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93.6 to 98.9%), relative sensitivity was 78.9%(95%CI, 54.4 to 93.9%), and relative specificity was 98.9% (95% CI, 96.1 to 99.7%). Time to negative results was shorter with the IMBD method (20 to 24 h). Also, positive results were available in 20 to 24 h but should be confirmed using other methods (presumptive-positive results). Rapidity of response of the IMBD method gave us the opportunity to test the presumptive-positive samples by the most-probable-number (MPN) method, which was not performed for samples that were positive only with the ISO method because of likely microbial changes during the long storage period (5 to 7 days) at refrigeration temperature. Salmonella MPN values in naturally contaminated meat were low, at <0.3 to 2.1 MPN/g. © International Association for Food Protection.},

abstract={Background: The porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a devastating disease for the pig industry. In this study, we analysed the genetic variability of PRRS virus (PRRSV) as well as the relationship between the genetic variability, the geographical and temporal distribution of the PRRSV strains. Moreover, we investigated the association between the glycosylation patterns in PRRSV sequences and pigs growth.Results: The data highlight that PRRSV strains evolve rapidly on individual farms, and temporal evolution of PRRSV is an important factor of genetic variability. Analysis of glycosylation sites in the glycoprotein 5 (GP5) ectodomain revealed that PRRSV isolates had seven combinations of putative N-linked glycosylation sites of which the N37/46/53 sites was found in 79% of the sequences. No significant relationship was found between the genetic variation of the PRRSV strains and the geographic distance. A significant relationship was found between the genetic variation and time of sampling when farm was considered as a factor in the analysis. Furthermore, the commercial semen from artificial insemination centres was not a source of PRRS transmission.The PRRSV having the glycosylation site at position N46 (N46+) were observed to have higher burden on pigs and accordingly the corresponding infected pigs had lower average daily gain (ADG) compared with those infected with PRRSV lacking the glycosylation at N46 (N46-) position site. This study showed that the number of piglets by litter infected by PRRSV was lower for the Landrace breed than for the other studied breeds (Large White, Duroc and Pietrain).Conclusions: The PRRSV genetic variability which is determined by a local and temporal evolution at the farm level could be considered in a perspective of prevention. Moreover, the association between the PRRSV glycosylation patterns and its virulence could be of interest for vaccine development. The differences of resistance to PRRSV infections among pig breeds might open new horizons for the genetic selection of robustness against PRRSV infection. © 2013 Badaoui et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={The most important animal disease caused by yeast-like algae belonging to the genus Prototheca is bovine mastitis. Although the infection can be caused by both Prototheca zopfii genotype 2 and Prototheca blaschkeae, the bulk of prevalence of bovine protothecal mastitis has been so far attributed to the former, being P. blaschkeae only sporadically isolated. However, we report here the first outbreak of bovine mastitis caused by P. blaschkeae in an Italian dairy herd. One hundred and four individual milk samples, three bulk tank milk and 16 environmental samples within the herd were screened for the presence of Prototheca: five, one and four positive samples, were respectively observed. Molecular analysis revealed that, with the sole exception of one environmental isolate belonging to P. zopfii genotype 2, all Prototheca strains were identified as P. blaschkeae.Our results might suggest that even P. blaschkeae can induce mastitis outbreaks, while it is not clear if the higher incidence of P. zopfii genotype 2 as causative agent of protothecal mastitis could reflect an intrinsic higher pathogenicity or it could be simply the consequence of its, so far observed, higher diffusion in worldwide dairy herd ecosystems. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract={Avian-like H1N1 and reassortant H3N2 and H1N2 influenza A viruses with a human-like haemagglutinin have been co-circulating in swine in Europe for more than a decade. We aimed to examine the infection dynamics of the three swine influenza virus (SIV) lineages at the farm level, and to identify possible regional and seasonal variations in their circulation. Sera were collected from six successive generations of fattening pigs (2006-2008) in a total 80 farrow-to-finish herds in Belgium, Italy, France and Spain and examined for antibodies against the three SIVs in haemagglutination inhibition tests. Overall, in all regions and periods, 9.7% of all farms were negative for SIV, 49% were infected with one subtype, 38% with two subtypes and 3.9% with all three SIVs. We found serological evidence for the circulation of all three subtypes in Belgium, Italy and Spain, while only infections with H1N1 and H1N2 SIVs were detected in France. Despite temporary changes in the circulation of H1N2 in Belgium and in Spain, there was no true seasonal variation. The exact combination of subtypes on the same farm differed in each of the sampling periods. On the other hand, 21 farms were found to be consistently infected with the same SIV subtype throughout the study. This can either be explained by the persistence of the virus in a farm, or by the periodical re-introduction of SIVs of the same subtype. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Caprine herpesvirus 1 (CpHV1) is a member of ruminant alphaherpesviruses antigenically related to the prototype bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV1). Although cross reactivity between the two viruses involves many structural glycoproteins, the use of two competitive BoHV1 ELISAs detecting anti gB and gE antibodies has been proposed for CpHV1 infection, resulting mainly in a gB+/gE- reactivity and leading to suppose that CpHV1 gE may represent an useful target for the development of specific diagnostic test. Since CpHV1 gE gene has been only partially characterized so far, in this study the genome fragment of the short unique unit (Us) encompassing gI and gE gene was amplified and sequenced. Gene fragments encoding the ectodomain of both glycoproteins were subcloned into pSECTag2/Hygro and expressed in HEK293T cells as secreted form in serum free medium. Due to the lack of specific monoclonal antibodies (Mabs), the same recombinant glycoproteins were obtained from BoHV1 and used as positive control with a panel of specific gE and gI Mabs as well as in some ELISA assays. Results clearly indicate that the ectodomain of CpHV1 gE, immobilized on solid face in an indirect ELISA format, represents a sensitive and specific marker of infection, when compared with neutralization test, with absence of very low degree of cross-reactivity with BoHV1 gE counterpart, while the use of CpHV1 gI-ELISA or a combination of gE/gI complex did not significantly improve the sensitivity of the assay. In addition, in the rare event in which cross species barrier occurs for both viruses from their natural host to other species, the use of both BoHV1 and CpHV1 gE in a comparative assay may be proposed. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Recent evidences have demonstrated that the presence of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIV) may play an important role in host ecology and transmission of avian influenza viruses (AIV). While some authors have clearly demonstrated that LPAIV can mutate to render highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV), others have shown that their presence could provide the host with enough immunological memory to resist re-infections with HPAIV. In order to experimentally study the role of pre-existing host immunity, chickens previously infected with H7N2 LPAIV were subsequently challenged with H7N1 HPAIV. Pre-infection of chickens with H7N2 LAPIV conferred protection against the lethal challenge with H7N1 HPAIV, dramatically reducing the viral shedding, the clinical signs and the pathological outcome. Correlating with the protection afforded, sera from chickens primed with H7N2 LPAIV reacted with the H7-AIV subtype in hemagglutination inhibition assay and specifically with the N2-neuraminidase antigen. Conversely, subsequent exposure to H5N1 HPAIV resulted in a two days-delay on the onset of disease but all chickens died by 7 days post-challenge. Lack of protection correlated with the absence of H5-hemagglutining inhibitory antibodies prior to H5N1 HPAIV challenge. Our data suggest that in naturally occurring outbreaks of HPAIV, birds with pre-existing immunity to LPAIV could survive lethal infections with HA-homologous HPAIV but not subsequent re-infections with HA-heterologous HPAIV. These results could be useful to better understand the dynamics of AIV in chickens and might help in future vaccine formulations. © 2013 Vergara-Alert et al.},

abstract={Current leukaemia therapy focuses on increasing chemotherapy efficacy. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been proposed for carrying and delivery drugs to improve killing of cancer cells. We have shown that MSCs loaded with Paclitaxel (PTX) acquire a potent anti-tumour activity. We investigated the effect of human MSCs (hMSCs) and mouse SR4987 loaded with PTX (hMSCsPTX and SR4987PTX) on MOLT-4 and L1210, two leukaemia cell (LCs) lines of human and mouse origin, respectively. SR4987PTX and hMSCsPTX showed strong anti-LC activity. hMSCsPTX, co-injected with MOLT-4 cells or intra-tumour injected into established subcutaneous MOLT-4 nodules, strongly inhibited growth and angiogenesis. In BDF1-mice-bearing L1210, the intraperitoneal administration of SR4987PTX doubled mouse survival time. In vitro, both hMSCs and hMSCsPTX released chemotactic factors, bound and formed rosettes with LCs. In ultrastructural analysis of rosettes, hMSCsPTX showed no morphological alterations while the attached LCs were apoptotic and necrotic. hMSCs and hMSCsPTX released molecules that reduced LC adhesion to microvascular endothelium (hMECs) and down-modulated ICAM1 and VCAM1 on hMECs. Priming hMSCs with PTX is a simple procedure that does not require any genetic cell manipulation. Once the effectiveness of hMSCsPTX on established cancers in mice is proven, this procedure could be proposed for leukaemia therapy in humans. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Pigs play a key epidemiologic role in the ecology of influenza A viruses (IAVs) emerging from animal hosts and transmitted to humans. Between 2008 and 2010, we investigated the health risk of occupational exposure to swine influenza viruses (SIVs) in Italy, during the emergence and spread of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (H1N1pdm) virus. Methodology/Principal Findings: Serum samples from 123 swine workers (SWs) and 379 control subjects (Cs), not exposed to pig herds, were tested by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay against selected SIVs belonging to H1N1 (swH1N1), H1N2 (swH1N2) and H3N2 (swH3N2) subtypes circulating in the study area. Potential cross-reactivity between swine and human IAVs was evaluated by testing sera against recent, pandemic and seasonal, human influenza viruses (H1N1 and H3N2 antigenic subtypes). Samples tested against swH1N1 and H1N1pdm viruses were categorized into sera collected before (n. 84 SWs; n. 234 Cs) and after (n. 39 SWs; n. 145 Cs) the pandemic peak. HI-antibody titers ≥10 were considered positive. In both pre-pandemic and post-pandemic peak subperiods, SWs showed significantly higher swH1N1 seroprevalences when compared with Cs (52.4% vs. 4.7% and 59% vs. 9.7%, respectively). Comparable HI results were obtained against H1N1pdm antigen (58.3% vs. 7.7% and 59% vs. 31.7%, respectively). No differences were found between HI seroreactivity detected in SWs and Cs against swH1N2 (33.3% vs. 40.4%) and swH3N2 (51.2 vs. 55.4%) viruses. These findings indicate the occurrence of swH1N1 transmission from pigs to Italian SWs. Conclusion/Significance: A significant increase of H1N1pdm seroprevalences occurred in the post-pandemic peak subperiod in the Cs (p<0.001) whereas SWs showed no differences between the two subperiods, suggesting a possible occurrence of cross-protective immunity related to previous swH1N1 infections. These data underline the importance of risk assessment and occupational health surveillance activities aimed at early detection and control of SIVs with pandemic potential in humans. © 2013 De Marco et al.},

abstract={Knowledge of the antigenic structure of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) has relevance in the development of diagnostic assays, in the evaluation of the asntigenic variability and in the selection of appropriate vaccine strains. Antigenic sites have been investigated only in FMDVs of serotypes O, A and C, while it would be valuable to extend studies also to other serotypes. This paper reports the identification of antigenic sites involved in virus neutralization in the FMDV serotype Asia 1 by using a new panel of mAbs and their relation with sites described in other serotypes is discussed. Out of 24 mAbs raised against the FMDV serotype Asia 1, 10 neutralize viral infectivity and were used to select FMDV mutants resistant to neutralization. On the basis of their reactivity profile with virus mutants, the 10 neutralizing mAbs were clustered in four groups corresponding to four independent antigenic sites. By comparing the amino acid sequence of the parental virus and of virus mutants, the amino acids crucial for the four sites were mapped at the following positions: VP1 140-142, VP2 67-79, VP3 58/59 and VP3 218. Three of the four neutralizing sites identified and mapped on FMDV serotype Asia 1 correspond structurally and functionally to analogous sites described in FMDV serotypes O, A and C, enforcing the evidence that these are dominant antigenic sites in the FMDV structure. The fourth site, located at the C. terminus of VP3, is a new independent site, described for the first time in FMDV. © 2013 SGM.},

abstract={Background: In 2011, a new orthobunyavirus, named the Schmallenberg virus (SBV), was discovered in Europe. Like the related Shamonda virus, SBV is an arbovirus (arthropod-borne virus). After its discovery, the virus was detected in a wide area in north-western Europe, an unexpected finding in a territory where climatic conditions would not seem ideal for arbovirus transmission. This sudden expansion suggests the effect of 2011 drought as a key factor that may have triggered SBV circulation. The possible influence of drought, recorded in north-western Europe in early 2011, on virus circulation was evaluated.Methods and results: The locations of SBV detections in Europe until April 2012 were obtained, and area of virus circulation was evaluated by kernel density estimation. Precipitation data in SBV circulation area, summarized by the 3 month precipitation indexes of May, were compared with precipitation data outside that area, confirming driest conditions in that area.Conclusions: The onset of drought conditions recorded in the SBV detection area in early 2011 may have promoted the circulation of this virus. A correlation between circulation of some arboviruses and drought has been reported elsewhere. This was mainly explained by an effect of water deficit on the environment, which altered the relationships between vectors and reservoirs, but this correlation might be also the result of unknown effects of drought on the vectors. The effect of drought conditions on arbovirus circulation is most likely underestimated and should be considered, since it could promote expansion of arboviruses into new areas in a global warming scenario. © 2013 Calzolari and Albieri; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Foodborne disease caused by Salmonella represents a worldwide public health problem. In Europe, salmonellosis is still the second most commonly recorded zoonosis. Since the standard culture method for detecting Salmonella (ISO 6579:2002) requires up to 5 days to produce results, the need to develop rapid methods represents an important issue for the authorities and the producers. The aim of the present study was the in-house validation, according to ISO 16140, of an open-formula diagnostic real-time PCR for the detection of Salmonella in all the different meat categories reported in the EU Regulations relative to microbiological criteria for food safety. The assay employed specific primers and a probe target within the ttrRSBCA locus, which allows the tetrathionate respiration in Salmonella. Selectivity, relative accuracy, relative sensitivity and relative specificity were established by testing 110 bacterial strains and 175 various edible meat samples. Results showed 100 % selectivity, 100 % relative accuracy, 100 % relative sensitivity and 100 % relative specificity of the real-time PCR when compared to the standard culture method used as reference. In addition, in order to minimize the effect of the competitive micro-flora naturally present on meat samples, a highly nutritious and selective commercial medium (ONE Broth Salmonella, Oxoid) was evaluated in comparison with the classical non-selective pre-enrichment broth (buffered peptone water). Results demonstrated that the ONE Broth Salmonella medium increases the growth of Salmonella in the presence of competitive micro-flora. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={This study describes the isolation and molecular characterization of Mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) in microbats. Faecal samples and dead individuals available from rehabilitation centres or collected from known roost sites were virologically tested. In total, 112 carcasses of bats found dead, and 44 faecal samples were analysed. Nineteen viral strains were isolated by in vitro cell culture from faecal and tissue samples of different bat species (Pipistrellus khulii, Tadarida teniotis, Rhinolophus hipposideros and Vespertilio murinus), and they were morphologically identified as reoviruses by negative staining electron microscopy observation. The definitive assignment of all isolates to MRV was confirmed by RT-PCR assays targeting the L1 gene. Through a multiplex RT-PCR assay targeting the S1 gene, we typed 15 of 19 isolates as MRV type 3. Partial L1 (416bp) and complete S1 (1416bp) sequences of the isolates were analysed and compared with those of reference strains obtained from GenBank, belonging to the three serotypes. Molecular analysis of the S1 gene revealed that the amino acid residues associated with neurotropism (198-204NLAIRLP, 249I, 350D and 419E) were highly conserved among the Italian bat strains. These results suggest that potentially neurotropic MRV type 3 strains are widespread among Italian bats. Furthermore, the identification of MRV type 3 in bat species such as Pipistrellus Khulii, which is common in urban areas and known for its close contact with humans, underlines the need for vigilance. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={Diagnostic and containment measures are essential for the management of avian influenza. In this study, a monoclonal antibody (MAb)-based competitive ELISA for detecting antibodies against H5 avian influenza viruses was developed and validated. Twenty-five anti-H5 MAbs were characterised using competitive, indirect and sandwich ELISAs, immunofluorescence, Western blotting and virus neutralisation and haemagglutination inhibition assays. One MAb (5D8) with wide intra-subtype cross-reactivity was selected and characterised using escape mutant selection. Epitope analysis showed that this MAb recognises a conformational epitope comprising amino acid residues in positions 170, 235 and 240 located in the receptor binding domain. The diagnostic performance of the test was evaluated by ROC analysis using a panel of 950 known sera collected from different avian species, including chickens, turkeys, ducks, pheasants, wild Anseriformes and ostriches. The competitive ELISA had excellent diagnostic performance and discriminatory power with high Se and Sp values (Se: 99.6-95% CI 98.0-100; Sp: 99.4-95% CI 98.5-99.8). In addition to its excellent diagnostic performance, properties of the competitive ELISA, such as high feasibility of testing sera without pre-treatment and potential for automation and instrument-mediated detection, make it ideal for screening samples, confirming positive HI assay results or analysing samples that are difficult to test using the HI assay. © 2012.},

abstract={A new chromatographic method is proposed for the analysis of aflatoxin M1 in milk. The method is based on liquid-liquid extraction followed by LC-MS/MS analysis. Liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) is performed on the defatted milk plus sodium chloride by using ethyl acetate as an extraction solvent. Accuracy and precision were evaluated at the LOQ (15 ng kg-1) spiked sample as well as with three other different naturally contaminated reference materials. The mean overall recovery (n = 24) was 95% with a confidence interval of 1.9% and a CV% of 4.5%. The performance of the proposed method was compared with that of the Official ISO Method based on the use of immunoaffinity chromatography columns (IAC): LLE protocol could be considered a valid alternative to the LC-IAC. In general it showed better accuracy with lower data dispersion. Moreover, the sample preparation is very simple and straightforward, potentially being applicable as a high-throughput method which, on account of its simplicity and low cost, may be applied to the analysis of a large number of samples in the occasion of outbreaks of large-scale contamination. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Considering the wide distribution of wild boars and the feeding behaviour (omnivorous scavengers), wild boars may be a good indicator for environmental presence of Salmonella spp. The aims of this study were to determine the presence of Salmonella spp. in hunted wild boars and to determine the serotype the isolated strains. Over three hunting seasons, the intestinal contents of 1,313 boars hunted in northern Italy were sampled and cultured. Salmonella spp. were isolated from 326 boars (24.82%). Thirty different serovars belonging to three different S. enterica spp. were found. Twenty-one serovars of S. enterica subsp. Enterica were found including the human pathogens S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis. In addition, nine serovars belonging to S.enterica subsp. diarizonae and S. enterica subsp. houtenae were detected. Considering the widespread occurrence of wild boars in Europe, the epidemiological role of this species in relation to salmonellosis might be relevant and should be further investigated. Wild boars may act as healthy carriers of a wide range of Salmonella serotypes.},

abstract={Chemical treatments are commonly adopted for poultry house sanitation. In fact, ordinary floor disinfection is needed to deplete the pathogenic population (i.e. various species of bacteria and fungi) and reduce the risk of meat contamination. The increasing focus on the health of consumers and operators, as well as on food quality, has led farmers to consider alternative environmentally friendly methods. Research was carried out to set up a new machine for floor disinfection of poultry houses by open flame. The trials were run in controlled conditions in the laboratory of the University of Pisa, Italy, and on a private farm. The first experiment consisted of a series of test bench trials carried out to evaluate the efficacy and the adjustment of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)-fed open flame burners on pre-inoculated steel plates. In the second experiment, the operative parameters of a custom-built 1.5 m wide mounted flaming machine were determined and the biological effects of the treatment were compared to ordinary chemical treatments. The results obtained were very promising. Test bench trials showed a 4-log reduction in E. coli, and microbial determinations carried out on-farm did not show any difference between thermal and chemical treatment. In addition, the cost estimation showed that thermal disinfection is approximately 4-fold cheaper than chemical sanitation methods. The effective working capacity of the machine was approximately 1700 m2 h–1, and the LPG consumption was approximately 16 kg per 1000 m2. Flame disinfection of poultry grow-out facilities could represent a valid alternative to chemical disinfection. © 2013, M. Raffaelli et al.},

abstract={Constitutive activation of the canonical and noncanonical nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathways is frequent in multiple myeloma (MM) and can compromise sensitivity to TRAIL. In this study, we demonstrate that Aurora kinases physically and functionally interact with the key regulators of canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways IκB kinase b (IKKβ) and IKKα to activate NF-κB in MM, and the pharmacological blockade of Aurora kinase activity induces TRAIL sensitization in MM because it abrogates TRAIL-induced activation of NF-κB. We specifically found that TRAIL induces prosurvival signaling by increasing the phosphorylation state of both Aurora and IKK kinases and their physical interactions, and the blockade of Aurora kinase activity by pan-Aurora kinase inhibitors (pan-AKIs)disrupts TRAIL-induced survival signaling by effectively reducing Aurora-IKK kinase interactions and NF-κB activation. Pan-AKIs consistently blocked TRAIL induction of the antiapoptotic NF-κB target genes A1/Bfl-1 and/or Mcl-1, both important targets for TRAIL sensitization in MM cells. In summary, these results identify a novel interaction between Aurora and IKK kinases and show that these pathways can cooperate to promote TRAIL resistance. Finally, combiningpan-AKIs with TRAIL in vivo showed dramatic efficacy in a multidrug-resistant human myeloma xenograft model. These findings suggest that combining Aurora kinase inhibitors with TRAIL may have therapeutic benefit in MM. © 2013 by The American Society of Hematology.},

The method was set up using reference strains belonging to P. zopfii genotype 1, P. zopfii genotype 2, and P. blaschkeae as target species and P. stagnora, and P. ulmea as negative controls. The assay was applied on 50 isolates of Prototheca spp. isolated from bovine mastitic milk or bulk-tank milk samples, and all isolates were identified as P. zopfii genotype 2.

abstract={The European rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus, is threatened within its native range, yet it is a highly successful colonizing pest species across its worldwide introduced range, causing large economic losses and widespread environmental degradation. To date, there has been no long-term empirical evidence documenting the relative roles of climatic, epidemiological and biological factors in limiting life-history determinants of rabbit range and abundance. Using 12years of capture-mark-recapture data from their exotic range in Australia, we constructed candidate Cormack-Jolly-Seber models to test the influence of environmental, competition and disease conditions on rabbit survival and recruitment. Our results show that: (i) population-level disease infection rate has the largest overall impact on rabbit survival, explaining 80% of variance in survival rates; (ii) environmental as well as epidemiological conditions constrain rabbit survival, especially for younger animals; (iii) temporal variation in rabbit kitten recruitment patterns are best described by a combination of climate, competition and disease settings (accounting for 68% of variance), while temperature alone has a strong negative influence on kitten recruitment; and (iv) recruitment responds positively to rabbit haemorrhagic disease, but negatively to myxomatosis - the former, probably being mediated through a disease driven effect on intraspecific competition for food. A strengthened understanding of climate change impacts on rabbit range and abundance can be achieved by accounting explicitly for potential synergisms between disease dynamics and climate. In this analysis, we provide the first step towards such an attempt for this important mammal species. Integrated approaches of this kind are essential for future forecasts of rabbit range and abundance, offsetting the conservation threat faced by O.cuniculus in its native range, and achieving effective management in exotic habitats. © 2012 The Authors.

abstract={Sardinia is a Mediterranean island with a long geological history, leading to a separation process from continental Europe during the Miocene. As a consequence, in this insular habitat some wild bird species developed endemic forms, some of which are currently threatened. The aim of this study is to evaluate the possible animal health risk associated with a potential avian influenza virus (AIV) circulation in Sardinian wild bird populations. Overall, 147 cloacal swabs were sampled in the Sardinia region from June 2009 to September 2011. Samples were obtained from 12 taxonomic orders, including 16 families and 40 species of birds. Based on the endangered host status or on the ecology of the host-virus interaction, samples were categorized into three groups of species: 1) endemic, endangered, or both (17 species); 2) potential reservoir (21 species); and 3) potential spillover (two species). Cloacal swabs were tested by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR for influenza A virus matrix gene amplification. Forty-one serum samples were tested by nucleoprotein-enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (NP-ELISA) for antibodies against influenza A virus nucleoprotein and by hemagglutination inhibition assay for detection of seropositivity against H5 and H7 AIV subtypes. No cloacal swabs tested RT-PCR positive for AIV, whereas two weak seropositive results were detected by NP-ELISA in a mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and in a yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis). The low or absent AIV circulation detected in Sardinia's wild birds during the study suggests a nave status in these avian populations. These data provide new information on AIV circulation in Sardinia's wild birds that could be applied to implement conservation strategies for threatened species.},

abstract={Early weaning of farmed pigs before 25 days of age is a complex multi-factor stressor, often leading to health and welfare issues. The most obvious and crucial feature is that many piglets do not consume food in this period. On this basis, the final stressing impact is derived from a combination of physical, nutritional, immunological and emotional components. On the whole, there is strong evidence that a reduction in the pigs' weaning age can lead to increased adaptation difficulties in terms of behavioural, neuroendocrine and immune responses, as also observed by means of clinical immunology and chemistry analyses. This is the argument underlying the recommended minimum age of 28 days at weaning in EU Directive 2001/93/EC. Inflammatory, stress and innate immune responses sustain the coping efforts of piglets at weaning. Some responses are weaningspecific, whereas others reflect the related social stress of regrouping (mixing) and separation from the sow. An innate immune response to tissue damage at weaning (shorter, atrophic villi and larger, deeper crypts) and relevant control mechanisms are likely to be of paramount importance. In this respect, type I (α/β) interferons (IFNs) were shown to play a major regulatory role of the inflammatory response at weaning. Also, a low-dose, oral IFN-α treatment was shown to sustain the coping efforts of piglets. These results are of some importance in view of a global assessment of food safety 'from farm to fork', and of the related need to reduce the extensive, diarrhoearelated use of drug-supplemented feeds after weaning. © CAB International 2012.},

abstract={Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), the causative agent of foot-and-mouth disease, is an Apthovirus within the Picornaviridae family. Replication of the virus occurs in association with replication complexes that are formed by host cell membrane rearrangements. The largest viral protein in the replication complex, 2C, is thought to have multiple roles during virus replication.However, studies examining the function of FMDV 2C have been rather limited. To better understand the role of 2C in the process of virus replication, we used a yeast two-hybrid approach to identify host proteins that interact with 2C. We report here that cellular Beclin1 is a specific host binding partner for 2C. Beclin1 is a regulator of the autophagy pathway, a metabolic pathway required for efficient FMDV replication. The 2C-Beclin1 interaction was further confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy to actually occur in FMDV-infected cells. Overexpression of either Beclin1 or Bcl-2, another important autophagy factor, strongly affects virus yield in cell culture. The fusion of lysosomes to autophagosomes containing viral proteins is not seen during FMDV infection, a process that is stimulated by Beclin1; however, in FMDV-infected cells overexpressing Beclin1 this fusion occurs, suggesting that 2C would bind to Beclin1 to prevent the fusion of lysosomes to autophagosomes, allowing for virus survival. Using reverse genetics, we demonstrate here that modifications to the amino acids in 2C that are critical for interaction with Beclin1 are also critical for virus growth. These results suggest that interaction between FMDV 2C and host protein Beclin1 could be essential for virus replication. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.},

abstract={Midichloria mitochondrii is an intracellular bacterium found in the hard tick Ixodes ricinus. In this arthropod, M. mitochondrii is observed in the oocytes and in other cells of the ovary, where the symbiont is present in the cell cytoplasm and inside the mitochondria. No studies have so far investigated whether M. mitochondrii is present in the salivary glands of the tick and whether it is transmitted to vertebrates during the tick blood meal. To address the above issues, we developed a recombinant antigen of M. mitochondrii (to screen human sera) and antibodies against this antigen (for the staining of the symbiont). Using these reagents we show that (i) M. mitochondrii is present in the salivary glands of I. ricinus and that (ii) seropositivity against M. mitochondrii is highly prevalent in humans parasitized by I. ricinus (58%), while it is very low in healthy individuals (1.2%). These results provide evidence that M. mitochondrii is released with the tick saliva and raise the possibility that M. mitochondrii is infectious to vertebrates. Besides this, our study indicates that M. mitochondrii should be regarded as a package of antigens inoculated into the human host during the tick bite. This implies that the immunology of the response toward the saliva of I. ricinus is to be reconsidered on the basis of potential effects of M. mitochondrii and poses the basis for the development of novel markers for investigating the exposure of humans and animals to this tick species. © W.

The aim of this study were to assess the behaviour of Salmonella Typhimurium during the production of artisan water buffalo mozzarella cheese and during its shelf life under different temperature conditions. Raw milk was inoculated with S. Typhimurium and the evolution of S. Typhimurium count during production and shelf life was monitored. In artisan WBMC production technology S. Typhimurium multiplied in the curd during ripening, but its growth rate expressed in log CFU/g/h was lower than the growth rate reported by theoretical predictions. Stretching proved to be a process with good repeatability and able to reduce S. Typhimurium contamination by 5.5 Log CFU/g. The intrinsic characteristics of traditional WBMC proved to be unable to obstacolate the growth of S. Typhimurium during storage in the case of thermal abuse. Control of raw milk contamination and a proper refrigeration temperature are key factors in reducing the risk for consumers, © A. Serraino et al., 2012 Licensee PAGEPress, Italy.},

abstract={Influenza outbreaks are widespread in swine and avian populations. Disease control is jeopardized by the extreme antigenic variability of virus strains. Primary isolation of Influenza virus is performed using embryonated chicken eggs (ECE), but alternatives to ECE are badly needed. Although various cultured cells have been used for propagating Influenza A viruses, few types of cells can efficiently support virus replication. One of the most commonly cell lines used in order to isolate Influenza A virus, is represented by the Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell line, but cells derived from primary swine organs (kidney, testicle, lung and trachea) can also be employed. The aim of this study was the evaluation of NSK, MDCK, UMNSAH/DF1 cell lines suitability, compared to ECE for isolation and propagation of Avian and Swine virus subtypes. The results indicated both NSK and MDCK could provide an appropriate substrate for cultivating either Avian (AIV) or Swine (SIV) Influenza virus strains, especially for high pathogenicity Avian Influenza ones.Furthermore, NSK appeared more susceptible than MDCK cells for primary isolation of AIV. In contrast, UMNSAH/DF1 cell line seemed to be less permissive to support Avian virus growth. Furthermore, no SIV replication was detected except for one subtype. Additionally, the results of this study indicated that not all virus strains seemed to adapt with the same efficiency to the different cell lines. On the contrary, chicken embryos were shown to be the most suitable biological system for AIV isolation. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract={Amoxicillin, a β-lactam antibiotic widely used in pigs, has a broad spectrum of action and bactericidal activity against the common respiratory pathogens. The aim of the present study was to identify the bioavailability and pharmacokinetic behaviour of two different formulations of amoxicillin orally administered to pigs. A new premix for medicated feedstuff containing 10% of coated amoxicillin, was developed using a hydrophobic matrix and was compared with a premix for medicated feedstuff containing 10% of not coated amoxicillin. Two feed formulations medicated with 20 gr. of the two premixes for medicated feedstuff were administered to 8 pigs using a two period, two sequence crossover design with a 7 days washout period. Medicated feed was administered to pigs as a single dose at 8 mg/kg b.w., and was rapidly and totally consumed. Amoxicillin analyses in serum were performed by a sensitive high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with fluorometric detection, using an extraction procedure already described for edible tissues of fish and adapted and validated for pig serum. The oral bioavailability of the formulation with coated amoxicillin was higher than the one of not coated amoxicillin and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) values was significantly different (P&lt;0.05). Differences between the mean maximum concentration (C max), time of Cmax (tmax) and mean residence time (MRT) of the drug formulations were also statistically significant. Coated amoxicillin is suitable for in-feed administration to pigs and, thanks to its higher oral bioavailability compared to the not coated compound; it may be more effective for the treatment of susceptible infections. The bioavailability of the coated formulation most probably is referred to a greater stability in acid environment compared to not coated amoxicillin. Furthermore the protection of amoxicillin with a hydrophobic matrix matches with a reduced risk of cross-contamination and improves safety of feed manufacturing.},

abstract={Increased disease rates are commonly reported among high-yielding dairy cows in the transition period, extending from 3. weeks before to 3. weeks after calving, and characterized by the occurrence of an inflammatory response in terms of both positive and negative acute phase proteins (APP+ and APP-). To determine the above inflammatory response, the authors had developed the Liver Functionality Index (LFI), which defines the above condition on the basis of some APP- responses (albumin, cholesterol sensu stricto+. bilirubin) during the first month of lactation. In this respect, low LFI values are associated to a high inflammatory response and vice versa. The relationship between LFI and inflammatory cytokine response was investigated from day -28 to day +28 with respect to calving in 12 periparturient dairy cows showing the six highest and six lowest LFI values within a cohort of 54 high-yielding dairy cows. The hypothesis being tested was that LFI and APP- on the whole could be used as readout of successful vs. non-successful adaptation to the transition period, with a strong association to disease occurrence. In fact, low LFI cows experienced many more disease cases (13 vs. 3 in high LFI Group) and related drug treatments till day +28. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) serum concentrations were always higher in low LFI cows (. P<. 0.05 on day +28). The greater IL-6 levels were correlated with higher ceruloplasmin (APP+) and lower lysozyme serum concentrations (. P<. 0.05 and <0.1, respectively). This latter finding was correlated with a clear role in vitro of lysozyme in a dose-dependent modulation of the inflammatory response of swine intestinal epithelial cells and bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Hematological examinations showed no significant differences between the two groups under study. On the whole, our results indicate that LFI and LFI-related parameters could be used to identify cows at risk in the transition period toward an improved farm management. Also, our study indicates that disease cases in periparturient, high-yielding dairy cows are correlated with signs of accentuated IL-6 response and other markers of inflammatory phenomena. These likely start in the late lactation period or around dry-off, as suggested by our prepartal data, and proceed at much greater levels after calving. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Dermatophytosis is an infection of the keratinised layers of the skin and hair of animals and in cattle Trichophyton verrucosum is the most prevalent dermatophyte isolated. Trichophyton verrucosum is a spore forming fungus. The spores can remain alive for years in a dry environment. Cattle ringworm, caused by T. verrucosum, has worldwide distribution and has been considered a major public and veterinary health problem in the world in fact it's one of the most frequent zooanthroponoses and human occupational disease for farmers and veterinarians. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of ringworm in cattle and breeders in farms located in North of Italy in order to set-up efficacious strategies to prevent or control it. For these reasons two questionnaires were administered to 41 veterinarians working in North of Italy and to 354 farmers of the Province of Lodi. Moreover 45 samples (cutaneous fragments and hair) were collected by scarification from ringworm lesions for microscopical and cultural examinations. According to veterinarians involved in the study, dermatophytosis was present in 19% of farms in the last year (30% in the last 5 years). The reduction of zootechnical performance, referred by veterinarians, firstly involved young animals as lower average daily gains (34%). The attention of farmers and veterinarians, in relation to ringworm, was mainly focalized on cases with a great spread of the disease or on human infections (15% of infected farms), where the maximum use of the vaccine is observed. According to the results of this study among 354 farms, 88 of them (24,86%) were clinically positive for skin ringworm lesions. Ringworm lesions were most commonly observed in calves or in young animals. No significant relations were observed between ringworm and environmental factors, even if it's known that cleaning and disinfection of animals reduce spread of dermatophyte spores in the surroundings and prevent transmission by indirect contact. Trichophyton verrucosum was detected in 84,4% of cutaneous samples from ringworm lesions. In conclusion this study confirms the high prevalence of trichophytosis in cattle and in humans (farmers and veterinarians) and the necessity to adopt effectiveness prevention strategies, including also vaccination that appeared to be a very efficient measure in controlling bovine ringworm.},

abstract={The efficacy of diclazuril in growing rabbits was investigated under experimental and field conditions. In a first experimental trial, the susceptibility of recent isolated French Eimeria field strains to in-feed use of diclazuril, salinomycin and robenidine was studied in fattening rabbits. Rabbits were challenged at the age of 31 d with a mixed inoculum of Eimeria magna, E. media and £ perforans. Production data and oocyst excretion were compared with an infected-untreated control group and an uninfected-untreated control group. Infection resulted in significantly lower production data and higher oocyst excretion in the infected-untreated control group. Salinomycin and diclazuril treated rabbits were able to control the infection, demonstrated also by comparable weight gain and final weight to those of the uninfected-untreated control rabbits and significantly higher than those of the infected-untreated control rabbits. Based on the production data and oocyst excretion, robenidine was not able to control the infection adequately. Economic performance (weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion) and oocyst excretion were significantly worse than in the uninfecteduntreated controls. In a second trial, a 1 yr longitudinal study was carried out in Italy to evaluate the excretion of coccidia in growing rabbits from 8 meat farms applying a 2-phase anticoccidial programme (diclazuril and robenidine). Parasitological parameters (oocyst counts and species identification) were measured monthly. Seven of the 11 known coccidial rabbit species were identified. Variable levels of oocysts per gram were detected in the farms, but on all farms lower oocyst per gram and a reduced number of Eimeria spp. in rabbit faeces were recorded in the 8-mo treatment period with diclazuril. © WRSA UPV 2003.},

abstract={In Europe, three major swine influenza viral (SIV) subtypes (H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2) have been isolated in pigs. Developing a test that is able to detect and identify the subtype of the circulating strain rapidly during an outbreak of respiratory disease in the pig population is of essential importance.This study describes two multiplex RT-PCRs which distinguish the haemagglutinin (HA) gene and the neuraminidase (NA) gene of the three major subtypes of SIV circulating in Europe. The HA PCR was able to identify the lineage (avian or human) of the HA of H1 subtypes. The analytical sensitivity of the test, considered to be unique, was assessed using three reference viruses. The detection limit corresponded to 1×10 -1 TCID 50/200μl for avian-like H1N1, 1×10 0 TCID 50/200μl for human-like H1N2 and 1×10 1 TCID 50/200μl for H3N2 SIV. The multiplex RT-PCR was first carried out on a collection of 70 isolated viruses showing 100% specificity and then on clinical samples, from which viruses had previously been isolated, resulting in an 89% positive specificity of the viral subtype. Finally, the test was able to identify the viral subtype correctly in 56% of influenza A positive samples, from which SIV had not been isolated previously. It was also possible to identify mixed viral infections and the circulation of a reassortant strain before performing genomic studies. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={To compare the real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays used for the diagnosis of Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a Europe-wide interlaboratory ring trial was conducted. A variety of PRRSV strains including North American (NA) and European (EU) genotype isolates were analyzed by the participants. Great differences regarding qualitative diagnostics as well as analytical sensitivity were observed between the individual RT-qPCR systems, especially when investigating strains from the EU genotype. None of the assays or commercial kits used in the ring trial could identify all different PRRSV strains with an optimal analytical and diagnostic sensitivity. The genetic variability of the PRRSV strains, which is supposed to hinder the diagnostic of the RT-PCR because of mutations at the primer binding sites, was also confirmed by sequencing and subsequent phylogenetic analysis. In summary, a major problem in PRRSV diagnostics by RT-qPCR is false-negative results. To achieve maximum safety in the molecular diagnosis of PRRSV, the combined usage of different assays or kits is highly recommended. © 2012 The Author(s).},

abstract={Since 2008, the analyses carried out in the Lombardia region as part of National Residue Control Plans have evidenced unexpected frequent detection of the corticosteroid prednisolone (PRED) in cow urine samples taken to the slaughterhouse. Considering the scarce plausibility of these high frequent findings, analytical investigations were started to ascertain the real presence of this corticosteroid. The applied confirmatory method involved liquid-chromatography low-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (triple quadrupole) as instrumental technique, and it was validated in compliance with the requirements of the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. However, recently some criticism regarding Commission Decision 2002/657/EC identification criteria has been pointed out, experimentally demonstrating false positive results (wrong identification) although these criteria have been strictly observed. Therefore, considering the serious implications (i.e. the possibility that PRED could be considered endogenous in particular animal conditions), studies were carried out to investigate the reliability of PRED identification through the change of the chromatographic conditions (mobile phases, gradient and analytical column) of the confirmatory procedure routinely applied. Further confirmation came from the application of high-resolution mass spectrometry technique (MS2 and MS3 experiments) to analyze incurred cow urines samples. All the obtained results confirmed definitively the real presence of this corticosteroid excluding false-positive findings in routine analysis. In addition, other experiments demonstrated that high-resolution mass spectrometers (Time of Flight and Orbitrap technologies) could be successfully applied to routine determination of steroid residues in biological fluids at very low concentrations (&lt; 1 μg L-1).

abstract={Gastrointestinal disorders, constipation in particular, are the most common non-motor dysfunctions affecting Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. We have previously reported that rats bearing unilateral nigrostriatal lesion caused by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) stereotaxic injection develop severe constipation together with a region-specific decrease of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in enteric neurons of the lower intestinal tract. Here, we extend these observations on other enteric neuronal subpopulations, investigating also the propulsive activity of isolated colonic specimens. Four weeks post 6-OHDA injection, lesioned rats showed a significant increase of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) concomitant with the reduced expression of nNOS in the myenteric plexus of distal ileum and proximal colon; in particular VIP increased in a subpopulation of neurons actively expressing nNOS. On the other hand, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) was not modified in any of the intestinal segments analyzed. Interestingly, we found a reduced expression of dopamine receptor type 2 (D2R) in proximal (- 66.8%) and distal (- 54.5%) colon, together with reduced peristalsis efficiency (decrease in intraluminal pressure and frequency of peristaltic events) in the 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. The selective depletion of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons is associated with changes in the expression of enteric inhibitory neurotransmitters, as well as of the D2R in intestinal specific regions. Moreover, 6-OHDA-lesioned rats demonstrated altered colon propulsive activity referable to the D2R decrease. Our findings unveil subtle mechanisms underlying the enteric neurochemical plasticity events evoked by disruption of the normal brain-gut cross-talk, giving a peculiar point of view on the pathophysiology of the severe constipation that frequently affects PD patients. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Mycobacterium bovis recognizes as hosts a wide spectrum of animal species. In particular epidemiological situations, high prevalence of infection is found also in pigs. In the present study, we evaluated the capability of the interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) assay to identify pigs infected with M. bovis. The results of the immune-diagnosis were correlated to the findings of the post mortem inspection and the bacterial culture of lymph nodes. Blood samples of 146 pigs, belonging to a local breed of Sicily reared in free or semi-free roaming conditions, were collected to assess the specificity and the sensibility of the IFN-γ assay. Thirty-one pigs, from M. bovis free herds, did not react to the IFN-γ assay, yielding a specificity of 100%. The IFN-γ assay identified 15 out of 19 animals positive to the bacterial culture and 22 out of 26 animals with tuberculous lesions, with a sensibility of 78.9-84.6%, respectively. Out of 26 reactors to the test, 15 pigs (57.7%) confirmed to be infected after the bacterial culture and 22 (84.6%) had tuberculous lesions. The IFN-γ assay was able to reveal 4 animals with no visible lesions (NVL). Together, these findings support the feasible use of the IFN-γ assay as an intra vitam tool for the surveillance and management of M. bovis infection in swine populations. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most significant swine diseases worldwide. Despite its relevance, serum biomarkers associated with early-onset viral infection, when clinical signs are not detectable and the disease is characterized by a weak anti-viral response and persistent infection, have not yet been identified. Surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) is a reproducible, accurate, and simple method for the identification of biomarker proteins related to disease in serum. This work describes the SELDI-TOF MS analyses of sera of 60 PRRSV-positive and 60 PRRSV-negative, as measured by PCR, asymptomatic Large White piglets at weaning. Sera with comparable and low content of hemoglobin (< 4.52 μg/mL) were fractionated in 6 different fractions by anion-exchange chromatography and protein profiles in the mass range 1-200 kDa were obtained with the CM10, IMAC30, and H50 surfaces.Results: A total of 200 significant peaks (p < 0.05) were identified in the initial discovery phase of the study and 47 of them were confirmed in the validation phase. The majority of peaks (42) were up-regulated in PRRSV-positive piglets, while 5 were down-regulated. A panel of 14 discriminatory peaks identified in fraction 1 (pH = 9), on the surface CM10, and acquired at low focus mass provided a serum protein profile diagnostic pattern that enabled to discriminate between PRRSV-positive and -negative piglets with a sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 73%, respectively.Conclusions: SELDI-TOF MS profiling of sera from PRRSV-positive and PRRSV-negative asymptomatic piglets provided a proteomic signature with large scale diagnostic potential for early identification of PRRSV infection in weaning piglets. Furthermore, SELDI-TOF protein markers represent a refined phenotype of PRRSV infection that might be useful for whole genome association studies. © 2012 Genini et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Escherichia coli isolated from lesions (Avian Pathogenic E. coli - APEC) of layer hens affected by colibacillosis and from intestinal contents of clinically-healthy birds (Avian Faecal E. coli - AFEC) were serotyped. All the isolates were investigated for the presence of virulence genes to determine which genes were more closely related to those from lesions.2. A number of different serogroups were detected, O78 being predominant among the isolates from colibacillosis.3. E. coli isolated from lesions were not linked to a specific pathotype (set of common virulence genes).4. The presence of the virulence genes, with the exception of astA, was associated more generally with APEC strains.5. Statistically, genes such as cva/cvi, tsh, iss, irp2 and iucD were more related to isolates from colibacillosis.6. It is suggested that the detection of these genes in a rapid and inexpensive test for field practitioners could provide useful information about the potential virulence of E. coli isolated in commercial layer flocks. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The risk of exposure to Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) when consuming Ready-to-Eat (RTE) seafood was assessed in the Veneto Region (Italy). Thirty-eight samples were analyzed, each sample consisted of three subunits belonging to the same batches. The first of the three units was examined immediately, the second was stored at +4°C (for all of its shelf-life) and the third at +10°C (for the latter third of its shelf-life) before the analysis. Chemical-physical and microbiological parameters were tested simultaneously. Culture results showed the presence of viable L. monocytogenes in 9 (23,68) of the 38 samples analysed, 3 (33,33) of which with a concentration >100cfu/g. PCR tests yielded 12 L. monocytogenes positive samples. Semipreserves with aw (water activity) and pH values that favour L. monocytogenes growth were the only ones to result positive to microbiological and PCR tests. Temperature proved to be an important factor as it limits the growth of L. monocytogenes, including products with potentially high competitive microbial charges. Four different serotypes were recovered and ribotyping has helped to highlight the genomic variability of L. monocytogenes strains in food. This supports the hypothesis that L. monocytogenes continues to evolve genetically to the detriment of phenotypic conservation. Copyright © 2012 Patrizia Gambarin et al.},

abstract={Background: infectious low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs) have been recently detected on feathers of wild ducks. Laboratory trial results suggested that the preen oil gland secretion, covering waterbirds' feathers, may attract and concentrate virus particles from AIV-contaminated waters to birds' bodies. We evaluated whether ducks can become infected by the ingestion of preen oil-associated viral particles, experimentally smeared on their plumage. In addition, we compared virologic and serologic results obtained from mallards whose feathers were experimentally infected, with those from wild mallards naturally carrying AIVs on feathers. Methods: we experimentally coated 7 mallards (Anas plathyrynchos) using preen oil mixed with a LPAIV (H10N7 subtype), and housed them for 45 days with a control, uncoated duck. Cloacal, oropharyngeal and feather swabs were collected from all birds and examined for AIV molecular detection and isolation. Blood samples were also taken to detect influenza specific antibodies. In addition, sera from 10 wild mallards, carrying on feathers infectious LPAIV H10N7, were examined. Results: virologic and serologic results indicated that through self- and allopreening all the birds experimentally coated with the preen oil/AIV mix and the control duck ingested viruses covering feathers and became infected. Virus isolation from feathers was up to 32 days post-coating treatment. One out of 8 wild mallards showing antibodies against type A influenza virus was seropositive for H10 subtype too. Conclusions: our experimental and field results show evidences suggesting that uninfected birds carrying viruses on their feathers, including immune ones, might play an active role in spreading AIV infection in nature. For this reason, routine AIV surveillance programs, aimed at detecting intestinal and/or respiratory viruses, should include the collection of samples, such as feather swabs, enabling the detection of viruses sticky to preened birds' bodies.},

abstract={The direct sale by farmers of raw milk for human consumption has been allowed in Italy since 2004. The aim of this study was to evaluate the behaviour of selected foodborne pathogens in raw milk sold in vending machines, in field handling conditions, and during shelf-life from production to consumption. Temperature of storage of raw milk in 33 farms authorized to produce and sell raw milk were investigated from farm to vending machine delivery, together with consumer habits in one province of the Emilia-Romagna region of northern Italy. Failure to maintain appropriate low temperatures during shelf-life was recorded and 43% of consumers did not boil milk before consumption. Listeria monocy-togenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium and Campylobacter jejuni strains were inoculated into raw milk samples, and the best (4°C as established by law) and worst temperature storage conditions detected (variable temperature) were simulated. Boiling tests were performed for each pathogen considered at high and low levels of contamination. Results showed an increase in L. monocytogenes in milk stored at 4°C and at variable temperatures recorded in shelf-life monitoring, an increase in E. coli O157:H7 and S. Typhimurium at variable temperatures but not at 4°C, and a decrease in C. jejuni in all storage conditions. Boiling milk is effective in making it safe for consumers. This study provides evidence that appropriate handling of raw milk, maintaining low temperatures, together with consumer education concerning boiling raw milk before consumption are key factors in preventing foodborne infections linked to raw milk consumption, and helps assess the risk of foodborne infection linked to raw milk consumption. © Giacometti et al., 2012.},

abstract={Cranioventral pulmonary consolidation (enzootic pneumonia-like lesions) and chronic pleuritis (CP) are common findings in slaughtered pigs. Pleural lesions involving dorsocaudal lobes are suggestive of pleuropneumonia due to Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. In this report the results of an abattoir survey of pleuritis and pulmonary lesions in pigs is presented with a focus on herd risk factors. A total of 4889 animals, ranging in age from 9 to 10. months, from 48 batches of pigs belonging to an equal number of herds, were included in the study. Bronchopneumonic lesions suggestive of enzootic pneumonia (EP-like lesions) were detected in 46.4% of the examined lungs. The EP-like lesion average value for all lungs was 1.03 (95% CI 0.98-1.08), ranging from 0.17 to 2.56 among the 48 batches; 47.5% of lungs showed chronic pleuritis. Dorsocaudal pleuritis suggestive of recovered pleuropneumonia (SPES score ≥2) was found in 25.1% of the lungs. The mean SPES (slaughterhouse pleuritis evaluation system) value of the overall 4889 lungs was 0.83 (95% CI 0.78-0.86). The mean SPES value of the batches ranged from 0.04 to 1.87. The mean Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae index of all studied batches was 0.61 (95% CI 0.51-0.71), ranging from 0 to 1.84.Blood samples were collected from each herd to evaluate antibody titres to Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, A. pleuropneumoniae, Aujeszky's disease virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and swine influenza virus. Herd characteristics were recorded using a questionnaire given to the farmers. A multivariable analysis was conducted to identify risk factors for pleuritis and EP-like lesions. High dorsocaudal pleuritis was associated with A. pleuropneumoniae seroprevalence and history of A. pleuropneumoniae isolation from pneumonic lungs of dead animals. Vaccination of weaners at 3-5. weeks of age against PRRS using a modified live vaccine was associated with a reduction in the percentage of cranioventral pulmonary consolidation (EP-like lesions). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of cleanliness of cattle slaughtered on hide and carcass contamination as indicated by aerobic colony count (ACC) and Enterobacteriaceae count (EC). Cattle in two slaughterhouses were visually inspected and assigned to a category from 1 (very clean) to 5 (very dirty) based on cleanliness. Fifteen animals for each category were randomly selected in each slaugterhouse and the hides and carcasses sampled and analyzed for ACC, EC. Results showed that the increasing dirt of the cattle was associated with higher ACC and EC on the hides and with higher ACC on carcasses in both slaughterhouse. In one slaughterhouse a correlation between hide cleanliness and EC was shown. The different characteristics of the slaughterhouses may influence the transfer of bacteria from hide to carcass. The study supports the conclusion that the pre-slaughter visual evaluation of animal cleanliness and application of corrective actions can be an effective aid to reduce carcass contamination in both slaughterhouses.},

abstract={According to Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology, the Rickettsiales are 'bacteria with typical Gram-negative cell walls and no flagella'. The recently sequenced genome of 'Candidatus Midichloria mitochondrii', a divergent lineage within the order Rickettsiales capable of invading mitochondria in ixodid ticks, revealed the presence of 26 putative flagellar genes. Open questions in relation to this observation are whether these genes are expressed and whether they possess the domains expected for the flagellar function. Here we show that: (a) the putative flagellar proteins of 'Ca. M. mitochondrii' actually possess the conserved domains and structural features required for their function in a model bacterium; (b) the seven flagellar genes of 'Ca. M. mitochondrii' that have been tested are expressed at the RNA level; and (c) the putative flagellar cap gene of this bacterium (FliD) is expressed at the protein level, and can be stained within the bacterium and at its surface. Beside the specific questions that we have addressed that relate to the first evidence, to our knowledge, for a flagellar apparatus in a member of the order Rickettsiales, we present here novel tools (recombinant protein and antibodies) that will facilitate the study of 'Ca. M. mitochondrii'. © 2012 SGM.},

abstract={Ticks are the main vectors of rickettsiae of the spotted fever group, as well as of a variety of other Rickettsiales, including bacteria of the genus Anaplasma, that might cause diseases in humans and animals. Here we present the result of a survey for ticks and for tick-associated Rickettsiales in the Emilia Romagna region (Northern Italy). The study was focused on ticks collected from wild-hunted animals. Out of 392 ticks collected from these animals, 282 (72%) were identified as Ixodes ricinus, 110 (28%) as Dermacentor marginatus. The former was found on four vertebrate species, whereas the latter appeared more specific for wild boar. The presence of rickettsiae was demonstrated in 22. 5% of I. ricinus (57/253) and in 29% of D. marginatus (32/110). Five ticks of the species I. ricinus were also positive for Anaplasma phagocytophilum (2%). In addition, we collected ticks by dragging in a natural park of the same region. All of the ticks captured by dragging were identified as I. ricinus. Thirty-six out of 200 analyzed ticks proved positive for Rickettsia monacensis and R. helvetica (16. 5 and 1. 5%, respectively). Our results highlight that that ticks present in wild areas, widely exploited for recreation and hunting in Emilia-Romagna, represent a risk for the transmission of spotted fevers and anaplasmosis to humans. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Many studies have focused on the transport of cattle to fattening farms or to slaughterhouses but there is little information concerning the transport of young bulls delivered to the genetic test stations for selection. Due to the high expected value of young AI candidate bulls, their transport conditions could be very different from those intended for other cattle categories. The objective of the present study was to examine the effect of transport on behavioural response and on some blood variables of 26 young Holstein bulls (mean weight kg 278±64) before, during and after short journeys (duration &lt;8h) to a genetic test centre. Behavioural patterns such as agonistic and affiliative interactions, environmental and conspecific explorative behaviour were recorded by means of an instantaneous sampling method at the farms of origin, into the truck and at the genetic test station. Moreover, standing orientation and postures during transport were recorded. Blood samples were collected by jugular venipuncture before transport (-4 days, T-4), immediately after transport (day 0, T0) and at 4 days (T+4) relative to time day 0. The space allowance during transport, ranging from 1.50m 2 to 3.75m 2 per head, enabled the animals to move quite freely and adopt comfortable positions. Young bulls did not show any preferences in their standing orientation during journeys and they were observed in a lying position for short time periods; they were also observed to ruminate, especially during the stationary periods of the journey. Mixing of animals during journeys did not affect their behaviour. The agonistic behaviour rate was higher during transport (P=0.049) and in the first two hours after unloading (P=0.003) than on the rearing farms. Four days after transport, agonistic behaviour decreased compared to the level observed during the first two hours after unloading (P=0.003), whereas affiliative behaviours increased (P=0.023); however, since the hourly rate of agonistic interactions remained higher than the rate observed on the farms of origin (P=0.001), we postulate that hierarchical relationships were not well established yet. After unloading, all animals spent more time interacting with others than exploring their new pen. Plasma glucose and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations both increased significantly after transport. There were no changes in the activity of plasma creatine kinase (CK) after transport, suggesting that the journeys did not cause physical exertion. The results indicate that the transport conditions adopted for the AI candidate bulls only slightly affected the behavioural response and blood variables examined here and could be considered satisfactory for their welfare. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Specific bacterial infections or alterations of the gut microbiota likely trigger immuno-pathological phenomena associated with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis is a candidate etiological agent of Crohn's disease. Definitive causal connection between Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis infection and Crohn's disease has not been demonstrated. Aims: To determine the circulation of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis in Crohn's disease patients and water supplies in an Italian region where this bacterium is endemic in cattle farms. Methods: Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis screening was performed on biopsies from human patients, and from water samples, using two different PCR procedures. Results: In hospitals where multiple specimens were obtained from different sites in the intestine, the prevalence of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis infection was 82.1% and 40% respectively in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients; in another hospital, where single specimens were obtained from patients, the bacterium was not detected. Control subjects also harboured Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis, but at a lower prevalence. Tap water samples collected in the study area contained Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis DNA. Discussion: The results of screenings for Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis in humans are deeply influenced by both the number and location of the collected biopsies. There is a wide circulation of the organism in the study area, considering the prevalence in humans and its presence in drinking water. © 2012 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.},

This group of strains from the Iberian Peninsula missing spoligotype spacer 21 represents a new clonal complex of M. bovis, defined by the SNP profile with a distinct spoligotype signature.

abstract={The genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae, includes a number of important arthropod-transmitted human pathogens such as dengue viruses, West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and yellow fever virus. In addition, the genus includes flaviviruses without a known vertebrate reservoir, which have been detected only in insects, particularly in mosquitoes, such as cell fusing agent virus, Kamiti River virus, Culex flavivirus, Aedes flavivirus, Quang Binh virus, Nakiwogo virus and Calbertado virus. Reports of the detection of these viruses with no recognized pathogenic role in humans are increasing in mosquitoes collected around the world, particularly in those sampled in entomological surveys targeting pathogenic flaviviruses. The presence of six potential flaviviruses, detected from independent European arbovirus surveys undertaken in the Czech Republic, Italy,Portugal, Spain and the UK between 2007 and 2010, is reported in this work. Whilst the Aedes flaviviruses, detected in Italy from Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, had already been isolated in Japan, the remaining five viruses have not been reported previously: one was detected in Italy, Portugal and Spain from Aedes mosquitoes (particularly from Aedes caspius), one in Portugal and Spain from Culex theileri mosquitoes, one in the Czech Republic and Italy from Aedes vexans, one in the Czech Republic from Aedes vexans and the last in the UK from Aedes cinereus. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the close relationship of these putative viruses to other insect-only flaviviruses. © 2012 Crown.},

abstract={Background: In 2008, after the first West Nile virus (WNV) detection in the Emilia-Romagna region, a surveillance system, including mosquito- and bird-based surveillance, was established to evaluate the virus presence. Surveillance was improved in following years by extending the monitoring to larger areas and increasing the numbers of mosquitoes and birds tested. Methodology/Principal Findings: A network of mosquito traps, evenly distributed and regularly activated, was set up within the surveyed area. A total of 438,558 mosquitoes, grouped in 3,111 pools and 1,276 birds (1,130 actively sampled and 146 from passive surveillance), were tested by biomolecular analysis. The survey detected WNV in 3 Culex pipiens pools while Usutu virus (USUV) was found in 89 Cx. pipiens pools and in 2 Aedes albopictus pools. Two birds were WNV-positive and 12 were USUV-positive. Furthermore, 30 human cases of acute meningoencephalitis, possibly caused by WNV or USUV, were evaluated for both viruses and 1,053 blood bags were tested for WNV, without any positive result. Conclusions/Significance: Despite not finding symptomatic human WNV infections during 2010, the persistence of the virus, probably due to overwintering, was confirmed through viral circulation in mosquitoes and birds, as well as for USUV. In 2010, circulation of the two viruses was lower and more delayed than in 2009, but this decrease was not explained by the relative abundance of Cx. pipiens mosquito, which was greater in 2010. The USUV detection in mosquito species confirms the role of Cx. pipiens as the main vector and the possible involvement of Ae. albopictus in the virus cycle. The effects of meteorological conditions on the presence of USUV-positive mosquito pools were considered finding an association with drought conditions and a wide temperature range. The output produced by the surveillance system demonstrated its usefulness and reliability in terms of planning public health policies. © 2012 Calzolari et al.},

abstract={Three subtypes (H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2) are currently diffused worldwide in pigs. The H1N2 subtype was detected for the first time in Italian pigs in 1998. To investigate the genetic characteristics and the molecular evolution of this subtype in Italy, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of whole genome sequences of 26 strains isolated from 1998 to 2010. Phylogenetic analysis of HA and NA genes showed differences between the older (1998-2003) and the more recent strains (2003-2010). The older isolates were closely related to the established European H1N2 lineage, whereas the more recent isolates possessed a different NA deriving from recent human H3N2 viruses. Two other reassortant H1N2 strains have been detected: A/sw/It/22530/02 has the HA gene that is closely related to H1N1 viruses; A/sw/It/58769/10 is an uncommon strain with an HA that is closely related to H1N1 and an NA similar to H3N2 SIVs. Amino acid analysis revealed interesting features: a deletion of two amino acids (146-147) in the HA gene of the recent isolates and two strains isolated in 1998; the presence of the uncommon aa change (N66S), in the PB1-F2 protein in strains isolated from 2009 to 2010, which is said to have contributed to the increased virulence. These results demonstrate the importance of pigs as mixing vessels for animal and human influenza and show the presence and establishment of reassortant strains involving human viruses in pigs in Italy. These findings also highlighted different genomic characteristics of the NA gene the recent Italian strains compared to circulating European viruses. © 2011.},

abstract={The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance rates and the trend in resistance of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae isolated from pigs in Italy from 1994 to 2009. A total of 992 A. pleuropneumoniae isolates were tested for their susceptibility to a panel of antimicrobial agents in a disk diffusion method. Resistance to 7 drugs (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefquinome, cotrimoxazole, penicillin G and tilmicosin) showed a significant increasing trend over the time, while for 2 drugs (gentamycin and marbofloxacin) a significant decrease was observed. Resistance to the remaining 14 antimicrobial agents tested did not change significantly over the study period. Most of the isolates retained high susceptibility to antimicrobials usually effective against A. pleuropneumoniae such as amphenicols, fluoroquinolones and ceftiofur. However, high rates of resistance were observed for potentiated sulfa drugs, tetracyclines and penicillins which are currently recommended antimicrobials for pig pleuropneumonia therapy. Our results suggest the importance of continued monitoring of A. pleuropneumoniae clinical isolates in order to choose the most appropriate treatment of infections and to control the increase of resistance to currently used antimicrobials. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Diagnosis of West Nile virus (WNV) infections is often difficult due to the extensive antigenic cross-reactivity among flaviviruses, especially in geographic regions where two or more of these viruses are present causing sequential infections. The purpose of this study was to characterize a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) produced against WNV to verify their applicability in WNV diagnosis and in mapping epitope targets of neutralizing MAbs. Methods. Six MAbs were produced and characterized by isotyping, virus-neutralization, western blotting and MAb-epitope competition. The MAb reactivity against various WNVs belonging to lineage 1 and 2 and other related flaviviruses was also evaluated. The molecular basis of epitopes recognized by neutralizing MAbs was defined through the selection and sequencing of MAb escape mutants. Competitive binding assays between MAbs and experimental equine and chicken sera were designed to identify specific MAb reaction to epitopes with high immunogenicity. Results: All MAbs showed stronger reactivity with all WNVs tested and good competition for antigen binding in ELISA tests with WNV-positive equine and chicken sera. Four MAbs (3B2, 3D6, 4D3, 1C3) resulted specific for WNV, while two MAbs (2A8, 4G9) showed cross-reaction with Usutu virus. Three MAbs (3B2, 3D6, 4D3) showed neutralizing activity. Sequence analysis of 3B2 and 3D6 escape mutants showed an amino acid change at E307 (Lys Glu) in the E protein gene, whereas 4D3 variants identified mutations encoding amino acid changed at E276 (Ser Ile) or E278 (Thr Ile). 3B2 and 3D6 mapped to a region on the lateral surface of domain III of E protein, which is known to be a specific and strong neutralizing epitope for WNV, while MAb 4D3 recognized a novel specific neutralizing epitope on domain II of E protein that has not previously been described with WNV MAbs. Conclusions: MAbs generated in this study can be applied to various analytical methods for virological and serological WNV diagnosis. A novel WNV-specific and neutralizing MAb (4D3) directed against the unknown epitope on domain II of E protein can be useful to better understand the role of E protein epitopes involved in the mechanism of WNV neutralization. © 2012 Lelli et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of long-distance road transport (19 h, from Poland to Italy) during 2 seasons (summer vs. winter) on clinical and hematological variables in calves. The environmental temperature range that could compromise the thermoregulation system (thermal stress) of the calves was tested. For the 7 Holstein calves in each transport, the BW and rectal temperature (RT) were measured, and blood samples were collected at the farm of origin, before loading at the transit center (T2), after unloading at the farm of destination (T3), and 1, 2, 3, and 4 d after arrival. The body temperature (BT) and heart rate (HR) were continuously monitored from T2 to T3. The data were statistically analyzed according to a mixed model that considered the fixed effects of transport (repeated measurements), season of journey, and their interaction. Within the observed temperature-humidity index (THI) range (30 to 80), effective thermoregulation allowed the calves to maintain their BT with small physiologic changes to prevent thermal stress, particularly in the summer. With no seasonal differences, the HR was greater at loading than unloading (120 vs. 115 beats per min; P = 0.012). As for the transport effect, the BW was less (P < 0.001) after unloading, and the RT was greater (P = 0.004). This effect was more marked in summer. The hematological variables indicated a moderate effect of transport on the hydration condition, reactive and muscular systems, and metabolism, although hematocrit (P = 0.004), erythrocytes, cortisol, NEFA, β-hydroxybutyrate, lactate, creatine kinase, lactate de-hydrogenase, and aspartate aminotransferase activity (P < 0.001), and total protein (P = 0.007) were greater after unloading. This was confirmed by a moderate decrease in total leukocytes (P = 0.031) and glucose concentration (P = 0.002). The changes in the clinical variables were similar for both seasons even though in the summer, hematocrit (P < 0.001), urea (P = 0.008), and total protein (P = 0.010) increased and glucose concentration (P = 0.038) decreased. In conclusion, the data did not show a pronounced effect attributable to the season of the journey. Long-distance road transport leads to notable changes in clinical and hematological variables at the end of the journey. However, these variables remained within their physiological ranges and returned to basal values within a few days after the journey. © 2012 American Society of Animal Science. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is an emerging disease among wild animals in many parts of the world. Wildlife reservoir hosts may thus represent a potential source of infection for livestock and humans. We investigated the role played by the Sicilian black pig, an autochthonous free-or semi-free-ranging domestic pig breed, as a potential source of bTB infection in an area where bTB prevalence in cattle is high. We initially performed a preliminary field study to assess the occurrence of bTB in such animals. We sampled 119 pigs at abattoir and found 6.7% and 3.4% of them to be affected by gross tuberculous-like lesions (TBL) and Mycobacterium bovis culture positive, respectively. We then proceeded to investigate the dissemination and characteristics of lesions in a second field study performed on 100 animals sampled from infected herds. Here, tissues collected at the abattoir were examined macroscopically, microscopically, and by culture tests. Most pigs with TBL showed generalized lesions in both gross and histological examinations (53% and 65.5%, respectively). Head lymph nodes were the most frequently affected in both localized and generalized TB cases observed macroscopically and microscopically. M. bovis was the most frequently isolated etiologic agent. The molecular characterization of isolates from both field studies by spoligotyping and analysis of 12 mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit-variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) loci, followed by their comparison to isolates of cattle origin, suggested a potential transmission of mycobacteria from domestic animals to black pigs and vice versa. Our findings, along with ethological, ecological, and management considerations, suggest that the black pig might act as a bTB reservoir in the ecosystem under study. However, additional studies will be necessary to establish the true epidemiological significance of the Sicilian black pig. Copyright © 2012, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Susceptibility of sheep to scrapie, a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy of small ruminants, is strongly influenced by polymorphisms of the prion protein gene (PRNP). Breeding programs have been implemented to increase scrapie resistance in sheep populations; though desirable, a similar approach has not yet been applied in goats. European studies have now suggested that several polymorphisms can modulate scrapie susceptibility in goats: in particular, PRNP variant K222 has been associated with resistance in case-control studies in Italy, France and Greece. In this study we investigated the resistance conferred by this variant using a natural Italian goat scrapie isolate to intracerebrally challenge five goats carrying genotype Q/Q 222 (wild type) and five goats carrying genotype Q/K 222. By the end of the study, all five Q/Q 222 goats had died of scrapie after a mean incubation period of 19 months; one of the five Q/K 222 goats died after 24 months, while the other four were alive and apparently healthy up to the end of the study at 4.5 years post-challenge. All five of these animals were found to be scrapie negative. Statistical analysis showed that the probability of survival of the Q/K 222 goats versus the Q/Q 222 goats was significantly higher (p = 0.002). Our study shows that PRNP gene mutation K222 is strongly associated with resistance to classical scrapie also in experimental conditions, making it a potentially positive target for selection in the frame of breeding programs for resistance to classical scrapie in goats. © 2012 Acutis et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Bovine paratuberculosis (ParaTB) also known as Johne's disease, is a contagious fatal disease resulting from infection by Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP). Previous studies have identified loci associated with ParaTB using different measurements to define cases and controls. The objective of this study was to combine the data from two recent studies to identify genetic loci associated with MAP tissue infection and humoral immune response, defined by MAP ELISA-positive cattle, by comparing cases and control animals for one or both measures of infection. Methodology/Principal Findings: The two populations used for the association analyses were a cohort of MAP tissue infected animals and control Holstein cows from the USA and the second cohort composed of ELISA-positive and ELISA-negative Holstein cows from Italy. Altogether 1190 cattle were genotyped with the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip. SNP markers were removed if the minor allele frequency <0.01 or genotyping failure was >5%. Animals were removed with >5% genotyping failure. Whole genome association analyses were conducted with the GRAMMAR-CG method using two different definitions of control populations. Conclusion/Significance: The analyses identified several loci (P<5 e-05) associated with ParaTB, defined by positive ELISA and presence of bacteria in tissue compared to ELISA and tissue negative animals, on chromosomes 1, 12 and 15 and one unassigned SNP. These results confirmed associations on chromosome 12 and the unassigned SNP with ParaTB which had been found in the Italian population alone. Furthermore, several additional genomic regions were found associated with ParaTB when ELISA and tissue positive animals were compared with tissue negative samples. These loci were on chromosomes 1, 6, 7, 13, 16, 21,23 and 25 (P<5 e-05). The results clearly indicate the importance of the phenotype definition when seeking to identify markers associated with different disease responses. © 2012 Minozzi et al.},

abstract={Astroviruses (AstVs) are nonenveloped RNA small round viruses (SRVs) with a genome of 6.87.9 kb. Known avian AstVs are spread worldwide; they have been associated with poult enteritis and mortality syndrome in the United States and reported in Italy in intensive turkey and guinea fowl flocks. Nevertheless, their real prevalence and their pathogenic role in avian enteritis affecting Italian flocks is far from clear. Negative staining electron microscopy (nsEM) is used for the routine diagnosis of avian enteric SRVs, although it cannot distinguish morphologically similar particles. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), and genomic sequencing are now used for this specific purpose. We analyzed 329 samples of chicken, turkey, and guinea fowl intestinal contents from Italian poultry flocks. Most samples were from enteritis outbreaks, but we also included samples from three longitudinal studies (one on 11 broiler flocks and the other two on a guinea fowl flock). We first examined the samples with nsEM. SRVs, including AstVs, are often associated with rotaviruses and were the most commonly detected morphotypes in avian enteric diseases. We then analyzed 124 of the samples with an RT-PCR targeting the open reading frame (ORF)-1b of AstV. This gene codes for an RNA-dependent polymerase. We then sequenced and genetically analyzed the RT-PCR positive samples. Phylogenetic analysis distinguished three defined clusters: the first included guinea fowl AstVs and turkey AstVs-2; the second, chicken AstVs; and the third was formed by avian nephritis viruses (ANVs). No strains clustered with turkey AstVs-1. The results indicate that ORF-1b presents certain genetic variability, even among AstVs from the same species. In longitudinal studies, samples retrieved from the same shed were homogeneous, with some exceptions suggesting possible coexistence of different genetic types in the same unit. The finding of ANV-like viruses in commercial guinea fowls underlines the genetic variability of AstVs and strengthens the hypothesis of a varied intraherd situation. © 2012 American Association of Avian Pathologists.},

abstract={West Nile Disease (WND) has been considered in Italy a re-emerging zoonosis, due to West Nile Virus (WNV) appearance on national territory in summer of 2008, 10 years after the last epidemic outbreak in Tuscany. WNV cycle involves birds and mosquitoes, however several mammals, as humans and horses, can be infected showing influenza-like symptoms and sometimes severe meningoencephalitis. Main objective of veterinary surveillance is the early detection of WNV circulation, in order to manage specific preventive measures. One of the most effective tools for this purpose is the passive surveillance on horses (OM 5/11/2008). Data about WND confirmed cases in horses in Emilia-Romagna region between 2008 and 2010 were examined. Clinical features resulted variable and unspecific. More information and awareness of veterinary practitioners working in the equine field will make this surveillance system more effective for early detection of new cases in the region. The aim of this article is to make available to practitioners some diagnostic tools, useful to identify neurological syndrome and to report suspected cases of WND in horse.},

A thermal camera was placed in front of the pen during the first journey and above the pen during the second. The temperature inside the vehicle was registered throughout the journeys. A positive linear relationship was observed between skin and internal vehicle temperatures with an R 2 of 0.44 and 0.57 in July and September, respectively. The results obtained in this preliminary experiment showed the possibility of recording thermal images of piglets in transit. Thus, thermography, coupled with other body-temperature-recording techniques, could be valuable for assessing the adaptive efforts of pigs to environmental conditions experienced during transport. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

abstract={Background: Most cases of canine chronic intranasal disease cannot be differentiated based on clinical examination alone, and biopsy is often required for a definitive diagnosis. Nonsurgical cytologic and histologic biopsy techniques represent desirable diagnostic approaches. Objective: The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of brush cytology in differentiating non-neoplastic and neoplastic diseases in dogs with chronic intranasal disease. Methods: Cytologic samples of lesions in dogs with chronic intranasal disease were obtained by brushing over a 12-year period. All dogs had complete physical examinations as well as radiographic, rhinoscopic, and cytologic evaluation. Histologic diagnosis, follow-up clinical information, or both were used as the gold standard, and dogs free of disease or with no progression of disease at 1 year were considered negative for neoplasia. Indicators of performance of brush cytology in detecting neoplasia were calculated and included sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and diagnostic odds ratio. Results: Samples of nasal brushings from 138 dogs were evaluated. Of 62 cases of neoplastic disease, true-positive and false-negative diagnoses were made using cytologic evaluation in 44 (71.0%) and 18 (29.0%) cases, respectively. False-negative diagnoses of neoplasia were not attributed to low cellularity, but to the presence of inflammatory cells that masked neoplastic cells. Brush cytology had a sensitivity of 0.71, specificity of 0.99, positive likelihood ratio of 53.94, negative likelihood ratio of 0.29, and diagnostic odds ratio of 188.33. Conclusions: Brush cytology has good diagnostic accuracy for chronic intranasal lesions in dogs. © 2012 American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology.},

All the 13 pigs of the farm, showed cough, fever, inappetence and weakness. At the same time, an unvaccinated worker of the stabling showed influenza-like symptoms. RNAv extracted from two swabs collected from infected pigs resulted positive by Real Time RT-PCR for Influenza A virus. Furthermore, after growth on embryonated eggs, viral isolates were identified by Real Time RT-PCR specific for H1N1 pdm virus and characterized antigenically. Sequencing of the whole genome was also performed. All sera taken from animals and from the worker were tested by a competitive Influenza A ELISA and by the haemoagglutination inhibition test. Serological findings confirmed the circulation of influenza virus H1N1 pdm in pigs and the presence of specific antibodies against H1N1 pdm in human serum. The results of this study seem to support a H1N1 pdm transmission from man to animals showing the importance of serological and virological investigation to control the pig farms and the importance of close cooperation between the different authorities like veterinarian and human public. © 2012 Triveni Enterprises.},

abstract={We investigated the impact of CHIKV strains on some Aedes albopictus (Skuse) reproductive parameters and the possibility of vertical transmission. Two strains were collected in the area where the epidemic occurred in 2007, one isolated from mosquitoes, the other one isolated from a viraemic patient. Different types of blood meals, either infected or non-infected, were offered to Ae. albopictus females, that were then analyzed at increasing time post infection. The virus titre, measured by two RT-PCR methods in the blood meals, influenced the rate of infection and the rate of dissemination of CHIKV in Ae. albopictus body. We found individual variability with respect to the infection/dissemination rates and their latency both considering the female's body and appendages. The hatching rate was significantly lower for the eggs laid by the infected females than for the control eggs, while the mortality during the larval development (from first instar larva to adult emergence) was similar among the progeny of infected and non-infected female groups. Our findings seem to support the hypothesis that the vertical transmission is a rare event under our conditions, and that a certain time period is required in order to get the ovarioles infected. Field observations conducted during the Spring 2008 showed no evidence of the presence of infected overwintering progeny produced by Ae. albopictus females infected during the 2007 outbreak. © 2012 Bellini et al.},

abstract={The amyloidotic form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) termed BASE is caused by a prion strain whose biological properties differ from those of typical BSE, resulting in a clinically and pathologically distinct phenotype. Whether peripheral tissues of BASE-affected cattle contain infectivity is unknown. This is a critical issue since the BASE prion is readily transmissible to a variety of hosts including primates, suggesting that humans may be susceptible. We carried out bioassays in transgenic mice overexpressing bovine PrP (Tgbov XV) and found infectivity in a variety of skeletal muscles from cattle with natural and experimental BASE. Noteworthy, all BASE muscles used for inoculation transmitted disease, although the attack rate differed between experimental and natural cases (~70% versus ~10%, respectively). This difference was likely related to different prion titers, possibly due to different stages of disease in the two conditions, i.e. terminal stage in experimental BASE and pre-symptomatic stage in natural BASE. The neuropathological phenotype and PrP res type were consistent in all affected mice and matched those of Tgbov XV mice infected with brain homogenate from natural BASE. The immunohistochemical analysis of skeletal muscles from cattle with natural and experimental BASE showed the presence of abnormal prion protein deposits within muscle fibers. Conversely, Tgbov XV mice challenged with lymphoid tissue and kidney from natural and experimental BASE did not develop disease. The novel information on the neuromuscular tropism of the BASE strain, efficiently overcoming species barriers, underlines the relevance of maintaining an active surveillance. © 2012 Suardi et al.},

abstract={Cisplatin (cisPt) use in chemotherapy is limited by the occurrence of a severe nephrotoxicity. Both autophagy and apoptosis seem to contribute in kidney response to cisPt, however their cross-talk is still controversial, since the role played by autophagy (cytoprotective or harmful) and the cellular site driving their switch, are still unclear. Here, we used a multidisciplinary approach to study the correlation between autophagy and apoptosis in renal NRK-52E cells exposed to cisPt.We showed two "sensitivity-thresholds" to cisPt, stating whether apoptosis or autophagy would develop: 10. μM dose of cisPt activated autophagy that preserved cell homeostasis; however 3-methyladenine co-administration affected cell viability and induced apoptosis. In contrast, 50. μM cisPt determined cell death by apoptosis, whereas the pre-conditioning with taurine contributed to cell rescue, delaying apoptosis and maintaining autophagy. Hence, autophagy protects NRK-52E cells from cisPt injury. By studying the expression of ER specific hallmarks, such as GRP78, GRP94 and GADD153/CHOP, we found a possible pivotal role of ER signaling modulation in the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis induced by cisPt. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that taurine enhances autophagic protection against apoptosis by reducing ER stress, thus making it possible to develop new strategies to reduce severe cisPt-induced side-effects such as nephrotoxicity. © 2011 Elsevier Inc..},

abstract={Aims: To predict the risk of incursion of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) in livestock in Europe introduced through immature Hyalomma marginatum ticks on migratory birds under current conditions and in the decade 2075-2084 under a climate-change scenario. Methods and Results: A spatial risk map of Europe comprising 14282 grid cells (25×25km) was constructed using three data sources: (i) ranges and abundances of four species of bird which migrate from sub-Saharan Africa to Europe each spring, namely Willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus), Northern wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe), Tree pipit (Anthus trivialis) and Common quail (Coturnix coturnix); (ii) UK Met Office HadRM3 spring temperatures for prediction of moulting success of immature H. marginatum ticks and (iii) livestock densities. On average, the number of grid cells in Europe predicted to have at least one CCHFV incursion in livestock in spring was 1·04 per year for the decade 2005-2014 and 1·03 per year for the decade 2075-2084. In general with the assumed climate-change scenario, the risk increased in northern Europe but decreased in central and southern Europe, although there is considerable local variation in the trends. Conclusions: The absolute risk of incursion of CCHFV in livestock through ticks introduced by four abundant species of migratory bird (totalling 120 million individual birds) is very low. Climate change has opposing effects, increasing the success of the moult of the nymphal ticks into adults but decreasing the projected abundance of birds by 34% in this model. Significance and Impact of the Study: For Europe, climate change is not predicted to increase the overall risk of incursion of CCHFV in livestock through infected ticks introduced by these four migratory bird species. © 2011 Crown Copyright, AHVLA.

abstract={Introduction: Mastitis is one of the main and expensive pathologies in dairy farms. Since several decades, veterinarians and breeders have made considerable efforts to make better hygienic milk quality and to reduce the prevalence especially of contagious mastitis, caused by Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus. On the other hand, the prevalence of environmental mastitis increased. Aim: The aim of the present study is to analyse the frequency trend of mastitis pathogens isolated in 1.186.148 composite or quarter milk samples between 2005 and 2011 in two North Italian Regions. Material and methods:The milk samples were tested by 17 diagnostic laboratories of the Istituto Zooprofilattico Speri-mentale of Lombardia and Emilia Romagna Regions. These two Regions represent 56.6% of Italian milk production, 26.4% of national dairy herds and 46.7% of dairy cows in Italy. Results were recorded as "indicative" (specific bacterial pathogens growth) and "non-indicative" (no growth/contaminated/polymorphous bacterial flora). In samples identified as "indicative", 150 different types of bacteria were isolated and divided into 4 main groups: contagious pathogens, environmental pathogens, minor pathogens and "other". Results:The analysis of the bacteriological results showed interesting epidemiological changes over the time. In fact, the isolation of contagious pathogens, such as Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus decreased from 47,6% in 2005 to 29.3% in 2011; in contrast, the environmental pathogens increased from 23.6% in 2005 to 35.7% in 2011. Even the isolation of minor pathogens had upward trend, increasing from 13% in 2005 to 24.7% in 2011. It is worth of notice that 73% of the milk samples examined gave negative (63%) or contaminated (10%) results to the bacteriological cultures. Discussion: This work highlights the efficacy of control plans for contagious mastitis, but increase of environmental infections, especially attributable to environmental streptococci, reveals inefficiency of environmental hygiene, milking and dry cow period management protocols. The important decrease in isolation of contagious bacteria, especially Streptococcus agalactiae, suggests the possibility of eradicating this pathogen not only from the dairy farm but by entire territorial areas. Conclusions: The large number of samples recorded as "non-indicative" recommends a greater attention by operators to identify cows and mammary quarters to be sampled. The increase of environmental infections suggests a greater work to the veterinarians in developing and applying procedures to control environmental hygiene and to improve the management during the dry period of the dairy cow. The issue of minor pathogens seems to be more difficult and, as there are no defined control plans yet, should be carefully investigated by researchers.},

abstract={Investigations into immune responses are often based upon recovery of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). To this purpose, the recovery of PBMC by gradient centrifugation is labour-intensive and requires a reasonable level of skill by the laboratory technician. Thus, we set out to determine whether laboratory automation equipment could be used for the recovery of PBMC from blood samples of horses, pigs and cattle, based on the Ficoll-Paque gradient centrifugation technique. Mixing of blood samples with PBS, layering of diluted blood onto Ficoll-Paque gradients, recovery of separated PBMC in RPMI 1640 medium were performed using an automated robotic system, the SBF200 (AM Robotic Systems, Warrington, UK) under laminar air flow conditions. Tubes were tagged with bar codes and manually placed after gradient centrifugation into a tube reader to measure the volume and position of the PBMC layer. The results of the automated procedure compared very well to those of the manual one in terms of percent cell recovery, sterility and cell viability. Also, a high throughput of samples could be implemented: with the integration of cell counting it should be possible for 96 blood samples to be processed, including the production of aliquots, by one person in a day. © 2011 The International Alliance for Biological Standardization.},

abstract={Background and aims. We have demonstrated recently that transplantation of placental membrane-derived cells reduces bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice, despite a limited presence of transplanted cells in host lungs. Because placenta-derived cells are known to release factors with potential immunomodulatory and trophic activities, we hypothesized that transplanted cells may promote lung tissue repair via paracrine-acting molecules. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether administration of conditioned medium (CM) generated from human amniotic mesenchymal tissue cells (AMTC) was able to reduce lung fibrosis in this same animal model. Methods. Bleomycin-challenged mice were either treated with AMTC-CM or control medium, or were left untreated (Bleo group). After 9 and 14 days, the distribution and severity of lung fibrosis were assessed histologically with a scoring system. Collagen deposition was also evaluated by quantitative image analysis. Results. At day 14, lung fibrosis scores in AMTC-CM-treated mice were significantly lower (P < 0.05) compared with mice of the Bleo group, in terms of fibrosis distribution [1.0 (interquartile range, IQR 0.9) versus 3.0 (IQR 1.8)], fibroblast proliferation [0.8 (IQR 0.4) versus 1.6 (IQR 1.0)], collagen deposition [1.4 (IQR 0.5) versus 2.0 (IQR 1.2)] and alveolar obliteration [2.3 (IQR 0.8) versus 3.2 (IQR 0.5)]. No differences were observed between mice of the Bleo group and mice treated with control medium. Quantitative analysis of collagen deposition confirmed these findings. Importantly, AMTC-CM treatment significantly reduced the fibrosis progression between the two observation time-points. Conclusions. This pilot study supports the notion that AMTC exert anti-fibrotic effects through release of yet unknown soluble factors. © 2012 Informa Healthcare.},

abstract={Here we describe an outbreak of European brown hare syndrome (EBHS) in a captive hare population. The EBHS outbreak occurred in March 2009, at the beginning of the breeding season. Overall mortality was 53% out of an original population of 61 animals. Animals between five and eleven months showed a significantly higher mortality rate than other age classes. Pregnant females either aborted their foetuses and survived or died pregnant. All foetuses (n=10) of the pregnant hares were PCR positive for EBHSV. Only one offspring born during the outbreak survived. Shortly after the outbreak, the surviving hares developed a specific anti-EBHSV titre between 1:80 and 1:2560, which dropped to 1:10-1:160 nine months later. Hares between one and three years of age developed a significantly higher titre than hares younger than one year or older than four years. Offspring born after the outbreak showed a lower titre of 1:10, indicating passive antibody transfer via placenta and milk. After two months, the titre was not detectable any longer. In December 2009, the captive population was vaccinated against EBHS virus with inactivated virus prepared from the organs of infected hares. The titres after the first vaccination ranged from 1:10 to 1:640, and after the second vaccination from 1:10 to 1:320. To estimate the effect of EBHS on reproduction, we compared the breeding seasons 2008 and 2009. Several possible sources of infection of the colony are discussed, but the definite cause could not be determined. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Infectious diseases inflict heavy economic losses in cattle, although they are primarily preventable by vaccination. Among the different types of vaccines available, DNA immunization is one of the most recent and technologically advanced strategies to immunize against a highly prevalent infectious agent: bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1). In the last ten years, DNA technology has offered the opportunity to retain the advantage of recombinant expression of immunodominant antigens while overcoming safety issues and logistical inconveniences inherent to live replicating vectors. Different studies on DNA vaccines against BoHV-1 have been based on expression of gD gene with a truncated trans-membrane domain. The immunizing DNA can be inoculated by conventional route (syringes) or by gene guns and with electroporation system, in order to increase the humoral and cell mediated immune responses. Different adjuvants have been inserted in DNA vaccines. However, the mechanism of action of these adjuvants is not yet completely understood and it is known that different adjuvants use different ways of estimulating the immune system. The expressed proteins can readily go through processing and presentation via class II and class I pathways, which will result in induction of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. DNA vaccines present, howler, several inconveniences, for instance, they can stimulate immunity exclusively against proteins but not against polysaccharides; thus, at present time there is not valid practical option for polysaccharide-based-vaccines. Safety is a strong qulity of DNA vaccines: as there is no complete homology between mammalian cells and plasmid DNA occurrence of a homologous recombination is highly unlikely. However, the possibility of random integration of DNA into the host genome is a valid concern although no adverse feature of that sort has been reported so far. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract={In April 2009, a novel H1N1 influenza A virus (pH1N1) was recognized as the cause of the flu pandemic in humans. Here, we report the isolation of pH1N1 virus from the lung homogenates of two cats, which died after severe respiratory symptoms. The cats belonged to a cat colony consisting of 90 caged cats and were found dead following a 2-week period of respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases in the colony. During the outbreak, 25 cats died and 50% of the animal colony showed anorexia, depression, respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. Histological examination of the lungs of the two tested cats displayed lesions centred on terminal airways with epithelial bronchiolar hyperplasia and alveolar necrosis. Influenza A virus was detected in the lung tissues by immunohistochemistry and real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR). Partial sequences of haemagglutinin (HA) genes and complete sequences of neuraminidase (NA) genes of the two isolates displayed high similarity to the pH1N1 viruses circulating in humans (99% for HA gene and 100% for NA gene). To determine whether the pandemic virus had circulated among cats, serum samples and pharyngeal swabs were collected from 38 cats of the colony. Serum samples were tested by ELISA to detect antibodies against pH1N1 nucleoprotein and by hemagglutination-inhibition test, while pharyngeal swabs were examined by pH1N1 specific rRT-PCR. Twenty-one (55%) of the tested cats carried antibodies against the isolated strain and two swabs were positive for the presence of pH1N1 RNA. Our results confirm that the pH1N1 virus was able to infect cats and raise the hypothesis of the circulation of the virus within the colony being due to cat-to-cat transmission. The case reported here provides, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first description of the pH1N1 infection involving numerous cats that lived in a restricted area with limited contact with humans. © 2011 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={The management of dog behavioural problems requires the expertise of professionals such as the veterinary behaviourist. Clinical assessment of behavioural disorders allows the veterinary behaviourist to formulate a diagnosis and prescribe a behavioural and/or pharmacological therapy. The objective of such therapy is to produce a stable change in the perception of a stimulus and the resulting emotion, leading to the correction of the behavioural problem. It may be crucial to evaluate the subject's pathological state in response to the observed symptoms in order to identify the functional impairment of the pivotal neurotransmitter systems involved in the disorder. This allows selecting a suitable pharmacological treatment. In order to implement behavioural therapy, the veterinary behaviourist collaborates, where necessary, with a team of qualified canine trainers.},

abstract={Background: Mesenchymal stromal cells may represent an ideal candidate to deliver anti-cancer drugs. In a previous study, we demonstrated that exposure of mouse bone marrow derived stromal cells to Doxorubicin led them to acquire anti-proliferative potential towards co-cultured haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). We thus hypothesized whether freshly isolated human bone marrow Mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and mature murine stromal cells (SR4987 line) primed in vitro with anti-cancer drugs and then localized near cancer cells, could inhibit proliferation. Methods and Principal Findings: Paclitaxel (PTX) was used to prime culture of hMSCs and SR4987. Incorporation of PTX into hMSCs was studied by using FICT-labelled-PTX and analyzed by FACS and confocal microscopy. Release of PTX in culture medium by PTX primed hMSCs (hMSCsPTX) was investigated by HPLC. Culture of Endothelial cells (ECs) and aorta ring assay were used to test the anti-angiogenic activity of hMSCsPTX and PTX primed SR4987(SR4987PTX), while anti-tumor activity was tested in vitro on the proliferation of different tumor cell lines and in vivo by co-transplanting hMSCsPTX and SR4987PTX with cancer cells in mice. Nevertheless, despite a loss of cells due to chemo-induced apoptosis, both hMSCs and SR4987 were able to rapidly incorporate PTX and could slowly release PTX in the culture medium in a time dependent manner. PTX primed cells acquired a potent anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic activity in vitro that was dose dependent, and demonstrable by using their conditioned medium or by co-culture assay. Finally, hMSCsPTX and SR4987PTX co-injected with human cancer cells (DU145 and U87MG) and mouse melanoma cells (B16) in immunodeficient and in syngenic mice significantly delayed tumor takes and reduced tumor growth. Conclusions: These data demonstrate, for the first time, that without any genetic manipulation, mesenchymal stromal cells can uptake and subsequently slowly release PTX. This may lead to potential new tools to increase efficacy of cancer therapy. © 2011 Pessina et al.},

abstract={In recent years, West Nile virus (WNV) has re-emerged in the Western Mediterranean region. As a result, the number of complete WNV genome sequences available from this region has increased, allowing more detailed phylogenetic analyses, which may help to understand the evolutionary history of WNV circulating in the Western Mediterranean. To this aim, the present work describes six new complete WNV sequences from recent outbreaks and surveillance in Italy in 2008-2009 and in Spain in 2008 and 2010. Comparison with other sequences from different WNV clusters within lineage 1 (clade 1a) confirmed that all Western Mediterranean WNV isolates obtained since 1996 (except one from Tunisia, collected in 1997) cluster in a single monophyletic group (here called 'WMed' subtype). The analysis differentiated two subgroups within this subtype, which appear to have evolved from earlier WMed strains, suggesting a single introduction in the area, and further dissemination and evolution. Close similarities between WNV variants circulating in consecutive years, one in Spain, between 2007 and 2008, and another in Italy between 2008 and 2009, suggest that the virus possibly overwinters in Western Mediterranean sites. The NS3 249 -proline genotype, recently proposed as a virulence determinant for WNV, has arisen independently at least twice in the area. Overall, these results indicate that the frequent recurrence of outbreaks caused by phylogenetically homogeneous WNV in the Western Mediterranean since 1996 is consistent with a single introduction followed by viral persistence in endemic foci in the area, rather than resulting from independent introductions from exogenous endemic foci. © 2011 SGM.},

abstract={A few studies provided convincing evidence of constitutive expression of type I interferons (IFNs) in humans and mice, and of the steady-state role of these cytokines under health conditions. These results were later confirmed in pigs, too. In line with this tenet, low levels of IFN-α/β can be detected in swine tissues in the absence of any specific inducer. These studies are compounded by the utmost complexity of type I IFNs (including among others 17 IFN-α genes in pigs), which demands proper research tools. This prompted us to analyse the available protocols and to develop a relevant, robust, reverse transcription (RT) real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection system for the amplification of porcine IFN-α/β genes. The adopted test procedure is user-friendly and provides the complete panel of gene expression of one subject in a microtitre plate. Also, a proper use of PCR fluorochromes (SYBR® versus EvaGreen® supermix) enables users to adopt proper test protocols in case of low-expression porcine IFN-α genes. This is accounted for by the much higher sensitivity of the test protocol with EvaGreen® supermix. Interestingly, IFN-β showed the highest frequency of constitutive expression, in agreement with its definition of 'immediate early' gene in both humans and mice. Results indicate that the outlined procedure can detect both constitutively expressed and virus-induced IFN-α/β genes, as well as the impact of environmental, non-infectious stressors on the previous profile of constitutive expression. © 2011 The Authors.

The standard curve designed for the quantification of parasites showed linearity over seven log DNA concentration range with a correlation coefficient >0.999 and both intra- and inter-assay variability demonstrated the high efficiency and reproducibility of the assay. The qPCR also proved to be successfully applicable to different clinical samples including blood, bone marrow, lymph node aspirates and conjunctival swabs. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Paratuberculosis is a chronic granulomatous infection caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) that affects multiple ruminant species causing important economic losses. Therefore, control programmes at herd and regional levels have been established worldwide and prevalence estimates are needed for their implementation. Although different herd-level prevalence estimations for paratuberculosis have been reported in Europe, very few studies provided comparable and interpretable values, due to poor study designs and lack of knowledge about the accuracy of the diagnostic tests used. To overcome these problems we applied a latent class analysis to the results of two prevalence studies carried out in two neighbouring Northern Italian regions (Lombardy and Veneto) that account for over 50% of the Italian dairy cattle population. Serum samples from a randomly selected number of farms in the two regions were analyzed by different ELISA tests. The herd-level Apparent Prevalences (AP) were 48% (190/391) for Lombardy and 65% (272/419) for Veneto. Median within-herd APs were 2.6% and 4.0% for Lombardy and Veneto, respectively. Posterior estimates for the herd-level True Prevalences (TP) based on a Bayesian model were very similar between the two regions (70% for Lombardy and 71% for Veneto) and close to previous estimates of infected herds in Europe. The two 95% credibility intervals overlap each other, virtually showing only one distribution of the herd-level true prevalence for both regions. On the contrary, estimates of the within-herd TP distributions differed between the two regions (mean values: 6.7% for Lombardy and 14.3% for Veneto), possibly due to the different age distribution within the herds from the two regions. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This report describes an outbreak of Mycoplasma bovis mastitis affecting 45 cows in a herd of 122 dairy cattle in Northern Italy. Clinically, the outbreak was characterized by agalactia, multiple swollen and painless quarters, high milk somatic cell count and unresponsiveness to conventional antibiotic therapy. M. bovis was isolated from the milk samples of all the 32 affected cows tested and from the mammary tissue of three affected cows that underwent necropsy. No other pathogens were isolated from these samples. Lesions in two of the necropsied cows were characterized by mild chronic suppurative mastitis and galactophoritis. The other necropsied cow showed a chronic necrosuppurative and pyogranulamaous galactophoritis, a condition not previously associated with M. bovis. M. bovis was detected immunohistochemically in the lumen of the affected mammary ducts suggesting that ascending infection via the teat canal was the likely route of transmission. No other intralesional pathogens were demonstrated microscopically. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map) is the etiological agent of paratuberculosis. The aim of our study was to combine Mini-and Microsatellite loci analysis in order to explore the effectiveness of this sub-typing method in a group of Map isolates. For this purpose, 84 Italian Type C Map isolates, each from a different cattle herd, were submitted to MIRU-Variable-Number Tandem-Repeats (VNTRs) typing and Short Sequence repeats (SSRs) sequencing. Moreover, the method was used to analyse the variability inside 10 herds (from three to 50 isolates per herd).Results: The molecular sub-typing, carried out using three SSR and 10 MIRU-VNTR loci, differentiated the 84 isolates into 33 clusters, reaching a Simpson's Discriminatory Index (SID) value of 0.952 (0.933 to 0.972, 95% confidence intervals). Among all considered loci, six (SSR2, MIRU2, SSR1, SSR8, VNTR3527 and VNTR1067) showed relevant allelic variability. Thirty-eight% of the isolates were clustered into four genotypes, differing from each other for the SSR2 locus. The other isolates, characterised by differences in two or more loci, were spread among the rest of the clusters. The intra-herd analysis revealed more than one genotype in most herds with a similar distribution of clusters.Conclusions: Our results revealed the advantage of using both Mini-and Microsatellite approaches for successfully discriminating among Map Type C isolates from the same geographic area, host species and herd. These data suggest that the combination of loci here proposed could be a useful molecular tool for regional epidemiological studies. © 2011 Ricchi et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={In dogs Helicobacter spp. are found in all gastric regions usually localized in the surface mucus, gastric glands and parietal cells. The aim of this study was to detail the distribution of Helicobacter spp. in the fundic mucosa of asymptomatic Beagle dogs and their intracellular localization within parietal cells, in order to evaluate species-specific pathogenetic effects on gastric cells. The presence of Helicobacter spp. was investigated by immunohistochemistry, TEM, and PCR in the fundic mucosa of six Beagle dogs. Helicobacter spp. were found in all dogs examined, and H. bizzozeronii and H. felis were identified by PCR and confirmed by TEM. In the lumen of the fundic glands, co-localization was common. H. bizzozeronii was present in larger numbers than H. felis in both intraluminal and intraparietal localization. The amounts of H. bizzozeronii were similar in superficial and basal portions of the glands. H. felis was predominantly localized in the superficial portions of gastric glands but almost absent from the base. Within parietal cells, most Helicobacter organisms were intracanalicular, but intact and degenerate Helicobacter organisms were also visualized free in the cytoplasm or in secondary lysosomes. No specific degenerative lesions were found in infected parietal cells. Helicobacter organisms were also observed within macrophages in the lamina propria. In conclusion, there is a differential distribution of H. bizzozeronii and H. felis in the fundic mucosa of Beagle dogs, and their intracellular localization in parietal cells and macrophages suggests novel pathogenic scenarios for the development of immune response and maintenance of chronic gastritis in dogs. © 2011 Lanzoni et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

The results showed that the method was suitable for statutory residue testing regarding the following performance characteristics: instrumental linearity, specificity, precision (repeatability and intra-laboratory reproducibility), recovery, decision limit (CCα), detection capability (CCβ) and ruggedness. All the corticosteroids can be detected at a concentration around 1μgkg-1; the recoveries were above 62% for all the analytes.

abstract={A confirmatory method for the determination of residues of eleven coccidiostats including ionophore antibiotics: lasalocid, maduramycin, monensin, narasin, salinomycin, semduramycin and chemical coccidiostats: decoquinate, diclazuril, halofuginone, nicarbazin and robenidine in poultry eggs was developed and validated. The sample was extracted with acetonitrile, defatted with hexane and cleaned-up on a silica SPE cartridge. The analytes were identified and quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The method performance characteristics required by Commission Decision 2002/657/EC were estimated adopting a more flexible and simple validation design. In this alternative approach the experimental study focuses on a larger dynamic range with progressively increasing validation levels. Each of them presents equal concentrations of all the analytes. On the contrary the classical Decision plan investigates a restricted concentration range necessarily different for each analyte being determined by the individual permitted limit (0.5-1.5 times the permitted limit). As a consequence each validation level involves the simultaneous fortification with complex mixtures containing different concentrations of each analyte. Adopting this alternative strategy the validation of several substances with significantly different permitted limits is considerably simplified and a deeper knowledge of the method is achieved. The results proved that the method enables the confirmation of regulated coccidiostats in eggs at the levels required in the official control of residues (CCα in the range of 2.2-174μgkg-1, depending on the coccidiostat). The repeatability (CVr in the range of 1.1-19%) and within-laboratory reproducibility (CVRw in the range of 1.8-30%) are also acceptable. The procedure was successfully verified in the proficiency test and implemented in the national residue control plan. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Mercuric chloride (HgCl2) causes acute oxidant renal failure that affects mainly proximal tubules. Schisandrin B (Sch B), an active lignan from the fruit of Schisandra chinensis, has been successfully used to treat gentamicin nephrotoxicity, but its role against mercury damage is still largely unknown. Here we analysed in vivo and in vitro the efficacy of Sch B supplementation against HgCl2 nephrotoxicity, focusing on histopathology, stress proteins, oxidative (cytochrome c oxidase) and nitrosactive markers (eNOS, nNOS).Wistar rats were treated with Sch B (10mg/kg/day p.o.) or vehicle (olive oil) for 9 days, then coadministered with a single HgCl2 nephrotoxic dose (3.5mg/kg i.p.) and killed after 24h. The tubular and mitochondrial damage induced by mercury was limited by Sch B coadministration in vivo. Remarkably, after Sch B and mercury challenge, HSP25, HSP72, GRP75 were reduced in the renal cortex, cytochrome c oxidase increased and eNOS and nNOS were restored in glomeruli. In contrast, NRK-52E proximal tubular cells treated with Sch B 6.25μM plus HgCl2 20μM did not show any amelioration on viability and oxidative stress in respect to HgCl2 20μM alone. Moreover, after Sch B plus mercury in vitro treatment, HSP72 staining persisted while HSP25 further increased. Thus, in our experimental conditions, Sch B cotreatment afforded better protection against mercury poisoning in vivo than in vitro. This discrepancy might be partly attributable to Sch B influence on glomerular perfusion as corroborated by the recovery of vasoactive markers like macular and endothelial nitric oxide isoforms. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

As this virus does not replicate in cell culture systems, the capsid protein gene has been expressed in heterologous hosts or inserted in replication-competent viruses in order to obtain non-conventional RHDV vaccines. However, due to technological or safety issues, current RHDV vaccines are still prepared from organs of infected rabbits. In this work, two human type 5 derived replication-defective adenoviruses encoding the rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus VP60 capsid protein were constructed. The recombinant protein was expressed as a multimer in mouse and rabbit cell lines at levels that ranged from approximately 120 to 160mg/L of culture. Mice intravenously or subcutaneously inoculated with a single 10 8 gene transfer units (GTU) dose of the AdVP60 vector (designed for VP60 intracellular expression) seroconverted at days 7 and 14 post-immunization, respectively. This vector generated a stronger response than that obtained with a second vector (AdVP60sec) designed for VP60 secretion. Rabbits were then immunized by parenteral or mucosal routes with a single 10 9GTU dose of the AdVP60 and the antibody response was evaluated using a competition ELISA specific for RHDV or RHDVa. Protective hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers were also promptly detected and IgG antibodies corresponding with inhibition percentages over 85% persisted up to one year in all rabbits, independently of the immunization route employed. These levels were similar to those elicited with inactivated RHDV or with VP60 obtained from yeast or insect cells. IgA specific antibodies were only found in saliva of rabbits immunized by intranasal instillation. The feasibility of VP60 production and vaccination of rabbits with replication-defective adenoviral vectors was demonstrated. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A two year study (2008-2009) was carried out to monitor the Usutu virus (USUV) circulation in Italy. Sentinel horses and chickens, wild birds and mosquitoes were sampled and tested for the presence of USUV and USUV antibodies within the WND National Surveillance plan. Seroconversion evidenced in sentinel animals proved that in these two years the virus has circulated in Tuscany, Emilia Romagna, Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia regions. In Veneto USUV caused a severe blackbird die-off disease involving at least a thousand birds. Eleven viral strains were detected in organs of 9 blackbirds (52.9%) and two magpies (0.5%) originating from Veneto and Emilia Romagna regions. USUV was also detected in a pool of Culex pipiens caught in Tuscany. According to the alignment of the NS5 partial sequences, no differences between the Italian USUV strains isolated from Veneto, Friuli and Emilia Romagna regions were observed. The Italian North Eastern strain sequences were identical to those of the strain detected in the brain of a human patient and shared a high similarity with the isolates from Vienna and Budapest. Conversely, there were few differences between the Italian strains which circulated in the North Eastern regions and the USUV strain detected in a pool of C. pipiens caught in Tuscany. A high degree of similarity at both nucleotide and amino acid level was also found when the full genome sequence of the Italian North Eastern isolate was compared with that of the strains circulating in Europe. The North Eastern Italian strain sequence exhibited 97% identity to the South African reference strain SAAR-1776. The deduced amino acid sequences of the Italian strain differed by 10 and 11 amino-acids from the Budapest and Vienna strains, respectively, and by 28 from the SAAR-1776 strain. According to this study two strains of USUVs are likely to have circulated in Italy between 2008 and 2009. They have developed strategies of adaptation and evolution to spread into new areas and to become established. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This study used PCR-RFLP to investigate the genetic variability of pmp-encoding genes from fifty-two Chlamydophila abortus (C. abortus) strains originating from abortion cases from various geographical regions and host species. Six primer pairs were used to PCR-amplify DNA fragments encoding eighteen pmps. PCR products were digested using four restriction endonucleases and Bayesian methodologies were used to compare RFLP profiles and assign strains to a RFLP genotype. Strains could be assigned to 2 genotypes in the region encoding pmp18D, 3 genotypes in the regions encoding pmp1A-pmp2B, pmp3E-pmp6H and pmp11G-pmp15G, 4 genotypes in the region encoding pmp7G-pmp10G and 5 genotypes in the region encoding pmp16G-pmp17G. In all regions, the majority of strains (88.4-96.1%) had the same genotype as the reference strain S26/3. No correlation could be made between genotype, host species or geographical origin except for the two variant Greek strains, LLG and POS, which formed a discrete genotype in all pmp-encoding regions except pmp18D. Relative rates of evolution calculated for each pmp-encoding gene locus suggest that differing selective pressures and functional constraints may exist on C. abortus polymorphic membrane proteins. These findings suggest that although intraspecies heterogeneity of pmp-encoding genes in C. abortus is low, the sequence heterogeneity should be an important consideration when using pmps as the basis for novel diagnostics or vaccine development. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A sandwich ELISA using recombinant integrin αvβ6 as a capture ligand and serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) as detecting reagents has been compared with a polyclonal antibody based ELISA (using type-specific rabbit antibodies as capture and guinea pig antibodies as detectors), which is employed routinely at the FAO World Reference Laboratory for Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD), for the identification and serotyping of FMD virus (FMDV). The study used cell culture grown antigens (1351 FMDV positive) derived from suspected cases of vesicular disease collected from 86 countries between 1924 and 2011, those positive for the other vesicular diseases of swine vesicular disease (n= 25) and vesicular stomatitis (n= 45) and negative samples collected from uninfected cell cultures (n= 36). The diagnostic sensitivity of the assays was similar at 98.1% (polyclonal ELISA) compared to 97.9% (integrin/Mab ELISA) but the serotypic-specificity of the latter was vastly superior (96%) to that of the former (61.5%). Reactions with the viruses of swine vesicular disease and vesicular stomatitis, which produce clinically indistinguishable syndromes in pigs and cattle, did not occur. The integrin/Mab ELISA recognized FMDV strains of wide antigenic and molecular diversity of all seven serotypes and although some FMDV isolates were not detected, the greater specificity of the assay, while retaining test sensitivity comparable to the conventional assay, warrants its consideration for adoption for routine diagnostic use. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={We have identified a globally important clonal complex of Mycobacterium bovis by deletion analysis of over one thousand strains from over 30 countries. We initially show that over 99% of the strains of M. bovis, the cause of bovine tuberculosis, isolated from cattle in the Republic of Ireland and the UK are closely related and are members of a single clonal complex marked by the deletion of chromosomal region RDEu1 and we named this clonal complex European 1 (Eu1). Eu1 strains were present at less than 14% of French, Portuguese and Spanish isolates of M. bovis but are rare in other mainland European countries and Iran. However, strains of the Eu1 clonal complex were found at high frequency in former trading partners of the UK (USA, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Canada). The Americas, with the exception of Brazil, are dominated by the Eu1 clonal complex which was at high frequency in Argentina, Chile, Ecuador and Mexico as well as North America. Eu1 was rare or absent in the African countries surveyed except South Africa. A small sample of strains from Taiwan were non-Eu1 but, surprisingly, isolates from Korea and Kazakhstan were members of the Eu1 clonal complex. The simplest explanation for much of the current distribution of the Eu1 clonal complex is that it was spread in infected cattle, such as Herefords, from the UK to former trading partners, although there is evidence of secondary dispersion since. This is the first identification of a globally dispersed clonal complex M. bovis and indicates that much of the current global distribution of this important veterinary pathogen has resulted from relatively recent International trade in cattle. © 2011.},

abstract={The purpose of this study is to highlight how the meat of wild boar (Sus scrofa) is characterized by high fat quality. Numerous studies prove as, in wild animals, meat contains lipid values considerably closer to optimal. The meat of 13 adult wild boars shot down in the province of Bologna, was analyzed with the meat from 3 commercial pigs and from a boar bred in semi-wild state (control).Tests were focused on the anatomical cuts of leg, shoulder and belly and determined the total fat, the saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) and, for the latter, the percentage of omega-3 and omega-6. The results shows a good relationship PUFA/SFA in meat of wild boars (> 0,4), a ratio just over 0,4 in farmed wild boars and a ratio clearly <0,4 in intensive pork. The omega-6/omega-3 ratio too is better compared to commercial pork and boars bred in semi-wild state. However, the data confirm that wild boars present an optimal PUFA/SFA ratio and a better omega-6/omega-3 relationship, as reported in literature. On the base of these data it seems justified to suggest the integration of diet with wild boar meat, given its high nutritional level.},

abstract={The study provides data on two cases of foodborne botulism caused by consumption of commercial vegetable products: artichoke preserve and cream of vegetable soup. By mouse bioassay, Clostridium botulinum toxin in both the suspected food samples was detected and identified as type B toxin. The detection of C. botulinum toxin in the artichoke preserve indicates an inadequate food production technology while the presence of C. botulinum toxin in the vegetable soup appeared to be related to wrong behavior on the part of the consumer and to faulty food preservation. The study confirms that an early identification and reporting of suspected botulism cases is vital in the prevention of accidental widespread outbreaks.},

abstract={Usutu virus (USUV), an African Flavivirus, was detected for the first time in Europe in 2001. This virus had rarely been associated with disease in human but in Emilia-Romagna region USUV-related illnesses were reported in two immunocompromised patients in 2009 and USUV IgG-specific antibodies were recently identified in this region in four healthy blood donors with no history of flavivirus infection. In 2009 and 2010 a widely presence of USUV was detected in Emilia-Romagna region trough a multidisciplinary surveillance system. The circulation of the virus in the environment was demonstrated by the relevant number of PCR-USUV positive mosquito pools, 147 out of 4,900 tested, and PCR-USUV positive birds 23 out of 2,483 tested, while the virus was PCR undetected in the tested human samples from 30 subjects with clinical symptoms of meningoencephalitis. The relevant level of USUV detected in the environment, in mosquitoes and birds, without human detections, suggest a low capability of USUV to infect humans. This capability, though at low level, raising the potential pathogenicity of USUV for humans, at least in immunocompromised individuals, and pointing out the necessity to know the potential circulation of this virus in the environment and to test its presence in the blood bags.},

abstract={An epidemiological survey on canine leishmaniasis (CanL) was performed during a 3-year period (2007-2009) in a public kennel of the Bologna province. The presence of the disease was shown in the canine population for the first time in 2007 by indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). The parasite circulation was confirmed also by direct diagnostic tools, as PCR, cytology and cultural method, performed on different bioptic materials. The parasite was isolated and identified as Leishmania infantum zymodeme MON 1. The serological monitoring was performed also in 2008 and 2009 on animals that previously showed negative or uncertain results. The incidence values calculated by significant seroconversions in IFAT titre ≥1/160, ranged between 4.9% and 6.6%, indicating a stable focus of leishmaniasis. The entomological survey, performed by sticky and CO2-baited traps in 2008, showed the presence of the vector Phlebotomus perfiliewi. This study allowed us to identify a stable focus of CanL in an area that was not considered eco-compatible with the presence of the vector and infection. Our results confirm the northward spread of CanL towards areas not previously affected by autochthonous foci. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: The host mounts an immune response to pathogens, but few data are currently available on the role of host genetics in variation in response to avian influenza (AI). The study presented here investigated the role of the host genetic background in response to in vivo infection with AI virus (AIV). Methods: Experimental lines of chicken and commercial crosses were experimentally infected intratracheally with 103 EID50/bird of A/Chicken/Italy/13474/99 H7N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV). Chickens were genotyped for the Mx polymorphism causing the S631N mutation, and for the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). Whole-genome genotyping was carried out using 60 k Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) array developed by the poultry Genome-Wide Marker-Assisted Selection Consortium (GWMASC). Results: Variability in response of different chicken lines to the HPAIV infections and some degree of resistance to AI were observed: a statistically significant effect of chicken line on the response to infection was found. There was no association between survival in healthy conditions and polymorphisms at the Mx gene and the MHC-B region. The analysis based on the 60 k SNPs provided a good clustering of the chicken lines, but no specific genetic cluster associated with response to AIV was identified. Conclusions: Neither the genotype at the Mx gene or MHC-B locus, nor for SNP spanning the whole-genome identified loci involved in variations to response to AIV infection. These results point towards the possibility that either the genetic factors affecting the response of chickens to the H7N1 HPAIV are weak, or relevant alleles were not segregating in the studied populations. © 2011 Sironi et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={To date, PCV2 infection in domestic pigs and wild boars is widespread worldwide and has been associated with several syndromes, collectively called porcine circovirus diseases (PCVD). They include: postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), porcine dermatitis and nephropathy (PDNS), and, in some cases, porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). PMWS only is considered to have the higher economic impact on pig farms. It is considered a multifactorial disease in which PCV2, in combination with other factors, is able to determine the clinical signs of the disease. Its main clinical signs were observed in piglets and in fattening pigs; wasting is considered to be the major one. This syndrome is diagnosed by detection of histopathological lesions typical of lymphoid tissues and the simultaneous presence of PCV2 antigen. PDNS is a disease characterized by immuno-complexes, fibrino- necrotizing glomerulonephritis and necrotizing vasculitis. These lesions are associated with PCV2, but to date the pathogenetic role of the virus in the development of such lesions has not yet been demonstrated. As to PRDC, the identification of PCV2 in the lungs suggested that the virus could play a kay role in determining it, especially in the presence of a low prevalence of other viral pathogens and/or bacterial. Currently, the clinical signs of PRDC are highly variable and nonspecific. Three vaccines are now available in Europe. Two of them are to be used for piglets only, while the third one is lincensed for both sows and piglets.},

abstract={Canine distemper virus (CDV) infection represents an important conservation threat to many carnivore species and has contributed to the population decline of several wild terrestrial and aquatic mammalian species. Since 2006, the Alpine region of North-Eastern (NE) Italy has been experiencing a severe and widespread outbreak of CDV affecting the wild carnivore population. In this study we performed an extensive phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analysis of CDV identified during the recent wildlife epidemic in the Alpine region. Our analysis yielded data on the evolutionary dynamics of the Alpine wildlife CDV epidemic and revealed the emergence and spread of a single genetic cluster of CDV. The wide distribution of the novel cluster combined with the identification of a specific amino acid mutation, which is believed to increase the ability of the virus to replicate in a wider host range, raises concerns over the possible implications of the spread of this virus on the conservation of endangered wildlife species. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Salmonella enterica serovar Gallinarum is the causative agent of fowl typhoid, a severe disease of poultry, responsible for heavy economic losses. Epidemiologic investigation of fowl typhoid significantly benefits from molecular typing tools, RAPD and PFGE have been proposed for this purpose. PFGE, a well established technique, is still the gold standard among typing methods for most bacteria, including salmonella. Nevertheless, it has some limitations regarding execution and reproducibility, in particular it is labour intensive and requires good technical expertise. Furthermore, it needs accurate standardization and results can be ambiguous to interpret. Such limitations can hamper reproducibility and transfer of results. As a possible alternative to PFGE, multilocus variable-number of tandem-repeats analysis (MLVA) has recently emerged as an effective genotyping method for many bacterial pathogens showing high discriminatory power associated to robustness. We developed a six-loci MLVA protocol for Salmonella Gallinarum and compared it to PFGE performed with SpeI, XbaI and NotI on fifty isolates. The proposed MLVA has a high discriminatory power, equivalent to that of the three-enzyme PFGE (Simpson's index 0.94 for MLVA, 0.93 for three-enzyme PFGE) but it is simpler to perform and straightforward in genotype identification, allowing unambiguous exchange of results. Stability of selected VNTR loci, assessed in vitro and in vivo, is good but not absolute, reflecting the sensitivity of MLVA to detect evolutionary changes of bacteria. Clustering of the isolates as determined by MLVA typing is substantially confirmed by PFGE. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Swine influenza monitoring programs have been in place in Italy since the 1990s and from 2009 testing for the pandemic H1N1/2009 virus (H1N1pdm) was also performed on all the swine samples positive for type A influenza. This paper reports the isolation and genomic characterization of a novel H1N2 swine influenza reassortant strain from pigs in Italy that was derived from the H1N1pdm virus.In May 2010, mild respiratory symptoms were observed in around 10% of the pigs raised on a fattening farm in Italy. Lung homogenate taken from one pig showing respiratory distress was tested for influenza type A and H1N1pdm by two real time RT-PCR assays. Virus isolation was achieved by inoculation of lung homogenate into specific pathogen free chicken embryonated eggs (SPF CEE) and applied onto Caco-2 cells and then the complete genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis was performed from the CEE isolate.The lung homogenate proved to be positive for both influenza type A (gene M) and H1N1pdm real time RT-PCRs. Virus isolation (A/Sw/It/116114/2010) was obtained from both SPF CEE and Caco-2 cells. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all of the genes of A/Sw/It/116114/2010, with the exception of neuraminidase (NA), belonged to the H1N1pdm cluster. The NA was closely related to two H1N2 double reassortant swine influenza viruses (SIVs), previously isolated in Sweden and Italy. NA sequences for these three strains were clustering with H3N2 SIVs. The emergence of a novel reassortant H1N2 strain derived from H1N1pdm in swine in Italy raises further concerns about whether these viruses will become established in pigs. The new reassortant not only represents a pandemic (zoonotic) threat but also has unknown livestock implications for the European swine industry. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Each sample was composed ol three subunits and each ol these was incubated at different temperatures (4° and 10°C). The presence of L. monocytogenes together with other microbiological and physicalchemical parameters were evaluated the last day of the shelf-life period. The presence ot live Listeria Monocytogenes was found in 9 of the 38 samples analysed and 3 of these samples were potentially dangerous lor humans because the L. monocytogenes cell count was higher than the limit fixed by EU Regulations. Only the products with favourable characteristics for L. monocytogenes growth were positive. At the following PCR testing 12 samples were found to be positive for L. monocytogenes The genetic characterization by means of a Riboprinter analyzer emphasized the presence of L. monocytogenes with different genotypic features, showing the need for further investigation in order to understand the behaviour of this food borne pathogen and its epidemiological characteristics.},

abstract={Usutu virus (USUV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus belonging to the Japanese encephalitis serocomplex, recently related to neurological disease in immunosuppressed patients. In the same area of Northern Italy where USUV human cases occurred in 2009, a regional West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance program based on mosquito monitoring and wild birds screening has been implemented since 2008. Mosquito pools and wild birds were tested using three different polymerase chain reactions (Flavivirus, WNV, and USUV). During summer 2009, 56 pools (54 consisting of Culex pipiens and 2 of Aedes albopictus) and 27 pools (Cx. pipiens) out of 1789 mosquito pools were, respectively, USUV and WNV positive. Moreover, out of 1218 wild birds tested, 44 were WNV positive, whereas only 11 birds were USUV positive by polymerase chain reaction. Data collected during 2009 prove a cocirculation of USUV and WNV in Northern Italy, but these two viruses show different incidence values in both mosquitoes and birds, suggesting involvement of different animals (other bird species or mammals) in their natural cycles. The cocirculation of WNV and USUV poses a new potential threat to human health in this area. The extent of WNV surveillance to other Flaviviruses will require new diagnostic procedures able to process a large number of samples in a limited period of time and highlights the importance of developing more specific serological tests that could be used in field. © Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2011.},

abstract={The purpose of this study was to evaluate the time-course of the immune response to a field Porcine Respiratory and Reproductive Syndrome virus (PRRSV) strain in PRRS-naïve, untreated pigs, as well as in four groups of age and breed-matched pigs injected with a live attenuated PRRS vaccine, its adjuvant, an inactivated PRRS vaccine and an irrelevant, inactivated Porcine Circovirus type 2 (PCV2) vaccine, respectively. PRRSV infection was confirmed in all groups by PCR and antibody assays. The antibody response measured by ELISA took place earlier in pigs injected with the live attenuated vaccine, which also developed a much stronger serum-neutralizing antibody response to the vaccine strain. Yet, no clear protection was evidenced in terms of viremia against the field virus strain, which showed 11.1% nucleotide divergence in ORF7 from the vaccine strain. In vitro, the interferon (IFN)-γ response to PRRSV was almost absent on PVD 60 in all groups under study, whereas the prevalence of interleukin (IL)-10 responses to PRRSV was fairly high in PCV2-vaccinated animals, only. Results indicate that distinct patterns of immune response to a field PRRSV strain can be recognized in PRRS-vaccinated and naïve pigs, which probably underlies fundamental differences in the development and differentiation of PRRSV-specific immune effector cells. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The objective was to determine effects of partially replacing Zn, Cu and Mn in sulphate form with organic trace minerals (OTM) during the dry period and lactation on dairy cow productive performance, fertility and health status, while supplying Zn and Cu to meet National Research Council (NRC; 2001) guidelines for lactating Holstein dairy cows in midlactation and Mn above NRC guidelines. At the beginning of the dry period, 296 pregnant Holstein cows were randomized to one of two experimental groups. During the dry phase, cows were fed a diet where Cu, Mn, and Zn were supplied as sulphates (control group) or a diet in which 500. g/kg of Cu, Mn, and Zn was supplied as sulphates and 500. g/kg as OTM (KeyShure™). During lactation, cows that had been previously assigned to the control group were fed, for 240. d, a diet where Cu, Mn, and Zn were supplied as sulphates (control group) while cows which had received OTM during the dry phase were fed a diet in which 250. g/kg of sulphates were replaced with similar amounts of organic Cu, Mn, and Zn (OTM). Cows were housed in a free stall barn with four pens (two pens per treatment). Colostrum from cows fed OTM contained more immunoglobulins (+19%; P < 0.01) whereas OTM supplementation had no effect on the concentration of trace minerals in colostrum. During the first 150. d, OTM increased milk fat content by 4.4% (P < 0.05) while milk yield, protein content and somatic cell count were not influenced by treatment. Because more cows from the OTM group became pregnant between 150 and 240. d, a higher number of services per conception (2.01 versus 2.61 for control and OTM, respectively; P < 0.01) occurred in cows fed OTM. Calf mortality at calving was lower in multiparous cows fed OTM (15.6 versus 5.6% for control and OTM, respectively; P < 0.05) whereas there were no differences in other pathologic events and claw disorders. This study produced evidence that partial substitution of Zn, Cu and Mn sulphates with OTM during the dry phase and lactation resulted in higher colostrum immunoglobulins and milk fat, as well as lower calf mortality at calving. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Probabilistic and kinetic measurements, i.e. growth and survival curves, were collected from the ComBase database (www.combase.cc). Conditions at which selected data used to fit the models were generated covered wide ranges that are relevant to the pork supply chain. Probabilistic and kinetic models were combined to give predictions on the concentration of Salmonella spp. at any stage of the pork supply chain under fluctuating pH, aw and/or temperature. Models were implemented in a user-friendly computing tool freely available from http://www.ifr.ac.uk/safety/SalmonellaPredictions/.

abstract={This study presents the results of the virological surveillance for swine influenza viruses (SIVs) in Belgium, UK, Italy, France and Spain from 2006 to 2008. Our major aims were to clarify the occurrence of the three SIV subtypes - H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2 - at regional levels, to identify novel reassortant viruses and to antigenically compare SIVs with human H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses. Lung tissue and/or nasal swabs from outbreaks of acute respiratory disease in pigs were investigated by virus isolation. The hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) subtypes were determined using standard methods. Of the total 169 viruses, 81 were classified as 'avian-like' H1N1, 36 as human-like H3N2 and 47 as human-like H1N2. Only five novel reassortant viruses were identified: two H1N1 viruses had a human-like HA and three H1N2 viruses an avian-like HA. All three SIV subtypes were detected in Belgium, Italy and Spain, while only H1N1 and H1N2 viruses were found in UK and Northwestern France. Cross-hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests with hyperimmune sera against selected older and recent human influenza viruses showed a strong antigenic relationship between human H1N1 and H3N2 viruses from the 1980s and H1N2 and H3N2 human-like SIVs, confirming their common origin. However, antisera against human viruses isolated during the last decade did not react with currently circulating H1 or H3 SIVs, suggesting that especially young people may be, to some degree, susceptible to SIV infections. © 2009 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={The interferon (IFN)-α response of pigs to the stressing event of early weaning was investigated in a field trial. All the animals under study remained healthy and tested negative for common viral infections. However, a low-titered IFN-α response was detected in many sera by a bioassay on Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells on day +6 after weaning. Porcine IFN-α was unambiguously identified by a neutralization assay on a pool of IFN-α-positive sera. By gel filtration chromatography, the antiviral activity of sera on MDBK cells could be traced back to 3 components of apparent molecular mass 27/18/<14 kDa. Additional components of apparent molecular mass 58 and 41 kDa were revealed by ELISA in Nonidet P-40 lysates of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Also, many pigs tested positive in flow cytometry assays on PBMC for intracellular IFN-α. The expression of porcine IFN-α genes was investigated by reverse transcriptase (RT) real-time polymerase chain reaction at days -1, +6, and +12 with regard to weaning in PBMC of 9 piglets. On days -1 and +12, IFN A5, A6, A12, as well as (in fewer pigs) A1, A7, A11, and A2 genes were shown to be expressed. On the contrary, none of the above genes was expressed on day +6, when plenty of pig sera were IFN-α-positive.

abstract={We have identified a clonal complex of Mycobacterium bovis isolated at high frequency from cattle in Uganda, Burundi, Tanzania, and Ethiopia. We have named this related group of M. bovis strains the African 2 (Af2) clonal complex of M. bovis. Af2 strains are defined by a specific chromosomal deletion (RDAf2) and can be identified by the absence of spacers 3 to 7 in their spoligotype patterns. Deletion analysis of M. bovis isolates from Algeria, Mali, Chad, Nigeria, Cameroon, South Africa, and Mozambique did not identify any strains of the Af2 clonal complex, suggesting that this clonal complex of M. bovis is localized in East Africa. The specific spoligotype pattern of the Af2 clonal complex was rarely identified among isolates from outside Africa, and the few isolates that were found and tested were intact at the RDAf2 locus. We conclude that the Af2 clonal complex is localized to cattle in East Africa. We found that strains of the Af2 clonal complex of M. bovis have, in general, four or more copies of the insertion sequence IS6110, in contrast to the majority of M. bovis strains isolated from cattle, which are thought to carry only one or a few copies.

abstract={Increasingly effective vaccination strategies are needed to counteract the high incidence of contagious diseases associated with intensive swine breeding. Recombinant viral vaccines are a promising new avenue in this direction. Key features of viral vectors suitable for immunoprophylaxis are safety, ease of manipulation and the ability to replicate in a variety of hosts. Most of the above requirements are met by bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4), a non-pathogenic dsDNA virus capable of infecting a broad range of cell types in vitro. Here we report the results of an exploratory study using an engineered BoHV-4 virus (eBoHV-4) expressing two unrelated glycoprotein antigens from bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), to assess the potential of recombinant BoHV-4 as a self-adjuvanted immunogen in pigs. Free eBoHV-4 virions and virions preloaded into homologous swine adipose-derived stromal cells (SADSC) were tested. Neither virus formulation elicited neutralizing anti-BoHV-4 antibodies, nor any disease symptom, yet both induced specific immune responses against the heterologous antigens. However, a much earlier (18 vs 28 days post-infection) and more robust neutralizing response against BVDV and BoHV-1 viruses was elicited by eBoHV-4-preinfected SADSCs compared to free virions. The data validate BoHV-4 as a safe and effective heterologous antigen carrier/producer and identify SADSCs as helpful tools for the formulation of increasingly efficacious recombinant immunogens for pig vaccination. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Every year, the food poisoning affect 380,000 inhabitants in EU. Food safety must be ensured by a preventive approach that modern production techniques are not able to guarantee, so in recent years new methods have been developed to increase levels of food safety. A new approach in this field could be given by the use of bacteriophages as bio scavengers; the FDA has recently regulated the use of bacteriophages in food. In this work we have observed the activity of bacteriophage P100 in relation to different food matrices, artificially contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. The tests carried out show that the bacteriophage P100 is able to contain the growth of Listeria monocytogenes in different substrates examined. Moreover, this activity is extended over the time and isn't affected by low temperature storage.},

abstract={Aim: The study describes the development of a simple and rapid tool to identify yeast-like microalgae belonging to the genus Prototheca.Methods and Results: The method, based on two-step Real Time PCR reaction followed by DNA Resolution Melting Analysis (qPCR/RMA), has been developed using reference strains belonging to both pathogenic (P. zopfii genotype 2, P. wickerhamii and P. blaschkeae) and non-pathogenic species (P. zopfii genotype 1, P. stagnora and P. ulmea). In order to validate the method, seventy recently isolated Prototheca strains were thus tested in parallel with both the first qPCR/RMA and the conventional genotype-specific PCR assay: they were classified as P. zopfii genotype 1, P. zopfii genotype 2 and P. blaschkeae, with a perfect accordance between the two above methodologies. Furthermore, we used the second qPCR/RMA to identify the other species (P. stagnora, P. ulmea and P. wickerhamii), which cannot be discriminated by conventional PCR assay.Conclusions: The assay two-step Real Time PCR is accurate, robust, cost-effective and faster than auxonographical, biochemical or conventional molecular biology methods.Significance and Impact of the Study: the rapid and high throughout two-step qPCR/RMA tool can be usefully used for the identification of clinical and environmental Prototheca species into the framework of the diagnosis of animal (e.g. bovine mastitis) or human protothecosis. © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={Bovine amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy (BASE) is one of the recently discovered atypical forms of BSE, which is transmissible to primates, and may be the bovine equivalent of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD) in humans. Although it is transmissible, it is unknown whether BASE is acquired through infection or arises spontaneously. In the present study, the gene expression of white blood cells (WBCs) from 5 cattle at 1 yr after oral BASE challenge was compared with negative controls using a custom microarray containing 43,768 unique gene probes. In total, 56 genes were found to be differentially expressed between BASE and control animals with a log fold change of 2 or greater. Of these, 39 were upregulated in BASE animals, while 17 were downregulated. The majority of these genes are related to immune function. In particular, BASE animals appeared to have significantly modified expression of genes linked to T- and B-cell development and activation, and to inflammatory responses. The potential impacts of these gene expression changes are described. Copyright © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Sera from 173 hunter-killed wild boars harvested during the 2006-2009 hunting seasons in three Italian regions were tested for antibodies to Chlamydia suis, Chlamydophila pecorum, Chlamydophila abortus, and Chlamydophila psittaci by the microimmunofluorescence test. Antibody titers to chlamydiae ≥1:32 were detected in 110 of the 173 samples tested (63.6%). Specific reactivity could be assessed only in 44 sera with antibody titers to C. suis that were two- to threefold higher than antibody titers against the other chlamydial species; the other 66 sera had similar reactivity against all the chlamydia species tested. Antibody to C. suis was detected in sera from wild boar populations with rare or no known contact with domestic pigs. These results suggest that the wild boar could be a chlamydia reservoir and may acquire chlamydiae independent of contacts with the domestic pig. © Wildlife Disease Association 2011.},

Three additional calves were given the plasmid vector and served as controls. Ninety days after the first vaccination all calves were challenge infected with BoHV-1.All animals developed a severe form of infections bovine rhinotracheitis. Only the calves given the pVAX-tgD co-immunised with pVAX-48CpG (Vaccine B) developed humoral antibodies against BoHV-1 between 56 and 90 days after the first vaccination, whereas in calves of other groups and in the controls, antibodies appeared only after the infection. In the calves vaccinated with either pVAX-tgD (Vaccine A) or pVAX-tgD combined with pVAX-48CpG (Vaccine B), BoHV-1-specific IFN-γ secreting cells were detected in PBMCs 90 days after the first vaccination and their number increased after challenge exposure.

abstract={Background: In recent years human diseases due to mosquito-borne viruses were increasingly reported in Emilia-Romagna region (Italy), from the chikungunya virus in 2007 to the West Nile virus (WNV) in 2008. An extensive entomological survey was performed in 2009 to establish the presence and distribution of mosquito arboviruses in this region, with particular reference to flaviviruses. Methodology/Principal Findings: From May 6 to October 31, a total of 190,516 mosquitoes were sampled in georeferenced stations, grouped in 1,789 pools according date of collection, location, and species, and analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the presence of RNA belong to Flavivirus genus. WNV was detected in 27 mosquito pools, producing sequences similar to those of birds and human strains obtained in 2008 outbreak, pointed out the probable virus overwintering. Isolation of WNV was achieved from one of these pools. Moreover 56 pools of mosquitoes tested positive for Usutu virus (USUV). Most PCR positive pools consisted of Culex pipiens, which also was the most analyzed mosquito species (81.4% of specimens); interestingly, USUV RNA was also found in two Aedes albopictus mosquito pools. Simultaneous circulation of WNV and USUV in the survey area was highlighted by occurrence of 8 mosquito WNV- and USUV-positive pools and by the overlaying of the viruses "hot spots", obtained by kernel density estimation (KDE) analysis. Land use of sampled stations pointed out a higher proportion of WNV-positive Cx. pipiens pool in rural environments respect the provenience of total sampled pool, while the USUV-positive pools were uniformly captured in the different environments. Conclusions/Significance: Obtained data highlighting the possible role of Cx. pipiens mosquito as the main vector for WNV and USUV in Northern Italy, and the possible involvement of Ae. albopictus mosquito in USUV cycle. The described mosquito-based surveillance could constitute the foundation for a public health alert system targeting mosquito borne arboviruses. © 2010 Calzolari et al.},

abstract={Recently, Italy-particularly the Emilia-Romagna region-was the location of consecutive outbreaks of human diseases caused by the arboviruses chikungunya virus and West Nile virus. The two outbreaks, spread by different species of mosquitoes, were not related, but pointed out the lack of an arboviral surveillance program in this region. Beginning in 2007 entomological surveillance was initiated in the Emilia-Romagna region, and in 2008 the program was improved and extended at Lombardia region. Using CO2-baited traps, 65,292 mosquitoes were collected; pooled by date of collection, location, and species; macerated manually; and tested by reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction for the presence of alphaviruses, orthobunyaviruses, and flaviviruses. Amplicons were sequenced and employed for identification of viral RNA by basic local alignment search tool search in GenBank. Results of these assays showed (1) the presence of West Nile virus in two pools of Culex pipiens mosquitoes, (2) the presence of RNA of two orthobunyaviruses, Tahyna virus in a pool of Ochlerotatus caspius mosquitoes and Batai virus in a pool of Anopheles maculipennis mosquitoes, and (3) the presence of flavivirus RNAs in pools of Oc. caspius, Aedes albopictus, and Aedes vexans mosquitoes; the sequences of these amplicons were most closely related to flaviviruses that have been detected only in mosquitoes and had no recognized vertebrate host (Aedes flavivirus, Culex flavivirus, and Kamiti River virus). © Copyright 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract={1. The effect of rabbit population density on transmission of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is a critical aspect of disease ecology for rabbit control and rabbit conservation. We examined the interaction between rabbit control and spread of RHDV and a non-pathogenic calicivirus (bCV) in Australian wild rabbit populations, and reviewed existing recommendations for control in this context.2. Rabbits were sampled at eight pairs of sites; from rabbit populations where densities had been reduced by conventional control and from matching uncontrolled populations. Sites chosen ranged from hot, arid areas where RHDV had greatly reduced rabbit numbers to cooler, higher-rainfall areas where rabbits remained more abundant. Virus activity was implied from antibody profiles in sera of surviving rabbits.3. Reducing population density by conventional control had a similar effect on disease transmission despite a seven-fold difference in initial density. Populations reduced by 70% or more had lower RHDV antibody prevalence in juvenile rabbits but not in adult rabbits, indicating that reducing rabbit density slowed but did not stop RHDV transmission. We found no interactions between rabbit control, RHDV and bCV that could be exploited to improve rabbit management.4. Synthesis and applications. Delayed RHDV infection in rabbit control sites is likely to be offset by higher mortality in older rabbits, so that conventional rabbit control does not reduce the impact of RHDV on rabbit populations. Only minor changes to delay the timing of summer rabbit control programmes in cooler areas of Australia are necessary to take best advantage of RHDV-induced reduction in rabbit numbers. For conservation management of rabbits in Europe, these findings indicate that RHDV may continue to have a severe impact on rabbit populations that have been reduced to low population density, but also raise the possibility that bCVs might be introduced to rabbit populations to aid their recovery. © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={Wild aquatic birds in the Orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes are the main reservoir hosts perpetuating the genetic pool of all influenza A viruses, including pandemic viruses. High viral loads in feces of infected birds permit a fecal-oral route of transmission. Numerous studies have reported the isolation of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) from surface water at aquatic bird habitats. These isolations indicate aquatic environments have an important role in the transmission of AIV among wild aquatic birds. However, the progressive dilution of infectious feces in water could decrease the likelihood of virus/host interactions. To evaluate whether alternate mechanisms facilitate AIV transmission in aquatic bird populations, we investigated whether the preen oil gland secretions by which all aquatic birds make their feathers waterproof could support a natural mechanism that concentrates AIVs from water onto birds' bodies, thus, representing a possible source of infection by preening activity. We consistently detected both viral RNA and infectious AIVs on swabs of preened feathers of 345 wild mallards by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and virus-isolation (VI) assays. Additionally, in two laboratory experiments using a quantitative real-time (qR) RT-PCR assay, we demonstrated that feather samples (n = 5) and cotton swabs (n = 24) experimentally impregnated with preen oil, when soaked in AIV-contaminated waters, attracted and concentrated AIVs on their surfaces. The data presented herein provide information that expands our understanding of AIV ecology in the wild bird reservoir system.© 2010.},

abstract={Background: Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) causes chronic enteritis in a wide range of animal species. In cattle, MAP causes a chronic disease called Johne's disease, or paratuberculosis, that is not treatable and the efficacy of vaccine control is controversial. The clinical phase of the disease is characterised by diarrhoea, weight loss, drop in milk production and eventually death. Susceptibility to MAP infection is heritable with heritability estimates ranging from 0.06 to 0.10. There have been several studies over the last few years that have identified genetic loci putatively associated with MAP susceptibility, however, with the availability of genome-wide high density SNP maker panels it is now possible to carry out association studies that have higher precision. Methodology/Principal Findings: The objective of the current study was to localize genes having an impact on Johne's disease susceptibility using the latest bovine genome information and a high density SNP panel (Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip) to perform a case/control, genome-wide association analysis. Samples from MAP case and negative controls were selected from field samples collected in 2007 and 2008 in the province of Lombardy, Italy. Cases were defined as animals serologically positive for MAP by ELISA. In total 966 samples were genotyped: 483 MAP ELISA positive and 483 ELISA negative. Samples were selected randomly among those collected from 119 farms which had at least one positive animal. Conclusion/Significance: The analysis of the genotype data identified several chromosomal regions associated with disease status: a region on chromosome 12 with high significance (P&lt;5×10-6), while regions on chromosome 9, 11, and 12 had moderate significance (P&lt;5×10-5). These results provide evidence for genetic loci involved in the humoral response to MAP. Knowledge of genetic variations related to susceptibility will facilitate the incorporation of this information into breeding programmes for the improvement of health status. © 2010 Minozzi et al.},

Chlamydophila abortus and its nitrosoguanidine-induced, temperature-sensitive and virulence-attenuated live vaccine derivative identified point mutations unique to the mutant (Burall et al. . [1]).

Three of eight genomic sites with confirmed point mutations (CAB153, CAB636 and CAB648) were retained for analysis as each resulted in the loss of a restriction site in the genome sequence of the vaccine strain. PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using restriction enzymes chosen to specifically target the three genomic sites was then applied to a large number of . C. abortus field isolates and reference strains. Our results indicate that the three mutations are uniquely present in the vaccine strain, and as such provide easy-to-use markers for the differential identification of the vaccine strain and wild-type isolates. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Context. European rabbits are serious environmental and agricultural pests throughout their range in Australia. Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) greatly reduced rabbit numbers in arid central Australia but had less impact in cooler, higher-rainfall areas. RHDV-like benign caliciviruses (bCVs) have been implicated in limiting the impact of RHDV in the higher-rainfall regions of Australia and also in Europe. Aims. Experimental releases of RHDV on bait were tested as a means of initiating disease outbreaks. Serological evidence of antibodies to bCVs was examined to determine whether they reduce mortality rates and/or spread of the released RHDV, and how that might influence the effectiveness of future RHDV releases for rabbit management. Methods. Four experimental releases were conducted in high-rainfall and coastal regions of southern Australia. Virus activity was implied from recapture rates and serological changes in marked rabbits, and genetic sequencing of virus recovered from dead rabbits. Changes in rabbit abundance were estimated from spotlight transect counts. Key results. Release of RHDV on bait produced disease outbreaks that challenged almost all animals within the general release area and spread up to 4km beyond the release sites. Recapture rates were high in marked rabbits that possessed antibodies from previous exposure to RHDV and extremely low amongst rabbits that lacked any detectable antibodies. Rabbits carrying antibodies classified as being due to previous infection with bCVs had recapture rates that were dependent on circulating antibody titre and were ∼55% of recapture rates in rabbits with clear antibodies to RHDV. Conclusions. This is the first quantified evidence that antibodies produced against bCVs provide significant protection against RHD outbreaks in field populations of rabbits. Implications. bCVs can greatly reduce the impact of RHDV on wild-rabbit populations in Australia and presumably elsewhere. RHDV can be effectively released on bait although further releases are likely to be of minor or inconsistent benefit for controlling rabbit numbers where bCVs are common. © 2010 CSIRO.},

abstract={Clinical chemistry parameters were investigated in piglets weaned at 22 and 28 days. The effects of an oral, low-dose interferon (IFN)-α treatment at weaning were evaluated as well. The trial was carried out on 59 piglets from the same farm, allocated to three groups: the first and the second groups were weaned at 28 and 22 days of age, respectively; the third group was weaned at 22 days and orally treated at weaning with IFN-α at a low dose (1 IU human lymphoblastoid IFN-α/kg body weight in drinking water) for 10 consecutive days. The results of the field trial confirmed that weaning is one of the main stressing events for pigs at intensive farms. In particular, these findings are based on a dramatic increase in serum haptoglobin levels after weaning in the three groups under study. Results also indicated that early weaning at 22 days implies higher environmental adaptation. In such animals, an oral, low-dose IFN-α treatment gave rise to a peculiar, negative, acute-phase response (reduced levels of serum albumin) and to significantly lower α-globulin concentrations in sera. Taken together, IFN-α was shown to modulate inflammatory responses to early weaning stress. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.},

abstract={The H1N1, H3N2 and, more recently, H1N2 subtypes of influenza A virus are presently co-circulating in swine herds in several countries. The objectives of this study were to investigate the pathogenesis of Sw/Italy/1521/98 (H1N2) influenza virus, isolated from respiratory tissues of pigs from herds in Northern Italy, and to evaluate its potential cross-protection against the Sw/Fin/2899/82 (H1N1) strain. In the pathogenesis test, eight pigs were intranasally infected with H1N2 virus; at pre-determined intervals, these animals were killed and necropsied, along with eight uninfected animals. In the cross-protection test, sixteen pigs were infected by intranasal (i.n.) and intratracheal (i.t.) routes with either H1N2 or H1N1 virus. Twenty days later, all pigs were challenged (by the same route), with either the homologous H1N2 or heterologous H1N1 virus strains. Control group was inoculated with culture medium alone. On post-challenge days (PCD) 1 and 3, two pigs from each infected group, along with one control pig, were killed. Clinical, virological, serological and histopathological investigations were performed in both the pathogenicity and cross-protection tests. In the pathogenicity test, mild clinical signs were observed in two pigs during 3 and 4 days, respectively. Virus was isolated from two pigs over 6 days and from lung samples of pigs killed on post-infection days 2 and 4. Seroconversion was detected in the two infected animals killed 15 days after infection. In the cross-protection study, mild clinical respiratory signs were detected in all pigs infected with either the H1N2 or H1N1 virus. The virus was isolated from nasal swabs of almost all pigs till 6 days. After the challenge infection, the pigs remained clinically healthy and virus isolation from the nasal secretions or lung samples was sporadic. Antibody titres in H1N1 or H1N2 infected groups were similar, whereas the H1N2 sub-type induced less protection against re-infection by homologous and heterologous virus than H1N1 sub-type. The controls had no signs of the disease. In the H1N2 infected pigs, a reduced number of goblet cells in nasal and tracheal mucosa and small foci of lymphomononuclear cell infiltrates in the submucosa were detected. Furthermore, the goblet cell reduction was related to the time of infection. Diffuse mild interstitial pneumonia was also recorded in pigs infected with the H1N2 virus and challenged with either H1N1or H1N2 pigs. These studies showed the moderate virulence of the H1N2 virus and a partial cross-protection against heterologous infection. © 2009 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={Nor98 is an atypical scrapie strain characterized by a molecular pattern and brain distribution of the pathological prion protein (PrP Sc) different from classical scrapie. In Italy, 69 atypical cases have been identified so far and all were characterized as Nor98 strain. In this paper we report an unusual case in a sheep which showed immunohistochemical and molecular features of PrP Sc different from the other atypical cases. The sheep was from an outbreak where the index and the other four cases were affected by classical scrapie. Histopathological, immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses on the brain of the unusual case revealed the simultaneous presence of pathological features characteristic of Nor98 and classical scrapie. Interestingly, the prevalent disease phenotype in the brainstem was classical scrapie-like, while in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum the Nor98 phenotype was dominant. The sub-mandibular lymph node was positive and showed a PrP Sc molecular pattern referable to classical scrapie. The PrP genotype was AL 141RQ/AF 141RQ. Taken together, the occurrence of classical scrapie in the outbreak, the PrP genotype, the involvement of different cellular targets in the brain and the pathological and molecular PrP Sc features observed suggest that this unusual case may result from the co-existence of Nor98 and classical scrapie. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={In this study we investigated the HEV prevalence in Italian pigs displaying different pathological lesions, possible risk factors related to the infection, and the possible relations occurring between HEV and other concomitant pig pathogens. Genetic characterization of some of the identified strains was also performed. Detection of HEV RNA was accomplished using a nested reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction on bile samples from 137 pigs of 2-4. months of age submitted for diagnostic purposes. Forty-one of the 137 examined pigs (29.9%) tested positive for HEV RNA. Animals of 80-120. days of age showed a higher prevalence of HEV infection (46.9% against 20% of younger animals). No statistically significant correlations between HEV positivity and the presence of other pathological conditions detected at necropsy, or concomitant coinfections with PCV2 and/or PRRSV were detected. All identified strains belonged to genotype 3, and were similar to other HEV subtypes 3e, 3f, 3c circulating in Europe. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Summary Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is one of the most widespread of all medically important arboviruses with ticks of the Hyalomma spp. serving as the main vectors. Infection of livestock by CCHFV serves as a route of exposure to humans, as a reservoir of disease and as a route of importation. This study discusses the pathways and data requirements for a qualitative risk assessment for the emergence of CCHFV in livestock in Europe. A risk map approach is proposed based on layers that include the potential routes of release (e.g. by migrating birds carrying infected ticks) together with the main components for exposure, namely the distributions of the tick vectors, the small vertebrate host reservoirs and the livestock. A layer on landscape fragmentation serves as a surrogate for proximity of livestock to the tick cycle. Although the impact of climate change on the emergence of CCHF is not clear, comparing the distribution of risk factors in each layer currently with those predicted in the 2080s with climate change can be used to speculate how potential high-risk areas may shift. According to the risk pathway, transstadial and/or transovarial transmission in the tick vector are crucial for CCHFV spread. Vector competence and tick vector switching, however, remain critical factors for CCHFV colonization of new regions in Europe. The species of migratory bird is also an important consideration in the release assessment with greater abundance and biodiversity of ground-dwelling birds in southern Europe than in northern Europe. © 2009 The Society for Applied Microbiology.},

abstract={A survey for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in finishing pig holdings was carried out in Italy in 2008. MRSA isolates were characterised by spa-, MLST-, SCCmec- and antimicrobial susceptibility typing. A prevalence of 38% (45/118, 95% CI 29.4-46.9%) positive holdings was observed. Eleven different spa-types were found among 102 MRSA isolates, clustering in lineages associated with farm animals (ST398, ST9, ST(CC)97 in 36 holdings) and humans (ST1, 7 holdings). Nine (7.6%) holdings were positive for two, three or four different and unrelated spa-types in various combinations. ST398 was the most prevalent lineage (33 positive holdings). The most prevalent spa-type was t899 (ST398), detected in 22 positive holdings. Three novel spa-types (t4794 of ST9; t4795 of ST97; t4838 of ST398) were detected. Ten holdings were positive for spa-type t1730, that proved to be a new single-locus variant of ST97, within the CC97 (ST1476). The most prevalent SCC. mec was Type V (79 isolates), while Type IVb was found in 10 isolates. None of the isolates was positive for Panton-Valentine Leukocidin, while most of the t127 and t1730 isolates, one t4794, one t4795, and one t2922 were positive for LukE-LukD genes. All 64 antimicrobial susceptibility tested isolates were resistant to tetracyclines, with high resistance rates to trimethoprim (68.8%), erythromycin (60.9%), and ciprofloxacin (35.4%). All t127, ST1 isolates were resistant to tetracycline-ciprofloxacin-erythromycin. This survey provides the first report of MRSA ST1 and ST(CC)97 among pigs and the first report of MRSA ST9 from pigs in Europe. The presence of human-associated CA-MRSA (t127, ST1, SCC. mec type V) in 6% holdings surveyed can represent an additional MRSA reservoir for infections in humans. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

Human surveillance was performed by serology or genome detection on blood and cerebrospinal fluid for all suspected cases suffering from acute meningoen-cephalitis in the regional territory. Animal surveillance consisted of passive and active surveillance of horses and active surveillance of wild birds and mosquitoes. Between 15 June and 31 October 2009, nine of 78 possible cases of West Nile neuroinvasive disease were confirmed (three fatal). From May to October, 26 cases of neurological West Nile disease were confirmed among 46 horses. The overall incidence of seroconversion among horses in 2009 was 13%. In 2009, 44 of 1,218 wild birds yielded positive PCR results for WNV infection. The planned veterinary and entomological surveillance actions detected WNV activity from the end of July 2009, about 2-3 weeks before the onset of the first human neurological case. Passive surveillance of horses seems to be an early and suitable tool for the detection of WNV activity, but it will be less sensitive in the future, because an intensive programme of horse vaccination started in June 2009.},

This lemur collection is the most relevant and rich in Italy. A second outbreak between September and November 2008 involved three lemurs. In all cases, the clinical signs were sudden deaths generally without any evident symptoms or only with mild unspecific clinical signs. Gross pathologic changes were characterized by myocarditis (diffuse or focal pallor of the myocardium), pulmonary congestion, emphysema, oedema and thoracic fluid. The EMCV was isolated and recognized as the causative agent of both outbreaks. The first outbreak in particular was associated with a rodent plague, confirming that rats are an important risk factor for the occurrence of the EMCV infection. © 2010 Canelli et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Two caliciviruses occur in Australian wild rabbits: rabbit calicivirus Australia 1 (RCV-A1) and rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), which is used in Australia as a biocontrol agent to reduce feral rabbit populations. There is concern that RCV-A1 acts as a natural vaccine and protects from lethal RHDV infection. To investigate this hypothesis, domestic rabbits were perorally infected with RCV-A1, monitored for 28 days and subsequently challenged with RHDV. We show that RCV-A1 causes a non-pathogenic infection and is shed in faeces for up to 7 days post-infection. RCV-A1 was detected in the bile 2 months post-inoculation, indicating a prolonged or possible persistent infection. All animals infected with RCV-A1 developed antibodies cross-reacting to RHDV. When challenged with RDHV, half of the rabbits (n = 4) survived the infection. The results indicate that RCV-A1 is likely to persist in rabbit populations and can elicit partial cross-protection to lethal RHDV infection. © 2009.},

abstract={Since 1999, the Italian poultry production system has experienced several outbreaks of avian influenza (AI), mainly located in northeastern Italy. This paper describes the low pathogenicity (LP) AI outbreaks detected during the surveillance activities implemented in 2007-08. From May to October 2007, ten rural and hobby poultry farms were infected by an LPAI virus of the H7N3 subtype. In August-October 2007, the H7N3 LPAI virus was introduced into the industrial poultry sector with the involvement of six meat turkey farms. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin gene indicated that all but one of the H7N3 virus strains had a high level of homology (98.7%-99.8%). Furthermore, in August 2007, an LPAI H5N2 virus was identified in a freerange geese and duck breeder flock. The hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes showed a high level of homology (99.8% and 99.9%, respectively) with H5N2 LPAI viruses isolated from mallards in July 2007 in the same area, suggesting a possible introduction from the wild reservoir. All the birds (in total 129,386) on the infected poultry farms were culled. The prompt implementation of AI control measures, including the enforcement of a targeted emergency vaccination plan, allowed the rapid eradication of infection. In 2008, three LPAI viruses (two H7N1 and one H5N1) were identified in dealer/rural farms. The surveillance activity implemented in this area allowed the prompt detection of LPAI viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes in the rural sector, which, as observed in the 2007 epidemic, might be the source of infection for industrial poultry. © 2010 American Association of Avian Pathologists.},

abstract={Porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) is a contagious enteric disease of pigs caused by a coronavirus. A double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) based on the use of monoclonal antibodies was developed for the detection of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV). The DAS-ELISA was compared with RT-PCR in the examination of 506 specimens collected during 2006-2007 from pigs originating from different farms located in the Po valley. Both faecal samples obtained directly from the rectum of live animals showing clinical signs and intestinal samples collected from the caecum of deceased pigs were included in the study. The correlation between the two methods was higher when testing faecal samples (K = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.94-1.00) than testing intestinal samples (K = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.35-0.89). The use of ELISA technology provided an efficient and effective mean of evaluating the presence of coronavirus PED antigen in field samples and indicates that this procedure is a very useful tool in epidemiological studies. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A low prevalence of IFN-γ positive cells was also detected in PBMC of some Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus-infected pigs and uninfected, control pigs. IFN-α positive cells showed phenotypes of both monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. The presence of IFN-α in PBMC was also confirmed by Western blotting. By immunoprecipitation, IFN-α was detected as 32 and 55-57 kDa bands in PBMC of healthy SPF piglets. These samples were also IFN-γ positive; the cytokine was revealed as 24, 37 and 54 kDa bands. The unusual molecular mass values of intracellular interferons were probably due to oligomerization, as previously described for human IFN-α. Swine intracellular IFN-α displayed the expected antiviral activity on bovine MDBK cells. The results indicate that interferons are constitutively expressed in swine leukocytes with peculiar molecular features. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Recombinant canine coronaviruses, resembling the transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine (TGEV) in a 5′ fragment of the S glycoprotein, have been detected recently and showed to be present in canine populations. The 5′ fragment of the S protein (S′) of a TGEV-like canine coronavirus (CCoV), strain 174/06, was expressed in an Escherichia coli cell-free system. The purified recombinant polypeptide was employed to develop an ELISA test for the detection of TGEV-like CCoV-specific antibodies in dog sera. Four canine sera positive for TGEV-like CCoV, six sera positive to classical CCoV-II strains and 10 negative control sera were examined. The recombinant S′ was not recognized by antibodies to classical CCoV-II, as only sera from dogs infected experimentally with TGEV-like CCoV reacted strongly with the recombinant S′ polypeptide whereas dog sera with antibodies to classical CCoV-II did not react. As classical CCoV-II and TEGV-like CCoVs are related antigenically, the recombinant S′ ELISA is a useful method to investigate serologically the prevalence of TGEV-like CCoVs in dogs. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={A lateral flow device (LFD) for the detection of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) of the SAT 2 serotype was developed using a monoclonal antibody (Mab 2H6). The performance of the LFD was evaluated in the laboratory on suspensions of vesicular epithelia: 305 positive for FMDV type SAT 2 from suspected cases of vesicular disease collected from 30 countries and 1002 samples shown to be negative for FMDV type SAT 2 collected from 67 countries between 1968 and 2008. The diagnostic sensitivity of the LFD for FMDV type SAT 2 was higher at 88% compared to 79% obtained by the reference method of antigen ELISA, and the diagnostic specificity of the LFD was approximately 99% compared to 100% for the ELISA. The device recognized FMDV strains of wide diversity within the FMDV SAT 2 serotype and gave a superior performance for their detection compared to the 1F10 LFD which had been developed previously and shown to perform less well for the detection of FMDVs of this particular serotype. Reactions in the SAT 2 2H6 LFD with the viruses of other FMDV serotypes and swine vesicular disease (which produces a clinically indistinguishable syndrome in pigs), did not occur. These data illustrate the potential for the LFD to be employed to complement the 1F10 device next to the animal in the pen-side diagnosis of FMD, for providing rapid and objective support to veterinarians in their clinical judgment of the disease and for specific confirmation of a FMDV type SAT 2 infection. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper reports on the determination of toxin profile of mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) collected in November-December 2003 along the Emilia Romagna coasts (Italy) when a high concentration of Alexandrium ostenfeldii cells was detected in seawater. Detailed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analyses were performed on the crude extracts in both selected ion monitoring (SIM) and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) modes. They revealed that M. galloprovincialis had accumulated the three major spirolides produced by the alga, namely 13-desMethyl spirolide C, 13,19-didesMethyl spirolide C and 27-hydroxy-13,19-didesMethyl spirolide C, which fully accounted for toxicity of lipophilic extracts shown in mouse bioassay. Interestingly, yessotoxin (YTX) and its analogues were still present in mussel polar extracts but YTX itself was not the major toxin contained in mussels. The presence of pectenotoxin-2 seco acid (PTX-2sa) and its putative epimer was also assessed. The presence of azaspiracids, never reported from the Adriatic sea, as well as of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning toxins (okadaic acid, dinophysistoxins and OA esters) and domoic acid, long known as contaminants of Adriatic mussels, was also investigated. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Influenza A virus isolation is undertaken routinely in embryonated chicken eggs, but to improve virus detection various cell lines can be used. The CACO-2 cell line was compared to the MDCK cell line and embryonated chicken eggs for the isolation of H1N1, H1N2, H3N2 swine influenza A virus subtypes from clinical specimens. From 2006 to 2008, 104 influenza A samples found positive by PCR from 42 respiratory outbreaks in Italian swine farms were examined by virus isolation. Sixty swine influenza A viruses were isolated (16 H1N1, 28 H1N2 and 16 H3N2) and their growth behaviour on the different substrates was examined. 16/16 H1N1, 28/28 H1N2 and 8/16 of H3N2 viruses were isolated from the CACO-2 cell line, while 7/16 H1N1, 3/28 H1N2 and 16/16 H3N2 viruses were isolated using embryonated chicken eggs. Only 9/16 H1N1, 1/28 H1N2 and 6/16 H3N2 viruses replicated in MDCK cells. A link was found between viral hemagglutinin and the isolation rate on the various substrates. The CACO-2 line was statistically more sensitive (Fisher's exact test, p < 0.01) compared to the MDCK cells and embryonated chicken eggs for the isolation of H1N1 and H1N2 subtypes.

abstract={At the end of 2006, a recrudescence of swine vesicular disease (SVD) was recorded in Italy and the disease spread widely throughout the northern regions. Lombardy, a densely populated pig area, was most affected and the presence of the disease caused heavy economic losses to the entire pig industry. Although SVD is considered only moderately contagious, the epidemic in the north was characterised by a rapid spread of the condition. Numerous difficulties were encountered in eradicating it. Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the population of pigs in Lombardy, concentrated mainly in a few areas which were the most severely affected during the 2006 to 2007 SVD epidemic. Increases in both the pig population and animal movements, combined with weak biosecurity measures, increased the spread rate of the disease and hampered eradication activities.},

abstract={Yersinia enterocolitica is recognized as an etiological agent of gastroenteritis, lymphadenitis, and chronic sequelae. During 2006 and 2007, 205 samples (125 pork and 80 chicken meats) were collected in Italy and tested for detection and most-probablenumber (MPN) enumeration of Y. enterocolitica organisms. The microorganism was isolated from 45 samples (21.9%): 19 (15.2%) pork samples and 26 (32.5%) chicken samples. Y. enterocolitica MPN contamination levels were low, ranging from 0.30 to 1.50/g. Most (94.4%) Y. enterocolitica strains were biotype 1A (serotypes O:3; O:5; O:6,30; O:6,30-6,31; O:7,8-8-8,19; O:8; O:9; O:25,35; O:36; and O nontypeable), and 5.6% of the isolates were bioserotype 2/O:9. All isolates were tested for yadA, ail, inv, ystA, and ystB virulence sequences. The yadA gene was detected in two strains (3.7%) isolated from chicken samples: one Y. enterocolitica 2/O:9 yadA+ ail + ystA+, and one Y. enterocolitica 1A/O:7,8-8-8,19 yadA+ inv+ ystB+. Two (3.7%) 2/O:9 strains, isolated from pork products, were ail+ ystA+. Most biotype 1A strains were ystB+ (84.3%) and invz (39.2%). All strains were sensitive to cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, sulfonamide, tetracycline, trimethoprim, and trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole. Resistance to gentamicin and aztreonam was observed in 1.9% of the isolates. High levels of resistance were detected toward amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (27.8%), ampicillin (75.9%), and erythromycin (100%). The authors hypothesize that Y. enterocolitica pathogenic biotypes are rather uncommon in foods when compared with their isolation rates from animal sources and that chicken meat could be contaminated as well as pig meat and its derived products.

abstract={Proliferative and necrotizing pneumonia (PNP) is a form of interstitial pneumonia that occurs in weaning and post-weaning pigs. PNP is characterized by hypertrophy and hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes and coagulative necrosis and granular debris within alveolar spaces. Canadian and European studies suggest that the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) are the main causes of the disease, but Aujezsky's disease virus (ADV) and swine influenza virus (SIV) have also been considered as potential aetiological agents. An immunohistochemical study was carried out on the lungs of 28 Italian pigs with PNP in order to evaluate the role of PRRSV, PCV2 and ADV in PNP lesions. PRRSV infection was identified in the lungs of 11 pigs, PCV2 in the lungs of four pigs and coinfection with both viruses in the lungs of eight pigs. Neither virus was detected in the lungs of the remaining five pigs. ADV antigen was not detected in any sample. The principle aetiological agent of PNP in Italy therefore appears to be PRRSV. Coinfection with PRRSV and PCV2 is characterized by more severe microscopical changes in affected lungs. © 2009.},

abstract={Four trials were carried out to investigate the efficiency of gamithromycin in beef cattle's bovine respiratory disease (BRD) prevention and therapy. The gamithromycin is characterized by fast absorption and distribution to target tissue, notably the lung. Three studies were conducted on the preventive efficacy using an untreated control (trial 1), a long-acting oxytetracycline formulation (trial 2) and tulathromycin (trial 3). The responses of tulathromycin and Gamithromycin were compared in the therapeutic study (trial 4). Evaluations included incidence of morbidity, mortality, re-treatments and problem animals (removed to hospitalpen) over the 14 days subsequent to treatment and shortterm growth rates over the first 30 days. Preventive treatment with Gamithromycin significantly reduced the morbidity due to BRD by 86%, 86% and 35% compared to the control groups in trials 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The proportion of problem animals was significantly less in the Gamithromycin group compared to the controls in trial 2. In the therapeutic trial, the incidence of animal that required re-treatment during the 14 days following treatment was 30,8% in the Gamithromycin group, in which there were no problem animals, compared to 81,8% in the positive control group, in which problem animals incidence was 27,7% (significative differences). Growth rates were significantly less in the control animals in trial 1. Overall, these results confirm the usefulness of Gamithromycin in BRD treatment and prevention and provide valuable information about BRD economic balance.},

abstract={Infection or reactivation of human herpesvirus (HHV)-6 represents a potentially serious complication (often involving the central nervous system) in patients receiving either solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The objective of this study was to assess the risk of HHV-6 infectionreactivation in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). MSCs are multipotent cells displaying immunomodulatory properties that have been already successfully used in the clinical setting to enhance hematopoietic stem cell engraftment and to treat steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease. We analyzed 20 samples of ex vivo expanded MSCs, at different passages of culture, isolated both from bone marrow and from umbilical cord blood. Through Western blotting and immunocytochemistry techniques, we investigated the presence of the HHV-6 receptor (CD46) on cell surface, whereas the presence of HHV-6 DNA was evaluated by nested polymerase chain reaction assay. All of the MSC samples tested were positive for the virus receptor (CD46), suggesting their potential susceptibility to HHV-6. However, none of the MSC samples derived from cultures, performed in the perspective of clinical use, was found to harbor HHV-6. This preliminary observation on a consistent number of MSC samples, some of them tested at late in vitro passages, indicates a good safety profile of the product in terms of HHV-6 contamination. Nevertheless, it remains important to set up in vitro experimental models to study MSCs' susceptibility to HHV-6 (and HHV-7) infection, to verify their capacity to integrate the virus into cellular DNA, and to investigate which experimental conditions are able to induce virus reactivation. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons AS.},

Neuropathological observations were made in 230 animals and the whole Central Nervous System (CNS) of each animals was examined by histology. Moreover, immunohistochemistry for PrPSc at the level of frontal cortex was carried out in 100 animals in order to exclude the occurrence of atypical BSE. Neuropathological findings were detected in 36.9% cases and the differential diagnoses were classified as: non-suppurative meningo/encephalitis, listeriosis, degenerative diseases, suppurative meningo/encephalitis, neoplasia, malfomations. No histological lesions were found in 55.2% of the samples tested and the unsuitable ones were 7.9%. One case of BSE was detected but no case of atypical BSE was observed. This study has identified diseases and lesions that are encountered in the differential diagnosis of BSE and it has demonstrated that the surveillance system is a necessary tool in order to monitor neuropathological diseases and to discover of BSE cases.},

abstract={Background: Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) allows cell recovery from the lower respiratory tract; differential cell counts of BAL fluid gives important information in the assessment of various bronchial and pulmonary diseases. To the best of our knowledge no study has investigated the relation between the number of cells counted and the reproducibility of BAL fluid differential cell counts. Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate using statistical methods how many cells should be counted in cytocentrifuged BAL fluid preparations in order to obtain a reliable enumeration of each cell type. Methods: BAL fluid samples from dogs with suspected bronchopulmonary disease were obtained during fiberoptic bronchoscopy with a standardized protocol. Differential cell counts were performed on May-Grünwald- Giemsa-stained cytocentrifuged preparations by 2 independent observers. Reproducibility for the enumeration of each cell type was expressed as the intraclass correlation coefficient. We considered a threshold level of ≥0.90 to be high and a threshold level of ≥0.85 to be adequate. Results: Forty BAL fluid samples were included in the study. For neutrophils, alveolar macrophages, and eosinophils high reproducibility was reached by counting 200 cells; adequate reproducibility was reached for lymphocytes and bronchial epithelial cells by counting 500 cells. Conclusions: A 500-cell differential count is required for all types of cells to be quantified with adequate reproducibility in canine cytocentrifuged BAL fluid samples. © 2009 American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology.},

abstract={A confirmatory method for the simultaneous determination of nandrolone (α and β) and trenbolone (α and β) in urine samples by liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) was developed. After an enzymatic deconjugation, the urine was subjected to a one-step cleanup on a commercially available immunoaffinity chromatography cartridge. The analytes were detected by liquid chromatography-positive ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry using deuterium labelled internal standards. The analytical procedure was applicable to bovine and swine urine samples. The procedure was validated as a quantitative confirmatory method according to the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC criteria. The results obtained showed that the method was suitable for statutory residues testing regarding the following performance characteristics: instrumental linearity, specificity, precision (repeatability and intra-laboratory reproducibility), recovery, decision limit (CCα), detection capability (CCβ) and ruggedness. The decision limits (CCα) obtained, were between 0.54 and 0.60 μg L-1; the recovery was above 64% for all the analytes. Repeatability was between 1.6% and 5.7% and within-laboratory reproducibility between 1.6% and 6.0% for all the steroids. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Mercury represents an ubiquitous environmental toxic metal. Heat shock proteins (HSP) and metallothioneins (MTs) help to protect cells against metal toxicity. Schisandrin B (Sch B), a lignoid from Schisandra chinensis, has been successfully used to treat hepatitis, but its effect against mercury hepatotoxicity remains unknown. We analyzed whether Sch B could protect rat liver against mercuric chloride (HgCl2) intake by analyzing stress proteins and histopathological changes. Wistar rats were administered Sch B (10 mg/kg/day by gavage) or vehicle (olive oil) for 10 days. A subset of each group also received low-dose HgCl2 (0.1 mg/kg/day) for 3 days on days 8-10. Another group received Sch B for 10 days with a single high dose of HgCl2 (1 mg/kg intraperitoneally) on day 10. In rats treated with Sch B and HgCl2, HSP72, HSP25 and MTs were overexpressed in liver zones 1 and 3 irrespective of HgCl2 dosing schedules. Furthermore Sch B alone induced perinuclear rough endoplasmic reticulum alignment and if associated to HgCl2, increased mitochondrial density and dense bodies, all signs of intense detoxification machinery. Taking together these data suggest that dietary Sch B counteracts HgCl2 hepatotoxicity in the rat by stimulating chaperones responsible for anabolic activity. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={A close link between stress protein up-regulation and oxidative damage may provide a novel therapeutic tool to counteract nephrotoxicity induced by toxic metals in the human population, mainly in children, of industrialized countries. Here we analysed the time course of the expression of several heat shock proteins, glucose-regulated proteins and metallothioneins in a rat proximal tubular cell line (NRK-52E) exposed to subcytotoxic doses of inorganic mercury and lead. Concomitantly, we used morphological and biochemical methods to evaluate metal-induced cytotoxicity and oxidative damage. In particular, as biochemical indicators of oxidative stress we detected reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS), total glutathione (GSH) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity. Our results clearly demonstrated that mercury increases ROS and RNS levels and the expressions of Hsp25 and inducible Hsp72. These findings are corroborated by evident mitochondrial damage, apoptosis or necrosis. By contrast, lead is unable to up-regulate Hsp72 but enhances Grp78 and activates nuclear Hsp25 translocation. Furthermore, lead causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, vacuolation and nucleolar segregation. Lastly, both metals stimulate the over-expression of MTs, but with a different time course. In conclusion, in NRK-52E cell line the stress response is an early and metal-induced event that correlates well with the direct oxidative damage induced by mercury. Indeed, different chaperones are involved in the specific nephrotoxic mechanism of these environmental pollutants and work together for cell survival. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract={RNA helicase-like receptors MDA-5 but not RIG-I has been shown to be essential for triggering innate immune responses against picornaviruses. However, virus-host co-evolution has selected for viruses capable of replicating despite host cells antiviral defences. In this report, we demonstrate that RIG-I is degraded during encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection. This effect is mediated by both the viral-encoded 3C protease and caspase proteinase. In addition, we show that RIG-I overexpression confers IFN-β promoter activation during EMCV infection, in MDA-5 knockout (MDA-5-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts. This induction is followed by a strong inhibition reflecting the ability of EMCV to disrupt RIG-I signalling. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that during evolution RIG-I has been involved for triggering innate immune response to picornavirus infections. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular bacteria that grow in eukaryotic cells and cause a wide spectrum of diseases. They can establish persistent infections, are mitogenic in vitro, promote polyclonal cell proliferation in vivo and induce resistance to apoptosis in infected cells-properties that might contribute to tumorigenesis. In fact, Chlamydophila psittaci (Cp) has been linked to the development and maintenance of ocular adnexal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (OAMZL). In this indolent malignancy, Cp is transported by monocytes and macrophages and causes both local and systemic infection. Cp elementary bodies are viable and infectious in the conjunctiva and peripheral blood of patients with OAMZL. Bacterial eradication with antibiotic therapy is often followed by lymphoma regression. Despite recent advances in the understanding of this bacterium-lymphoma association, several questions remain unanswered. For instance, prevalence variations among different geographical areas and related diagnostic and therapeutic implications remain a major investigational issue. We will focus on clinical and therapeutic implications of chlamydial infections in patients with lymphomas and summarize the current knowledge on the association between Cp infection and OAMZL. Available data on the epidemiology, biology and pathogenesis of this association are analyzed and new investigative and clinical approaches are discussed.},

During 2008 summer months we collected and examined pooled recto-anal swabs, bulk milk samples and milking machine filters using immuno-magnetic separation for E. coli O157 detection and microbiological standard methods for thermotolerant Campylobacter spp. detection. A genetic characterization of all the E. coli O157 strains we isolated was made. E. coli O157 prevalence was 33% in farms and 4.9% in pooled swabs. Thermotolerant Campylobacter spp. prevalence was 83% in farms and 42% in pooled swabs. All E. coli O157 strains we isolated were positive for eae gene and for verocytotoxins-coding genes. All bulk milk and milking machine filters samples were negative for both pathogens.We think that the lack of E. coli O157 and thermotolerant Campylobacter spp. detection in bulk milk may be an index of good hygiene practice during milking procedures, milk collection and storage. We observe that the farms found positive for E. coli O157 in our study were those located on the hills and where heifers used to graze during spring and summer months. We confirm rectoanal swabbing as a valid sampling method for E. coli O157 detection.},

abstract={The authors have verified the seroprevalence of BVDV in a stratified random sample of 240 cattle farms in some provinces of Lombardy. In each herd, young (heifers) and adult (cows) animals were sampled and tested for antibodies to BVDV NS 2-3 by ELISA. The prevalence of positivity in groups and the observed ODs allowed to assess: (i) the presence of active circulation of BVDV in 89 herds (37.1%), (ii) responses related to prior infection in 108 herds (45.0%) and (iii) responses probably related to the use of vaccine in 7 herds (2.9%). Another sampling involved 194 farms located in two provinces of Lombardy in the course of 24 months, with quarterly examinations of the tank bulk milk antibodies by ELISA. The high percentage of "seroconversion" (63 of 194 corresponding to 32.5%) strongly suggests the evidence for an high circulation of BVDV among herds in Lombardy. The eradication protocol applied in 14 farms was based on the research of BVDV by PCR of pools of 20 sera to cover the whole herd from one day old calves. Moreover all new-born calves were tested by PCR during the 9 following months. A minimum of 1 to a maximum of 14 (0.1% to 5.8%) persistently infected (PI) animals were identified in the controlled farms. The elimination of PI subjects identified in all herds led to eradication of infection. This was documented by repeated negative antibody response in 6/8 months old subjects and by PCR on the bulk milk samples.},

abstract={In Italy pig industry is one of the most important sector in livestock husbandry, also as a consequence of the economic value of by-product production. Pig farming is mainly concentrated in Northern Regions where, over the past decade a significant increase in pig population has occurred. In the remaining Regions pig farming is less specialized and it is characterized by small-scale holdings mainly for self-consumption or for small-scale trade. The presence of different pig farming systems determine the coexistence of different: management systems, production scales, health and bio-security standards, market requirements and production costs; all these factors are considered relevant for diseases spreading. Theoretically the application of rigorous prevention measures (bio-security) may modulate the risk of disease diffusion but, data emerged during the surveillance and eradication campaigns, indicate that the bio-security measures applied are too weak to guarantee the status of the entire system. This inconvenience could be overcome throughout the assignment of different levels of risk, to be established throughout the collection of objective parameters on the holding. Trade between farms of the same level of risk and same health standard could guarantee the status of the entire sector and safeguard the economic and market requirements of the different production systems.},

abstract={To date, three subtypes of swine influenza viruses, H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 have been isolated in Italy. In 2006, a novel swine influenza virus subtype (H3N1) was isolated from coughing pigs. RT-PCR performed on lung tissues, experimental infection in pigs with the novel isolate, and cloning the virus by plaque assay confirmed this unique H and N combination. The novel isolate was also antigenically and genetically characterized. Genetic and phylogenetic analysis showed that the complete HA gene of the H3N1 strain has the highest nucleotide identity to three Italian H3N2 strains, one isolated in 2001 and two in 2004, whereas the full length NA sequence is closely related to three H1N1 subtype viruses isolated in Italy in 2004. The remaining genes are also closely related to respective genes found in H1N1 and H3N2 SIVs currently circulating in Italy. This suggests that the novel SIV could be a reassortant between the H3N2 and H1N1 SIVs circulating in Italy. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The consumption of a wide variety of species of reptiles caught from the wild has been an important source of protein for humans world-wide for millennia. Terrapins, snakes, lizards, crocodiles and iguanas are now farmed and the consumption and trade of their meat and other edible products have recently increased in some areas of the world. Biological risks associated with the consumption of products from both farmed and wild reptile meat and eggs include infections caused by bacteria (Salmonella spp., Vibrio spp.), parasites (Spirometra, Trichinella, Gnathostoma, pentastomids), as well as intoxications by biotoxins. For crocodiles, Salmonella spp. constitute a significant public health risk due to the high intestinal carrier rate which is reflected in an equally high contamination rate in their fresh and frozen meat. There is a lack of information about the presence of Salmonella spp. in meat from other edible reptilians, though captive reptiles used as pets (lizards or turtles) are frequently carriers of these bacteria in Europe. Parasitic protozoa in reptiles represent a negligible risk for public health compared to parasitic metazoans, of which trichinellosis, pentastomiasis, gnathostomiasis and sparganosis can be acquired through consumption of contaminated crocodile, monitor lizard, turtle and snake meat, respectively. Other reptiles, although found to harbour the above parasites, have not been implicated with their transmission to humans. Freezing treatment inactivates Spirometra and Trichinella in crocodile meat, while the effectiveness of freezing of other reptilian meat is unknown. Biotoxins that accumulate in the flesh of sea turtles may cause chelonitoxism, a type of food poisoning with a high mortality rate in humans. Infections by fungi, including yeasts, and viruses widely occur in reptiles but have not been linked to a human health risk through the contamination of their meat. Currently there are no indications that natural transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) occur in reptilians. The feeding of farmed reptiles with non-processed and recycled animal products is likely to increase the occurrence of biological hazards in reptile meat. Application of GHP, GMP and HACCP procedures, respectively at farm and slaughterhouse level, is crucial for controlling the hazards. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Many apparently healthy cows show marked inflammatory conditions around calving, associated with endocrine and metabolic changes. To prevent the above conditions, a low-dose, oral interferon-α (IFN-α) treatment was carried out on periparturient, multiparous dairy cows. In the first trial, 10 cows received 10 IU of IFN-α/kg of BW daily during the last 2 wk of pregnancy. In a second trial, 4 cows received 0.5 IU of IFN-α/kg of BW daily until d 5 of lactation. In both trials, a homogenous group of untreated dairy cows was used as control. All cows were monitored, during the month before and after calving, for health status, BCS, milk yield, and inflammatory, metabolic, immune, and hematological variables. Compared with control cows, IFN-α-treated animals showed in both trials a larger decrease of BCS along with decreased milk yield (P < 0.05), increased haptoglobin (P < 0.05) and ceruloplasmin, and a slower increase of negative acute phase proteins (albumin, cholesterol, paraoxonase, vitamin A) after calving. Interferon-α-treated animals also showed a larger decrease of plasma glucose and greater values of NEFA, β-hydroxybutyrate, and reactive oxygen metabolites. There also was evidence of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α responses in both groups before calving with a quick decrease thereafter. The IL-6 response appeared in some animals regardless of the IFN-α treatment. Results indicate that low-dose IFN-α can sustain an inflammatory response in dairy cows and cause notable metabolic changes. This out-come might be explained by the repeated and extended interaction of IFN-α at low doses with the oral lymphoid tissues during rumination, as suggested by the observed stability of the cytokine in the rumen milieu; the final inflammatory effect could thus be as large as that of high doses. In addition, the antiflogistic signal of IFN-α might be counteracted and inverted by lymphocytes detected in the rumen liquor. © 2009 American Society of Animal Science.},

abstract={A low-dose treatment based on interleukin-2 (IL-2) was investigated for preventing mastitis in dairy cows. The treatment consisted of a single dose of IL-2 injected into the skin region drained by the supramammary lymph node 3-5 days after calving. The study included 45 cows (23 treated and 22 controls) from three commercial dairy herds. The results showed that the treatment had no side effects. The treatment with IL-2 induced the significant increase of several milk markers related to leukocyte and epithelial cell functions, i.e. SCC (somatic cell counts), serum amyloid A (SAA), lactoferrin and NAGase. The increased concentration of milk markers suggested also an activity of IL-2 on epithelial cells, resulting in a higher resistance to invading pathogens. Indeed, the increased efficiency of cells in the udder is supported by the higher frequency of healthy quarters observed in the treated group until day 17-19 after calving, in comparison with the control one. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Cyclosporine (CsA) is a universally used immunosuppressive drug which induces adverse side effects in several organs, but its impact on the heart is still controversial. Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs), such as HSP25 and alpha B-crystallin, are cytoprotective stress proteins exceptionally represented in the heart. They act as myofibrillar chaperones that help actin and desmin to maintain their optimum configuration and stability, thereby antagonizing oxidative damage. The present study examined: (1) the cardiac distribution and abundance of HSP25 and alpha B-crystallin in rats receiving CsA at a therapeutic dosage (15 mg/kg/day) for 42 days and 63 days; (2) the presence of myofibrillar proteins, such as actin, alpha-actinin and desmin following the CsA treatments; (3) the subcellular effects of prolonged CsA exposure on the cardiomyocytes by histopathology and transmission electron microscopy. After 63 days CsA intake, sHSPs translocated from a regular sarcomeric pattern to peripheral sarcolemma and intercalated discs, together with actin and desmin. In contrast, the sarcomeric alpha-actinin pattern did not change in all experimental groups. The abundance of actin and HSP25 was unchanged in every time point of treatment while after 63 days CsA, alpha B-crystallin and desmin levels significantly decreased. Furthermore CsA induced fibrosis, irregular sarcomeric alignment and damaged desmosomes. These findings indicate that following prolonged CsA exposure, the cardiac muscle network was affected. In particular, the translocation of sHSPs to intercalated discs merits special consideration as a direct compensatory mechanism to limit CsA cardiotoxicity. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract={In Australia, the epidemiology of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is complicated by non-pathogenic forms of calicivirus (bCV) co-circulating with RHDV and providing variable protection from RHDV. Currently no bCV virus-specific antibody tests exist; however, a series of four ELISAs used to detect antibodies to RHDV provided an indirect means to detect antibodies to bCV, enabling antibody categories of seronegative, maternal RHDV, RHDV or bCV to be determined. Rabbits (188) from four locations were challenged with RHDV and logistic regression models determined that, for rabbits 15 months old, survival was dependent on antibody titres alone and the relationship did not vary with age, capture site, gender, liveweight or reproductive status. All rabbits survived challenge after reaching 15 months of age, irrespective of their antibody titres. Where bCV antibodies were prevalent in young rabbits, the bCV category did not adequately summarise all information about rabbit survival that can be obtained from antibody titres. Within antibody categories, 95% of rabbits with RHDV, 33% with bCV, 40% with maternal RHDV and 22% with seronegative antibodies survived. The high survival rate of adults implies that natural outbreaks or controlled releases of RHDV will have little impact on adult breeding rabbits. Therefore, where RHDV and bCV are endemic, conventional rabbit-control programs targeting the immune breeding populations should provide the most predictable outcome for long-term maintenance of low rabbit populations. © CSIRO 2009.},

A total of 1450 sera from different avian species (854 negative, 185 positive to N1, 136 positive to N2, 219 positive to N3 and 56 positive to other N subtypes sera) were analysed in parallel by the three ELISAs. ROC analyses were performed to enable the selection of best cut-off values and estimation of diagnostic specificity and sensitivity. In addition, the correlation between the new developed ELISAs and the neuraminidase inhibition test was evaluated on a limited number of sera. The validation process of the three ELISAs proved excellent diagnostic performances, with very high specificity and sensitivity, ranging from 99.4 to 99.8% and from 97.6 to 100%, respectively in the three assays. The discriminating potential between antibodies elicited against homologous and heterologous N validates the test for use in "DIVA" assays, to distinguish between vaccinated and infected birds. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Within the European Union (EU), detailed legislation has been developed for cattle, but not deer, to minimise disease risks associated with trade in animals and animal products. This legislation is expressed as input-based standards, providing a detailed outline of the activity required (for example, testing of animals and application of defined control measures), on the expectation that an adequate output (for example, confidence in freedom) will be achieved. Input-based standards are at odds with the increasing shift towards output-based standards, particularly in OIE rules governing international trade. In this paper, we define output-based standards to achieve and maintain freedom from tuberculosis (TB) in farmed deer, with reference to EU member states. After considering the probability of freedom achieved for cattle under existing EU legislation, we defined a 'free farmed deer holding' as one with a probability of freedom from infection of at least 99%. We then developed an epidemiological model of TB surveillance systems for deer holdings, incorporating different surveillance strategies, including combinations of diagnostic tests, and a variety of different scenarios relating to the potential for introduction of infection. A range of surveillance strategies were identified to achieve and maintain a free farmed deer holding, and worked examples are presented. The surveillance system sensitivity for varying combinations of screening and confirmatory tests in live animals, animals at slaughter and on-farm deaths is also presented. Using a single test at a single point in time, none of the TB tests routinely used in farmed deer is able to achieve an acceptable probability of TB freedom. If repeat testing were undertaken, an acceptable probability of TB freedom could be achieved, with differing combinations of the surveillance system sensitivity, frequency of testing and risk of introduction. The probability of introduction of infection through the importation of infected deer was influenced by the use of a pre-movement test (assumed 90% test sensitivity and negative test results), the TB prevalence in the source herd and the number of animals imported. A surveillance system sensitivity of at least 81% was achieved with different combinations of annual live animal surveillance and surveillance of animals at slaughter or on-farm deaths. This methodology has broad applicability and could also be extended to other diseases in both deer and other species with relevance to trade in animals and animal products. Crown Copyright © 2009.},

abstract={Fetal membranes (amnion and chorion) have recently raised significant attention as potential sources of stem cells. We have recently demonstrated that cells derived from human term placenta show stem cell phenotype, high plasticity, and display low immunogenicity both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, placenta-derived cells, after xenotransplantation, are able to engraft in solid organs including the lung. On these bases, we studied the effects of fetal membrane-derived cells on a mouse model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Fetal membrane-derived cells were infused 15 min after intratracheal bleomycin instillation. Different delivery routes were used: intraperitoneal or intratracheal for both xenogeneic and allogeneic cells, and intravenous for allogeneic cells. The effects of the transplanted cells on bleomycin-induced inflammatory and fibrotic processes were then scored and compared between transplanted and control animals at different time points. By PCR and immunohistochemistry analyses, we demonstrated the presence of transplanted cells 3, 7, 9, and 14 days after transplantation. Concomitantly, we observed a clear decrease in neutrophil infiltration and a significant reduction in the severity of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice treated with placenta-derived cells, irrespective of the source (allogeneic or xenogeneic) or delivery route. Our findings constitute further evidence in support of the hypothesis that placenta-derived cells could be useful for clinical application, and warrant further studies toward the use of these cells for the repair of tissue damage associated with inflammatory and fibrotic degeneration.

abstract={Chlamydophila (C.) abortus is the causative agent of ovine enzootic abortion with zoonotic potential whose epidemiology has been held back because of the obligate intracellular habitat of the bacterium. In the present study, we report on a molecular typing method termed multiple loci variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) Analysis (MLVA) for exploring the diversity of C. abortus. An initial analysis performed with 34 selected genetic loci on 34 ruminant strains including the variant Greek strains LLG and POS resulted in the identification of five polymorphic loci, confirming the widely held notion that C. abortus is a very homogeneous species. Analysis of additional 111 samples with the selected five loci resulted in the classification of all strains into six genotypes with distinct molecular patterns termed genotypes [1] through [6]. Interestingly, the classification of the isolates in the six genotypes was partly related to their geographical origin. Direct examination of clinical samples proved the MLVA to be suitable for direct typing. Analysis of the genomic sequences in six C. abortus prototypes of amplicons generated with each of the five selected VNTR primers revealed that variation between genotypes was caused by the presence or absence of coding tandem repeats in three loci. Amplification of Chlamydophila psittaci reference strains with the five selected VNTR primers and of the six C. abortus prototype strains with the eight VNTR primers established for the typing of C. psittaci [Laroucau, K., Thierry, S., Vorimore, F., Blanco, K., Kaleta, E., Hoop, R., Magnino, S., Vanrompay, D., Sachse, K., Myers, G.S., Bavoil, P.M., Vergnaud, G., Pourcel, C., 2008. High resolution typing of Chlamydophila psittaci by multilocus VNTR analysis (MLVA). Infect. Genet. Evol. 8(2), 171-181] showed that both MLVA typing systems were species-specific when all respective VNTR primer sets were used. In conclusion, the newly developed MLVA system provides a highly sensitive, high-resolution and easy-to-perform tool for the differentiation of C. abortus isolates of different origin, which is suitable for molecular epidemiological studies. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Amino acid polymorphisms of the prion protein gene influence sheep susceptibility to classical and atypical scrapie. Substitutions at codons 136, 154 and 171 play an important role in classical scrapie. Codon 141 leucine to phenylalanine mutation (AFRQ) has been recognized as an increased risk factor for atypical scrapie. In addition a rare allele with lysine at codon 171 (ARK) has been detected in Mediterranean sheep breeds. The presence of ARK poses two problems: the determination of its frequency and its possible interference with genotyping output of routine methods lacking specific detection capacity for ARK. The aim of our work was the development of a routine genotyping method with the capacity to identify ARK and AFRQ in addition to the normally detected alleles and to determine the frequencies of all these alleles in 5 main Italian breeds: Sarda (n = 2494), Bergamasca (n = 2686), Appenninica (n = 297), Comisana (n = 361) and Massese (n = 402). A multiplex primer extension assay targeting the six single nucleotide polymorphisms of interest was developed. Allele frequencies revealed a very low level of ARR in Bergamasca (6.91%) as opposed to the other breeds, very diverse levels of AFRQ ranging from absence in Comisana to 10.70% in Massese and a restricted presence of ARK. This allele has only been detected in Bargamasca with a significant 3.67% and marginally in Appenninica (0.34%). These results underline the need for adequate routine methods for genotyping of breeds with alleles that can interfere with typing of important codons such as the case of ARK for codon 171. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Rickettsia felis is an obligate intracellular bacterium belonging to the spotted fever group, suspected to cause a murine typhus-like illness in humans, with a cosmopolitan distribution. This study was designed to estimate presence and occurrence of this pathogen in fleas collected from dogs and cats in different areas of Italy. Two species of fleas were identified, Ctenocephalides felis (80.3%) and Ctenocephalides canis (19.7%). Overall, 320 fleas (257 C. felis and 63 C. canis) collected from 117 animals (73 dogs and 44 cats) were tested. Thirty-eight (11.9%) C. felis fleas, 13 from cats (17.6%) and 25 from dogs (10.2%) were positive for R. felis. No C. canis was positive. Fleas from cats showed a tendency to be more positive than fleas from dogs. Prevalence of R. felis among areas and within provinces of the same area was extremely variable, ranging from 0 to 35.3%. Overall, prevalence in north-eastern Italy (23.2%) was significantly higher than in south-western Italy (7.1%). This study confirmed the occurrence of R. felis in cat and dog fleas (C. felis) from Italy, similar to other European countries. The results also suggest that R. felis should be considered in the human differential diagnosis of any spotted-like fever in Italy, especially if the patient is known to have been exposed to flea bites.},

abstract={The interferon (IFN) system is a major effector of the innate immunity that allows time for the subsequent establishment of an adaptive immune response against a wide-range of pathogens. Their diverse biological actions are thought to be mediated by the products of specific but usually overlapping sets of cellular genes induced in the target cells. Ubiquitin ligase members of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family have emerged as IFN-induced proteins involved in both innate and adaptive immunity. In this report, we provide evidence that TRIM22 is a functional E3 ubiquitin ligase that is also ubiquitinated itself. We demonstrate that TRIM22 expression leads to a viral protection of HeLa cells against encephalomyocarditis virus infections. This effect is dependent upon its E3 ubiquitinating activity, since no antiviral effect was observed in cells expressing a TRIM22-deletion mutant defective in ubiquitinating activity. Consistent with this, TRIM22 interacts with the viral 3C protease (3CPRO) and mediates its ubiquitination. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that TRIM22 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity represents a new antiviral pathway induced by IFN against picornaviruses. © 2009 SGM.},

abstract={The lesions observed in 16 wild boars, hunted in central Italy, led to the suspect that could be related to the infection by porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). The animals had macroscopic and histological lesions in the lungs, tonsils, and bronchial lymph nodes. PCV2 was detected in tissue samples by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry and it was isolated in newborn swine kidney cell cultures. From the infected cell culture supernatant, the presence of PCV2 DNA was confirmed by real-time PCR whereas virus particles were observed by electron microscopy. These diagnostic data indicate that PCV2 can infect and cause disease in Sus scrofa subspecies other than domestic swine and it is present in the wild boar population in central Italy. © Springer-Verlag 2009.},

abstract={Amino-acid polymorphisms of the ovine prion protein have been known to influence susceptibility to scrapie for many years. Recently, a role in both classical and atypical scrapie was assigned to new mutations, increasing the overall number of polymorphisms of interest for breeding plans. Besides, the high number and density of polymorphisms in the prion protein gene (PrP) and the presence of unusual mutations in some breeds hampers genotyping methods, making multiplexing difficult and sometimes compromising analytical results. We developed a multiplex genotyping method for the ovine PrP that overcomes the limitations posed by the high number and density of the polymorphisms to interrogate. Nine primers were designed to be compatible in a single primer-extension reaction developed for routine genotyping, with the capacity to identify the following polymorphisms: A136V, M137T, L141F, I142K, R154H, Q171R, Q171H, Q171K and N176K. Site-specific mutations were inserted in primer sequences in order to prevent extension of reciprocally complementary primers. Complete accuracy and repeatability of the assay was assessed with reference to 97 sequenced samples. The presented method constitutes an improved tool for ovine PrP genotyping and a general strategy for the use of primer extension in a genetic context of high density of polymorphisms. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The presence of zeranol (α-zearalanol) in urine samples due to natural contamination or illegal treatment is under debate within the European Union. The simultaneous determination of zeranol, its epimer taleranol (β-zearalanol), zearalanone and the structurally related mycotoxin zearalenone with the corresponding α- and β-zearalenol metabolites appears to be critical in deciding whether an illegal use has occurred. The aim of this study is to develop and validate a simple analytical procedure applicable to bovine and swine urine samples for the determination of all six resorcylic acid lactones. After an enzymatic deconjugation, the urine was subjected to a one-step cleanup on a commercially available immunoaffinity chromatography cartridge. The analytes were detected by liquid chromatography-negative-ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry using deuterium-labelled internal standards. The method was validated as a quantitative confirmatory method according to European Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. The evaluated parameters were: linearity, specificity, precision (repeatability and intra-laboratory reproducibility), recovery, decision limit, detection capability and ruggedness. The decision limits (CCα) obtained, were between 0.56 and 0.68 μg L-1; recovery above 66% for all the analytes. Repeatability was between 1.4 and 5.3% and within-laboratory reproducibility between 1.9 and 16.1% for the six resorcylic acid lactones. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={INTRODUCTION - The contamination of bulk milk from pathogenic microorganisms such as C. jejuni is assuming more importance as a consequence of the increasing consumption of raw milk.We describe two cases of dairy farms located in the Po Valley, characterised by repeated detection of C. jejuni in bulk milk. In both cases the source of contamination of bulk milk (and consequently of raw milk) was due to a cased of mammary infection in a cow. CASES - In both cases just one infected quarter of a single cow was able to contaminate the bulk milk of respectively 270 and 180 lactating cows. The persistent infection of the quarter was documented for at least 90 days in one herd and for 30-40 days in the other herd. Antibiotic treatment of the infected cow in the first farm was effective in the cure of mammary infection. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS - Although C. jejuni was also detected in the faeces of some animals, the segregation of the subject with mammary infection was effective in eliminating the primary source of contamination, with the result of an undetectable level of the microrganism in bulk milk. The analysis of pooled milk samples by culture and PCR, followed by individual testing, prooved to be efficient tools for the identification of infected subjects. These data demonstrate the importance to consider the possibility of udder infection of even a single cow, as a source of bulk milk contamination, when C. jejuni is repeatedly detected.},

abstract={Interferon-α (IFN-α) at low concentrations had been previously shown to control the expression of inflammatory cytokine genes in swine pulmonary alveolar macrophages. In the first part of this study, cultured swine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were supplemented with IFN-α at low/moderate concentrations, and then stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The expression of IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-1Β, TNF-α, and IL-6 genes was determined by real-time PCR. IFN-α at low/moderate concentrations did not significantly reduce the expression of any cytokine gene under study, with clear trends though to a concentration-dependent reduction of IL-1Β gene expression and to a concentration-dependent increase of IFN-γ gene expression. In vivo, orally administered IFN-α was shown instead to modulate the inflammatory response to early weaning in uncultured PBMCs of specific pathogen-free piglets. As opposed to the in vitro model, the oral IFN-α treatment reduced after weaning the expression of the IFN-γ gene (P < 0.08) and increased that of the IL-1Β gene (P < 0.05). There was also a trend to a reduced expression of both IL-6 and TNF-α. The above modulation of cytokine genes expression and the greater daily mean weight gain of treated piglets highlight important regulatory properties of oral IFN-α in the response to the weaning stress. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract={A field study was conducted to investigate the use of a diagnostic approach, based on lymph-nodal cytology and sera and lymph-nodal Real time PCR on pigs belonging to two herds. The first herd showed severe PCVAD/PMWS with herd losses approximately of 12-13%. The second herd showed prevalently a sub-clinical PCV-2 infection with herd losses of about 6- 7%. In the latter, the study was performed before and after the vaccination against PCV-2 on three weeks-old piglets. This diagnostic approach, using lymph nodal cytology and Real time PCR on lymph nodes could be appropriate for herds with clinical PMWS/PCVAD (Post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome/Porcine Circovirus Associated Disease). On the contrary in herds in which a sub-clinical PCV-2 infection is present, Real time PCR on sera seems to represent the better approach to understand the disease development and the sub-clinical PCV-2 infection severity. Two, nine and sixteen weeks after the vaccination, pigs showed no viremia, as well as a significant improvement of productivity performances with a consequent reduction of herd losses (3-4%). The results of Real time PCR after vaccination need to be further investigated and must not be used to evaluate the vaccination efficacy.},

abstract={A simple and rapid multiresidue method for the determination of seven sulphonamides residues (sulfadiazine, sulfapyridine, sulfamerazine, sulfamethazine, sulfamonomethoxine, sulfadimethoxine and sulfaquinoxaline) in milk samples was developed and validated. The drugs were extracted with a mixture chloroform/acetone and simply cleaned up on a cation exchange solid phase extraction column. The analytes determination was carried out using liquid chromatography with diode array detection (DAD). The procedure has validated as a quantitative confirmatory method according to the European Union (EU) Decision 2002/657/EC. The developed method shows good linearity, specificity, precision (repeatability and intra-laboratory reproducibility), ruggedness and is able to confirm each sulphonamide residue above 30 μg kg-1. Decision limits (CCα) around 110 μg kg-1 and recovery above 56% were obtained for all the analytes. The results of the validation process demonstrate that the method is suitable for application, as confirmatory method, in European Union statutory veterinary drug residue surveillance programmes. In addition, a hypothetical situation of sample judgement (compliance or not) in the case in which, at the same time, two different sulphonamides are found, is discussed. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Specific antibodies to plasmid-encoded protein pgp3 are known to be encountered in human Chlamydia (C.) trachomatis infections. In order to verify whether antibodies to this protein could be developed in animals infected with plasmid-carrying chlamydial strains, 454 animal sera were examined using a home-made pgp3 protein ELISA and Western blots (WB) of recombinant pgp3 protein from Chlamydophila (Cp.) psittaci. Likewise, 50 human sera were tested by ELISA and WB of recombinant pgp3 from C. trachomatis. The reactivity against pgp3 protein was compared to the reactivity against chlamydial elementary bodies (EBs) detected by microimmunofluorescence (MIF) test. The presence of pgp3-specific antibodies was demonstrated in most ducks and pigeons with Cp. psittaci infection detected by MIF, as well as in the majority of symptomatic cats and pigs infected with Cp. felis and C. suis, respectively, which reacted at high titres to Cp. felis and C. suis EBs by MIF. Moreover, most of the sera collected from patients with C. trachomatis culture-confirmed infection and seropositive to C. trachomatis by MIF, presented antibodies specific to C. trachomatis pgp3 recombinant protein. Therefore, pgp3 protein could be a useful marker of chlamydial infections in animals, as well as in humans. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The avian and human pathogen Chlamydophila (C.) psittaci represents a genetically heterogeneous species. To facilitate epidemiological surveys, more rapid yet highly specific molecular tests are needed. Currently used typing methods, i.e. serotyping and PCR-RFLP, have only limited sensitivity and are incapable of covering the wide spectrum of naturally occurring types of C. psittaci strains. In the present study, a new DNA microarray assay based on the ArrayTube® (AT) technology was used to genotype C. psittaci in 98 isolates and 23 clinical tissue samples. The present array carries 35 oligonucleotide probes derived from variable domains 2 and 4 of the ompA gene. The assay proved highly sensitive, allowing correct genotyping of DNA from 2 inclusion-forming units. The results of DNA microarray genotyping of cultured strains proved highly concordant with the data from PCR-RFLP typing and serotyping. Sequencing of the ompA gene served as the reference test to verify the accuracy of AT genotyping results. In 15 instances (15.3%), strains were successfully typed by the AT assay, while serotyping and/or PCR-RFLP genotyping failed to produce unambiguous results. Eleven of these samples were ompA sequenced to confirm the AT findings. In addition to the currently accepted nine ompA genotypes, the microarray test was shown to recognise new provisional genotypes, such as Mat116 and YP84. In conclusion, the new AT assay proved to be suitable for rapid, sensitive and reproducible genotyping of C. psittaci strains and can be recommended for routine diagnosis. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Feral pigeons (Columba livia domestica), which thrive in most European towns and cities, are commonly infected with the zoonotic bacterium Chlamydophila psittaci, the agent of psittacosis (also known as ornithosis) in humans. A number of surveys carried out over the last thirty years across Europe have detected high seropositivity values and high percentages of infection in feral pigeon populations. Overall, when considering data from 11 European countries, seropositivity values to C. psittaci in the sampled populations ranged from 19.4% to 95.6%. In most surveys, the complement fixation test was used, and antibodies were detected in 19.4-66.3% of the samples, with a median of 46.1%. Indirect immunofluorescence and ELISA tests were employed less frequently, but led to the detection of higher percentages of seropositivity (23.7-67.7% and 35.9-95.6%, respectively). Attempts to grow C. psittaci in cell culture or embryonated chicken eggs were successful in 2-42.3% and 0-57.1% of samples, respectively, antigen detection methods were positive in 2.3-40% of samples, while conventional PCR and real-time PCR using different genomic targets detected the organism in 3.4-50% of samples. Twenty-five C. psittaci isolates from pigeons were typed as ompA genotype B (n = 14), E (n = 10) and E/B (n = 1). The huge increase of feral pigeon populations in Europe is a major cause of concern for the detrimental effect of pigeon droppings on environmental hygiene, in addition to the extensive damage due to the fouling of buildings and monuments. The most important pathogenic organism transmissible from feral pigeons to humans is C. psittaci, with 101 cases of disease reported in the literature. Exposure to C. psittaci-contaminated dust, direct contact with pigeons through handling and, to a lesser extent, through pigeon feeding have been identified as hazardous exposures in more than half of the human cases, while loose or transient contacts with feral pigeons have been mentioned in about 40% of the cases. Education initiatives as to the communication of a health risk resulting from contact with pigeons and pigeon excreta should primarily be targeted at individuals who may be exposed to C. psittaci-contaminated dust, such as demolition/construction workers. Recommendations to this category of workers include wearing protective clothes with hoods, boots, gloves and air filter face masks when removing pigeon faeces from roofs, garrets and buildings, especially if working indoors. Monitoring for C. psittaci infections in these workers over time should also be considered. Children should be warned not to handle sick or dead pigeons, and immunocompromised individuals should be advised to carefully limit their contact to feral pigeons. Culling of pigeons by shooting or poisoning is both unethical and ineffective as the place of the killed birds in the population is quickly filled by new juveniles or immigrating birds from neighbouring areas. Pigeon-deterring systems, such as nets and plastic or metal spikes applied to buildings and monuments will prevent their fouling, and the administration of contraceptive drugs may allow size regulation of the pigeon populations. Nevertheless, the measure that will ultimately lead to permanent reduction and will establish healthy sustainable populations is the restriction of indiscriminate feeding by pigeon lovers. The erection of dovecotes and artificial breeding facilities should be considered for providing shelter and a balanced diet to the birds, as well as a chance of interaction for pigeon lovers in a hygienically controlled environment. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Introduction: In the last years, tissue engineering has attracted lots of researchers, in urology too. This is due to the possibility to use this technique in several pathologies' therapies, which generally require reconstructive surgical solutions. Our work's aim is to evaluate morphological and functional aspects of cultivated urothelial and detrusorial tissues', both in "monolayer growth" and on scaffolds, in order to understand the chance of using them in reconstructive surgery. Materials and methods: tissue cultures of detrusorial and urothelial cells have been obtained from animals (pigs, rabbits) and men. The urothelial nature of obtained cells has been demonstrated by traditional histological observation (Hematoxylin - Eosin), by immuno-fluorescence assay (specific for cyto-keratins antibodies), by immuno-histo-chemistry techniques (using specific cyto-keratins 7, 17, and 20 antibodies). Detrusorial tissue has been studied by using antibodies specific for alpha-actin. Results: urothelial and smooth muscle cells, when isolated and expanded in vitro, keep the typical characteristics of original tissue, as showed by classical histological observation (H-E), immuno-histo-chemistry and immuno-fluorence assays. These results were positive both in monolayer colonies and on scaffolds. In vitro results are encouraging and they demonstrate that it is possible to obtain in vitro vesical tissue that could have analogous characteristics to the original organ; even though clinical utilisation of this technique must be more investigated, both in vitro and in vivo.},

abstract={Spoligotyping and exact tandem repeat (ETR) analysis of Mycobacterium bovis and M. caprae isolated strains has been routinely carried out in Italy since 2000 to obtain a database of genetic profiles and support traditional epidemiological investigations. In this study, we characterized 1,503 M. bovis and 57 M. caprae isolates obtained from 2000 to 2006 in 747 cattle herds mainly located in northern Italy. We identified 81 spoligotypes and 113 ETR profiles, while the combination of spoligotyping/ETR analysis differentiated 228 genotypes, with genotypic diversity indices of 0.70 (spoligotyping), 0.94 (ETR-A to -E typing), and 0.97 (spoligotyping/ETR-A to -E typing), respectively. Despite the high degree of resolution obtained, the spoligotyping/ ETR methods were not discriminative enough in the case of genotypes characterized by the combination of SB0120, the predominant spoligotype in Italy, with the most common ETR profiles. To obtain a more informative subset of typing loci, 24 mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable-number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) markers were evaluated by analyzing a panel of 100 epidemiologically unrelated SB0120 isolates. The panel was differentiated into 89 profiles with an overall genotypic diversity of 0.987 that could be also achieved by using a minimal group of 13 loci: ETR-A, -B, and -E; MIRU 26 and 40; and VNTR 2163a, 2163b, 3155, 1612, 4052, 1895, 3232, and 3336. The allelic diversity index and the stability of single loci was evaluated to provide the most discriminative genotyping method for locally prevalent strains.

Overall, 161 BTM samples out of 400 (i.e. 40%) tested positive.We then collected a further BTM sample from several C. burnetii positive herds as well as from C. burnetii-negative herds, for confirming or excluding the result of the first assay. The second sample tested positive and negative, respectively, in about 62% of positive herds and in about 70% of negative herds. The detection of C. burnetii in cows' milk has been already documented in the past. The occurrence of the organism in BTM depends on the number of infected lactating cows and on the presence of C. burnetii super-shedders in the herd. An increase or decrease in the number of milk-shedder cows will accordingly affect the result of the BTM testing. The effects of the infection on the fertility of cows, as well as the implications for the health of professionally and accidentally exposed humans should be investigated.},

abstract={Pulmonary inflammation often results in expression of the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHCII) by both professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs; histiocytes and lymphocytes) and non-professional APCs (respiratory epithelium and endothelium). In this study lesions from 17 cases of bovine chronic pneumonia, associated with Mycoplasma bovis infection, were examined immunohistochemically for M. bovis antigen and MHCII expression. Ten cases of chronic necrosuppurative bronchopneumonia (NBP) were shown to be characterized by abundant perinecrotic M. bovis antigen associated with scant MHCII expression by degenerate leucocytes. Seven cases of chronic catarrhal bronchointerstitial pneumonia (CBP) showed prominent MHCII expression by both professional APCs and respiratory epithelium, in the absence of intralesional M. bovis immunolabelling. The results suggest that prominent MHCII expression by both professional and non-professional APCs plays a role in the pathogenesis of M. bovis-induced CBP. Conversely, the role of MHCII expression in necrosuppurative foci typical of M. bovis-associated NBP can be considered negligible. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In 2001, a compulsory active surveillance system was started in the European Union to assess the prevalence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the cattle population. The aim of the current study was to report on the field performances of 3 rapid tests: a Western blot (WB), a chemiluminescence enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and an immunochromatographic assay, routinely used at 3 laboratories of the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale of Lombardia and Emilia Romagna, over 8 years of BSE monitoring activity. A total of 2,802,866 samples from slaughtered animals and 202,453 samples from fallen stock were tested by 1 of 3 tests. Positive results of the rapid tests were confirmed by histopathological examination, immunohistochemistry, and confirmatory WB. The field performances (i.e., initial reactive and false-positive rates) and practical aspects regarding resources and applicability of the tests to high-throughput routine testing laboratories were evaluated. The 3 tests proved to be reliable tools when applied to slaughtered samples, showing no or very low false-positive rates (,1 per 100,000 negative samples tested) and low retesting frequencies (0.02-0.26%). When samples from fallen stock were analyzed, performances of the immunochromatographic assay, and especially the chemiluminescence ELISA, were negatively affected, resulting in higher false-positive and retesting rates. On the other hand, both tests are less expensive, much easier to use, provide more rapid results, and adapt well to application in routine laboratories as compared with WB. In the authors' experience, the immunochromatographic assay was a good compromise between performance and convenience.},

abstract={The aim of this investigation was to compare different indices for evaluating nutritional conditions of red deer (Cervus elaphus) in an alpine environment during the autumn in order to detect the most convenient ones for management purposes in our specific situation. Body conditions of 274 red deer were evaluated using kidney fat index, back fat index and body condition scores. Body Condition Scores was the easiest but the least reliable method. Both kidney fat index and back fat index were significantly affected by age and sex class (always lower in younger animals) and, in females, also by lactation status. In stags, a negative regression effect of culling date on both kidney fat index and back fat index was observed. A significant positive correlation between kidney fat index and back fat index was recorded. Both kidney fat index and back fat index were objective indicators of nutritional status and sensitive to changes in physical conditions, but back fat index was both quicker and easier to be measured. As a direct implication, we suggest that back fat index can be a practical and reliable indicator for monitoring red deer conditions in alpine areas during the autumn, provided that the effects of sex, age and date of culling are taken into account.},

abstract={Total reflection x-ray fluorescence (TXRF) is a technique well established for chemical analysis of samples deposited as a thin layer. Nowadays it is mainly employed for electronic industry quality control. Recently, very compact and economic TXRF instrumentation was proposed. Combining this with the capability to analyze liquid samples, this technique is suitable to be employed in many different applications, comprising the very critical field of environmental analysis. Comparisons with the standard atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) technique show that TXRF is a practical, accurate, and reliable technique. Indeed, round-robin activities have already been started. Despite the efficiency and economy of the developed portable TXRF instrumentation, this is not widely employed for chemical laboratory analysis probably because TXRF is not an officially recognized technique, i.e. it is not yet normative-subjected. This fact could also be due to the long background of analytical applications developed for AAS, ICPS or inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) up to now. In this paper, we present a work of environmental monitoring of an industrial site, performed by means of bioindicators (lichens). The analysis of trace elements concentration in lichen was usually conducted with spectrophotometric techniques, such as AAS and ICP-MS, which were accepted by common regulations and normative-subjected. In this study, we accomplished a comparative lichen analysis by AAS and TXRF. The reproducibility of the obtained results showed the high correspondence between the two techniques. This comparison highlighted the versatility of the TXRF apparatus that allowed more rapid and simultaneous element detection. The obtained results suggested that this portable TXRF system could be suitable for regulation to produce certificated analysis upto ppb concentrations for some elements. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Potato gnocchi are usually sold in package reporting the instructions for consumers "cook in boiling salted water until rising to the surface". The object of this trial was to verify if this treatment is sufficient to inactivate botulinum toxin in case of gnocchi accidentally contaminated with C/. botulinum. Four different types of gnocchi produced by the same factory were contaminated with botulinum toxin obtained from a broth medium of four different C/. botulinum strains. Each type of gnocchi was put in a pan of boiling salted water and different portions were taken at floating and also after one minute from floating. The botulinum toxin, using a biological test conducted on mice, was not found in any of analysed samples. Therefore the potential possibility of the presence of botulinum toxin in gnocchi remains remote, but it does not represent a risk for consumers who cook this type of product properly.},

abstract={In human neurology, patients with Alzheimer's disease show seizures and signs of motor deficits, such as movement disorders (i.e., restlessness, slowness, impaired gait, and, rarely, resting tremors). Because canine Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome (CDS) is considered an Alzheimer-like disease in dogs, it might be possible to document concurrent behavioral and neurologic signs in aging canine patients as well. Twenty-one dogs (14 dogs with CDS-related signs, 7 normal dogs) greater than 7 years of age were studied. Owners completed a behavioral questionnaire and the dogs underwent a neurologic evaluation. Dogs with CDS were twice as likely to show neurologic deficits as dogs without CDS. However, based on this pilot study, a sample of 187 dogs affected with CDS are required to show statistically significant differences between the proportions of dogs with CDS and with neurologic signs and the proportions of control dogs without any of these disorders. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={A lateral flow device (LFD) for the detection of all seven serotypes of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) was developed using a monoclonal antibody (Mab 1F10) shown to be pan-reactive to FMDV strains of each serotype by ELISA. The performance of the LFD was evaluated in the laboratory on suspensions of vesicular epithelia (304 positive and 1003 negative samples) from suspected cases of vesicular disease collected from 86 countries between 1965 and 2008 and negative samples collected from healthy animals. The diagnostic sensitivity of the LFD for FMDV was similar at 84% compared to 85% obtained by the reference method of antigen ELISA, and the diagnostic specificity of the LFD was approximately 99% compared to 99.9% for the ELISA. The device recognized FMDV strains of wide diversity of all seven serotypes but weaker reactions were often evident with those of type SAT 2, several viruses of which were not detected. Reactions with the viruses of swine vesicular disease and vesicular stomatitis that produce clinically indistinguishable syndromes in pigs and cattle, did not occur. The test procedure was simple and rapid, and typically provided a result within 1-10 min of sample addition. Simple homogenizers that could be used in field conditions for preparing epithelial suspensions were demonstrated to be effective for LFD application. These data illustrate the potential for the LFD to be used next to the animal in the pen-side diagnosis of FMD and for providing rapid and objective support to veterinarians in their clinical judgment of the disease. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Besides, APEC were serotyped. O78 has been the most detected serotyped. The presence of the tested virulence genes was prevalently related to the APEC isolates. With reference to serogroup, all the tested O78 resulted iss and irp2 positive. Besides, tsh e cva/cvi were respectively present in 88.9 and 83.3% of O78. Nevertheless, the finding of a not typeable strains equipped with all the eight tested virulence genes among the APEC isolates suggest the importance of a careful and complete characterisation of the isolate to evaluate the real potential pathogenic attitude of the bacterium.},

abstract={The effect of the fluorescent light exposure and type of packaging (normal atmosphere and oxygen-rich atmosphere) was evaluated on the oxidation parameters (peroxides and cholesterol oxidation products) of raw beef slices placed in packed vessels and refrigerated. The concentration of COPs in meat treated under modified atmosphere ranged from 0.15 to 0.52 mg/100 g meat (average value of 0.27 mg COPs/100 g meat), which was twice as much as the average COPs content (0.14 mg/100 g) of meat packed under air (0.04-0.27 mg COPs/100 g meat). The main cholesterol oxide was 7k, which represented about one third of the total cholesterol oxides, followed by 7β-OH (20-25% of total COPs), 7α-OH (about 20%) and β-epoxy (12-18%). In normal atmosphere, photoxidation was a superficial process, since an inverse correlation between meat slice weight and COPs content on a lipid basis was observed, unlike in a high oxygen (32%) atmosphere. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={An outbreak of clinical mastitis was observed in dairy goats due to the zoonotic pathogen Streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus. Affected goats were culled to prevent transmission of infection to other animals or humans. The objective of the study was to determine whether horses on the same farm were the source of the pathogen. Streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus was obtained from milk of 10% of goats in the herd and from feces of 3 of 7 healthy horses that shared pasture and housing with the goats. Isolates of caprine and equine origin had identical biochemical profiles, including the ability to ferment sorbitol and lactose, which distinguishes S. equi ssp. zooepidemicus from S. equi ssp. equi. Sequencing of the 16S-23S intergenic spacer region and results from sodA-seel multiplex PCR supported identification of isolates as S. equi ssp. zooepidemicus. Based on random amplified polymorphic DNA typing and rpoB and sodA sequencing, caprine isolates were indistinguishable from each other, but distinct from equine isolates. Further analysis of equine fecal samples showed that multiple strains of S. equi ssp. zooepidemicus can be present in a single sample or in sequential samples obtained from a single horse. Failure to detect the mastitis-causing strain in equine feces may indicate that horses were not the source of the mastitis outbreak in goats. Alternatively, the outbreak may be due to presence of multiple S. equi ssp. zooepidemicus strains in equine feces and a failure to detect all strains when analyzing a limited number of isolates per sample. © American Dairy Science Association, 2009.},

abstract={Between 2002 and 2007, more than 1000 chickens from commercial farms, live bird markets and backyard farms in Nigeria and Niger were tested for the presence of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) genome. Phylogenetic analysis of full-length sequences of the spike 1 (S1) gene revealed a new genotype of IBV that we refer to as 'IBADAN'. The minimum genetic distance to the closest 'non-IBADAN' strains (UK/7/93 at the nucleotide level; H120 and M41 at the amino acid level) reached 24 and 32% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. The full genome of the IBADAN reference strain (NGA/A116E7/2006) had a genetic distance of 9.7-16.4% at the nucleotide level with all available fully sequenced strains. As IBV S1 plays a major role in antigenicity, the antigenic relatedness of NGA/A116E7/2006 was compared with strains of other serotypes. NGA/A116E7/2006 did not cross-react with antisera against IT02, M41, D274, Connecticut or 793/B strains in virus neutralization assays. NGA/A116E7/2006 cross-reacted with the QX-like strain ITA/90254/2005 but only to a low level (antigenic relatedness of 33 %), suggesting that IBADAN also represents a new serotype. A comparison of S1 sequences identified several amino acids that may play a role in IBV antigenicity. Despite the absence of obvious clinical signs in poultry infected by IBADAN strains, it is important to test the cross-protection of current vaccine strains. © 2009 SGM.},

For the enrolment in the study 214 male cattle, weighing 357 to 546 kg, were imported from France. At arrival, all the animals were vaccinated, dewormed and managed as per normal farm practices. In the first days following the arrival of the animals to the farm, the BRD outbreak was confirmed by clinical and microbiological assessments (presence of P.multocida, H. somni e M. bovis) on 18 animals with respiratory signs, then, all the animals were treated with Tulathromycin (G1 = 96) or Tilmicosin (G2 = 97) in commercial formulations and following the label instructions. In the two weeks following the treatment, Tulathromycin showed an high efficacy in BRD prevention (97,8%), significantly higher than Tilmicosin (89,1%, p = 0,0326). The comparison of daily weight gain of the two groups showed an overall improvement of production performance of the animals treated with Tulathromycin (average body weight = 537 kg, IPG = 1,69 kg/day) when compared to those treated with Tilmicosin (average body weight = 530 kg, IPG = 1,57 kg/day).

abstract={Chlamydophila pecorum is an obligate intracellular bacterium associated with different pathological conditions in ruminants, swine and koala, which is also found in the intestine of asymptomatic animals. A multi-virulence locus sequence typing (MVLST) system was developed using 19 C. pecorum strains (8 pathogenic and 11 non-pathogenic intestinal strains) isolated from ruminants of different geographical origins. To evaluate the ability of MVLST to distinguish the pathogenic from the non-pathogenic strains of C. pecorum, the sequences of 12 genes were analysed: 6 potential virulence genes (ompA, incA, incB, incC, mip and copN), 5 housekeeping genes (recA, hemD, aroC, efp, gap), and the ORF663 gene encoding a hypothetical protein (HP) that includes a variant 15-nucleotides coding tandem repeat (CTR). MVLST provided high discriminatory power (100%) in allowing to distinguish 6 of 8 pathogenic strains in a single group, and overall more discriminatory than MLST targeting housekeeping genes. ompA was the most polymorphic gene and the phylogenetic tree based only on its sequence differentiated 4 groups with high bootstrap values. The number of CTRs (rich in serine, proline and lysine) in ORF663 detected in the pathogenic strains was generally lower than that found in the intestinal strains. MVLST appears to be a promising method for the differential identification of virulent C. pecorum strains, and the ompA, incA and ORF663 genes appear to be good molecular markers for further epidemiological investigation of C. pecorum. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Objectives: Avian-like H1N1 and human-like H3N2 swine influenza viruses (SIV) have been considered widespread among pigs in Western Europe since the 1980s, and a novel H1N2 reassortant with a human-like H1 emerged in the mid 1990s. This study, which was part of the EC-funded 'European Surveillance Network for Influenza in Pigs 1', aimed to determine the seroprevalence of the H1N2 virus in different European regions and to compare the relative prevalences of each SIV between regions. Design: Laboratories from Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Poland and Spain participated in an international serosurvey. A total of 4190 sow sera from 651 farms were collected in 2002-2003 and examined in haemagglutination inhibition tests against H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2. Results: In Belgium, Germany, Italy and Spain seroprevalence rates to each of the three SIV subtypes were high (≥30% of the sows seropositive) to very high (≥50%), except for a lower H1N2 seroprevalence rate in Italy (13-8%). Most sows in these countries with high pig populations had antibodies to two or three subtypes. In Ireland, the Czech Republic and Poland, where swine farming is less intensive, H1N1 was the dominant subtype (8-11.7% seropositives) and H1N2 and H3N2 antibodies were rare (0-4.2% seropositives). Conclusions: Thus, SIV of H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2 subtype are enzootic in swine producing regions of Western Europe. In Central Europe, SIV activity is low and the circulation of H3N2 and H1N2 remains to be confirmed. The evolution and epidemiology of SIV throughout Europe is being further monitored through a second 'European Surveillance Network for Influenza in Pigs'. © 2008 The Authors Journal Compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Aims: To investigate the presence of enteric viruses [hepatitis A (HAV) and norovirus (NoV)] in shellfish harvested from the deltaic area of the Po river in relation to environmental factors. Methods and Results: Fortnightly sampling of shellfish was carried out in two lagoon areas (category B production areas) and one sea area (category A). Environmental parameters in the lagoon and hydrometric level of the tributary river were monitored throughout the sampling period. Samples (n = 120) were analysed for bacterial (E. coli and Salmonella) and viral (HAV and NoV) contamination; samples from category B areas were analysed before and after purification treatment. All the samples were negative for HAV whereas 10 samples (8.3%), all harvested in the lagoon areas, were positive for NoV. Sequencing identified the strains as genotypes II.4 and II.b. None of the samples was found to be contaminated after depuration. Conclusions: The monitoring showed a low frequency of NoV presence; viral contamination, detected exclusively in shellfish collected from the deltaic area (category B), could be influenced by the flow of the tributary river. Significance and Impact of the Study: The data collected are useful for the design of targeted prevention strategies and for the modulation of control plans after meteorological events. © 2008 The Authors.},

abstract={One of the major risks in cell culture laboratories is the misidentification and cross-contamination of cell lines. Several methods have been used to authenticate cell lines, including isoenzyme profiling, the test suggested by European Farmacopeia, which is performed at the Tissue Culture Centre in Brescia. However, this method displays several disadvantages, such as high variability and low reproducibility, and it is time consuming and requires high cell concentrations to be performed. Therefore, an alternative method has been developed to confirm the specie of origin of 27 different animal cell cultures. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay was optimized, based on the use of a pair of primers that anneal to a portion of the cytochrome b gene in all the species. The amplification product was digested with a panel of six restriction enzymes, and the pattern derived was resolved on 3% high-resolution agarose gel. For 23 species, this protocol produced a unique restriction pattern, and the origin of these animal cells resulted to be confirmed by this analysis. Furthermore, results indicate that cytochrome b PCR-RFLP was able to amplify target sequences using very low amounts of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Its sensitivity in detecting interspecies, cross-contamination was comparable to that of isoenzyme analysis (contaminating DNA should represent at least 10% of the total DNA). For 4 of the 27 species (sheep, dog, Guinea pig, and Rhesus monkey) the observed pattern, even if highly reproducible, showed additional bands; for these species, specific PCR was also performed. © 2008 The Society for In Vitro Biology.},

abstract={Mycoplasma bovis is an important cause of calf pneumonia worldwide. In this study, we examined 140 cattle at slaughter comprising 70 veal calves and 70 beef cattle; 115 animals with pneumonic lesions and 25 without. Lung samples were submitted for bacteriological, histological, and M. bovis-immunohistochemical analyses. Serology for M. bovis was positive in 76% of beef cattle and 100% of veal calves. M. bovis was isolated only from veal calves in 16 out of 64 pneumonic cases. M. bovis was detected by immunohistochemistry in seven bacteriologically positive cases. M. bovis antigen was associated with bronchogenic necrosuppurative or fibrinonecrotizing lesions. Bacteriologically positive and immunohistochemical negative cases were associated with catarrhal bronchointerstitial pneumonia. Results suggest that M. bovis infection may develop into a severe necrosuppurative bronchopneumonia or fibrinonecrotizing pneumonia when associated with a high number of intralesional organisms or, conversely, into a mild catarrhal bronchointerstitial pneumonia when associated with a low number of organisms. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Purpose: Chlamydia psittaci (Cp) has been associated to ocular adnexal lymphomas (OAL) with variable geographic distribution. Herein, we used multiple Chlamydia detection tools to identify Cp elementary bodies - containing cell and to assess Cp prevalence in both nodal and extranodal lymphomas. Experimental Design: TETR-PCR, immunohistochemistry, Immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, and laser-capture microdissection were done in 35 OALs to define their effect in Chlamydia detection and, moreover, to identify the Cp cellular carrier. Cp prevalence was screened by TETR-PCR in 205 extraorbital lymphomas and 135 nonneoplastic controls. Results: Twenty-six (74%) OALs were associated with Cp infection: immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and laser-capture microdissection-assisted PCR showed that monocytes/macrophages were the Cp carriers; electron microscopy showed the presence of intact Cp elementary bodies into these cells. Immunohistochemistry and TETR-PCR showed a 70% concordance rate (P - 0.001). Cp DNA was equally prevalent in non-OAL, nodal, and extranodal lymphomas: among the latter, it was more common in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas of the skin (P = 0.03) and Waldeyer's ring. Conclusions: This multiparametric approach shows, for the first time, that monocytes/macrophages are the carriers of Cp, Cp seems preferentially associated with lymphomas arising in organs primarily exposed to antigens. The clinical implications of these findings deserve to be prospectively investigated. © 2008 American Association for Cancer Research.},

abstract={We demonstrate that blockade of the MEK/ERK signaling module, using the small-molecule inhibitors PD184352 or PD325901 (PD), strikingly enhances arsenic trioxide (ATO)-induced cytotoxicity in human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs) and in tumor cells from patients with multiple myeloma (MM) through a caspase-dependent mechanism. In HMCLs retaining a functional p53, PD treatment greatly enhances the ATO-induced p53 accumulation and p73, a p53 paralog, cooperates with p53 in caspase activation and apoptosis induction. In HMCLs carrying a nonfunctional p53, cotreatment with PD strikingly elevates the (DR4 + DR5)/(DcR1 + DcR2) tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors ratio and caspase-8 activation of ATO-treated cells. In MM cells, irrespective of p53 status, the combined PD/ATO treatment increases the level of the proapoptotic protein Bim (PD-mediated) and decreases antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 (ATO-mediated). Moreover, Bim physically interacts with both DR4 and DR5 TRAIL receptors in PD/ATO-treated cells, and loss of Bim interferes with the activation of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in response to PD/ATO. Finally, PD/ATO treatment induces tumor regression, prolongs survival, and is well tolerated in vivo in a human plasmacytoma xenograft model. These preclinical studies provide the framework for testing PD325901 and ATO combination therapy in clinical trials aimed to improve patient outcome in MM. © 2008 by The American Society of Hematology.},

abstract={Ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma (OAML) is linked to Chlamydophila psittaci (Cp) infection. Viability and infectivity of Cp, demonstrated by growth in culture, has not been yet investigated in these patients. We conducted a single-center prospective case-control study to assess the prevalence, viability and infectivity of Cp in 20 OAML patients and 42 blood donors registered in a 6-month period. The presence of Cp in conjunctival swabs and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients and donors was assessed by TETR-PCR and in vitro cultures. From an epidemiological point of view, OAML patients often resided in rural areas, and reported a history of chronic conjunctivitis and prolonged contact with household animals (85% vs. 38% of donors; p = 0.00001). Cp was detected in lymphoma tissue in 15 (75%) patients. Cp DNA was detected in conjunctival swabs and/or PBMC from 10 (50%) patients and in PBMC from 1 (2%) donor (p = 0.01). Viability and infectivity of Cp, demonstrated by growth in culture, were confirmed in conjunctival swabs and/or PBMC from 5 (25%) patients, but not in donors (p = 0.002). This prospective study demonstrates, for the first time, that Cp present in the conjunctiva and PBMC of OAML patients is capable to grow and be isolated in cell cultures. Cp infection is common in OAML patients and exceptional in blood donors. Epidemiological data of OAML patients (prolonged contact with household animals and chronic conjunctivitis) are consistent with Cp exposure risk. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={In this study, the isolation of 52 mycobactin-independent fast growing mycobacteria from 631 bulk milk samples (8.2%), is reported. These strains, isolated during a bulk milk survey for Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map), strongly affected Map detection both by PCR and by culture, as they gave a positive IS900 PCR signal and resulted to totally inhibit the growth of Map when spotted on HEYM slants already inoculated with 200 μl of 10-fold dilutions containing from 5 × 10 to 5 × 103 Map cells/ml. 16S rRNA gene sequencing, using the MicroSeq 500 16S rDNA Bacterial Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems), was performed on a subset of six strains, identifying Mycobacterium porcinum with 100% homology in all six cases. The 52 strains were characterized by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the hsp65 gene, which confirmed the identification of M. porcinum for all the isolates. Using specific primers designed on the Map-IS900 sequence and on the M. porcinum sequence determined in this study, a 1385 bp sequence from the M. porcinum genome was characterized. This IS900-like sequence showed 82% homology with Map IS900. From our findings the following results emerged: (a) any culture showing one or more M. porcinum colonies represents a potential "false negative" result and should therefore be considered as contaminated; (b) IS900-like elements could be more widespread than was previously thought; (c) IS900 PCR positive results should be interpreted cautiously, as confirmed by the evidence that the primer pair used in this study resulted not to be specific. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The sensitivity and specificity of six ELISA tests for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) to discriminate between sero-converted (for non-structural FMD virus proteins) and non-sero-converted cattle were evaluated for vaccinated and unvaccinated cattle. Since none of the tests could be considered as a proper reference test and for about half of the tested sera the true status (sero-converted or not for non-structural proteins, i.e. presence of antibodies) of the animals was unknown, a Bayesian analysis employing a latent class model was used that did not rely on the use of a reference test or gold standard. Prior information about prevalence for subsets of the data and specificity of the tests was incorporated into the analysis. The specificity of the six tests for vaccinated and non-vaccinated cattle ranged from 96 to 99%. For vaccinated cattle, one test stood out with an estimated sensitivity of 94% (95% CI from 89.8 to 98.1%). Second best for vaccinated cattle were two tests with estimated sensitivities of 85% (95% CI from 78.9 to 89.7%) and 92% (95% CI from 86.2 to 95.6%). For non-vaccinated cattle, the sensitivities of these three tests were around 97%. The remaining three tests showed lower estimated sensitivity for vaccinated cattle, ranging from 57 to 79%. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Nine viral diseases included in the World Organization for Animal Health list of notifiable diseases (former list A) were chosen for their contagiousness and high capacity of spreading to improve their diagnosis using new and emerging technologies. All the selected diseases - foot-and-mouth disease, swine vesicular disease, vesicular stomatitis, classical swine fever, African swine fever, blue-tongue, African horse sickness, Newcastle disease and highly pathogenic avian influenza - are considered as transboundary diseases, which detection causes the prohibition of livestock exportation, and, thus, it leads to high economical losses. The applied diagnostic techniques can fall into two categories: (i) nucleic-acid detection, including padlock probes, real-time PCR with TaqMan, minor groove binding probes and fluorescence energy transfer reaction probes, isothermal amplification like the Cleavase/Invader assay or the loop-mediated amplification technology and the development of rapid kits for 'mobile' PCR and (ii) antigen-antibody detection systems like simplified and more sensitive ELISA tests. Besides, internal controls have been improved for nucleic acid-detecting methods by using an RNA plant virus - Cowpea Mosaic Virus - to ensure the stability of the RNA used as a positive control in diagnostic real-time RT-PCR assays. The development of these diagnosis techniques has required the joint efforts of a European consortium in which nine diagnostic laboratories and an SME who have collaborated since 2004 within the European Union-funded Lab-on-site project. The results obtained are shown in this paper.},

abstract={The widespread perception of the effectiveness of applying tests based on the detection of antibodies against foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) viral non-capsid proteins (NCPs) to assess virus circulation irrespective of vaccination triggered the demand for international standards to evaluate the comparative performance of the upcoming assays against the OIE Index test developed at the Pan American Foot-and-Mouth Disease Center, PAHO/WHO. To this end, a panel was developed composed of 34 cattle sera from animals with an unambiguous exposed/infected status, covering serotypes O, A and C, obtained either under experimental conditions or from the field in regions with different epidemiological situations. Reference values in the Index test and their reproducibility in other laboratories, data on stability as well as results in four other commercial kits and one in house test were obtained. The characteristics of the panel which comprise adequate preparation following international guidelines, a broad range of antibody reactivity, proper stability and the ability to assess comparative diagnostic sensitivity, make it suitable as a reference standard to evaluate if tests equivalent to the OIE Index method are used in support of FMD control programs and by trading partners, and also whether they maintain their standards of diagnostic performance. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Determination of the rotavirus G and P types was carried out using nested RT-PCR. G6 was the most prevalent genotype, accounting for 78.5% of samples, G10 accounted for 9.9% of samples and viruses of G8 type were found in 4.7% of samples. In 3% of samples, viruses were not classified due to concomitant infection with more G type strains, whereas viruses in 3.9% of samples could not be characterized with any of the G-specific primers used in this study. Most common P types were P[11] and P[5], accounting for 65.1% and 25%, respectively. In 2.6% of cases, samples reacted with multiple P-specific primers; no P[1] serotype was identified.

abstract={A fast, simple and very selective liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method for the detection of isopropylthioxanthone (ITX) in dairy products has been developed and validated. After addition of an ITX-d3 as internal standard and a simple extraction from the sample with acetonitrile, the extract was centrifuged and directly injected into the LC-MS system. Chromatographic separation was achieved by means of a Gemini C18 column (100 mm × 2.0 mm i.d. 5 μm) using a gradient of aqueous 20 mM ammonium formiate at pH 4.5 and methanol as the mobile phase, at a flow rate of 0.25 mL min-1. The method was validated according to the guidelines laid down by the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC using the parent ion [M+H]+ (m/z 255) as quantification ion, and the fragment ion (m/z 213) obtained by in-source collision-induced dissociation (IS-CID) as confirmation ion. Absolute and relative recoveries rates were verified at 5, 10, 15 μg kg-1 in yoghurt samples and at 5 μg kg-1 in milk and pudding: mean absolute recoveries were 77% in yoghurt, 50% in pudding and 67% in milk; relative recoveries (after internal standard correction) were always &gt;97% in each matrix. The detection limit (CCα) and the detection capability (CCβ) of method were 6.2 and 7.2 μg kg-1, respectively. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Metal traces from atmospheric deposition can be evaluated by standard biomonitors such as lichens. Lichens can be analyzed by several techniques in order to quantify metals. Micro X-Ray Fluorescence (μXRF) is used for the lichen analysis. μXRF technique has various advantages with respect of other methods: multi-elemental analysis, fast elemental determination and no contamination effect. Furthermore, μXRF analysis can be performed in-situ, thus allowing to monitor efficiently industrial locations. An industrial district in the Brescia area was monitored by analysing lichens as bio-accumulator. To validate and quantify the μXRF results, Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) was employed. The morphology of the pollutants particles was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The present study investigated the occurrence of anaerobic intestinal spirochaetes of the genus Brachyspira in laying hen flocks in Treviso province, north-eastern Italy, with respect to prevalence, spirochaete species present, disease associations and risk factors for colonization. A total of 450 faecal samples from 45 sheds on 29 laying hen farms were cultured for intestinal spirochaetes. Nineteen sheds on 12 farms contained chickens with symptoms consistent with avian intestinal spirochaetosis, including reduced egg production, wet litter and/or pasty vents. Spirochaetes were isolated from 157 (34.8%) samples from 21 (72.4%) farms, and from 32 (71.1%) sheds. From these positive samples, 189 spirochaetal isolates were speciated using three polymerase chain reaction assays and a restriction fragment polymorphism analysis of 16S rDNA polymerase chain reaction products. Overall, 52 (27.5%) isolates were identified as pathogenic Brachyspira intermedia, 26 (13.8%) as pathogenic Brachyspira pilosicoli, 93 (49.7%) as non-pathogenic (Brachyspira innocens/Brachyspira murdochii), and 18 (9.6%) were unidentified. Faeces from 14 sheds (31%) on 10 farms (34.5%) contained B. intermedia and/or B. pilosicoli, and disease consistent with avian intestinal spirochaetosis was observed in nine of these sheds on seven farms. There was a significant association (P=0.042) between the presence of spirochaetes and using deep pits rather than conveyor belts for manure disposal. Sheds housing chickens >40 weeks of age were significantly more likely to contain spirochaetes (P=0.048) and pathogenic species (P=007) than sheds housing younger chickens. A significant association (P=0.02) was found between infection with pathogenic spirochaetes and reduced egg production. © 2008 Houghton Trust Ltd.},

abstract={Six tests for detection of antibodies against the non-structural proteins of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) were compared at an international workshop in Brescia, Italy in 2004 on the basis of dichotomous test results. However, as results from all of these assays were also available on a continuous scale, validation was extended by calculating and subsequently analysing the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves and likelihood ratios (LR) for each test method. For the purposes of these analyses, test results for a total of 1337 sera were selected from the Brescia workshop dataset, 237 sera that had been obtained from cattle exposed to FMDV and 1100 sera obtained from cattle that were not exposed to the virus; sera from "exposed" cattle were considered to be "true positives" and sera from "non-exposed" cattle were considered to be "true negatives". Analysis of ROC curves showed that at specificities of both 99 and 99.5%, the IZS-Brescia and the Ceditest ELISA had significantly better detection rates in exposed cattle than the other ELISAs. The ROC analysis confirms the previous finding that the IZS-Brescia and the Ceditest ELISAs have both better detection rates in exposed cattle combined with a high specificity. The analysis of likelihood ratios provides information that may be very useful in the interpretation of test results, and a working example is presented to show how these likelihood ratios might be used in an objective approach to deciding the true infection status of surveyed populations. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The intracellular distribution of swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV) proteins and the induced reorganization of endomembranes in IBRS-2 cells were analyzed. Fluorescence to new SVDV capsids appeared first upon infection, concentrated in perinuclear circular structures and colocalized to dsRNA. As in foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV)-infected cells, a vesicular pattern was predominantly found in later stages of SVDV capsid morphogenesis that colocalized with those of non-structural proteins 2C, 2BC and 3A. These results suggest that assembly of capsid proteins is associated to the replication complex. Confocal microscopy showed a decreased fluorescence to ER markers (calreticulin and protein disulfide isomerase), and disorganization of cis-Golgi gp74 and trans-Golgi caveolin-1 markers in SVDV- and FMDV-, but not in vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-infected cells. Electron microscopy of SVDV-infected cells at an early stage of infection revealed fragmented ER cisternae with expanded lumen and accumulation of large Golgi vesicles, suggesting alterations of vesicle traffic through Golgi compartments. At this early stage, FMDV induced different patterns of ER fragmentation and Golgi alterations. At later stages of SVDV cytopathology, cells showed a completely vacuolated cytoplasm containing vesicles of different sizes. Cell treatment with brefeldin A, which disrupts the Golgi complex, reduced SVDV (∼ 5 log) and VSV (∼ 4 log) titers, but did not affect FMDV growth. Thus, three viruses, which share target tissues and clinical signs in natural hosts, induce different intracellular effects in cultured cells. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A longitudinal study of Salmonella enterica infection was carried out in five Italian farrow-to-finish swine herds previously known to be infected by Salmonella. Five litters were randomly selected from each herd and in each litter six piglets were randomly selected and individually identified. Thus, the study included 30 pigs from each farm. At weaning, individual blood samples were collected for serological examination from all selected piglets and on the same day from all sows in the farrowing unit. Piglets were bled again at approximately 60, 90, 150, 210 and 270 days of life whereas the last blood sample was collected at slaughtering. In one of the herds, in which the duration of productive cycle was about 12 months, the last blood samples were collected at 350 days of life. With the same time scheduling, five pen pooled faecal samples were collected from each herd for bacteriological examination. At slaughtering, mesenteric lymph nodes were collected from each ear-tagged pig. Sero-prevalence (cut off S/P ratio 0.25) in sows varied from 93.8% to 100%. In four herds, sero-prevalence in piglets showed a similar profile with complete decline of maternal antibodies at day 60 and clear sero-conversion between day 90 and day 150. In one herd, sero-conversion was observed earlier and 56% of piglets were positive at day 90. The peak of sero-prevalence was observed between day 210 and day 270. Sero-prevalence at slaughtering varied from 66% to 100%. Salmonella was isolated from faecal samples in four of five herds. No Salmonella was isolated from mesenteric lymph nodes at slaughter in two of the herds. Culture prevalence from mesenteric lymph nodes in the other three herds ranged from 3.3% to 30%. This longitudinal study provides original information about epidemiological dynamics of Salmonella enterica infection in Italian swine herds in consideration of the unique extended fattening period typical of the Italian production. © 2008 The Authors.},

abstract={The disease phenotype of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and the molecular/ biological properties of its prion strain, including the host range and the characteristics of BSE-related disorders, have been extensively studied since its discovery in 1986. In recent years, systematic testing of the brains of cattle coming to slaughter resulted in the identification of at least two atypical forms of BSE. These emerging disorders are characterized by novel conformers of the bovine pathological prion protein (PrPTSE), named high-type (BSE-H) and low-type (BSE-L). We recently reported two Italian atypical cases with a PrPTSE type identical to BSE-L, pathologically characterized by PrP amyloid plaques and known as bovine amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy (BASE). Several lines of evidence suggest that BASE is highly virulent and easily transmissible to a wide host range. Experimental transmission to transgenic mice overexpressing bovine PrP (Tgbov XV) suggested that BASE is caused by a prion strain distinct from the BSE isolate. In the present study, we experimentally infected Friesian and Alpine brown cattle with Italian BSE and BASE isolates via the intracerebral route. BASE-infected cattle developed amyotrophic changes accompanied by mental dullness. The molecular and neuropathological profiles, including PrP deposition pattern, closely matched those observed in the original cases. This study provides clear evidence of BASE as a distinct prion isolate and discloses a novel disease phenotype in cattle. © 2008 Lombardi et al.},

abstract={Aluminium (Al) is a ubiquitous metal that is potentially toxic to the brain. Its effects on other fundamental organs are not completely understood. This morphological in vivo study sought to compare sublethal hepatotoxic changes and Al deposition in adult mice that orally ingested Al sulphate daily for 10 months, in age matched control mice that drank tap water and in senescent mice (24 months old). Livers were examined for collagen deposition using Sirius red and Masson, for iron accumulation using Perls' stain. Light, electron microscopy and morphometry were used to assess fibrosis and vascular changes. Scanning transmission electron microscopy and EDX microanalysis were used to detect in situ elemental Al. Iron deposition, transferrin receptor expression were significantly altered following Al exposure and in the aged liver but were unaffected in age matched control mice. In Al treated mice as in senescent mice, endothelial thickness was increased and porosity was decreased like perisinusoidal actin. Furthermore, Al stimulated the deposition of collagen and laminin, mainly in acinar zones 1 and 3. Pseudocapillarization and periportal laminin in senescent mice were similar to Al treated adult liver. In conclusion, prolonged Al sulphate intake accelerates features of senescence in the adult mice liver. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The hard tick Ixodes ricinus (Ixodidae) is the sole animal thus far shown to harbour an intra-mitochondrial bacterium, which has recently been named Midichloria mitochondrii. The objectives of this work were (i) to screen ixodid ticks for Midichloria-related bacteria and (ii) to determine whether these bacteria exploit the intra-mitochondrial niche in other tick species. Our main goal was to discover further models of this peculiar form of symbiosis. We have thus performed a PCR screening for Midichloria-related bacteria in samples of ixodid ticks collected in Italy, North America and Iceland. A total of 7 newly examined species from 5 genera were found positive for bacteria closely related to M. mitochondrii. Samples of the tick species Rhipicephalus bursa, found positive in the PCR screening, were analysed with transmission electron microscopy, which revealed the presence of bacteria both in the cytoplasm and in the mitochondria of the oocytes. There is thus evidence that bacteria invade mitochondria in at least 2 tick species. Phylogenetic analysis on the bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences generated from positive specimens revealed that the bacteria form a monophyletic group within the order Rickettsiales. The phylogeny of Midichloria symbionts and related bacteria does not appear completely congruent with the phylogeny of the hosts. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract={There was an epidemic of diarrhoea affecting pigs of all ages in Italy between May 2005 and June 2006. In 63 herds the cause was confirmed as porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus by electron microscopy, immunoelectron microscopy, PCR and serology. Watery diarrhoea without mucus and blood was usually associated with a reduction of feed consumption. In farrowing-to-weaning herds, diarrhoea affected the sows and suckling piglets, and the mortality in newborn piglets was up to 34 per cent. In growers and fatteners the morbidity ranged from 20 to 80 per cent, but there was either no mortality or it was very low. Depending on the size of the herd and the type of operation, the clinical disease lasted for weeks or months.},

Twenty selected genetic loci were initially tested on 9 avian reference strains including representatives of all major serotypes (A to F). Thereafter, 8 loci were retained for a more complete study performed on over 150 C. psittaci isolates from different bird species and geographical origins. Comparative analysis of the MLVA results and those obtained from currently available methods including serotyping and/or ompA sequencing indicate that the MLVA system provides an additional level of discrimination, with 20 distinct patterns identified to date. The newly developed MLVA system therefore provides a highly sensitive, high resolution test for the differentiation of C. psittaci isolates from different origins that is suitable for molecular epidemiological studies. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The aim of this trial was to evaluate the dynamic of the pathogen population, such as Salmonella typhimurium, I. monocytogenes and E. coli O1 57: H7, during the seasoning of traditional Valtellina Bresaola PGI. Different Bresaola were artificially contaminated on their surface after brine-salting with a 107 cfu/cm2 concentration of pathogens, and then socked and seasoned. Samples were taken from the surface of each bresaola during the seasoning time of 5 weeks, and analysed to value the populations of pathogens. Salmonella decreased with a biphasic trend characterized by a first phase in which the decimal decreasing time (D) was 8 hours and 16 minutes, and a second phase in which D became 20 days and 11 hours. However, during the usual seasoning period, the decrease of Salmonella was equal to 5 logarithms. E. coli O157:H7 decreased with a linear trend in which D was 8 days and 20 hours, and during the usual seasoning period, the decrease of the pathogen was equal to 4 logarithms. The population of L. monocytogenes decreased with a linear trend in which D was 30 days and 17 hours, and so during the usual seasoning period the decrease of the pathogen was less than 2 logarithms.},

abstract={A severe outbreak of enteric and respiratory disease associated with bovine coronavirus (BCoV) infection is described. The outbreak occurred in a dairy herd of southern Italy in the first decade of September 2006, when summer temperatures were still recorded, affecting calves, heifers and adult cows, with a marked decrease in milk production. By virus isolation and RT-PCR targeting the S gene, BCoV was identified as the etiological agent of the outbreak, whereas bacteriological, parasitological and toxicological investigations failed to detect other causes of disease. BCoV strains with 99-100% nucleotide identity in the S gene were isolated from nasal, ocular and rectal swabs, thus proving the absence of separate clusters of virus on the basis of tissue tropism. Sequence analysis of the haemagglutination-esterase and spike proteins of the strain detected in one rectal sample (339/06) showed a high genetic relatedness with recent BCoV isolates (98-99% amino acid identity), with several unique amino acid substitutions in the S protein. The BCoV outbreak described in this paper presents interesting aspects: (i) the occurrence of a severe form of disease in the warmer season; (ii) the simultaneous presence of respiratory and enteric disease; (iii) the involvement of young as well as adult cattle. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={During local respiratory disease outbreaks, occurring in 2003 and 2004 in horse training stables within race-tracks in Rome, and on a stud horse farm in Bari in 2005, four strains of equine influenza (EI) virus were isolated. All outbreaks occurred in flu-vaccinated horses. Here, we are reporting the results of the genetic characterization of these isolates, together with that of another EI virus strain isolated in 1999 from a dead foal presenting pulmonary lesions. Alignment and phylogenetic analyses were carried out using the haemagglutinin amino acid sequences. The Rome and Bari isolates were identified as members of the American lineage, closely related to other recent strains isolated in America as well as in Europe, including the latest recommended American lineage vaccine prototype A/eq/SouthAfrica/4/2003. In contrast, the Italian 1999 isolate was clustered within the European lineage. In Italy, the most recent outbreaks of EI have been caused by the currently circulating American-like strains, even in vaccinated populations, confirming that vaccines should contain an updated representative strain of this lineage. Presently, companies are still in the process of registering updated vaccines but no product is yet available on the market. © 2007.},

In this study the cytotoxicity against cancer cells of the model compound cyclopent-2-en-1-one (2CP) was investigated. Being a highly water soluble small molecule, 2CP could be an ideal candidate to overcome pharmacological issues related to drug delivery and penetration. Its cytotoxic activity was tested on various melanoma and lung cancer cells. Interestingly, 2CP was both cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic, more pronounced on melanoma cells, at concentrations in the sub-micromolar range. On melanoma cells its mechanism of action was mediated by the mitochondria and the activation of caspase 3.},

abstract={In this work four species-specific primers and probes were designed and evaluated for the detection and quantification of bovine, ovine, swine and chicken mitochondrial DNA in feeds. PCR primers were optimized using conventional and Real Time PCR, to detect short species-specific sequences amplifiable from heat treated material. Both methods confirmed the high specificity of the primers designed. Real time quantitative PCR assay allowed the detection of as few as 0.01 ng and 0.05 ng of ovine and bovine genomic DNA, respectively. The detection limit for swine and chicken genomic DNA was 0.5 ng. Sensitivity levels observed in DNA extracted from meat samples processed according to EU legislation were different compared to those in genomic DNAs previously described. They resulted in swine 5 fg of MBM DNA, in chicken 25 ng, in ovine and bovine 50 ng. We confirmed the efficiency and specificity of primers in RT-PCR to detect 0.5% of bovine, ovine, swine and chicken MBM in contaminated feedstuffs. Industrial relevance: The variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease is a rare and fatal human neurodegenerative condition clearly linked with the bovine spongiform encephalopathies (BSE) of cattle. The ban of using animal derived protein in animal feeds has efficiently controlled the development of the BSE epidemic. The work presented by Frezza and collaborators is an application of the real time polymerase chain reaction (a standard procedure used in molecular biology also known as RT-PCR) to identify specific DNA of four animal species (bovine, ovine, swine and chicken). This method is applied to the analysis of feeds to detect and eventually estimate the amount of animal derived proteins. The difficult aim to detect DNA derived from heat-treated material was successfully reached using as target short mitochondrial DNA sequences. The method presented could have important application not only in the control of feed production but also in many fields of the food industry as quality and process control. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease (RHD) is a severe acute viral disease specifically affecting the European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus. As the European rabbit is the predominant species of domestic rabbit throughout the world, RHD contributes towards significant losses to rabbit farming industries and endangers wild populations of rabbits in Europe and other predatory animals in Europe that depend upon rabbits as a food source. Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease virus (RHDV) - a Lagovirus belonging to the family Caliciviridae is the etiological agent of RHD. Typically, RHD presents with sudden death in 70% to 95% of infected animals. There have been four separate incursions of RHDV in the USA, the most recent of which occurred in the state of Indiana in June of 2005. Animal inoculation studies confirmed the pathogenicity of the Indiana 2005 isolate, which caused acute death and pathological changes characterized by acute diffuse severe liver necrosis and pulmonary hemorrhages. Complete viral genome sequences of all USA outbreak isolates were determined and comparative genomics revealed that each outbreak was the result of a separate introduction of virus rather than from a single virus lineage. All of the USA isolates clustered with RHDV genomes from China, and phylogenetic analysis of the major capsid protein (VP60) revealed that they were related to a pandemic antigenic variant strain known as RHDVa. Rapid spread of the RHDVa pandemic suggests a selective advantage for this new subtype. Given its rapid spread, pathogenic nature, and potential to further evolve, possibly broadening its host range to include other genera native to the Americas, RHDVa should be regarded as a threat. © 2007 McIntosh et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) increases in the blood of cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a lethal disease caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV). However, the diagnostic potential of AGP might be limited because AGP also increases in pathophysiological conditions other than FIP. In this retrospective study, the diagnostic potential of serum AGP concentration was evaluated on the basis of the pretest probability of disease, according to the Bayesian approach. Serum AGP levels from cats with FIP (group 1; n = 58) and without FIP (group 2; n = 104) were evaluated. Non-FIP cats were further subgrouped as follows: 2a) inflammation (n = 26), 2b) asymptomatic FCoV infection (n = 49), 2c) injection-site sarcoma (n = 19), 2d) postvaccination (n = 7), and 2e) specific pathogen free (n = 3). Standard descriptive analyses by group and empirical receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve estimation were performed. Ordinary logistic regression analysis was performed to derive an estimate of the continuous likelihood ratio to produce the posttest probability of disease for any combination of pretest probability and serum AGP value. The comparison of serum AGP levels in the different groups and the analysis of the ROC curve confirmed that serum AGP is a powerful discriminating marker for FIP. The Bayesian approach demonstrated that when the pretest probability of FIP is high, based on history and clinical signs (groups 1 or 2a), moderate serum AGP levels (1.5-2 mg/ml) can discriminate cats with FIP from others, while only high serum AGP levels (>3 mg/ml) can support a diagnosis of FIP in cats with a low pretest probability of disease (groups 2b to 2e). © 2007 American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians.},

abstract={Swine vesicular disease (SVD) was first observed in Italy in 1966, and was initially diagnosed as foot and mouth disease (FMD). The causative agent of SVD was classified as an Enterovirus within the family Picornaviridae. It was included in the list of diseases notifiable to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) because of the similarity of its lesions to those produced by FMD; however SVD is often mild in nature and may infect pigs subclinically. During the last decade SVD has been persistently reported in Italy, and surveillance and eradication activities are in place. The central and northern parts of Italy have been designated SVD free since 1997, while the southern regions have not achieved disease-free status. However, occasional outbreaks of SVD have occurred in central and northern Italy and have been eradicated using rigorous control measures. Most recent SVD outbreaks in Italy have been subclinical; SVD can rarely be diagnosed now on the basis of clinical signs and it is necessary to use laboratory diagnosis. This paper examines the epidemiology of SVD in Italy, and considers the measures adopted in Europe for SVD control on the basis of current knowledge of the disease.},

abstract={During the period 2002-2005, 109 infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) field strains were isolated from bird flocks located in various parts of Italy. Out of these strains, 91 were isolated from broilers, 12 from pullets, and six from backyard flocks. Forty-two IBDV strains were further investigated and characterized on the basis of the geographical origin, source, and clinical signs. Antigenic and genetic characterizations were carried out using a monoclonal antibody (MAb)-based antigen-capture (AC) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or a virus neutralization assay and a reverse transcription, amplification, and direct sequencing of a genome fragment encoding the VP2 variable domain. The viruses were compared with reference IBDV strains, F52/70 (classical, 1970), 89163 (typical very virulent [vv]IBDV, 1989), 91168 (antigenically modified vvIBDV, 1991) and 94432 (antigenically modified vvIBDV, 1994) among others. All 42 strains were genetically characterized, and the comparison of their nucleotide sequences revealed the presence of six clusters having 100% identity, named group 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Twelve strains, representative of each molecular group and/or with interesting amino acid sequence, were also antigenically characterized. The antigenic characterization showed six strains - 151573, 157185 (group1), 192294 (group 2), 77882 (group 3), 217 (group 4), and 192304 - with the profile typical of vvIBDV (lack of binding of MAbs 3 and 4). Two strains, 77165 and 204875 (group 6), were also related to vvIBDV but did not react with MAb 5. Three isolates exhibited a profile of cell culture-adapted viruses and classical strains but with some differences: strain 157776 reacted with all MAbs; strain 168026 with all MAbs except MAb 4, which weakly neutralized it; and strain 72293 with all MAbs except MAb 9, which is rather unusual. The last strain, 213622, showed a very uncommon antigenic profile with missing or reduced binding of MAbs 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Genetic characterization revealed 37 strains identified as vvIBDV viruses divided in 26 isolates (including groups 1, 2, 3, and 4) with the four amino acids residues typical of vvIBDV (222A, 256I, 294I, 299S) and 11 isolates (including groups 5, 6, and 213622) with some other amino acid exchanges. Four isolates (72293, 168026, 196783, and 222220) presented an amino acid sequence closely related to attenuated classical viruses whereas the last isolate (157776) exhibited a rather different sequence with some mutations typical of vvIBDV and others for cell culture-adapted viruses. Results of the antigenic and genetic characterization revealed that the majority of viruses (n = 37) were related to vvIBDV strains but, among these, 11 strains presented antigenically and genetically modified characteristics and originated, in major part, from the area where viruses have been circulating for a long time. The remaining viruses (n = 5) were related but not identical to attenuated classical viruses and came from areas where vaccination with intermediate strains is applied.},

abstract={Noroviruses are increasingly important as aetiological agents of gastrointestinal infections. They belong to the Caliciviridae family, and are composed by small round structured viruses with a plussense, single-stranded RNA genome. Due to their high lev el of genetic diversity, they are divided into five genogroups (GG): genogroups I, II, and IV are pathogen for humans, while genogroups III and V are infective for cows and mice, respectively. Consumption of seafood and ready-to-eat vegetables is the most common way for human infections, and the appearance of outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis represents an important health problem which is also responsible of economic losses. This paper describes the results of six years of monitoring using the RT-Booster-PCR as method of investigation.

abstract={The diagnostic performance of six foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) assays for detection of antibodies to the non-structural proteins (NSP) of the FMD virus (FMDV) was estimated using a Bayesian analysis on field sera from cattle of unknown infection status originating from post-FMDV outbreak situations in Israel and Zimbabwe. Estimations of the disease prevalence in both populations were also obtained. The diagnostic sensitivity estimates did not differ between both field studies, although overall Bayesian estimates were markedly higher than those previously reported based on sera from comparable experimentally infected (vaccinated) cattle populations. All NSP-based assays demonstrated a lower diagnostic specificity when applied to the Zimbabwean sera compared to both published specificities and similar Bayesian specificity estimates derived for the Israeli dataset.

abstract={The composition of the abomasal helminth fauna and parasite diversity were studied in 298 red deer collected during 1997-2000 from three different sectors (Bolzano, Trento and Sondrio provinces) of the Stelvio National Park, one of the main protected areas of north-eastern Italy. The association between parasite burdens and geographical areas of the hosts was assessed using the negative binomial regression. A variety of abomasal helminths, both host specific and generalist, was found in all sectors. The most commonly observed parasites were the Spiculopteragia spiculoptera morph spiculoptera and Ostertagia leptospicularis morph leptospicularis, with prevalences of 79.5% and 40.9%, respectively. The minor morphs S. spiculoptera morph mathevossiani (prevalence 31.9%) and O. leptospicularis morph kolchida (18.8%) occurred at lower prevalences. Teladorsagia circumcincta morph circumcincta, Marshallagia marshalli morph marshalli and Haemonchus contortus were rarer, at prevalences of 1, 1.3 and 1.3%, respectively. Deviance analysis of the negative binomial regression model shows that the geographical area is significantly related to parasite burdens (P = 0.001). Prevalences of hosts with parasites were greater in the Sondrio (odds ratio = 1.31; 95% confidence interval: 0.16-10.85) and smaller in the Trento (odds ratio = 0.62; 95% confidence interval: 0.20-1.96) sectors with respect to Bolzano, but these differences were not statistically significant. Possible cross-infections by more generalist parasites between wild and domestic animals were also suggested, as deer and domestic ruminants (Bovinae, Caprinae and Ovinae) used the same feeding areas of the park sectors. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract={Following the avian influenza epidemics that occurred in Italy between 1997 and 2003, the Italian Ministry of Health in collaboration with veterinary authorities promoted, funded and implemented a national surveillance programme. The main objectives of the surveillance effort were to identify avian influenza viruses circulating in wild birds and to investigate the role of backyard poultry flocks in the dynamics of infection in a densely populated poultry area. Over 2 years (2004 to 2006), 164 backyard flocks and 4083 wild birds (mainly migratory Anseriformes and Charadriiformes) were sampled in three regions in the North of Italy. Samples collected were screened by means of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and the positive samples were processed for attempted virus isolation in embryonated fowl's specific pathogen free eggs. At the end of the study period, 27 low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses had been isolated from backyard flocks and 49 strains obtained from wild birds. Of these, 26 belonged to the H5 or H7 subtype and were closely related to contemporary low-pathogenic strains of Eurasian lineage. The findings confirm that backyard free-range farming is at high risk for avian influenza virus introduction, and confirm the role of wild waterfowl in the introduction and perpetuation of low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses during the winter season in Southern Europe. © 2007 Houghton Trust Ltd.},

abstract={A total of ten infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) isolates collected from commercial chickens in Italy in 1999 were characterized by RT-PCR and sequencing of the S1 and N genes. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial S1 gene sequences showed that five field viruses clustered together with 793/B-type strains, having 91.3-98.5% nucleotide identity within the group, and one isolate had very close sequence relationship (94.6% identity) with 624/I strain. These two IBV types have been identified in Italy previously. The other three variant isolates formed novel genotype detected recently in many countries of Western Europe. For one of these variant viruses, Italy-02, which afterwards became the prototype strain, the entire S1 gene was sequenced to confirm its originality. In contrast, phylogenetic analysis of more conserved partial N gene sequences, comprising 1-300 nucleotides, revealed different clustering. Thus, three variant IBVs of novel Italy-02 genotype, which had 96.7-99.2% S1 gene nucleotide identity with each other, belonged to three separate subgroups based on N gene sequences. 624/I-type isolate Italy-06 together with Italy-03, which was undetectable using S1 gene primers, shared 97.7% and 99.3% identity, respectively, in N gene region with vaccine strain H120. Only one of the 793/B-type isolates, Italy-10, clustered with the 793/B strain sharing 99.3% partial N gene identity, whereas the other four isolates were genetically distant from them (only 87.7-89.7% identity) and formed separate homogenous subgroup. The results demonstrated that both mutations and recombination events could contribute to the genetic diversity of the Italian isolates. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={The use of adult stem cells in tissue regeneration appears to be a powerful research tool, due to the intrinsic characteristics of these cells, i.e., self-renewal and unlimited capacity for proliferation. In particular, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) obtained from bone marrow or peripheral blood can be easily isolated, cultivated, propagated and can be differentiated into several specialized cell types thanks to their plasticity. Among these cells, MSCs can evolve into cardiac cell lineages. Since heart damage leads to the irreversible loss of cardiac function, cell transplantation could be a potential therapy for heart injury. Our laboratory has focused on the purification and expansion of rat and sheep MSCs, their differentiation into cardiomyocytes and their characterisation. Numerous results indicate that MSCs could be promising for therapy, however we need to better understand the biology of stem cells to improve methods for delivery and/or pharmacological activation. These techniques can indeed track engrafted cells and systems to guarantee their safe use. © Springer 2007.},

At 45 d, early weaning determined a significant reduction of growth (1219 vs 1282; P<0.01), although the solid feed intake resulted significantly higher, from 25 to 34 days of age, in early weaned rabbits (50.0 vs 29.8 g/d; P<0.001). The age at weaning did not modify caecal traits, with the exception of pH value, that was lower in rabbits early moved to the mothers (5.53 vs 5.83; P<0,05). Independently by age of weaning, the administration of diet HF promoted growth performance in rabbits at 45 d (1280 vs 1222; P<0.01). Diet composition did not influence mortality rate at 34 days of age, while early weaning determined values significantly higher than those found in rabbits weaned later. The data of microbial analysis, carried out on 10 animals per diet (at 25 and 34 days of age), showed potential pathogenetic microflora development depended by the age of animal and was not affected by the composition of diets.},

abstract={64 weaned pigs (24d-old), were fed a control diet or a control plus 1% thymol diet, with or without Salmonella typhimurium challenge. Thymol reduced feed intake but did not affect significantly the final body weight after 29d of trial. Salmonella did not affect the performances. Body temperature was lower in the thymol group before, but also 1d after challenge, when Salmonella increased the values more in unsupplemented pigs. Fecal excretion of S. typhimurium in challenged pigs was not changed by the diet. The thymol group had a higher concentration of immunoglobulin (Ig) in serum before the challenge, but after there was an interaction between diet and challenge. The diet and the challenge did not affect saliva parameters, and ATPase gene expression in the fundic gastric mucosa. Thymol increased the number of parietal cells for 100 μm depth of oxintic gland. In conclusion the important supplementation with thymol reduced the intake, but not performance in the medium period. Some factors of the gut barrier were positively influenced. Salmonella challenge did not reduce significantly the performance of the weaned piglet.},

The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize mainly lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from calves, that can be used as feed additive. For this purpose, bacterial strains were recovered from calf faecal samples and characterized using MicroLog™ system, 16s rRNA gene sequencing and Riboprinter™ system. Major representative strains were evaluated for their potential probiotic activity in vitro. Of 145 strains isolated, 3 clonal strains were selected for their potential probiotic activity, namely Lactobacillus animalis DUP5009, Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei DUP13077 and Bacillus coagulans RiboGroup 189-444-S-1. In light of this result these clonal strains can be considered for develop new probiotic products for calves.},

The oral challenge was done on d 5 and pigs were sacrificed on d 7 or d 25. The effect of challenge never interacted significantly with the dietary treatment. Feed intake, growth, body temperature, salivary excretion, and faecal excretion of ST and gastric function were not affected by the nitrate supplementation. With nitrate additions, total IgA in blood serum tended to be higher before and after the challenge (P<0.10). Nitrite in saliva - but not nitrate - increased with the increasing supplementation at d 5, but not at d 19. The nitrate additions did not negatively affect the weaning performance, but also did not contrast the effect of ST infection.},

abstract={Bartonella henselae is a fastidious bacterium associated with infections in humans and cats. The mechanisms involved in the long-term survival of bartonellae despite vigorous host immune responses are poorly understood. Generation of genetic variants is a possible strategy to circumvent the host specific immune responses. The authors have recently demonstrated the coexistence of different genetic variants within the progeny of three primary B. henselae isolates from Berlin by PFGE analysis. Aims of the present study were to determine whether coexistence of different variants is a common feature of B. henselae isolates worldwide and whether the genetic variants originally emerged in vivo. Thirty-four primary isolates from different geographical regions were analysed by subjecting multiple single-colony-derived cultures to PFGE analysis. Up to three genetic variants were detected within 20 (58.8 %) isolates, indicating that most primary isolates display a mosaic-like structure. The close relatedness of the genetic variants within an isolate was confirmed by multi-locus sequence typing. In contrast to the primary isolates, no genetic variants were detected within the progeny of 20 experimental clones generated in vitro from 20 primary isolates, suggesting that the variants were not induced in vitro during the procedure of PFGE analysis. Hence, the genetic variants within a primary isolate most likely originally emerged in vivo. Consideration of the mosaic structure of primary isolates is essential when interpreting typing studies on B. henselae. © 2007 SGM.},

abstract={An enteric syndrome was observed in quail (Coturnix coturnix) semi-intensively reared for restocking in Apulia (southern Italy). The birds showed depression, severe diarrhoea, dehydration and reduced growth. Mortality occurred particularly in young birds. At necropsy the prominent lesion was enteritis. A coronavirus was detected by electron microscopy and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in the faeces and in the intestinal content of the dead quails. The virus could not be cultivated in chicken embryos. By sequence analyses of a fragment (409 nucleotides) of region 1b of the polymerase gene, the quail coronavirus displayed ≤93% nucleotide identity to avian coronaviruses (group 3 coronaviruses) - whereas by analysis of the S1 portion of the spike protein-encoding gene, the quail coronavirus displayed 16% to 18% amino acid identity with infectious bronchitis virus, and 79% to 81% identity with turkey coronavirus. Altogether, the findings suggest the existence of a novel coronavirus genetically related to turkey coronavirus. © 2007 Houghton Trust Ltd.},

abstract={The purpose of this study was to assess the immune response in pigs intradermally vaccinated with a commercially available attenuated porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSV) vaccine (Porcilis ® PRRS) and subsequently exposed to a heterologous (Italian cluster) field strain of virulent PRRSV. A total of 18, 4-week-old pigs seronegative for PRRSV were allocated to 1 of 3 groups (groups A, B, and C). At 5 weeks of age, pigs of groups A (n = 6 pigs) and B (n = 6 pigs) were vaccinated intramuscularly and intradermally, respectively, with Porcilis ® PRRS. The more conventional intramuscular route of vaccination was included for comparative purposes with the intradermal route of vaccination (performed with the I.D.A.L. ® vaccinator). Pigs of group C (n = 6 pigs) were kept as nonvaccinated controls. At post-vaccination (PV) days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35, blood samples were collected for detection of vaccine virus (PCR) and antibodies (ELISA), and for changes in PBMC (flow cytometry). At PV day 35, pigs of all groups were each exposed (challenged) intranasally to a heterologous field strain (78% ORF5 sequence homology between vaccine and field virus) belonging to the Italian cluster of the European genotype of PRRSV. At post-challenge (PC) days 0, 3, 7, 10, 13, and 17, blood samples were collected for detection and quantitation of virus and antibodies, and for changes in PBMC as described above for blood samples collected PV. Throughout the experiment all pigs were observed daily for clinical signs. At PC days 7 and 17, two pigs and four pigs, respectively, of each group were euthanized and examined for macroscopic lesions. Following vaccination some pigs of groups A and B had a detectable viremia that in two pigs (one pig of group A and one pig of group B) lasted until PV day 28. However, all pigs (groups A, B, and C) remained clinically normal. All vaccinated pigs developed a serological response (ELISA) to PRRSV. Presumptive evidence for vaccine-induced protective immunity against the heterologous challenge strain was provided by finding that viremia following challenge was generally less (incidence) and significantly less (titers) in vaccinated pigs than in nonvaccinated pigs. No differences were apparent between pigs vaccinated intramuscularly and those vaccinated intradermally. The absence of virulent-virus-induced clinical signs and macroscopic lesions in nonvaccinated as well as in vaccinated pigs precluded a more definitive evaluation of the magnitude of protective immunity provided by vaccination or by the route of vaccination. Some likely treatment-associated changes in lymphocyte subpopulations were observed among the three treatment groups. These changes and their potential relationship to protective immunity are discussed. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) is a group II coronavirus that was firstly identified in lung samples of dogs with canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) in UK in 2003. We report for the first time the identification of CRCoV in Italy, together with serological evidence that the virus has been circulating in the Italian dog population as from 2005. Serological investigations on 216 dog sera, carried out by an ELISA test using the strictly related bovine coronavirus (BCoV) as antigen, revealed an overall CRCoV seroprevalence of 32.06% in the last 2 years. RT-PCR targeting the S-gene of CRCoV was carried out on 109 lung samples collected from carcasses of dogs submitted for diagnostic investigations. Positive results were obtained from the lungs of a dog of the Apulia region that was co-infected with canine parvovirus type 2. Sequence analysis of the S-gene fragment amplified by RT-PCR (595 bp) showed similarity to group II coronaviruses, with the highest nucleotide identity (98%) to the only CRCoV strain currently available in the GenBank database (strain T101). The results of the present study show that CRCoV is present also in continental Europe, although further studies are required to determine the real pathogenic potential of the virus. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Species identification in meat products, such as salami and tinned meat, is very important to assure product quality and safeguard customers from commercial frauds. Species identification is also strictly linked with food safety; substitutions could damage the consumer's health, causing allergic pathologies of various gravity. Protein analysis loses its strength if the proteins are denaturated, a common situation for food products, which very often undergo treatments harmful for the structure of the proteins. DNA based methods, such as PCR, assure high sensitivity and specificity even if the samples are heavily treated, because the molecule of DNA is more stable and resistant to degradation than proteins. The aim of this work was the development of PCR reactions using specific primers for bovine (Bos taurus), swine (Sus scrofa), chicken (Gallus gallus) and turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), goat (Capra hircus), sheep (Ovis aries), horse (Equus caballus) and rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) DNA to reveal the genomes of these species in meat products.},

Separation of conjugated and unconjugated forms of 17α-boldenone (α-BOLD) and 17β-boldenone (β-BOLD) and presence of related molecules as androsta-1,4-diene-3,17-dione (ADD) appear critical points for the decision of an illegal use. The aim of this study is a new analytical approach of BOLD and ADD confirmation in cattle urine. The separation between conjugated and unconjugated forms of BOLD was obtained by a preliminary urine liquid-liquid extraction step with ethyl acetate. In this step the organic phase extracts only unconjugated BOLD and ADD, while BOLD in conjugated form remain in urine phase. Afterwards the urine phase, contains conjugated BOLD, was subjected to an enzymatic deconjugation. Solid-phase extraction (OASIS-HLB Waters) was used for the purification and concentration of analytes in organic and urine phases and liquid chromatography ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) was applied for the confirmation of BOLD and ADD, using deuterium-labelled 17β-boldenone (BOLD-d3) as internal standard. The method was validated as a quantitative confirmatory method according to the Commission Decision 2002/657/CE. The results obtained demonstrate that the developed method show very high specificity, precision, trueness and ruggedness. Decision limits (CCα) smaller than 0.5 ng mL-1 were obtained for each analyte. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Incidence and circulation of different strains of hepatitis A and Norovirus in shellfish were studied on 235 samples (Tapes philippinarum, Mytilus galloprovincialis, Ostrea spp. and Chlamys spp.) obtained from different sites, representing the shellfish production areas of the northern Adriatic sea. Shellfish were harvested in the period of one year and, after depuration, were examined for bacterial (Escherichia coli and Salmonella) and viral (HAV and NoV) contamination. Viral contamination was present on average in 22% of samples: specifically, 6% of samples tested positive for HAV, 14% for NoV and 2% for both viruses. None of the samples revealed the presence of Salmonella, and in most of them (93%) the number of E. coli was below the European legislation limit of 230 MPN/100 g. T. philippinarum was the species most often contaminated, as well as being the only species in which the legal limit for E. coli was, in some cases, exceeded. Both HAV and NoV contamination were detected throughout the year; NoV detection was slightly more frequent during winter months, but positive samples were also present in summer. The sequencing of the PCR products showed the circulation of only one HAV genotype (IA) and four different NoV genotypes (Hawaii, Melksham, Lordsdale and GGIIb) with a prevalence of the GGIIb genotype in the second period of the monitoring.},

abstract={Viruses belonging to the genus Astrovirus have been increasingly associated with enteritis in mammalian and avian species, including turkeys. More recently, astroviruses have also been detected in diseased guinea fowl. In turkeys, two genetically distinct types of astrovirus have been reported, namely turkey astrovirus 1 and 2 (TAstV1 and TAstV2). The prevalence and the pathogenesis of astrovirus infections in this species is currently unknown, with the exception of data generated in the USA. In the present report, we have demonstrated the co-circulation of distinct genetic lineages of astroviruses infecting turkeys and guinea fowl. The predominant lineage infecting turkeys is genetically related to the American TAstV2, but genetic variability within this lineage was demonstrated. Other isolates appeared to be either TastV1-related or unrelated to any other known isolate. Astroviruses infecting guinea fowl were more closely related to TAstV2, and interspecies transmissions between turkeys and guinea fowl is suggested as a possible mechanism by which these viruses may have evolved, based on the genetic data available. This investigation provides genetic and epidemiological information contributing to a better understanding of enteric viral infections in turkeys and guinea fowl. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Atypical neuropathological and molecular phenotypes of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) have recently been identified in different countries. One of these phenotypes, named bovine "amyloidotic" spongiform encephalopathy (BASE), differs from classical BSE for the occurrence of a distinct type of the disease-associated prion protein (PrP), termed PrP Sc, and the presence of PrP amyloid plaques. Here, we show that the agents responsible for BSE and BASE possess different biological properties upon transmission to transgenic mice expressing bovine PrP and inbred lines of nontransgenic mice. Strikingly, serial passages of the BASE strain to nontransgenic mice induced a neuropathological and molecular disease phenotype indistinguishable from that of BSE-infected mice. The existence of more than one agent associated with prion disease in cattle and the ability of the BASE strain to convert into the BSE strain may have important implications with respect to the origin of BSE and spongiform encephalopathies in other species, including humans. © 2007 Capobianco et al.},

abstract={The aims of this study were the evaluation of a quantitative method for the assessment of pneumonia lesions applied to heavy-weight slaughtered pigs, the identification of risk factors connected with the increase in the prevalence and severity of the lesions and the evaluation of a possible correlation between the presence of pneumonia lesions and the decrease in the carcass quality. The lungs of 10 041 pigs (109 slaughtered batches) coming from 91 farms located in Northern Italy were examined. Lung lesions were scored using the method developed by Madec and Kobisch (Journ. Rech. Porc. Fr., 14, 1982, 405). Before the scoring, anamnestic information regarding the farm of origin of each batch were collected. For 41 batches (3603 pigs), information about carcass quality were also collected. Pneumonia lesions were found in 59.6% of the lungs (range 3-91%), and the average batch score was 2.11 (range 0.03-7.15). We identified as farm risk factors those related to an increase in the severity of the lung lesions, the presence of breeders within the herd, the starting of a growing cycle during the winter season and the lack of vaccination programmes to Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae. Moreover, we also found a statistically significant association between the increase in the mean lung score of the batch and the decrease of the carcass quality. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation 2007 Blackwell Verlag.},

abstract={Verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) has emerged as a foodborne pathogen that can cause severe and potentially fatal illnesses, such as hemorrhagic colitis or the hemolytic uremic syndrome. In this study, 182 cattle at slaughter (119 dairy cows and 63 feedlot cattle) were randomly selected and tested for the presence of VTEC serogroups O26, O103, O111, O145, and O157 in their cecal content and lymphatic tissue (tonsils or mesenteric lymph nodes). A total of 364 samples were evaluated with an immunomagnetic separation technique followed by slide agglutination. Presumptive VTEC O26, O103, O111, O145, and O157 isolates were tested by Vero cell assay for verocytotoxin production and by multiplex PCR assay for the detection of vtx1, vtx2, eae, and E-hlyA genes. VTEC O157 was detected in 6 (3.3%) of 182 animals, and VTEC O26 was detected in 1 (0.5%) of 182 animals. No VTEC O103, VTEC O111, or VTEC O145 isolates were found in cattle feces, but one VTEC O91:H- vtx2+, eae-, E-hlyA' strain nonspecifically cross-reacted with the VTEC O103 type. The prevalence of VTEC O157 in the lymphatic tissue of cattle was 1.1% in both tonsils (1 of 93 samples) and mesenteric lymph nodes (1 of 89 samples). Lymphatic tissue contamination was observed only in VTEC O157 intestinal carriers; two (33.3%) of six fecal carriers were simultaneously VTEC O157 lymphatic carriers. This finding suggests that VTEC O157 contamination of meat does not necessarily come from feces or the environment. No other VTEC serogroups were detected in the lymphatic tissue of slaughtered cattle. Copyright ©, International Association for Food Protection.},

abstract={A total of 39 E. coli strains isolated from cloacal swabs and unhatched eggs of Audouin's gulls (Larus audouinii) living the Salento coast (Italy) were serotyped and molecular characterized for the presence of irp2, fyuA, tsh, papC, fimC, iucD, and eae genes described for Avian Pathogenic E. coli (APEC). Eight different serogroups (O1, 06, 08, 015, 075, 0139, 0146, 0147) were distinguished: we recorded a very high rate of untypeable strains. Genotyping by PCR achieved to detect fimC and irp2, described for APEC strains, as most predominant genes circulating in the gulls population, accounting for 94.87% and 97.43% respectively. Nevertheless, a significant co-existance of virulence genes was demonstrated to belong to E.coli of eggs origin. Particularly, fimC/tsh/iucD pathotype, recognized as most responsible of illness in poultry, emerged in 8.69% of E. coli of eggs origin.},

abstract={Cell membrane ion transporters expression and activity are altered in cancer cells and these phenotypic alterations offer potential targets for cancer therapies. Among the therapeutic agents affecting cell membrane transporters, serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been shown to have anticancer potential. In this work, we have compared two SSRIs, one very specific for serotonin reuptake transporters (paroxetine) and another which also inhibit norepinephrine and dopamine transporters (venlafaxine), for their ability to counteract growth of various murine and human cancer cell lines. We found that paroxetine has cytotoxic activity against tumor cells, both of murine or human origin in the micromolar concentration range, whereas venlafaxine has not. A neurotransmitter receptor mediated mechanism of action appears thus unlikely for SSRIs cytotoxicity on cancer cells. With ranges of SSRIs cytotoxicity on cancer cells defined, limits in their possible applicability in cancer therapy is discussed. © 2006 Old City Publishing, Inc.},

abstract={In doubtful cases, the histopathological diagnosis of lesions induced by Maedi Visna virus (MVV), a chronic multisystemic lentiviral disease of sheep, needs to be confirmed by the demonstration of MVV in the tissues. The influence of fixatives and the duration of fixation on the detection of MVV by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and PCR in paraffin-embedded tissues was assessed in lung samples with lesions in different degree, from five sheep serologically positive. Samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF), Bouin's solution (BS) and a zinc salts-based fixative (ZSF), for different periods of time between 24 h and 30 days. The three fixatives preserved the morphology of the tissues, although in ZSF-fixed samples an increase in the number of desquamated cells was seen in the alveoli. Tissues showed a similar degree of immunolabelling, irrespective of the duration of fixation using ZSF and NBF fixatives. MVV nucleic acids could be detected in samples fixed up to 14 days in NBF and 30 days in ZSF. However, in BS fixed tissues, immunostaining was weak and non-specific signals were observed after 4 days of fixation. Amplification of proviral DNA could not be obtained by PCR in these samples. IHC detected viral antigens in all sheep whereas one sheep with mild lesions was always negative by PCR. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={An intracellular bacterium with the unique ability to enter mitochondria exists in the European vector of Lyme disease, the hard tick Ixodes ricinus. Previous phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences suggested that the bacterium formed a divergent lineage within the Rickettsiales (Alphaproteobacteria). Here, we present additional phylogenetic evidence, based on the gyrB gene sequence, that confirms the phylogenetic position of the bacterium. Based on these data, as well as electron microscopy (EM), in situ hybridization and other observations, we propose the name 'Candidatus Midichloria mitochondrii' for this bacterium. The symbiont appears to be ubiquitous in females of I. ricinus across the tick's distribution, while lower prevalence is observed in males (44%). Based on EM and in situ hybridization studies, the presence of 'Candidatus M. mitochondrii' in females appears to be restricted to ovarian cells. The bacterium was found to be localized both in the cytoplasm and in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria of ovarian cells. 'Candidatus M. mitochondrii' is the first bacterium to be identified that resides within animal mitochondria. © 2006 IUMS.},

abstract={Five European reference laboratories participated in an exercise to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of their routinely employed RT-PCR tests and cell cultures for the detection and isolation of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus. Five identical sets of 20 coded samples were prepared from 10 vesicular epithelia, which were derived from submissions from suspect cases of FMD or swine vesicular disease (SVD). Sixteen samples were derived from six FMD virus positive epithelia representing four different serotypes (two each of types O and A and one each of types Asia 1 and SAT 2), two from samples which had been found to be negative by antigen ELISA and virus isolation (VI) in cell culture and two from SVD virus positive epithelia. Some of the FMD virus positive samples were prepared from 10-fold serial dilutions of three of the initial suspensions. Each laboratory tested the samples by one or more of its available RT-PCR procedures and inoculated cell cultures that it routinely uses for FMD diagnosis in attempts to isolate virus, the specificity of which was confirmed by antigen ELISA. The best of the RT-PCR assays used in each laboratory gave comparable results while the sensitivity of cell cultures was variable from high in one laboratory, moderate in two and low in two others. This prototype panel of samples would appear suitable for external quality assurance of these tests but would benefit from the inclusion of more negative samples and an extension in the serial dilution range of one or more of the FMD positive sample titration series. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={There has been much debate about the use of the so-called "vaccinate-to-live" policy for the control of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Europe, according to which, spread of the FMD virus (FMDV) from future outbreaks could be controlled by a short period of "emergency" vaccination of surrounding herds, reducing the need for large-scale pre-emptive culling of at-risk animals. Since vaccinated animals may become subclinically infected with FMDV following challenge exposure, it is necessary to either remove all vaccinates (vaccinate-to-kill) or to detect and remove vaccinates in which virus is circulating or has established persistent infections (vaccinate-to-live), in order to rapidly regain the most favoured trading status of FMD-free without vaccination. The latter approach can be supported by testing vaccinated animals for the presence of antibodies to certain non-structural proteins (NSP) of FMDV, which are induced by infection with the virus, but not by vaccination with purified FMD vaccines. Using test sensitivity and specificity data established at a recent workshop on NSP assays [Brocchi E, Bergmann I, Dekker A, Paton DJ, Sammin DJ, Greiner M, et al. Comparative performance of six ELISAs for antibodies to the non-structural proteins of foot-and-mouth disease. Vaccine, in press], this paper examines the ways in which serological testing with NSP ELISAs can be used and interpreted and the effect that this will have on the confidence with which freedom from infection can be demonstrated within guidelines specified by the World Animal Health Organisation and the European Commission. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Bimoclomol (BIM), is a stress proteins coinducer, that acts synergistically with a mild stressor to activate cytoprotective stress proteins. BIM has been successfully utilized in animal models for the treatment of various nervous, cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases. Mercuric chloride (HgCl2) induces acute renal failure in rats by a single dosage. The present in vivo study was conducted to assess the efficacy of BIM against acute HgCl2 nephrotoxicity. At different times after BIM and/or HgCl2 exposure we evaluated renal morphology and the localization/abundance of three stress proteins (HSP72, GRP75, HSP60) by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. BIM delivery to rats 6 h before mercury, ameliorated damage to renal ultrastructure, with recovery of tubular and mitochondrial membranes 24 h after mercury treatment. In rats pretreated with BIM prior to HgCl2 exposure, HSP72 was significantly overexpressed in proximal tubules in a time-dependent manner. In contrast, the amounts of GRP75 and HSP60 after BIM pretreatment were comparable to the group treated with mercury alone, but these stress proteins had translocated to the nuclei at 14 and 24 h, respectively. These novel findings suggest that BIM mitigates HgCl2 nephrotoxicity in rats through the early recruitment of stress proteins in midcortical proximal tubules that are the main renal mercury-targets. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract={Stress proteins such as HSP70 members (HSP72 and GRP75) and metallothionein (MT) protect the kidney against oxidative damage and harmful metals, whereas inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) regulates tubular functions. A single dose of mercuric chloride (HgCl2) can cause acute renal failure in rats, its main target being the proximal tubule. Oxidative damage has been proposed as one of its pathogenic mechanisms. In this study we tested whether melatonin (MEL), a powerful antioxidant compound, is effective against HgCl 2 nephrotoxicity. Rats were treated with saline, HgCl2 (3.5 mg/kg), MEL (5 mg/kg), and MEL + HgCl2 and examined after 24 hr for HSP72, GRP75, MT, and iNOS by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Tubular effects of the treatment were then characterized by ultrastructure. In the HgCl2 group, all markers were overexpressed in convoluted proximal tubules and sometimes in distal tubules. In the MEL + HgCl2 group, GRP75 and iNOS decreased in convoluted and straight proximal tubules, whereas HSP72 and MT persisted more than the saline and MEL-only groups. Tubular damage and mitochondrial morphometry were improved by MEL pretreatment. In conclusion, the beneficial effect of MEL against HgCl2 nephrotoxicity was outlined morphologically and by the reduction of the tubular expression of stress proteins and iNOS. These markers could represent sensitive recovery index against mercury damage. © The Histochemical Society, Inc.},

Biotoxicity assays can easily reveal the presence of noxious substances and those based on bioluminescent bacteria (BLB) are particularly simple and rapid. A BLB assay was developed as microplate format by using various strains of Vibrio sp. and was employed to evaluate their response to pure antibiotic solutions and to residues extracted from excreta of antibiotic treated pigs and turkeys. The residues were quantified by HPLC analysis. The BLB assay can be proposed as an easy-to-perform screening tool to assess the presence of residues due to undeclared current, or recently ended, pharmacological treatments, as well as to evaluate their permanence in manure. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={It has been postulated that Doppel (Dpl) and Prion (PrP) proteins have yet undetermined interactions, since Dpl is overexpressed in transgenic PrP-deficient mice. In this study we investigated the expression levels of Dpl and PrP on lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils (PMNs) isolated from bovine blood and incubated (2 and 18 h) with TNFα, IL-1, IL-2, IL-8, C5a, IFNγ, anti-PrP, and anti-Dpl antibodies by flow cytometry. The isolation procedures yielded cell populations with high purity, viability and recovery rates. After 2 h incubation, expression of PrP or Dpl was altered only in PMNs. These cells overexpressed PrP when incubated with TNFα and IFNγ, and both PrP and Dpl when incubated with C5a; incubation with TNFα, IL-8 and IFNγ led to down-regulation of Dpl. Lymphocytes incubated for 18 h with IL-2 and with IFNγ overexpressed Dpl. Incubation with the anti-PrP antibody induced down-regulation of Dpl in PMNs after 2 h and overexpression of Dpl in lymphocytes after 18 h. The differences recorded after 2 h were likely due to redistribution of pre-existing PrP or Dpl molecules, while those seen at 18 h were most probably due to increased protein synthesis. The variations seen using the different activators depend on different receptors and/or signaling pathways. These results demonstrate that is possible to alter the expression of Dpl and PrP in blood cells in vitro by incubation with either cytokines or anti-PrP antibodies. This opens an interesting opportunity to study the biology of these proteins using in vitro systems. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Long-chain n - 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been shown to be essential during peri-natal growth and development of mammals. The study was conducted to determine whether the inclusion of fish oil in dairy goats diet during late gestation and early lactation would increase the proportion of n - 3 PUFAs in colostral and mature milk. From 3 weeks before kidding throughout 42 days of lactation, 14 dairy goats were fed either a control diet or a diet containing 1.1% fish oil (FO). Dietary treatment did not affect main components of colostrum, but lowered percentages of fat and lactose in mature milk. In colostrum, FO supplementation lowered the proportions of C18:0, C18:2, C18:3 and elevated those of C16:1 and very long-chain n - 3 PUFAs, mainly EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA. In mature milk, FO supplementation lowered the proportion of C18:0 and raised C16:1 and n - 3 PUFAs (C18:3, EPA and DHA). Estimated transfer efficiencies for EPA and DHA into mature milk were 14 and 7%, respectively. Results suggest that goat's colostrum and milk can be enriched in n - 3 PUFAs by maternal dietary fish oil supplementation during late gestation and early lactation. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Avian influenza A subtype H5N1 virus with its recombination potential with the human influenza viruses presents a threat of producing a pandemic. The consensus is that the occurrence of such a pandemic is only a matter of time. This is of great concern, since no effective vaccine is available or can be made before the occurrence of the event. We present arguments for the use of cell mediated immunity for the prevention of the infection as well as for the treatment of infected patients. Transfer factor (TF), an immunomodulator of low molecular weight capable of transferring antigen-specific cell mediated immune information to T-lymphocytes, has been used successfully over the past quarter of a century for treating viral, parasitic, and fungal infections, as well as immunodeficiencies, neoplasias, allergies and autoimmune diseases. Moreover, several observations suggest that it can be utilised for prevention, transferring immunity prior to infection. Because it is derived from lymphocytes of immune donors, it has the potential to answer the challenge of unknown or ill-defined pathogens. Indeed, it is possible to obtain an antigen-specific TF preparation to a new pathogen before its identification. Thus, a specific TF to a new influenza virus can be made swiftly and used for prevention as well as for the treatment of infected patients. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Cytology is emerging as a useful diagnostic tool for obtaining a fast and accurate assessment of NS lesions, but little information is available for dogs and cats. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of cytologic evaluation of squash samples from NS lesions in dogs and cats and to consider cytology-based diagnostic guidelines and sources of misdiagnosis. Methods: Cytologic specimens from masses localized in the central and peripheral NS taken during surgery or postmortem examination were classified into 3 groups according to the final histopathologic diagnosis: Group 1 = completely correct diagnosis, when the cytologic diagnosis and final histologic diagnosis were exactly correlated; Group 2 = partial correlation, when the cytologic diagnosis only partially correlated with the final histologic diagnosis, and Group 3 = no correlation, when the cytologic diagnosis was incorrect and there was no correlation with the general histologic type of lesion. The diagnostic accuracy of cytopathology was calculated by considering the histopathologic diagnosis as the "gold standard," and calculating a 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: A total of 42 animals (33 dogs and 9 cats) were included in the study. The cytologic diagnoses were classified in Group 1 for 32 cases (76%; 95% CI 0.63-0.89), in Group 2 for 6 cases (14%; 95% CI 0.04-0.25), and in Group 3 for 4 cases (10%; 95% CI 0.006-0.18). Considering both complete and partial correlation as an adequate result, cytologic diagnosis was satisfactory in 90% of biopsies. Conclusions: Although the current series of cases is relatively small, cytologic evaluation of squash preparations can be considered a fairly accurate and reliable tool in the diagnosis of NS lesions. ©2006 American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology.},

abstract={Background: A review of the literature revealed limited information about the stability of samples for coagulation testing in dogs. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the stability of individual coagulation factors, clotting times, and other parameters of hemostasis in stored canine plasma. Methods: Citrated plasma samples were obtained from 21 dogs. Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen concentration, and factor I, II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII activities were measured on an automated coagulation analyzer with commercially available reagents. Antithrombin (AT) activity and D-dimer concentration were measured on an automated chemistry analyzer using validated kits. Samples were analyzed within 1 hour after collection (initial analysis) and once daily for 2 or 4 consecutive days following storage at room temperature (RT) or 4°C, respectively. Results: Storage time at either temperature did not have any effect on PT, factor II, V, VII, X, or XII activities, D-dimer concentration, or AT activity. In contrast, aPTT was significantly prolonged after 72 and 96 hours at 4°C; fibrinogen concentration was decreased after 48 hours at RT; the activities of factors VIII and IX were decreased after 48, 72, and 96 hours at 4°C; and factor XI activity was decreased after 72 hours at 4°C. Conclusions: Results suggest that storage of canine plasma for 2 days at RT does not have a significant effect on hemostasis test results with the exception of a slight decrease in fibrinogen concentration. In contrast, aPTT and factors VIII, IX, and XI were unstable in refrigerated plasma after 48 or 72 hours of storage. ©2006 American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology.},

abstract={Background: Artifactual changes in blood may occur as a consequence of delayed analysis and may complicate interpretation of CBC data. Objective: The aim of this study was to characterize artifactual changes in canine blood, due to storage, using the ADVIA 120 hematology analyzer. Methods: Blood samples were collected into EDTA from 5 clinically healthy dogs. Within 1 hour after blood sample collection and at 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours after storage of the samples at either 4°C or room temperature (∼24°C), a CBC was done using the ADVIA 120 and multispecies software. A linear mixed model was used to statistically evaluate significant differences in values over time, compared with initial values. Results: The HCT and MCV were increased significantly after 12 hours of collection at both 4°C and 24°C, and continued to increase through 48 hours. The MCHC initially decreased significantly at 12-24 hours and then continued to decrease through 48 hours at both temperatures. Changes in HCT, MCV, and MCHC were greater at 24°C than at 4°C at all time points. A significant increase in MPV and a decrease in mean platelet component concentration were observed at all time points at 24°C. Samples stored at 24°C for 48 hours had significantly higher percentages of normocytic-hypochromic RBCs, and macrocytic-normochromic RBCs, and lower platelet and total WBC counts. Conclusions: Delayed analysis of canine blood samples produces artifactual changes in CBC results, mainly in RBC morphology and platelet parameters, that are readily detected using the ADVIA 120. Refrigeration of specimens, even after 24 hours of storage at room temperature, is recommended to improve the accuracy of CBC results for canine blood samples. ©2006 American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology.},

abstract={Of 771 regularly slaughtered Sardinian breed sheep, 580 (75%) were found infected with Echinococcus granulosus hydatid cysts. Seventy-nine sheep (10.3%) had at least 1 fertile cyst. The prevalence of sheep infected with purulent/caseous cysts, calcified cysts and sterile cysts was 13, 59 and 28%, respectively. The age of sheep was positively associated with the probability of infection that increased 1.15 fold for each further year of age. Fertile cysts were found in the lungs of 46 sheep (6%) and in the liver of 13 sheep (1.7%), and in the lung and the liver of 20 sheep (2.6%). Most fertile cysts were found in the lungs (314) and most sheep were infected with less than 10 cysts. When analyzed by a mixed-effect logistic model, the probability to find fertile cysts in the lungs was three times higher compared to the liver and it increased with the age of the sheep (ρ = 0.70, p < 0.001). Of 4072 collected cysts, 532 were fertile, 178 purulent/caseous, 2339 calcified and 1023 sterile. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Aluminium (Al) is the third most widespread metal in the environment. It is toxic for the brain, bone and haematological system but unfortunately very little data exist for other organs. Stress proteins are induced or enhanced against metal toxicity with an essential role in the recovery of organules and other cellular proteins. This immunohistochemical study was performed to analyze the distribution of three stress proteins (HSP25, HSP72, GRP75) in rat kidney and liver orally exposed to Al sulphate daily for 3 and 6 months. Al-induced alterations were further studied by histopathology (H&E, PAS, Perl's, Masson) and ultrastructural morphometry. In the kidney: HSP25 was enhanced in proximal tubules after 6 months Al-exposure when abnormal brush borders were observed; HSP72 was induced in proximal tubules only after long Al-treatment; GRP75 was raised in midcortical area sometimes within nuclei. Furthermore, lysosomal and lipofuscins densities increased in the juxtamedullary tubules after 3 months Al exposure with respect to controls. In the liver: Perl's-positive deposits and fibrosis became evident after Al treatment. HSP25 was very weak; HSP72 focal in pericentral hepatocytes at 3 months and induced also in Kupffer cells at 6 months; GRP75 diffuse in periportal hepatocytes and non parenchymal cells at 6 months. Prolonged Al exposure stimulated stress proteins strictly organ-dependently in the rat. Their distribution in kidney and liver seems related to cumulative sublethal effects induced by metal and could be a sensitive index of Al susceptibility of these organs.},

abstract={The incidence of dead on arrival (DOA) birds was surveyed over 33 broiler, 11 turkey, and 19 spent hen abattoirs representing the majority (around 70%) of the Italian poultry slaughter plants. Data were recorded monthly during a 4-yr period (August 2001 to July 2005), considering a total of 1,266 million chicken broilers, 118 million turkeys, and 54 million spent hens, which represent 67.7, 84.0, and 28.4% of the national production, respectively. The overall average incidence of DOA was found to be 0.35, 0.38, and 1.22% in broilers, turkeys, and spent hens, respectively. The season significantly (P ≤ 0.01) influenced the mortality of all considered poultry categories, with higher incidence being observed during the summer (0.47, 0.52, and 1.62% for broilers, turkeys, and spent layers, respectively). The incidence of DOA broilers was found to be lower in small slaughter plants compared with medium and large slaughter plants (0.28 vs. 0.38 and 0.35%, P ≤ 0.01). The data obtained in this study might be used for establishing limit values of DOA as a welfare indicator during the preslaughter time of birds, including catching, loading, transportation, and lairage. ©2006 Poultry Science Association Inc.},

abstract={The origin and evolution of the type O foot-and-mouth disease viruses (FMDV) that caused the outbreak occurrence in Italy in 1993, the first episode of the disease in the EU after adoption of a non-vaccination policy in 1991, have been studied by the analysis of sequences encoding three main antigenic sites on the viral capsid proteins. The phylogenetic tree derived from sequences spanning the carboxyterminal end of VP1 showed that these Italian viruses were grouped in the ME-SA topotype, closely related to viruses that circulated previously in the Middle East. The analysis of the nucleotide sequences in VP1, VP2 and VP3 showed a co-circulation during the epizootic of genetic variants, including viruses with amino acid replacements in VP3. For some of the isolates analyzed, values of fixation of nucleotide substitutions per year were observed in the three regions analyzed, ranging from 1.5 to 5.1 × 10-2. The use of a panel of new monoclonal antibodies raised against an isolate from this outbreak, as well as monoclonal antibodies to FMDV O1-Switzerland 1965, showed differences in the reactivity pattern among some of the Italian isolates analyzed, which were consistent with the co-circulation of antigenic variants. These results support the potential for FMDV diversification in a limited period of time and under epidemiological conditions in which no vaccination campaigns were being implemented. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

abstract={Tissue and blood samples were collected from 152 wild boars (Sus scrofa) from the Maremma area (Grosseto district, Central Italy) between November 2002 and January 2003. The presence of pseudorabies virus (PRV) antibodies, antigen, and DNA were confirmed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunohistochemistry, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), respectively. Of 152 animals, 62 (41%) were positive for viral antigen in tonsillar tissue. Of the 80 serum samples that were suitable for testing, 41 (51%) were positive for PRV antibodies. Positive immunohistochemistry results were confirmed by PCR. A significantly higher prevalence of PRV antigen and seroprevalence was detected in older animals. No differences were detected between males and females or for animals coming from different areas sampled. Results confirm that PRV is endemic in this wild boar population with a high prevalence of infection. The results of immunohistochemistry investigations demonstrated that a large number of wild boars harbor PRV in tonsillar tissues and should be considered as an important reservoir of PRV. © Wildlife Disease Association 2006.},

abstract={E. coli biotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed on 48 cloacal swabs collected from a population of Audouin's gulls (Larus audouini) living in the Bay of Gallipoli (Lecce, Italy). The aim was to assess the pathogenic potential of the strains the gulls carry and shed into the environment and to gain a better understanding of the microbial pollution of the area they live in. Only one E. coli strain was rhamnose - (Rh) (biotype 8). All the other strains were Rh + with a prevalence of biotypes 30 and 31. Overall, the antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed a low level of antibiotic resistance. The findings suggest that the gull population does not have a heavy impact on the microbial nature of the Bay of Gallipoli and that the area does not present a high level of microbiological pollution.},

abstract={Chimerism, defined as the co-existence of cells of different origin within the same organism, has received much attention in hematopoietic cell and organ transplantation because of the strict relationship between its establishment and the induction of specific tolerance. Traditional methods applied for chimerism detection, such as immunohistochemistry, cytogenetics, fluorescent-activated cell sorter analysis, and serological and biochemical testing, are limited by their sensitivity. We have established a highly sensitive molecular approach based on the amplification of the mitochondrial cytochrome B gene and tested its specificity and sensitivity level in six different mammalian species, including human, pig, mouse, rat, sheep and rabbit. Increased sensitivity of detection of specific amplification products was obtained by the non-radioactive Southern blot technique. This novel approach allows the detection of one cell against the background of 1 to 4 × 106 xenogenec cells and will be helpful for high-sensitivity analysis of donor cell engraftment after xenotransplantation procedures in these animal models. © Blackwell Munksgaard, 2006.},

abstract={Two epidemics of avian influenza due to H5 and H7 highly pathogenic viruses occurred in poultry in Italy in 1997/98 and 1999/2000, respectively. The circulation of these serotypes in wild aquatic birds was investigated examining 638 cloacal swabs and 621 sera collected from 150 gulls, 162 coots, and 326 ducks trapped in Italian wetlands from 1998 to 2000. Seroprevalences against influenza A viruses, detected by a double-antibody sandwich-blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), were 11% in gulls, 16% in coots, and 45% in ducks. Among the Anatidae group, duck species wintering in Mediterranean areas showed significantly higher values than ducks wintering in South-Saharan areas of Africa. In order to detect H5 and H7 antibodies, the haemagglutination-inhibition assay and two competitive ELISA tests (H5-ELISA and H7-ELISA) using monoclonal antibodies specific for H5 and H7 subtypes were performed. None of the aquatic bird species were found seropositive for H7 subtype, whereas H5-positive sera were found by both the haemagglutination- inhibition and ELISA assays in ducks only. The highest H5 seroprevalences were detected by H5-ELISA; overall, 5% (10/201) of duck species wintering in Mediterranean areas tested positive by this assay, with annual seroprevalences ranging from 2% (2/123) to 12% (6/51). In the present study, only five viruses belonging to H1N1, H11N6, and H2N3 subtypes were isolated from ducks. However, the H5 seroconversion observed in one mallard duck at the beginning of 1998 indicates that H5 virus circulation also occurred in the study area. © 2005 Houghton Trust Ltd.},

abstract={Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) continues to be an important pathogen of poultry, causing significant production losses in many parts of the world. Eradication is the preferred method of control but it could result impractical after the organism has been introduced in an area with high density of poultry farms. TS-11® , a temperature-sensitive live attenuated MG vaccine, is currently utilized in several countries for the control of MG infections in commercial layers and broiler breeders. In the present field trial, conducted in an industrial meat-turkey farm (belonging to an integrated company), previously affected by severe MG infections, the ability of TS-11® in effectively colonizing the upper respiratory tract in a turkey flock was evaluated ("TS-11®" flock). A second flock grown in an adjacent pen of the same farm was vaccinated with an inactivated MG vaccine ("Inactivated" flock). Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis were applied for the detection and differentiation of TS-11® from other MG strains possibly present in the same flocks, such as the field strains and the 6/85 live vaccine strain currently utilized in commercial layers in Italy. PCR-RAPD results achieved in the "TS-11®" flock were compared with those of a flock of turkey grown in the same farm but vaccinated with an inactivated MG vaccine. Encouraging results were achieved by means of PCR-RAPD detection of TS-11® from all of the samples up to eight weeks post vaccination, whereas it was never detected in the "Inactivated" flock. Moreover, the field strain was never detected in the "TS-11®" flock but in the "Inactivated" one it was detected either 5 and 8 weeks after the vaccination. The aggregate production data of the two flocks resulted significantly improved when compared to the performance of the previous flocks grown in the same farm and similar to the production standard of the integrated company.},

abstract={A foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) polymerase (3D) with amino acid replacements G118D, V239M and G373D (triple DMD mutant) was obtained from a molecular clone derived from a virus population treated with ribavirin, in the transition to error catastrophe (virus extinction through lethal mutagenesis). DMD 3D was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and its activity compared with that of wild-type enzyme and mutant enzymes with either replacement G118D, G118A or D338A (the latter affecting the catalytic motif YGDD), generated by site-directed mutagenesis. No differences among the enzymes were noted in their interaction with monoclonal antibodies specific for the FMDV polymerase. Mutant enzymes with G118D or G118A showed a 100-fold decrease in polymerization activity relative to wild-type 3D, using poly(A)/oligo(dT)15 and poly(A)/VPg as template-primers, under several reaction conditions. As expected, the activity of 3D with D338A was undetectable (&lt;0.01 times the value for wild-type 3D). DMD and the G118 mutants showed impaired binding to template-primer RNA whereas the D338A mutant showed a binding similar to wild-type 3D. Transfection of cells with FMDV RNA encoding DMD 3D resulted in selection of revertant viruses that maintained only substitutions V239M and G373D. Consistently, when infectious transcripts encoded 3D with either G118D, G118A or D338A, viruses with reversions to the wild-type sequence were isolated. The implication of G118 in template-primer binding is supported by the location of this residue in the template-binding groove of the FMDV polymerase. In addition to identifying an amino acid residue that is critical for the binding of polymerase to RNA, the results document the presence of defective genomes in the transition of virus to error catastrophe. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV) is a picornavirus closely related to the human pathogen coxsackievirus B5. In common with other picornaviruses, the 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) of SVDV contains an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) that plays an important role in cap-independent translation. The aim of this study was to use RT-PCR and sequencing to characterize a fragment of the 5′ UTR encompassing the entire IRES. Sequence analysis demonstrated high nucleotide identities within the IRES between 33 representative SVDV isolates. These data support the choice of this region as a diagnostic target and provide information for the improvement of laboratory-based molecular assays to detect SVDV. In contrast to the relative conservation of the IRES element, there was considerable nucleotide variability in the spacer region located between the cryptic AUG at the 3′ end of the IRES and the initiation codon of the polyprotein. Interestingly, 11 SVDV isolates had block deletions of between 6 and 125 nt in this region. Nine of these isolates were of recent European origin and were phylogenetically closely related. In vitro growth studies showed that selected isolates with these deletions had a significantly reduced plaque diameter and grew to a significantly lower titre relative to an isolate with a full-length 5′ UTR. Further work is required to define the significance of these deletions and to assess whether they impact on the pathogenesis of SVD. © 2005 SGM.},

abstract={Mycobacterium caprae, a recently defined member of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, causes tuberculosis among animals and, to a limited extent, in humans in several European countries. To characterize M. caprae in comparison with other Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex members and to evaluate genotyping methods for this species, we analyzed 232 M. caprae isolates by mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit (MIRU) genotyping and by spoligotyping. The isolates originated from 128 distinct epidemiological settings in 10 countries, spanning a period of 25 years. We found 78 different MIRU patterns (53 unique types and 25 clusters with group sizes from 2 to 9) but only 17 spoligotypes, giving Hunter-Gaston discriminatory indices of 0.941 (MIRU typing) and 0.665 (spoligotyping). For a subset of 103 M. caprae isolates derived from outbreaks or endemic foci, MIRU genotyping and IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism were compared and shown to provide similar results. MIRU loci 4, 26, and 31 were most discriminant in M. caprae, followed by loci 10 and 16, a combination which is different than those reported to discriminate M. bovis best. M. caprae MIRU patterns together with published data were used for phylogenetic inference analysis employing the neighbor-joining method. M. caprae isolates were grouped together, closely related to the branches of classical M. bovis, M. pinnipedii, M. microti, and ancestral M. tuberculosis, but apart from modern M. tuberculosis. The analysis did not reflect geographic patterns indicative of origin or spread of M. caprae. Altogether, our data confirm M. caprae as a distinct phylogenetic lineage within the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Copyright © 2005, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={This report describes an experimental infection with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in combination with porcine parvovirus (PPV) in 3-week-old conventional colostrum-fed pigs with maternal antibodies to both viruses. Two groups of four pigs each were inoculated with PCV2 and PPV. One of the groups received also a commercial inactivated vaccine against porcine pleuropneumonia to evaluate possible effects of the stimulation of the immune system of pigs on the infection. Another group of four pigs was kept as uninfected control. Clinical signs, rectal temperatures and body weights were recorded. Serum antibody titers to PCV2 and PPV were determined at weekly intervals. Pigs were killed 42 days after inoculation and tissue samples were examined for the presence of gross and microscopic lesions. Tissues were also analyzed for the presence of PCV2 and PPV DNA by PCR, and for the presence of PCV2 antigen by immunohistochemistry (IHC). All the pigs had serum antibodies to PCV2 and PPV at the beginning of the trial. None of them developed clinical symptoms or pathological lesions typical of post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), a disease associated to PCV2 infection. However, IHC and/or PCR analyses showed that clinically silent PCV2 infection developed in five of the eight inoculated pigs, regardless of the administration of the vaccine. In particular, PCV2 DNA and/or antigen were detected in most of the tissues examined in the two pigs with the lowest titer of maternal PCV2 antibodies at the beginning of the trial. PPV DNA was not detected in any of the samples examined. The five pigs with PCR and/or IHC evidence of PCV2 infection had a mean weight gain during the experiment lower than that of the inoculated PCR-negative pigs considered together and that of the control pigs. In conclusion, it would appear that passive immunity against PCV2 can play a role in preventing the development of PMWS, but is not able to prevent the establishing of clinically silent PCV2 infections. The dissemination and persistence of the virus in the tissues may depend on the level of PCV2 antibodies at the time of inoculation. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The pharmacokinetics and intramuscular (IM) bioavailability of flumequine (15 mg kg-1) were investigated in healthy pigs and the findings related to published minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for susceptible bacteria of animal origin, and to experimentally determined MICs for susceptible strains of porcine origin. We found MICs for Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Pasteurella spp. and Bordetella spp. in the range 0.5 to &gt;64 μg mL-1 isolated from infected pigs in the Forlì area of Italy; only the Pasteurella multocida strains were sensitive (MIC90 = 0.5 μg mL-1). After intravenous (IV) injection, flumequine was slowly distributed and eliminated (t1/2γ1 1.40±0.16 h and t1/2γ2 6.35±1.69 h) The distribution volume at steady state (Vdss) was 752.59±84.03 mLkg-1 and clearance (ClB) was 237.19±17.88 mLkg-1 h-1. After IM administration, peak serum concentration (4.99±0.92 μg mL-1) was reached between the 2nd and the 3rd hour. The results on MIC of isolated bacteria, although only indicative, suggest that the efficacy of flumequine on Gram-negative bacteria may be impaired by the emergence of less sensitive or resistant strains. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={A rapid and very effective analytical procedure for the simultaneous HPLC determination of two anthelmintics, Flubendazole (FLUB) and Febantel (FEBA), in swine and poultry feeds was developed and tested. The ground feed samples were extracted using dimethylformamide. The extracts were directly analyzed, without any purification, on a reversed-phase ODS column (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) with acetonitrile-phosphate buffer (pH 3; 0.017 M) as mobile phase. Ultraviolet detection of FLUB and FEBA was carried out at 300 nm. The method was validated for specificity, linearity, accuracy, repeatability, limit of detection and limit of quantification. The limits of detection (LOD) of FLUB and FEBA in feeds, based on a detector signal-to-noise ratio of 3, were 3 mg kg-1 and the lowest levels tested in feeds by this procedure (limit of quantification, LOQ) were 10 mg kg-1. The mean recovery of FLUB and FEBA from spiked samples, in a concentration range of 10-200 mg kg -1, was 98% with a CV% of 4% and 99% with a CV% of 2%, respectively. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The effect of intramuscular injection of 40 mg/2 ml aluminium hydroxide in the neck of pigs was examined in a number of ways. The investigation followed repeated slaughterhouse reports, according to which 64.8% of pigs from one particular farm were found at slaughter to have one or more nodules in the muscles of the neck (group slaughtered). The pigs had been injected with a vaccine containing 40 mg/2 ml dose of aluminium hydroxide as adjuvant. Research consisted of two phases: first, an epidemiological study was carried out, aimed at determining the risk factors for the granulomas. The results indicated that the vaccine was to be held responsible for the formation of granulomas. A clinical trial was then performed to further substantiate the initial hypothesis, by comparing pigs, which were aseptically inoculated twice with either the original vaccine or the adjuvant alone (groups vaccine and adjuvant) to pigs inoculated twice with apyrogenic bi-distilled water (group water) and to pigs inoculated once with the adjuvant and once with apyrogenic bi-distilled water (group adjuvant/water). Both studies agreed in their conclusions, which indicate that the high amount of aluminium hydroxide was the cause of the granulomas. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Species identification in milk samples and milkderived products, such as cheese and mozzarella, is very important to assure product quality and to safeguard customers from commercial frauds, such as replacing expensive high-quality milk with lower quality and less expensive milk. Species identification is also strictly linked with food safety; substitutions could damage the consumer's health, causing allergic pathologies of various gravity. Electrophoretic and Chromatographic methods are widely used to identify the species of origin in milk and dairy products, but. new molecular biological methods, such as PCR, assure high sensitivity and specificity. The aim of this work was the development of PCR reactions using specific primers for bovine (Bos tourus), buffalo (Bubolus bubalis), goat (Capra hircus), sheep (Ovis aries), donkey (Equus asinus), and horse (Equus caballus) DNA to reveal the genomes of these species in milk, cheese, and mozzarella samples.},

abstract={A 9-year-old female, domestic short hair cat was presented with sudden onset of polyuria/polydipsia, and hundreds of cutaneous nodules. Prior to referral, the cat had had four skin nodules that were treated with steroids. The four skin nodules then multiplied to form more than 100 ulcerated and nonulcerated nodules located all over the trunk. Clinical evaluation revealed hypothermia and respiratory distress. Cytology from both skin nodules and bronchoalveolar lavage showed macrophages and small organisms whose shape and size were indicative of Toxoplasma spp., or similar organisms. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) serology results were negative. The cat was seropositive for Toxoplasma (IgG 1 : 640) and Neospora(1 : 80) infections. The cat died soon after referral. Necropsy revealed pyothorax, necrotic/purulent pneumonia, haemorrhagic spots on kidneys and mesentery. Histopathology from skin nodules showed diffuse, deep necrotic dermatitis/panniculitis, vasculitis and disseminated free and grouped protozoa. The parasites were found in lungs, spleen, kidneys and liver. Immunohistochemistry on skin tissue with anti-Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum antibodies gave positive results with both. Electron microscopy showed single and grouped tachyzoites with morphological features of T. gondii, often within macrophages. Samples of cutaneous nodules and bronchoalveolar fluid were examined by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for detecting apicomplexa coccidia. PCR results were consistent only with T. gondii infection. Therefore, immunohistochemistry positivity for N. caninum was considered a cross-reaction and a diagnosis of cutaneous and visceral toxoplasmosis was made. © 2005 European Society of Veterinary Dermatology.},

abstract={Background: The cytologic diagnosis of ear canal tumors is difficult or impossible by swab alone because cell exfoliation may be poor and neoplastic cells may be masked by associated inflammation. Fine-needle biopsy (FNB) can be used to obtain a higher yield of cells for diagnosis. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and diagnostic value of FNB and cytologic examination in providing an accurate diagnosis of masses growing in the external ear canal of cats. Methods: Cytologic specimens from masses in the external ear canal, taken under inhaled, general anesthesia, were classified into 4 groups: 1) ceruminous gland hyperplasia or adenoma, 2) ceruminous gland adenocarcinoma, 3) inflammatory polyps, and 4) other neoplastic and non-neoplastic masses. Cytopathologic diagnoses were compared with the final histopathologic diagnoses, and indices of diagnostic test accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, diagnostic-odds ratios) were calculated. Results: Twenty-seven masses (from 25 cats, including 2 cats affected bilaterally) were included in the study. The results showed good correspondence between cytologic and histologic diagnoses with an overall agreement index (κ) of .74, a diagnostic odds ratio of 22, and 100% (27/27) agreement in the diagnosis of inflammatory polyps versus neoplasia (both benign and malignant). Conclusions: FNB cytopathology of external ear masses in the cat was sufficiently accurate for distinguishing inflammatory polyps from neoplasia. For differentiation of benign proliferation and malignant neoplasia, however, histopathologic confirmation is recommended. ©2005 American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology.},

abstract={The present survey collected and analyzed the results of routine testing for Salmonella enterica and Listeria monocytogenes on foods of animal origin submitted for official controls in Italy during 2001 to 2002. Salmonella was detected in 2.2% of 71,643 food samples examined, and the isolation rates ranged from 9.9% for raw poultry meat to less than 0.1% for dairy products. Isolation rates were also high in raw pork (4.9%) and processed meats (5.3%), which often involved pork. Low rates were observed in seafood (0.5%) and in ready-to-eat foods, such as grocery products (0.7%) and ice creams (0.1%). Serotyping showed that approximately 50% of the isolates belonged to the serotypes most commonly isolated from humans in Italy, thus confirming that most cases of human salmonellosis have a foodborne origin. Levels of L. monocytogenes were higher than what is accepted by the current regulation in 2.4% of 42,300 food samples. The positivity rates ranged from 10.3% in raw pork to none in eggs and egg products. Contamination rates were higher in other meat products (between 2 and 5%) and fish (6.5%) than in cheeses (1.1%) and other dairy products (0.6%). Routine control activities on the microbial contamination of foods can generate data with statistical and epidemiological value. Such data can be used as a basis for estimating the exposure of consumers to foodborne pathogens, following the trends of contamination over time, and evaluating the effects of control measures on the contamination of food.

abstract={During influenza surveillance activities carried out from 1999 to 2001 in wild ducks, 311 cloacal swabs were collected in Central Italy. A total of 20 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) were isolated, that belonged to eight different subtypes. Five of these subtypes had never been isolated before in the area under study, including two H7N3 viruses obtained from mallards in Autumn 2001. One year after, outbreaks of AI caused by H7N3 LP viruses occurred and rapidly spread among commercial poultry farms in Northern Italy. We compared the H7N3 duck strains with the first two H7N3 turkey isolate, and a high level of similarity between the two viruses was found in all genes, except for the NA. The N3 genes of domestic poultry strains showed a 23-amino acid deletion in the stalk region, indicating an initial adaptation of wild waterfowl viruses to terrestrial bird species. Phylogenetic data are also discussed. This is the first report in which a domestic poultry AIV and its direct wild bird counterpart are described. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The goal of the study was to genotypically compare S. aureus isolates from mastitis milk and raw milk to identify the relation between strains and to assess the enterotoxigenicity of the isolates. Eighty-three Staphylococcus aureus isolates recovered from cows and bulk tank milk of five farms in northern Italy were compared genotypically. The genes for the enterotoxins A, D, G and I, but not for B, C, E and H and the toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1), were detected by PCR amplification. Macrorestriction analysis with the restrictions enzyme SmaI revealed 14 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. These were in part different from each other only in a few fragments and thus displayed a close clonal relation. The results of the present investigation showed that identical or closely related clones seemed to be responsible for the cases of bovine mastitis in the farms investigated and partly responsible for contamination of bulk tank milk.},

abstract={Vaccination programs to control Aujeszky's-disease virus (ADV) using gE-deleted vaccines are being considered in several European countries. Knowledge of factors influencing ADV-seropositivity for vaccinated herds might contribute to the success of these programs. A multivariable analysis of ADV-seropositivity in 1248 swine herds (332 farrow-to-finish, 260 farrow-to-feeder and 656 finishing herds) in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy revealed that (1) high pig density (number of pigs in a 6-km radius), (2) gilt purchasing, and (3) increased number of fattening pigs were risk factors for farrow-to-finish herds. In farrow-to-feeder herds, ADV-seropositivity was related to (1) increased number of breeders, (2) heavy-gilt purchasing, and (3) increased pig density. In finishing herds, (1) increased herd size was related to ADV-seropositivity, whereas (2) periodic rearing suspension was protective. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In pigs, the genetic selection for lean, large muscle blocks and fast growth has been linked to an increased prevalence of metabolic diseases such as porcine stress syndrome and mulberry heart disease. These diseases are associated with cardiovascular inadequacy, which may lead to oxidative stress. In the present study, reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs) and the anti-oxidant power (OXY) in sera of different swine groups were investigated. The following groups were selected (each around 80 kg body weight): wild boars (WB), Cinta Senese (CS), and Landrace × Large White (LxLW), the latter as both specific pathogen-free (SPF) and intensively farmed animals. In addition, a group of LxLW agonic sows (AS) was also investigated; this group is known to be under oxidative stress. Two colorimetric micro-methods were used to measure ROMs and OXY; ROMs were expressed as mM H2O2 and OXY as μM HOCl neutralised. Between groups, average ROM and OXY values were found to be significantly different by one-way ANOVA (P &lt; 0.001). ROM levels were lower in WB (13.41 ± 1.85) and CS (19.27 ± 1.68), and highest in LxLW (42.00 ± 1.36). OXY values ranged from 260.10 ± 22.13 (WB) to 396.90 ± 9.83 (LxLW). Only one swine group (the CS group) showed a significant, positive correlation between ROM and OXY values. The AS group even showed a negative correlation between ROM and OXY values. These results imply satisfactory environmental coping occurred only within the CS group. Results are discussed in the light of animal welfare legislation, food safety and consumers' protection.},

abstract={Bartonella henselae has been identified and characterized for the first time in Italy. A strain, designed Pavia-1, was isolated from the blood of a cat whose owner developed cat scratch disease (CSD). Pavia-1 and two American B. henselae strains (Houston-1, ATCC 49882, type I and strain 269608, UC Davis, type II) were compared by whole-cell fatty analysis (CFA), sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) for protein profiles, Western immunoblotting (WB) for reactivity with polyclonal antibodies, polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), type-specific 16S rRNA PCRs, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Bartonella clarridgeiae (ATCC 51734) was also included for comparison. Pavia-1 was identified as a B. henselae type I. PFGE allowed differentiation between B. clarridgeiae and B. henselae and furthermore, between all the B. henselae strains. The fingerprints of PFGE observed for Pavia-1 were distinct from those of B. henselae type II and also of Houston-1, suggesting that the two type I strains derived from two different clones. These results show the capability of B. henselae to develop genotypic variability between genetically related strains. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Twenty-one wild brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) were collected from four areas of Milan (Italy). Main organs were harvested from each rat, fixed in 10% neutral bu1er formalin, and embedded in paraffin. Organ sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, kidney sections were also stained with the Ziehl-Neelsen method. Graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry was performed on all kidney samples. The presence of inclusion bodies and karyocytomegaly was scored. Six adult rats out of 21 (28.6%) showed kariocytomegaly and intranuclear inclusion bodies of the renal proximal tubules, characteristic of lead toxicity. The nuclear inclusion bodies were always Ziehl-Neelsen positive. The six rats which showed the characteristic histological alterations ascribed to lead, had lead concentrations statistically higher than the three control rats (4 mg/g wet wt. versus 0.09 mg/g wet wt., P<0.001) and than the captured wild rats. Intranuclear inclusion bodies were found in rats with kidney lead concentrations greater than 0.6 mg/g wet weight. There were significant di1erences between the four areas of capture. The incidence of intranuclear inclusion bodies and karyocytomegaly in proximal tubular cells was higher in rats with high lead levels detected by spectrophotometry. The present results indicate a renal lead concentration of 0.6 mg/g wet weight as a threshold to detect histologic kidney changes due to lead absorption. Results demonstrate that the examination of adult free-living rats may be considered an appropriate method to obtain a rapid, sensitive, easy, cost e1ective estimate of lead contamination in urban areas. Animal models allow us to evaluate potential human health risk associated with environmental contamination. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Because of the frequent exposure of cattle to mycobacteria of the avium/intracellulare group, an investigation was carried out into the possible repercussions thereof on the diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis. Three calves from a bovine tuberculosis-free herd, scored avian reactors in the γ-interferon assay for bovine tuberculosis, were sedated and inoculated endotracheally with a virulent Mycobacterium bovis strain. Then, three other avian reactors were housed with the above donor calves. Mycobacterium bovis was isolated from the nasal swabs of the three endotracheally infected, donor calves. On these samples, TB complex-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for IS6110 were also positive, albeit with a different time kinetics. The three contact-infected calves showed clear immunological signs of infection; however, their nasal swabs were always PCR-negative and only Mycobacterium avium was isolated. In the endotracheally infected donor calves there was a rise of the γ-interferon responses to avian and bovine purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculins, which reached the same stable plateau levels over the whole experiment. The above effect was also observed in the contact-infected calves, even though the response to avian PPD tuberculin always remained at a higher level. By using conventional bovine and avian PPD tuberculins, the comparative intradermal test was generally positive in endotracheally infected, as opposed to contact-infected calves; a positive intradermal test for M. bovis was obtained in two contact-infected calves by different bovine PPD tuberculins based on M. bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) secreted or somatic antigens. It was concluded that M. bovis infection may be concealed for some time in cattle sensitized by mycobacteria of the avium/intracellulare group and that different diagnostic procedures should be adopted for such animals.},

abstract={The effect of succynil-β-cyclodextrin (β-CD-Su), dimethyl-β-cyclodextrin (DIMEB) and β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) on the fluorescence of aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, G2 and M1 (AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, AFG2 and AFM1) was studied: β-CD-Su promoted the largest fluorescence enhancement for AFB1 and AFM1 while DIMEB showed better results for AFG1. On the basis of the fluorescence enhancement, a new RP-HPLC method for detecting aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, G2 and M1 was developed using cyclodextrins directly dissolved in the LC eluent. Aflatoxins B1, B2, G1 and G2 were resolved using a MICRA NPS ODS-1 column using methanol-water as mobile phase to which 6×10-3 M β-CD-Su or β-CD were added. Chromatographic responses of AFB1 and AFG1 achieved using β-CD dissolved in the mobile phase were enhanced, respectively, 8 and 12 times, and 10 and 15 times with β-CD-Su. Detection limits lower than 0.3 μg/kg were achieved for all the four aflatoxins. Aflatoxin M1 was analysed using a Spherisorb S3 ODS-2 Narrow Bore column and methanol-water as mobile phase with added 2×10-3 M β-CD-Su. An area enhancement of 1.5 was detected for the toxin and the detection limit achieved under these analytical conditions was lower than 0.0005 μg/kg. Both methods were statistically validated showing a linear response for all the aflatoxins tested (R2≥0.99), and applied to the analysis of spiked and naturally contaminated food samples. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={Forty-seven wild brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) collected from the urban area of Milan (Italy) were screened for Capillaria hepatica liver infection. The liver of each rat was grossly and histologically examined for the presence of C. hepatica adults, eggs and typical C hepatica-induced lesions. In 17 rats (36%) liver lesions consistent with C. hepatica infection were detected. Grossly, white-yellow nodules of 1-5 mm in diameter were present, either scattered on the liver surface or localized in a single lobe. Histologically, granulomatous liver lesions associated with eggs and/or worms were observed. The degree of gross liver involvement was moderate in most of the positive cases (71%). About 30 cases of C. hepatica infection in humans have been documented world-wide, most of which are reported in children from 1 to 5 years of age. Our results suggest that the potential transmission of C. hepatica to children in the study area should be considered an important health issue.},

abstract={Immunoblotting was used to check the antigenic profiling of 27 Mycoplasma meleagridis strains isolated in different countries. Hyperimmune polyclonal rabbit antiserum as well as monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised against M. meleagridis (MM) showed antigen heterogeneity among strains. Five anti-MM MAbs were selected for lack of reaction against heterologous avian mycoplasma. Three of these five Mabs did not cross-react with 63 mycoplasma strains from six species affecting turkeys other than M. meleagridis. The five Mabs used to analyse the epitopes of 30 M. meleagridis strains indicated that some epitopes were not expressed in all strains. Moreover, other epitopes were located on proteins which differed according to number or molecular mass from strain to strain. The five Mabs therefore, recognised variable surface proteins, among which two were amphiphilic membrane proteins. Three of the selected Mabs recognised 29 or 30 of the 30 tested strains. The in vitro expression of surface epitopes in M. meleagridis ATCC 25284 was investigated by colony immunobinding and allowed demonstration of a variable antigenic system. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={Between 1990 and 1993, 61 outbreaks of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) were reported in Lombardy, Northern Italy. In this study, gross pathological examination was carried out on 3129 slaughtered cattle, 716 of which (22.9%) showed typical CBPP pulmonary lesins. Single or multiple renal infarcts at different stages of development were observed in 88 (12.2%) of these 716 cattle. The kidneys of 77 cattle whose lungs showed typical CBPP lesions and were bacteriologically and immunohistochemically positive for the small colony type of Mycoplasma mycoides subspecies mycoides (M. m. mycoides SC) were selected and submitted to histological, immunohistochemical and bacteriological examination. Histologically, in chronic CBPP cases, infarcts were characterized by fibrosis, calcification of cortical tubules and tubular atrophy, accompanied by the presence of interstitial inflammatory infiltrates composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells and histiocytes. M. m. mycoides SC antigen was detected immunohistochemically in 65 (84.4%) of the 77 kidneys examined. The antigen was detected in the lumen of blood vessels and in glomerular cells. Immunolabelled interstitial cells and tubular epithelial cells were seen in chronic cases only. M. m. mycoides SC was isolated from the kidneys of 12 animals (15.6%) and more frequently in cases with renal infarcts. This study confirms previous observations that demonstrated a renal involvement in cases of CBPP. Moreover, the immunohistochemical results indicated that M. m. mycoides SC antigen was frequently detectable in different renal structures and cells in spontaneous cases of CBPP. © 2001 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.},

abstract={H3N2 and “avian-like” H1N1 subtypes have circulated in European pigs since the mid- to late 1970s. Following reassortment to acquire six internal genes of the H1N1 viruses in the early 1980s, the H3N2 viruses have evolved to produce antigenically distinguishable variants. Sw/Finistere/127/99, isolated from a pig in January 1999, was shown to be closely related in antigenic and genetic characteristics to contemporary human A/Sydney/5/97-like viruses, and may represent the emergence of another “human-like” virus in European pigs. The H1N1 viruses circulating in pigs in France have evolved gradually over the past 20 years, but are in general closely related to early isolates such as Sw/Finistere/2899/82. An antigenically distinct variant, represented by Sw/Ille et Vilaine/1455/99, represents a significant drift from other recent French H1N1 viruses. Most of the H1N2 reassortant viruses isolated in France and Italy since 1997 were shown to be genetically similar to the H1N2 viruses which have become prevalent in the U.K., but to exhibit significant variation in antigenicity. Genetic reassortment between H1N2 and H1N1 viruses has also contributed to the recent increase in diversity of viruses circulating in pigs in Europe, and emphasizes the potential difficulties in controlling influenza by vaccination. Since most of these swine viruses are resistant to amantadine, they provide an increasing pool of amantadine-resistant M genes for potential incorporation into future human viruses. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={Immunostimulants represent a modern and promising tool in aquaculture, enhancing the resistance of cultured fish to disease and stress. This study investigated the effect of a combination of dietary glucans, α-tocopherol and ascorbic acid on the innate immune response of cultured sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). After 5 weeks of adaptation on a commercial diet containing 100 p.p.m. ascorbic acid and 200 p.p.m. α-tocopherol, sea bass were switched to a diet supplemented with 2% β-1.3/ β-1.6 glucans and ascorbic acid and α-tocopherol at 500 p.p.m. The supplemented diet was given at 2% of body weight per day over a 2 week period, every 3 months. Plasma lysozyme concentration, content and distribution of major plasma proteins and complement activity were measured prior to feeding the supplemented diet and after 40 weeks. Alternative pathways of complement activation and lysozyme activity were both significantly enhanced in fish fed on glucans and elevated doses of vitamins. No significant differences were observed in protein content or in albumin/globulin ratio. Compared to lysozyme activity, which showed marked individual variation, complement-mediated haemolytic activity has been shown to be a more reliable indicator of sea bass immunocompetence. Further studies are in progress to clarify the effect of each dietary component on the innate immune response and disease resistance.},

Group 1 received the modified virus by the intradermal (first inoculation)-intramuscular (second inoculation) routes; group 2 was treated by the intranasal (first inoculation)-intramuscular (second inoculation) routes. The third group was left untreated as the control. All of the pigs were challenged intranasally with a virulent PRV strain and they were subsequently injected with dexamethasone. Two pigs in each group were necropsied on days 5 and 15 after dexamethasone inoculation. The challenge exposure resulted in mild clinical signs, increase in growth and a shorter period of virus shedding in vaccinated pigs, whereas the control group showed severe signs of Aujeszky's disease. No difference in the titre of the virulent virus which was excreted by pigs of all three groups, was observed and all animals seroconverted. Both the mutant strain and the wild-type virus established a latent infection although only the latter was reactivated and shed. Slight lesions were observed in target tissues of the vaccinated animals and no significant differences were detected between the two inoculation schedules.},

The combination of ELISA techniques that distinguished IgA, IgG and IgM antibody responses and a longitudinal data set, mainly based on capture-mark-recapture of rabbits, provided a reliable basis for interpreting serology and set the criteria used to classify rabbits' immunological status. Importantly, young with maternal antibodies, immune rabbits and rabbits apparently re-exposed to RHD were readily separated. Three outbreaks of RHD occurred in 1996-7. The timing of RHD outbreaks was mainly driven by recruitment of young rabbits that generally contracted RHD after they lost their maternally derived immunity. Young that lost maternal antibodies in summer were not immediately infected, apparently because transmission of RHDV slows at that time, but contracted RHD in the autumn when conditions were again suitable for disease spread.},

A Gram-negative bacterium was consistently isolated in pure culture from tissues. Isolates were typed biochemically as E. coli, but they were lactose negative and non-motile. The serotyping tests typed the isolates as somatic group O111. The isolates were sensitive to enrofloxacin, amoxycil and colimycin, and partially sensitive to flumequine, all of which were used for therapy. The disease was reproduced experimentally in both specific pathogen free chickens and commercial layers by intramuscular inoculation of the E. coli, but only in some layers when inoculated by the oro-nasal route. The stress of the onset of lay seemed to be the most probable precipitating cause of the disease.},

abstract={In the course of two experiments, an examination was made of the virulence and neuroinvasiveness for pigs of two pseudorabies virus mutants (strain 6C2TK-, with a defect in thymidine kinase (TK) function; and strain 6C2TK-, gI-/gE-, with defects in TK and glycoproteins I and E) and of the wild-type parent strain (86/27V). At various times after intranasal inoculation, pigs were killed and samples of tonsil, lung and different levels of the trigeminal and olfactory nervous pathways were examined by methods that included viral isolation, polymerase chain reaction assay and immunohistochemistry. Both mutant viruses were of reduced virulence, as indicated by no more than moderate clinical signs and lesions, and only sporadic isolation of virus; moreover, unlike the wild-type parent strain, the mutant viruses were not reactivated from the latent state by corticosteroid treatment. In addition, migration of the mutant strains to the central nervous system (olfactory and trigeminal nervous pathways) was reduced as compared with that of the wild-type strain. Thus, mutations in the genes encoding the TK enzyme and the gI/gE complex were associated with reduced virulence, reduced replication in peripheral target tissues, and reduced migration to the olfactory and trigeminal pathways.

Acute enteritis was observed in calves submitted to post mortem examination at 5 and 6 days p. i. In these animals viral DNA was specifically detected on histological sections by an in situ hybridization (ISH) technique; BAV-4 was isolated from most of the organs and numerous adenovirus-positive endothelial cells were present in the gastrointestinal tract, mesenteric lymph nodes and liver. In the calf examined 10 days p. i. no lesions were observed and rare ISH positive cells were detected.

Three ELISAs for the detection of antibodies to 3ABC were developed. Two assays rely on the competition of test sera against either a anti-3A Mab or against antisera to 3ABC raised in rabbits and guinea-pigs. The third, 3ABC Mat-ELISA, based on the direct binding of antibodies to the 3ABC trapped by a specific Mab, provided the best combination of specificity and sensitivity The 3ABC Mat-ELISA was extensively validated for cattle, either in experimental and in field conditions, showing specificity of 99% in vaccinated and in naive cattle and the capacity to detect silent infections in FMD-vaccinated populations The test showed similar specificity and sensitivity in experimentally vaccinated and infected sheep. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Hyperkeratosis-associated coryneform (HAC) is a coryneform bacterium, with a biochemical profile similar to Corynebacterium bovis, that causes hyperkeratotic dermatitis in athymic nude mice. In the present study 28 severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice coming from six different animal facilities were submitted for bacteriological and pathological examination. HAC was isolated from 10 SCID mice belonging to two of these facilities. Two of the HAC-infected mice showed macroscopical lesions consisting in large alopecic areas, with small white flakes, involving the dorsum, flanks, neck and cheeks. Histologically, the skin of these animals was characterized by diffuse acanthosis and hyperkeratosis. In the other eight HAC-infected SCID mice no macroscopical lesions were observed but focal areas of minimal to mild acanthosis were histologically detected in five cases. These results suggest that HAC can infect SCID mice inducing skin lesions similar, although generally less severe, to those observed in nude mice with hyperkeratotic dermatitis. Our results pointed out that SCID mice may play an important role in the epidemiology of hyperkeratotic dermatitis of athymic nude mice.},

abstract={Hyperkeratotic dermatitis of athymic nude mice is an infectious disease caused by a coryneform bacterium. During the spring of 1995, outbreaks of hyperkeratotic dermatitis were observed in several nude mice facilities in northern Italy. In this report we describe the clinical, histopathological and microbiological features of the disease in two different animal facilities. Affected animals showed a typical 'scaly' appearance with small white flares of material adherent to the skin. In one of the outbreaks (facility 2) the lesions were less severe and involved only limited areas of the body. The infection spread very quickly and the morbidity reached more than 80% in a few days, while the mortality was about 1%. The lesions resolved spontaneously within 7-10 days. Histological examination of affected skin revealed orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis, acanthosis and dermal inflammatory infiltration which were more severe in mice from facility 1. In Gram-stained sections groups of rods consistent with coryneform bacteria were detectable in the keratin layers covering the epidermal surface. A coryneform bacterium, biochemically typed as Corynebacterium bovis, was isolated from 11 out of 11 mice from facility 1 and from 8 out of 11 mice from facility 2.},

abstract={The lentogenic La Sota strain of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was adapted to grow in the BS/BEK cell line of bovine embryo kidney origin with a infectious titre similar to that in chicken embryos. No modification in the biological properties was detected after serial passages in the cell line, as indicated by CPE and by size and shape of the plaques. By contrast, the intracerebral pathogenicity index test, determined in 1-day-old chicks, was lower than for La Sota grown in chicken embryos. However, the immunogenicity of the cell culture adapted virus did not show any variation as demonstrated by serological response and by protection following challenge with virulent NDV. Accordingly, it appears that La Sota grown in cell cultures has retained its biological and immunological characteristics and if these results are confirmed by field trials and long term protection tests, the use of the BS/BEK cell line could be an alternative to chicken embryos for the cultivation of NDV. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

In these animals no clinical abnormalities were observed and all the tested parameters (haematology, biochemistry and urine analysis) were within the normal ranges. Leptospiral antibody titres ranging from 1:100 to 1:6400, against a serovar (hardio) belonging to the Sejroe serogroup, were detected by the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) in the serum of the 19 dogs with interstitial nephritis. All animals without renal lesions were seronegative. Leptospiral antigen was detected immunohistochemically in the kidneys of 4 dogs; leptospires were detected in Warthin-Starry stained sections of one dog. Leptospires were isolated from the kidneys of 3 of the 4 dogs examined by bacterial culture. The isolated strains were typed as serovar sejroe by restriction endonuclease digestion and Southern blot hybridization analysis of their DNA. It was concluded that Leptospira interrogans serovar sejroe, was responsible for an asymptomatic chronic renal infection which was widespread in this group of laboratory dogs. © 1995, Royal Society of Medicine Press.

abstract={Two mutant strains of pseudorabies virus (PRV) were selected from the virulent 86/27V virus treated with chemical drugs. The viruses, named 6A1 and 6C2, respectively, appeared to be unable to express thymidine kinase function, as demonstrated by the autoradiography test. They showed a reduced virulence for some susceptible animal species (chickens, mice, rabbits, calves, lambs and piglets) and virus was isolated sporadically. The mutant viruses appeared to be able to protect animals against infection with the virulent strain of PRV. At gross, as well as at histological examination, no lesions in apparatus, system and tissues were detected in pigs inoculated with 6A1 and 6C2 viruses. By contrast, rabbits treated with 6C2 mutant strain presented lymphomononucleated cuffs, microgliosis, and neuronophagia in some areas of the brain. This focal spreading, together with the absence of neuronal necrosis and intranuclear inclusions, suggest an infection induced by a modified strain of PRV. © 1995 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Two novel formats of ELISA for the detection of antibodies against swine vesicular disease (SVD) virus were developed. One of the tests described is a monoclonal antibody-based competitive ELISA (MAC-ELISA). In this test, specific antibodies in serum are detected due to their ability to compete with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MAb). The second is an indirect trapping ELISA which employs isotype-specific MAbs to detect swine IgG or IgM specific for SVD virus. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the MAC-ELISA was studied on 5671 field sera of known origin, enabling the cut-off level to be defined. Using the MAC-ELISA, 100% of sera from infected pigs were found positive, whereas only 0.45% of negative sera gave a false-positive result. A positive correlation between MAC-ELISA and virus neutralizing titres was recorded for pig sera collected sequentially after experimental infections. The results from the isotype-specific ELISA revealed the dynamics of the antibody response to SVD virus in pigs. The first antibodies were detectable as early as 3 days after experimental infection. Up to the 10th day, demonstrable antibodies were exclusively of the IgM class. IgG developed later, between 11 and 14 days postinfection and remained at a plateaux level throughout the whole investigation period. The two tests satisfy different diagnostic requirements: the MAC-ELISA is useful as a screening test, the isotype-specific ELISA has potential application for the determination of stage of infection. Both tests benefit from the use of MAbs in terms of specificity and standardization and have advantages over the virus neutralization test. © 1995.},

This evaluation was carried out using a classic immunofluorescence assay (IFA), a surface immunofluorescence assay (SIFA) and a standard Western Blot (WB) assay. A total of 104 out of 3,186 (3.26%) serum samples were positive for both spirochetes when tested by IFA, with titres ranging from 1/40 to 1/1280. All positive specimens showed the same or a higher reactivity against B. anserina than against B. burgdorferi. Of the IFA positive samples, 30 were tested by WB and SIFA to evaluate further the specificity of the antibody response, i.e. to try to clarify against which spirochete the antibodies were raised. The presence of antibodies against the 23 kDa protein exclusive to B. anserina, and against epitopes which are not surface‐exposed and which are common to B. anserina and B. burgdorferi, was assessed by WB and SIFA. No serological evidence that B. burgdorferi can infect pigeons was found. © 1995 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

However, it could be allocated to a previously unreported γδ T cell compartment. This assumption was suggested by: 1. The surface expression of CD3; 2. PCR amplification of the Cδ TcR gene from cDNA; and 3. The detection of peripheral blood precursors expressing the workshop cluster (WC) 1 marker of bovine γδ T cells. These cells are recognized by murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 5D4, 1E7, 6F9 and 8D7, raised in the authors' laboratory. The above mAbs also identify distinct groups of cells in thymus, spleen, lymph nodes and about 1 % of uncultured PBL. The most diffuse infiltration of such cells was shown in the small intestine, as both intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocytes.

abstract={The efficacy of an immunomodulator, the Baypamun (Bayer AG), was tested in calves which were subsequently exposed to bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1) infection. Two groups of calves, of 8 animals each, were used for two trials. In one trial, 4 calves were treated with the immunomodulator and the remaining 4 were left as untreated controls. Two hours after the first injection of Baypamun, all calves, i.e. the treated and the untreated ones, were challenged with BHV-1. Comparing them to the untreated controls, the calves which were given the immunomodulator developed milder signs of the disease and shed a significantly lower concentration of virus. In the second experiment, 4 calves were given Baypamun and 4 calves were not, as above, but they were not inoculated with BHV-1; however, they were housed together with the calves of the former group (experimentally infected with BHV-1). The 8 calves all became infected but those that had been treated with Baypamun did not show any clinical signs of the disease, whereas the untreated calves underwent a clinical response which was considered to be typical of BHV-1 respiratory infection, as usually seen under natural conditions. In this case the shedding of virus by the calves treated with the immunomodulator also underwent a significant reduction. © 1995.},

abstract={A protocol for efficient electrotransformation of Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus) Lancefield's strain O90R (NTCT 9993) (an unencapsulated derivative of type Ia strain O90) was developed. The Escherichia coli - Streptococcus shuttle vector pDP28 (7.8 kb) carrying the ermB gene for resistance to erythromycin was used as donor DNA. Frozen 'electrocompetent' cells were prepared by repeated washes in 10% glycerol. A 50-μl aliquot containing about 5×109 colony forming units of bacteria was subjected to the electric pulse. Optimal conditions for electrotransformation were determined using different media, harvesting cells at different points of the growth curve, and using different field strengths. The dose-response curve for transformation of S. agalactiae with pDP28 showed one-hit kinetics as donor DNA varied between 0.01 and 3 μg. The efficiency of electrotransformation for this range of amounts of donor DNA was 1.2×104 cfu μg-1. The transformation frequencies obtained with this electroporation protocol are high enough to allow both subcloning and shotgun cloning of streptococcal DNA in S. agalactiae. © 1994.},

These features, along with the notable instability of a few non-structural FMDV A5 proteins in infected cells, outline a new scenario, in which the reduced immunogenicity of FMDV might be accounted for by defined negative influences of the cell environment on viral replication. © 1994.},

abstract={Fourteen dogs which had died from acute leptospirosis, three dogs which survived an acute attack of leptospirosis and seven healthy dogs living in close contact with the animals which died were examined for the presence of lepto‐spiral antibodies by the microscopic agglutination test. Twelve dogs had titres of 1:3200 or greater. The predominant titre was directed against serovar bratislava in seven cases, serovar grippothyphosa in two cases and both these serovars in two cases. In one case the predominant titre was directed against serovars bratislava, grippothyphosa, copenhageni (serogroup icterohaemorrhagiae) and pomona. The present study and other recent reports suggest that the epidemiology of canine leptospirosis is changing with the emergence of serovars differing from those typically infecting dogs, namely canicola and icterohaemorrhagiae.

abstract={A field trial was set up to evaluate the effect of human lymphoblastoid interferon (IFN) as a biological response modifier (BRM) in cattle. Two different doses (100 and 1000 International Units/kg body weight) of partially purified interferon from Namalwa cells were administered to suckling calves, after animals were introduced into a large veal fattening and finishing unit. The clinical conditions of the calves and some parameters of specific and non‐specific immunity, along with the individual weights, were evaluated over a 4‐month period. The higher IFN dose correlated with a favourable clinical response of calves to a respiratory syndrome; this was further substantiated by a dramatic improvement of the growth rate with respect to control calves. To a lesser extent, this also occurred in calves given the lower IFN dose. These results suggest better disease resistance in IFN‐treated calves, possible associated with dose‐dependent regulation of basic homeostatic functions. © 1994 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Background Picornaviruses are responsible for a wide range of mammalian diseases and, in common with other RNA viruses, show considerable antigenic variation. Foot-and-mouth disease viruses (FMDVs) constitute one genus of the picornavirus family and are classified into seven serotypes, each of which shows considerable intratypic variation. This antigenic variation leads to continuing difficulties in controlling the disease. To date the structure of only one serotype, O, has been reported. Results The three-dimensional structure of a serotype C (isolate C-S8c1) FMDV, has been determined crystallographically at 3.5 å resolution. The main chain conformation of the virion is very similar to that of type O 1 virus. The immunodominant G-H loop of VP1, the presumed site of cell attachment, is disordered in both types of virus indicating a functional role for flexibility of this region. There are significant changes in the structure of other antigenic loops and in some internal regions involved in protomer-protomer contacts, including the entire amino-terminal portion of VP2, described here for the first time for a picornavirus. Antigenic sites have been identified by genetic and peptide mapping methods, and located on the capsid. The data reveal a major new discontinuous antigenic site (site D) which is located near to the three-fold axis and involves residues of VP1, VP2 and VP3 which lie adjacent to each other on the capsid. Conclusions In FMDV type C, amino acid substitutions seen in mutants that are resistant to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) map to predominantly surface-oriented residues with solvent-accessible side-chains not involved in interactions with other amino acids, whereas residues which are accessible but not substituted are found to be more frequently involved in protein- protein interactions. This provides a molecular interpretation for the repeated isolation of the same amino acid substitutions in MAb-resistant variants, an observation frequently made with RNA viruses. This first comparison of two FMDV serotypes shows how subtle changes at antigenic sites are sufficient to cause large changes in antigenic specificity between serotypes. © 1994 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract={This review summarizes the results of a study on rotaviruses isolated from calves affected by neonatal diarrhea. The results indicated that rotavirus infection is widespread and supported the evidence for an etiologic role of these viruses in neonatal diarrhea. Differences in virulence among bovine rotaviruses appeared also to be confirmed. Conventionally reared calves were fully susceptible to the experimental infection induced by rotaviruses originating from heterologous hosts, i.e. monkeys, pigs and rabbits. When rotavirus strains of bovine, simian and rabbit origin were compared by cross neutralization tests, it was found the simian and porcine strains were indistinguishable and both appeared to relate antigenically to the bovine strain. Finally, it was proven that feeding newborn calves with colostrum and first milk of their dams, previously vaccinated with an inactivated adjuvanted rotavirus vaccine, could prevent the neonatal diarrhea from occurring. © 1994.},

abstract={Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against various subclasses of immunoglobulin molecules are important reagents for the characterization and differentiation of serum immunoglobulins (Ig) generated during immune responses. Furthermore, Ig‐specific mAbs can be powerful tools for the detection of B lymphocytes in blood and lymphoid organs. Here we describe two mAbs generated in our laboratories, named 1G6 and 2E8, which react with distinct epitopes on porcine immunoglobulin molecules. MAb 1G6 recognizes an epitope of an immunoglobulin chain with apparent molecular mass of 25 Kd. This chain represents an immunoglobulin light chain and might be the porcine equivalent of the murine and human kappa chain. MAb 2E8 is directed against porcine IgM molecules, recognizing an epitope of the porcine μ chain. The use of these mAbs was shown to avoid some common disadvantages of anti‐Ig polyclonal antisera, like the high background staining of cells and tissue culture sections in immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, the use of these mAbs in two‐color flow cytometry (FCM) versus a polyclonal anti‐porcine Ig antiserum enables distinct B‐lymphocyte subpopulations in blood and lymphoid organs to be detected. Our mAbs seem therefore to represent important and powerful reagents to identify and characterize porcine Ig isotypes and surface‐Ig positive porcine B lymphocytes; their discriminating power between distinct B lymphocyte subpopulations could prove useful in different fields of both applied and fundamental immunological research. © 1993 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Nearly 150 strains of Bifidobacterium globosum were isolated from faeces of calf, chicken, lamb, rabbit and rat, from sewage, from rumen content and from human infant faeces between 1962 and 1973 and scored by SDS-PAGE for the presence of cell-wall-related proteins, i.e. BIFOP (bifid outer proteins); their apparent molecular masses ranged from 94.5 to 34 kDa and were designated A to L. Purified preparations from six of these ten proteins were employed to produce polyclonal rabbit antisera for use in immunoblots to investigate the interrelationships of the major antigens, A, B and C (94.5-85.5 kDa) and their distribution in strains of various origin. Two antigens differently migrating (or polymorphic forms) reacted with anti-BIFOP F serum (called F- and F+); the identity of BIFOP E with respect to these antigens was studied with anti-E serum. Only one antigen in all strain preparations reacted to anti-BIFOP H serum, which was raised against an antigen purified from a 13.5-MDa plasmid-bearing strain from rumen. © 1993.},

The vaccine, which was designated as Romovac 50, when injected into cows in their last month of pregnancy, proved to be as effective as the traditional vaccine prepared with Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Thus, the incidence of the naturally occurring neonatal diarrhoea was significantly reduced in calves which were fed mammary secretion from their vaccinated dams, compared to the calves delivered from the unvaccinated cows. Romovac 50 also has the advantages over the traditional Freund's adjuvanted vaccine in that it is less viscous and thus more readily injected and less irritant to tissues. © 1993.},

abstract={The lapinized chinese (LC) strain of hog cholera virus (HCV), was adapted to grow in a cell line from minipig kidney (MPK) where it reached a titer, as determined by immunofluorescence, significantly higher than in rabbits. Inasmuch as the immune serum to HCV neutralized the culture-adapted virus, it was concluded that its antigenicity did not undergo any change after adaptation to MPK cells. The MPK-LC adapted virus (MPK-LC-HCV) showed also a higher immunogenic activity in rabbits, in comparison with the original LC virus. The MPK-LC-HCV protected pigs against challenge infection with virulent HCV. Thus, the vaccinated pigs did not show any clinical signs of disease, nor have they been responsible of virus shedding after they were exposed to the challenge infection 1 month or 6 and 11 months later. All vaccinated pigs seroconverted after vaccination and the antibody titers were on the same range of those reported in pigs vaccinated with the traditional vaccine prepared in rabbits. In the same pigs the antibody concentration underwent a booster effect following challenge infection. It was suggested the MPK-LC-HCV vaccine as an alternative product that might be used to prevent HCV infection. © 1992.},

abstract={The objective of this study was to verify whether a mixed infection in calves with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and other bovine viruses, such as bovid herpesvirus-4 (BHV-4), parainfluenza-3 (PI-3) and infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) virus, would influence the pathogenesis of the BVDV infection sufficiently to result in the typical form of mucosal disease being produced. Accordingly, two experiments were undertaken. In one experiment calves were first infected with BVDV and subsequently with BHV-4 and IBR virus, respectively. The second experiment consisted in a simultaneous infection of calves with BVDV and PI-3 virus or BVDV and IBR virus. From the first experiment it seems that BVDV infection can be reactivated in calves by BHV-4 and IBR virus. Evidence of this is that BVDV, at least the cytopathic (CP) strain, was recovered from calves following superinfection. Moreover, following such superinfection the calves showed signs which could most likely be ascribed to the pathogenetic activity of BVDV. Superinfection, especially by IBR virus, created a more severe clinical response in calves that were initially infected with CP BVDV, than in those previously given the non-cytopathic (NCP) biotype of the virus. Simultaneous infection with PI-3 virus did not seem to modify to any significant extent the pathogenesis of the experimentally induced BVDV infection whereas a severe clinical response was observed in calves when simultaneous infection was made with BVDV and IBR virus. © 1992.},

abstract={Development of methods for the diagnosis of viral haemorrhagic disease and the European brown hare syndrome has proceeded at a steady pace over the last few years. The studies conducted by the authors demonstrate that, like VHDV, EBHSV is a calicivirus. The degree of correlation between the two viruses is a key question both for understanding their biology and interpreting the diagnostic results. A discussion of the similarities and differences between VHD and EBHS is followed by the presentation of the latest antigenic correlation results of the two viruses. Considering the absence of culture procedures to isolate either virus, the diagnostic methods discussed in this review are the haemagglutination (HA) test, immune electron microscopy (IEM) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for virus detection, and the haemagglutination inhibition test (HI) and ELISA for antibody detection. The major obstacles, especially for the diagnosis of EBHS, are described; these are represented by morphological, structural and antigenic modifications due to proteolytic degradation. A differential diagnostic method for the two diseases, based on MAb ELISA, is presented. A final conclusion, drawn from the epidemiological analysis of the virological and serological data, is that EBHS and VHD should be considered as two distinct diseases, each caused by its own aetiological agent.},

Serological results can be worked out as single titres (to be compared with a pre-determined threshold level) or as mean antibody titres induced by different vaccine dilutions. However, the assessment of FMDV-specific antibody titres would not fully depict the extent and the efficacy of the immune response of cattle; moreover, the antibody response would not be proportional if potent vaccines are used (≥ 10-12 PD 50 ). Thus, a particular approach is suggested for the serological procedures, which enable credible estimates of potent FMD vaccines to be formulated. © 1991.},

abstract={Two field trials were undertaken to evaluate specific vaccines and Biological Response Modifiers (B.R.M.) with regard to disease control of beef cattle. Clinical data and laboratory results strongly suggested a genetically determined resistance to transportation stress of some cattle breeds, with possible important consequences on the occurrence of multi‐factor diseases. Plenty of calves showed detectable levels of serum interferon and a remarkable activation of at least some lymphocyte populations in the first days after arrival. In general, B.R.M.‐treated cattle could better react against environmental pathogens, as evidenced by both clinical and laboratory findings. Several data emerged that even the efficacy of specific vaccines could be largely accounted for by a positive modulation of non‐specific immunity; this latter feature can be mainly referred to adjuvants and/or some bacterial antigens. © 1991 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={This article summarizes the results of a study on several strains of Bovid herpesvirus-4 (BHV-4), isolated from cattle. The study had several objectives, namely, to verify (a) the disease-causing potential of the virus, (b) the possibility by BHV-4 to induce a latent infection in the natural host and (c) the entity of the relationships among strains of the virus isolated from different disease syndromes. The following data were obtained: (1) All strains tested were able to replicate in experimentally infected calves; however, only one strain (85/BH 16TV) caused an overt systemic disease. (2) The nervous system as well as the lymphoid structures appeared to be the target organs for replication of the virus. (3) BHV-4, like other herpesviruses, was able to establish latent infection in cattle. (4) When two strains of the virus, isolated from cattle affected by different disease syndromes, i.e. respiratory disease (strain DN-599) or vulvovaginitis (strain 85/BH 16TV), respectively, they resulted to be closely related to each other. In particular, they revealed a similar DNA pattern and both strains were able to cause respiratory disease in calves. Moreover, the two viral strains were mutually protective in that calves were generally found to be refractory to challenge inoculation with either the homologous or the heterologous virus. (5) All BHV-4 strains tested generally failed to evoke a significant production of neutralizing antibody in the experimental calves. © 1991.},

abstract={The susceptibility of two established cell lines of pig (MPK = minipig kidney) and rabbit (RK13 = rabbit kidney) origin to the lapinized Chinese (LC) strain of hog cholera virus (HCV) was studied. Spleen cells from rabbits infected with the virus under study were inoculated to cell cultures of either MPK and RK13 cells and subsequent passages were made by culturing the trypsinized infected cells with the normal cells. Only the MPK cell line appeared to be susceptible to virus replication. Since no cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed, the presence of the viral antigen in the inoculated cultures was detected by immunofluorescence tests. The virulence of the virus for rabbits was enhanced after its cultivation in MPK cell cultures. When the MPK cell culture system adapted virus was tested in neutralization trials in the presence of an HCV reference immune serum it was found that the virus did not modify its antigenic structure in any extent. Finally, the culture adapted virus appeared to be more immunogenic for rabbits than the original rabbits adapted virus. Based on these results, it seems reasonable to suggest the use of MPK cell line for the propagation of the LC strain of HCV as an alternative to the use of rabbits for the preparation of HCV vaccine.},

abstract={Two strains of Bovid herepesvirus-4 (BHV-4), i.e. the prototype strain DN-599, obtained from a steer suffering of a respiratory disease, and the strain 85/BH 16TV, originated from a cow with vulvovaginitis, were compared in studies which included restriction endonuclease analysis, experimental infection and reciprocal cross protection tests. The restriction endonuclease analysis revealed that the resultant DNA patterns of the isolates were generally similar with only a difference in one fragment. The two strains were capable of causing respiratory tract infection in calves, even if they displayed a different level of virulence: the strain 85/BH 16TV being the most virulent while the strain DN-599 the least. The two viral strains were mutually protective in that the calves were generally found to be refractory to challenge inoculation with either the homologous or the heterologous virus. Finally, both viral strains failed to evoke the production of neutralizing antibody in the experimental calves. © 1988.},

abstract={This presentation summarizes the results of a comprehensive study on rotaviruses isolated in Italy from calves and rabbits affected by neonatal diarrhea. The results clearly indicated that rotavirus infection is widespread and supported the evidence for an etiologic role of these viruses in neonatal diarrhea. The evidence of differences in virulence among bovine rotaviruses appeared also to be confirmed. Conventionally reared calves were fully susceptible to the experimental infection induced by three rotaviruses originating from heterologous hosts, i.e. monkeys, pigs and rabbits, respectively. When rotavirus strains of bovine, simian, porcine and rabbit origin were compared by cross neutralization tests, it was found the simian and porcine strains were indistinguishable and both appeared to relate antigenically to the bovine strain. On the other hand, a reciprocal antigenic correlation was found between bovine and rabbit isolates. Finally, it was proven that feeding newborn calves with colostrum of their dams, previously vaccinated with an inactivated rotavirus vaccine, could prevent the neonatal diarrhea from occurring. © 1988.},

abstract={Field trials were conducted using an inactivated rotavirus vaccine for prevention of calf neonatal diarrhea. For the trials, 458 pregnant cows from 26 herds were involved. In each herd, cows which had been inseminated within a period of two months were selected and randomly subdivided in two groups. Cows in one group (248 head in total) were vaccinated 6 weeks before calving and again 4 weeks later; cows in the other group (210 head in total) were left as unvaccinated controls. At calving, colostrum was collected from each cow and stored at -30°C until used for feeding calves. The newborn calves, beginning the second day of life and for the next 7-10 consecutive days, each was fed a daily supplement of 400 ml of colostrum from its dam. The diarrhea occurred in 86 (40.9%) calves that had received colostrum from unvaccinated dams (normal colostrum), and in 7 (2.8%) calves which were fed colostrum from vaccinated dams (immune colostrum). The disease was very severe in the normal colostrum-fed calves and 52 of them died. Those calves which survived the disease underwent a significant loss of condition. By contrast, the 7 immune colostrum-fed calves displayed a rather mild enteric condition, and all recovered without any sequela being observed. © 1987 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract={The time‐course of experimental Foot‐and‐Mouth Disease in six non‐immune heifers after contact exposure was followed and some humoral and cellular parameters were assessed. Considerable viral replication, with interferon production, in the upper respiratory tract was detected in the first days post‐infection in the absence of any evident vesicular lesion. Virus and interferon regularly appeared in the blood a few days later. A decrease of the opsono‐phagocytic activity of adherent cells from peripheral blood leucocytes was observed in all heifers. The kinetics of antibody production clearly differed from that of intradermolingually infected cattle, with interesting features related to IgM and IgG isotypes. Bestimmung humoraler und zellulärer Parameter bei experimentell mit Maul‐ und Klauenseuche‐Virus infizierten Färsen Bei 6 nicht immunen Färsen wurden der klinische Verlauf sowie einige humorale und zelluläre Immunparameter nach experimenteller Maul‐ und Klauenseuche‐Virusinfektion mit Kontaktexposition untersucht. In den ersten Tagen nach der Infektion wurde eine erhebliche Virusvermehrung, einhergehend mit Interferonproduktion im oberen Respirationstrakt festgestellt, ohne daß vesikuläre Läsionen auftraten. Virus und Interferon waren gewöhnlich ein paar Tage später auch im Blut nachweisbar. Eine Abnahme in der opsonierend‐phagozytierenden Aktivität adhärenter Zellen aus den peripheren Blutleukozyten wurde bei allen Färsen beobachtet.

A glycosylated protein was essential for activity in bovine cells, but not in swine cells. Poly I:C proved to be a very weak inducer, even in conditions which promote IFN synthesis in other cell substrata. β IFN from secondary pig kidney cells was very effective against Swine Vesicular Disease Virus (SVDV), whereas no activity was detected against porcine Rotavirus; Aujeszky's disease virus, BUK strain, proved to be of intermediate sensitivity.

abstract={Fourteen calves were inoculated intranasally with 5 strains of Bovid herpesvirus‐4 (BHV‐4). Of the 5 strains (85/BH 16 TV, 85/BH 17 TV, 85/BH 18 TV, 85/BH 231 TN, 85/BH 232 TN) tested, only one (85/BH 16 TV) induced a clinical condition in calves. However, virus was consistently isolated from the nasal swabs of all calves, irrespective of the virus inoculated, up to 10 days after the infection. Nasal swabs taken on postinfection days (PID) 30 and 90 were negative for virus. Virus was recovered from nerve tissues of calves that were infected with 85/BH 16 TV or 85/BH 232 TN strains and were killed on PID 4 or 8. Virus was also isolated from other tissues, such as lymph nodes and nasal mucosa (PID 8), lung and spleen (PID 4). Three months after the infection, two calves were given 85/BH 16 TV and three that received 85/BH 232 TN strains were subjected to dexamethasone treatment. Dexamethasone did not induce any clinical signs of disease but BHV‐4 was isolated from nasal swabs obtained from all the calves and also from the tissues of 4 of 5 calves that were killed. Studium der Pathogenese von bovinen Herpesvirus‐4‐Infektionen bei Kälbern Vierzehn Kälber wurden experimentell mit bovinem Herpesvirus Typ 4 (BHV‐4) intranasal infiziert (Stamm 85/BH 16 TV, 85/BH 17 TV, 85/BH 18 TV, 85/BH 231 TN, 85/BH 232 TN). Lediglich der Stamm 85/BH 16 TV löste klinische Erscheinungen aus. Eine Virusausscheidung im Nasensekret war jedoch bei allen Stämmen bis zum zehnten Tag nach Versuchsbeginn erfolgreich.

abstract={Experimental infection tests were carried out in calves with 5 strains of Bovid herpesvirus-4. Fourteen calves were inoculated intranasally (i.n.) with the viral isolates as follows: 5 with 85/BH 16TV, 1 with 85/BH 17TV, 1 with 85/BH 18TV, 2 with 85/BH 231TN and 5 with 85/BH 232TN. Strain 85/BH 16TV was the only one which caused overt respiratory-like disease in all inoculated calves. Onset of the disease was observed after 7-8 days of incubation and was characterized by fever, depression, nasal discharge and coughing. Virus was isolated from the nasal swabbings of calves obtained from post-infection day (PID) 2-10. The other viral strains did not cause any sign of disease although virus was isolated regularly from the nasal swabbings of the inoculated calves. Virus was recovered from central nervous system tissues of calves that were infected with 85/BH 16TV or 85/BH 232TN strains and were killed on PID 4 or 8. Virus was also isolated from other tissues, such as lymph node, nasal mucosa (PID 8), or lung (PID 4). It was speculated that the nervous system could be one of the target areas of the virus in the naturally occurring infection by BHV-4. This might indicate a possible role of the nervous system (site of latency?) in the pathogenesis of BHV-4 as is the case in certain herpesviral infections of man and the lower animals. © 1987.},

Besides the serologic aspects, the three isolates appeared to share common biological, physical and morphological properties with the newly recognized bovine herpesviruses, of which DN-599 is a representative strain. © 1986.},

abstract={Three rotavirus strains of bovine, simian and porcine origin, respectively, were compared. The 3 viruses induced a classic rotavirul infection in newborn, conventionally reared calves. The cross neutralization tests revealed an antigenic identity of simian and porcine rotaviruses and a slight serologic correlation of these two viruses with the bovine rotavirus strain. However, in reciprocal cross protection tests carried out in calves, the simian rotavirus antiserum afforded weak protection to challenge infection with either the porcine or the bovine viruses. By contrast, the protective level of the bovine and the porcine rotavirus antisera was relatively high. It was speculated that the 81/36F bovine rotavirus could be considered, tentatively, as an antigenic reassortant rotavirus strain. © 1985 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

The virus titers obtained in the three culture systems under study did not differ significantly from those of pBEK cells. Moreover, the growth curve study demonstrated that the pCT cells, as well as the two cell lines, were similar to the pBEK cultures in their susceptibility to the virus. Accordingly, it appeared reasonable to conclude that pCT, EBTr and IMR-31 cell cultures possess the general requirements for use in studies on the BVD virus. However, inasmuch as the cytopathic effects (CPE) produced by the EBTr and the IMR-31 cell lines did not display any distinctive characteristics typical of BVD virus-induced CPE, it is recommended that the two cell lines be not used for isolation of the virus from specimen material.},

Two alternatives were considered feasible in improving prophylaxis for rotavirus infections: (a) the continuous feeding of calves with 1st day colostrum as part of the ration throughout the period of greatest risk (first week of life), or (b) enhancing the efficacy of the vaccine in pregnant cows to the point where antibody concentration in the milk would remain at a protective level. © 1984.},

abstract={Nine cytopathic bovine rotavirus strains were isolated in MA-104 cell cultures from fecal specimens of dairy calves suffering from diarrhea. Isolation of the virus was accomplished from three outbreaks which occurred on dairy farms located in Central and Southern Italy. Fecal suspensions were treated with a high concentration (1000 μg/ml) of trypsin, and inoculated into MA-104 cell cultures grown out in Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 5 μg/ml of the enzyme. Cytopathic effects (CPE), characterized by intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies of different sizes and shapes, were observed on the 1st passage with five of the strains and on the 2nd (2 strains) or the 3rd (2 strains) passage for the others. The presence of trypsin and the use of MA-104 cells appeared to be essential for the occurrence of CPE, inasmuch as no CPE was detected when trypsin was omitted in the MA-104 cell system. Replication failed to occur when primary bovine embryo kidney cell cultures with or without trypsin were used. Electron microscopy revealed the presence of particles with a typical rotavirus morphology. In MA-104 cells, the titre of virus reached its maximum 48 hr after inoculation. Small, clear-cut plaques were produced by the isolates in MA-104 cells under the overlay of MEM containing carboxymethylecellulose, trypsin and DEAE-dextran. The nine rotavirus strains were antigenically related, whereas the relationship to either the Nebraska or the Compton rotaviruses was quite weak. © 1983.},

abstract={Two experiments were carried out to determine whether Bovid herpsvirus (BHV) 2 is able to induce a recurrent infection in experimentally infected calves. In the first experiment the stress induced by dexamethasone (DMS) treatment failed to reactivate the clinical condition or to induce shedding of BHV2. However, treatment with DMS reactivated a latent BHV1 infection in all calves previously inoculated with BHV2 and also in two noninoculated controls. Probably, because of the interference by BHV1 the study failed to resolve the question as to whether BHV2 could induce a recurrent infection. Consequently, a second experiment was performed using calves devoid of antibody to BHV1 and, therefore, probably, free of virus. By this study it was demonstrated that BHV2 can remain as a latent infection in cattle, which, when immunosuppressed as with DMS, can be reactivated. A finding of considerable interest in this experiment was that in 1 calf a concurrent piroplasma infection was also, unexpectedly, discovered. Recrudescence of latent BHV1 infection was induced by DMS treatment of calves possessing antibody to the virus. The infection once reactivated, was readly transmitted by contact to three other calves devoid of antibody to BHV1. In the same experiment Parainfluenza-3 (PI-3) virus was unexpectedly isolated from all calves. It was speculated that all calves were latently infected with PI-3 virus with concurrent infection by BHV1 acting as a stress inducing PI-3 reactivation. These studies seem to indicate that mixed infections could have an important role in the mechanism involved in the establishment of latent infections and viral reactivation. © 1983.},

Calves were infected orally, using 3 calves for each isolate. All became febrile, were depressed and diarrhoeic. Two calves, one of which in the group of those infected with 81/36F isolate, and the other infected with strain 81/40F, were killed when moribund. A 3rd calf from the 81/36F infected group, died. At necropsy localized lesions of the small intestines, which are considered to be typical of rotavirus infection, were found. Virus was consistently isolated from the fecal samples of the inoculated calves up to 13 days post-inoculation. It was speculated that some differences existed in the virulence of the bovine rotaviruses tested. The cross protection tests revealed that 1 strain (81/36F) might be antigenically more complex than the others. © 1983.},

The cytopathic effects induced by the two viruses were rather inconsistent, based on observations of unstained preparations. On the other hand, there was no significant difference between the susceptibility of the PBEK cultures and the cell line cultures to infection with either virus on the basis of the lesions detected in stained preparations, and of the growth curve patterns. It is concluded that PBEK cell cultures are more sensitive for isolating IBR or PI-3 viruses than are the AUBEK and MDBK cell lines. However, the latter appear to be satisfactory for studies of these two viruses. © 1981.},

The clinical reponse of HSV preimmunized calves to BHV2 infection was milder than that in the challenge control calves, and the titer of BHV2 underwent a reduction in the preimmunized calves. BHV2 apparently enhanced the immuno-competent system of the preimmunized calves to produce antibody to HSV.

abstract={The potency of a FMD trivalent oil emulsion vaccine was compared in cattle with that of an aluminum hydroxide‐saponin preparation. Immunity was challenged with FMD virus type C 12 weeks post‐vaccination using the Pb50 test. The oil emulsion vaccine was 3.5 time more potent than the aluminum hydroxide‐saponin preparation. The difference in the results was statistically significant. The antibody response against FMD virus type O, A and C, assessed over a 12 weeks observation period, was not significantly different. It appears that the aluminum hydroxide‐saponin vaccine stimulated a more rapid antibody response whereas with the oil emulsion vaccine the response was more persistent and probably at a higher level. Vergleichende Versuche zur Schutzimpfung von Rindern mit MKS‐Vakzinen die Al(OH)3 und Saponin oder Öl‐Emulsion als Adjuvans enthalten Zwei Rindergruppen wurden mit einer MKS‐Al(OH)3‐Saponin‐Vakzine oder mit einer MKS‐Öl‐Emulsion‐Vakzine geimpft. Die Wirksamkeit der Vakzinen wurde mit der Testinfektion und mit dem Serum‐Neutralisationstest geprüft. Die Testinfektion (Pb50 Methode) hat gezeigt, daß 12 Wochen p. vacc. bei der Öl‐Emulsion‐Vakzine in Vergleich zu der Al(OH)3‐Saponin‐Vakzineein bedeutend besserer Impfschutz vorlag. Die neutralisierenden Antikörper wurden vor und zu verschiedenen Zeiten nach der Vakzinierung geprüft. Die Ergebnisse der Neutralisationsteste bis zu 12 Wochen p. vacc. zeigten, daß die Antikörperbildung ihren Höhepunkt mit der Al(OH)3‐Saponin‐Vakzine früher erreichte, die neutralisierenden Antikörper der Öl‐Emulsion‐Vakzine aber längere Zeit p. vacc. anhielten Recherches comparées sur la vaccination de bovins avec des vaccins antiaphteux contenant comme adjuvant Al(OH)3 et saponine ou une émulsion huileuse Deux groupes de bovins ont été vaccinés avec un vaccin anti‐aphteux Al(OH)3‐saponine ou un vaccin anti‐aphteux á émulsion huileuse. L'efficacité des vaccins a été examinée au moyen d'une infection test et avec le séroneutralisation. L'infection‐test (méthode Pb50) a montré 12 semaines après la vaccination une meilleure protection avec le vaccin à émulsion huileuse. Les anticorps neutralisants furent recherchés avant et à plusieurs reprises après la vaccination. Les résultats de la neutralisation montrèrent jusqu'à 12 semaines après la vaccination que la formation des anticorps avait atteint son point culminant plus rapidement avec le vaccin Al(OH)3‐saponine mais que les anticorps neutralisant du vaccin à émulsion huileuse persistaient plus longuement après la vaccination Ensayos comparados sobre la vacunación preventiva de vacunos con vacunas antiaftosas que contienen Al(OH)3 y saponina o emulsión de aceite como adyuvante Se vacunaron dos grupos de reses vacunas, uno con una vacuna antiaftosa con Al(OH)3 y saponina, el otro con una vacuna antiaftosa en emulsión de aceite. Se contrasto la actividad de las vacunas con la infección de prueba y con la prueba de seroneutralización. La infección de prueba (método Pb50) señaló que 12 semanas p. vacc. había una protección vacunal mejor con la vacuna en la emulsión de aceite que con la vacuna a base de Al(OH)3 y saponina.

abstract={Adaptation to the chicken embryo of a vims strain of infectious bursal disease resulted in a reduction in virulence. After 60 passages the strain was attenuated enough to be used as a vaccine. The attenuation proved adequately stable. If given orally in the drinking water, the strain induced the development of neutralising and precipiting antibodies and a strong resitence against the disease.

abstract={Foot‐ and Mouth Disease (FMD) virus was purified by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation. About 100% of infectivity and 60% of CF activity were recovered; the protein content was reduced to 3% of the original protein present. The rate of inactivation of PEG purified virus stored at + 5 °C. and + 25 °C. was faster then for unpurified virus. No detectable alteration of subtype specific antigenic moieties as a consequence of PEG purification was shown by CF cross reaction. FMD vaccines were prepared with PEG purified antigen and the potency and correlated allergies tested in guinea pigs. The process of PEG precipitation of the virus did not appear to influence significantly the antigenic potency of vaccine. Allergies correlated with vaccine components were strongly reduced or disappeared using PEG purified antigenic preparations. Immunologische Aktivität von Maul‐ und Klauenseuche‐Virus gereinigt durch Polyäthylenglykol‐Präzipitation Maul‐ und Klauenseuche‐Virus (MKS) wurde durch Polyäthylenglykol (PEG)‐Präzipitation gereinigt. Dabei blieben etwa 100% der Infektiosität und 60% der Komplementbindungsaktivität erhalten; der Proteinanteil verringerte sich auf 3% des Ausgangsproteins. Die Inaktivierungsrate des gereinigten MKS‐Virus war bei + 5 °C und + 25 °C höher als die von nicht gegereinigtem. Es konnte durch Kreuz‐Komplementbindungsreaktion gezeigt werden, daß eine Alteration spezifischer Antigenanteile von Subtypen als Folge der Präzipitationsreinigung nicht aufgetreten ist. MKS‐Vakzine wurde aus Antigen nach Reinigung durch PEG‐Präzipitation hergestellt. Wirksamkeit und allergische Reaktivität wurden in Meerschweinchen getestet. Die Präzipitationsreinigung hatte keinen Einfluß auf die antigene Wirksamkeit der Vakzine. Allergische Reaktionen, hervorgerufen durch Vakzinekomponenten, waren nach Reinigung durch PEG‐Präzipitation entweder sehr stark zurückgegangen oder vollständig verschwunden. Activité immunologique du virus de la fièvre aphteuse purifié par précipitation avec du polyéthylèneglycol On a purifié le virus de la fièvre aphteuse par précipitation avec du polyéthyleneglycol (PEG). Ce procédé laissa une infectiosité d'environ 100% et une activité de fixation du complément de 60%; la portion protéique fut diminuée à 3% de protéine de sortie. Le degré d'inactivation du virus aphteux purifié fut plus élevé à + 5 °C et à + 25 °C que celui du virus non purifié. On a pu démontrer au moyen de la réaction de fixation du complément croisée qu'il n'est pas intervenu d'altération des parties anti‐géniques spécifiques des sous‐types à la suite d'une purification par précipitation. On a préparé des vaccines anti‐aphteux à partir des antigènes après purification par précipitation avec PEG. On a testé efficacité et réaction allergique chez des cobayes. La purification par précipitation n'a eu aucune influence sur l'effet antigénique des vaccins. Les réactions allergiques dues à des composants du vaccin furent fortement diminuées ou inexistantes après une purification par précipitation avec PEG. Actividad inmunológica del virus aftoso purificado mediante precipitación con polietilenoglicol Virus aftoso (VA) se purificó mediante precipitación con polietilenoglicol (PEG). Así se conservó casi el 100% de la infecciosidad y el 60% de la actividad fijadora del complemento; la parte proteica se redujo al 3% de la proteína inicial. La tasa de inactivación del VA purificado era mayor a + 5 °C y + 25 °C que la del no purificado. Por medio de la reacción de fijación cruzada del complemento se pudo demostrar que no ha surgido una modificación de las partes antigénicas específicas de los subtipos como consecuencia de la purificación por precipitación. La vacuna antiaftosa se elaboró a partir de antígeno tras su purificación con PEG. La actividad y reactividad alérgica se contrastaron en cobayas. La purificación por precipitación no ejerció ningún influjo sobre la actividad antigénica de la vacuna. Las reacciones alérgicas, producidas por componentes de la vacuna, habían disminuido en un grado muy considerable o desaparecieron por completo tras la purificación mediante precipitación con PEG. © 1973 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

Foot‐and‐mouth disease virus was produced in BHK monolayers or deep suspension. Both antigens compared favourably with Frenkel and calf kidney type antigens. 5. In hamsters the carcinogenic capacity of BHK cells was shown by intact viable cells; no carcinogenic reactions were observed with BHK cell‐free extracts, formol‐treated cells, chloroform‐treated cells, or foot‐and‐mouth disease inactivated virus produced from BHK cells. BHK 21‐Zellkulturen zur Maul‐ und Klauenseuche‐Virus‐Produktion im Großmaßstab 1. BHK 21‐Zellen hielten sich in flüssigem Stickstoff zwei Jahre vermehrungsfähig. 2. In einem 150 l‐Gefäß wurden BHK 21‐Zellsuspensionskulturen angesetzt. Hierbei wurde eine Dichte von 2,2–2,5 times 106/ml lebensfähiger Zellen festgestellt. 3. Zellen aus diesen Tiefenkulturen wurden zur Herstellung von Monolayern in Rollflaschen verwendet. 4. MKS‐Virus wurde in BHK‐Monolayer‐ und auch Tiefenkulturen produziert. Beide Antigene ließen sich durchaus mit denen des Frenkel‐bzw. Kalbsnierentyps vergleichen. 5. Bei Hamstern entfalteten nur die unbeschädigten, lebenden BHK‐Zellen eine carcinogene Wirkung. BHK‐zellfreie Extrakte, formol‐ oder chloroformbehandelte Zellen sowie MKS‐Virus aus BHK‐Zellen ließen keine carcinogenen Wirkungen erkennen. Cultures des cellules BHK 21 pour la production sur une grande échelle du virus de la fièvre aphteuse 1. Les cellules BHK 21 restent viables après 2 ans de conservation dans l'azote liquide. 2. Des cultures de cellules BHK 21 en suspension sont préparées dans des récipients de 150 l. On observe une densité de cellules viables de 2,2 à 2,5 times 106/ml. 3. Les cellules de ces cultures profondes sont utilisées pour préparer des “monolayers” en bouteilles rotatives. 4. Le virus de la fièvre aphteuse est produit en BHK‐monolayers ou en culture profonde. Les deux antigènes sont sans autre comparables avec ceux du type Frenkel, resp. rein de veau. 5. Seules les cellules BHK intactes et viables développent leur propriété carcinogène chez le hamster. On n'observe aucun effet carcinogène avec des extraits exempts de cellules BHK, avec des cellules traitées au formol ou au chloroforme et avec le virus de la fièvre aphteuse issu de cellules BHK. Cultivos celulares BHK‐21 para la producción de virus aftoso en escala industrial 1. Las células BHK‐21, conservadas durante 2 años en nitrógeno líquido, mantenían su facultad reproductora. 2. En un recipiente de 150 l de cabida se alojó una suspensión de cultivo de células BHK‐21. Se contrastó una densidad celular viable de 2,2–2,5 times 106/ml. 3. Las células propagadas en estos cultivos de suspensión profunda se emplearon para elaborar capas monoestratificadas en frascos rodantes. 4. El virus aftoso se produjo en capas BHK monoestratificadas y en cultivos de suspensión profunda. Ambos antígenos se pudieron comparar favorablemente con los del tipo Frenkel o del de los riñones de ternera. 5. Solo las células BHK viables intactas desarrollaban una actividad carcinógena en hamsters. Los extractos BHK libres de células, células tratadas con formol o cloroformo y el virus aftoso inactivado procedente de células BHK no permitieron reconocer reacciones carcinógenas. © 1967 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},
