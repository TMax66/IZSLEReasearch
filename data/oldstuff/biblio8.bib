Abstract = {Six calves were given the immunomodulator Baypamun and housed together
   with another six calves of which, three were experimentally infected
   with bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), whereas the remaining three served as
   untreated controls, The three experimentally infected calves as well as
   the three controls developed clinical signs of the typical acute form of
   infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR). Of the calves treated with
   Baypamun, those that had only one injection of the immunomodulator,
   either at the start of the experiment (time 0) or 2 days later,
   underwent a much milder form of IBR and recovered in a shorter time than
   the experimentally infected calves or the controls. The calves that
   received four injections of the immunomodulator, i.e. at time 0 and
   subsequently for the next 3 days, remained healthy throughout the 30
   days of observation. Moreover, the virus shedding by the Baypamun
   treated calves was significantly reduced. It was speculated that the use
   of an immunomodulator, eventually associated with a vaccination
   programme, would be a feasible approach to reduce significantly the
   onset of outbreaks of BHV-1, one of the main infectious agent initiating
   the respiratory disease in cattle. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {The in vitro antiproliferative activity and in vivo phototoxicity of
   some methyl derivatives of 5-methoxypsoralen and 5-methoxyangelicin,
   i.e. 4,4'-dimethyl-5-methoxyangelicin (compound I),
   3,4'-dimethyl-5-methoxyangelicin (compound II),
   4,4'-dimethyl-5-methoxypsoralen (compound III); and
   3,4'-dimethyl-5-methoxypsoralen (compound IV). have been investigated.
   The effects of the compounds a ere evaluated in vitro on HL60 and A431
   cells, using 5-methoxypsoralen as the reference compound. In both cell
   lines compound I, II and III showed better antiproliferative activity
   than compound IV and 5-methoxypsoralen. Scanning electron microscopy
   revealed that all the compounds induced the formation of blebs and
   blisters on A431 cell surface. Significant variations in the nuclear
   area strictly related to the toxicity of the compounds have been shown
   in both cell lines. Skin irritancy in vivo was evaluated by mean of
   histopathological responses on guinea-pig skin. For each compound a
   damage index was determined by morphometrical analysis of empty spaces
   in the epidermis. Histopathology revealed skin phototoxicity of
   compounds which lacked erythemogenic activity by visual scoring. By
   coupling cytotoxicity data in vitro to skin sensitization ones in vivo,
   compound I proved a promising candidate for use in clinical trials since
   due to a high inhibitory effect on the growth of human cell lines
   coupled to low skin phototoxicity.},

Abstract = {The PCR technique was applied to the diagnosis of tuberculosis in live
   cattle, and both skin-test-negative and skin-test-positive animals were
   studied, DNA was taken from various sources including specimens of lymph
   node aspirates, milk, and nasal swabs, After slaughter and visual
   inspection, tissues such as lymph nodes, lungs, and udders from
   tuberculin reactors were tested by the same technique, Specific
   oligonucleotide primers internal to the IS6110 insertion element were
   used to amplify a 580-bp fragment, A 182-bp fragment was obtained by
   designating a nested PCR from the first amplification product, This
   fragment was cloned and sequenced, and after being labeled it was
   employed in dot blot hybridization, A total of 100 cattle were tested,
   and PCR analysis was performed using nasal swab, milk, and lymph node
   aspirate, Sixty skin-test-positive cows were also tested to detect
   mycobacterial DNA in tissue samples from lymph nodes, lungs, and udders,
   and the infection was confirmed in all of the animals, Using PCR
   analysis of tissue samples from slaughtered animals as a ``gold
   standard{''} we calculated 100\% values for sensitivity, specificity,
   and positive and negative predictive values for milk and lymph node
   aspirate samples, The respective values for nasal swab samples were 58,
   100, 100, and 28\%, The respective values for all of the samples were
   74, 100, 100, and 35\%, while for visual inspection the values were 81,
   100, 100, and 58\%, respectively, PCR analysis of specimens of lymph
   node aspirates, milk, and nasal swabs from skin-test-negative animals
   showed that 52\% of these skin test results were false negatives, These
   animals, not being removed from the farms, represent a potential source
   of further infection.},

Abstract = {Papillomatous lesions were isolated from the mammary skin of goats and
   examined for evidence of papillomavirus (PV) infection by various
   criteria, including gross morphology, histology and DNA hybridization.
   Although some lesions showed gross papillomatous morphological and
   histological features similar to those caused by papillomavirus in other
   species, no viral particles were detected. Reverse slot hybridization
   revealed cross-hybridization between DNA extracted from goat mammary
   papillomas and human papillomaviruses (HPV). Southern blot, using ovine
   papillomavirus (OPV) and bovine papillomavirus type 5 (BPV 5) DNA probes
   under conditions of reduced stringency (Tm -40 degrees C), detected
   homologous sequences in 40\% of the biopsies.;DNA fragments
   corresponding probably to a monomeric form (7000-8000bp) of an unknown
   papillomavirus genome were detected. This study provides evidence for
   the existence of papillomavirus-like sequences in caprine mammary
   papillomas and suggests that a papillomavirus is likely to be involved
   in the development of precancerous lesions of goat mammary skin. (C)

Volume = {36},

Abstract = {Two flow cytometric assays are described herein. The single cytometric
   test (SCT) detects antibodies to either Brucella abortus or
   Staphylococcus aureus in the serum or milk of a cow or water buffalo.
   The double cytometric test (DCT) detects both anti-B. abortus and
   anti-S. aureus antibodies concurrently. In the SCT, the sample to be
   tested is incubated in succession with the antigen (either B. abortus or
   S. aureus) and the proper secondary antiserum (fluorescein
   isothiocyanate-labelled rabbit anti-cow immunoglobulin antiserum or
   rabbit anti-water buffalo immunoglobulin antiserum). In the DCT, the
   sample to be tested is incubated first with B. abortus and S. aureus
   antigens and then with the secondary antiserum. The B. abortus antigen
   used in the DCT is covalently bound to 3-mu m-diameter latex particles.
   The difference in size between B. abortus and S. aureus permits the
   establishment of whether the antibodies are directed against one, the
   other, or both antigens. When compared to the complement fixation test,
   the SCT and DCT each show a specificity and a sensitivity of 100\%. The
   SCT has been used previously to detect anti-S. aureus antibodies. Here
   its use is extended to the detection of anti-B. abortus antibodies. The
   DCT is described here for the first time. The DCT appears to be useful
   for large-scale brucellosis eradication programs. It offers the
   possibility of using one test to identify animals that are serologically
   positive for both B. abortus and S. aureus.},

Volume = {16},

Abstract = {A profiling ELISA was developed to detect antibody to the non-structural
   (NS) proteins Lb, 2C, 3A, 3D, and the polyprotein 3ABC, of
   foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). The assay was used to examine
   panels of sem from naive cattle, and from experimentally infected or
   vaccinated animals. All sera front cattle experimentally infected with
   arty of the seven serotypes of FMDV were positive for antibody to 2C,
   3A, 3D and 3ABC, and the majority were positive for Lb, The three
   categories of sera could be differentiated on the basis of the presence
   or absence of antibody, to the structural and/or NS proteins of FMDV.
   The assay is simple, rapid and reproducible and can be used to identify
   preview infection in animals which are seropositive for antibody to the
   structural proteins of the virus. Validating the assay with field sera
   demonstrated that antibody to 3ABC, and usually one or more of the other
   non-structural proteins, was detected only in animals reported to have
   shown clinical signs of FMD. Vaccinated cattle which had received less
   than five vaccinations, were frequently positive for antibody to 30 but
   were negative for antibody to 3ABC, Occasional animals which had
   received more than ten vaccinations had NS protein antibody profiles
   which were similar to those seen following infection. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {A case-control study was undertaken to provide information about the
   role of some husbandry practices and farm characteristics in the
   epidemioloqy of bovine tuberculosis in the Veneto Region. Twenty-seven
   breeding herds where a positive result to the single intradermal
   cervical tuberculin test was confirmed by post-mortem examination were
   compared with seventy-four herds which had been free of the disease for
   at least three years. Epidemiological information was collected on
   farms. The factors taken into account in the study were chosen on the
   basis of their epidemiological plausibility and of the local livestock
   characteristics. Multiple logistic regression was applied to analyse the
   data. Factors identified as possibly involved in increasing the risk of
   bovine tuberculosis in the Veneto Region were the presence of mixed
   (dairy and beef) enterprises (OR = 4.9, P = 0.001) and of cattle
   purchase (OR = 5.8; P = 0.003). Other factors (such as herd size,
   housing system, summer mountain pasture, possible contact with wild
   animals, and indirect contacts with other herds) did not appear to
   significantly contribute to tuberculosis presence in this area. The
   results of this case-control study support the hypothesis that in the
   Veneto Region bovine tuberculosis infection is still associated with
   classical risk factors both (directly or indirectly) related to cattle
   movements. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Abstract = {To study the effects of dietary crude protein (CP) and energy on milk
   urea N concentrations in dairy sheep, eight pelleted total mixed rations
   were prepared to obtain two levels of energy density (1.65 and 1.55 Mcal
   of net energy for lactation per kilogram of dry matter for high energy
   and low energy rations, respectively) and four concentrations of CP
   within each energy level (mean CP concentrations, 14.0, 16.4, 18.7, and
   21.2\% of dry matter). The experimental design consisted of two 4 x 4
   Latin squares (one per energy level) with two replications per treatment
   within each 3-wk period. Milk urea N concentrations were similar between
   dietary energy levels. Within each energy level, milk urea N was
   linearly and positively associated with dietary CP content and intake
   (range of milk urea N concentrations, 12.2 to 25.8 mg/dl for ewes fed
   high energy rations and 12.9 to 26.7 mg/dl for ewes fed low energy
   rations). The comparison of these results with those from other trials
   suggested that milk and blood urea N concentrations are closely
   correlated with dietary CP concentrations and less closely correlated
   with dietary CP intake. Our results suggest that milk or blood urea N
   concentrations can be used as indicators of protein metabolism and
   intake of lactating ewes.},

Volume = {53},

Abstract = {In recent years in vitro models have been developed to avoid the use of
   animals in cutaneous toxicological studies. Submerged human keratinocyte
   cultures in vitro could be so far employed as an alternative to animal
   testing and a good correlation between skin irritation and cytotoxicity
   has been demonstrated. Nevertheless, these submerged cultures are
   lacking in the stratum corneum which acts as a barrier to chemical
   toxicity, so that this type of culture is far from the in vivo
   situation. A better alternative method seems to be the use of in vitro
   reconstructed skin at the air-liquid interface that closely resembles
   the in vivo Situation. In this work, in a first step we have
   characterized human epidermis reconstructed in vitro on de-epidermized
   derma (DED) after a two-week air exposure. Human skin reconstituted in
   vitro on DED was histologically similar to the in vivo skin. A
   stratified epidermis including the stratum corneum was obtained. The
   presence of basal lamina as well as of various important markers for
   epidermal differentiation (involucrin, K10 keratin, and filaggrin) were
   revealed. In a second step we have tested the cytotoxic and
   morphological effects of four surfactants on our model. A good rank
   correlation has been shown to exist between the irritation potency of
   surfactants on our model and reported ocular irritancy in vivo. From our
   results, in vitro reconstituted human skin could represent an attractive
   model for irritancy testing and could be an in vitro replacement for
   animal testing. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was developed for the

   procedure based on freeze and thaw steps which allow the release of
   bacterial DNA directly into the Food matrix, so that extraction and
   purification of DNA from bacteria is not required.
   The template DNA collected in the medium was amplified by using two
   oligonucleotides homologous to the regions of the gene coding for a
   31kDa outer membrane protein characteristic of the genus Brucella.
   The amplification products were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis.
   This method seems to be a suitable diagnostic test thanks to the
   specificity and speed features showed.},

   havana, were successfully treated with enrofloxacin. From two groups of
   healthy 3- to 4-wk-old eagle owls, Salmonella sp. group 61 (61:r:-) and
   S. havana were collected. A strain of S. paratyphi B was detected in a
   pharyngeal swab and a fecal sample from an adult female goshawk
   (Accipiter gentilis), affected with pharyngeal trichomoniasis. A S.
   hadar strain was collected from a healthy 1-yr-old female eagle owl and
   S. livingstone was isolated from a 1-mo-old female peregrine, dead of an
   acute respiratory syndrome. Lesions of fibrinous polyserositis and

   which adult and young raptors were fed, S. havana and S. livingstone
   isolates with similar biochemical and drug susceptibility patterns to
   those isolated from raptors were identified. A surveillance program on
   infectious diseases reduced embryonic and neonatal death rates in the

Abstract = {We conducted a serological survey on 176 rabbits for anti-Rabbit
   Hemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV) antibodies, in an industrial rabbitry.
   We identified at calicivirus, provisionally called Rabbit Calicivirus
   (RCV), antigenically related to RHDV but without its pathogenicity. In
   particular, we observed: 1) a seroprevalence of 22.7\% among young
   animals at weaning (31 days old); 2) a rapid increase in positive
   rabbits during their fattening period: 25\% at 5-7dd post weaning
   (p.w.), 55.6\% at 13-14dd p.w., 87.5\% at 19-20dd p.w., 100\% at 32-33dd
   p.w.; 3) all breeders were seropositive, 10\% had a high titre
   (1/640-1/1280). In the latter and in young at weaning. the antibodies
   were class IgG. In animals at 13-14dd p.w. they were however classes IgM
   and IgA. In older fattening rabbits, a decrease of IgM and IgA and a
   contemporary increase of IgG confirmed seroconversion without any
   specific RHD symptoms. We isolated and characterised the RCV using
   RT-PCR and Western Blotting in the proximal intestine of 6 days p.w.
   rabbits. During two separate experimental trials, we inoculated 2 month
   old rabbits and hares with intestinal extracts containing RCV, and
   succeeded in: 1) reisolated RCV in the intestine of rabbits killed 3
   days post infection (p.i.); 2) observed seroconversion from 4 days p.i.
   3) demonstrated the acquired resistance against RHDV; 4) excluded the
   susceptibility of hares to the infection. Finally we have discussed the
   epidemiology of the natural RCV infection in the rabbitry and future
   implications of the identification of such an non pathogenic virus.},

   Semen samples were collected twice a week using an artificial vagina.
   The rabbits in the positive control group transmitted the virus through
   the semen for a long time and eventually all died. The vaccinated and
   successively infected rabbits overcame the infection unharmed and five
   of the six transmitted the virus through the semen. The presence of the
   virus in the seminal liquid of vaccinated rabbits and of the control was
   shown by biological tests and infection of cell cultures. The
   transmission of Myxomatosis virus through the semen, even in vaccinated
   rabbits, represents a serious risk factor in the practice of artificial

Abstract = {On the basis of EEC and Italian laws 3 slaughterhouses and 37 rabbit
   farms have been monitored in Veneto Region. Monitoring consisted in
   performing serological and bacteriological tests on samples collected
   from slaughtered animals, coming from different farms. These zoonosis
   have been monitored: Toxoplasmosis, Chlamydiosis, Salmonellosis,
   Listeriosis, Staphylococci and E. coli infection and Dermatomycosis.
   Slaughterhouse monitoring gave positive results for each disease, with
   prevalence rates varying from 5,4\% (Salmonella) to 97,2\%
   (coagulase-positive Staphylococci). Environmental monitoring of Ei farms
   that had previously resulted positive, showed a very high frequency of
   Staphylococcosis and Dermatomycosis.},

Abstract = {We made a seroepidemiological survey to find the effects of the
   Encephalitozoon cuniculi infection in rabbitries in Northern Italy.
   Initially, 231 sera samples were studied from 11 rabbitries of different
   functional uses: 3 industrial, 1 for laboratory rabbits, 1 reared in
   isolation and 6 rural farms. We found a seroprevalence of 32.5\% in the
   industrial rabbitries, 21.4\% in the rural ones while the laboratory
   rabbits were entirely negative. Subsequently, we looked at how the
   infection developed in one of these industrial farms. with respect to
   the rabbits' age, sex, and location. We studied 690 rabbits and found:
   66.4\% of bucks seropositive (232 sera), 64.9\% of does (302), 41.8\% in
   the age group 90-180 days (141) and 0\% in the fattening group between
   75-80 days (15). There was no statistically significant differences
   between the breeding sexes, breeding sheds, nor between the age of the
   breeding bucks. However the does' positivity varied significantly in
   relation to the number of litters. These data justified an eradication
   programme which has been based on the elimination of seropositive
   subjects and the movement of negative rabbits to a clean environment.},

Abstract = {Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains, isolated from outbreaks during
   epizootics between 1992 and 1996 in Western European countries, were
   compared by restriction enzyme cleavage site mapping of the fusion (F)
   protein gene between nucleotides 334 and 1682 and by sequence analysis
   between nucleotides 47 and 435. Both methods revealed that NDV strains
   responsible for these epizootics belong to two distinct genotypes.
   Strains derived from sporadic cases in Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland and
   Austria were classified into genotype VI {[}6], the same group which
   caused outbreaks in the Middle East and Greece in the late 1960's and in
   Hungary in the early 1980's. In contrast, viruses that caused epizootics
   in Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands, Spain and Italy could be
   classified into a novel genotype (provisionally termed VII), hitherto
   undetected in Europe. It is possible that the genotype VII viruses
   originated in the Far East because they showed a high genetic similarity
   (97\%) to NDV strains isolated from Indonesia in the late 1980's.},

Abstract = {Screening of 43 protein loci was used to evaluate the level of genetic
   variability in 42 red deer Cervus elaphus Linnaeus, 1758 from Mesola
   Wood, the only native population presently occurring in peninsular
   Italy. The survey revealed polymorphism at four loci. In one of them
   evidence was provided for a significant deficiency of heterozygotes.
   Average expected heterozygosity and the proportion of polymorphic loci
   were H-e = 0.025 and P = 0.093, respectively. Although these values are
   low, they are consistent with those reported for other European red deer
   populations. Repeated bottlenecks and slow recoveries along with
   prolonged selective removal of stags were indicated as affecting genetic
   variation as a consequence of random drift. A genetic factor may have
   influenced female fertility and antler conformation. Comparisons with
   free-ranging deer from the Alps, and with an enclosed population yielded
   estimates of absolute (mean Nei's 1972 D = 0.004, SD = 0.002; mean
   modified Rogers' D = 0.063, SD = 0.013) and relative (Wright's F-ST =
   0.094) genetic distance typical for red deer populations. Given the
   biological value of Mesola red deer, genetic results are discussed in
   relation to both population history and conservation. A strategy for
   urgent management interventions is also proposed.},

Abstract = {Protozoa of the genus Leishmania (L.) infect reticuloendothelial cells

   infantum-infected macrophage cultures from 10 healthy dogs, killing
   capacity and nitric oxide (NO) production, in terms of nitrite (NO2-)
   levels. Parallel experiments were performed on macrophages stimulated
   with both Concanavalin A (ConA)-activated PBMC supernatants and
   Salmonella typhimurium lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and in the same
   conditions, but in the presence of the NO synthase inhibitor L-N
   monomethylarginine (L-NMMA). In L. infantum-infected macrophages, nitric
   oxide production was observed at a concentration significantly higher
   after stimulation with both Con A-activated PBMC supernatants and LPS
   than that observed in uninfected cells cultured in medium alone, or
   infected cells unstimulated or stimulated by PBMC supernatants or LPS
   alone, respectively. Moreover, NO production was abolished in the
   presence of the NO synthase inhibitor L-NMMA. Finally, killing of
   Leishmania by macrophages was significantly reduced in the presence of

Abstract = {The Adriatic Sea is a semi-enclosed ecosystem that receives in its
   shallow part, the northern basin, significant freshwater inputs which
   markedly increase its productivity with respect to the oligotrophic
   features of the Mediterranean sea. In this area, especially on the
   western coast where river plumes diffuse, high physical (density) and
   chemical (nutrients) gradients occur on a small scale, both horizontal
   and vertical. Results of bacterial production as H-3-thymidine
   incorporation, bacterial abundance as DAPI direct count, autotrophic
   biomass as chlorophyll a and total biomass as ATP from three areas in
   the Northern Adriatic Sea are reported. The three sites, differently
   influenced by the river water diffusion, were sampled seasonally over
   two days, every 24 h, in four surveys from April 1995 to January 1996.
   Bacterioplankton production, strongly correlated with primary
   production, was extremely high near the coast in low-salinity,
   high-nutrient waters, mostly as an indirect consequence of riverine
   inputs causing an increase in phytoplankton production stimulated by
   physically driven nutrient inputs. In the warm months bacterial activity
   was higher than in cold months. While bacteria abundance did not appear
   related to the salinity gradients, bacterial production (from 0.6 to 372
   pM H-3-thymidine h(-1) incorporated, corresponding to 0.01-8.2 mu g Cl-1
   h(-1)) and the relative generation times (from 0.2 to 35 days) showed a
   high range of values, representing a variety of situations, from
   estuaries to the ocean. The resulting role of the bacterial community in
   the carbon cycle is very consistent, processing amounts of carbon which
   have been estimated as high as the 80\% and the 260\% of those
   synthesized by autotrophs in summer and winter, respectively.},

Abstract = {The three-dimensional structures of the Fab fragment of a neutralizing
   antibody raised against a foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) of
   serotype C-1, alone and complexed to an antigenic peptide representing
   the major antigenic site A (G-H loop of VP1), have been determined. As
   previously seen in a complex of the same antigen with another antibody
   which recognizes a different epitope within antigenic site A, the
   receptor recognition motif Arg-Gly-Asp and some residues from an
   adjacent helix participate directly in the interaction with the
   complementarity-determining regions of the antibody. Remarkably, the
   structures of the two antibodies become more similar upon binding the
   peptide, and both undergo considerable induced fit to accommodate the
   peptide with a similar array of interactions. Furthermore, the pattern
   of reactivities of five additional antibodies with versions of the
   antigenic peptide bearing amino acid replacements suggests a similar
   pattern of interaction of antibodies raised against widely different
   antigens of serotype C. The results reinforce the occurrence of a
   defined antigenic structure at this mobile, exposed antigenic site and
   imply that intratypic antigenic variation of FMDV of serotype C is due
   to subtle structural differences that affect antibody recognition while
   preserving a functional structure for the receptor binding site.},

   Mice trapped inside the farm, that resulted S.typhimurium positive,

   The infection caused, during 20 days, a 40\% mortality among fattening
   rabbits, whereas among does the pregnancy rate decreased from 83,5\% to
   59\% and the abortion rate rose From 2\% to 10 \%.
   Bacteriological examination of muscles and gallbladders gave negative
   results, but the continuous environmental positivity makes further
   investigations in clinically healthy rabbits necessary to identify
   carriers that could contaminate the processing plant.},

Abstract = {The effect of some chemical and anatomical factors on the excystability
   and infectivity in cell culture of sporocysts of Sarcocystis cruzi was
   investigated. A significantly (P < 0.001) higher excystation rate (ER)
   occurred when sodium bicarbonate was added to the excysting fluid at
   concentrations between 0.075 and 0.3 M. Sporocysts collected from
   different dogs had different ER. In contrast, although not uniformly
   distributed along the intestinal lumen, the sporocysts collected from
   the different tracts of the intestine showed similar ER. The period of
   storage did not affect the excystability of the sporocysts; howe ver, it
   influenced the pattern of growth of the sporozoites in cell culture.
   Sporozoites excysted from sporocysts stored for approximately 2 years
   grew slower and produced significantly fewer merozoites compared to

Abstract = {A new ELISA for antibodies against chlamydial abortion of ewes which
   uses detergent solubilised proteins (dsp) of Chlamydia psittaci as
   antigen (Anderson, I.E,I Herring, A.J., Jones, G.E., Low, J.C., Greig,
   A.; 1995. Development and evaluation of an indirect ELISA to detect
   antibodies to abortion strains of Chlamdia psittachi in sheep sera, Vet,
   Microbiol., 43, pp. 1-12] was compared with the complement fixation test
   (CFT) in screening 1000 ovine and caprine sera obtained from selected
   flocks/herds ('flocks') and submitted to a veterinary diagnostic
   laboratory. Fifteen of the 17 `flocks' had a history of abortion while
   the remaining two did not and were classified as `negative flocks'.
   Infection with Chlamydia was confirmed during the study period in five
   `flocks' using direct immunofluorescence and the modified Ziehl Neelsen
   stain on pathological material. The dspELISA and CFT identified 37 and
   45 positive sera on 158 samples tested from these `flocks', Chlamydia
   antibodies were not detected in one of the two negative flocks, in two
   other flocks where the cause of abortion was undetermined and in three
   flocks in which the causes of abortion were diagnosed as Listeriosis
   and/or Salmonellosis. One of the `negative flocks' yielded two positive
   reactors by CFT and five by dspELISA, suggesting infection with a
   cross-reactive subtype of C. pecorum. Of the five `flocks' in which a
   definitive diagnosis from pathological material was not possible, four
   were positive by both serological tests, suggesting that the abortions
   were due to Chlamydia. The fifth flock, though negative by dspELISA and
   marginally positive in two samples by CFT, had experienced confirmed

Abstract = {Routine examination for Trichinella infection by artificial digestion of
   5-g samples of muscle tissue revealed the presence of muscle larvae in
   one out of 28 horses imported from Romania to an abattoir in Italy. The
   parasite, identified as Trichinella spiralis by the polymerase chain
   reaction, showed a reproductive capacity index of 68 in Swiss mice.
   Light microscope examination of 200 nurse cell-larva complexes showed
   that 22\% of them were calcified and that the capsules of the
   non-calcified nurse cells were 17.5-27.5 mu m (s=22.67 mu m) thick and
   had very few cellular infiltrates. The serum samples from the
   parasitologically positive horse and from three other horses of the same
   stock, from which Trichinella larvae were not recovered by digestion,
   showed a low level of positivity as determined by ELISA and Western blot
   analyses using a crude antigen, whereas negative results were observed
   in both tests when an excretory-secretory antigen was used. The results,
   together with data from the literature, suggest that the horse had
   acquired the infection 8-10 months previously and confirm earlier
   observations obtained from experimental infections, which showed that
   muscle worm burden and specific circulating antibodies were lost several
   months after infection. (C) 1997 Australian Society for Parasitology.

Abstract = {Multiple logistic regression was used on serological data collected in
   the context of the Sardinian African swine fever (ASF) eradication
   program from pig farms in the province of Nuoro, Sardinia, The monthly
   percentage of ASFV-positive herds decreased significantly from October
   1994 through March 1996 (P < 0.001). The farm-level risk of
   seropositivity to African swine fever virus (ASFV) was higher in
   free-range farms than in partial-confinement farms (odds ratios (OR)
   varied between 4.9 in October 1994, and 5.7 in March 1996, P < 0.001).
   The risk of infection for total-confinement farms was one-fifth of the
   risk for partial-confinement farms in October 1994 (OR = 0.2, P <
   0.001), whereas in March 1996, the estimated OR was 0.57 and not
   significant (upper confidence limit = 1.1). The maintenance of ASFV in
   Sardinia was primarily associated with free-range pig farms. The natural
   logarithm of the number of pigs tested per visit in a farm was
   positively associated with the risk of herd seropositivity (OR = 2.6, P
   < 0.001). (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Volume = {72},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {An ELISA using antigen produced from merozoites of Sarcocystis cruzi was
   developed to monitor specific IgM and IgG antibody, following challenge
   of cattle with either merozoites or sporocysts of S. cruzi. This assay
   was compared with an ELISA using antigen produced from the cystozoite
   stage of the parasite. Both ELISAs were able to detect significant
   increases in levels of circulating IgM and IgG antibodies against
   Sarcocystis in all challenged cows; however, the magnitude of the titres
   was greater in the ELISA which used the antigen derived from the
   merozoites. This immunoassay also detected increases in the levels of
   IgG earlier than did the assay using antigen derived from cystozoites of
   S. cruzi. Since this rise coincided with the presence of clinical signs,
   and was persistent for several weeks, the IgG-ELISA using antigen
   derived from merozoites appears to be suitable for the diagnosis of
   acute sarcocystiosis in cattle. Furthermore, since significant increases
   in the levels of circulating IgM and IgG antibodies against Sarcocystis
   were detected in the cows infected with merozoites of S. cruzi, it is
   evident that merozoites of S. cruzi cultured in vitro maintain their
   capability to replicate in the natural intermediate host. (C) 1997

Abstract = {Chromium, as trivalent organic form, has been recently proposed as feed
   additive to improve animal welfare and the quality-quantity of meat
   productions. To control its use in animal production we developed an
   analytical method that consisted of sample digestion by a commercially
   available focused microwave system and, subsequently, metal
   determination by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry.
   The mineralization step was performed by treating the samples with a
   nitric acid-sulphuric acid-hydrogen peroxide mixture, Complete sample
   digestion was achieved in 26 min, as compared to 8-12 h or more required
   by dry ashing. To determine method accuracy and precision, we analyzed
   both feeds spiked at different Cr concentrations and a reference plant
   material, We found that mean metal recoveries ranged from 98.7 to
   102.7\% and for the reference material we obtained an excellent
   agreement between calculated and certified value, Quantitative Cr yields
   and relative coefficients of variation between 0.77 and 9.7\% were very
   good and accounted for method accuracy and reliability, Finally, we
   applied the developed method to Cr analysis of some commercial feeds and
   the results were compared with those obtained by dry-ashing procedure.},

Abstract = {The accuracies of two ELISAs, one using antigen from merozoites of S.
   cruzi grown in vitro and the other using antigen from cystozoites of S.
   cruzi, for detecting infection of cattle with Sarcocystis, were
   evaluated by testing the sera of 303 cattle from 36 Western Australian
   herds. The results were compared with those obtained by digestion of
   oesophageal samples collected from the same animals. A similar
   proportion of infected animals were detected by the three methods. The
   sensitivity of the assays for detecting infected cattle was comparable
   (98 and 95\% for the assay using antigen from merozoites and
   cystozoites, respectively), however the specificity (97\%) of the assay
   which used antigen derived from merozoites was significantly higher (P <
   0.001) than that (84\%) which used antigen from cystozoites. When herds
   which had at least five animals sampled were considered, the same
   infected and non-infected herds were detected by the ELISA employing
   antigen from merozoites and the digestion methods (sensitivity and
   specificity of 100\%). The sensitivity and specificity of the assay
   using cystozoite antigen were 100 and 67\%, respectively. The kappa
   values for agreement beyond chance between the two ELISAs were
   calculated as 78\% for the animal-based data and 72.5\% for the
   herd-based data. We conclude that because of the high sensitivity and
   specificity of the ELISA using antigen derived from merozoites, this
   assay would be a useful and reliable tool for general
   sero-epidemiological studies into infection with Sarcocystis. (C) 1997

Abstract = {A high-performance liquid chromatographic-UV-Vis photodiode-array
   detection (HPLC-DAD) method for the determination of nitrofuran
   residues, nitrofurazone, furazolidone and furaltadone, in chicken eggs
   is described. Confirmation of the identity of nitrofurazone,
   furazolidone and furaltadone was performed by high-performance liquid
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) using an atmospheric pressure
   ionization (API) source and an ionspray interface. The nitrofuran
   residues were extracted from eggs with acetonitrile and the extracts
   purified by liquid-liquid partitioning. Analytes were chromatographed
   isocratically with an octadecylsilyl (ODS) column and an UV-Vis detector
   set at 362 nm and identified by comparing the retention times and W-Vis
   spectra of the sample peaks with the reference compounds. The HPLC-DAD
   limit of detection based on a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 3, was
   estimated to be 2.5 mu g kg(-1) for nitrofurazone and furazolidone and
   5.0 mu g kg(-1) for furaltadone. The ionspray HPLC-MS was carried out on
   the purified extracts. The HPLC-MS method involved the separation of
   analytes on a C-18 column with acetonitrile-water (50:50, v/v),
   containing 1 mM ammonium acetate and 0.025\% acetic acid, with
   selected-ion monitoring (SIM) of only protonated molecules, {[}M+H](+)
   of the analytes. The overall average recovery in nitrofuran fortified
   eggs was 85.3+/-3.8\% for nitrofurazone, 88.1+/-3.9\% for furazolidone
   and 87.1+/-3.7\% for furaltadone. The HPLC-MS limit of detection, based
   on a S/N of 3, was estimated to be 3.2, 1.6 and 1.0 mu g kg(-1) for
   nitrofurazone, furazolidone and furaltadone, respectively. HPLC-MS has
   shown itself to be a sensitive, selective and rapid method and was
   successfully used for the confirmation analysis of nitrofurazone,
   furazolidone and furaltadone in avian eggs for regulatory purposes. (C)

   stress, a general tendency to the restoration of physiological values
   being evident thereafter. Laboratory parameters were highly correlated
   with disease conditions: with three exceptions only, animals showed
   altered laboratory parameters some days before the occurrence of
   clinical symptoms. Eighteen per cent of animals showed altered
   laboratory parameters with no obvious clinical signs of disease; yet
   they experienced a reduced weight gain. Results suggest that clinical
   immunological and haematological parameters could be the foundation of a
   new, large-scale, robust approach to the control of welfare in cattle,

Abstract = {Outbreaks of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) were reported in
   Lombardy, Northern Italy, at the end of 1990. For the purpose of this
   study, 54 slaughtered Holstein-Friesian cows showing typical lung
   lesions of CBPP from which the small colony type of Mycoplasma mycoides
   subspecies mycoides (M. m. mycoides SC) was isolated, were selected.
   Thoracic lymph nodes from these animals were sampled for
   bacteriological, histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Acute,
   subacute and chronic lesions were observed in 13, 12 and 29 cases,
   respectively. In the 13 animals showing acute lung lesions, an increased
   number of macrophages was observed, especially in the subcapsular
   sinuses, but frequently also in the cortical and medullary sinuses of
   the thoracic lymph nodes; in all 13 acute cases ill. In. mycoides SC
   antigen was detected immunohistochemically in the cytoplasm of-the
   macrophages. In 10 out of the 12 cases with subacute lung lesions,
   mycoplasma antigen was observed in macrophages located in sinuses, as
   well as in those scattered in the lymph node parenchyma. Hyperplasia of
   germinal centres in follicles was observed histologically in most of the
   29 cases with chronic lung lesions. In immunohistochemically labelled
   sections, the characteristic finding observed in 27 of the chronic
   cases, was the presence of a variable amount of positive material in the
   germinal centres. These findings demonstrate the involvement of thoracic
   lymph nodes in CBPP. (C) 1997 W.B. Saunders Company Limited.},

   15 (3.6 \%) of 419 feedlot cattle but not from 437 veal calves or 65
   culled cows. All strains of E. coli O157 hybridized with DNA probes
   specific for the VT1 or VT2 genes, but two strains did not produce toxin
   detectable by Vero cell assay. Six different plasmid profiles were
   observed with all strains harbouring the large 93 kb plasmid
   characteristic of VTEC. Six strains produced urease but otherwise
   strains were biochemically typical of E. coli O157. One strain was
   resistant to streptomycin, tetracycline and sulphonamides but the
   remainder mere sensitive to all antimicrobials tested. This is the first
   description of the isolation of verocytotoxin-producing E. call O157
   from cattle in Italy. As the contamination of bovine carcasses with E.
   coli O157 during slaughter and processing has been demonstrated, the
   risk of transmission of this organism from beef cattle to the human
   population in the Veneto region, through foods of bovine origin or by
   other routes, should not be overlooked.},

Abstract = {Hyperkeratotic dermatitis of athymic nude mice is an infectious disease
   caused by a coryneform bacterium. During the spring of 1995, outbreaks
   of hyperkeratotic dermatitis were observed in several nude mice
   facilities in northern Italy. In this report we describe the clinical,
   histopathological and microbiological features of the disease in two
   different animal facilities. Affected animals showed a typical `scaly'
   appearance with small white flakes of material adherent to the skin. In
   one of the outbreaks (facility 2) the lesions were less severe and
   involved only Limited areas of the body. The infection spread very
   quickly and the morbidity reached more than 80\% in a few days, while
   the mortality was about 1\%. The lesions resolved spontaneously within
   7-10 days. Histological examination of affected skin revealed
   orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis, acanthosis and dermal inflammatory
   infiltration which were more severe in mice from facility 1. In
   Gram-stained sections groups of rods consistent with coryneform bacteria
   were detectable in the keratin layers covering the epidermal surface. A
   coryneform bacterium, biochemically typed as Corynebacterium bovis, was
   isolated from 11 out of 11 mice from facility 1 and from 8 out of 11
   mice from facility 2.},

   animals had severe pruritus resulting in self-mutilation, and all four
   died within 24 hr after onset of clinical signs. Aujeszky's disease
   virus was isolated on first passage from the brain and was characterized
   by means of restriction endonuclease analysis. Based on these data, we
   believe that bears are extremely susceptible to the disease, and that
   wildlife managers should consider pseudorabies as a potential risk for

   was repeatedly detected and was due to a calicivirus antigenically

   seroprevalence of 33.3 per cent among young animals at weaning at 31
   days old, 27.6 per cent at five to seven days after weaning, 56.1 per
   cent at 13 to 14 days after weaning, 90.3 per cent at 19 to 20 days and
   100 per cent at 32 to 33 days after weaning, and all the breeding
   rabbits were seropositive. In the last group and in the young at
   weaning, the anti-RHDV antibodies were mainly class IgG, but they were
   IgM and IgA at 13 to 14 days after weaning, In older fattening rabbits,
   there was a decrease of IgM and IgA and an increase of IgG confirmed
   seroconversion without any specific signs of rabbit haemorrhagic
   disease, On the basis of these results, the probable time of infection
   of the meat rabbits with this non-pathogenic virus was immediately after
   weaning.},

Abstract = {Swine influenza viruses possessing avian genes were first detected in
   Europe in 1979 (Scholtissek et al., 1983, Virology, 129, 521-523) and
   continue to circulate in pigs in that region of the world. To
   characterize the molecular epidemiology of swine influenza viruses
   currently circulating in Europe, we used dot-blot hybridization and
   sequence analysis to determine the origin of the genes encoding the
   nonsurface proteins (''internal'' genes) of 10 H1N1 and 11 H3N2 swine
   influenza viruses isolated in Italy between 1992 and 1995. All of the
   126 genes-examined were of avian origin; thus the currently circulating
   H3N2 strains which possess A/Port Chalmers/1/73-like surface
   glycoproteins appear to be descendants of the reassortant human-avian
   viruses that emerged between 1983 and 1985 in Italy Sequence analysis of
   matrix (M), nonstructural, and nucleoprotein genes, as well as
   phylogenetic analysis of M gene showed that the H1N1 and H3N2 viruses
   from the pigs were closely related to recent isolates of the avian-like
   swine H1N1 influenza strain currently circulating in northern Europe and
   were distinguishable from the genes of viruses isolated from European
   swine in 1979. To evaluate the frequency of transmission of swine H1N1
   and H3N2 viruses to man, we tested 123 human sera for
   hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies against avian and mammalian H1N1
   and H3N2 virus strains. Our findings indicate that swine influenza
   viruses possessing A/Port Chalmers/1/73-like hemagglutinin may have
   transmitted to approximately 20\% of young persons under 20 years of age
   who had contact with pigs. Thus, H3N2 swine viruses, possibly possessing
   avian-derived internal genes, may be entering humans more often than was
   previously thought We strongly recommend that pigs be regularly
   monitored as a potential early warning system for detection of future
   pandemic strains. (C) 1997 Academic Press.},

Abstract = {The multistep analytical procedure routinely applied in our laboratory
   for the detection of the aryl amine beta-agonists clenbuterol, mabuterol
   and mapenterol in bovine matrices has been extended to the analysis in
   urine samples of brombuterol, a new clenbuterol-like compound. In the
   screening steps, the urine samples were first enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-tested, then the positive samples were
   analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and the beta-agonists
   detected with the Bratton-Marshall color reaction. The TLC spots
   corresponding to the suspected compounds were scraped off the plates,
   collected and extracted separately with methanol. The beta-agonists in
   the extracts were detected by HPLC-Vis (limits of detection: 0.5 ng/g).
   In the confirmatory step the presence and the concentration of the
   compounds of interest in the samples were established by GC-MS with two
   different ionization techniques, EI and CI (limits of detection: 1.0
   ng/g). The use of this procedure has made possible the detection of
   brombuterol in officially sampled bovine urine.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to compare immunomagnetic separation (IMS) and
   conventional selective enrichment procedures using selenite cystine
   broth (SC) and Rappaport-Vassiliadis broth (RV) in 137 naturally
   contaminated food samples (69 ran pork sausages and 68 chicken meat).
   The utilization of SC or IMS appeared to be the most appropriate
   enrichment procedure: 15 out of 18 Salmonella-positive samples (83.3\% )
   were detected by SC and 12 (66.7\%) by IMS; RV yielded only seven
   positive isolations (38.9\%). However, RV yielded the highest count of
   Salmonella colonies per plate and the lowest interference by competing
   organisms. IMS could become a reliable alternative to standard
   enrichment procedures and a combined IMS and selective enrichment broth
   could increase the chance of Salmonella recovery.},

   Avium complex. The primers used for the last recognised only some
   strains of the different types of M. avium and M. intracellulare. A
   number of field strains were identified as belonging to the

Abstract = {Field and collection isolates of Salmonella abortusovis carry one IS200
   element in a distinct chromosome location, IS200 is not found in the
   corresponding region of the chromosome of other Salmonella serovars.
   Sequencing of the boundaries of the S. abortusovis-specific IS200
   insertion permitted the design of primers for the amplification of this
   IS200 element by PCR. Isolates of S. abortusovis are identified by the
   amplification of a DNA fragment of about 900 bp or larger, PCR
   amplification of DNA from salmonellae other than S. abortusovis yields
   either a fragment of about 200 bp or no product, The high specificity of
   the assay is confirmed by the absence of cross-reactivity with the
   following templates: (i) sheep DNA, (ii) DNAs from abortion-causing
   agents other than S. abortusovis, and (iii) DNAs from microorganisms
   that do not cause abortion but are common in flocks.},

   across the junction of the 1C and 1D capsid-coding genes. Antigenic
   analysis was performed using a panel of 35 monoclonal antibodies raised
   against an Italian field isolate of EMCV. All three approaches revealed

Abstract = {In 1995 and 1996 a nine-month study was carried out in 11 pig abattoirs
   located in the Molise region (Italy) to evaluate the degree of
   contamination of the slaughterhouse environment, work surfaces,
   equipment, and personnel by Salmonella spp., Listeria spp., and Yersinia
   spp. A total of 219 samples were taken over three replications including
   slaughtering floor and wall, hooks, worktables, chopping blocks, knives,
   cleavers, dehairing devices, hands of personnel, clothing, hand-wash
   basins, and cold room handles, floor, wall, and hooks. Overall, six
   abattoirs (54.5\%) had one or more positive sites, while only 14 of the
   219 sites (6.4\%) tested were positive for any of considered
   microorganisms. Salmonella spp. were isolated from 1 of 9 cleavers
   (11.1\%), 1 of 16 worktables (6.25\%), and 1 of 18 slaughtering floors
   (5.6\%). Yersinia enterocolitica was found on 3 slaughtering floors
   (16.7\%) and on 2 worktables (12.5\%). Yersinia kristensenii was
   detected on 2 slaughtering floor swabs (11.1\%). Listeria monocytogenes
   was isolated from 2 of 20 cold room floor swabs (13.3\%) and from 1 of
   14 hand-wash basins (7.1\%). Other species of Listeria were detected on
   slaughtering wall and floor swabs and on chopping blocks. Our study

Abstract = {The activity of Cs-137, Cs-134 and K-40 in tissues from fish, mollusc
   and shellfish of the Ligurian sea was measured during 1987-1988. The
   mean annual concentrations in 1987 were 5.92 +/- 4.1 Bq/kg (wet tissue)
   for Cs-137 and 2.7 +/- 1.5 Bq/kg for Cs-134 and 2.46 +/- 1.82 and 0.33
   +/- 0.57 Bq/kg respectively in 1988. The mean value of K-40 activity was
   138.6 +/- 22.1 Bq/kg. Contamination was significantly higher in the
   littoral area up to 1000 m from the coast (8.39 +/- 7.6 and 1.74 +/-
   2.08 Bq/kg respectively versus 2.91 +/- 1.87 and 0.58 +/- 0.59 Bq/kg
   respectively in the open sea). The common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) had
   the highest radioactivity values and could be utilized as an indicator
   of radioactivity pollution. There were no significant differences
   regarding the trophic level, the seafood phylum, or the east and west
   Ligurian sea areas. Long-term reduction in the sea habitat was estimated
   at about 200 days for Cs-137 and 110 days for Cs-134, reflecting
   differences in the physical half-life of these radionuclides. These
   values were lower than those found in terrestrial foodstuff and could
   have reflected dilution of the contaminants in the open sea. The
   effective dose equivalent for the Ligurian population of radiocesium
   originating from seafood was estimated at 1.3 mu Sv in 1987 and 0.5 mu
   Sv in 1988. These values represent 0.8 and 0.3\% respectively of the
   annual dose (180 mu Sv/year) due to K-40 intake with the diet. (C) 1997

Abstract = {BHK-21 c13 monolayer and suspension cells were investigated with regard
   to some phenotypic features which could bear on the quality of foot-and
   -mouth disease virus (FMDV) antigen produced in them. Despite good
   viability, suspension cells differed from monolayer cells in fundamental
   features of susceptibility to FMDV. Most important, FMD virus particles
   grown in suspension cells at high passage levels were shown to be
   largely degraded following inactivation with an aziridine compound.
   Suspension cells were characterised cy a downregulation in the surface
   expression of both alpha 5 and alpha V integrin chains. According to the
   results of binding assays, both integrins could act as FMDV receptors on
   BHK-21 c13 cells. Reduced surface expression of integrins was correlated
   with disappearance of actin stress fibres, which would play a role in:
   regular encapsidation of viral RNA and hence in stability of virus
   particles. With regard to FMD vaccine production, practical suggestions
   are put forward to evaluate the quality of BHK-21 c13 cells and FMDV Ag,
   which must prove stable during downstream processing. (C) 1997 The

Abstract = {Five mathematical models were compared to select the most satisfactory
   model to describe digesta kinetics of solids and fluids in the
   gastrointestinal tract of buffaloes (Mediterranean bulls), cattle
   (Friesian bulls) and sheep (Delle Langhe rams) given food at maintenance
   level, according to a Latin-square arrangement for four consecutive
   periods of 21 days. Chromium mordanted alfalfa hay and
   cobalt-ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid were used as nonabsorbable
   markers and were administered through the rumen cannula in a single
   dose. Four different isonitrogenous diets (N x 6.25 = 140 g/kg dry
   matter) with different concentrate:forage ratios (12.5:87.5, 25:75,
   37.5:62.5, 50:50) were used.
   Faecal chromium and cobalt concentration curves were fitted with five
   non-linear models: three gamma (G2, G3, G4) age-dependent
   one-compartment, one gamma age-dependent/age-independent two-compartment
   (G2G1) and one multicompartment (MC).
   Wilcoxon tests on residual sums of squares of the different models for
   solids showed that MC and G4 gave a better fit than G2G1, G2, G3 for all
   the data and within the species. The comparison of MC v. G4 did not show
   any significant difference (P > 0.05) for all the data computed together
   or within each species. Nevertheless, MC had a higher number of curves
   with lower residual sums of squares in comparison with G4 and was also
   able to produce estimates of digesta kinetics in the second compartment.
   The cobalt excretion curves for fluids, considering all the data, and
   only within sheep, showed G4 as the best fitting model. When G4 was
   compared with other models no significant differences were recorded
   either for cattle: G4 v. G2 (P = 0.6645), G4 v. G2G1 (P = 0.0620) and
   for buffalo: G4 v. G2 (P = 0.1575), G4 v. G3 (P = 0.0796) and G4 v. G2G1
   (P = 0.1641).
   It is concluded that the multicompartment model (MC) and G4 model were
   the best fits for solids and for fluids respectively.},

Abstract = {Viruses from the recent epidemic of swine vesicular disease (SVD) in
   Europe have been isolated and characterized by antigenic and genetic
   methods to examine the likely epidemiological origins of the disease.
   Antigenic analysis was performed on 77 SVD viruses (SVDV) isolated in
   Europe between 1966 and 1994 using two panels of monoclonal antibodies
   (MAb) in a trapping ELISA. Genetic analysis of 33 of the SVD viruses by
   reverse transcription-polymerase chain-reaction (RT-PCR) amplification
   and nucleotide sequencing of the 1D (VP1) coding region was also
   performed. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences with each other and
   with three other previously published SVDV sequences revealed four
   distinct groups which correlated exactly with the results of the pattern
   of reactivity with MAbs. The first group consisted solely of the
   earliest SVD virus isolated (ITL/1/66) while the second group comprised
   viruses present in Europe and Japan between 1972 and 1981. The third
   group consisted of viruses isolated from outbreaks of SVD in Italy
   between December 1988 and June 1992. Viruses isolated between 1987 and
   1994 from Romania, the Netherlands, Italy and Spain formed a fourth
   group. The genetic and antigenic similarity of the most recent virus
   isolates from Western Europe to a virus isolated in Romania 5 years
   previously suggests that the possible origin of the recent epidemic of
   swine vesicular disease in Western Europe was in Eastern Europe.},

Month = {JAN 31},
Abstract = {Ninety-two ewes of the Comisana breed were used in a study to verify the
   forecasting capacity of the mathematical model proposed by Wood for
   fitting sheep data, and to evaluate the effect of the environmental
   factors affecting the parameters of the lactation curve. The Wood model
   underestimated the total lactation milk production with an error margin
   of 12.2 +/- 7.8 kg of milk corresponding to 10.9 +/- 6.6\%. There was a
   strong influence of order of lambing x lambing season interaction on the
   lactation parameters. The curves for the winter lambing ewes
   demonstrated a higher peak production than autumn lambing ewes (1728.4
   vs. 1082.6 g, P less than or equal to 0.05 for the second lambing ewes
   and 1772.8 vs. 1383.7 g, P less than or equal to 0.01 for greater than
   or equal to 3 lambing ewes); the season persistence difference was
   small, 4.88 vs. 5.60 for second lambing and 5.32 vs. 5.33 for greater
   than or equal to 3 lambings. Simple correlations within lambing season
   showed negative correlation between the peak production and the
   persistence of lactation (r(a) = -0.32 and r(w) = -0.15). The time at
   peak and the persistence were positively correlated (r(a) = 0.88 and
   r(w) = 0.97). Parity was positively correlated with peak production
   (r(a) = 0.41 and r(w) = 0.50) and negatively correlated with the time at
   the peak (r(a) = -0.22 and r(w) = -0.39) and the persistence (r(a) =
   -0.25 and r(w) = -0.41). The linear regression of peak production on
   total production referring to the period from the 31st day post-partum
   to lactation end was significant. The type of lambing did not
   significantly influence the shape of the lactation curve although sheep
   lambing to twins produced more mirk than those having single lambs.},

Abstract = {A diagnostic assay to differentiate antibodies induced by foot-and-mouth
   disease virus (FMDV) infection from those induced by vaccination was
   developed. The test is an indirect-trapping ELISA which uses a
   monoclonal antibody to trap the non-structural 3ABC-FMDV polypeptide
   expressed in E. coli. Experimental and field sera from naive, vaccinated
   and infected cattle were examined. Using the established threshold of
   0.20 optical density units, the sensitivity of the assay was 100\%, as
   all the experimental post-infection sera (n degrees = 137) gave values
   greater than this threshold, irrespective of the FMDV serotype used for
   the infection. In contrast, more than 99\% of sera from vaccinated
   animals were negative (225 out of 228 prime-vaccinates and 159 out of
   159 multi-vaccinates). A high degree of specificity was also confirmed
   by the finding that 99.5\% (442 out of 444) of sera from naive animals
   gave negative results. Serum conversion against 3ABC was first detected
   8 days post-infection and demonstrable levels of 3ABC specific
   antibodies were detectable at least 1 year post-infection. The described
   3ABC-ELISA is safe, cheap and also easy to perform in large scale
   serological surveys. The high specificity and sensitivity makes this
   test an ideal tool for FMD eradication campaigns and control programs.},

Abstract = {A Sphaerospora sp. (Myxosporea) infection (presumably S. truttae) was
   identified on a trout farm in northeastern Italy. Parasites were
   detected in kidneys from infected brown trout, Salmo trutta L., over a
   2-year period. Extrasporogonic, sporogonic stages and mature spores were
   simultaneously detected in the same fish. Traditional diagnostic methods
   for Sphaerospora spp. rely on the detection of the myxosporean
   developmental stages in Giemsa-stained kidney smears or
   haematoxylin-eosin stained tissue sections. A histochemical method was
   employed where 10 biotinylated lectins (Con-A, DBA, SBA, GS-I, PHA-P,
   LEA, PWM, RCA(1), WGA and UEA-I) and the avidin-biotin-peroxidase
   complex (ABC) were used on Sphaerospora-infected brown trout renal
   tissues and kidney imprints. Five monoclonal antibodies against PKX (Mab
   12, MabA3, MabC5, MabD4 and MabB4) were also tested. A lectin
   glycoconjugate binding pattern for Sphaerospora spp. is presented. This
   staining method shows that SBA lectin (Glycine max agglutinin) is a
   useful tool for the detection of the Sphaerospora spp. Only MabB4 bound
   some of the most mature sporogonic stages. In contrast Mabs12, A3, C5
   and D4, and GS-I lectin (Griffonia simplicifolia agglutinin) did not
   stain any of the Sphaerospora spp. stages, but did bind very
   specifically to the sporogonic and extrasporogonic stages of PKX, the
   causative agent of proliferative kidney disease (PKD).},

Abstract = {A rapid and very effective analytical procedure for the routine HPLC
   determination of ivermectin (IVM) residues in milk for human consumption
   or for the dairy industry was developed and tested. The drug was
   extracted from the sample with acetonitrile and then the extract, mixed
   with water and triethylamine, was rapidly cleaned up on an SPE C-18
   column. The IVM eluate was derivatized and the derivatization mixture
   was cleaned up on an SPE silica column. The IVM derivate was then
   analysed by HPLC with fluorescence detection. The mean findings from IVM
   fortified samples were 73\% with SD 4\% for cow milk, 70\% with SD 5\%
   for sheep milk, 80\% with SD 4\% for goat milk and 78\% with SD 5\% for
   buffalo milk in a concentration range of 2.8-55.6 ng/mL. The limit of
   determination was 0.5 ng/mL (ppb) and the absolute detection limit was
   250 pg injected IVM.},

Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {64},
Number = {3},
Pages = {239-244},
Abstract = {Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to assess genetic
   variability and differentiation at 40 gene loci in 102 roe deer from
   five sampling sites in the province of Siena, central Italy. Eight loci
   proved to be polymorphic in at least one population. Averaged over
   populations, values of expected heterozygosity (mean He = 0.044, SD =
   0.007) and the proportion of polymorphic loci (mean P = 0.135, SD =
   0.028) were as high as chose found for roe deer of southern and central
   Europe. In spite of a moderately high level of gene flow between sites
   (Nm = 4.7), the existence of some degree of genetic structuring in the
   whole population of Siena could be demonstrated. Demographic events
   (i.e., restocking, bottlenecks), rather than genetic isolation were
   explained to be responsible for the differences in allele frequencies
   found among populations. The allochthonous origin of roe deer living on
   Mount Amiata could be proved by genetic data. The results are discussed
   in the light of historical and demographic information on this species
   in the province.},

   degrees C at 18\% RH (more than 180 days), Sporocysts maintained at room
   temperature at all humidities had the lowest level of survival, It is
   concluded that sporocysts of S. cruzi are able to survive in most

   two new benzopsoralen derivatives, was tested on HL60 and HeLa cell
   lints in the dark and by UVA irradiation; 8-methoxypsoralen was used as
   a reference compound. The action of the compounds was evaluated by means
   of the neutral red uptake assay, by means of ultrastructure, morphometry
   and interaction with human erythrocytes membrane. In both HL60 and HeLa
   cell lines benzopsoralen derivatives showed more antiproliferative
   activity after UVA irradiation, however less than 8-methoxypsoralen.
   Compound 1 was more effective than compound 2 both in the dark and after
   UVA irradiation. The ultrastructure showed a morphological rank damage
   caused by these compounds: compound 2 induced slight modifications in
   the cytoplasm organization, compound 1 induced some vacuolizations and
   8-methoxypsoralen generated plenty of vacuoles and an empty space around
   the nucleus. Morphometrical data in HL60 cells turned out to be in
   accordance with the different action mechanisms existing between
   8-methoxypsoralen and the two benzopsoralen derivatives; in HeLa cells
   we noted an increase in the nuclear area induced by all the three
   compounds. Only compound 1 caused the formation of echinocytes both in
   the dark and after UVA irradiation, suggesting the involvement of a
   mechanism not strictly related to DNA interaction and singlet oxygen

Abstract = {Predation on domestic livestock caused by species of conservation value
   such as wolf Canis lupus and bear Ursus arctos is a common complaint in
   parts of the Abruzzo region (Italy) where extensive grazing is
   practised. The reliability of current damage evaluation methods was
   found to be weak in relation to identification between canid attacks
   (wolf or dog) as an ultimate cause of livestock death. An enquiry into
   the characteristics of farming units damaged by predation showed how the
   problem of predation could not be viewed in isolation from the
   socio-economic context in which it occurred. From a sample of communes
   concerned over predation, only 4.1\% of 563 claimants (controlling 25
   farming management units) could be considered as `chronically' affected
   by predation (> two attacks per year) and took up over a third of the
   claims. The majority claimed less than one attack per year bur 36.1\% of
   these held sheep, cattle or equids for allegedly non-commercial reasons.
   There is evidence for the expansion of wolves in Italy: the availability
   of a variety of wild ungulates has been identified as a strong factor in
   diverting predator pressure from domestic livestock. This may hold true
   if the management methods of `at risk' livestock categories are closely
   monitored and reappraised where necessary. Moreover, economic incentives
   such as compensation should be aimed primarily at owners most likely to
   enter into conflict with wildlife, owing to their economic reliance upon
   traditional husbandry methods. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {In this work the Authors report the data relative to anabolic drug
   residue analyses in animal origin matrices from Campania and Calabria in
   the 1994-1995 years. The analyses were carried out for detection of
   natural (17 beta-estradiol, 17-beta-testosterone, progesterone) and
   synthetic (boldenone, trenbolone, nandrolone) steroids, stilbene
   derivatives (DES, zeranol, dienestrol, hexestrol), corticosteroids and
   beta(2)-agonists. The Authors point out that most samples came from
   bovine breedings, according to the National Residue Plan; moreover, the
   correlations between analysed samples and real livestocks of Campania
   and Calabria provinces are reported.
   The results of the analyses confirm that there is an illegal use of
   beta(2)-agonists in bovine breedings, and that For the detection of such
   drug residues eyeballs should be considered as a more appropriate matrix
   than urine.},

Abstract = {The distribution of albendazole (ABZ) and its main metabolites
   albendazole sulphoxide (ABZSO), albendazole sulphone (ABZSO(2)) and
   albendazole 2-aminosulphone (NH(2)ABZSO(2)) were investigated in bulk
   milk and milk products after administration of a single oral dose of the
   drug (12.5 mg/kg) to 80 Laticauda sheep. An analytical method was
   developed for this investigation from an existing procedure used for the
   determination of these compounds in plasma and digesta samples. No
   traces of the parent compound or NH(2)ABZSO(2) were found in milk or
   milk products, with the exception of the milk collected 36 h after
   treatment in which 89 mu g NH(2)ABZSO(2)/kg was detected. Results
   indicated that ABZ was rapidly oxidized to ABZSO and then to ABZSO(2).
   These metabolites were found at high levels (1-4 mg/kg) in milk
   collected within 24 h after treatment. Products derived from such milk
   also contained high concentrations of the two oxidized metabolites,
   including up to 5 mg ABZSO/kg in Pecorino cheese. Only small quantities
   of these two metabolites were found in milk collected during the second
   day after treatment (range 50-500 mu g/kg). They were no longer
   detectable in milk collected during the third day after dosing; nor were
   they found in products made from such milli. These findings confirm that
   the two polar metabolites ABZSO and ABZSO(2) were efficiently excreted
   from the body. Considering that the established maximum residue limit
   for ovine milk is 100 mu g/kg for ABZ plus its metabolites, our results
   confirmed the appropriateness of the currently prescribed withdrawal
   time (3 d) after the use of ABZ in lactating sheep. However,
   considerable levels of ABZSO were detected in milk collected within 24 h
   after treatment as well as in products and by-products derived from such
   milk. Owing to the known toxicity of the ABZSO, we stress the need for
   careful control to ensure adherence to the prescribed withdrawal time.},

Abstract = {Species-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were developed against
   Mycoplasma agalactiae reference strain PG2 and French isolate P89 to
   study the in vitro expression of surface epitopes and to probe the
   antigenic profiles of 245 field isolates originating from 10 different
   countries. Colony immunostaining with MAbs on clonal lineage showed that
   4 out of 9 species-specific epitopes exhibited a high rate of variation,
   demonstrating that M. agalactiae possesses a capacity for phenotypic
   diversification of its surface antigenicity. The emphasis was on dot
   immunobinding screening of the Geld isolates with MAbs recognizing
   permanently expressed epitopes. Eight different profiles could be
   defined. Great differences in epitope conservation were demonstrated
   with some area-specific strains completely lacking certain specific
   determinants. These results indicate that the antigenic variability of
   M. agalactiae relies not only upon surface switching mechanisms but also
   upon true epitope differences, partially related to the geographic
   origin of the isolates.},

Abstract = {Leishmania infantum is the causative agent of canine leishmaniasis in
   the Mediterranean area, The aspects of the canine immune response which
   may explain the chronic severe disease in these animals have not been
   well investigated. Therefore, in this work we have evaluated the
   parasite killing ability by circulating polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells
   and monocytes in dogs with spontaneous leishmaniasis and in healthy
   dogs. Moreover, in order to analyse the mechanisms responsible for
   killing activity, we evaluated the oxidative burst of circulating PMN
   cells, in terms of O-2(-) and H2O2 production, The killing ability of
   infected dog PMN cells and monocytes was significantly lower than in a
   group of healthy dogs and a group of infected dogs treated with
   meglumine antimoniate and without symptoms of leishmaniasis, Superoxide
   anion and hydrogen peroxide production by PMN cells was significantly
   lower in a group of Leishmania-infected dogs than in healthy dogs,
   suggesting that these mediators may be involved in the reduced killing
   activity of infected dogs.},

Abstract = {The European brown hare syndrome virus (eBHSV) and the rabbit

   discover whether the homologous and heterologous host could be infected.
   The aims were to confirm the results of previous studies that showed the
   existence of antigenic differences between these two viruses, and also
   to define the role attributed to the hare in transmission to rabbits of
   a disease, EBHS, initially mistaken for RHD. During the trials, clinical
   symptoms and pathological lesions were noted, and virological and
   serological analysis were conducted, using specific tests set up for
   both diseases. The hares infected with EBHSV died of an acute form of
   EBHS, whereas the rabbits remained healthy. The low serological response
   in these rabbits towards the EBHSV did not protect them against RHDV.
   Similarly, hares inoculated with RHDV remained healthy and showed a low
   anti-RHDV antibody titre but died when challenged with EBHSV.},

Abstract = {The experiment was conducted on an alpine pasture composed predominantly
   of gramineae (more than 62\% of ground cover) with 18 lactating Brown
   Swiss cows (average yield 21.0 kg FCM, SD 3.14), which received a
   supplement of concentrates according to their milk production (range
   1.5-8.0 kg day(-1)), Herbage intake was estimated for all the animals
   with the chromium oxide method (twice-daily dosing), associated with the
   in vitro OM digestibility, and with the n-alkane method, using C-31 as
   the internal marker and C-32 as the external marker (once-daily dosing).
   The sampling of the herbage by hand plucking and the faeces (four grab
   samples per day) was performed for 5 consecutive days. In order to
   evaluate the variability of the markers excretion, the daily samples of
   faeces from six animals were analysed separately. The repeatability
   within day of the faecal concentration of the n-alkanes was higher than
   that for the chromium oxide (0.41, 0.48 and 0.55 for C-31, C-32 and the
   C-31/C-32 ratio, respectively vs. 0.18 for the chromium oxide). The
   highest proportion of the variation in the estimated intake was
   associated with the differences between days for the n-alkane method
   (54.6\% of the total), while the samplings within days were more
   important for the chromium oxide technique (67.0\% of the total). On
   average, herbage intake estimated with the two methods coincided if the
   recovery of the chromium oxide was assumed to be 95.5\%. The correlation
   between estimates was 0.62{*}{*} and did not appear to be influenced by
   the level of concentrates in the diet. Considering the mode of executing
   the two methods under comparison, it was concluded that the n-alkane
   technique is easier to perform and less laborious.},

   cavae and lungs. The prevalence of the infection by adult worms at
   necropsy was 63\%. The sensitivity of the rests ranged from 60\%

   (filtration) to 98\% (PetChek). The results of all the tests differed
   significantly (p<0.01) from those obtained at necropsy. The sensitivity
   of the tests was also assessed with respect to the differing numbers of

   carry an IS200 element in similar or identical locations; this band can
   be potentially useful for serovar identification. S. abortusovis
   collection isolates from distinct geographic areas were highly
   polymorphic, suggesting that IS200 fingerprints might provide
   information on the geographic origin of S. abortusovis strains. Isolates
   obtained from the same geographic area (the island of Sardinia, Italy)
   were less polymorphic: all shared three constant IS200 hybridization
   bands, indicating that they derive from a single ancestor. Most strains
   analyzed contained an additional copy of IS200 in the variable region of
   the virulence plasmid. Certain Sardinian flocks proved to be infected by
   only one S. abortusovis strain, while others harbored two strains.
   Strain typing with IS200 fingerprints proved to be more reliable than
   plasmid analysis, because the latter yielded a high degree of
   polymorphism, even among isolates from the same flock.},

Abstract = {A polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based test was developed for the
   detection of Mycoplasma agalactiae in sheep milk samples. Two
   oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify a 375 bp fragment of M.
   agalactiae chromosomal DNA. Amplified products were analyzed by agarose
   gel electrophoresis and Southern blot hybridization using a fluorescein
   labeled 528 bp probe. The primers allowed the amplification of a
   fragment of M. agalactiae DNA and did not amplify any specific fragment
   of other mycoplasmal DNAs (M. capricolum, M. mycoides subsp. mycoides,
   M. mycoides subsp. capri, M. putrefaciens, M. arginini and M. bovis) or
   other bacterial DNAs (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, P. haemolytica, E.
   coli, S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae, S. uberis, B. cereus, P.
   aeruginosa, S. durans, L. lactis, L. lactis var. diacetilactis, L.
   mesenteroides, S. thermophilus, L. bulgaricus and L. casei). The limit
   of detection of PCR assay was between 2.5 and 25 fg of purified DNA and
   10(2) CCU ml(-1) on mycoplasma cultures. These results indicate that the
   PCR technique can be used as a rapid and specific diagnostic method for
   detection of M. agalactiae.},

Abstract = {One calf was infected with bovine herpesvirus-l (BHV-1) and mixed with
   five other calves, of which one had been vaccinated with a BHV-1
   modified live vaccine one month earlier. The other four calves were
   vaccinated at the time the experimentally infected calf developed the
   first signs of the disease (fever, depression, nasal discharge), i.e. on
   post infection day (PID) 2. In addition to the vaccine, two of the four
   PID 2 vaccinated calves also received a non-specific defence (NSD)
   inducer (Baypamun, Payer AG) at the same time as the vaccine.
   The calf that was vaccinated 1 month before the start of the experiment,
   as expected, did not show any signs of the disease. Of the remaining
   four, the two vaccine-only calves experienced a classical form of
   infectious bovine rhinotracheitis. However, the two calves that had also
   received the NSD inducer remained generally healthy during the entire
   observation period of 30 days.
   It was speculated that the use of a NSD inducer once an outbreak of a
   respiratory disease has started on a farm could be of significant help
   in an emergency in reducing the clinical manifestations in those animals
   that may subsequently be infected. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {Is here described a method founded on the microwave system that: allows
   to abbreviate execution times of the analysis for polyphosphate
   determination in meat products (cooked shoulder, cooked ham and cooked
   sausages). The analytical method used for polyphosphate determination is
   founded on the difference between total phosphorus and organic
   phosphorus naturally present in the animal tissue. The organic
   phosphorus is detected by the indirect way through the dosage of total
   protein; the total phosphorus is determined in the ashes of the examined
   products. This procedure has different critical steps: firstly the
   temperature control during ashing time and secondly the ashes acid
   hydrolysis to obtain phosphate anion. Thanks to the microwave system
   it's possible to carry out the sample destruction in forty minutes,
   suppressing all critical steps; furthermore at the same time it is
   possible to examine several samples (ten for every hydrolysis steps)
   with a very simplified way in regard to the traditional method.},

Abstract = {A method for the immunoaffinity extraction of dexamethasone and

   gel, containing antibodies raised against dexamethasone, was used to
   prepare an immunoaffinity cartridge which was inserted in an automatic
   HPLC system for on-line extraction and purification. By injecting urine
   samples (spiked with flumethasone as internal standard) directly into
   the system, it was possible to collect purified fractions, containing
   the analytes of interest. The fractions were dried and derivatized to
   yield the tetra-trimethylsilyl derivatives of the three corticosteroids,
   which were analyzed by selected ion monitoring gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry. The method allowed a very good purification of samples and
   reached a detection limit of 0.1 ng/ml for dexamethasone and 0.2 ng/ml
   for betamethasone. Several samples, coming from a steer treated with
   dexamethasone and from other bovines coming from breedings in northern
   Italy, were analyzed with the method described. Dexamethasone levels
   ranged from 0.12 to 146 ng/ml. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

Abstract = {We have developed a fast and convenient detection method for the
   etiological agent of enteric redmouth disease in rainbow trout, the
   bacterium Yersinia ruckeri, using the random amplification of
   polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique to design specific primers for a
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnosis. In the RAPD genomic
   fingerprint of Y. ruckeri, a specific band was observed which gave no
   cross-hybridization with the genomes of other bacteria in Southern blot
   analysis. This band was cloned, sequenced, and found to bear no homology
   with known DNA sequences. Two primers were then synthesized to amplify
   by PCR the fragment lying between the terminal RAPD primer sequences of
   the band. The PCR assay detected specifically 3 serotypes of Y. ruckeri
   (serotypes O1, O2, and unknown) in samples with whole bacteria. It also
   detected the bacterium in kidney tissue from infected trout after brief
   digestion with proteinase K. Sample preparation was kept simple to
   minimize the risk of false positives due to inter-sample contamination.
   Because of its speed, inherent sensitivity, and apparent specificity we
   concluded that this diagnostic system was preferable to conventional
   bacteriological diagnostic tests.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The applicability of gel permeation chromatography (GPC) to the
   purification in foodstuffs in the detection of three classes of drugs,
   sulfonamides, nitrofurans, and growth promoters, is described, This
   technique has already found a wide application in the routine analysis
   of pesticides in milk, eggs and grease but to our knowledge there is no
   published work on the use of GPC for purifying animal feedstuffs for the
   detection of the above-mentioned classes of drugs. Three main advantages
   characterize this method: the simultaneous determination of a wide
   spectrum of drugs; good performance of the purification system; and high
   recoveries, The method was tested for a determination limit of 1 ppm in
   each compound, Average recoveries of spiked samples were: 99\% for
   sulfonamides; 98\% for nitrofurans; and 100\% for carbadox
   {[}methyl-3-(2-quinoxaiinylmethylene) carbazate-1,4-dioxide] and
   olaquindox
   {[}N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-methyl-2-quinoxalinecarboxamide-1,4-dioxide].
   The method was also tested for linearity over the range 1-100 ppm and
   gave r values between 0.9998 and 0.9999 for each drug, Analyses were
   performed by HPLC, either using a diode array or windowplot-system
   detector, The described method is quick and simple, which is very useful
   in routine analysis.},

Abstract = {Roe deer from the provinces of Siena and Arezzo, central Italy, were
   investigated for genetic and morphometric differentiation. A total of
   162 individuals from seven sampling sites (4 in Siena, 3 in Arezzo) were
   analysed at 40 presumptive gene loci by means of vertical polyacrylamide
   gel electrophoresis. Seven loci were polymorphic for at least two
   alleles. The mean proportion of polymorphic loci (P) was 16.2\% in
   Siena, and 15.8\% in Arezzo. Mean expected heterozygosity (H-e) was
   5.3\% and 4.0\% in Siena and Arezzo, respectively. Both the values of
   relative (F-ST = 8\%) and absolute (mean NEI'S 1972 D = 0.007, mean
   modified Rogers D = 0.084) genetic distance suggest a significant
   differentiation between the subpopulations of Siena and Arezzo, possibly
   due to the different demographic origin of roe deer from the two
   provinces. Morphometric variation in 28 cranial and mandibular traits,
   measured in 48 individuals, was subjected to principal component and
   discriminant function analyses. Both methods allowed a quite clear
   separation of specimens from the two provinces, revealing significantly
   greater skull dimensions in the roe deer from Arezzo. Although genetic
   factors might be involved, a higher density of deer within the wooded
   areas of Siena was hypothesized as the main environmental cause of
   morphometric differentiation.},

   extraction. Both RP-TLC and RP-HPLC methods for semi-quantitative and
   quantitative determination have been described respectively, together
   with a RP-HPLC confirmation procedure, via conversion to OA-methyl
   ester. The TLC and HPLC determination limits were 8.0 ng/g and 0.10 ng/g
   respectively. The mean recovery from spiked samples was 95\%.},

Abstract = {The possibility of using an ELISA for the diagnosis of ovine brucellosis
   in milk (M-ELISA) was investigated. The aim of the study was to
   establish whether the specificity and sensitivity of the M-ELISA would
   be high enough to detect low levels of Brucella antibodies in ewe milk.
   The diagnostic performances of the test under study were established by
   means of reference standards and compared with conventional screening
   and confirmatory tests under field conditions. The diagnostic
   specificity of the M-ELISA established on a number of samples from
   Brucella-free flocks was 100\% while relative to RBT and CFT positive
   reactors the M-ELISA demonstrated sensitivity of 65 and 83\%
   respectively. Its sensitivity relative to culture positive animals was
   of 92\%. The course of Brucella antibodies in milk of positive sheep was
   evaluated in colostrum and in mature milk for a period of 30 days after
   delivery and it appeared that concentrations of immunoglobulins in milk
   tend to sharply decrease soon after parturition while in blood serum
   these remained constantly high. It was concluded that the M-ELISA for
   Brucella antibodies in ewe milk can be regarded as a complementary
   diagnostic tool for individual testing but it would be poorly viable if
   used as a screening test applied to pooled flock milks.},

Abstract = {A survey of 30,907 slaughterhouse cattle (5,984 calves, 15,937 young
   adult, 8,986 cows) was carried out to determine the incidence of blood
   and serous cysts on atrioventricular valves. The cysts were classified
   by their content (blood/serous fluid), location (mitral/tricuspid
   valve), and size. Cyst wall samples were processed for histology,
   immunohistochemistry for factor VIII-related antigen, and transmission
   electron microscopy. The content of some cysts was studied by
   electrophoresis and biochemical and microbiologic methods. Older cows
   had a higher incidence (16.2\%) than younger animals (11.5\% in calves,
   7.9\% in steers, 6.4\% in heifers), suggesting that the lesions may be
   acquired. Blood cysts were often present on both atrioventricular
   valves; serous cysts prevailed on the mitral valve. Cysts of both types
   were larger in older animals; serous cysts were larger than the blood
   cysts. Histologically, blood cysts contained fresh blood, and serous
   cysts were filled with a hyaline fluid devoid of cells, sterile, and
   biochemically similar to lymph. All the cysts were lined with
   endothelium, but a positive immunostaining for the factor VIII-related
   antigen was appreciable only in blood cysts. Ultrastructurally, the
   endothelium was composed of flat endothelial cells holding several
   cytoplasmic filaments, lying in blood cysts on a continuous and often
   laminated basal lamina with many cytoplasmic projections. The results
   support the hypothesis that cysts of the atrioventricular valves derive
   from the dilation of blood and lymphatic valvular vessels, do not
   regress with age, and are mainly the result of mechanical effects.},

   were prepared, purified and submitted to the ELISA test. For every set
   of positive honey samples, a set of OTC-standard solutions in water at
   the same concentration value of the positive samples and an OTC-negative
   (blank) control honey sample, were tested. Also, the efficiency of three
   different chemical purification procedures of honey samples was studied
   and verified. (1) the honey samples were diluted in water; (2) the honey
   samples were purified on a prepacked reversed-phase column (C-18
   cartridges); (3) the honey samples were purified by a two-step system
   using a C-18 cartridge and a Diet-column. The mean recoveries of OTC
   were 90.4\% (CV = 2.6\%) for the test using C-18 (2) and 88.6\% (CV =

Abstract = {185 different strains of Staph.aureus isolated from cases of clinical
   and subclinical mastitis were classified by biotyping and plasmid
   pattern. Within the 12 biotypes identified, 8 comprised 174 strains
   (95.4\%), while the distibution of plasmid fragments allowed to define
   17 different patterns (3 of them included 158 strains). The analysis of
   the relationship between pattern and antibiotic resistance showed that
   Tetracycline MIC values could be related to plasmid pattern 3, while
   Rifaximin MIC values to biotype pattern 9. Moreover, a significant
   association betweeen strains with plasmid pattern 3 and lower level in
   milk PMNs (and higher level of Macrophages) of infected quarters was
   demonstrated. Most of the strains within these 2 patterns were isolated
   from only two herds. Our results suggest that biological and
   therapeutical pressures in a specific herd could select Staph.aureus
   strains inducing low immune response (low PMNs ratio) and higher
   resistance to antibiotics increasing the difficulties in controlling
   infections.},

Abstract = {The lentogenic La Sota strain of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was
   adapted to grow in the BS/BEK cell line of bovine embryo kidney origin
   with a infectious titre similar to that in chicken embryos. No
   modification in the biological properties was detected after serial
   passages in the cell line, as indicated by CPE and by size and shape of
   the plaques. By contrast, the intracerebral pathogenicity index test,
   determined in 1-day-old chicks, was lower than for La Sota grown in
   chicken embryos. However, the immunogenicity of the cell culture adapted
   virus did not show any variation as demonstrated by serological response
   and by protection following challenge with virulent NDV. Accordingly, it
   appears that La Sota grown in cell cultures has retained its biological
   and immunological characteristics and if these results are confirmed by
   field trials and long term protection tests, the use of the BS/BEK cell
   line could be an alternative to chicken embryos for the cultivation of
   NDV.},

Abstract = {Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus, a positive-stranded RNA virus of the
   family Caliciviridae, encodes a trypsin-like cysteine protease as part
   of a large polyprotein. Upon expression in Escherichia coli, the
   protease releases itself from larger precursors by proteolytic cleavages
   at its N and C termini. Both cleavage sites were determined by
   N-terminal sequence analysis of the cleavage products, Cleavage at the N
   terminus of the protease occurred with high efficiency at an EG
   dipeptide at positions 1108 and 1109. Cleavage at the C terminus of the
   protease occurred with low efficiency at an ET dipeptide at positions
   1251 and 1252. To study the cleavage specificity of the protease, amino
   acid substitutions were introduced at the P2, P1, and P1' positions at
   the cleavage site at the N-terminal boundary of the protease. This
   analysis showed that the amino acid at the P1 position is the most
   important determinant for substrate recognition. Only glutamic acid,
   glutamine, and aspartic acid were tolerated at this position. At the P1'
   position, glycine, serine, and alanine were the preferred substrates of
   the protease, but a number of amino acids with larger side chains were
   also tolerated. Substitutions at the P2 position had only little effect
   on the cleavage efficiency. Cell-free expression of the C-terminal half
   of the ORF1 polyprotein showed that the protease catalyzes cleavage at
   the junction of the RNA polymerase and the capsid protein, An EG
   dipeptide at positions 1767 and 1768 was identified as the putative
   cleavage site. Our data show that rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus
   encodes a trypsin-like cysteine protease that is similar to 3C proteases
   with regard to function and specificity but is more similar to 2A
   proteases with regard to size.},

   viraemia in serial blood samples collected from six pigs at lip to
   fourteen days after inoculation with classical swine fever vir rls. All
   ELISAs were of the double antibody sandwich type, using monoclonal
   and/or polyclonal antibodies to detect a variety of viral proteins in
   leukocytes, or in anti-coagulated blood or serum. Compared to virus
   isolation, specificity of the ELISA was good: only one sample found
   negative by virus isolation yielded a positive result in a single ELISA.
   Some false-negative results occurred with samples collected at up to
   eight days after inoculation, brit all rests Sound samples collected
   between nine and fourteen days post-inoculation to be positive. The
   ELISAs require less-specialised facilities and can be performed much
   more rapidly than virus isolation, They are therefore extremely
   promising tools for screening large numbers of live pigs.},

Abstract = {In Experiment 1, 48 goats from two breeds (Maltese and Rossa
   Mediterranea) received two levels of concentrate supplements (150 and
   550 g per head day(-1)) in a 2 x 2 factorial design. In Experiment 2,
   the concentrate levels were the same, but with two levels of crude
   protein (CP) for each concentrate level (16.7\% and 38.5\% CP, and
   11.6\% and 16.7\% CP, respectively). At low or high concentrate level,
   the net energy (NE)/CP ratio was the same. There was no significant
   difference between Maltese and Rossa Mediterranea breeds in milk yield
   and composition, although fat content tended to be higher in Rossa
   Mediterranea. Energy and N balance, body condition and blood parameters
   did not differ between breeds. Concentrate levels did not alter milk
   production significantly: 40 kg and 30 kg in Experiment 1 and 2,
   respectively, i.e, 1 kg and 0.7 kg milk were produced per kilogram of
   concentrate. Protein supplements did not improve milk production. The
   group at high protein level had a trend towards reduced milk production
   as a consequence of reduced ingestion from pasture, In grazing
   conditions of southern Italy, concentrates supplied at the level of 550
   g might be economical depending on their price compared with that of
   milk and cheese. However, protein supplementation did not increase milk
   yield, and was therefore of no economic value.},

   ranging from 1:100 to 1:6400, against a serovar (hardjo) belonging to
   the Sejroe serogroup, were detected by the microscopic agglutination
   test (MAT) in the serum of the 19 dogs with interstitial nephritis. All
   animals without renal lesions were seronegative. Leptospiral antigen was
   detected immunohistochemically in the kidneys of 4 dogs; leptospires
   were detected in Warthin-Starry stained sections of one dog. Leptospires
   were isolated from the kidneys of 3 of the 4 dogs examined by bacterial
   culture. The isolated strains were typed as serovar sejroe by
   restriction endonuclease digestion and Southern blot hybridization
   analysis of their DNA. It was concluded that Leptospira interrogans
   serovar sejroe, was responsible for an asymptomatic chronic renal
   infection which was widespread in this group of laboratory dogs.},

Abstract = {Nine outbreaks of a disease affecting 2 to 5-month-old guinea fowl,
   characterized by slight depression and sudden deaths, are described.
   Gross haemorrhages in the serosa and muscles were constantly observed.
   Histologically nuclear inclusion bodies, similar to those observed in
   avian adenovirosis group II were detected in the spleen of affected
   animals. Electron microscopic examination revealed the presence of
   adenovirus particles in spleen ultra-thin sections. The agar-gel
   immunodiffusion test, carried out on the sera from one outbreak,
   demonstrated reacting antibodies with haemorrhagic enteritis virus of
   turkeys. The disease was experimentally reproduced inoculating
   35-day-old guinea fowl with spleen homogenate from affected animals.},

Abstract = {A population of mononuclear cytotoxic cells from peripheral blood
   leucocytes of cattle showed no usual markers of B and T lymphocytes.
   However, it could be allocated to a previously unreported gamma delta T
   cell compartment. This assumption was suggested by: 1. The surface
   expression of CD3; 2. PCR amplification of the C delta TcR gene from
   cDNA; and 3. The detection of peripheral blood precursors expressing the
   workshop cluster (WC) 1 marker of bovine gamma delta T cells. These
   cells are recognized by murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 5D4, 1E7,
   6F9 and 8D7, raised in the authors' laboratory. The above mAbs also
   identify distinct groups of cells in thymus, spleen, lymph nodes and
   about 1 \% of uncultured PBL. The most diffuse infiltration of such
   cells was shown in the small intestine, as both intraepithelial and
   lamina propria lymphocytes. Mucosal homing activity was confirmed by
   immunoperoxidase staining on tongue and pharynx sections of healthy
   cattle.},

Abstract = {Conventional methods for Salmonella detection in foods can require up to
   6 and at least 4 days, We have observed that the total analysis time can
   be reduced to 48 h by using Salmosyst broth as a liquid medium for both
   preenrichment and selective enrichment and Rambach agar (RA), a new
   selective plate medium, In samples of artificially contaminated ground
   beef Salmonella enteritidis was detected at a concentration of 0.4 CFU/g
   (10 CFU/25 g) by both a conventional method and the new method, Of 519
   samples of foods for sale, 38 were Salmonella positive by both methods
   while 471 were negative, Nine samples which were negative by the
   conventional method were positive by the Salmosyst-RA method, while one
   sample positive by the first method was negative by the last. Therefore,
   the Salmosyst-RA method showed 97.9\% sensitivity compared with the
   81.2\% sensitivity of the conventional method, The new method was also
   highly specific (98\% specificity) in presumptive identification of
   Salmonella colonies. Furthermore, a 6-h preenrichment in Salmosyst broth
   has been proved sufficient for the repair of heat-injured Salmonella
   cells and for subsequent recovery by selective enrichment, In
   conclusion, the Salmosyst-RA method shows several advantages over both
   conventional acid rapid noncultural methods: (i) only two media are
   required instead of the five media for conventional methods; (ii) in
   real time it is comparable to other rapid noncultural methods, which
   require 30 to 31 h; (iii) it is highly sensitive and specific; and (iv)
   it allows the isolation of Salmonella strains which can be characterized
   by appropriate phenotypic and genotypic typing methods for
   epidemiological investigations.},

Abstract = {Effects of liquid whey (6.5\% total solids) feeding to 54 Alpine and
   Saanen goats on milk yield and quality, was evaluated on a dairy farm in
   the Appennine mountains. Individual milk yield and composition of milk
   fat, protein, lactose and somatic cell counts were determined. Bulk milk
   samples were evaluated for renneting properties of milk (T, K-10 and
   E(30)). Individual liquid whey intake was 5.5 kg day(-1) (360 g dry
   matter intake (DMI)) and total mixed ration intake was 2010 g DMI
   day(-1) and 2170 g DMI day(-1) for test and control groups,
   respectively. Daily milk yield and fat content of the test group were
   significantly (P < 0.05) higher than those of the control group (2.88 vs
   2.65 kg day(-1) and 2.89 vs 2.72\%). Coagulation time (T) and curd
   firmness (E(30)) was significantly (P < 0.05) better in the test group
   compared with the controls (T: 22.7 vs 28.6 min; E(30): 28.7 vs 22.5

Abstract = {A virus, strain 583, was isolated from carpione Salmo trutta carpio fry
   exhibiting high mortality. The virus was not neutralized by rabbit
   antisera against the fish rhabdbviruses viral haemorrhagic septicaemia
   virus (VHSV), infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus, eel rhabdovirus
   European X, spring viraemia of carp virus or pike fry rhabdovirus, or
   against the birnavirus infectious pancreatic necrosis virus. The virus
   replicated in several fish cell lines incubated at 20 to 25 degrees C
   and grew optimally in the bluegill fry (BF-2) and fathead minnow (FHM)
   cell lines. Electron microscopy of infected BF-2 cell cultures revealed
   the presence of typical rhabdovirus particles, and immunofluorescent
   staining was observed using various polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies
   (MAbs) against Egtved virus, the causative agent of viral haemorrhagic
   septicaemia. The staining by a MAb against the nucleoprotein (N) of VHSV
   was particularly strong, a MAb against the glycoprotein (G) gave a
   moderate reaction, whereas a second MAb against the G protein and MAbs
   against the matrix proteins, M(1) and M(2), of VHSV did not react.
   Fluorescence titres using 3 rabbit antisera against whole Egtved virus
   varied between negative and moderately positive. Western blotting using
   polyclonal and monoclonal sera confirmed that both the N and G proteins
   of the carpione virus shared some epitopes with those of VHSV, but the
   M(1) and M(2) proteins did not. SDS-PAGE showed the structural proteins
   of the carpione virus produced a pattern typical of members of the
   Lyssavirus genus of the Rhabdoviridae and the molecular weights were
   very similar to those of VHSV, except for the M(2) protein which was
   somewhat smaller. Infection trials showed the carpione virus induced
   high mortalities in carpione fry but not in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus
   mykiss fry. The carpione virus was clearly distinguishable from Egtved
   virus despite limited serological cross reaction. Since it was also
   easily distinguishable by immunofluorescence from the other fish
   rhabdoviruses included in the present study as well as in studies
   published elsewhere, it is concluded that the virus is a previously
   undescribed one. It is proposed that the virus be given the preliminary
   designation `carpione rhabdovirus'.},

Abstract = {Two novel formats of ELISA for the detection of antibodies against swine
   vesicular disease (SVD) virus were developed. One of the tests described
   is a monoclonal antibody-based competitive ELISA (MAC-ELISA). In this
   test, specific antibodies in serum are detected due to their ability to
   compete with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MAb). The second is an
   indirect trapping ELISA which employs isotype-specific MAbs to detect
   swine IgG or IgM specific for SVD virus. The diagnostic sensitivity and
   specificity of the MAC-ELISA was studied on 5671 field sera of known
   origin, enabling the cut-off level to be defined. Using the MAC-ELISA,
   100\% of sera from infected pigs were found positive, whereas only
   0.45\% of negative sera gave a false-positive result. A positive
   correlation between MAC-ELISA and virus neutralizing titres was recorded
   for pig sera collected sequentially after experimental infections. The
   results from the isotype-specific ELISA revealed the dynamics of the
   antibody response to SVD virus in pigs. The first antibodies were
   detectable as early as 3 days after experimental infection. Up to the
   10th day, demonstrable antibodies were exclusively of the IgM class. IgG
   developed later, between 11 and 14 days postinfection and remained at a
   plateaux level throughout the whole investigation period. The two tests
   satisfy different diagnostic requirements: the MAC-ELISA is useful as a
   screening test, the isotype-specific ELISA has potential application for
   the determination of stage of infection. Both tests benefit from the use
   of MAbs in terms of specificity and standardization and have advantages
   over the virus neutralization test.},

   showed a reduced virulence for some susceptible animal species
   (chickens, mice, rabbits, calves, lambs and piglets) and virus was
   isolated sporadically. The mutant viruses appeared to be able to protect
   animals against infection with the virulent strain of PRV.
   At gross, as well as at histological examination, no lesions in
   apparatus, system and tissues were detected in pigs inoculated with 6A1
   and 6C2 viruses. By contrast, rabbits treated with 6C2 mutant strain
   presented lymphomononucleated cuffs, microgliosis, and neuronophagia in
   some areas of the brain. This focal spreading, together with the absence
   of neuronal necrosis and intranuclear inclusions, suggest an infection
   induced by a modified strain of PRV.},

Abstract = {The efficacy of an immunomodulator, the Baypamun (Bayer AG), was tested
   in calves which were subsequently exposed to bovine herpesvirus-1
   (BHV-1) infection.  Two groups of calves, of 8 animals each, were used
   for two trials.  In one trial, 4 calves were treated with the
   immunomodulator and the remaining 4 were left as untreated controls. 
   Two hours after the first injection of Baypamun, all calves, i.e. the
   treated and the untreated ones, were challenged with BHV-1.  Comparing
   them to the untreated controls, the calves which were given the
   immunomodulator developed milder signs of the disease and shed a
   significantly lower concentration of virus.  In the second experiment, 4
   calves were given Baypamun and 4 calves were not, as above, but they
   were not inoculated with BHV-1; however, they were housed together with
   the calves of the former group (experimentally infected with BHV-1). 
   The 8 calves all became infected but those that had been treated with
   Baypamun did not show any clinical signs of the disease, whereas the
   untreated calves underwent a clinical response which was considered to
   be typical of BHV-1 respiratory infection, as usually seen under natural
   conditions.  In this case the shedding of virus by the calves treated
   with the immunomodultor also underwent a significant reduction.},

Abstract = {The performances of three enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs)
   and one radioimmunoassay (RIA) in 17 alpha-19-nortestosterone (17
   alpha-19-NT) analysis of bovine urine have been evaluated. Sample
   preparation was performed by enzymic deconjugation and solid-phase
   extraction. The main object of the study was the evaluation of the
   matrix effect, which is generally great in 19-NT immunoassays.
   Fifty-seven bovine urine samples have been analysed by immunoassay and
   by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The defection limit of
   GC-MS analysis was 1 mu g l(-1). The mean sample blank values in urine
   analysis were close to 1.5 mu g l(-1) for one ELISA, and 0.4-0.8 mu g
   l(-1) for the other assays (n = 55, samples coming from several breeds
   in different geographic areas). The detection limits, calculated in
   compliance to the EEC criteria, were 2.67, 1.97, 2.05 and 5.01 mu g
   l(-1) for RIA, ELISAs 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The percentage of fate
   positive results adopting this criteria were: 1.8, 3.6, 1.8 and 3.6\%.
   The probability of the occurrence of false negative results was
   evaluated by adding 2 mu g l(-1) of 19-NT to a negative sample, was high
   in each assay, Two;samples from experimentally treated animals gave
   positive results both in GC-MS and in immunoassays. The results obtained
   confirm that be employing immunoassay and solid-phase extraction as
   sample clean-up, it is not possible to apply the action level (2 ppb)
   suggested by the European Union (EU).},

Abstract = {A distinct population of bovine gamma delta T cells was isolated from
   peripheral blood mononuclear cells of foot-and-mouth disease
   (FMD)-vaccinated cattle; these lymphocytes were show to exert a natural
   killer-like activity against cells infected by different viruses. The
   antiviral activity was dependent upon cognate recognition of target
   cells and could operate by both cytostatic and cytotoxic mechanisms.
   Among these, secretion of a serine esterase was shown after binding to
   target cells. This population of bovine gamma delta T cells is
   recognized by murine monoclonal antibodies 1E7, 5D4, and 6F9, raised ino
   ur laboratory. To define an in vivo antiviral role, four heifers were
   infected with a strain of bovid herpesvirus 1 by the
   intrasnal/intravaginal routes and contact exposure. The prevalence of
   1E7(+)/5D4(+) cells among peripheral blood lymphocytes increased
   dramatically in the first days after infection; the same held true for
   in-contact cattle, albeit with a different time kinetics. In another
   experiment, colonization of mucosae was demonstrated by immunoperoxidase
   staining on tongue and palate sections of healthy cattle. The
   infiltration of gamma delta T cells altogether in the palate mucosa was
   much more accentuated in foot-and-mouth disease-vaccinated, as compared
   to nonvaccinated, control calves.},

Abstract = {The detection of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV)-persistent carriers
   among convalescent ruminants is of paramount importance in the aftermath
   of a field outbreak To this purpose, FMDV-specific antibody should be
   investigated first, since virus isolation procedures from such carriers
   are seriously constrained. The complexity of the overall picture may be
   compounded by possible emergency vaccinations in the affected areas at
   the beginning of the outbreak. In this case, it is suggested that
   mucosal rather than serum antibody be investigated. In fact, we showed
   that FMDV-infected cattle regularly mount an antibody response in
   oropharyngeal fluids, in contrast to vaccinated cattle. Antibody could
   be revealed by neutralization assays and/or an immunoglobulin A
   (IgA)-specific kinetic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cattle
   vaccinated once seldom showed a mucosal antibody response, which could
   be only detected by a total immunoglobulin-specific kinetic ELISA. Very
   few, if any, cattle showed a mucosal IgA response after repeated
   vaccinations. Our kinetic, IgA-specific ELISA generally allowed an early
   detection of FMDV-infected cattle; in particular, it proved to be more
   sensitive than the usual indirect, antigen-trapping ELISA in experiments
   on saliva samples.},

Abstract = {In order to provide suggestions for conservation and management of the
   wolf Canis lupus Linnaeus, 1758 in Italy, a total of 46 wolves from
   central Italy and 53 mongrel dogs were surveyed for electrophoretic
   variation within and among populations. Six out of 41 presumptive gene
   loci exhibited polymorphism in the wolf (P = proportion of polymorphic
   loci = 0.146, 99 per cent criterion), whilst only 3 loci were variable
   in the dog (P = 0.073). Expected average heterozygosity in the Italian
   wolf (mean He = 0.037) was comparable to values reported previously for
   protein variation in natural wolf populations. By contrast, the dog
   showed a comparatively low heterozygosity (mean H-e = 0.020), which may
   be a consequence of domestication. Nei's (1978) absolute genetic
   distance between wolf and dog (D = 0.012) was very similar to values
   reported in previous investigations, thus confirming that they are
   closely related forms. Relative genetic differentiation (Wright's F-ST =
   0.167) between wolf and dog was considerably higher than the mean
   genetic diversity found among several dog breeds. The results of the
   present genetic investigation on the wolf population from central Italy
   suggested that its genetic resources are quite intact. The extent of
   differences in allelic frequencies at loci polymorphic both in wolf and
   dog did not suggest substantial wolf-dog interbreeding, which has been
   thought to be one of the major threats to the genetic integrity of the
   Italian wolf population.},

Abstract = {19-Nortestosterone (19-NT) is one of the mostly recurrent anabolic
   agents on the black market of illicit drugs. Dexamethasone (DEXA) is
   licensed for therapy in veterinary practice but its misuse, although
   often suspected, has seldom been demonstrated. The excretion of 19-NT
   and DEXA is well documented when the compounds are administered
   independently but poor information is available in literature for
   instances when both drugs are administered as a mixture. To evaluate a
   radioimmunoassay (RIA) for anabolic residues in urine, blood and faeces,
   the effect of the simultaneous administration and the subsequent
   elimination of the two drugs, two animals were injected (4 times) with
   19-NT and another two (4 times) with 19-NT-DEXA. After preparation and a
   sequential clean-up on C-18 and alumina columns, the samples were
   analysed by means of a specific 19-NT radioimmunoassay kit and an
   anti-DEXA antibody. Detection limits for both drugs were 0.5 ppb in
   blood samples and 2.0 ppb in urine and faecal samples. After the final
   treatment, positive 19-NT results were recorded at 14 and 21 d in urine
   and faecal samples, respectively. In the same matrices, positive DEXA
   values were found at 11 and 28 d, respectively. Urinary excretion was
   the main metabolic path both for 19-NT and DEXA; only 30\% of the
   residues were excreted via the faeces. The simultaneous injection of
   DEXA and 19-NT increased the urinary excretion of 19-NT; however, the
   excretion of 19-NT via faecal matter was similar for both groups.},

Abstract = {Two pairs of oligonucleotide primers were designed that specifically
   amplified regions of the classical swine fever virus genome. These
   products, corresponding to a 671 bp portion of the genes encoding the El
   and E2 (gp33 and gp55) proteins and a 1090 bp portion of the putative
   polymerase gene, were amplified from eight virus isolates which had been
   responsible for a series of classical swine fever outbreaks in Italy
   involving both domestic pigs and wild boar. For each virus the fragments
   were partially sequenced to give 475 bp of the E1/E2 glycoprotein and
   212 bp of the putative polymerase gene sequences. The data from each set
   of fragments were compared with one another and with reference strains.
   This allowed us confidently to assign most of the viruses to one of
   three subgroups. An analysis of the same viruses with a panel of
   monoclonal antibodies was much less informative. The subgrouping of the
   isolates suggested that, in this region of Italy, there had been at
   least two separate introductions of classical swine fever over a 7 year
   period and that virus had been transmitted between domestic pigs and
   wild boar. A consensus nucleotide sequence derived from the glycoprotein
   fragments of all the viruses examined revealed conservation at the
   wobble position of some codons.},

Abstract = {Expression studies conducted in vitro and in Escherichia coli led to the
   identification of a protease from rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus
   (RHDV). The gene coding for this protease was found to be located in the
   central part of the genome preceding the putative RNA polymerase gene.
   It was demonstrated that the protease specifically cuts RHDV polyprotein
   substrates both in cis and in trans. Site directed mutagenesis
   experiments revealed that the RHDV protease closely resembles the 3C
   proteases of picornaviruses with respect to the amino acids directly
   involved in the catalytic activity as well as to the role played by
   histidine as part of the substrate binding pocket.},

Abstract = {Objective. To investigate the immunohistological distribution of
   beta(2)-glycoprotein I (beta(2)GPI) and placental anticoagulant protein
   I (PAP-I) in normal and pathological placentae of patients with
   antiphospholipid (aPL) antibody associated recurrent fetal loss. These
   proteins are 2 natural anticoagulants able to interfere with aPL
   antibody binding.
   Methods. Placentae from 4 patients with primary antiphospholipid
   antibody syndrome (pAPS), from 2 patients with aPL negative systemic
   lupus erythematosus (SLE) and from 7 healthy women were studied.
   Cryostatic placental sections were tested by indirect immunofluorescence
   using polyclonal anti-PAP-I and anti-beta(2)GPI antisera as well as
   purified IgG and anti-beta(2)GPI monoclonal antibody. The same tissue
   sections were also tested by direct immunofluorescence with
   FITC-F(ab)(2) goat antihuman IgG.
   Results. We found that (a) the placental distribution of PAP-I was
   comparable in normal and pathological specimens; (b) on the contrary,
   increased beta(2)GPI deposition was present on the trophoblast surfaces
   of placentae obtained from patients with persistent raised titers of aPL
   antibodies. Comparable IgG deposition on villi surface was also found in
   aPL positive but not in control placentae.
   Conclusion. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that high titer
   aPL binds to a beta(2)GPI phospholipid complex in placentae of women
   with recurrent fetal loss but that a quantitative deficiency of PAR-I
   does not play a pathogenetic role in aPL associated fetal loss.},

Abstract = {Between August 1988 and August 1991, 456 carcasses of captive or
   sylvatic hares from several areas of northern Italy, and 931 sera taken
   from adult hares in farms, in hunting and natural reserves and on
   importation were examined using virological (sandwich enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay {[}ELISA] and immuno-electron microscopy) and
   serological (competition ELISA) tests.  The epidemiological data
   presented relate to the incidence of European brown hare syndrome (EBHS)
   in various provinces of northern Italy, the mortality caused by EBHS and
   the seasonal frequency of this disease.  The endemic character of EBHS
   in Italy is proved by the large number of samples testing positive for
   EBHS virus (EBHSV) (47.6\%) and by the results of the
   seroepidemiological survey, in which approximately 95\% of samples
   tested positive for specific anti-EBHSV antibodies, showing varying
   titres according to the different environmental conditions.},

Abstract = {A field trial was set up to evaluate the effect of human lymphoblastoid
   interferon (IFN) as a biological response modifier (BRM) in cattle. Two
   different doses (100 and 1000 International Units/kg body weight) of
   partially purified interferon from Namalwa cells were administered to
   suckling calves, after animals were introduced into a large veal
   fattening and finishing unit. The clinical conditions of the calves and
   some parameters of specific and non-specific immunity, along with the
   individual weights, were evaluated over a 4-month period. The higher IFN
   dose correlated with a favourable clinical response of calves to a
   respiratory syndrome; this was further substantiated by a dramatic
   improvement of the growth rate with respect to control calves. To a
   lesser extent, this also occurred in calves given the lower IFN dose.
   These results suggest better disease resistance in IFN-treated calves,
   possible associated with dose-dependent regulation of basic homeostatic
   functions.},

Abstract = {This review summarizes the results of a study on rotaviruses isolated
   from calves affected by neonatal diarrhea.
   The results indicated that rotavirus infection is widespread and
   supported the evidence for an etiologic role of these viruses in
   neonatal diarrhea.  Differences in virulence among bovine rotaviruses
   appeared also to be confirmed.
   Conventionally reared calves were fully susceptible to the experimental
   infection induced by rotaviruses originating from heterologous hosts,
   i.e. monkeys, pigs and rabbits.
   When rotavirus strains of bovine, simian and rabbit origin were compared
   by cross neutralization tests, it was found the simian and porcine
   strains were indistinguishable and both appeared to relate antigenically
   to the bovine strain.
   Finally, it was proven that feeding newborn calves with colostrum and
   first milk of their dams, previously vaccinated with an inactivated
   adjuvanted rotavirus vaccine, could prevent the neonatal diarrhea from
   occurring.},

Abstract = {Monoclonal antibodies directed against the capsid protein of rabbit
   hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) were used to identify field cases of
   European brown hare syndrome (EBHS) and to distinguish between RHDV and
   the virus responsible for EBHS. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis of
   liver extract of an EBHS virus (EBHSV)-infected hare revealed a single
   major capsid protein species of approximately 60 kDa that shared
   epitopes with the capsid protein of RHDV. RNA isolated from the liver of
   an EBHSV-infected hare contained two viral RNA species of 7.5 and 2.2 kb
   that comigrated with the genomic and subgenomic RNAs of RHDV and were
   recognized by labeled RHDV cDNA in Northern (RNA) hybridizations. The
   nucleotide sequence of the 3' 2.8 kb of the EBHSV genome was determined
   from four overlapping cDNA clones. Sequence analysis revealed an open
   reading frame that contains part of the putative RNA polymerase gene and
   the complete capsid protein gene. This particular genome organization is
   shared by RHDV but not by other known caliciviruses. The deduced amino
   acid sequence of the capsid protein of EBHSV was compared with the
   capsid protein sequences of RHDV and other caliciviruses. The amino acid
   sequence comparisons revealed that EBHSV is closely related to RHDV and
   distantly related to other caliciviruses. On the basis of their genome
   organization, it is suggested that caliciviruses be divided into three
   groups.},

Abstract = {Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), by nature of its RNA genome,
   possesses a high rate of mutation during replication. This results in
   extensive genetic polymorphism of virus populations in nature. The
   emergence of FMDV variants during replication has been reported. Genetic
   changes in the viral capsid protein (VP1) gene can result in amino acid
   changes affecting the immunodominant epitopes of FMDV. The genetic
   heterogeneity of FMDV in the field and the antigenic variants observed
   after cell culture isolation has been investigated by PCR sequencing and
   reactivity with monoclonal antibodies. These methods were applied to
   viruses causing two different outbreaks of FMD before and after
   replication in cell culture and in the animal host. The VP1 region of
   the genome was amplified by PCR and sequenced to reveal variant
   sequences identified after passage and to determine their presence in
   the original field tissue. In one case, reactivity with monoclonal
   antibodies was lost after passage as a result of an amino acid change in
   the subpopulation. These findings suggest that host cells can select
   specific virus genetic and antigenic subpopulations during virus
   isolation and propagation.},

Abstract = {Restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) with three enzymes SmaI, PstI,
   BamHI- was used to identify 13 different genomic groups among 37
   Mycoplasma bovis strains. One genomic group was comprised of 14 strains.
   Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
   patterns for one strain chosen from each genomic group and an
   international reference strain PG45 were all similar. Antigenic
   variability in M. bovis species was investigated by immunoblotting,
   using serum from a calf that had been naturally infected with M. bovis
   and three M. bovis-specific monoclonal antibodies - mAbs N-2, I-2 and
   5D7. Twenty M. bovis field strains were tested, comprising one from each
   genomic group, six from the same genomic group and the reference strain.
   Antigenic profiles obtained with calf serum differed markedly one from
   the other, the heterogeneity being equally great among the strains
   belonging to the same genomic group as those coming from different
   groups. A stable antigen common to 164 out of 168 strains was detected
   by mAb N-2, whilst with mAbs I-2 and 5D7, two different membrane
   antigenic systems were demonstrated that were strikingly variable. These
   variations in expression occurred not only from one strain to another,
   but also within the same lineage of clones from a single cell.},

Abstract = {A protocol for efficient electrotransformation of Streptococcus
   agalactiae (group B streptococcus) Lancefield's strain O90R (NTCT 9993)
   (an unencapsulated derivative of type Ia strain O90) was developed. The
   Escherichia coli-Streptococcus shuttle vector pDP28 (7.8 kb) carrying
   the ermB gene for resistance to erythromycin was used as donor DNA.
   Frozen `electrocompetent' cells were prepared by repeated washes in 10\%
   glycerol. A 50-mu l aliquot containing about 5 X 10(9) colony forming
   units of bacteria was subjected to the electric pulse. Optimal
   conditions for electrotransformation were determined using different
   media, harvesting cells at different points of the growth curve, and
   using different field strengths. The dose-response curve for
   transformation of S. agalactiae with pDP28 showed one-hit kinetics as
   donor DNA varied between 0.01 and 3 mu g. The efficiency of
   electrotransformation for this range of amounts of donor DNA was 1.2 x
   10(4) cfu mu g(-1). The transformation frequencies obtained with this
   electroporation protocol are high enough to allow both subcloning and
   shotgun cloning of streptococcal DNA in S. agalactiae.},

Abstract = {Fourteen dogs which had died from acute leptospirosis, three dogs which
   survived an acute attack of leptospirosis and seven healthy dogs living
   in close contact with the animals which died were examined for the

   test. Twelve dogs had titres of 1:3200 or greater. The predominant titre
   was directed against serovar bratislava in seven cases, serovar
   grippothyphosa in two cases and both these serovars in two cases. In one
   case the predominant titre was directed against serovars bratislava,
   grippothyphosa, copenhageni (serogroup icterohaemorrhagiae) and pomona.
   The present study and other recent reports suggest that the epidemiology

   Savio, s. Tagliabue, and C. Rossi, J. Clin. Microbiol. 30:1243-1249,
   1992). A specific DNA fragment was amplified from the genomic DNAs of
   serovar hardjo type hardjoprajitno and nine serovars also belonging to
   L. interrogans is a consequence of the spread of the same or a closely
   related repetitive element within this species (Pacciarini et al., J.
   Clin. Microbiol. 30:1243-1249, 1992). In addition, specific
   amplification was obtained from two Leptospira borgpetersenii serovars
   (tarassovi and hardjo type hardjobovis). Negative PCR results were
   observed with all of the other Leptospira serovars tested, including
   nonpathogenic ones (serovars patoc and andamana), another spirochete
   (Borrelia burgdorferi), bacteria commonly found in biological samples,
   and swine and bovine cell lines. Direct PCR on biological samples such
   as kidney samples demonstrated that preliminary isolation and culture of
   Leptospira cells are not required for efficient detection. Furthermore,
   digestion of the amplified DNA with the enzymes HinfI and DdeI yielded
   specific polymorphic patterns, allowing discrimination among the
   majority of the serovars. These methods were applied to 25 field
   isolates of serovar pomona, leading to the conclusion that they were
   suitable for the simple and rapid detection of L. interrogans and for
   serovar identification.},

Abstract = {A serological survey was carried out to establish the distribution of
   classical swine fever among wild boar in Sardinia, where that disease
   and African swine fever have been endemic in free-ranging domestic pigs
   and wild boar living in the mountainous areas of the province of Nuoro
   for several years. Blood samples were collected from 4752 wild boar shot
   during the period December 1988 to January 1992. An overall prevalence
   of 11 per cent was observed and the almost constant rate of about 98 per
   cent detected in the past three years indicates that the infection is
   well established. Wild boar seropositive to classical swine fever were
   found not only in the areas of the province of Nuoro where they share
   their habitat with free-ranging domestic pigs but also in other areas of
   the island where contacts between wild and domestic pigs are unlikely to
   occur. Therefore, transmission from wild boar to mild boar seems to play
   an important role in the spread and persistence of classical swine fever
   virus. In contrast, African swine fever virus is probably unable to
   persist in the wild boar population in the absence of the risk factor
   represented by their cohabitation with domestic free-ranging pigs
   infected with African swine fever.},

Abstract = {Background: Picornaviruses are responsible for a wide range of mammalian
   diseases and, in common with other RNA viruses, show considerable
   antigenic variation. Foot-and-mouth disease viruses (FMDVs) constitute
   one genus of the picornavirus family and are classified into seven
   serotypes, each of which shows considerable intratypic variation. This
   antigenic variation leads to continuing difficulties in controlling the
   disease. To date the structure of only one serotype, O, has been
   reported.
   Results: The three-dimensional structure of a serotype C (isolate
   C-S8c1) FMDV, has been determined crystallographically at 3.5 angstrom
   resolution. The main chain conformation of the virion is very similar to
   that of type O1 virus. The immunodominant G-H loop of VP1, the presumed
   site of cell attachment, is disordered in both types of virus indicating
   a functional role for flexibility of this region. There are significant
   changes in the structure of other antigenic loops and in some internal
   regions involved in protomer-protomer contacts, including the entire
   amino-terminal portion of VP2, described here for the first time for a
   picornavirus. Antigenic sites have been identified by genetic and
   peptide mapping methods, and located on the capsid. The data reveal a
   major new discontinuous antigenic site (site D) which is located near to
   the three-fold axis and involves residues of VP1, VP2 and VP3 which lie
   adjacent to each other on the capsid.
   Conclusion: In FMDV type C, amino acid substitutions seen in mutants
   that are resistant to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) map
   to predominantly surface-oriented residues with solvent-accessible
   side-chains not involved in interactions with other amino acids, whereas
   residues which are accessible but not substituted are found to be more
   frequently involved in protein-protein interactions. This provides a
   molecular interpretation for the repeated isolation of the same amino
   acid substitutions in MAb-resistant variants, an observation frequently
   made with RNA viruses. This first comparison of two FMDV serotypes shows
   how subtle changes at antigenic sites are sufficient to cause large
   changes in antigenic specificity between serotypes.},

Abstract = {BHK-21 suspension cells were characterized with regard to genetic and
   phenotypic features which might adversely affect the immunogenic
   properties of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) grown therein. A
   positive correlation was found between number of passages in suspension
   culture and both prevalence of polyploid cells and reduced cell growth
   on surfaces. Suspension cells also revealed differences in the
   expression of RGD-specific integrins and, in particular, of alpha 5 beta
   1, which was shown to work as an FMDV receptor structure. These
   features, along with the notable instability of a few non-structural
   FMDV A(5) proteins in infected cells, outline a new scenario, in which
   the reduced immunogenicity of FMDV might be accounted for by defined
   negative influences of the cell environment on viral replication.},

Abstract = {To investigate the possible mechanism of maintenance of old human
   influenza A (H3N2) viruses in pigs, the haemagglutinins (HAs) of seven
   isolates from swine were studied by analysis of nucleotide and deduced
   primary amino acid sequences, as well as reactivity of the HA molecule
   to chicken antisera and monoclonal antibodies. The swine HAs were
   closely similar to the HA of the A/Victoria/3/75 human variant as
   regards antigenic and molecular characteristics. These findings are
   consistent with the hypothesis that the swine HA genes were transmitted
   from an early human H3 virus to pigs, where they survived with limited
   mutations over a period of 5 years. The sequence data were also compared
   with swine H3 sequences to investigate genetic relationships between the
   H3 genes from swine viruses isolated in different geographical areas. An
   evolutionary tree, constructed from the nucleotide sequences of viruses
   isolated from pigs in China and in Italy, illustrated that, depending on
   the country of their isolation, the HA genes of swine influenza A (H3N2)
   viruses have different origins, e.g. human and avian, and evolved
   independently in different lineages. The study provides direct support
   for the hypothesis that pigs might serve as a `mixing vessel' for the
   generation of pandemic strains of human influenza viruses.},

Abstract = {The four-subunit DNA polymerase cy-primase complex is unique in its
   ability to synthesize DNA chains de novo, and some in vitro data suggest
   its involvement in initiation and elongation of chromosomal DNA
   replication, although direct in vivo evidence for a role in the
   initiation reaction is still lacking. The function of the B subunit of
   the complex is unknown, but the Saccharomyces cerevisiae POL12 gene,
   which encodes this protein, is essential for cell viability. We have
   produced different pol12 alleles by in vitro mutagenesis of the cloned
   gene. The in vivo analysis of our 18 pol12 alleles indicates that the
   conserved carboxy-terminal two-thirds of the protein contains regions
   that are essential for cell viability, while the more divergent
   NH2-terminal portion is partially dispensable. The characterization of
   the temperature-sensitive pol12-T9 mutant allele demonstrates that the B
   subunit is required for in vivo DNA synthesis and correct progression
   through S phase. Moreover, reciprocal shift experiments indicate that
   the POL12 gene product plays an essential role at the early stage of
   chromosomal DNA replication, before the hydroxyurea-sensitive step. A
   model for the role of the B subunit in initiation of DNA replication at
   an origin is presented.},

   using a direct immunofluorescence test on cytocentrifuged pleural and
   peritoneal effusions from cats sampled in vivo (11 cases) and at
   necropsy (10 cases). A commercial fluorescent polyclonal antiserum of
   feline origin reacting with FIPV and cross reacting with transmissible
   gastroenteritis virus and canine coronavirus was used. Eleven cats with
   ascites of a different origin were used as negative controls. The direct
   immunofluorescence test was 97 per cent reliable (31 cases of 32) and
   can be used in routine diagnosis.},

Abstract = {Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against various subclasses of
   immunoglobulin molecules are important reagents for the characterization
   and differentiation of serum immunoglobulins (Ig) generated during
   immune responses. Furthermore, Ig-specific mAbs can be powerful tools
   for the detection of B lymphocytes in blood and lymphoid organs. Here we
   describe two mAbs generated in our laboratories, named 1G6 and 2E8,
   which react with distinct epitopes on porcine immunoglobulin molecules.
   MAb 1G6 recognizes an epitope of an immunoglobulin chain with apparent
   molecular mass of 25 Kd. This chain represents an immunoglobulin light
   chain and might be the porcine equivalent of the murine and human kappa
   chain. MAb 2E8 is directed against porcine IgM molecules, recognizing an
   epitope of the porcine mu chain. The use of these mAbs was shown to
   avoid some common disadvantages of anti-Ig polyclonal antisera, like the
   high background staining of cells and tissue culture sections in
   immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, the use of these mAbs in two-color
   flow cytometry (FCM) versus a polyclonal anti-porcine Ig antiserum
   enables distinct B-lymphocyte subpopulations in blood and lymphoid
   organs to be detected. Our mAbs seem therefore to represent important
   and powerful reagents to identify and characterize porcine Ig isotypes
   and surface-Ig positive porcine B lymphocytes; their discriminating
   power between distinct B lymphocyte subpopulations could prove useful in
   different fields of both applied fundamental immunological research},

Abstract = {Nearly 150 strains of Bifidobacterium globosum were isolated from faeces

   and from human infant faeces between 1962 and 1973 and scored by
   SDS-PAGE for the presence of cell-wall-related proteins, i.e. BIFOP
   (bifid outer proteins); their apparent molecular masses ranged from 94.5
   to 34 kDa and were designated A to L. Purified preparations from six of
   these ten proteins were employed to produce polyclonal rabbit antisera
   for use in immunoblots to investigate the interrelationships of the
   major antigens, A, B and C (94.5-85.5 kDa) and their distribution in
   strains of various origin. Two antigens differently migrating (or
   polymorphic forms) reacted with anti-BIFOP F serum (called F- and F+);
   the identity of BIFOP E with respect to these antigens was studied with
   anti-E serum. Only one antigen in all strain preparations reacted to
   anti-BIFOP H serum, which was raised against an antigen purified from a
   13.5-MDa plasmid-bearing strain from rumen.},

Abstract = {An inactivated bovine rotavirus vaccine, prepared with an adjuvant which
   gives a water-in-oil emulsion (Montanide ISA 50, adjuvant) was used in
   field trials for prevention of calf neonatal diarrhoea.
   The vaccine, which was designated as Romovac 50, when injected into cows
   in their last month of pregnancy, proved to be as effective as the
   traditional vaccine prepared with Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Thus,
   the incidence of the naturally occurring neonatal diarrhoea was
   significantly reduced in calves which were fed mammary secretion from
   their vaccinated dams, compared to the calves delivered from the
   unvaccinated cows.
   Romovac 50 also has the advantages over the traditional Freund's
   adjuvanted vaccine in that it is less viscous and thus more readily
   injected and less irritant to tissues.},

   Virus was isolated from leucocytes and nasal swabs until PID 4, from
   rectal swabs until PID 2 and, in the pigs found dead at PID 2, from
   several organs. EMC virus was further isolated from brain and spleen of
   the pig sacrificed at PID 7. One of the 2 control pigs became infected:
   virus was isolated from nasal swabs at days 6 and 7 and from leucocytes
   at day 4 of the experiment. Serum-neutralizing (SN) antibody was
   detected in the injected pigs starting from PID 4; two days later, it
   was also revealed in the infected, in-contact control. To our knowledge,
   this is the first report of an experimental transmission of EMC virus
   infection in pigs by contact exposure.},

Abstract = {The food habits and dietary overlap of the Wolf and the Red fox were
   studied in an area of the Abruzzo National Park, Central Apennines
   (Italy), over a period of two years. The Wolf preyed mainly upon wild
   and domestic ungulates. The occurrence of Red deer in diet exceeded that
   of the Roe deer, parallel to the relative local abundance of these
   species. Although the consumption of reintroduced deer species increased
   during the study period, no corresponding decrease of predation on
   livestock could be assessed. The diet of the Wolf did not show seasonal
   variations in the study area, whereas that of the Fox did. The use of
   different trophic resources by these two Carnivores was likely to
   generate such a difference, the former taking prey steadily available
   throughout the year, while the latter makes use of seasonally
   fluctuating food resources (e.g. rodents and fruits). The dependence on
   anthropogenic food resources was noticeable for the Wolf, but mainly
   restricted to domestic ungulates, and negligible for the Fox. Food
   competition between these two Carnivores is unlikely in well preserved
   habitats. where they can fill different trophic niches.},

Abstract = {Salmonella abortusovis is a pathogenic bacterium highly specific to
   sheep, causing spontaneous abortion. In order to understand the role of
   genes involved in pathogenicity, we investigated S. abortusovis with the
   random mutagenic TnphoA transposon. A total of 95 S. abortusovis TnphoA
   mutants yielding alkaline phosphatase active fusion protein were
   obtained. In this way we created a bank of strains in order to identify
   any phenotypic modification which could affect the periplasmic and/or
   exported proteins involved in virulence. The TnphoA mutants were
   screened for the ability to adhere to epithelial cells: a total of 23
   mutant strains lost this phenotypic feature. To detect the chromosomal
   TnphoA insertions, DNA was restricted by the enzyme EcoRV, which does
   not cleave the TnphoA sequence. Southern blotting analysis revealed the
   existence of four classes of integration. Colonies of adhesiveless
   mutants appear to be as smooth as the S. abonusovis wild type, and
   electrophoretic analysis indicates a normal lipopolysaccharide profile.
   To identify mutations affecting genes encoding for outer membrane
   proteins (OMPs), the alkaline phosphatase portion of the fusion proteins
   was revealed in TnphoA mutants by immunoblotting with specific
   antibodies. A mutation in OMPs was detected in seven mutants.
   Restriction analysis identified in four mutants a common region of 2 kb
   where alterations in genes coding for OMPs occur. We suggested that this
   region is involved in pathogenicity in mice, since a group of mutant
   strains has shown reduced virulence in mice and one mutant is completely
   avirulent. Furthermore, after mice were exposed orally to these mutants,
   significant protection against oral challenge with the parental virulent
   strain resulted.},

Abstract = {The application and the results of a commercially available

   because it allows very rapid multi-analyte detection without extraction.
   Beta-Agonists such as clenbuterol, mabuterol, salbutamol and terbutaline
   can be detected in bovine urine with a decision limit of 0.6, 0.9, 1.6
   and 2.5 ng ml-1, respectively, Confirmation of positive ELISA results
   concerning the presence of clenbuterol and salbutamol was made by liquid
   chromatography and by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, with
   immunoaffinity clean-up. By employing the described strategy, in a
   5-month period, 59 out of 815 samples were found to be positive.
   Positive groups of samples were from both therapeutic and anabolic use
   of beta-agonist drugs. Adopting 1 ng ml-1 clenbuterol as a cut-off
   value, the percentage of unconfirmed positive ELISA herds was 3.6\%. The
   reliability of the overall control strategy and of the kit in terms of
   the percentage of false-positive results is evaluated.},

Abstract = {A number of hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of scrapie and other
   human and animal spontaneous and experimental subacute spongiform
   encephalopathies (SSE) are presented here. In particular, it is
   speculated that a PrP(sc) 27-30-induced suppression of host's defense
   system is responsible, through the existence of the different and
   synergistically operating mechanisms, for the absence of any documented
   inflammatory or immunologic response during SSE. This could be
   therapeutically counterparted by the utilization of cytokines (TNF,
   IL-1, etc) or cytokine-inducers, provided that synthesis and secretion
   of the above inflammation mediators on behalf of reticulo-endothelial
   cells were strongly depressed by PrP 27-30, as suggested. Finally, some
   hypotheses are also made in relation to the blood-brain-barrier's
   integrity in susceptible hosts. Similarly to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in
   man, this could play a role also in SSE pathogenesis, facilitating
   cerebral localization of metals such as aluminium, lead, or silica,
   which have already been shown to enhance amyloid fibrils' polymerization
   and deposition within human brain tissue.},

Abstract = {The propagation of foot-and-mouth disease virus on BHK-21 suspension
   cells, although economically convenient, may yield a scarcely immunizing
   antigen. Helpful insights were obtained by investigating a few genotypic
   and phenotypic features of the cell cultures. The appearance of
   polyploid populations, higher cell concentrations at the end of
   culturing, the progressive reduction of spreading on surfaces and an
   abnormal expression of the alpha5beta1 integrin were found to be
   correlated with the number of passages in suspension culture. The
   observed modifications in the normal course of the cell-cycle and in the
   expression of some surface proteins point at a possible mechanism of
   virus damages arising from defective cellular functions.},

Abstract = {In order to investigate genetic variability and differentiation of roe
   deer Capreolus capreolus (Linnaeus, 1758) in Italy, four populations
   were examined for polymorphism at thirty-two gene loci by means of
   vertical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Mean values of polymorphism
   (mean P = 15.6\%, SD 4.4\%) and expected average heterozygosity (mean
   H-e = 4.7\%, SD 1.9\%) were comparable to those reported previously for
   roe deer populations of Central Europe. Moreover, the results confirmed
   that roe deer is one of the genetically most variable deer species yet
   studied. Nei's standard genetic distances (mean D = 0.008, SD 0.004)
   were consistent with the values generally obtained at the level of local
   populations in deer species. Estimates of relative genetic
   differentiation showed that 11.5\% of the total diversity can be
   assigned to genetic divergence among populations. Differences in levels
   of genetic variation among the Italian populations studied are discussed
   with respect to their respective demographic origin and historical
   background. The implications of our data for the management of roe deer
   in Italy are outlined.},

Abstract = {The antigenic sites A and C (the G-H loop and the C terminus,
   respectively) in VPI of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) have been
   considered the immunodominant regions of the virus involved in the
   induction of protection. Other antigenic sites have been described but
   their involvement in protection has not been established. Here we report
   that two closely related but serologically different FMDVs (the field
   isolate C3 Argentina/84 and the vaccine strain C3 Resende Br/55) have
   identical A and C sites but differ at other antigenic sites. Such
   differences have been documented by reactivity with a panel of 28
   monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). The two viruses reacted to the same extent
   with each of 13 MAbs which recognized epitopes within sites A or C, but
   reacted differently with six out of 15 MAbs that recognized other sites.
   Accordingly, sequencing of the entire region coding for the capsid
   proteins, for both viruses, revealed four amino acid substitutions at
   three antigenic sites other than A and C. The results suggest that
   identity of sites A and C may not be sufficient to induce
   cross-protection, and provide the first evidence of significant
   antigenic diversification of FMDV in the field mediated by amino acid
   substitutions outside sites A or C.},

   of the genomic RNA, can also be recovered from infected liver tissue,
   and both RNAs are enclosed within viral capsids formed by a single major
   protein of approximately 60 kDa. Electron microscopic examination of
   organ suspensions from diseased animals shows two types of particle;
   35-40 nm complete virions have the regularly arranged cup-shaped
   depressions typical of calicivirus morphology, and 23-25 nm smooth
   particles resulting from degradation of the outer surface structures of
   the complete virions.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to verify whether a mixed infection in
   calves with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and other bovine viruses,
   such as bovid herpesvirus-4 (BHV-4), parainfluenza-3 (PI-3) and
   infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) virus, would influence the
   pathogenesis of the BVDV infection sufficiently to result in the typical
   form of mucosal disease being produced.
   Accordingly, two experiments were undertaken. In one experiment calves
   were first infected with BVDV and subsequently with BHV-4 and IBR virus,
   respectively. The second experiment consisted in a simultaneous
   infection of calves with BVDV and PI-3 virus or BVDV and IBR virus.
   From the first experiment it seems that BVDV infection can be
   reactivated in calves by BHV-4 and IBR virus. Evidence of this is that
   BVDV, at least the cytopathic (CP) strain, was recovered from calves
   following superinfection. Moreover, following such superinfection the
   calves showed signs which could most likely be ascribed to the
   pathogenetic activity of BVDV. Superinfection, especially by IBR virus,
   created a more severe clinical response in calves that were initially
   infected with CP BVDV, than in those previously given the non-cytopathic
   (NCP) biotype of the virus. Simultaneous infection with PI-3 virus did
   not seem to modify to any significant extent the pathogenesis of the
   experimentally induced BVDV infection whereas a severe clinical response
   was observed in calves when simultaneous infection was made with BVDV
   and IBR virus.},

Abstract = {This presentation summarizes the results of a study on the pathogenesis
   of bovine viral diarrhea (BVDV) infection.
   The cytopathic (CP) strain TVM-2 of BVDV induced in calves an overt
   clinical disease which is usually recorded as the acute primary BVDV
   infection observed under natural conditions.  In contrast the
   non-cytopathic (NCP) strain New York-1 of BVDV did not cause any
   significant signs of disease.  However, when the calves were
   immunosuppressed by treatment with dexamethasone (DMS) the biotype of
   BVDV involved did not seem to be as important as it appeared to be in an
   immunologically normal animal.  This was shown in this study by the NCP
   BVDV which caused a fatal disease in calves treated with DMS.
   A mixed infection given to calves by injecting them with both CP and NCP
   BVDV, did not result in any particularly serious disease.  So, the
   potential immunosuppressive activity of BVDV itself for the host has not
   been proven under the experimental procedures used in this experiment.
   Finally, a modified-live CP BVDV vaccine was unable to cause clinical
   disease when injected into calves that had been infected previously with
   strain New York-1 of BVDV.},

Abstract = {The lapinized chinese (LC) strain of hog cholera virus (HCV), was
   adapted to grow in a cell line from minipig kidney (MPK) where it
   reached a titer, as determined by immunofluorescence, significantly
   higher than in rabbits.  Inasmuch as the immune serum to HCV neutralized
   the culture-adapted virus, it was concluded that its antigenicity did
   not undergo any change after adaptation to MPK cells.
   The MPK-LC adapted virus (MPK-LC-HCV) showed also a higher immunogenic
   activity in rabbits, in comparison with the original LC virus.
   The MPK-LC-HCV protected pigs against challenge infection with virulent
   HCV.  Thus, the vaccinated pigs did not show any clinical signs of
   disease, nor have they been responsible of virus shedding after they
   were exposed to the challenge infection 1 month or 6 and 11 months
   later.  All vaccinated pigs seroconverted after vaccination and the
   antibody titers were on the same range of those reported in pigs
   vaccinated with the traditional vaccine prepared in rabbits.  In the
   same pigs the antibody concentration underwent a booster effect
   following challenge infection.
   It was suggested the MPK-LC-HCV vaccine as an alternative product that
   might be used to prevent HCV infection.},

Abstract = {We selected, from a genomic library of Leptospira interrogans serovar
   hardjo genotype hardjoprajitno, two probes containing repetitive
   sequences (pL1 and pL590).  The hybridization patterns of these probes
   to DNA isolated from a variety of Leptospira serovars were examined and
   their ability to detect subtle differences at the genomic organization
   level was established.  We identified the DNA fragments within pL1 and
   pL590 which are sufficient to yield polymorphic hybridization patterns;
   these results define the upper size limit of two novel repetitive
   elements in the Leptospira genome.  The pattern and degree of
   hybridization observed for the serovars tested in this work were used to
   divide Leptospira spp. into groups which share genetic relatedness; our
   conclusions are consistent with previous classifications by other
   authors.},

Abstract = {The phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of 69 wild-type strains of
   Salmonella abortusovis from Sardinia and other Italian regions,
   representing four different epidemic outbreaks, were studied.
   Biochemical profiles, pathogenicity factors, resistance to antibacterial
   drugs and genomic organization were investigated. None of the strains
   tested showed any haemagglutination with different types of red blood
   cells, and electron microscopy revealed no fimbriae. Adhesivity to
   epithelial cells was present in all strains tested. Only 16\% of the
   strains were resistant to streptomycin, and no other drug resistances
   were found. The restriction patterns of chromosomal DNA did not show
   heterogeneity and a high-molecular-mass (50-67 kb) plasmid was found in
   all strains. Restriction analysis of plasmid DNA from strains from
   different geographical areas, collected over a period of 30 years,
   showed a HindIII restriction profile characterized by two patterns, one
   with three fragments, stable and common to all strains, and a second
   polymorphic pattern with five fragments. The stable pattern included a
   3.7 kb HindIII fragment that hybridized with a S. typhimurium probe
   containing a virulence region including the spvC and spvD genes. These
   studies allowed us to outline a genetic correlation among S. abortusovis
   isolated from different outbreaks.},

Abstract = {The causative agents of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) are small
   icosahedral viruses of the Aphthovirus group within the Picornaviridae
   family.  There is no evidence that these viruses infect cells of the
   immune system or otherwise interfere detrimentally with their function;
   additionally, it has not been possible to relate cytotoxicity reactions
   against virus-infected cells to the efficacy of the immune response
   against FMD virus infection.  In contrast, there is a close association
   between FMD virus antibody and the protective immune response (10, 14,
   15, 20, 24, 25, 29-32).  Induction of this antibody is dependent on the
   structure of the viral antigenic sites (7-9, 11, 18) and on the
   concomitant presence of T(h)-lymphocyte epitopes (4, 5, 7, 8), although
   a T(h)-lymphocyte-independent response has been reported (2).  Recent
   work by Piatti et al. (26) showed that the immune response induced by
   FMD virus was only T(h)-lymphocyte dependent when low doses of antigen
   were used.  This latter work was performed in mice, and it is not
   certain that a similar situation would be found in cattle.  As for the
   major effector immune defense, this relies on the interaction between
   antibody-virus complexes and the phagocytic cells of the
   reticuloendothelial system (17, 19).},

Abstract = {The presence of a low molecular mass polypeptidic antigen in Borrelia
   burgdorferi was described. The protein was exposed at the bacterial
   surface since it was clearly identified by mAb 3H4 using the
   immunofluorescence test performed with living bacteria. This antigen was
   cleaved by proteinase K treatment, whereas it was resistant to the
   action of chymotrypsin, trypsin and thermolysin. Western blotting
   analysis of the immunological reactivity of this antigenic structure
   performed using monoclonal antibody, mouse-immune ascitic fluids raised
   against B. burgdorferi and other spirochetes, sera from patients with
   Lyme disease and other infirmities in which false positive results in
   serological tests for B. burgdorferi have been described, demonstrated
   that this protein expresses only species-specific epitopes which may be
   recognized during human B. burgdorferi infections.},

Abstract = {Since October 1986 an unusually high mortality has been observed both in
   wild European brown hares (Lepus europaeus) and in hare farms in Italy.
   Pathological alterations, including severe hepatosis, nephrosis,
   congestion and hemorrhages of tracheal mucosa and lungs, and splenic
   vascular congestion, were observed in 179 of 381 hares necropsied from
   1986 to 1988. jaundice also was seen in 30\% of these hares.
   Histologically, the liver damage was characterized by coagulative
   necrosis, mainly located around the portal areas, or by degenerative
   changes. Hyperemia, focal hemorrhages and periportal mononuclear cell
   infiltration were also present. The epithelium of renal tubules showed
   the presence of various degrees of vacuolar degeneration and necrosis,
   and eosinophilic granular hyaline casts or homogenous proteinaceous
   material were found within the lumen of tubules. Only the adult hares
   were affected. In wild bare populations night counts revealed a
   reduction of the number of observed wild hares during the winter period
   which ranged from 27 to 40\%, whereas in hare farms the mortality ranged
   from 30 to 90\%. Bacteriological, parasitological, and toxicological
   investigations were unable to confirm the primary cause of these deaths.
   Negative stain electron microscopy and immunoelectronmicroscopy
   conducted since October 1988 on liver and spleen homogenates from hares
   with acute hepatosis revealed the presence of viral particles with
   morphological aspects resembling those of calicivirus, antigenically
   related to the etiological agent of viral haemorrhagic disease of
   rabbits.},

Abstract = {Monoclonal antibodies have been raised against pituitary bovine growth
   hormone using the hybridoma procedure.  The binding characteristics of
   the seven selected monoclonal antibodies toward the antigen molecule in
   its native, chemically or enzymatically treated form have been studied. 
   The reactivities of the monoclonal antibodies with growth hormones from
   other species and bovine prolactin have also been investigated.  The
   epitopes recognized by four of the produced monoclonal antibodies are
   conformational, whereas two other monoclonal antibodies bind to
   sequential determinants.  Three antibodies define immunological sites
   located between residues 6-124 of the bovine growth hormone molecule,
   and one of this antibody shows higher affinity to human than bovine
   growth hormone.   The immunoreactivity of one monoclonal antibody is
   enhanced by the previous binding of the antigen to polyclonal
   antibodies, probably because of a localized conformational change of the
   bovine growth hormone molecule.  This antibody also shows
   cross-reactivity with all the homologous hormones tested, indicating to
   recognize a highly conserved antigenic determinant.},

Abstract = {Two field trials were undertaken to evaluate specific vaccines and
   Biological Response Modifiers (B.R.M.) with regard to disease control of
   beef cattle.  Clinical data and laboratory results strongly suggested a
   genetically determined resistance to transportation stress of some
   cattle breeds, with possible important consequences on the occurrence of
   multi-factor diseases.  Plenty of calves showed detectable levels of
   serum interferon and a remarkable activation of at least some lymphocyte
   populations in the first days after arrival.  In general, B.R.M.-treated
   cattle could better react against environmental pathogens, as evidenced
   by both clinical and laboratory findings.  Several data emerged that
   even the efficacy of specific vaccines could be largely accounted for by
   a positive modulation of non-specific immunity; this latter feature can
   be mainly referred to adjuvants and/or some bacterial antigens.},

Abstract = {This article summarizes the results of a study on several strains of
   Bovid herpesvirus-4 (BHV-4), isolated from cattle. The study had several
   objectives, namely, to verify (a) the disease-causing potential of the
   virus, (b) the possibility by BHV-4 to induce a latent infection in the
   natural host and (c) the entity of the relationships among strains of
   the virus isolated from different disease syndromes. The following data
   were obtained: (1) All strains tested were able to replicate in
   experimentally infected calves; however, only one strain (85/BH 16TV)
   caused an overt systemic disease. (2) The nervous system as well as the
   lymphoid structures appeared to be the target organs for replication of
   the virus. (3) BHV-4, like other herpesviruses, was able to establish
   latent infection in cattle. (4) When two strains of the virus, isolated
   from cattle affected by different disease syndromes, i.e. respiratory
   disease (strain DN-599) or vulvovaginitis (strain 85/BH 16TV),
   respectively, they resulted to be closely related to each other. In
   particular, they revealed a similar DNA pattern and both strains were
   able to cause respiratory disease in calves. Moreover, the two viral
   strains were mutually protective in that calves were generally found to
   be refractory to challenge inoculation with either the homologous or the
   heterologous virus. (5) All BHV-4 strains tested generally failed to
   evoke a significant production of neutralizing antibody in the
   experimental calves.},

Abstract = {In Italy epizootics of equine influenza often occur, but no virus
   isolation has been reported since 1971. This paper describes the
   antigenic and biochemical characterization of two equine influenza
   viruses isolated in Italy from 1985 to 1989. The virus isolates were
   shown to differ antigenically from earlier strains of the same subtype,
   A/equine/Miami/1/63 (H3N8). Monoclonal antibody analysis showed that the
   haemagglutinins of these strains were serologically indistinguishable
   from A/equine/Fontainebleau/1/79, a variant of A/equine/Miami, never
   isolated in Italy before. One of the two virus isolates was obtained
   from a horse immunized with a bivalent inactivated influenza vaccine,
   not containing A/equine/Fontainebleau/79 antigens.
   The vaccine failure underlines the importance of antigenic relatedness
   between currently circulating viruses and vaccine strains. Therefore, to
   improve the protection afforded by equine immunization, the vaccine
   composition should be decided according to the results of a virological
   surveillance activity, systematically conducted among horses.},

Abstract = {Sera from five traditionally managed herds grazing in the Kafue flats
   were tested for antibodies to bovine viral diarrhoea-mucosal disease
   (BVD-MD), parainfluenza 3 (P13), infectious bovine
   rhinotracheitis-infectious pustular vulvovaginitis (IBR-IPV), bovine
   adenovirus 3 (BAV3) and Bluetongue (BT). The sero-prevalences of the
   first four diseases were respectively 76.2, 94.4, 42.1 and 87.4\%. Five
   samples (2.3\%) gave doubtful reactions for BT. Prevalences of 28.5\%
   for brucellosis, 14\% for Rift Valley fever (RFV), 0.9\% for Q fever and
   11.2\% for chlamydiosis were also recorded. Significantly higher values
   for BVD-MD (p < 0.005), IBR-IPV (p < 0.01) and brucellosis (p < 0.05)
   were found in animals over 1 year of age. No differences were recorded
   between herds or between male and female animals.
   The high concentration of wild and domestic ruminants grazing together
   in the flood plains during the dry season may be a major determinant of
   the high values observed. Traditional farmers, slaughterhouse workers
   and other people involved in livestock production are particularly at
   risk of contracting brucellosis and RVF because of the high prevalences
   in cattle and local habits favourable to their transmission.},
