Abstract = {A growing number of studies suggest that the lower urinary tract of
   humans and dogs can harbor a urinary microbiota. Nevertheless, a certain
   concern has developed that the microbiota reported could be due to
   unaccounted contamination, especially in low-biomass samples. The aim of
   this study was to investigate the bacterial community which populates
   the urine of healthy cats using two approaches: a culture-dependent
   approach which consisted of the expanded quantitative urine culture
   (EQUC) techniques capable of identifying live bacteria not growing in
   standard urine cultures, and a culture-independent approach which
   consisted of 16S ribosomal RNA next generation sequencing (16S rRNA NGS)
   capable of identifying bacterial DNA and exploring microbial diversity
   with high resolution. To avoid confounding factors of possible bacterial
   contamination, the urine was sampled using ultrasound-guided
   cystocentesis, and several sample controls and negative controls were
   analyzed. The urine sampled from the 10 cats included in the study
   showed no bacterial growth in the EQUC procedure. Although several reads
   were successfully originated using 16S rRNA NGS, a comparable pattern
   was observed between urine samples and the negative control, and no taxa
   were statistically accepted as non-contaminant. Taken together, the
   results obtained allowed stating that no viable bacteria were present in
   the urine of healthy cats without lower urinary tract disease and
   urinary tract infections, and that the bacterial DNA detected was of
   contaminant origin.},

Title = {A 10-Year Surveillance of Eimeria spp. in Cattle and Buffaloes in a
   Mediterranean Area},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Coccidiosis due to Eimeriaspp. are widespread parasitic infections in
   cattle and water buffaloes and may impair health, welfare, and
   production of these livestock species. The aims of this study were (i)
   to investigate the prevalence and seasonal dynamics of eimeriosis and
   (ii) to characterize theEimeriaspecies in large ruminants in a
   Mediterranean area, in order to plan effective control strategies.
   Parasitological data were obtained from a 10-year surveillance program
   (2010-2019) on 3,631 farms (2,089 buffalo and 1,542 cattle farms)
   sampled in central and southern Italy. Pooled fecal samples were
   analyzed using the FLOTAC technique with an analytic sensitivity of 2
   oocysts per gram of feces (OPG) utilizing a saturated sodium chloride
   flotation solution (specific gravity = 1.200).Eimeriaspecies
   identification was performed by morphometric analysis after a one week
   incubation of oocysts in a 2.5\% potassium dichromate solution. The
   results showed high prevalence ofEimeria(up to 100\%) in both cattle and
   buffaloes in the 10 years of surveillance, even if a slight reduction
   was reported in the last three years. The overall prevalence of
   eimeriosis was 91.7\% (95\% confidence interval, 95\% CI = 90.2-93.1) in
   cattle farms and 81.5\% (95\% CI = 79.8-83.1) in water buffalo farms.
   The mean OPG value was 66.8 (min = 2; max = 8,065) in cattle and 55.9
   (min = 2; max = 15,415) in water buffaloes, but this difference was not
   statistically significant (p> 0.05). In total, nine species
   ofEimeriawere found in cattle the most prevalent beingEimeria bovis, E.
   ellipsoidalis, E. cylindrica, andE. zuernii, whereas in water buffaloes
   eight species ofEimeriawere found, the most prevalent beingE.
   ellipsoidalis, E. auburnensis, E. bovis, andE. zuernii. Mixed infections
   were common in both ruminant species. The seasonal pattern showed a
   higher prevalence of eimeriosis in cattle in spring (86.9\%) whereas in
   buffalo farms the prevalence was higher in winter (82.3\%) and summer
   (82.4\%). In conclusion, the 10-year surveillance program indicates that
   eimeriosis is common in cattle and water buffaloes and therefore
   continuous effective control strategies are needed.},

Abstract = {Background: Culicoidesbiting midges are vectors involved in the
   biological transmission cycle of important animal diseases such as
   bluetongue and African horse sickness. In Romania, the first outbreaks
   of bluetongue were reported in 2014, leading to increased activities
   within the existing entomological surveillance network. The main goals
   of the surveillance activities were the establishment of the vector free
   period in relation to animal trade and the identification
   ofCulicoidesspecies involved in the transmission of the pathogen. This
   study was conducted on the composition and relative abundance of the
   species belonging to the genusCulicoides(Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) in
   certain regions of Romania and provided the opportunity to update the
   existing checklist ofCulicoidesspecies of this country.
   Methods: The study was conducted in 33 of the 42 administrative units
   (counties), including a total of 659 catches, in 102 locations. The
   collections were carried out with UV blacklight suction traps (OVI
   type). The collected insects were preserved in 70\% ethanol.
   Morphological insect identification was carried out using a
   stereomicroscope, according to established identification keys. In ten
   localities the relative abundance of the cryptic species of the
   Obsoletus complex was determined by multiplex PCR assay based on the
   ITS2 segment. The identification of theCulicoides chiopterus(Meigen)
   species by morphological examination was confirmed by PCR assay based on
   the ITS1 segment.
   Results: Eleven species were identified using morphological and PCR
   tools. The rest of the individuals were separated into five taxa. The
   species of the Obsoletus complex (grouping Culicoides obsoletus(Meigen)
   and Culicoides scoticus Downes \& Kettle) were the most abundant,
   accounting for 59\% of the total number of captured Culicoidesspp. Three
   of the identified species are mentioned, according to our knowledge, for
   the first time in Romania:Culicoides newsteadi Austen,Culicoides
   flavipulicaris Dzhafarov and Culicoides bysta Sarvasova, Kocisova,
   Candolfi \& Mathieu.
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that theCulicoidesspecies most
   commonly cited as being involved in the transmission of arboviruses in
   Europe (i.e. bluetongue and Schmallenberg viruses) make up a high
   proportion of adultCulicoidestrapped in Romania.},

Abstract = {Wharton jelly mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSCs) are able to differentiate
   into different cell lineages upon stimulation. This ability is closely
   related to the perfect balance between the pluripotency-related genes,
   which control stem-cell proliferation, and genes able to orchestrate the
   appearance of a specific phenotype. Here we studied the expression of
   stemness-related genes, epigenetic regulators (DNMT1, SIRT1), miRNAs
   (miR-145, miR-148, andmiR-185) related to stemness, exosomes, the
   cell-cycle regulatorsp21(WAF1/CIP1) andp53, and the
   senescence-associated genes (p16, p19, andhTERT). Cells were cultured in
   the presence or absence of the human hepatocarcinoma cell line
   HepG2-exhausted medium, to evaluate changes in stemness, differentiation
   capability, and senescence sensibility. Our results showed the
   overexpression ofSIRT1and reduced levels ofp21mRNA. Moreover, we
   observed a downregulation ofDNMT1, and a simultaneous overexpression
   ofOct-4andc-Myc. These findings suggest that WJ-MSCs are more likely to
   retain a stem phenotype and sometimes to switch to a highly
   undifferentiable proliferative-like behavior if treated with medium
   exhausted by human HepG2 cell lines.},

Abstract = {Mycoplasma disparis an overlooked pathogen often involved in bovine

   of antimicrobials routinely used in BRD were evaluated using a broth
   microdilution technique for 41M. disparisolates collected in Italy
   between 2011-2019. While all isolates had low MIC values for florfenicol
   (<1 mu g/mL), many showed high MIC values for erythromycin (MIC90 >= 8
   mu g/mL). Tilmicosin MIC values were higher (MIC50 = 32 mu g/mL) than
   those for tylosin (MIC50 = 0.25 mu g/mL). Seven isolates had high MIC
   values for lincomycin, tilmicosin and tylosin (>= 32 mu g/mL). More,
   alarmingly, results showed more than half the strains had high MICs for
   enrofloxacin, a member of the fluoroquinolone class considered
   critically important in human health. A time-dependent progressive drift
   of enrofloxacin MICs towards high-concentration values was observed,
   indicative of an on-going selection process among the isolates.},

Title = {Evaluation of intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors for dog visceral

Journal = {PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {The genetic and breed susceptibility of visceral hemangiosarcoma in dogs
   has been studied, but there is no evidence of environmental risk factors
   as reported in human medicine. We conducted a case-control study in
   which the sampling population was the list of canine oncology cases of
   the Animal Tumour Registry of Lazio region, Italy (2009-2017). We
   defined cases as dogs with visceral hemangiosarcoma and controls as dogs
   affected by another neoplasm. The ratio between controls and cases was
   3:1. Analysed variables were: age, weight, sex, reproductive status,
   size, breed, nutrition habit, living environment and location of the
   house. We performed a preliminary univariate analysis to select
   potential risk factors (p-value 0.2) then entered in a forward stepwise
   logistic regression model. Ninety-three cases enrolled in the study were
   compared with 279 controls. The multivariable logistic regression
   identified age, reproductive status and breed as significant risk
   factors. Results showed an increasing risk with increasing age for age
   classes 6-10 and 10 years old (OR = 9.69, 95 \% CI: 1.21-77.62; OR =
   14.01, 95 \% CI: 1.65-119.03). Neutered animals (male and female) were
   at greater risk compared to intact ones. The breeds at greatest risk
   were German shepherd (OR = 4.17, 95 \% CI: 1.25-13.86) and mixed breed
   (OR = 3.50, 95 \% CI: 1.44-8.51). The last finding could be explained by
   the genetic origin of the animals, which may include German shepherd or
   another possible breed at risk. No other individual or environmental
   variables were identified as risk factors. The findings of this work
   indicate that genetic predisposition is the key element in visceral
   hemangiosarcoma development.},

Abstract = {Salmonella entericasubspeciesentericaserotype Hessarek
   (SalmonellaHessarek) is considered a serovar with high host specificity
   and is an uncommon cause of disease in humans; no cases ofS.Hessarek
   bacteremia have been reported in humans to date. On 16 July 2019, a
   young male presented abdominal pain, vomit, diarrhea, and fever up to 41
   degrees C, a few hours after a kebab meal containing goat meat; he went
   to the Emergency Room, where a Film Array (R) GI Panel (BioFire,
   Biomerieux Company, Marcy-Letoile, France) was performed on his feces
   and results were positive forSalmonella. The culture of the feces was
   negative, but the blood culture was positive forSalmonella spp., which
   was identified as Salmonella Hessarek by seroagglutination assays. The
   patient was treated with ceftriaxone 2 g intravenously qd for 8 days; he
   was discharged in good general conditions, and ciprofloxacin 500 mg per
   os bid for 7 more days was prescribed, after exclusion of endocarditis
   and of clinical signs of complicated bacteremia. This case of Salmonella
   Hessarek gastroenteritis with bacteremia is probably the first case of
   bloodstream human infection due to this agent ever described. Further
   studies are needed to ascertain the global burden ofS.Hessarek disease
   in humans.},

Abstract = {An investigation was carried out to detect the presence of Mycobacterium
   bovis in slaughterhouses where intradermal tuberculin test positive
   cattle were slaughtered, and to evaluate the risk of contamination by M.
   bovis among exposed slaughterhouse workers. Swabs were taken from the
   carcasses of slaughtered animals showing autoptic signs of
   non-generalized forms of tuberculosis, thus authorized for free
   consumption. Swabs were also taken from the hands and clothes of the
   staff employed in the butchery production line. Environmental samplings
   were conducted on the slaughterhouse air using filters and air
   aspiration devices, and on water used to wash the carcasses after
   slaughter. Samples from the carcasses of healthy animals were also taken
   on a following slaughtering session. The swabs were analysed by means of
   Polymerase Chain Reaction for the detection of mycobacteria. M. bovis
   was detected on meats, on the hands of one worker, and in the washing
   water. The results obtained from this study confirm that workers are
   highly exposed to infection by zoonotic tuberculosis, and that cleaning
   procedures were ineffective in our setting.},

Abstract = {Statistics show that disasters have expanded in scope and scale, with
   impacts on both humans and animals. As animals are valued not only for
   their economic value, but also for their companionship, people sometimes
   risktheir lives to protect them, and emergency responders are expected
   to safeguard their welfare during emergencies. This paper discusses
   experiences from different regions of the world in animal disaster risk
   reduction and management in terms of legislation, funding streams,
   planning, capacity development, and communications. It is widely
   recognised that human, animal and environmental well-being are
   interconnected; therefore, as this is the case, and as veterinarians are
   at the forefront in ensuring animal welfare, they should be involved
   throughout the disaster management cycle. While animals and their
   welfare should always be considered in national disaster management
   plans, sub-regional authorities must be empowered to integrate animal
   welfare principles when responding to emergencies and implementing risk
   reduction programmes. Capacity development is key for Veterinary
   Services personnel who work in the fields of disaster management and
   risk reduction. Training tools and curricula developed by different
   organisations are available to foster skills such as incident
   coordination, risk communication, or response planning using tools such
   as the Livestock Emergency Guidelines and Standards (LEGS).
   Intergovernmental organisations also play a significant role in setting
   the standards and frameworks within which professionals operate.},

Abstract = {Since February 2020, Italy has been seriously affected by the SARS-CoV-2
   pandemic. To support the National Health Care system,
   naso-pharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs collected from suspected cases of
   Teramo province, Abruzzo region, are tested at Istituto Zooprofilattico
   Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise G. Caporale, for the presence of
   SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Out of 12,446 tested individuals, 605 returned positive
   results at least once, with prevalence significantly higher in men. A
   reduction of the level of viral RNA in the first swab per each positive
   patient collected over time was also observed. Moreover, 81 patients had
   at least one positive sample and two final negative tests: positivity in
   swabs lasted from 14 to 63 days, with a median value of 30 days. This
   shows the potential for the virus to coexist with patients for a long
   time, although we highlighted intermittent positivity in several cases.
   The evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological situation and knowledge
   on viral shedding should be closely monitored, to interpret the findings
   correctly and adjust accordingly the surveillance activities.},

Title = {Prohibitin 2 is Involved in Parkin-Mediated Mitophagy in Urothelial
   Cells of Cattle Infected with Bovine Papillomavirus},
Journal = {PATHOGENS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Prohibitin 2 (PHB2), an inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) protein, has
   recently been identified as a novel receptor involved in parkin-mediated
   mitophagy. In the field of veterinary medicine, the role of PHB2 in
   parkin-mediated mitophagy was described, for the first time, in
   urothelial cells of cattle, naturally infected with bovine
   papillomavirus (BPV). The BPV2 and BPV13 E5 oncoprotein, responsible for
   abortive infections in urothelial cells, was detected by RT-PCR. Severe
   ultrastructural abnormalities of the inner mitochondrial membrane were
   detected using transmission electron microscopy. PHB2 formed a
   functional complex with PHB1. PHB2 was significantly overexpressed in
   mitochondrial fractions from urothelial mucosa samples taken from cattle
   harbouring BPV infection. PHB2 overexpression could be attributed to
   mitochondrial dysfunction, as its expression levels in the cytosolic,
   microsomal, and nuclear fractions were seen to be unmodified.
   Immunoprecipitation studies revealed the interaction between PHB2 and
   phosphorylated forms of both PINK1 and parkin. Furthermore, PHB2
   interacted with LC3-II, a marker of autophagosomal membranes and
   autophagy receptors, such as p62 and optineurin. PHB2 was shown to
   interact with transcription factor EB (TFEB), which is activated
   following parkin-mediated mitophagy, and embryonic stem cell-expressed
   Ras (ERAS), a constitutive protein coded by ERas. Western blot analysis
   revealed a significant overexpression of unphosphorylated TFEB in
   mitochondrial and nuclear fractions from urothelial mucosa samples from
   cattle suffering from BPV infection. Finally, PHB2 interacted with ERAS,
   believed to be involved in mitophagosome maturation. Taken together, the
   molecular and ultrastructural findings of this study suggested that BPV
   infection is responsible for parkin-dependent mitophagy, in the pathway
   of which PHB2 plays a crucial role.},

Title = {Use of antimicrobials in beef cattle: an observational study in the
   north of Italy},
Journal = {PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {181},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance is a worldwide issue whereby a more prudent use
   of medications is needed, especially for those antimicrobials (AM)
   classified as `highest priority critically important antimicrobials'
   (HPCIAs) which are likely contributors to the development of resistance.
   So far, data on antimicrobial use (AMU) in EU are mainly reported at
   sales level while information on real use, mostly in beef production, is
   poor. The most reliable indicator to measure AMU is the treatment
   incidence (TI100) calculated by using the Defined Daily Dose Animal
   (DDDA) as stated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Although Italy
   ranks second among EU countries with regard to the AM sales in livestock
   production, data on AMU of the Italian beef production is still lacking,
   whereby the aim of this study was to provide information on the current
   scenario of AMU in Italian beef cattle. Data were collected from January
   2016 to April 2019 from specialized beef fattening farms located in the
   north of Italy yielding a final dataset of 1376 batches. Data on
   performance and AM agents used in the study were collected and TI100
   indexes per batch were calculated according to both Italian and EMA's
   DDDA. A Kruskal Wallis test was used to check for differences between
   years and seasons. Results showed a significant variation between years
   and seasons with a reduction of TI100 based on Italian DDDA as time
   progressed (P < 0.05). However, about 40\% of the total amount of
   treatments administered were HPCIAs with macrolides accounting for the
   27.7\% of the total amount. The most common reasons of administration of
   AM were respiratory diseases (68.9\%) and lameness (17.6\%). Penicillins
   was the class of AM used on the highest proportion of batches (84.4\%)
   showing that broad-spectrum AM were widely exploited among herds. In
   summary, despite a general reduction of AMU in beef cattle over time, a
   great use of HPCIAs was still observed suggesting that AM stewardship
   for Italian beef production should pay particular emphasis on the
   reduction of HPCIAs use. This shows how overall knowledge on where
   efforts need to be optimized is important to develop targeted strategies
   for a more responsible AM stewardship. Results of the current study may
   also contribute to define national and EU benchmark criteria for AMU, as
   a comparison with studies carried out in other countries or on other
   food producing sectors is still challenging to achieve.},

Title = {Attribution of Listeria monocytogenes human infections to food and

Journal = {FOOD MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {89},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Listeriosis is a foodborne illness characterized by a relatively low
   morbidity, but a large disease burden due to the severity of clinical
   manifestations and the high case fatality rate. Increased listeriosis
   notifications have been observed in Europe since the 2000s. However, the
   reasons for this increase are largely unknown, with the sources of
   sporadic human listerioris often remaining elusive. Here we inferred the
   relative contributions of several putative sources of Listeria
   monocytogenes strains from listerioris patients in Northern Italy
   (Piedmont and Lombardy regions), using two established source
   attribution models (i.e. `Dutch' and `STRUCTURE') in comparative
   fashion. We compared the Multi-Locus Sequence Typing and
   Multi-Virulence-Locus Sequence Typing profiles of strains collected from
   beef, dairy, fish, game, mixed foods, mixed meat, pork, and poultry.
   Overall, 634 L. monocytogenes isolates were collected from 2005 to 2016.
   In total, 40 clonal complexes and 51 virulence types were identified,
   with 36\% of the isolates belonging to possible epidemic clones (i.e.
   genetically related strains from unrelated outbreaks). Source
   attribution analysis showed that 50\% of human listerioris cases (95\%
   Confidence Interval 44-55\%) could be attributed to dairy products,
   followed by poultry and pork (15\% each), and mixed foods (15\%). Since
   the contamination of dairy, poultry and pork products are closely linked
   to primary production, expanding actions currently limited to
   ready-to-eat products to the reservoir level may help reducing the risk
   of cross-contamination at the consumer level.},

Title = {Cryptosporidium and Giardia infections in dairy calves in southern
   Ethiopia},
Journal = {PARASITE EPIDEMIOLOGY AND CONTROL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Giardia and Cryptosporidium are the most common enteric protozoan
   parasites causing diarrhea in humans and animals worldwide. This study
   was conducted with the objectives of estimating prevalence and
   identifying risk factors for Cryptosporidium and Giardia infections in
   dairy calves in selected districts of southern Ethiopia. Fecal samples
   (n = 330) were collected from calves in 92 farms. The monoclonal
   antibody-based commercial direct immunofluorescent kit was used to test
   the samples for Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts. A
   questionnaire survey was also administered to collect data on potential
   risk factors of infections. The results showed a farm-level prevalence
   of 69.6\% (95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 59.1-78.7\%) for
   Cryptosporidium and 38.04\% (95\% CI: 28.1-48.8\%) for Giardia.
   Likewise, an overall animal level prevalence of 13.0\% (95\% CI:
   9.6-17.2\%) for Cryptosporidium and 9.7\% (95\% CI: 6.7-13.4\%) for
   Giardia was found. At the farm level, multivariate logistic regression
   model showed that calves in smallholder farms were 5.3 times more likely
   to shed Cryptosporidium oocysts than calves in commercial farms
   (p=0.019). However, in case of Giardia, calves in commercial farms were
   5.5 times more likely to shed cysts than calves in smallholder farms
   (p=0.037). Calves with diarrhea were nearly three times more likely to
   be positive for Cryptosporidium oocysts than those with normal feces
   (p=0.027). At the animal level, larger farms and younger calves were
   associated with Giardia cysts shedding, while larger herd size and lose
   fecal consistency were associated with Cryptosporidium oocysts shedding.
   Giardia and Cryptosporidium infection are endemic in the studied dairy
   farms. Therefore, detailed molecular epidemiological studies are
   essential to identify the role of domestic animals in the transmission
   of infections to humans and vice versa, and to determine the best
   options for prevention and control of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis.

Abstract = {Infectious diseases by pathogens, including those of zoonotic concern,
   may act as a primary or contributory cause of threat to wildlife
   conservation and may represent a risk for human health, mainly for
   people working at, or visiting the zoological parks. Given the paucity
   of data on pathogens infecting wild tigers, we investigated the
   occurrence of infectious agents in this animal species, with a special
   focus on those of zoonotic concern. Blood and serum samples from tigers
   (n = 20) living in a wildlife safari park of southern Italy were
   screened by serological and molecular tests. All animals scored positive
   for antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii (100\%), whereas they displayed
   different prevalence of seropositivity for Rickettsia conorii (30\%),
   Bartonella henselae (15\%) and Leptospira interrogans sv
   Icterohaemorrhagiae and/or Leptospira kirschneri sv Grippotyphosa
   (15\%). No antibodies against Coxiella burnetii were detected. In
   addition, 8 tigers (40\%) tested molecularly positive to ``Candidatus
   Mycoplasma haemominutum{''}, and 3 (15\%) to Hepatozoon canis. No DNA of
   R. conorii, Bartonella spp., Ehrlichia/Anaplasma spp. and piroplasmids
   was amplified. The occurrence of tiger infections by bacteria and
   parasites may represent a risk for morbidity and, in some circumstances,
   mortality in this endangered species and a source of infection for other
   animals, including humans. These findings indicate that the circulation
   of zoonotic pathogens such as T. gondii, R. conorii, L. interrogans sv
   Icterohaemorrhagiae, ``Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum{''} and B.
   henselae in given environments may represent a relevant health issue
   considering the close association among animals and humans visiting, or
   working at, the wildlife safari park. Preventative measures are
   advocated in order to control ectoparasites and other sources of
   infection (e.g., small rodents), thus for minimizing the risk of
   infection for animals as well as for humans.},

Abstract = {Mycobacterium pseudoshottsii, a slow-growing mycobacterium closely
   related toM. marinum, has been isolated only in wild fish in the United
   States and in Japanese fish farms to date. Here, we report cases of
   mortality in three farmed fish species (Dicentrarchus labrax,Sparus
   aurata, andSciaenops ocellatus) caused byM. pseudoshottsiiin Italy.
   Samples underwent necropsy, histology, and culture with pathogen
   identification based on PCR and sequencing of housekeeping genes (16S

Abstract = {Nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs are often employed for etiological
   diagnoses of bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC), but
   transtracheal wash (TTW) can provide samples to assess the
   microbiological status of the lower respiratory tract because there is
   no contamination of the microorganisms from the upper respiratory
   airways. In large animals, a TTW is performed by means of angiocatheter
   or trocar, where a rubber tube or urinary catheter can be inserted.
   Although sterile instruments are commonly recommended, there is little
   practical information on the available tools for TTW. This case series
   reports the use of a disposable sterile single lumen polyurethane and
   plastic-coated venous catheter (Cavafix (R) Certo with Splittocan (R),
   BBraun, Milan, Italy) to perform TTW in dairy calves affected by BRCD.
   Thirty-seven Holstein-Friesian calves with BRDC, admitted to the
   veterinary teaching hospital, underwent a TTW. After sedation of the
   calf, the disposable catheter was inserted into the tracheal lumen and
   20 mL of sterile saline solution was injected and re-aspirated.
   The procedure was always well tolerated and allowed to isolate the
   pathogenic microorganisms in 30 cases (81\%). A single pathogenic
   microorganism was isolated in 23 cases, while in 7 cases, multiple
   isolations were performed. The most frequently isolated pathogens were
   Pasteurella multocida (13 cases, 35.14\%) and Mycoplasma bovis (11
   cases, 29.76\%). Parainfluenza type 3 virus (PI-3) and bovine
   respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) were both isolated in 4 cases. In 7
   calves, already treated with antibiotics before hospitalization, the
   samples resulted sterile. In cattle the most employed tools to perform
   TTW are represented by urinary catheters or polyethylene tubes but they
   are not equipped with protective devices, that preserve sterility during
   the procedure. The characteristic plastic sheath covering Cavafix (R)
   Certo catheter avoids contamination during the entire procedure,
   increasing thereby the asepsis level of this technique. The use of
   Cavafix (R) Certo catheter is a simple, effective, and safe technique
   that can help to maintain asepsis throughout the procedure, especially
   in field conditions.},

Title = {LC-MS/MS analyses of bile and histological analyses of thymus as
   diagnostic tools to detect low dose dexamethasone illicit treatment in
   beef cattle at slaughterhouse},
Journal = {STEROIDS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {160},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Dexamethasone (DXM) is a synthetic adrenal corticosteroid with
   anti-inflammatory properties used for therapeutic purposes in a wide
   range of pathologies and of the most common corticosteroids used for
   anabolic purposes in beef cattle. It is proven that DXM induces
   histological changes, traceable as increasing fatty infiltration of the
   thymus associated with a concurrent decrease of the cortex-medulla
   ratio, so the histological examination of the thymus gland has been
   established as an indirect morphological biomarker. The aim of the
   present study is to compare thymus histology and DXM concentrations in
   biological fluids collected at slaughterhouse after 1 month of DXM
   treatment. Our findings demonstrate that a low dosage of DXM
   administered to 12 months-old-Chianina beef cattle induces severe thymic
   atrophy with concurrent reduction of the cortex/ medulla ratio,
   demonstrable even when DXM residues are not found in serum and urine
   samples. It is worth to note that, at the slaughterhouse, DXM residues
   are detectable in bile samples, indicating the ability of this
   biological fluid to bio-concentrate the administered drug if compared to
   serum and urine. Therefore, bile could be candidates as new liquid
   matrix for the screening programs planned to contrast the illegal use of
   anabolic substances.},

Abstract = {The disease erysipelas caused by Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (ER) is a
   major concern in pig production. In the present study the genomes of ER
   from pigs (n=87), wild boars (n=71) and other sources (n=85) were
   compared in terms of whole-genome SNP variation, accessory genome
   content and the presence of genetic antibiotic resistance determinants.
   The aim was to investigate if genetic features among ER were associated
   with isolate origin in order to better estimate the risk of transmission
   of porcine-adapted strains from wild boars to free-range pigs and to
   increase our understanding of the evolution of ER. Pigs and wild boars
   carried isolates representing all ER Glades, but Glade one only occurred
   in healthy wild boars and healthy pigs. Several accessory genes or gene
   variants were found to be significantly associated with the pig and wild
   boar hosts, with genes predicted to encode cell wall-associated or
   extracellular proteins overrepresented. Gene variants associated with
   serovar determination and capsule production in serovars known to be
   pathogenic for pigs were found to be significantly associated with pigs
   as hosts. In total, 30\% of investigated pig isolates but only 6\% of
   wild boar isolates carried resistance genes, most commonly tetM
   (tetracycline) and lsa(E) together with lnu(B) (lincosamides,
   pleuromutilin and streptogramin A). The incidence of variably present
   genes including resistance determinants was weakly linked to phylogeny,
   indicating that host adaptation in ER has evolved multiple times in
   diverse lineages mediated by recombination and the acquisition of mobile
   genetic elements. The presented results support the occurrence of
   host-adapted ER strains, but they do not indicate frequent transmission
   between wild boars and domestic pigs. This article contains data hosted
   by Microreact.},

Title = {Morphological and Immunohistochemical Examination of Lymphoproliferative
   Lesions Caused by Marek's Disease Virus in Breeder Chickens},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Simple Summary The poultry industry is the most intensive and fastest
   growing among all livestock production systems, and, in the last
   decades, it has expanded exponentially due to an increasing demand for
   meat and eggs. Marek's disease is a highly contagious and rapidly
   progressive lymphoproliferative disease. It is one of the most dangerous
   diseases of those affecting the sector because it causes important
   economic losses. Although widely controlled by vaccination programs,
   sometimes chickens are not totally protected, and the presence of
   virulent field strains can allow outbreaks. This case describes the
   occurrence of Marek's disease observed in a breeder chicken flock that
   reported an increase in mortality rate (+0.4-0.6\%) after the 32nd week.
   Histological analysis has highlighted severe lesions on visceral organs
   of chickens caused by Marek's disease, especially in the intestinal
   tract of a hen that had a tumor mass in the distal part of the cloaca.
   Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the disease-associated tumor. The
   aim of this study was to underline the importance of vaccine
   administration related to the maintenance of proper biosecurity
   practice, especially in the first week of the raising cycle. In
   addition, monitoring for disease even after vaccination is crucial to
   minimize economic loss. Marek's disease is widely controlled by
   vaccination programs; however, chickens are not totally protected,
   especially immediately after the vaccination when a strong challenge
   could interfere with the effectiveness of vaccination in the absence of
   proper biosecurity practice. This case report describes the occurrence
   of Marek's disease (MD) observed in a breeder chicken flock reared
   southeast of Sicily. MD outbreak occurred from 32 to 47 weeks with an
   increase in weekly mortality rate (+0.4-0.6\%). Overall, mortality rate
   related to Marek's disease was about 6\% at the end of the cycle.
   Carcasses of chickens found during the occurrence of disease underwent
   necropsy, and tissues were collected to confirm the infection. Gizzard,
   cecal tonsil, intestine, spleen and tumor mass were collected and
   analyzed from a carcass of one hen, 32 weeks old and apparently
   asymptomatic. Multiplex real-time PCR performed on spleen tissues
   detected the presence of MD virus pathogenic strain. Macroscopic and
   microscopic evaluation of the rest of the samples confirmed the
   neoplastic disease. Moreover, the immunophenotype of the tumor cells was
   identified as CD3 positive by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. The
   vaccinated flock had become rapidly infected with the MD virus, which
   proves that the challenge of the MD virus was too strong in the rearing
   house at the beginning of the cycle, causing the outbreak.},

Title = {Dolphins Stranded along the Tuscan Coastline (Central Italy) of the
   ``Pelagos Sanctuary{''}: A Parasitological Investigation},
Journal = {PATHOGENS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Parasite monitoring is considered a necessary step for cetacean
   management and conservation. Between February 2013 and July 2015, 26
   dolphins (15 Stenella coeruleoalba, 10 Tursiops truncatus, and one
   Grampus griseus) stranded along the Tuscan coastline of the protected
   marine area ``Pelagos Sanctuary{''}, were examined. Organs, tissues, and
   faecal and blood samples taken from all animals were analysed by
   parasitological, immunological, and molecular techniques. Twenty-one out
   of 26 dolphins (80.77\%) tested positive for at least one parasite
   species, and 13/15 (86.7\%) S. coeruleoalba, 7/10 (70\%) T. truncatus,
   and the single G. griseus were found positive. Identified parasites
   included the nematodes Skrjabinalius guevarai (7.69\%, 2/26), Halocercus
   lagenorhynchi (3.85\%, 1/26), Halocercus delphini (7.69\%, 2/26),
   Stenurus ovatus (7.69\%, 2/26), Crassicauda spp. (7.69\%, 2/26); the
   trematodes Pholeter gastrophilus (26.92\%, 7/26), Campula palliata
   (3.85\%, 1/26); the cestodes Phyllobothrium delphini (42.31\%, 11/26),
   Monorygma grimaldii (23.08\%, 6/26), Tetrabothrium forsteri (7.69\%,
   2/26), Strobilocephalus triangularis (7.69\%, 2/26), and the
   acanthocephalan Bolbosoma vasculosum (7.69\%, 2/26). Moreover, 6/26
   (23\%) animals scored positive to Toxoplasma gondii at serology, but PCR
   confirmed the infection (T. gondii Type II genotype) in a single animal.
   In examined dolphins, obtained results showed a high prevalence of
   endoparasites, which included species considered as a cause of severe
   debilitation or death.},

Title = {Innate Immune Response to Tick-Borne Pathogens: Cellular and Molecular
   Mechanisms Induced in the Hosts},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {21},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Many pathogens are transmitted by tick bites,
   includingAnaplasmaspp.,Ehrlichiaspp.,Rickettsiaspp.,BabesiaandTheilerias
   ensu stricto species. These pathogens cause infectious diseases both in
   animals and humans. Different types of immune effector mechanisms could
   be induced in hosts by these microorganisms, triggered either directly
   by pathogen-derived antigens or indirectly by molecules released by host
   cells binding to these antigens. The components of innate immunity, such
   as natural killer cells, complement proteins, macrophages, dendritic
   cells and tumor necrosis factor alpha, cause a rapid and intense
   protection for the acute phase of infectious diseases. Moreover, the
   onset of a pro-inflammatory state occurs upon the activation of the
   inflammasome, a protein scaffold with a key-role in host defense
   mechanism, regulating the action of caspase-1 and the maturation of
   interleukin-1 beta and IL-18 into bioactive molecules. During the
   infection caused by different microbial agents, very similar profiles of
   the human innate immune response are observed including secretion of
   IL-1 alpha, IL-8, and IFN-alpha, and suppression of superoxide
   dismutase, IL-1Ra and IL-17A release. Innate immunity is activated
   immediately after the infection and inflammasome-mediated changes in the
   pro-inflammatory cytokines at systemic and intracellular levels can be
   detected as early as on days 2-5 after tick bite. The ongoing research
   field of ``inflammasome biology{''} focuses on the interactions among
   molecules and cells of innate immune response that could be responsible
   for triggering a protective adaptive immunity. The knowledge of the
   innate immunity mechanisms, as well as the new targets of investigation
   arising by bioinformatics analysis, could lead to the development of new
   methods of emergency diagnosis and prevention of tick-borne infections.},

Title = {Field observations and experiences gained from the implementation of
   control measures against lumpy skin disease in South-East Europe between
   2015 and 2017},
Journal = {PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {181},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The first epidemics of lumpy skin disease (LSD) reported in Europe in
   2015 severely affected the cattle farming sector in several Balkan
   countries. After the first incursion into Greece in 2015, the disease
   quickly spread across the Balkan region with over 7000 outbreaks
   reported by the end of 2016. Thanks to a coordinated regional control
   and eradication policy, the spread of the disease was halted by the end
   of 2017. Regional large-scale vaccination campaign with effective
   homologous vaccines and high vaccination coverage revealed to be
   essential for the successful control the disease, supported by other
   measures such as early detection of outbreaks, total or partial stamping
   out and restrictions on cattle movements. The aim of this paper is to
   discuss the field observations, challenges and lessons learnt while
   dealing with the first LSD epidemics in Europe. The cross-border
   collaboration by the veterinary authorities of all affected countries,
   coordinated by the European Commission and the technical support
   provided by many other international organizations played a fundamental
   role in stopping the spread of a disease that otherwise could have
   expanded further to the European territory causing a large damage to the
   whole European cattle farming industry. The experience obtained during
   the control of LSD epidemics indicates that in the future LSD spread can
   be effectively halted, provided that appropriate surveillance plans and
   vigilance remains in place in the areas at risk of re-incursion,
   especially those bordering endemic countries.},

Abstract = {Betamethasone is a glucocorticoid authorised in cattle for the treatment
   of metabolic and inflammatory diseases, but, in Europe, it is illegally
   employed to improve productive performances. LC-MS/MS is the official
   control method of veterinary drugs residues in food of animal origin. An
   experimental study was developed to evaluate the feasibility of proton
   magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) as a potential alternative
   approach to detect the presence of betamethasone residues. Eight rat
   liver samples were collected 24 h post-betamethasone-treatment from
   experimental and control animals and were analysed by 1H-MRS using a
   7-Tesla MRI scanner. 1H-MR reference spectra both of the Bentelan
   formulation used for treatment, and of three solutions of betamethasone
   in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) at 5, 10 and 100 mM, respectively, were
   acquired to fit analyte-peaks in the liver samples spectra.
   Betamethasone-peaks were found only in the 100 mM betamethasone in DMSO
   solution spectrum. Betamethasone residues were not detected in any of
   the tissue samples analysed, probably related to the low concentration
   of injected drug. These findings allow us to establish, for the first
   time in the literature, the detection limit (in the range 10-100 mM) of
   betamethasone for the 7-Tesla MRI scanner used here. Given this very-low
   sensitivity, we conclude that the evaluated 1H-MR spectroscopy approach
   is not suitable for the detection of betamethasone residues in edible
   tissues, since the maximum residue limit imposed by Commission
   Regulation (EC) 37/2010 for betamethasone in the liver, and metabolic
   concentrations required to be detected in animal samples from livestock,
   are far below the detection limit we found.},

Abstract = {Purpose Local neck symptoms (LNS) may be related to goiter, but are also
   reported by patients suffering from laryngeal-pharyngeal reflux (LPR).
   The aim of this study was to investigate whether LPR could play a role
   in the persistence of some LNS after total thyroidectomy (TT). Methods A
   consecutive case series of 160 patients with multinodular goiter (MNG)
   candidate for TT were included in this study. Each patient was closely
   studied for both the thyroid pathology and reflux disease before and 6
   months after surgery to assess the persistence of LNS after surgery.
   Results Only throat discomfort showed a significant improvement (p =
   0.031) after surgery. On the other hand, swallowing and voice disorders
   persisted after surgery in 82.3\% and 77.3\% of patients, respectively
   (p = 0.250 andp = 0.062), such as the correlated reflux
   laryngopharyngitis (p = 0.5). Conclusions LPR can be considered a
   predisposing factor or an important concurrent causa to the persistence
   of LNS after TT, in particular for swallowing disorders and voice
   disorders. In patients with non-toxic MNG who complain of local neck
   symptoms, the investigation of a possible coexistence of a reflux
   disease is appropriate before surgery. Patients should be informed about
   the possibility that some symptoms can persist even after removal of the
   goiter.},

Abstract = {An analytical method, using ion chromatography coupled to high
   resolution mass spectrometry was developed and validated to quantify
   glyphosate, glufosinate, ethephon, fosetyl aluminium and their related
   metabolites. This method allows multiresidue analysis of 11 highly polar
   molecules in a single chromatographic run, without derivatization step,
   using acidified water with low level of acetonitrile as extraction
   solvent. Three different matrices that are representative of commodity
   group were studied and validated: one fruit (grapes), one cereal (wheat)
   and honey, according to the criteria established by SANTE/12682/2019
   taking into account maximum residue limits indicated by Regulation (EC)
   No. 396/2005, confirming that the procedure was selective, repeatable
   and robust. Matrix effect was studied and linearity was evaluated
   comparing analytical response differences between solvent standard
   solutions and matrix-matched calibration curve. Due to the relevant
   matrix effect observed, the use of response factor (RF) approach to
   quantify analytical batch was evaluated, using isotopically labelled
   internal standardisation. The in-depth study, validation results and
   several proficiency tests, used to verify procedure performance,
   demonstrated that the method is fit for purpose to routine analysis in
   an official laboratory. Moreover, it allows surveillance activities in
   fruits and vegetables control, as indicated by European Community,
   furthermore monitoring presence of polar pesticides, at low level, in
   some particular food as honey that could become environmental pollution
   indicator.},

Abstract = {Background Shigatoxin (Stx)-producingEscherichia coli(STEC) are the most
   common causes of hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS). The aim of our
   study is to compare the risk of developing STEC-HUS in relation to the
   type of Stx genes (Stx1, Stx2, or both). Methods This is a prospective,
   observational, multicenter study involving 63 pediatric units in
   Northern Italy (ItalKid-HUS Network). STEC-infected children were
   identified within a screening program for bloody diarrhea during a
   10-year period (2010-2019).Stxgenes were detected by reverse dot blot or
   real-time PCR. After the identification of STEC infection, children were
   followed until diarrhea complete recovery for the possible development
   of STEC-HUS. Results Of the 214 Stx-positive patients, 34 (15.9\%)
   developed STEC-HUS. The risk of HUS in STEC-infected children with Stx1
   (n: 62; 29.0\%) and Stx2 (n: 97; 45.3\%) was respectively 0\% and
   23.7\%, while in patients carrying both Stx1 and Stx2 (n: 55; 25.7\%),
   the risk was 12.7\% (p: 0.001). Conclusions Our data confirm that Stx1
   is a very rare cause of STEC-HUS and demonstrate that the risk of
   STEC-HUS halves in the case of Stx1+2-producingEscherichia coliinfection
   compared with infections where Stx2 is present alone. This observation
   is helpful in assessing the risk of individual STEC-infected patients
   for the development of HUS and suggests that Stx1, in the presence of
   Stx2, might exert a protective role possibly by receptor competition.},

Abstract = {Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is a widely used method for nucleic acid
   quantification of various pathogenic microorganisms. For absolute
   quantification of microbial load by qPCR, it is essential to create a
   calibration curve from accurately quantified quantification standards,
   from which the number of pathogens in a sample is derived.
   Spectrophotometric measurement of absorbance is a routine method for
   estimating nucleic acid concentration, however, it may be affected by
   presence of other potentially contaminating nucleic acids or proteins
   and salts. Therefore, absorbance measurement is not reliable for
   estimating the concentration of stock solutions of quantification
   standards, based on which they are subsequently diluted. In this study,
   we utilized digital PCR (dPCR) for absolute quantification of qPCR
   plasmid standards and thus detecting possible discrepancies in the
   determination of the plasmid DNA number of standards derived from UV
   spectrophotometry. The concept of dPCR utilization for quantification of
   standards was applied on 45 qPCR assays using droplet-based and
   chip-based dPCR platforms. Using dPCR, we found that spectrophotometry
   overestimated the concentrations of standard stock solutions in the
   majority of cases. Furthermore, batch-to-batch variation in standard
   quantity was revealed, as well as quantitative changes in standards over
   time. Finally, it was demonstrated that droplet-based dPCR is a suitable
   tool for achieving defined quantity of quantification plasmid standards
   and ensuring the quantity over time, which is crucial for acquiring
   homogenous, reproducible and comparable quantitative data by qPCR.},

Abstract = {Mosquitoes of theAedesgenus transmit arboviruses of great importance to
   human health as dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever. The tiger
   mosquitoAedes albopictuscan play an important role as arboviral vector,
   especially whenAedes aegyptiis absent or present at low levels.
   Remarkably, the rapid worldwide spreading of the tiger mosquito is
   expanding the risk of arboviral transmission also to temperate areas,
   and the autochthonous cases of chikungunya, dengue and Zika in Europe
   emphasize the need for improved monitoring and control. Proteomic and
   transcriptomic studies on blood feeding arthropod salivary proteins
   paved the way toward the exploitation of genus-specific mosquito
   salivary proteins for the development of novel tools to evaluate human
   exposure to mosquito bites. We previously found that the
   culicine-specific 34k2 salivary protein fromAe. albopictus(al34k2)
   evokes specific IgG responses in experimentally exposed mice, and
   provided preliminary evidence of its immunogenicity to humans. In this
   study we measured IgG responses to al34k2 and toAe. albopictussalivary
   gland protein extracts (SGE) in individuals naturally exposed to the
   tiger mosquito. Sera were collected in two areas of Northeast Italy
   (Padova and Belluno) during two different time periods: at the end of
   the low- and shortly after the high-density mosquito seasons. Anti-SGE
   and anti-al34k2 IgG levels increased after the summer period of exposure
   to mosquito bites and were higher in Padova as compared to Belluno. An
   age-dependent decrease of anti-saliva IgG responses was found especially
   in Padova, an area with at least 25 years history ofAe.
   albopictuscolonization. Moreover, a weak correlation between anti-saliva
   IgG levels and individual perception of mosquito bites by study
   participants was found. Finally, determination of anti-al34k2 IgG1 and
   IgG4 levels indicated a large predominance of IgG1 antibodies. Overall,
   this study provides a convincing indication that antibody responses to
   al34k2 may be regarded as a reliable candidate marker to detect temporal
   and/or spatial variation of human exposure toAe. albopictus; a
   serological tool of this kind may prove useful both for epidemiological
   studies and to estimate the effectiveness of anti-vectorial measures.},

Abstract = {Hepatozoon canisis a hemoprotozoan organism that infects domestic and
   wild carnivores throughout much of Europe. The parasite is mainly
   transmitted through the ingestion of infected ticks containing mature
   oocysts. The aims of the present survey were to determine the prevalence
   ofH. canisin hunting dogs living in Southern Italy and to assess
   potential infection risk factors. DNA extracted from whole blood
   samples, collected from 1433 apparently healthy dogs living in the
   Napoli, Avellino, and Salerno provinces of Campania region (Southern
   Italy), was tested by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
   (qPCR) assay to amplifyH. canis.Furthermore, the investigated dog
   population was also screened by qPCR for the presence ofEhrlichia canis,
   a major tick-borne pathogen in Southern Italy, in order to assess
   possible co-infections. Two hundred dogs wereH. canisPCR-positive,
   resulting in an overall prevalence of 14.0\% (CI 12.2-15.9). Breed
   category (P < 0.0001), hair coat length (P = 0.015), and province of
   residence (P < 0.0001) represented significant risk factors forH.
   canisinfection. The presence ofH. canisDNA was also significantly
   associated withE. canisPCR positivity (P < 0.0001). Hunting dogs in
   Campania region (Southern Italy) are frequently exposed toH. canis, and
   the infection is potentially associated with close contact with
   wildlife. Further studies are needed to assess the pathogenic potential
   ofH. canis, as well as the epidemiological relationships between hunting
   dogs and wild animal populations sharing the same habitats in Southern
   Italy.},

Abstract = {Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) and contagious caprine
   pleuropneumonia (CCPP) are major infectious diseases of ruminants caused
   by mycoplasmas in Africa and Asia. In contrast with the limited
   pathology in the respiratory tract of humans infected with mycoplasmas,
   CBPP and CCPP are devastating diseases associated with high morbidity
   and mortality. Beyond their obvious impact on animal health, CBPP and
   CCPP negatively impact the livelihood and wellbeing of a substantial
   proportion of livestock-dependent people affecting their culture,
   economy, trade and nutrition. The causative agents of CBPP and CCPP are
   Mycoplasma mycoides subspecies mycoides and Mycoplasma capricolum
   subspecies capripneumoniae, respectively, which have been eradicated in
   most of the developed world. The current vaccines used for disease
   control consist of a live attenuated CBPP vaccine and a bacterin vaccine
   for CCPP, which were developed in the 1960s and 1980s, respectively.
   Both of these vaccines have many limitations, so better vaccines are
   urgently needed to improve disease control. In this article the research
   community prioritized biomedical research needs related to challenge
   models, rational vaccine design and protective immune responses.
   Therefore, we scrutinized the current vaccines as well as the
   challenge-, pathogenicity- and immunity models. We highlight research
   gaps and provide recommendations towards developing safer and more
   efficacious vaccines against CBPP and CCPP.},

Abstract = {Two organic acids isomers, 3-isopropylmalic acid (3-IPMA) and
   2-isopropylmalic acid (2-IPMA), were identified and quantified in wine
   samples by using an LC-MS/MS method without any chromatographic
   separation, but processing the MS/MS data with a recently developed
   deconvolution algorithm (LEDA: linear equations deconvolution analysis),
   thus decreasing the time necessary for the process. In particular, the
   LEDA tool processes the MS/MS signals and assigns the relative
   concentrations (abundances) of the isomers in the sample, at the mg
   L(-1)level. The efficiency of MS/MS signal assignment was improved by
   introducing five linear equations to define the LEDA matrix. Then, as a
   novel approach, an overdetermined system of linear equations was applied
   for the deconvolution of isomers. The use of LEDA to identify and
   quantify the isomers in wine samples, together with the choice of a
   short LC column and a fast elution gradient, simplifies the process and
   shortens the time needed. Furthermore, it was evaluated the quantitative
   determination of the IPMA isomers by using the calibration curve
   provided by the precursor ion MRM transition data. The calculated values
   of accuracy (recovery between 82.6\% and 99.8\%) and precision (RSD
   between 0.4\% and 4.0\%) confirm the validity of this quantitative
   approach and the ability of LEDA to establish the correct percentage of
   the MS/MS signal for each isomer. Finally, to compare the conventional
   LC-MS/MS method and our proposed method of LC-MS/MS coupled with LEDA
   post-processing elaboration, a series of real wine samples were analysed
   by both methods, and the results were compared.},

Title = {In vitroCytokine Responses to Virulent PRRS Virus Strains},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) affects farmed
   swine causing heavy direct and indirect losses. The infections sustained
   by PRRS viruses (PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2) may give rise to severe clinical
   cases. This highlights the issue of PRRSV pathogenicity and relevant
   markers thereof. Since PRRSV strains can be discriminated in terms of
   immunotypes, we aimed to detect possible correlates of virulencein
   vitrobased on the profile of innate immune responses induced by strains
   of diverse virulence. To this purpose, 10 field PRRSV isolates were
   investigated in assays of innate immune response to detect possible
   features associated with virulence. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha,
   interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-8, IL-10, and caspase-1 were measured in
   cultures of PRRSV-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells of
   PRRS-naive pigs, unable to support PRRSV replication. Two reference
   PRRSV strains (highly pathogenic and attenuated, respectively), were
   included in the screening. The PRRSV strains isolated from field cases
   were shown to vary widely in terms of inflammatory cytokine responsesin
   vitro, which were substantially lacking with some strains including the
   reference, highly pathogenic one. In particular, neither the field PRRSV
   isolates nor the reference highly pathogenic strain gave rise to an
   IL-1beta response, which was consistently induced by the attenuated
   strain, only. This pattern of response was reversed in an inflammatory
   environment, in which the attenuated strain reduced the ongoing IL-1beta
   response. Results indicate that some pathogenic PRRSV strains can
   prevent a primary inflammatory response of PBMCs, associated with
   reduced permissiveness of mature macrophages for PRRSV replication in
   later phases.},

Abstract = {TheLagovirusgenus comprises both pathogenic viruses as European brown
   hare syndrome virus (EBHSV- GII.1) and rabbit hemorrhagic disease
   viruses (RHDV-GI.1 and RHDV2-GI.2), that principally infect European
   brown hares (Lepus europeaus) and European rabbits (Oryctolagus
   cuniculus), respectively, causing severe necrotic hepatitis, spleen
   enlargement and disseminated haemorrhage. This genus includes also
   non-pathogenic agents, such as rabbit calicivirus (RCV-E1 - GI.3) and
   the non-pathogenic hareLagovirus, provisionally named hare calicivirus
   (HaCV - GII.2). The latter had been identified for the first time in
   2012 in the gut contents and faeces of healthy young hares raised in a
   breeding farm. In this study, we further investigated the presence of
   HaCV by testing the intestinal tract of 621 wild hares collected between
   2010 and 2018 in Northern and Central Italy, and in 2011 in Austria,
   Germany and Spain. These wild hares were found dead for causes other
   than EBHS or were healthy hares shot during the hunting season.
   Forty-three out of 322 hare samples from Italy and 14 out of 299 samples
   from Austria and Germany were positive for HaCV-GII.2 by RT-PCR using
   universal primers for lagoviruses and primers specific for HaCV.
   Sequence analysis of the full capsid protein gene conducted on 12
   strains representative of different years and locations indicated that
   these viruses belong to the same, single cluster as the prototype strain
   initially identified at the hares' farm (HaCV\_Bs12\_1). The relatively
   high level of genetic variation (88\% nt identity) within this cluster
   suggests HaCVs may have been circulating widely in Europe for some time.},

   tested by monitoring abilities of 3-day enrichments to form clear lytic
   halos on a lawn ofVibriopreys, by the plaque assay. Out of 12 seawater

Abstract = {Background Peptic ulcer is a widespread disease, frequently complicated
   by perforation and bleeding. Administrative databases are useful tool to
   perform epidemiological and drug utilization studies, but they need a
   validation process based on a comparison with the original data
   contained in the medical charts. Our aim was to evaluate the accuracy of
   the ICD-9 codes in identifying patients with peptic ulcer and
   gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the regional administrative database of
   Umbria. Methods The index test of our study was the hospital discharge
   abstract database of the Umbria region (Italy), while the reference
   standard was the clinical information collected in the medical charts.
   The study population were adult patients with a hospital discharge for
   peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the period 2012-2014. A
   random sample of cases and non-cases was selected and the corresponding
   medical charts were reviewed. Cases of peptic ulcer were confirmed based
   on endoscopy, radiology, and surgery, while adjudication of
   gastrointestinal hemorrhage was based on presence of hematemesis,
   melena, and rectal bleeding. Results Overall, we reviewed 445 clinical
   charts of cases and 80 clinical charts of non-cases. The diagnostic
   accuracy results were: code 531 (gastric ulcer), sensitivity and NPV
   98\%, specificity 88\%, and PPV 91\%; code 532 (duodenal ulcer),
   sensitivity and NPV 100\%, specificity and PPV 98\%; code 534
   (gastrojejunal ulcer), sensitivity and NPV 100\%, specificity 70\%, and
   PPV 45\%; code 578 (gastrointestinal hemorrhage), sensitivity 96\%,
   specificity 90\%, PPV and NPV 94\%. Conclusions Our results showed a
   high level of diagnostic accuracy for most of the codes considered. The
   ICD-9 code 534 of gastrojejunal ulcer had a lower level of specificity
   and PPV due to false positives, being mainly misclassifications for
   coding errors. These validated codes can be used for future
   epidemiological studies and for health services research.},

Abstract = {The heterogeneous morphologic features of canine plasmacytomas (PCTs)
   can make their differentiation from other round cell tumors challenging.
   Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for lambda (lambda) and kappa (k)
   immunoglobulin (Ig) light chains is often equivocal because of high
   background staining. The chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH)
   technique for light chains has shown higher sensitivity compared to IHC
   in human plasma cell tumors. Therefore, we aimed to validate automated
   CISH for light chains in canine tissues and to evaluate its diagnostic
   potential in canine PCTs, in conjunction with routinely used IHC
   markers. CISH for light chains demonstrated a clear signal in plasma
   cell populations of canine control tissues (lymph nodes,
   lymphoplasmacytic inflammation) showing a polyclonal pattern with a
   prevalence of lambda-producing cells. CISH detected monotypic light
   chain expression in 33 of 53 (62\%) PCTs, 31 expressing lambda and 2
   expressing k. CISH was more sensitive than IHC for lambda light chain
   (58\% vs. 47\%, respectively) and more easily interpretable given the
   absence of confounding background staining. The absence of CISH staining
   for both lambda and k in a considerable subset of tumors may be the
   result of lower light chain production by neoplastic cells. Multiple
   myeloma oncogene 1 (MUM1) was expressed by all but 2 PCTs (96\%), which
   showed lambda expression by CISH and IHC. The identification of poorly
   differentiated canine PCTs requires the assessment of a panel of IHC
   markers, with the potential support of CISH for Ig light chains.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of intra-monthly
   variability of some physiological and blood parameters in pigs under
   different environmental conditions. For this purpose, 10 pigs (five
   males and five females) coming from a Sicilian farm were used. On all
   animals, rectal temperature, respiratory rate and blood sampling were
   carried out every five days, at six-time points under different
   environmental conditions, for the whole month of July 2017. For each
   period, ambient temperature, the relative humidity and the
   temperature-humidity index (THI) were recorded. Blood samples were
   tested for haematological (RBC, WBC, Hb, Hct) and haematochemical (GLU,
   TRIG, CHOL, TP, ALB and CREA) analyses. Our results showed a
   statistically significant effect of time (P< 0.05) on rectal
   temperature, haematological and haematochimical parameters. CREA and
   respiratory rate have not shown statistically significant effect of
   time. Our data indicate that the majority of parameters evaluated in the
   present study showed variations related to changes in environmental
   conditions and to high ambient temperature. These results provide
   information into the physiological responses of pigs to different
   environmental conditions and could be useful to optimize the husbandry
   practices and provide useful information for monitoring changes in the
   health status of pigs.},

Title = {Shedding light on cashmere goat hair follicle biology: from morphology

Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},

Abstract = {BackgroundCashmere goat is known for its precious undercoat. Being
   photoperiod-dictated, cashmere growth has been studied focusing mainly
   on hair follicle cycle phases (anagen, catagen and telogen). An accurate
   molecular knowledge of the goat hair follicle cycle, disentangling gene
   expression changes during phases and recognizing timing boundaries,
   could be useful to improve cashmere goat management and ultimately
   cashmere production.ResultsTo better describe goat's hair follicle
   transcriptome we applied RNA-sequencing to isolated hair follicles from
   five Italian cashmere goats, during the anagen and catagen phase,
   identifying total of 214 differentially expressed genes (DEGs): 97 were
   up-regulated while 117 were down-regulated in catagen with respect to
   anagen. Gene Ontology and pathway analysis were performed. We detected
   144 significant pathways spanning from estrogen, pluripotency of stem
   cells, thermogenesis and fatty acid metabolism that were strongly
   expressed during the hair follicle phases analysed. Finally, we
   validated promising DEGs by RT-qPCR in the same set of samples as well
   as in hair follicles and entire skin biopsies of another cashmere goats
   cohort accounting for early anagen, anagen, early catagen, and catagen
   phases.ConclusionsAs in the isolated hair follicles, some target genes
   were homogenously modulated during the four hair follicle phases.
   Ceruloplasmin (CP) and Keratin 4 (K4), confirmed their clear cut
   expression between growing and resting phase. In fact, K4 was almost
   absent in catagen phases while CP was barely expressed in anagen phases.
   In particular, the strong expression of K4 in early anagen makes it an
   eligible marker to track the beginning of a new hair cycle, and
   therefore defining the optimum time for cashmere harvesting.},

Abstract = {Comprehensive understanding of the patterns and drivers of avian
   influenza outbreaks is pivotal to inform surveillance systems and
   heighten nations' ability to quickly detect and respond to the emergence
   of novel viruses. Starting in early 2017, the Italian poultry sector has
   been involved in the massive H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza
   epidemic that spread in the majority of the European countries in
   2016/2017. Eighty-three outbreaks were recorded in north-eastern Italy,
   where a densely populated poultry area stretches along the Lombardy,
   Emilia-Romagna and Veneto regions. The confirmed cases, affecting both
   the rural and industrial sectors, depicted two distinct epidemic waves.
   We adopted a combination of multivariate statistics techniques and
   multi-model regression selection and inference, to investigate how
   environmental factors relate to the pattern of outbreaks diversity with
   respect to their spatiotemporal and genetic diversity. Results showed
   that a combination of eco-climatic and host density predictors were
   associated with the outbreaks pattern, and variation along gradients was
   noticeable among genetically and geographically distinct groups of avian
   influenza cases. These regional contrasts may be indicative of a
   different mechanism driving the introduction and spreading routes of the
   influenza virus in the domestic poultry population. This methodological
   approach may be extended to different spatiotemporal scale to foster
   site-specific, ecologically informed risk mitigating strategies.},

Abstract = {Ciauscolo is a fermented sausage with the Protected Geographical
   Indication (PGI) status. To disclose the microbial ecology of a model
   Ciauscolo salami manufacture during its natural fermentation, viable
   counting, amplicon-based sequencing and real-time PCR were applied. The
   volatilome during fermentation was also characterized. The results
   allowed previously undetected species to be discovered. The core
   microbiota was composed by Lactobacillus algidus, Leuconostoc carnosum,
   Lactobacillus sakei, Debaryomyces hansenii, Glomus hyderabadensis,
   Tilletiopsis washingtonensis, and Kurtzmaniella zeylanoides. Salmonella
   spp. and Listeria monocytogenes were absent in all the samples;
   moreover, multiplex real-time PCR revealed the absence of the target
   genes bont/A, bont/B, bont/E, bont/F, and 4gyrB (CP), encoding botulinic
   toxins. Volatilome, deeply depending on microbiological metabolism, was
   characterized by spices-derived components. Limonene, sabinene, alpha-
   and beta-pinene, 3-carene, and alpha-thujene were the most represented
   monoterpene hydrocarbons, whereas beta- and alpha-copaene were the most
   represented sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. Allyl methyl sulphide and
   diallyl disulphide were the major aliphatic sulphur compounds, together
   with diallyl sulphide and allyl methyl disulphide.},

Title = {Genetic tools discriminate strains of Leishmania infantum isolated from
   humans and dogs in Sicily, Italy},
Journal = {PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Background Leishmaniasis is one of the most important vector-borne
   diseases and it represents a serious world health problem affecting
   millions of people. High levels of Leishmania infections, affecting both
   humans and animals, are recognized among Italian regions. Among these,
   Sicily has one of the highest prevalence of Leishmania infection.
   Methodology/Principal Findings Seventy-eight Leishmania strains isolated
   from human and animal samples across Sicily, were analyzed for the
   polymorphic k26-gene and genotypes were assigned according to the size
   of the PCR products. A multilocus microsatellite typing (MLMT) approach
   based on the analysis of 11 independent loci was used to investigate
   populations structure and genetic diversity of the isolated strains. Six
   L. infantum reference strains were included in the analysis for
   comparison. Bayesian clustering analysis of microsatellite data showed
   that all the isolated strains clustered in two genetically distinct
   populations, corresponding to human and canine isolates respectively. A
   further subdivision was observed between the two main groups, giving a
   good correlation between human strains and their geographic origin,
   conversely canine population showed a great genetic variability diffused
   in the territory.
   Conclusions/Significance Among the 78 Leishmania isolates, K26 analysis
   detected 71 samples (91\%) as MON-1 zymodeme, confirming it as the
   predominant strain in Mediterranean area and 7 human samples (9\%) as
   non-MON-1. MLMT gives important insights into the epidemiology of
   leishmaniases and allows characterization of different strains to a
   higher resolution than possible with zymodeme typing. Two main
   populations presented a strong correlation respect to the different
   hosts, exhibiting a co-circulation of two distinct populations of L.
   infantum. The population found in infected humans exhibited a
   correlation with geographic origin. These clusters could represent a
   geographically restricted population of strains with the same or related
   genotypes. This study can contribute to an understanding of Leishmania
   epidemiology, including the spread of reservoirs and sand fly vectors in
   the different foci of infection, characterizing parasites within the
   different hosts.
   Author summary High levels of Leishmania spp. infections affecting both
   humans and animals are recognized among Italian regions; in particular,
   Sicily is an endemic area for Leishmania infantum. In this study 78
   Sicilian L. infantum strains isolated from humans and dogs were assessed
   to investigate their biodiversity by genetic tools. Results were
   compared with 6 L. infantum reference strains included in the analysis.
   The evaluation of K26 genetic markers identified 91\% of samples as
   belonging to the MON-1 zymodeme, confirming it as the predominant strain
   in the Mediterranean area and 9\% of the samples-all isolated from
   humans-as non-MON-1. Multilocus microsatellite typing has proven to be a
   powerful tool to discriminate strains showing all the isolated strains
   clustered in two genetically distinct populations, corresponding to
   human and canine isolates, respectively. A further subdivision was
   observed between the two main groups, giving in the human population a
   correlation between microsatellite profile and geographical origin. Our
   results demonstrate that genetic tools are able to discriminate
   Leishmania strains and to give useful insights into the epidemiology of
   leishmaniasis, raising questions on the role of dogs as main reservoirs
   for human leishmaniasis in the Sicily region.},

   Mycoplasma bovis and Mycoplasma dispar, contribute to BRD in young
   calves, but their role in the disease in older cattle has not been
   investigated. In this study, ten heads of cattle were selected from each
   of the 24 groups kept in 13 different farms. Bulls were sampled by nasal
   swabbing at 0, 15, and 60 days after arrival for Mycoplasma isolation.
   Identification was carried out by 16S-rDNA PCR followed by denaturing
   gradient gel electrophoresis. M. bovis, M. dispar, and M. bovirhinis
   were identified, and prevalence was analysed by mixed-effects logistic
   regression models. This showed that most bulls arrived free of M. bovis,
   but within two weeks, approximately 40\% became infected, decreasing to
   13\% by the last sampling. In contrast, the prevalence of M. dispar was
   not dependent on time or seasonality, while M. bovirhinis only showed a
   seasonality-dependent trend. The Italian fattening system creates an
   ideal environment for infection with M. bovis, probably originating from
   previously stabled animals.},

Title = {Environmental surveillance of human enteric viruses in wastewaters,

Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {38},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Enteric viruses represent a public health risk since they are involved
   in foodborne and waterborne outbreaks. The aim of this study was to
   investigate the circulation of select human enteric viruses - hepatitis
   A virus (HAV), noroviruses (NoVGI and NoVGII), adenovirus (AdV),
   rotavirus (RV), astrovirus (AsV), sapovirus (SaV) and aichivirus (AiV) -
   in wastewater and in environmental samples (groundwater, surface water
   and sediments) of Campania Region, southern Italy, with the goal of
   evaluating their circulation in the environment and to characterize the
   circulating strains by phylogenetic analysis. A total of 199 water and
   sediment samples were collected from rivers, dams, wells and wastewater
   treatment plants (WWTPs) in all provinces of the Campania Region and
   analysed by real-time qPCR for the detection of viruses, after a
   concentration step with organic flocculation. This study provides
   information on the qualitative and quantitative spread of human enteric
   viruses in the environment and their potential health risk. In our
   samples all the viral families were detected, with different prevalence.
   Among the investigated viruses, RV was the most prevalent and
   concentrated virus in surface water and sediments, with AsV being
   prevalent and concentrated in wastewater. The prevalence of viral
   pathogens was not influenced by season for almost all enteric viruses,
   except for NoVGII in WWTPs. Within the WWTPs, a significant reduction in
   the average concentration levels was observed for all viral targets from
   the influent to the effluent except for the HAV and AiV. The results of
   our study confirmed the importance of environmental surveillance that
   can represent a key tool for pollution control and human risk exposure.

Abstract = {Simple Summary Domestic and wild pigs are the main Hepatitis E virus
   (HEV) zoonotic reservoirs. Identifying HEV-positive pig farms is
   important to implement surveillance programs for this emerging zoonotic
   agent. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of serosanguineous
   fluids obtained as part of castration practice (processing fluids (PFs))
   to detect anti-HEV antibodies. Ninety-five paired serum and PF samples
   were collected from newborn piglets of 29 different litters and tested
   with a commercial ELISA kit. A significant positive correlation
   (Spearman's rho: 0.600;p< 0.01) was found between the signal-to-cutoff
   (S/Co) ratio of anti-HEV antibodies in serum and PF samples. In 26 out
   of 29 litters (89.7\%), there was at least one positive piglet in the
   serum. Sixteen litters out of 29 (55.2\%) were also positive in PFs. The
   detection of anti-HEV maternal-derived antibodies in PFs confirms a past
   exposure of sows to the virus. PF may represent a rapid, noninvasive and

   limit of detection of the ELISA was assessed mixing the PF sample with
   strong, medium, medium-weak and weak ELISA titres with 3, 4, 5 and 6
   negative PF samples. Our results suggest that it is still possible to
   identify a positive PF pool when at least one individual PF sample with
   medium or strong antibody levels is mixed with 5 or 6 individual
   negative PF samples. The detection of anti-HEV maternal-derived

Abstract = {The illegal administration of glucocorticoids in livestock is
   problematic and identification of pathways in which these hormones are
   involved is critically important, and new direct or indirect biomarkers
   should be identified. In this work, glucocorticoid transcriptional
   effects on some genes involved in the glucose metabolism were studied in
   the bovine liver. This study was conducted on adult Charolais male
   cattle treated with long-term low dose dexamethasone or prednisolone.
   Gene expression analysis was conducted in the liver by qPCR, and the
   geNorm algorithm was applied to select optimal reference genes. In line
   with the literature, a significant overexpression of genes involved in
   the gluconeogenic pathway and glycogen synthesis was detected in the
   liver of dexamethasone-treated animals, but histological and biochemical
   examination showed hepatocyte glycogen depletion particularly in
   dexamethasone-treated animals. It possible to hypothesize that
   glucocorticoids or adrenal insufficiency due to glucocorticoids
   withdrawal inhibit the enzymatic activity of glycogen synthase and/or
   induce glycogen autophagy in bovine liver. In fact, markers of
   glycophagy as starch-binding domain-containing protein 1 and
   gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein-like 1 mRNAs were
   upregulated in the liver by glucocorticoids treatment. Furthermore,
   glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta gene was significantly overexpressed in
   dexamethasone-treated animals, and this protein is also implicated in
   liver autophagy modulation and glycogen synthesis inhibition. These
   results showed that glucocorticoids likley have dual roles in hepatic
   glycogen metabolism of cattle, and investigation of these pathways could
   help find treatment biomarkers. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {We describe two cases of skin co-infections with epitheliotropic
   viruses, detected in two cattle during lumpy skin disease (LSD)
   surveillance in northern Italy. A diagnostic protocol including
   different molecular methods as well as negative staining electron
   microscopy was applied to detect the most common viral agents belonging
   to the family Papillomaviridae, Poxviridaeand Herpesviridae which cause
   skin diseases in cattle. Two specimens were collected from cases
   clinically diagnosed as papillomatosis and pseudo-LSD. Both skin lesions
   were shown to harbor more than one viral species. This case report
   shows, for the first time, co-infection of zoonotic parapoxvirus with
   bovine papillomavirus and herpesvirus in skin lesions of cattle. In
   particular, the simultaneous presence of virions morphologically
   referable to parapoxvirus and papillomavirus confirms that the
   replication of both viruses in the same lesion can happen and the
   so-called papillomatosis can bear zoonotic viruses.},

Title = {Graphene, other carbon nanomaterials and the immune system: toward
   nanoimmunity-by-design},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-MATERIALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {3},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Carbon-based materials (CBMs), such as graphene, nanodiamonds, carbon
   fibers, and carbon dots, have attracted a great deal scientific
   attention due to their potential as biomedical tools. Following
   exposure, particularly intravenous injection, these nanomaterials can be
   recognized by immune cells. Such interactions could be modulated by the
   different physicochemical properties of the materials (e.g. structure,
   size, and chemical functions), by either stimulating or suppressing the
   immune response. However, a harmonized cutting-edge approach for the
   classification of these materials based not only on their
   physicochemical parameters but also their immune properties has been
   missing. The European Commission-funded G-IMMUNOMICS and CARBO-IMmap
   projects aimed to fill this gap, developing a functional pipeline for
   the qualitative and quantitative immune characterization of graphene,
   graphene-related materials (GRMs), and other CBMs. The goal was to open
   breakthrough perspectives for the definition of the immune profiles of
   these materials. Here, we summarize our methodological approach, key
   results, and the necessary multidisciplinary expertise ranging across
   various fields, from material chemistry to engineering, immunology,
   toxicology, and systems biology. G-IMMUNOMICS, as a partnering project
   of the Graphene Flagship, the largest scientific research initiative on
   graphene worldwide, also complemented the studies performed in the
   Flagship on health and environmental impact of GRMs. Finally, we present
   the nanoimmunity-by-design concept, developed within the projects, which
   can be readily applied to other 2D materials. Overall, the G-IMMUNOMICS
   and CARBO-IMmap projects have provided new insights on the immune impact
   of GRMs and CBMs, thus laying the foundation for their safe use and
   future translation in medicine.},

Abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   chemical-nutritional parameters, oxidative stability and volatile
   profile of eggs and cakes made with eggs from laying hens fed with a
   dietary supplementation of extruded linseed.
   Methods: Two thousand ISA Warren laying hens were randomly divided into
   two groups: a control group was fed with a standard diet while the
   experimental group received the same diet supplemented with 7\% of
   extruded linseed. The trial lasted 84 days, in which three samplings of
   laid eggs were performed. Samples of eggs and food systems arising from
   eggs were then analyzed in order to obtain information about 13-carotene
   and total flavonoid content, antioxidant activity, fatty acid profile,
   lipid oxidation, and volatile profile.
   Results: Linseed induced the increase of alpha-linolenic acid with
   consequent reduction of the omega-6/omega-3 ratio (4.3:1 in egg yolk);
   in addition to this, was evidenced the cholesterol reduction and the
   significant increase in total flavonoids and 13-carotene, although no
   variations were detected in antioxidant capacity. Even in cooked
   products there was not only a direct effect of linseed in increasing
   ?-linolenic acid, but also in inducing the reduction of cholesterol and
   its major oxidation product, 7-ketocholesterol. The dietary linseed
   integration was also shown to affect the volatile profile of baked
   products.
   Conclusion: Data confirmed that dietary supplementation with extruded
   linseed resulted in food products with interesting implications for
   human health. With regard to the volatile profile of baked products it
   would be necessary undertake further sensorial analysis in order to
   evaluate any variations on flavor and consumer acceptability.},

Abstract = {Shiga toxin-producingEscherichia coli(STEC) infections result in a
   significant public health impact because of the severity of the disease
   that, in young children especially, can lead to hemolytic-uremic
   syndrome (HUS). A rise in the number of HUS cases was observed in the
   Apulia region of Italy from 2013 to 2017, and so, in 2018, a
   symptom-based surveillance system for children with bloody diarrhea (BD)
   was initiated in order to detect and manage STEC infections. The
   objective of the study was to describe the epidemiology of STEC
   infections in children from June 2018 to August 2019. Children <15 years
   old with BD were hospitalized and tested for STEC. Real-time PCR for
   virulence genes (stx1,stx2,eae) and serogroup identification tests were
   performed on stool samples/rectal swabs of cases. STEC infection was
   detected in 87 (10.6\%) BD cases. The median age of STEC cases was 2.7
   years, and 60 (68.9\%) were <4. Of these 87 cases, 12 (13.8\%) came from
   households with diarrhea. The reporting rate was 14.2/100,000, with the
   highest incidence in cases from the province of Bari (24.2/100,000).
   Serogroups O26 and O111 were both detected in 22/87 (25.3\%) cases.
   Co-infections occurred in 12.6\% of cases (11/87). Twenty-nine STEC were
   positive forstx1,stx2, andeae. Five cases (5.7\%) caused by O26 (n = 2),
   O111 (n = 2), and O45 (n = 1) developed into HUS. A risk-oriented
   approach based on the testing of children with BD during the summer may
   represent a potentially beneficial option to improve the sensitivity of
   STEC surveillance, not only in Italy but also in the context of Europe
   as a whole.},

Abstract = {The Autonomous Province of Bolzano-South Tyrol (APB), located in the
   northernmost territory of the Italian eastern Alps, is still considered
   non-endemic for canine leishmaniosis (CanL) despite clinical cases being
   observed and a competent Leishmania infantum vector (Phlebotomus
   perniciosus) having been recorded since 2008. A serological survey of
   leishmaniosis among a randomly-selected subpopulation of registered
   owned dogs was carried in 2018, followed by entomological investigations
   performed in 2019 and driven by canine survey results. A total of 457
   resident dogs from all over the APB territory were examined through IFAT
   for antibodies against L.infantum, of which 63 (13.8\%) tested positive.
   Thirty-five seropositive cases (7.7\%) were considered autochthonous to
   APB, i.e. dogs born and lived in the province, or imported dogs with no
   travel history in the past 5 years. Most of these animals showed an
   antibody titre at the threshold level of 1:40, suggesting a low degree
   of parasite transmission/contacts. In 2 autochthonous cases with
   moderately high IFAT titre, the infection was confirmed by nested-PCR in
   peripheral blood. Thirty-one georeferenced sites were monitored for sand
   flies by means of interception (sticky papers) and attraction (CDC
   miniature light traps) collection devices. Traps were set during summer
   approximately on monthly basis, and extended up to October for positive
   sites. Only 2 sites were found positive for a total of 317 phlebotomine
   specimens collected by sticky traps, which included a previously known
   P. perniciosus-endemic site near Bolzano town. Sergentomyia minuta was
   by far the most prevalent (98.1\%) and the only recorded sand fly
   species in the most northerly Italian site ever investigated (Coldrano
   municipality in Venosta valley). For the first time, Leishmania serology
   and n-PCR positive dogs autochthonous to APB were identified, however
   the spread of sand flies competent for L. infantum transmission could
   not be demonstrated in several places where endemic seropositive cases
   were recorded. APB can be considered a territory of low CanL endemicity,
   however awareness and continuous monitoring are needed to detect changes
   in the epidemiological status of the zoonosis.},

Abstract = {The crosstalk between human gut microbiota and intestinal wall is
   essential for the organ's homeostasis and immune tolerance. The gut
   microbiota plays a role in healthy and pathological conditions mediated
   by inflammatory processes or by the gut-brain axes, both involving a
   possible role for S100B protein as a diffusible cytokine present not
   only in intestinal mucosa but also in faeces. In order to identify
   target proteins for a putative interaction between S100B and the
   microbiota proteome, we developed a bioinformatics workflow by
   integrating the interaction features of known domains with the
   proteomics data derived from metataxonomic studies of the gut microbiota
   from healthy and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) subjects. On the basis
   of the microbiota composition, proteins putatively interacting with
   S100B domains were in fact found, both in healthy subjects and IBD
   patients, in a reduced number in the latter samples, also exhibiting
   differences in interacting domains occurrence between the two groups. In
   addition, differences between ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease
   samples were observed. These results offer the conceptual framework for
   where to investigate the role of S100B as a candidate signalling
   molecule in the microbiota/gut communication machinery, on the basis of
   interactions differently conditioned by healthy or pathological
   microbiota.},

   analysed by Knott's test and duplex real-time PCR, respectively.
   Dirofilaria immitis was the most prevalent filarioid (44.2\%), while
   Culex pipiens was the most prevalent mosquito species (68.8\%). This
   high prevalence of D. immitis infection confirms this location as one of

Title = {Study on the Public Perception of ``Community-Owned Dogs{''} in the
   Abruzzo Region, Central Italy},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Simple Summary The present study was conducted in the Abruzzo Region,
   central Italy, to investigate the public perception towards
   ``community-owned dogs{''} (CODs); i.e., whether their presence is
   perceived as a problem or a benefit by the local communities. The data
   were collected by both direct interviews and an online survey, based on
   a questionnaire developed by a multidisciplinary team. The questionnaire
   was distributed in 31 municipalities sampled on the basis of the
   urbanization rate, and 497 people were interviewed over 9 months. The
   majority (83\%) believed that a greater commitment is needed to involve
   the local communities on issues regarding CODs. The findings of this
   study highlighted the general difficulty for people to distinguish stray
   dogs from CODs that are not fully known, as evidenced by the fact that
   59\% of the respondents are not aware of the Regional Law that defines
   and regulates the presence of the CODs. The Abruzzo Regional Law Nr.
   47/2013, following a circular from the Italian Ministry of Health and
   OIE recommendations, allows the local municipalities to release
   free-roaming dogs (FRDs) caught on the territory once the local
   veterinary services (LVSs) have rated the dogs as unowned and not
   aggressive, have neutered them, as well as identified them through a
   microchip and a visible collar. The responsibility of these
   ``community-owned dogs{''} (CODs) falls under the mayor of the local
   municipality that can entrust their custody to qualified people. The
   present study was conducted in the Abruzzo region, located in central
   Italy, to investigate public perception towards CODs, and in particular
   whether their presence is perceived as a problem or a benefit by the
   local communities. The data were collected by both direct interviews and
   an online survey, based on a questionnaire developed by a
   multidisciplinary team. The questionnaire was distributed in 31
   municipalities sampled on the basis of the urbanization rate, and 497
   people were interviewed over a 9-month period. More than half of the
   respondents (54\%) stated that CODs can contribute to the control of
   stray dogs. The majority (83\%) believed that a greater commitment is
   needed to involve the local communities on issues regarding CODs. The
   findings of this study highlighted the general difficulty for people to
   distinguish stray dogs from CODs that are not fully known, as evidenced
   by the fact that 59\% of the respondents did not know the aforementioned
   Regional Law that defines and regulates the presence of the CODs.},

Abstract = {The continuous collection and analysis of updated data on the
   antimicrobic resistance among bacterial strains represent the essential
   core for the surveillance of this problem. The present work aimed to
   investigate the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance
   amongSalmonellaserovars isolated in foods in 2015-2019. A total of
   178Salmonellastrains belonging to 39 serovars were tested against 10
   antimicrobials. High proportions ofSalmonellaisolates were resistant to
   tetracycline (n= 53.9\%), ciprofloxacin (n= 47.2\%), ampicillin (n=
   44.4\%), nalidixic acid (n= 42.7\%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
   (n= 38.8\%). Different resistance rates were recorded among the
   different serotypes ofSalmonella,andS.Infantis, exhibited the highest
   resistance to antibiotics. A high percentage of strains isolated from
   poultry, pork, and bovine were resistant to at least one or two
   antimicrobials. Resistant and multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains were
   also recorded among the isolates from molluscan shellfish; however, the
   occurrence of resistantSalmonellastrains isolated from this source was
   significantly lower compared with those reported for poultry, pork, and
   bovine. The high levels of resistance reported in the present study
   indicate a potential public health risk. Consequently, additional
   hygiene and antibiotic stewardship practices should be considered for
   the food industry to prevent the prevalence ofSalmonellain foods.},

Title = {Pathological, Bacteriological and Virological Findings in Sudden and
   Unexpected Deaths in Young Dogs},

Abstract = {Simple Summary ``Sudden death{''} has been defined by the World Health
   Organization as a non-violent, unexpected death occurring less than 24 h
   from the onset of symptoms. The causes of sudden death have been widely
   investigated in human forensic medicine. In contrast, few studies have
   been reported in the veterinary literature. This study aimed to
   investigate the frequency of sudden deaths in young dogs in different
   age ranges. A secondary aim was to collect information regarding
   clinical symptoms, and pathological and microbiological findings related
   to sudden death in young dogs. The results of the present study
   demonstrate that the highest frequency of sudden death occurs in animals
   in an age range from 10 days to 1 month and from 6 to 12 months. The
   most frequently observed clinical symptoms in cases of sudden death were
   acute respiratory symptoms. Furthermore,Canine parvovirus type 2,E.
   coli,Canine Distemper Virus, Clostridium perfringens type A, and
   Pasteurellaspp. were the main causes of death observed in the present
   study. The results reported in the present study could provide a
   reference basis to better investigate sudden death in veterinary
   clinical practice. In human medicine, ``sudden death{''} has been
   defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a non-violent,
   unexpected death occurring less than 24 h from the onset of symptoms.
   The aims of this study were: (1) to estimate the proportional mortality
   ratio for ``sudden and unexpected death{''} (SUD) in young dogs; (2) to
   investigate the pathological and microbiological findings in SUD cases
   in young dogs. For these purposes, a retrospective study of a total of
   145 cases of young dead dogs was performed. For each case, we collected
   information about the age, medical history and the gross and
   microbiological findings of the animals. The results of this study found
   21 cases of SUD. The most frequently observed clinical symptoms in the
   cases of sudden death were acute respiratory symptoms, followed by acute
   gastroenteric symptoms, non-specific symptoms and neurological symptoms.
   The evaluation of necropsy reports allowed us to observe enteritis in 18
   out of 21 cases and pneumonia in seven out of 21 cases. Viral infection
   withCanine parvovirus type 2was the most common cause of SUD observed.
   These results could provide a valuable tool for the investigation of
   sudden death in young dogs.},

Title = {Local and Transboundary Transmissions of Methicillin-Resistant
   Staphylococcus aureus Sequence Type 398 through Pig Trading},
Journal = {APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {86},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
   sequence type (ST) 398 (LA-MRSA ST398) is a genetic lineage for which
   pigs are regarded as the main reservoir. An increasing prevalence of
   LA-MRSA ST398 has been reported in areas with high livestock density
   throughout Europe. In this study, we investigated the drivers
   contributing to the introduction and spread of LA-MRSA ST398 through the
   pig farming system in southern Italy. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of
   LA-MRSA ST398 isolates collected in 2018 from pigs (n = 53) and
   employees (n = 14) from 10 farms in the Calabria region of Italy were
   comparatively analyzed with previously published WGS data from Italian
   ST398 isolates (n = 45), an international ST398 reference collection (n
   = 89), and isolates from Danish pig farms (n = 283), which are the main
   suppliers of pigs imported to Italy. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms
   (SNP) were used to infer isolate relatedness, and these data were used
   together with data from animal trading to identify factors contributing
   to LA-MRSA ST398 dissemination. The analyses support the existence of
   two concurrent pathways for the spread of LA-MRSA ST398 in southern
   Italy: (i) multiple introductions of LA-MRSA ST398 through the import of
   colonized pigs from other European countries, including Denmark and
   France, and (ii) the spread of distinct clones dependent on local
   trading of pigs between farms. Phylogenetically related Italian and
   Danish LA-MRSA ST398 isolates shared extensive similarities, including
   carriage of antimicrobial resistance genes. Our findings highlight the
   potential risk of transboundary transmission of antimicrobial-resistant
   bacterial clones with a high zoonotic potential during import of pigs
   from countries with high LA-MRSA prevalence.
   IMPORTANCE Over the past decade, livestock-associated
   methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus sequence type 398 (LA-MRSA
   ST398) has spread among pig holdings throughout Europe, in parallel with
   the increased incidence of infections among humans, especially in
   intensive pig farming regions. Despite the growing prevalence of LA-MRSA
   ST398 in Italian pig farms, the transmission dynamics of this clone in
   Italy remains unclear. This work provides genome-based evidence to
   suggest transboundary LA-MRSA ST398 transmission through trading of
   colonized pigs between Euro- pean countries and Italy, as well as
   between farms in the same Italian region. Our findings show that both
   international trading and local trading of colonized pigs are important
   factors contributing to the global spread of LA-MRSA ST398 and
   underscore the need for control measures on and off the farm to reduce
   the dissemination of this zoonotic pathogen.},

Abstract = {Organophosphates are a large class of chemicals with anticholinesterase
   action insecticides. Dimethoate belongs to the class of organophosphates
   and it is used for agriculture purpose. Its main toxicological role in
   animals and humans is the inhibition of the activity of
   acetylcholinesterase. Although it is not considered genotoxic,
   carcinogenic and teratogen, there is evidence of increased pup mortality
   in developmental neurotoxicity studies. Since there is scant published
   literature about developmental toxicity, we investigated the adverse
   effects of dimethoate on fertilization and embryonic development in sea
   urchin (Paracentrotus lividus), a model organism widely used to assess
   the toxicity of contaminants on environmental matrices; so pesticide
   residues can be released into the environment, and could affect the
   health of organisms, including humans. Different solution of dimethoate
   (4 x 10(-3), 4 x 10(-4), 4 x 10(-5), 4 x 10(-6) and 4 x 10(-7) g/10 ml)
   have been tested on spermatozoa of P. lividus to evaluate the
   fertilizing ability of them when we added egg cells untreated. We
   demonstrated that dimethoate does not interfere with fertilizing ability
   of spermatozoa but egg cells fertilized by treated spermatozoa showed
   alterations in the segmentation planes as asymmetric and/or asynchronous
   cell divisions.},

Title = {Differential Bioaccumulation of Trace Elements and Rare Earth Elements

Abstract = {The Indo-Pacific lionfish is a saltwater fish that inhabits the Red Sea
   waters and the Indian and Pacific oceans; it is an invasive species in
   the western Atlantic and was recently introduced into the local diet in
   the USA, Central and South America, and the Caribbean with the aim of
   controlling the invasion of this species. Due to its predatory nature,
   it tends to bioaccumulate metals and other contaminants via the marine
   food web and could thus constitute a suitable species for monitoring
   aquatic ecosystems. The presence and distribution of 23 trace elements
   and 16 rare earth elements (REEs) were investigated by inductively
   coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in the muscle, liver, and
   kidneys of lionfish from Cuba. Significant differences in metal
   concentrations were found in the different fish organs. The liver and
   kidneys registered the highest concentrations for most trace elements
   and for sigma REE, thus demonstrating that they are effective
   bioindicators of possible pollution on the environment in which fish
   live, and assuming great importance in the choice of early
   biomonitoring. Trace element concentrations in the muscle are instead of
   crucial interest for consumer safety. The limits set by EU regulations
   and Cuban guidelines for Cd and Pb in fish muscle were never exceeded,
   suggesting that lionfish from Cuba could therefore represent a good
   source of minerals and proteins for the local population.

   Pestivirus Closely Related to Classical Swine Fever Virus},
Journal = {VIRUSES-BASEL},

Abstract = {This study shows the origin and the pathogenic role of a novel ovine
   pestivirus (OVPV) isolated in 2017 in Italy, as a pathogenic agent
   causing severe abortions after infection in pregnant ewes and high
   capacity for virus trans-placental transmission as well as the birth of
   lambs suffering OVPV-persistent infection. The OVPV infection induced
   early antibody response detected by the specific ELISA against classical
   swine fever virus (CSFV), another important virus affecting swine. The
   neutralizing antibody response were similar against CSFV strains from
   genotype 2 and the OVPV. These viruses showed high identity in the B/C
   domain of the E2-glycoprotein. Close molecular diagnostics
   cross-reactivity between CSFV and OVPV was found and a new OVPV
   molecular assay was developed. The phylodynamic analysis showed that
   CSFV seems to have emerged as the result of an inter-species jump of
   Tunisian sheep virus (TSV) from sheep to pigs. The OVPV and the CSFV
   share the TSV as a common ancestor, emerging around 300 years ago. This
   suggests that the differentiation of TSV into two dangerous new viruses
   for animal health (CSFV and OVPV) was likely favored by human
   intervention for the close housing of multiple species for intensive
   livestock production.},

Title = {NAuRA: Genomic Tool to Identify Staphylococcal Enterotoxins in
   Staphylococcus aureus Strains Responsible for FoodBorne Outbreaks},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUN 30},
Abstract = {Food contamination by staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) is responsible
   for many food poisoning outbreaks (FPOs) each year, and they represent
   the third leading cause of FPOs in Europe. SEs constitute a protein
   family with 27 proteins. However, enzyme immunoassays can only detect
   directly in food the five classical SEs (SEA-SEE). Thus, molecular
   characterization methods of strains found in food are now used for FPO
   investigations. Here, we describe the development and implementation of
   a genomic analysis tool called NAuRA (Nice automatic Research of
   alleles) that can detect the presence of 27 SEs genes in just one
   analysis- and create a database of allelic data and protein variants for
   harmonizing analyses. This tool uses genome assembly data and the 27
   protein sequences of SEs. To include the different divergence levels
   between SE-coding genes, parameters of coverage and identity were
   generated from 10,000 simulations and a dataset of 244 assembled genomes
   from strains responsible for outbreaks in Europe as well as the RefSeq
   reference database. Based on phylogenetic inference performed using
   maximum-likelihood on the core genomes of the strains in this
   collection, we demonstrated that strains responsible for FPOs are
   distributed throughout the phylogenetic tree. Moreover, 71 toxin
   profiles were obtained using the NAuRA pipeline and these profiles do
   not follow the evolutionary history of strains. This study presents a
   pioneering method to investigate strains isolated from food at the
   genomic level and to analyze the diversity of all 27 SE-coding genes
   together.},

Abstract = {This study describes the development and validation of a simplified
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection and
   discrimination of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) serotypes O, A, C
   and Asia 1. The multiplex ELISA was designed using selected,
   type-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) coated onto ELISA plates as
   catching antibodies and a unique pan-FMDV MAb (1F10) as detector
   conjugate. Capture MAbs with the broadest intratypic reactivity were
   selected for each of the four FMDV serotypes by screening large panels
   of candidate MAbs with a wide spectrum of representative FMDV isolates.
   An additional pan-FMDV ELISA using 1F10 MAb for both capture and
   detection was used to complement the specific typing ELISAs to detect
   virus isolates, which might escape binding to the selected
   serotype-specific MAbs. This multiplex ELISA was prepared in a
   stabilized format, with immunoplates pre-coated with six MAbs and
   positive antigen controls already trapped by the relevant MAb, with the
   view to make available a diagnostic kit. Diagnostic performance of the
   MAbs-multiplex ELISA was analysed using 299 FMDV-positive epithelial
   suspensions representative of the antigenic and genomic variability
   within each serotype. Overall, the results provided evidence that the
   diagnostic performance of this assay platform is improved compared to
   the more complex polyclonal-based antigen detection ELISA; combining
   data from different serotypes and referring to the gold standard tests
   (i.e. virus isolation and/or RT-PCR), the MAbs-multiplex ELISA showed a
   sensitivity of 79\% for the serotype-specific ELISA, compared to 72\%
   for the polyclonal ELISA. The absence of reactivity of a minority of
   FMDV strains using the MAbs-multiplex ELISA can largely be attributed to
   deteriorated or low antigen concentration in the sample. This multiplex
   ELISA is simple, rapid and stable. FMDV antigenic diversity was
   adequately covered by the selected MAbs. Therefore, it can be used to
   replace existing polyclonal ELISAs for FMDV detection and serotyping.},

Abstract = {Canine leishmaniosis (CanL) is a disease caused by the protistLeishmania
   infantumand transmitted to dogs by sand fly (Diptera: Phlebotominae)
   bites. In 2005, a new autochthonous focus of CanL was recognised in the
   southern part of Euganei hills (northeastern Italy). In subsequent
   years, this outbreak was monitored, testing dogs and evaluating sand fly
   population. Moreover, dog owners were sensitized on the adoption of
   preventive measures, thanks to the collaboration of local
   administration, health authorities, and private veterinarians. This
   study includes serological tests on dogs, questionnaires submitted to
   dog owners regarding the use of preventive measures on their animals,
   and the evaluation of sand fly abundance. Data collected were
   statistically compared with those of previous years. The canine
   seroprevalence was significantly lower than that recorded at the
   beginning of the outbreak, despite the fact that sand fly abundance did
   not significantly decrease. In addition, most of the dog owners declared
   using regularly the topical insecticides on their dogs during the sand
   fly season. This experience demonstrated that a collaborative approach
   among scientific researchers, local authorities, and private
   veterinarians can achieve excellent results in the management of a
   leishmaniosis outbreak.},

Abstract = {The adverse effects of endocrine disruptors (EDs) on aquatic wildlife
   and human health represent a current issue of high public concern.
   Substantial knowledge of the level of estrogenic EDs in fish has
   accumulated from field surveys. For this purpose, a survey of wild brown
   trout (Salmo trutta trutta) was carried out to assess the incidence of
   EDs in the feral fish population living in the Liri river (Abruzzi,
   Italy). The results of this study show that this aquatic environment
   possesses an estrogenic potency that triggered the increase of
   vitellogenin levels in both female and male trouts. Fish exposed to
   different pesticides and urban waste in downstream river showed higher
   vitellogenin levels in comparison to the headwater site. Furthermore,
   some trouts coming from the downstream reported the presence of several
   pesticides and fungicides, some of these banned several years ago.},

Abstract = {Viruses similar to human hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the Hepacivirus
   genus have been identified in several animal hosts, including cattle.
   Since its first discovery in Germany, bovine hepacivirus (BovHepV) has
   been described in several countries globally. However, limited data are
   available on BovHepV epidemiology and genetic variability. The aim of
   this study was to investigate the prevalence and genetic diversity of
   BovHepV in Italy. Viral RNA was identified in 37 (0.15\%) of 24,820
   bovine sera, with titres ranging from 1.09 x 10(3)to 8.27 x 10(6)RNA
   copies/ml. Upon sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the 5 ` UTR and
   NS3 genomic portions, the Italian BovHepV strains segregated into at
   least four distinct subtypes (A, B, C and F) that are also
   co-circulating globally.},

Title = {Salmo salar fish waste oil: Fatty acids composition and antibacterial
   activity},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 19},
Abstract = {Background and aims. Fish by-products are generally used to produce
   fishmeal or fertilizers, with fish oil as a by-product. Despite their
   importance, fish wastes are still poorly explored and characterized and
   more studies are needed to reveal their potentiality. The goal of the
   present study was to qualitatively characterize and investigate the
   antimicrobial effects of the fish oil extracted from Salmo salar waste
   samples and to evaluate the potential use of these compounds for
   treating pathogen infections.
   Methods. Salmo salar waste samples were divided in two groups: heads and
   soft tissues. Fatty acids composition, and in particular the content in
   saturated (SAFAs), monounsaturated (MUFAs) and Polyunsaturated (PUFAs)
   fatty acids, was characterized through GC/MS Thermo Focus GC-DSQ II
   equipped with a ZB-5 fused silica capillary tubes column. The
   antimicrobial activity of the salmon waste oils was evaluated through
   the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration assay and the antibiotics
   contamination was determined by Liquid Chromatography with tandem Mass
   Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. All experiments were done at least in
   triplicate.
   Results. GC/MS analysis has shown the specific fatty acid composition of
   the salmon waste oils and their enrichment in MUFAs and PUFAs, with
   special reference to omega-3, -6, -7, -9 fatty acids. Furthermore, our
   study has highlighted the antimicrobial activity of the fish waste oil
   samples against two Gram+ and Gram- bacterial strains.
   Conclusions. These data confirm that the fish waste is still
   quantitatively and qualitatively an important source of available
   biological properties that could be extracted and utilized representing
   an important strategy to counteract infective diseases in the context of
   the circular economy.},

Abstract = {Since 2007, the Autonomous Province of Bolzano-South Tyrol (Italy) has
   carried out a compulsory eradication program against caprine arthritis
   encephalitis virus (CAEV) in goats. A drastic seroprevalence reduction
   was achieved during the initial phase (2007-2011); however, a tailing
   phenomenon has been observed during the latest years, hampering the
   achievement of the final goal. CAEV belongs to a group of lentiviruses,
   called small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs), which are antigenically
   related and can infect both goats and sheep. We investigated the
   possible link between the tailing phenomenon in goats and the role of
   sheep as a virus reservoir by comparing serologic results between
   multispecies farms (where goats and sheep coexist) and monospecies farms
   (goats only). Goats on multispecies farms had a higher prevalence and
   seroconversion rate (even if to a rather moderate extent), higher
   antibody titers, and a higher probability of conclusive results in the
   genotyping analysis, with more frequent identification of SRLV genotype
   A (sheep-related) infections. Sheep can serve as a SRLV reservoir, thus
   contributing to scattered positive tests in goats, causing the tailing
   phenomenon.},

Abstract = {In the summer of 2017, several European Union Member States were
   involved in a food alert caused by the presence of fipronil pesticide
   residues in chicken eggs. The food alert became a major news and
   received wide coverage both in the mass media and on the Internet. This
   article describes a study that analyzed how the Italian online
   information sources represented the fipronil alert, using web monitoring
   techniques and both manual and automatic content analysis methods. The
   results indicate that the alert was amplified because general news media
   could represent the alert within the frame of a political scandal, and
   because different social actors exploited the case. However, online
   information sources correctly communicated that the risks for consumers
   were low, reporting mainly what was officially communicated by the
   Italian health authorities. The study provides empirical evidence on how
   the online information sources represent food risks and food alerts and
   offers useful indications for health authorities in charge of the public
   communication of food risks.},

Title = {Early Prediction of Corpus Luteum Functionality Using an Imaging
   Software},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUN 18},
Abstract = {The present study aimed to assess the applicability of luteal blood flow
   data acquired through the use of color Doppler ultrasonography and a
   post-processing analysis tool (ImageJ) for predicting pregnancy in
   buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis). The experiment was carried out on 59
   multiparous Italian Mediterranean buffaloes that underwent
   synchronization of estrus and fixed-time artificial insemination (TAI).
   Corpus luteum features (size: CLS and blood flow: BFA) were taken from
   Day 5 to 10 after TAI and retrospectively measured with ImageJ. In the
   same period, blood samples were taken to assess progesterone (P-4)
   concentrations. Pregnancy diagnosis was carried out on Day 45 by
   ultrasound and confirmed on Day 70 post-TAI. Differences in CLS, BFA,
   and P(4)concentrations from Day 5 to 10 after TAI measured between
   groups were analyzed by ANOVA repeated measures as were differences
   within each day of measuring. Buffaloes that established a pregnancy (n=
   29; 55\%) had larger CLS (2.2 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.9 +/- 0.1 cm(2);P< 0.01),
   higher BFA (0.6 +/- 0.0 vs. 0.4 +/- 0.0 cm(2);P< 0.01), and higher
   P(4)blood level (1.8 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.4 +/- 0.1;P< 0.01) during Day 5-10 as
   compared to not-pregnant buffaloes (n= 22). Throughout the entire
   period, the first feature that changed between groups was P(4)blood
   concentration at Day 7 (1.7 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.1;P< 0.05) followed by
   BFA at Day 8 (0.6 +/- 0.0 vs. 0.5 +/- 0.0;P< 0.05), respectively, in
   pregnant and not-pregnant animals. The ROC analyses indicated that
   P(4)was able to predict pregnancy since Day 5 (P< 0.05) although a more
   reliable result could be obtained from Day 8 (P< 0.01). At Day 10, it
   was possible to set a cutoff value for every parameter taken into
   account. The logistic regression analysis showed that pregnancy was
   positively influenced by P(4)concentration (odds ratio 534.127;P< 0.01)
   and BFA (odds ratio 744.893;P< 0.01). In conclusion, the use of color
   Doppler ultrasonography, together with ImageJ, identified different
   patterns of BFA between pregnant and not-pregnant buffaloes starting
   from Day 8 post-TAI.},

Title = {Iron Ion-Doped Tricalcium Phosphate Coatings Improve the Properties of
   Biodegradable Magnesium Alloys for Biomedical Implant Application},
Journal = {ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES},
Year = {2020},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Iron-substituted tricalcium phosphate (Fe-TCP) (about 1 wt\%) coatings
   are deposited on biodegradable Mg-Ca alloys to improve their corrosion
   resistance. Pulsed laser deposition technique is used for coating
   preparation. The 2 mu m thick coatings are uniformly deposited.
   (Ca+Fe)/P ratio for the Fe-TCP coatings is close to the stoichiometric
   value. Coated and uncoated Mg-Ca alloys are subjected to electrochemical
   tests to investigate the influence of the coatings on their corrosion
   resistance in simulated body fluid (SBF). Tafel curves corresponding to
   coated and uncoated Mg-Ca alloy samples in SBF show that the most
   electropositive corrosion potential is reached for the Fe-TCP-coated
   Mg-Ca deposited at 300 degrees C. From the obtained and calculated
   values of the electrochemical parameters it follows that this sample
   possesses the best characteristics: it has the smallest porosity and the
   highest protective efficiency in SBF. Equine adipose tissue-derived
   mesenchymal stem cells are used for
   3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide test and
   osteogenic differentiation study. Microbiology tests are performed
   withEscherichia coli (E. coli)(Gram(-)) andStaphylococcus
   aureus(Gram(+)) bacteria strains. The Fe-TCP-coated Mg-Ca deposited at
   300 degrees C is characterized by the best cytocompatibility and good
   ability to inhibit the growth ofE. coliand is recommended for biomedical
   implant applications.},

Abstract = {Avian coronaviruses, including infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and
   turkey coronavirus (TCoV), are economically important viruses affecting
   poultry worldwide. IBV is responsible for causing severe losses to the
   commercial poultry sector globally. The objectives of this study were to
   identify the viruses that were causing outbreaks of severe respiratory
   disease in chickens in Trinidad and Tobago (T\&T) and to characterize
   the strains. Swab samples were collected from birds showing severe
   respiratory signs in five farms on the island of Trinidad. Samples were
   tested for the presence of IBV, as well as avian influenza virus (AIV),
   Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) by
   real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). All
   samples from the five farms tested negative for AIV, NDV and aMPV;
   however, samples from clinically affected birds in all five of the farms
   tested positive for IBV. Genetic data revealed the presence of TCoV in
   chickens on two of the farms. Interestingly, these two farms had never
   reared turkeys. Phylogenetic analysis showed that IBV S1 sequences
   formed two distinct clusters. Two sequences grouped with vaccine strains
   within the GI-1 lineage, whereas three sequences grouped together, but
   separately from other defined lineages, forming a likely new lineage of
   IBV. Pairwise comparison revealed that the three unique variant strains
   within the distinct lineage of IBV were significantly different in their
   S1 nucleotide coding regions from viruses in the closest lineage (16\%
   difference) and locally used vaccine strains (>20\% difference). Results
   also suggested that one of the samples was a recombinant virus,
   generated from a recombination event between a Trinidad virus of the
   GI-1 lineage and a Trinidad virus of the newly defined lineage. Many
   amino acid differences were also observed between the S1 coding regions
   of the circulating field and vaccine strains, indicating that the IBV
   vaccines may not be protective. Vaccine-challenge studies are however
   needed to prove this.},

Title = {Surgical implantation of electronic tags does not induce medium-term
   effect: insights from growth and stress physiological profile in two
   marine fish species},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {BackgroundTelemetry applied to aquatic organisms has recently developed
   greatly. Physiological sensors have been increasingly used as tools for
   fish welfare monitoring. However, for the technology to be used as a
   reliable welfare indicator, it is important that the tagging procedure
   does not disrupt fish physiology, behaviour and performance. In this
   communication, we share our medium-term data on stress physiological
   profile and growth performance after surgical tag implantation in two
   important marine fish species for European aquaculture, the sea bream
   (Sparus aurata) and the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus
   labrax).ResultsBlood samples after surgical tag implantation (46 days
   for the sea bream and 95 days for the sea bass) revealed no differences
   between tagged and untagged fish in cortisol, glucose and lactate
   levels, suggesting that the tag implantation does not induce prolonged
   stress in these species. Moreover, the specific growth rates were
   similar in the tagged and untagged fish of both
   species.ConclusionSurgical tag implantation does not have medium-term
   consequences for the stress physiology and growth performance of these
   two marine fish species in a controlled environment. These observations
   support the use of accelerometer tags as valuable tools for welfare
   monitoring in aquaculture conditions. This study also shows that tagged
   fish can be sampled during experiments and considered a representative
   portion of the population, as they display growth and physiological
   parameters comparable to those of untagged fish.},

Abstract = {Background Mastitis is one of the most costly diseases in Mediterranean
   buffalo (MB). At present, just a few specific antibiotics registered for
   this dairy specie have been synthetized. Efficacy of an antibiotic dry
   buffalo therapy (aDBT) againstStaphylococcus aureus(S. aureus) mastitis,
   based on intra-quarter administration of 600 mg of benzathine
   cloxacillin, have been evaluated for the first time. Eighty MB's
   quarters received a drying-off therapy (aDBT-group) and 80 were left
   untreated (no-aDBT-group). They were sampled at drying-off
   (pre-treatment) and at the resumption of milking {[}< 10 days in milk
   (DIM)].Fresh calver mastitis rate,dry period new mastitis rate,dry
   period cure rate, andpersistent mastitis ratewere calculated for
   clinical monitoring. Overall proportion of positive quarters/animals,
   quarters affected by mastitis or intramammary infections (IMI), effects
   on somatic cell count (SCC) and milk yield were also assessed. Results
   An inter-group difference (aDBT vs. no-aDBT) was recorded for all the
   indexes considered. An intra-group (drying-off vs. < 10 DIM) difference
   was detected in aDBT-group regarding the proportion of positive-cultured
   quarters and animals. Concerning the latter, an inter-groups difference
   was also recorded at second sampling. No clinical mastitis due to theS.
   aureuswas observed. Regarding the subclinical ones, a higher intra-group
   difference was observed in aDBT than no-aDBT group, while an inter-group
   difference was recorded at second sampling. No protective effect was
   observed against IMI. SCC showed an inter-group difference at second
   sampling, while none difference was instead detected for milk yield.
   Conclusions The effects againstS. aureusmastitis of benzathine
   cloxacillin administration at drying-off were assessed for the first
   time in MB. Its use shows encouraging results in reducing the proportion
   of mastitis and positive animals at the resumption of the lactation.},

Title = {Campylobacter bacteriophage DA10: an excised temperate bacteriophage
   targeted by CRISPR-cas},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 12},
Abstract = {Background Lytic bacteriophages that infectCampylobacterspp. have been
   utilized to develop therapeutic/decontamination techniques. However, the
   association ofCampylobacterspp. and bacteriophages has been the focus of
   several strands of research aimed at understanding the complex
   relationships that have developed between predators and prey over
   evolutionary time. The activities of endogenous temperate bacteriophages
   have been used to evaluate genomic rearrangements and differential
   protein expression in host cells, and mechanisms of resistance to
   bacteriophage infection in campylobacters such as phase variation and
   CRISPR-mediated immunity. Results Temperate bacteriophage DA10
   represents a novel excised and infective virus capable of replication in
   a restricted set ofC. jejuniandC. colihosts. Whole genome sequencing
   reveals that DA10 (35,379 bp) forms part of a novel group of temperate
   bacteriophages that have limited distribution among database host genome
   sequences. Analysis of potential host genomes reveals a robust response
   against DA10 and DA10-like bacteriophages is driven by CRISPR-mediated
   immunity with 75\% of DA10 ORFs represented as similar to 30 bp spacer
   sequences in numerousCampylobacterType II-C CRISPR arrays. Several
   DA10-like homologues have been identified in a small sub-set ofC.
   jejuniandC. coligenome sequences (ranging from near complete integrated
   prophage sequences to fragments recognisable in the sequence read
   archive). Conclusions A complete intact DA10-like prophage inC.
   jejuniCJ677CC520 provides evidence that the associations between host
   and DA10-like bacteriophages are long-standing in evolutionary
   timescales. Extensive nucleotide substitution and loss can be observed
   in the integrated DA10-like prophage of CJ677CC520 compared to other
   relatives as observed through pairwise genome comparisons. Examining
   factors that have limited the population expansion of the prophage,
   while others appear to have thrived and prospered (Mu-like, CJIE-like,
   and lyticCampylobacterbacteriophages) will assist in identifying the
   underlying evolutionary processes in the natural environment.},

Title = {African Swine Fever: Lessons to Learn From Past Eradication Experiences.
   A Systematic Review},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUN 9},
Abstract = {Prevention, early detection, prompt reaction, and communication play a
   crucial role in African swine fever (ASF) control. Appropriate
   surveillance capable of early detection of the disease in both domestic
   and wild animals, and the implementation of consolidated contingency
   plans, are currently considered the best means of controlling this
   disease. The purpose of this study was to understand the lessons to be
   learned through the global disease eradication history. To establish
   which strategies were successful for prevention, control, and
   eradication of ASF, and which errors should not be repeated, we
   conducted a systematic review. A query was defined to search for
   surveillance and control strategies applied by countries worldwide for
   ASF eradication in the past. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were
   defined. Decisions on study eligibility and data extraction were
   performed by two independent reviewers and the differences were resolved
   by consensus or by a third reviewer. From 1,980 papers, 23 were selected
   and included in the qualitative analysis. Reports from Belgium, Brazil,
   Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Haiti, France, mainland Italy, Malta,
   Portugal, and Spain were included. Despite the economic resources
   allocated and the efforts made, eradication was possible in only eight
   countries, between the 50s and 90s in the twentieth century, in
   different epidemiological and cultural contexts, in some instances
   within <1 year, and in others in about 40 years. Classical surveillance
   strategies, such as active and passive surveillance, both at farm and
   slaughterhouse levels, targeted surveillance, together with conventional
   biosafety and sanitary measures, led to eradication even in countries in
   which the tick's epidemiological role was demonstrated. Historical
   surveillance data analysis indicated that eradication was possible even
   when technological tools either were not available or were used less
   than they are currently. This emphasizes that data on surveillance and
   on animal population are crucial for planning effective surveillance,
   and targeting proper control and intervention strategies. This paper
   demonstrates that some strategies applied in the past were effective;
   these could be implemented and improved to confront the current
   epidemiological wave. This offers encouragement for the efforts made
   particularly in Europe during the recent epidemics.},

Abstract = {Noroviruses (NoVs) are one of the major causative agents of
   non-bacterial gastroenteritis in humans worldwide. NoVs, belonging to
   Caliciviridae, are classified into ten genogroups (G) and eight P-groups
   based on major capsid protein (VP1) and of the
   RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp), respectively. In swine, the main
   genogroup and P-group identified are GII and GII.P; which can infect
   humans too. To date, only one case of GIIP.11 have been identified in
   swine in Italy while the circulation of other P-types is currently
   unknown. In the present study, 225 swine faecal samples were collected
   from 74 swine herds in Veneto region through on-farm monitoring. NoV
   circulation was particularly high in older pigs. The phylogenetic
   analysis showed the co-circulation of NoVs belonging to two different
   P-types: GII.P11 and GII.P18, here described for the first time in
   Italy, presenting an extensive genetic diversity, never described before
   worldwide. Distinct NoV genetic subgroups and unique amino acid
   mutations were identified for each P-type for the first time. This study
   demonstrated the co-circulation of diverse swine NoVs subgroups in
   Italy, raising questions on the origin of such diversity and suggesting
   that continuous monitoring of swine NoVs is needed to track the
   emergence of potentially zoonotic viruses by recombination events.},

Abstract = {We assessed the causes of polyserositis in pigs, categorized by
   causative agents and ages of animals affected. In a 3-y study, 246 pigs
   from 80 different farms with recurrent problems of polyserositis, in a
   high-density breeding area, were submitted for autopsy; 154 pigs with
   typical fibrinous serosal lesions were sampled for further bacterial and
   viral investigation. The most common gross lesions were pleuritis and
   pericarditis (141 of 154; 92\%). The animals most affected were weaned
   pigs (139 of 154; 90\%). Haemophilus parasuis and Mycoplasma hyorhinis
   were the most common bacteria detected and were present at the same rate
   (85 of 154; 55\%). Other bacteria isolated were Streptococcus sp. (44 of
   154; 29\%), Pasteurella multocida (21 of 154; 14\%), Escherichia coli
   (19 of 154; 12\%), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (7 of 154; 5\%), and
   Trueperella pyogenes (4 of 154; 3\%). Porcine reproductive and
   respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV; 119 of 154; 77\%) predominated among
   the viruses detected, followed, with lesser prevalence, by porcine
   circovirus 2 (40 of 154; 26\%) and swine influenza A virus (19 of 154;
   12\%). Bacterial coinfection and coinfection of bacteria and viruses
   were common (128 of 154; 83\%). A strong positive correlation was found
   between coinfection by H. parasuis and M. hyorhinis and also by H.
   parasuis with PRRSV.},

Title = {Detection of Bovine Antibodies against a Conserved Capsid Epitope as the
   Basis of a Novel Universal Serological Test for Foot-and-Mouth Disease},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {58},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Diagnostic tests for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) include the detection
   of antibodies against either the viral nonstructural proteins or the
   capsid. The detection of antibodies against the structural proteins (SP)
   of the capsid can be used to monitor seroconversion in both infected and
   vaccinated animals. However, SP tests need to be tailored to the
   individual FMD virus (FMDV) serotype and their sensitivity may be
   affected by antigenic variability within each serotype and mismatching
   between test reagents. As a consequence, FMD reference laboratories are
   required to maintain multiple type-specific SP assays and reagents. A
   universal SP test would simplify frontline diagnostics and facilitate
   large-scale serological surveillance and postvaccination monitoring. In
   this study, a highly conserved region in the N terminus of FMDV capsid
   protein VP2 (VP2N) was characterized using a panel of intertype-reactive
   monoclonal antibodies. This revealed a universal epitope in VP2N which
   could be used as a peptide antigen to detect FMDV-specific antibodies
   against all types of the virus. A VP2-peptide enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (VP2-ELISA) was optimized using experimental and
   reference antisera from immunized, convalescent, and naive animals (n =
   172). The VP2-ELISA is universal and simple and provided sensitive
   (99\%) and specific (93\%) detection of antibodies to all FMDV strains
   used in this study. We anticipate that this SP test could have utility
   for serosurveillance during virus incursions in FMD-free countries and
   as an additional screening tool to assess FMD virus circulation in
   countries where the disease is endemic.},

Abstract = {Leptospirosis in dogs has been largely described worldwide, and
   epidemiological studies have been mainly based on serological data. This
   study aims to detect and genotype leptospires affecting symptomatic dogs
   in Northeast Italy between 2013 and 2019. Overall, 1631 dogs were tested
   using real-time PCR, and leptospires from 193 dogs were subjected to
   Multilocus Sequence Typing and a Multiple Loci Variable-number Tandem
   Repeat Analysis. Leptospires were successfully isolated from 15
   symptomatic dogs. Six distinct Sequence Types (STs) were found for 135
   leptospires, with 3 STs characterizingLeptospira interrogans(ST17, ST198
   and ST24), 2 STs characterizingLeptospira kirschneri(ST117 and ST289)
   and 1 ST characterizingLeptospira borgpetersenii(ST155), revealing the
   circulation of the serogroups Icterohaemorrhagiae, Australis, Sejroe and
   Pomona. The Multiple Loci Variable-number Tandem Repeat Analysis of 17
   samples did not result in any additional discrimination. Genotypes were
   compared with those of strains present in the historical internal
   database, and possible transmission chains were identified from rat,
   mouse, hedgehog and pig. This work highlights the importance of
   molecular methods in revealing and identifying
   circulatingLeptospirastrains, and it also encourages the evaluation of
   the ability of commercially available vaccines to reduce the disease
   burden among dogs.},

Title = {Update on the aflatoxin M1 contamination trend in Lombardy Region},

Abstract = {The contamination of milk by aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) depends on the presence
   of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in animal feed, especially corn. The surveillance
   of AFM1 levels in bulk milk is an indirect but rapid and efficient
   indicator of the possible contamination of feed. The 2016 was a critical
   year for that concern the contamination of cereals by AFB1 leading to
   the implementation of a special control plan and an increase of own
   checks plans. In this contest, a summary overview of the situation of
   the years following 2016, in particular the period from 2017 to first
   six months of 2019, seems to be required. Approximately 20,000 milk
   samples (official samples taken in the scope of the extraordinary
   regional control plan and samples conferred to our laboratories by
   farmers and milk enterprises in self-control plans applications) were
   analyzed by an ELISA quantitative method. Comparing the data obtained in
   different years, the trend obtained shows that, after the critical years
   2012 and 2015, during the evaluated period (2017-2019) the levels of
   AFM1 in milk remained almost unchanged and well below the legal limit of
   0.050 mu g/kg. Furthermore, the samples analyzed were split into two
   categories according to type (official samples and samples collected
   from the own checks plans) and for each group the corresponding
   non-compliance was assessed. The results obtained confirmed the
   importance to carry out monitoring and control systems, continuous and
   repeated during the time, with the aim to assess the contamination of
   milk by aflatoxins. Only in this way is it possible to detect a general
   or limited to some areas increase of the cereal contamination. Working
   on this base, it is possible to coordinate official control programs, as
   preventive as emergency action plans, in relation to the risk assessed.},

Abstract = {A two-patches metapopulation mathematical model, describing the dynamics
   of Susceptibles and Infected in wildlife diseases, is presented. The two
   patches are identical in absence of control, and culling activities are
   performed in only one of them. Firstly, the dynamics of the system in
   absence of control is investigated. Then, two types of localized culling
   strategies (proactive end reactive) are considered. The proactive
   control is modeled by a constant culling effort, and for the ensuing
   model the disease free equilibrium is characterized and existence of the
   endemic equilibrium is discussed in terms of a suitable control
   reproduction number. The localized reactive control is modeled by a
   piecewise constant culling effort function, that introduces an
   extra-mortality when the number of infected individuals in the patch
   overcomes a given threshold. The reactive control is then analytically
   and numerically investigated in the frame of Filippov systems.
   We find that localized culling may be ineffective in controlling
   diseases in wild populations when the infection affects host fecundity
   in addition to host mortality, even leading to unexpected increases in
   the number of infected individuals in the nearby areas.},

   factors and the economic outcomes of infections in both animals and
   humans. The results, visualized in flow charts indicating the types of
   costs associated with these zoonoses, will guide data collection and the
   epidemiologic and economic assessment in the next research stages. This

Journal = {COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES},

Abstract = {This study aimed to provide mechanistic insights into mitophagy pathway
   associated with papillomavirus infection in urothelial cells of cattle.
   The elimination of mitochondria via autophagy, termed mitophagy, is an
   evolutionarily conserved mechanism for mitochondrial quality control and
   homeostasis. PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy, a ubiquitin-dependent
   selective autophagy of dysfunctional mitochondria, has been described
   here, for the first time, in urothelial cells from 25 bladder cancers in
   cattle infected by bovine papillomavirus (BPV). The expression of BPV-2
   and BPV-13 E5 oncoprotein was detected by RT-PCR. Abnormal mitochondria
   delimited by expanding phagophores, were peculiar ultrastructural
   features of neoplastic urothelial cells. High levels of mitochondrial
   phosphorylated PINK1/parkin were observed in neoplastic urothelial cells
   infected by BPVs. Phosphoparkin interacted with mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) and
   ubiquitin (Ub), which confirmed that Mfn2 is a parkin receptor at the
   mitochondrial level, where parkin interacted also with Ub. Furthermore,
   parkin established a complex that was comprised of optineurin, p62, LC3,
   laforin, and embryonic stem cell-expressed Ras (ERAS), that interacted
   with BPV E5 oncoprotein, and Bag3, which, in turn, regulated the
   formation of a complex composed of Hpc70/Hsp70, CHIP, an
   HSC70-interacting E3 ubiquitin ligase. It is conceivable that ERAS is
   involved in mitophagosome maturation via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
   (PI3K) pathway. Bag3, in association with Hsc70/Hsp70, may contribute to
   the transport and degradation of CHIP-ubiquitinated cargo as this
   complex recognises ubiquitinated cargos and transports them to
   aggresomes to be degraded. Furthermore, Bag3 may be involved in
   mitophagosome formation as it interacted with synaptopodin 2, which is
   known to play a role in mitophagosome biogenesis.},

Abstract = {The Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus monachus) is one of the most
   endangered marine mammals in the world. This species has been threatened
   since ancient times by human activities and currently amounts to
   approximately 700 individuals distributed in the Eastern Mediterranean
   Sea (Aegean and Ionian Sea) and Eastern Atlantic Ocean (Cabo Blanco and
   Madeira). In other areas, where the species is considered ``probably
   extinct{''}, an increase in sporadic sightings has been recorded during
   recent years. Sightings and accidental catches of Mediterranean monk
   seals have become more frequent in the Adriatic Sea, mainly in Croatia
   but also along the coasts of Montenegro, Albania and Southern Italy. A
   Mediterranean monk seal pup was recovered on 27 January 2020 on the
   beach of Torre San Gennaro in Torchiarolo (Brindisi, Apulia, Italy). DNA
   was extracted from a tissue sample and the hypervariable region I (HVR1)
   of the mitochondrial DNA control region was amplified and sequenced. The
   alignment performed with seven previous published haplotypes showed that
   the individual belongs to the haplotype MM03, common in monk seals
   inhabiting the Greek islands of the Ionian Sea. This result indicates
   the Ionian Islands as the most probable geographical origin of the pup,
   highlighting the need to intensify research and conservation activities
   on this species even in areas where it seemed to be extinct.},

Abstract = {Background Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-KP) is an
   urgent public health issue in Italy. This pattern of resistance is due
   mainly to dissemination of carbapenemase genes. Molecular
   characterization of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-KP)
   strains was performed over a three-year period. In-depth analysis was
   performed on a subset of emerging CR-KP ST101 and ST307 clones. Methods
   A prospective study was performed on 691 patients with CR-KP bloodstream
   infections hospitalized in 19 hospitals located in three large provinces
   in Southern Italy. Carbapenemase genes were identified via genotyping
   methods. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and Whole Genome Sequencing
   (WGS) were carried out on ST101 and ST307 isolates. Results Among the
   CR-KP isolates, bla(KPC) was found in 95.6\%, bla(VIM) was found in
   3.5\%, bla(NDM) was found in 0.1\% and bla(OXA-48) was found in 0.1\%.
   The bla(KPC-3) variant was identified in all 104 characterized KPC-KP
   isolates. MLST of 231 representative isolates revealed ST512 in 45.5\%,
   ST101 in 20.3\% and ST307 in 18.2\% of the isolates. cgMLST of ST307 and
   ST101 isolates revealed presence of more than one beta-lactam resistance
   gene. Amino acid substitution in the chromosomal colistin-resistance
   gene pmrB was found in two ST101 isolates. Conclusions ST512 is
   widespread in Southern Italy, but ST101 and ST307 are emerging since
   they were found in a significant proportion of cases. Aggressive
   infection control measures and a continuous monitoring of these
   high-risk clones are necessary to avoid rapid spread of CR-KP,
   especially in hospital settings.},

Abstract = {Given consumer interest in Mozzarella di latte di Bufala and other
   cheeses, and the growing interest of the cheese industry in offering
   products adequate for lactovegetarian consumers, this study aimed to
   compare clotting capacity of vegetal and animal rennet in buffalo milk.
   Milk coagulation properties of 1,261 buffalo bulk milk samples collected
   during milk quality testing were assessed by lactodynamography using
   commercial animal (75\% chymosin and 25\% bovine pepsin) and vegetal
   (Cynara cardunculus) rennets. Chemical composition of milk samples was
   predicted by MilkoScan (Foss Analytics, Hillerod, Denmark) calibrated
   with specific buffalo standards. Rennet effect (animal versus vegetal)
   was statistically analyzed with a paired t-test. Fat, protein, and
   lactose contents of milk samples were 7.94\%, 4.52\%, and 4.80\%,
   respectively. A similar variability of milk coagulation properties was
   observed with both rennets, with the exception of greater variability of
   curd firmness at 30 min after the addition of vegetal rennet compared
   with animal rennet (73 and 26\%, respectively). On average, when using
   plant rennet, milk started to coagulate and reached the 20-mm coagulum
   12 +/- 0.22 min and 1.9 +/- 0.20 min, respectively, later than with
   animal rennet. Thirty minutes after rennet addition, curds were almost
   twice as firm in animal as in vegetal rennet (difference of 23.92 +/-
   0.66 mm). However, curd firmness at 60 min was only 1.21 +/- 0.39 mm
   thicker with vegetal than with animal rennet. Moreover, when using
   animal rennet, 99.52\% of samples started coagulating within the first
   30 min of analysis, whereas only 70.42\% did so when using vegetal
   rennet. We conclude that vegetal rennet has the capacity to coagulate
   buffalo milk, achieving a similar curd firmness to that of animal rennet
   at 60 min. Further studies are needed to evaluate the sensory
   characteristics and consumer acceptability of Mozzarella di latte di
   Bufala processed with vegetal rennet.},

Abstract = {An increasing number of Hepatitis E virus (HEV) cases are currently
   recognized in many European countries. HEV is an emerging disease in
   industrialized countries. HEV is an important cause of human acute viral
   hepatitis worldwide, where the infection is acquired probably through
   ingestion of contaminated food, in addition to travel-related cases. In
   Europe, outbreaks have been reported linked to the consumption of pork
   liver sausages and wild boar meat. It has been shown that wildlife can
   serve as natural reservoirs of HEV. In Europe, especially in region
   where game meat is widely consumed, wild boars (Sus scrofa) are
   considered as the main wildlife reservoir of zoonotic Hepatitis E virus
   genotypes. HEV is classified into eight genotypes. Genotypes 3 and 4 are
   considered zoonotic and are responsible for sporadic cases of food-borne
   disease due to the consumption of contaminated raw or undercooked meat.
   Genotypes 3 mainly circulates in domestic pigs and wild boars, which are
   the main sources of infection for humans. To assess the potential risk
   of zoonotic transmission of HEV from wild boars, an epidemiological
   survey has been conducted during the 2017-2018 - 2018-2019 hunting
   seasons in the Liguria region. Liver samples of 560 wild boars were
   analyzed for HEV RNA by realtime RT-PCR; positive samples were then
   sequenced and submitted to phylogenetic analysis. The results of the
   survey revealed the presence of HEV in 4.4\% (25/560) of the examined
   wild boar's livers. Phylogenetic analysis classified the isolates as HEV
   genotype 3, highlighting the risk related to the consumption of wild
   boar-derived products for humans. HEV sequences belonged to HEV subtypes
   3a, 3chi, 3c, and 3f, and 3{*} (unclassified). Our results indicate that
   HEV is circulating in wild boars among the considered game species in
   north-western Italy and suggest a potential zoonotic risk related to
   handling and/or consumption of raw or undercooked meat and products made
   of the liver from this species.},

Abstract = {Salmonella is the second main cause of foodborne illness in poultry
   production. It is one of the most problematic zoonoses in terms of
   public health worldwide because of the difficulty in controlling it and
   its significant morbidity and mortality rates. Recent surveys have shown
   that small flocks of laying hens have the same or higher prevalence of
   salmonellosis than larger flocks, mainly due to a lack of control
   actions, that is, the control of mice and wild animals, employees, and
   poor management practices. In this regard, different physical and
   chemical procedures have proven efficacious for reducing external and/or
   internal Salmonella contamination. This research evaluated the effect of
   ozone and UV-C rays on Salmonella growth and hen egg quality.
   Microbiological evaluation was performed on 120 eggs: negative control
   (C-), eggs not contaminated with Salmonella; positive control (C+), eggs
   contaminated; contaminated ozonate-treated (O, 600 mg/h for 2 h); and
   contaminated UV-C-irradiated (lambda, 254 nm for 15 s) eggs. Moreover,
   30 eggs were used (10/group) for the quality assessments of the C, O,
   and UV-C groups. A2 log(10) CFU/g reduction in Salmonella on
   contaminated eggs was found in the UV-C group compared with the C+ and O
   groups. Compared with UV-C treatment, ozonization reduced the amount of
   yolk tocols and carotenoids (by 2 times). The lipid oxidative status
   decreased (-1.5 times), similar to the cholesterol level (-28.5\%),
   whereas the amount of cholesterol and its oxidized products increased
   (+82.1\%) in the O group compared with the C group. UV-C irradiation is
   an effective strategy to reduce Salmonella contamination in eggs without
   negatively affecting the quality. Therefore, UV treatments remain among
   the more promising procedures.},

Title = {Clinical, Molecular and Serological Diagnosis of Canine Leishmaniosis:
   An Integrated Approach},
Journal = {VETERINARY SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Canine leishmaniosis (CanL) is caused by protozoans of the genus
   Leishmania and characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical signs in
   dogs. Early diagnosis is of great importance in order to perform an
   appropriate therapy and to prevent progression towards severe disease.
   The aim of this study was to compare a point-of-care molecular
   technique, i.e., the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), with
   a real-time polymerase chain reaction (Rt-PCR), and three serological
   techniques, i.e., immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT), enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and a rapid SNAP Leishmania test, to
   develop an integrated approach for the diagnosis of CanL. Sixty dogs
   were chosen after physical examination and collection of blood and sera
   samples, fine-needle aspiration of lymph nodes, and conjunctival swabs
   were performed. Lymphadenopathy (82.3\%), as well as clinicopathological
   alterations of total proteins (70.6\%), were the most frequent signs.
   Forty-one (68.3\%) samples resulted positive at least to one technique.
   IFAT resulted in the best serological diagnostic method (specificity =
   100\%, sensitivity = 97.2\%), detecting a higher number of positive
   samples than those revealed by other techniques. Among the samples used
   for molecular analysis, fine-needle aspiration of lymph nodes was
   revealed as the best sample source. LAMP showed a substantial agreement
   (kappa = 0.80; p <0.0001) with Rt-PCR; therefore, it could be promising
   for the rapid diagnosis of CanL. Nevertheless, further studies should be
   performed to confirm these findings.},

Abstract = {Functional rabies surveillance systems are crucial to provide reliable
   data and increase the political commitment necessary for disease
   control. To date, animals suspected as rabies-positive must be submitted
   to a postmortem confirmation using classical or molecular laboratory
   methods. However, most endemic areas are in low- and middle-income
   countries where animal rabies diagnosis is restricted to central
   veterinary laboratories. Poor availability of surveillance
   infrastructure leads to serious disease underreporting from remote
   areas. Several diagnostic protocols requiring low technical expertise
   have been recently developed, providing opportunity to establish rabies
   diagnosis in decentralized laboratories. We present here a complete
   protocol for field postmortem diagnosis of animal rabies using a rapid
   immunochromatographic diagnostic test (RIDT), from brain biopsy sampling
   to the final interpretation. We complete the protocol by describing a
   further use of the device for molecular analysis and viral genotyping.
   RIDT easily detects rabies virus and other lyssaviruses in brain
   samples. The principle of such tests is simple: brain material is
   applied on a test strip where gold conjugated antibodies bind
   specifically to rabies antigens. The antigenantibody complexes bind
   further to fixed antibodies on the test line, resulting in a clearly
   visible purple line. The virus is inactivated in the test strip, but
   viral RNA can be subsequently extracted. This allows the test strip,
   rather than the infectious brain sample, to be safely and easily sent to
   an equipped laboratory for confirmation and molecular typing. Based on a
   modification of the manufacturer's protocol, we found increased test
   sensitivity, reaching 98\% compared to the gold standard reference
   method, the direct immunofluorescence antibody test. The advantages of
   the test are numerous: rapid, easy-to-use, low cost and no requirement
   for laboratory infrastructure, such as microscopy or cold-chain
   compliance. RIDTs represent a useful alternative for areas where
   reference diagnostic methods are not available.},

Abstract = {Background: Neuron glial antigen 2 or chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan
   4 (NG2/CSPG4) is expressed by immature precursors/progenitor cells and
   is possibly involved in malignant cell transformation. The aim of this
   study was to investigate its role on the progression and survival of
   sixty-one adult gliomas and nine glioblastoma (GB)-derived cell lines.
   Methods: NG2/CSPG4 protein expression was assessed by
   immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Genetic and epigenetic
   alterations were detected by molecular genetic techniques. Results:
   NG2/CSPG4 was frequently expressed in IDH-mutant/1p19q-codel
   oligodendrogliomas (59.1\%) and IDH-wild type GBs (40\%) and rarely
   expressed in IDH-mutant or IDH-wild type astrocytomas (14.3\%). Besides
   tumor cells, NG2/CSPG4 immunoreactivity was found in the cytoplasm
   and/or cell membranes of reactive astrocytes and vascular
   pericytes/endothelial cells. In GB-derived neurospheres, it was variably
   detected according to the number of passages of the in vitro culture. In
   GB-derived adherent cells, a diffuse positivity was found in most cells.
   NG2/CSPG4 expression was significantly associated withEGFRgene
   amplification (p= 0.0005) and poor prognosis (p= 0.016) in astrocytic
   tumors. Conclusion: The immunoreactivity of NG2/CSPG4 provides
   information on the timing of the neoplastic transformation and could
   have prognostic and therapeutic relevance as a promising
   tumor-associated antigen for antibody-based immunotherapy in patients
   with malignant gliomas.},

Abstract = {Regenerative medicine aims to restore the normal function of diseased or
   damaged cells, tissues, and organs using a set of different approaches,
   including cell-based therapies. In the veterinary field, regenerative
   medicine is strongly related to the use of mesenchymal stromal cells
   (MSCs), which belong to the body repair system and are defined as
   multipotent progenitor cells, able to self-replicate and to
   differentiate into different cell types. This review aims to take stock
   of what is known about the MSCs and their use in the veterinary medicine
   focusing on clinical reports on dogs and horses in musculoskeletal
   diseases, a research field extensively reported in the literature data.
   Finally, a perspective regarding the use of the secretome and/or
   extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the veterinary field to replace parental
   MSCs is provided. The pharmaceuticalization of EVs is wished due to the
   realization of a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP product suitable for

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {y In this study, the performance of 63 existing pedotransfer functions
   (PTFs) is evaluated to estimate oven-dry soil bulk density (BD) by using
   a dataset of 3316 soil cores taken in the farmlands of Campania
   (southern Italy). As expected, the lack of direct calibration yields
   prediction accuracy from unsatisfactory to rather weak. Therefore, we
   advance the working hypothesis that the use of hierarchical soilmapping
   information can make the application of existing PTFs more reliable. We
   show that grouping data according to land-systems classes or soil groups
   considerably improves the prediction ability quantified through the root
   mean squared error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R-2). An
   independent data set of 105 soil cores taken fromtwo hillslopes in the
   Upper Alento River Catchment in southern Campaniawas used to verify our
   assumption. The validation step shows that the knowledge of a
   soil-landscape map is an efficient tool for improving the prediction of
   BD. This approach will be employed in a subsequent study to develop
   site-specific PTFs for the study region. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {In this study, the isolation of Acinetobacter baumannii in a dog with
   clinical bilateral otitis externa is described. Moreover, to investigate
   the zoonotic potential of the isolate, microbiological examinations on
   the family members were performed. An A. baumanniistrain was isolated
   from nasal swab in one of the dog owners. The identity of bacterial
   strains, either from dog and owner, was confirmed by phenotypic and
   molecular typing (wgMLST). Furthermore, to assess the pathogenic
   potential of the isolates a deep characterization of virulence and
   antibiotic resistance genes was done by Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS).
   Finally, the susceptibility towards a wide panel of antimicrobials was
   investigated. In our knowledge, this is the first recorded case of A.
   baumanniiisolation from canine auricular swabs in Italy. And
   interestingly, this study underlines the possible spread of this
   microorganism from human to animal.},

Abstract = {Simple Summary Veterinary services, along with public health
   professionals, can be involved in major adverse events resulting from
   processes of the Earth striking both humans and animals, so-called
   non-epidemic emergencies. A dedicated information system able to collect
   specific data and tprovide information to stakeholders is a
   pre-requisite for the management of these events. The Istituto
   Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise ``G.
   Caporale{''}, home of the National Reference Centre for Urban Hygiene
   and Non-Epidemic Emergencies (IUVENE), has been entrusted with the
   development of a system that provides different veterinary operational
   levels with a spatial and decisional tool to assist them in cases of
   natural disasters. This kind of decision support system is still missing
   at a national level. The present paper describes the implementation of
   the Veterinary Information System for Non-Epidemic Emergencies (SIVENE),
   an innovative, flexible, and user-friendly system and modular tool
   including a database, web application, mobile app, and Web Geographic
   Information Systems (GIS) component. SIVENE provides National Veterinary
   Services (local health units and national and regional veterinary
   services) with an emergency management tool responding to the needs
   identified in the context of catastrophic events, thanks to the data
   maintained within its database and converted into real time information.
   The Italian National Veterinary Services, public health professionals,
   and policy makers are asked to participate at different levels in the
   decision-making process for the management of non-epidemic emergencies.
   A decision support system offering the different administrative and
   operational emergency management levels with a spatial and decisional
   tool to be used in the case of natural disasters is still missing at the
   national level. Within this context, the Italian General Directorate for
   Animal Health of the Ministry of Health funded a research project for
   the implementation of a new Veterinary Information System for
   Non-Epidemic Emergencies (SIVENE), an innovative real-time decision
   support tool for emergency response in a disaster management scenario.
   SIVENE was developed according to a multi-layer architecture with four
   integrated components: the database layer, which was implemented by an
   RDBMS Oracle 11 g; the ReST service layer, which was created using J2EE,
   Spring, and MyBatis technologies; the web application (business
   framework and user interface), which was developed in Angular4 framework
   using TypeScript language; and the web Geographic Information Systems
   (GIS), which was realized through the implementation of a geodatabase in
   Oracle RDBMS 11 g. This system allows us to build up and dynamically
   create a set of dedicated checklists to be used in the field when
   gathering the information needed for the management of non-epidemic
   emergencies; employ the application on mobile devices, such as tablets
   and smartphones; and use the web GIS to manage and visualize data of
   veterinary interest and territorial maps of risk and damage.},

Abstract = {Twenty one pig farms, comprising about 14,400 sows and 90,000 fattening
   pigs, were examined relative to Leptospira serological positivity in
   fattening pigs. Twelve farms (57.14\%) were positive with average of
   41.67\% positive samples. L. canicola was the predominant serovar
   (100\%), with a few cross-reactions for other serovars. There was as
   strong correlation between average number of positive samples and number
   of sows in farm (R-2 = 0.9615). Number of positive samples was
   significantly higher in farms not vaccinating sows (P=0.0059);
   practicing natural insemination (P = 0.0280); keeping fattening pigs on
   a full floor (P=0.0019); presence of dogs (P=0.0002); farms with high
   proximity to each other and shared infrastructures like perimetral
   walls, sewage, roads, workers (P=.0.0005). In such a situation, swine
   breeders should vaccinate their breeders population, their dogs and
   implement management measures. Leptospirosis is a notifiable disease in
   Israel.},

Abstract = {Sicily (Italy) hosts an `endangered', endemic population ofAlectoris
   graeca whitakeri, commonly known as Sicilian Rock Partridge. An
   EU-funded Life Natura 2000 project has been founded, involving Istituto
   Zooprofilattico Sperimentale of Sicily for veterinary aspects: a total
   of 15 Sicilian Rock Partridge found dead were collected, identified and
   processed by postmortem examination and laboratory investigations. The
   evidence of internal parasites was the most relevant finding, showing
   different types of infections by Nematoda, Cestoda and Coccidia. 60 per
   cent of these cases were infected with more than one parasite. In one
   single case, a pathogenic strain ofEscherichia colirelated to
   granulocytic lesions in liver was found and another cause of death was
   due to respiratory disease caused byAspergillus fumigatus. The study
   represents the first veterinary report on this rare species and
   underlines the importance to monitor the health status of wild species
   in the Italian environment in order to preserve local biodiversity.},

Abstract = {Babesia caballi and Theileria equi are widely recognized as causative
   agents of equine pirolasmosis (EP), an acute, sub-acute, and chronic
   disease of equines, with relevant economic impact on horse trade
   worldwide. Although several studies on EP prevalence from central Italy
   have been published, data on ticks responsible for its transmission are
   still lacking. In this study, we identified a potential competent
   vector, investigating main features of its ecology together with EP
   infection rates. A two-year sampling of questing ticks was carried out
   for the first time in Italy in an area known for high EP prevalence in
   horse sera, detecting the association between Rhipicephalus bursa and
   causative agents of EP. Most of the positive pools harbored a single
   infection (91.1\%); mixed infections were also detected (8.9\%). The
   infection rate for T. equi slightly decreased among years; B. caballi
   showed a lower, but increasing, infection rate. Tick phenology, climate
   variables, and peaks of EP prevalence indicated late May and second half
   of June as periods with the highest risk of new infections, especially
   during warm and dry days.},

   which was further confirmed by the identification of
   aDeltapapillomavirus4by Next Generation Sequencing analysis. This was
   subsequently classified as bovine papillomavirus type 1. Negative
   staining electron microscopy (EM) analyses produced negative test
   results for papillomavirus particles. RNA in situ hybridization (ISH)
   confirmed the presence of BPV-1. The results further confirm the ability

Abstract = {A method to determine T-2 and HT-2 toxins, both in feed and food, is
   described. The method is based on sample clean-up by immunoaffinity
   columns, followed by triple quadrupole LC-MS/MS determination. It was
   in-house validated in compliance with the European Union legislation, in
   the concentration range 5.0-750 mu g kg(-1)and accredited according to
   the ISO/IEC 17025 standard, for the scope of official control of feed
   and food. The method was applied to monitor the contamination levels of
   T-2 and HT-2 toxins in 105 feed samples, both raw materials and compound
   feed and 17 cereals and derived products for human consumption,
   collected in Southern Italy between 2015 and 2019. T-2 toxin was
   quantified in 32 feed (30.5\%) and in 2 food samples (11.8\%). HT-2
   toxin was quantified in 65 feed (61.9\%) and in 3 food (17.6\%) samples.},

Title = {Retrospective spatial analysis for African swine fever in endemic areas

Abstract = {African Swine Fever (ASF) is one of the most complex and significant
   diseases from a sanitary-economic perspective currently affecting the
   world's swine-farming industry. ASF has been endemic in Sardinia (Italy)
   since 1978, and several control and eradication programmes have met with
   limited success. In this traditional ASF endemic area, there are three
   susceptible host populations for this virus sharing the same habitat:
   wild boar, farmed domestic pigs and non-registered free-ranging pigs
   (known as ``brado{''} animals). The main goal of this study was to
   determine and predict fine-scale spatial interactions of this multi host
   system in relation to the epidemiology of ASF in the main endemic area
   of Sardinia, Montes-Orgosolo. To this end, simultaneous monitoring of
   GPS-GSM collared wild boar and free-ranging pigs sightings were
   performed to predict interaction indexes through latent selection
   difference functions with environmental, human and farming factors.
   Regarding epidemiological assessment, the spatial inter-specific
   interaction indexes obtained here were used to correlate ASF
   notifications in wild boar and domestic pig farms. Daily movement
   patterns, home ranges (between 120.7 and 2,622.8 ha) and resource
   selection of wild boar were obtained for the first time on the island.
   Overall, our prediction model showed the highest spatial interactions
   between wild boar and free-ranging pigs in areas close to pig farms. A
   spatially explicit model was obtained to map inter-specific interaction
   over the complete ASF-endemic area of the island. Our approach to
   monitoring interaction indexes may help explain the occurrence of ASF
   notifications in wild boar and domestic pigs on a fine spatial scale.
   These results support the recent and effective eradication measures
   taken in Sardinia. In addition, this methodology could be extrapolated
   to apply in the current epidemiological scenarios of ASF in Eurasia,
   where exist multi-host systems involving free-ranging pigs and wild
   boar.},

Title = {Inter-annual variability of the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic
   drivers affecting West Nile virus vector Culex pipiens population
   dynamics in northeastern Italy},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},

Month = {MAY 29},
Abstract = {Background Vector-borne infectious diseases (VBDs) represent a major
   public health concern worldwide. Among VBDs, West Nile virus (WNV)
   showed an increasingly wider spread in temperate regions of Europe,
   including Italy. During the last decade, WNV outbreaks have been
   recurrently reported in mosquitoes, horses, wild birds, and humans,
   showing great variability in the temporal and spatial distribution
   pattern. Due to the complexity of the environment-host-vector-pathogen
   interaction and the incomplete understanding of the epidemiological
   pattern of the disease, WNV occurrences can be difficult to predict. The
   analyses of ecological drivers responsible for the earlier WNV
   reactivation and transmission are pivotal; in particular, variations in
   the vector population dynamics may represent a key point of the recent
   success of WNV and, more in general, of the VBDs. Methods We
   investigated the variations of Culex pipiens population abundance using
   environmental, climatic and trapping data obtained over nine years (2010
   to 2018) through the WNV entomological surveillance programme
   implemented in northeastern Italy. An information theoretic approach
   (IT-AIC(c)) and model-averaging algorithms were implemented to examine
   the relationship between the seasonal mosquito population growth rates
   and both intrinsic (e.g. intraspecific competition) and extrinsic (e.g.
   environmental and climatic variables) predictors, to identify the most
   significant combinations of variables outlining the Cx. pipiens
   population dynamics. Results Population abundance (proxy for
   intraspecific competition) and length of daylight were the predominant
   factors regulating the mosquito population dynamics; however, other
   drivers encompassing environmental and climatic variables also had a
   significant impact, although sometimes counterintuitive and not
   univocal. The analyses of the single-year datasets, and the comparison
   with the results obtained from the overall model (all data available
   from 2010 to 2018), highlighted remarkable differences in coefficients
   magnitude, sign and significance. These outcomes indicate that different
   combinations of factors might have distinctive, and sometimes divergent,
   effects on mosquito population dynamics. Conclusions A more realistic
   acquaintance of the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms of mosquito
   population fluctuations in relation to continuous changes in
   environmental and climatic conditions is paramount to properly reinforce
   VBDs risk-based surveillance activities, to plan targeted density
   control measures and to implement effective early detection programmes.},

Title = {Identification of Altered miRNAs in Cerumen of Dogs Affected by Otitis
   Externa},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAY 29},
Abstract = {Otitis externa is one of the most common diseases in dogs. It is
   associated with bacteria and yeast, which are regarded as secondary
   causes. Cerumen is a biological substance playing an important role in
   the protection of ear skin. The involvement of cerumen in immune defense
   is poorly understood. MicroRNAs can modulate the host immune response
   and can provide promising biomarkers for several inflammatory and
   infectious disorder diagnosis. The aims of this study were to profile
   the cerumen miRNA signature associated with otitis externa in dogs,
   integrate miRNAs to their target genes related to immune functions, and
   investigate their potential use as biomarkers. Cerumen was collected
   from healthy and otitis affected dogs and the expression of miRNAs was
   profiled by Next Generation Sequencing; the validation of the altered
   miRNAs was performed using RT-qPCR. The potential ability of miRNAs to
   modulate immune-related genes was investigated using bioinformatics
   tools. The results pointed out that 32 miRNAs, of which 14 were up- and
   18 down-regulated, were differentially expressed in healthy vs.
   otitis-affected dogs. These results were verified by RT-qPCR. To assess
   the diagnostic value of miRNAs, ROC analysis was carried out,
   highlighting that 4 miRNAs are potential biomarkers to discriminate
   otitis-affected dogs. Bioinformatics showed that cerumen miRNAs may be
   involved in the modulation of host immune response. In conclusion, we
   have demonstrated for the first time that miRNAs can be efficiently
   extracted and quantified from cerumen, that their profile changes
   between healthy and otitis affected dogs, and that they may serve as
   potential biomarkers. Further studies are necessary to confirm their
   diagnostic value and to investigate their interaction with
   immune-related genes.},

Title = {In Vitro Biocompatibility Evaluation of Nine Dermal Fillers on L929 Cell
   Line},
Journal = {BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {MAY 27},
Abstract = {Objective. Biomaterial research for soft tissue augmentation is an
   increasing topic in aesthetic medicine. Hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers are
   widely used for their low invasiveness and easy application to correct
   aesthetic defects or traumatic injuries. Some complications as acute or
   chronic inflammation can occur in patients following the injection.
   Biocompatibility assays are required for medical devices intended for
   human use, in order to prevent damages or injuries in the host. In this
   study, nine HA fillers were tested in order to evaluate their
   cytotoxicity and their effects on L929 cell line, according to the UNI
   EN ISO 10993 regulation. Methods. Extracts were prepared from nine HA
   fillers, and MTS viability assay was performed after 24 h, 48 h, and 72
   h of exposure of cells to extracts. Cells cultured with HA filler
   extracts were monitored for up to 72 h, counted, and stained with
   haematoxylin/eosin in order to evaluate the cell proliferation rate and
   morphology. Results. None of the filler tested showed a cytotoxic
   effect. Two samples showed a higher vitality percentage and higher cell
   number while two samples showed a lower vitality percentage and lower
   cell number at 72 h. Conclusion. Data obtained suggest that although
   examined fillers are not cytotoxic, they show different effects on the
   in vitro cell proliferation rate. In vitro studies of medical devices
   could lead to important implications since these could aid to predict
   effects about their in vivo application. These easy and rapid assays
   could be useful to test new materials intended for human use avoiding
   animal tests.},

Title = {Replication of Influenza D Viruses of Bovine and Swine Origin in Ovine
   Respiratory Explants and Their Attachment to the Respiratory Tract of
   Bovine, Sheep, Goat, Horse, and Swine},

Abstract = {Bovine is considered the main reservoir of influenza D virus (IDV),
   however, low levels of seropositivity in other farmed species suggest a
   wide range of potential hosts. Nevertheless, it is not clear whether
   this scenario is the result of rare spillover events upon contact with
   bovines, or a lack of adaptation of IDV to these hosts. Among these
   species, sheep represents a crucial component of the rural economy in
   many developing countries, but little is known about its role in the
   ecology of the disease. To evaluate the susceptibility of sheep to IDV
   viruses of different origin, we used ovine respiratory tissues as an ex
   vivo model and investigated the infective phenotype of two IDV strains
   isolated from either bovine (IDV-BOV) or swine (IDV-SW). For
   translatability purposes, we included a parainfluenza type 3 virus, as
   positive control, given its known respiratory tropism in sheep. We
   performed a timed evaluation of the viral infectivity, cell tropism and
   the associated histopathology, by means of tissue culture infectious
   dose assays on supernatants and histological/immunohistochemical
   analyses on explanted tissues, respectively. To further investigate
   differences in the phenotype of these two strains and to identify the
   potential targets of replication in the most commonly land-based farmed
   mammalian species, we carried out virus binding assays on histological
   sections of the respiratory tract of bovine, caprine, ovine, horse and
   swine. Our results demonstrated that IDV successfully replicates in
   nasal, tracheal and lung ovine tissues, suggesting a moderate
   susceptibility of this species to IDV infection. Interestingly, despite
   the high genetic identity of these strains, IDV- BOV consistently
   replicated to higher titers than IDV-SW in all respiratory tracts,
   suggesting IDV viruses might display considerable levels of variability
   in their phenotype when crossing the species barrier. Virus binding
   assays confirmed a superior affinity of the IDV viruses for the bovine
   upper respiratory tract, and a preference for the pharyngeal epithelium
   of small ruminants, indicating possible targets to improve the
   sensitivity of virological sampling for diagnostic and post-mortem
   purposes. Further pathogenesis and cross-species transmission studies
   will be necessary to elucidate the ecology of IDV and eventually allow
   the design of cost-effective surveillance strategies.},

   Calabria region, southern Italy},
Journal = {FOLIA PARASITOLOGICA},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a zoonotic disease caused by the tapeworms
   of the Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato complex, which have worldwide
   distribution. No data on the circulation of genotypes of the E.
   granulosus complex in intermediate hosts in endemic areas in Calabria
   arc available. The aims of our study were to evaluate the dispersal of
   genotypes of the E. granulosus complex in Calabria and to characterise
   parasite isolates by Sanger sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. We
   collected 71 animal samples from pigs, wild boars, sheep, cattle and
   goats. The first PCR screening analysis targeted three partial genomic
   regions: the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1), calreticulin protein
   (cal) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (nad1); this identified 28
   parasitic cysts. Bidirectional sequencing of cox1 amplicons and
   phylogenetic analysis allowed us to characterise all isolates. Molecular
   analyses of 28 newly generated cox1 sequences revealed that most wild
   boars (n = 16) and three pigs were parasitised by the larval stage of
   Taenia hydatidena Pallas, 1766, called cysticercus tenuicollis. Two
   isolates from wild boars were identified as Echinococcus canadensis
   Webster and Cameron, 1961 (G7), while five sheep and two goats were
   infected with E. granulosus G1 (sheep strain) and G1 microvariant
   (previously reported as G2 genotype or Tasmanian sheep strain),
   respectively. These molecular findings should prompt further and more
   extensive studies, to elucidate regional transmission patterns and to
   guide control programs.},

Abstract = {Technologies based on plasmonic nanostructures are a rapidly growing
   field that aims to be a valid alternative to conventional diagnostic
   tools. One of the main goals in their technological development consists
   of the design of systems for sensitive and specific detection of
   pathogens in water. Among these, rotaviruses represent the main cause of
   childhood viral gastroenteritis in humans. In this work, we design
   functionalized plasmonic label-free nanosensors based on localized
   surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) sensing to detect ultralow
   concentrations of rotavirus. We demonstrate the possibility of detecting
   in a specific way amounts lower than 1 x 10(3) plaque forming unit
   (PFU)/mL of the Rotavirus in water using a very low sample volume (2 mu
   L). These results together with those obtained in our specificity tests
   performed with two different viruses (bovine herpesvirus, BHV1; and
   equine viral arteritis, EVA) confirm that our device is very promising
   to develop a rapid, simple, very sensitive, and specific immunoassay for
   detection of rotavirus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
   time that LSPR nanobiosensing has been used for the sensitive and

Abstract = {Avian influenza viruses (AIV) are negative sense RNA viruses posing a
   major threat to the poultry industry worldwide, with the potential to
   spread to mammals, including humans; hence, an accurate and rapid AIV
   diagnosis is essential. To date AIV detection relies on molecular
   methods, mainly RT-qPCR directed against AIV M gene segment. The
   evolution of AIV represents a relevant issue in diagnostic RT-qPCR due
   to possible mispriming and/or probe-binding failures resulting in false
   negative results. Consequently, RT-qPCR for AIV detection should be
   periodically re-assessed both in silico and in vitro. To this end, a
   specific workflow was developed to evaluate in silico the
   complementarity of primers and probes of four published RT-qPCR
   protocols to their target regions. The four assays and one commercially
   available kit for AIV detection were evaluated both for their analytical
   sensitivity using eight different viral dilution panels and for their
   diagnostic performances against clinical specimens of known infectious
   status. Differences were observed among the tests under evaluation, both
   in terms of analytical sensitivity and of diagnostic performances. This
   finding confirms the importance of continuously monitoring the primers
   and probes complementarity to their binding regions.},

Number = {6},
Month = {MAY 21},
Abstract = {Nickel (Ni) is an essential element in plants and animals, but elevated
   levels can exert toxicity in living beings, as recently highlighted by
   the European Food Safety Authority opinion. However, literature
   regarding the presence of nickel in the environment is scarce. In 2016,
   the EU Commission Recommendation n degrees 1110 recommended monitoring
   the presence of Ni in feed in order to set maximum levels or to adopt
   other risk management measures to ensure a high level of animal health
   protection and consequently of human health. A total of 200 samples of
   feedingstuffs, drinking water, and milk were collected from dairy cow
   farms in Piedmont, and analyzed for Ni concentration by Z-ETA-AAS.
   Results showed the presence of nickel in feedingstuffs in a range from
   0.20 to 16 mg/kg, while Ni concentrations in water and milk were close
   to or below the limit of quantitation. There was no carry-over from feed
   to milk in this food chain. Nickel concentrations were not of concern
   for animal health despite being in the upper range of those observed in
   vegetables from Europe.},

Abstract = {BackgroundCulicoides obsoletus is an abundant and widely distributed
   Holarctic biting midge species, involved in the transmission of
   bluetongue virus (BTV) and Schmallenberg virus (SBV) to wild and
   domestic ruminants. Females of this vector species are often reported
   jointly with two morphologically very close species, C. scoticus and C.
   montanus, forming the Obsoletus/Scoticus Complex. Recently, cryptic
   diversity within C. obsoletus was reported in geographically distant
   sites. Clear delineation of species and characterization of genetic
   variability is mandatory to revise their taxonomic status and assess the
   vector role of each taxonomic entity. Our objectives were to
   characterize and map the cryptic diversity within the Obsoletus/Scoticus
   Complex.MethodsPortion of the cox1 mitochondrial gene of 3763
   individuals belonging to the Obsoletus/Scoticus Complex was sequenced.
   Populations from 20 countries along a Palaearctic Mediterranean transect
   covering Scandinavia to Canary islands (North to South) and Canary
   islands to Turkey (West to East) were included. Genetic diversity based
   on cox1 barcoding was supported by 16S rDNA mitochondrial gene sequences
   and a gene coding for ribosomal 28S rDNA. Species delimitation using a
   multi-marker methodology was used to revise the current taxonomic scheme
   of the Obsoletus/Scoticus Complex.ResultsOur analysis showed the
   existence of three phylogenetic clades (C. obsoletus clade O2, C.
   obsoletus clade dark and one not yet named and identified) within C.
   obsoletus. These analyses also revealed two intra-specific clades within
   C. scoticus and raised questions about the taxonomic status of C.
   montanus.ConclusionsTo our knowledge, our study provides the first
   genetic characterization of the Obsoletus/Scoticus Complex on a large
   geographical scale and allows a revision of the current taxonomic
   classification for an important group of vector species of livestock
   viruses in the Palaearctic region.},

Abstract = {Background Identifying factors that sustain parasite transmission is
   important for understanding their spread and emergence, including how
   changes in biodiversity may affect parasite prevalence and spread.
   Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite infecting humans and animals.
   Birds can acquire T. gondii infection through ingestion either of
   oocysts from the ground or of tissue cysts present in infected prey and
   are therefore suitable indicators of the presence of T. gondii in the
   natural environment. Methods The aim of the study included the
   evaluation of T. gondii seroprevalence in clinically healthy Eurasian
   kestrels (Falco tinnunculus) using a modified agglutination test. Birds
   were captured in a small area of Parma (northern Italy) for two
   consecutive years (2016-2017), sex and age determined and serological
   study carried out. Food sources for the birds were also evaluated, in
   particular rodent and grasshopper population estimates in the study
   area. The biomass of rodents and grasshoppers per hectare was estimated
   in order to directly compare food availability. Statistical analyses
   were performed in order to evaluate factors influencing the probability
   of kestrels being T. gondii-seropositive using R 3.4.4 fitting linear
   mixed-effect models with the `glmer' function of the package lme4,
   `lsmean' in package lsmean for pair-wise post-hoc comparisons using
   differences of least square means (DLSM) and the `betareg' function of
   the package betareg for beta regression. Results Seroprevalence for T.
   gondii was 33.3\% (49/147) in 2016, while in 2017 seroprevalence
   decreased to 14.3\% (13/91). An increase in the probability of kestrels
   being T. gondii-seropositive was associated with a higher rodent biomass
   in the environment, suggesting a positive feedback of the biotic factors
   driving infection risk. Conclusions These results underline the need for
   multidisciplinary studies aimed at better understanding pathogen-host
   relationships and for predictions in disease ecology.},

Abstract = {In the context of mRNA biomarker profiling, formalin fixed paraffin
   embedded (FFPE) samples represent an interesting source for
   retrospective analysis. However, the implementation in routine analysis
   of FFPE samples, following legislation demands for validated and
   accredited methods, often requires critical revision and optimization.
   In the frame of an official control program the validation study of a
   molecular test for detection of sex steroids administration in calves,
   based on quantification of progesterone-Receptor mRNA in bulbo-urethral
   gland samples, was performed: analyses were made on FFPE tissues
   sections routinary used for histological investigations and compared
   with RNAlater tissue preservation.
   To overcome the limitations of original assays several modifications
   were tested. Obtained results confirmed how Progesterone-Receptor assay
   represent a useful tool to study suspected cases of sex steroid illicit
   administration in veal calves, complementary to histological and/or
   immune histochemical investigation, overcoming the limitation of field
   studies, where optimal pre-analytical condition cannot always be

Abstract = {In aquaculture, fish species may experience stressful episodes caused by
   poor farming conditions. The exponential increase of global aquaculture
   has raised the number of research studies aimed at demonstrating the
   sensitivity of aquatic animals in confined environments. The development
   of a real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry methods were investigated to
   evaluate the presence, localization, and quantity of biomarkers of
   oxidative stress in European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). In
   particular, stress tests such as manipulation and temperature changes
   were conducted through molecular methods to identify the expression
   level of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in stressed animals compared with
   a control group. The immunohistochemical technique was also applied to
   locate and study the trends-levels of nitrotyrosine (NT), heat shock
   protein 70 (HSP70), malondialdehyde (MDA), and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE)
   in different tissues from stressed animals and control group. The
   presence of the rodlet cell (RCs) was evaluated by histology in both a
   control and stressed group. Our results show that the real-time PCR
   method developed is specific for the evaluated target gene and that
   manipulation and temperature increase are strong stressors for animals.
   Relative quantification data revealed a gene expression increase of
   HSP70 in the stressed group of animals compared to the control group.
   The antibodies used for the immunohistochemical staining were efficient,
   and it was possible to appreciate the increase of immunoprecipitates in
   European sea bass either manipulated or stressed by temperature
   increase. The present study can be a starting point to allow the
   quantification of HSP70 and the identification of other stress
   biomarkers in D. labrax.},

Abstract = {Substituting small molecule drugs with abundant and easily affordable
   ions may have positive effects on the way countless disease treatments
   are approached. The interest in strontium cation in bone therapies
   soared in the wake of the success of strontium ranelate in the treatment
   of osteoporosis. A new method for producing thin strontium-containing
   hydroxyapatite (Sr-HA, Ca9Sr(PO4)(6)(OH)(2)) films as coatings that
   render bioinert titanium implant bioactive is reported here. The method
   is based on the combination of a mechanochemical synthesis of Sr-HA
   targets and their deposition in form of thin films on top of titanium
   with the use of laser ablation at low pressure. The films were 1-2 mu m
   in thickness and their formation was studied at different temperatures,
   including 25, 300, and 500 degrees C. Highly crystalline Sr-HA target
   transformed during pulsed laser deposition to a fully amorphous film,
   whose degree of long-range order recovered with temperature. Particle
   edges became somewhat sharper and surface roughness moderately increased
   with temperature, but the (Ca+Sr)/P atomic ratio, which increased 1.5
   times during the film formation, remained approximately constant at
   different temperatures. Despite the mostly amorphous structure of the
   coatings, their affinity for capturing atmospheric carbon dioxide and
   accommodating it as carbonate ions that replace both phosphates and
   hydroxyls of HA was confirmed in an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic
   analysis. As the film deposition temperature increased, the lattice
   voids got reduced in concentration and the structure gradually
   ``closed,{''} becoming more compact and entailing a linear increase in
   microhardness with temperature, by 0.03 GPa/degrees C for the entire
   25-500 degrees C range. Biocompatibility and bioactivity of Sr-HA thin
   films deposited on titanium were confirmed in an interaction with dental
   pulp stem cells, suggesting that these coatings, regardless of the
   processing temperature, may be viable candidates for the surface

Title = {Enhanced West Nile Virus Circulation in the Emilia-Romagna and Lombardy
   Regions (Northern Italy) in 2018 Detected by Entomological Surveillance},

Abstract = {With several human cases reported annually since 2008 and the unapparent
   risk of infection of blood donors, the West Nile virus (WNV) is emerging
   as an important health issue in Europe. Italy, as well as other European
   countries, experienced a recrudescence of the virus circulation in 2018,
   which led to an increased number of human cases. An integrated
   surveillance plan was activated in the Emilia-Romagna and Lombardy
   regions (Northern Italy) since 2008 in order to monitor the intensity
   and timing of WNV circulation. A fundamental part of this plan consists
   in entomological surveillance. In 2018, the surveillance plan made it
   possible to collect 385,293 mosquitoes in 163 stations in the two
   Regions. In total 269,147 Culex mosquitoes were grouped into 2,337 pools
   and tested for WNV, which was detected in 232 pools. Circulation started
   in the central part of the Emilia-Romagna region in the middle of June,
   about one month before the previous seasons. Circulation suddenly
   expanded to the rest of the region and reached the Lombardy region in
   the middle of July. WNV circulated more intensively in the eastern part
   of the surveyed area, as confirmed by the highest number of human cases.
   A relationship between the number of mosquitoes collected and the virus
   incidence emerged, but the data obtained highlighted that the
   probability of detecting the virus in a given site was less than
   expected with a higher number of collected mosquitoes. A significant
   relationship was observed between the temperature recorded one week
   before the sampling and the number of collected mosquitoes, as well as
   between the estimated number of WNV-positive mosquitoes and the
   temperature recorded two weeks before the sampling. The two weeks delay
   in the influence of temperature on the positive mosquitoes is in line
   with the time of the virus extrinsic incubation in the mosquito. This
   finding confirms that temperature is one of the principal drivers in WNV
   mosquito infection. The surveillance system demonstrated the ability to
   detect the virus circulation early, particularly in areas where
   circulation was more intense. This allowed evaluating the effect of
   mosquito abundance and weather factors on virus circulation.},

Title = {Sarcoptic Mange in Wild Caprinae of the Alps: Could Pathology Help in
   Filling the Gaps in Knowledge?},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAY 5},
Abstract = {Sarcoptic mange represents the most severe disease for wild Caprinae
   individuals and populations in Europe, raising concerns for both
   conservation and management of these ungulates. To date, this disease
   has been investigated in different wild caprine species and under many
   different perspectives including diagnostics, epidemiology, impact on
   the host populations, and genetics of both hosts and parasite, with the
   aim to disentangle the host-Sarcoptes scabiei relationship.
   Notwithstanding, uncertainty remains and basic questions still need an
   answer. Among these are the effect of immune responses on mange severity
   at an individual level, the main drivers in host-parasite interactions
   for different clinical outcomes, and the role of the immune response in
   determining the shift from epidemic to endemic cycle. A deeper approach
   to the pathology of this disease seems therefore advisable, all the more
   reason considering that immune response to S. scabiei in wild Caprinae,
   generally classified as a hypersensitivity, remains poorly understood.
   In this paper, we reviewed the pathological features associated to
   sarcoptic mange in wildlife, exploring different kinds of
   hypersensitivity and outcomes, with the objective of highlighting the
   major drivers in the different responses to this disease at an
   individual level and proposing some key topics for future research, with
   a particular attention to Alps-dwelling wild caprines.},

Abstract = {Salmonella Infantis is one of the five serovars most frequently causing
   human salmonellosis in Europe, mainly associated with poultry. A clone
   harbouring a conjugative plasmid of emerging S. Infantis (pESI)-like
   megaplasmid, carrying multidrug resistant (MDR) and extended-spectrum
   beta-lactamases (ESBL) genes, has spread in the Italian broiler chicken
   industry also causing human illness. This work is aimed at elucidating
   the molecular epidemiology of S. Infantis and pESI-like in Europe using
   whole-genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, and to investigate
   the genetic relatedness of S. Infantis clones and pESI-like from
   animals, meat, feed and humans provided by institutions of nine European
   countries. Two genotyping approaches were used: chromosome or plasmid
   SNP-based analysis and the minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm based
   on core-genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST). The European S.
   Infantis population appeared heterogeneous, with different genetic
   clusters defined at core-genome level. However, pESI-like variants
   present in 64.1 \% of the isolates were more genetically homogeneous and
   capable of infecting different clonal lineages in most of the countries.
   Two different pESI-like with ESBL genes (n=82) were observed:
   bla(CTX-M-1)-positive in European isolates and bla(CTX-M-65)-positive in
   American isolates (study outgroup). Both variants had toxin-antitoxin
   systems, resistance genes towards tetracyclines, trimethoprim,
   sulphonamides and aminoglycosides, heavy metals (merA) and disinfectants
   (qacE Delta). Worryingly, 66\% of the total isolates studied presented
   different gyrA chromosomal point mutations associated with
   (fluoro)quinolone resistance (MIC range 0.125-0.5 mg/L), while 18\%
   displayed transferable macrolide resistance mediated by mph, mef and
   erm(B) genes. Proper intervention strategies are needed to prevent
   further dissemination/transmission of MDR S. Infantis and pESI-like
   along the food chain in Europe.},

Abstract = {Introduction: North Africa has become a key migratory hub where a large
   number of migrants attempt the journey by sea from the Libyan coastline
   to the south of Europe. In this humanitarian disaster scenario, the
   Mediterranean route has been one of the most used by illegal boats.
   Methodology: In this report, the state of physical and psychological
   health of a cluster of Eritrean migrants, escaped from Libya and rescued
   in the Mediterranean Sea after a shipwreck, was described by
   epidemiological, clinical and laboratory investigations.
   Results: Data suggest that despite the majority of the migrants being
   apparently in good health upon a syndromic surveillance approach, most
   of them suffered a decline in psychological status as well as severe
   malnutrition. The emergence of infectious diseases, related to poor
   living conditions during the journey, is not a rare event.
   Conclusion: The present report highlights the risks of failures of the
   syndromic medical approach in the setting of the extremely challenging
   migration route and underlines migrant frailties consequent to a
   prolonged journey and long period of detention. These stressors, which
   can degrade the initial health condition of traveling migrants, can lead
   to a premature ``exhausted migrant effect{''} that should be carefully
   investigated in order to avoid the early emergence of diseases related
   to frailty.},

Abstract = {Leptospirosis is an infectious disease that causes serious illness in
   dogs. For this reason, epidemiological and clinical studies focusing on
   disease characterization are widely advocated. The aim of this study was
   to characterize the leptospires identified in dogs with confirmed
   symptomatic acute leptospirosis. Leptospira spp. DNA detected in urine,
   blood, or both samples from nine infected dogs was analyzed using the
   multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) technique. Leptospires from two dogs
   were successfully typed: one was identified as belonging to Sequence
   Type (ST) 17 and one to ST198, both within the L. interrogans species,
   serogroups Icterohaemorrhagiae and Australis, respectively. Based on the
   results of routine serologic tests, antibodies reactive toward these
   serogroups are commonly revealed in dogs in Italy. This study provides
   the first molecular analysis that identifies infecting Leptospira
   directly on DNA from biological samples of dogs, showing that serogroup
   Australis can lead to a severe clinical presentation of leptospirosis in
   infected dogs.},

Abstract = {Shellfish farming is a relevant economic activity in Italy. The Gulf of
   La Spezia is one of the major production areas for mussels: the area is
   characterized by the presence of numerous human activities that could
   harm the quality of seawater. Additionally, the presence of potentially
   pathogenic microorganisms may influence the health status of animals,
   which must be constantly monitored. To have a clear view of the health
   conditions of the mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) farmed in this
   area, microbiological, parasitological, and histological analyses were
   performed. The study was conducted from November 2016 to October 2017.
   Overall, despite the presence of potentially pathogenic microorganisms
   for mussels, abnormal mortality rates were not reported during the
   monitoring period and the histological examination revealed no
   significant lesions. Our study confirms that studying different aspects
   together is a useful tool for assessing the health conditions of mussels
   and points out the importance of adverse environmental conditions for
   the expression of the pathogenicity of microorganisms.},

Title = {Volatile Profile in Yogurt Obtained from Saanen Goats Fed with Olive
   Leaves},
Journal = {MOLECULES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the development of volatile
   compounds in yogurt samples obtained from goats fed a dietary
   supplementation with olive leaves (OL). For this purpose, thirty Saanen
   goats were divided into two homogeneous groups of 15 goats each: a
   control group that received a standard diet (CG) and an experimental
   group whose diet was supplemented with olive leaves (OLG). The trial
   lasted 28 days, at the end of which the milk of each group was collected
   and used for yogurt production. Immediately after production, and after
   7 days of storage at 4 degrees C in the absence of light, the yogurt
   samples were characterized in terms of fatty acid profile, oxidative
   stability and volatile compounds by the solid-phase microextraction
   (SPME)-GC/MS technique. Dietary OL supplementation positively affected
   the fatty acid composition, inducing a significant increase in the
   relative proportion of unsaturated fatty acids, mainly oleic acid (C18:1
   cis9) and linolenic acid (C18:3). With regard to the volatile profile,
   both in fresh and yogurt samples stored for 7 days, the OL
   supplementation induced an increase in free fatty acids, probably due to
   an increase in lipolysis carried out by microbial and endogenous milk
   enzymes. Specifically, the largest variations were found for C6, C7, C8
   and C10 free fatty acids. In the same samples, a significant decrease in
   aldehydes, mainly heptanal and nonanal, was also detected, supporting-at
   least in part-an improvement in the oxidative stability. Moreover,
   alcohols, esters and ketones appeared lower in OLG samples, while no
   significant variations were observed for lactones. These findings
   suggest the positive role of dietary OL supplementation in the
   production of goats' milk yogurt, with characteristics potentially
   indicative of an improvement in nutritional properties and flavor.},

Journal = {VIRUSES-BASEL},

Abstract = {Usutu virus (USUV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, closely related to
   the West Nile virus (WNV). Similar to WNV, USUV may cause infections in
   humans, with occasional, but sometimes severe, neurological
   complications. Further, USUV can be highly pathogenic in wild and
   captive birds and its circulation in Europe has given rise to
   substantial avian death. Adequate study models of this virus are still
   lacking but are critically needed to understand its pathogenesis and
   virulence spectrum. The chicken embryo is a low-cost, easy-to-manipulate
   and ethically acceptable model that closely reflects mammalian fetal
   development and allows immune response investigations, drug screening,
   and high-throughput virus production for vaccine development. While
   former studies suggested that this model was refractory to USUV
   infection, we unexpectedly found that high doses of four
   phylogenetically distinct USUV strains caused embryonic lethality. By
   employing immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse
   transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we demonstrated that USUV was
   widely distributed in embryonic tissues, including the brain, retina,
   and feather follicles. We then successfully developed a primary cell
   line from the chorioallantoic membrane that was permissive to the virus
   without the need for viral adaptation. We believe the future use of
   these models would foster a significant understanding of USUV-induced
   neuropathogenesis and immune response and allow the future development
   of drugs and vaccines against USUV.},

Title = {Serological Survey and Molecular Typing Reveal New Leptospira Serogroup
   Pomona Strains among Pigs of Northern Italy},
Journal = {PATHOGENS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Swine act as both maintenance and incidental hosts of pathogenic
   Leptospira spp. Here, a serological test was performed on 131,660 pig
   sera collected between 2002 and 2017 from 4715 farms in Northern Italy.
   A positivity rate of 13.05\% was determined. Australis was the most
   frequently identified serogroup (77.29\%), followed by Pomona (18.47\%),
   Tarassovi (1.51\%) and Icterohaemorrhagie (1.40\%). Culture isolation
   and real-time Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were carried out on 347
   kidneys and 470 clinical samples, respectively. Overall, 133 strains
   were cultured successfully and 43 randomly chosen isolates were
   identified as serogroup Pomona. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST)
   revealed that 41 isolates and 8 DNA extracted from biological samples
   belonged to sequence type 140. Using a multiple-locus, variable-number
   tandem repeat analysis, 43 samples produced identical profiles but,
   after 2014, three new Leptospira interrogans serogroup Pomona genotypes
   were observed. Interestingly, two isolates showed new MLST profiles and
   an unclassified identification by monoclonal antibodies. The 16S rRNA
   gene sequencing clustered them into L. kirschneri species and a core
   genome MLST analysis revealed an allelic identity of 96\% compared with
   Mozdok strains. Genotyping allowed us to discriminate leptospires and to
   identify new emerging strains. The accurate identification of infective
   strains is required for formulating preventive methods and intervention
   strategies.},

Abstract = {Background. Diagnosis of anisakis allergy (AA) is based on the skin
   prick test (SPT) and specific IgE (sIgE) determination. Anyway, false
   positivity cases are due to cross reactivity with numerous allergens.
   The aim of the study was to evaluate the reliability of a comprehensive
   diagnostic algorithm for the AA. Methods. An observational study was
   conducted on a sample of consecutive subjects accessing the allergology
   outpatient ambulatories of two hospitals located in Western Sicily. All
   the recruited outpatients were tested by Skin Prick Test performed using
   anisakis extracts by ALK-Abello (Madrid, Spain). Specific IgE dosage for
   anisakis extracts was then performed by using ImmunoCAP250
   (Immunodiagnostics Uppsala, Sweden). Consequently, outpatients who
   tested positive to first line tests underwent sIgE testing for ascaris
   and tropomyosin. Lastly, outpatients positive to the first line were
   invited to be further tested by basophil activation test (BAT) by using
   Flow CAST kit and anisakis commercial extract (Buhlmann Laboratories AG,
   Schonenbuch, Switzerland), as confirmatory analysis. Results. One
   hundred and eleven outpatients with an anamnesis suggestive of
   sensitization to anisakis (AS) and 466 subjects with chronic urticaria
   (CU) were recruited in the study. Of these, 22 with AS and 41 with CU
   showed a sensitization to anisakis allergens. The diagnostic algorithm
   revealed that 8.8\% of outpatients who tested positive to sIgE
   determination were affected by CU, while 82.5\% of all the sIgE
   positivity was related to cross-reactivity. Overall, a genuine anisakis
   seroprevalence of 2.3\% was documented. Within a sub-sample of 15
   subjects with clinical symptoms related to AA, n. 8 showed a real
   positivity after BAT. A greater response to A. pegreffii allergens as
   compared to A. simplex was reported. Conclusions. Our preliminary
   findings support the high clinical specificity of BAT for AA diagnosis,
   suggesting implementing this method in a comprehensive diagnostic
   algorithm.},

Title = {Trace Elements in Home-Processed Food Obtained from Unconventional
   Animals},
Journal = {LIFE-BASEL},

Abstract = {Wild animals have been used as food since ancient times and, currently,
   the consumption of unconventional animals is increasing worldwide. The
   process of cooking meat using traditional recipes includes a variety of
   ingredients, which can influence the total metal intake from the diet.
   In this study, the concentrations of eight essential (Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn,
   Se, Ni, Mo, and Co) and six non-essential (Pb, Cd, Hg, Al, As, and Cr)
   trace elements were determined in home-processed food obtained from
   snails and from three common species of game animals (woodcock,
   pheasant, and hare), seasoned with anchovies, mushrooms, and different
   vegetables using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).
   In general, Fe was the most abundant trace element, ranging from 18 +/-
   8 mu g/g in pheasant to 99 +/- 76 mu g/g in snail, and Co was the least
   abundant, ranging from 0.007 +/- 0.003 mu g/g in hare to 0.093 +/- 0.048
   mu g/g in snail. Regarding the non-essential trace elements, Pb
   concentrations showed wide variations, reaching a concentration of 17.30
   mu g/g in hare, while Cd concentrations were higher in snail, ranging
   from 0.18 to 0.46 mu g/g. These alternative food sources can offer an
   important contribution to the human nutritional requirements of
   essential trace elements, in particular of Fe. The high concentrations
   of Pb and Cd present in some samples should be considered as potentially
   dangerous for the consumers.},

Title = {Novel Hybrid Composites Based on PVA/SeTiO2 Nanoparticles and Natural
   Hydroxyapatite for Orthopedic Applications: Correlations between
   Structural, Morphological and Biocompatibility Properties},
Journal = {MATERIALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The properties of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)-based composites recommend
   this material as a good candidate for the replacement of damaged
   cartilage, subchondral bone, meniscus, humeral joint and other
   orthopedic applications. The manufacturing process can be manipulated to
   generate the desired biomechanical properties. However, the main
   shortcomings of PVA hydrogels are related to poor strength and
   bioactivity. To overcome this situation, reinforcing elements are added
   to the PVA matrix. The aim of our work was to develop and characterize a
   novel composition based on PVA reinforced with Se-doped TiO2
   nanoparticles and natural hydroxyapatite (HA), for possible orthopedic
   applications. The PVA/Se-doped TiO2 composites with and without HA were
   structurally investigated by FTIR and XRD, in order to confirm the
   incorporation of the inorganic phase in the polymeric structure, and by
   SEM and XRF, to evidence the ultrastructural details and dispersion of
   nanoparticles in the PVA matrix. Both the mechanical and structural
   properties of the composites demonstrated a synergic reinforcing effect
   of HA and Se-doped TiO2 nanoparticles. Moreover, the tailorable
   properties of the composites were proved by the viability and
   differentiation potential of the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells
   (BMMSC) to osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic lineages. The novel
   hybrid PVA composites show suitable structural, mechanical and
   biological features to be considered as a promising biomaterial for
   articular cartilage and subchondral bone repair.},

Title = {Unexpected Genetic Diversity of Two Novel Swine MRVs in Italy},
Journal = {VIRUSES-BASEL},
Year = {2020},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Mammalian Orthoreoviruses (MRV) are segmented dsRNA viruses in the
   family Reoviridae. MRVs infect mammals and cause asymptomatic
   respiratory, gastro-enteric and, rarely, encephalic infections. MRVs are
   divided into at least three serotypes: MRV1, MRV2 and MRV3. In Europe,
   swine MRV (swMRV) was first isolated in Austria in 1998 and subsequently
   reported more than fifteen years later in Italy. In the present study,
   we characterized two novel reassortant swMRVs identified in one same
   Italian farm over two years. The two viruses shared the same genetic
   backbone but showed evidence of reassortment in the S1, S4, M2 segments
   and were therefore classified into two serotypes: MRV3 in 2016 and MRV2
   in 2018. A genetic relation to pig, bat and human MRVs and other unknown
   sources was identified. A considerable genetic diversity was observed in
   the Italian MRV3 and MRV2 compared to other available swMRVs. The S1
   protein presented unique amino acid signatures in both swMRVs, with
   unexpected frequencies for MRV2. The remaining genes formed distinct and
   novel genetic groups that revealed a geographically related evolution of
   swMRVs in Italy. This is the first report of the complete molecular
   characterization of novel reassortant swMRVs in Italy and Europe, which
   suggests a greater genetic diversity of swMRVs never identified before.},

Title = {Early Renal Involvement in Cats with Natural Feline Morbillivirus
   Infection},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Feline morbillivirus is a newly discovered paramyxovirus
   infecting domestic cats. Its pathogenetic role in domestic cats is still
   debated, however some evidences suggest a potential involvement of this
   novel feline virus in the pathogenesis of feline chronic kidney disease.
   In this study, clinical data of cats infected by morbillivirus were
   retrospectively reviewed and compared with data obtained from healthy
   cats and cats affected by chronic kidney disease. The results of the
   present study suggest that this infection can be associated with the
   presence of a sub-clinical kidney damage and with different grades of
   renal dysfunction in cats younger than those typically affected by
   chronic kidney disease.
   Abstract Feline morbillivirus (FeMV) is a newly discovered paramyxovirus
   infecting domestic cats and its role in the pathogenesis of feline
   chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been suggested, however not confirmed.
   The primary aim of the study was to evaluate the renal damage associated
   with FeMV infection in cats. In this retrospective study, clinical and
   clinicopathological data were compared among 14 FeMV naturally infected,
   21 CKD and 22 healthy cats. FeMV positive cats had serum chemistry
   analytes and main urine chemistry results similar to the healthy
   subjects. FeMV positive cats had significantly decreased urine specific
   gravity (median 1054, range 1022-1065) and urine creatinine (median
   227.23 mg/dL, range 83.02-489.75) when compared with healthy cats
   (median 1067, range 1040-1080, p < 0.001; median 406.50 mg/dL, range
   195.32-575.58; p < 0.001, respectively). Urine protein:creatinine ratio
   (UPC) results of FeMV and CKD were not different (median 0.20, range
   0.08-1.03; median 0.23, range 0.10-0.80, respectively), however UPC
   results were significantly increased in both groups, if compared with
   healthy cats (median 0.1, range 0.04-0.250, p < 0.01). Based on clinical
   data, serum creatinine concentration, urine specific gravity and UPC
   results, CKD was suspected by clinicians in 3/14 FeMV cats. Urine
   protein sodium-dodecyl-sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
   (SDS-PAGE) in 10/13 (77\%) FeMV cats indicated a tubular pattern, with a
   decrease of uromodulin and an increase in the number and intensity of
   low molecular weight proteins. FeMV infection can be associated with
   different grades of renal dysfunction ranging from mild tubular
   proteinuria with less concentrated urine to azotemia in cats younger
   than those typically affected by CKD.},

Title = {Novel human coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2): A lesson from animal coronaviruses},
Journal = {VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {244},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The recent pandemic caused by the novel human coronavirus, referrred to
   as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), not
   only is having a great impact on the health care systems and economies
   in all continents but it is also causing radical changes of common
   habits and life styles. The novel coronavirus (CoV) recognises, with
   high probability, a zoonotic origin but the role of animals in the
   SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology is still largely unknown. However, CoVs have
   been known in animals since several decades, so that veterinary
   coronavirologists have a great expertise on how to face CoV infections
   in animals, which could represent a model for SARS-CoV-2 infection in
   humans.
   In the present paper, we provide an up-to-date review of the literature
   currently available on animal CoVs, focusing on the molecular mechanisms
   that are responsible for the emergence of novel CoV strains with

Abstract = {Porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3) is a recently discovered member of the
   Circoviridae family. So far, its presence has been reported in North
   America, Asia, South America, and Europe. In this study, blood and
   tissue samples from 189 Sardinian suids (34 domestic pigs, 115 feral
   free ranging pigs, and 39 wild boars) were used to genetically
   characterize the PCV3 strains from Sardinia. PCV3 infection in the
   animals was confirmed by real time PCR. The detection rate in the three
   groups analyzed was l7.64\% in domestic pigs, 77.39\% in free ranging
   pigs, and 61.54\% in wild boars. Moreover, our results showed that
   co-infection of PCV3 with other viruses is quite a common occurrence.
   Molecular characterization of Sardinian PCV3 strains was performed by
   sequencing 6 complete genomes and 12 complete cap genes. Our results
   revealed that there is a high similarity between our strains and those
   identified in different countries, confirming the genetic stability of
   PCV3 regardless of geographical origin. Haplotype network analysis
   revealed the presence of 6 whole genomes or 12 unique ORF2 haplotypes
   and a nonsynonymous mutation in ORF2 that leads to an R14K amino acid
   substitution. Phylogenetic analysis of whole genome and ORF2 was also
   conducted. The Sardinian strains were allocated in three different
   clusters of phylogenetic trees of both complete genome and ORF2. With
   this study, we have provided a snapshot of PCV3 circulation in Sardinia.
   Our findings might help to achieve a deeper understanding of this
   emerging porcine virus.},

Abstract = {Salmonellosis is a major cause of bacterial foodborne infection. Since
   2016, an increased number of cases of gastroenteritis caused by
   Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis linked to eggs produced in
   Poland has been reported in Europe. In Italy, S. Enteritidis is one of
   the three most commonly reported serotypes, associated mainly with the
   consumption of contaminated eggs and derived products. In our work, we
   analysed 61 strains of S. Enteritidis obtained from humans and farms in
   the Abruzzi region, Italy, in 2018. We used Multiple-Loci
   Variable-Number Tandem Repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA)-based typing and
   Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS) tools to identify closely related strains
   and perform cluster analysis. We found two clusters of genetically
   similar strains. The first one was present in the local farms and
   isolated from human cases and had single-linkage distance of no more
   than two core genes and less than five Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms
   (SNPs). The second cluster contained strains isolated from humans and
   from a dessert (tiramisU) sample that shared identical core genome and
   were assigned the same SNP address. Cluster 2 isolates were found to be
   genetically similar to an S. Enteritidis strain from a multi-country
   outbreak linked to Polish eggs.},

Abstract = {Injured tendons are challenging in their regeneration; thus, tissue
   engineering represents a promising solution. This research tests the
   hypothesis that the response of amniotic epithelial stem cells (AECs)
   can be modulated by fiber diameter size of tendon biomimetic fleeces.
   Particularly, the effect of electrospun poly(lactide-co-glycolide)
   (PLGA) fleeces with highly aligned microfibers possessing two different
   diameter sizes (1.27 and 2.5 mu m: ha1- and ha2-PLGA, respectively) was
   tested on the ability of AECs to differentiate towards the tenogenic
   lineage by analyzing tendon related markers (Collagen type I: COL1
   protein and mRNA Scleraxis: SCX, Tenomodulin: TNMD and COL1 gene
   expressions) and to modulate their immunomodulatory properties by
   investigating the pro- (IL-6 and IL-12) and anti- (IL-4 and IL-10)
   inflammatory cytokines. It was observed that fiber alignment and not
   fiber size influenced cell morphology determining the morphological
   change of AECs from cuboidal to fusiform tenocyte-like shape. Instead,
   fleece mechanical properties, cell proliferation, tenogenic
   differentiation, and immunomodulation were regulated by changing the
   ha-PLGA microfiber diameter size. Specifically, higher DNA quantity and
   better penetration within the fleece were found on ha2-PLGA, while
   ha1-PLGA fleeces with small fiber diameter size had better mechanical
   features and were more effective on AECs trans-differentiation towards
   the tenogenic lineage by significantly translating more efficiently SCX
   into the downstream effector TNMD. Moreover, the fiber diameter of 1.27
   mu m induced higher expression of pro-regenerative, anti-inflammatory
   interleukins mRNA expression (IL-4 and IL-10) with favorable IL-12/IL-10
   ratio with respect to the fiber diameter of 2.5 mu m. The obtained
   results demonstrate that fiber diameter is a key factor to be considered
   when designing tendon biomimetic fleece for tissue repair and provide
   new insights into the importance of controlling matrix parameters in
   enhancing cell differentiation and immunomodulation either for the cells
   functionalized within or for the transplanted host tissue.},

Abstract = {Non-essential toxic metals are environmental pollutants that contaminate
   the marine ecosystem due to their extensive use and long-range transport
   (by rivers and air). Their presence into the environment is often linked
   to the human activity, with an expected bioaccumulation in the food
   chain. Within the marine animals, sea turtles may be considered as
   potential sentinel species for environmental assessment because of their
   long lifetime, habitat use and migratory nature.
   In this study, non-essential toxic metals in the coastal of Tyrrhenian
   Sea were monitored, during the 2017-2018 period, using the Mediterranean
   loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) as indicator species. The levels
   of Cadmium (Cd), Arsenic (As), Mercury (Hg) and Lead, (Pb) were
   determined in 30 turtles stranded in different locations along the
   coasts of Campania region of Southern Daly. After morphometric analysis,
   the nonessential toxic metal accumulation in loggerhead sea turtle
   muscle and organs have been measured analysing the total concentrations
   of metals in samples of liver, kidney, and muscle by Atomic Absorption
   Spectrophotometry (AAS) after microwave assisted digestion with nitric
   acid and hydrogen peroxide. The pattern of contaminants revealed a
   similar distribution for Pb and total mercury, that were not
   significantly high in all the analysed matrices. On the contrary,
   elevated concentrations of total As were found out in all matrices,
   mainly in muscle (25.7 mg/kg w.w.), and of Cd in liver (1.23 mg/kg w.w.)
   and kidney (6.82 mg/kg w.w.). These studies allow us to estimate the
   exposure degree to which these species are subjected.},

Abstract = {The overuse of antibiotics in livestock contributes to the antibiotic
   resistance pandemic. The assessment of the actual antibiotic consumption
   is crucial in limiting the expansion of the problem effectively. The aim
   of this study was to provide the first qualitative and quantitative
   analysis of antimicrobial usage using data from paper-based registers on
   dairy and beef farms located in the Umbria region, Italy. Antimicrobial
   therapies of a one-year period were collected from 101 farms with at
   least 50 cattle each. Defined daily doses (DDDvet) and defined course
   doses (DCDvet) were calculated per administration route and
   antimicrobial class. The total courses administered were fewer in beef
   (330.7 x 10(-3) DCDvet/year) than in dairy farms (1034.1 x 10(-3)
   DCDvet/year). The use of the highest priority critically important
   antimicrobials (HPCIAs) was higher (p = 0.0033) in dairy than in beef
   herds. In terms of DDDvet, the parenteral fluoroquinolone administration
   ranked second and fourth on dairy and beef farms, respectively; the
   consumption of beta-lactams was ten times higher on dairy than on beef
   farms. Our results confirm that intensive dairy management practices are
   associated with increased antibiotic consumption and highlight the
   necessity to strengthen the existing stewardship programs by involving
   all stakeholders in effective antimicrobial resistance reduction plans.},

Abstract = {This research communication explores the value of routinely collected
   bulk tank milk quality data for estimating dairy cattle welfare at herd
   level. Selected bulk tank milk quality parameters (somatic cell count,
   total bacterial count, urea, protein and fat contents) recorded during
   the years 2014-2016 in 287 Italian dairy farms were compared with the
   animal welfare data of each farm. The welfare assessment data were
   extracted from the database of the Italian Reference Centre for Animal
   Welfare (CReNBA), which includes the outputs of the application of the
   CReNBA welfare assessment protocol for dairy cows, used at national
   level for on-farm controls. The statistical analysis was carried out
   using the correlation coefficient for Kendall's Tau ranks, in order to
   investigate the presence of a categoric relationship between the
   selected bulk tank milk quality parameters and the overall animal
   welfare score or the scores of the single areas A (farm management and
   staff training), B (housing) and C (animal-based measures). Somatic cell
   count, total bacterial count, urea and proteins demonstrated only a few
   statistically significant and very weak correlations with farm animal
   welfare data, while no significant correlations were obtained for milk
   fat content. Given the weak correlations found, the selected bulk tank
   milk parameters seems to be able to provide only limited information
   about the welfare level of the herd, thus it could be difficult to use
   them for drawing up a pre-screening model for identifying herds at risk
   of poor welfare.},

Title = {Uranium, thorium and potassium insights on Campania region (Italy)
   soils: Sources patterns based on compositional data analysis and fractal
   mode},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {212},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Uranium, thorium and potassium are distinguished in different
   compartments of the environmental media according to the inputs, the
   fate and the distribution patterns that occur in the ecosystems. Thus,
   an understanding of the sources patterns and behaviours of these
   elements in soils, their rock-soil relationships and potential toxicity
   or deficiency problems associated with them is nowadays a relevant
   concern for environmental protection and human health. A robust
   compositional computation analysis coupled with frequency spatial-method
   (Fractal model) is applied on 3 selected elements (U, Th and K), based
   on a large dataset of 7134 topsoil samples over the whole Campania
   region, and investigated elements concentrations were analysed (after
   aqua regia extraction) by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
   (ICP-MS). In this survey, U concentrations ranged from 0.05 to 43.2 mg
   kg(-1) with a mean value of 3.35 mg kg(-1), Th concentrations ranged
   from 0.3 to 64.30 mg kg(-1) with a mean values of 11.95 mg kg(-1) and K
   concentrations ranged from 0.03 to 5.97\% with a mean value of 0.68\%.
   The mean values for U and Th are slightly above the mean crustal
   abundances, while K is slightly below them. Fractal mapping of
   Centred-log transformed (clr) data of investigated elements show that
   the U, Th and K geochemical anomalies can be ascribed to geology-related
   volcanic sources. Indeed, the highest values in soils were assessed in
   the surveyed alkaline magmatic areas in the central-western part of the
   region characterized by volcanic rocks, whereas lowest values are found
   in areas characterized by silico-clastic and carbonate deposits,
   occurring mostly in the southern and eastern part of the region.
   Evidence from this study showed that compositional data transformations
   such as clr transformation could help to avoid artefacts, prior to
   statistical computations.},

Title = {Salivary microRNAs are potential biomarkers for the accurate and precise
   identification of inflammatory response after tail docking and
   castration in piglets},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {The present study aimed to investigate whether acute pain associated
   with castration and tail docking of male piglets may modulate the
   expression of salivary microRNAs (miRNAs) and to explore their potential
   use as biomarkers. Thirty-six healthy 4-d-old piglets (Hermitage x
   Duroc) were randomly assigned to three groups: the first group (12
   piglets) has been pretreated with anesthetic and anti-inflammatory drugs
   (ANA) and then castrated and tail docked; the second one (12 piglets)
   has been castrated and tail docked without any drugs (CONV); the third
   one (12 piglets) has been only handled (SHAM). Saliva was collected 10
   min before (control group) and 30 to 45 min after the procedures.
   Salivary cortisol has been quantified. The expression concentrations of
   seven miRNAs, namely miR-19b, miR-27b-3p, miR-215, miR-22-3p,
   miR-155-5p, hsa-miR-365-5p, and hsa-miR-204, were measured and assessed
   as potential biomarkers of pain by quantitative Polimerase Chain
   Reaction using TaqMan probes. The area under the receiver operating
   curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of miRNAs.
   The concentration of salivary cortisol increased after treatment in CONV
   and ANA, while no significant variation was observed in the SHAM group.
   The comparative analysis demonstrated that the concentrations of
   salivary miR-19b (P = 0.001), miR-27b (P = 0.042), and miR-365 (P <
   0.0001) were significantly greater in CONV as compared with
   pretreatment. The AUC of pretreatment vs. CONV and CONV vs. ANA were
   excellent for miR-19b and miR-365 and fair for miR-27b. Combining two
   miRNAs, namely miR-19b and miR-365, in a panel increased the efficiency
   of distinguishing between pre- and post-treatment groups. No differences
   have been identified between SHAM and ANA groups. mRNA potential targets
   of differentially expressed-miRNA were investigated, and genes related
   to pain and inflammation were identified: miR-19b potentially modulates
   TGF-beta and focal adhesion pathways, miR-365 regulates cytokines
   expression (i.e., IL-1, Tumor Necross Factor-alpha, and IL-8 cytokine),
   and miR-27b regulates macrophage inflammatory protein pathways (i.e.,
   MIP1-beta). In conclusion, we demonstrated that the abundance of
   miR-19b, miR-27b, and miR-365 increases in the saliva of piglets
   castrated and tail docked without the administration of pain-relieving
   drugs. Further studies are needed to assess their potential during
   routine husbandry procedures and to extend their assessment in other
   stressful events, such as weaning or chronic pain.},

Title = {The Implications of EU Regulation 2016/429 on Neglected Diseases of
   Small Ruminants including Contagious Agalactia with Particular Reference
   to Italy},
Journal = {ANIMALS},

Abstract = {Simple Summary This article explains the future application of the EU
   regulation Animal Health Law (Reg. CE 429/2016), which will be
   implemented in 2021. The article describes the major changes and
   modifications related to notifiable diseases of sheep and goats and
   outlines the approach that will be taken for their surveillance and
   control. It explains the objective of the European Commission in
   applying a modern animal health system based on risk assessment, updated
   scientific knowledge, epidemiology, and a new culture of European
   diseases prevention. Five categories of diseases are recognized.
   Category A diseases are not usually present in the EU, which must be
   immediately eradicated. Category B diseases must be controlled in member
   states and eventually eradicated while category C diseases are present
   in some MS, which must be prevented from spreading to disease-free
   states. Category D diseases only present moderate risk but necessitate
   measures such as movement control to prevent their spread among MS or
   their entry into the EU, and category E diseases need surveillance.
   Lastly, differences between the previous Italian regulations and the new
   EU law are highlighted.
   Abstract After almost 40 years, the 27 member states (MS) of the
   European Union (EU) will comply with the European Law 429/2016 in 2021
   by completing a process of unification and harmonization of all
   regulations related to animal health between MS. These new provisions
   are based on modern scientific principles on animal health, on long-term
   epidemiological data, and, above all, on the most current risk
   assessment and analysis. The paper describes all changes and updates,
   which will impact the Italian current National regulation. A total of 58
   animal diseases have been included in the Annex II ({''}Listing{''}) and
   Annex IV ({''}Categorization{''}) of the new Delegated Act (DA
   2018/1629). Five diseases comprising the great viral epizooties were
   automatically included on the list because of their primary importance.
   These diseases include foot and mouth disease (FMD), African swine fever
   (ASF), classical swine fever (CSF), highly pathogenic avian influenza
   (HPAI), and African horse sickness (AHS). Another 53 diseases have been
   identified by the ad hoc assessment on listing and categorization of
   animal diseases developed by the European Food Safety Association.
   Seventeen communicable diseases of the Order Artiodactlya (sheep, goats,
   deer, etc.) have been listed including foot and mouth disease, sheep and
   goat pox, and pestes de petits ruminants. In addition, other endemic
   diseases affecting more than one species include blue tongue,
   tuberculosis, brucellosis, and anthrax. There are five categories (A-E)
   based on the degree of action to be undertaken throughout the EU for
   each disease. These vary from complete eradication for diseases not
   normally found in the EU like FMD (category A) for establishing
   surveillance for diseases like West Nile that present high risk but lack
   control tools (category E).},

Abstract = {Free-ranging corvids-678 magpies (Pica pica) and 120 hooded crows
   (Corvus cornix) from nine protected areas of the Pisa province (central
   Italy)-were examined for Toxoplasma gondii and Trichinella
   pseudospiralis. The intracardiac blood clots from 651 magpies and 120
   hooded crows were serologically examined for T. gondii. The DNA
   extracted from the hearts of seropositive birds was then used to perform
   a nested PCR for the amplification of the T. gondii B1 gene and for
   genotyping for SAG genetic markers. Breast muscle samples from 678
   magpies and 91 hooded crows were tested by an artificial digestion
   method for Trichinella. Data were statistically analyzed. Forty-five
   (5.8\%-41 magpies and four hooded crows) out of the 771 examined animals
   scored seropositive for T. gondii, with titers ranging from 1:25 to
   1:100. T. gondii DNA was detected in 15 of the 45 positive birds and T.
   gondii genotypes II and III were identified. No positivity for T.
   pseudospiralis was found. No significant differences between the two
   species of corvids and among the different areas of origin were observed
   for seropositivity to T. gondii. This is the first extensive study on
   both T. gondii and T. pseudospiralis in magpies and hooded crows, as
   well as the first detection of T. gondii SAG genotypes in magpies.},

Title = {Effects of Feeding and Maturation System on Qualitative Characteristics
   of Buffalo Meat (Bubalus bubalis)},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Nowadays, consumers used to being properly informed when
   purchased animal products. They are influenced by some meat
   characteristics like colour and tenderness. Nutrition is an important
   strategy to influence these properties, together with post day ageing
   processes. In this regard, the inclusion of fresh forage during
   fattening period and a prolonged maturation time in a monitored
   refrigeration device as Maturmeat((R)), were assessed on 16 Italian
   Mediterranean buffalo bulls. Data regarding physical-chemical analyses,
   colour and texture on two muscles, the Semitendinosus and the
   Longissimus muscles, were recorded during two maturation times (30 and
   60 days). The combined used of fresh forage inclusion and post dry
   ageing processes influenced in a different way the two considered
   muscles, suggesting that different muscles could have different
   properties. Moreover, meat colour changed in both muscles in animals fed
   green forage and maturated in Maturmeat((R)) while no significant change
   was observed in the control group. In conclusion, the use of this
   monitored post dry ageing system could influence the saleable yield and
   productivity of buffalo meat and allow the creation of ready-to-eat
   food, produced starting from raw ground meat, that is very requested by
   the consumers.
   Abstract We aimed to evaluate the effects of post dry ageing (PDA)
   period on meat colour and rheological characteristics in 16 buffalo
   bulls fed two different diets: with (FRS) or without (CTL) rye grass.
   Animals were randomly divided into two feeding groups and slaughtered at
   540 +/- 4.7 and 533 +/- 7.0 kg of live body weight, respectively, for
   the CTL and FRS group. After five days post-mortem ageing (T0),
   Semitendinosus muscle (ST) and Longissimus muscle (LD) underwent a
   prolonged maturation process in a controlled meat chamber for 30 days
   (ST) and until 60 days (LD). After 30 days (T1), significant changes (p
   < 0.01) in meat colour (Delta E) in both muscles of the FRS group was
   recorded, while no significant change was observed in CTL group. The FRS
   diet had a positive effect on textural properties of ST muscle compared
   to CTL diet, as well as hardness, chewiness and gumminess. All
   qualitative characteristics improved in the first period of PDA but,
   whereas LD showed to keep improving, extending the post-ageing period by
   further 30 days, the ST becomes un-processable at 60 days. In
   conclusion, a combined used of fresh feeding and PDA period could
   enhance both tenderness and colour in animal fed FSR.},

Abstract = {This study describes an Aujeszky's disease case in an adult male red fox
   found in an urban area in Central Italy, that exhibited a fatal
   infection with neurological lesions, but neither itching nor skin
   lesions.
   Diagnostic examinations included histology, and parasitological,
   bacteriological and virological analyses. Detection of parasitic enteric
   pathogens, bacteria, E. coli, Leptospira spp., rabies, canine distemper
   virus, par-vovirus, hepatitis E virus and pseudorabies virus (PrV) was
   performed. Results showed the presence of a gE-deleted PrVthat was
   closely related to the NIA-3 strain but differed from the PrV strains
   currently circulating in wild boars and domestic pigs in Italy.
   All the results led to the conclusion that the fox suffered from
   Aujeszky's disease caused by a gE-deleted PrV strain closely related to
   a vaccine strain. The epidemiological link between the PrV vaccine
   strain and fox infection remains unclear. It could involve vaccinated
   pigs as a primary source of infection by direct or indirect contact with
   the red fox or less likely it could be related to improper use of the
   vaccine in the fox.},

Title = {Estimating fatty acid content and related nutritional indexes in ewe
   milk using different near infrared instruments},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FOOD COMPOSITION AND ANALYSIS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {88},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The ability of near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to predict the milk
   fatty acids (FA) composition, groups of fats and nutritional-related
   ratios and indexes in sheep milk was evaluated using different near
   infrared (NIR) instruments. Detailed FA composition of 101 individual
   milk samples was analyzed by gas chromatography. Predictive equations
   were developed for oven-dried milk samples using modified partial least
   squares (PLS) regression method for reflectance spectra (400-2500 nm)
   and using PLS for transmittance (850-1050 nm) and Fourier transform near
   infrared (FT-NIR) reflectance (1000-2500 nm) spectra. Coefficient of
   determination of cross validation (R-CV(2)) and residual predictive
   deviation (RPD) were excellent for C4:0, SFA and PUFA (R-CV(2) above
   0.9; RPD above 3). Good predictive results (R-CV(2) 0.80-0.90; RPD
   2.9-2.0) were obtained with the reflectance spectra for C18:1n7t,
   C18:2n6c, C18:2 9c11t, C18:3n3 C22:5n3, MUFA, SCFA, LCFA, total C18:1,
   CLA, n-3, n-6, n-6/n-3 ratio, and the desirable FA, atherogenicity,
   thrombogenicity and peroxidability indexes. Less accurate results were
   obtained for C8:0, C12:0, C14:0, C18:2n6t, and
   hypocholesterolaemic/hypercholesterolaemic ratio. The FT-NIR instrument
   provided comparable results. On the other hand, only the butyric acid
   model can be considered satisfactory (R-CV(2) = 0.74; RPD= 1.96) with
   the dispersive transmittance spectra.},

Title = {Effect of dietary supplementation with yeast cell wall extracts on
   performance and gut response in broiler chickens},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},

Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Background The dietary supplementation of yeast cell wall extracts (YCW)
   has been found to reduce pathogenic bacteria load, promote
   immunoglobulin production, prevent diseases by pro-inflammatory
   responses, and alter gut microbiota composition. This study evaluated
   growth and slaughter results, health, gut morphology, immune status and
   gut transcriptome of 576 male chickens fed two diets, i.e. C (control)
   or Y (with 250-500 g/t of YCW fractions according to the growth period).
   At 21 and 42 d the jejunum of 12 chickens per diet were sampled and
   stained with hematoxylin/eosin for morphometric evaluation, with
   Alcian-PAS for goblet cells, and antibodies against CD3+ intraepithelial
   T-cells and CD45+ intraepithelial leukocytes. The jejunum sampled at 42
   d were also used for whole-transcriptome profiling. Results Dietary YCW
   supplementation did not affect final live weight, whereas it decreased
   feed intake (114 to 111 g/d; P <= 0.10) and improved feed conversion
   (1.74 to 1.70; P <= 0.01). Regarding the gut, YCW supplementation tended
   to increase villi height (P = 0.07); it also increased the number of
   goblet cells and reduced the density of CD45+ cells compared to diet C
   (P < 0.001). In the gut transcriptome, four genes were expressed more in
   broilers fed diet Y compared to diet C, i.e. cytochrome P450, family 2,
   subfamily C, polypeptide 23b (CYP2C23B), tetratricopeptide repeat domain
   9 (TTC9), basic helix-loop-helix family member e41 (BHLHE41), and the
   metalloreductase STEAP4. Only one gene set (HES\_PATHWAY) was
   significantly enriched among the transcripts more expressed in broilers
   fed diet Y. However, a total of 41 gene sets were significantly
   over-represented among genes up-regulated in control broilers. Notably,
   several enriched gene sets are implicated in immune functions and
   related to NF-kappa B signaling, apoptosis, and interferon signals.
   Conclusions The dietary YCW supplementation improved broiler growth
   performance, increased gut glycoconjugate secretion and reduced the
   inflammatory status together with differences in the gut transcriptome,
   which can be considered useful to improve animal welfare and health
   under the challenging conditions of intensive rearing systems in broiler
   chickens.},

   Circulating in Sardinian Ovine Flocks},
Journal = {PATHOGENS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {Border Disease (BD) is a worldwide distributed pathology accountable for
   significant losses in the sheep and goat farming industry. The
   etiological agent is a Pestivirus within the family Flaviviridae called
   border disease virus (BDV). Despite the Sardinian ovine population being
   by far larger than any other Italian region, the prevalence and
   distribution of BD on the island are unknown. Here, we aim to determine
   the distribution of BDV in sheep flocks and to genetically characterize
   the circulating strains in Sardinia. The geographical distribution,
   antibody positivity, and viral genome presence have been analysed for
   1286 sheep flocks distributed all over the island from bulk tank milk
   sampled between May 2014 and 2015. Of the flocks tested, 11.28\% (95\%
   CI 9.66-13.12) resulted positive for the presence of anti-pestivirus
   antibodies with an uneven distribution between Sardinian provinces. In
   addition, using RT-PCR, nine BDV genomes were amplified from milk
   pellets of the seropositive samples. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that
   all the viruses amplified clustered in the same group classified as
   BDV-7. This represents the first study on the distribution of pestivirus
   infection and genetic characterization of BDV strains circulating in the
   Sardinian sheep population. Future studies are needed to clarify the
   origin, the evolution, and the epidemiology of BDV-7 in Sardinia.},

Title = {Modulation of Type I Interferon System by African Swine Fever Virus},
Journal = {PATHOGENS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) has tropism for macrophages, which
   seems to play a crucial role in disease pathogenesis and viral
   dissemination. Previous studies showed that ASFV developed mechanisms to
   evade type I interferon (IFN) responses. Hence, we analyzed the ability
   of ASFV strains of diverse virulence to modulate IFN-beta and IFN-alpha
   responses. Porcine monocyte-derived macrophages un-activated (moM Phi)
   or activated with IFN-alpha (moM Phi + FN-alpha) were infected with
   virulent (22653/14) or attenuated (NH/P68) ASFV strains, and expressions
   of IFN-beta and of 17 IFN-alpha subtypes genes were monitored over time.
   ASFV strains of diverse virulence induced different panels of IFN genes:
   infection of moM Phi with either strains caused statistically
   significant up-regulation of IFN-alpha 3, -alpha 7/11, whereas only
   attenuated NH/P68 determined statistically significant up-regulation of
   IFN-alpha 10, -alpha 12, -alpha 13, -alpha 15, -alpha 17, and IFN-beta.
   Infection of activated moM Phi with either strains resulted in
   up-regulation of IFN-beta and many IFN-alpha subtypes, but statistical
   significance was found only for IFN-alpha 1, -alpha 10, -alpha 15,
   -alpha 16, -alpha 17 in response to NH/P68-infection only. These data
   revealed differences in type I IFNs expression patterns, with
   differences between strains of diverse virulence. In addition, virulent
   22653/14 ASFV seems to have developed mechanisms to suppress the
   induction of several type I IFN genes.},

Title = {Lesser mealworm (Alphitobius diaperinus) powder as a novel baking
   ingredient for manufacturing high-protein, mineral-dense snacks},
Journal = {FOOD RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {131},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Increasing interest in consuming foods that are high in protein,
   vitamin, amino acid, and mineral contents is steering growth in the
   market for fortified snacks. The aim of the present study was to
   evaluate the use of lesser mealworm (Alphitobius diaperinus) powder (LP)
   (at 10 or 30\% substitution for wheat flour) for the protein and mineral
   fortification of crunchy snacks (rusks). Hence, the technological,
   microbiological, nutritional, and sensory characteristics of the
   fortified rusks were evaluated. The protein content was enriched up to
   99.3\% in rusks with 30\% substitution; moreover, a notable increase in
   the essential amino acids content was observed, with histidine
   fortification reaching up to 129.1\% in rusks with 30\% substitution.
   The incorporation of LP has led to an enrichment of almost all the
   minerals considered here, and especially Fe, P and Zn, with Zn showing
   fortification percentages of up to 300\% in rusks with 30\% substitution
   for LP. The experimental rusks showed pleasant sensory traits and low aw
   values. In view of the potential industrial manufacturing of
   insect-based rusks, the proposed product can be assigned to level 4
   (validation in a laboratory environment) of the Technology Readiness
   Level (TRL) scale, and it is thus ready to be tested in a simulated
   production environment.},

Abstract = {Plasma and tissue from breast cancer patients are valuable for
   diagnostic/prognostic purposes and are accessible by multiple mass
   spectrometry (MS) tools. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)
   and ambient mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) were shown to be robust and
   reproducible technologies for breast cancer diagnosis. Here, we
   investigated whether there is a correspondence between lipid cancer
   features observed by desorption electrospray ionization (DESI)-MSI in
   tissue and those detected by LC-MS in plasma samples. The study included
   28 tissues and 20 plasma samples from 24 women with ductal breast
   carcinomas of both special and no special type (NST) along with 22
   plasma samples from healthy women. The comparison of plasma and tissue
   lipid signatures revealed that each one of the studied matrices (i.e.,
   blood or tumor) has its own specific molecular signature and the full
   interposition of their discriminant ions is not possible. This
   comparison also revealed that the molecular indicators of tissue injury,
   characteristic of the breast cancer tissue profile obtained by DESI-MSI,
   do not persist as cancer discriminators in peripheral blood even though
   some of them could be found in plasma samples.},

Abstract = {The protein aggregation mechanism in UHT milk samples stored at ambient
   temperature for 1, 3 and 5 months was assessed in this study. Three
   phases of the UHT milks were studied: supernatants, dispersed phase and
   sediments. The supernatants showed a great variability, suggesting the
   presence of a dynamic arrangement within the protein system of UHT milk,
   which moves towards the formation of the sediment. The application of
   2D-electrophoresis (AU-PAGE(NR)-SDS-PAGE(R)) and mass spectrometry
   analyses were carried out to study the main heat-induced supramolecular
   protein aggregates. These aggregates were found mainly in the
   supernatant and their composition changed along the storage, as a
   consequence of the medium chemical changes, which are temperature- and
   pH-depended, whereas the composition of the dispersed phase and sediment
   denoted a hierarchical mechanism of assembling.},

Abstract = {Lumpy skin disease is a high-consequence disease in cattle caused by
   infection with the poxvirus lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV). The virus
   is endemic in most countries in Africa and an emerging threat to cattle
   populations in Europe and Asia. As LSDV spreads into new regions, it is
   important that signs of disease are recognized promptly by animal
   caregivers. This study describes the gross, microscopic, and
   ultrastructural changes that occur over time in cattle experimentally
   challenged with LSDV. Four calves were inoculated with wildtype LSDV and
   monitored for 19 to 21 days. At 7 days after inoculation, 2 of the 4
   cattle developed multifocal cutaneous nodules characteristic of LSD.
   Some lesions displayed a targetoid appearance. Histologically,
   intercellular and intracellular edema was present in the epidermis of
   some nodules. Occasional intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies were
   identified in keratinocytes. More severe and consistent changes were
   present in the dermis, with marked histiocytic inflammation and
   necrotizing fibrinoid vasculitis of dermal vessels, particularly the
   deep dermal plexus. Chronic lesions consisted of full-thickness necrosis
   of the dermis and epidermis. Lesions in other body organs were not a
   major feature of LSD in this study, highlighting the strong cutaneous
   tropism of this virus. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy
   identified LSDV-infected histiocytes and fibroblasts in the skin nodules
   of affected cattle. This study highlights the noteworthy lesions of LSDV
   and how they develop over time.},

Title = {Feline Leishmania spp. Infection in a Non-Endemic Area of Northern Italy},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Leishmaniosis caused by Leishmania infantum is a
   parasitic disease of people and animals transmitted by sand fly vectors.
   Although dogs in south and central Italy are most affected, in recent
   decades feline leishmaniosis (FeL) has become an emerging disease. This
   study aimed to update information on the presence of FeL in stray cats
   in Milan, in northern Italy; to compare these results with previous
   studies performed in the same area; and to report aspects of Leishmania
   infection in cats. A total of 117 stray cats were included and 10
   (8.6\%) had L. infantum infection. The parasite was identified in
   popliteal lymph nodes in five cats and five had antibodies against L.
   infantum. Most infected cats were from a specific area of Milan.
   Increased gammaglobulins were seen in infected cats, which also had
   antibodies against the pathogens Anaplasma phagocytophilum,
   Chlamydophila felis, and Toxoplasma gondii. There was a high prevalence
   of FeL in the surveyed area of northern Italy. Further studies are
   needed to understand if these infected cats are being imported from
   other areas, or if there is a real Leishmania focus in Milan.
   Investigation of the presence of sand fly vectors in Milan would be
   useful.
   Abstract Feline leishmaniosis (FeL) is an emerging vector-borne feline
   disease, with increasing numbers of cases reported and studies performed
   internationally. This study aimed to update the epidemiological status
   for FeL in stray cats in Milan, northern Italy; compare these results
   with previous studies in Northern Italy; and report clinicopathologic
   findings and coinfections in cats infected with Leishmania spp. A total
   of 117 cats were tested for L. infantum and retrovirus infection,
   hematological, and biochemical parameters. Demographic and clinical data
   were collected and FeL affected cats screened for selected coinfections.
   Overall, 10/117 (8.6\%) cats tested positive for L. infantum: in five
   cats L. infantum DNA was found in popliteal lymph nodes and five were
   IFAT seropositive at titers from 1:80 to 1:160. Infected cats were
   concentrated in a specific area of Milan (p = 0.0154). No specific
   clinicopathologic abnormalities or retroviral infections were
   significantly linked to the infection, other than hypergammaglobulinemia
   (p = 0.0127). Seroreactivity to Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Chlamydophila
   felis, and Toxoplasma gondii was found in some infected cats. A high
   prevalence of FeL was found in a non-endemic area of northern Italy and
   future studies should continually monitor this data to understand
   whether these cases are imported or if Leishmania vectors are present in
   this area.},

Title = {Detection of Astrovirus in a Cow with Neurological Signs by Nanopore
   Technology, Italy},
Journal = {VIRUSES-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In this study, starting from nucleic acids purified from the brain
   tissue, Nanopore technology was used to identify the etiological agent
   of severe neurological signs observed in a cow which was immediately
   slaughtered. Histological examination revealed acute non-suppurative
   encephalomyelitis affecting the brainstem, cerebrum, cerebellum, and
   medulla oblongata, while by using PCR-based assays, the nucleic acids of
   major agents for neurological signs were not detected. By using Nanopore
   technology, 151 sequence reads were assigned to Bovine Astrovirus
   (BoAstV). Real-time RT-PCR and in situ hybridization (ISH) confirmed the
   presence of viral RNA in the brain. Moreover, using the combination of
   fluorescent ISH and immunofluorescence (IF) techniques, it was possible
   to detect BoAstV RNA and antigens in the same cells, suggesting the
   active replication of the virus in infected neurons. The nearly whole
   genome of the occurring strain (BoAstV PE3373/2019/Italy), obtained by
   Illumina NextSeq 500, showed the highest nucleotide sequence identity
   (94.11\%) with BoAstV CH13/NeuroS1 26,730 strain, an
   encephalitis-associated bovine astrovirus. Here, we provide further
   evidence of the role of AstV as a neurotropic agent. Considering that in
   a high proportion of non-suppurative encephalitis cases, which are
   mostly indicative of a viral infection, the etiologic agent remains
   unknown, our result underscores the value and versatility of Nanopore
   technology for a rapid diagnosis when the PCR-based algorithm gives
   negative results.},

Title = {Epitheliotropic Infections in Wildlife Ruminants From the Central Alps
   and Stelvio National Park},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {APR 30},
Abstract = {The mountain chain of the Alps, represents the habitat of alpine fauna
   where the red deer (Cervus elaphus) population is the outmost numerous,
   followed by the chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) and the alpine ibex (Capra
   ibex) at higher altitudes. Previous reports showed the circulation of
   epitheliotropic viruses, belonging to the families Papillomaviridae and
   Poxviridae, causing skin and mucosal lesions in wild ruminants of the
   Stelvio National Park, situated in the area. To deepen our knowledge on
   the natural dynamics of the infections, a passive surveillance on all
   the cases of proliferative skin and mucosal lesions in wild ruminants
   was performed. Twenty-seven samples (11 chamois, 10 red deer and 6 ibex)
   collected from 2008 to 2018 were analyzed by negative staining electron
   microscopy, histology, and PCR followed by genome sequencing and
   phylogenetic analyses. Results confirmed the spread of Parapoxvirus of
   Red Deer in New Zealand (PVNZ) in Italy, and its ability to cause severe
   lesions i.e., erosions and ulcers in the mouth. We showed for the first
   time a PVNZ/CePV1v (C. elaphus papillomavirus 1 variant) co-infection
   identified in one red deer. This result supports previous evidence on
   the ability of papillomavirus and parapoxvirus to mutually infect the
   same host tissue. Interestingly two ibex and one chamois showing orf
   virus (OV) skin lesions were shown to be co-infected with bovine
   papillomavirus type 1 and 2. The presence of bovine papillomavirus, in
   orf virus induced lesions of chamois and ibex raises the question of its
   pathogenetic role in these animal species. For the first time, OV/CePV1v
   co-infection was demonstrated in another chamois. CePV1v is sporadically
   reported in red deer throughout Europe and is considered species
   specific, its identification in a chamois suggests its ability of
   cross-infecting different animal species. Poxviruses and papillomavirus
   have been simultaneously detected also in the skin lesions of cattle,
   bird and human suggesting a possible advantageous interaction between
   these viruses. Taken together, our findings add further information on
   the epidemiology and pathogenetic role of epitheliotropic viruses in
   wild ruminants living in the central Alps and in Stelvio National Park.},

Title = {Phylodynamic analysis and evaluation of the balance between anthropic

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Abstract = {Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) control is mainly based on wide
   vaccine administration. Although effective, its efficacy is not
   absolute, the viral circulation is not prevented and some side effects
   cannot be denied. Despite this, the determinants of IBV epidemiology and
   the factors affecting its circulation are still largely unknown and
   poorly investigated. In the present study, 361 IBV QX (the most relevant
   field genotype in Italy) sequences were obtained between 2012 and 2016
   from the two main Italian integrated poultry companies. Several
   biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches were used to reconstruct
   the history of the QX genotype in Italy and to assess the effect of
   different environmental, climatic and social factors on its spreading
   patterns. Moreover, two structured coalescent models were considered in
   order to investigate if an actual compartmentalization occurs between
   the two integrated poultry companies and the role of a third ``ghost{''}
   deme, representative of minor industrial poultry companies and the rural
   sector. The obtained results suggest that the integration of the poultry
   companies is an effective barrier against IBV spreading, since the
   strains sampled from the two companies formed two
   essentially-independent clades. Remarkably, the only exceptions were
   represented by farms located in the high densely populated poultry area
   of Northern Italy. The inclusion of a third deme in the model revealed
   the likely role of other poultry companies and rural farms (particularly
   concentrated in Northern Italy) as sources of strain introduction into
   one of the major poultry companies, whose farms are mainly located in
   the high densely populated poultry area of Northern Italy. Accordingly,
   when the effect of different environmental and urban parameters on IBV
   geographic spreading was investigated, no factor seems to contribute to
   IBV dispersal velocity, being poultry population density the only
   exception. Finally, the different viral population pattern observed in
   the two companies over the same time period supports the pivotal role of
   management and control strategies on IBV epidemiology. Overall, the
   present study results stress the crucial relevance of human action
   rather than environmental factors, highlighting the direct benefits that
   could derive from improved management and organization of the poultry
   sector on a larger scale.},

Abstract = {Cat scratch disease (CSD) is a zoonotic disease, caused predominantly by
   Bartonella henselae and transmitted to humans through a scratch or bite
   of the cat. Cat represents the principal reservoir and healthy carrier
   of Bartonella, which is mainly transmitted, among cats, by the flea
   Ctenocephalides fells. During 2014, fifty-two samples of whole blood and
   sera were collected randomly from cats in Abruzzo region and were
   examined by real-time PCR and IFAT tests, respectively. Seven samples
   out of fifty-two (13.5\%) resulted positive for Bartonella spp. in both
   tests, while six specimens (11.5\%) resulted real-time PCR negative but
   IgG positive; thirty-nine were instead both real-time PCR and IFAT
   negative (75\%). Sequence analysis of a fragment of DNA identified B.
   henselae and B. clarridgeiae in four and in two real-time PCR positive
   samples, respectively.},

Abstract = {Blood parameters in fish provide a rich source of information about
   metabolites, blood cells and biochemical markers that reflect individual
   differences in health, disease, diet and habitat. Haematological and
   biochemical parameters were investigated in 80 cultured striped bass
   Morone saxatilis, in order to evaluate a possible correlation between
   biometric indices (weight and total length) and blood parameters in this
   species of fish. For this purpose, blood samples were collected from
   each fish to evaluate the haematological profile (white blood cells,
   WBC; red blood cell, RBC; haemoglobin concentration, Hb; haematocrit,
   Hct; mean corpuscular volume, MCV; mean corpuscular haemoglobin, MCH;
   mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, MCHC; thrombocytes, TC), and
   some biochemical parameters (glucose, GLU; serum total protein, TP;
   total cholesterol, CHOL and triglycerides, TRIG). The obtained results
   showed a statistically significant positive relationship between the
   weight of fish and RBC and TRIG. All the other studied parameters showed
   no correlation with the biometric indices. This study evaluates the
   possible correlation between biometric indices (weight and total length)
   and blood parameters, representing a valid contribution to the knowledge
   of the blood parameters of Striped bass and could be used as reference
   for a comparison in further studies to evaluate the health status of
   this species of fish in different cultured system, because assessment of
   these parameters may be used as quick tool for health status, stress and
   poor aquaculture management.},

Abstract = {A research was carried out in Italy with the aim of assessing
   Campylobacter contamination in broilers from breeding to slaughter, of
   defining the genetic diversity of isolates and their antibiotic
   resistance. Sampling was carried out in a slaughterhouse, and in farms
   representative of the most common broiler production in Italy. At farm,
   the 78.8\% (95\% C.I.: 74.5\%-82.5\%) of cloacal samples tested positive
   for Campylobacter spp. C. jejuni showed higher prevalence in winter than
   in spring and summer (p < 0.00001, chi(2) = 32.9), while C. coli showed
   an opposite trend (p < 0.00001, chi(2)= 41.1). At slaughterhouse, the
   32.3\% (95\% C.I.: 30.2\%-35.2\%) and the 23.9\% (95\% C.I.:
   21.7\%-26.3\%) of skin samples tested positive for C. jejuni for C.
   coli, respectively. C. coli showed higher prevalence than C. jejuni at
   washing (p < 0.05, chi(2) = 11.11) and at chilling (p < 0.05, chi(2) =
   9.26). PFGE revealed high heterogeneity among isolates. Some clones were
   identified within the same farm in more than one season, suggesting
   environmental conditions able to support their persistence; other clones
   resulted to be spatially distant, suggestive of cross-contamination.
   Both Campylobacter species showed high resistance to nalidixic acid and
   ciprofloxacin, while resistance to erythromycin was more frequent in C.
   coli than C. jejuni (p < 0.05; chi(2) test).},

Abstract = {December 2019 saw a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from China quickly
   spread globally. Currently, COVID-19, defined as the new pandemic by the
   World Health Organization (WHO), has reached over 750,000 confirmed
   cases worldwide. The virus began to spread in Italy from the 22nd
   February, and the number of related cases is still increasing.
   Furthermore, given that a relevant proportion of infected people need
   hospitalization in Intensive Care Units, this may be a crucial issue for
   National Healthcare System's capacity. WHO underlines the importance of
   specific disease regional estimates. Because of this, Italy aimed to put
   in place proportioned and controlled measures, and to guarantee adequate
   funding to both increase the number of ICU beds and increase production
   of personal protective equipment. Our aim is to investigate the current
   COVID-19 epidemiological context in Sardinia region (Italy) and to
   estimate the transmission parameters using a stochastic model to
   establish the number of infected, recovered, and deceased people
   expected. Based on available data from official Italian and regional
   sources, we describe the distribution of infected cases during the
   period between 2nd and 15th March 2020. To better reflect the actual
   spread of COVID-19 in Sardinia based on data from 15th March (first
   Sardinian declared outbreak), two Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Dead
   (SIRD) models have been developed, describing the best and worst
   scenarios. We believe that our findings represent a valid contribution
   to better understand the epidemiological context of COVID-19 in
   Sardinia. Our analysis can help health authorities and policymakers to
   address the right interventions to deal with the rapidly expanding
   health emergency.},

Abstract = {Periodic epidemics of black rot disease occur worldwide causing
   substantial yield losses. Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc)
   represents one of the most common bacteria able to cause the above
   disease in cruciferous plants such as broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower,
   and Arabidopsis thaliana. In agriculture, several strategies are being
   developed to contain the Xanthomonas infection. The use of
   bacteriophages could represent a valid and efficient approach to
   overcome this widespread phenomenon. Several studies have highlighted
   the potential usefulness of implementing phage therapy to control plant
   diseases as well as Xcc infection. In the present study, we
   characterized the effect of a lytic phage on the plant Brassica oleracea
   var. gongylodes infected with Xcc and, for the first time, the
   correlated plant metabolic response. The results highlighted the
   potential benefits of bacteriophages: reduction of bacterium
   proliferation, alteration of the biofilm structure and/or modulation of
   the plant metabolism and defense response.},

Abstract = {Scrapie is an ovine transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, and its
   susceptibility is associated with polymorphisms in the prion protein
   gene (PRNP). Genetic selection is currently the most effective mean for
   eradication of the susceptible VRQ allele in favour of resistant ARR
   allele. Maintenance of genetic diversity should be one of the major
   objectives in breeding programmes, especially in endangered breeds, and
   genetic information are an excellent alternative to pedigree data where
   these information are missing. The aim of our study was to determine
   changes of genetic variability in six native sheep breeds from
   autonomous province of Bolzano, northern Italy, following simulation of
   scrapie selection scenarios. A total of 684 rams were investigated for
   PRNP polymorphisms and for 10 microsatellite loci to estimate genetic
   variability. Across all loci, a total of 163 alleles were detected with
   a mean of 10.4 alleles per locus. Average observed (Ho) and unbiased
   expected (uHe) heterozygosity overall loci were 0.74 and 0.78,
   respectively, showing a statistically significant deviation from
   Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in all breeds. This heterozygosity
   deficit was confirmed by a positive fixation index (Fis), determining a
   moderate inbreeding in each breed. Simulating a soft selection, where
   only rams having at least a VRQ allele should be excluded from
   reproduction, Ho, uHe and Fis values remained almost unchanged,
   indicating that genetic variability should not be affected by the
   removal of these individuals. With a mild selection scenario,
   considering only rams with at least one ARR allele, we observed a
   decrease in the mean alleles per breed (8.9) and the maintenance of
   heterozygosity deficiency, except for two breeds, where it was any
   longer significant. These results showed that selection strategies
   allowing use of heterozygous as well homozygous ARR rams might be the
   right compromise to improve resistance to scrapie and to do not
   dramatically affect genetic variability of these breeds.},

Title = {Enhancing Preparedness for Arbovirus Infections with a One Health
   Approach: The Development and Implementation of Multisectoral Risk
   Assessment Exercises},
Journal = {BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {APR 21},
Abstract = {Background. One Health is receiving attention for arbovirus infection
   prevention and control and for defining national ``intersectoral{''}
   priorities. Increasing awareness of intersectoral priorities through
   multisectorial risk assessments (MRA) is promising, where data are not
   systematically shared between sectors. Towards this aim, the
   MediLabSecure project organized three MRA exercises (hereby called
   exercises): one on West Nile virus, one on Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic
   fever, and one on Rift Valley fever, assessing the added value of this
   approach. Methods. The exercises relied on RA methodologies of
   international organisations. Country representatives of the human and
   animal virology, medical entomology, and public health sectors (hereby
   called ``sectors{''}) involved in the surveillance of vector-borne
   diseases participated in the exercises. Background documentation was
   provided before each exercise, and a guide was developed for the
   facilitators. All three exercises included technical and methodological
   presentations and a guided RA directed at bringing into play the
   different sectors involved. To assess the added value of the approach,
   each participant was asked to rank the level of perceived benefit of the
   multisectoral collaboration for each ``risk question{''} included in the
   exercises. Results. In total, 195 participants from 19 non-EU countries
   in the Mediterranean and Black Sea regions took part in the exercises.
   The participants assessed the multisectoral approach as valuable in
   analysing comprehensively the situation by having access to information
   and knowledge provided by each of the sectors involved. Sharing of
   information and discussion facilitated reaching a consensus on the level
   of risk in each country. Conclusions. Increasing awareness of
   intersectoral priorities, including cross-border ones, through MRA is
   relevant to reduce gaps due to unavailability of shared data and
   information. Given that six out of the ten threats to global health
   listed by WHO are occurring at the human-animal-environmental
   interfaces, comprehensive regional RA with a One Health approach made by
   national authorities can be a relevant added value for the global health
   security.},

Month = {APR 21},
Abstract = {BackgroundFeline vector-borne pathogens (FeVBPs) have been increasingly
   investigated for their impact on cat health and their zoonotic
   potential. The aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence of
   FeVBPs and haemoplasmas in cats across Italy and to identify potential
   risk factors linked to their occurrence.MethodsBlood samples from 958
   owned cats living in the North (n=556), Centre (n=173) and South (n=229)
   of Italy were tested for Babesia spp., Hepatozoon spp., Ehrlichia spp.,
   Anaplasma spp. and filarioids by conventional PCR (cPCR) and for
   haemoplasmas and Bartonella spp. by SYBR green real-time PCR. Cats
   included in the study represent a sub-sample from a larger number of
   animals enrolled in a previous study, which were selected based on the
   geographical origin. Data on cats' positivity for Leishmania infantum,
   feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) and for feline immunodeficiency virus
   (FIV), available from the previous study, were included and examined.
   Potential risk factors for pathogen infection were assessed in
   relationship to categorical variables including sex, geographical
   origin, breed, neutering status and age of cats.ResultsOut of the 958
   cats, 194 (20.2\%) were positive for at least one of the tested
   pathogens, 89 (16\%) from the North, 32 (18.5\%) from the Centre and 73
   (31.9\%) from the South of Italy. A high prevalence of FeVBPs was
   detected in male cats (n=125, 27.8\%), living in the southern part of
   the country (n=73, 31.9\%), younger than 18 months of age (n=24, 22.4\%)
   and not neutered (n=39; 27.5\%). In particular, 24 cats (2.5\%) tested
   PCR-positive for Bartonella spp., of which 1.6\% for B. henselae and
   0.9\% for B. clarridgeiae. A total of 111 cats scored PCR-positive for
   haemoplasmas (11.6\%), specifically ``Candidatus Mycoplasma
   haemominutum{''} (n=95, 9.9\%), M. haemofelis (n=14, 1.5\%) and
   ``Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis{''} (n=2, 0.2\%). Moreover, 39, 31
   and 8 cats were positive for FeLV (4.1\%), L. infantum (3.2\%) and FIV
   (0.8\%), respectively. Co-infections were registered for 19 (9.8\%)
   cats.ConclusionsThese results confirm the occurrence of haemoplasmas and
   FeVBPs throughout Italy. Preventive measures to protect both animal and
   human health should be carried out also for owned cats, even if no
   health status of animals has been assessed in this study.},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe ability of tick-borne agents to survive in stored blood
   bags is a key factor for their transmissibility by blood transfusion.
   The aim of this study was to evaluate the survival and potential
   infectivity of Rickettsia conorii (RC) in artificially contaminated
   canine whole blood (WB) and in leukoreduced whole blood (LR-WB) during
   the storage period.MethodsRC was cultured on L929 cells. We used a
   one-week 25-cm(2) flask with 70-80\% of L929 infected cells to prepare
   the bacterial inoculum by pelleting cells and suspending the pellet in
   the donors' serum. We infected five 100 ml WB units with RC within 2 h
   from the collection and maintained it at room temperature for 4 h prior
   to refrigeration. We filtered 50 ml of each WB bag to obtain
   leukoreduced WB (LR-WB) at day 1 post-infection (dpi). We checked WB and
   LR-WB bags at 1, 4, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 dpi for RC presence and viability
   through real-time PCR (rPCR) for DNA and mRNA, respectively, and by
   isolation. Identification of isolates was confirmed by indirect
   immunofluorescence and rPCRs.ResultsRC survived for the entire storage
   period in both whole and leukoreduced blood. All bags contained viable
   bacteria until 7 dpi; RC viability generally decreased over time,
   particularly in LR-WB bags where the isolation time was longer than in
   WB. Viable bacteria were still isolated at 35 dpi in 3 WB and 3
   LR-WB.ConclusionsLeukoreduction reduced but did not eliminate RC in
   infected units. The survival and infectivity of RC in canine blood
   during the storage period may represent a threat for recipients.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {APR 21},
Abstract = {Bluetongue (BT) is a major Office International des Epizooties
   (OIE)-listed disease of wild and domestic ruminants caused by several
   serotypes of Bluetongue virus (BTV), a virus with a segmented dsRNA
   genome belonging to the family Reoviridae, genus Orbivirus. BTV is
   transmitted through the bites of Culicoides midges. The aim of this
   study was to develop a new method for quantification of BTV Seg-10 by
   droplet digital RT-PCR (RTdd-PCR), using nucleic acids purified from
   complex matrices such as blood, tissues, and midges, that notoriously
   contain strong PCR inhibitors. First, RTdd-PCR was optimized by using
   RNAs purified from serially 10-fold dilutions of a BTV-1 isolate
   (10(5.43)TCID(50)/ml up to 10(-0.57) TCID50/ml) and from the same
   dilutions spiked into fresh ovine EDTA-blood and spleen homogenate. The
   method showed a good degree of linearity (R-2 >= 0.995). The limit of
   detection (LoD) and the limit of quantification (LoQ) established were
   10(-0.67)TCID(50)/ml (0.72 copies/mu l) and 10(0.03)TCID(50)/ml (3.05
   copies/mu l) of BTV-1, respectively. Second, the newly developed test
   was compared, using the same set of biological samples, to the
   quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) detecting Seg-10 assay widely used for the
   molecular diagnosis of BTV from field samples. Results showed a
   difference mean of 0.30 log between the two assays with these samples (p
   < 0.05). Anyway, the analysis of correlation demonstrated that both
   assays provided similar measurements with a very close agreement between
   the systems.},

Abstract = {Antimicrobial consumption in veterinary medicine has led to the spread
   of multi drug-resistance in clinically important bacteria, with the
   companion animals and their environment involved as emerging reservoirs.
   While CTX-M-15 and CMY-2 acquired beta-lactamases have been widely
   detected in the bacterial population of companion and breeding animals
   in European area, DHA-1 enzymes have been rarely reported in veterinary
   medicine. The aim of the study was to characterize the Escherichia coli
   associated with mortality of a litter of Bulldog puppies in a breeding
   kennel located in Pesaro area, Central Italy. The E. coli strains O39
   serotype were resistant to 3rd/4th generation cephalosporins,
   chloramphenicol, aminoglycosides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and
   ciprofloxacin, retaining susceptibility to carbapenems, colistin,
   fosfomycin, and levofloxacin (by Microscan Autoscan4, EUCAST clinical
   breakpoints). Pulse field gel electrophoreses (PFGE-XbaI) on five E.
   coli strains revealed the presence of a single profile. Whole genome
   sequencing (WGS) analysis revealed a complex resistome, harboring
   bla(TEM-1b), bla(CTX-M-15), bla(OXA-1), aph(6)-Ib, aac(6 `)Ib-cr,
   aac(3)-Ila, aph(6)-Id, aadA1, qnrB1, sul2, catA1, catB3, tetA, and
   dfrA14 genes located on a 302597 bp IncHI2/HI2A plasmid. Moreover,
   bla(DHA-1), qnrB4, mph(A), sul1, and dfrA17 determinants were carried on
   an 83,429 bp IncFII plasmid. A bla(CMY-2) determinant was carried on a
   90,249 bp IncI1 plasmid. Two IncX1 and IncX4 plasmids without
   antimicrobial resistance genes were also detected. The presence of lpfA,
   iss, astA, and gad virulence factors was highlighted. This is the first
   report in Italy on an invasive infection in eight 2-weeks old dogs
   caused by the same MDR E. coli O39 bla(CTX-M-15), bla(CMY-2),
   bla(DHA-1), and aac(6 `)-Ib-cr positive strain. The above MDR E. coli
   clone caused the death of the entire litter, despite
   amoxicillin-clavulanate and enrofloxacin administration. The tank for
   storage of the water used to prepare the milk-based meal for the litter
   was the suspected reservoir.},

Abstract = {The chemical analysis of cannabis potency involves the qualitative and
   quantitative determination of the main phytocannabinoids:
   Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC), cannabidiol (CBD),
   cannabigerol (CBG), cannabichromene (CBC), etc. Although it might appear
   as a trivial analysis, it is rather a tricky task. Phytocannabinoids are
   present mostly as carboxylated species at the aromatic ring of the
   resorcinyl moiety. Their decarboxylation caused by heat leads to a
   greater analytical variability due to both reaction kinetics and
   possible decomposition. Moreover, the instability of cannabinoids and
   the variability in the sample preparation, extraction, and analysis, as
   well as the presence of isomeric forms of cannabinoids, complicates the
   scenario. A critical evaluation of the different analytical methods
   proposed in the literature points out that each of them has inherent
   limitations. The present review outlines all the possible pitfalls that
   can be encountered during the analysis of these compounds and aims to be
   a valuable help for the analytical chemist.},

Abstract = {Canine coronavirus (CCoV) strains with the ability to spread to internal
   organs, also known as pantropic CCoVs (pCCoVs), have been detected in
   domestic dogs and wild carnivores. Our study focused on the detection
   and molecular characterization of pCCoV strains circulating in Italy
   during the period 2014-2017 in autochthonous dogs, in dogs imported from
   eastern Europe or illegally imported from an unknown country. Samples
   from the gut and internal organs of 352 dogs were screened for CCoV;
   putative pCCoV strains, belonging to subtype CCoV-IIa, were identified
   in the internal organs of 35 of the examined dogs. Fifteen pCCoV strains
   were subjected to sequence and phylogenetic analyses, showing that three
   strains (98960-1/2016, 98960-3/2016, 98960-4/2016) did not cluster
   either with Italian or European CCoVs, being more closely related to
   alphacoronaviruses circulating in Asia with which they displayed a
   94\%-96\% nucleotide identity in partial spike protein gene sequences.
   The pCCoV-positive samples were also tested for other canine viruses,
   showing co-infections mainly with canine parvovirus.},

Abstract = {Background Prospective studies of Zika virus in pregnancy have reported
   rates of congenital Zika syndrome and other adverse outcomes by
   trimester. However, Zika virus can infect and damage the fetus early in
   utero, but clear before delivery. The true vertical transmission rate is
   therefore unknown. We aimed to provide the first estimates of underlying
   vertical transmission rates and adverse outcomes due to congenital
   infection with Zika virus by trimester of exposure.
   Methods This was a Bayesian latent class analysis of data from seven
   prospective studies of Zika virus in pregnancy. We estimated vertical
   transmission rates, rates of Zika-virus-related and
   non-Zika-virus-related adverse outcomes, and the diagnostic sensitivity
   of markers of congenital infection. We allowed for variation between
   studies in these parameters and used information from women in
   comparison groups with no PCR-confirmed infection, where available.
   Findings The estimated mean risk of vertical transmission was 47\% (95\%
   credible interval 26 to 76) following maternal infection in the first
   trimester, 28\% (15 to 46) in the second, and 25\% (13 to 47) in the
   third. 9\% (4 to 17) of deliveries following infections in the first
   trimester had symptoms consistent with congenital Zika syndrome, 3\% (1
   to 7) in the second, and 1\% (0 to 3) in the third. We estimated that in
   infections during the first, second, and third trimester, respectively,
   13\% (2 to 27), 3\% (-5 to 14), and 0\% (-7 to 11) of pregnancies had
   adverse outcomes attributable to Zika virus infection. Diagnostic
   sensitivity of markers of congenital infection was lowest in the first
   trimester (42\% {[}18 to 72]), but increased to 85\% (51 to 99) in
   trimester two, and 80\% (42 to 99) in trimester three. There was
   substantial between study variation in the risks of vertical
   transmission and congenital Zika syndrome. Interpretation This
   preliminary analysis recovers the causal effects of Zika virus from
   disparate study designs. Higher transmission in the first trimester is
   unusual with congenital infections but accords with laboratory evidence
   of decreasing susceptibility of placental cells to infection during
   pregnancy. Funding European Union Horizon 2020 programme.

Title = {Neo-nervegenesis in 3D dynamic responsive implant for inguinal hernia
   repair. Qualitative study},

Abstract = {Background: Prosthetic repair of inguinal hernias is one of the most
   performed surgical procedures. Nevertheless, high rates of complications
   affect the surgical treatment. Implant fixation, poor-quality tissue
   ingrowth and mesh shrinkage seem to be involved in postoperative
   complications, discomfort and chronic pain following inguinal hernia
   repair. To address these issues a multilamellar shaped 3D dynamic
   responsive prosthesis has been developed. This new implant, positioned
   fixation-free to obliterate the hernia opening, thanks its inherent
   dynamic compliance during inguinal movements, has demonstrated to induce
   an enhanced biological response. The ingrowth of newly formed muscle
   fibers, arteries and veins in a surrounding of viable connective tissue
   could be evidenced into the implant fabric. This appears to be quite
   different from the fibrotic plaque, typical biologic response of
   conventional meshes. In addition to myocytes and vessels, newly ingrown
   nerves have also been detected in the prosthetic structure.
   Materials and methods: The aim of this investigation was to determine by
   examining biopsy specimens excised from patients who underwent hernia
   repair with the 3D dynamic implant, quantity and quality of the neural
   ingrowth within the implant fabric in the short, medium, and long term
   post-implantation.
   Results: Newly formed nervous structures were found in biopsy specimens,
   from multiple spots of nerve clusters evidenced in the short-term along
   the increased level of neural maturation in the midterm, until the
   nerves showed complete in all components in the long-term.
   Conclusion: The development of highly specialized nervous tissue in the
   3D prosthesis seems to finalize the regenerative biologic response that
   is expected for the treatment of a degenerative disease, as, in fact,
   inguinal hernia is. Re-growth of the typical tissue components of the
   groin evidenced in the 3D dynamic prosthesis seems to effectively revert
   the degenerative source of inguinal hernia into regeneration of the
   vanished tissue components of the groin.},

Title = {Influence of Grape Pomace Intake on Nutritional Value, Lipid Oxidation
   and Volatile Profile of Poultry Meat},
Journal = {FOODS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Grape pomace (GP) represents the main solid by-product deriving from
   grape processing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of
   dietary GP intake on nutritional quality, lipid oxidation and volatile
   profile of chicken meat. A total of 112 Ross 508 broilers were randomly
   divided into 4 groups and fed for 21 days with a standard diet. For the
   remaining 28 days of the trial, the control group (CG) continued to
   receive a standard diet, while the experimental groups (EGs) were fed
   with diets containing different GP concentrations: 2.5\% (EG1), 5\%
   (EG2) and 7\% (EG3). Following the slaughtering, samples of breast meat
   were collected from each group. No significant differences were observed
   for pH, cooking loss and meat brightness, whereas the GP intake showed
   effectiveness in inducing variations in drip loss, meat yellowness and
   redness. The experimental feeding strategy also induced changes in the
   fatty acid profile, with an overall increase in polyunsaturated fatty
   acids (PUFA), mainly due to the increase in concentration of linoleic
   acid. The dietary supplementation also induced a decrease in lipid
   oxidation in meat, a finding also confirmed by the reduction in volatile
   aldehydes in 7 days stored raw meat. The feeding strategy based on the
   use of GP did not induce detrimental effects on the quality of broiler
   meat and showed the potential to lengthen the shelf-life as a direct
   consequence of the improvement in the oxidative stability. Overall, the
   present study showed a viable way for the recovery and the valorization
   of an agro-industrial by-product, with potential benefits also from an
   environmental point of view.},

Journal = {FOOD CONTROL},

Volume = {110},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Purpose of the present study was to evaluate the total Hg (THg) level in
   Billfish caught in the Western Central Atlantic and to assess the
   potential health consequences due to consumption for people living in
   Grenada (GR) and in the Dominican Republic (DR). Consumption data were
   collected through the administration of an online questionnaire and THg
   was measured in samples of Atlantic sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus, n
   = 38), Blue Marlin (Makaira nigricans, n = 62) and White marlin (Kajikia
   albida, n = 45) collected at the main fish landing point in GR and in
   DR. The potential health risk for different consumer groups was
   evaluated by calculating the estimated metal weekly intake rate (MWIR;
   mu g kg(-1) body weight), that was compared to the provisional tolerable
   weekly intake (PTWI) for methylmercury (MeHg), and the total hazard
   quotient (THQ). A conservative approach was applied considering that THg
   was detected in its more toxic form, i.e. MeHg. The following levels of
   THg values were detected: Blue Marlin (0.09-6.23 mg kg(-1)), White
   Marlin (0.05-3.21 mg kg(-1)) and Atlantic sailfish (0.03-0.64 mg
   kg(-1)). For average consumers, the estimated MWIR minimally contributed
   to the PTWI and the THQ values turned out to be far below 1 in both the
   studied countries. Differently, the results regarding high consumers (95
   percentile) raised some concerns.},

Abstract = {Motivation :The potentially low precision associated with the geographic
   origin of sampled sequences represents an important limitation for
   spatially explicit (i.e. continuous) phylogeographic inference of
   fast-evolving pathogens such as RNA viruses. A substantial proportion of
   publicly available sequences is geo-referenced at broad spatial scale
   such as the administrative unit of origin, rather than more precise
   locations (e.g. geographic coordinates). Most frequently, such sequences
   are either discarded prior to continuous phylogeographic inference or
   arbitrarily assigned to the geographic coordinates of the centroid of
   their administrative area of origin for lack of a better alternative.
   Results: We here implement and describe a new approach that allows to
   incorporate heterogeneous prior sampling probabilities over a geographic
   area. External data, such as outbreak locations, are used to specify
   these prior sampling probabilities over a collection of sub-polygons. We
   apply this new method to the analysis of highly pathogenic avian
   influenza H5N1 clade data in the Mekong region. Our method allows to
   properly include, in continuous phylogeographic analyses, H5N1 sequences
   that are only associated with large administrative areas of origin and
   assign them with more accurate locations. Finally, we use continuous
   phylogeographic reconstructions to analyse the dispersal dynamics of
   different H5N1 clades and investigate the impact of environmental
   factors on lineage dispersal velocities.},

Title = {Molecular characterization of Trichuris spp. from captive animals based
   on mitochondrial markers},
Journal = {PARASITOLOGY INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {75},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Monoxenous parasites may easily infect animals in captivity, and
   nematodes belonging to the genus Trichuris are commonly reported in
   zoological gardens worldwide. Infections in captive animals should be
   accurately monitored and the characterization of pathogens is highly
   advisable, as a tool to infer possible routes of intra- and
   interspecific transmission pathways and to assess the related zoonotic
   potential. Whipworms are usually identified on the basis of few
   morphological features of adults males and eggs and by an
   host-affiliation criterion. Given the strong morphological convergence
   of adaptive traits and the possible occurrence of hybridization and/or
   cross-infections events, the use of molecular methods is of great
   utility.
   Here, we analysed two partial mitochondrial loci, the cytochrome c
   oxidase I and the cytochrome b regions, in Trichuris spp. infecting four
   animal species hosted in the Bioparco Zoological Garden of Rome. Results
   from molecular systematics, compared to previous data, suggested that
   the five Trichuris taxa recovered were well separated, showing a
   significant degree of host affiliation (herbivorous, primates/swine and
   rodents/canids). The screw horn antelopes and the camels were infected
   with two variants of Trichuris ovis; Trichuris sp. similar to those
   observed in rodents from South America was infecting the Patagonian
   maras. Moreover, Trichuris from the ring-tailed lemur showed a great
   similarity to Trichuris infecting the Japanese macaque previously
   analysed from the same zoological garden, and clustering together with
   Trichuris trichiura, posing a potential zoonotic threat for visitors and
   workers.},

Abstract = {Mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) is a rare clinical variant of tegumentary
   leishmaniasis in Mediterranean Europe. Here we report on three
   autochthonous cases of head and neck ML in patients living in
   Northeastern Italy. Patients presented with non-specific, long-standing
   symptoms of upper respiratory tract involvement, mimicking other
   diseases. Parasitological diagnosis was reached by histopathology,
   immunohistochemistry and molecular biology on tissue specimens.
   Leishmania infantum was identified by molecular typing in all three
   cases. All patients reached a complete remission with protracted
   multivalent antileishmanial drugs; in one case, a novel approach of
   combined medical and endoscopic surgical treatment was carried out. High
   clinical suspicion led to a prompt diagnosis and deployment of a
   multivalent treatment. ML should be considered in the differential
   diagnosis of nasal, oral, and pharyngolaryngeal lesions in endemic
   areas. A prompt diagnosis is mandatory to establish a correct
   management; different antileishmanial medications as well as endoscopic
   surgical options may be required to reach a complete remission.},

Abstract = {Iodine (I) is a micronutrient that mammals need for proper functionality
   of thyroid gland since it is the main component of thyroid hormones.
   Besides studies that have investigated the role of I in livestock
   nutrition, it is also important to know the transcriptomics changes in
   small ruminants following I supplementation. Therefore, the aim of this
   study was to investigate the effects of I on the whole blood
   transcriptome in sheep. Fifteen lactating cross-bred ewes (3 to
   4-year-old, 55 to 65 kg BW) at their late lactation period were enrolled
   in this study. At the beginning, all the animals had a 2-week
   acclimation period where they were fed with a basal diet which includes
   an adequate level of I (2 mg I/animal per day) in the form of calcium
   iodate (CaI2O6). Then, the ewes were randomly divided into two groups
   and fed in individual troughs: the control group (n = 5) was maintained
   on basal diet and the experimental group (I, n = 10) was fed for 40 days
   with a diet containing a high I supplementation (equivalent to 30 mg
   I/animal per day), in the form of potassium iodide. Whole blood and milk
   were collected individually at the beginning (T0) and after the 40 days
   of supplementation (T40). Iodine quantification was assessed in serum
   and milk sample. Microarray gene expression analysis was performed on
   whole blood and, filtering data using a fold change >2 with an adjusted
   P < 0.05, we identified 250 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the
   I group (T40 v. T0). Looking for biological processes associated with
   our DEGs, we found significant association with cell growth regulation.
   Thus, our study unveils the role of I supplementation on gene expression
   in sheep improving the knowledge about micronutrients in animal
   nutrition.},

Title = {Identification and Genetic Characterization of a Novel Respirovirus in
   Alpine Chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra rupicapra)},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Simple Summary The Alpine chamois is a free-living wild ruminant
   distributed across the mountainous areas of France, Italy, Switzerland,
   Liechtenstein, Germany, Austria, Slovenia and Croatia. This wide
   distribution favours interactions with other wild ruminants and
   livestock, implying the risk of cross-transmission of pathogens. Due to
   the impact of lung diseases on chamois populations, the investigation of
   respiratory pathogens is important for wildlife conservation and for the
   understanding of infection transmission at the livestock-wildlife
   interface. In the present study, a novel respirovirus was isolated from
   a chamois with lung lesions and characterized by full-genome sequence
   and phylogeny. The genome characterization of this novel virus revealed
   similarities to domestic ruminant respiroviruses, mainly of caprine and
   ovine origin. Overall, phylogenetic analyses indicated that the chamois
   virus is distinct from already defined species and suggested that it is
   a putative novel member of the genus Respirovirus. The present
   investigation contributes to the knowledge of respiratory infections in
   wild ruminants and raises questions on the epidemiological link between
   chamois and other animal species.
   Abstract The Respirovirus genus, family Paramamixoviridae, includes
   respiratory viral pathogens. Here we report the identification and
   genetic characterization of a respirovirus in an Alpine chamois showing
   interstitial pneumonia associated with catarrhal bronchopneumonia. The
   full-genome characterization of this respirovirus, named
   ChamoisRV/IT2014, revealed low similarities to caprine respirovirus
   (77.1\%), bovine respirovirus (74.5\%) and human respirovirus (72.0\%).
   The phylogenetic analyses based on the full-length genome sequence of
   the novel isolate and reference respirovirus strains showed that
   ChamoisRV/IT2014 clustered with caprine respirovirus but formed a
   separate branch. The phylogenetic tree topology of complete large
   protein amino acid sequences, representing the current species
   demarcation criterion for Respirovirus genus, showed a 0.05 branch
   length of ChamoisRV/IT2014 sequence between the nearest node and the tip
   of the branch, suggesting that this virus belongs to a novel species.
   This new isolate in a new host species raises several questions to be
   addressed on the epidemiological role of chamois and the risks of
   cross-transmission between wild ruminants and livestock.},

Title = {Transport to the Slaughterhouse Affects the Salmonella Shedding and
   Modifies the Fecal Microbiota of Finishing Pigs},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Simple SummarySalmonella is one of the most important pathogens
   responsible for food poisoning in humans and pork is recognized as one
   of the major sources for human salmonellosis. Pigs can become infected
   with Salmonella on the farm or in the very last phases of the production
   chain that include transport, lairage, and slaughter. The transport of
   animals from the farm to the slaughterhouse plays an important role in
   the transmission of this pathogen from pigs to pigs. The aim of our
   study was to investigate if the transport from the farm to the
   slaughterhouse increases the load of Salmonella in feces and to
   determine a modification of the fecal microbiota in pigs. Our study
   showed that the load of Salmonella increases after transport, confirming
   that this phase of the production is a critical point for the control of
   Salmonella contamination. The fecal microbiota composition was modified
   in Salmonella-positive animals after transport, in accordance with what
   is already published in scientific literature. In this stage, a natural
   Salmonella infection causes a severe modification of the fecal
   microbiota which is similar to the one observed in studies carried out
   in experimental facilities.
   Abstract Contaminated pork is a significant source of foodborne
   Salmonellosis. Pork is contaminated at the slaughterhouse and the
   intestinal content is the predominant source of Salmonella for carcass
   contamination. The prevalence of Salmonella-positive pigs increases
   significantly when the time of transport to the slaughterhouse is longer
   than two hours. The hypothesis behind this study is that transport to
   the slaughterhouse increases the load of Salmonella in feces and
   determines a shift of the fecal microbiota in finishing pigs. Fecal
   samples were collected in a pig herd positive for Salmonella spp., the
   day before the transport and at the slaughterhouse. Salmonella loads
   were estimated by the most probable number (MPN) technique, according to
   the ISO/TS 6579-2:2012/A1. Moreover, the fecal bacteria composition was
   assessed by sequencing the V3-V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA
   gene. Our study showed that the load of Salmonella increases after
   transport, confirming that this phase of the production chain is a
   critical point for the control of Salmonella contamination. A lower
   richness and an increased beta-diversity characterized the fecal
   microbiota composition of Salmonella-positive animals after transport.
   In this stage, a natural Salmonella infection causes a disruption of the
   fecal microbiota as observed in challenge studies.},

Abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is recognized worldwide as one of the main
   contagious mastitis agents in cattle and can express a set of
   antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence-associated genes that
   explain the wide range of outcomes of intramammary infections.
   Staphylococcus aureus strains are heterogeneous: their different
   resistance and virulence patterns, associated with hostlevel factors and
   treatment factors, are related to the severity of infection. The aim of
   this study was to determine phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility,
   occurrence of selected antimicrobial resistance genes and other
   virulence genes in 93 S. aureus strains isolated from clinical mastitis
   in 6 countries: Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Italy, the United States
   (New York State), and South Africa. These isolates were tested against a
   total of 16 drugs (amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin, cefazolin,
   cefoperazone, cefquinome, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin,
   kanamycin, lincomycin, oxacillin, penicillin, ri fam pi n , spiramycin,
   s ti I famet lioxazole/t ri met hopri m , tylosin) by minimum inhibitory
   concentration (MIC) assay, and examined for the presence of 6
   antibiotic-resistance genes (blaZ, mecA, mecC, ermA, ermB, ermC) and 6
   virulence-associated genes (scn, chp, sak, hla, hlb, sea) via PCR
   analysis. The phenotypic results of this study revealed the presence of
   19.4\% penicillin-resistant strains, whereas 22.6\% of the strains were
   classified as having resistance (5.4\%) or intermediate resistance
   (17.2\%) to erythromycin. Most (96.8\%) of the isolates were inhibited
   by cephalosporins, and all were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate.
   Two strains (1 from Germany, 1 from Italy) were resistant to oxacillin
   and were positive for mecA. Among the other antimicrobial resistance
   genes, the most frequently detected was blaZ (46.2\%), and 32.3\% of the
   isolates were positive for erm genes: ermC (21.5\%) and ermB (10.8\%).
   The most prevalent virulence gene was hla (100\%), followed by hlb
   (84.9\%) and sea (65.6\%). These results show a low prevalence of
   antibiotic multidrug resistance in S. aureus isolates, even if the
   detection of selected antimicrobial resistance genes did not always
   correspond with the occurrence of phenotypic antibiotic resistance; the
   immune evasion cluster gene prevalence was quite low in the samples
   analyzed.},

Abstract = {Swine brucellosis is a zoonotic disease that affects both domestic pigs
   (Sus scrofa) and wild pigs such as wild boar (Sus scrofa). We evaluated
   the presence of antibodies against Brucella spp. in wild boar hunted in
   the Campania region, Italy, during the hunting season of 2016-17. Serum
   samples were collected from 434 wild boars and tested for antibodies
   against Brucella spp. For detection of antibodies to swine brucellosis,
   the rose Bengal test (RBT) and a blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent
   assay (ELI SA) were performed. Of 434 serum samples, 22 (5.1\%) tested
   by RBT and 58 (13.5\%) tested using the blocking ELISA were positive for
   brucella. The seroprevalences of Brucella spp. did not differ between
   the sexes or age classes, while the prevalence of infected animals was
   positively correlated with the Avellino province. Our data showed that
   wild boar in the Campania region are exposed to brucella infection, and
   that the prevalence of the disease has increased in recent years.},

Abstract = {West Nile virus (WNV) lineage 2 is expanding and causing large outbreaks
   in Europe. In this study, we analyzed the epidemiological, clinical, and
   virological features of WNV lineage 2 infection during the large
   outbreak that occurred in northern Italy in 2018. The study population
   included 86 patients with neuroinvasive disease (WNND), 307 with fever
   (WNF), and 34 blood donors. Phylogenetic analysis of WNV full genome
   sequences from patients' samples showed that the virus belonged to the
   widespread central/southern European clade of WNV lineage 2 and was
   circulating in the area at least since 2014. The incidence of WNND and
   WNF progressively increased with age and was higher in males than in
   females. Among WNND patients, the case fatality rate was 22\%. About
   70\% of blood donors reported symptoms during follow-up. Within the
   first week after symptom onset, WNV RNA was detectable in the blood or
   urine of 80\% of patients, while 20\% and 40\% of WNND and WNF patients,
   respectively, were WNV IgM-seronegative. In CSF samples of WNND
   patients, WNV RNA was typically detectable when WNV IgM antibodies were
   absent. Blunted or no WNV IgM response and high WNV IgG levels were
   observed in seven patients with previous flavivirus immunity.},

Title = {Identification and RNAi Profile of a Novel Iflavirus Infecting
   Senegalese Aedes vexans arabiensis Mosquitoes},
Journal = {VIRUSES-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The inland floodwater mosquito Aedes vexans (Meigen, 1830) is a
   competent vector of numerous arthropod-borne viruses such as Rift Valley
   fever virus (Phenuiviridae) and Zika virus (Flaviviridae). Aedes vexans
   spp. have widespread Afrotropical distribution and are common European
   cosmopolitan mosquitoes. We examined the virome of Ae. vexans arabiensis
   samples from Barkedji village, Senegal, with small RNA sequencing,
   bioinformatic analysis, and RT-PCR screening. We identified a novel 9494
   nt iflavirus (Picornaviridae) designated here as Aedes vexans iflavirus
   (AvIFV). Annotation of the AvIFV genome reveals a 2782 amino acid
   polyprotein with iflavirus protein domain architecture and typical
   iflavirus 5' internal ribosomal entry site and 3' poly-A tail. Aedes
   vexans iflavirus is most closely related to a partial virus sequence
   from Venturia canescens (a parasitoid wasp) with 56.77\% pairwise amino
   acid identity. Analysis of AvIFV-derived small RNAs suggests that AvIFV
   is targeted by the exogenous RNA interference pathway but not the
   PIWI-interacting RNA response, as similar to 60\% of AvIFV reads
   corresponded to 21 nt Dicer-2 virus-derived small RNAs and the 24-29 nt
   AvIFV read population did not exhibit a ``ping-pong{''} signature. The
   RT-PCR screens of archival and current (circa 2011-2020) Ae. vexans
   arabiensis laboratory samples and wild-caught mosquitoes from Barkedji
   suggest that AvIFV is ubiquitous in these mosquitoes. Further, we
   screened wild-caught European Ae. vexans samples from Germany, the
   United Kingdom, Italy, and Sweden, all of which tested negative for
   AvIFV RNA. This report provides insight into the diversity of commensal
   Aedes viruses and the host RNAi response towards iflaviruses.},

Year = {2020},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The mechanisms underlying virus emergence are rarely well understood,
   making the appearance of outbreaks largely unpredictable. Bluetongue
   virus serotype 8 (BTV-8), an arthropod-borne virus of ruminants, emerged
   in livestock in northern Europe in 2006, spreading to most European
   countries by 2009 and causing losses of billions of euros. Although the
   outbreak was successfully controlled through vaccination by early 2010,
   puzzlingly, a closely related BTV-8 strain re-emerged in France in 2015,
   triggering a second outbreak that is still ongoing. The origin of this
   virus and the mechanisms underlying its re-emergence are unknown. Here,
   we performed phylogenetic analyses of 164 whole BTV-8 genomes sampled
   throughout the two outbreaks. We demonstrate consistent clock-like virus
   evolution during both epizootics but found negligible evolutionary
   change between them. We estimate that the ancestor of the second
   outbreak dates from the height of the first outbreak in 2008. This
   implies that the virus had not been replicating for multiple years prior
   to its re-emergence in 2015. Given the absence of any known natural
   mechanism that could explain BTV-8 persistence over this long period
   without replication, we hypothesise that the second outbreak could have
   been initiated by accidental exposure of livestock to frozen material
   contaminated with virus from approximately 2008. Our work highlights new
   targets for pathogen surveillance programmes in livestock and
   illustrates the power of genomic epidemiology to identify pathways of
   infectious disease emergence.},

Abstract = {Recent studies have revealed extensive genetic variations among Neospora
   caninum, a cyst-forming protozoan parasite that is one of the main
   causes of bovine abortion in the cattle industry worldwide. Previous
   genetic studies based on multilocus microsatellite genotyping (MLGs) of
   different Ibero-American populations showed a high genetic diversity.
   These studies provided clear clues of a predominant clonal propagation
   in cattle and population sub-structuring partially associated with
   geographical origin. Although, these reports were limited to a reduced
   number of countries. In this study, the N. caninum isolates from aborted
   bovine fetuses and stillbirths and a goat abortion from Northern Italy
   were investigated genetically using 9 microsatellite markers. Complete
   or nearly complete isolate profiles were obtained from 30 fetuses and
   stillbirths. An extensive genetic diversity was also found in this
   Italian N. caninum population. The study of genetic relationships among
   Italian MLGs using network (eBURST) and principal component analyses
   based on the allele-sharing coefficient (PCoA) showed different clonal
   subpopulations disseminated throughout Northern Italy without apparent
   segregation depending on the geographic origin, cattle breed, or time of
   collection. The presence of linkage disequilibrium supports a
   predominant clonal propagation of Italian N. caninum. In addition, most
   of Italian MLGs segregated from other global populations including
   Spain, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, and Scotland, suggesting the
   existence of specific N. caninum subpopulations in the Northern Italy
   and different subpopulations of N. caninum circulating in Europe.},

Title = {Bovine Papillomavirus Type 2 Infection Associated with Papillomatosis of
   the Amniotic Membrane in Water Buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis)},
Journal = {PATHOGENS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Multiple papillomatous nodules were observed scattered over the amniotic
   membrane in six water buffaloes that had recently aborted. Grossly, some
   of the nodules had multiple villous projections while others appeared as
   single prominent conical or cylindrical horns. Histology revealed folded
   hyperplastic and hyperkeratotic epithelium supported by a narrow
   fibro-vascular stalk. Using PCR, sequences of the bovine
   Deltapapillomavirus type 2 (BPV-2) E5 gene were amplified from the
   amniotic papillomas. Furthermore, expression of the E5 gene was detected
   using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Western blotting revealed BPV-2 E5
   oncoprotein as well as L1 protein, suggesting both abortive and
   productive infection. Additionally, a functional complex composed of
   BPV-2 E5 oncoprotein and the phosphorylated PDGF beta R was detected,
   which is consistent with the activation of PDGF beta R by the
   interaction with BPV-2 E5 oncoprotein. These results demonstrate that
   BPV-2 can infect the amnion of water buffaloes and suggest that this
   infection may cause proliferation of the epithelial cells of the amnion.
   While the precise pathogenesis in uncertain, it is possible that BPV-2
   infection of stratified squamous epithelial cells within squamous
   metaplasia foci and/or amniotic plaques could lead to papilloma
   formation. Papillomavirus-associated amniotic papillomas have not
   previously been reported in any species, including humans.},

Abstract = {The capability to deposit intact highly pure ionic species makes ion
   soft landing an advantageous mass spectrometric method able to create
   molecular layers on solid surfaces. Recent advances in this technique
   gave the possibility to manipulate solvent-free ions in open-air
   conditions. The high ionic current produced by the new sources as well
   as the developments of accelerated systems dramatically increase the
   efficiency of the soft landing process, opening new opportunities for
   surface modification with self-organized polyatomic structures. This
   review reports the developments of the ambient ion soft landing,
   highlights its most recent applications and discusses future
   perspectives. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides (Mmm) is the etiological agent of
   contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), one of the major diseases
   affecting cattle in sub-Saharan Africa. Some evidences suggest that the
   immune system of the host (cattle) plays an important role in the
   pathogenic mechanism of CBPP, but the factors involved in the process
   remain largely unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the cell
   response of bovine polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) after Mmm in
   vitro exposure using one step RT-qPCR and Western blotting. Data
   obtained indicate that gene and protein expression levels of some
   pro-inflammatory factors already change upon 30 min of PMNs exposure to
   Mmm. Of note, mRNA expression level in Mmm exposed PMNs increased in a
   time-dependent manner and for all time points investigated; targets
   expression was also detected by Western blotting in Mmm exposed PMNs
   only. These data demonstrate that when bovine PMN cells are triggered by
   Mmm, they undergo molecular changes, upregulating mRNA and protein
   expression of specific pro-inflammatory factors. These results provide
   additional information on host-pathogen interaction during CBPP
   infection.},

Abstract = {An analytical method is applied to simultaneously determine bisphenol A,
   4-octylphenol, 4-tert-octylphenol, 4-nonylphenol and tert-nonylphenol in
   fish muscle. The method consisted of a cleanup on molecularly imprinted
   polymers cartridges (MIPs) followed by liquid chromatography coupled to
   a tandem mass spectrometer. The method is rapid, specific, reliable and
   very sensitive, allowing for quantification down to 0.5 ng/g for all
   studied compounds. After in-house validation, the method was employed to
   monitor the concentration levels of BPA and four target alkylphenols in
   44 marine fish, collected from third countries in the frame of official
   control activities. The results showed that 27 samples (61.4\%) were
   contaminated by at least one target compound. Bisphenol A was determined
   in 11 samples in the range 0.6-7.1 ng/g, 4-tert-octylphenol in 8 samples
   (0.5-1.6 ng/g) and tert-nonylphenol in 14 samples (0.8-8.9 ng/g).
   4-Octylphenol and 4-nonylphenol were not detected at all.},

Abstract = {Globalization of seafood product marketing caused the increase of
   request of an effective fish traceability that enhances the consumer
   confidence in food safety. In this study, an integrated multi analytical
   approach based on two different and independent analytical techniques
   (carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes and fatty acids analysis) was
   applied in order to identify different fish species and trace their
   geographical provenience. The investigation was focused on four species
   (Thunnus thynnus, Thunnus alalunga, Auxis rochei and Scomber scombrus)
   belonging to the Scombridae family. The DNA barcoding method confirmed
   genus and species for S. scombrus and A. rochei, but only genus for T.
   alalunga and T. thynnus. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes results
   evidenced different fish diets and trophic positions, whereas fatty
   acids analysis displayed that the unsaturated prevailed (similar to 60
   \%) over the saturated compounds with a variation among the species and
   the geographical area in particular for docosahexaenoic and
   eicosapentaenoic acids percentage. The principal component analysis
   applied to stable isotopes and fatty acids evidenced a good
   discrimination among species and their geographical catching area. This
   multi-disciplinary analytical approach could represent a promising tool
   to identify the commercial fish and trace their origin in order to
   guarantee the health of consumers.},

Abstract = {Large population studies estimated that the frequency of food allergies
   is increasing worldwide. In the last two decades, a `second wave' of the
   allergy epidemic has emerged as a growing public health problem. EU
   regulation strengthened information to consumers about allergens in
   pre-packed food, since December 2014 it has been extended to
   non-prepacked foods by the Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of the European
   Commission. The present work aims to present a five-year survey on the
   presence of nine types of allergen in several foods, including food of
   animal origin and baby food. The concentration found for each irregular
   allergen is generally low, but some samples with no gluten indication
   contained a concentration above 10 mg kg(-1) with the highest value of
   138.5 mg kg(-1) in a dietetic food, during the screening in 2017. These
   data underline the importance and the necessity of a complete food
   labelling to protect the majority of allergic individuals.},

Title = {Local context and environment as risk factors for acute poisoning in
   animals in northwest Italy},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {709},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {Animal and bait poisoning data for northwest Italy collected between
   2012 and 2017 were described and analyzed to estimate the risk of
   exposure to hazardous substances by animals. In about 4\% of animals
   necropsied (n= 356/9512), the cause of death was poisoning and domestic
   pets (9.5\%) and synanthropic animals (12.2\%) appear to be the most
   involved. Furthermore, 294 out of 728 baits (40.4\%) were positive for
   toxic substances and/or inert hazardous material.
   Application of a mixed-effects Poisson regression model and local
   cluster analysis evidenced increased risk of exposure to poisoning with
   altimetry (>600 m.a.s.l.) and municipality (PR= 1.6, 95\%CI 1.2-2.1 for
   poisoning, PR = 2.2, 95\%CI 1.2-4.2 for poisoning by insecticides and
   PR= 2.9, 95\%CI 1.4-6.2 for poisoning by metaldehyde). Since the
   mountainous areas in the region are mostly devoted to pasture and
   extensive farming, the high frequency of animal and bait poisoning
   events may be related to farmers' need to protect their livestock and
   crops against foxes, wolves, rodents or wild boars. Summarizing, the
   type of land use and context may influence the frequency and type of
   toxin chosen to kill animals considered a nuisance for hunting, farming,
   agriculture and apiculture. Despite bans and limitations, the use of
   harmful substances is not perceived as an environmental threat but
   rather as routine pest control.
   Animal and bait poisoning constitute a public health concern because it
   is potentially harmful to humans and the environment. Our findings may
   inform risk communication strategies, as well as prevention and control
   measures for the reduction of illegal and non-targeted species
   poisoning. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The potential threat of both metals and antibiotics to the environment
   and human health has raised significant concerns in the last decade.
   Metal-resistant and antibiotic-resistant bacteria are found in most
   environments, including water, and the risk posed to humans and animals
   due to the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and
   antibiotic-resistant genes in the environment is increasing. Bacteria
   have developed the ability to tolerate metals even at notable
   concentrations. This ability tends to favor the selection of
   antibiotic-resistant strains, even in pristine water environments, with
   the potential risk of spreading this resistance to human pathogens. In
   this mini-review, we focus on investigations performed in marine and
   freshwater environments worldwide, highlighting the presence of
   co-resistance to metals and antibiotics.},

Title = {Types of pesticides involved in domestic and wild animal poisoning in
   Italy},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {707},
Month = {MAR 10},
Abstract = {Data obtained from samples of poisoned domestic and wild animals sent
   for toxicological evaluation during the period between 2005 and 2014
   have been analyzed. Among the 4606 tested samples, the majority of which
   were collected in the northern regions of Italy, 2006 (43.55\%) were
   found positive for pesticides. Analytical detections were performed via
   solvent extraction followed by separation and chromatographic
   characterization and all the methods applied for the toxicological
   investigations were developed by IZSLER.
   Insecticides, mainly represented by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
   (carbamates 17.55\%, n = 352; organophosphates 15.15\%, n= 304) and
   organochlorines (29.21\%, n= 586), were found to be the first category
   of pesticides involved in intoxications, in both domestic and in wild
   animals, followed by rodenticides (anticoagulant rodenticides 21.09\%,
   n= 423; zinc phosphide 2.59\%, n= 52; chloralose 0.95\%, n= 19 and
   thallium 0.15\%, n= 3) and molluscicides (metaldehyde 6.63\%, n = 133).
   Second and third generation anticoagulants (bromadiolone and
   brodifacoum) were the most represented (10.52\%, n = 211) but also first
   generation compounds (i.e. coumatetralyl and warfarin) were still found
   responsible of intoxications. Even if some pesticides are frequently
   involved in domestic animal poisoning (i.e. metaldehyde and strychnine),
   they did not show the same diffusion in wild animals. In particular,
   unlike domestic species, cyanide and pyrethroids have not been found
   responsible of intoxications in wild animals.
   Interestingly, a great number of positive samples involved banned
   pesticides like alpha- (14.41\%, n = 289) and beta-(14.16\%, n = 284)
   endosulfan, carbofuran (5.73\%, n = 115), methamidophos (9.47\%, n =
   190), strychnine (6.23\%, n = 125) but, on the other hand, many
   positives were due to the exposure to commercially available products
   (i.e. metaldehyde and anticoagulant rodenticides). Thus, together with
   measures aimed to reduce illegal uses, educational campaigns and a wider
   range of compounds to detect would be beneficial in order to address the
   issue of animal poisoning, which besides has also repercussions on
   environmental and public health. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a complex biological program
   between physiology and pathology. Here, amniotic epithelial cells (AEC)
   were used as in vitro model of transiently inducible EMT in order to
   evaluate the transcriptional insights underlying this process.
   Therefore, RNA-seq was used to identify the differentially expressed
   genes and enrichment analyses were carried out to assess the
   intracellular pathways involved. As a result, molecules exclusively
   expressed in AEC that experienced EMT (GSTA1-1 and GSTM3) or when this
   process is inhibited (KLHL14 and KCNE3) were identified. Lastly, the
   network theory was used to obtain a computational model able to
   recognize putative controller genes involved in the induction and in the
   prevention of EMT. The results suggested an opposite role of
   lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) synthesis and degradation enzymes in the
   regulation of EMT process. In conclusion, these molecules may represent
   novel EMT regulators and also targets for developing new therapeutic
   strategies.},

Abstract = {Toxoplasmosis is a zoonotic food-borne disease caused by Toxoplasma
   gondii, a land-derived protozoan parasite that infects a broad range of
   terrestrial and aquatic hosts. T. gondii may reach coastal waters via
   contaminated freshwater runoff and its oocysts may enter into the marine
   food web. Marine invertebrates as mussels being filter feeders are
   exposed and may concentrate T. gondii oocysts representing a potential
   source of infection for animals and humans. The present works
   investigated the prevalence, parasite burden and genotypes of T. gondii
   in the Mediterranean mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) from southern
   Italy. We sampled a total of 382 individual Mediterranean mussels from
   May to August 2018 from seven production sites in the Gulf of Naples
   (Campania region). An additional sample including 27 farmed
   Mediterranean mussels was obtained in February 2018 from a mollusk
   depuration plant in Corigliano Calabro (Calabria region). T. gondii DNA
   was detected in 43 out of 409 (10.5\%) Mediterranean mussels from seven
   out of eight sampling sites. The number of T. gondii copies/g in the
   digestive gland ranged from 0.14 to 1.18. Fragment analysis of Short
   Tandem Repeats (STRs) at 5 microsatellite loci was performed from 10 T.
   gondii PCR positive samples revealing the presence of five distinct
   genotypes including one corresponding to type I and four atypical
   genotypes. These findings suggest potential implications of
   epidemiological importance for human and animal health because both type
   I and atypical genotypes could be highly pathogenic.},

Title = {Comparative genomic analysis reveals high intra-serovar plasticity
   within Salmonella Napoli isolated in 2005-2017},

Abstract = {Background Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Napoli (S.
   Napoli) is among the top serovars causing human infections in Italy,
   although it is relatively uncommon in other European countries; it is
   mainly isolated from humans and the environment, but neither the
   reservoir nor its route of infection are clearly defined. This serovar
   is characterized by high genomic diversity, and molecular evidences
   revealed important similarities with typhoidal serovars. Results 179 S.
   Napoli genomes as well as 239 genomes of typhoidal and non-typhoidal
   serovars were analyzed in a comparative genomic study. Phylogenetic
   analysis and draft genome characterization in terms of Multi Locus
   Sequence Typing (MLST), plasmid replicons, Salmonella Pathogenicity
   Islands (SPIs), antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), phages, biocide
   and metal-tolerance genes confirm the high genetic variability of S.
   Napoli, also revealing a within-serovar phylogenetic structure more
   complex than previously known. Our work also confirms genomic similarity
   of S. Napoli to typhoidal serovars (S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A), with
   S. Napoli samples clustering primarily according to ST, each being
   characterized by specific genomic traits. Moreover, two major subclades
   of S. Napoli can be clearly identified, with ST-474 being biphyletic.
   All STs span among isolation sources and years of isolation,
   highlighting the challenge this serovar poses to define its epidemiology
   and evolution. Altogether, S. Napoli strains carry less SPIs and less
   ARGs than other non-typhoidal serovars and seldom acquire plasmids.
   However, we here report the second case of an extended-spectrum
   beta-lactamases (ESBLs) producing S. Napoli strain and the first cases
   of multidrug resistant (MDR) S. Napoli strains, all isolated from
   humans. Conclusions Our results provide evidence of genomic plasticity
   of S. Napoli, highlighting genomic similarity with typhoidal serovars
   and genomic features typical of non-typhoidal serovars, supporting the
   possibility of survival in different niches, both enteric and
   non-enteric. Presence of horizontally acquired ARGs and MDR profiles
   rises concerns regarding possible selective pressure exerted by human
   environment on this pathogen.},

Title = {Characterization of the IgA response to PRRS virus in pig oral fluids},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 3},
Abstract = {Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) is a complex model
   of host/virus relationship. Disease control measures often includes
   ``acclimatization{''}, i.e. the exposure of PRRS-naive gilts and sows to
   PRRSV-infected pigs and premises before the breeding period. In this
   respect, we had repeatedly observed an association between
   PRRSV-specific IgA responses in oral fluids (OF) of gilts and block of
   PRRSV spread. Therefore, we set out to investigate in vitro the
   inhibition of PRRSV replication by OF samples with different titers of
   PRRSV-specific IgA and IgG antibody, using Real-time RT PCR. PRRSV yield
   reduction in monocyte-derived macrophages was associated with the IgA
   content in OF samples, whereas the IgG-rich samples were sometimes
   associated with antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of replication.
   Accordingly, we could discriminate between ADEpositive and ADE-negative
   PRRSV strains. Next, we separated Ig isotypes in OF samples of
   PRRSV-infected pigs by means of protein A and size exclusion
   chromatography. The above results were confirmed by using separated Ig
   isotypes. Both dimeric and monomeric IgA were associated with the
   strongest reduction of PRRSV replication. The treatment of pig
   macrophages with separated OF antibodies before PRRSV infection was also
   associated with PRRSV yield reduction, along with clear changes of both
   CD163 and CD169 surface expression. Our results point at a role of
   mucosal IgA in the control of PRRSV replication by extra- and/or
   intracellular interaction with PRRSV, as well as by induction of signals
   leading to a reduced susceptibility of macrophages to PRRSV infection.},

Journal = {BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {36},

Pages = {1468-1475},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Motivation: Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) count data show many
   differences compared with bulk RNA-seq count data, making the
   application of many RNA-seq pre-processing/analysis methods not
   straightforward or even inappropriate. For this reason, the development
   of new methods for handling scRNA-seq count data is currently one of the
   most active research fields in bioinformatics. To help the development
   of such new methods, the availability of simulated data could play a
   pivotal role. However, only few scRNA-seq count data simulators are
   available, often showing poor or not demonstrated similarity with real
   data.
   Results: In this article we present SPARSim, a scRNA-seq count data
   simulator based on a Gamma-Multivariate Hypergeometric model. We
   demonstrate that SPARSim allows to generate count data that resemble
   real data in terms of count intensity, variability and sparsity,
   performing comparably or better than one of the most used scRNAseq
   simulator, Splat. In particular, SPARSim simulated count matrices well
   resemble the distribution of zeros across different expression
   intensities observed in real count data.},

Title = {Evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of ASF detection with or without

Journal = {JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {African swine fever (ASF) is a highly contagious disease of domestic
   pigs and wild boars (WBs). Without a vaccine, early antibody and antigen
   detection and rapid diagnosis are crucial for the effective prevention
   of the disease and the employment of control measures. In Sardinia,
   where 3 different suid populations coexisted closely for a long time,
   the disease persists since 1978. The recent ASF eradication plan
   involves more stringent measures to combat free-ranging pigs and any
   kind of illegality in the pig industry. However, critical issues such as
   the low level of hunter cooperation with veterinary services and the
   time required for ASF detection in the WBs killed during the hunting
   season still remain. Considering the need to deliver true ASF negative
   carcasses as early as possible, this study focuses on the evaluation and
   validation of a duplex pen-side test that simultaneously detects
   antibodies and antigens specific to ASF virus, to improve molecular
   diagnosis under field conditions. The main goal was to establish the
   specificity of the two pen-side tests performed simultaneously and to
   determine their ability to detect the true ASF negative carcasses among
   the hunted WBs. Blood and organ samples of the WBs hunted during the
   2018/2019 hunting seasons were obtained. A total of 160 animals were
   tested using the pen-side kit test; samples were collected for
   virological and serological analyses. A specificity of 98\% was observed
   considering the official laboratory tests as gold standards. The new
   diagnostic techniques could facilitate faster and cost-effective control
   of the disease.},

Abstract = {The identification of milk microbial communities in ruminants is
   relevant for understanding the association between milk microbiota and
   health status. The most common approach for studying the microbiota is
   amplifying and sequencing specific hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA
   gene using massive sequencing techniques. However, the taxonomic
   resolution is limited to family and, in some cases, genus level. We
   aimed to improve taxonomic classification of the water buffalo milk
   microbiota by amplifying and sequencing the full-length 16S rRNA gene
   (1,500 bp) using Nanopore sequencing (single-molecule sequencing). When
   comparing with short-read results, we improved the taxonomic
   classification, reaching species level. We identified the main microbial
   agents of subclinical mastitis at the species level that were in
   accordance with the microbiological culture results. These results
   confirm the potential of single-molecule sequencing for in-depth
   analysis of microbial populations in dairy animals.},

Title = {Eco-Virological Preliminary Study of Potentially Emerging Pathogens in
   Hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) Recovered at a Wildlife Treatment and
   Rehabilitation Center in Northern Italy},

Abstract = {Simple Summary Most of the newly emerging infections arise from animal
   reservoirs, frequently represented by wildlife species. Western European
   hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) are mammalian hibernators, mainly
   nocturnal and insectivorous, living in natural open and green spaces as
   well as artificial, rural and urban, areas. They are generalist
   predators of macro-invertebrates, but they may also eat meat, bird eggs
   and on occasion pet food. These ecological and feeding habits, along
   with their high population densities, notable synanthropic attitudes,
   frequent contacts with sympatric wild and domestic species, including
   humans, implicate the possibility of intra- and interspecies
   interactions accounting for the possible involvement of E. europaeus in
   the ecology of several potentially emerging pathogens, including
   coronaviruses. Using PCR-based and virus isolation methods, we found
   that 58.3\% of 24 hedgehogs' fecal samples were PCR-positive for
   Erinaceus coronaviruses (EriCoVs). We did not observe any clinical
   disease related to the EriCoV infection in hedgehogs. However, the high
   mutation rates characterizing members of the Coronaviridae family and
   their potential successful interspecies host jumps-as that likely
   occurred in the Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emergence-should be
   considered in the management of hedgehogs admitted to multi-species
   wildlife rehabilitation centers, recommending their return back to the
   original recovery areas.
   Abstract The Western European Hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) is one of
   the four hedgehog species belonging to the genus Erinaceus. Among them,
   E. amurensis is extant in East Asia's areas only, whereas E. europaeus,
   E. roumanicus and E. concolor are mainly found in Europe. E. europaeus
   is endemically distributed from western to central and southern Europe,
   including Italy. Western European hedgehogs' ecological and feeding
   habits, along with their high population densities, notable synanthropic
   attitudes, frequent contacts with sympatric wild and domestic species,
   including humans, implicate the possible involvement of E. europaeus in
   the ecology of potentially emerging viruses, such as coronaviruses,
   influenza A and influenza D viruses, canine distemper virus,
   pestiviruses and Aujeszky's disease virus. We examined 24 E. europaeus
   individuals found injured in urban and rural areas of Northern Italy. Of
   the 24 fecal samples collected and tested for the above-mentioned
   pathogens by both PCR-based and virus isolation methods, 14 were found
   PCR-positive for betacoronaviruses belonging to lineage C and related to
   the known Erinaceus coronaviruses (EriCoVs), as determined by partial
   sequencing of the virus genome. Our findings suggest that hedgehogs
   could be considered natural reservoirs of CoVs, and also act as chronic
   shedding carriers of these potentially emerging RNA viruses.},

Title = {Comparison of Macrophage Responses to African Swine Fever Viruses

Abstract = {African swine fever (ASF) poses a severe threat to the global pig
   industry for which currently there is no available vaccine. The
   aetiological ASF virus (ASFV) has a predilection for cells of the
   myeloid lineage, however little is known about its interaction with
   polarised macrophages. This study focused on the in vitro interactions
   of porcine monocyte-derived un-activated (moM Phi), classically (moM1),
   alternatively (moM2), and IFN-alpha-activated macrophages with two
   genotype I ASFV strains: virulent 22653/14 and attenuated NH/P68. At a
   high multiplicity of infection, NH/P68, but not 22653/14, presented a
   reduced ability to infect moM1 and IFN-alpha-activated moM Phi compared
   to moM Phi. IFN-alpha activation resulted in a dose-dependent reduction
   in the proportion of ASFV-infected cells. Both strains replicated
   efficiently in all the subsets. While higher levels of IL-1 alpha, IL-1
   beta, and IL-18 were secreted by NH/P68-infected moM1 compared to
   22653/14, both strains negatively affected moM Phi ability to release
   IL-6, IL-12, TNF-alpha in response to classical activation or
   stimulation with a TLR2 agonist. Our results suggest that ASFV 22653/14
   covertly replicates in macrophages, compromising the development of
   effective immune responses. Attenuated NH/P68 has partially lost these
   mechanisms, which may enhance immune surveillance. A better understating
   of these mechanisms should aid the rational design of live attenuated
   ASFV vaccines.},

Abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most important pathogens causing
   mastitis in cattle, and it is responsible for economic losses in dairy
   herds worldwide. The PCR amplification of the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic
   spacer (ribosomal spacer PCR, RS-PCR) allows a rapid classification of
   the strains in genotypes and genotypic clusters (CL), which are
   characterized by different epidemiological and clinical properties. Both
   RS-PCR and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) were performed on strains
   isolated from bovine bulk tank milk (BTM) collected from dairy herds
   located in the Lombardy region (northern Italy), to outline the
   distribution of Staph. aureus genotypes in this geographical area. Out
   of 844 examined samples, 398 were positive for Staph. aureus, with a
   variable count (cfu/mL). Up to 8 colonies from each sample were
   genotyped. A total of 1,101 Staph. aureus strains were analyzed with
   RS-PCR, and only a selection of them (n = 86), in relation to their
   frequency and geographical origin, underwent MLST. This study revealed 8
   major genotypic clusters (CLB, CLC, CLR, CLS, CLI, CLF, CLAO, and CLZ),
   of which Staph. aureus CLB (29.3\%) was the most common. Samples of BTM
   positive for CLB had a Staph. aureus cfu/mL count significantly higher
   than the non-CLB positive ones. Our MLST analysis showed genotypes
   already known as bovine-associated in literature, such as clonal
   complexes CC8, CC97, and CC151. The same selection of 86 strains was
   also analyzed for the presence of the adlb genie, which was recently
   proposed as a possible marker of contagiousness. Most Staph. aureus
   belonging to CLB or CC8 carried the adlb gene (85\%), whereas this gene
   was detected in only 9\% of non-CLB strains (CLAA, CLBI, CLBJ, CLS). In
   conclusion, the present study confirms that Staph. aureus CLB, which is
   recognized as a contagious genotype, is a particularly relevant agent of
   intramammary infection in dairy cows in Lombardy, and indirectly
   supports the idea that adlb can be a possible marker of contagiousness
   of isolates.},

Title = {Evaluation of the Efficiency of Active and Passive Surveillance in the
   Detection of African Swine Fever in Wild Boar},
Journal = {VETERINARY SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {African swine fever (ASF) is one of the most severe diseases of pigs and
   has a drastic impact on pig industry. Wild boar populations play the
   role of ASF genotype II virus epidemiological reservoir. Disease
   surveillance in wild boar is carried out either by testing all the wild
   boar found sick or dead for virus detection (passive surveillance) or by
   testing for virus (and antibodies) all hunted wild boar (active
   surveillance). When virus prevalence and wild boar density are low as it
   happens close to eradication, the question on which kind of surveillance
   is more efficient in detecting the virus is still open. We built a
   simulation model to mimic the evolution of the host-parasite interaction
   in the European wild boar and to assess the efficiency of different
   surveillance strategies. We constructed a deterministic SIR model, which
   estimated the probability to detect the virus during the 8 years
   following its introduction, using both passive and active surveillance.
   Overall, passive surveillance provided a much larger number of ASF
   detections than active surveillance during the first year. During
   subsequent years, both active and passive surveillance exhibited a
   decrease in their probability to detect ASF. Such decrease, though, was
   more pronounced for passive surveillance. Under the assumption of 50\%
   of carcasses detection, active surveillance became the best detection
   method when the endemic disease prevalence was lower than 1.5\%, when
   hunting rate was >60\% and when population density was lower than 0.1
   individuals/km(2). In such a situation, though, the absolute probability
   to detect the disease was very low with both methods, and finding almost
   every carcass is the only way to ensure virus detection. The sensitivity
   analysis shows that carcass search effort is the sole parameter that
   increases proportionally the chance of ASF virus detection. Therefore,
   an effort should be made to promote active search of dead wild boar also
   in endemic areas, since reporting wild boar carcasses is crucial to
   understand the epidemiological situation in any of the different phases
   of ASF infection at any wild boar density.},

Abstract = {Introduction: The aim of this study was to present two outbreaks of
   bovine abortion due to Leptospira infection in cattle herds located in
   the northern part of Sicily (Italy). The animals were positive for
   Leptospira interrogans serogroup Sejroe serovar Hardjo in a microscopic
   agglutination test (MAT). Material and Methods: A total of 23 Charolaise
   cows (farm A) and 75 Limousine bulls and Cinisara and Modicana cows
   (farm B) were enrolled in this study. The blood samples were collected
   from all subjects at the following time points: before a cycle of
   intramuscular treatment with oxytetracycline dihydrate (T0), after 5-6
   weeks from the treatment (T1), and every 10 weeks until
   seronegativisation (T2 in Farm A and T3 in Farm B). A serological test
   (MAT) was used for the diagnosis of leptospirosis. Results: Two samples
   from farm A (2/23) and 29 samples from farm B (29/75) were positive to
   Leptospira interrogans, serogroup Sejroe, serovar Hardjo in the MAT.
   Leptospira spp. DNA was detected by real-time PCR in the urine sample of
   one positive cow on farm A, and in placenta and brain samples belonging
   to one aborted foetus on farm B. Conclusion: It is important to use
   serological and molecular diagnostic techniques complementarily to
   identify infected individuals.},

Title = {Animal welfare and microbiological safety of poultry meat: Impact of
   different at-farm animal welfare levels on at-slaughterhouse
   Campylobacter and Salmonella contamination},
Journal = {FOOD CONTROL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {109},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Stress factors and poor animal welfare can increase the susceptibility
   of food-producing animals to diseases, posing microbial risks to
   consumers. Animal welfare levels, objectively measured with the
   application of the Welfare Quality (R), protocol, were assessed in
   thirteen broiler flocks, including organic ones, to evaluate the
   presence of statistically significant differences in relation to
   Campylobacter and Salmonella faecal shedding and consequent
   microbiological contamination of broiler carcases at slaughterhouse.
   Each flock underwent animal welfare evaluation the day before
   slaughtering, followed by Campylobacter and Salmonella detection in
   faeces (caecal content) and neck skin at slaughterhouse. A total of 1040
   samples (520 caecal contents; 520 neck skins) were included in the
   study. Campylobacter enumeration and Salmonella serotyping were also
   carried out. The highest welfare scores were reported in organic flocks.
   Significantly lower Campylobacter concentrations both in caecal content
   and neck skins (P < 0.05) were reported in organic batches, compared to
   high welfare conventional batches. Low-welfare batches showed higher
   prevalence of Salmonella both in neck skins and caecal content, with a
   statistically significant difference compared to high-welfare batches
   (43.6\% versus 2.9\% in neck skins; 19.3\% versus 0\% in caecal content;
   P < 0.00001). Salmonella Infantis and Salmonella Bredeney were the most
   common serotypes, while Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli were
   the detected species.
   This study provides new evidence that high animal welfare standards at
   farms, other than an ethical issue and a value-add for the end product,
   could also improve the microbiological safety of poultry meat,
   ultimately contributing to the protection of consumers.},

Title = {Further Evidence of Inadequate Quality in Lateral Flow Devices
   Commercially Offered for the Diagnosis of Rabies},
Journal = {TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE},
Year = {2020},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {As a neglected zoonotic disease, rabies causes approximately 5.9 x 10(4)
   human deaths annually, primarily affecting low- and middle-income
   countries in Asia and Africa. In those regions, insufficient
   surveillance is hampering adequate medical intervention and is driving
   the vicious cycle of neglect. Where resources to provide laboratory
   disease confirmation are limited, there is a need for user-friendly and
   low-cost reliable diagnostic tools that do not rely on specialized
   laboratory facilities. Lateral flow devices (LFD) offer an alternative
   to conventional diagnostic methods and may strengthen control efforts in
   low-resource settings. Five different commercially available LFDs were
   compared in a multi-centered study with respect to their diagnostic
   sensitivity and their agreement with standard rabies diagnostic
   techniques. Our evaluation was conducted by several international
   reference laboratories using a broad panel of samples. The overall
   sensitivities ranged from 0\% up to 62\%, depending on the LFD
   manufacturer, with substantial variation between the different
   laboratories. Samples with high antigen content and high relative viral
   load tended to test positive more often in the Anigen/Bionote test, the
   latter being the one with the best performance. Still, the overall
   unsatisfactory findings corroborate a previous study and indicate a
   persistent lack of appropriate test validation and quality control. At
   present, the tested kits are not suitable for in-field use for rabies
   diagnosis, especially not for suspect animals where human contact has
   been identified, as an incorrect negative diagnosis may result in human
   casualties. This study points out the discrepancy between the enormous
   need for such a diagnostic tool on the one hand, and on the other hand,
   a number of already existing tests that are not yet ready for use.},

Abstract = {Pigs are very important for the epidemiology of influenza A viruses,
   being commonly infected with the lineages of most adapted H1N1, H3N2,
   H1N2 swine subtypes. Epidemiological complexity of swine influenza is
   increasing by a periodic spillover of human or avian viruses in the pig
   population when genetic shifts can occur. The objectives of this
   research were to determine the presence of the influenza A virus in
   nasal and tracheobronchial swabs and lung tissue samples of ill and dead
   pigs on commercial farms, to determine circulating subtypes and
   characterize them through the phylogenetic analysis of hemagglutinin
   (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes. A total of 255 samples collected from
   13 farms were analyzed by means of real-time RTPCR. The genome of
   influenza A virus was detected in 24 samples, which represented a 61.5\%
   prevalence at the farms level (influenza A virus was confirmed in 8 out
   of 13 farms included in this study). Based on HA and NA gene sequences
   of 8 viruses, the circulation of H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes of influenza A
   viruses were determined. In addition, one farm exhibited a time
   separated circulation of H1N1 and H3N2 virus subtypes. Using Influenza
   Research Database, our viruses of the H1 subtype were classified into
   1C.2.1 and 1A.3.3.2. Glade. Based on the nucleotide sequences of HA
   genes, three viruses of the H1N1 subtype belong to the H1N1pdm09
   lineage, and the other four to Eurasian ``avian-like{''} H1avN1 lineage;
   while based on NA genes sequences, these seven viruses belong to
   Eurasian ``avian-like{''} H1avN1 lineage. Both HA and NA genes of the
   virus of the H3N2 subtype belonged to the A/swine/Gent/1/1984-like H3N2
   lineage.},

Title = {Canine vector-borne pathogens from dogs and ticks from Tamil Nadu, India},
Journal = {ACTA TROPICA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {203},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Canine vector-borne diseases (CVBDs) pose a major health problem in dogs
   globally, with the potential to cause zoonoses, in particular in
   developing countries where scientific knowledge on the topic is minimal.
   Blood samples and ticks were collected from stray dogs in Tamil Nadu,
   South India to assess the prevalence of CVBDcausing pathogens (Anaplasma
   spp., Babesia spp., Ehrlichia spp., Hepatozoon spp., filarioids and
   Leishmania spp.). Of the 230 dogs examined, 229 (99.6\%) were infested
   by ticks (mean intensity, 5.65) with Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato
   and Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides being morphologically identified in
   the 98.3\% and 1.7\% of the infested dogs, respectively. Overall, the
   67.8\% (n = 156) of dogs was positive for at least one pathogen with
   Hepatozoon canis being the most prevalent (37.8\%) followed by Anaplasma
   platys (22.6\%), Ehrlichia canis (16.1\%) Babesia vogeli (10\%),
   Anaplasma phagocytophilum (0.4\%) and Babesia gibsoni (0.4\%). Two
   filarioids (Dirofilaria sp. ``hongkongensis{''} and Brugia malayi,
   0.4\%) were diagnosed in sampled animals. Co-infection with H. canis and
   A. platys was the most prevalent (8.3\%, P = 0.00001), whilst all
   animals scored negative for Leishmania spp.. Out of 295 ticks analysed,
   215 R. sanguineus s.l. (75.4\%) and 8 R. haemaphysaloides (88.9\%) were
   positive for at least one pathogen with H. canis as the predominant
   species (42.5\%), followed by A. platys (33.8\%), E. canis (16.9\%), B.
   vogeli (3.8\%) and A. phagocytophilum (0.3\%). Fifty-six dogs (35.9\%)
   harboured the same pathogen as the respective tick specimens, while 29
   dogs (18.6\%) had a different pathogen. Thirteen sequence types (STs)
   were identified for H. canis, with ST2 (49.4\%) as the most
   representative in dogs and ST1 (73.5\%) in ticks. Similarly, seven STs
   were found for Anaplasma spp. (i.e., five for A. platys, one for A.
   phagocytophilum and one for Anaplasma sp.), with ST2 as the most
   representative in dogs (70.6\%) and ST3 (52.5\%) in ticks for A. platys.
   Only one ST was identified for B. vogeli, B. gibsoni, E. canis, D. sp.
   ``hongkongensis{''} and B. malayi. Regular surveillance and adoption of
   adequate treatment and control measures are needed to reduce the risk of
   disease-causing pathogens in stray dogs and of pathogens with zoonotic
   potential.},

Abstract = {We report the first case of Acipenser iridovirus European (AcIV-E)
   infection in starry sturgeon (Acipenser stellatus) and in sterlet (A.
   ruthenus) reared in Northern Italy. During 2018, mortality began in A.
   stellatus and A. ruthenus specimens reared in co-habitation with Russian
   sturgeon positive for AcIV-E. Molecular analyses were done on the gills
   to amplify a fragment of the major capsid protein (MCP) gene using
   real-time PCR against AcIV-E. DNA of the positive samples was further
   sequenced and phylogenetic analyses were performed. The MCP gene
   sequences were highly similar to a virus previously identified in Italy
   (nucleotide identities between 99.38\% and 99.69\%). Phylogenetic
   analysis confirmed our hypothesis of passage of the virus from the
   infected Russian sturgeon. The detection of AcIV-E in new species of the
   Acipenseridae family may impact on sturgeon production, with relevant
   economic losses.},

Title = {Seroprevalence of foot-and-mouth disease virus in cattle herds raised in
   Maasai Mara ecosystem in Kenya},
Journal = {PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {176},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A cross-sectional study was carried out to determine foot-and-mouth
   disease (FMD) seroprevalence and identify risk factors of exposure among
   cattle herds raised in three zones with different types of land use and
   progressively distant from the Maasai Mara National Reserve (MMNR)
   boundary. We selected five villages purposively; two in zone 1 (area <
   20 km from the MMNR), another two in zone 2 (area between 20-40 km away
   from the MMNR) and one in zone 3 (area > 40 km away from the MMNR). A
   total of 1170 cattle sera were collected from 390 herds in all the zones
   and tested for antibodies against the non-structural proteins (NSPs) of
   FMD virus (FMDV) using two 3ABC-based Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
   ELISA kits. All sera samples were also screened for serotype-specific
   antibodies using Solid Phase Competitive ELISA (SPCE) kits (IZSLER,
   Italy). We targeted FMDV serotypes A, O, South African Territory {[}SAT]
   1 and SAT 2, known to be endemic in East Africa including Kenya. Data on
   putative risk factors for FMD seropositivity in cattle were collected
   using a questionnaire. The overall apparent animal-level FMD
   seroprevalence based on the parallel comparison of the two anti-NSPs
   ELISA kits was 83.8 \% (95 \% CI; 81.8-85.9), and differed significantly
   across zones. Zone 1 had a higher seroprevalence than zones 2 and 3
   (chi(2) = 116.1, df = 2, p < 0.001). In decreasing order, the overall
   seroprevalences of FMDV serotypes A, SAT 2, O and SAT 1 were 26.3 \% (95
   \% CI; 23.5-29.2), 21.4 \% (95 \% CI; 18.8-24.0), 21.2 \% (95 \% CI;
   18.7-23.9) and 13.1 \% (95 \% CI; 11.1-15.3), respectively. The
   distribution of these serotypes differed significantly between zones (p
   < 0.05) except for SAT 2 serotype (chi(2) = 0.90, df = 2, p = 0.639).
   Both serotypes A and O were more prevalent in zones 1 and 2 than zone 3
   while serotype SAT 1, was higher in zone 3 compared to other zones. The
   results of multivariable analyses identified animal sex (i.e., female),
   raising of cattle in zones 1 and 2 (areas < 40 km away from the MMNR);
   mixing of cattle from multiple herds at watering points, and pastoral
   husbandry practices, as significant predictors of animal-level FMD
   seropositivity. This study established that FMD seroprevalence declined
   with distance from the MMNR.},

   datasets},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {56},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In recent years, meteo-climatic changes contributed to the geographical
   expansion and modifications of habitat that become more suitable to
   phlebotomine vectors. Among these vectors, the role of Sergentomyia
   minuta in the circulation of mammalian leishmaniases has been recently
   discussed. Here we apply a neural network model (specifically developed
   for modelling relationships among variables in small datasets) to
   estimate the population abundance of S. minuta starting from
   meteo-climatic variables only, during three capturing seasons
   (2014-2016) in an Italian site. The results show that we are able to
   explain a wide majority of the variance in the data of population
   density (R-2 = 0.632). This is obtained through the application of a
   neural model driven in input by averaged mean temperature, relative
   humidity and temperature at 10 cm belowground during oviposition, larval
   and adult stages, A modelling pruning activity shows the major role of
   humidity in driving the number of captures, but also an important
   nonlinear role of temperature, which highlights the importance of
   possible heat waves on population density of S. minuta.},

Title = {Yersinia enterocolitica-specific modulation of innate immune responses
   in jejunal epithelial cells},
Journal = {VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {242},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Gut is often subject to infection by different pathogens like Y.
   enterocolitica. To date, biotypes (BTs) 1A have been considered as
   non-pathogenic, because they do not express plasmid of virulence pYV;
   however, BTs 1A strains present other chromosomic virulence genes and
   recent studies suggest an implication of this microorganism in reactive
   arthritis. Although many studies highlighted the molecular basis of
   pathogenesis of Ye infection, scanty data are available about several
   environmental BTs 1A strains, often isolated in cases of foodborne
   disease but not included in pathogenicity studies. The aim of our work
   was to verify the ability of different Ye 1A strains to adhere and
   penetrate IPEC-J2 cells and to modulate intestinal innate immunity. Our
   results showed that all strains under study were able to adhere and
   penetrate enterocytes, causing inflammatory responses. Indeed, adhesion
   and invasion of enterocytes is an essential step in Ye pathogenesis
   (Fabrega and Vila, 2012). Moreover, our data suggest the possible
   involvement of strains Ye2/O:9 in reactive arthritis, due to their
   ability (i) to penetrate enterocytes as pathogenic Ye1/O:8 strains do,
   and (ii) to increase IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 and IL-18 release. Lastly, our
   results confirm that IPEC-J2 cells are a very good model to evaluate
   host-pathogen interaction, and indicate IL-8, TNF-alpha, TLRs1 and 4 as
   possible markers of the ability of Ye strains to penetrate enterocytes.
   Moreover, we showed that Ye strains differently affect the host's innate
   immune responses.},

Title = {Experimental Infection of Mid-Gestation Pregnant Female and Intact Male
   Sheep with Zika Virus},
Journal = {VIRUSES-BASEL},
Year = {2020},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus that causes birth defects, persistent
   male infection, and sexual transmission in humans. The purpose of this
   study was to continue the development of an ovine ZIKV infection model;
   thus, two experiments were undertaken. In the first experiment, we built
   on previous pregnant sheep experiments by developing a mid-gestation
   model of ZIKV infection. Four pregnant sheep were challenged with ZIKV
   at 57-64 days gestation; two animals served as controls. After 13-15
   days (corresponding with 70-79 days of gestation), one control and two
   infected animals were euthanized; the remaining animals were euthanized
   at 20-22 days post-infection (corresponding with 77-86 days of
   gestation). In the second experiment, six sexually mature, intact, male
   sheep were challenged with ZIKV and two animals served as controls.
   Infected animals were serially euthanized on days 2-6 and day 9
   post-infection with the goal of isolating ZIKV from the male
   reproductive tract. In the mid-gestation study, virus was detected in
   maternal placenta and spleen, and in fetal organs, including the brains,
   spleens/liver, and umbilicus of infected fetuses. Fetuses from infected
   animals had visibly misshapen heads and morphometrics revealed
   significantly smaller head sizes in infected fetuses when compared to
   controls. Placental pathology was evident in infected dams. In the male
   experiment, ZIKV was detected in the spleen, liver, testes/epididymides,
   and accessory sex glands of infected animals. Results from both
   experiments indicate that mid-gestation ewes can be infected with ZIKV
   with subsequent disruption of fetal development and that intact male
   sheep are susceptible to ZIKV infection and viral dissemination and
   replication occurs in highly vascular tissues (including those of the
   male reproductive tract).},

Abstract = {Simple Summary Replacing antibiotics with natural alternative compounds
   in poultry feeding is being increased in the last few years to challenge
   the antibiotic resistance problem. Among natural compounds, organic
   acids and essential oils could be a favorable option. The goal of the
   trial was testing the dietary supplementation of a blend of organic
   acids and essential oils in broiler diets in order to evaluate growth
   performance and gut healthiness. The blend of organic acids and
   essential oils improved growth performances at the end of the growing
   period and favorably affected, to a certain extent, gut morphology at
   different gut districts. Moreover, a selective microbial control against
   Clostridium perfringens, Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococci and Mesophilic
   bacteria was found. Additionally, in litter, organic acids and essential
   oils dietary treatment drove to an overall decrease of Mesophilic
   bacteria and Enterococci counts. Overall, dietary strategy oriented to a
   supplementation of a mixture of organic acids and essential oils in
   broiler diets could offer some favorable perspectives in order to
   maintain adequate growth performance and gut healthiness either in term
   of morphology or of microbiology. Nevertheless, improving knowledge on
   the mechanisms of action of these natural additives together with a
   potential synergistic action is pivotal to clarify their potential as
   antibiotic replacers.
   Abstract The goal of the trial was testing the effects of a blend of
   organic acids and essential oils dietary supplementation on growth
   performance and gut healthiness in broiler chickens. In total, 420 male
   Ross 308 chicks (1-day old) were randomly assigned to two dietary
   treatments: basal (BD) and organic acids and essential oils (OA\&EO)
   diets (three replicates/treatment; 70 broilers/replicate). BD group
   received commercial diets whereas OA\&EO group basal diets + 5 g/kg of
   microencapsulated organic acids and essential oils. OA\&EO treatment
   improved the average daily gain (p < 0.01) and feed conversion ratio at
   37-47 days compared to BD treatment. OA\&EO treatment improved gut
   morphology mostly at ileum and duodenum levels in terms of villi height,
   crypt depth, number of villi, mucosa thickness and villi area at 24 and
   34 sampling days. A certain selective action against Clostridium
   perfringens in ileum of OA\&EO group was shown at 33 (p = 0.053) and 46
   days (p = 0.09) together with lower median values for
   Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococci, Mesophilic bacteria and Clostridium
   perfringens at ceca level. Overall, organic acids and essential oils
   supplementation improved growth performance in the final growth stage
   and some morphological gut traits and reduced to a certain extent
   Clostridium perfringens count in ileum.},

Abstract = {Simple Summary Quantifying antimicrobial use (AMU) in livestock using
   dose-based methods is useful for identifying potential risk factors
   related to AMU and to promote responsible AMU. Herewith, we investigated
   the temporal patterns and effects of several structural and management
   factors on AMU in a sample of pig farms in northern Italy during a
   period of three years. Overall, AMU showed a large variability between
   farms and no significantly decreasing trend. However, in several farms,
   a significant AMU reduction of up to two-thirds was observed. Farm size,
   number of farm workers, air quality, average pig mortality, and presence
   of pigs with undocked tails on the farm had no significant effect on
   AMU, whereas higher welfare standards were significantly associated with
   lower AMU.
   Abstract The analysis of antimicrobial use (AMU) data in livestock
   allows for the identification of risk factors for AMU, thereby favoring
   the application of responsible AMU policies on-farm. Herewith, AMU in 36
   finishing pig farms in northern Italy from 2015-2017 was expressed as
   defined daily doses for Italian pigs (DDDita) per population correction
   unit (DDDita/100kg). A retrospective analysis was then conducted to
   determine the effects of several husbandry practices on AMU. Overall,
   AMU ranged between 12 DDDita/100kg in 2015 and 8 DDDita/100kg in 2017,
   showing no significant trends, due to the large variability in AMU
   between farms. However, a 66\% AMU reduction was observed in 19 farms
   during 2015-2017. Farm size, number of farm workers, air quality,
   average pig mortality, and presence of undocked pigs on the farm had no
   significant effects on AMU. Rather, welfare-friendly farms had 38\%
   lower AMU levels (p < 0.05). In conclusion, animal welfare management
   seems to be relatively more important than farm structure and other
   managerial characteristics as drivers of AMU in finishing pig farms.},

Title = {Validation of Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) Field Tool
   for Rapid and Sensitive Diagnosis of Contagious Agalactia in Small
   Ruminants},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2020},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Contagious agalactia (CA) is an infectious disease of
   small ruminants endemic in the Mediterranean countries, causing
   significant socioeconomic impacts predominantly on small-scale farmers
   who still subsist on marginal lands. Mycoplasma agalactiae is
   historically considered the principal etiological agent of CA,
   especially in sheep. Clinical signs are characterised by mastitis,
   arthritis, keratoconjunctivitis and occasionally, abortion. Rapid,
   accurate and cost-effective field tests are urgently needed for
   effective control of M. agalactiae mastitis. Our study illustrated the
   validation of a Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) test for
   the detection of M. agalactiae in dairy sheep in order to confirm its
   application as a diagnostic tool in the field level.
   Abstract Contagious agalactia (CA), an infectious disease of small
   ruminants, caused by Mycoplasma agalactiae, is responsible for severe
   losses to dairy sheep production with substantial socioeconomic impacts
   on small-scale farmers. The diagnosis of CA is still problematic,
   time-consuming and requires well-equipped labs for confirmation of
   outbreaks. Therefore, rapid, accurate and cost-effective diagnostic
   tests are urgently needed. This work aims to validate a novel
   Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) test, based on the p40
   target gene, for the detection of M. agalactiae in dairy sheep in order
   to confirm its potential practical use as a rapid and cheap field test.
   The LAMP system proposed in this study consists of a portable device
   composed of real-time fluorometer with the automatic interpretation of
   results displayed in a tablet. A total of 110 milk samples (90 positives
   and 20 negatives) were analysed to optimise the analysis procedure and
   to investigate the efficacy and robustness of the LAMP method. All
   samples were analysed using LAMP and conventional real-time PCR to
   compare the diagnostic sensitivity of the methods. The sensitivity of
   the LAMP was 10-fold higher than that of real-time PCR, with a detection
   limit up to 10(3) CFU/ml. The LAMP assay was able to detect M.
   agalactiae in 81 of 90 (90\%, 95\%CI 0.84-0.96) positive milk samples
   compared to 69 (77\%, 95\%CI 0.59-0.95) positive samples detected by
   real-time PCR; no positive signal occurred for any of the negative milk
   samples in either test. Therefore, the LAMP assay was found to be more
   sensitive than real-time PCR, low-cost, easy to perform, fast and not
   affected by contamination, indicating its potential as an effective
   diagnostic tool in the field level for the diagnosis of CA.},

Abstract = {The prevalence data of Leishmania infantum infection in cats are
   characterized by a large variability mainly attributed to the
   differences in diagnostic techniques. In the absence of consensus about
   the method of choice for diagnosing feline leishmaniosis, the
   performance of a new immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) was herein
   analytically described by the comparison with IFAT commonly used for the
   diagnosis of canine leishmaniosis (i.e., IFAT-OIE) and a laboratory
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Sera of cats living in
   visceral leishmaniosis-endemic (n = 105) and visceral
   leishmaniosis-non-endemic (n = 50) areas were tested by the above
   methodologies and real-time PCR (qPCR). The most frequent result was
   represented by triple negativity to the three tests (IFAT-OIE, ELISA,
   and qPCR) in 42.9\% and 80\% cats from endemic and non-endemic areas,
   respectively. Bayes latent class analysis gave an output probability of
   34.1\% (posterior standard deviation, psd = 5.4\%) of true L. infantum
   cases (TCL) which represent the true estimated prevalence of infection.
   The sensitivity of each variable contributing to define the TCL was 24\%
   (psd = 6.3\%) for qPCR, 78.8\% (psd = 8.7\%) for ELISA and 91.8\% (psd =
   5.2\%) for IFAT-OIE. The probability to be a TCL was 94.5\% for the
   sample from an endemic area. The cross-validation of the new IFAT by a
   logistic model correctly identified as positive 80.7\% of subjects
   defined as TCL and negative 89.9\% as not TCL, respectively, by the
   Bayesian model. The study results estimate a good accuracy of the IFAT
   in predicting cats exposed to L. infantum. Therefore, this procedure may
   be beneficial for screening cat populations for a better understanding
   of the epidemiology of feline leishmaniosis.},

Abstract = {The genetic discrimination between phylogenetically close taxa can be
   challenging if their gene pools are not differentiated and there are
   many shared polymorphisms. The gene flow between wild boar (Sus scrofa)
   and domestic pig (S. s. domesticus) has never been interrupted from
   domestication onwards, due to non-stop natural and human-mediated
   crossbreeding. To date there are no individual genetic markers that are
   able to distinguish between the two forms, nor even to identify
   effectively their hybrids. We developed a combined molecular protocol
   based on multiplex porcine-specific STR-profiling system and new real
   time PCR-based assays of single polymorphisms in the NR6A1 and MC1R
   genes to gain high diagnostic power in the differentiation of wild boar,
   pig and hybrids for forensic purposes. The combined approach correctly
   assigned individuals to one or the other parental gene pool and
   identified admixed genotypes. Evidence was found for substantial
   reduction of false negative results by using multiple marker systems
   jointly, compared to their use individually. Our protocol is a powerful
   and costeffective diagnostic tool that can easily be adopted by most
   forensic laboratories to assist authorities contrast food adulteration,
   assure veterinary public health and fight against wildlife crimes, like
   poaching and illegal detention of wild animals.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted to evaluate the use of Brucellergene skin test
   (BST) for the diagnosis of Brucellosis in camels (Camelus dromedarius)
   in comparison with Rose Bengal test (RBT) and competitive enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA). A total of 68 apparently healthy adult
   dromedary camels of either gender from three different geographical
   locations of Abu Dhabi Emirate, United Arab Emirates (UAE), were
   included in the study. The skin test was applied on two shaved areas at
   the middle of the neck: one for the test and the other area was injected
   with normal saline as a control. Reading was done 72 h postinjection.
   Results were subjected to Bayesian analysis to assess the test
   performances in camels. The model estimated the following sensitivity
   and specificity median values: BST: Se = 70.72\%, Sp = 98.82\%; RBT: Se
   = 93.27\%, Sp = 97.79\%; and c-ELISA: Se = 94.78\%, Sp = 98.48\%. As the
   BST investigated in this study proved to be a highly specific test, we
   propose using it as a confirmatory test in camels particularly when the
   serological tests give doubtful results on individual animals.},

Abstract = {A feeding study was carried out to investigate the kinetics in cow milk
   of the 17 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs),
   the 12 dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs), and the 6

   TEQ/clay/cow; Sigma NDL-PCBs: 163.99 mu g/day/cow) was given to the
   animals for 49 days, followed by 42 days on clean feed. EU maximum limit
   for TEQPCDD/F+DL-PCB was exceeded in milk after 1 week of exposure,
   while for Sigma NDL-PCBs, after 5 weeks. Milk compliance was restored
   after 1 week on clean feed, but to return to the basal TEOPCDD/F+DL-PCB
   it took 42 days. At the end of the study, Sigma NDL-PCBs had not yet
   reached the basal level. The carryover rate of Sigma NDL-PCBs was
   25.4\%, while the carryover rate of TEOPCDD/F+DL-PCB was 36.9\%. The
   latter was mainly affected by the 12 congeners contributing most to the
   toxic equivalent (TEQ) level, explaining the fast overcome of the

Abstract = {This preliminary study describes the use of high resolution and accuracy
   mass spectrometry techniques combined with new generation chemical
   software products for detecting and identifying contaminants in food
   commodities. As a first step, the extracts of routine target analysis
   samples (obtained in our official laboratory responsible for food
   residues control) were acquired and processed with this method in order
   to search unknown and non-targeted contaminants in food. In order to
   verify the feasibility of the presented method, the research has been
   firstly addressed to untargeted pesticides and their metabolites in
   stone fruits commodities and tomatoes. The differential analysis carried
   with Compound Discoverer 2.0 between the investigated unknown sample and
   the blank matrix sample allowed to remove all the matrix molecular
   components; Aggregated Computational Toxicology Resource (ACToR) helped
   to understand and predict chemical interpretation of substances. The
   acquisition in FullScan-AIF and FullScan-ddMS2 allowed the clear
   detection and identification of isobaric compounds such as quinalphos
   and phoxim. In order to verify that the proposed method is suitable to
   the scope of application, the main points of SANTE/11813/2017 Document
   have been followed. The results demonstrate that no false positives and
   no false negatives have been detected from the analysis of samples
   spiked with 55 pesticides at 0.010 and 0.10 mg kg(-1). This preliminary
   study has been also tested with a Proficiency Test (EUPT-FV-SM08) and,
   according to EUPT-FV-SM08 Final Report, our laboratory has been included
   in the 67\% (56) that clearly detected over 70\% pesticides. Finally,
   this method has been extended to other matrices and contaminants.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to validate the method for detection and
   quantification of fipronil and fipronil sulphone in meat products and
   study the effects of these pollutants on meat nutritional quality. The
   determination coefficients (R-2) of the analytes were 0.999, while
   intra-laboratory CV\% for repeatability and reproducibility ranged from
   0.83\% to 19.19\%. Meat nutritional quality was assessed before and
   after the addition of analytes in meat samples. Both total and essential
   amino acids in meat decreased (P < 0.001) with increasing levels of
   added analytes, suggesting their detrimental effect on meat amino acid
   composition. The amino acid composition of meat did not show an univocal
   behaviour as consequence of fipronil and fipronil sulphone addition. In
   particular, aspartate, glutamate, arginine (P < 0.05), threonine,
   alanine, lysine and proline (P < 0.001) showed a significant decrease
   with increasing levels of added analytes, while serine (P < 0.001)
   evidenced an opposite trend.},

Title = {Updates on Ecology and Life Cycle of Sulcascaris sulcata (Nematoda:

   Infecting Edible Scallops},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {FEB 14},
Abstract = {Sulcascaris sulcata is a nematode parasite of sea turtles, widespread in
   neritic foraging grounds with variable prevalence, reaching 30\% in
   loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta feeding in northern Adriatic Sea.
   Ulcerative gastritis associated to high intensity of infection is
   reported in this host species. The life cycle of S. sulcata has been
   elucidated in Australian and American waters, demonstrating the ability
   of the species of infecting a wide range of intermediate hosts,
   represented by bivalve and gastropod molluscs. During regular sanitary
   inspections, nematode larvae were found within the adductor muscle of
   Pecten jacobeus and Aequipecten opercularis collected from the Northern
   Adriatic Sea. Morphological and molecular analyses were performed for
   the identification of larvae, and molecular data were obtained from
   adult S. sulcata as well. Analysis of the sequences of ITS fragment, and
   mitochondrial genes cox1 and cox2, revealed high genetic similarity
   among all the samples, and no geographical clustering was observed
   between adult parasites collected in Adriatic and Tyrrhenian Seas. A
   common allele pool was detected also between the two developmental
   stages, included larvae from Pecten and Aequipecten. The comparison with
   other members of the family Anisakidae demonstrated that S. sulcata
   formed a clear monophyletic cluster. This study reports the first
   identification of intermediate hosts for S. sulcata within the
   Mediterranean Sea. Infection in edible scallops justifies the exclusion
   of the product from the market and zoonotic potential of larvae of this
   anisakid nematode are yet to be completely excluded. Fidelity of sea
   turtles to selected foraging grounds, such as the Northern Adriatic
   shelf, warrants the life cycle of S. sulcata to perpetrate in the area;
   at the same time, long distance migrations of individuals justify the
   dispersal of infecting elements over the Mediterranean basin, regardless
   of turtles' origin.},

Abstract = {Following the Mass Mortality Events (MMEs) of the pen shell P. nobilis
   in Campania region and Sicily, a survey of moribund P. nobilis specimens
   was also conducted in other Italian regions (Campania, Tuscany,
   Sardinia, and Apulia) and Spain (Catalunya). Histopathological and
   molecular examination of 27 specimens of P. nobils revealed different
   types of pathogens associated with tissue lesions, morbidity and
   mortality. Presence of Mycobacterium, Vibrio species, Haplosporidium
   pinnae and Perkinsus sp. were detected, differently distributed into the
   areas. The Mycobacterium sp., previously reported in Campania and Sicily
   samples, was observed in all the analyzed areas and individuals,
   associated to systemic inflammatory lesions. In Spain, H. pinnae was
   observed in 36\% of cases, always associated to the Mycobacterium sp.
   Molecular study using hsp65 genes and Internal Transcriber Spacer ITS
   support that a new species of Mycobacteria is infecting P. nobilis,
   close to M. triplex and belonging to the group of M. simiae complex with
   M. sherrisi. Presence of Perkinsus spp. resembling P. mediterraneus was
   observed in 2 out of 13 Italian individuals whose presence should be
   addressed as potential risk for shellfish aquaculture of the area.
   Vibrio spp. were also detected in some case. The preliminary results of
   this study suggest that Mycobacterium sp., Vibrio spp., H. pinnae and
   Perkinsus sp. cooperate to disease pathogenesis, being Mycobacterium and
   Haplosporidium most of the time involved. Vigilant inspection of those
   areas where MME is now starting, along with continuous systematic
   surveys, are crucial to define the spatiotemporal progress of mortality
   and the role of every single pathogen in the disease outcome.},

Abstract = {The family Picornaviridae includes important human and animal pathogens
   that are associated with a wide range of diseases and, in some cases,
   have zoonotic potential. During epidemiological surveillance of bats, we
   identified, by next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, the presence
   of picornavirus RNA in a common pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus
   pipistrellus). By coupling NGS, primer-walking strategies, and
   sequence-independent protocols to obtain the sequences of the 5 ` and 3
   ` termini, we reconstructed the genome sequence of picornavirus strain
   ITA/2017/189/18-155. The genome of the bat picornavirus is 8.2 kb in
   length and encodes a polyprotein of 2462 amino acids. A comparison of
   polyprotein sequences revealed that this virus is distantly related
   (65.1\% and 70.9\% sequence identity at the nucleotide and amino acid
   level, respectively) to a bat aichivirus identified in 2010.
   Phylogenetic analysis showed that this picornavirus clustered closely
   with members of the genus Kobuvirus, which also includes human and
   animal aichiviruses. The identification of aichiviruses in several
   animal hosts is providing hints that will lead to an understanding of
   their origin and evolutionary patterns.},

Abstract = {Background The Spirorchiidae is a family of blood flukes parasitizing
   turtles. Spirorchiids may cause a wide range of inflammatory reactions
   in the vascular system of their host being frequently implicated with
   stranding and death of sea turtles worldwide. Recent studies revealed
   the presence of two spirorchiid species in the Mediterranean basin. Our
   study presents comparative epidemiological data of spirorchiid
   infections in loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) stranded during an
   eight-year period from Adriatic and Tyrrhenian Seas, and the first
   report of Neospirorchis Neogen-11 in a green turtle (Chelonia mydas).
   Methods We screened a total of 319 carcasses of loggerhead turtles
   stranded from January 2011 to December 2018 along the Tyrrhenian coast
   (n = 111) and the north-western Adriatic coast (n = 208) of Italy using
   traditional (copromicroscopy and histopathology) and molecular assays.
   Three green turtles from the Tyrrhenian coast were also included in the
   study. Results A total of 56 (17.5\%) loggerhead turtles and one green
   turtle (33.3\%) were found to be infected with spirorchiid flukes.
   Amplification, sequencing of the ITS2 region of the ribosomal RNA gene
   cluster and BLAST analysis confirmed the presence of Hapalotrema
   mistroides and Neospirorchis Neogen-11 in 51 (16.0\%) and 24 (7.5\%)
   loggerhead turtles, respectively, and Neospirorchis Neogen-11 in an
   infected green turtle. Differences in prevalence of infection between
   the two sampling areas were found. Conclusions The risk of spirorchiid
   infection in the Tyrrhenian Sea is lower than in the Adriatic Sea and in
   general the risk of infection in the Mediterranean is lower than in
   other geographical locations. Differences in the prevalence of infection
   between the two sampling areas were related to the differences of
   regional habitats supporting different abundance of spirorchiid
   intermediate hosts. A systematic monitoring to evaluate the progress of
   the infection is recommended, as well as studies on the occurrence and
   distribution of spirorchiid species from other Mediterranean areas.},

Abstract = {Classical Swine Fever (CSF) is an endemic disease in Cuba, and an
   eradication strategy by zones is planned by the Official Veterinary
   Service. The aim of this study was to identify high-risk areas of CSF
   and the risk factors associated with the disease occurrence in the Pinar
   del Rio province, one of the prioritized areas in the eradication
   strategy. The outbreak occurrence at district level was analyzed through
   a 7-year period (2009 to 2015). A high-risk cluster (RR = 5.13, 95\% CI
   3.49-7.56) was detected during the last 2 years of the study period in
   the eastern half of the province, with 38 out of 97 districts included.
   The rate of CSF-affected holdings had a significant increase during
   2014-2015 and seems to have occurred mainly in the high-risk cluster
   area. Swine population density by district (heads/km(2)) and road length
   (km) by district were associated with the disease outbreak occurrence.
   These results provide new insights into the knowledge of the
   epidemiology of the disease in Cuban endemic conditions and can
   contribute to improving the control and the eradication strategy in this
   situation.},

Abstract = {The concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in soils
   from Caserta provincial territory, southern Italy, were systematically
   investigated along with their correlations with soil properties and
   health risk. The concentrations of Sigma(16)PAHs ranged from 10.0 to
   4191 ng/g, with a median (1 st quartile, Qi; 3rd quartile, Q3) of 28.5
   (17.5-65.0) ng/g; Four-ring PAHs were the most abundant and contributed
   an average of similar to 50.2\% of the Sigma(16)PAHs. Significant
   differences in the spatial distributions of PAHs in soil were observed,
   with higher levels of PAH contamination found in Caserta city and the
   surrounding areas. According to the positive matrix factorization (PMF)
   model, three sources were identified: chemical production and metal
   smelting, vehicle emissions, and coal/biomass combustion. Soil total
   organic carbon was significantly correlated with the concentration of
   total PAHs and the concentrations of PAHs with three-, four-, and
   five-rings. In contrast, only the concentration of Sigma(4)DBPs
   (dibenzo(a,e)pyrene, dibenzo(a,h)pyrene, dibenzo(a,i)pyrene,
   dibenzo(a,l)pyrene) was well correlated with population density. The
   soil mass inventory of Sigma(16)PAHs was estimated to be 6.87 metric
   tons (geometric mean). The ecological risks posed by PAHs in the study
   are negligible; however, health risks of exposure to soil-borne PAHs
   were identified based on a probabilistic risk model.},

Abstract = {A total of 122 honey samples (Apis mellifera ssp. Ligustica) collected
   from Southern Italy were examined for floral identification by
   melissopalynological examination and for polyphenols detection by an
   LC-ESI-Orbitrap(TM) -MS/MS method. The melissopalynological examination
   confirmed all the samples examined as fennel (Foeniculum vulgare)
   unifloral variety. The analytical method carried out for polyphenols
   detection showed satisfactory linearity and recovery values, achieved
   during the validation of the method. Very high amounts of flavonols
   (kaempferol and quercetin) and hydroxycinnamic acids (caffeic acid,
   chlorogenic acid and ferulic acid), were found in all the samples
   examined. Among the hydroxycinnamic acids group, caffeic acid showed the
   highest mean contents (865.90 +/- 67.07 mu g/kg). The results of this
   work confirmed the high presence of phenolic acids with strong free
   radical-scavenging activity in fennel products such as honey, suggesting
   their use to reduce oxidative stress.},

Abstract = {Papillomavirus (PV) infection is associated with development of
   epithelial cancer in different species, including domestic cat (Felis
   catus). Felis catus PV type-2 (FcaPV-2) is considered the causative
   agent of a proportion of feline cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC),
   through the transforming properties of its E6 and E7 oncogenes. However,
   the possible role of FcaPVs in the aetiology of feline oral SCC (FOSCC)
   is still unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the presence and

   10/32 (31\%) of the analysed FOSCC by the use of PCR methods.
   Importantly, viral mRNA was detected by RT-PCR in 7/10 (70\%) of DNA
   positive samples. In particular, FcaPV-2 L1, E2 and E6E7 genes were
   found to be expressed in 5/10 (50\%), 3/10 (33\%) and 5/10 (50\%)
   samples, respectively. Viral DNA was also detected in non neoplastic
   oral ulcerative lesions (ULs) (4/11, 36\%); qPCR suggested a difference
   in viral load between ULs and FOSCCs, particularly in those expressing
   E6E7, although it was not statistically significant. These data suggest,
   but do not definively prove, a possible role of FcaPV-2 in the
   development of a proportion of FOSCC. Moreover, L1 and E2 gene
   expression results indicate that FcaPV-2 infection associated with these
   tumours may possibly be productive.},

Abstract = {Tunisia has experienced various West Nile disease outbreaks.
   Notwithstanding the serological and molecular confirmations in humans,
   horses and birds, the human surveillance system can still be improved.
   Three sentinel chicken flocks were placed in different Tunisian endemic
   regions and followed up from September 2016 to January 2017. A total of
   422 sera from Sejnene (north of Tunisia), 392 from Moknine (east coast
   of Tunisia) and 386 from Tozeur (south of Tunisia) were tested for West
   Nile-specific antibodies and viral RNA. The WNV elisa positive rate in
   sentinel chickens in Sejnene was 10.7\% (95\% CI: 5.08-21.52). No
   positive samples were detected in Moknine. In Tozeur, the overall
   serological elisa positive rate during the study period was 9.8\% (95\%
   CI:4.35-21.03). West Nile virus nucleic acid was detected in two
   chickens in Sejnene.Phylogenetic analysis of one of the detected partial
   NS3 gene sequences showed that recent Tunisian WNV strain belong to WNV
   lineage 1 and is closely related to Italian strains detected in
   mosquitoes in 2016 and in a sparrow hawk in 2017. This report showed the
   circulation, first molecular detection and sequencing of WNV lineage 1
   in chickens in the north of Tunisia and highlights the use of poultry as
   a surveillance tool to detect WNV transmission in a peri-domestic area.},

Title = {Experimental Usutu Virus Infection in Domestic Canaries Serinus canaria},
Journal = {VIRUSES-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Usutu virus (USUV) is a neurotropic flavivirus closely related to West
   Nile virus (WNV). Its enzootic cycle mainly involves mosquitoes and
   birds. Human infection can occur with occasional, but sometimes severe,
   neurological complications. Since its emergence and spread in Europe
   over the last two decades, USUV has been linked to significant avian
   outbreaks, especially among Passeriformes, including European blackbirds
   (Turdus merula). Strikingly, no in vivo avian model exists so far to
   study this arbovirus. The domestic canary (Serinus canaria) is a
   passerine, which is considered as a highly susceptible model of
   infection by WNV. Here, we experimentally challenged domestic canaries
   with two different doses of USUV. All inoculated birds presented
   detectable amounts of viral RNA in the blood and RNA shedding via
   feathers and droppings during the early stages of the infection, as
   determined by RT-qPCR. Mortality occurred in both infected groups (1/5
   and 2/5, respectively) and was not necessarily correlated to a pure
   neurological disease. Subsequent analyses of samples from dead birds
   showed histopathological changes and virus tropism mimicking those
   reported in naturally infected birds. A robust seroconversion followed
   the infection in almost all the surviving canaries. Altogether, these
   results demonstrate that domestic canaries constitute an interesting
   experimental model for the study of USUV pathogenesis and transmission.},

Abstract = {In total, 4,615 fresh and processed fish samples collected from 2010 to
   2015 were analyzed for histamine by ultrahigh-performance liquid
   chromatography with diode array detection. Histamine levels were
   detected in 352 (7.6\%) samples, with a maximum of 4,110 mg kg(-1) and
   mean values of 908.9 +/- 1,226.79 and 344.01 +/- 451.18 mg kg(-1) for
   fresh and processed fish samples, respectively. No histamine levels were
   found in canned tuna and smoked fish samples in contrast to most of the
   data reported in the literature. A low percentage (2.79\%) of
   noncompliant samples was found. The highest mean values were found
   during 2011 and 2015 for fresh and processed fish samples, respectively,
   showing a significant (P, 0.05) difference between the sampling years.
   The histamine contents found in fresh fish samples were significantly
   higher (P, 0.05) than those of processed samples. Most of the positive
   samples came from street vendors, suggesting the need to improve
   inspection measures in these commercial categories to ensure fish
   product safety.},

Title = {Molecular detection of Leptospira spp. in wild boar (Sus scrofa) hunted

Journal = {COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES},
Year = {2020},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Leptospirosis is a re-emerging and widespread zoonosis, worldwide
   distributed, due to a wide variety of wild and domestic animal species
   able to act as natural or accidental hosts. During last years, in
   Europe, as in Italy, wild boar (Sus scrofa) population is increased.
   This animal represents a reservoir for different etiological agents,
   such as Leptospira. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the
   prevalence of Leptospira spp. in wild boar hunted in Liguria region
   (Italy) during two-year hunting seasons. From 611 hunted wild boar,
   kidneys were collected. DNA was extracted from each organ and different
   targets were used to detect pathogenic (lipL32 gene), intermediate (16S
   rRNA gene) and saprophytic (23S rRNA gene) Leptospira by Taqman-based
   RealTime-PCR assays. Overall, kidneys were sampled from 282 adults, 155
   sub-adults and 174 young wild boar (in total 314 males and 298 females).
   By RealTime PCR 77 kidneys were positive and, among these, 74 resulted
   positive for pathogenic (96.10\%) and 3 (3.90\%) for intermediate
   Leptospira. No significant differences in pathogenic Leptospira
   infection ratio were detected between male (11.50\%) and female
   (12.75\%). Only 13 sub-adult animals (8.39\%) resulted infected by
   pathogenic Leptospira; 23 young animals (13.22\%) and 38 adult animals
   (13.47\%) were positive. The results of this study confirmed the
   importance of wild boar in the epidemiology of leptospirosis, which is
   able to infect other animal species (domestic and wild) including
   humans. Rarely, intermediate Leptospira could be able to infect wild
   boar with a renal localization that can contribute to their shedding and
   circulation.},

Title = {Prevalence, Population Diversity and Antimicrobial Resistance of
   Campylobacter coli Isolated in Italian Swine at Slaughterhouse},

Abstract = {Campylobacter spp. are among the microorganisms most commonly associated
   with foodborne disease. Swine are known to be the main reservoir of
   Campylobacter coli and a possible source infection of humans as a result
   of carcass contamination at slaughter. The aim of this study was to
   evaluate the prevalence of C. coli contamination in swine carcasses, the
   antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns of isolates and the genetic
   diversity between strains obtained from swine and those isolated from
   humans. The prevalence of contamination was higher on carcasses (50.4\%)
   than in faeces (32.9\%). The 162 C. coli isolated from swine were
   examined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multi-locus
   sequence typing (MLST). The results of PFGE indicated a high genetic
   diversity among the isolates, with 25 different PFGE types. MLST
   assigned 51 sequence types (STs) to isolates. The most common genotype
   was ST-854 (16.04\%), ST-9264 (10.49 \%) and ST-1016 (6.08 \%). Results
   of AMR showed a high resistance to quinolones and fluoroquinolones
   together with aminoglycosides and tetracycline. Many strains were
   multi-resistant with predominant R-type TeSCipNa (57\%). Five resistance
   genes were detected along with mutation in the gyrA gene. A strong
   correlation between phenotypic and genotypic resistance was found for
   fluoroquinolone and tetracycline. Genetic profiles obtained in swine
   isolates were compared to those of 11 human strains. All human strains
   and 64.19\% of animal strains (104/162) were assigned to the ST-828
   clonal complex.},

Title = {A Contribution to the Harmonization of Non-targeted NMR Methods for
   Data-Driven Food Authenticity Assessment},

Abstract = {Spectroscopic non-targeted methods are gaining ever-growing importance
   in quality control and authenticity assessment of food products because
   of their strong potential for identification of specific features of the
   products by data-driven classifiers. One of the factors hampering the
   diffusion of spectroscopic non-targeted methods and data-driven
   classifiers is the lack of harmonized guidelines for their development
   and validation. In particular, to date, neither conditions to directly
   compare spectra recorded by different spectrometers nor studies
   demonstrating the statistical equivalence of the spectra are available.
   Among the spectroscopic analytical techniques suitable for the
   development of non-targeted methods, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
   offers the unique opportunity to generate statistically equivalent
   signals. In this paper, the feasibility of NMR spectroscopy to generate
   statistically equivalent NMR signals from a number of different
   spectrometers was demonstrated for complex mixtures (aqueous extracts of
   wheat and flour) by organizing an inter-laboratory comparison involving
   36 NMR spectrometers. Univariate statistics along with multivariate
   analysis were exploited to establish unbiased criteria for assessing the
   statistical equivalence of the NMR signals. The aspects affecting the
   signal equivalence were investigated, and possible solutions to reduce
   the extent of the human error were proposed and applied with
   satisfactory results. This study furnishes the scientific community with
   an appropriate and easy procedure to validate non-targeted NMR methods
   and provides error values to be used as a reference for future studies.},

Abstract = {Fish waste utilization to obtain protein hydrolysates has been
   demonstrated to be a useful strategy to face both environmental and
   economic impacts while obtaining high-value products with remarkable
   biological and nutritional properties. In the present study, protein
   hydrolysates obtained from anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus (APH)
   by-products were assessed for their potential biological activities in
   both in vitro and in vivo models. The treatment with APH exerted a
   significant protection against LPS-induced inflammation in RAW 264.7
   cells, decreasing the protein expression of pro-inflammatory mediators
   (i.e., COX-2) and inhibiting the nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B
   through I kappa B-alpha. Moreover, APH modulated the expression of iNOS,
   MnSOD and HO-1, thus decreasing the severity of oxidative stress. The
   supplementation of APH in the diet of ApoE knockout mice down-regulated
   the proinflammatory cytokines (i.e., TNF-alpha, IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta,
   IL-6) in both aorta and heart tissues, and modulated the expression of
   oxidative stress-related genes (Cu/ZnSod, MnSod, Cat, Gpx and Ho),
   indicating that APH can exert a beneficial role, having
   anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. The nutritional properties
   of APH, together with their biological activities herein reported,
   highlight the possibility of obtaining bioactive molecules from fish
   waste and encourage their use as potential nutraceuticals in food and
   pharmaceutical industries in the next future.},

Abstract = {The present study reports the preliminary results obtained from the
   on-field application of the new Italian integrated system
   ``ClassyFarm{''} for the risk-based categorization of dairy farms in
   relation to animal welfare, biosecurity and antimicrobial usage and it
   investigates the relationships between these 3 aspects of the farming
   system. Over the three year-period 2016-2018, sixteen Italian loose
   housing dairy farms were assessed using this integrated approach. Animal
   welfare and biosecurity levels were determined applying the checklist
   developed by the Italian Reference Centre for Animal Welfare (CReNBA)
   and included in the ClassyFarm system. The antimicrobial usage (AMU),
   defined as the number of days in which an animal is potentially exposed
   to an antimicrobial treatment during a year, was calculated using the
   Defined Daily Dose Animal for Italy (DDDAit), based on the Italian
   summaries of product characteristics. In the sixteen investigated farms,
   the average animal welfare level was 67.98\% (range 45.32\%-81.69\%),
   the average biosecurity level was 45.86\% (range 21.41\% - 71.56\%) and
   the average AMU was 10.57 days/cow per year. Antimicrobials in cows were
   mostly used for udder problems (42.03\%), dry cow therapies (35.77\%),
   locomotion problems (12.74\%), urogenital diseases (5.79\%) and
   respiratory diseases (2.36\%). Penicillins, third- and fourth-generation
   cephalosporins were the most used classes of antimicrobials. The most
   common routes of administration were the injectable route (43.57\%) and
   the intramammary route (34.67\% in dry cows and 20.34\% in lactating
   cows, respectively).
   No statistically significant correlations (Spearman's rank correlation
   coefficient) were identified between AMU and the other variables (animal
   welfare level and biosecurity level), however, further investigations on
   a larger sample of farms are needed to confirm the obtained results.
   The integrated system ``ClassyFarm{''} turned out to be a very promising
   tool for Italian dairy farms, in order to monitor and enhance animal
   welfare and biosecurity levels and to support a more rational
   antimicrobial usage, satisfying National and European demands for the
   reduction of the antimicrobial usage.},

Title = {An inter-laboratory trial as a tool to increase rabies diagnostic
   capabilities of Sub-Saharan African Veterinary laboratories},
Journal = {PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {To achieve the goal of eliminating dog-mediated human rabies deaths by
   2030, many African countries have agreed to list rabies as a priority
   zoonotic disease and to undertake both short and long-term control
   programs. Within this context, reliable local diagnosis is essential for
   the success of field surveillance systems. However, a harmonized,
   sustainable and supportive diagnostic offer has yet to be achieved in
   the continent. We herewith describe the organization and outcome of a
   proficiency test (PT) for the post-mortem diagnosis of rabies in
   animals, involving thirteen veterinary laboratories and one public
   health laboratory in Africa. Participants were invited to assess both
   the performance of the Direct Fluorescent Antibody (DFA) test and of a
   conventional RT-PCR. From the submitted results, while thirteen
   laboratories proved to be able to test the samples through DFA test,
   eleven performed the RT-PCR method; ten applied both techniques. Of
   note, the number of laboratories able to apply rabies RT-PCR had
   increased from four to ten after the exercise. Importantly, results
   showed a higher proficiency in applying the molecular test compared to
   the DFA test (concordance, sensitivity and specificity: 98.2\%, 96.97\%
   and 100\% for RT-PCR; 87.69\%, 89.23\% and 86.15\% for DFA test),
   indicating the feasibility of molecular methods to diagnose animal
   pathogens in Africa. Another positive outcome of this approach was that
   negative and positive controls were made available for further in-house
   validation of new techniques; in addition, a detailed questionnaire was
   provided to collect useful and relevant information on the diagnostic
   procedures and biosafety measures applied at laboratory level.
   Author summary
   Although Africa has the highest per capita death rate from rabies, the
   incidence of canine rabies on the continent remains a matter that needs
   to be further investigated; in addition, the lack of accurate
   information impairs the establishment of long-term actions to progress
   towards a rabies free status. In this scenario, creating efficient
   diagnostic facilities is of utmost importance for eradicating the
   disease and implementing effective surveillance programs in endemic
   areas. With the final objective of eliminating dog-mediated human rabies
   globally by 2030, sample submission to African veterinary laboratories
   for rabies diagnostic testing is expected to increase. Furthermore, in
   compliance with ISO/IEC 17025:2017 standard, participating to
   proficiency testing (PT) exercises becomes mandatory not only to
   regularly assess the validity of the in-house protocols but also to
   harmonize the techniques. Thirteen veterinary laboratories and one
   public health laboratory in Africa were invited to take part in the
   exercise in response to an invitation from the Istituto Zooprofilattico
   Sperimentale delle Venezie (IZSVe), Italy, which hosts the FAO rabies
   Reference Center. This study presents the results obtained by applying
   the DFA test and the conventional RT-PCR method to the PT panel, which
   show that even if laboratories preferably apply the DFA test to detect
   the presence of rabies in animal samples, the overall concordance of
   results was higher through molecular testing. Importantly, the
   organization of the exercise proved to be a good opportunity to update
   the vaccine cover status of laboratory staff.},

Abstract = {Due to food safety concerns, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)
   asked to identify useful parameters for identifying the mechanically
   separated meat (MSM). In this work, the Sr-90 levels of MSM products
   were assessed for evaluating the suitability of this parameter for MSM
   identification. Indeed, this contaminant may accumulate in animal bones
   and bone fragments may be present in MSM. One hundred samples of fresh
   meats and meat products composed of different MSM percentages and
   without MSM were analyzed by ultra-low-level liquid scintillation
   counting. The Sr-90 activity concentrations detected in meat products
   with high percentage of MSM were significantly higher (p >= 0.05) (0.099
   Bq kg(-1)) than those of fresh meats (0.024 Bq kg(-1)) and meat products
   containing low percentage of MSM (0.011 Bq kg(-1)). The percentage of
   correct MSM identification was 61\%. In order to increase this
   percentage and to develop a new tool of investigation, the Sr-90 was
   elaborated in combination with other three parameters: Sr-88, Ca and ash
   percentage, through a multivariate approach. The precision of this tool
   of investigation was significantly increased (87\%), higher than the
   reference method (Ca level) (76\%), representing a valid novel approach
   in the identification of MSM products.},

Title = {Volatile Flavor Compounds in Cheese as Affected by Ruminant Diet},
Journal = {MOLECULES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Extensive research has been conducted concerning the determination and
   characterization of volatile compounds contributing to aroma and flavor
   in cheese. Considerable knowledge has been accumulated on the
   understanding of the mechanisms through which these compounds are formed
   during ripening, as well as on the optimization of the methodological
   approaches which lead to their detection. More recently, particular
   attention has been given to the aromatic properties of milk and cheeses
   obtained from lactating dairy ruminants fed experimental diets,
   characterized, for instance, by the addition of trace elements, natural
   supplements, or agricultural by-products rich in bioactive compounds.
   The purpose of this review is to summarize the major families of
   volatile compounds most commonly found in these types of dairy products
   at various ripening stages, describing in greater detail the role of
   animal diet in influencing the synthesis mechanisms most commonly
   responsible for cheese flavor determination. A large number of volatile
   compounds, including carboxylic acids, lactones, ketones, alcohols, and
   aldehydes, can be detected in cheese. The relative percentage of each
   compound depends on the biochemical processes that occur during
   ripening, and these are mainly mediated by endogenous enzymes and
   factors of bacterial origin whose function can be strongly influenced by
   the bioactive compounds taken by animals with the diet and released in
   milk through the mammary gland. Further evaluations on the interactions
   between volatile compounds and cheese matrix would be necessary in order
   to improve the knowledge on the synthesis mechanisms of such compounds;
   in addition to this, more should be done with respect to the
   determination of synergistic effects of flavor compounds, correlating
   such compounds to the aroma of dairy products.},

Abstract = {Companion animals have been described as potential reservoirs of
   antimicrobial resistance (AMR), however data remain scarce. Therefore,
   the objectives were to describe antimicrobial usage (AMU) in dogs and
   cats in three European countries (Belgium, Italy, and The Netherlands)
   and to investigate phenotypic AMR. A questionnaire and one fecal sample
   per animal (n = 303) were collected over one year and AMU was quantified
   using treatment incidence (TI). Phenotypic resistance profiles of 282
   Escherichia coli isolates were determined. Nineteen percent of the
   animals received at least one antimicrobial treatment six months
   preceding sampling. On average, cats and dogs were treated with a
   standard daily dose of antimicrobials for 1.8 and 3.3 days over one
   year, respectively. The most frequently used antimicrobial was
   amoxicillin-clavulanate (27\%). Broad-spectrum antimicrobials and
   critically important antimicrobials for human medicine represented 83\%
   and 71\% of the total number of treatments, respectively. Resistance of
   E. coli to at least one antimicrobial agent was found in 27\% of the
   isolates. The most common resistance was to ampicillin (18\%). Thirteen
   percent was identified as multidrug resistant isolates. No association
   between AMU and AMR was found in the investigated samples. The issue to
   address, regarding AMU in companion animal, lies within the quality of
   use, not the quantity. Especially from a One-Health perspective,
   companion animals might be a source of transmission of resistance genes
   and/or resistant bacteria to humans.},

   Openness to Different Cultures},
Journal = {FOODS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {While the ethnic food market has become increasingly important in Italy,
   the effects of the hybridization of consumption patterns have been
   slowed by a consolidated culinary tradition. This study investigates the
   relationships among ethnic food consumption, food neophobia, and
   openness to different cultures with sociodemographic characteristics. A
   sample of 1317 Italian consumers responded to an online survey. The
   sociodemographic profile of the neophobic consumer appears to
   substantially differ from that of the consumer with an attitude of
   openness. Neophobic respondents are males, are older than 55 years of
   age, are less educated, have children, are retired, have difficulty
   meeting their financial responsibilities, and do not eat ethnic food.
   Respondents who are more open to different cultures are young adults,
   are highly educated, have no children, are employed, and are consumers
   of ethnic food. The relationship between food neophobia and openness to
   different cultures is confirmed to be the relationship between these
   variables and ethnic food consumption. The measurement of these
   characteristics could serve as a crucial indicator for analyzing the
   willingness to accept elements of novelty in an increasingly
   multicultural society. Additionally, consumers with the neophobic trait
   and who are less open to different cultures might have a less varied
   diet that is essential to good health.},

Title = {Evaluation of a molecular method for hepatitis E virus (HEV) detection
   in pancreatin of porcine origin},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VIROLOGICAL METHODS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {276},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Pancreatin is a combination of enzymes, principally amylase, lipase, and
   protease, used in the treatment of pancreatic endocrine insufficiency in
   humans. Pancreatin manufactured from imported porcine pancreas carries
   the risk of hepatitis E virus (HEV) contamination. About 1 \% of the
   starting material for pancreatin manufacture is invariably constituted
   of the small intestine, which is known to be a major extrahepatic site
   of HEV replication in pigs.
   The aim of this study was to evaluate a method to detect and quantify
   HEV in pancreatin of porcine origin. Because HEV cannot be easily grown
   by conventional cell culture, an approach based on an established
   quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) was selected. This entailed the use of a
   non-HEV internal control to monitor RNA extraction efficacy and the
   production of HEV synthetic RNA as a reference to account for the
   efficacy of reverse-transcription. The method was evaluated by
   experiments in which HEV (from naturally infected pigs) was spiked in
   both the starting material (i.e., porcine pancreas homogenate for
   industrial production) and in the pancreatin itself. A laboratory
   protocol matching the industrial production workflow was set up and
   RT-qPCR experiments were carried out to evaluate the method's ability to
   detect HEV in pancreatin made from HEV-contaminated porcine tissues.
   The results showed that the method may be employed in two different
   strategies: to test the porcine pancreas homogenate (quantitative
   performance) or directly on pancreatin (qualitative assay). While the
   risk of HEV contamination in pancreatin may be low, it cannot be
   completely ruled out. Testing for HEV based on the precautionary
   principle ought to be the guiding rule.},

Abstract = {Toscana virus (TOSV) is a Phlebovirus transmitted by phlebotomine sand
   flies and is an important etiological agent of summer meningitis in the
   Mediterranean basin. Since TOSV infection is often asymptomatic, we
   evaluated the seroprevalence in blood donors (BDs) in the Bologna and
   Ferrara provinces (Northeastern Italy)-the areas with the highest and
   lowest numbers of TOSV neuroinvasive cases in the region, respectively.
   A total of 1208 serum samples from BDs were collected in April June 2014
   and evaluated for the presence of specific TOSV-IgG by ELISA. The
   IgG-reactive samples were confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence assay
   (IIF) and by microneutralization test (MN). Serum samples were defined
   as positive for anti-TOSV IgG when reactive by ELISA and by at least one
   second-level test; TOSV seroprevalence was 6.8\% in the Bologna
   province, while no circulation of TOSV was detected in the Ferrara
   province. Sand fly abundance in 2014 was also estimated by a geographic
   information system using a generalized linear model applied to a series
   of explanatory variables. TOSV seroprevalence rate was strongly
   associated with the sand fly abundance index in each municipality,
   pointing out the strong association between sand fly abundance and human
   exposure to TOSV.},

Title = {Natural immunity in conventionally and organically reared turkeys and

Journal = {POULTRY SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {99},

Pages = {763-771},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Suboptimal animal welfare may affect natural immunity, rendering animals
   more susceptible to environmentally conditioned diseases, including
   those requiring antimicrobial treatment, which may promote antimicrobial
   resistance (AMR) in bacterial populations. Herewith, we tested the
   hypothesis that conventionally raised turkeys have higher levels of AMR
   in indicator Escherichia coli bacteria, but lower levels of natural
   immunity, as compared to turkeys reared under organic conditions. Litter
   and serum samples were collected from 28 conventional and 4 organic
   turkey farms: E. coli isolates from litter were tested for resistance to
   14 antimicrobials, while 3 parameters of natural immunity (i.e.,
   lysozyme, hemolytic complement levels, and serum bactericidal activity)
   were assessed in the sera. Resistant E. coli isolates were identified in
   both conventional and organic farms but generally more frequently in
   conventional farms. High rates of resistance to ampicillin (96\%),
   tetracycline (95\%), streptomycin (82\%), sulfamethoxazole (80\%),
   ciprofloxacin (73\%), and trimethoprim (71\%), as well as high rates of
   multiresistance, were observed in conventional farms. Organically raised
   turkeys had significantly higher levels of lysozyme and serum
   bactericidal activity than conventional turkeys, and these levels were
   also higher in turkeys housed in farms where AMR frequency was lower.
   Findings support the hypothesis that conventional farming conditions may
   affect turkeys' natural immunity, rendering the animals more susceptible
   to environmentally conditioned diseases requiring antimicrobial
   treatment, which would in turn promote AMR. Reducing AMR in turkey
   farming is therefore more likely to be successful when considering
   animal welfare as an option to reduce the need of antimicrobial use.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This study investigates the microbiological conditions before maturation
   of wild boar meat (Sus scrofa) processed in approved game handling
   establishments in Italy. Fillets and legquarters of 37 carcasses were
   tested to assess Aerobic Colony Count (ACC), Enterobacteriaceae Count
   (EC) and Salmonella presence. Salmonella was never found and mean values
   of ACC and EC were 4.67 +/- 1.78 SD and 2.60 +/- 1.58 SD log CFU/cm(2),
   respectively. Both ACC and EC increased with time between evisceration
   and skinning, were significantly higher in fillets and when meat was
   processed by untrained operators. ACC also increased with boars' weight
   and when carcasses were cleaned with running potable water. Based on
   limits set by EU Regulation No 1441/2007 for pork meat, most legquarters
   resulted satisfactory or acceptable (59\% for ACC and 70\% for EC),
   while most fillets were unsatisfactory (76\% ACC, 78\% EC). Results show
   that the wild game meat supply chain can be a safe process when handling
   practices reported in European and National regulations are met.},

Abstract = {This study evaluates the hazards posed by foodborne bacteria of the
   Listeria genus by analyzing the occurrence, diversity and virulence of
   Listeria spp.in food and food-manufacturing plants. Seventy-five
   isolates obtained from the routine analysis of 653 samples taken by
   three diagnostic laboratories in Northern Italy were genotypically
   differentiated by Repetitive Extragenic Palindrome (rep) PCR, with the
   GTG5 primer identified by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene and examined by
   specific PCR tests for the presence of L. monocytogenes virulence
   determinants occasionally found to occur in other species of the genus.
   Within this sample, 76\% (n = 57) isolates were identified as L.
   innocua, 16\% (n = 12) as L. monocytogenes, 6.6\% (n = 5) as L.
   welshimeri and 1.3\% (n = 1) as L. seeligeri. All L. monocytogenes
   isolates belonged to the serotype 1/2a and were predicted to be virulent
   for the presence of the inlJ internalin gene. Potentially virulent
   strains of L. innocua, L. seeligeri and L. welshimeri, carrying the L.
   monocytogenesinlA gene and/or hly gene, were identified, and most
   isolates were found to possess the toxin antitoxin system mazEF for
   efficient adaptation to heat shock. Results indicated the need to
   reinforce food-contamination-prevention measures against all Listeria
   species by defining efficiently their environmental distribution.},

   biocompatibility, and differentiation towards the tenogenic lineage.
   PLGA fleeces with randomly distributed fibers (rd-PLGA) were generated
   as control. Results. Optimal cell infiltration and biocompatibility with
   both PLGA fleeces were shown. However, only ha-PLGA fleeces committed
   AECs towards an Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) after 48 h
   culture, inducing their cellular elongation along the fibers' axis and
   the upregulation of mesenchymal markers. AECs further differentiated
   towards tenogenic lineage as confirmed by the up-regulation of
   tendon-related genes and Collagen Type 1 (COL1) protein expression that,
   after 28 days culture, appeared extracellularly distributed along the
   direction of ha-PLGA fibers. Moreover, long-term co-cultures of
   AEC-ha-PLGA bio-hybrids with fetal tendon explants significantly
   accelerated of half time AEC tenogenic differentiation compared to
   ha-PLGA fleeces cultured only with AECs. Conclusions. The fabricated
   tendon biomimetic ha-PLGA fleeces induce AEC tenogenesis through an
   early EMT, providing a potential tendon substitute for tendon
   engineering research.},

Abstract = {Sulcascaris sulcata (Anisakidae), a pathogenic nematode of sea turtles,
   may cause ulcerous gastritis with different degrees of severity.
   Previous studies demonstrated a high prevalence of infection in the
   Mediterranean loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta), although no data on
   the potential intermediate hosts of this nematode has been published
   thus far from the Mediterranean basin. Here, using molecular analyses,
   we demonstrated that the cross sections of nematode larvae observed
   histologically in Mediterranean mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis)
   collected from a farm along the Tyrrhenian coast of southern Italy
   belong to S. sulcata. The BLAST analysis of sequences at the ITS2 region
   of rDNA and mtDNA cox2 gene loci here obtained from samples of two
   Mediterranean mussels containing nematode larvae showed 100\% homology
   with those at the same gene loci from the adults of S. sulcata collected
   from the Mediterranean Sea and deposited in GenBank. To our knowledge,
   this study is the first to present data on a potential intermediate host
   of S. sulcata in the Mediterranean basin and to report a nematode
   parasite from the Mediterranean mussel.},

Title = {Prevalence and antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from imported
   ornamental fish in Italy: A translocation of resistant strains?},
Journal = {PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {175},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The rapid expansion of the ornamental aquaculture industry over the past
   decades has resulted in a concomitant increase in the use of antibiotics
   to combat infectious diseases. The aim of this study was to assess the
   possible role of ornamental fish in the translocation of antibiotic
   resistant bacteria, with possible consequences for aquarium and public
   health. We assessed the prevalence of bacterial infections and the
   antibiotic resistance profile of bacteria isolated from 134 ornamental
   fish imported into northwest Italy during two years of monitoring.
   Ornamental fish analyzed were imported mainly from Singapore (40\%) and
   Israel (20\%), followed by Thailand (13\%), Sri Lanka (12\%), Czech
   Republic (7\%), Vietnam (5\%) and Indonesia (3\%). The most commonly
   imported fish were freshwater species, particularly those belonging to
   the Poeciliidae family. Bacteriological exam was positive in 68\% of the
   fish examined. The most frequently isolated bacterium was Aeromonas
   sobria (37\%). Bacteria showed resistance against lincomycin,
   ampicillin, oxytetracycline and tetracycline. Sensitivity was found for
   florfenicol, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, and
   trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Odds ratio (OR) values were calculated as
   a measure of the association between antibiotic resistance of A. sobria
   and selected factors (country of origin, fish family and fish species),
   considering Thailand, Poeciliidae and Poecilia reticulata as control
   cases. Higher values were found for Vietnam (OR 5.6) and Xiphophorus
   helleri and X. maculatus (OR 3.0 and 3.7 respectively). Our findings
   underline the need to improve targeted surveillance of antimicrobial
   resistance and prevent the translocation of resistant or multi-resistant
   bacterial strains in ornamental fish, especially in fish imported from
   countries where surveillance is limited or lacking.},

Journal = {SMALL RUMINANT RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {183},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) represent the main cause of
   subclinical mastitis in ruminants. Resistance to antimicrobials, as well
   as biofilm production play a key role in environmental persistence. In
   this work, CoNS isolates from 120 samples of ovine bulk-tank milk
   collected in Tuscany and Latium (Italy) were identified via PCR-RFLP and
   characterized for their susceptibility to antibiotics, disinfectants and
   ability to form biofilm. Out of 73 isolates, S. epidermidis was the
   prevalent species. Thirty-nine (53.4 \%) isolates were resistant to at
   least one of the tested antibiotics. The highest resistance rates were
   recorded against ampicillin (39.7 \%), and tetracycline (10.9 \%). As
   for genetic profiles, 44 (60.3 \%) isolates were positive for at least
   one of the targeted resistance genes. The most detected was blaZ (46.6
   \%), while 6 isolates (8.2 \%) showed the simultaneous presence of blaZ
   and tet genes. Despite the common presence of at least one of the
   targeted biofilm production determinants (83.5 \% isolates), none of
   them were positive when grown on Congo Red Agar. Only 9 isolates (12.3
   \%) were positive for disinfectant resistance genes (qac), among which
   smr-qacC' was the prevalent (9.6 \%). Twenty isolates were selected to
   determine MIC and MBC against benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine
   digluconate. For both disinfectants, 12/20 (60 \%) isolates showed
   reduced susceptibility. This study highlights the role of CoNS as
   potential carriers of a wide range of environmental persistence factors.
   These include not only antibiotic resistance and biofilm production
   genes, but in some cases also biocide resistance genes, which could
   confer unspecific additional resistance mechanisms against a broad range
   of antimicrobials.},

Abstract = {Honey is a very unusual food - a natural substance produced by bees from
   the nectar or secretion of plants and elaborated by the bees themselves.
   Differences in trace elements and rare earth elements (REEs) are related
   to botanical and geographical origin, and, as such, honey could be a
   suitable indicator for metal occurrence in the environment within the
   bee forage area. A total of 40 metals were analyzed by inductively
   coupled plasma-mass spectrometry in multi-floral honey samples from
   different geographical areas. The highest levels of trace elements and
   REEs were found in honey from Tanzania, while lower concentrations were
   recorded in Italian, Kazakhstan, the Balkans, and South American honeys.
   Tanzanian honey is of interest due to its different content of metals,
   related to the peculiar lithology and the mineral resources of this
   country. Rubidium and aluminum were the most represented nonessential
   elements, while manganese, iron, zinc, and copper registered the highest
   values of the essential elements. Very low concentrations were found for
   the toxic elements lead, cadmium, and arsenic. The present study showed
   differences in metal concentrations in multi-floral honey from different
   countries, confirming the strong influence of the area of origin on the
   chemical composition of honeys.},

Abstract = {Electrospun scaffolds are emerging as extracellular matrix
   (ECM)mimicking structures for tissue engineering thanks to their
   nanofibrous architecture. For the development of suitable electrospun
   scaffolds for bone tissue engineering, the addition of inorganic
   components has been implemented with the aim to confer important
   bioactivity like osteoinduction, osteointegration, and cell adhesion to
   the scaffolds. In this context, we propose a tricomponent electrospun
   scaffold composed of poly(d,l-lactide), gelatin and RKKP glass-ceramics.
   The bioactive RKKP glass-ceramic system has attracted interest, due to
   the presence of ions such as La3+ and Ta5+, which turned out to be
   valuable as growth supporting agents for bones. In this work, RKKP
   glass-ceramics were embedded inside the microfibers of electrospun
   scaffolds and the structural and biological properties were
   investigated. Our results showed that the glass-ceramic microparticles
   were uniformly distributed in the fibrous structure of the scaffold.
   Furthermore, the glass-ceramics promoted biomineralization of the
   scaffolds and improved cell viability and osteogenic differentiation.
   The mineralized layer formed on RKKP-containing scaffolds after
   incubation in simulated body fluid medium has been shown to be
   hydroxyapatite by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The results
   on differentiation studies of canine adipose-derived mesenchymal stem
   cells grown on the electrospun scaffolds suggest that on varying the
   content of RKKP in the scaffold, it is possible to drive the
   differentiation toward chondrogenic or osteogenic commitment. The
   presence of ions, like La3+ and Ta5+, in the RKKP embedded polymeric
   composite scaffolds could play a role in supporting cell growth and
   promoting differentiation.},

Abstract = {The genus Pestivirus comprises globally distributed members of the
   family Flaviviridae, which cause severe losses in livestock. The most
   common species of the genus are bovine viral diarrhoea virus type 1
   (BVDV-1) and type 2 (BVDV-2), classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and
   border disease virus (BDV). Recently, a novel ovine pestivirus was
   repeatedly detected in aborted lamb foetuses on a farm located in the
   Brescia Province (Italy). Complete genome characterization of this
   isolate showed that it was highly divergent from known pestivirus
   species and that it was genetically closely related to CSFV. The aim of
   this study was to determine the serological relatedness between the
   identified novel pestivirus and BVDV, BDV and CSFV selected strains for
   which homologous serum was available, by antigenic characterization
   performed using cross-neutralization assays. The serological relatedness
   was expressed as the coefficient of antigenic similarity (R). Both field
   and specific antisera raised against the ovine pestivirus neutralized
   the CSFV reference strain Diepholz with titres significantly higher than
   those specific for the BDV and BVDV strains. Furthermore, the calculated
   R values clearly indicated that the novel ovine pestivirus is
   antigenically more related to CSFV than to ruminant pestiviruses, in
   agreement with the results of the genomic analysis. This would have
   severe consequences on CSFV serology in the event of a switch to porcine
   hosts with implications for CSFV surveillance and porcine health
   management.},

Title = {Motile aeromonads from farmed and wild freshwater fish in northern
   Italy: an evaluation of antimicrobial activity and multidrug resistance
   during 2013 and 2016},

Abstract = {Background Antimicrobial resistant bacteria are emerging biological
   contaminants of the environment. In aquatic ecosystems, they originate
   mainly from hospitals, livestock manure and private households sewage
   water, which could contain antimicrobial agents and resistant
   microorganisms. Aeromonas spp. occur ubiquitously in aquatic
   environments and they cause disease in fish. Motile aeromonads are also
   associated with human gastrointestinal and wound infections and fish can
   act as a transmission route of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) aeromonads
   to humans. The environmental ubiquity, the natural susceptibility to
   antimicrobials and the zoonotic potential of Aeromonas spp. make them
   optimal candidates for studying the AMR in aquatic ecosystems. Results
   The AMR patterns of 95 motile aeromonads isolated from freshwater fish
   during 2013 and 2016 were analyzed. All samples from fish came from
   farms and natural water bodies located in northern Italy, which is an
   area characterized by high anthropic impact on the environment. The
   isolates were biochemically identified as Aeromonas hydrophila,
   Aeromonas sobria or Aeromonas caviae and AMR was determined by the
   standard disk diffusion method. All isolates were resistant to
   cloxacillin, spiramycin and tilmicosin. High AMR frequencies (> 95\%)
   were detected for tylosin, penicillin and sulfadiazine. AMR to
   danofloxacin, enrofloxacin, flumequine, ceftiofur, aminosidine,
   colistin, doxycycline, gentamicin, marbocyl and florfenicol was observed
   at low levels (< 10\%). No AMR to cefquinome was found. Logistic
   regression showed several differences in antimicrobial activity between
   complexes. According to the source of aeromonads, only few differences
   in AMR between isolates from farmed and wild fish were observed.
   Conclusions Our data revealed an increasing trend of AMR to neomycin and
   apramycin among Aeromonas isolates during the study period, while
   resistance to erythromycin, tetracycline and thiamphenicol decreased.
   All isolates were multidrug resistance (MDR), but A. caviae showed the
   highest number of MDR per isolate. In most isolates, various degrees of
   MDR were detected to macrolides, quinolones, fluoroquinolones,
   polymyxins and cephalosporins (third and fourth generations), which are
   listed, by the World Health Organisation, to be among the highest
   priority and critically important antimicrobials in human medicine. Our
   findings underlined that freshwater fish can act as potential source of
   MDR motile aeromonads. Due to their zoonotic potential, this can pose
   serious threat to human health.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND The number and variety of genetically modified organisms
   (GMOs) used globally for the production of food and feed, and
   potentially circulating in the European Union (EU), is constantly
   increasing. This implies an additional effort for the EU enforcement
   laboratories to optimize available resources, to contain costs and time.
   A well established approach for streamlining the analytical workflow is
   the introduction of a screening step, typically based on a smart set of
   real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening methods. The
   multiplexing strategy, allowing the detection of several screening
   elements simultaneously, is a further optimization of this step. RESULTS
   In this study, we present the validation of a real-time PCR duplex assay
   for the pat and bar screening elements to be easily incorporated in the
   GMO diagnostic routine. We also provide a comparison between this method
   and the related singleplex and pre-spotted assays. CONCLUSION Our
   results fully respect all the validation parameters suggested by the
   Minimum Performance Criteria of the European Network of GMO
   Laboratories. Furthermore, the duplex assay is equivalent in terms of
   performance compared to the other two methods, but it shows a higher
   overall flexibility and cost effectiveness. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical

Abstract = {In the present work, the marine invertebrate Mytilus galloprovincialis
   was used as model organism to evaluate the toxic effects of the
   neonicotinoid Calypso 480 SC (CAL) following 20 days of exposure to
   sub-lethal concentrations of 7.77 mg L-1 (0.1\% 96 h-LC50) and 77.70 mg
   L-1 (1\% 96 h-LC50), and a recovery period of 10 days in uncontaminated
   seawater. Results revealed that exposure to both concentrations of CAL
   increased significantly mortality rate in the cells of haemolymph and
   digestive gland, while digestive gland cells were no longer able to
   regulate cell volume. Exposure significantly reduced haemolymph
   parameters (Cl, Na+), affected the enzymatic activities of superoxide
   dismutase of digestive gland and catalase of gill, and caused also
   histopathological alterations in digestive gland and gills. Main
   histological damages detected in mussels were lipofuscin accumulation,
   focal points of necrosis, mucous overproduction and infiltrative
   inflammations. Interestingly, alterations persisted after the recovery
   period in CAL-free water, especially for haemocyte parameters (K+, Na+,
   Ca2+, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose). A slight recovery of histological
   conditions was detected. These findings suggested that sub-chronic
   exposure to the neonicotinoid insecticide caused significant alterations
   in both cell and tissue parameters of M. galloprovincialis. Considering
   the ecologically and commercially important role of mussels in coastal
   waters, a potential risk posed by neonicotinoids to this essential
   aquatic resource can be highlighted. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published

Abstract = {Background Parasites of the family Spirorchiidae cause disease and
   mortality in marine and freshwater turtles; two species, Hapalotrema
   mistroides and Neospirorchis sp., are reported in the resident
   population of loggerhead turtles of the Mediterranean Sea, with the
   first being the most widespread. In vivo diagnosis of spirorchidiasis
   can represent a challenge in guaranteeing prompt control and treatment
   of the disease and is currently limited to copromicroscopy. The aim of
   this study was the development of a real time PCR assay with TaqMan
   probe for the detection of H. mistroides infection in the blood of live
   loggerhead turtles, Caretta caretta, hospitalized in rehabilitation
   centres. Its potential use for in vivo diagnosis is explored. Results
   The developed real time PCR successfully detected H. mistroides DNA from
   both positive controls and experimental blood samples of live loggerhead
   sea turtles, showing good specificity, sensitivity and good reaction
   efficiency. Two out of three turtles which had demonstrated positivity
   at copromicroscopy also tested positive to this blood assay; DNA of H.
   mistroides was detected within the blood of one sea turtle, which tested
   negative for copromicroscopy. Conclusions This study describes a
   specific and rapid molecular assay to detect H. mistroides infection
   from live sea turtles and highlights for the first time the presence of
   DNA of this species in turtle blood samples. Since this assay is able to
   detect low amounts of the parasitic free DNA in blood samples, its
   application could be helpful for in vivo diagnosis of H. mistroides
   infection as well as for epidemiological purposes.},

Title = {Extending the Shelf-Life of Meat and Dairy Products via PET-Modified
   Packaging Activated With the Antimicrobial Peptide MTP1},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JAN 9},
Abstract = {Fresh products are characterized by reduced shelf-life because they are
   an excellent growth medium for a lot of microorganisms. Therefore, the
   microbial spoilage causing significant food supply losses has become an
   enormous economic and ethical problem worldwide. The antimicrobial
   packaging is offering a viable solution to tackle this economic and
   safety issue by extending the shelf-life and improving the quality and
   safety of fresh products. The goal of this study was to investigate the
   effects of a food contact surface of polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
   functionalized with the previously characterized antimicrobial peptide
   mitochondrial-targeted peptide 1 (MTP1), in reducing the microbial
   population related to spoilage and in providing the shelf-life stability
   of different types of fresh foods such as ricotta cheese and buffalo
   meat. Modified polymers were characterized concerning the procedure of
   plasma-activation by water contact angle measurements and Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy measurements in attenuated total
   reflection mode (ATR-FTIR). Results showed that the MTP1-PETs provided a
   strong antimicrobial effect for spoilage microorganisms with no
   cytotoxicity on a human colon cancer cell line. Finally, the activated
   polymers revealed high storage stability and good reusability. This
   study provided valuable information to develop alternative antimicrobial
   packaging for enhancing and extending the microbial quality and safety
   of perishable foods during storage.},

Title = {Validity of cerebrovascular ICD-9-CM codes in healthcare administrative
   databases. The Umbria Data-Value Project},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Month = {JAN 9},
Abstract = {Background
   Validation of administrative databases for cerebrovascular diseases is
   crucial for epidemiological, outcome, and health services research. The
   aim of this study was to validate ICD-9 codes for hemorrhagic or
   ischemic stroke in administrative databases, to use them for a
   comprehensive assessment of the burden of disease in terms of major
   outcomes, such as mortality, hospital readmissions, and use of
   healthcare resources.
   Methods
   We considered the hospital discharge abstract database of the Umbria
   Region (890,000 residents). Source population was represented by
   patients aged >18 discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of
   hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke between 2012 and 2014 using ICD-9-CM
   codes in primary position. We randomly selected and reviewed medical
   charts of cases and non-cases from hospitals. For case ascertainment we
   considered symptoms and instrumental tests reported in the medical
   charts. Diagnostic accuracy measures were computed using 2x2 tables.
   Results
   We reviewed 767 medical charts for cases and 78 charts for non-cases.
   Diagnostic accuracy measures were: subarachnoid hemorrhage: sensitivity
   (SE) 100\% (95\% CI: 97\%-100\%), specificity (SP) 96\% (90-99),
   positive predictive value (PPV) 98\% (93-100), negative predictive value
   (NPV) 100\% (95-100); intracerebral hemorrhage: SE 100\% (97-100), SP
   98\% (91-100), PPV 98\% (94-100), NPV 100\% (95-100); other and
   unspecified intracranial hemorrhage: SE 100\% (97-100), SP 96\% (90-99),
   PPV 98\% (93-100), NPV 100\% (95-100); ischemic stroke due to occlusion
   and stenosis of precerebral arteries: SE 99\% (94-100), SP 66 (57-75),
   PPV 70\% (61-77), NPV 99\% (93-100); occlusion of cerebral arteries: SE
   100\% (97-100), SP 87\% (78-93), PPV 91\% (84-95), NPV 100\% (95-100);
   acute, but ill-defined, cerebrovascular disease: SE 100\% (97-100), SP
   78\% (69-86), PPV \% 83 (75-89), NPV 100\% (95-100).
   Conclusions
   Case ascertainment for both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke showed good
   or high levels of accuracy within the regional healthcare databases in
   Umbria. This database can confidently be employed for epidemiological,
   outcome, and health services research related to any type of stroke.},

Title = {The Risk of Infection by African Swine Fever Virus in European Swine
   Through Boar Movement and Legal Trade of Pigs and Pig Meat},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JAN 9},
Abstract = {African swine fever (ASF) is currently spreading westwards throughout
   Europe and eastwards into China, with cases occurring in both wild boar
   and domestic pigs. A generic risk assessment framework is used to
   determine the probability of first infection with ASF virus (ASFV) at a
   fine spatial scale across European Union Member States. The framework
   aims to assist risk managers across Europe with their ASF surveillance
   and intervention activities. Performing the risk assessment at a fine
   spatial scale allows for hot-spot surveillance, which can aid risk
   managers by directing surveillance or intervention resources at those
   areas or pathways deemed most at risk, and hence enables prioritization
   of limited resources. We use 2018 cases of ASF to estimate prevalence of
   the disease in both wild boar and pig populations and compute the risk
   of initial infection for 2019 at a 100 km(2) cell resolution via three
   potential pathways: legal trade in live pigs, natural movement of wild
   boar, and legal trade in pig meat products. We consider the number of
   pigs, boar and amount of pig meat entering our area of interest, the
   prevalence of the disease in the origin country, the probability of
   exposure of susceptible pigs or boar in the area of interest to
   introduced infected pigs, boar, or meat from an infected pig, and the
   probability of transmission to susceptible animals. We provide maps
   across Europe indicating regions at highest risk of initial infection.
   Results indicate that the risk of ASF in 2019 was predominantly focused
   on those regions which already had numerous cases in 2018 (Poland,
   Lithuania, Hungary, Romania, and Latvia). The riskiest pathway for ASFV
   transmission to pigs was the movement of wild boar for Eastern European
   countries and legal trade of pigs forWestern European countries. New
   infections are more likely to occur in wild boar rather than pigs, for
   both the pig meat and wild boar movement pathways. Our results provide
   an opportunity to focus surveillance activities and thus increase our
   ability to detect ASF introductions earlier, a necessary requirement if
   we are to successfully control the spread of this devastating disease
   for the pig industry.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) is the only animal prion which
   has been recognized as a zoonotic agent so far. The identification of
   BSE in two goats raised the need to reliably identify BSE in small
   ruminants. However, our understanding of scrapie strain diversity in
   small ruminants remains ill-defined, thus limiting the accuracy of BSE
   surveillance and spreading fear that BSE might lurk unrecognized in
   goats. We investigated prion strain diversity in a large panel of
   European goats by a novel experimental approach that, instead of
   assessing the neuropathological profile after serial transmissions in a
   single animal model, was based on the direct interaction of prion
   isolates with several recipient rodent models expressing small ruminants
   or heterologous prion proteins. The findings show that the biological
   properties of scrapie isolates display different patterns of
   geographical distribution in Europe and suggest that goat BSE could be
   reliably discriminated from a wide range of biologically and
   geographically diverse goat prion isolates. Finally, most field prion
   isolates showed composite strain features, with discrete strain
   components or sub-strains being present in different proportions in
   individual goats or tissues. This has important implications for
   understanding the nature and evolution of scrapie strains and their
   transmissibility to other species, including humans.},

Abstract = {A sensitive LC-ESI-MS/MS method was developed for the determination of
   165 pesticides in 50 citrus fruit samples collected in Sicily. Moreover,
   an evaluation of pesticides levels in the citrus layers (peel, albedo,
   and pulp) was carried out. The method presented acceptable trueness,
   precision, and linearity with LOQ of 5 mu g/kg. The results obtained
   showed a high frequency of fungicides class pesticides in all the citrus
   samples examined (>95\%) with the highest concentrations in the peel
   (4468 mu g/Kg). A significant difference of concentrations was found
   between the layers of the citrus fruits analysed (p < 0.05). In
   particular, the peel and albedo present higher pesticides significantly
   higher than the pulp. Our findings confirming the widespread use of
   these substances in citrus cultivation and suggesting the importance of
   pesticides analysis in all the citrus fruit layers separately,
   considering the different interactions between the physicochemical
   characteristics of the matrices and the pesticides.},

Abstract = {A total of 1104 fish samples from markets of Sicily were analysed for
   the detection and species identification of Anisakidae nematodes. The
   preliminary analysis of the fish samples showed the presence of 2459

   infestation, with a maximum of 100\% for Lepidopus caudatus and a
   minimum of 4.5\% in Sardina pilchardus. The 80\% of the larvae examined
   by PCR-RFLP analysis belonged to Anisakis pegreffii species. The
   seasonal infestation trend of Anisakis was evaluated in all the fish
   sample examined. The results of the seasonal infestation trend showed a
   marked connection with the ecological aspects of the fish species
   examined. As far as we know, this work report for the first time
   important ecological aspects of Lepidopus caudatus specimens of South
   Mediterranean. This work could be useful to plan a seasonal fishing

Abstract = {The main objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of thymol
   in controlling environmental contamination in food processing
   facilities. The effect of thymol was tested as an agent to prevent
   planktonic and bacterial biofilm growth of twenty-five
   Listeriamonocytogenes isolates from a variety of foods and five
   Escherichia coli isolates from a farm. The E. coli isolates were
   positive for extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes. All isolates
   and reference strains were susceptible to thymol at Minimum inhibitory
   concentration (MIC) values ranging from 250 to 800 mu g/mL. An
   interesting activity of interference with biofilm formation of L.
   monocytogenes and E. coli was found for thymol at sub-MIC concentrations
   of 200, 100, 75, and 50 mu g/mL. Anti-biofilm activity ranging from
   59.71\% to 66.90\% against pre-formed 24-h-old L.monocytogenes biofilms
   at concentrations of 500 or 800 mu g/mL, corresponding to 2x MIC, was
   determined against free-living forms of six isolates chosen as the best
   or moderate biofilm producers among the tested strains. The property of
   thymol to attack L.monocytogenes biofilm formation was also observed at
   a concentration of 100 mu g/mL, corresponding to 1/4 MIC, by using a
   stainless-steel model to simulate the surfaces in food industries. This
   study gives information on the use of thymol in food processing setting.},

Abstract = {The onion non-edible outside layers represent a widely available waste
   material deriving from its processing and consumption. As onion is a
   vegetable showing many beneficial properties for human health, a study
   aiming to evaluate the use of extract deriving from the non-edible
   outside layers was planned. An eco-friendly extraction method was
   optimized using a hydroalcoholic solution as solvent. The obtained
   extract was deeply characterized by in vitro methods and then formulated
   in autoadhesive, biocompatible and pain-free hydrogel polymeric films.
   The extract, very soluble in water, showed antioxidant, radical
   scavenging, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities, suggesting a
   potential dermal application for wounds treatment. In vitro studies
   showed a sustained release of the extract from the hydrogel polymeric
   film suitable to reach concentrations necessary for both antibacterial
   and anti-inflammatory activities. Test performed on human keratinocytes
   showed that the formulation is safe suggesting that the projected
   formulation could be a valuable tool for wound treatment.},

Abstract = {Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) surveillance in goats
   relies on tests initially approved for cattle, subsequently assessed for
   sheep, and approval extrapolated for use in ``small ruminants.{''} The
   current EU-approved immunodetection tests employ antibodies against
   various epitopes of the prion protein PrPSc, which is encoded by the
   host PRNP gene. The caprine PRNP gene is polymorphic, mostly at codons
   different from the ovine PRNP. The EU goat population is much more
   heterogeneous than the sheep population, with more PRNP-related
   polymorphisms, and with marked breed-related differences. The ability of
   the current tests to detect disease-specific PrPSc generated against
   these different genetic backgrounds is currently assumed, rather than
   proven. We examined whether common polymorphisms within the goat PRNP
   gene might have any adverse effect on the relative performance of
   EU-approved rapid tests. The sample panel comprised goats from the UK,
   Cyprus, France, and Italy, with either experimental or naturally
   acquired scrapie at both the preclinical and/or unknown and clinical
   stages of disease. Test sensitivity was significantly lower and more
   variable when compared using samples from animals that were preclinical
   or of unknown status. However, all of the rapid tests included in our
   study were able to correctly identify all samples from animals in the
   clinical stages of disease, apart from samples from animals polymorphic
   for serine or aspartic acid at codon 146, in which the performance of
   the Bio-Rad tests was profoundly affected. Our data show that some
   polymorphisms may adversely affect one test and not another, as well as
   underline the dangers of extrapolating from other species.},

Abstract = {Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and zoonoses indicate the
   importance of the One Health (OH) approach for early warning. At
   present, even when surveillance data are available, they are
   infrequently timeously shared between the health sectors. In the context
   of the MediLabSecure (MLS) Project, we investigated the collection of a
   set of surveillance indicators able to provide data for the
   implementation of integrated early warning systems in the 22 MLS
   countries of the Mediterranean, Black Sea and Sahel regions. We used an
   online questionnaire (covering vector, human, and animal sectors),
   focusing on seven relevant arboviruses, that was submitted to 110
   officially appointed experts. Results showed that West Nile virus was
   perceived as the most relevant zoonotic pathogen, while Dengue virus was
   the most relevant non-zoonotic pathogen in the study area. Data
   collection of early warning indicators is in place at a different level
   for all the investigated pathogens and in almost all the MLS Countries.
   Further assessments on the reliability of the collection in place and on
   the feasibility of piloting an integrated early warning system for
   arbovirus could verify if integrated early warning really represents the
   Achilles' heel of OH.},

Abstract = {The increasing population of wild boar has made this wild game species
   acquire commercial interest. Consumers appreciate this type of meat for
   its high nutritional value.
   In our research, we have compared fat composition of different types of
   meat. The loin of 9 hunted wild boars, 9 intensively kept commercial
   swines and 14 crossbreed Mora Romagnola pigs, kept in the open, have
   been sampled. Moreover, we have collected samples from ham and shoulder
   of wild boars, to identify which cut could have the most favourable
   characteristics.All animals came from Bologna District. A.O.A.C.
   Official Method 996.06 was used to determine lipid composition. Finally,
   statistical analysis was performed.
   According to our results, wild boar meat had a significantly lowest
   content of fatty acids, highest PFA:SFA ratio and highest content of w-3
   and EPA. Crossbreed Mora Romagnola registered the highest content of
   fatty acids, a low value of PUFA:SFA ratio, like the hybrid pigs, but
   the value of omega-6:omega-3 ratio was closer to that of wild boar.
   This preliminary research suggests that the wild boar meat has the most
   favourable fatty acids composition, and that crossbreed Mora Romagnola
   pigs could be considered in a middle position between wild boar and
   commercial swine.
   Future researches are needed to deepen these aspects.},

Title = {Cross-sectional serosurvey of Coxiella burnetii in healthy cattle and
   sheep from extensive grazing system in central Italy},
Journal = {EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {148},
Abstract = {A cross-sectional survey was carried out to estimate the seroprevalence
   of Coxiella burnetii in extensively grazed cattle and sheep from central
   Italy and to identify the related risk factors. Data on notified human Q
   fever cases in the area were also collected and described. A two-stage
   cluster sampling was performed. A total of 5083 animals (2210 cattle;
   2873 sheep) belonging to 186 farms (92 herds; 94 flocks) were tested for
   the presence of antibodies against C. burnetii using a commercial
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. The prevalence at the
   animal-level resulted three times higher in sheep compared to cattle
   (37.8\% vs. 12.0\%; chi(2) = 270.10, P < 0.001). The prevalence at the
   herd-level was also higher in sheep than in cattle (87.2\% vs. 68.5\%;
   chi(2) = 9.52, P < 0.01). The multivariate analysis showed a higher risk
   of seropositivity for cattle aged 67-107 months (OR 2.79, 95\% CI
   1.86-4.18), cattle >107 months of age (OR 2.07, 95\% CI 1.36-3.14) and
   mixed breed cattle (OR 1.74, 95\% CI 1.11-2.72). A herd size >92 animals
   was recognized as herd-level risk factor in cattle (OR 6.88, 95\% CI
   1.67-28.37). The risk of being seropositive was double in sheep
   belonging to flocks >600 animals (odds ratio (OR) 2.04, 95\% CI
   1.63-2.56). Sheep were confirmed to be the most exposed species.
   Nevertheless, the prevalence observed in cattle also suggests the
   potential involvement of this species in the circulation of the pathogen
   in the area. Seven confirmed human Q fever cases were reported. In five
   out of seven cases there was at least one exposed herd within a 5 km
   buffer. Even though the source of the infection was not identified, the
   possibility of C. burnetii circulating in the livestock and human
   population in the study area cannot be overlooked. The integration
   between veterinary and human surveillance will be crucial to understand
   the spread of this zoonosis and to support the adoption of appropriate
   control measures.},

   150 chicken and 80 horse meat.
   After bacteriological analysis, 12 (2.4\%) samples tested positive for
   MRSA. Isolates were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility, spa
   typing and MLST. MRSA were also investigated by PCR for the presence of
   enterotoxins, lukF-PV-lukS-PV and icaA-icaD genes. Antimicrobial
   susceptibility testing showed that MRSA isolates were multidrug
   resistant. One strain harboured PVL-encoding genes (8.3\%). Seven MRSA
   isolates of 12 (58.3\%) carried seh enterotoxin encoding gene. The icaA
   and icaD genes were both present in 10 isolates (83.3\%).
   MRSA isolates in retail meat may serve as a potential source of exposure
   to MRSA for humans and monitoring of food-producing animals and hygiene
   standards should be strictly and carefully considered throughout the
   entire meat chain to ensure food safety.},

Abstract = {Canine leishmaniasis (CanL) is a disease caused by Leishmania infantum.
   Serological methods are the most common diagnostic techniques used for
   the diagnosis of the CanL. The objective of our study was to estimate
   the sensitivity and specificity of one in-house ELISA kit (ELISA UNIZAR)
   and three commercially available serological tests (MEGACOR Diagnostik
   GmbH) including an immunochromatographic rapid test (FASTest LEISH (R)),
   an immunofluorescent antibody test (MegaFLUO LEISH (R)) and an
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MegaELISA LEISH (R)), using latent
   class models in a Bayesian analysis. Two hundred fifteen serum samples
   were included. The highest sensitivity was achieved for FASTest LEISH
   (R) (99.38\%), ELISA UNIZAR (99.37\%), MegaFLUO LEISH (R) (99.36\%)
   followed by MegaELISA LEISH (R) (98.49\%). The best specificity was
   obtained by FASTest LEISH (R) (98.43\%), followed by ELISA UNIZAR
   (97.50\%), whilst MegaFLUO LEISH (R) and MegaELISA LEISH (R) obtained
   the lower specificity (91.94\% and 91.93\%, respectively). The results
   of present study indicate that the immunochromatographic rapid test
   evaluated FASTest LEISH (R) show similar levels of sensitivity and
   specificity to the quantitative commercial tests. Among quantitative
   serological tests, sensitivity and specificity were similar considering

Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of dietary
   integration with dried licorice root on the chemical-nutritional
   qualities of goat milk and cheeses. The study was conducted for 60 d,
   during which 30 Saanen goats were divided into 2 groups: a control group
   (CC) that received a standard diet and an experimental group (LG+) whose
   diet was supplemented with licorice. At the end of the study, milk
   samples were collected to determine chemical-nutritional compositions
   and fatty acid (FA) profiles. Cheeses produced with CG and LG+ bulk milk
   were analyzed for chemical-physical parameters after 3 (T3) and 30 (T30)
   d of ripening. A different FA profile and a significant increase in
   protein and casein were observed in LG+ milk samples compared with CG
   milk. Regarding cheeses, an increase of proteins and fat was found in
   LG+ cheeses, which also were harder, more elastic, and more gummy than
   the CG samples after both 3 and 30 d of ripening. A different protein
   profile was detected in the 2 groups without significant variations in
   casein fractions (alpha(S2)-caseinand beta-casein) during ripening.
   Moreover, greater oxidative stability was found in LG+ cheeses at both
   T3 and T30. Different families of volatile compounds were detected in
   T30 cheeses obtained from both groups. A significant reduction of
   octanoic acid and an increase in nonanal and ketones were found in LG+
   T3 cheeses, whereas the LG+ T30 cheeses were characterized by a
   significant decrease of hexanoic acid an increase of 3-methyl-1-butanol
   and acetoin. We concluded that it is possible to assert that dietary
   integration with dried licorice root modified chemical and technological
   properties of goat cheeses, reducing lipid oxidation during ripening and
   inducing changes in texture that could improve consumer acceptability,
   although further studies are needed from this point of view.},

Abstract = {Human Norovirus has been reported as the major non-bacterial cause of
   human gastroenteritis due to the consumption of contaminated bivalve
   mollusks. The European legislation established microbiological criteria
   only for bacteria (Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli), while no
   viruses have still been considered. In this study, samples of Chamelea
   gallina were harvested along the Central Adriatic coasts (Italy) and
   artificially contaminated with Murine norovirus-1 (MNV-1) up to a final
   concentration of 10(3) TCID50/ml in water. They were subject to a
   depuration process in a closed-circuit system using both ozone and
   ultraviolet light. Four experimental trials (100 specimens/trial) were
   performed and, at the end of depuration, the digestive glands of
   mollusks were examined by means of two methods - namely, RT-PCR and
   tissue culture. The results of RT-PCR ranged from 10(3.17) to 10(4.60)
   TCID50/ml, and the constant presence of MNV-1 was confirmed by the
   tissue culture as well. In conclusion, no significant viral reduction
   was obtained, but the contaminated bivalve mollusks remained infectious
   until the end of the depuration treatment. The proper cooking of live
   bivalve mollusks could be considered the most important preventive
   measure against this sanitary risk.},

Title = {Geographical restriction of Hepatitis E virus circulation in wild boars
   (Sus scrofa) in Emilia-Romagna region, Northern Italy},
Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF FOOD SAFETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a single-strand RNA virus that causes an
   acute viral hepatitis in humans. Among its eight recognized genotypes,
   HEV-3 and HEV-4 are zoonotic, infecting humans, pigs and wild boars.
   Recently, HEV-3 has been also detected in red deer, which represents
   another reservoir of HEV. Consumption of raw pork products (mainly liver
   sausages), under-cooked wild boar meat, raw wild boar liver and deer
   meat has been responsible for food-borne HEV human worldwide. From
   November 2018 to March 2019, liver samples collected from 97 wild boars
   hunted in Emilia-Romagna region (Northern Italy) were tested for HEV
   RNA. The hunting area included two territories for an extension of 33
   km(2), named A (about 13 km(2), natural park, deciduous wood) and B
   (about 20 km(2), cultivated fields in proximity of a river) areas.
   Distance between the two areas ranged between 8 to 10 km. A total of 73
   wild boars were hunted in area A, and 24 in area B. HEV RNA was detected
   by Real-time RTPCR in 23/73 liver samples of wild boars living in area A
   only (31.5\% - 95\% CI: 22.0-42.8\%). The HEV sequences (n=13) clustered
   within genotype 3. The majority of positives belonged to animals < 12
   months (12/25; 48\%), followed by subadults (13-24 months) (7/16;
   43.8\%) and adults (4/32; 12.5\%). This difference was found to be
   statistically significant (p=0.0024). In absence of pig farms, the
   restriction of HEV-positive animals to a well-defined territory of 13
   km(2) (Boschi di Carrega Regional Park) could hypothetically be related
   to the presence of red deer (Cervus elaphus), which lived in area A at
   the beginning of the hunting season. Further studies are needed to
   confirm or deny our hypothesis.},

Abstract = {Streptococcus uberis is an important causative agent for clinical and
   subclinical mastitis in dairy cattle. The aim of this study was to
   develop 2 multiplex PCR assays (mPCR) for the simultaneous detection of
   virulence factors and housekeeping genes for use when investigating the
   genetic variability and distribution of Strep. uberis virulence factors.
   The tuf, cpn60, pauA, sodA, sua, oppF, and gapC genes were grouped in
   assay 1 (mPCR1) and the hasA, hasB, and hasC genes were included in
   assay 2 (mPCR2). The detection limits were 11.8 pg and 5.9 pg of DNA for
   mPCR1 and mPCR2, respectively. The 2 mPCR assays were validated with 56
   Strep. uberis strains isolated from mastitis milk samples collected from
   different bovine herds in northern Italy. Results revealed that gapC and
   oppF were detected in 98.2\% of the strains, whereas sua and hasC genes
   were detected in 94.6 and 89.2\% of the strains, respectively. The most
   common pattern was gapC+, oppP+, cpn60+, sua+, sodA+, pauA+, tuf+,
   hasA+, has13+, and hasC+, which appeared in 59\% of the strains
   analyzed. The molecular assays developed in the present study represent
   a powerful tool for the evaluation of virulence pattern distribution in
   Strep. uberis strains associated with intramammary infections.},

Title = {Validation of a Commercial Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP)
   Assay for the Rapid Detection of Anisakis spp. DNA in Processed Fish
   Products},
Journal = {FOODS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Parasites belonging to the Anisakis genera are organisms of interest for
   human health because they are responsible for the Anisakiasis zoonosis,
   caused by the ingestion of raw or undercooked fish. Furthermore, several
   authors have reported this parasite to be a relevant inducer of acute or
   chronic allergic diseases. In this work, a rapid commercial system based
   on Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) was optimised and
   validated for the sensitive and rapid detection of Anisakis spp. DNA in
   processed fish products. The specificity and sensitivity of the LAMP
   assay for processed fish samples experimentally infected with Anisakis
   spp. larvae and DNA were determined. The LAMP system proposed in this
   study was able to give positive amplification for all the processed fish
   samples artificially contaminated with Anisakis spp., giving sensitivity
   values equal to 100\%. Specificity tests provided no amplification for
   the Contracaecum, Pseudoterranova, or Hysterothylacium genera and
   uninfected samples. The limit of detection (LOD) of the LAMP assay
   proposed was 10(2) times lower than the real-time PCR method compared.
   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report regarding the
   application of the LAMP assay for the detection of Anisakis spp. in
   processed fish products. The results obtained indicate that the LAMP
   assay validated in this work could be a reliable, easy-to-use, and
   convenient tool for the rapid detection of Anisakis DNA in fish product
   inspection.},

Abstract = {The objectives of this cross-sectional study were to detect the presence
   of small ruminant lentiviral infections in Kosovo and estimate the
   serological prevalence for the year of 2016. A total of 5.272 sheep and
   435 goats were tested using a commercially available indirect
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for Maedi-Visna/Caprine
   Arthritis-Encephalitis, giving an overall individual sero-prevalence in
   sheep of 34.8\% (95\% confidence interval 31.8\% to 38.0\%), and a flock
   prevalence of 85\%, and in goats an overall individual sero-prevalence
   of 15.6\% (95\% confidence interval 7.2\% to 25.6\%) and flock
   prevalence of 35\%. Sero-prevalence in sheep was higher in the South and
   West of Kosovo, whereas in goats was higher in the East and South. There
   were no statistically significant differences in sero-prevalence between
   sheep in different age groups <2 year to >= 4 year. There were
   statistically significant differences between the age groups in goats:
   chi square 25.74 (3d.f.) with P-value <0.0001. Increasing
   sero-prevalence observed in goats up to 4 years old with a sharp drop in
   goats older than four years highlights the need for further
   investigation based on clinical impact and genotype characterization.
   While retained sero-positive sheep in the population beyond 4 years old
   may suggest mild clinical impact of small ruminant lentiviral infections
   in Kosovo sheep.},

   operated nearby sheep, poultry, cat, and dog shelters. Phlebotomine
   specimens (n = 513) collected were morphologically and molecularly
   identified as Phlebotomus perniciosus (249/513, 48.5\%), Phlebotomus
   perfiliewi (236/513; 46\%), and Sergentomyia minuta (28/513, 5.5\%).
   Sand flies were collected from the second half of May to October
   confirming the well-defined seasonal activity, which peaks in August in
   Sardinia. Overall, correlation analyses indicated a significant positive
   association between the monthly number of sand flies collected and the
   mean temperature (r = 0.88, rho = 0.87, and tau = 0.69, P < 0.05), while
   there was non-significant, moderately negative correlation between the
   monthly number of sand flies collected and the monthly mean relative
   humidity and wind (r = - 0.22, rho = 0.02, and tau = 0.04, P > 0.05).
   This study provides the first data on the molecular characterization of
   phlebotomine sand flies in this region and confirms the presence of
   three sand fly species. Molecular results suggest that the morphological
   features used for analysis represent synapomorphic-derived characters
   which are shared among descendant taxa and the common ancestor.},

Abstract = {Intolerance to wine has been investigated under different aspects. In
   our study, we explored intolerance /allergy reactions in Italy by means
   of a survey including 901 questionnaires.
   Prevalence of wine or beer intolerance was 6\%, of which 11 reported
   that was verified by a doctor. Odds ratio for wine intolerance with
   another declared allergy /intolerance is 1.6.
   In conclusion, we observed a high prevalence of intolerance to wine in
   Italy, highlighting that some sections of the population (young people
   and women) may be more exposed to these phenomena.},

Abstract = {Anthrax is a serious infectious disease caused by the gram-positive and
   spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis. In Italy, anthrax is an
   endemic disease with sporadic cases each year and few outbreaks,
   especially in Southern Italy. However, new foci have been discovered in
   zones without previous history of anthrax. During summer 2016, an
   outbreak of anthrax caused the death of four goats in the Abruzzo
   region, where the disease had not been reported before. In order to
   investigate the outbreak, we sequenced one strain and compared it to 19
   Italian B. anthracis genomes. Furthermore, we downloaded 71 whole genome
   sequences representing the global distribution of canonical SNP lineages
   and used them to verify the phylogenetic positioning. To this end, we
   analyzed and compared the genome sequences using canonical SNPs and the
   whole genome SNP-based analysis. Our results demonstrate that the
   outbreak strain belonged to the Trans-Eurasian (TEA) group A.Br.011/009,
   which is the predominant clade in Central-Southern Italy. In conclusion,
   the high genomic relatedness of the Italian TEA strains suggests their
   evolution from a common ancestor, while the spread is supposedly driven
   by trade as well as human and transhumance activities. Here, we
   demonstrated the capabilities of whole genome sequencing (WGS), which
   can be used as a tool for outbreak analyses and surveillance activities.},

Abstract = {The development of a simple and low cost electrochemical impedance
   immunosensor based on screen printed gold electrode for rapid detection
   of Escherichia coli in water is reported. The immunosensor is fabricated
   by immobilizing anti-E. coli antibodies onto a gold surface in a
   covalent way by the photochemical immobilization technique, a simple
   procedure able to bind antibodies upright onto gold surfaces. Impedance
   spectra are recorded in 0.01 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS)
   containing 10 mM Fe(CN)(6)(3-)/Fe(CN)(6)(4-) as redox probe. The Nyquist
   plots can be modelled with a modified Randles circuit, identifying the
   charge transfer resistance R-ct as the relevant parameter after the
   immobilization of antibodies, the blocking with BSA and the binding of
   E. coli. The introduction of a standard amplification procedure leads to
   a significant enhancement of the impedance increase, which allows one to
   measure E. coli in drinking water with a limit of detection of 3 x 10(1)
   CFU mL(-1) while preserving the rapidity of the method that requires
   only 1 h to provide a ``yes/no{''} response. Additionally, by applying
   the Langmuir adsorption model, we are able to describe the change of
   R-ct in terms of the ``effective{''} electrode, which is modified by the
   detection of the analyte whose microscopic conducting properties can be
   quantified.},

   analyzing a total of 104 samples of cow raw milk with the selected
   methods. Results obtained using the MBS method are comparable with those
   obtained with the plate count method at 30 degrees C (CFU/mL) and flow
   cytometry technology; in particular, the results obtained with the MBS
   method are very close to plate count's at 30 degrees C. On the other
   hand, there are statistically significant differences between these two
   methods' and flow cytometry technology's results that could be due to
   the different experimental conditions.},

Abstract = {This study was carried out to detect and characterize Coxiella burnetii
   in ruminant milk samples and in different tick species from seropositive
   farms in four Lebanese regions. Milk and tick samples were screened for
   C. burnetii presence by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) targeting
   IS1111 region followed by multispacer sequence typing (MST). The overall
   positive percentages of 9.6\% (27/282) and 95.45\% (84/88) for C.
   burnetii were recorded in ruminant milk and tick samples, respectively.
   In detail, the C. burnetii DNA was recorded in 52/54 (96.3\%) of
   Rhipicephalus annulatus, 20/21 (95.24\%) of Rhipicephalus turanicus, 6/6
   (100\%) of Hyalomma anatolicum, 5/6 (83.3\%) of Rhipicephalus sanguineus
   and 1/1 of Rhipicephalus bursa. After genotyping of some IS1111-positive
   samples (17/111), different MST genotypes were identified. Out of 15
   positive ticks, 10 were infected with MST2 genotype, 4 were infected
   with MST7 genotype and 1 was infected with MST57. Moreover, genotypes
   MST20 and MST58 were found in one cow and one goat milk samples,
   respectively. The present study confirmed the high genetic diversity of
   C. burnetii in Lebanon.},

Abstract = {Gram-positive foodborne pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes and
   Staphylococcus aureus can grow in a wide variety of foods, including raw
   milk. The aim of the study was to compare the growth of L. monocytogenes
   and S. aureus inoculated in donkey and cow samples of raw milk during a
   storage time of 11 days at 8 degrees C. Moreover, the study aimed to
   evaluate the influence of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) content on the
   growth of the two microbiological populations considered. LAB content
   was lower in raw donkey milk than in raw cow's milk during the entire
   analyses; on the other hand, pH levels were higher in the donkey milk
   rather than in the cow's milk, although both values showed a decrease at
   the day 11. S. aureus showed no significant differences in the two types
   of milk. From day 0 to 11, L. monocytogenes increased from 3.68 +/- 0.02
   log CFU/ml to 6.31 +/- 0.07 log CFU/mL and from 3.64 +/- 0.04 log CFU/mL
   to 4.59 +/- 1.04 log CFU/mL, in donkey milk and in cow's milk,
   respectively. Our results showed that donkey milk is a more favourable
   matrix to support the growth of L. monocytogenes than cow's milk.},

Abstract = {Orchitis and epididymo-orchitis are inflammatory lesions of the
   testicle. We herein describe a case of monolateral chronic orchitis
   which occurred in a Tiro Pesante Rapido (TPR) stallion, born in 2002,
   with a history of good fertility. The stallion was healthy and
   asymptomatic although the left testis was found to be smaller as
   compared with the right one and was hard in consistency. Histopathology
   examination revealed tubular atrophy and parenchymal sclerosis.
   Scattered foci of calcification and chronic inflammation, the latter
   dominated by macrophages and lymphocytes, were also observed. Although
   lesions were clearly present, the semen was demonstraed to be of good
   quality. This study highlights the need for periodic clinical and
   ultrasound evaluation of stallions, in order to preserve their
   reproductive performance.},

Title = {Isolation of Mycobacterium avium Subsp. Paratuberculosis in the Feces

   Method},
Journal = {ANIMALS},

Abstract = {Simple Summary In Italy, the field isolates of Mycobacterium avium
   subsp. Paratuberculosis in bovine and goats (type II or C) are
   frequently found while the isolation of MAP in sheep (type I or S) is
   very rare. The aim of this study was to detect field isolates of MAP in
   ovine and goats using a non-automated method with liquid media culture.
   For this purpose, five flocks were investigated by ELISA and some feces
   of positive animals were tested by quantitative polymerase chain
   reaction (qPCR). All direct PCR positive samples were tested using a
   non-automated culture method using liquid media. Positive samples were
   analyzed by typing specific-PCR in order to determine the strain type (I
   or II). Twenty-eight samples, feces and tissues, were cultivated and 12
   of these were positive by qPCR. From 12 positive samples, six strains
   resulted type I (S), from two flocks and four sheep respectively. We
   have evaluated a rapid and inexpensive culture method for the recovering
   of MAP type I, which are mycobacteria extremely growth demanding.
   Abstract Paratuberculosis is a chronic disease of ruminants caused by
   Mycobacterium avium subsp. Paratuberculosis (MAP). Since isolation of
   MAP type I (S) is rarely reported in Italy, our research was aimed at
   isolating, by an inexpensive liquid culture manual method, this type of
   MAP isolates. At first, we used an ELISA to point out to serologically
   positive samples from five flocks. Secondly, we used a fecal direct
   IS900-qPCR on the ELISA positive samples, in order to detect shedder
   animals. Feces from IS900-qPCR positive samples were inoculated in solid
   and liquid culture media. IS900-qPCR was further used to test the growth
   of MAP isolates in liquid medium, which were further confirmed by
   f57-qPCR and submitted to typing by specific PCR in order to identify
   the MAP type. Twenty-eight samples (24 fecal and four tissutal samples)
   were processed by culture methods, resulting in the isolation of six
   type I MAP field isolates. Notably, no isolates were recovered by solid
   media, underlining the utility of this liquid method. Few data about
   this type of MAP are currently available in Italy, and further analyses
   should be carried out in order to study the origin and epidemiology of
   type I strains circulating in Italy.},

Abstract = {Mycobacterium avium infection was diagnosed in an adult cat showing
   acute lameness of the right hind limb, enlargement of the right
   popliteal lymph node and two cutaneous nodular lesions of the right
   chest wall. Conventional radiography of the proximal tibia showed a
   proliferative osteolytic lesion. Cytological examination of the right
   popliteal lymph node and the nodular skin lesions fine needle aspiration
   smears, demonstrated granulomatous inflammation with many negative
   staining bacilli within macrophages or in smears background. The
   diagnosis was confirmed by Ziehl-Neelsen staining of the smears and the
   identification of mycobacteria was performed by microbiological and
   molecular methods. Histopathology performed after the necropsy revealed
   disseminated mycobacteriosis with granulomatous mesenteric
   lymphadenitis, granulomatous pneumonia, hepatitis and tibial
   osteomyelitis. M. avium is a well-known agent of gastro-enteric,
   respiratory or disseminated disease in immunocompromised cats but there
   are few cases reported in literature of bone involvement in systemic
   mycobacteriosis.},

Title = {Epidemiology, pathological aspects and genome heterogeneity of feline

Journal = {VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {240},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Feline morbillivirus (FeMV) is an emerging morbillivirus first described
   in cats less than a decade ago. FeMV has been associated with chronic
   kidney disease of cats characterized by tubulointerstitial nephritis
   (TIN), although this aspect is still controversial and not demonstrated
   with certainty. To investigate FeMV prevalence and genomic
   characteristics, an epidemiological survey was conducted in a total
   number of 127 household cats originating from two Italian regions,
   Abruzzi and Emilia-Romagna. A total number of 69 cats originating from
   three feline colonies were also enrolled for the study. Correlation with
   TIN was investigated by employing a total number of 35 carcasses.
   Prevalence of FeMV RNA was higher in urine samples collected from cats
   of colonies (P = 31.8\%, CI 95\% 22.1-43.6) compared to household cats
   (P = 8.66\%, CI 95\% 4.9-14.9) and in young and middle-aged cats while
   prevalence of FeMV Abs was higher in old cats. Sequences obtained
   straight from infected biological samples, either partial or complete,
   cluster into two clades within FeMV genotype 1, distantly related to
   FeMV genotype 2. Immunohistochemistry analysis of kidney sections of
   FeMV RNA positive cats revealed immunoreactivity within epithelial cells
   of renal tubuli and inflammatory cells. However, statistically
   significant association between FeMV and renal damages, including TIN,
   was not demonstrated (p= 0.0695, Fisher exact test). By virus
   histochemistry performed with FeMV-negative feline tissues and a FeMV
   isolate, tropism for different cellular types such as inflammatory cells
   residing in blood vessels of kidney and brain, airway epithelial cells,
   alveolar macrophages and to a lesser extent, the central nervous system,
   was demonstrated. Additional studies are warranted in order to establish
   viral tropism and immune response during the early phases of infection
   and to disentangle the role of FeMV in co-infection processes.},

Title = {A Structural Study on the Listeria Monocytogenes Internalin A-Human
   E-cadherin Interaction: A Molecular Tool to Investigate the Effects of
   Missense Mutations},

Abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes is a widespread foodborne pathogen of high
   concern and internalin A is an important virulence factor that mediates
   cell invasion upon the interaction with the host protein E-cadherin.
   Nonsense mutations of internalin A are known to reduce virulence.
   Although missense mutations are largely overlooked, they need to be
   investigated in respect to their effects in cell invasion processes.
   This work presented a computational workflow to early characterize
   internalin A missense mutations. The method reliably estimated the
   effects of a set of engineered missense mutations in terms of their
   effects on internalin A-E-cadherin interaction. Then, the effects of
   mutations of an internalin A variant from a L. monocytogenes isolate
   were calculated. Mutations showed impairing effects on complex stability
   providing a mechanistic explanation of the low cells invasion capacity
   previously observed. Overall, our results provided a rational approach
   to explain the effects of internalin A missense mutations. Moreover, our
   findings highlighted that the strength of interaction may not directly
   relate to the cell invasion capacity reflecting the non-exclusive role
   of internalin A in determining the virulence of L. monocytogenes. The
   workflow could be extended to other virulence factors providing a
   promising platform to support a better molecular understanding of L.
   monocytogenes epidemiology.},

Title = {Mercury and cadmium in striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) stranded

Abstract = {Pollution by heavy metals is becoming a serious threat to food safety
   and the health of humans and marine animals in many areas. including the
   Mediterranean Sea. Cadmium and mercury are among the most toxic of these
   metals. Their presence in various environmental compartments, which is
   partly due to human activity, inevitably leads to their bioaccumulation
   in the food chain.
   In this study, levels of cadmium and mercury were determined by means of
   Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry in liver, kidney and muscle tissues
   of specimens the dolphinid Stenella coeruleoalba stranded at various
   locations in coastal areas of the Tyrrhenian and Ionian Sea in Southern
   Italy from 2015 to 2018.
   The data were compared with those reported for other Mediterranean
   locations. Correlations between biometric data (body length, weight and
   gender) and cadmium and mercury concentrations in tissue samples from
   these specimens were statistically analyzed in order to investigate the
   risk that these contaminants may pose to the health of delphinids.
   Examination of the pattern of contaminants revealed a significantly high
   concentration of mercury in all the matrices analyzed (liver, kidney and
   muscle tissue). By contrast, elevated concentrations of cadmium were
   found only in liver (range: 0.005 - 8.95 mg/kg w.w.) and kidney (range:
   0.005 - 34.1 mg/kg w.w.), owing to the accumulator role of these organs
   during long-term exposure.},

Journal = {LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {118},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Debranning was applied to purple durum wheats to identify the debranning
   levels that provide potential functional flours naturally rich in
   bioactive compounds and low in toxic trace elements. Six debranning
   times were applied (30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180s) resulting in
   corresponding six debranned grains (DG-1 to DG-6). The content of total
   anthocyanins and polyphenols, and of ash, and essential (Cu, Mn, Zn, Se,
   Fe, Mo, Co) and toxic (Pb, Cd, Hg, As, Sn, Ni, Sr, V, Cr) trace elements
   and the antioxidant capacity were determined, In DG-1, 40\% of the
   anthocyanins and 15\% of the polyphenols were lost, and in DG-2 these
   losses were of 53\% and 23\%, respectively. At these DGs, the essential
   trace elements were mostly preserved (90.0\% and 89.5\%, respectively),
   while there was a decay of the toxic trace elements (11.0\% and 24.5\%,
   respectively). Debranning is confirmed as a useful technology to obtain
   improved flours.},

Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Caretta caretta is threatened by many dangers in the Mediterranean
   basin, but most are human-related. The purposes of this research were:
   (i) to investigate microflora in samples from six loggerhead sea turtle
   nests located on the Sicilian coast and (ii) to understand microbial
   diversity associated with nests, with particular attention to bacteria
   and fungi involved in failed hatchings. During the 2016 and 2018
   summers, 456 eggs and seven dead hatchling from six nests were
   collected. We performed bacteriological and mycological analyses on 88
   egg samples and seven dead hatchlings, allowing us to isolate: Fusarium
   spp. (80.6\%), Aeromonas hydrophila (55.6\%), Aspergillus spp. (27.2\%)
   and Citrobacter freundii (9\%). Two Fusarium species were identified by
   microscopy and were confirmed by PCR and internal transcribed spacer
   sequencing. Statistical analyses showed significant differences between
   nests and the presence/absence of microflora, whereas no significant
   differences were observed between eggs and nests. This is the first
   report that catalogues microflora from C. caretta nests/eggs in the
   Mediterranean Sea and provides key information on potential pathogens
   that may affect hatching success. Moreover, our results suggest the need
   for wider investigations over extensive areas to identify other
   microflora, and to better understand hatching failures and mortality
   related to microbial contamination in this important turtle species.},

Abstract = {Introduction. Taranto is of particular Public Health relevance for the
   presence of industrial sources of dioxins and PCBs. The aim of this
   study was to monitor these pollutants in mussels produced from 2012 to
   2018.
   Materials and methods. Mussels were collected on a monthly basis with
   random sampling. Concentrations were determined through accredited
   methods.
   Results. 622 samples were collected. Dioxins and PCBs showed higher
   median concentrations in Mar Piccolo 1st Inlet (p (s) <0.0001; Dioxins:
   1.43 pg WHO-TEQ/g ww; Dioxins+DL-PCBs: 5.98 pg WHO-TEQ/g ww; DL-PCBs:
   4.57 pg WHO-TEQ/g ww; NDL-PCBs: 61.54 ng/g ww) and in III trimester for
   all basins (p (s) <0.02). In Mar Piccolo 1 st Inlet, there was a linear
   increase of dioxins and PCBs moving North (p (s) <0.05).
   Conclusions. These findings confirmed higher concentrations in Mar
   Piccolo 1 st Inlet during the summer period and supported the validity
   of the Public Health measures adopted by the Department of Prevention of
   Taranto.},

Abstract = {Information on demographic and life-history traits of endangered
   vertebrate species, such as sea turtles, is crucial for planning
   management and conservation actions. We applied skeletochronology of
   phalanges to estimate the age of loggerhead turtles, Caretta caretta,
   found dead stranded along the beaches of Campania (western
   Mediterranean) from 2013 to 2017. To obtain maturity data, we examined
   gonads from a subsample of 7 males and 11 females. Overall, curved
   carapace length (CCL) ranged from 5.6 to 90.8 cm, but for most turtles
   (89\%) it was 50-79.9 cm. Predominance of stranded females (62\%) was
   recorded. Ten out of the eighteen histologically examined gonads allowed
   estimating maturity. Based on the lines of arrested growth counting, the
   estimated age of the examined specimens ranged from 0 (hatchling) to 26
   years. The modal age was 14 years for males and 17 years for females.
   The smallest male with spermatogenetic activity had a CCL of 65 cm and
   was estimated to be 16 years old. The smallest female with follicular
   development stage, characterising the transition towards adulthood, had
   a CCL of 69.5 cm and was estimated to be 20 years old. Anthropogenic
   factors were responsible for 36\% of the mortality of individuals,
   followed by parasitic/infective pathologies (20\%).},

Abstract = {Mycobacterium bovis and related members of the Mycobacterium
   tuberculosis complex (MTBC) are the etiological agents of tuberculosis.
   Increasing attention has recently been paid to the role played by wild
   animals in the epidemiology of tuberculosis and particularly regarding
   the Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa). Thus, we performed a
   cross-sectional survey in wild boar in Campania region to assess the
   seroprevalence against Mycobacterium bovis or cross-reacting members of
   the MTBC. Fourty six out of 434 (10.6\%; 95\% CI 7.71-13.49\%) sampled
   animals presented antibodies against M. bovis by MPB83-ELISA.
   Statistical analysis indicated that the seropositivity to MTBC was not
   associated with age, gender, or location of sampling. We also evaluated
   the correlation between the seropositivity in wild boar and the presence
   of tuberculosis outbreaks in livestock. Our results suggest that wild
   boar exposure to MTBC is probably related to the presence of
   tuberculosis in livestock. The average distance between a positive wild
   boar and the nearest tuberculosis outbreak in cattle was 7.38 km, lower
   than the expected mean. In conclusion, the seroprevalence observed in
   the present study indicates a moderate exposure to MTBC in wild boar in
   Campania region, which may have important implications not only for
   conservation but also for animal and public health.},

Abstract = {Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a malignant mucoepithelial tumor that
   affects pets and farm animals. Common sites are dorsal areas and/or
   areas of poor skin pigmentation exposed to mutagenic ultraviolet (UV)
   radiation. Novel ovine papillomavirus (OaPV3) was recently described in
   SCC lesions in Sardinia breed ovines. In 2017, a 7-year-old half-breed
   aries was presented with symptoms compatible with a vestibular syndrome.
   The animal was euthanized 1 month after the onset of clinical signs due
   to a lack of response to treatment and poor prognosis. A complete
   postmortem examination was performed. Necropsy revealed only a loss of
   incisors, associated with alveolar necrotic osteomyelitis, and left
   unilateral purulent nasal discharge. No other thoracic or abdominal
   lesions were observed. Opening of the skull revealed a cauliflower-like
   space-occupying mass. Histological examination showed trabecules and
   islands of squamous, neoplastic epithelial cells with the formation of
   concentric keratin layers. This raised the suspicion of SCC, which was
   confirmed with cytokeratin-positive immunostaining. Simplex PCR on the
   frozen tissue mass was negative for OaPV1, OaPV2, and OaPV3. This case
   report suggests that SCC, although rare, should be included in the
   differential diagnosis of cases of vestibular disorder.},

   The mother developed the disease immediately after childbirth and

Abstract = {This paper describes the first confirmed case of a subclinical mastitis
   caused by Yersinia pseudotuberculosis in a dairy cow from Italy. Milk
   samples from an adult cow of the Bruna breed were analyzed accordingly
   to standard milk cultivation protocols. Bacteriological examinations
   allowed to isolate atypical Gram-negative rods identified as Y.
   pseudotuberculosis using biochemical tests. The isolate was subjected to
   Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and the species identification was
   confirmed using rMLST. Moreover, the virulence and antibacterial
   susceptibility of the isolate have been also determined. The most common
   virulence genes were screened through WGS, showing the presence of inv,
   ail, pil and HPI genes. No antibiotic resistance was found. Even though
   scarcely described as causal agent of subclinical mastitis, the
   detection of Y. pseudotubercolusosis suggests that this pathogen could
   be spread to humans through raw milk, representing a potential food
   safety hazard},

   outbreak investigations and genomic comparisons. In this study, six
   enterotoxigenic S. aureus strains were characterised using a combination
   of molecular, phenotypical and computational methods. The genomes were
   analysed for the presence of virulence factors (VFs), where we
   identified 110 genes and classified them into five categories: adherence
   (n = 31), exoenzymes (n = 28), genes involved in host immune system
   evasion (n = 7); iron uptake regulatory system (n = 8); secretion
   machinery factors and toxins' genes (n = 36), and 39 genes coding for
   transcriptional regulators related to staphylococcal VFs. Each group of
   VFs revealed correlations among the six enterotoxigenic strains, and
   further analysis revealed their accessory genomic content, including
   mobile genetic elements. The plasmids pLUH02 and pSK67 were detected in
   the strain ProNaCC1 and ProNaCC7, respectively, carrying out the genes
   sed, ser, and selj. The genes carried out by prophages were detected in
   the strain ProNaCC2 (see), ProNaCC4, and ProNaCC7 (both positive for
   sea). The strain ProNaCC5 resulted positive for the genes seg, sei, sem,
   sen, seo grouped in an exotoxin gene cluster, and the strain ProNaCC6
   resulted positive for seh, a transposon-associated gene. The six strains
   were used for the production of naturally contaminated cheeses which
   were tested with the European Screening Method for staphylococcal
   enterotoxins. The results obtained from the analysis of toxins produced
   in cheese, combined with the genomic features represent a portrait of
   the strains that can be used for the production of staphylococcal
   enterotoxin-positive cheese as reference material.},

Abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a contagious chronic disease associated
   with progressive emaciation (starvation) and tubercles (granuloma)
   formation commonly caused by Mycobacterium bovis. In cattle, M. caprae
   may also be responsible for bTB. In EU, human tuberculosis due to M.
   bovis had a notification rate of 0.04 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in
   2017, but data did not include M. caprae infections. From September 2018
   to April 2019, bTB outbreaks were investigated in three neighbouring
   dairy cattle herds in Parma province, Northern Italy. Parma municipality
   belongs to an officially free of bovine tuberculosis (OTF) Italian
   region. Official testing on cattle herds, performed every three years as
   legally required, revealed no positive animals. Tubercular lesions were
   found during the post mortem (PM) examination of slaughtered cattle and
   M. caprae genotype SB0418/VNTR 4,3,5,3,4,5,2,2,4, 3,15,5 was isolated.
   This report confirms the crucial importance of PM veterinary inspection

Title = {Animal-based measures on fattening heavy pigs at the slaughterhouse and
   the association with animal welfare at the farm level: a preliminary
   study},
Journal = {ANIMAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Monitoring animal welfare (AW) in pig farms requires both proper
   indicators and a feasible approach. Animal-based measures (ABMs) are
   well-established AW indicators. Furthermore, AW screening at the
   slaughterhouses could be useful for identifying problems on farm. The
   aim of this study was to evaluate ABMs at the slaughterhouse and, when
   possible, to compare these ABMs with those collected on the farm. The
   study was carried out in northern Italy in a commercial abattoir and in
   a sample of farms. Animal-based measures were recorded on pigs from 62
   batches of 54 farms, during ante-mortem (n=10 085 pigs) and post-mortem
   (n=7952 pigs) inspections. Sixteen of 54 farms were selected to compare
   ABMs collected at the slaughterhouse with ABMs collected on the farm.
   Overall, 2295 pigs (mean pigs examined per farm 119 +/- 45) were
   inspected at the slaughterhouse (group S) and 420 pigs (mean pigs per
   farm 26 +/- 5) on the farm (group F). Non-animal-based measures were
   also collected at the 16 farms. Differences between groups S and F, at
   the animal level, were assessed by a two-tailed paired
   Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. Differences at the site of observation level
   (farm and slaughterhouse) were assessed by Fisher's exact test using a
   hierarchical log-linear modelling for contingency tables. The most
   frequent ABMs at the slaughterhouse were manure on the body (47.7\%),
   followed by dermatitis (28.0\%), white spot (25.4\%) and bursitis
   (24.7\%). Recording ABMs at the slaughterhouse and on the farm usually
   yielded similar results; however, there were some exceptions. In
   particular, significant differences were found for non-uniformity of
   size (P<0.05) and dermatitis (P<0.001), which were higher at the
   slaughterhouse than on the farm. Results of log-linear modelling
   underlined the effect of the farm of origin on the percentage of pigs
   with bursitis, manure on the body and ear injuries that were observed at
   the slaughterhouse. In group S, significant associations between manure
   on the body and insufficient presence of clean and dry areas in the
   corresponding farm were found (P<0.05). Although these results should be
   interpreted with care due to the limited sample of farms, the
   slaughterhouse could be a feasible site of observation of ABMs, which
   could then be integrated in monitoring of AW on farm. Considering the
   number of slaughtered batches per farm, it would be possible to repeat
   assessments several times throughout the year for each farm, which could
   help provide an index for the continuous monitoring of AW.},

Abstract = {Hyperoxaluria is a pathological condition which affects long-term health
   of kidneys. The present study evaluates the impact of the combination of
   Lactobacillus amylovorus SGL 14 and the plant extract Phyllantus niruri
   (namely Phyllantin 14 (TM)) on dietary hyperoxaluria. Safety and
   efficacy of Phyllantin 14 have been evaluated in vivo. Mice C57BL6 fed a
   high-oxalate diet were compared to mice fed the same diet administered
   with Phyllantin 14 by gavage for 6 weeks. Control mice were fed a
   standard diet without oxalate. No adverse effects were associated to
   Phyllantin 14 supplementation, supporting its safety. Mice fed a
   high-oxalate diet developed significant hyperoxaluria and those
   administered with Phyllantin 14 showed a reduced level of urinary
   oxalate and a lower oxalate-to-creatinine ratio. Soluble and insoluble
   caecal oxalate were significantly lower in treated group, a finding in
   agreement with the colonisation study, i.e. mice were colonised with SGL
   14 after 3 weeks. Microbiota analysis demonstrated that both oxalate
   diet and Phyllantin 14 can differently modulate the microbiota. In
   conclusion, our findings suggest that Phyllantin 14 supplementation
   represents a potential supportive approach for reducing urinary oxalate
   and/or for enhancing the efficacy of existing treatments.},

Abstract = {Parvoviruses (PV) can cause outbreaks with high morbidity and mortality
   in dogs and cats. Even if typical cases exist in puppies and kittens, PV
   infection (PVI) can have many different clinical presentations, making
   the laboratory support necessary. The aim of this work was to evaluate
   retrospectively the frequency of misdiagnoses, particularly missed
   diagnoses, of PVI in 144 suspected cases (88 clinical cases and 56
   necropsies) involving 96 dogs and 48 cats. A nested PCR test was chosen
   as the gold standard. An index of diagnostic suspicion (IDS) for PVI,
   based on parameters reported upon submittal of the samples, was
   introduced to classify the initial diagnoses issued by veterinarians.
   The agreement between the IDS of PVI and PCR results was calculated. The
   effect of species, age and clinical versus necroscopic presentation was
   evaluated by logistic regression. In 63.6\% of the cases, the IDS was
   confirmed by the PCR, whereas in 36.4\% there was a missed diagnosis or
   a diagnosis wrongly attributed to PVI. More accurate results were
   obtained for dogs, animals aged < 1 year, and necropsies. Parvovirus
   infection should be better investigated in patients with atypical or few
   clinical signs, in particular in cats and animals over 1 year old.},

Title = {A quantitative comparison of West Nile virus incidence from 2013 to 2018

Journal = {PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES},

Abstract = {Background
   West Nile virus (WNV) transmission was much greater in 2018 than in
   previous seasons in Europe. Focusing on Emilia-Romagna region (northern
   Italy), we analyzed detailed entomological and epidemiological data
   collected in 2013-2018 to quantitatively assess environmental drivers of
   transmission and explore hypotheses to better understand why the 2018
   epidemiological season was substantially different than the previous
   seasons. In particular, in 2018 WNV was detected at least two weeks
   before the observed circulation in 2013-2017 and in a larger number of
   mosquito pools. Transmission resulted in 100 neuroinvasive human cases
   in the region, more than the total number of cases recorded between 2013
   and 2017.
   Methodology
   We used temperature-driven mathematical models calibrated through a
   Bayesian approach to simulate mosquito population dynamics and WNV
   infection rates in the avian population. We then estimated the human
   transmission risk as the probability, for a person living in the study
   area, of being bitten by an infectious mosquito in a given week.
   Finally, we translated such risk into reported WNV human infections.
   Principal findings
   The estimated prevalence of WNV in the mosquito and avian populations
   were significantly higher in 2018 with respect to 2013-2017 seasons,
   especially in the eastern part of the region. Furthermore, peak avian
   prevalence was estimated to have occurred earlier, corresponding to a
   steeper decline towards the end of summer. The high mosquito prevalence
   resulted in a much greater predicted risk for human transmission in
   2018, which was estimated to be up to eight times higher than previous
   seasons. We hypothesized, on the basis of our modelling results, that
   such greater WNV circulation might be partially explained by
   exceptionally high spring temperatures, which have likely helped to
   amplify WNV transmission at the beginning of the 2018 season.},

Title = {A Survey from 2015 to 2019 to Investigate the Occurrence of Pesticide
   Residues in Dead Honeybees and Other Matrices Related to Honeybee
   Mortality Incidents in Italy},

Abstract = {Honeybee health can be compromised not only by infectious and infesting
   diseases, but also by the acute or chronic action of certain pesticides.
   In recent years, there have been numerous reports of colony mortality by
   Italian beekeepers, but the investigations of these losses have been
   inconsistent, both in relation to the type of personnel involved
   (beekeepers, official veterinarians, members of the police force, etc.)
   and the procedures utilized. It was therefore deemed necessary to draw
   up national guidelines with the aim of standardizing sampling active
   ties. In this paper, we present the results of a survey carried out in
   Italy from 2015 to 2019, following these guidelines. Residues of 150
   pesticides in 696 samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS. On
   average, 50\% of the honeybee samples were positive for one or more
   pesticides with an average of 2 different pesticides per sample and a
   maximum of seven active ingredients, some of which had been banned in
   Europe or were not authorized in Italy. Insecticides were the most
   frequently detected, mainly belonging to the pyrethroid group (49\%,
   above all tau-fluvalinate), followed by organophosphates (chlorpyrifos,
   18\%) and neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, 7\%). This work provides further
   evidence of the possible relationship between complex pesticide exposure
   and honeybee mortality and/or depopulation of hives.},

Abstract = {Proteoglycans are macromolecules that are essential for the development
   of cells, human diseases and malignancies. In particular, chondroitin
   sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs) accumulate in tumour stroma and play a
   key role in tumour growth and invasion by driving multiple oncogenic
   pathways in tumour cells and promoting crucial interactions in the
   tumour microenvironment (TME). These pathways involve receptor tyrosine
   kinase (RTK) signalling via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
   cascade and integrin signalling via the activation of focal adhesion
   kinase (FAK), which sustains the activation of extracellular
   signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2).
   Human CSPG4 is a type I transmembrane protein that is associated with
   the growth and progression of human brain tumours. It regulates cell
   signalling and migration by interacting with components of the
   extracellular matrix, extracellular ligands, growth factor receptors,
   intracellular enzymes and structural proteins. Its overexpression by
   tumour cells, perivascular cells and precursor/progenitor cells in
   gliomas suggests that it plays a role in their origin, progression and
   neo-angiogenesis and its aberrant expression in tumour cells may be a
   promising biomarker to monitor malignant progression and patient
   survival.
   The aim of this chapter is to review and discuss the role of CSPG4 in
   the TME of human gliomas, including its potential as a druggable
   therapeutic target.},

Abstract = {Introduction. Turmeric is the common name for the rhizome of Curcuma
   longa L. In the recent years, food supplements containing turmeric have
   been marketed and widely used by an increasing number of consumers.
   Spontaneous reports of suspected adverse reactions to food supplements
   are collected within the Phytovigilance system.
   Methods. An ad hoc multidisciplinary group investigated the suspected
   cases of hepatotoxicity reported to the Italian Phytovigilance system
   associated with the assumption of turmeric food supplements with the
   methodology specific to pharmacovigilance as well as for the evaluation
   of the quality and safety of food supplements.
   Results. A cluster of 28 spontaneous reports of acute hepatitis, mostly
   with cholestasis, associated with turmeric products were sent to the
   Italian Phytovigilance system in the first six months of 2019. In all
   cases, except one, the causality assessment was at least possible. The
   suspected products were collected and analysed for the presence of
   drugs, heavy metals, aflatoxins, pesticides, synthetic dyes and
   pyrrolizidine alkaloids.
   Conclusion. On the basis of the results of all the activities performed
   by multidisciplinary group, regulatory intervention was taken. This
   study highlights the importance of developing an integrated evaluation
   approach for the evaluation of the adverse effects associated with the
   use of food supplements.},

Abstract = {Seven bifidobacterial strains were isolated from the faeces of two adult
   males of the two-toed sloth (Choloepus didactylus) housed in Parco
   Natura Viva, in Italy. Comparative sequence analysis of 16S rRNA and of
   five housekeeping (hsp60, rpoB, clpC, dnaJ, dnaG) genes revealed that
   these strains were classified into two clusters. On the basis of 16S
   rRNA gene sequence similarity, the type strain of Bifidobacterium
   catenulatum subsp. kashiwanohense DSM 21854(T) (95.4 \%) was the closest
   neighbour to strain in Cluster I (BRDM 6(T)), whereas the type strain of
   Bifidobacterium dentium DSM 20436(T) (values were in the range of
   98.99.8 \%) was the closest neighbour to the other six strains in
   Cluster II. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) values of BRDM 6(T)
   and of strains in Cluster II with the closely related type strains were
   76.0 and 98.9 \% (mean value) respectively. Therefore, genotyping based
   on the genome sequence of the strain BRDM 6(T) combined with phenotypic
   analyses clearly revealed that the strain BRDM 6(T) represents a novel
   species for which the names Bifidobacterium choloepi sp. nov. (BRDM
   6(T)=NBRC 114053(T)=BCRC 81222(T)) is proposed.},

   concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay. From the box plots, it
   is evident that the hair cortisol concentrations of animals were
   different between farms. Conversely, the variability of the hair DHEA-S
   concentration was similar between the F1 and F2 farms but much lower at
   F3. For all the variables considered (cortisol, DHEA-S and
   cortisol/DHEA-S ratio), F2 showed a higher hair concentration level than
   F1 (P < 0.05). The study's results indicate that the measurement of
   cortisol and DHEA-S in pig hair shows a different allostatic load
   between them, although the official welfare evaluation method assessed
   the farms as having good overall animal welfare.},

Abstract = {Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (SP) and methicillin-resistant SP (MRSP)
   is one of the most important veterinary pathogens in the dog. Herein,
   from a total of 126 S. pseudintermedius strains, 23 MRSP (18\%) were
   identified. Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) revealed that most of
   MRSP strains belonged to ST71 (26\%), which have been already reported
   in Italy and other countries. Interestingly, nine new sequence types
   (39\%), from 1053 up to 1061, were described for the first time.
   Moreover, the isolated MRSP strains showed relevant antibiotic
   resistance profiles. This report highlights the circulation of new
   sequence types of MRSP in Italy and underlines the need of a global
   epidemiological surveillance to limit the increasing spread of
   multidrug-resistant MRSP strains worldwide, since they may represent a
   considerable concern for dog's health.},

Abstract = {Objectives: Human leishmaniasis can be severe and fatal, yet in the
   Mediterranean region only a small percentage of infections progress to
   clinical disease. We evaluated the percentage of asymptomatic Leishmania
   infection in the Bologna province, northeastern Italy.
   Methods: We examined the presence of specific antibodies by Western Blot
   (WB) and parasitic DNA by real time PCR in peripheral blood of 240 blood
   donors residing in the Bologna province.
   Results: Anti-Leishmania IgG were detected by WB in 27 subjects (11.2\%,
   95\% CI 7\%-15\%), while Leishmania kinetoplast DNA was detected in
   peripheral blood specimens of 4 out of 240 donors (1.7\%, 95\% CI
   0.2\%3.2\%). Overall, the prevalence of Leishmania infection in the
   blood donor cohort was 12.5\%, thus indicating an elevated cumulative
   exposure to the Leishmania parasite in the examined municipality.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that a surveillance system for
   monitoring Leishmania infection in blood donors and/or strategies of
   protozoan inactivation in whole blood should be taken into consideration
   in areas with circulation of the Leishmania parasite. (C) 2019 The

Abstract = {The present work was carried out to investigate the Antimicrobial
   Resistance (AMR) of enterococci isolated from raw ewes' and cows' milk.
   The samples were collected from eighteen semi-extensive dairy sheep and
   cow farms throughout western Sicily. Plate counts, carried out on Rapid
   Enterococcus Agar commonly used to detect food enterococci, revealed a
   maximal enterococcal concentration of approximately 4.58 Log Colony
   Forming Unit (CFU)/mL. Colonies were isolated and differentiated based
   on genetic analysis by Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR.
   Thirty-eight different strains were identified. Analysis by a
   species-specific multiplex PCR assay grouped the strains into three
   Enterococcus species such as Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis
   and Enterococcus faecium. The 38 strains were also investigated for
   their antimicrobial resistance by a phenotypic approach. All 38
   Enterococcus displayed resistance to at least one or more of the
   antimicrobials tested confirmed that the dairy enterococci could be a
   vector for the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. This work
   showed that enterococci with AMR traits are commonly present in
   semi-extensive dairy sheep and cow farms of western Sicily pointed out
   the relevance of informing dairy makers and veterinary regarding the
   antimicrobial use in order to mitigate problems of public health and

Title = {Macrobenthic invertebrates as tracers of rare earth elements in

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {698},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Rare earth elements (REEs) are emergent contaminants in aquatic
   ecosystems in parallel with their growing use in science, technology,
   and industry. In this study we measured the concentration of 16 REEs in
   freshwater marcobenthic invertebrates from 6 watercourses in northeast
   Italy to determine their potential use as ecological tracers of REEs in
   aquatic ecosystems. The total REE concentration at the sampling sites
   followed this order: site 6 (7.05 mg Kg(-1)) > site 3 (5.76 mg Kg(-1)) >
   site 4 (3.58 mg Kg(-1)) > site 1 (3.0 mg Kg(-1)) > site 5 (2.36 mg
   Kg(-1)) > site 2 (1.95 mg Kg(-1)). There were no significant differences
   in REE concentrations across the six samplings sites (Kruskal Wallis
   test, p - 0.1773), but two (site 3 and 6) had higher amount of REEs and
   were classified with the ecological status ``Moderate{''} sensu Water
   Framework Directive since affected by anthropogenic activities. Light
   REE were always greater than heavy REE concentrations at all six sites.
   A positive correlation was observed between certain REEs (La, Ce, Gd)
   and the density of genera Caenis and Baetis (Ehemeroptera,
   collector-gatherers) (pS range 0.795-0.812), suggesting that
   non-predatory macrobenthic invertebrates accumulate more REEs than
   predatory organisms and that the intake of sediment is the most
   effective route of assimilation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Phylogenetic insights on Leishmania detected in cats as revealed by
   nucleotide sequence analysis of multiple genetic markers},
Journal = {INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {77},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Cats have been found infected by the same Leishmania species that also
   infect dogs and humans in both the New and Old Worlds, and their role as
   additional reservoir hosts of L. infantum has been previously suggested.
   Currently, the genetic diversity of Leishmania spp. detected in cats is
   poorly understood. In this cross-sectional study, the partial nucleotide
   sequences of four gene markers (cytB, g6pdh, hsp70 and ITS-rDNA) were
   explored to investigate the genetic diversity and the phylogenetic
   relationships of Leishmania parasites detected in cats. A total of 25
   cat buffy coat samples where the presence of Leishmania SSU-rDNA was
   revealed by PCR (from a convenience sample of 465 cats screened), as
   well as six Leishmania strains previously isolated from cats, were
   included in this study. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the majority
   of Leishmania parasites detected in cats did not display distinctive
   genetic features, sharing the same genetic types with L. infantum
   strains isolated from humans, dogs and phlebotomine sand flies.
   Unexpectedly, DNA of L. major and/or of a L. major/L. donovani sensu
   lato hybrid was detected in buffy coat samples of two cats from
   different regions of Portugal. However, a mix infection hypothesis
   cannot be formally excluded. To our knowledge, this study represents the
   first evidence for the presence of DNA of Leishmania hybrid parasites in
   cats. The results reported here not only reinforce the idea that cats
   play a role in the epidemiology of zoonotic leishmaniosis but also
   indicate the circulation of L. major and/or L. major/L. donovani s.l.
   hybrid parasites in Portugal. Also, whenever sequencing of whole
   Leishmania genomes regularly cannot be accomplished, and while their
   complete genomes remain under-represented in the nucleotide sequence
   databases, the combined use of multiple genetic markers, including
   kinetoplast maxicircle DNA, seems to be essential for typing of
   Leishmania parasites.},

   the selectivity of the method, 26 Campylobacter strains and 40
   non-Campylobacter strains were tested and in order to verify the
   application of Real-Time PCR method, 5 pork meat samples were
   experimentally inoculated with a Campylobacter jejuni strain.
   Subsequently, dilutions with a bacterial load of Campylobacter jejuni
   within 10-10(6) CFU/mL were chosen for the optimization of the ddPCR
   assay. Lastly, a total of 54 naturally contaminated foods samples were
   analyzed through molecular (Real-Time PCR and ddPCR) and traditional
   methods. The Real-Time PCR protocol demonstrated to amplify only the
   Campylobacter spp. strains and when Campylobacter jejuni was
   experimentally inoculated in meat samples the pathogen was always
   detected. The ddPCRs assay allowed to quantify a level of contamination
   of 10 CFU/mL, but it was unable to quantify levels of 10(5) - 10(6)
   CFU/mL. Lastly, Campylobacter spp. was never detected in the 54 samples
   tested. In conclusion, the novel analytic approach proposed, based on an
   initial screening of the samples with Real-Time PCR and then on
   quantification of Campylobacter spp. with a ddPCR on those positive,
   represents a quick monitoring tool and, if used correctly, it would
   allow the implementation of food safety.},

Title = {Distinguishing between Fresh and Frozen-Thawed Smoked Salmon: Histology
   To Detect Food Adulteration in High-Value Products},

Abstract = {The issue of food safety has acquired increased importance, and fraud is
   a major concern for the food industry. Among different types of food
   adulteration, there is the sale of frozen-thawed smoked salmon product
   as fresh, which not only decreases the quality of products but also
   misleads consumers and may involve associated health risks. In response
   to this problem, we tested the performance of histology to identify
   smoked salmon as fresh or frozen-thawed as a valid analytical method, so
   food business operators and official controllers can reliably and
   correctly classify the storage state of the product. Three groups of
   samples were prepared: group A (n = 36), fresh samples; group B (n =
   36), frozen at similar to 18 degrees C for 30 days; and group C (n 1/4
   36), stored at -3 degrees C for 30 days after packaging. Two
   histopathologists examined all samples in blind evaluations and
   classified them as fresh or frozen-thawed. Sensitivity, specificity, and
   interrater agreement were calculated. Results show high performance with
   the test: 80.6\% sensitivity (95\% confidence intervals {[}CI]: 64 to
   91.8\%); 95.6\% specificity (95\% CI: 89.1 to 98.8\%); and Cohen's kappa
   was 0.81 (95\% CI: 0.64 to 0.98\%). Histology is a reliable and highly
   accurate method to differentiate fresh from frozen-thawed smoked salmon
   and could be used by the industry and official controllers to verify the
   labeling of the commercial product.},

Title = {A representative sampling of tuna muscle for mercury control},
Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF FOOD SAFETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {The mechanisms of mercury accumulation and distribution in fish tissues
   are related to its high affinity for sulfhydryl groups in proteins.
   There is evidence that mercury is distributed unevenly based on the
   different reactivity of these groups in the various muscle proteins.
   Tuna fish also shows numerous specialized anatomical features including
   the structure of the swimming muscles and some form of endothermy, which
   generates variations in the mercury content between dark and white
   muscle and between muscle tissues with different lipid content. The aim
   of the study is to verify, through a suitable sub lot of Thunnus thynnus
   caught by a static trap in south-western Sardinia, the effective uneven
   distribution of mercury in the various muscles and also identify the
   sites representative of the entire carcass. In agreement with other
   authors, the results show that even in the Bluefin tuna of the
   Mediterranean, the site ``anterior extremity of upper loin (schienale in
   Italian){''} is representative of the mercury average content of muscle
   tissues as a whole.},

Title = {Relationship of Late Lactation Milk Somatic Cell Count and Cathelicidin
   with Intramammary Infection in Small Ruminants},
Journal = {PATHOGENS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Late lactation is a critical moment for making mastitis management
   decisions, but in small ruminants the reliability of diagnostic tests is
   typically lower at this stage. We evaluated somatic cell counts (SCC)
   and cathelicidins (CATH) in late lactation sheep and goat milk for their
   relationship with intramammary infections (IMI), as diagnosed by
   bacteriological culture (BC). A total of 315 sheep and 223 goat
   half-udder milk samples collected in the last month of lactation were
   included in the study. IMI prevalence was 10.79\% and 15.25\%,
   respectively, and non-aureus staphylococci were the most common finding.
   Taking BC as a reference, the diagnostic performance of SCC and CATH was
   quite different in the two species. In sheep, receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) analysis produced a higher area under the curve
   (AUC) value for CATH than SCC (0.9041 versus 0.8829, respectively).
   Accordingly, CATH demonstrated a higher specificity than SCC (82.92\%
   versus 73.67\%, respectively) at comparable sensitivity (91.18\%).
   Therefore, CATH showed a markedly superior diagnostic performance than
   SCC in late lactation sheep milk. In goats, AUC was <0.67 for both
   parameters, and CATH was less specific than SCC (61.90\% versus 65.08\%)
   at comparable sensitivity (64.71\%). Therefore, both CATH and SCC
   performed poorly in late lactation goats. In conclusion, sheep can be
   screened for mastitis at the end of lactation, while goats should
   preferably be tested at peak lactation. In late lactation sheep, CATH
   should be preferred over SCC for its higher specificity, but careful
   cost/benefit evaluations will have to be made.},

Abstract = {The emergence and rapid worldwide spread of a novel pandemic of acute
   respiratory disease - eventually named coronavirus disease 2019
   (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO) - across the human
   population has raised great concerns. It prompted a mobilization around
   the globe to study the underlying pathogen, a close relative of severe
   acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) called severe acute
   respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Numerous genome
   sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are now available and in-depth analyses are
   advancing. These will allow detailed characterization of sequence and
   protein functions, including comparative studies. Care should be taken
   when inferring function from sequence information alone, and reverse
   genetics systems can be used to unequivocally identify key features. For
   example, the molecular markers of virulence, host range and
   transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 can be compared to those of related
   viruses in order to shed light on the biology of this emerging pathogen.
   Here, we summarize some recent insights from genomic studies and
   strategies for reverse genetics systems to generate recombinant viruses,
   which will be useful to investigate viral genome properties and
   evolution.},

   reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay and
   histopathology. The efficiency, sensitivity and reproducibility of the
   newly described qPCR assay were also determined. The highest prevalence
   was detected using the qPCR assay, and the strongest linear correlation
   was obtained between the RFTM infection levels and the threshold cycle
   (Ct) number from the gill tissue. Although better results were obtained
   from gill than from the hemolymph in the qPCR assays, especially with
   lower infection levels of the parasite, a significant linear correlation

Title = {Ochratoxin A contamination of the casing and the edible portion of
   artisan salamis produced in two Italian regions},
Journal = {WORLD MYCOTOXIN JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Pages = {553-562},
Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to provide data on the presence of
   ochratoxin A (OTA) in artisan salamis produced in the Campania and
   Marche regions (Italy). For this aim, 96 different salamis were
   purchased from farms and small salami factories. Analysis were carried
   out firstly on the casings of all samples, and in a second step, in the
   outer and inner edible parts of those samples whose casings were found
   positive for OTA at concentration levels above the Italian guideline
   value established for OTA in pork meat (1 mu g/kg). The analytical
   method, based on a sample preparation procedure with immunoaffinity
   columns, together with analysis by LC-MS/MS, has guaranteed average
   recoveries between 79.4 and 89.0\%, limits of detection (LOD) and
   quantification (LOQ) of 0.10 and 0.25 mu g/kg, respectively. OTA was
   detected in 25.0\% of the analysed casings (24 samples) at concentration
   ranging from 0.25 to 98.52 mu g/kg. Ten of these samples were from the
   same production plant in which an additional sampling was carried out,
   and where a problem of environmental contamination by ochratoxigenic
   moulds probably exists. The edible parts were mostly uncontaminated,
   except in 3 samples, 2 of which showed OTA contamination levels above 1
   mu g/kg. The presence of OTA on the casing does not seem to be cause for
   alarm about the safety of this type of product but it should in any case
   be monitored. Before slicing the meat for consumption, it is always good
   practice to peel the casing even if reported as edible on salami label.},

   Copper Doped Tricalcium Phosphate Particles},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Cranioplasty represents the surgical repair of bone defects or
   deformities in the cranium arising from traumatic skull bone fracture,
   cranial bone deformities, bone cancer, and infections. The actual gold
   standard in surgery procedures for cranioplasty involves the use of
   biocompatible materials, and repair or regeneration of large cranial
   defects is particularly challenging from both a functional and aesthetic
   point of view. PMMA-based bone cement are the most widely biomaterials
   adopted in the field, with at least four different surgical approaches.
   Modifications for improving biological and mechanical functions of
   PMMA-based bone cement have been suggested. To this aim, the inclusion
   of antibiotics to prevent infection has been shown to provide a
   reduction of mechanical properties in bending. Therefore, the
   development of novel antibacterial active agents to overcome issues
   related to mechanical properties and bacterial resistance to antibiotics
   is still encouraged. In this context, mechanical, biological, and
   antibacterial feature against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus bacterial
   strains of surgical PMMA cement modified with BG and recently developed
   Cu-TCP bioactive particles have been highlighted.},

Title = {Gongylonema infection of wild mammals in Japan and Sardinia (Italy)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HELMINTHOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {94},
Abstract = {The gullet worms, classical Gongylonema pulchrum and newly
   differentiated Gongylonema nepalensis, are prevalent in various mammals
   in Japan and Sardinia, Italy, respectively. The former species is
   cosmopolitan in distribution, dwelling in the mucosa of the upper
   digestive tract of a variety of domestic and wild mammals, and also
   humans. At present, the geographical distribution of G. nepalensis is
   known in Nepal and Sardinia, with the nematode having been recorded from
   the oesophagus of water buffaloes (Nepal), cattle, sheep, goats and wild
   mouflon (Sardinia). To clarify their natural transmission cycles among
   domestic and wild mammals, the present study analysed the ribosomal RNA
   gene (rDNA) and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (cox1)
   of worms of various origins: G. pulchrum worms from sika deer, wild
   boars, Japanese macaques, and feral alien Reeves's muntjacs in Japan,
   and G. nepalensis worms from a red fox and a wild boar in Sardinia.
   Although the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of rDNA and
   partial cox1 nucleotide sequences of G. pulchrum from native wild
   mammals in Japan were distinct from those of the worms in cattle, the
   worms from feral alien Reeves's muntjacs showed the cattle-type ITS
   genotype and cox1 cattle-I and II haplotypes. The rDNA and cox1
   nucleotide sequences of G. nepalensis from a red fox in Sardinia were
   almost identical to those of the worms from domestic and wild ruminants
   on the island. The ecological interaction between domestic and wild
   mammals and their susceptibility to different Gongylonema spp. must be
   considered when trying to elucidate this spirurid's transmission
   dynamics in nature.},

Abstract = {Adequate testing and adulterant detection of food products are required
   to assure its safety and avoid fraudulent activities.
   Adulteration/substitution of costlier meat with a cheaper or inferior
   meat is one of the most common fraudulence in meat industry. Aim of this
   study was to check the correct labelling of meat and ready to cook
   bovine meat products, combining the DNA microarray approach to identify
   the animal species with the histological examination, to check the
   composition and safety of meat. One hundred and one samples of bovine
   minced meat (Group 1) and ready to cook meat products (Group 2) were
   collected from supermarkets in Turin, Italy. DNA microarray revealed
   that 25.7\% of samples were positive for species not declared on the
   label, swine being the most common. Histology showed the presence of
   cartilage, bone and glandular tissue. A higher presence of bacteria and
   inflammatory cells was detected in Group 1. Bacterial cells associated
   to inflammatory cells were detected with a higher score in Group 2.
   Sarcocystis spp. were present in 83.3\% samples of Group 1 and 49.1\% of
   Group 2. This study confirmed that the mislabelling of meat products is
   not uncommon. The combination of DNA microarrays and histology can
   increase the monitoring capacity in bovine meat industry.},

Abstract = {Huntington' disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative
   disease characterized by progressive motor, psychiatric, and cognitive
   deterioration. HD is, together with spinocerebellar ataxias, spinobulbar
   muscular atrophy and dentatorubral-pallido- luysian atrophy, one of the
   nine disorders caused by an expansion of glutamine residues in the
   causative protein where the polyglutamine expansion cause aberrant
   protein folding. Since an excessive metal's accumulation in organs may
   induce protein misfolding and oxidative stress, we have studied the
   blood concentration of essential (Cr, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Se, Zn)
   and nonessential (As, Cd, Sb, Sn, V) trace elements in HD patients.
   We found increased levels of the essential elements iron, chromium,
   selenium and zinc and of the nonessential element arsenic in the blood
   of HD patients.
   Since alteration in metals homeostasis may contribute to the
   pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease and could eventually
   constitute a target for therapy, we may suggest the utilize of the blood
   metal profile as a further in vivo tool to study and characterize
   Huntington disease.},

Abstract = {In this study the effect of the application of High Pressure Treatment
   (HPP) combined with four different manufacturing processes on the
   inactivation of Listeria innocua, used as a surrogate for L.
   monocytogenes, in artificially contaminated coppa samples was evaluated
   in order to verify the most suitable strategy to meet the Listeria
   inactivation requirements needed for the exportation of dry-cured meat
   in the U.S. Fresh anatomical cuts intended for coppa production were
   supplied by four different delicatessen factories located in Northern
   Italy. Raw meat underwent experimental contamination with Listeria
   innocua using a mixture of 5 strains. Surface contamination of the fresh
   anatomical cuts was carried out by immersion into inoculum containing
   Listeria spp. The conditions of the HPP treatment were: pressure 593
   MPa, time 290 seconds, water treatment temperature 14 degrees C.
   Listeria innocua was enumerated on surface and deep samples post
   contamination, resting, ripening and HPP treatment. The results of this
   study show how the reduction of the microbial load on coppa during the
   production process did not vary among three companies (P>0.05) ranging
   from 3.73 to 4.30 log CFU/g, while it was significantly different
   (P<0.01) for the fourth company (0.92 log CFU/g). HPP treatment resulted
   in a significant (P<0.01) deep decrease of L. innocua count with values
   ranging between 1.63-3.54 log CFU/g with no significant differences
   between companies. Regarding superficial contamination, HPP treatment
   resulted significant (P<0.01) only in Coppa produced by two companies.
   The results highlight that there were processes less effective to
   inhibit the pathogen; in particular for company D an increase of L.
   innocua count was shown during processing and HPP alone cannot be able
   to in reaching the Listeria inactivation requirements needed for
   exportation of dry-cured meat in the U.S. According to the data reported
   in this paper, HPP treatment increases the ability of the manufacturing
   process of coppa in reducing Listeria count with the objective of a
   lethality treatment.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to investigate the combined effect of the
   manufacturing process followed by HPP treatment on the inactivation of
   Salmonella spp. in artificially contaminated coppa samples, in order to
   verify the ability of the combined processes to achieve the objective of
   a 5-log reduction of Salmonella spp. needed for exportation to the U.S.
   Fresh anatomical cuts intended for coppa production were supplied by
   four different delicatessen factories located in Northern Italy. Raw
   meat underwent experimental contamination with Salmonella spp. using a
   mixture of 3 strains. Surface contamination of the fresh anatomical cuts
   was carried out by immersion into inoculum containing Salmonella spp.
   The conditions of the HPP treatment were: pressure 593 MPa, time 290
   seconds, water treatment temperature 14 degrees C. Surface and deep
   samples were performed post contamination (T0), end of the cold phase
   (T1), end of process (Tend), and after HPP treatment (postHPP) and
   Salmonella spp. Enumerated. The results of this study show a significant
   reduction of Salmonella spp. all through the production process (P<0.01)
   for all companies, followed by an additional reduction of bacterial
   counts due to HPP treatment (P<0.01), both in superficial and deep
   contaminations (P<0.01). The superficial overall reduction resulted of
   1.58 to 5.04 log CFU/g during the production process. HPP treatment
   resulted in a significant (P<0.01) superficial and deep decrease in
   Salmonella spp. enumeration varying from 0.61 to 4.01 log and from 1.49
   to 4.13 log. According to the data presented in this study, only the
   combined approach of coppa manufacturing process followed by HPP
   treatment always led to a 5-log reduction of Salmonella spp. required by
   USDA/FSIS guidelines.},

Journal = {MUSEOLOGIA SCIENTIFICA},

Volume = {14},
Pages = {67-80},
Abstract = {Natural History Museums are places of scientific dissemination and
   informal education, and have a fundamental role in scientific research
   and in preserving the historical heritage of a territory and its
   biodiversity. The island of Sicily, thanks to its geographic position as
   an inter-continental bridge in the Mediterranean, presents a notable
   ornithological diversity, with both sedentary species and species that
   migrate between Africa and Europe. For this reason, and thanks to a
   strong hunting tradition, Sicilian collections also depict the avifaunal
   assemblage historically present in the region, particularly for birds of
   prey, the group we focus on because of its particular ecological
   characteristics and cultural interests. However, the partnership among
   museum institutions, generally and in Italy, is complex and fragmented,
   and thus a census of Sicilian raptors collections had not been attempted
   yet. This study presents data from 16 public museum institutions,
   reporting the presence in their collections more than 1800 specimens
   belonging to 64 species. This census presents a detailed estimate of the
   Sicilian museum patrimony regarding this charismatic group, which may
   constitute a starting point for future studies and contribute to the
   visibility, promotion and interconnection of the institutions involved.},

Abstract = {High-fat diet (HFD) induces inflammation and microbial dysbiosis, which
   are components of the metabolic syndrome. Nutritional strategies can be
   a valid tool to prevent metabolic and inflammatory diseases. The aim of
   the present study was to evaluate if the chronic intake of pistachio
   prevents obesity-associated inflammation and dysbiosis in HFD-fed mice.
   Three groups of male mice (four weeks old; n = 8 per group) were fed for
   16 weeks with a standard diet (STD), HFD, or HFD supplemented with
   pistachios (HFD-P; 180 g/kg of HFD). Serum, hepatic and adipose tissue
   inflammation markers were analyzed in HFD-P animals and compared to HFD
   and STD groups. Measures of inflammation, obesity, and intestinal
   integrity were assessed. Fecal samples were collected for gut microbiota
   analysis. Serum TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta levels were significantly
   reduced in HFD-P compared to HFD. Number and area of adipocytes,
   crown-like structure density, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, F4-80, and CCL-2
   mRNA expression levels were significantly reduced in HFD-P subcutaneous
   and visceral adipose tissues, compared to HFD. A significant reduction
   in the number of inflammatory foci and IL-1 beta and CCL-2 gene
   expression was observed in the liver of HFD-P mice compared with HFD.
   Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was reduced in HFD-P mice in comparison
   to the HFD group. A pistachio diet significantly increased abundance of
   healthy bacteria genera such as Parabacteroides, Dorea, Allobaculum,
   Turicibacter, Lactobacillus, and Anaeroplasma, and greatly reduced
   bacteria associated with inflammation, such as Oscillospira,
   Desulfovibrio, Coprobacillus, and Bilophila. The intestinal conductance
   was lower in HFD-P mice than in the HFD mice, suggesting an improvement
   in the gut barrier function. The results of the present study showed
   that regular pistachio consumption improved inflammation in obese mice.
   The positive effects could be related to positive modulation of the
   microbiota composition.},

Abstract = {From January 2015 to March 2016, an outbreak of 23 human cases of
   listeriosis in the Marche region and one human case in the Umbria region
   of Italy was caused by Listeria monocytogenes strains showing a new
   pulsotype never described before in Italy. A total of 37 clinical
   strains isolated from patients exhibiting listeriosis symptoms and 1374
   strains correlated to the outbreak were received by the Italian National
   Reference Laboratory for L. monocytogenes (It NRL Lm) of Istituto
   Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise (IZSAM) for
   outbreak investigation. A real-time PCR assay was purposely designed for
   a rapid screening of the strains related to the outbreak. PCR-positive
   strains were successively typed through molecular serogrouping, pulsed
   field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS).
   Applying the described strategy, based on real-time PCR screening, we
   were able to considerably reduce time and costs during the outbreak
   investigation activities.},

Abstract = {To extend the shelf life of buffalo Ricotta cheese, a process was
   assessed that included a second heat treatment followed by
   homogenisation and hot packaging. The microbiological and chemical
   characteristics as well as the oxidation degree of the product were
   determined over storage for 21 days using total antioxidant activity,
   redox potential, malondialdehyde content, and protein-bound carbonyl
   content. Homogenised buffalo Ricotta cheese has a longer shelf life than
   traditional Ricotta cheese, although the process could be optimised to
   reduce the total bacterial load during storage. No significant oxidative
   damage occurred during storage. This innovative process could promote
   the market expansion of Ricotta cheese.},

Pages = {103-107},
Abstract = {Dogs are the major reservoir of Leishmania infantum, the causative agent
   of canine visceral and cutaneous human leishmaniasis in the
   Mediterranean basin. Canine and human leishmaniosis are endemic in
   Italy, particularly in central and southern regions, including islands.
   Here we show a preliminary, clinical, serological and molecular study
   carried out in Pantelleria island during 2017. In this study, we
   clinically examined 136 dogs for the presence of symptoms compatible
   with leishmaniasis, determined the titer of anti-Leishmania antibodies,
   and investigated Leishmania DNA by real time PCR in blood and/or lymph
   node of each dog. The prevalence of disease was equal to 27\% with 95\%
   CI {[}21\%; 32\%], lower than prevalence obtained in the other Sicily
   islands (Lampedusa, Lipari). We observed that enlarged lymph nodes was
   more positivitely associated with canine leishmaniasis (CanL) than other
   clinical signs. The results obtained showed that in an endemic area,
   such as Sicily, diagnosis of CanL needs to be carried out by including
   an immunological, molecular clinical approach.},

Abstract = {Swine vesicular disease (SVD) is a contagious viral disease of pigs. The
   clinical signs of SVD are indistinguishable from other vesicular
   diseases, such as senecavirus A infection (SVA) and foot-and-mouth
   disease (FMD). Rapid and accurate diagnostic tests of SVD are considered
   essential in countries free of vesicular diseases. Competitive ELISA
   (cELISA) is the serological test used routinely. However, although
   cELISA is the standard test for SVD antibody testing, this test produces
   a small number of false-positive results, which caused problems in
   international trade. The current project developed a SVD isotype
   antibody ELISA using recombinant SVD virus-like particles (VLP) and an
   SVD-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) to reduce the percentage of false
   positives. The diagnostic specificities of SVD-VLP isotype ELISAs were
   98.7\% and 99.6\% for IgM and IgG. The SVD isotype ELISAs were
   SVD-specific, without cross-reactivity to other vesicular diseases. A
   panel of 16 SVD-positive reference sera was evaluated using the SVD-VLP
   isotype ELISAs. All sera were correctly identified as positive by the
   two combined SVD-VLP isotype ELISAs. Comparison of the test results
   showed a high level of correlation between the SVDV antigen isotype
   ELISAs and SVD-VLP isotype ELISAs. 303 sera from animals lacking
   clinical signs and history of SVDV exposure were identified positive
   using SVD cELISA. These samples were examined using SVD-VLP isotype
   ELISAs. Of the 303 serum samples, five were positive for IgM, and five
   of 303 were positive for IgG. Comparable to virus neutralization test
   results, SVD isotype ELISAs significantly reduced the false-positive
   samples. Based on above test results, the combined use of cELISA and
   isotype ELISAs can reduce the number of false-positive samples and the
   use of time-consuming virus neutralization tests, with benefit for
   international trade in swine and related products.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL DAIRY JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {The influence of alpha(S1)-casein (alpha(S1)-CN) and kappa-casein
   (kappa-CN) polymorphism on the curd yield and 12 other parameters of
   milk obtained from 89 Italian Mediterranean buffaloes (IMB) was
   evaluated. IMB milk carrying alpha(S1)-CNB and kappa-CNX1 variants
   resulted in a greater curd yield. For these variants, the greater
   efficiency was attributable to higher content of proteins but not to
   milk production. In addition, the greater efficiency in curd yield of
   IMB milk carrying kappa-CNX1 (P < 0.05) or alpha(S1)-CNB (P < 0.05) was
   characterised by a higher real curd yield/estimated curd yield (RCY/ECY)
   ratio. The IMB milk that exhibited the lowest value of RCY contained the
   kappa-CNX1X2 and alpha(S1)-CNAB heterozygotes and kappa-CNX2 and
   alpha(S1)-CNA homozygotes. IMB milk carrying kappa-CNX1 and
   alpha(S1)-CNB, which presented the highest RCY, can be translated into
   an economic advantage if milk remuneration was done on the actual yield.

Title = {Bottlenecks in diagnostics of Mediterranean fish diseases},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE EUROPEAN ASSOCIATION OF FISH PATHOLOGISTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {40},
Number = {2},
Pages = {70-80},
Abstract = {Three independent Horizon 2020 projects are prioritising a common task
   of solving diagnostic issues using different approaches and strategies.
   PerformFlSH focuses its research objectives on diagnostic methods,
   MedAID has prepared a diagnostic manual for the most devastating fish
   diseases of the Mediterranean and ParaFishControl has prepared a
   diagnostic manual on parasitic diseases of European aquaculture species.
   Currently, the projects are investing large collaborative efforts to
   reinforce their tasks and to deliver mutual and cutting-edge material on
   the subject. Nevertheless, further efforts for the harmonisation,
   standardisation and validation of diagnostic methods for infectious
   diseases in Mediterranean aquaculture are needed, involving as many
   relevant stakeholders and experts as possible. The main goal of the
   workshop (WS) ``Bottlenecks in diagnostics of Mediterranean fish
   diseases{''}, organised during the 19th International EAFP conference on
   Diseases of Fish and Shellfish, was to present results already obtained
   from the projects and discuss the bottlenecks in diagnostic procedures
   of target groups of pathogens. The WS provided an ideal environment and
   opportunity to exchange and discuss experiences and data with
   international experts in the diagnostic field attending the conference.
   Interactive discussions on diagnostics for a specific group of pathogens
   have resulted in highlighting new initiatives needed in the management
   of diseases in Mediterranean aquaculture. Furthermore, the WS emphasised
   a need for the establishment of this strong interactive network which
   will collaborate to receive, collect, compile and analyse all
   information gathered from different parts of the region.},

Title = {Neurofilaments in blood is a new promising preclinical biomarker for the
   screening of natural scrapie in sheep},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 19},
Abstract = {Scrapie is a fatal neurodegenerative disease of sheep and goats
   belonging to the group of Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy or
   prion diseases. The EU has adopted mandatory measures for scrapie
   surveillance to safeguard public and animal health because it is highly
   contagious and might decimate all genetic susceptible animals in
   affected flocks. Definite diagnosis of scrapie relies on the detection
   of the pathological prion protein in brain tissues and there are still
   no blood biomarkers available for making diagnosis in living animals
   that can be used for the screening of sheep in scrapie-affected flocks.
   Neurofilament light (NfL) protein, a valid biomarker for neuronal and
   axonal damages, can now be easily measured in blood by the
   ultra-sensitive single molecule array (Simoa) technology. Recent work
   reported that serum NfL is increased in neurodegenerative diseases,
   including human prion diseases, but no data are available for scrapie or
   other animal prion diseases. Here, we found that the median serum NfL
   concentration in scrapie animals (56.2, IQR 42.2-84.8, n = 9) was more
   than 15 times higher (p = 0.00084) than that found in control samples
   (3.4, IQR 3.0-26.3, n = 11). Moreover, serum NfL concentration in
   scrapie sheep with clinical signs (n = 2; 75.3, 15.7 pg/ml) did not
   significantly (p = 0.541; t-test) differ from scrapie animals without
   clinical signs (n = 7; 61.0, 10.7 pg/ml). The receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) curve analysis estimated the cut-off value of 31
   pg/ml serum NfL for distinguishing scrapie-infected sheep from controls.
   The application of this cut-off value gives an accuracy of the test of
   95\% (percent error of 5.23\%). These data indicate that the Simoa test
   for serum NfL might be a useful screening method for detecting
   preclinical scrapie in living sheep. Finally, the preliminary data
   reported here need confirmation in large and more structured studies.},

   Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia and Spastic Ataxia},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Month = {DEC 10},
Abstract = {Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) and hereditary ataxia (HA) are two
   groups of disorders characterized, respectively, by progressive
   dysfunction or degeneration of the pyramidal tracts (HSP) and of the
   Purkinje cells and spinocerebellar tracts (HA). Although HSP and HA are
   generally shown to have distinct clinical-genetic profiles, in several
   cases the clinical presentation, the causative genes, and the cellular
   pathways and mechanisms involved overlap between the two forms. Genetic
   analyses in humans in combination with in vitro and in vivo studies
   using model systems have greatly expanded our knowledge of
   spinocerebellar degenerative disorders. In this review, we focus on the
   zebrafish (Danio rerio), a vertebrate model widely used in biomedical
   research since its overall nervous system organization is similar to
   that of humans. A critical analysis of the literature suggests that
   zebrafish could serve as a powerful experimental tool for molecular and
   genetic dissection of both HA and HSP. The zebrafish, found to be very
   useful for demonstrating the causal relationship between defect and
   mutation, also offers a useful platform to exploit for the development
   of therapies.},

Title = {Thermotolerant Campylobacter spp. in chicken and bovine meat in Italy:
   Prevalence, level of contamination and molecular characterization of
   isolates},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 6},
Abstract = {Campylobacter species are common foodborne pathogens associated with
   cases of human gastroenteritis worldwide. A detailed understanding of
   the prevalence, contamination levels and molecular characteristics of
   Campylobacter spp. in cattle and chicken, which are likely the most
   important sources of human contamination, is imperative. A collection of
   1243 poultry meat samples (665 chicken breasts and 578 chicken thighs)
   and 1203 bovine meat samples (689 hamburgers and 514 knife-cut meat
   preparations) were collected at retail outlets, in randomly selected
   supermarkets located in different Italian regions during one year. Of
   these samples, 17.38\% of the poultry meat and 0.58\% of the bovine meat
   samples tested positive for Campylobacter, of which 131 were
   Campylobacter jejuni (57.96\%) and 95 were Campylobacter coli (42.03\%).
   Campylobacter isolates were genotyped with the aim of assessing the
   genetic diversity, population structure, source distribution and
   Campylobacter transmission route to humans. All isolates were
   molecularly characterized by pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and
   further genotyped using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and fla-SVR
   sequencing to gain better insight into the population structure.
   Antibiotic resistance was also investigate. The highest levels of
   resistance among chicken strains were observed for ciprofloxacin
   (88.25\%), nalidixic acid (81.45\%) and tetracycline (75.6\%). PFGE
   analysis revealed 73 pulsotypes for C. jejuni and 54 pulsotypes for C.
   coli, demonstrating the existance of different and specific clones
   circulating in Italy. MLST of C.jejuni isolates mainly clustered in the
   CC353, CC354, CC21, CC206 and CC443; while C.coli isolates clustered
   only in CC828. The most common flaA alleles were 287 for C. jejuni and
   66 for C. coli. Our study confirms that poultry meat is the main source
   of Campylobacteriosis, whereas red meat had a low level of contamination
   suggesting a minor role in transmission. The high presence of
   Campylobacter in retail chicken meat, paired with its increased
   resistance to antimicrobials with several multidrug resistance profiles
   detected, is alarming and represents a persistent threat to public
   health.},

   dramatically over the past two decades. Since 1999, there have been
   regular reports of WNV outbreaks and the virus has expanded its area of
   circulation in many Southern European countries. After emerging in Italy
   in 1996, USUV has spread to other countries causing mortality in several
   bird species. In 2009, USUV seroconversion in horses was reported in
   Italy. Co-circulation of both viruses was detected in humans, horses and
   birds. The main vector of WNV and USUV in Europe is Culex pipiens,
   however, both viruses were found in native Culex mosquito species (Cx.
   modestus, Cx. perexiguus). Experimental competence to transmit the WNV
   was also proven for native and invasive mosquitoes of Aedes and Culex
   genera (Ae. albopictus, Ae. detritus, Cx. torrentium). Recently, Ae.
   albopictus and Ae. japonicus naturally-infected with USUV were reported.
   While neuroinvasive human WNV infections are well-documented, USUV
   infections are sporadically detected. However, there is increasing
   evidence of a role of USUV in human disease. Seroepidemiological studies
   showed that USUV circulation is more common than WNV in some endemic
   regions. Recent data showed that WNV strains detected in humans, horses,
   birds, and mosquitoes mainly belong to lineage 2. In addition to
   European USUV lineages, some reports indicate the presence of African
   USUV lineages as well. The trends in WNV/USUV range and vector expansion
   are likely to continue in future years. This mini-review provides an
   update on the epidemiology of WNV and USUV infections in Southern Europe
   within a multidisciplinary ``One Health{''} context.},

Abstract = {The Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell line is widely used as
   epithelial cell model in studies ranging from viral infection to
   environmental pollutants, and vaccines production. However, little is
   known about basal expression of genes involved in innate immunity, and
   the ability to respond to infectious and non-infectious stressors.
   Therefore, the aims of our study were to evaluate the basal level of
   expression of pivotal genes in the innate immune response and cell cycle
   regulation, as well as to evaluate the ability of this cell line to
   respond to infectious or non-infectious stressors. As surmised in our
   working hypothesis, we demonstrated the constitutive expression of genes
   involved in the innate immune response and cell defense alike, including
   TLRs, Interleukins, Myd88, p65/NF-kB and p53. Moreover, we described the
   ability of this cell line to respond to LPS and cadmium (Cd2+) in terms
   of gene expression and cytokine release. These data confirm the
   possibility of using this cell line as a model in studies of
   host/pathogen interaction and response to non-infectious stressors.},

Abstract = {An analytical method for the simultaneous determination of
   polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and hexabromocyclododecanes
   (HBCDs) in fish, shellfish and muscle of terrestrial animals was
   developed as an extension of a previously validated method for PBDE
   analysis. A single sample preparation based on QuEChERS-like extraction
   and a two-step clean-up, followed by a dual instrumental detection, was
   implemented. GC-MS/MS was used for PBDEs and LC-MS/MS for HBCDs. The
   method allows the quantification of fifteen PBDEs (28, 47, 49, 66, 77,
   85, 99, 100, 138, 153, 154, 183, 197, 206, 209) and three HBCD isomers
   (alpha, beta and gamma), reaching 10 pg/g LOQs for all the analytes
   except BDE 206 and 209 (100 pg/g LOQ). The validated method was applied
   to the analysis of 12 fish and shellfish species (sole, spiny dogfish,
   smooth-hound, mackerel, swordfish, grey mullet, cod, anchovy, red
   mullet, Atlantic horse mackerel, tuna fish and mussel) collected in
   central Italian markets accounting for a total of 44 samples. Generally,
   sigma PBDEs showed higher concentration than sigma HBCDs except in the
   case of mussels in which sigma HBCDs > sigma PBDEs. Cod and smooth-hound
   are the least contaminated species among those analysed in the present
   study, whereas the highest brominated flame retardant (BFR) levels were
   found in spiny dogfish samples. The measured contamination levels were
   generally comparable to or lower than those already published in
   European studies. Literature data for HBCDs in European fish and
   shellfish were hard to find; therefore, PBDE and HBCD levels were also
   compared with European Environmental Quality Standard (EQS) in biota
   (Directive 2013/39/EU). EQSs for HBCDs are six orders of magnitude
   higher than those for PBDEs; therefore, while no exceedance was observed
   for the first, almost all the samples analysed for PBDEs were above
   EQSs. The presented preliminary data on PBDEs and HBCDs are among the
   first published in marine fish and shellfish commercialised in Central
   Italy.},

   Abstract The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of dietary
   licorice root supplementation on chemical and nutritional
   characteristics of cow milk and Stracciata cheese. Licorice did not
   influence milk and Stracciata fat content but induced modifications in
   fatty acid profile. Both in milk and Stracciata, a decrease in saturated
   fatty acids was detected and in cheeses an increase of monounsaturated
   and polyunsaturated fatty acids was observed. Stracciata obtained from
   the experimental group showed an improved oxidative stability after six
   days of ripening, a finding partly justifiable by the well-known
   richness of antioxidant compounds in the licorice root. The volatile
   profile of Stracciata was also affected by dietary licorice intake, with
   an increase in esters and a reduction of aldehydes and ketones. These
   results suggest a positive role of licorice in modifying chemical and
   physical properties of cow cheeses, reducing lipid oxidation and
   inducing changes in color and flavor with a presumable improvement in
   consumer acceptability.},

Title = {In ovo Injection of a Galacto-Oligosaccharide Prebiotic in Broiler
   Chickens Submitted to Heat-Stress: Impact on Transcriptomic Profile and
   Plasma Immune Parameters},
Journal = {ANIMALS},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Galactooligosaccharides (GOS) delivered in ovo stimulate
   development of indigenous microflora in the chicken embryo. Such
   stimulation may create a eubiotic environment in the guts which
   positively influences intestinal function and health. This study aimed
   to evaluate the impact of GOS delivered in ovo on the modulation of the
   transcriptomic responses in the intestinal tissues of broiler chickens
   challenged (or not challenged) with heat in the last growing phase. GOS
   stimulated several groups of genes in jejunum and in cecum independently
   of the heat stress provision. A general favourable effect of GOS was
   recognized due to the enrichment of energetic metabolism-related gene
   sets, mainly in jejunum. The enrichment of lipid metabolism-related gene
   sets in the GOS group might have contributed to gut function and barrier
   maintenance, which might also be linked to a reduced immune system
   activation, mainly at cecum level. The heat stress impaired gut
   functions in terms of energy and immunity, in agreement with previous
   studies. Under heat stress condition, the in ovo injection of GOS did
   not provide additional benefits to the intestinal transcriptomic
   response.
   Abstract This study investigated the effects of a galactooligosaccharide
   (GOS) prebiotic in ovo injected on intestinal transcriptome and plasma
   immune parameters of broiler chickens kept under thermoneutral (TN) or
   heat stress (HS) conditions. Fertilized Ross 308 eggs were injected in
   ovo with 0.2 mL physiological saline without (control, CON) or with 3.5
   mg of GOS (GOS). Three-hundred male chicks/injection treatment (25
   birds/pen) were kept in TN or HS (30 degrees C) conditions during the
   last growing phase, in a 2 x 2 factorial design. At slaughter, from 20
   birds/injection group (half from TN and half from HS), jejunum and cecum
   were collected for transcriptome analysis, and plasma was collected. No
   differences in plasma parameters (IgA and IgG, serum amyloid) and no
   interaction between injection treatment and environment condition were
   found. GOS-enriched gene sets related to energetic metabolism in
   jejunum, and to lipid metabolism in cecum, were involved in gut barrier
   maintenance. A homogeneous reaction to heat stress was determined along
   the gut, which showed downregulation of the genes related to energy and
   immunity, irrespective of in ovo treatment. GOS efficacy in
   counteracting heat stress was scarce after ten days of environmental
   treatment, but the in ovo supplementation modulates group of genes in
   jejunum and cecum of broiler chickens.},

Abstract = {Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by Leishmania (L.) infantum is a
   public health threat in the Emilia-Romagna region, northeastern Italy,
   but its epidemiology has not been fully elucidated in this area. The
   objective of this study was to characterize Leishmania infection in sand
   flies collected in a re-emerging focus of VL in the Bologna province.
   During the summer of 2016, 6114 sand flies were collected, identified,
   and tested for Leishmania detection. Of the identified sand flies,
   96.5\% were Phlebotomus (P.) perfiliewi and 3.5\% were P. perniciosus.
   Detected parasites were characterized by biomolecular methods
   (multilocus microsatellite typing and characterization of repetitive
   region on chromosome 31), and quantified by real-time PCR. The
   prevalence of Leishmania infection in individually-tested P. perfiliewi
   sand flies varied from 6\% to 10\% with an increasing trend during the
   season. Promastigotes of L. infantum were isolated by dissection in one
   P. perfiliewi female; the isolated strain (Lein-pw) were closely related
   to Leishmania parasites from VL cases in northeastern Italy, but
   differed from strains isolated in dogs from the same area. Our findings
   strongly support the vector status of P. perfiliewi for human VL in the
   study area.},

Title = {Behavioral and physiological responses to stocking density in sea bream
   (Sparus aurata): Do coping styles matter?},
Journal = {PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {212},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Stocking density is considered a stress factor for fish and is therefore
   one of the numerous concerns about fish welfare in an aquaculture
   context. Stress coping styles (SCS) are defined as a coherent set of
   individual physiological and behavioral differences in stress responses
   that are consistent across time and context and appear to be promising
   for improving fish welfare in aquaculture. The aim of the present study
   was to describe the physiological and zootechnical performances of
   gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) at different stocking densities (low
   density, LD: 15 kg/m(3) and high density, HD: 30 kg/m(3)), depending on
   individual SCS. To do so, the fish SCS were first screened by measuring
   boldness (prior to the experiment). Three consecutive samplings were
   performed over the experiment to measure several blood parameters,
   including hematocrit (Hct), red blood cell count (RBCC), hemoglobin
   (Hb), cortisol, adrenalin, noradrenalin, glucose, lactate, and lysozyme,
   to infer the consequence of the SCS profile on the welfare condition in
   response to stocking density. Finally, swimming activity was recorded in
   a subsample of individuals (9 BOLD and 9 SHY individuals per density),
   and BOLD individuals displayed higher swimming activity than SHY ones at
   HD, while the opposite pattern was observed at LD. According to
   principal component analysis, physiological parameters are linked to the
   SCS profile, mostly at the beginning of the experiment, while density
   effects on physiology remain during the entire experiment duration. In
   conclusion, regarding all the variables observed, fish SCS appeared to
   be promising criteria to select the most adaptive individuals relating
   to rearing conditions and therefore improve welfare.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Influenza D virus (IDV) has been increasingly reported all over the
   world. Cattle are considered the major viral reservoir. Based on the
   hemagglutinin-esterase (HEF) gene, three main genetic and antigenic
   clusters have been identified: D/OK distributed worldwide, D/660
   detected only in the USA and D/Japan in Japan. Up to 2017, all the
   Italian IDV isolates belonged to the D/OK genetic cluster. From January
   2018 to May 2019, we performed virological surveillance for IDV from
   respiratory outbreaks in 725 bovine farms in Northern Italy by RT-PCR.
   Seventy-four farms were positive for IDV. A full or partial genome
   sequence was obtained from 29 samples. Unexpectedly, a phylogenetic
   analysis of the HEF gene showed the presence of 12 strains belonging to
   the D/660 cluster, previously unreported in Europe. The earliest D/660
   strain was collected in March 2018 from cattle imported from France.
   Moreover, we detected one viral strain with a reassortant genetic
   pattern (PB2, PB1, P42, HEF and NP segments in the D/660 cluster, whilst
   P3 and NS segments in the D/OK cluster). These results confirm the
   circulation of IDV in the Italian cattle population and highlight the
   need to monitor the development of the spreading of this influenza virus
   in order to get more information about the epidemiology and the ecology
   of IDV viruses.},

Title = {Botulism in Wild Birds and Changes in Environmental Habitat: A
   Relationship to be Considered},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Simple summary Human activities, even those aimed at improving a natural
   area, can interfere with wildlife and their environment, potentially
   leading to some changes. In this paper, a botulism outbreak which
   occurred in waterfowls in a nature reserve after a conservative action
   is reported. In particular, an artificial pond was created in order to
   improve the environment of waterfowls, but gray mullets (Mugil cephalus)
   settled in the pond and proliferated. Fish mortality was observed during
   summer, leading to an accumulation of decaying organic material, thus
   creating the optimal conditions for Clostridium botulin growth and toxin
   production. In the same period, the botulism outbreak with flaccid
   paralysis and sudden mortality rapidly occurred in waterfowls. The toxin
   mosaic type C/D was identified as responsible for the disease outbreak.
   The outbreak rapidly resolved after the removal of the fish carcasses,
   highlighting the importance of a correct management for any action in
   natural contexts. In conclusion, before considering any activity in
   wildlife habitats, it is important to assess first its possible impact
   on wildlife.
   Abstract Any human activity, even if aimed at the improvement of a
   natural area, can potentially affect wildlife, leading to possible
   short-term or long-term changes due to the human-wildlife interaction.
   In this study, a botulism outbreak which occurred in waterfowl in a
   nature reserve after a conservative environmental action is reported.
   More than 180 different species of wild birds, including seventy
   waterfowl species, live in the area. The wildlife reserve rangers built
   an artificial pond equipped with draining canals in the wetland in order
   to improve the environment of waterfowl species and to facilitate their
   supply of food. Then, presumably due to tidal rides, gray mullets (Mugil
   cephalus) arrived from the sea and settled in the pond. The number of
   fishes gradually increased, and several fishes died with a peak of
   mortality in the summer of 2017, creating a great amount of decaying
   organic material and the optimal conditions for Clostridium botulinum
   growth and toxin production. A botulism outbreak then occurred rapidly
   and was characterised by flaccid paralysis and sudden mortality of the
   birds. Seven mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), 4 common teals (Anas
   crecca), 1 garganey (Anas querquedula), 2 wood sandpipers (Tringa
   glareola), 1 little egret (Egretta garzetta), 1 little grebe
   (Tachybaptus ruficollis), and 4 Eurasian coots (Fulica atra) were found
   dead. Interestingly, the toxin identified as responsible for the disease
   outbreak was the mosaic of type C and D toxins (C/D type). The prompt
   removal of the fish carcasses led to a rapid resolution of the outbreak
   of the disease, highlighting the relevance of a correct management for
   any action in environmental contexts. The conclusion is that any human
   activity in wildlife habitats should be carefully considered in order to
   assess the possible impacts and to quickly identify the possible risks
   of changes in wildlife population.},

Abstract = {Introduction: To support African veterinary laboratory services, the
   Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise puts in
   place an operational system called ``SILAB for Africa{''} (SILABFA);
   this is a web application used by a laboratory information management
   system to support laboratory diagnostic activities and to meet the needs
   of various African countries. SILABFA was designed to collect and manage
   all necessary information on samples, tests, and test results.
   Methods: The system involves the entry of sample data on arrival, the
   tracking of samples through the various sections of the laboratory, and
   the collection of test results. It automates the generation of test
   reports and monitors outbreaks through data interrogation functions and
   eliminates multiple registrations of the same data on paper records.
   SILABFA is currently installed in Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe,
   Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Cameroon, and installation in
   Senegal and Ivory Coast is planned for the next few months. After some
   years of SILABFA usage, it was natural to want to utilize more and more
   data collected in a homogeneous and consistent way for epidemiological
   purposes and to cover informative debts toward ministries and other
   organizations.
   Conclusion: To improve the availability of good, detailed, and reliable
   data, as the epidemiological information, SILABFA has been linked to the
   local animal identification, registration, and traceability system and
   other relevant national information systems.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Microorganisms represent most of the biodiversity of living organisms in
   every ecological habitat. They have profound effects on the functioning
   of any ecosystem, and therefore on the health of our planet and of human
   beings. Moreover, microorganisms are the main protagonists in food,
   medical and biotech industries, and have several environmental
   applications. Accordingly, the characterization and preservation of
   microbial biodiversity are essential not only for the maintenance of
   natural ecosystems but also for research purposes and biotechnological
   exploitation. In this context, culture collections (CCs) and microbial
   biological resource centres (mBRCs) are crucial for the safeguarding and
   circulation of biological resources, as well as for the progress of life
   sciences. This review deals with the expertise and services of CCs, in
   particular concerning preservation and characterization of microbial
   resources, by pointing to the advanced approaches applied to investigate
   a huge reservoir of microorganisms. Data sharing and web services as

Abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance is increasing within the porcine industry with
   consequential high impact on human health, leading to a need for new
   antimicrobials. Lately, the scientific community has turned its interest
   towards natural compounds, and different essential oils have been tested
   on spermatozoa for preliminary assessment of toxicity before considering
   them as good substitutes for standard antibiotics. The aim of the
   present work was to investigate the potential antimicrobial effect of
   Melaleuca alternifolia and Rosmarinus officinalis essential oils,
   already evaluated for toxicity, on swine artificial insemination doses
   deprived of spermatozoa and stored at 16 degrees C for 5 days. This was
   accomplished by setting up an in vitro model with a standardized
   quantity of E. coli. Essential oils, previously chemo-characterized by
   means of gas chromatography, were tested at 0.2 and 0.4 mg/ml. Analyses,
   performed at 24 and 120 h, included optical density evaluation,
   bacterial DNA quantification by qPCR, and colony count. The results
   demonstrate that both Melaleuca alternifolia and Rosmarinus officinalis
   essential oils, at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml, are capable of
   delivering similar effects to ampicillin, used as control, on the
   experimental samples. At the lower concentration, M. alternifolia
   essential oil seemed more effective when compared to R. officinalis.
   Overall, these findings strengthen the hypothesis of the potential use
   of phyto-complexes as antimicrobial agents for reproductive
   biotechnologies.},

Title = {Trace elements in vegetables and fruits cultivated in Southern Italy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FOOD COMPOSITION AND ANALYSIS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {84},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The levels of trace elements in a variety of fruit and vegetables have
   been investigated. A total of 161 samples were randomly collected on the
   field during the proper seasons in Campania region of Southern Italy to
   be included in this study. The selected agricultural producing area,
   within the provinces of Naples and Caserta, is well-known for the
   problem of toxic wastes illegally disposed and buried in its territory,
   that caused health and food security concerns to the consumers of food
   cultivated in those lands. Trace element levels were measured by using
   inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results of
   this study were used to assess the contributions of fruit and vegetables
   to the intake of heavy metals and the potential health risk for
   consumers by estimating the daily intake (EDI). The concentrations of
   Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Sr, Tl, U, V and Zn in selected foodstuffs were
   detected around the following mean values respectively: 0.010- 0.021-
   2.81- 2.99- 0.185- 0.143- 2.64 -0.005- 0.003 -0.018- 4.96 mg/kg fresh
   weight (f.w.). Results showed that in all groups Cu, Mn, Sr, and Zn were
   the most abundant elements that are more likely to accumulate in nuts
   with mean value at 5.69 mg/kg f.w., followed by leaf vegetables with
   mean value at 1.05 mg/kg f.w. and finally fruit with mean value at 0.43
   mg/kg f.w. Although these three groups show the highest contribution to
   the respective intakes, within all the food categories the EDI was below
   the threshold values for all the analysed elements, indicating that
   there is not an obvious health risk for the consumption of vegetables
   cultivated in the selected area.},

Abstract = {The fatty acid (FA) profile of wild Theba pisana, Cornu aspersum, and
   Eobania vermiculata land snail samples, collected in Sicily (Southern
   Italy), before and after heat treatment at +100 degrees C were examined
   by gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID). The
   results show a higher content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in
   all of the examined raw snails samples, representing up to 48.10\% of
   the total fatty acids contents, followed by monounsaturated fatty acids
   (MUFAs). The thermal processing of the snail samples examined determined
   an overall reduction of PUFA levels (8.13\%, 7.75\%, and 4.62\% for T.
   pisana, C. aspersum and E. vermiculata samples, respectively) and a
   species-specific variation of saturated fatty acid (SFA) contents. Oleic
   acid remained the most abundant FA of all of the snails species
   examined, accounting for up to 29.95\% of the total FA content. A
   relevant decrease of ?3/?6 ratio was found only for T. pisana samples.
   The principal component analysis (PCA) showed a separation of the snail
   samples in terms of species and heat treatment. The results of this work
   suggest land snails as a valuable source of MUFA and PUFA contents and
   boiling as appropriate treatment, according to the maintenance of
   healthy properties.},

Abstract = {Cryptosporidium is a protozoan that infects a wide variety of
   vertebrates, including humans, causing acute gastroenteritis. The
   disease manifests with abdominal pain and diarrhea similar to that of
   choleric infection. In the immunocompromised hosts, the parasite causes
   prolonged infections that can also be fatal. For this reason,
   cryptosporidiosis is considered one of riskiest opportunistic infections
   for patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The best way to
   control the infection in these patients is setting up sensitive and
   specific diagnostic tests for epidemiological surveillance and morbidity
   reduction. Here, we summarized the general aspects of Cryptosporidium
   infection focusing on available diagnostic tools used for the diagnosis
   of cryptosporidiosis. Molecular methods currently available for its
   detection and progress in the development of new diagnostics for
   cryptosporidiosis are also discussed.},

   north-eastern regions with the highest density of poultry farms
   (Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto). We perform integrated analyses of
   genetic, spatiotemporal and host data within a Bayesian phylogenetic
   framework. Using continuous and discrete phylogeography, we estimate the
   locations of movements responsible for the spread and persistence of the
   epidemic. The information derived from these analyses on rates of
   transmission between regions through time can be used to assess the
   success of control measures. Using an approach based on
   phylogenetic-temporal distances between domestic cases, we infer the
   presence of cryptic wild bird-mediated transmission, information that
   can be used to complement existing epidemiological methods for
   distinguishing transmission within the domestic population from
   incursions across the wildlife-domestic interface, a common challenge in
   veterinary epidemiology. Spatiotemporal reconstruction of the epidemic
   reveals a highly skewed distribution of virus movements with a high
   proportion of shorter distance local movements interspersed with
   occasional long-distance dispersal events associated with wild birds. We
   also show how such inference be used to identify possible instances of
   human-mediated movements where distances between phylogenetically linked
   domestic cases are unusually high.},

Abstract = {The economic costs of contagious agalactia (CA) to the small ruminant
   dairy industry are not well known but include losses due to mortality,
   lowered milk production, spoiled products, abortions and animal welfare
   problems, as well as diagnosis and treatment. This paper reports
   financial estimates made in southern Europe, including a study on small-
   and large-scale farming systems in Italy, indicating that the financial
   losses are high and underestimated. Furthermore, the current control
   strategies, including chemotherapy and vaccination, in selected
   countries in Europe are described. In some countries, disease control is
   hampered by excessively strict veterinary legislation which discourages
   farmers and private veterinarians from notifying outbreaks because it
   leads to the prohibition of milk sales and can result in delays in
   lifting restrictions. In addition, new European Union legislation may
   downgrade the importance of CA, which will have implications for
   international research efforts. Finally, a series of recommendations are
   provided that cover the proper notification and handling of CA
   outbreaks, including movement control, current diagnostics, treatment,
   vaccination and disinfection.},

Title = {Influence of Zinc Feeding on Nutritional Quality, Oxidative Stability
   and Volatile Profile of Fresh and Ripened Ewes' Milk Cheese},
Journal = {FOODS},

Abstract = {Zinc represents a ubiquitous element in cells with relevant roles in the
   metabolism of essential nutrients in animals. The aim of this study was
   to investigate the effect of dietary zinc supplementation on nutritional
   and aromatic properties of milk and Pecorino cheeses obtained from
   lactating ewes. Fifty-two commercial ewes were randomly assigned to two
   groups. The control group was fed with a conventional complete diet,
   while the experimental group received a daily supplementation of 375
   mg/head of zinc oxide. At the end of the trial, which lasted 30 days,
   samples of milk and related cheese were collected in order to obtain
   information about the chemical composition and volatile profile. The
   experimental feeding strategy induced a significant increase in zinc
   concentration in milk. Furthermore, both in milk and cheese, was
   observed an increase in vaccenic, rumenic and total polyunsaturated
   fatty acids, with the consequent significant reduction of atherogenic
   and thrombogenic indices. The volatile profile of dairy products was
   also positively affected by dietary zinc intake, with an increase in
   concentration of hexanoic acid and ethyl esters. The present study
   suggests interesting possible effects of dietary zinc supplementation of
   ewes in improving the nutritional characteristics of fresh and ripened
   dairy products, although more specific and in-depth assessments should
   be performed on these new products, in order to characterize potential
   variations on consumers acceptability.},

Abstract = {In poultry production, probiotics have shown promise to limit
   campylobacteriosis at the farm level, the most commonly reported
   zoonosis in Europe. The aim of this trial was to evaluate the effects of
   Saccharomyces supplementation in Campylobacter jejuni challenged
   chickens on performance and intestinal ecosystem. A total of 156 day old
   male Ross 308 chicks were assigned to a basal control diet (C) or to a
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii CNCM I-1079 supplemented diet (S).
   All the birds were orally challenged with C. jejuni on day (d) 21. Live
   weight and growth performance were evaluated on days 1, 21, 28 and 40.
   The histology of intestinal mucosa was analyzed and the gut microbiota
   composition was assessed by 16S rRNA. Performance throughout the trial
   as well as villi length and crypt depth were positively influenced by
   yeast supplementation. A higher abundance of operational taxonomic units
   (OTUs) annotated as Lactobacillusreuteri and Faecalibacterium
   prausnitzii and a lower abundance of Campylobacter in fecal samples from
   S compared to the C group were reported. Supplementation with
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii can effectively modulate the
   intestinal ecosystem, leading to a higher abundance of beneficial
   microorganisms and modifying the intestinal mucosa architecture, with a
   subsequent improvement of the broilers' growth performance.},

Abstract = {Considering that Aurora kinase inhibitors are currently under clinical
   investigation in hematologic cancers, the identification of molecular
   events that limit the response to such agents is essential for enhancing
   clinical outcomes. Here, we discover a NF-kappa B-inducing kinase
   (NIK)-c-Abl-STAT3 signaling-centered feedback loop that restrains the
   efficacy of Aurora inhibitors in multiple myeloma. Mechanistically, we
   demonstrate that Aurora inhibition promotes NIK protein stabilization
   via downregulation of its negative regulator TRAF2. Accumulated NIK
   converts c-Abl tyrosine kinase from a nuclear proapoptotic into a
   cytoplasmic antiapoptotic effector by inducing its phosphorylation at
   Thr735, Tyr245 and Tyr412 residues, and, by entering into a trimeric
   complex formation with c-Abl and STAT3, increases both the
   transcriptional activity of STAT3 and expression of the antiapoptotic
   STAT3 target genes PIM1 and PIM2. This consequently promotes cell
   survival and limits the response to Aurora inhibition. The functional
   disruption of any of the components of the trimer NIK-c-Abl-STAT3 or the
   PIM survival kinases consistently enhances the responsiveness of myeloma
   cells to Aurora inhibitors. Importantly, concurrent inhibition of NIK or
   c-Abl disrupts Aurora inhibitor-induced feedback activation of STAT3 and
   sensitizes myeloma cells to Aurora inhibitors, implicating a combined
   inhibition of Aurora and NIK or c-Abl kinases as potential therapies for
   multiple myeloma. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of cAbl
   together with Aurora resulted in substantial cell death and tumor
   regression in vivo. The findings reveal an important functional
   interaction between NIK, Abl and Aurora kinases, and identify the NIK,
   c-Abl and PIM survival kinases as potential pharmacological targets for
   improving the efficacy of Aurora inhibitors in myeloma.},

Volume = {27},

Abstract = {Cystidicola farionis is a nematode of the swim bladder that parasitizes
   Salmonidae and Osmeridae families, with a range of diffusion in Europe,
   Asia, and North America. During a fish health monitoring performed in
   July 2017 in a trout farm located in northwest Italy, a prevalence of
   70\% for C. farionis was recorded in rainbow trout from a unique tank.
   In order to clarify the first occurrence of this parasite in northwest
   Italy, a total of 180 specimens were analysed in different seasons to
   obtain prevalence, mean intensity, and mean abundance of infestation.
   Moreover, amphipods were also sampled during each fish sampling
   campaign. Only fish sampled in August 2017 were positive for C.
   farionis, since fish were then sold and replaced with a new batch. All
   isolated nematodes were identified by morphological criteria as
   subadults (L4), but not sexually matured. All examined amphipods (genus
   Gammarus) resulted negative for the presence of the parasite. The most
   probable explanation of this report was due to the movement of a single
   fish batch from northeast Italy, previously described as an endemic area
   for this parasite. The absence of the parasite in the amphipods and
   consequently in other fish batches from other tanks are due to the
   lifetime cycle of the parasite that had no time to infect new hosts.},

Abstract = {Hepatitis E is an emerging threat in industrialized countries. The
   foodborne transmission linked to consumption of pork and game meat is
   considered the main source of autochthonous infection. In Europe, small
   outbreaks have been reported linked to the consumption of pork liver
   sausages and wild boar meat. Based on previous findings and on
   increasing evidence of pork and game meat as a vehicle for HEV
   infections, the present study investigated the occurrence of HEV in 99
   pork and 63 wild boar sausages and salami sold in Southern Italy. The
   HEV genome was detected in four wild boar sausages. Sequencing from 2
   wild boar sausages confirmed that the HEV strains detected belonged to
   HEV-3 genotype, not assigned to any defined subtype. Data obtained
   confirmed the possible occurrence of HEV in pork products and in game.
   Although the detection rate is low, these products are frequently
   consumed raw after curing, whose effect on virus viability is still
   unknown.},

Title = {Lipid nanoparticles as vehicles for oral delivery of insulin and insulin
   analogs: preliminary ex vivo and in vivo studies},

Abstract = {Aims Subcutaneous administration of insulin in patients suffering from
   diabetes is associated with the distress of daily injections. Among
   alternative administration routes, the oral route seems to be the most
   advantageous for long-term administration, also because the peptide
   undergoes a hepatic first-pass effect, contributing to the inhibition of
   the hepatic glucose output. Unfortunately, insulin oral administration
   has so far been hampered by degradation by gastrointestinal enzymes and
   poor intestinal absorption. Loading in lipid nanoparticles should allow
   to overcome these limitations.
   Methods Entrapment of peptides into such nanoparticles is not easy,
   because of their high molecular weight, hydrophilicity and
   thermo-sensitivity. In this study, this objective was achieved by
   employing fatty acid coacervation method: solid lipid nanoparticles and
   newly engineered nanostructured lipid carriers were formulated. Insulin
   and insulin analog-glargine insulin-were entrapped in the lipid matrix
   through hydrophobic ion pairing.
   Results Bioactivity of lipid entrapped peptides was demonstrated through
   a suitable in vivo experiment. Ex vivo and in vivo studies were carried
   out by employing fluorescently labelled peptides. Gut tied up
   experiments showed the superiority of glargine insulin-loaded
   nanostructured lipid carriers, which demonstrated significantly higher
   permeation (till 30\% dose/mL) compared to free peptide. Approximately
   6\% absolute bioavailability in the bloodstream was estimated for the
   same formulation through in vivo pharmacokinetic studies in rats.
   Consequently, a discrete blood glucose responsivity was noted in healthy
   animals.
   Conclusions Given the optimized ex vivo and in vivo intestinal uptake of
   glargine insulin from nanostructured lipid carriers, further studies
   will be carried out on healthy and diabetic rat models in order to
   establish a glargine insulin dose-glucose response relation.},

Title = {Diversity of Rickettsia in Ticks Collected in Abruzzi and Molise Regions

Journal = {MICROORGANISMS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Rickettsiae have worldwide occurrence and rickettsiosis are widely
   recognized as emerging infections in several parts of the world. For
   decades, it was thought that a single pathogenic tick-borne spotted
   fever group (SFG), Rickettsia, occurred in each continent. Nowadays,
   thanks to molecular biology, new species of Rickettsia responsible for
   disease in humans are continuously identified worldwide. In a framework
   of diagnostic activities of the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale
   dell'Abruzzo e del Molise ``G. Gaporale{''} and considering some reports
   of suspected human clinical cases of rickettsiosis, a survey on ticks
   collected form animals and humans was carried out with the aim to
   identify the Rickettsia species circulating in Abruzzi and Molise
   regions. A total of 603 ticks, previously identified at species level by
   morphology, pooled into 178 tick samples, were tested by pan-Rickettsia
   RealTime PCR. DNA from specimens positive for Rickettsia spp. was then
   sequenced in order to identify the Rickettsia species involved. The
   highest infection rate was detected in Dermacentor marginatus followed
   by Ixodes ricinus. The selected targets for this purpose were OmpA and
   gltA. Rickettsia slovaca, Rickettsia monacensis, Rickettsia massiliae,
   Rickettsia conorii, Rickettsia aeschlimannii, Rickettsia helvetica,
   Rickettsia raoultii, and Rickettsia felis - like organisms were
   identified in this study. These are the first data available in the
   literature for the circulation of SFG Rickettsia species in the selected
   geographical area. Results made evidence of high rate of infection in
   ticks. All Rickettsia species detected have been previously involved in
   human infection. The diversity of Rickettsia detected, and tick species
   collected reflects the biodiversity in term of wildlife and environment
   of the area. An association between Rickettsia species, ticks, and the
   relationships with vertebrate host species are discussed. Due to the
   peculiar eco-biology of each Rickettsia species, the use of diagnostic
   tools able to identify Rickettsia at the species level is thus
   recommended in order to assess the risk for humans and to elucidate more
   precise etiological diagnosis in clinical cases.},

Title = {A Summer Mortality Outbreak of Lactococcosis by Lactococcus garvieae in

Abstract = {Simple SummaryLactococcus garvieae is the etiological agent of
   lactococcosis, a bacterial disease affecting many species of fish and
   causing major economic losses in aquaculture. In this study we
   described, for the first time, the isolation of L. garvieae in brook
   trout farmed in northwestern Italy by performing a molecular and
   epidemiological characterization. Results confirmed water as vehicle of
   infection, favoring the transmission of the pathogen between rainbow
   trout farmed in the upstream compartments of a raceways system and the
   brook trout located in downstream tanks.
   Abstract Lactococcosis is a fish disease of major concern in
   Mediterranean countries caused by Lactococcus garvieae. The most
   susceptible species is the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss),
   suffering acute disease associated with elevated mortalities compared to
   other fish species. References reported that other salmonids are also
   susceptible to the disease, but no mortality outbreak has been described
   to date. The aim of this study was to present a mortality outbreak that
   occurred in brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) farmed in northwestern
   Italy during the summer of 2018. Fish exhibited clinical signs, such as
   exophthalmos, diffused hemorrhages localized in the ocular zone,
   hemorrhagic enteritis, and enlarged spleen. L. garvieae was isolated in
   all fish. Molecular and epidemiological characterization of the
   isolates, through Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE), confirmed the
   initial hypothesis of water as vehicle of infection favoring
   transmission between rainbow trout farmed in upstream compartments and
   brook trout located in downstream tanks. Moreover, several environmental
   conditions affected and promoted the outbreak, among them the high-water
   temperature, which probably induced a physiological stress in brook
   trout, being way above the optimal temperature for this species,
   increasing the susceptibility to infection.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to describe liver alterations observed in a
   bullhead (Cottus gobio) population from a high-mountain lake (Dimon
   Lake; 1857 m a.s.l.) located in Carnic Alps (Northeast Italy). Two fish
   sampling campaigns (summer and autumn) were performed in 2017 to explore
   the possible causes of this phenomenon. In addition, to investigate the
   typical liver features of C. gobio, control specimens were captured from
   Degano Creek in the same seasons. Total length, weight, and liver weight
   were recorded in fish from both sampling sites. In addition, Fulton's
   condition factor (K) and hepatosomatic index (HSI) were calculated.
   Stomach contents were also analyzed. Liver from each specimen was
   sampled, and histological examination was carried out. Liver steatosis
   (L) (nuclear displacement and cytoplasm vacuolization) were
   histologically evaluated by assigning a semiquantitative severity score.
   A significant difference in L was found between Dimon Lake and Degano
   Creek in both summer (Mann-Whitney test; p = 0.0001) and autumn
   (Mann-Whitney test; p < 0.0001). Regarding HSI, a significant difference
   was also recorded between Dimon Lake and Degano Creek in summer
   (Mann-Whitney test; p < 0.0001) and also in autumn (Mann-Whitney test; p
   < 0.0001), but no seasonal change in K values was recorded between the
   two sites in both summer (Mann-Whitney test; p = 0.8589) and autumn
   (Mann-Whitney test; p = 0.6415). A significant positive correlation
   between HSI and L was found (rho S 0.573). The causes of this
   abnormality might be related to adaptation by the fish to the
   high-altitude environment, accumulating lipids in the liver to tackle
   the adverse season, which lasts for 6 months of the year. Nonetheless,
   our study does not preclude steatosis induced by a nearly exclusive
   chironomids diet in bullhead from Dimon Lake.},

Title = {Evaluation and quantification of antimicrobial residues and
   antimicrobial resistance genes in two Italian swine farms},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {255},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) are considered emerging
   environmental pollutants, posing potential risks for human and animal
   health: the misuse of antimicrobials in food-producing animals could
   favour the maintenance and spread of resistances in bacteria. The
   occurrence of ARGs in Italian swine farming - which has specific
   characteristics - was investigated in order to explore resistance spread
   dynamics. Two farrow-to-finish pig farms were longitudinally monitored:
   faecal samples from animals and environmental samples were collected.
   DNA was extracted and tetA, ermB, qnrS and mcr1 ARGs were analysed by
   qPCR for their ability to confer resistance to highly or critically
   important antimicrobials (CIAs). Moreover, 16SrDNA gene was analysed to
   assess bacterial abundance. ermB and tetA genes were found in animal
   samples and manure samples. On the contrary, mcr1 was exclusively found
   in weaners, while qnrS occurred in all animal categories but sows and
   finishers. Among the analysed genes, ermB and tetA showed the highest
   absolute and relative abundances. Our results indicate that ermB and
   tetA ARGs are widely disseminated in the explored farms, suggesting
   efficient maintenance among bacteria and persistence in the environment.
   Interestingly, the presence of qnrS and mcr1, limited to just a few
   animal categories, highlights inefficient dissemination of these genes
   in the farm environment, in particular for mcr1, a stable plasmid gene
   conferring resistance to the last-resort antimicrobial, colistin. Paying
   close attention only to the finishing phase would have hampered the
   discovery of resistances to CIAs at farm level, which we instead
   identified thanks to an intensive longitudinal monitoring programme. (C)

Abstract = {Identification and quantification of Non Intentionally Added Substances
   (NIAS) at low concentrations and eventually their distribution on Low
   Density Polyethylene (LDPE) films is an important issue. As Raman
   spectroscopy techniques are innovative and sensitive analytical methods
   and do not require pretreatment and manipulation of the sample, these
   were used for the identification of NIAS in LDPE pellet and films, which
   are commonly used for food packaging applications. The aggregation state
   of NIAS in LDPE were observed by Raman imaging with micrometric
   resolution. Four main NIAS compounds were identified in granule and film
   surfaces by confocal Raman spectroscopy: calcite (CaCO3), calcium
   sulphate (CaSO4), polystyrene (PS) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) in
   anatase form. By a semi-quantitative evaluation of the inorganic NIAS,
   9.93 mg/kg of CaCO3, 1.62 mg/kg of CaSO4 and 0.17 mg/kg of TiO2 were
   estimated. The experimental findings achieved by Raman analysis were
   confirmed by the results obtained by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass
   Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Moreover, the toxicity of the identified
   compounds was examined according to the Cramer rules.},

Title = {X-ray irradiation as a valid technique to prolong food shelf life: The
   case of ricotta cheese},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL DAIRY JOURNAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {99},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The sanitising effects of X-rays were studied on ricotta cheese at
   intensities of 0.5, 2 and 3 kGy, using products manufactured artisanally
   and industrially. Microbiological, sensory and pH evaluations were
   performed during refrigerated storage. The artisanal ricotta irradiated
   at the two highest intensities (2 and 3 kGy) remained acceptable for
   more than 20 days, whereas the untreated samples became unacceptable
   after only 3 days of storage. The shelf life of the product irradiated
   at 0.5 kGy was limited to 14 days, due to the appearance of sensory
   defects. The industrial product irradiated at all X-rays intensities
   recorded a significant shelf life prolongation up to 84 days compared
   with the control, which was rejected after 40 days due to sensory
   defects. The results show that X-ray treatment can significantly prolong
   the shelf life of ricotta cheese, boosting the marketability of this
   fresh dairy product far from the local production sites. (C) 2019

Abstract = {Modern European beekeeping is facing numerous challenges due to a
   variety of factors, mainly related to globalisation, agrochemical
   pollution and environmental changes. In addition to this, new pathogens
   threaten the health of European honey bees. In that context, correct
   colony management should encompass a wider vision, where productivity
   aspects are linked to a One Health approach in order to protect honey
   bees, humans and the environment. This paper describes a novel tool to
   be applied in beekeeping operations: good beekeeping practices (GBPs).
   The authors ranked a list of GBPs scored against their importance and
   validated by an international team, including researchers, national
   animal health authorities and international beekeepers' associations.
   These activities were carried out in the project `BPRACTICES', approved
   within the transnational call of the European Research Area Network on
   Sustainable Animal Production (ERA-NET SusAn) in the Horizon 2020
   Research and Innovation Programme of the European Union. This study,
   created through an international collaboration, aims to present an
   innovative and implementable approach, similar to applications already
   adopted in other livestock production systems.},

Title = {Gastrointestinal parasites in shelter cats of central Italy},
Journal = {VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY- REGIONAL STUDIES AND REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {18},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In Italy, the limited resources and the large number of cats living in
   feline shelters may facilitate the spread of parasite infections that
   may affect the health of cats and expose shelter workers and adoptive
   owners to zoonosis. Prevalence and risk factors of potential zoonotic
   and hostspecific gastrointestinal parasite infections were assessed in
   cats living in public and private shelters of central Italy. Individual
   fecal samples were examined macroscopically and then screened
   microscopically by fresh and Lugol stained fecal smears and by flotation
   and the Baermann tests. A commercial rapid immunechromatographic assay
   was used to detect Giardia duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp. All
   animals were clinically examined to evaluate presence of clinical signs
   compatible to parasitic infections. Data were statistically analysed by
   multivariate analysis with logistic regression and chi square testing
   for bivariate analysis. The overall prevalence of gastrointestinal
   parasites in the shelter cats surveyed was 22\% (29/132), with 26/132
   (19.7\%) of the animals infected with potentially zoonotic organisms.
   Upon statistical analysis, parasite infections were identified in
   significantly more cats younger than 18 months of age (p < 0.05), and
   most often associated with the presence of compatible clinical signs (p
   < 0.05). A higher prevalence of protozoan infections (18.1\%, 24/132)
   than of helminth infections (12.9\%, 17/132) was observed. Identified
   parasites were Giardia duodenalis (10.6\%, 14/132), Toxocara cati (9\%,
   12/132), Cystoisospora fells (3\%, 4/132), Cystoisospora rivolta (2.3\%,
   3/132), hookworms (2.3\%, 3/132), Cryptosporidium spp. (1.6\%, 2/ 132),
   Aonchotheca putorii (0.75\%, 1/132), Tritrichomonas foetus (0.75\%,
   1/132) and Strongyloides sp. (0.75\%, 1/ 132). Co-infections were
   identified in the 7.6\% of animals surveyed. Results obtained from this
   study indicate high gastrointestinal parasite risk to shelter cats and
   public health in the examined areas and suggest the need for more
   effective control measures in shelters surveyed.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases are a significant public
   and animal health threat. In some zoonosis, the early detection of virus
   spread in animals is a crucial early warning for humans. The analyses of
   animal surveillance data are therefore of paramount importance for
   public health authorities to identify the appropriate control measure
   and intervention strategies in case of epidemics. The interaction among
   host, vectors, pathogen and environment require the analysis of more
   complex and diverse data coming from different sources. There is a wide
   range of spatiotemporal methods that can be applied as a surveillance
   tool for cluster detection, identification of risk areas and risk
   factors and disease transmission pattern evaluation. However, despite
   the growing effort, most of the recent integrated applications still
   lack of managing simultaneously different datasets and at the same time
   making available an analytical tool for a complete epidemiological
   assessment. In this paper, we present EpiExploreR, a user-friendly,
   flexible, R-Shiny web application. EpiExploreR provides tools
   integrating common approaches to analyze spatiotemporal data on animal
   diseases in Italy, including notified outbreaks, surveillance of
   vectors, animal movements data and remotely sensed data. Data
   exploration and analysis results are displayed through an interactive
   map, tables and graphs. EpiExploreR is addressed to scientists and
   researchers, including public and animal health professionals wishing to
   test hypotheses and explore data on surveillance activities.},

Title = {Emotional Transfer in Human-Horse Interaction: New Perspectives on
   Equine Assisted Interventions},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Equine assisted interventions (EAIs) represent an
   emerging field of animal assisted interventions (AAIs), employing horses
   in a wide variety of activities with humans. Based on the
   socio-emotional competences of this species, which evolved sophisticated
   communicative skills to interrelate with humans, we here hypothesized
   the occurrence of an interspecific emotional transfer during
   interventions. The emotional transfer hypothesis suggests a mutual
   coordination of emotional states of humans and horses, which are going
   through a coupling process during the interaction. Even though this
   mechanism is supported by few existing studies on human-horse emotional
   fine-tuning, it could play a key role in EAIs. We moreover propose to
   measure this coordination through monitoring physiological variables
   with a novel multidisciplinary method. In the future, having an insight
   on emotional states of animals involved in AAIs could be useful to
   ameliorate the wellbeing of both animal and human subjects and to better
   standardize operational strategies.
   Abstract Equine assisted interventions (EAIs) include all therapeutic
   interventions aimed at improving human wellbeing through the involvement
   of horses. Due to the prominent emotional involvement traditionally
   characterizing their relation with humans, horses developed
   sophisticated communicative skills, which fostered their ability to
   respond to human emotional states. In this review, we hypothesize that
   the proximate causation of successful interventions could be
   human-animal mutual coordination, through which the subjects bodily and,
   most importantly, emotionally come into contact. We propose that
   detecting emotions of other individuals and developing the capacity to
   fine-tune one's own emotional states accordingly (emotional transfer
   mechanism), could represent the key engine triggering the positive
   effects of EAIs. We provide a comprehensive analysis of horses'
   socio-emotional competences according to recent literature and we
   propose a multidisciplinary approach to investigate this inter-specific
   match. By considering human and horse as a unique coupling system during
   the interaction, it would be possible to objectively measure the degree
   of coordination through the analysis of physiological variables of both
   human and animal. Merging the state of art on human-horse relationship
   with the application of novel methodologies, could help to improve
   standardized protocols for animal assisted interventions, with
   particular regard to the emotional states of subjects involved.},

Title = {Performance of an Immunochromatographic Test (ICT) in Comparison to Some
   Commonly Used Serological Tests for the Diagnosis of Brucellosis in
   Dromedary Camels (Camelus dromedarius)},
Journal = {MICROORGANISMS},
Year = {2019},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Serological tests may represent an essential tool for the diagnosis of
   camel brucellosis; however, concerns arise in the scientific community
   regarding the direct transposition from cattle and small ruminants
   without adequate validation. The present study was made to compare four
   serological tests for the diagnosis of brucellosis in dromedary camels
   (Camelus dromedarius). In terms of sensitivity, our results show that
   the Immunochromatographic Test (ICT) shows the higher value of
   sensitivity, 98.67\% (95\% Confidence Level (C.L): 94.36-99.99\%),
   followed by the Fluorescence Polarization Assay (FPA) with 95.05\% (95\%
   C.L: 88.23-99.51\%), then the Competitive Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent
   Assay (c-ELISA) with 94.94\% (95\% C.L: 88.25-99.45\%) and, finally, the
   Rose Bengal Test (RBT) with 68.95\% (95\% C.L: 56.55-80.69\%), which is
   the only test showing a significantly lower sensitivity compared to the
   others. On the other hand, our study revealed no significant difference
   in terms of specificity between all the tests under study, with a range
   from 99.06\% (95\% C.L: 98.34-99.64\%) for the ICT to 99.92\% (95\% C.L:
   99.64-100\%) for the RBT. The ICT was found to be comparable in terms of
   sensitivity and specificity with the most commonly used tests for camel
   brucellosis. The results of the present study are of paramount
   importance for designing surveillance and control measures for
   brucellosis in camel populations.},

Abstract = {Purpose Taenia hydatigena cysticercosis, due to Cysticercus tenuicollis,
   is a parasitic disease infecting domestic and wild animals worldwide
   causing economic and productive losses. Nonetheless, little attention
   has been paid to the role of the wild ungulates in the epidemiology of
   this disease. In the last years, the increasing population of wild boars
   in Europe has raised the attention of researchers on their role in the
   spreading of several infections, including those caused by cestodes.
   Herein, we report the description of a massive infection due to T.
   hydatigena cysticercosis in a wild boar from southern Italy. Methods An
   adult female boar was examined during the hunting season 2018 within the
   regional project ``Piano Emergenza Cinghiali in Campania{''}. A complete
   necropsy was performed on the boar carcass and all viscera were examined
   to determine number and location of the cysts. Morphological and
   molecular analyses of the cysts were performed to confirm the C.
   tenuicollis identity. Results The boar examined has revealed an
   impressive massive infection with 265 cysts. Measurements of the large
   and small larval hooks showed a mean of length as 200.3 mu m and 136.8
   mu m, respectively. Molecular analysis of Cox1 and ND1 mitochondrial
   genes confirmed the C. tenuicollis identity. Conclusions Our findings
   suggest that wild boar could be involved in the epidemiology of T.
   hydatigena, due to the significant amount of boar raw offal available to
   definitive hosts (i.e., hunting dogs, foxes and wolves), during the
   hunting seasons.},

Title = {The Effectiveness of Dog Population Management: A Systematic Review},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Domestic dogs are abundant worldwide-as owned pets,
   unowned strays, and feral animals. High numbers of free-roaming dogs can
   be a concern because of the risks they pose to public health, animal
   welfare, and wildlife. Using a systematic review process, we
   investigated what the research published to date can tell us about the
   effectiveness of different dog population management methods. We found
   that management methods for dog populations have been researched in
   multiple countries worldwide, using a wide range of indicators to assess
   method effectiveness. We outline the results and suggest improvements to
   help guide future dog population management policy.
   Abstract The worldwide population of domestic dogs is estimated at
   approximately 700 million, with around 75\% classified as
   ``free-roaming{''}. Where free-roaming dogs exist in high densities,
   there are significant implications for public health, animal welfare,
   and wildlife. Approaches to manage dog populations include culling,
   fertility control, and sheltering. Understanding the effectiveness of
   each of these interventions is important in guiding future dog
   population management. We present the results of a systematic review of
   published studies investigating dog population management, to assess:
   (1) where and when studies were carried out; (2) what population
   management methods were used; and (3) what was the effect of the method.
   We evaluated the reporting quality of the published studies for strength
   of evidence assessment. The systematic review resulted in a corpus of 39
   papers from 15 countries, reporting a wide disparity of approaches and
   measures of effect. We synthesised the management methods and reported
   effects. Fertility control was most investigated and had the greatest
   reported effect on dog population size. Reporting quality was low for
   power calculations (11\%), sample size calculations (11\%), and the use
   of control populations (17\%). We provide recommendations for future
   studies to use common metrics and improve reporting quality, study
   design, and modelling approaches in order to allow better assessment of
   the true impact of dog population management.},

   pigs in Europe and Asia. In this study, a virological survey was
   performed in Northern Italy to investigate the presence of APPV using
   molecular methods. Testing of 360 abortion samples from pig herds
   revealed two APPV strains from distinct provinces in the Lombardy region
   and testing of 430 wild boar blood samples revealed three strains, one
   from Lombardy and two from Emilia Romagna. The nucleotide sequencing of
   a fragment of the nonstructural protein 3-coding region revealed a high
   similarity to the previously detected European strains (Spanish, German,
   and Italian) of APPV.},

   Regulation No.1169/2011 and No. 1379/2013 and the product identity was
   verified by the use of a full and a mini-DNA barcoding protocol.
   Shortcomings and labelling issue included the absence of a clear
   allergens highlight in 9.8\% of the products analyzed, the incomplete
   mention to the catching area and the lack of fishing gear declaration in
   40\% and 33\% of the products falling within the scope of Regulation No.
   1379/2013. The COI barcodes selected in the study allowed the univocal
   species identification of all the products which were confirmed
   belonging to the species Clupea harengus. The substantial labelling
   compliance and the absence of mislabelling incidents confirmed a high
   level of food business operators training and control along the herring
   supply chain and a strong will to protect and enhance the consumers'
   informed choice.},

Abstract = {Streptococcus agalactiae is the most cause of contagious mastitis,
   mainly subclinic or chronic, increasing somatic cells count, that is a
   hygienic parameter regulated by UE for the raw milk production and that
   adversely affects cheese production and milk composition.
   In 2012 DG Welfare of Lombardy Region programmed a control plan of the
   Streptococcus agalactiae infection with the goal to reduce dairy herd
   prevalence in three years from 17.24\% below 8\%.
   In 2014 at the end of this plan the average prevalence was 11.69\%; only
   during the following three years, mantaining the surveillance plan the
   prevalence decreased to 7.47\%, with values 2-7\% in lowland areas and
   15-25\% in mountainous territories.
   This paper describes epidemiologial characteristics of Streptococcus
   agalactiae and its control methods, showing the infection trend from
   2012 to 2018 and the results of the Control Plan carried out in Lombardy
   Region. Furthermore, some critical issues are discussed about
   eradication, taking in account the main news in the Regional Plan
   published in 2019.},

Title = {Multiple Klebsiella pneumoniae KPC Clones Contribute to an Extended
   Hospital Outbreak},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 29},
Abstract = {The circulation of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is
   a significant problem worldwide. In this work we characterize the
   isolates and reconstruct the spread of a multi-clone epidemic event that
   occurred in an Intensive Care Unit in a hospital in Northern Italy. The
   event took place from August 2015 to May 2016 and involved 23 patients.
   Twelve of these patients were colonized by CRKP at the gastrointestinal
   level, while the other 11 were infected in various body districts. We
   retrospectively collected data on the inpatients and characterized a
   subset of the CRKP isolates using antibiotic resistance profiling and
   whole genome sequencing. A SNP-based phylogenetic approach was used to
   depict the evolutionary context of the obtained genomes, showing that 26
   of the 32 isolates belong to three genome clusters, while the remaining
   six were classified as sporadic. The first genome cluster was composed
   of multi-resistant isolates of sequence type (ST) 512. Among those, two
   were resistant to colistin, one of which indicating the insurgence of
   resistance during an infection. One patient hospitalized in this period
   was colonized by two strains of CRKP, both carrying the blaKPC gene
   (variant KPC-3). The analysis of the genome contig containing the blaKPC
   locus indicates that the gene was not transmitted between the two
   isolates. The second infection cluster comprised four other genomes of
   ST512, while the third one (ST258) colonized 12 patients, causing five
   clinical infections and resulting in seven deaths. This cluster
   presented the highest level of antibiotic resistance, including colistin
   resistance in all 17 analyzed isolates. The three outbreaking clones did
   not present more virulence genes than the sporadic isolates and had
   different patterns of antibiotic resistance, however, were clearly
   distinct from the sporadic ones in terms of infection status, being the
   only ones causing overt infections.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxicity of titanium dioxide
   nanoparticles (TiO(2)NPs) by short-term toxicity tests in Apis
   mellifera, considered an excellent bioindicator organism mainly due to
   its sensitivity. Bees have been exposed to several concentrations of
   TiO(2)NPs (1 x 10(-3), 1 x 10(-4), 1 x 10(-5), 1 x 10(-6) mg/10 ml) for
   10 days. Morphostructural and histological assays were done on gut and
   honey sac. The research of exposure biomarkers like metallothioneins 1
   (MT1) and Heat Shock Protein 70 (HSP70) was performed to verify if a
   detoxification mechanism has been activated in the exposed animals. No
   histological alteration on the epithelium of the gut and honey sac were
   observed in exposed samples. A significant positivity for anti-MT1
   antibody was observed only in the honey sac cells. A weak positivity for
   HSP70 was observed in both structures analyzed. In several studies have
   shown the non-toxicity of TiO(2)NPs on other model organisms, in our
   study, titanium dioxide nanoparticles was proven to be highly toxic at
   the highest concentration tested (100\% of lethality to 1 x 10(-3) mg/10
   ml) and moderately toxic at lower concentrations. Honey bees proved to
   be excellent models for study of NPs toxicity and for monitoring
   environment.},

Abstract = {To describe an operating protocol for bloody diarrhea (BD) in a
   pediatric population as a rapid response to a public health threat
   represented by an excess of pediatric HUS cases in the Apulia region
   (Southern Italy) starting from 2013. The protocol was set up with the
   goal of correct clinical management of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia
   coli (STEC) infections, reductions in subsequent cases of hemolytic
   uremic syndrome (HUS), and improved short- and long-term disease
   outcomes. The protocol consisted of rapid hospitalization of children
   with bloody diarrhea (BD), hematochemical laboratory tests every 12-24
   hours, and prompt laboratory diagnosis of STEC. No antibiotics were
   recommended until diagnosis. Children positive for STEC infections
   underwent early vigorous volume expansion. In June-December 2018, 438
   children with BD were hospitalized, of which 53 (12.1\%) had a STEC
   infection. The most common serogroups were O26 (36.1\%), O111 (23.0\%),
   and O157 (14.8\%). Thirty-one samples carried the stx2 gene. Four cases
   evolved into HUS (7.5\%), all with favorable outcome despite
   neurological involvement in two cases. Prompt and accurate laboratory
   diagnosis of STEC infections is of the utmost importance in patients
   with BD for correct clinical management. The strict adherence to the
   protocol could reduce the progression rate of STEC infections to HUS and
   prevents complications. Enhanced BD surveillance may help reduce cases
   of pediatric HUS in Southern Italy.},

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 22},
Abstract = {The role of Africa in the dynamics of the global spread of a zoonotic
   and economically-important virus, such as the highly pathogenic avian
   influenza (HPAI) H5Nx of the Gs/GD lineage, remains unexplored. Here we
   characterise the spatiotemporal patterns of virus diffusion during three
   HPAI H5Nx intercontinental epidemic waves and demonstrate that Africa
   mainly acted as an ecological sink of the HPAI H5Nx viruses. A joint
   analysis of host dynamics and continuous spatial diffusion indicates
   that poultry trade as well as wild bird migrations have contributed to
   the virus spreading into Africa, with West Africa acting as a crucial
   hotspot for virus introduction and dissemination into the continent. We
   demonstrate varying paths of avian influenza incursions into Africa as
   well as virus spread within Africa over time, which reveal that virus
   expansion is a complex phenomenon, shaped by an intricate interplay
   between avian host ecology, virus characteristics and environmental
   variables.},

Abstract = {Purpose The recurrence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens to the
   latest antibiotics and the limited development of new antibacterial
   agents have reduced the options for the treatment of severe infections.
   The reintroduction of old antibiotics, such as colistin, represents an
   effective strategy, since the latest antibiotics are over-consumed and
   ineffective against MDR pathogens. In 2015, Liu (Lancet Infect Dis
   16:161-168, 2016) reported Escherichia coli (E. coli) isolates carrying
   plasmid-mediated colistin resistance gene mcr-1. The first of mcr-1
   positive colistin-resistant (col-R) E. coli from a human blood culture
   was observed in 2012 in Latin America, while in Italy was reported for
   the first time by our center in 2016. The present study aimed to
   describe the prevalence of mcr-1 positive col-R strains in E.
   coli-related bloodstream infection among patients hospitalized in
   Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo in Pavia, Italy, from 2012 to
   2018, including the three cases already published. Methods All col-R E.
   coli strains isolated from blood cultures collected during the study
   period were analyzed. The minimal inhibitory concentration of colistin
   was determined using broth microdilution and detection of mcr-1 and
   mcr-2 genes was performed by PCR. The sequence type of E. coli mcr-1
   positive was determined according to Multilocus sequence typing. Results
   Out of 1557 samples, 14 strains (0.90\%) were col-R. and positive for
   the presence of the mcr-1 gene, with no mcr-2 detected. The most common
   ST was ST10 (n = 3), followed by ST410 (n = 2). The remaining strains
   exhibited different MLST profiles, indicating that they were genetically
   unrelated. Conclusions Proper reporting of the presence of mcr-1 genes
   is an essential component to anticipate the spread of colistin
   resistance. This public health issue is particularly alarming in Italy
   due to the consistent circulation of MDR bacteria.},

Title = {metaSPARSim: a 16S rRNA gene sequencing count data simulator},
Journal = {BMC BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {20},
Number = {9},
Month = {NOV 22},
Abstract = {Background: In the last few years, 16S rRNA gene sequencing (16S
   rDNA-seq) has seen a surprisingly rapid increase in election rate as a
   methodology to perform microbial community studies. Despite the
   considerable popularity of this technique, an exiguous number of
   specific tools are currently available for proper 16S rDNA-seq count
   data preprocessing and simulation. Indeed, the great majority of tools
   have been developed adapting methodologies previously used for bulk
   RNA-seq data, with poor assessment of their applicability in the
   metagenomics field. For such tools and the few ones specifically
   developed for 16S rDNA-seq data, performance assessment is challenging,
   mainly due to the complex nature of the data and the lack of realistic
   simulation models. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, no software
   thought for data simulation are available to directly obtain synthetic
   16S rDNA-seq count tables that properly model heavy sparsity and
   compositionality typical of these data.
   Results: In this paper we present metaSPARSim, a sparse count matrix
   simulator intended for usage in development of 16S rDNA-seq metagenomic
   data processing pipelines. metaSPARSim implements a new generative
   process that models the sequencing process with a Multivariate
   Hypergeometric distribution in order to realistically simulate 16S
   rDNA-seq count table, resembling real experimental data compositionality
   and sparsity. It provides ready-to-use count matrices and comes with the
   possibility to reproduce different pre-coded scenarios and to estimate
   simulation parameters from real experimental data. The tool is made
   available at http://sysbiobig.dei.unipd.it/?q=Software\# metaSPARSim and
   https://gitlab.com/sysbiobig/metasparsim.
   Conclusion: metaSPARSim is able to generate count matrices resembling
   real 16S rDNA-seq data. The availability of count data simulators is
   extremely valuable both for methods developers, for which a ground truth
   for tools validation is needed, and for users who want to assess state
   of the art analysis tools for choosing the most accurate one. Thus, we
   believe that metaSPARSim is a valuable tool for researchers involved in
   developing, testing and using robust and reliable data analysis methods
   in the context of 16S rRNA gene sequencing.},

Abstract = {The detection/quantification in honey of spores of the bacterial
   pathogen Paenibacillus larvae, etiological agent of the American
   Foulbrood (AFB) infectious disease of honey bees, represents a useful
   diagnostic tool to identify apiaries at risk of outbreaks and apply
   prevention measures. Plate count is the method in use for analyzing
   presence and number of spores but its validity needs to be re-assessed
   since P. larvae field strains showed a low rate of germination in
   culture media. To this aim, culture-dependent P. larvae
   detection/quantification was compared in this study with quantitative
   PCR (qPCR) based analysis for 139 honey samples, each from a different
   apiary, collected in 2017 and 2018 in the Abruzzo region. According to
   qPCR based detection, 59.6\% samples contained P. larvae spores, while,
   according to plate count, only 32.3\% samples were contaminated.
   Moreover, the levels of contamination determined with the two methods
   differed. Many samples (29.5\%) were negative with the cultivation assay
   but positive with the qPCR test, suggesting that not all the field
   strains were able to develop in plate. This hypothesis was confirmed by
   re-testing those samples with PLA medium added with germination
   stimulants and obtaining P. larvae growth. Results strongly suggested
   the necessity to apply improved culture methods or molecular
   detection/quantification for a more reliable AFB risk estimation in
   order to efficiently fight this honey bee plague.},

Abstract = {Background: Usutu virus (USUV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, which
   shares its transmission cycle with the phylogenetically related West
   Nile virus (WNV). USUV circulates in several European countries and its
   activity has increased over the last 5 years. Aim: To describe human
   cases of USUV infection identified by surveillance for WNV and USUV
   infection in the Veneto Region of northern Italy in 2018.
   Methods: From 1 June to 30 November 2018, all cases of suspected
   autochthonous arbovirus infection and blood donors who had a reactive
   WNV nucleic acid test were investigated for both WNV and USUV infection
   by in-house molecular methods. Anti-WNV and anti-USUV lgM and IgG
   antibodies were detected by ELISA and in-house immunofluorescence assay,
   respectively; positive serum samples were further tested by WNV and USUV
   neutralisation assays run in parallel. Results: Eight cases of USUV
   infection (one with neuroinvasive disease, six with fever and one
   viraemic blood donor who developed arthralgia and myalgia) and 427 cases
   of WNV infection were identified. A remarkable finding of this study was
   the persistence of USUV RNA in the blood and urine of three patients
   during follow-up. USUV genome sequences from two patients shared over
   99\% nt identity with USUV sequences detected in mosquito pools from the
   same area and clustered within lineage Europe 2. Conclusions: Clinical
   presentation and laboratory findings in patients with USUV infection
   were similar to those found in patients with WNV infection.
   Cross-reactivity of serology and molecular tests challenged the
   differential diagnosis.},

Abstract = {Background Livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
   aureus (MRSA) belonging to clonal complex 398 is recognized as an
   occupational hazard for workers employed in intensive animal husbandry,
   especially in the swine-breeding chain. In this study, we compared the
   prevalence and epidemiological type of MRSA isolates from swine and farm
   workers in a large area of southern Italy. Methods Between January and
   March 2018, 88 workers from 32 farms where we had previously performed a
   survey for MRSA colonization of farmed pigs, were sampled by nasal
   swabbing. A follow-up investigation was conducted on seven workers 1
   year after primary screening. MRSA isolates were characterized by MLST,
   spa and SCCmec typing, and tested for susceptibility to 15
   antimicrobials. Epidemiological correlations between human and swine
   MRSA isolates were supported by Rep-MP3 and RAPD PCR fingerprinting, and
   whole-genome sequencing. Results The overall colonization rate of MRSA
   in swine farm workers was 21.6\%, being significantly higher in
   intensive farms and in workers with direct animal contact. All human
   MRSA isolates were multi-drug resistant, belonged to the ST398 livestock
   clade, and did not carry Panton-Valentine leukocidin and enterotoxin
   genes. Notably, 94.1\% of human MRSA isolates belonged to the same
   epidemiological type as swine MRSA isolates from the corresponding farm.
   Persistent MRSA carriage was documented in some workers 1 year after
   primary sampling. Conclusions We report a high prevalence of MRSA among
   swine farm workers, with higher colonization rates associated with
   intensive breeding and animal exposure. Our findings suggest
   unidirectional animal-to-human transmission of LA-MRSA and denote the
   high zoonotic transmissibility of the ST398 livestock clade.},

Title = {Sequencing of animal viruses: quality data assurance for NGS
   bioinformatics},
Journal = {VIROLOGY JOURNAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {Background Next generation sequencing (NGS) is becoming widely used
   among diagnostics and research laboratories, and nowadays it is applied
   to a variety of disciplines, including veterinary virology. The NGS
   workflow comprises several steps, namely sample processing, library
   preparation, sequencing and primary/secondary/tertiary bioinformatics
   (BI) analyses. The latter is constituted by a complex process extremely
   difficult to standardize, due to the variety of tools and metrics
   available. Thus, it is of the utmost importance to assess the
   comparability of results obtained through different methods and in
   different laboratories. To achieve this goal, we have organized a
   proficiency test focused on the bioinformatics components for the
   generation of complete genome sequences of salmonid rhabdoviruses.
   Methods Three partners, that performed virus sequencing using different
   commercial library preparation kits and NGS platforms, gathered together
   and shared with each other 75 raw datasets which were analyzed
   separately by the participants to produce a consensus sequence according
   to their own bioinformatics pipeline. Results were then compared to
   highlight discrepancies, and a subset of inconsistencies were
   investigated more in detail. Results In total, we observed 526
   discrepancies, of which 39.5\% were located at genome termini, 14.1\% at
   intergenic regions and 46.4\% at coding regions. Among these, 10 SNPs
   and 99 indels caused changes in the protein products. Overall
   reproducibility was 99.94\%. Based on the analysis of a subset of
   inconsistencies investigated more in-depth, manual curation appeared the
   most critical step affecting sequence comparability, suggesting that the
   harmonization of this phase is crucial to obtain comparable results. The
   analysis of a calibrator sample allowed assessing BI accuracy, being
   99.983\%. Conclusions We demonstrated the applicability and the
   usefulness of BI proficiency testing to assure the quality of NGS data,
   and recommend a wider implementation of such exercises to guarantee
   sequence data uniformity among different virology laboratories.},

Abstract = {Marek's disease (MD) is a lymphoproliferative disease caused by Gallid
   alphaherpesvirus 2 (GaHV-2), which primarily affects chickens. However,
   the virus is also able to induce tumours in turkeys, albeit less
   frequently than in chickens. This study reports the molecular
   characterization of a GaHV-2 strain detected in a flock of Italian
   meat-type turkeys exhibiting visceral lymphomas. Sequencing and
   phylogenetic analysis of the meq gene revealed that the turkey GaHV-2
   has molecular features of high virulence and genetic similarity with
   GaHV-2 strains recently detected in Italian commercial and backyard
   chickens. GaHV-2 is ubiquitous among chickens despite vaccination, and
   chicken-to-turkey transmission is hypothesized due to the presence of
   broilers in neighbouring pens.},

Abstract = {Invertebrates are precious organisms in order to study environmental
   pollution. In particular, they appear to be suitable as a bioindicator
   species for pioneer ecotoxicity studies on new xenobiotics such as
   nanoparticles. In fact, they are able to absorb nanomaterials scattered
   in the environment in different ways and it's known the
   compartmentalization of nano-sized contaminants in selected tissues and
   intracellular organelles. Titanium dioxide represents the most used
   nanoparticulate, destined to become probably ubiquitous in the
   environment. Recently, some research has been published on the toxic
   potential of nano-TiO2 in several animal species. Among all
   invertebrates, Oniscidean Isopods are the only taxon of Crustaceans that
   has become completely terrestrial, known as excellent bioindicators and
   bioaccumulators. They have a digestive gland, the hepatopancreas, which
   is the location of election for the accumulation of pollutants. For this
   reason, they are considered efficient animal models to ecological
   studies. For this study, we collected Armadillo officinalis from Natural
   Oriented Reserve of ``Vendicari{''} (Sicily, Italy), to evaluate the
   toxicity of titanium dioxide (TiO2) on their hepatopancreas, after a
   short period of exposure. We conducted morphostructural and
   immunohistochemistry assays. The results suggested a great capacity of
   the species of bioaccumulation of nanoparticles in the hepatopancreas,
   where a strong positivity to the metallothioneins was highlighted. Our
   study confirms that Oniscidean Isopods, in particular Armadillo
   officinalis, proved to be an appropriate indicator of pollution in
   terrestrial ecosystems from nanoparticles.},

Title = {Diagnosis of Drowning and the Value of the Diatom Test in Veterinary
   Forensic Pathology},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {NOV 14},
Abstract = {The detection of diatoms into the organs is considered an important
   ``biological marker{''} for the diagnosis of drowning in human
   pathology, but it still has a high possibility for false positive
   results. The aims of this study were: (1) to evaluate the contribution
   of pathological examination in drowning cases and (2) to investigate the
   differences in the number and location of diatoms between animals who
   died in drowning and non-drowning conditions. For these purposes, 30
   dead adult dogs were selected for the study and subdivided into five
   groups. The group A comprised six cadavers dead for drowning; the group
   B comprised six control animals; the groups C, D, and E comprised six
   animals dead for causes other than drowning and subsequently immersed in
   water for 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. On each animal, a complete
   macroscopic and histological examination and diatom test were performed.
   Diatoms test and quantification were also performed on drowning mediums.
   Pathological findings of the animals in the group A showed pulmonary
   congestion, oedema, and hemorrages in the lung. However, similar
   injuries were also observed in control and experimentally submerged
   cadavers. In contrast, we observed a statistically differences between
   drowning animals and all experimentally submerged groups and control
   animals regarding diatom numbers recovered from organ tissue samples (p
   < 0.05). Therefore, these findings suggest that the number of diatoms
   may be used as a valid tool to differentiate animals who died in
   drowning and non-drowning conditions, even if the latter were found in
   an aquatic environment.},

Abstract = {Due to the increasing number of studies reporting the detection of
   antimicrobial-resistant isolates of Listeria monocytogenes, we sought to
   determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of L. monocytogenes isolates
   collected in Italy and find potential correlations to their serotypes
   and multilocus sequence types (MLST). The antimicrobial susceptibility
   of 317 L. monocytogenes isolates collected from food, humans, and the
   environment from 1998 to 2009 was assessed by minimum inhibitory
   concentration (MIC). Serotyping and MLST was also performed on all
   isolates. Potential correlations among antimicrobial resistance
   profiles, serotyping, and MLST were statistically evaluated. Twenty-four
   percent of L. monocytogenes isolates were resistant to oxacillin, 28.7\%
   intermediate to clindamycin, and 24.3\% to ciprofloxacin. The majority
   of isolates with elevated MIC to oxacillin was of environmental origin
   and belonged to serotype 4b/4e and ST2. Isolates with intermediate MIC
   values to clindamycin and ciprofloxacin were mostly of food and human
   origin and belonged to serotype 4b/4e and ST9. Regarding the time frame
   of isolate collection, comparing the last 3 years (2007-2009) to
   previous years (1998-2006), an increase was observed in the percentage
   of resistant and intermediate isolates per year. This trend strongly
   suggests the need for increasing attention on the prevalence of
   antimicrobial resistance in L. monocytogenes in Italy. To predict future
   resistance trends, the monitoring of clinical intermediate resistance
   might represent a useful tool especially for antibiotics associated to
   multiple-step mechanisms of acquired resistance. A specific focus should
   be addressed to antimicrobial-resistant isolates of serotype 4b,
   repeatedly associated with food-borne outbreaks.},

Abstract = {The lagovirus rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) has been
   circulating in Australia since the mid-1990s when it was released to
   control overabundant rabbit populations. In recent years, the viral
   diversity of different RHDVs in Australia has increased, and currently
   four different types of RHDV are known to be circulating. To allow for
   ongoing epidemiological studies and impact assessments of these viruses
   on Australian wild rabbit populations, it is essential that serological
   tools are updated. To this end, reference sera were produced against all
   four virulent RHDVs (RHDV, RHDV2 and two different strains of RHDVa)
   known to be present in Australia and tested in a series of available
   immunological assays originally developed for the prototype RHDV, to
   assess patterns of cross-reactivity and the usefulness of these assays
   to detect lagovirus antibodies, either in a generic or specific manner.
   Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) developed to detect antibody
   isotypes IgM, IgA and IgG were sufficiently cross-reactive to detect
   antibodies raised against all four virulent lagoviruses. For the more
   specific detection of antibodies to the antigenically more different
   RHDV2, a competition ELISA was adapted using RHDV2-specific monoclonal
   antibodies in combination with Australian viral antigen. Archival serum
   banks from a long-term rabbit monitoring site where rabbits were sampled
   quarterly over a period of 6 years were re-screened using this assay and
   revealed serological evidence for the arrival of RHDV2 in this
   population at least 5 months prior to its initial detection in Australia
   in a dead rabbit in May 2015. The serological methods and reference
   reagents described here will provide valuable tools to study presence,
   prevalence and impact of RHDV2 on Australian rabbit populations;
   however, the discrimination of different antigenic variants of RHDVs as
   well as mixed infections at the serological level remains challenging.},

Abstract = {In the Mediterranean basin, one of the most important agents of myiasis
   is Oestrus ovis Linnaeus 1758 (Diptera, Oestridae). Herein, we report a
   rare case of nasal myiasis with a secondary infection complication in a
   patient from northern Italy who had been visiting Corsica. A healthy,
   39-year-old Italian woman spent 2 weeks of vacation in Corsica in June
   2018. During her stay, she suddenly felt a foreign body inside her nose,
   followed by cough, pain, burning at the pharyngeal level, cephalalgia,
   and nasal congestion with secretions from the nostrils. The clinical
   examination showed a hyperemic and irritated mucosa and endoscopic
   examination of the patient's nose and right maxillary sinus revealed
   three tiny mobile larvae, morphologically and molecular identified as L1
   instar larvae of Oestrus ovis. The patient's infestation was probably
   imported from Corsica, as Mediterranean islands are ideal geographical
   areas for the development of O. ovis, and the timing of infestation
   match with the period of O. ovis larviposition. Although rhinomyiasis is
   rare, it should be considered in people returning from abroad presenting
   with an acute-onset and foreign body sensation in the nose.},

Title = {A combined morphological and molecular approach for hair identification
   to comply with the European ban on dog and cat fur trade},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {NOV 11},
Abstract = {Animal furs are encountering more and more the detriment of public
   opinion, that is increasingly sensitive to animals, their welfare and
   protection. The feeling of outrage against animal suffering is
   particularly intense when cats and dogs are involved, since these are
   the most popular pets in Western countries. However, in some Asian
   countries breeding of dogs and cats for the fur industry is a common
   practice. These furs and their finished garments are often mislabelled
   in order to be imported and sold to unaware consumers in Western
   countries. The European Union has issued the Regulation 1523/2007, which
   bans the use and trade of dog and cat furs. The main purposes of the
   Regulation were to normalise the internal market and to address the
   concerns of European consumers about the risk of inadvertently buying
   products containing these species. The Regulation states that several
   analytical methods (microscopy, DNA testing and mass spectrometry) can
   be used to exclude dogs and cats as source species, but an official
   analytical protocol was not provided. In this paper, we report on the
   development of a reliable and affordable method for species
   identification in furs, based on a combined morphological and molecular
   approach. Our protocol provides an initial morphological analysis as a
   time and cost effective screening test. Only samples that are
   morphologically not excluded as canid/felid furs, based on few selected
   microscopic features, are then submitted to DNA testing. The application
   of this protocol on seized furs reached 92\% identification of species.
   Our approach assists in identifying frauds and reinforcing the ban on
   dog and cat fur trade, allowing (1) rapid inexpensive recognition of
   fake furs, (2) exclusion of non-canid/non-felid furs through fast
   microscopic morphological screening, (3) overall cost reduction with
   lower number of samples to be submitted to DNA analysis, (4) analytical
   protocol to stand in court in case criminal sanctions are to be applied.},

Abstract = {In May 2017, high mortality of chickens and Muscovy ducks due to the
   H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) was reported in the
   Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo). In this study, we assessed the
   molecular, antigenic, and pathogenic features in poultry of the H5N8
   HPAIV from the 2017 Congolese outbreaks. Phylogenetic analysis of the
   eight viral gene segments revealed that all 12 DR Congo isolates
   clustered in clade 2.3.4.4B together with other H5N8 HPAIVs isolated in
   Africa and Eurasia, suggesting a possible common origin of these
   viruses. Antigenically, a slight difference was observed between the
   Congolese isolates and a representative virus from group C in the same
   clade. After intranasal inoculation with a representative DR Congo
   virus, high pathogenicity was observed in chickens and Muscovy ducks but
   not in Pekin ducks. Viral replication was higher in chickens than in
   Muscovy duck and Pekin duck organs; however, neurotropism was pronounced
   in Muscovy ducks. Our data confirmed the high pathogenicity of the DR
   Congo virus in chickens and Muscovy ducks, as observed in the field.
   National awareness and strengthening surveillance in the region are
   needed to better control HPAIVs.},

Title = {Evaluation of Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations for 154 Mycoplasma

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},

Month = {NOV 7},
Abstract = {Mycoplasma synoviae (MS) is a highly prevalent bacterial species in
   poultry causing disease and severe economic losses. Antibiotic treatment
   is one of the control strategies that can be applied to contain clinical
   outbreaks in MS-free flocks, especially because this bacterium can be
   transmitted in ovo. It becomes, then, very important for veterinarians
   to know the antibiotic susceptibility of the circulating strains in
   order to choose the most appropriate first-line antibiotic molecule as a
   proactive role in fighting antibiotic resistance. We evaluated the
   Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) of enrofloxacin,
   oxytetracycline, doxycycline, erythromycin, tylosin, tilmicosin,
   spiramycin, tiamulin, florfenicol and lincomycin for MS isolates
   collected between 2012 and 2017 in Italy. A total of 154 MS isolates
   from different poultry commercial categories (broiler, layer, and turkey
   sectors) was tested using commercial MIC plates. All MS isolates showed
   very high MIC values of erythromycin (MIC90 >= 8 mu g/mL) and
   enrofloxacin (MIC90 >= 16 mu g/mL). MIC values of doxycycline and
   oxytetracycline obtained were superimposable to each other with only a
   one-fold dilution difference. Discrepancies between MIC values of
   tylosin and tilmicosin were observed. Interestingly, seven isolates
   showed very high MIC values of lincomycin and tilmicosin, but not all of
   them showed very high MIC values of tylosin. Most of the MS isolates
   showed low MIC values of spiramycin, but seven strains showed a MIC >=
   16 mu g/mL. In the observation period, the frequency of the different
   MIC classes varied dependently on the tested antibiotic. Interestingly,
   tilmicosin MICs clearly showed a time-dependent progressive shift
   towards high-concentration classes, indicative of an on-going selection
   process among MS isolates. Until standardized breakpoints become
   available to facilitate data interpretation, it will be fundamental to
   continue studying MIC value fluctuations in the meantime in order to
   create a significant database that would facilitate veterinarians in
   selecting the proper drug for treating this impactful Mycoplasma.},

Title = {Whole blood transcriptome analysis in ewes fed with hemp seed
   supplemented diet},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {NOV 7},
Abstract = {The hemp plant (Cannabis sativa L.) has a long tradition of being used
   for many different purposes such as industry, medicine and nutrition. In
   particular, because hemp seed (HS) is rich in oil protein and
   considerable amounts of dietary fiber, vitamins and minerals that are
   particularly suitable also for animal nutrition. Different studies have
   evaluated HS on qualitative and quantitative properties of livestock
   products but as of today, nobody has investigated the molecular pathway
   behind HS supplementation in farm animals. Thus, in this study, we will
   report the first RNA sequencing of the whole-blood transcriptome of ewes
   fed either with a controlled diet (CTR, n = 5) or with a diet
   supplemented with 5\% of hemp seed (HSG, n = 5). Applying a false
   discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 and a log(2)FC either higher than 0.5 or
   lower than -0.5, we identified 314 differentially regulated genes in the
   HS-supplemented group compared to the CTR group. Several genes encoding
   for different subunits belonging to the complex I, II, III, IV and
   ATP-synthase were up-regulated making oxidative phosphorylation (FDR:
   3.05e-19) and thermogenesis (FDR: 2.17e-16) the highest up-regulated
   pathways in our study. Moreover, we found up-regulation in different
   genes involved in lactose biosyntheses such as GALK1 and PGM1 and, as a
   result, we observed a statistically higher lactose percentage in the HSG
   group (p < 0.05). These results indicate that HS supplementation
   positively affects the energy production pathway in lactating ewes
   conferring them also more resistance to adverse climatic conditions such
   as low temperature. Finally, the higher milk lactose content makes the
   derived dairy products more profitable.},

Abstract = {Background Aedes koreicus was detected in northern Italy for the first
   time in 2011, and it is now well established in several areas as a new
   invasive mosquito species. Data regarding the influence of temperature
   on mosquito survival and development are not available yet for this
   species. Methods We experimentally investigated the influence of
   different constant rearing temperatures (between 4 and 33 degrees C) on
   the survival rates and developmental times of different life stages of
   Ae. koreicus under laboratory conditions. The resulting data were
   subsequently used to inform a mathematical model reproducing the Ae.
   koreicus life-cycle calibrated to counts of adult females captured in
   the field in the autonomous province of Trento (northern Italy) between
   2016 and 2018. Results We found that temperatures above 28 degrees C are
   not optimal for the survival of pupae and adults, whereas temperate
   conditions of 23-28 degrees C seem to be very favorable, explaining the
   recent success of Ae. koreicus at establishing into new specific areas.
   Our results indicate that Ae. koreicus is less adapted to local climatic
   conditions compared to Ae. albopictus, another invasive species which
   has been invading the area for the last three decades. Warmer seasons,
   which are more likely to occur in the future because of climate change,
   might extend the breeding time and therefore increase the abundance of
   Ae. koreicus in the study region. Conclusions Our findings provide, to
   our knowledge, the first evidence on how temperature influences the
   bionomics and dynamics of Ae. koreicus and highlight the need for

Title = {Molecular epidemiology of canine parvovirus type 2 in Italy from 1994 to
   2017: recurrence of the CPV-2b variant},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 4},
Abstract = {Background Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) is the most important
   enteric virus infecting canids. It is a rapidly evolving virus; after
   its emergence in the 1970s, new antigenic variants (called CPV-2a, 2b
   and 2c) emerged and replaced the original antigenic type. The three
   antigenic variants are globally distributed with different frequencies
   and levels of genetic variability. This study focused on VP2 gene
   sequence analysis and the phylodynamics of CPV-2 which were detected in
   123 dogs showing clinical signs of gastroenteritis collected in Italy
   from 1994 to 2017. Results For the most part, the sick dogs were young,
   and a third of them (32.5\%) had been vaccinated. No statistical
   association was found between the CPV-2 antigenic variants, and sex,
   age, breed and vaccination status. Sequence analysis showed that all
   three antigenic types circulated in Italy; the CPV-2a type was the
   prominent genotype, followed by CPV-2c and CPV-2b, with notable
   differences regarding regional bases and significant fluctuations over
   time. Nucleotide sequence data showed high genetic heterogeneity with 67
   nucleotide sequence types (ntSTs) identified, corresponding to 21 amino
   acid sequence types (aaSTs). The aaSTs and ntSTs obtained were
   distributed differently among the three CPV-2 antigenic variants: CPV-2a
   grouped 12/21 (57.1\%) aaSTs and 41/67 (61.2\%) ntSTs; CPV-2b grouped
   5/21 (23.8\%) aaSTs and 6/67 (8.9\%) ntSTs, and CPV-2c grouped 4/21
   (19.1\%) aaSTs and 20/67 (29.9\%) ntSTs. Canine parvovirus 2a was
   characterised by the highest genetic variability while CPV-2c was
   characterised by notable stability with a predominant amino acid profile
   during the entire sampling time. Canine parvovirus 2b re-emerged in
   recent years, showing a new and distinctive amino acid profile of the
   VP2 protein. Conclusions The findings of the present study provided new
   insights regarding the phylodynamics and evolution of CPV-2 in Italy,
   pointing out notable differences at the local level in the distribution
   of the CPV-2 variants and the selection of genetic subtypes. The
   evolution of CPV-2 has raised questions regarding the efficacy of
   vaccination; therefore, continuous monitoring regarding the evolution
   and spread of new CPV-2 variants should be a key aim of ongoing
   research.},

Title = {Efficacy of a moxidectin/imidacloprid spot-on formulation (Advocate (R))
   for the treatment of Troglostrongylus brevior in naturally infected cats
   in a field study in Greece},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},

Abstract = {Background Troglostrongylus brevior is a lungworm of wild felids that
   recently has been recognized as agent of severe respiratory disease in
   domestic cats in Mediterranean and Balkan countries. Nevertheless, the
   information on treatment options for feline troglostrongylosis is still
   poor. The aim of this pilot field trial was to evaluate the efficacy of
   the spot-on formulation containing 1\% w/v moxidectin and 10\% w/v
   imidacloprid (Advocate (R) spot-on solution for cats, Bayer Animal
   Health GmbH) in the treatment of T. brevior infection in naturally
   infected cats in Greece. Methods The trial was a negative control,
   multicentre, clinical efficacy study conducted according to the
   standards of Good Scientific Practice (GSP). Sixteen cats in two study
   sites, naturally infected with T. brevior, were allocated to an
   untreated control group (G1, n = 8) or a treatment group (G2, n = 8),
   according to a randomization list. Animals assigned to G2 were treated
   with Advocate (R) for cats on days 0 and 28 at the recommended dose rate
   and animals assigned to G1 received a rescue treatment with the same
   product on days 56 and 84. Efficacy was assessed on days 28 and 56 in G2
   and on days 84 and 112 in G1 by faecal larval counts. The primary
   efficacy criterion was the absence of T. brevior first-stage larvae (L1)
   following treatment. Other efficacy parameters were the quantitative
   comparison of L1 presence before (baseline) and after one or two
   treatments in both groups. Results All G2 cats were negative for T.
   brevior L1 at the first post-treatment evaluation (100\% efficacy) while
   G1 cats were persistently shedding L1. The difference of the mean number
   of L1 per gram between G2 and G1 was statistically significant (P <
   0.001). All G1 cats were negative (100\% efficacy) for T. brevior L1 at
   the first post-rescue-treatment evaluation. Therefore, treatment
   efficacy at study completion was 100\% in both groups in terms of
   stopping the L1 shedding in the faeces of the animals. No adverse
   effects were observed during the study. Conclusions These results
   indicate that Advocate (R) spot-on solution for cats represents an
   option for treating cats naturally infected with T. brevior.},

Abstract = {Background Serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) reference intervals (RIs)
   have been evaluated in different horses, but no specific values are
   shown for equine breeds as previously described in other species (dogs,
   cats), and no studies have been performed on SPE in draft horses.
   Objectives This study aimed to determine RIs for SPE in heavy draft
   horses (Italian Heavy Draft Horse-IHDH) living in central Italy. A
   comparison between different physiologic states (pregnancy and no
   pregnancy) and ages (foals and adults) was executed. Materials and
   Methods Blood samples were collected from 215 apparently healthy horses
   (mares, stallions, and foals). SPE (total proteins, albumin, alpha 1-,
   alpha 2-, beta 1-, beta 2-, and gamma-fractions, A/G) was evaluated in
   the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the University of Perugia. RIs were
   determined using well-described, modern analytical and statistical
   methods. The normality of distributions was assessed using the
   Anderson-Darling test. Differences between subgroups were evaluated
   using the Mann-Whitney U test. A P < .05 was considered statistically
   significant for all analyses. Results Our results showed that IHDHs had
   increases in TPs and the alpha 2-, beta 1-, beta 2-, and
   gamma-fractions, and decreases in albumin, alpha 1-globulins, and A/G
   ratios compared with the data reported in other horses. We also found
   that foals had significantly higher alpha 1-globulins and significantly
   lower albumin concentrations, and A/G ratios compared with those of the
   adult horses. Conclusions In the present study, SPE RIs using agarose
   gels have been determined for the first time in a large number of draft
   horses (represented by IHDH). The obtained results provide a basis for
   the further investigation of equine breeds with natural breeding, and
   the impact of age and physiologic states on SPE.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Bats are particularly suited as bioindicators of trace element pollution
   due to their longevity and their position in the trophic chain. In this
   study, the concentrations of ten non-essential trace elements (Al, As,
   Ba, Cd, Hg, Pb, Sb, Sr, Th, TI) were determined in the tissues (whole
   body, skin-fur, skinned body, liver, kidney and bone) of lactant
   Tadarida teniotis from a nursery colony in Rome. A large number of bats
   from this nursery died before fledging and had bone deformities and
   fractures. The concentrations of nonessential trace elements in bone and
   whole body were also analysed in adult specimens of Miniopterus
   schreibersii from a colony located in a natural park in Northern Italy.
   In lactant T. teniotis, the Pb concentration decreased in the following
   order: bone>liver>skinned body>whole body>skin-fur>kidney, and exceeded
   the toxic threshold associated with negative effects reported for
   different mammalian species. The levels of the other non-essential trace
   elements were within a range indicative of low environmental
   contamination in both species. Significant interspecies differences (P <
   0.05) were observed for concentrations of Pb and Ba, higher in the bones
   of T. teniotis, and of Cd, Hg and Sr, higher in the bones of M.
   schreibersii. In lactant T teniotis, the different sources of Pb
   exposure, through inhalation and/or food, may represent a potential
   threat to the colony of this synanthropic European bat. (C) 2019

   herbal ingredients (Camellia sinensis, Ginkgo biloba, Glycine max,
   Silybum marianum, Vaccinium myrtillus), almonds, hazelnuts, peanuts,
   pistachios, walnuts and fresh blueberries, papaya and mango, were
   analyzed by both stimulated luminescence methods. To verify the
   reliability of the methods in detecting the treatment over time, the
   analyses were replicated after irradiation within the product shelf
   life. The PSL screening method allowed to correctly identify
   blueberries, nuts and raw materials of PFS but failed with dried herbal
   extracts, mango and papaya, due to their low content of silicates. To
   validate the procedure elaborated during the preliminary study, blind
   tests, involving several national laboratories of the official control,
   were organized. The tests confirmed the limits in detecting dried
   extracts, mango and papaya by PSL technique. TL method resulted suitable

Abstract = {Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) is one of the most important nosocomial
   pathogens worldwide, able to cause multiorgan infections and hospital
   outbreaks. One of the most widely disseminated lineage of Kp is the
   clonal group 258 (CG258), which includes the highly resistant
   ``high-risk{''} sequence types ST258 and ST11. Genomic investigations
   revealed that very large recombination events have occurred during the
   emergence of Kp lineages. A striking example is provided by ST258, which
   has under gone a recombination event that replaced over 1 Mb of the
   genome with DNA from an unrelated Kp donor. Although several examples of
   this phenomenon have been documented in Kp and other bacterial species,
   the significance of these very large recombination events for the
   emergence of either hypervirulent or resistant clones remains unclear.
   Here, we present an analysis of 834 Kp genomes that provides data on the
   frequency of these very large recombination events (defined as those
   involving > 100 kb), their distribution within the genome, and the
   dynamics of gene flow within the Kp population. We note that very large
   recombination events occur frequently, and in multiple lineages, and
   that the majority of recombinational exchanges are clustered within two
   overlapping genomic regions, which have been involved by recombination
   events with different frequencies. Our results also indicate that
   certain lineages are more likely to act as donors to CG258. Furthermore,
   comparison of gene content in CG258 and non-CG258 strains agrees with
   this pattern, suggesting that the success of a large recombination
   depends on gene composition in the exchanged genomic portion.},

Title = {A The Effects of Decreasing Dietary Crude Protein on the Growth
   Performance, Feed Efficiency and Meat Quality of Finishing Charolais
   Bulls},

Abstract = {Simple Summary: Livestock production emerges as one of the main
   contributors of ammonia emissions; in fact, as the literature reports,
   the excess of nitrogen fed in form of feed protein is excreted in manure
   and converted into ammonia. Defining beef cattle protein requirements,
   specifically for each breed and farming system, is fundamental to
   ensuring an adequate supply of protein, while avoiding N losses due to
   an over-estimation of needs. In this study, we compared two different
   levels of protein in beef cattle diets to better understand the exact
   amount that would meet the animals' requirements, while avoiding waste.
   Results showed that, on one hand, the decrease of protein in the diet
   could actually compromise animals' daily weight gains, but on the other
   hand, it did not reduce the income of the farmer, because the diet was
   cheaper, and improved the efficiency in the use of the digestible
   protein for growth.
   Abstract: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of decreasing dietary
   crude protein (CP) on the performance of finishing Charolais bulls in
   the Italian rearing system. Animals were fed two diets, differing only
   in the CP level (low protein (LP), 13.5\% CP versus control (CON),
   15.0\% CP). Dry matter (DM) intake (DMI) and animals' weights were
   recorded to obtain average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion rate
   (FCR). Feed and fecal samples were collected to evaluate digestibility
   of diet components. Daily cost of the ration (DRC), feed cost per kg of
   daily weight gain (CDG) and daily gross margin (DGM) were calculated to
   analyze the possible benefits of decreasing the protein level. Meat
   quality analyses were also conducted. Higher DMI (10.6 versus 10 kg/d; p
   < 0.05) and ADG (1.47 versus 1.36 kg/d; p < 0.05) were observed for CON.
   No differences in FCR or digestibility were found. Even if the DRC was
   lower (p < 0.05) for the LP diet (2.26 versus 1.97 Euro; CON versus LP),
   no difference was reported for CDG and DGM. Meat lightness and redness
   were significantly lower and higher in the LP, respectively. To
   conclude, the CP requirement in these rearing conditions appeared to be
   higher than 13.5\%.},

Abstract = {The zoonotic protozoan parasites Toxoplasma gondii, Cryptosporidium
   parvum and Giardia duodenalis have been recorded worldwide in
   economically important edible shellfish, and are thus likely to
   represent a significant public health risk. Therefore, an innovative,
   user-friendly diagnostic tool is required in order to improve food
   safety control. The Q3 system is a miniaturized platform whose
   efficiency and applicability were investigated and compared with results
   obtained using standard Real-Time PCR. Tanks of saltwater containing
   acclimated Mytilus galloprovincialis, Ruditapes philippinarum and Ostrea
   edulis specimens were spiked with purified Cryptosporidium, Giardia and
   Toxoplasma cysts/oocysts at different concentrations (i.e., 10(3), 10(4)
   and 10(5)). We then collected 30 specimens for each shellfish species
   from each group at 24 h and 72 h post-contamination. After DNA
   extraction, we tested all samples by Real-Time-PCR and Q3, and evaluated
   the sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, repeatability and
   concordance between the two systems. Concordance between Real-Time-PCR
   and Q3 was very good (p < 0.01), especially for Toxoplasma in M.
   galloprovincialis at both 24 h and 72 h after contamination, and in O.
   edulis at 72 h. The ability of Q3 to detect all the investigated
   pathogens was similar to that of Real-Time-PCR, and Q3 was efficient in
   detecting Toxoplasma in both M. galloprovincialis and O. edulis. This is
   the first study concerning the use of lab-on-chip technology in a food
   matrix, and in edible marine mollusks in particular.},

Abstract = {Behavioral and physiological processes have an innate 24-h cycle driven
   by the circadian master clock, which uses clock genes to generate
   rhythmicity and distribute temporal signals. Elucidating the blood gene
   expression in relation to the better known circadian rhythms in horses
   may contribute to improve the knowledge on the peripheral circadian
   rhythm control in this species. To do that, seven clinically healthy
   Italian saddle female horses were housed in individual boxes under
   natural photoperiod and environmental conditions. In each horse,
   locomotor activity was recorded continuously; blood samples and rectal
   temperature were recorded every 4 hours over a 48-hour period. To
   investigate the peripheral clock in horses, quantitative real-time RT
   polymerase chain reaction assays were designed to detected clock gene
   levels (Per 1, Per 2, and Cry 1) from blood samples. Blood cortisol
   serum level was also measured. Our results showed a daily expression of
   Per 1, Per 2, and Cry 1 in peripheral blood, associated with the daily
   rhythm of locomotor activity, rectal temperature and cortisol. In
   particular, a similar acrophase was observed for locomotor activity and
   Per 1; and for rectal temperature and Per 2. Rectal temperature and Per
   2 also showed the same percentage of robustness of rhythm. We suggest
   the existence of a linkage between the peripheral clock genes Per 1 and
   Per 2 with locomotor activity and rectal temperature, although more
   studies are necessary to establish the exact mechanism of the peripheral
   clock. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   A risk or a benefit for consumers?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INORGANIC BIOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {200},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {We investigate the effects of antimicrobial (sodium citrate tribasic,
   E331) and antioxidant (ascorbic acid, E300 and sodium ascorbate, E301)
   additives on the meat drip from defrosted yellowfin tuna fish loins
   obtained from the local market and horse heart myoglobin. The effects
   have been followed by electronic absorption, its second derivative
   spectra, and resonance Raman spectroscopies. Upon addition of the
   additives, a final form is reached after about 24 h. It is characterized
   by a 4 nm red-shifted Soret band compared to that typical of the oxy
   species (418 nm) but with similar Q bands. Resonance Raman experiments
   carried out in O-16(2) and O-18(2) allowed us to identify the presence
   of the native oxy form coexisting with a second oxygen bound species,
   characterized by a nu(Fe-O-2) stretching frequency upshifted 7 cm(-1)
   compared to the native oxy form and with a greater (33 cm(-1)) isotopic
   shift in O-18(2). These data suggest the presence of a highly bent
   ligand conformation. The new species induced by the addition of the
   additives imparts a red colour to the tuna fish meat, a characteristic
   that is of some concern. In fact, the presence of the new red form can
   mask the aging of the product that, consequently, might contain
   histamine. Furthermore, the electronic absorption spectrum is very
   similar to that of the tuna fish myoglobin carbon monoxide complex,
   which has important regulatory consequences. Carbon monoxide treatment
   of tuna is banned in the EU for masking the effects of aging on the
   appearance of meats.},

   improvement of the pathways involved in immune response and oxidative
   stress and undoubted positive repercussions on animal health.
   Abstract: The effects of iodine supplementation on the
   whole-transcriptome of dairy cow using RNA sequencing has been
   investigated in this study. Iodine did not influence the milk
   composition, while an improvement was observed in the immune response as
   well as in the quality of dairy product. Indeed, the iodine intake
   specifically influenced the expression of 525 genes and the pathway
   analysis demonstrated that the most affected among them were related to
   immune response and oxidative stress. As a consequence, we indirectly
   showed a better response to bacterial infection because of the reduction
   of somatic cell counts; furthermore, an improvement of dairy product
   quality was observed since lipid oxidation reduced in fresh cheese. Such
   findings, together with the higher milk iodine content, clearly
   demonstrated that iodine supplementation in dairy cow could represent a
   beneficial practice to preserve animal health and to improve the
   nutraceutical properties of milk and its derived products.},

Journal = {VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {238},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Mycoplasma bovis is an important respiratory pathogen of cattle across
   Europe and is included in the MycoPath pan-European antimicrobial
   susceptibility monitoring programme. M. bovis strains (232) were
   isolated from cattle, not recently treated with antimicrobials, at
   diverse geographical locations in France, Great Britain, Hungary, Italy
   and Spain during 2014 to 2016. Only one isolate per farm and per
   outbreak was retained. For each isolate, the MICs of ten antimicrobials
   were determined in a central laboratory using a broth microdilution
   method with modified Eaton's medium and incubation at 35 degrees C +/- 1
   degrees C for 24 +/- 6 h. MIC50/MIC90 (mg/L) values for the 232 strains
   were: danofloxacin 0.25/1; enrofloxacin 0.5/8; marbofloxacin 1/4;
   gami-thromycin > 64/ > 64; spiramycin 8/16; tilmicosin > 64/ > 64;
   tulathromycin > 64/ > 64; tylosin 64/ > 64; florfenicol 4/8;
   oxytetracycline 8/32. Minor between-country differences in the MIC90
   values were observed for the fluoroquinolones, spiramycin and
   oxytetracycline, whilst the MIC values for the other compounds were
   similar. Spain and Italy had the higher MIC90 values for the
   fluoroquinolones. Compared with the 2010-2012 study (156 isolates)
   results are similar, with an overall MIC50 increase of at most one
   doubling dilution for enrofloxacin, spiramycin, tylosin, florfenicol and
   oxytetracycline. In contrast, the MIC90 value for oxytetracycline
   decreased from > 64 to 32 mg/L. Standardized laboratory methods and
   interpretive criteria for MIC testing of veterinary mycoplasmas are
   clearly needed; there are currently no clinical breakpoints available to
   facilitate data interpretation and correlation of MICs with in vivo
   efficacy.},

Title = {Insight into an outbreak of Salmonella Choleraesuis var. Kunzendorf in
   wild boars},
Journal = {VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {238},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {An unusual mortality of wild boars occurred in Italy from 2012 to 2015
   due to Salmonella Choleraesuis infection.
   In order to confirm the occurrence of an outbreak of S. Choleraesuis in
   wild boars and to epidemically characterise the unique S. Choleraesuis
   biovar, a collection of isolates belonging to wild boars was
   investigated from the phenotypic, molecular and genomic points of view
   (PFGE and WGS). Moreover, the possibility of transmission to domestic
   pigs and humans, temporally and geographically close to the wild boar
   epidemic, was tested by also including in the panel isolates from
   infected domestic pigs and from one human case of infection.
   Wild boar isolates displayed a high genetic correlation, thus suggesting
   they are part of the same outbreak, with a common invasiveness
   potential. Conversely, no correlation between pig isolates and those
   from the other sources (wild boars and human) was found. However, the
   phylogenetic and PFGE analyses suggest a high degree of similarity
   between the human and the investigated wild boar outbreak isolates,
   implying the potential for the spread of Salmonella Choleraesuis among
   these species.},

Title = {Transfer of passive immunity in dairy calves: the effectiveness of
   providing a supplementary colostrum meal in addition to nursing from the
   dam},

Abstract = {Failed transfer of passive immunity (FTPI) in dairy calves - which is
   often due to the low amount of colostrum provided within a few hours
   after birth - remains a crucial issue. Enabling dairy calves to nurse
   colostrum from their dams could be useful in increasing intake and thus
   avoiding FTPI, but further potential effects on the health and welfare
   of both calves and dams should also be considered. In this study, 107
   calf-dam pairs from two Italian dairy farms were alternately assigned to
   one of the following colostrum provision methods (CPMs): `hand-fed
   method' (HFM) - the calf was separated from the dam immediately after
   birth and colostrum was provided by nipple-bottle (n = 50); `nursing
   method' (NM) - the calf nursed colostrum from the dam for the first 12 h
   of life without farmer assistance (n = 30); and `mixed method' (MM) -
   the nursing calf received a supplementary colostrum meal by
   nipple-bottle (n = 27). Serum of calves (1 to 5 days of age) and samples
   of their first colostrum meal were analysed by electrophoresis to assess
   immunoglobulin (Ig) concentration. Additionally, behavioural indicators
   of separation distress (calf and dam vocalisations; calf refusal of the
   first meal after separation; undesirable dam behaviour at milking) in
   the following 24 h were recorded as binary variables (Yes/No), and the
   health status of calves (disease occurrence and mortality) and dams
   (postpartum disorders and mastitis occurrence) were monitored for the
   first 3 months of life and 7 days after parturition, respectively. The
   lowest FTPI occurrence (calf serum Ig concentration <10.0 g/l) was found
   in the MM (11.1\%) and the HFM (22.0\%) compared with the NM (60.0\%)
   (P<0.05), and the highest percentage of calves with optimal transfer of
   passive immunity (serum Ig concentration >= 16.0 g/l) was observed in
   the MM (55.6\%). The lowest calf-dam separation distress was observed in
   the HFM (P<0.05). The highest calf disease occurrence was recorded in
   the HFM (64.0\%) and the lowest in the NM (33.3\%), with an intermediate
   value for the MM (44.4\%) (P<0.05). No effect of the CPM was observed on
   dam health or calf mortality (P>0.05). The results of this study
   indicated that providing calves with a supplementary colostrum meal in
   addition to nursing from the dam (MM) is truly effective in maximizing
   passive immunity transfer. Anyway, specific strategies should be studied
   to minimise calf-dam separation distress.},

Abstract = {In order to characterize the most commonly detected Salmonella
   serotypes, we tested 124 isolates of S. Typhimurium and 89 isolates of
   the monophasic variant of S. Typhimurium (S. 1,4, {[}5],12:i:-) for
   their antimicrobial susceptibility by means of the Kirby-Bauer
   disk-diffusion method, and for the detection of 19 genes (four Phage
   Markers (g13, Sieb, eat, g8), ten prophage-related virulence genes
   (gipA, gtgB, nanH, gogB, grvA, sopE, sspH1, sspH2, sodC1, gtgE), and
   five plasmid-borne virulence genes (spvC, pefA, mig5, rcK, srgA)) by
   means of PCR-based assays. A total of 213 strains were analyzed from,
   humans (n = 122), animals (n = 25), food (n = 46), and irrigation water
   (n = 20). S. Typhimurium isolates showed higher variability, in both
   their resistance profiles and molecular typing, than S. 1,4,
   {[}5],12:i:-. Strains from irrigation water displayed significantly
   higher susceptibility to antibiotics than those from the other sources.
   Resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamide, and tetracycline
   was the most commonly detected resistance profile (R-type), being in
   serovar S. 1,4, {[}5],12:i:-, frequently associated to resistance to
   other antimicrobials. Significant differences in genetic profiles in the
   two abovementioned Salmonella serotypes were found. None of the
   plasmid-borne virulence genes investigated were detected in S. 1,4,
   {[}5],12:i:- isolates, while those genes, characterized 37.9\% of the S.
   Typhimurium strains. Differences in the prevalence of some molecular
   targets between the two Salmonella serotypes deserve further study.
   Importantly, the grvA gene was found exclusively in S. Typhimurium
   strains, whereas sopE, sodC, gtgB, and gipA were mainly detected, with a
   statistically significant difference, in S. 1,4, {[}5],12:i:- isolates.},

Title = {Comparison of PCR-RFLP, API (R) 20 Strep and MALDI-TOF MS for

Abstract = {In this study, a bank of 195 Streptococcus isolates collected in
   Sardinia (Italy) from sheep and goat milk samples was analysed. The
   purpose of this research was to compare the accuracy of different
   methods of identifying Streptococcus at the species level: API (R) 20
   Strep, PCR-RFLP and MALDI-TOF MS. For PCR-RFLP analysis, the
   housekeeping gap gene was used as target gene. After alignment of
   nucleotide sequences of different Streptococcus species, a primer set
   was designed to amplify a 945-bp DNA fragment. Amplicons of gap gene
   were submitted to restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis with
   the enzyme AluI. When PCR-RFLP patterns were different from those of
   their reference strains, gap gene products were sequenced for definitive
   identification. Most of the isolates displayed the same PCR-RFLP profile
   of Streptococcus uberis type strain (124, corresponding to 63.6\%),
   followed by S. dysgalactiae (18, corresponding to 9.2\%) and S. suis
   (14, corresponding to 7.2\%). Overall, in comparison with PCR-RFLP and
   sequence analysis results, 161 over 195 Streptococcus isolates were
   identified to the same species levels by means API (R) 20 Strep (82.6\%
   agreement, CI95 = 77.2-87.9) versus 166/195 (85.1\% agreement, CI95 =
   80.1-90.1) using MALDI-TOF. In conclusion, the PCR-RFLP is the most
   accurate and reproducible method for the identification of streptococci
   collected from milk samples, although high cost and technical difficulty
   hinder its usage in routine diagnosis. In our study, the accuracy of
   MALDI-TOF MS in detecting streptococci at the species level has not been
   perfect; however we believe that MALDI-TOF has the advantage in terms of
   its rapidity, reliability and low cost.},

Title = {Deer keds on wild ungulates in northern Italy, with a taxonomic key for

Abstract = {Deer keds (Lipoptena spp.) are blood-sucking ectoparasites of domestic
   and wild animals, and also accidentally of humans. In Europe, five
   Lipoptena spp. have been recorded, although the lack of specific
   taxonomic keys has often led to mistaken identification or to missing
   data. The present study aimed to develop an identification key of the
   European species and also to identify Lipoptena spp. found on wild
   ungulates in northern Italy. In total, 390 hippoboscids were collected
   from Rupicapra rupicapra, Capreolus capreolus, Cervus elaphus and Ovis
   aries musimon in an Alpine area of Italy. After morphological
   identification, 140 specimens were subjected to phylogenetic analysis
   based on mitochondrial (CO1) and nuclear (CAD) gene sequences. Despite
   the expected presence of slight morphological variations, all specimens
   examined were identified both microscopically and molecularly as
   Lipoptena cervi (100\% identity for both CO1 and CAD genes). The massive
   increase in wild ungulate populations can favour the possibility of
   detecting other species of Lipoptena. The identification keys proposed
   in the present study may help with monitoring the presence of Lipoptena
   species, particularly in European countries where this ectoparasite is
   neglected and for which various data (from diffusion to control methods)
   are still missing.},

Abstract = {A simple method based on direct sampling analysis, coupled with a time
   of flight mass spectrometer, was developed to discriminate between wild
   and farmed sea bream on the basis of the docosahexaenoic and arachidonic
   fatty acid ratio. Good precision in repeatability and reproducibility
   (relative standard deviation < 15\%) was obtained. The fatty acid ratios
   of the two types of fish were statistically significant (Student's t <
   0.001). The use of a simple, rapid, and cost-effective tool could aid in
   the detection of commercial fish fraud, increase the number of
   controlled samples, and strengthen control along the entire commercial
   chain.
   HIGHLIGHTS
   The sale of farmed fish as wild fish is a common fraudulent practice.
   A rapid method was validated to discriminate between wild and farmed sea
   bream.
   The DHA/AA ratio between fatty acids allows differentiation of farmed
   from wild sea bream.},

Title = {Free-Ranging Pig and Wild Boar Interactions in an Endemic Area of
   African Swine Fever},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {OCT 30},
Abstract = {African swine fever virus (ASFV) is spreading throughout Eurasia and
   there is no vaccine nor treatment available, so the control is based on
   the implementation of strict sanitary measures. These measures include
   depopulation of infected and in-contact animals and export restrictions,
   which can lead to important economic losses, making currently African
   swine fever (ASF) the greatest threat to the global swine industry. ASF
   has been endemic on the island of Sardinia since 1978, the longest
   persistence of anywhere in Eurasia. In Sardinia, eradication programs
   have failed, in large part due to the lack of farm professionalism, the
   high density of wild boar and the presence of non-registered domestic
   pigs (free-ranging pigs). In order to clarify how the virus is
   transmitted from domestic to wild swine, we examined the interaction
   between free-ranging pigs and wild boar in an ASF-endemic area of
   Sardinia. To this end, a field study was carried out on direct and
   indirect interactions, using monitoring by camera trapping in different
   areas and risk points. Critical time windows (CTWs) for the virus to
   survive in the environment (long window) and remain infectious (short
   window) were estimated, and based on these, the number of indirect
   interactions were determined. Free-ranging pigs indirectly interacted
   often with wild boar (long window = 6.47 interactions/day, short window
   = 1.31 interactions/day) and these interactions (long window) were
   mainly at water sources. They also directly interacted 0.37 times per
   day, especially between 14:00 and 21:00 h, which is much higher than for
   other interspecific interactions observed in Mediterranean scenarios.
   The highly frequent interactions at this interspecific interface may
   help explain the more than four-decade-long endemicity of ASF on the
   island. Supporting that free-ranging pigs can act as a bridge to
   transmit ASFV between wild boar and registered domestic pigs. This study
   contributes broadly to improving the knowledge on the estimation of
   frequencies of direct and indirect interactions between wild and
   free-ranging domestic swine. As well as supporting the importance of the
   analysis of interspecific interactions in shared infectious diseases,
   especially for guiding disease management. Finally, this work
   illustrates the power of the camera-trapping method for analyzing
   interspecific interfaces.},

Abstract = {Objective. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxic potential
   of a type of endodontic pin on L929 cell line according to the UNI EN
   ISO 10993/2009 rule. Methods. L929 cells were used for the assays;
   extracts were prepared from three different-diameter endodontic pins,
   made of epoxy resin and fiberglass matrix and from Reference Materials
   (ZDEC, ZDBC, and HDP films). MTS assay was performed after 24h, 48h, and
   72h of exposure of L929 cells to pin and Reference Material extracts,
   5\% phenol solution, and control reagent. Cells cultured with different
   media containing extracts were monitored for up to 72h and stained with
   haematoxylin/eosin. Results. Pins of different diameters had no
   cytotoxic effects on L929 cells at 24h, 48h, and 72h (all values >70\%).
   Cells cultured in medium containing pin extracts grew without any
   differences compared to the control cells. Conclusion. The endodontic
   pins tested showed no cytotoxic effects and did not induce changes in
   morphology for up to 72h.},

Title = {Co-inertia multivariate approach for the evaluation of anthropogenic
   impact on two commercial fish along Tyrrhenian coasts},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {182},
Month = {OCT 30},
Abstract = {Aliphatic hydrocarbon levels were determined by the GC/MS technique in
   fish livers of Engraulis encrasicolus (Ee) and Trachurus trachurus (Tt),
   collected from a particular area of the Mediterranean Sea, called GSA
   10, which is located exactly in Tyrrhenian Sea between Campania coast
   and North Sicily coast. The aim was to evaluate their potential use as
   specific bioindicators towards this class of contaminants. Both Tt and
   Ee are considered to be pollution monitoring bioindicators, due to their
   dominance in marine communities and economic fishing interest. Ee showed
   a higher tendency to bioaccumulate TAHs, due to the lower quantity of
   fatty acids in liver tissues with respect to Tt. The area under study
   has been characterised a) chemically with the acquisition of
   temperature, oxygen and salinity profiles along the water column, and b)
   ecologically with the determination of amino acid contents in fish eyes,
   in order to gain information on the adaptation to environmental changes.
   Moreover, specific activities of two hydrolytic enzymes, such as
   alkaline phosphatase and peroxidase in fish epidermal mucus, together
   with lactate in blood plasma and cortisol levels, have been investigated
   for the first time, in order to obtain insights into the effects of
   hydrocarbons on animal welfare. A multiple co-inertia analysis was also
   applied to chemical and environmental parameters, in order to explore
   any possible correlation between different variables. The multivariate
   approach showed a clear spatial distribution between environmental and
   chemical variables in Ee, whilst there was an absence of a spatial trend
   in Tt. Moreover, the chemometric analysis showed a very high correlation
   between amino acid profiles and environmental variables for both
   species, confirming the possibility of being used as ecological welfare
   indices for short-term environmental variations.},

Abstract = {Toxicity related to consumption of Cistus sp. pl. has been described in
   ruminants in some countries. This report describes the clinical and
   pathological findings of Cistus salviifolius toxicosis in 3 beef cattle
   herds located in 2 different areas of Sicily, Italy. Outbreaks were
   observed after grazing in poor winter pasture where C. salviifolius was
   abundant. Mean morbidity and mortality were 29\% and 21\%, respectively.
   Most of the affected animals (6 to 36 months old) showed anorexia,
   weight loss, and pollakiuria culminating in recumbency and death.
   Occasionally, abortion and neurological signs were observed. In animals
   with acute signs, there was a moderate decrease of sodium and chloride
   concentrations in serum. Animals with chronic signs showed an increase
   of serum urea, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), aspartate transaminase
   (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and phosphorus and a decrease in
   total serum protein, calcium, chloride, and magnesium concentrations.
   Moderate anemia and slight neutropenia, lymphocytosis, and eosinophilia
   were detected in all groups. At necropsy, the main lesion was severe
   distention of the urinary bladder with turbid hemorrhagic urine and
   crystalluria. Histologically, chronic cystitis, interstitial nephritis,
   eosinophilic enteritis, and nonsuppurative necrotizing hepatitis were
   observed. To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. salviifolius
   toxicosis in cattle in Italy.},

Abstract = {Among mechanisms and molecules presumably involved in the
   carcinogenicity induced by meat consumption, the N-nitrosamines (N-NAs)
   are a class of compounds characteristic of processed meats. In this
   work, an analytical method for the determination of ten N-nitrosamines
   (N-nitrosomorpholine, N-nitrosomethylethylamine, N-nitrosopyrrolidine,
   N-nitrosodiethylamine, N-nitrosopiperidine, N-nitrosodipropylamine,
   N-nitrosodimethylaniline, N-nitrosodibutylamine, N-nitrosodiphenylamine
   and N-nitrosodibenzylamine) in fresh meats and meat products was
   developed, optimised and validated. The method is based on optimised
   sample purification by solid-phase extraction (anion exchange polymeric
   sorbent) and separation/detection by high-performance liquid
   chromatography coupled to UV diode array detection. The validation
   procedure allowed to ascertaining good analytical performances in terms
   of sensitivity, selectivity towards interfering compounds, accuracy and
   robustness. The values obtained for precision (range: 4.3-14.4\%) and
   recovery percentages (range: 80.8-95.1\%) were compared to reference
   values indicated in the Decision No. 657/2002/EC, resulting as
   compliant. The measurement uncertainty (lower than 14.6\%) was
   satisfactory for each N-NA as well.},

Abstract = {Ticks are vectors of a wide variety of human and animal pathogens as
   well as non-pathogenic microorganisms acting as endosymbionts and whose
   role in ticks is still little known. Symbionts such as Francisella-like
   endosymbionts (FLEs) are members of Francisellaceae family with unknown
   pathogenicity, detected in both hard and soft ticks. A total of 236
   ticks collected from several sites in Sardinia were screened for
   Francisella species by PCR using primers targeting a fragment of the 16S
   rRNA gene. DNA of Francisella was detected in 5.1\% (12/236) of the
   ticks tested. Sequencing results revealed that seven Rhipicephalus
   sanguineus s.l., three Hyalomma marginatum, one Hy. lusitanicum, and one
   Rh. bursa ticks exhibited DNA with 99-100\% similarity to
   Francisella-like endosymbionts isolated from different tick species all
   over the world. Further research is needed in order to better
   characterize FLE strains obtained in Sardinia and to better understand
   if their presence could be related to the infection with other zoonotic
   pathogens.},

Abstract = {Clostridium perfringens type G is one of the pathogens involved in
   enteric diseases in poultry. NetB, a pore-forming toxin, is considered
   the main virulence factor responsible for necrotic enteritis during C.
   perfringens infection. We carried out a field study involving 14 farms
   to evaluate the occurrence of netB-positive C. perfringens and the
   impact of infection in Italian poultry flocks. Environmental samples (n
   = 117) and 50 carcasses were screened by microbiologic and molecular
   methods. Microbiologic investigations yielded 82 C. perfringens
   isolates. DNA was extracted from all samples and screened for
   alpha-toxin and NetB encoding genes by real-time PCR. The C. perfringens
   alpha-toxin gene was detected in 151 of 167 extracts (90.4\%), and 31 of
   151 (20.5\%) were netB gene positive also. Sixteen isolates from a
   turkey flock with mild enteric disorders were also netB positive,
   demonstrating their occurrence not only in broiler but also in turkey
   flocks. A pulsed-field gel electrophoresis protocol was optimized to
   evaluate the diversity among isolates and revealed high genetic
   heterogeneity. The complete NetB toxin-coding gene of 2 C. perfringens
   isolates from turkey and broiler flocks were analyzed and showed very
   high relatedness with analogous sequences worldwide.},

Abstract = {Invasive species can encounter environments different from their source
   populations, which may trigger rapid adaptive changes after introduction
   (niche shift hypothesis). To test this hypothesis, we investigated
   whether postintroduction evolution is correlated with contrasting
   environmental conditions between the European invasive and source ranges
   in the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus. The comparison of
   environmental niches occupied in European and source population ranges
   revealed more than 96\% overlap between invasive and source niches,
   supporting niche conservatism. However, we found evidence for
   postintroduction genetic evolution by reanalyzing a published ddRADseq
   genomic dataset from 90 European invasive populations using
   genotype-environment association (GEA) methods and generalized
   dissimilarity modeling (GDM). Three loci, among which a putative
   heat-shock protein, exhibited significant allelic turnover along the
   gradient of winter precipitation that could be associated with ongoing
   range expansion. Wing morphometric traits weakly correlated with
   environmental gradients within Europe, but wing size differed between
   invasive and source populations located in different climatic areas.
   Niche similarities between source and invasive ranges might have
   facilitated the establishment of populations. Nonetheless, we found
   evidence for environmental-induced adaptive changes after introduction.
   The ability to rapidly evolve observed in invasive populations (genetic
   shift) together with a large proportion of unfilled potential suitable
   areas (80\%) pave the way to further spread of Ae. albopictus in Europe.},

Abstract = {CD30 is a transmembrane glycoprotein of the tumor necrosis factor
   receptor superfamily included in the diagnostic algorithm of human
   cutaneous, anaplastic large cell and Hodgkin lymphomas and represents an
   optimal therapeutic target for CD30(+) tumors. Similar diagnostic and
   therapeutic approaches are largely missing for feline lymphomas.
   Cross-reactivity of the antihuman CD30 receptor clone Ber-H2 was
   investigated in feline lymphomas. Comparative analysis of feline and
   human CD30 identified 61\% identity of the amino acid sequence, with
   100\% identity of the main sequence of the epitope targeted by the
   antibody (RKQCEPDYYL). CD30 expression in normal feline tissues was
   restricted to rare lymphoid cells in perifollicular and interfollicular
   lymph node areas and in the thymic medulla. In feline lymphoma, CD30 was
   expressed in 4 of 33 (13\%) T-cell lymphomas, 3 of 22 (14\%) B-cell
   lymphomas, and 5 of 7 (71\%) mixed-cell lymphomas, showing diffuse (1/5)
   or multifocal (4/5) positivity restricted to neoplastic multinucleated
   lymphoid cells and binucleated cells consistent with Reed-Sternberg-like
   cells. Based on the human classification system, cell morphology,
   expression of multiple markers (mixed cell components), and CD30
   positivity, these cases were considered most consistent with classical
   Hodgkin-like lymphoma (HLL). The other 2 mixed-cell lymphomas were CD30
   negative and thus most consistent with either T-cell-rich large B-cell
   lymphoma (TCRLBCL) or nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma
   (NLPHL). These findings provide multiple data supporting the
   cross-reactivity of the Ber-H2 anti-CD30 clone in feline tissues and
   give evidence of the usefulness of CD30 in the diagnostic evaluation of
   feline lymphoma.},

Title = {Neurobrucellosis in a common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus)

Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Background Brucella spp. isolation is increasingly reported in
   cetaceans, although associated pathologies, including lesions of the
   musculoskeletal and nervous systems, are less frequently described.
   Concerning the nervous system, Brucella sp. infection causing
   meningitis, meningoencephalitis or meningoencephalomyelitis have been
   extensively reported in striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba), and
   less frequently in other cetacean species. Case presentation A juvenile
   female common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) was found stranded
   alive in Lanzarote (Canary Islands, Spain) in 2005, but died shortly
   after. On physical examination, the dolphin showed a moderate body
   condition and was classified as code 2 (fresh dead) at the time of
   necropsy. The main gross findings were severe multiorgan parasitism,
   thickened and congested leptomeninges, and (sero)fibrino-suppurative and
   proliferative arthritis of the shoulder joint. Histopathological
   examination revealed the distinct features of a sub-acute systemic
   disease associated with Cetacean Morbillivirus (CeMV) infection.
   However, brain lesions diverged from those reported in systemic CeMV
   infection. This led to suspect that there was a coinfecting pathogen,
   based on the characteristics of the inflammatory response and the lesion
   distribution pattern in the central nervous system. Brucella sp. was
   detected in the brain tissue by PCR and Brucella antigen was
   demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in the brain and shoulder joint
   lesions. Conclusions The zoonotic potential of marine mammal strains of
   Brucella has been demonstrated both in natural and laboratory
   conditions. In this study, PCR detected Brucella sp. in the brain of a
   common bottlenose dolphin stranded in the Canary Islands; the dolphin
   was also co-infected with CeMV. This is the first detection of Brucella
   sp. infection in a stranded cetacean in this archipelago. Therefore, we
   stress the importance of taking adequate measures during the handling of
   these species to prevent the transmissions of the infection to humans.},

Abstract = {The replacement of synthetic acaricides with organic treatments is a big
   challenge in modern beekeeping. In summer 2015, we carried out in
   Central Italy a study to compare the varroacide efficacy and the
   toxicity on honey bees of the formic acid evaporator Nassenheider
   Professional(?) with two new formic acid-based gel formulations: MAQS(?)
   and Varterminator(?). In the same apiary with 32 colonies, four
   homogeneous groups with eight hives each were prepared. The mean
   acaricide efficacy of Nassenheider Professional(?) was 73.2???12.5\%,
   while MAQS(?) and Varterminator(?) showed a mean efficacy of 49.3???14.9
   and 81.2???16.0\%, respectively. Colonies showed a statistically
   significant reduction of adult bees only after the MAQS(?) treatment
   with respect to the control group. All the treatments showed absent or
   quite moderate queen mortality (MAQS(?) and in Varterminator(?) groups
   12.5\%, Nassenheider professional(?), and control groups 0\%). Our study
   indicates that Nassenheider Professional(?) and Varterminator(?) may
   represent a sustainable and effective solution to control mite

Title = {When resolution does matter: Modelling indirect contacts in dairy farms
   at different levels of detail},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 17},
Abstract = {Animal exchanges are considered the major pathway for between-farm
   transmission of many livestock infectious diseases. Yet, vehicles and
   operators visiting several farms during routine activities can also
   contribute to disease spread. Indeed, if contaminated, they can act as
   mechanical vectors of fomites, generating indirect contacts between
   visited farms. While data on animal exchanges is often available in
   national databases, information about the daily itineraries of trucks
   and operators is rare because difficult to obtain. Thus, some
   unavoidable approximations have been frequently introduced in the
   description of indirect contacts in epidemic models. Here, we showed
   that the level of detail in such description can significantly affect
   the predictions on disease dynamics. Our analyses focused on the
   potential spread of a disease in a dairy farm system subject of a
   comprehensive data collection campaign on calf transportations. We
   developed two temporal multilayer networks to model between-farm
   contacts generated by either animal exchanges (direct contacts) and
   connections operated by trucks moving calves (indirect contacts). The
   complete model used the full knowledge of the daily trucks' itineraries,
   while the partial informed one used only a subset of such available
   information. To account for various conditions of pathogen survival
   ability and effectiveness of cleaning operations, we performed a
   sensitivity analysis on trucks' contamination period. An accurate
   description of indirect contacts was crucial both to correctly predict
   the final size of epidemics and to identify the seed farms responsible
   for generating the most severe outbreaks. The importance of detailed
   information emerged even more clearly in the case of short contamination
   periods. Our conclusions could be extended to between-farm contacts
   generated by other vehicles and operators. Overcoming these information
   gaps would be decisive for a deeper understanding of epidemic spread in
   livestock and to develop effective control plans.},

Abstract = {This work was carried out to pursue a double objective: to improve the
   hygienic safety of cheeses produced from raw ewes' milk; and to produce
   a new typology of raw ewes' milk through the application of ``Grana{''}
   technology for which the name ``Gran Ovino{''} was chosen. With this in
   mind, raw milk from an individual farm was transformed under controlled
   conditions at a dairy pilot plant. The production technology included
   the partial skimming of the evening and morning milk mixture by cream
   surfacing and the addition of a natural whey starter cultures (NWSC)
   prepared with four selected Streptococcus thermophilus strains (PON6,
   PON244, PON261 e PON413). Ten microbial groups were investigated by
   plate counts from raw milk until ripened cheeses. Lactic acid bacteria
   (LAB) were in the range 10(4)-10(5) CFU/ml before NWSC addition. After
   curdling, this group increased by 3 log cycles and was counted at 10(6)
   CFU/g after curd cooking. A rapid pH drop (to 6.05) was registered after
   almost 3 h from NWSC addition. The levels of members of the
   Enterobacteriaceae family were at about 10(3) CFU/ml in raw milk and
   decreased after curd cooking to 1 log cycle. A similar behavior was
   shown by the other undesired microbial groups and a complete
   disappearance of staphylococci was registered. The microbiological
   counts of 9-month ripened cheeses showed the dominance of LAB and
   undetectable levels of the undesired bacteria. MiSeq Illumina was
   applied to better investigate the bacterial composition of ripened
   cheeses and this technique evidenced that the majority of OTUs belonged
   to Lactobacillus and Streptococcus genera. The final cheeses were
   characterized by 67.65\% dry matter of which 41.85\% of fats and 47.02\%
   of proteins. The main cheese fatty acids were palmitic, oleic and
   myristic acids and the saturated fatty acids/unsaturated fatty acids
   ratio was 2.17. Forty-one volatile compounds, including acids, esters,
   ketones, alcohols, aldehydes, phenols and one terpene were emitted from
   the cheese. Sensory evaluation showed a general appreciation for the new
   cheese product by judges.},

Abstract = {Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) emerged suddenly in the late 1970s as
   pathogen of dogs, causing a severe and often fatal gastroenteric
   disease. The original CPV-2 was replaced by three antigenic variants,
   CPV-2a, CPV-2b and CPV-2c, which to date have gained a worldwide
   distribution with different relative proportions. All previous studies
   conducted in Africa were based on partial VP2 gene sequences. The aim of
   this study was to provide a genome analysis to characterize the CPV
   strains collected in Nigeria, Africa. Rectal swab samples (n = 320) were
   collected in 2018 and tested by means of an immunochromatographic assay.
   Among the 144 positive samples, 59 were selected for further analyses
   using different molecular assays. The results revealed a high prevalence
   of CPV-2c (91.5\%) compared to the CPV-2a variant (8.5\%). The VP2 gene
   sequences showed a divergence from the strains analysed in 2010 in
   Nigeria and a closer connection with CPV strains of Asian origin. The
   non-structural gene analysis evidenced amino acid changes never
   previously reported. The molecular analysis based on genomic sequences
   evidenced a geographical pattern of distribution of the analysed
   strains, suggesting a potential common evolutionary origin with CPV of
   Asian origin. This study represents the first CPV molecular
   characterization including all the encoding gene sequences conducted in
   the African continent and contributes to define the current geographical
   spread of the CPV variants worldwide.},

Title = {Heavy metal contents in green spears of asparagus (Asparagus officinalis
   L.) grown in Southern Italy: Variability among farms, genotypes and
   effect of soil mycorrhizal inoculation},
Journal = {SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {256},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {The concentration of sixteen different heavy metals (HMs) {[}arsenicum
   (As), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe),
   mercury (Hg), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb),
   selenium (Se), tin (Sn), uranium (U), vanadium (V) and zinc (Zn)] were
   determined in green asparagus spears produced in an intensively
   cultivated area of Southern Italy. The level of the HMs was analysed in
   the most common cultivar in the area ('Grande'), along with the
   variability in HM contents on four different farms within this area. The
   effect on HM levels of soil inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal
   fungi (AMF) and of three different genotypes ('Atlas', `Italo' and
   `Purple passion') was also evaluated.
   Asparagus spears had greater amounts of Fe (29.3 mg kg(-1) fresh weight
   - fw), Zn (3.1 mg kg(-1) fw) and Mn (2.0 mg kg(-1) fw) than the other
   micronutrients. As a whole the observed values were within the range
   reported in the literature and in food composition databases for
   asparagus and other vegetables, being even richer in iron and lower in
   As, Cd, Hg and Pb. The principal component analysis underlined a larger
   HM concentration in both plant essential (Fe, Mn), beneficial (Co, Se
   and V) and non-essential (As, Cr, Pb) elements in the product obtained
   from two out of the four farms investigated, likely to be due to the
   larger application of organic amendments. Between the less intensively
   fertilized farms, a lower content of Cu and Ni and an improved Mo level
   further seems to result from the non-application of mineral phosphorus
   and of guano-based fertilizers. The product from AMF inoculated soil was
   distinctively richer in almost all the elements, particularly in
   non-essential ones, but also in several important micronutrients for
   humans health (e.g.: Cu, Fe, Mn). Compared with the standard cultivar
   ('Grande'), `Atlas' and `Italo' had a greater concentration of As,
   whereas no changes or lower levels were detected for the other HMs. The
   violet type ('Purple passion') stood out for the highest Se content
   along with a generally lower level of other HMs.},

Abstract = {In Italy, the first human case of West Nile Virus (WNV) infection was
   reported in 2008 and, since then, the number of cases has been steadily
   increasing. In this study, we describe the temporal and spatial pattern
   of WNV infection risk among humans in Italy, focusing on the human cases
   of West Nile Neuro-invasive Disease (WNND) observed between 2008 and
   2017. Incidence rates are estimated for each year and province under
   study. The incidence temporal trend is estimated using Poisson
   regression, and a spatio-temporal cluster detection analysis is
   performed to detect high-risk areas. In total, 231 WNND cases were
   notified in Italy between 2008 and 2017. The annual incidence rates
   increased during the study period (annual percentage change: 11.7\%;
   95\%CI: -0.9\%; 26.1\%). A geographical spread of the disease was
   observed during the study period throughout Northern Italy, with an
   increasing number of affected provinces. Provinces close to the Po River
   (the main river in the north of Italy) and the Oristano province (in the
   Sardinia Island) experienced the highest incidence rates during the
   study period. Our study shows a gradual, but rapid spread of WNND across
   Northern Italy from east to west and suggests the hypothesis that
   provinces close to Po River might present ecological and climatic
   conditions favourable to the virus circulation.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the use of cleaner fish for biological control of sea
   lice has increased considerably. Along with this, a number of infectious
   diseases have emerged. The aim of this study was to investigate the
   susceptibility of lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus) to Betanodavirus since
   it was detected in asymptomatic wild wrasses in Norway and Sweden. Three
   betanodaviruses were used to challenge lumpfish: one RGNNV genotype and
   two BFNNV genotypes. Fish were injected and monitored for 4 weeks. Brain
   samples from clinically affected specimens, from weekly randomly
   selected fish and survivors were subjected to molecular testing, viral
   isolation, histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Reduced survival was
   observed but was attributed to tail-biting behaviour, since no nervous
   signs were observed throughout the study. Betanodavirus RNA was detected
   in all samples, additionally suggesting an active replication of the
   virus in the brain. Viral isolation confirmed molecular biology results
   and revealed a high viral titre in BFNNV-infected groups associated with
   typical lesions in brains and eyes of survivor fish. We concluded that
   lumpfish are susceptible to Betanodavirus, as proven by the high viral
   titre and brain lesions detected, but further studies are necessary to
   understand if Betanodavirus can cause clinical disease in this species.},

Abstract = {A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the seroprevalence
   and the risk factors associated with C. burnetii infection in cattle in
   the state of Setif in northeastern Algeria from March 2016 to April
   2018. A total of 678 cows animals aged at least 24 months and belonging
   to 90 herds were randomly selected. A serum sample from each cow was
   tested for antibodies against C. burnetii using an indirect
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A structured questionnaire
   focusing on risk factors for C. burnetii infection was administered to
   farm owners involved in the study. The individual animal prevalence was
   11.36\% (77/678) (95\%CI 8.97-13.75\%), the herd prevalence was 45.56\%
   (41/90) (95\%CI 35.27-55.84\%), and the within-herd prevalence ranged
   from 9.09 to 57.14\% (mean 23.71\%; Q1 11.11\%, Q2 or median 20\%, Q3
   30\%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that contact
   with other herds (odds ratio (OR) 1.95, 95 CI 1.12-3.42) and purchased
   animals (OR 2.05, 95 CI 1.14-3.68) was identified as risk factors for
   seropositivity to C. burnetii, while the use of disinfectants (OR 0.32,
   95 CI 0.14-0.72) was identified as protective factor. The results from
   the present study indicate that C. burnetii is circulating into cattle
   herds in the region of Setif in Northeastern of Algeria. It is
   recommended to implement good hygienic practices and measures of
   biosecurity to reduce the spread of infection between cattle herds and
   possible exposure of humans.},

Title = {Antimicrobial resistance genotypes and phenotypes of Campylobacter
   jejuni isolated in Italy from humans, birds from wild and urban
   habitats, and poultry},

Abstract = {Campylobacter jejuni, a common foodborne zoonotic pathogen, causes
   gastroenteritis worldwide and is increasingly resistant to antibiotics.
   We aimed to investigate the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genotypes of
   C. jejuni isolated from humans, poultry and birds from wild and urban
   Italian habitats to identify correlations between phenotypic and
   genotypic AMR in the isolates. Altogether, 644 C. jejuni isolates from
   humans (51), poultry (526) and wild- and urban-habitat birds (67) were
   analysed. The resistance phenotypes of the isolates were determined
   using the microdilution method with EUCAST breakpoints, and
   AMR-associated genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms were obtained
   from a publicly available database. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
   showed that C. jejuni isolates from poultry and humans were highly
   resistant to ciprofloxacin (85.55\% and 76.47\%, respectively),
   nalidixic acid (75.48\% and 74.51\%, respectively) and tetracycline
   (67.87\% and 49.02\%, respectively). Fewer isolates from the wild- and
   urban-habitat birds were resistant to tetracycline (19.40\%),
   fluoroquinolones (13.43\%), and quinolone and streptomycin (10.45\%). We
   retrieved seven AMR genes (tet (O), cmeA, cmeB, cmeC, cmeR, blaOXA-61
   and blaOXA-184) and gyrA-associated point mutations. Two major B-lactam
   genes called blaOXA-61 and blaOXA-184 were prevalent at 62.93\% and
   82.08\% in the poultry and the other bird groups, respectively. Strong
   correlations between genotypic and phenotypic resistance were found for
   fluoroquinolones and tetracycline. Compared with the farmed chickens,
   the incidence of AMR in the C. jejuni isolates from the other bird
   groups was low, confirming that the food-production birds are much more
   exposed to antimicrobials. The improper and overuse of antibiotics in
   the human population and in animal husbandry has resulted in an increase
   in antibiotic-resistant infections, particularly fluoroquinolone
   resistant ones. Better understanding of the AMR mechanisms in C. jejuni
   is necessary to develop new strategies for improving AMR programs and
   provide the most appropriate therapies to human and veterinary
   populations.},

Title = {Positive Reinforcement-Based Training for Self-Loading of Meat Horses
   Reduces Loading Time and Stress-Related Behavior},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {The present work aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a self-loading
   training using positive reinforcement on stress-related behaviors shown
   by meat horses during loading procedures into a truck. Thirty-two meat
   horses (M = 18; F = 14; 6 month-old) were included in the study. All
   horses had limited interactions with the farmer and were not used to be
   restrained nor lead by halter. Horses were divided in two groups:
   Control Group (C; N = 14) and Training Group (T; N = 18). T horses were
   trained to self-load: in order to teach the horses to enter into the
   truck, a targeting training technique throughout a shaping process was
   applied. Training sessions were performed three times a week, from 9:30
   a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and from 2:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., for 6 weeks; training
   was then repeated once a week to maintain the memory until the transport
   toward a slaughterhouse. The loading phase was video-recorded and
   loading time was directly recorded using a stopwatch. All horses were
   transported to the same slaughterhouse in 14 different days using the
   same truck. Behavior was subsequently analyzed with a focal animal
   continuous recording method. Loading time was shorter in T horses (mean
   +/- SD = 44.44 +/- 47.58 s) than in C horses (mean +/- SD = 463.09 +/-
   918.19 s) (T-test; p = 0.019). T horses showed more forward locomotion
   toward the truck than C horses (T-test; p = 0.029). Our preliminary
   findings suggest that self-loading training may be useful tomitigate

Abstract = {This paper shows a simple, rapid and cost-effective method for
   multielement analyses of cosmetics. Total reflection X-ray fluorescence
   spectrometry (TXRF) is used to determine the composition, particularly
   the presence of potentially toxic elements, of cosmetics. Three sample
   preparation methods based on suspension preparation were developed for
   different types of cosmetic samples, e.g. lipsticks, eye shadows and
   body creams.
   Limits of detection within the low mg kg(-1) range were obtained and
   enabled cosmetic screening for compliance with the legal thresholds for
   some major toxic elements. A good accuracy of the results on a wide
   range of concentration levels (>10000 mg kg(-1)) was found without the
   need of sample dilution. Results obtained for most elements in the
   lipstick and cream samples agreed with those obtained by the reference
   method recommended by the Food and Drug Administration, based on using
   inductively coupled plasma techniques after microwave digestion.
   However, for eyeshadow analysis, a more sophisticate approach is needed
   to improve the analytical results. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Development of a fixed list of terms for the Qualitative Behavioural
   Assessment of shelter dogs},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 4},
Abstract = {The shelter environment may have a severe impact on the dogs' quality of
   life, and there is thus a need to develop valid tools to assess their
   welfare. These tools should be sensitive not only to the animals'
   physical health but also to their mental health, including the
   assessment of positive and negative emotions. Qualitative Behaviour
   Assessment (QBA) is a `whole animal' measure that captures the
   expressive quality of an animal's demeanour, using descriptive terms
   such as `relaxed', `anxious', and `playful'. In this study, for the
   first time, we developed and tested a fixed-list of qualitative QBA
   terms for application to kennelled dogs. A list of 20 QBA terms was
   developed based on literature search and an expert opinion survey.
   Inter-observer reliability was investigated by asking 11 observers to
   use these terms to score 13 video clips of kennelled dogs. Principal
   Component Analysis (PCA) was used to extract four main dimensions
   explaining 70.9\% of the total variation between clips. PC1
   characterised curious/playful/excitable/sociable demeanour, PC2 ranged
   from comfortable/relaxed to anxious/nervous/ stressed expression, PC3
   described fearful demeanour, and PC4 characterised bored/depressed
   demeanour. Observers' agreement on the ranking of video clips on these
   four expressive dimensions was good (Kendall's W: 0.60-0.80). ANOVA
   showed a significant effect of observer on mean clip score on all PCs
   (p<0.05), due to few observers scoring differently from the rest of the
   group. Results indicate the potential of the proposed list of QBA terms
   for sheltered dogs to serve, in alignment with other measures, as a
   non-invasive assessment tool. However, the observer effect on mean PC
   scores points towards the need for adequate observer training,
   particularly in live scoring conditions. The QBA scoring tool can be
   integrated with existing welfare assessment protocols for shelter dogs
   and strengthen the power of those protocols to evaluate the animals'
   experience in shelters.},

Abstract = {MiRNAs, a small family of non-coding RNA, are now emerging as regulators
   of stem cell pluripotency, differentiation, and autophagy, thus
   controlling stem cell behavior. Stem cells are undifferentiated elements
   capable to acquire specific phenotype under different kind of stimuli,
   being a main tool for regenerative medicine. Within this context, we
   have previously shown that stem cells isolated from Wharton jelly
   multipotent stem cells (WJ-MSCs) exhibit gender differences in the
   expression of the stemness related gene OCT4 and the epigenetic
   modulator gene DNA-Methyltransferase (DNMT1). Here, we further analyze
   this gender difference, evaluating adipogenic and osteogenic
   differentiation potential, autophagic process, and expression of
   miR-145, miR-148a, and miR-185 in WJ-MSCs derived from males and
   females. These miRNAs were selected since they are involved in OCT4 and
   DNMT1 gene expression, and in stem cell differentiation. Our results
   indicate a difference in the regulatory circuit involving
   miR-148a/DNMT1/OCT4 autophagy in male WJ-MSCs as compared to female
   cells. Moreover, no difference was detected in the expression of the
   two-differentiation regulating miRNA (miR-145 and miR-185). Taken
   together, our results highlight a different behavior of WJ-MSCs from
   males and females, disclosing the chance to better understand cellular
   processes as autophagy and stemness, usable for future clinical
   applications.},

Abstract = {Veneto region, Northeast Italy, has been declared officially free from
   bovine tuberculosis since 2008, although the disease is sporadically
   detected in association with cattle trade. In September 2015, bovine
   tuberculosis was detected in a dairy cattle farm of the region, in a
   holding with 69 animals. The herd underwent single intradermal
   tuberculin testing as part of the regional surveillance plan, and 24
   animals resulted positive. Mycobacterium caprae was evidenced in 22
   samples, further genotyped by PCR-based assays as Allgau type.
   Epidemiological investigation reported that sixteen animals were
   introduced from an officially tuberculosis free Member State in previous
   years. Nevertheless, spoligotyping and multilocus variable tandem repeat
   analysis (MLVA) indicated that M. caprae was strictly related to the
   strain circulating in 2007-2009 in Trento province (Trentino-Alto Adige
   region, Northeast Italy), although no at-risk contacts were described.
   M. caprae is a zoonotic pathogen and further analyses are warranted in
   order to control its spread and impact on public health and animal
   trade.},

Title = {Genes conferring resistance to critically important antimicrobials in
   Salmonella enterica isolated from animals and food: A systematic review
   of the literature, 2013-2017},
Journal = {RESEARCH IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance is a major public health concern, and food
   systems are a crucial point in the epidemiology of these resistances.
   Among antimicrobials, critically important ones are therapeutic drugs
   that should be primarily safeguarded to allow successful outcomes
   against important bacterial infections in humans. The most important
   source of antimicrobial resistance has been recognized in the
   inappropriate use of antimicrobials in human and animal medicine, with
   farming being a critical stage. Products of animal origin are the link
   between animal and humans and can contribute to the spread of
   antimicrobial resistance, in particular through bacteria such as
   Enterobacteriaceae, commonly present in both animals' gut and food.
   Salmonella is an important member of this bacterial family due to its
   pathogenicity, its noteworthy prevalence and the frequent detection of
   resistance genes in different isolates. In the present systematic
   review, the distribution of antimicrobial resistance determinants among
   Salmonella enterica serovars in pigs, cattle and poultry production was
   investigated in the European context. A comprehensive literature search
   was carried out in three different databases, and 7955 papers were
   identified as relevant. After the different steps of the review process,
   31 papers were considered eligible for data extraction to gain insight
   about sources and reservoirs for such genes. Results suggest that
   despite the increasing attention directed toward antimicrobial
   resistance in animal production, a wide plethora of genes still exist
   and further actions should be undertaken to face this challenge.},

Abstract = {An outbreak of neurological disorders in a flock of 20 sheep coming from
   a rural farm in Civitella Roveto, Italy, occurred in winter 2015. All
   the animals showed tonic-clonic convulsions followed by muscle paralysis
   associated with dilated pupils, tremor, tachycardia, tachypnea and
   diarrhea. The presence of bundles of dry broom of Spartium junceum L. in
   the feed, eaten by the animals supported the hypothesis of plant
   intoxication. Two animals died after worsening of clinical signs.The
   anatomopathological findings and the laboratory results ruled out viral
   or bacterial infections or accidental exposure to other toxics.
   Phytochemical study showed the presence of large amount of cytisine, a
   nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, in all parts of the plant
   eaten by the animals. Clinical and pathological findings, the complete
   remission of clinical signs after the exclusion of dry broom from the
   diet, together with the results of phytochemical analyses results
   corroborated the hypothesis of S. junceum L. intoxication.},

Abstract = {Food irradiation is used to preserve food from pathogenic
   microorganisms, deterioration and to extend shelf life. The EU
   legislation states that any irradiated food or food ingredients must be
   labeled with the word ``irradiated{''}. The ESR spectroscopy is a
   powerful tool to enhance official checks; hence, it has been used to
   detect irradiated hazelnuts. The results from the ESR studies on
   hazelnuts before and after X-ray irradiation are reported. Before
   irradiation hazelnuts exhibit one singlet ESR line characterized with a
   g-factor of 2.0046 +/- 0.0006. After irradiation, a typical
   ``cellulose-like{''} triplet ESR spectrum appears. To investigate the
   radio-induced free radical stability, the peak-to-peak amplitude of the
   ESR satellite signals was considered. Fading measurements indicate that
   the intensity of the ESR spectra of hazelnuts is reduced to about 70\%
   after 30 days. In addition, the microwave power behavior and a
   dose-response relation were investigated. The study confirmed the
   applicability of ESR technique to detect irradiated hazelnuts also when
   a long time after treatment was passed.},

Title = {Molecular detection of Pneumocystis in the lungs of cats},
Journal = {MEDICAL MYCOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {57},
Number = {7},
Pages = {813-824},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The genus Pneumocystis comprises potential pathogens that reside
   normally in the lungs of a wide range of mammals. Although they
   generally behave as transient or permanent commensals, they can
   occasionally cause life-threatening pneumonia (Pneumocystis pneumonia;
   PCP) in immunosuppressed individuals. Several decades ago, the presence
   of Pneumocystis morphotypes (trophic forms and cysts) was described in
   the lungs of normal cats and cats with experimentally induced
   symptomatic PCP (after immunosuppression by corticosteroids); yet to
   date spontaneous or drug-induced PCP has not been described in the
   clinical feline literature, despite immunosuppression of cats by
   long-standing retrovirus infections or after kidney transplantation. In
   this study, we describe the presence of Pneumocystis DNA in the lungs of
   normal cats (that died of various unrelated causes; n = 84) using
   polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) targeting the mitochondrial small and
   large subunit ribosomal RNA gene (mtSSU rRNA and mtLSU rRNA). The
   presence of Pneumocystis DNA was confirmed by sequencing in 24/84 (29\%)
   cats, with evidence of two different sequence types (or lineages).
   Phylogenetically, lineage1 (L1; 19 cats) and lineage 2 (L2; 5 cats)
   formed separate clades, clustering with Pneumocystis from domestic pigs
   (L1) and carnivores (L2), respectively. Results of the present study
   support the notion that cats can be colonized or subclinically infected
   by Pneumocystis, without histological evidence of damage to the
   pulmonary parenchyma referable to pneumocystosis. Pneumocystis seems
   most likely an innocuous pathogen of cats' lungs, but its possible role
   in the exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disorders or viral/bacterial
   coinfections should be considered further in a clinical setting.},

Abstract = {We report the first case of Mycobacterium bovis infection in a
   free-living fallow deer (Dama dama) in northwest Italy, the
   epidemiological analysis (i.e., tracing source and dissemination during
   outbreaks), and the potential source of infection in a historically
   animal tuberculosis (aTB)-free area. Gross lung and lymph node lesions
   were histologically consistent with a severe parasitic bronchopneumonia
   due to lungworms associated with severe mycobacterial infection. The
   lesions contained numerous densely packaged, acid-fast bacilli, raising
   suspicion of an active, open form of aTB. Acid-fast organisms were
   characterized as M. bovis SB0120-ETR 45533, one of the most common
   profiles in Italy. Epidemiological investigation into the most recent
   outbreaks caused by M. bovis SB0120-ETR 45533 within a 50-km radius of
   where the fallow deer was retrieved disclosed two different situations:
   one case involving a water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) in 2008 and one
   involving a donkey in 2016. Analysis of spoligotype and VNTR-type
   pattern circulating and recorded in northwest Italy from 1999 to 2014
   suggested that in the cases of the donkey and the fallow deer, the
   source of infection was most likely attributable to spillover from
   outbreaks in domestic species: cattle and water buffalo, respectively.
   According to the European Commission, aTB status of livestock does not
   depend on aTB cases in wildlife (Council Directive 64/432/33C of 26 June
   1964); nevertheless, the primary aim of aTB eradication should include
   global monitoring of all susceptible species if the re-emergence of M.
   bovis from established wildlife reservoir is to be prevented.},

Abstract = {Canine distemper (CD) may pose a serious threat to Alpine wild
   carnivores and affect their population dynamics. Since 2006, the strain
   Europe Wildlife 2006-09, a distinct CD virus subgroup within viral
   lineage Europe 1 (EU1) characterized by increased virulence and host
   range expansion, has been linked to multiple CD outbreaks in Alpine wild
   carnivores. The aim of this study was to fill knowledge gaps about
   ongoing Alpine outbreaks of CD. To do this, we report on the circulation
   of canine distemper virus (CDV) and outbreaks of CD in Alpine wild
   carnivores in northwest Italy. A specific diagnostic protocol applied to
   a sample of 548 wild carnivores collected between January 2013 and
   December 2015 revealed the circulation of CDV belonging to the EU1
   lineage. All isolates were carriers of amino-acid mutations defining the
   cluster Europe Wildlife 2006-09. A self-maintained multihost pathogen
   system may have developed in northwest Italy in which interspecies
   transmission from red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) to other noncanid species
   enhanced pathogen maintenance in the system.},

Abstract = {Bacteria of the genus Brucella cause brucellosis, an infectious disease
   common to humans as well as to terrestrial and aquatic mammals. Since
   1994 several cases of Brucella spp. infection have been reported in
   marine mammals worldwide. While sero-epidemiological data suggest that
   Brucella spp. infection is widespread globally, detecting Brucella
   spp.associated antigens by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in tissues from
   infected animals is often troublesome. The present study was aimed at
   investigating, by means of IHC based upon the utilization of an
   anti-Brucella LPS monoclonal antibody (MAb), the central nervous system
   (CNS) immunoreactivity shown by B. ceti-infected,
   neurobrucellosis-affected striped dolphins. The aforementioned MAb,
   previously characterized by means of ELISA and Western Blotting
   techniques, was able to immunohistochemically detect smooth brucellae
   both within the CNS from B. ceti-infected striped dolphins and within a
   range of tissues from Brucella spp.infected domestic ruminants. In
   conclusion, the results of the present study are of relevance both from
   the B. ceti infection's diagnostic and pathogenetic standpoints.},

Title = {Updated unified phylogenetic classification system and revised
   nomenclature for Newcastle disease virus},
Journal = {INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {74},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Several Avianparamyxoviruses 1 (synonymous with Newcastle disease virus
   or NDV, used hereafter) classification systems have been proposed for
   strain identification and differentiation. These systems pioneered
   classification efforts; however, they were based on different approaches
   and lacked objective criteria for the differentiation of isolates. These
   differences have created discrepancies among systems, rendering
   discussions and comparisons across studies difficult. Although a system
   that used objective classification criteria was proposed by Diel and
   coworkers in 2012, the ample worldwide circulation and constant
   evolution of NDV, and utilization of only some of the criteria, led to
   identical naming and/or incorrect assigning of new sub/genotypes. To
   address these issues, an international consortium of experts was
   convened to undertake in-depth analyses of NDV genetic diversity. This
   consortium generated curated, up-to-date, complete fusion gene class I
   and class II datasets of all known NDV for public use, performed
   comprehensive phylogenetic neighbor-Joining, maximum-likelihood,
   Bayesian and nucleotide distance analyses, and compared these inference
   methods. An updated NDV classification and nomenclature system that
   incorporates phylogenetic topology, genetic distances, branch support,
   and epidemiological independence was developed. This new consensus
   system maintains two NDV classes and existing genotypes, identifies
   three new class II genotypes, and reduces the number of sub-genotypes.
   In order to track the ancestry of viruses, a dichotomous naming system
   for designating sub-genotypes was introduced. In addition, a pilot
   dataset and sub-trees rooting guidelines for rapid preliminary genotype
   identification of new isolates are provided. Guidelines for sequence
   dataset curation and phylogenetic inference, and a detailed comparison
   between the updated and previous systems are included. To increase the
   speed of phylogenetic inference and ensure consistency between
   laboratories, detailed guidelines for the use of a supercomputer are
   also provided. The proposed unified classification system will
   facilitate future studies of NDV evolution and epidemiology, and
   comparison of results obtained across the world.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to assess the influence of live body weight (LBW) and
   age on reproductive performance in buffalo heifers synchronized by
   different treatments. The study was carried out on 146 Mediterranean
   buffalo heifers (mean age 25.3 +/- 13.4 months, LBW 424 +/- 47 kg),
   divided into 2 homogeneous groups and synchronized by Ovsynch-TAI
   Program (OVS; n = 72) or double prostaglandin administered 12 days apart
   (PGF; n = 74). All the buffaloes were inseminated twice and follicle
   dimensions and ovulation rate (OR) were assessed by ultrasound 24 and 48
   h post-insemination. Pregnancy was assessed on day 25, 45 and 90
   post-insemination and the incidence of late embryonic (LEM) and fetal
   (FM) mortality were respectively recorded. Data were analyzed by ANOVA,
   Chi-square test and multiple logistic regression. The LBW was
   significantly (P<0.05) higher in inseminated animals, compared to those
   that did not respond to the treatments (450.0 +/- 3.2 vs. 423.2 +/- 9.6
   kg in inseminated and not inseminated heifers, respectively). Total OR
   was similar between groups, although OR at 24 h tended to be higher (P =
   0.06) in OVS (86.7 vs. 72.9\% in OVS and PGF, respectively). A (P<0.01)
   higher LBW was observed in ovulated heifers of PGF, while no differences
   were recorded in OVS. LBW affected OR (odds ratio = 1,032; P<0.05) only
   in PGF, while no effects were recorded in OVS. Total pregnancy rate, LEM
   and FM were similar between groups. In conclusion, the LBW would be
   considered before including buffalo heifers in a synchronization program
   and both synchronization treatments can be useful.},

Title = {Vector Competence of Italian Populations of Culicoides for Some

Abstract = {The distribution of Bluetongue virus (BTV) in Europe can be represented
   by two distinct and interconnected epidemiological systems (episystems),
   each characterized by different ecological characteristics and vector
   species. This study investigated the vector competence of Italian
   populations of Culicoides imicola and Culicoides obsoletus/scoticus to
   some representative BTV strains after artificial oral infection. The BTV
   strains were selected according to their ability to spread to one or
   both episystems and included BTV-4 ITA, responsible of the recent
   Italian and French BTV-4 outbreaks; the BTV-2 strain which caused the
   first BTV incursion in Italy, Corsica, and Balearic Islands; BTV-4 MOR,
   responsible for the epidemic in Morocco; and BTV-8, the strain which
   spread through Europe between 2006 and 2008. Blood-soaked cotton
   pledgets and Hemotek membrane feeder using Parafilm (R) membrane were
   used to artificially feed midges. For each population/strain, recovery
   rates (positive/tested heads) were evaluated using serogroup- and
   serotype-specific RT-PCR. The trial demonstrated that, except for the
   Abruzzo population of C. obsoletus/C. scoticus, which was refractory to
   BTV-4 MOR infection, all the investigated Culicoides populations are
   susceptible to the selected BTV strains and that, if prompt vaccination
   programs and restriction measures had not been implemented, BTV-2 and
   BTV-4 MOR could have spread all over Europe.},

Abstract = {Orf virus (ORFV; Family: Poxviridae) is the causative agent of
   contagious ecthyma, or Orf disease in sheep, goats and other domestic or
   wild ruminants with a worldwide distribution. The disease is endemic in
   Italy, but few data are available about its distribution and
   epidemiology. In the present study we analysed 32 clinical samples,
   obtained from crusted scab lesions of 5 goats and 27 sheep, from 19
   suspected outbreaks of contagious ecthyma in Apulia and Basilicata
   regions between 2012 and 2014. Negative staining electron microscopy
   (EM) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the late
   transcription factor gene (VLTF-1) were used to identify the virus.
   Isolation was also attempted on BHK-21 cell line. PCR was proved to be
   more sensitive than EM, as it detected the virus in 28 out of 32
   samples, whereas the EM detected it only in 26 out of the 32 samples.
   The majority of isolated strains forms a monophyletic group; these
   isolates, according to the VLTF-1 sequencing, are high related to ORFV
   strains previously shown to circulate in Southern Italy.},

Title = {Biological Effects of the Azaspiracid-Producing Dinoflagellate Azadinium

Journal = {MARINE DRUGS},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Azaspiracids (AZAs) are marine biotoxins including a variety of
   analogues. Recently, novel AZAs produced by the Mediterranean
   dinoflagellate Azadinium dexteroporum were discovered (AZA-54, AZA-55,
   3-epi-AZA-7, AZA-56, AZA-57 and AZA-58) and their biological effects
   have not been investigated yet. This study aimed to identify the
   biological responses (biomarkers) induced in mussels Mytilus
   galloprovincialis after the bioaccumulation of AZAs from A.
   dexteroporum. Organisms were fed with A. dexteroporum for 21 days and
   subsequently subjected to a recovery period (normal diet) of 21 days.
   Exposed organisms accumulated AZA-54, 3-epi-AZA-7 and AZA-55,
   predominantly in the digestive gland. Mussels' haemocytes showed
   inhibition of phagocytosis activity, modulation of the composition of
   haemocytic subpopulation and damage to lysosomal membranes; the
   digestive tissue displayed thinned tubule walls, consumption of storage
   lipids and accumulation of lipofuscin. Slight genotoxic damage was also
   observed. No clear occurrence of oxidative stress and alteration of
   nervous activity was detected in AZA-accumulating mussels. Most of the
   altered parameters returned to control levels after the recovery phase.
   The toxic effects detected in M. galloprovincialis demonstrate a clear
   biological impact of the AZAs produced by A. dexteroporum, and could be
   used as early indicators of contamination associated with the ingestion
   of seafood.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of dietary selenium
   supplementation of dairy cows on chemical-nutritional and aromatic
   properties of milk and related caciotta cheese. 34 Friesian cows were
   randomly assigned to two groups. The control group (CG) received a
   conventional feeding strategy, while the experimental group (EG) was fed
   with a daily selenomethionine supplementation. Dietary selenium
   integration did not induce variations on milk yield and composition, but
   induced a marked decrease in somatic cell count. Both in milk and cheese
   the EG samples showed an increase in linoleic and rumenic acids. The
   volatile profile of dairy products was also positively affected by
   dietary selenium intake, with a decrease in concentration of hexanoic
   acid, hexanal, heptanal, and an increase in ethyl hexanoate,
   delta-octalactone, delta-decalactone, 2-heptanone, and 2-nonanone. Such
   findings could contribute to the production of cheeses with interesting
   nutritional and organoleptic properties, although further sensorial
   evaluations should be performed to deeply investigate the consumer
   acceptability.},

Abstract = {Aim: This study aims to characterize clinical strains of Acinetobacter
   baumannii with an extensively drug-resistant phenotype. Methods: VITEK
   (R) 2, Etest (R) method and broth microdilution method for colistin were
   used. PCR analysis and multilocus sequence typing Pasteur scheme were
   performed to identify bla-OXA genes and genetic relatedness,
   respectively. Whole-genome sequencing analysis was used to characterize
   three isolates. Results: All the isolates were susceptible only to
   polymyxins. blaOXA-23-like gene was the only acquired carbapenemase gene
   in 88.2\% of the isolates. Multilocus sequence typing identified various
   sequence types: ST2, ST19, ST195, ST577 and ST632. Two new sequence
   types, namely, ST1279 and ST1280, were detected by whole-genome
   sequencing. Conclusion: This study showed that carbapenem-resistant A.
   baumannii isolates causing infections in intensive care units almost
   exclusively produce OXA-23, underlining their frequent spread in Italy.},

Abstract = {The dairy industry's silos is a critical point in the safety and quality
   control system. However, limited scientific evidence is available on
   measurement agreement between the milk analyses done by official control
   bodies and the self-monitoring analyses done by milk processing
   industries. Milk production data from a milk processing plant were
   collected for four months and analyzed by an official control body and
   the dairy company for freezing point, total bacterial count, somatic
   cell count, and for fat, lactose and protein percentages. Correlation
   and Bland-Altman analysis showed a good agreement between the two
   determinations for most of the variables (Spearman's rho > 0.82 for
   Somatic cell count, Fat\% and Protein \%), while low agreement was found
   for total bacterial counts (Spearman's rho =0.78). It was found that the
   difference between total bacterial counts was influenced by collecting
   route, time between sampling and analysis, and milk temperature inside
   the truck tank. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence, the genotypic
   diversity, the antimicrobial resistance traits of canine and feline
   clinical methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP)
   isolates in a diagnostic laboratory in Italy during 2015-2016.
   All isolates were characterized by multilocus sequence typing (MLST),
   staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC)-mec typing and staphylococcal
   protein A (spa)-typing. The resistance profiles were assessed by
   antimicrobial susceptibility testing and confirmed genotypically by the
   detection of mecA gene and by microarray analyses.
   The prevalence of MRSP isolates was high (31.6\%). All the strains were
   multidrug resistant and the most frequent clone was ST71-SCCmec type
   II-III. These results confirm a high prevalence of MRSP amongst clinical
   samples from pets in Italy. These isolates show multidrug resistance
   features that are of concern both in veterinary and human medicine for
   clinical and epidemiological reasons.},

Title = {The role of altered immune function during the dry period in promoting
   the development of subclinical ketosis in early lactation},

Abstract = {Subclinical ketosis (SCK) may impair white blood cell (WBC) function and
   thus contribute to the risk of disease postpartum. This preliminary
   study investigated changes occurring in the immune system before disease
   onset to elucidate their role in the occurrence of SCK. A group of 13
   Holstein dairy cows were housed in tiestalls and retrospectively divided
   into 2 groups based on their levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB)
   measured in plasma between calving day and 35 d from calving (DFC).
   Levels of BHB <1.4 mmol/L were found in 7 cows (control cows, CTR group)
   and levels >1.4 niniol/L were found in 6 cows at >= 1 of 6 time points
   considered (cows with SCK, KET group). From -48 to 35 DFC, body
   condition score, body weight, dry matter intake, rumination time, and
   milk yield were measured, and blood samples were collected regularly to
   assess the hematochemical profile and test the WBC function by ex vivo
   challenge assays. Data were submitted for ANOVA testing using a mixed
   model for repeated measurements that included health status and time and
   their interactions as fixed effects. Compared with CTR cows, KET cows
   had more pronounced activation of the immune system (higher plasma
   concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines, myeloperoxidase, and
   oxidant species, and greater IFN-gamma responses to Mycobacterium
   avium), higher blood concentrations of gamma-glutamyl transferase, and
   lower plasma concentrations of minerals before calving. Higher levels of
   nonesterified fatty acids, BHB, and glucose were detected in KET cows
   than in CTR cows during the dry period. The effect observed during the
   dry period was associated with a reduced dry matter intake, reduced
   plasma glucose, and increased fat mobilization (further increases in
   nonesterified fatty acids and BHB) during early lactation. A reduced
   milk yield was also detected in KET cows compared with CTR. The KET cows
   had an accentuated acute-phase response after calving (with greater
   concentrations of positive acute-phase proteins and lower concentrations
   of retinol than CTR cows) and impaired liver function (higher blood
   concentrations of glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase and bilirubin).
   The WBC of the KET cows, compared with CTR cows, had a reduced response
   to an ex vivo stimulation assay, with lower production of
   proinflammatory cytokines and greater production of lactate. These
   alterations in the WBC could have been driven by the combined actions of
   metabolites related to the mobilization of lipids and the occurrence of
   a transient unresponsive state against stimulation aimed at preventing
   excessive inflammation. The associations identified here in a small
   number of cows in one herd should be investigated in larger studies.},

Abstract = {The continuous flow of billions of birds between Africa and Europe
   creates an ``ecological bridge{''} between physically remote areas.
   Migratory birds fly south from their breeding grounds during late
   summer/fall and fly back in spring. These movements regulate the spread
   of internal and external parasites, as well as pathogens of potential
   public health concern. The aim of the present study was to investigate
   the possible introduction of exotic tick species and tick-borne
   pathogens into Europe via migratory birds. M the bird observatory of
   Ventotene island (Italy), 443 feeding ticks were collected from 249
   birds captured and ringed during their northbound migration in spring
   2013. Each tick was identified by morphological and molecular methods
   and then tested for bacterial and viral pathogens: Borrelia burgdorferi
   s.l., Rickettsia spp., Ehrlichia mminantium and Coxiella burnetii,
   Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) and Flavivirus.
   Morphological and molecular identification confirmed Hyalomma rufipes as
   the most abundant species among the collected arthropods (366/443;
   82.6\%) followed by Hyalomma marginatum (10/433; 2.3\%). Rickettsia
   aeschlimannii was identified in 158 ticks, while one engorged Amblyomma
   variegatum nymph was infected with Rickettsia africae. The other
   bacteria were not detected in any specimen. Among viruses, RNA belonging
   to West Nile virus and other Flavivirus were detected whereas all ticks
   were negative for CCHFV RNA. These results confirm how migratory birds
   play a role in carrying Rickettsia-infected ticks, as well as viruses of
   zoonotic importance, from Africa into Europe. To what extent tick
   species are capable of establishing a permanent population once
   introduced in naive areas, is far from defined and deserve further
   investigation.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND The highly invasive mosquito species Aedes albopictus has
   become a major health concern in temperate areas due to its role as
   vector of exotic arboviruses. Pyrethroid insecticides represent the main
   tools for limiting the circulation of such mosquito-borne viruses. The
   present work aim to extend previous reports on phenotypic
   pyrethroid-resistance in European Ae. albopictus, to identify its
   genetic basis and to monitor the geographical distribution of resistant
   genotypes, with a particular focus on sites experiencing the 2017
   chikungunya outbreak in Italy. RESULTS Bioassays, performed according to
   World Health Organization protocols, showed full susceptibility to
   deltamethrin (concentration = 0.05\%) and varying levels of resistance
   to permethrin (0.75\%) and/or alpha-cypermethrin (0.05\%) across Italy,
   with highest levels in the core of the 2017 chikungunya outbreak.
   Partial genotyping of the VSSC gene revealed widespread distribution of
   V1016G mutation and confirmed its association with pyrethroid
   resistance. CONCLUSION The results obtained show that the condition for
   the spread of pyrethroid resistance in Ae. albopictus in Europe exists
   under strong selective pressure due to intensive insecticide spraying to
   control exotic arbovirus outbreak or high levels of nuisance. The
   results draw attention to the need for an evidence-based implementation
   of mosquito nuisance control, taking insecticide resistance management
   into consideration. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical Industry},

Abstract = {In Italy, veterinary autogenous vaccines manufacturing is regulated by
   the legislative decree of the Ministry of Health, March 17th, 1994, n.
   287. The production is performed by the network of the `Istituti
   Zooprofilattici Sperimentali' (IZSs), public health institutes scattered
   all over the Italian territory. The aim of this research was to evaluate
   the feasibility of an in vitro method to test the abnormal toxicity of
   autogenous bacterial vaccines as an alternative to animal models
   routinely employed. For this purpose, the Istituto Zooprofilattico
   Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise (IZSAM) in partnership with the
   Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia
   Romagna (IZSLER), evaluated the toxicity of 49 batches of autogenous
   bacterial vaccines, previously shown to be safe in guinea pigs and mice,
   on animal model, by means of the methyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. All
   vaccines showed cytotoxic effects when tested 1:2 diluted and undiluted;
   overall, all vaccines lost toxicity at 1:128 dilution. As expected,
   these findings suggest a different susceptibility of this assay compared
   to the laboratory animal model. On the other hand, these results do not
   clarify which components of the vaccines are responsible for the
   cytotoxic effect. Overall, more experiments are warranted in order to
   standardize the MIT assay which could be coupled with the trials in
   laboratory animals.},

Abstract = {Palm oil (PO) is the most widely consumed vegetable oil on the planet.
   PO has a high percent of saturated fatty acids that are not favourable
   to the health. From December 2014, all food items sold in Europe must
   list palm oil in their ingredients if it is in the product. However,
   many food items are declared as PO free, and in the actual regulation
   there are no official methods to verify this statement. Therefore, there
   is a strong need to develop analytical methods for this purpose.
   In this work, screening methods with fast DART-MS analysis and
   confirmatory methods for the determination of PO in food were defined.
   DART-MS analysis with ion trap or high resolution mass spectrometry can
   be used as screening method, meanwhile the determination of both
   tocotrienols and triacylglycerols with HPLC can be used as confirmation
   method. PO addition was detectable up to 1\%.},

Abstract = {Human infections with Brucella melitensis are occasionally reported in
   Sweden, despite the fact that the national flocks of sheep and goats are
   officially free from brucellosis. The aim of our study was to analyze
   103 isolates of B. melitensis collected from patients in Sweden between
   1994 and 2016 and determine their putative geographic origin using whole
   genome sequencing (WGS)-based tools. The majority of the strains were
   assigned to East Mediterranean and African lineages. Both in silico
   Multiple Loci VNTR (Variable Number of Tandem Repeats) Analysis (MLVA)
   and core genome Multilocus Sequence Typing (cgMLST) analyses identified
   countries of the Middle East as the most probable source of origin of
   the majority of the strains. Isolates collected from patients with
   travel history to Iraq or Syria were often associated with genotypes
   from Turkey, as the cgMLST profiles from these countries clustered
   together. Sixty strains were located within a distance of 20 core genes
   to related genotypes from the publicly available database, and for
   eighteen isolates, the closest genotype was different by more than 50
   loci. Our study showed that WGS based tools are effective in tracing
   back the geographic origin of infection of patients with unknown travel
   status, provided that public sequences from the location of the source
   are available.},

Title = {Thermosensitive Nanocomposite Hydrogels for Intravitreal Delivery of
   Cefuroxime},
Journal = {NANOMATERIALS},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Endophthalmitis is a rare, but serious, intravitreal inflammatory
   disorder that can arise after cataract surgery. The intracameral
   injection of 1 mg cefuroxime (CEF) followed by three-times daily
   antibiotic topical administration for a week is generally recognized as
   the routine method of prophylaxis after cataract surgery. This procedure
   is controversial because of both the low efficacy and the low adherence
   to therapy by elderly patients. A unique slow release antibiotic
   intravitreal injection could solve these problems. The objective of the
   present study was to design ophthalmic nanocomposite delivery systems
   based on in situ gelling formulations that undergo sol-to-gel transition
   upon change in temperature to prolong the effect of CEF. Oil in water
   (O/W) microemulsion (mu E) and solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), obtained
   with an innovative formulation technology called cold microemulsion
   dilution, were evaluated as ocular drug delivery systems for CEF. Drug
   entrapment efficiency up to 80\% was possible by esterifying CEF with
   1-dodecanol to obtain dodecyl-CEF (dCEF). Both dCEF-loaded SLN and mu E
   were then added with Pluronic (R) F127 (20\% w/v) to obtain a
   nanocomposite hydrogel-based long acting system. The prepared
   thermosensitive formulations were evaluated for their physical
   appearance, drug content, gelation temperature, injectability and
   rheological properties, in vitro release studies and stability studies.
   Moreover, cell proliferation assays on human retinal pigment epithelial
   ARPE-19 cells were performed to evaluate the influence of this
   innovative system on the cellular viability. In addition, minimal
   inhibitory concentration (MIC) was assessed for both CEF and dCEF,
   revealing the need of dCEF hydrolysis for the antimicrobial activity.
   Although further experimental investigations are required, the
   physico-chemical characterization of the nanocomposite hydrogels and the
   preliminary in vitro release studies highlighted the potential of these
   systems for the sustained release of CEF.},

Title = {Avian pseudotubercolosis in backyard turkeys in the province of Chieti,
   Italy},
Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Introduction - Pseudotubercolosis is a contagious disease of domestic
   and wild animals caused by Yersinia pseudotubercolosis, which can
   affects humans.
   Aim - Since only limited data about turkeys infected by Yersinia
   pseudotubercolosis can be found in literature, we will be describing the
   anatomo-pathological lesions and histopathological results observed in
   turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) during an outbreak occurred in a flock in
   the province of Chieti. The disease in affected turkeys was
   characterized by debility, ruffled feathers, dyspnea, diarrhea, anorexia
   and death in about two weeks from the beginning of the clinical
   symptoms.
   Materials and methods - The outbreak took place between November and
   Januar; in this period, 60 female turkeys about five months old died out
   of the total of 105 (57.14\%) that had been put into the flock in
   August.
   Turkeys were free to move by stable to open area paddock and farmer
   didn't use a pests control plan, even if he noticed the presence of
   roditors in his farm.
   At necropsy, in 5 carcasses examined, splenitis was observed and
   hepatitis with multifocal white protuberant foci of 1-2 mm in diameter
   both in kidneys and in lungs.
   Results and conclusions - The histopathological tests indicated
   granulomatous lesions and extensive areas of tissue necrosis, in some of
   them bacterial agglomerates were present. Similar areas of tissue
   necrosis were observed microscopically in the kidneys and lungs of 3
   turkeys.
   The bacteriological test carried out on liver, spleen, kidney and lungs
   showed the growth of Gram-negative coccobacillus, oxidase-negative,
   catalase positive and the API 20E system identified the isolate as
   Yersinia pseudotubercolosis.
   The isolate showed to be sensitive to some antimicrobials, the animals
   therefore have been subjected to a therapeutic treatment with
   tetracyclines which ended the outbreak.
   Yersinia pseudotuberculosis can infect human beings and cause acute
   enteritis and mesenteric lymphadenitis. People in contact with infected
   animals should use extreme caution and adopt all possible healthcare
   measures to prevent this agent from being transmitted.
   In order to reduce the risk of infection between bred birds and healthy
   carrier animals, it is advisable adopt in the farm sanitary measures
   aimed at preventing contact between them and at avoiding contamination
   of foodstuff and drink water.},

Abstract = {As reported by European Food Safety Authority, the identification of a
   meat product obtained from mechanically separated meat (MSM) has
   significance from a point of view both of food quality and safety. As a
   consequence, it recommended the development of innovative methods for
   identifying a MSM. The electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy is a
   useful tool for identifying previously irradiated meat products
   containing bone. Due to the presence of bone fragments and periosteum
   (bone skin) in MSM, this technique was exploited for developing an
   innovative analytical method for identifying a MSM and quantifying bone
   fragments. This procedure is based on sample irradiation at 1 kGy, after
   proper sample pre-treatment, followed by analysis by ESR spectroscopy.
   This analytical method was validated following a validation protocol
   developed ``in-house{''}. The presence of bone fragments, due to MSM
   addition in the product formulation, lead to the identification of six
   characteristic signals on the ESR spectrum. Among these, three signals
   were always verified in all commercial samples analysed (wurstel),
   composed of different percentages of MSM. The quantitative determination
   of bone fragments was also studied through method validation. Good
   analytical performances were obtained in terms of selectivity, with no
   interfering signals; sensitivity, with LOD and LOQ equal to 16 and 48
   mg/100 g (w/w f.w.), respectively; accuracy, as mean CV \% = 12.8\% and
   mean error \% = 9\%; (n = 18), ruggedness (method applicable to
   different types of meat products), and measurement uncertainty of
   14.6\%, confirming that the procedure can be developed successfully for
   accurate qualitative-quantitative analysis.},

Abstract = {Shelf-life studies in ready-to-eat (RTE) modified atmosphere packaged
   (MAP) precut iceberg lettuce (minimally processed) were carried out in
   order to evaluate the natural microflora of the product and survival or
   multiplication of Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes), taking into
   consideration the impact of the production steps resulting in a
   reduction of the shelf life of the fresh-cut produce, due to the
   accelerated enzymatic activity, moisture loss, and microbial
   proliferation. The research first aimed to evaluate the characteristics
   of the natural microflora of the product, and then, L. monocytogenes
   dynamics were studied via challenge tests. L. monocytogenes
   concentration was studied at 8 and 12 degrees C storage temperature for
   10 days, 6 days longer than their shelf life. The number of L.
   monocytogenes in samples stored both at 8 degrees C and 12 degrees C
   increased gradually, more evidently in samples stored at 12 degrees C.
   L. monocytogenes dynamics were studied to define maximum growth rate (mu
   max) at 8 degrees C (0.0104 log(10)CFU/g/h) and 12 degrees C (0.0183
   log(10)CFU/g/h). Data obtained from the study were used to develop and
   validate a specific predictive model able to predict the behavior of L.
   monocytogenes in RTE MAP iceberg lettuce. According to the model, an
   increase in storage temperature of 6 degrees C (e.g., from 8 to 14
   degrees C) would lead to an increase in L. monocytogenes concentration
   of more than 6 log(10)CFU/g at the 10th day of the challenge test (12th
   days of shelf life). Storage at 4 degrees C allowed to increase L.
   monocytogenes enumeration from 3.30 log(10)CFU/g at D0 to 3.60
   log(10)CFU/g at D10. The model could be applied to microorganisms other
   than L. monocytogenes, modifying the coefficients of the polynomial
   equation on which it is based.},

Abstract = {The presented global retrospective study on human cases of tetrodotoxin
   (TTX) intoxication caused by seafood consumption was aimed at updating
   the relative risk according to seafood product categories (fish,
   gastropods, cephalopods, arthropods) and geographical areas. Overall,
   3032 cases from five continents were collected, mainly from Asia. Over
   half of them were attributed to fish, followed by gastropods, arthropods
   and cephalopods. In South East and East Asia, intoxications derived from
   all the aforesaid seafood product categories, locally sourced; in
   Oceania, Sub-Saharan Africa and Central-South America, intoxication were
   from local pufferfish. In Europe, dated cases were caused by imported
   Asian products, as in North America. However, recent intoxications in
   Spain, Middle East and North Africa, caused by locally caught products,
   confirm the occurrence of TTX even in areas previously not affected by
   this public health issue.},

Abstract = {Mass mortalities due to disease outbreaks have recently affected a
   number of major taxa in marine ecosystems. Climate- and
   pollution-induced stress may compromise host immune defenses, increasing
   the risk of opportunistic diseases. Despite growing evidence that mass
   mortality events affecting marine species worldwide are strongly
   influenced by the interplay of numerous environmental factors, the
   reductionist approaches most frequently used to investigate these
   factors hindered the interpretation of these multifactorial pathologies.
   In this study, we propose a broader approach based on the combination of
   RNA-sequencing and 16S microbiota analyses to decipher the factors
   underlying mass mortality in the striped venus clam, Chamelea gallina,
   along the Adriatic coast. On one hand, gene expression profiling and
   functional analyses of microbial communities showed the over-expression
   of several genes and molecular pathways involved in xenobiotic
   metabolism, suggesting potential chemical contamination in mortality
   sites. On the other hand, the down-regulation of several genes involved
   in immune and stress response, and the over-representation of
   opportunistic pathogens such as Vibrio and Photobacterium spp. indicates
   that these microbial species may take advantage of compromised host
   immune pathways and defense mechanisms that are potentially affected by
   chemical exposure, resulting in periodic mortality events. We propose
   the application of our approach to interpret and anticipate the risks
   inherent in the combined effects of pollutants and microbes on marine
   animals in today's rapidly changing environment.},

Title = {Characterizing Salmonella enterica Serovar Choleraesuis, var.
   Kunzendorf: A Comparative Case Study},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {SEP 20},
Abstract = {Different Salmonella serovars generally display different antigenic
   formulae, but there are some exceptions. For instance, the same
   antigenic formula, 6,7:c:1,5, is shared by Salmonella enterica serovar,
   Paratyphi C, Typhisuis, and Choleraesuis. Moreover, three biotypes have
   been described within the S. Choleraesuis serovar. A distinction among
   such biotypes can only be based on biochemical behaviors (biotyping)
   posing serious concerns when rapid characterization is required. The
   study of an outbreak of severe epizootic salmonellosis in wild boars
   occurred in Italy between 2012 and 2014 and the typing of the isolates
   recovered from the outbreak were used to test different approaches for
   serovar identification. A number of 30 S. Choleraesuis var. Kunzendorf
   isolates from the outbreak were typed by means of four different methods
   to derive serovar and biotype: (i) slide agglutination method followed
   by biochemical tests, (ii) suspension array xMAP (R) Salmonella
   Serotyping Assay (SSA), (iii) whole genome sequencing (WGS) and data
   analysis using SeqSero tool, and (iv) WGS and data analysis using
   Salmonella TypeFinder tool. Slide agglutination, xMAP (R) SSA and WGS,
   followed by SeqSero analysis, are methods that infer the serovars
   according to the White-Kauffmann-Le Minor (WKL) scheme, based
   exclusively on antigens. Using these methods, isolates with incomplete
   antigenic formulae could be misleadingly excluded from an outbreak. On
   the contrary, WGS followed by Salmonella TypeFinder data analysis, which
   predicts the serotype on the basis of Multilocus sequence typing (MLST),
   might be able to cluster together isolates belonging to the same
   outbreak irrespective of the antigenic formula. Results suggest the
   benefit of routine use of a combination of in silico MLST and antigenic
   formula analysis to solve specific ambiguous case studies for outbreak
   investigation purposes.},

Title = {Effects of truck transportation and slaughtering on the occurrence of
   prednisolone and its metabolites in cow urine, liver, and adrenal glands},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Background The recognition of illegal administration of synthetic
   corticosteroids in animal husbandry has been recently challenged by the
   case of prednisolone, whose occasional presence in the urine of bovines
   under strong stressful conditions was attributed to endogenous
   biosynthesis, not to exogenous administration. The study of the natural
   stress sources possibly inducing endogenous prednisolone production
   represents a stimulating investigation subject. The biochemical effects
   of transportation and slaughtering were verified in untreated cows by
   studying the possible occurrence of prednisolone and its metabolites in
   urine, liver and adrenal glands, and the cortisol/cortisone
   quantification. Results Cortisol, cortisone, prednisolone and its
   metabolites were measured in urine, collected at farm under natural
   micturition and then at the slaughterhouse. The study was performed on
   15 untreated cows reared in different farms at the end of their
   productive cycle. 2-3 days after the first urine collection, the animals
   were transported by trucks to the abattoir, slaughtered, and subjected
   to a second urine sampling from the bladder. Specimens of liver and
   adrenal gland were also collected and analysed by means of a liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) validated method. The
   stressful conditions of transportation and slaughtering proved to
   increase considerably the urinary levels of cortisol and cortisone as
   compared to those collected at farm. Prednisolone was detected in the
   urine collected at the slaughterhouse of two cows only, at a
   concentration level (approximate to 0.6 mu g L- 1) largely below the
   official cut off (5.0 mu g L- 1) established to avoid false
   non-compliances. These two animals exhibited the highest urinary
   cortisol levels of the series. Prednisolone and prednisone were also
   detected in the adrenal glands of a different cow. Prednisolone
   metabolites were not detected in any urine, liver, and adrenal gland
   sample. Conclusion Within the constraints of the condition adopted, this
   study confirms the sporadic presence of prednisolone traces (2 samples
   out of 15) and the consistently increased concentration of cortisone and
   cortisol in the urines collected from cows subjected to truck
   transportation and subsequent slaughtering. No prednisolone metabolites
   were detected in any liver and adrenal gland samples, nor in urine
   specimens, unlike what was previously reported for cows artificially
   stressed by pharmacological treatment.},

Title = {Serological survey of canine parvovirus 2 antibody titres in breeding
   kennels in northern Italy},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},

Month = {SEP 18},
Abstract = {Background Current guidelines recommend parvovirus revaccination of
   adult dogs no more frequently than every 3 years. The aim of this study
   was to determine the prevalence of dogs showing protective serum
   antibody titres against canine parvovirus 2 in breeding kennels in
   Northern Italy and to assess the effect of time from vaccination and the
   sex of the dog on antibody titres. The study was carried out on 370
   animals of different breeds kept in 33 breeding kennels. Antibodies to
   canine parvovirus 2 in serum samples were measured with an indirect
   immunoenzymatic assay validated by the manufacturer in relation to the
   `gold standard' haemagglutination inhibition test. The number of months
   that had elapsed since the last vaccination was calculated for each
   animal and categorized into the following classes: < 12 months; 13-24
   months; 25-36 months; 37-48 months; and > 49 months. Results The
   prevalence of `unprotected' dogs was 4.6\%. A satisfactory solid herd
   immunity was present in the majority of breeding kennels, although some
   vaccination failures were detected. A significant negative correlation
   was found between antibody titre and months since last vaccination.
   Comparable antibody titres were found in the first 3 years after
   vaccination. Although the antibody titre over time was not affected by
   the sex of the dog, `unprotected' females had been vaccinated more
   recently than males with analogous low titres. Conclusions Parvovirus
   revaccination of adult dogs every 3 years, as currently recommended, is
   also the appropriate recommendation for breeding kennels. Serological
   tests could be a useful tool to assess the effectiveness of vaccination.},

Title = {Evaluation of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis survival
   during the manufacturing process of Italian raw milk hard cheeses
   (Parmigiano Reggiano and Grana Padano)},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {305},
Month = {SEP 16},
Abstract = {Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), the agent of
   paratuberculosis in ruminants, is suspected to be involved in the
   aetiology of some human diseases. Notably, the consumption of milk and
   dairy products is considered to be the main route of human exposure to
   MAP because of its ability to survive during pasteurization and
   manufacturing processes. The aim of this study was to investigate,
   through a microbiological challenge test, the survival of MAP during the
   manufacturing and ripening period of two Italian hard cheeses,
   Parmigiano Reggiano and Grana Padano, made from raw bovine milk. The
   challenge test was performed in two different phases: the creaming phase
   and the manufacturing phase.
   The creaming phase, which is the first step of cheese production, was
   reproduced in the laboratory employing raw cow's milk spiked with a MAP
   reference strain at a final concentration of 5.58 log(10) CFU/mL. After
   the creaming at 18 degrees C and 27 degrees C for 12 h, a decrease of
   0.80 log(10) and 0.77 log(10) was observed in partially skimmed milk,
   respectively.
   In the second phase, two batches of raw cow's milk (1000 L each) were
   inoculated with MAP reference and wild strains, respectively. Then, the
   entire manufacturing process for Parmigiano Reggiano and Grana Padano,
   both of Protective Designation of Origin (PDO), was reproduced in an
   experimental cheese factory, starting from a concentration in milk of
   5.19 +/- 0.01 and 5.28 +/- 0.08 log(10) CFU/mL of MAP reference and wild
   strains, respectively. Heating the curd at 53 degrees C for 20 min did
   not affect MAP survival, however a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in
   MAP viability was observed during the moulding phase and after salting
   in brine, regarding the wild strains and the reference strain,
   respectively. In addition, a significant decrease was observed during
   the ripening period, at which time the MAP concentration dropped below
   the limit of detection from the second and the third month of ripening,
   for the wild and reference strains, respectively.
   Taking into account the poor data availability about MAP survival in
   hard cheeses, this study may improve the knowledge regarding the effect
   of the cheese manufacturing process on the MAP dynamics, supporting also
   the safety of traditional raw milk hard cheeses.},

Title = {Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma in a boar who lived in Calabria

Abstract = {Mesothelioma is a tumor of the serosal membranes described both in human
   and veterinary medicine. While in humans the relationship between
   mesothelioma and exposure to asbestos and some other asbestiform
   minerals is well known, in animals it is still difficult to establish.
   In this paper a case of malignant peritoneal mesothelioma probably
   related to asbestos exposure in a wild boar is described. At post-mortem
   evaluation the peritoneum, diaphragm and serosal surface of liver and
   kidneys showed isolated to coalescent multiple nodular lesions. Samples
   from diaphragm, liver and lung were collected to perform microbiological
   and histological investigations. To assess the presence of asbestos
   and/or other asbestiform minerals, SEM-EDS investigations were performed
   on organs and soil samples collected from the area where the wild boar
   lived.
   Microbiological investigations were negative for Mycobacterium species.
   Gross and histological examination were compatible with a biphasic
   mesothelioma, with nodules composed of epithelioid and sarcomatoid
   elements with high pleomorphism. Immunohistochemistry revealed only
   multifocal scattered positivity for WT-1 and D2-40. Asbestos fibres were
   detected in all samples (organs and soil) by SEM-EDS, demonstrating a
   potential relationship between the neoplasia and the exposure to
   naturally occurring asbestos (NOA).
   In conclusion, the results of the present study are further confirmation
   that wild animals, such as the boar, are suitable sentinels to indicate
   the risk of environmental exposure to asbestos for human populations.

Title = {Can Insertion Sequences Proliferation Influence Genomic Plasticity?
   Comparative Analysis of Acinetobacter baumannii Sequence Type 78, a
   Persistent Clone in Italian Hospitals},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 12},
Abstract = {Acinetobacter baumannii is a known opportunistic pathogen, dangerous for
   public health mostly due to its ability to rapidly acquire
   antibiotic-resistance traits. Its genome was described as characterized
   by remarkable plasticity, with a high frequency of homologous
   recombinations and proliferation of Insertion Sequences (IS). The SMAL
   pulsotype is an A. baumannii strain currently isolated only in Italy,
   characterized by a low incidence and a high persistence over the years.
   In this present work, we have conducted a comparative genomic analysis
   on this clone. The genome of 15 SMAL isolates was obtained and
   characterized in comparison with 24 other assemblies of evolutionary
   related isolates. The phylogeny highlighted the presence of a
   monophyletic Glade (named ST78A), which includes the SMAL isolates.
   ST78A isolates have a low rate of homologous recombination and low gene
   content variability when compared to two related clades (ST78B and ST49)
   and to the most common A. baumannii variants worldwide (International
   Clones I and II). Remarkably, genomes in the ST78A Glade present a high
   number of IS, including classes mostly absent in the other related
   genomes. Among these IS, one copy of IS66 was found to interrupt the
   gene comEC/rec2, involved in the acquisition of exogenous DNA. The
   genomic characterization of SMAL isolates shed light on the surprisingly
   low genomic plasticity and the high IS proliferation present in this
   strain. The interruption of the gene comEC/rec2 by an IS in the SMAL
   genomes brought us to formulate an evolutionary hypothesis according to
   which the proliferation of IS is slowing the acquisition of exogenous
   DNA, thus limiting genome plasticity. Such genomic architecture could
   explain the epidemiological behavior of high persistence and low
   incidence of the clone and provides an interesting framework to compare
   ST78 with the highly epidemic International Clones, characterized by
   high genomic plasticity.},

   post-weaning piglets (7748 g +/- 643 g) were randomly allocated to four
   groups: control basal diet (CO); CO + 1.28 x 10(6) CFU/g of B.
   amyloliquefaciens (BAA); CO + 1.28 x 10(6) CFU/g feed of B. subtilis
   (BAS); CO + 1 g colistin/kg of feed (AB). At day (d) 7, animals were
   challenged with 10(5) CFU/mL of ETEC F4ac O149 and then followed for
   fecal score and performance until d 21. Blood was collected at d 6, d 12
   and d 21 for immunoglobulins, at d 8 for acute phase proteins, at d 8
   and d 21 for metabolomics analysis. Jejunum was sampled for morphometry,
   quantification of apoptosis, cell proliferation, neutral and acid mucine
   and IgA secretory cells, and microarray analysis at d 21. Jejunum and
   cecum contents were collected for microbiota at d 21. Results AB and BAS
   reduced the fecal score impairment compared to CO (P < 0.05) at d 14.
   Body weight (BW), average daily weight gain (ADWG), average daily feed
   intake (ADFI) and gain to feed ratio (G:F) did not differ between
   Bacillus groups and CO. AB improved BW at d 7, d 14 and d 21, ADWG ADFI
   and G:F from d 0 to d 7 (P < 0.05). At d 8, CO had higher plasma
   arginine, lysine, ornithine, glycine, serine and threonine than other
   groups, and higher haptoglobin than AB (P < 0.05). At d 21, CO had lower
   blood glycine, glutamine and IgA than BAS. Morphology, cells apoptosis
   and mucins did not differ. BAS and AB increased the villus mitotic
   index. Transcriptome profile of BAS and AB were more similar than CO.
   Gene sets related to adaptive immune response were enriched in BAA, BAS
   and AB. CO had enriched gene set for nuclear structure and RNA
   processing. CO had a trend of higher Enterobacteriaceae in cecum than
   the other groups (P = 0.06). Conclusion Bacillus subtilis DSM25841
   treatment may reduce ETEC F4ac infection in weaned piglets, decreasing
   diarrhea and influencing mucosal transcriptomic profile.},

Abstract = {Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a predator micro-organism towards other
   Gram-negative bacteria. We tested B. bacteriovorus to control
   Escherichia coli growth on chicken slices and canned beef. Moreover, we
   analysed B. bacteriovorus's lytic ability on eight toxigenic or
   multidrug-resistant E. coli strains. In chicken slices, the predator
   induced the highest prey reduction (4.3 log) respect to control at 6 h.
   In canned beef, the predator induced the highest prey reduction (2.1
   log) respect to control at 6 h. Moreover, B. bacteriovorus showed lytic
   ability towards all tested E. coli strains. B. bacteriovorus could
   control E. coli and other pathogenic and spoilage bacteria in those
   meat-based foods that have a shelf life <10 days. It could integrate
   modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) to prolong the shelf life and
   improve the safety of pre-packed fresh meat, meat preparations and meat
   products. In future applications on meat-based foods, B. bacteriovorus
   could also minimise the use of additives.},

Abstract = {A rapid and simple procedure to detect irradiated food containing fat is
   proposed. This method is based on HS-SPME coupled with GC-MS to
   determine the presence of a radiolytic product in irradiated meats:
   2-dodecylcyclobutanone (2-DCB) and is proposed as an alternative to EN
   1785:2003, which is a long and complex procedure. The qualitative
   confirmation method is validated on different type of meats: chicken,
   turkey, duck, beef, pork on both nonirradiated and irradiated samples at
   different dose levels (0.05, 0.12, 0.5, 1.0 and 3.0 kGy) with a
   biological X-ray irradiator. The validation parameters investigated are
   selectivity, minimum dose level (MDL), limit of detection (LOD),
   sensitivity and specificity. The MDL and LOD values were 0.5 kGy and 5.0
   ng mL(-1), respectively, for all matrices. No false positives or false
   negatives occurred, and 100\% of samples were correctly identified. The
   results show that HS-SPME GC-MS is suitable for routine analysis.},

Abstract = {Background Felid herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1)-associated dermatitis is
   characterized by facial and nasal involvement; clinical and
   histopathological manifestations may overlap with other dermatitides.
   Objective To evaluate the realibility of qRT-PCR-2(-)(Delta Delta C)(q)
   and RNAscope in situ hybridization (RNA-ISH) methods to diagnose
   FHV-1-associated dermatitis, in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
   tissues. Animals Sixteen FFPE samples from cats with facial dermatitis
   and four controls were studied. Methods and materials Based on
   histopathological features, cases were separated into: Group 1, samples
   with herpetic dermatitis (four); Group 2, samples with nonherpetic
   facial dermatitis (six); Group 3, samples with facial dermatitis of
   ambiguous nature (allergic or viral) (six); and Group 4, samples from
   healthy cats (four). A relative quantification using the 2(-)(Delta
   Delta C)(q) method was used to estimate the ``upregulation{''} of each
   FHV-1 target viral gene copies (glycoprotein-B and thymidine-kinase)
   relative to reference gene. Detection of FHV-1 mRNA was performed using
   the RNAscope 2.5 detection kit. Results By 2(-)(Delta Delta C)(q)
   analysis, upregulation of both FHV-1 genes was observed in all samples
   from Group 1 and two of six from Group 3. No upregulation was identified
   in samples from groups 2 and 4. Positive mRNA hybridization signal was
   observed in all cases from Group 1 and two cases of Group 3. No
   positivity was observed in samples from groups 2 and 4. Conclusions and
   clinical importance QRT-PCR 2(-Delta Delta Cq) analysis and RNA-ISH can
   identify the FHV-1 genome as causative agent of the associated
   dermatitis, even where inclusion bodies are not detectable. Both
   techniques are functional in retrospective studies, have greater
   specificity than conventional PCR, and may be proposed for research and
   diagnostic purposes.},

Abstract = {Despite some researchers reporting clinical signs in cattle associated
   with Trypanosoma theileri, its role as a pathogen is still unclear. We
   describe here the isolation of Trypanosoma theileri during a routine
   laboratory investigation. Mature and immature vital parasitic forms were
   observed within hematopoietic cell cultures from the bone marrow of one
   cow for monocyte isolation. The animal was submitted to clinical
   examination and blood sample counting (CBC). Postmortem analysis
   included gross and histological examination and PCR in the liver,
   spleen, brain, lymph nodes, and lungs. PCR and Giemsa staining were used
   for parasite identification. A second cow belonging to the same farm was
   positive for Trypanosoma theileri by PCR performed on blood sample. In
   this case, the postmortem analysis included also testis. Clinical
   examination showed only a reduction in body weight in both cases. The
   CBC revealed an increase of lymphocytes and neutrophils while red blood
   cells were within the normal range. Spleen was slightly increased in
   volume and the histology revealed a proliferative activity of the white
   and red pulp. The biomolecular analysis identified the parasite as
   Trypanosoma theileri and its DNA was detected in the bone marrow,
   testis, and brain. The unusual finding of parasite in the brain, testis,
   and bone marrow raises new clinical implication on disease course and
   also possible sexual transmission.},

Abstract = {The `learning-by-doing' EU-FORA fellowship programme in the development
   of risk assessment tools based on molecular typing and WGS of
   Campylobacter jejuni genome was structured into two main activities: the
   primary one focused on training on risk assessment methodology and the
   secondary one in starting and enhancing the cooperation between the
   hosting and home organisations, or other joint activities. The primary
   activities had three subsequent work packages (WPs): WP1 data
   organisation, WP2 cluster and association analyses, and WP3 development
   of risk assessment models. The secondary activities have branched into
   one workshop and the initiation of a cooperation programme between the
   hosting and home organisations. In the last quarter, the fellow had
   contributed to the characterisation of some pathogens in possible
   response to a changing climate, part of the CLEFSA project. The fellow
   attended various forms of training: online and on-site courses, and also
   participated at several conferences and meetings for improving his
   knowledge and skills, contributing to performing the Campylobacter risk
   assessment and source attribution. (C) 2019 European Food Safety

Title = {Cyclin-CDK Complexes are Key Controllers of Capacitation-Dependent Actin
   Dynamics in Mammalian Spermatozoa},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {20},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Mammalian spermatozoa are infertile immediately after ejaculation and
   need to undergo a functional maturation process to acquire the
   competence to fertilize the female egg. During this process, called
   capacitation, the actin cytoskeleton dramatically changes its
   organization. First, actin fibers polymerize, forming a network over the
   anterior part of the sperm cells head, and then it rapidly depolymerizes
   and disappears during the exocytosis of the acrosome content (the
   acrosome reaction (AR)). Here, we developed a computational model
   representing the actin dynamics (AD) process on mature spermatozoa. In
   particular, we represented all the molecular events known to be involved
   in AD as a network of nodes linked by edges (the interactions). After
   the network enrichment, using an online resource (STRING), we carried
   out the statistical analysis on its topology, identifying the
   controllers of the system and validating them in an experiment of
   targeted versus random attack to the network. Interestingly, among them,
   we found that cyclin-dependent kinase (cyclin-CDK) complexes are acting
   as stronger controllers. This finding is of great interest since it
   suggests the key role that cyclin-CDK complexes could play in
   controlling AD during sperm capacitation, leading us to propose a new
   and interesting non-genomic role for these molecules.},

Title = {Optimal control of epidemic size and duration with limited resources},
Journal = {MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {315},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The total number of infections (epidemic size) and the time needed for
   the infection to go extinct (epidemic duration) represent two of the
   main indicators for the severity of infectious disease epidemics in
   human and livestock. However, few attempts have been made to address the
   problem of minimizing at the same time the epidemic size and duration
   from a theoretical point of view by using optimal control theory. Here,
   we investigate the multi-objective optimal control problem aiming to
   minimize, through either vaccination or isolation, a suitable
   combination of epidemic size and duration when both maximum control
   effort and total amount of resources available during the entire
   epidemic period are limited. Application of Pontryagin's Maximum
   Principle to a Susceptible-Infected-Removed epidemic model, shows that,
   when the resources are not sufficient to maintain the maximum control
   effort for the entire duration of the epidemic, the optimal vaccination
   control admits only bang-bang solutions with one or two switches, while
   the optimal isolation control admits only bang-bang solutions with one
   switch. We also find that, especially when the maximum control effort is
   low, there may exist a trade-off between the minimization of the two
   objectives. Consideration of this conflict among objectives can be
   crucial in successfully tackling real-world problems, where different
   stakeholders with potentially different objectives are involved.
   Finally, the particular case of the minimum time optimal control problem
   with limited resources is discussed.},

Title = {Limited Exchange of Salmonella Among Domestic Pigs and Wild Boars in
   Italy},
Journal = {ECOHEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {420-428},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The study assessed Salmonella carriage in wild boars (Sus scrofa) and
   compared their isolates with those recovered from the domestic swine
   population of the same area of northern Italy (Emilia-Romagna),
   characterized by intensive pig farming and rather high density of wild
   boars. A total of 189 wild boars hunted during twelve months (2017-2018)
   were tested for Salmonella in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and faecal
   samples. Antimicrobial resistance of recovered strains was tested
   against 14 antimicrobials. Salmonella was detected in 33/189 wild boars
   (17.5\%), specifically from 30/189 MLN (15.9\%) and 6/189 faecal samples
   (3.2\%). Three animals were positive in both samples. Thirteen
   Salmonella serovars were identified, i.e. Typhimurium (the most common),
   Bovismorbificans, Coeln, Derby, Enteritidis, Gaminara, Hessarek,
   Houtenae IV, Kottbus, Napoli, Stanleyville, Thompson and Veneziana.
   Salmonella carriage was higher in warm than in cold months (P = 0.0013).
   Pregnancy status was never associated with Salmonella carriage, with
   significant difference in the recovery of the pathogen between
   non-pregnant and pregnant females (P = 0.003). Only one resistance
   pattern to streptomycin and tetracycline was found in 15 isolates
   (41.7\%) belonging to Typhimurium (14/14; 100\%) and Kottbus (1/3;
   33.3\%) serovars. Overlap with isolates from farmed pigs was limited at
   serotype level (Typhimurium, Derby, Enteritis, Bovismorbificans,
   Kottbus) and absent at PFGE level, and also antimicrobial resistance
   patterns were substantially different. This evidence indicates a
   substantial segregation of the two animal populations with regard to
   infectious contacts, possibly suggesting that biosecurity measures in
   place at industrial farm level limit the exchange of Salmonella.},

Title = {Mercury Detection in Benthic and Pelagic Fish Collected from Western
   Sicily (Southern Italy)},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Simple Summary In highly polluted water, fish can accumulate Hg at
   concentrations that cause risk to human health. This has occurred in
   Sicily (Southern Italy), where there is activity from the petrochemical
   pole. In this paper, we present concentrations of mercury in 14 fish
   species collected from western Sicilian coasts in 2013. A significant
   difference was found between fish species examined but not between
   pelagic and benthic fish. Four out of 130 analyzed samples showed
   mercury concentrations over the European limits. In highly polluted
   water, fish can accumulate mercury up to a concentration of 10 mgKg(-1).
   This has occurred on the eastern coasts of Sicily (Southern Italy),
   probably due to the intense industrial activity of this area. However,
   little is known about Hg accumulation in fish of the western Sicilian
   coasts. In this work, we examined the Hg accumulation of 108 fish
   samples belonging to 14 species collected from western Sicilian coasts
   using a direct mercury analyzer. The samples showed a mean mercury
   concentration of 0.165 +/- 0.22 mg kg(-1) with a maximum in Lepidopus
   caudatus (1.72 mgKg(-1)), exceeding the limits provided by EC Reg.
   1881/2006. The lowest Hg levels were found in Sparus aurata samples
   (0.001 mgKg(-1)). A significant difference was found between the fish
   species examined (p < 0.05). The comparison between benthic and pelagic
   species did not show statistical differences (p < 0.05). Fish food
   constitutes the main route of Hg uptake for humans. Only four of the 130
   samples examined reached a mercury concentration over the European
   limits. The comparative analysis of Hg pollution for benthic and pelagic
   species did not confirm a different trend in metal contamination.},

Abstract = {Rabbits in groups of eight were fed for nine weeks with diets containing
   linseed, rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (LS), linseed plus hazelnut
   skins, with antioxidant function (LS+HS), or palm oil, rich in saturated
   fatty acids (PO). The aim of this work was to compare the effects of
   aforementioned diets on serum biochemical parameters related to
   nutritional and inflammatory status, immune function and oxidative
   balance {[}triglycerides, cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
   aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lysozyme, reactive oxygen species and
   antioxidant power, respectively]. At the end of the study redox
   imbalance (with a significant increase in oxidative stress and decrease
   in antioxidant defenses) was greatest in rabbits fed the LS diet
   (without additional antioxidant protection) compared to the other two
   groups (P <0.05). Also the blood value of lysozyme, an immune parameter
   linked to inflammatory phenomena, was greater in the LS compared to the
   other two groups (P <0.05). ALT remained unchanged in all three groups,
   while a significant increase in AST, triglycerides, and cholesterol was
   noted in the group fed the PO diet as compared to the other two groups

   Italys largest poultry companies, accounting for around 30\% of national
   poultry production, to identify trends and risk factors for AMU.
   Methods: Antimicrobial treatments administered to 5827 broiler and 1264
   turkey grow-out cycles in 201517 were expressed as DDDs for animals per
   population correction unit (DDDvet/PCU). A retrospective analysis was
   conducted to examine the effect of geographical area, season and
   prescribing veterinarian on AMU. Management and structural interventions
   implemented by the company were also assessed.
   Results: AMU showed a 71\% reduction in broilers (from 14 to 4
   DDDvet/PCU) and a 56\% reduction in turkeys (from 41 to 18 DDDvet/PCU)
   during the study period. Quinolones, macrolides and polymyxins decreased
   from 33\% to 6\% of total AMU in broilers, and from 56\% to 32\% in
   turkeys. Broiler cycles during spring and winter showed significantly
   higher AMU, as well as those in densely populated poultry areas.
   Different antimicrobial prescribing behaviour was identified among
   veterinarians.
   Conclusions: This study evidenced a decreasing trend in AMU and
   identified several correlates of AMU in broilers and turkeys. These
   factors will inform the design of interventions to further reduce AMU
   and therefore counteract antimicrobial resistance in these poultry
   sectors.},

Abstract = {Equine infectious anaemia (EIA) is a disease with an almost worldwide
   distribution, with several outbreaks having been reported recently in
   European countries. In Italy, two regions, Lazio and Abruzzo, are
   considered as endemic areas for this disease. In nature, the EIA virus
   is mechanically transmitted by biting flies such as tabanids (Diptera:
   Tabanidae), although few studies have investigated the epidemiological
   implications. In the present study, several sites characterized by
   different levels of EIA prevalence were sampled. In sites with high
   tabanid populations, a seasonal succession of tabanid species with a
   dual-peak corresponding to early active species (i.e. in June to July)
   and late active species (i.e. in August to September) was clearly
   observed. Moreover, a positive correlation was found between EIA
   prevalence and tabanid abundance and species richness, suggesting that
   tabanid diversity might extend the duration of the seasonal transmission
   period of EIA. Further observations are required to better assess how
   vector diversity influence EIA transmission.},

Abstract = {Hepatitis E is an emerging disease in industrialized countries. The
   food-borne transmission of hepatitis E virus (HEV) is associated
   principally with products derived from the domestic pig, the wild boar,
   and deer; however, few quantitative data are available on HEV loads in
   animals used in food production. This study assessed HEV occurrence,
   viral load and genetic variability in wild boar hunted for domestic
   consumption in the district of Viterbo (Central Italy) where high
   anti-HEV IgG seroprevalence values are reported in humans. A total of
   332 liver and 69 intestine samples were obtained from wild boar hunted
   between 2011 and 2014. The liver tissue in 54 of the animals (16.3\%)
   was HEV-positive. Viral loads in quantifiable liver samples (n=29)
   ranged between 3.2x10(2) and 3.8x10(5) genome copies (g.c.)/g with a
   mean value of 1.85x10(4) g.c./g. A statistically significant positive
   correlation was found between viral concentration in liver and
   intestinal tissue, though mean viral load in the intestines was lower
   (3.13x10(3) g.c./g). Twenty-six samples were characterized molecularly
   as genotype 3 (G3) and four subtypes (a, c, f and l) were detected.
   Finally, twelve samples with near identical sequences were identified as
   G3 but could not be assigned to any of the known subtypes, and could
   therefore represent a potentially new subtype.},

Abstract = {Vespa velutina Lepeletier, 1836 (Hymenoptera: Vespidae), the
   yellow-legged hornet, is a social wasp native to North of India, China
   and tropical and subtropical areas of Southeast Asia. Adults are
   predators of a wide variety of arthropods, including honey bees. Vespa
   velutina has been unintentionally introduced in southwestern France
   before 2004 and its widely spreading across the country was followed by
   an impressive colonization of several areas within mainland Europe and
   overseas. In Italy, V. velutina has been officially reported in June
   2013 in Imperia province, Liguria region (northern Italy) and is now
   well established in the western part of this region and occasionally
   reported in Piedmont region. More recently, it has been spotted in
   Veneto, Lombardy and Tuscany regions. In order to investigate the
   phylogenetic relationships and the origin of Italian V. velutina
   nigrithorax specimens, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of
   thirty-three samples, collected in 2012, 2016, 2017 and 2018 from
   different sites (Veneto, Piedmont and Liguria regions) based on
   mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene sequence
   analysis. The phylogenetic analysis as well the haplotypes study
   confirmed the placement of 33 Italian specimens within a cluster
   containing the other European samples plus Chinese specimens collected
   in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Our results strongly supported the view that
   the Italian specimens of V. velutina nigrithorax derived from the
   spreading southward of the V. velutina nigrithorax population initially
   established in France, which is also moving northward (Belgium, The
   Netherlands, Germany, United Kingdom). Graphic abstract},

Title = {Novel avian metaavulavirus isolated from birds of the family Columbidae
   in Taiwan},
Journal = {VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {236},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Avian paramyxoviruses (APMVs) consist of twenty known species and have
   been isolated from domestic and wild birds around the world. In 2009,
   the isolate APMV/dove/Taiwan/AHRI33/2009 was isolated from swabs of red
   turtle doves (Streptopelia tranquebarica) during active surveillance of
   avian influenza in resident birds in Taiwan, and it was initially
   identified as paramyxovirus based on electron microscopy.
   Hemagglutination inhibition assays indicated antigenic heterogeneity of
   AHRI33 with the known APMV-1, -2, -3, -4, -6, -8, and -9 species, only
   showing weak but measurable cross-reactivity with APMV-7. Pathogenicity
   ICPI test revealed that the virus was avirulent for chickens. The AHRI33
   virus genome revealed a typical APMV structure consisting of six genes
   3'-NP-P-M-F-HN-L-5', and the length of the genome was 16,914
   nucleotides, the third longest among the members of the subfamily
   Avulavirinae. Estimates of the nucleotide sequence identities of the
   genome between each prototype of APMVs had shown AHRI33 to be more
   closely related to APMV-7 than to the others, with a sequence identity
   of 62.8\%. Based on topology of the phylogenetic tree of RdRp genes and
   the branch length between the nearest node and the tip of the branch,
   AHRI33 met the criteria for designation as distinct species. Together,
   the data suggest that the isolate APMV/dove/Taiwan/AHRI33/2009 should be
   considered as the prototype strain of the new species Avian
   metaavulavirus 21 in the genus Metaavulavirus in the subfamily
   Avulavirinae.},

Title = {Associations between antimicrobial use and the faecal resistome on

Abstract = {Objectives: To determine associations between farm-and flock-level
   antimicrobial usage (AMU), farmbiosecurity status and the abundance of
   faecal antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) on broiler farms.
   Methods: In the cross-sectional pan-European EFFORT study, conventional
   broiler farms were visited and faeces, AMU information and biosecurity
   records were collected. The resistomes of pooled faecal samples were
   determined by metagenomic analysis for 176 farms. A meta-analysis
   approach was used to relate total and classspecific ARGs (expressed as
   fragments per kb reference per million bacterial fragments, FPKM) to AMU
   (treatment incidence per DDD, TIDDDvet) per country and subsequently
   across all countries. In a similar way, the association between
   biosecurity status (Biocheck. UGent) and the resistome was explored.
   Results: Sixty-six (38\%) flocks did not report group treatments but
   showed a similar resistome composition and roughly similar ARG levels to
   antimicrobial-treated flocks. Nevertheless, we found significant
   positive associations between beta-lactam, tetracycline, macrolide and
   lincosamide, trimethoprim and aminoglycoside antimicrobial flock
   treatments and ARG clusters conferring resistance to the same class.
   Similar associations were found with purchased products. In gene-level
   analysis for beta-lactams and macrolides, lincosamides and
   streptogramins, a significant positive association was found with the
   most abundant gene clusters blaTEM and erm(B). Little evidence was found
   for associations with biosecurity.
   Conclusions: The faecal microbiome in European broilers contains a high
   diversity of ARGs, even in the absence of current antimicrobial
   selection pressure. Despite this, the relative abundance of genes and
   the composition of the resistome is positively related to AMU in
   European broiler farms for several antimicrobial classes.},

Title = {Effect of Chestnut Tannins and Short Chain Fatty Acids as

Journal = {ANIMALS},

Abstract = {Simple Summary The poultry industry needs to replace antibiotics with
   natural or synthetic compounds able to overcome problems linked to the
   development of bacterial resistance. Tannins and short chain fatty acids
   are valid alternatives to contrast the growth of pathogens. However,
   tannins may induce detrimental effects on animal performances,
   especially in monogastrics, causing damage on gut villi. In contrast,
   short chain fatty acids are very efficient in influencing positively the
   morphology of small intestine wall. Hence, the aim of this trial was to
   develop a feeding strategy for broiler rearing, based on the use of
   chestnut tannins and short chain fatty acids administered as blends. No
   differences in animal performances or in meat quality were found among
   feeding groups. The results suggested that the mix of these supplements
   did not have negative effects on the productive performances,
   representing a promising alternative to antibiotics. However, further
   investigation is needed to better understand the effects of these
   supplements on animals in stress conditions. Chestnut tannins (CT) and
   saturated short medium chain fatty acids (SMCFA) are valid alternatives
   to contrast the growth of pathogens in poultry rearing, representing a
   valid alternative to antibiotics. However, the effect of their blends
   has never been tested. Two blends of CT extract and Sn1-monoglycerides
   of SMCFA (SN1) were tested in vitro against the proliferation of
   Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella typhymurium, Escherichia coli,
   Campylobacter jejuni. The tested concentrations were: 3.0 g/kg of CT;
   3.0 g/kg of SN1; 2.0 g/kg of CT and 1.0 g/kg of SN1; 1.0 g/kg of CT and
   2.0 g/kg of SN1. Furthermore, their effect on broiler performances and
   meat quality was evaluated in vivo: one-hundred Ross 308 male birds were
   fed a basal diet with no supplement (control group) or supplemented with
   CT or SN1 or their blends at the same concentration used in the in vitro
   trial. The in vitro assay confirmed the effectiveness of the CT and SN1
   mixtures in reducing the growth of the tested bacteria while the in vivo
   trial showed that broiler performances, animal welfare and meat quality
   were not negatively affected by the blends, which could be a promising
   alternative in replacing antibiotics in poultry production.},

Abstract = {In recent years, several cases of predation on hunting dogs have been
   reported in Italy. These cases caused uproar among owners and the wolf
   was singled out as the culprit. The remains of a dog allegedly killed by
   wolves were submitted for forensic analysis. Wolf predation was ruled
   out based on gross findings and wild boar aggression was suspected
   instead. Genetic analysis of salivary swab samples confirmed that wild
   boars fed on the dog. As poaching is one of the main threats to wolf
   conservation, it is essential to identify correctly the predator in
   cases of attacks on domestic animals.},

Title = {Unveiling hakarl: A study of the microbiota of the traditional Icelandic
   fermented fish},
Journal = {FOOD MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {82},
Pages = {560-572},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Hakarl is produced by curing of the Greenland shark (Somniosus
   microcephalus) flesh, which before fermentation is toxic due to the high
   content of trimethylamine (TMA) or trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO).
   Despite its long history of consumption, little knowledge is available
   on the microbial consortia involved in the fermentation of this fish. In
   the present study, a polyphasic approach based on both culturing and
   DNA-based techniques was adopted to gain insight into the microbial
   species present in ready-to-eat hakarl. To this aim, samples of
   ready-to-eat hakarl were subjected to viable counting on different
   selective growth media. The DNA directly extracted from the samples was
   further subjected to Polymerase Chain Reaction-Denaturing Gradient Gel
   Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and 16S amplicon-based sequencing. Moreover,
   the presence of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed via qualitative real-time PCR
   assays. pH values measured in the analyzed samples ranged from between
   8.07 +/- 0.06 and 8.76 +/- 0.00. Viable counts revealed the presence of
   total mesophilic aerobes, lactic acid bacteria and Pseudomonadaceae.
   Regarding bacteria, PCR-DGGE analysis highlighted the dominance of close
   relatives of Tissierella creatinophila. For amplicon sequencing, the
   main operational taxonomic units (OTUs) shared among the data set were
   Tissierella, Pseudomonas, Oceanobacillus, Abyssivirga and Lactococcus.
   The presence of Pseudomonas in the analyzed samples supports the
   hypothesis of a possible role of this microorganism on the
   detoxification of shark meat from TMAO or TMA during fermentation.
   Several minor OTUs (< 1\%) were also detected, including
   Alkalibacterium, Staphylococcus, Proteiniclasticum, Acinetobacter,
   Erysipelothrix, Anaerobacillus, Ochrobactrum, Listeria and
   Photobacterium. Analysis of the yeast and filamentous fungi community
   composition by PCR-DGGE revealed the presence of close relatives of
   Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, Candida
   zeylanoides, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Debaryomyces, Torulaspora,
   Yamadazyma, Sporobolomyces, Alternaria, Cladosporium tenuissimum,
   Moristroma quercinum and Phoma/Epicoccum, and some of these species
   probably play key roles in the development of the sensory qualities of
   the end product. Finally, qualitative real-time PCR assays revealed the
   absence of STEC and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in all of the analyzed
   samples.},

Abstract = {Residues of antibiotics used in food-producing animals can be excreted
   in milk, affecting the technological performance of starter lactic acid
   bacteria (SLAB). SLAB development and acidification performance was
   studied in thermised ovine milk spiked with oxytetracycline (OTC) at
   maximum residue limit (MRL, 100 mu g kg(-1)), during the early
   acidification phase. Late milk acidification and lower lactic acid
   concentration revealed an antibiotic effect mainly after 6 and 7 h from
   inoculation, with a 6 h delay to reach pH 5.6; the delay in SLAB
   development was observed by BactoScan (TM), while viable counts were not
   affected. Real-time PCR evidenced OTC effect for Streptococcus
   thermophilus and Lactobacillus helveticus, not for Lactobacillus
   delbrueckii subsp. lactis. A statistically significant impact of the
   antibiotic was observed, even at the maximum residue limit, with
   possible repercussions in technological processing and in human health,
   due to an increase of its concentration in cheese. (C) 2019 Elsevier

Abstract = {Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is the cause of an economically
   important highly contagious disease of poultry, and vaccines are
   regarded as the most beneficial interventions for its prevention. In
   this study, plants were used to produce a recombinant chimeric IBDV
   antigen for the formulation of an innovative subunit vaccine. The fusion
   protein (PD-FcY) was designed to combine the immunodominant projection
   domain (PD) of the viral structural protein VP2 with the constant region
   of avian IgY (FcY), which was selected to enhance antigen uptake by
   avian immune cells. The gene construct encoding the fusion protein was
   transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana plants and an
   extraction/purification protocol was set up, allowing to reduce the
   contamination by undesired plant compounds/proteins. Mass spectrometry
   analysis of the purified protein revealed that the glycosylation pattern
   of the FcY portion was similar to that observed in native IgY, while in
   vitro assays demonstrated the ability of PD-FcY to bind to the avian
   immunoglobulin receptor CHIR-AB1. Preliminary immunization studies
   proved that PD-FcY was able to induce the production of protective
   anti-IBDV-VP2 antibodies in chickens. In conclusion, the proposed fusion
   strategy holds promises for the development of innovative low-cost
   subunit vaccines for the prevention of avian viral diseases.},

Abstract = {Using next-generation sequencing, we obtained for the first time a
   complete mitochondrial DNA genome from a museum specimen of the extinct
   wolf (Canis lupus) population of the island of Sicily (Italy).
   Phylogenetic analyses indicated that this genome, which was aligned with
   a number of historical and extant wolf and dog mitogenomes sampled
   worldwide, was closely related to an Italian wolf mtDNA genome (the
   observed proportion of nucleotide sites at which the two sequences are
   different was p = 0.0012), five to seven times shorter than divergence
   among Sicilian and any other known wolf mtDNA genomes (p range = 0.0050
   - 0.0070). Sicilian and Italian mitogenomes joined a basal clade
   belonging to the mtDNA haplogroup-2 of ancient western European wolf
   populations (Pilot et al., 2010). Bayesian calibration of divergence
   times indicated that this clade coalesced at MRCA = 13.400 years (with
   95\% HPD = 4000 - 21.230 years). These findings suggest that wolves
   probably colonized Sicily from southern Italy towards the end of the
   last Pleistocene glacial maximum when the Strait of Messina was almost
   totally dry. Additional mtDNA and genomic data will further clarify the
   origin and population dynamics before the extinction of wolves in
   Sicily. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier GmbH on behalf of Deutsche

Title = {Melatonin Effects on Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Are Related to

Journal = {CELLS},

Abstract = {Melatonin, an indole produced by pineal and extrapineal tissues, but
   also taken with a vegetarian diet, has strong anti-oxidant,
   anti-inflammatory and anti-obesogenic potentials. Non-alcoholic fatty
   liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic side of the metabolic syndrome.
   NAFLD is a still reversible phase but may evolve into steatohepatitis
   (NASH), cirrhosis and carcinoma. Currently, an effective therapy for
   blocking NAFLD staging is lacking. Silent information regulator 1
   (SIRT1), a NAD+ dependent histone deacetylase, modulates the energetic
   metabolism in the liver. Micro-RNA-34a-5p, a direct inhibitor of SIRT1,
   is an emerging indicator of NAFLD grading. Thus, here we analyzed the
   effects of oral melatonin against NAFLD and underlying molecular
   mechanisms, focusing on steatosis, ER stress, mitochondrial shape and
   autophagy. Male C57BL/6J (WT) and SIRT1 heterozygous (HET) mice were
   placed either on a high-fat diet (58.4\% energy from lard) (HFD) or on a
   standard maintenance diet (8.4\% energy from lipids) for 16 weeks,
   drinking melatonin (10 mg/kg) or not. Indirect calorimetry, glucose
   tolerance, steatosis, inflammation, ER stress, mitochondrial changes,
   autophagy and microRNA-34a-5p expression were estimated. Melatonin
   improved hepatic metabolism and steatosis, influenced ER stress and
   mitochondrial shape, and promoted autophagy in WT HFD mice. Conversely,
   melatonin was ineffective in HET HFD mice, maintaining NASH changes.
   Indeed, autophagy was inconsistent in HET HFD or starved mice, as
   indicated by LC3II/LC3I ratio, p62/SQSTM1 and autophagosomes estimation.
   The beneficial role of melatonin in dietary induced NAFLD/NASH in mice
   was related to reduced expression of microRNA-34a-5p and sterol
   regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP1) but only in the presence of
   full SIRT1 availability.},

Abstract = {Suppurative meningitis-meningoencephalitis (M-ME) is a sporadic disease
   in neonatal ungulates and only a few studies have reported the
   involvement of Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex (SBSEC)
   members in bovine neonatal M-ME. The SBSEC taxonomy was recent revised
   and previous biotype II/2 was reclassified as S. gallolyticus subsp.
   pasteurianus (SGP). The aim of this study was to describe a case of
   fatal neonatal neurological syndrome associated with SGP in calves. Ten
   calves were monitored because of neurological hyperacute symptoms
   associate with bilateral hypopyon and death. They were not fed with
   maternal colostrum; two of them died and were subjected to
   bacteriological, histopathological and biomolecular analysis as well as
   antibiotic susceptibility test. Both animals presented lesions mostly
   concentrated to meninges and brain and had bilateral hypopyon. Nine
   strains isolated in purity from brain, ocular humors and colon were
   identified as S. bovis group by using the API Strep system and as S.
   gallolyticus by using the 16S rRNA sequence. Two of these strains where
   subjected to WGS analysis that confirmed the sub-species identification
   and the clonality of the two SGP strains. The strains were found
   resistant to OT, SXT, MTZ and EN and susceptible to AMP, AMC, KZ and CN.
   We hypothesized that the syndrome observed could be due to the lack of
   maternal colostrum feeding. A timely and precise diagnosis could have
   likely prevented the death of the calves and, since the zoonotic
   potential of SBSECs members is known, accurate and rapid identification
   is required.},

Abstract = {In 2018, Croatia reported the largest outbreak of West Nile virus (WNV)
   infections as well as the re-occurrence of human Usutu virus (USUV)
   infections. For the first time, fatal WNV and USUV infections were
   detected in wild birds. We analysed epidemiological characteristics and
   molecular epidemiology of WNV and USUV infections detected during 2018
   transmission season. From April to November, 178 patients with
   neuroinvasive disease and 68 patients with febrile disease were tested
   for WNV and USUV. Viral RNA was detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
   and urine samples using a real-time RT-PCR. Positive samples were tested
   by nested RT-PCR and nucleotide sequencing. IgM/IgG antibodies were
   detected in serum/CSF samples using ELISA with confirmation of
   cross-reactive samples by virus neutralization test (VNT). WNV
   neuroinvasive disease was confirmed in 54 and WNV fever in seven
   patients from 10 continental Croatian counties. Areas affected in 2018
   were those in which cases occurred in previous seasons, while in three
   areas human cases were reported for the first time. Phylogenetic
   analysis of six strains from patients residing in different geographic
   areas showed circulation of WNV lineage 2. In three patients,
   neuroinvasive USUV infection was confirmed by RT-PCR or VNT. Sequence
   analysis of one detected strain revealed USUV Europe 2 lineage. During
   the same period, a total of 2,574 horse and 1,069 poultry serum samples
   were tested for WNV antibodies using ELISA. Acute asymptomatic WNV
   infection (IgM antibodies) was documented in 20/0.7\% horses. WNV IgG
   antibodies were found in 307/11.9\% horses and in 125/12.7\% poultry.
   WNV RNA was detected in two goshawks and USUV RNA was detected in one
   blackbird from north-western Croatia. In the Zagreb area, 3,670 female
   mosquitoes were collected. One Culex pipiens pool collected in July
   tested positive for USUV RNA. Our results highlight the importance of
   continuous multidisciplinary `One health' surveillance of these emerging
   arboviruses.},

Abstract = {The most important Italian population of the Eurasian otter (Lutra
   lutra) occurs in the southern part of the peninsula with two isolated
   sub-populations of about 250 adult individuals. The Eurasian otter is
   considered to be near threatened and it is a fully protected species.
   The aims of this study were to investigate for the first time the
   occurrence and characterize the parvoviruses included in the species
   Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 in seven carcasses of road-killed Eurasian
   otters from the southern Italy. Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 are
   responsible for acute gastroenteritis and leukopenia in pets and
   free-ranging carnivores. Initial screening of tissue samples by
   real-time PCR revealed CPV/FPV DNA in tissue samples of five Eurasian
   otters; three of them, showed co-infections by both CPV and FPV. Among
   the five positive Eurasian otters, we successfully obtained six DNA
   sequences from four individuals including two CPV-2a, one CPV-2b, one
   CPV-2c, and two FPV sequences. Comparison of these sequences with 250
   VP2 gene sequences deposited in the GenBank database, showed 10 nt
   differences resulting in two synonymous and eight non-synonymous
   substitutions. On the basis of these results, two sequences here found
   were characterized as new CPV-2a, one was characterized as new CPV-2b
   variant, and one was characterized as FPV-like mutant. The last two
   sequences belong to a FPV and CPV-2c strain respectively. Carnivore
   protoparvovirus 1 is reported for the first time in the Eurasian otter
   showing high infection value in southern Italy. Occurrence of this
   infection should be studied further to understand its possible
   pathogenicity and virulence to the fragile and isolate Eurasian otter
   population which live in southern Italy.},

Abstract = {Background: The diffusion of antimicrobial resistance is a significant
   concern for public health worldwide. Staphylococcus aureus represents a
   paradigm microorganism for antibiotic resistance in that resistant
   strains appear within a decade after the introduction of new
   antibiotics. Methods: Fourteen S. aureus isolates from human specimens
   and twenty-one from samples of animal origin, were compared for their
   antimicrobial resistance and biofilm capability. In addition, they were
   characterized at the molecular level to detect the antimicrobial
   resistance mecA gene and genes related with enterotoxin, toxin, and
   biofilm production. Results: Both phenotypic and molecular analysis
   showed main differences among human- and animal-derived isolates. Among
   the human-derived isolates, more multidrug-resistant isolates were
   detected and mecA gene, enterotoxin, and toxin genes were more
   prevalent. Different genes involved in biofilm production were detected
   with bap present only in animal-derived isolates and sasC present in
   both isolates, however, with a higher prevalence in the human-derived
   isolates. Biofilm capability was higher in human-derived isolates mainly
   associated to the sasC gene. Conclusions: The overall results indicate
   that human S. aureus isolates are more virulent and resistant than the
   isolates of animal origin randomly selected with no infection anamnesis.
   This study confirms that selection for more virulent and resistant S.
   aureus strains is related to the clinical practice.},

Abstract = {The zoonotic filarioid nematode Dirofilaria immitis is transmitted by
   bloodsucking mosquitoes and causes heartworm disease in dogs and wild
   canines. In the last decade, D. immitis has spread in southern Europe
   including Italy. Few autochthonous foci of infection have been reported
   in previously non-endemic areas of southern Italy based only on the
   identification of micro filariae, antigen and serological tests, and
   polymerase chain reaction assay from both the blood of dogs and mosquito
   vectors with no description of cases of heartworm disease in both
   domestic and wild canines. Here, we report first on two cases of
   heartworm disease found at post-mortem examination in two roaming dogs
   from the urban area of Castel Volturno in Campania region of southern
   Italy. Immunological analyses of 11 roaming dogs from the same pack of
   those two submitted for necropsy and available necropsy data from the
   dogs recovered from the Campania region along the past 10 years were
   both negative for D. immitis infection. Although rare in southern Italy,
   these two cases are noteworthy because D. immitis may cause serious
   human infection. We highlight the need to identify the mosquito vectors
   of heartworm disease in this area using sensitive molecular assay for D.
   immitis DNA for predicting and controlling the spread of infection. We
   strongly recommend the control and systematic treatment of the domestic
   and roaming dogs that could constitute the most important infection
   reservoir.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Marek's disease (MD) is a lymphoproliferative disease important to the
   poultry industry worldwide; it is caused by Gallid alphaherpesvirus 2
   (GaHV-2). The virulence of GaHV-2 isolates has shifted over the years
   from mild to virulent, very virulent and very virulent +. Nowadays the
   disease is controlled by vaccination, but field strains of increased
   virulence are emerging worldwide. Economic losses due to MD are mostly
   associated with its acute form, characterized by visceral lymphomas. The
   present study aimed to molecularly classify a group of 13 GaHV-2 strains
   detected in vaccinated Italian commercial chicken flocks during acute MD
   outbreaks, and to scrutinize the ability of predicting GaHV-2 virulence,
   according to the meq gene sequence. The full-length meq genes were
   amplified, and the obtained amino acid (aa) sequences were analysed,
   focusing mainly on the number of stretches of four proline molecules
   (PPPP) within the transactivation domain. Phylogenetic analysis was
   carried out with the Maximum Likelihood method using the obtained aa
   sequences, and the sequences of Italian strains detected in backyard
   flocks and of selected strains retrieved from GenBank. All the analysed
   strains showed 100\% sequence identity in the meq gene, which encodes a
   Meq protein of 339 aa. The Meq protein includes four PPPP motifs in the
   transactivation domain and an interruption of a PPPP motif due to a
   proline-to-serine substitution at position 218. These features are
   typically encountered in highly virulent isolates. Phylogenetic analysis
   revealed that the analysed strains belonged to a cluster that includes
   high-virulence GaHV-2 strains detected in Italian backyard flocks and a
   hypervirulent Polish strain. Our results support the hypothesis that the
   virulence of field isolates can be suggested by meq aa sequence
   analysis.},

Title = {Biosensing the Histamine Producing Potential of Bacteria in Tuna},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 27},
Abstract = {Histamine poisoning is the most common cause of human foodborne illness
   due to the consumption of fish products. An enzyme-based amperometric
   biosensor was developed to be used as a screening tool to detect
   histamine and histamine-producing bacteria (HPB) in tuna. It was
   developed by immobilizing histidine decarboxylase and horseradish
   peroxidase on the surface of screen-printed electrodes through a
   cross-linking procedure employing glutaraldehyde and bovine serum
   albumin. The signal generated in presence of histamine at the surface of
   the electrode was measured by chronoamperometry at in presence of a
   soluble redox mediator. The sensitivity of the electrode was 1.31-1.59
   mu A/mM, with a linear range from 2 to 20 mu g/ml and detection limit of
   0.11 mu g/ml. In this study fresh tuna filets purchased in supermarkets
   in different days (n = 8) were analyzed to detect HPB. Samples with
   different concentration of histamine were analyzed with culture-based
   counting methods, biosensor and HPLC and also a challenge test was made.
   Recovery of histamine from cultures and tuna samples was also assessed.
   The presence of Morganella psychrotolerans, Photobacterium phosphoreum,
   P damselae and Hafnia alvei was detected using culture- and PCR-based
   methods. At the time of purchase these tuna samples had histamine
   concentrations from below the limit of detection (LOD) to 60 mu g/g.
   HPLC and biosensor methods provided similar results in the range from
   zero to 432 mu g/g (correlation coefficient, R-2 = 0.990) and the
   recovery of histamine from cultures and tuna samples was very high (mean
   bias -12.69 to 1.63\%, with root-mean-square error <12\%). These results
   clearly show that fresh tuna is commonly contaminated with strong HPB.
   The histamine biosensor can be used by the Food Business Operators as a
   screening tool to detect their presence and to determine whether their
   process controls are adequate or not.},

Abstract = {Background Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease caused by bacteria Brucella
   spp. belonging to the genus Brucella. It is endemic in domesticated
   animals in Bangladesh. Isolation, identification and genetic
   characterization of Brucella spp. in dairy cattle are essential to
   undertake appropriate control and preventive measures. The study was
   conducted to isolate and characterize the Brucella spp. circulating in
   dairy cattle. Methods Uterine discharge (n = 45), milk (n = 115),
   vaginal swab (n = 71), placenta (n = 7) and aborted fetus (n = 2) were
   collected. Brucella selective agar plates were inoculated with samples
   and incubated at 37 C for 14 days under 5\% CO2 for isolation of
   Brucella spp. Brucella suspected colonies were recovered from samples
   were confirmed by genus and species specific PCR assays. Genetic
   characterization was performed by Multi Locus Variable number
   tandem-repeat Analysis-16 (MLVA-16). Results The isolates of Brucella
   recovered from samples were confirmed as B. abortus by AMOS-ERY PCR
   assay. The classical biotyping method confirmed all 10 B. abortus
   isolates belonged to the biovar 3. The MLVA-16 assay indicated all B.
   abortus isolates identical and the same genotype 40, based on panel 1
   MLVA-8. Conclusion Dendrogram analysis revealed all B. abortus isolates
   of the study were identical to three isolates from Brazil, one isolate
   of France and closely related to Chinese isolates. This is the first
   report of isolation and genetic characterization of B. abortus from the
   dairy cattle in Bangladesh.},

Abstract = {In Zimbabwe, there have been no chlamydiosis and limited brucellosis
   studies in goats. This study was conducted to determine the
   seroprevalence and risk factors of the two diseases in goats at three
   different livestock-wildlife interface areas: porous, non-porous and
   non-interface in the south-eastern lowveld of Zimbabwe. Collected sera
   (n = 563) were tested for Brucella antibodies using the Rose Bengal
   plate test (RBPT) and the complement fixation test (CFT); and for
   Chlamydia abortus antibodies using the CFT. All tested goats were
   negative for Brucella antibodies. Overall, chlamydial seroprevalence was
   22\%. The porous {[}chi(2) = 9.6, odds ratio (OR) = 2.6, p = 0.002] and
   non-porous (chi(2) = 37.5, OR = 5.8, p < 0.00001) interfaces were
   approximately three and six times more likely to be chlamydial
   seropositive than the noninterface area, respectively. Chlamydial
   seroprevalence was not associated with sex (chi(2) = 0.5, OR = 1.2, p =
   0.5), abortion history in female goats (chi(2) = 0.7, OR = 1.3, p =
   0.4), keeping goats with cattle (chi(2) = 0.2, OR = 1.5, p = 0.7) or
   flock size (chi(2) = 0.03, OR = 1.4, p = 0.9). Our study provides the
   first serological evidence of chlamydiosis in goats in Zimbabwe and the
   results suggest that proximity to wildlife is associated with increased
   chlamydial seropositivity. Further studies are required to determine the
   role of chlamydial infection on goat reproductive failure and that of
   wildlife on C. abortus transmission to domestic ruminants.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to develop and validate different innovative
   DNA extraction methods to detect Mycobacterium avium subsp.
   paratuberculosis (MAP) DNA from bovine and bufaline colostrum.
   Paratuberculosis is a chronic inflammatory infection of domestic and
   wild animals, especially ruminants, caused by MAP. The primary route of
   disease transmission is feces, but MAP can also be excreted in milk and
   colostrum. In 2015, the Italian Ministry of Health has issued a
   voluntary control plan of MAP in order to allow risk-based certification
   of bovine and buffaloes farms. In addition to the annual diagnostic
   screening and to the clinical surveillance of animals the plan includes
   the adoption of biosecurity and management measures to progressively
   mitigate the incidence of MAP. To achieve this goal it is crucial to
   ensure the accuracy of the methods used to detect the presence of MAP in
   bovine and buffaloes milk and colostrum, in order to: (1) support a
   ``safe colostrum farm-bank{''} set-up and thus prevent the main
   within-farm MAP transmission route and (2) to allow the MAP-free
   certification of milk products for export purposes. To achieve these
   goals, seven different DNA extraction protocols were identified from
   bibliography, out of which three methods were finally selected after the
   adoption of an evaluation procedure aimed at assessing the efficiency of
   extraction of DNA, the purity of DNA and the adaptability of the DNA
   amplification: NucleoSpin (R) Food Kit (Macherey-Nagel), NucleoSpin (R)
   Food Kit (Macherey-Nagel) combined with the magnetic beads, and QIAamp
   Cador Pathogen Mini kit (QIAGEN). In particular, the NucleoSpin (R) Food
   Kit (Macherey-Nagel) and the QIAamp Cador Pathogen Mini kit (QIAGEN)
   were tested on bovine and bufaline colostrum, showing a LOD between 4 x
   10(4) (2.6 x 10(6) cfu/ml) and 4.08 (26.7 cfu/ml) IS900 target copies
   and a LOD between 5.3 x 10(5) (4.1 x 10(6) cfu/ml) and 53 (4.1 x 10(3)
   cfu/ml) IS900 target copies, respectively.},

Abstract = {Background The therapeutic strategy for children with cow's milk allergy
   (CMA) consists in the elimination of cow's milk (CM) from their diet.
   Donkey's milk (DM) has been reported to be an adequate alternative,
   mainly to his nutritional similarities with human milk (HM) and
   excellent palatability. The aim of present prospective study was to
   evaluate the nutritional impact of DM on the diet of children with CMA
   in term of children growth. Methods Before the nutritional trial on
   children and during the study the health and hygiene risks and
   nutritional and nutraceuticals parameters of DM were monitored. Children
   with CMA were identified by the execution of in vivo and in vitro tests
   for CM and subsequent assessment of tolerability of DM with oral food
   challenge (OFC). Finally, we prescribed DM to a selected group of
   patients for a period of 6 months during which we monitored the growth
   of children. A total of 81 children, 70 with IgE mediated cow's milk
   protein allergy (IgE-CMPA) and 11 with Food Protein Induced
   Enterocolitis Syndrome to CM (CM-FPIES), were enrolled. Results
   Seventy-eight out of 81 patients underwent the OFC with DM and only one
   patient with IgE-CMPA (1.5 \%) reacted. Twenty-two out of 81 patients
   took part of the nutritional trial. All the 22 patients took and
   tolerated the DM, moreover DM did not change the normal growth rate of
   infants. Conclusions In conclusion, DM resulted safe in term of health
   and hygiene risks and nutritionally adequate: no negative impact on the
   normal growth rate of children was assessed. Therefore, it may be a
   suitable alternative for the management of IgE mediated CMA and FPIES,
   also in the first 6 months of life, if adequately supplemented.},

Abstract = {Rare earth elements (REEs), also called lanthanides, are emerging
   contaminants worldwide, due to their unique physical and chemical
   characteristics that make them essential in a variety of industrial
   applications. However, there is still a gap in the knowledge of
   occurrence and accumulation of REEs in biota, and no investigations have
   yet been performed in penguin feathers, which have already been widely
   utilized as a non-invasive tool for the biomonitoring of trace elements.
   The concentrations of 16 REEs were investigated in a colony of Humboldt
   penguins (Spheniscushumboldli) housed at the Acquario di Cattolica
   (Italy). Multielement determination of REEs was performed by an
   Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer after a microwave digestion
   of feathers. As this colony lives indoors in a controlled environment.
   it was the ideal choice for studying lanthanide occurrence in penguin
   feathers. Since there is a strict link between metal levels in feathers
   and the diet of penguins, their food (capelin) was also tested for REEs.
   Chondrite normalized values revealed the same pattern for REEs in
   feathers and fish, but REE concentrations were an order of magnitude
   higher in penguin feathers, demonstrating the suitability of this tissue
   as a bioindicator of REEs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {New insights into the gut microbiome in loggerhead sea turtles Caretta

Month = {AUG 14},
Abstract = {Caretta caretta is the most common sea turtle species in the
   Mediterranean Sea. The species is threatened by anthropomorphic activity
   that causes thousands of deaths and hundreds of strandings along the
   Mediterranean coast. Stranded turtles are often cared for in
   rehabilitation centres until they recover or die. The objective of this
   study was to characterize the gut microbiome of nine sea turtles
   stranded along the Sicilian coast of the Mediterranean Sea using
   high-throughput sequencing analysis targeting V3-V4 regions of the
   bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Stool samples were collected from eight
   specimens hosted in the recovery centre after a few days of
   hospitalization (under 7) and from one hosted for many weeks (78 days).
   To better explore the role of bacterial communities in loggerhead sea
   turtles, we compared our data with published fecal microbiomes from
   specimens stranded along the Tuscan and Ligurian coast. Our results
   highlight that, despite the different origin, size and health conditions
   of the animals, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria constitute
   the main components of the microbiota. This study widens our knowledge
   on the gut microbiome of sea turtles and could be helpful for the set up
   of rehabilitation therapies of stranded animals after recovery in
   specialized centres.},

Title = {Which food safety information sources do Italian consumers prefer?
   Suggestions for the development of effective food risk communication},

Abstract = {This study investigated which information sources Italian consumers use
   most frequently when they have a question about food safety in order to
   obtain useful insights to inform food risk communication. In 2011, a
   national survey was conducted targeting Italian people responsible for
   purchasing and preparing food for their households. Respondents' choices
   of information sources on food safety were correlated with their
   socio-demographic and behavioural characteristics, their levels of
   objective knowledge, their levels of trust towards some authorities and
   their levels of self-perception regarding risk exposure. Our data
   analysis identified those information channels that are most likely to
   reach Italians actively seeking information. Mass media
   (radio/television/newspapers) were the most frequently used information
   source, followed by the Internet. Age, educational qualification,
   employment status, geographical area, family status and objective
   knowledge were the variables that influenced the choice for information
   sources used by the Italian population. The frequency of buying food
   products, the frequency of eating put and the frequency of cooking also
   showed a dependency relation. The profiles of those who actively seek
   information were also outlined. Among these, the Mass media users' and
   the Internet users' profiles were further analysed. Results show that
   Italian consumers do actively seek information about food safety,
   revealing that food safety continues to be a concern for the Italian
   consumers. Their interest in this topic represents an opportunity for
   public health authorities to address an audience of receptive consumers.
   Such information will be valuable in the design of targeted
   communication campaigns to increase consumers' knowledge and awareness
   of food safety issues and will help authorities to choose the most
   effective channels through which to deliver key messages.},

Abstract = {Dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) enzyme activity is modulated at the
   genetic level by the presence of several polymorphisms. Among these, the
   19-bp insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism (rs72393728/rs141116007) was
   investigated in several genetic association studies for its correlation
   with the susceptibility to develop episodic migraine, but conflicting
   results were achieved. In the present study we analyzed this genetic
   variant in a carefully characterized population of migraineurs
   encompassing both episodic and chronic migraine (with and without
   medication overuse) with the aim to perform a replication study and
   verify any possible correlation with migraine endophenotypes. Genotyping
   of the DBH 19-bp I/D polymorphism was performed on 400 migraine patients
   and 204 healthy individuals. The associations between genotypic
   frequencies and the clinical and sociodemographic features of
   migraineurs were then investigated. The DBH 19-bp I/D polymorphism did
   not correlate with migraine susceptibility or most clinical variables,
   with the exception of a statistically significant correlation within the
   subgroup of patients affected by chronic migraine were the individuals
   carrying the deleted (D) allele were significantly more prone to abuse
   in analgesics. As a result of this finding, the DBH 19-bp I/D
   polymorphism does not influence migraine susceptibility, but it might
   contribute to the development of medication overuse in patient with
   chronic migraine.},

Title = {Proficiency Testing of Virus Diagnostics Based on Bioinformatics
   Analysis of Simulated In Silico High-Throughput Sequencing Data Sets},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Quality management and independent assessment of high-throughput
   sequencing-based virus diagnostics have not yet been established as a
   mandatory approach for ensuring comparable results. The sensitivity and
   specificity of viral high-throughput sequence data analysis are highly
   affected by bioinformatics processing using publicly available and
   custom tools and databases and thus differ widely between individuals
   and institutions. Here we present the results of the COMPARE
   {[}Collaborative Management Platform for Detection and Analyses of (Re-)
   emerging and Foodborne Outbreaks in Europe] in silico virus proficiency
   test. An artificial, simulated in silico data set of lllumina HiSeq
   sequences was provided to 13 different European institutes for
   bioinformatics analysis to identify viral pathogens in high-throughput
   sequence data. Comparison of the participants' analyses shows that the
   use of different tools, programs, and databases for bioinformatics
   analyses can impact the correct identification of viral sequences from a
   simple data set. The identification of slightly mutated and highly
   divergent virus genomes has been shown to be most challenging.
   Furthermore, the interpretation of the results, together with a
   fictitious case report, by the participants showed that in addition to
   the bioinformatics analysis, the virological evaluation of the results
   can be important in clinical settings. External quality assessment and
   proficiency testing should become an important part of validating
   high-throughput sequencing-based virus diagnostics and could improve the
   harmonization, comparability, and reproducibility of results. There is a
   need for the establishment of international proficiency testing, like
   that established for conventional laboratory tests such as PCR, for
   bioinformatics pipelines and the interpretation of such results.},

Abstract = {Levels of hexabromocyclododecane isomers alpha, beta, gamma, (HBCDDs)
   and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBP-A) were determined in 24 representative
   samples of different wild fish and seafood species (benthic: N = 16;
   pelagic: N = 8) and 16 samples of farmed bivalve molluscs from the West
   Mediterranean Sea (FAO 37, 1.3 sub-area). An LC-MS/MS-based method with
   limits of quantification (LOQS) in the range of 0.01-0.05 ng g(-1) fresh
   weight (fw) was utilized. While a HBCDD was found in 80\% of the 24 wild
   species samples, beta and gamma congeners were found in 33\% and 25\%,
   respectively. Sigma HBCDD content ranged from 0.03 (Aristeus antennatus)
   to 0.68 (Sardina pilchardus) ng g(-1), fw as Upper Bound values across
   2.00-4.46 trophic levels. In farmed molluscs, HBCDD congeners were
   always present and ranged from 0.22-0.52 ng g(-1) fw, with the exception
   of one farm (1.23-2.06 ng g(-1) fw), whose values suggest the presence
   of a regular emission source. TBBP-A levels always fell below the LOQ of
   0.05 ng g(-1) fw in all samples. The results are in good agreement with
   results of previous studies from the Mediterranean Sea. The
   Environmental Quality Standard for human health from fish and seafood
   local consumption was set at 165 mu g g(-1) fw. The Margin of Exposure
   of 490,020 as the ratio between the considered Health Based Guidance
   Level of 0.79 mg kg(-1) body weight and the geo-referenced HBCDD intake
   (P95 fish and seafood intake; mean Sigma HBCDD contamination) indicates
   no threat to food safety. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   sequencing, and phylogenetic analyses. We demonstrate the presence of
   strains closely related to the Theileria buffeli/sergentii/orientalis
   complex in Rhipicephalus sanguineus s.l., Rh. bursa, Rh. annulatus,
   Hyalomma marginatum, Dermacentor marginatus and Haemaphysalis punctata
   ticks. A strain detected in two Rh. sanguineus s.l. ticks collected from
   dogs grouped with T. equi, the agent of equine piroplasmosis. T. ovis,
   the main etiological agent of ovine theileriosis, was detected in one
   Rh. bursa tick from a mouflon. Babesia bigemina, the causative agent of
   bovine babesiosis, was detected in two Rh. sanguineus s.l. ticks from
   dogs. Our findings expand the knowledge on the repertoire of tick-borne
   pathogens present in Mediterranean ticks. Further analyses are needed to
   determine the role of ticks in the biological or mechanical transmission
   of piroplasmoses in this area.},

Abstract = {Among food additives, nitrite and nitrate salts are the most used in
   meat products. This is due to their capacity to inhibit microbiological
   growth, enhance the characteristic meat red-pink color, and maintain the
   freshness. These additives may be harmful for human health, so the
   legislation closely restricted their use in meat products. Within
   official controls, ion chromatography with suppressed conductivity
   detection is the most used and well-established technique for the
   analytical determination of nitrite and nitrate. However, this technique
   may suffer of analytical drawbacks related to matrix interferences. In
   this study, we developed and validated an alternative method by
   capillary ion chromatography (CIC) coupled to conductivity detection,
   for this type of analytical determination. The method was fully
   validated following the most updated guidelines and according to the
   European Normative, for the analysis of different types of meat
   products. All the validation parameters resulted as satisfactory. The
   comparison with conventional ion chromatography demonstrated that the
   proposed method is characterized by higher sensitivity and selectivity
   toward interferences. Consequently, it represents a valid alternative to
   conventional procedures for the determination of nitrite and nitrate in
   meat products.},

Title = {Housing Rabbit Does in a Combi System with Removable Walls: Effect on
   Behaviour and Reproductive Performance},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Simple Summary This study focuses on the welfare and reproductive
   performance of rabbit does housed in individual conventional cages (C)
   or in different colony cages: simple (does in the group for 100\% of the
   reproductive cycle: C1) or combi (in both individual and group caging:
   C2). The results showed that C2 had some benefits compared to continuous
   grouphousing, but both colony systems achieved lower reproductive
   performance levels than the conventional system. Although C2 showed some
   improvement on the behaviour of does, the aggressiveness of
   group-housing the does to establish a rank order was responsible for
   injuries, higher disease risks, and higher kit mortality. We evaluated
   the effects of two types of colony cages, in which rabbit does were
   always in a group (C1), and where they were in combi cages furnished
   with removable internal walls to allow both individual and grouphousing
   (C2), in addition to the control group (C: conventional individual
   cage), on welfare, reproductive performance, and global efficiency.
   Forty-eight New Zealand White nulliparous rabbit does underwent
   artificially insemination (AI) and were divided into three groups, and
   reared in the different systems for about 1 year. The reproductive
   rhythm provides AIs at weaning (30d). In the C1 system, does were
   continuously grouped, while in C2, walls were inserted four days before
   kindling and removed 1week after it (60\% of the timesheet in group).
   Reproductive traits and behaviour were evaluated during the entire year.
   The behavioural observations were performed around days 7, 36, and 44,
   corresponding to the inclusion of the does in the maternal cages, the
   insertion of walls four days before kindling, and the removal of the
   walls 1week after parturition in the C2 group, respectively. The
   percentages of does with severe skin injuries and the distribution of
   the injuries on different parts of body were also registered. Does
   reared in conventional cages showed the greatest presence of stereotype
   behaviours, while the C1 group showed the highest (p < 0.05) incidence
   of aggressiveness after regrouping (attack, dominance features, and
   lower allo-grooming) in comparison to the C2 group (17\% and 22\%, in C2
   and C1 does, respectively).Individually caged does achieved the best
   productive performance (sexual receptivity, fertility, kindling rate,
   and number of kits born alive and at weaning). The C1 group showed the
   lowest performance (p < 0.05), whereas C2 showed an intermediate one.
   Does housed in the combi cage (C2) had higher (p < 0.05) receptivity and
   fertility rates and higher numbers of kits born alive and at weaning
   (79.2\% and 76.2\%; 7.95 and 7.20, respectively) than the C1 group, but
   lower values (p < 0.05) than does that were individually housed.},

Abstract = {Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a mycotoxin mainly produced by Fusarium
   graminearum that can contaminate cereals and cereal-based foodstuff.
   Urinary DON levels can be used as biomarker for exposure assessment
   purposes. This study assessed urinary DON concentrations in Italian
   volunteers recruited by age group, namely children, adolescents, adults,
   and the elderly. In addition, vulnerable groups, namely vegetarians and
   pregnant women, were included in the study. To determine the urinary
   DON, its glucuronide and de-epoxydated (DOM-1) forms, an indirect
   analytical approach was used, measuring free DON and total DON (as sum
   of free and glucuronides forms), before and after enzymatic treatment,
   respectively. Morning urine samples were collected on two consecutive
   days, from six different population groups, namely children, adolescent,
   adults, elderly, vegetarians and pregnant women. Total DON was measured
   in the 76\% of the collected samples with the maximum incidences in
   children and adolescent age group. Urine samples from children and
   adolescent also showed the highest total DON levels, up to 17.0
   ng/mg(creat). Pregnant women had the lowest positive samples per
   category (40\% for day 1 and 43\% for day 2, respectively), low mean
   levels of total DON (down to 2.84 ng/mg(creat)) and median equal to 0
   ng/mg(creat). Estimation of DON dietary intake reveals that 7.5\% of the
   total population exceeds the TDI of 1 mu g/kg bw/day set for DON, with
   children showing 40\% of individuals surpassing this value (male, day
   2).},

Abstract = {Serum protein distribution and concentration can be affected by
   different physiological and pathological conditions. The aim of this
   study was to evaluate the changes in the concentration of serum protein
   fractions and haptoglobin in clinically healthy dairy buffaloes during
   late pregnancy and early lactation. Blood and milk samples were
   collected from 30 buffaloes at around 7 d before expected calving (blood
   only) and 7, 30 and 50 d after calving. In serum samples, the total
   protein, haptoglobin, albumin, alpha 1-, alpha 2-, beta 1-, beta 2-,
   gamma-globulins, and albumin/globulin ratio (A/G) values were evaluated.
   In milk, fat\%, protein\%, lactose\%, somatic cell score (SCS) were
   assessed, along with milk yield (MY) and daily milk production (DMP).
   The peripartum period significantly influenced (P < 0.005) total
   protein, albumin, haptoglobin, alpha 2-, beta 2- and gamma-globulins (P
   < 0.005). Milk yield, DMP and fat\% changed significantly throughout the
   monitoring period (P < 0.005). Milk yield and DMP were positively
   correlated with total protein, albumin, beta 2-globulins and A/G ratio,
   and negatively correlated with haptoglobin and alpha 2-globulins. These
   results provide new knowledge about the serum protein electrophoretic
   pattern in Italian Mediterranean Buffaloes during the last phase of
   pregnancy and early stages of lactation.},

   recent various reports of a relatively high number of new strains and

   sequences from southern Italy have been evaluated applying the
   palindromic nucleotide substitutions method, based on 5'-UTR secondary
   structure alignment and computing genetic distance among strains in the
   internal ribosome entry site. Sequence analysis revealed a highly
   heterogeneous virus population, indicating the introduction of virus
   variants of Bovine viral diarrhea virus and Border disease virus species
   from foreign countries. The application of different analytical
   procedures was useful to avoid interpretation difficulties. Circulation
   of heterogeneous virus populations showed the need for more accurate
   epidemiological investigations and stringent veterinary controls to

Title = {Dietary Supplementation of Dried Grape Pomace Increases the Amount of
   Linoleic Acid in Beef, Reduces the Lipid Oxidation and Modifies the
   Volatile Profile},

Abstract = {Simple Summary The grape pomace is the main solid by-product of the
   oenological industry, and represents a rich source of potent bioactive
   compounds. In this study we demonstrated that its inclusion in bovine
   diet resulted in a significant increase of linoleic acid concentration
   in meat, a condition which led to a positive increase in the
   polyunsaturated fatty acid:saturated fatty acids (PUFA:SFA) ratio.
   Despite the greater predisposition of PUFA to oxidation, an interesting
   improvement in the oxidative stability of meat was evidenced, presumably
   as an effect of the antioxidant activity performed by the bioactive
   compounds of which the grape pomace is rich in. This finding was also
   confirmed by the analysis of volatile compounds which highlighted a
   reduction of hexanal in meat samples obtained from animals fed the
   dietary grape pomace supplementation. Overall, the present study showed
   a viable way for the recovery and the valorization of the main
   by-product of the oenological industry. The aim of this study was to
   evaluate the effect of dietary supplementation with dried grape pomace
   on beef quality. Ten Friesian calves were divided into two groups, a
   control group that received a standard diet, and an experimental group
   that was administered the dietary supplementation. At the end of the 75
   days of the trial, animals were slaughtered, and meat samples analyzed
   for physical and chemical properties, fatty acids composition, lipid
   oxidation, volatile compounds, and biogenic amines. The fatty acid
   profile resulted affected by dietary supplementation, since an increase
   in concentration of linoleic acid was observed. Furthermore, a reduction
   of lipid oxidation was found in the same samples. With reference to
   volatile compounds a reduction of hexanal and an increase of 2-3
   octanedione was evidenced, while no effects were induced by diets on the
   synthesis of biogenic amines. The grape pomace exploitation as a dietary
   supplement in bovine diet did not have negative effects on the quality
   of beef and showed the potential to extend shelf life due to marked
   improvement in oxidative stability. Overall, the present study showed a
   viable way for the recovery and the valorization of the main by-product
   of the oenological industry.},

Abstract = {Intra-vitam diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a
   challenge for veterinary diagnosticians, since there are no highly
   specific and sensitive assays currently available. With the aim to
   contribute to fill this diagnostic gap, a total of 61 effusions from
   cats with suspected effusive FIP were collected intra-vitam for
   detection of feline coronavirus (FCoV) antibodies and RNA by means of
   indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) assay and real-time RTPCR (qRT-PCR),
   respectively. In 5 effusions there was no evidence for either FCoV RNA
   or antibodies, 51 and 52 specimens tested positive by IIF and qRT-PCR,
   respectively, although antibody titres >= 1:1600, which are considered
   highly suggestive of FIP, were detected only in 37 effusions. Three
   samples with high antibody levels tested negative by qRT-PCR, whereas 18
   qRT-PCR positive effusions contained no or low-titre antibodies. qRT-PCR
   positive samples with low antibody titres mostly contained low FCoV RNA
   loads, although the highest antibody titres were detected in effusions
   with C-T values > 30. In conclusion, combining the two methods, i.e.,
   antibody and RNA detection would help improving the intra-vitam
   diagnosis of effusive FIP.},

Title = {Determination of fatty acids and vitamin E content in muscle from

Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Lipomatous myopathy is a degenerative muscle disease reported in
   Piedmontese cattle, characterized by the substitution of muscle cells
   with adipose tissue. The pathogenesis of this myopathy is still poorly
   understood, most likely its origin is multifactorial, with genetic and
   nutritional factors contributing to its development. In this work
   Authors performed histological and biochemical analyzes on samples taken
   from four different muscle types (vastus lateralis, biceps brachii,
   cutaneous trunci and cutaneous colli) from Piedmontese cattle, seven
   healthy animals and seven with lipomatous myopathy, aged fourteen to
   nineteen months. The animals were reared under the same environmental
   condition and fed at the same energy and protein level without vitamin E
   supplementation. None of the animals showed clinical signs of muscular
   disease and all were in an excellent state of nutrition. The seven
   affected animals were identified by macroscopic examination for the
   presence of infiltration of adipose tissue in multiple or individual
   muscles. Histological analysis of the tissue with lipomatous myopathy
   revealed infiltration of adipose tissue of various distribution and
   severity. Necrosis and non suppurative inflammatory cells were also
   seen. Furthermore, proliferation of connective tissue and non-specific
   myopathic changes, were present too. Biochemical analyzes of
   pathological tissue showed an increase in fatty acid content, in
   particular for monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and a marked decrease
   in vitamin E content compared to healthy tissue. As the activity of the
   stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), a rate-limiting enzyme in the
   biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids, has recently been shown to
   be a critical control point in the regulation of skeletal muscle lipid
   metabolism, and the desaturation indices for 18:0 and 16:0 fatty acids
   are considered indirect indicators of SCD, Authors calculated the
   mathematical indices for Delta (9)-desaturase C16 activity and for Delta
   (9)-desaturase C18 activity in total lipid extracts. As compared with
   the controls, in pathological samples the desaturation index was
   significantly higher. Currently, it is not possible to predict to what
   extent these changes can influence the organoleptic, technological, and
   nutritional characteristics of meat from cattle with lipomatous
   myopathy. Further study is needed to understand how these changes relate
   to meat quality and the pathogenesis of lipomatous myopathy.},

Abstract = {A novel Bifidobacterium strain, MRM 9.3(T), was isolated from a faecal
   sample of a baby common marmoset (Callithrixjacchus). Cells were
   Gram-stain-positive, non-motile, non-sporulating, non-haemolytic,
   facultatively anaerobic and fructose 6-phosphate
   phosphoketolase-positive. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA genes
   as well as multilocus sequences (representing hsp60, rpoB, clpC, dnaJ
   and dnaG genes) and the core genomes revealed that strain MRM 9.3(T)
   exhibited phylogenetic relatedness to Bifidobacterium myosotis DSM
   100196(T). Comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences confirmed the
   phylogenetic results showing the highest gene sequence identity with
   strain B.ifidobacterium myosotis DSM 100196(T) (95.6 \%). The average
   nucleotide identity, amino acid average identity and in silico DNA-DNA
   hybridization values between MRM 9.3(T)and DSM 100196(T) were 79.9, 72.1
   and 28.5 \%, respectively. Phenotypic and genotypic features clearly
   showed that the strain MRM 9.3(T) represents a novel species, for which
   the name Bifidobacterium jacchi sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is
   MRM 9.3(T) (=DSM 103362T =JCM 31788(T)).},

Abstract = {Simple Summary Minerals play an important role in animals' health and
   nutritional status and are associated with cortisol, a hormone involved
   in several physiological processes and with a fundamental role in
   allostasis, the process of achieving homeostasis. The aim of the present
   study is to perform a preliminary investigation on the concentration of
   19 minerals and cortisol in the hair of red deer coming from two
   different areas of the Stelvio National Park. Results showed a close
   association between hair minerals and cortisol concentrations and an
   effect of deer origin. Hair minerals and cortisol assessment is an easy,
   rapid, and low cost screening method and it is useful in wildlife
   management programs, in order to investigate wild animals' health
   status, to perform environmental studies, to assess the presence of
   contaminants in wild species and to determine risks for humans. In
   addition, it could be helpful in public health programs to estimate
   contamination risks linked to wild animal meat consumption or to assess
   the presence of contaminants in food-producing animals. The aim of the
   study was to perform an investigation on the concentration of 19
   minerals and cortisol in red deer (Cervus elaphus) hair, a matrix that
   is easy to collect with non-invasive and painless sampling, able to
   represent an integrative values of long-term substance concentrations,
   and able to give useful information, also when performed on dead
   animals, given its extreme stability over time. In the study thirty-five
   animals were included, coming from two different sides of a valley in
   the Stelvio National Park, where official water analysis had pointed out
   elevated concentrations of As in one of the two orographic sides. Hair
   cortisol concentrations were measured using a RIA(Radio Immuno Assay),
   while minerals were detected using ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma-
   Mass Spectrometry). Results showed a negative relationship between
   cortisol and some mineral concentrations (Li, Co, As, Cd, Cr and Tl) and
   significant differences in some mineral concentrations between park
   areas (Al, Co, Cu, Cd and Ni). As, Cr and cortisol differences
   approached statistical significance. This preliminary study represents a
   step forward in the study of wildlife allostatic load and a valid method
   for applications in wildlife management programs, in environmental
   studies and in public health programs.},

Abstract = {Although in recent years there has been intensification in the use of
   nanoparticles (NPs) for the production of many commercial products, few
   studies have been carried out to assess the risks associated with its
   use. Among the most used NPs, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have a
   preponderant position as they have various applications. In this study,
   40 adult zebrafish were exposed to increasing concentrations of AgNPs
   (8, 45, and 70 mu g/L) for 30 days to evaluate the effects on eyes after
   chronic exposure to AgNPs with an average diameter of 50 nm. From the
   morphological and ultrastructural analysis performed, no alteration or
   lesions of the corneal epithelium were detected.},

Title = {First description of Streptococcus lutetiensis from a diseased cat},

Abstract = {This paper describes for the first time the isolation of Streptococcus
   lutetiensis in a cat with intestinal lymphoma. The Streptococcus bovis
   group has undergone significant taxonomic changes over the past two
   decades and, in 2002, Poyart et al. described two distinct novel species
   within the genus Streptococcus: Streptococcus lutetiensis and
   Streptococcus pasteurianus. The bovis group streptococci include
   commensal species and subspecies or opportunistic pathogens of humans
   and animals. The cat was referred to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital,
   University of Bologna for chronic diarrhoea associated with fresh blood.
   A diagnosis of intestinal lymphoma was advanced. S. lutetiensis was
   accidentally isolated from the faeces of the cat and identified through
   MALDI-TOF and 16s rRNA sequencing. The Kirby-Bauer test revealed that
   the isolate was resistant to enrofloxacin, erythromycin, clindamycin,
   marbofloxacin and tetracycline. The detection of S. lutetiensis in cat
   faeces might suggest that it could be a normal inhabitant of cat
   intestinal tract or that it could be involved in the manifestation of
   intestinal diseases. Since bacteria belonging to the S. bovis group are
   considered emerging pathogens, additional research is required to
   evaluate the role of S. lutetiensis in cats and its role in the
   transmission of antimicrobial resistance. Significance and Impact of the
   Study In this study the isolation of Streptococcus lutetiensis from a
   cat with intestinal lymphoma was described for the first time. An
   antimicrobial susceptibility test performed by means of the disc
   diffusion method revealed that the isolate was resistant to
   enrofloxacin, erythromycin, clindamycin, marbofloxacin and tetracycline.
   Nowadays the ecological or pathogenetic role of S. lutetiensis in the
   gut of animals remains unclear but, even if its role as commensal
   bacterium was confirmed, the presence of multi-resistant S. lutetiensis
   in cat gut could favour the transmission of antimicrobial resistance to
   other bacteria.},

Abstract = {Bacillus cereus, a bacteria frequently associated with food spoilage, is
   responsible for 2 different foodborne illness in humans: a diarrheal
   disease, associated with cytotoxin K, hemolysin BL and a non-hemolytic
   enterotoxin, and an emetic syndrome, associated with the cereulide
   toxin.
   The aim of this study is to investigate the occurrence of B. cereus in
   515 hard and soft cheeses collected in southern Italy. The strains were
   molecularly characterized for the presence of hblA, hblC, hblD, nheA,
   nheB, nheC, cytK, and entFM genes, related to the production of
   enterotoxins (trimeric hemolysin BL, trimeric non-hemolytic enterotoxin,
   cytotoxin K and enterotoxin FM). One hundred thirty eight samples
   (26.8\%) were found contaminated by B. cereus. One hundred of the
   contaminated samples (72.5\%) showed a level of B. cereus contamination
   <= 10(3) CFU/g, whereas 9 (6.5\%) samples showed a contamination >10(5)
   CFU/g. Seven different molecular profiles were found among the 138
   strains of B. cereus isolated. The most common profile was nheABC-entFM,
   found in 42 strains, followed by the hblACD-nheABC-cytK-entFM, found in
   33 strains, the nheABC-cytK-entFM, found in 24 strains, the
   hblACD-nheABC-entFM, found in 11 strains, the hblACD-nheAC-entFM, found
   in 15 strains, and the nheC-entFM, found in 12 strains. Eleven strains
   did not harbored any of these genes.
   In 7.2\% (37/515) of samples, characterized by a bacterial contamination
   >10(3) CFU/g, we found B. cereus strains harboring genes encoding for at
   least one complete enterotoxin.},

Title = {Performance and trends of the results of the Interlaboratory Trials held

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to analyse the trend of the Interlaboratory
   Trails (IT) for serological techniques used in the diagnosis of Equine
   Infectious Anaemia (EIA), organized by the National Reference Centre for
   EIA between 2002-2017. The participation of numerous national
   laboratories and the long time interval considered gives greater value
   to the data obtained. The increase in the samples to be tested as
   prescribed by the legislative provisions, and the requirement to
   participate with a satisfactory outcome for accreditation purposes has
   made this tool important for verifying the technical and diagnostic
   competence of the laboratories. The performances obtained by the
   laboratories demonstrate the efficiency and the reliability over time of
   the diagnostic system, which plays a central role in the surveillance
   activities.
   Overall, although the whole diagnostic system has an acceptable
   sensitivity, the ELISA presented higher concordance levels and better
   reproducibility than the agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID). The
   implementation, since 2007, of the regular serological testing for EIA
   requested the use of highly sensitive techniques, such as the ELISA;
   this assay indeed is capable of detecting about 20\% more positives
   samples than AGID and can more easily detect weak positive sera that, in
   an advanced stage of eradication, constitutes the majority of the
   positive samples and are difficult to diagnose with the previous test,
   since those with a strongly positive reaction have been already
   recruited and removed through previous surveillance activities. The high
   number of laboratories that immediately participated in the IT for
   ELISA, on its introduction, reflects its diagnostic value owing to its
   high sensitivity, underlined by the reduced percentage of errors
   obtained for the positive sera. This makes it an effective method, in
   support of the eradication of infection to be applied during the
   screening phase of the national surveillance program, to recruit sera
   not detected in AGID.},

Abstract = {Salmonella is a foodbome pathogen able to adhere and persist on biotic
   and abiotic surfaces, including vegetables, which are even more linked
   to foodbome outbreaks. In this work, first we investigated the
   capability of Salmonella to adhere on different surfaces (stainless
   steel, polypropylene and lettuce), then we evaluated the potential
   effect of essential oils in reducing the adhesion and persistence of the
   pathogen on lettuce. Eight essential oils (EO) were tested on five
   Salmonella enterica strains (serovars Derby, Thompson, Napoli, Kasenyi
   and Veneziana). Cinnamontwn zeylanicum EO (CEO) was the most effective,
   according to Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC 1.25-1.87 mu L/mL)
   and to growth/inhibition dynamics. To simulate real conditions, a
   cocktail of Salmonella Kasenyi, S. Veneziana and S. Napoli was applied
   on the three surfaces, but it adhered only on lettuce, starting from 1 h
   of contact (4.59 +/- 0.34 Log UFC/cm(2)). Five mu L/mL CEO, applied on
   lettuce, immediately reduced the loosely and strongly attached cells
   (reduction of 0.78 Log and 0.63 Log CFU/cm(2), respectively), with
   significant effect up to 120 h. CEO also inhibited the Polyphenol
   Oxidase activity, thus preserving lettuce colour during storage.
   Cinnamon EO could therefore help to improve safety and appearance of
   fresh-cut lettuce during storage.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Biomonitoring has been used to disclose the public health impact of
   contaminated sites. This study aimed at setting up good practices to
   apply biomonitoring targeting animal matrixes to design risk-based
   surveillance and exposure assessment plans. A nine-step protocol
   targeting farmed animals was devised and tested in three case study
   areas including (1) a waste dump, (2) a waste incinerator, and (3) a
   secondary aluminum smelter. Between 2010 and 2012, in each study area,
   the following 9-step best practices were applied: hazard identification,
   GIS project creation, risk area delimitation, control area selection,
   receptors (livestock) identification, farms and matrixes selection,
   sampling study design, on-farm secondary sources exclusion, and
   statistical and geostatistical analysis. Dairy farms and free-range
   laying hens were the primary targets: eggs from both risk and control
   areas and milk from risk areas were sampled and submitted for detection
   of selected tracking contaminants compatible with the putative sources.
   Comparison data (risk vs. control) of heavy metal concentrations in eggs
   were available only for case study 2, whereas egg comparison data of
   persistent organic pollutants were available for all the risk-control
   pairs. After taking into account potential secondary sources, no concern
   from metals was arisen, whereas high concentrations of persistent
   organic pollutants were detected in all risk areas; however, only for
   the aluminum smelter case study, the contamination was broad and higher
   in the risk area compared with the control one. The protocol has proved
   to be easily applicable and flexible to varying contexts and able to
   provide helpful data to inform risk management decisions.},

Abstract = {Cystic Echinococcosis (CE) caused by Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato
   (s.l.) is one of the most important parasitic zoonotic diseases in the
   world and it represents an important public health and socio-economic
   concern. In the Mediterranean basin, CE is widespread and it is endemic
   in Italy, with major prevalence in southern areas. Several studies have
   investigated CE in domestic pigs, however, such data in wild boars are
   scant. In the last decades the wild boar population in Italy has
   increased and this ungulate could play an important role in the
   spreading of CE in the wild. Here we report on the prevalence and
   fertility rate of hydatid cysts in wild boars that were shot during two
   hunting seasons (2016-2017) in the Campania region of southern Italy.
   For each animal, a detailed inspection of the carcass and organs (lungs,
   liver and spleen) was performed and when cysts were found, their number,
   morphology and fertility were determined by visual and microscopic
   examination. Cysts were classified morphologically as fertile, sterile,
   caseous and calcified. Protoscoleces and germinal layers were collected
   from individual cysts and DNA was extracted to identify different
   strains/genotypes of E. granulosus s.l.
   Out of a total of 2108 wild boars 93 (4.4\%) were found positive for CE.
   Infected animals were 45 males and 48 females, aged between 1 and 8
   years. The average number of cysts per wild boar was 1.3 (min 1 - max
   13). The total number of cysts collected was 123, of which 118 (95.9\%)
   in the liver, 4 (3.3\%) in the lungs and 1 (0.8\%) in the spleen. Of all
   analyzed cysts, 70 (56.9\%) were fertile and 53 (43.1\%)
   sterile/acephalous. The presence of fertile cysts in 19.4\% of
   CE-positive animals is noteworthy. Overall, molecular diagnosis showed
   19 wild boars infected with the pig strain (G7).},

Title = {Isolation and Full-Length Sequence Analysis of a Pestivirus from Aborted
   Lamb Fetuses in Italy},
Journal = {VIRUSES-BASEL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Pestiviruses are distributed worldwide and are responsible for a variety
   of economically important diseases. They are not very host-specific, and
   thus sheep can be infected by well-known pestiviruses like bovine viral
   diarrhea virus (BVDV) and border disease virus (BDV), as well as by
   other recently discovered pestivirus species. The aim of this study is
   to describe the isolation and characterization of four pestivirus
   strains detected in aborted lamb fetuses from a single farm in the
   Brescia province (Northern Italy). A total of twelve aborted fetuses
   were collected and examined. After necropsy, organs were tested for the
   presence of infectious agents known as potential causes of abortion
   (Brucella spp., Listeria spp., Coxiella burnetii, Chlamydophila spp.,
   Mycoplasma spp., Neospora caninum, and Toxoplasma gondii), and submitted
   to viral identification by isolation on Madin Darby bovine kidney (MDBK)
   cell culture and by PCR assay for Schmallenberg virus and pan-pestivirus
   RT-PCR real time assay. Three viral strains (Ovine/IT/1756/2017,
   Ovine/IT/338710-2/2017, and Ovine/IT/338710-3/2017) were isolated in the
   absence of cytopathic effects (CPEs) in cell cultures and identified
   with RT-PCR. Another pestivirus strain (Ovine/IT/16235-2/2018) was
   detected by PCR, but was not successfully isolated. Complete sequence
   genomic data of the three isolated viruses showed that they were highly
   similar, differed genetically from known pestivirus species, and were
   closely related to classical swine fever virus (CSFV). Beyond the
   identification of new ovine pestiviruses, this study indicates that a
   systematic diagnostic approach is important to identify the presence and
   map the distribution of both known and emerging pestiviruses.},

Title = {Cysticercosis by Taenia pisiformis in Brown Hare (Lepus europaeus) in

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-PARASITES AND WILDLIFE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {139-143},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In Northern Italy, a hastening of hare population decline was noticeable
   from 2008. In the same year hunters reported a sudden increase of hares
   infected by Taenia sp. larvae, whose morphology was consistent with T.
   pisiformis cysticerci. The aim of the survey was: i)to identify the
   parasites through morphological features and molecular techniques; ii)to
   quantify the prevalence and abundance of cysticerci in hunted hares;
   iii)to describe pathological aspects of parasite-induced lesions; iv)to
   evaluate the short-term trend of the infection comparing two different
   hunting seasons; v)to highlight possible relationship between T.
   pisiformis infection and hare-related variables.
   In 2013, 2015 the viscera of 54 and 61 hares legally hunted in
   agro-ecosystems of the Po Plain were collected.
   Peritoneum, liver and lungs were examined for cysticercosis; abundance
   was estimated counting superficial parasites in liver; parasites were
   microscopically identified by shape and measure of both large and small
   hooks. One cysticercus from each hare was analized by a PCR targeting
   Taeniid species and then sequenced. Frozen liver, lungs and
   gastrointestinal peritoneum were macroscopically observed and, after
   thawing, representative samples from the available organs were collected
   for histologic examination to verify parasitic cysts and the subsequent
   damage of the involved organs. Sex, weight and age class of the animals
   were recorded. Generalized linear models were used for statistical
   analysis.
   T. pisiformis was isolated in 8 hares in 2013 (prevalence 14.8\%;
   abundance range: 0-400; mean abundance 17.8) and in 2 hares in 2015
   (prevalence 3.28\%; abundance range: 0-180; mean abundance 3.22).
   Identification was confirmed morphologically and by PCR. The DNA
   sequencing confirmed T. pisiformis in all samples. The sequences were
   all identical each-other. Infection was significantly related with adult
   age class, sampling year and low full-weight.
   Epidemiological and pathological pattern suggest both a possible role on
   host population health and a tendency toward host-parasite equilibrium.},

Abstract = {In the present work, mice overexpressing mutant amyloid precursor
   protein (Tg2576), a transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), are
   used to investigate a specific lipid profile over the course of disease
   progression. Using a targeted lipidomic approach, plasma levels of
   N-acylethanolamines with different length and unsaturation at
   presymptomatic, mild-symptomatic, and symptomatic disease stages are
   measured. Moreover, N-acylethanolamines are also assessed in the brain
   areas most affected in AD. The ethanolamides of palmitic, oleic,
   arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids do not show any
   significant alteration in blood of Tg2576 mice at the different stages
   analyzed, as compared to wild-type. Except for
   N-docosahexaenoylethanolamine, a general tendency to decrease is instead
   detected for all measured N-acylethanolamines in the cortex,
   hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum of symptomatic Tg2576 mice.
   Together, the data can help to redefine the range of lipid-associated
   signals in Alzheimer pathophysiology. Practical Application: The
   development of novel therapies for AD is strongly narrowed not only by
   the lack of a full comprehension of underlying pathophysiological
   mechanisms but also by the absence of affordable, reliable, and
   noninvasive biomarkers. Hence, there is the practical necessity to
   acquire accessible blood biomarkers to provide rapid, cost-effective,
   and critical information to timely identify disease stage and implement
   preventive strategies aimed at slowing down cognitive decline. In this
   study, a targeted lipidomics investigation of N-acylethanolamines at
   different stages of disease progression, clearly indicates that the
   discovery of innovative blood biomarkers should be refocused on
   different indices of deranged lipid metabolism for a realistic
   prediction of the risk of AD. It is investigated that potential
   alterations of N-acylethanolamines content during disease development in
   a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Circulating and
   central N-acylethanolamine levels did not show any alteration in Tg2576
   mice at different disease stages.},

Title = {Isolation of Arcobacter species and other neglected opportunistic agents
   from aborted bovine and caprine fetuses},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {BackgroundInfectious abortion in ruminants is a problem in animal
   husbandry worldwide. It is important to obtain a diagnosis, to make sure
   that proper control measures can be instituted, but most abortion cases
   remain without an etiologic diagnosis. This report describes the
   presence of Arcobacter species and several neglected opportunistic
   abortifacient agents in ruminant abortion cases showing or not
   co-infections among at least one of the major recognized protozoal,
   fungal, bacterial and viral abortifacient agents.ResultsA total of 67
   fetuses (55 cattle and 12 goats) and just one placenta (cattle) were
   considered. Among the most common abortive agents, Neospora caninum
   (19,4\%), followed by Chlamydophila abortus (4,5\%), Listeria
   monocytogenes 1/2a (2,98\%), Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus type 1b
   (2,98\%), Bovine herpesvirus 4 (2,98\%), and Aspergillus spp. (2,98\%)
   were detected. The isolated neglected opportunistic bacteria include
   Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter lwoffii, Staphylococcus spp.,
   Streptococcus spp., Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus suis,
   Trueperella pyogenes, Mannheimia haemolytica, Bacillus cereus and
   Nocardia spp. Other bacterial species, not associated with abortion by
   literature, but described as causes of diseases occurring sporadically
   both in humans and animals, were also detected. Three Arcobacter
   strains, namely two A. skirrowii and one A. cryaerophilus, were isolated
   from 3 bovine aborted fetuses, and A. butzleri was isolated from the
   placenta.ConclusionsA not negligible isolation of Arcobacter species and
   other neglected abortifacient agents has to be mentioned, with
   prevalences that seem to be emerging and replacing or co-placing the
   major infectious players in bovine and caprine reproductive failure due
   to abortion disease, even if further studies investigating the
   aetiological power and transmission routes are needed in order to define
   the role of these microrganisms in ruminant abortion.},

Title = {Improvement of the Sensory Characteristics of Goat Milk Yogurt},

Abstract = {The sensory characteristics of goat yogurt could be greatly improved by
   integrating to a culture typical of yogurt starters, Streptococcus
   thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii spp. bulgaricus, with cultures
   of Leuconostoc lactis. The addition of L. lactis requires the use of the
   definition of ``fermented milk{''} to the product, although it is
   prepared according to the same technology. The experimental plan has
   designed the use of inoculation with a bacterial concentration of at
   least 10(9), for each microbial species considered, with the aim of
   increasing the probiotic effect of yogurt and fermented milk.
   Descriptive analysis of the samples was conducted using the profile
   sheet obtained applying the consensus profiling method (UNI EN ISO
   13299:2010) by a trained panel. The acceptability of our products was
   evaluated by 62 consumers through 7-points hedonic scale. The results of
   this study indicated that the addition of L. lactis to the traditional
   yogurt starter produced a noticeable improvement to the sensory
   characteristics of fermented goat milk. Practical Application To improve
   the sensory characteristics of goat's yogurt to make it more acceptable
   to the consumer and increase market demand we tested the integration of
   Leuconostoc lactis to typical starter cultures. The experimentation
   carried out tested different combinations of fermenting microorganisms
   with the aim of developing a better flavor as compared to that of
   traditional yogurt, which is often unpleasant to consumers. The addition
   of L. lactis to the starter culture of the goat's milk results in less
   aggressive aromatic notes and greater appreciation as confirmed by
   consumers who tested the product.},

Title = {A-to-I editing of Malacoherpesviridae RNAs supports the antiviral role

Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Month = {JUL 23},
Abstract = {BackgroundAdenosine deaminase enzymes of the ADAR family are conserved
   in metazoans. They convert adenine into inosine in dsRNAs and thus alter
   both structural properties and the coding potential of their substrates.
   Acting on exogenous dsRNAs, ADAR1 exerts a pro- or anti-viral role in
   vertebrates and Drosophila.ResultsWe traced 4 ADAR homologs in 14
   lophotrochozoan genomes and we classified them into ADAD, ADAR1 or
   ADAR2, based on phylogenetic and structural analyses of the enzymatic
   domain. Using RNA-seq and quantitative real time PCR we demonstrated the
   upregulation of one ADAR1 homolog in the bivalve Crassostrea gigas and
   in the gastropod Haliotis diversicolor supertexta during Ostreid
   herpesvirus-1 or Haliotid herpesvirus-1 infection. Accordingly, we
   demonstrated an extensive ADAR-mediated editing of viral RNAs. Single
   nucleotide variation (SNV) profiles obtained by pairing RNA- and DNA-seq
   data from the viral infected individuals resulted to be mostly
   compatible with ADAR-mediated A-to-I editing (up to 97\%). SNVs occurred
   at low frequency in genomic hotspots, denoted by the overlapping of
   viral genes encoded on opposite DNA strands. The SNV sites and their
   upstream neighbor nucleotide indicated the targeting of selected
   adenosines. The analysis of viral sequences suggested that, under the
   pressure of the ADAR editing, the two Malacoherpesviridae genomes have
   evolved to reduce the number of deamination targets.ConclusionsWe
   report, for the first time, evidence of an extensive editing of
   Malacoherpesviridae RNAs attributable to host ADAR1 enzymes. The
   analysis of base neighbor preferences, structural features and
   expression profiles of molluscan ADAR1 supports the conservation of the
   enzyme function among metazoans and further suggested that ADAR1 exerts
   an antiviral role in mollusks.},

Abstract = {Aureobasidium pullulans and A. melanogenum are black-yeast-like surface
   colonisers and are commonly encountered as contaminants in the hospital.
   The species are able to produce melanin which play a role in protection
   against environmental stress and irradiation. Aureobasidium melanogenum
   shows higher frequency in opportunistic infections compared to A.
   pullulans. Comparative pathogenicity of opportunistic black yeasts
   between Aureobasidium pullulans and A. melanogenum to explain the
   observed differences in frequency in infection. Degrees of melanisation
   and thermotolerance were measured, and virulence of strains from
   different sources was examined in Galleria mellonela and murine
   infection models. Aureobasidium melanogenum responds with increased
   melanisation to temperature stress and generally survives at 37 degrees
   C, A. pullulans on average scored less on these parameters. In the
   murine model, differences between species were not significant, but the
   melanised A. melanogenum group showed the highest virulence. This result
   was not reproducible in Galleria mellonella larvae at 25 degrees C. The
   A. melanogenum black group showed higher pathogenicity in murine model,
   indicating that the combination of melanisation and thermotolerance
   rather than species affiliation is instrumental. Galleria larvae did not
   survive very well at 37 degrees C, and hence, this model is judged
   insufficient to detect the small virulence differences observed in
   Aureobasidium.},

Abstract = {Dermanyssus gallinae is a haematophagous ectoparasite primarily known as
   a pest of domestic and wild birds. It occasionally feeds on a range of
   mammals, and, more importantly, is of growing concern in human medicine.
   This review highlights mite attacks on people working with poultry, and
   updates the increasing incidence of dermanyssosis in urban environments
   in Europe. Although several cases of dermanyssosis have been documented,
   there are a number of reasons why diagnosis of D. gallinae infestations
   in humans is likely to be underestimated. Firstly, medical specialists
   are not well aware of D. gallinae infestations in humans. There is also
   a lack of collaboration with specialists from other disciplines. The
   problem is compounded by misdiagnoses and by the lack of diagnostic
   tools. We review the literature on human dermanyssosis cases in Europe,
   and also provide information on the epidemiology, clinical,
   histo-pathological and immunological aspects of dermanyssosis. We stress
   the need for improved recognition of this challenging infestation in
   humans, and provide straightforward recommendations for health
   practitioners, starting with collection of the correct anamnestic
   information and including appropriate management methods for case
   recognition and resolution. Finally, we indicate the most urgent areas
   to be addressed by future research.},

Title = {Estimating Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Aedes Albopictus Dispersal to
   Guide Control Interventions in Case of Exotic Arboviruses in Temperate
   Regions},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {The increasing number of exotic arbovirus cases imported in Europe and
   the 2017 chikungunya outbreak in central/southern Italy highlight the
   urgency of evidence-based outbreak management plans to predict, prevent
   or interrupt spreading of these arboviruses to non-endemic countries in
   temperate regions. We here present the results of three
   mark-release-recapture experiments conducted in a peri-urban area of
   North-East Italy to estimate the spatio-temporal dynamics of the
   dispersal of Aedes albopictus females looking for oviposition sites. The
   Flight Range of 90\% of the mosquito population (FR90) was found to
   exceed 200 m, consistently with data obtained from a previous study
   conducted in a highly urbanised area in Rome (Central Italy). Modelling
   results showed that dispersal can be so rapid that insecticide spraying
   within a 200m-radius around a potential infected case leaves >10\%
   probability that a potentially infected mosquito escapes the treatment,
   even if this is carried out after only 2-3 days since the importation of
   a viremic case. These data provide evidence in favour of an update of
   guidelines for the control of exotic autochthonous arbovirus
   transmission in temperate areas and highlight the need of effective
   surveillance approaches and rapid response to contain the risks
   associated to imported viremic cases.},

Abstract = {Wild boars (Sus scrofa) are the most widely distributed large mammals
   and recent increase in consumption of wild boar meat urges the need of
   microbiological quality criteria. The aim of the study was to
   characterize the initial bacterial contamination on freshly-killed wild
   boar meat using a culture-dependent approach with ISO-methods combined
   with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass
   spectrometry identification and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Moreover,
   the presence of foodbome pathogens was examined using Real-Time-PCR and
   confirmed by classical isolation. Analysing 22 unrelated wild boar meat
   samples showed a higher bacterial contamination level compared to pork,
   with Salmonella present in almost one third of the samples. A great
   variability of the microbial contamination between the samples was
   recorded, as well as complementary results between culturing and 16S
   rRNA amplicon sequencing as frequently isolated genera were not always
   detected, and vice versa. Furthermore, the foodborne pathogen Salmonella
   was never detected with 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, demonstrating the
   necessity for a cautious approach in the implementation of new analysis
   techniques in food safety. The present work determines that attention
   should be paid to the trade of non-inspected meat directly to retail or
   consumers.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the Mediterranean Sea has become an accumulation zone
   for waste generated by the 22 countries bordering its shores. Although
   the effects of plastic litter on the marine environment and on organisms
   have recently been studied in other areas, further information is needed
   for the Mediterranean Sea and, in particular, about plastics additives
   inputs and interactions with the biota and the trophic network, such as
   phthalates and bisphenol A. Plastic material production, use and
   disposal contribute also to the release of heavy metals into the
   environment, such as mercury (Hg), often used during the production of
   chlorine, the primary ingredient in PVC, lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd),
   which are used as stabilizers in PVC and leach out of products during
   use and disposal. Our research aims to evaluate phthalates, bisphenol A
   and heavy metals contamination in Lepidopus caudatus (Pisces,
   Trichiuridae), which could be considered as a potential sentinel
   species. For the evaluation of toxicological effects, we evaluated the
   expression of vitellogenin and metallothioneins 1. In all samples
   analyzed, we have not found microplastics in the gastrointestinal tract
   but chemical analysis revealed the presence of high content of
   phthalates, and in particular high quantities of DIDP, DEHP,
   bis-benzylester phthalate, bis-butyl ester phthalate and mono-N-butyl
   ester phthalate in different organs. Instead, trace elements detected in
   tissue revealed a trend of concentrations generally higher in liver and
   intestine than gill and muscle tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis for
   anti-metallothionein 1 antibody showed a strong positivity of liver
   cells, both in females and males. Analysis for the anti-vitellogenin
   antibody showed in females a strong positivity both in the liver cells
   and in the gonads, in male specimens was found to be always negative
   except for a specimen, in which it was highlighted a positivity in some
   areas of the liver and of the gonad.},

Abstract = {This study comprehensively interprets the contamination status of
   organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in the soils from Benevento provincial
   territory, southern Italy, and its implications for environmental health
   by means of a systematic grid sampling method and geostatistics. The
   total concentrations of OCPs in the soils ranged from 0.058 to 16.9
   ng/g, with a geometric mean (GM) of 0.72 ng/g and an arithmetic mean
   (AM) of 1.71 ng/g. The levels of OCPs were dominated by p,p'-DDE,
   p,p'-DDD, HCB, contributing together to 73.5\% of the total OCPs. The
   higher levels of HCB, DDTs, and HCHs found in southwestern, central and
   east Benevento provincial territory, all occurring adjacent to landfill
   sites. The residues of OCPs in soil are largely ascribed to their
   historical use. The OCP inventories in soils of Benevento provincial
   territory ranged from 0.13 to 4.84 metric tons, with GM = 0.42 metric
   tons and AM = 0.44 metric tons. The soil is likely to be a sink for DDTs
   under the influence of regional air transport from pollution hotspots
   and has the potential to release other chemicals with a high vapor
   pressure, e.g., HCB, HCHs, and alpha-Endosulfan. And the mean level of
   the air-soil exchange flux of HCB, HCHs, and DDTs is estimated to be
   -1.59, -0.72, and 0.10 ng/m(2)/day respectively. The potential
   ecological and human health risks caused by OCPs in the soils are deemed
   essentially negligible in Benevento provincial territory. (C) 2019

Abstract = {Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) emerged as dog pathogen in the late
   1970s, causing severe and often fatal epizootics of gastroenteritis in
   the canine population worldwide. Although to date CPV-2 is circulating
   in all continents, most of the current studies have analysed the amino
   acid changes accounted in the VP2 gene sequence, with limited
   information on virus introductions from other countries. The aim of this
   study was to analyse the genetic features of CPV-2c strains currently
   spreading in Italy. Swabs and tissue samples were collected from dogs
   suspected of CPV infection. The nearly complete genome sequence from the
   CPV-positive samples was obtained. The co-circulation of two different
   but related CPV-2c strains, with amino acid changes characteristic of
   CPV strains of Asian origin (NS1: 60V, 544F, 545F, 630P - NS2: 60V,
   151N, 152V - VP2: 5A/G, 267Y, 297A, 324I, 370R), were observed. The
   phylogenetic analyses inferred from the NS1 and VP2 gene sequences
   confirmed the relationship with Asian CPV-2c strains. This study reports
   the spread of novel CPV-2c mutants in Italy and supports further studies
   to evaluate the coexistence of genetically divergent CPV strains in the
   same geographical environment.},

Abstract = {Information concerning the pathogenic role of honey bee viruses in
   invasive species are still scarce. The aim of this investigation was to
   assess the presence of several honey bee viruses, such as Black Queen
   Cell Virus (BQCV), Kashmir Bee Virus (KBV), Slow Paralysis Virus (SPV),
   Sac Brood Virus (SBV), Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV), Acute Bee
   Paralysis Virus (ABPV), Chronic Bee Paralysis Virus (CBPV), in Vespa
   velutina specimens collected in Italy during 2017. Results of this
   investigation indicate that among pathogens, replicative form of KBV and
   BQCV were detected, assessing the spillover effect of both these viruses
   from managed honey bees to hornets.},

Title = {A single nucleotide variant in the promoter region of the CCR5 gene
   increases susceptibility to arthritis encephalitis virus in goats},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JUL 6},
Abstract = {BackgroundThe small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs) are a heterogeneous
   group of viruses that includes caprine arthritis encephalitis virus
   (CAEV) and Maedi-Visna virus (MVV). SRLVs affect the production and
   welfare of sheep and goats worldwide. There is currently no effective
   treatment. Their high mutation rate precludes vaccine development,
   making innovative control measures necessary.A variant of the chemokine
   (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5) gene is reportedly involved in resistance
   to human immunodeficiency (HIV) infection in humans and to SRLV in
   sheep. The aim of this study was to analyse the genetic structure and
   variability of the CCR5 gene in goats and to carry out a cross-sectional
   study to investigate the role of CCR5 genetic variants in controlling
   susceptibility/resistance to CAEV.ResultsThe variant g.1059T located in
   the promoter region revealed an interesting association with high
   proviral loads (a 2.8-fold increased risk). A possible explanation could
   be an alteration of the transcriptional level. Overexpression of the
   CCR5 receptor on the cell surface may increase virus internalization and
   proviral load as a consequence.ConclusionsOur findings could be
   advantageously used to reduce the susceptibility of goat herds to CAEV
   by negatively selecting animals carrying the g.1059T mutation.
   Eliminating animals predisposed to high proviral loads could also limit
   the development of clinical signs and the spread of the virus, since
   these animals are also highly efficient in shedding the virus.},

Abstract = {The issue of whether market fish can be involved in the transmission of
   Toxoplasma gondii in the marine environment is highly debated since
   toxoplasmosis has been diagnosed frequently in cetaceans stranded along
   the Mediterranean coastlines in recent times. To support the hypothesis
   that fishes can harbour and effectively transmit the parasite to
   top-of-the-food-chain marine organisms and to human consumers of fishery
   products, a total of 1,293 fishes from 17 species obtained from
   wholesale and local fish markets were examined for T. gondii DNA.
   Real-time PCR was performed in samples obtained by separately pooling
   intestines, gills and skin/muscles collected from each fish species.
   Thirty-two out of 147 pooled samples from 12 different fish species were
   found contaminated with T. gondii DNA that was detected in 16 samples of
   skin/muscle and in 11 samples of both intestine and gills. Quantitative
   analysis of amplified DNA performed by both real-time PCR and digital
   PCR (dPCR) confirmed that positive fish samples were contaminated with
   Toxoplasma genomic DNA to an extent of 6.10 x 10(-2) to 2.77 x 10(4)
   copies/ml (quantitative PCR) and of 1 to 5.7 x 10(4) copies/ml (dPCR).
   Fishes are not considered competent biological hosts for T. gondii;
   nonetheless, they can be contaminated with T. gondii oocysts flowing via
   freshwater run-offs (untreated sewage discharges, soil flooding) into
   the marine environment, thus acting as mechanical carriers. Although the
   detection of viable and infective T. gondii oocysts was not the
   objective of this investigation, the results here reported suggest that
   fish species sold for human consumption can be accidentally involved in
   the transmission route of the parasite in the marine environment and
   that the risk of foodborne transmission of toxoplasmosis to fish
   consumers should be further investigated.},

Title = {First report of the invasive mosquito Aedes koreicus (Diptera:
   Culicidae) and of its establishment in Liguria, northwest Italy},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JUL 5},
Abstract = {BackgroundInvasive mosquito species (IMS) of the genus Aedes are a cause
   of increasing concern in Europe owing to their ability to vector
   important human viral diseases. Entomological surveillance to early
   detect alien mosquito and flavivirus circulation in Liguria, northwest
   Italy, has been carried out since 2011.ResultsThe invasive species Aedes
   koreicus was first detected in Genoa in September 2015, when a male
   specimen was caught near the international airport; species identity was
   confirmed by genetic analysis. Over the next three years, 86 more adult
   specimens were trapped at sites throughout the city, accounting for
   0.50\% of all mosquitoes and 1.04\% of Aedes sp. mosquitoes trapped in
   Genova in the four-year period 2015-2018. So far, no other monitored
   sites in Liguria have revealed the presence of this species. Ovitraps at
   two sites became positive for the species in July-August 2017. All
   female Ae. koreicus pools analysed were negative in biomolecular assays
   for Flavivirus.ConclusionsOur findings of Ae. koreicus in Genoa
   constitute, to the best of our knowledge, the first report of the
   species in northwest Italy and in a Mediterranean port city. The species
   appears to be established; trapping and climatic data support survival
   of Ae. koreicus in the area through three consecutive winters.
   Monitoring of adult mosquitoes detected the species two years before its
   discovery with ovitraps; trapping for adult specimens appears to be a
   more effective tool for the early detection of IMS. The airport (located
   near the commercial port area) and the flower market are the most
   probable sites of introduction; however, the exact time and place of
   arrival of this IMS in Liguria remain unknown. Based on morphological
   and genetic data, a common origin for most of the Ae. koreicus
   populations established in Europe is suspected. So far, no control
   measures have been adopted in Genoa and the species will probably
   colonize an even wider area in the next few years.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUL 5},
Abstract = {Dolphin morbillivirus (DMV) has been responsible for several outbreaks
   of systemic infection and has resulted in cetacean strandings in the
   Mediterranean. In August-October 2016, seven striped dolphins (Stenella
   coeruleoalba) stranded on the Sicilian coastline (Italy) tested positive
   for DMV. Tissue samples from brain, lung, pulmonary lymph nodes, heart,
   spleen, liver, stomach, intestine, kidneys and urinary bladder, as well
   as blowhole swabs, were collected during necropsy for molecular
   diagnostics and pathology studies. Extracted tissue RNA was screened for
   DMV by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
   Some tissues exhibited microscopic lesions that were consistent with DMV
   infection on histopathological and immunohistochemical grounds.
   Conventional reverse transcription PCR to target partial nucleoprotein
   and phosphoprotein genes yielded sequences used to genetically
   characterize the associated DMV strain. DMV RNA was detected by both PCR
   assays in all tested tissues of the seven dolphins, which suggests
   systemic infections, but was absent from another dolphin stranded on the
   Sicilian coastline during the same period. The partial phosphoprotein
   and nucleoprotein gene sequences from the positive dolphins were 99.7\%
   and 99.5\% identical, respectively, to the DMV sequences recently
   observed in cetaceans stranded on the Spanish Mediterranean. Our study
   suggests that this DMV strain is circulating in the Mediterranean.},

Title = {Real-time PCR detection of Toxoplasma gondii in tissue samples of wild

   parasite load},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JUL 5},
Abstract = {BackgroundToxoplasmosis is a zoonotic parasitic disease caused by
   Toxoplasma gondii, a widespread protozoan in the phylum Apicomplexa. In
   Europe, several studies have demonstrated the presence of the parasite
   in tissues of wild boars (Sus scrofa), but no data exists on the T.
   gondii load in tissues which in turn may be an useful way to assess the
   infection risk for the consumer of wild boar meat.MethodsWe sampled and
   tested a total of 472 tissue samples of brain, heart and masseter muscle
   from 177 wild boars from the Campania region of southern Italy by
   real-time PCR analyses for detection and quantification of T. gondii.
   The sensitivity and specificity of the method were calculated by ROC
   analysis curves.ResultsPCR analysis revealed the presence of T. gondii
   in tissue samples of 78 out of 177 (44\%) wild boars. In general, the
   brain presented the highest PCR prevalence (31\%), followed by the heart
   (28.3\%) and the masseter muscle (24.2\%), with the highest estimated
   parasite numbers observed in the brain followed by the heart and
   masseter muscle. The PCR method showed an excellent discriminating
   ability for each of the examined tissues. According to the ROC analysis
   curves, the respective sensitivity and specificity were 99 and 100\% for
   masseter muscle, 98 and 98\% for brain and 96 and 98\% for heart
   samples.ConclusionsThe high prevalence of infection here detected
   suggests a widespread distribution of the parasite in the wildlife of
   the Campania region of southern Italy. The T. gondii burdens detected
   may potentially represent a source of infection for humans.},

Abstract = {Ecoregionalization is the process by which a territory is classified in
   similar areas according to specific environmental and climatic factors.
   The climate and the environment strongly influence the presence and
   distribution of vectors responsible for significant human and animal
   diseases worldwide. In this paper, we developed a map of the
   eco-climatic regions of Italy adopting a data-driven spatial clustering
   approach using recent and detailed spatial data on climatic and
   environmental factors. We selected seven variables, relevant for a broad
   set of human and animal vector-borne diseases (VBDs): standard deviation
   of altitude, mean daytime land surface temperature, mean amplitude and
   peak timing of the annual cycle of land surface temperature, mean and
   amplitude of the annual cycle of greenness value, and daily mean amount
   of rainfall. Principal Component Analysis followed by multivariate
   geographic clustering using the k-medoids technique were used to group
   the pixels with similar characteristics into different ecoregions, and
   at different spatial resolutions (250 m, 1 km and 2 km). We showed that
   the spatial structure of ecoregions is generally maintained at different
   spatial resolutions and we compared the resulting ecoregion maps with
   two datasets related to Bluetongue vectors and West Nile Disease (WND)
   outbreaks in Italy. The known characteristics of Culicoides imicola
   habitat were well captured by 2/22 specific ecoregions (at 250 m
   resolution). Culicoides obsoletus/scoticus occupy all sampled
   ecoregions, according to its known widespread distribution across the
   peninsula. WND outbreak locations strongly cluster in 4/22 ecoregions,
   dominated by human influenced landscape, with intense cultivations and
   complex irrigation network. This approach could be a supportive tool in
   case of VBDs, defining pixel-based areas that are conducive environment
   for VBD spread, indicating where surveillance and prevention measures
   could be prioritized in Italy. Also, ecoregions suitable to specific
   VBDs vectors could inform entomological surveillance strategies.},

Abstract = {To assess the quality of shellfish harvest areas, bivalve mollusk
   samples from three coastal areas of the Campania region in Southwest
   Italy were evaluated for viruses over a three-year period (2015-2017).
   Screening of 289 samples from shellfish farms and other locations by
   qPCR and RT-qPCR identified hepatitis A virus (HAV; 8.9\%), norovirus GI
   (NoVGI; 10.8\%) and GII (NoVGII; 39.7\%), rotavirus (RV; 9.0\%),
   astrovirus (AsV; 20.8\%), sapovirus (SaV; 18.8\%), aichivirus-1 (AiV-1;
   5.6\%), and adenovirus (AdV, 5.6\%). Hepatitis E virus (HEV) was never
   detected. Sequence analysis identified HAV as genotype IA and AdV as
   type 41. This study demonstrates the presence of different enteric
   viruses within bivalve mollusks, highlighting the limitations of the
   current EU classification system for shellfish growing waters.},

Title = {Felis catus Papillomavirus Types 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in Feline Bowenoid in

Journal = {VETERINARY PATHOLOGY},

Volume = {56},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Several studies based on histopathology or molecular investigations
   suggest a causal relation between Felis catus papillomavirus (FcaPV-2)
   infection and bowenoid in situ carcinoma (BISC) in cats. Nevertheless,
   data on distribution of viral DNA for different F. catus papillomavirus
   types (FcaPV-1, 2, 3, 4, 5) in precancerous skin lesions are lacking. In
   this study, incisional and excisional skin biopsies from 18 cats with
   BISC were investigated for the presence of FcaPV DNA by quantitative
   polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and chromogenic in situ hybridization
   (CISH) using specific probes to detect each of the FcaPVs that have been
   identified so far. By qPCR analysis, 15 of 18 samples were positive for
   FcaPV-2, 2 were positive for FcaPV-4, and 1 sample was negative for all
   FcaPVs studied. Two cases were positive for FcaPV-5 by qPCR only.
   FcaPV-1 and FcaPV-3 were not detected by either method. CISH positivity
   for FcaPV-2 and FcaPV-4 was 100\% concordant with qPCR. FcaPV-2 CISH
   signal was observed as nuclear dots within grouped neoplastic
   keratinocytes in 12 BISCs and in the perilesional skin of 9 biopsies. In
   3 of these 9 cases, the signal was not observed within the BISC. FcaPV-4
   CISH positivity was detected only within BISCs in 2 cases. The overall
   rate of concordance for FcaPV detection between PCR and CISH was 97.8\%.
   This study suggests that CISH is a reliable method to detect FcaPV-2 and
   FcaPV-4 infection in cats and provides useful information on the type,
   rate, and localization of infected cells.},

Title = {Detection of fish species substitution frauds in Italy: A targeted

Journal = {FOOD CONTROL},

Volume = {101},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Fighting food frauds is a ceaseless challenge because of the constant
   evolution of fraudulent practices and for the consequences both on
   consumers' and on globalized trade. In Italy fish is a vulnerable
   commodity for frauds thanks to the high national production, importation
   and consumption and it is important to monitor the entire food chain in
   order to detect and prevent fraudulent actions, such as species
   substitutions, which is considered the most common fraud in seafood.
   Aim of this study was to realise a targeted Monitoring Plan to estimate
   the prevalence of fish species substitutions in Italy. As a first step,
   Italian fish supply chain, from production to selling, was analysed, in
   order to identify products and chain points at risk, by reviewing
   literature and by involving, in two focus groups, food inspectors and
   representatives of the large scale food distribution system. Then a
   monitoring plan was designed by sampling three fish species considered
   at major risk for their economic value and/or large consumption, i.e.
   tuna, grouper and flat fishes, at different selling points (wholesale
   markets, retail markets, fish shops and supermarkets). From February to
   March 2017, 242 samples from fresh, frozen or transformed whole fishes
   or fillets were sampled in 13 Italian cities (5 in Northern Italy, 2 in
   Central Italy, 3 in Southern Italy and 3 in the main Islands). Samples
   were analysed by ``FINS{''} (Forensically Informative Nucleotide
   Sequencing), using two markers: cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene (COO
   as first option and then mitochondrial cytochrome B gene (cytb), if
   necessary to identify uncertain or unassigned samples. Species
   substitutions were uncovered in 8.7\% of analysed samples, principally
   related to grouper (prevalence of 14.71\%). Supermarkets resulted the
   selling points with a major number of frauds (prevalence of 12.79\%).
   Substituted species were taxonomically related to those declared on the
   label and no species harmful for consumers were detected. Results
   obtained can give to National Authorities a detailed frame of trends in
   fish substitution frauds in Italy, providing also relevant information
   to put into effect control measures.},

Abstract = {Background Treatment options for at-home management of cluster seizures
   (CS) and status epilepticus (SE) are limited. The pharmacokinetics of
   levetiracetam (LEV) after rectal administration in both healthy and
   epileptic dogs has been investigated recently. Hypothesis/Objectives To
   investigate the clinical efficacy of rectally administered LEV in
   preventing additional seizures in dogs presented for CS and SE. We
   hypothesized that rectal administration of LEV in addition to a standard
   treatment protocol would provide better control of seizure activity as
   compared with the standard treatment protocol alone. Animals Fifty-seven
   client-owned dogs with CS or SE. Methods Prospective open-label clinical
   trial. Patients included in the study were assigned to receive either a
   standard treatment protocol comprising IV/rectal diazepam and IV
   phenobarbital q8h (control group) or a standard treatment protocol in
   association with a single dose of 40 mg/kg LEV rectally (rectal LEV
   group). Dogs that experienced no additional seizures were defined as
   responders, whereas those that showed additional seizure activity were
   classified as nonresponders. Results Twenty-one dogs were assigned to
   the rectal LEV group, and 36 to control group. Given the small number of
   cases of SE, statistical analysis was performed only on patients with
   CS. The response rate was 94\% in the rectal LEV group and 48\% in the
   control group (P < .001). Conclusions and Clinical Importance Rectally
   administered LEV combined with a standard treatment protocol provided
   good control of seizure activity in patients with CS. The validity of
   these results should be confirmed in a double-blinded,
   placebo-controlled clinical trial.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the role of Listeria monocytogenes as a foodborne
   pathogen in public health has increased. Its presence poses a risk for
   humans, especially in ready-to-eat foods, such as ham. Understanding the
   presence and distribution of Listeria spp. on swine carcasses meant for
   Italian dry-cured hams can be a useful tool to improve food safety. This
   study assessed the distribution of Listeria spp. (as a marker of
   contamination with L. monocytogenes) on slaughtered pig carcasses
   intended for the production of high-quality, Italian, dry-cured ham and
   examined the roles of the site sampled on the carcass, farming cycle
   (open versus closed), farm-to-slaughterhouse distance, and time spent in
   lairage. Samples were collected from swine carcasses (n = 150) before
   refrigeration, from three different carcass locations (head, shoulder,
   and thigh), and assessed for the presence of listeriae. A total of 115
   carcasses were contaminated with Listeria spp. in at least one location.
   In all, 178 listeriae were isolated and identified: 130 Listeria
   innocua, 28 Listeria welshimeri, 17 Listeria ivanovii, and 3 L.
   monocytogenes. Listeriae were detected on 62.7\% of heads, on 25.3\% of
   shoulders, and on 30.7\% of thighs, with significant differences between
   heads versus shoulders and thighs. Animals reared in closed-cycle farms
   were more contaminated (P, 0.05) than were animals from opencycle farms
   (90 versus 71.8\%). The distance between farms and slaughterhouse was
   not related to the contamination rate. Carcasses of swine that stayed in
   lairage before slaughtering for more than 10 h showed a higher degree of
   contamination (90\%) and were positive for Listeria spp. in more sample
   sites (55\%) compared with those held for less than 2 h (73\% of
   carcasses and 33.3\% of samples). Our results show that heads should be
   detached from carcasses immediately after slaughter for meat-safety
   purposes and the amount of time animals stay in lairage should be
   limited. These results will be useful for a more-valid implementation of
   good manufacturing processes for slaughtering.},

Abstract = {Bluetongue virus (BTV) is a segmented double-stranded RNA virus,
   existing in multiple serotypes, belonging to the genus Orbivirus of the
   family Reoviridae. BTV causes Bluetongue (BT), a major OIE-listed
   disease of ruminants. Identification of BTV serotype is accomplished
   using multiple typing assays and tends to be executed based on the known
   epidemiological situation within a given country. Samples containing
   multiple serotypes, particularly those containing novel introductions,
   may therefore be missed. The aim of this work was to optimize the
   nCounter (R) Analysis System Microarray platform (NanoString
   technologies), that would simultaneously identify all BTV serotypes and
   co-infections in analyzed samples. Probes were designed according to all
   Seg-2 sequences, coding for VP2 proteins which determine serotype
   specificity, available on line. A specific BTV CodeSet of probes was
   optimized. Experiments were performed with 30 BTV isolates and with 46
   field samples previously shown to be infected with BTV by classical
   molecular assays. All BTV isolates were correctly identified and the
   expected BTV serotype was recognized in 35 field samples with C-T values
   between 22.0-33.0. In turn, it was unable to identify 11 samples with
   C-T values between 29.0-38.0. Although specificity of the assay needs to
   be further investigated against a larger panel of BTVs collected
   worldwide, RNA loads, which are normally detected in blood samples
   during the acute phase of infection, are within the range of CT values
   detectable by the BTV CodeSet. We propose the NanoString RNA microarray
   as a first-line molecular diagnostic tool for identification and typing
   of BTV. Once identification of the index cases is performed, diagnosis
   of the following samples may be performed by specific, more sensitive
   and cheaper PCR-based tools.},

Abstract = {Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is associated with multi-factorial
   syndromes, commonly known as porcine-circovirus-associated diseases,
   which cause severe economic losses in the swine industry worldwide. Four
   genotypes (PCV2a, PCV2b, PCV2c, and PCV2d) have been identified. Lately,
   the prevalence of PCV2d has been increasing in many countries, thereby
   prefiguring a global replacement of PCV2b. Wild boars are also
   susceptible to PCV2 infection, with virus prevalence similar to that of
   domestic pigs. This work was aimed at expanding the knowledge about the
   molecular epidemiology of PCV2 in Italy. For this purpose, we analysed
   40 complete ORF-2 sequences from PCV2 strains isolated from domestic
   pigs and wild boars in Sardinia (Italy) over a period of 5 years
   (2009-2013). Phylogenetic and Bayesian analyses were performed on three
   data sets compiled from DNA sequences over a large geographical area.
   PCV2b was found to be dominant in Sardinia, whereas no PCV2a and PCV2c
   were found. This study indicates the presence of genotype PCV2d-2
   infecting both domestic and wild pigs, thus confirming its circulation
   in Italy. Sardinian sequences clustered mostly with Italian isolates and
   with strains from China, Belgium, Croatia, Taiwan, Korea, and Portugal.
   Genetic variability of PCV2 in Sardinia appears to be a result of both
   local viral evolution and different epidemic introduction events.},

Abstract = {Ex vivo organ cultures (EVOCs) are extensively used to study the
   cellular tropism and infectivity of different pathogens. In this study,
   we used ovine and porcine respiratory EVOCs to investigate the
   replication kinetics and cellular tropism of selected emerging
   reoviruses namely Pteropine orthoreovirus, an emerging bat-borne
   zoonotic respiratory virus, and atypical Bluetongue virus (BTV)
   serotypes which, unlike classical serotypes, do not cause Bluetongue, a
   major OIE-listed disease of ruminants. BTV failed to replicate in ovine
   EVOCs. Instead, PRV showed slight replication in porcine lower
   respiratory EVOCs and a more sustained replication in all ovine
   respiratory tissues. By confocal laser scanning microscopy, PRV was
   demonstrated to infect bronchiolar and type I pneumocytes of ovine
   tissues. Overall, respiratory EVOCs from different animal species,
   eventually obtained at slaughterhouse, are a useful tool for testing and
   preliminarily characterize novel and emerging viruses addressing the
   essential in vivo animal work. Further experiments are, indeed,
   warranted in order to characterize the pathogenesis and transmission of
   these emerging reoviruses.},

Abstract = {The use of food dyes in meat is subject to regulations, due to food
   safety concerns.
   A reliable method for the determination of 12 food dyes (Amaranth,
   Ponceau 4R, Carmine, Ponceau SX, Ponceau 3R, Allura Red AC, Carmoisine,
   Erythrosine, Sudan I, Sudan II, Sudan III and Sudan IV) in meat products
   using high performance liquid chromatography coupled to UV-diode array
   detection was developed, optimized and fully validated.
   The extraction was accomplished using acetonitrile, methanol, water,
   ammonia, 50:40:9:1 (v/v/v/v) as the solvent, and an ultrasonic bath.
   Chromatographic separation was achieved using a C-18 RP column and
   samples eluted with a gradient acetate-acetonitrile mobile phase.
   Good analytical performance was obtained, in terms of selectivity,
   sensitivity, accuracy and ruggedness. Both method precision (CV\% range:
   6.2\%-18.0\%) and recovery (range: 86.4\%-105.0\%) complied with
   Decision 657/2002/EC, suggesting the procedure could be applied
   successfully for analyses of meat products in the European Union.},

Abstract = {The larval stage of the species complex Echinococcus granulosus sensu
   lato (s.l.) is the cause of a widespread zoonotic disease known as
   cystic echinococcosis (CE). The disease is highly prevalent in southern
   Italy and represents a serious public health issue. The main aim of this
   study was to characterize E. granulosus s.l. genotypes from wild boar on
   a continental area of Italy (Campania region), using recently developed
   mtDNA markers of nad2 and nad5 for reliable identification of different
   genotypes. Here, nad5 (680bp) allowed for a clear identification of G1
   and G3, whereas a combination of nad2 (714bp) and nad5 (1394bp in total)
   did the same for genotype G7 and its haplogroups G7a and G7b. The
   results of this study revealed for the first time the presence of
   genotype G7 in continental Italy. While haplogroup G7b was previously
   shown to be restricted to the islands of Corsica and Sardinia, here we
   demonstrate that haplogroup G7b is also present on the mainland of
   Italy. This work has implications in designing future strategies to
   reduce CE in Italy.},

Title = {Genotype diversity and distribution of Mycobacterium bovis from

Abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) caused by Mycobacterium bovis is an important
   re-emerging disease affecting livestock, wildlife and humans.
   Epidemiological studies are crucial to identifying the source of bTB
   infection, and its transmission dynamics and host preference, and thus
   to the implementation of effective strategies to contain it. In this
   study, we typed M. bovis isolates from livestock, and investigated their
   genetic diversity and distribution. A total of 204 M. bovis isolates
   were collected from cattle (n = 164) and Sicilian black pigs (n = 40)
   reared in a limited area of the province of Messina, northeastern
   Sicily, an area that had previously been identified as having the
   highest incidence of bTB in livestock on the island. All M. bovis
   isolates were typed by both spoligotyping and 12-loci MIRU-VNTR
   analysis. Results from both methods were then combined in order to
   improve the discriminatory power of M. bovis typing. We identified 73
   combined genetic profiles. Thirty-five point six percent of the profiles
   were common to at least two animals, whereas 64.4\% of profiles occurred
   in only one animal. A number of genetic profiles were predominant in
   either cattle or black pigs. We identified common genetic patterns in M.
   bovis isolates originating not only from neighboring districts, but also
   from non-neighboring districts. Our findings suggest that bTB is
   widespread in our setting, and is caused by a large number of
   genetically diverse M. bovis strains. The ecology and farming practices
   characteristic of the area may explain the substantial M. bovis
   heterogeneity observed, and could represent obstacles to bTB
   eradication.
   Author summary Bovine tuberculosis is a widespread infectious disease
   affecting both domestic and wild animals, as well as humans. In addition
   to being of public health concern, the disease, caused mainly by
   Mycobacterium bovis, has a significant economic impact on the farming
   industry due to the costs of eradication efforts. In Sicily, the largest
   of the Italian islands, bovine tuberculosis in livestock is of great
   concern, and targeted control strategies are needed. Molecular
   epidemiology is an essential tool for determining the distribution of a
   disease, so as to control it and minimize its threat to the population.
   We typed M. bovis isolates isolated from cattle and pigs reared in a
   limited area of Sicily. An in-depth comparison of the genetic makeup of
   these isolates allowed us a better understanding of the genetic
   diversity and distribution of the pathogen in our population of animals.
   We found that the disease is widespread in the area and caused by a
   large variety of M. bovis strains, which are in several cases common to
   different species of livestock. The paper concludes with a discussion of
   the findings in light of the environmental and ecological setting, and
   of farming practices in the area. The results are expected to contribute
   to the improvement of surveillance and control programs of bovine
   tuberculosis in the region.},

Abstract = {Scrapie resistance or susceptibility in sheep is associated with single
   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at codons 136, 154, and 171 of the prion
   protein gene (PRNP). In addition, phenylalanine mutation at codon 141
   has been recognized as a risk factor for atypical scrapie. In contrast,
   K222, D146, and S146 alleles confer genetic resistance to classical
   scrapie in goats. High-throughput genotyping technologies would provide
   significant benefits in scrapie eradication plans. The ability to
   resolve oligonucleotides varying in mass by less than a single
   nucleotide makes MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) a suitable platform
   for PRNP genotyping. We evaluated the commercial Myriapod scrapie kit
   (Diatech Pharmacogenetics), associated with a highly automated
   processing platform incorporating MALDI-TOF MS technology, to detect
   SNPs at codons 136, 154, 171, 141, and 222 of small ruminant PRNP. The
   Myriapod scrapie kit was accredited according to UNI CEI EN ISO/IEC
   17025. We present the genotyping results of 10,960 sheep in Sicily and
   1,822 goats in Sicily and Calabria (southern Italy) tested during 2017.
   We found a high frequency (43.9\%) of the protective ARR allele in sheep
   and a promising 12.3\% of the resistant K222 variant in goats. This
   efficient and high-throughput method is suitable for extensive PRNP
   genotyping, as requested in the European scrapie eradication plan.},

Abstract = {Aphanomyces astaci causes crayfish plague, which is a devastating
   disease of European freshwater crayfish. The likely first introduction
   of A. astaci into Europe was in the mid-19th century in Italy,
   presumably with the introduction of North American crayfish. These
   crayfish can carry A. astaci in their cuticle as a benign infection.
   Aphanomyces astaci rapidly spread across Europe causing the decline of
   the highly susceptible indigenous crayfish species. Random amplified
   polymorphic DNA-PCR analysis of A. astaci pure cultures characterized
   five genotype groups (A, B, C, D and E). Current A. astaci genotyping
   techniques (microsatellites and genotype-specific regions, both
   targeting nuclear DNA) can be applied directly to DNA extracted from
   infected cuticles but require high infection levels. Therefore, they are
   not suitable for genotyping benign infections in North American crayfish
   (carriers). In the present study, we combine bioinformatics and
   molecular biology techniques to develop A. astaci genotyping molecular
   markers that target the mitochondrial DNA, increasing the sensitivity of
   the genotyping tools. The assays were validated on DNA extracts of A.
   astaci pure cultures, crayfish tissue extractions from crayfish plague
   outbreaks and tissue extractions from North American carriers. We
   demonstrate the presence of A. astaci genotype groups A and B in UK
   waters.},

   laboratory-confirmed cases of norovirus GL Nine staff members were
   interviewed, six were confirmed positive for NoV GI and 3 experienced GE
   symptoms. Bacteria faecal indicators and other bacteria pathogens were
   not detected in either environmental swab samples or food. A low level
   of NoV GII was detected in two environmental swab samples. The same GI.6
   strain was identified in cases related to both outbreaks, suggesting a
   common source of infection. Since the two outbreaks occurred in one
   week, the NoV contamination could have persisted in the cafeteria.
   Furthermore, virological investigation revealed confirmed cases among
   food handlers who had worked at the cafeteria between and during the two
   outbreaks. Several studies highlighted the importance of excluding
   symptomatic food handlers to prevent contamination of foods and
   environment.},

Title = {Detection of trace elements in freshwater macrobenthic invertebrates of

Abstract = {Trace elements are common contaminants in aquatic ecosystems; their
   detection in biota yields information on their availability in the
   environment and provides an indirect indication of freshwater ecological
   status. We analyzed samples of freshwater macrobenthic invertebrates
   from six watercourses in Friuli Venezia-Giulia (Northeast Italy) to
   verify whether trace elements accumulation is related to their
   ecological status sensu Water Framework Directive (WFD), and to
   determine tropic level influences on the accumulation of 18 trace
   elements in macrobenthic communities. Observed concentrations could be
   in line with results of ecological status assessment defined by the WFD,
   in fact two sites classified as ``Moderate'' had the highest trace
   elements content. The genus Calopteryx (Odonata, predator) was
   positively correlated with Be, Cr, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Sn, and V (rho(S)
   range 0.777-0.844). Positive correlations were also determined for the
   genus Rhyacophila (Trichoptera, predator) with Cu (rho(S) = 0.757),
   suggesting bioaccumulation in macroinvertebrate tissue. Ephemeroptera of
   the genus Caenis (collector-gatherers) were positively correlated with
   Be, Fe, Mn, Pb, Sb, and V (rho(S) range 0.757-0.802), indicating that
   ingestion of sediment is the most effective uptake of these metals.
   Results of this study, albeit preliminary, showed that trace elements
   detection in aquatic macrobenthic invertebrates is a useful analysis for
   obtaining information about the status of freshwater course. Our study
   provides evidence for a greater accumulation of trace elements in
   predators and collector-gatherers, suggesting that the tropic level of
   macrobenthic communities influence the accumulation of trace elements.

Title = {Review: Insects and former foodstuffs for upgrading food waste
   biomasses/streams to feed ingredients for farm animals},
Journal = {ANIMAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Number = {7},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The increasing global need to find alternative protein/energy sources
   has triggered research in the field of non-conventional feed
   ingredients, with insects and former foodstuffs being the most
   promising. Insects contain high level of protein and fat, whereas former
   foodstuffs contain high energy in the form of carbohydrates and fats;
   therefore, both should be considered as promising alternative feed
   ingredients for livestock production. In addition to the nutritional
   value, they also represent a way by which food waste biomasses/streams
   can be upgraded to valuable feed ingredients. This review outlines the
   main nutritional and safety issues of insects and former foodstuffs, and
   also considers the legal framework involved. The importance of the type
   of insect metamorphosis and tailored substrates that could lead to the
   production of a premium feed is also described. This is also the first
   time that a review discusses the nutritional quality of former
   foodstuffs. Energy and the main nutrient content of former foodstuff are
   compared with the composition of common cereals as the principal energy
   sources in animal feed. For both ingredients a critical review of the
   safety issues is provided. Based on the current data available, both
   insects and former foodstuffs have an excellent potential use as
   alternative feed ingredients for livestock production. When produced in
   line with the criteria set by major feed/food authorities, they are
   characterized by high quality and safety standards. This makes them
   comparable to other feed materials and ingredients currently available
   on the market, although their full nutritional, functional, safety and
   sustainability evaluation cannot be considered complete.},

Abstract = {Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an emerging zoonosis caused by a positive RNA
   single stranded virus of the Hepeviridae family. In developed countries,
   pigs and wild boars are the main reservoir for zoonotic genotypes 3 and
   4. In spring 2017, for the first time HEV was detected in wild boars
   captured in the Regional Park of the Euganean Hills, in north-eastern
   Italy. Phylogenetic analysis of two complete viral genomes and seven
   partial ORF1 and ORF2 sequences of HEV viruses, selected from twelve
   positive animals, showed that the viruses grouped together within
   genotype 3 but clustered separately from previously identified subtypes,
   thus suggesting the identification of a novel genotype 3 subtype. The
   phylogenetic analysis of nine partial ORF2 sequences showed the closest
   similarity with wild boar/human viruses identified in central-northern
   Italy in 2012. The circulation of HEVs in this area, characterized by a
   vast man-made environment, an overpopulation of wild boars and > 150
   swine farms, should be considered in a public health perspective.
   Further investigations at the wild/domestic species and human interface
   are therefore necessary to gain a deeper understanding of HEV dynamics.},

   enrichment; b) to consider the potential synergic effect between Se fern
   fertilization and AMF inoculation (+AMF and -AMF). The cvs. Atlas and
   `Italo' were also tested against `Grande' to measure their
   genotype-specific responses using a medium rate of Se application
   (Se-75).
   Neither fern injury nor changes in spear yield, quality (commercial and
   organoleptic) or essential/non-essential element contents were observed
   in Se-treated asparagus plants, whereas an increase in Ca2+ level was
   detected. Averaged over all the trials, Se content in Se-0 spears was
   close to 150 mu g kg(-1) DW. It always rose linearly with increasing Se
   rate, to a much greater extent when Se application was associated with
   the AMF inoculation, reaching with the highest Se rate values of 1893
   and 844 mu g kg(-1) DW with and without AMF inoculation, respectively.
   However, AMF inoculation was not effective in enhancing the uptake of Se
   from soil. Variability in Se spear fortification was observed between
   farms, probably depending on the crop management affecting the growth of
   the green biomass. The highest Se dose (Se-125) also resulted in an
   improved content of sucrose in spears and in crowns one year after the
   Se application. In all trials, total phenols (TP) and carotenoid
   content, as well as antioxidant capacity (AC) in spears linearly
   enhanced with the rising of Se dose. A significant correlation between
   TP and AC in spears of not AMF-inoculated crop was highlighted, while AC
   in +AMF spears seems to be affected by other antioxidant compounds
   besides TP. Among the cultivars tested, `Atlas' seems more prone than
   `Grande' and `Italo' to Se enrichment and, irrespectively to the Se
   treatment, it had the highest antioxidant capacity. The annual
   application of Se on asparagus fern is a promising technique for
   obtaining stable Se enrichment of the asparagus spears over both years
   and it can be usefully associated with AMF inoculation.},

Abstract = {Between November 2017 and February 2018, Ghanaian poultry producers
   reported to animal health authorities a dramatic increase in mortality
   rate and a relevant drop in egg production in several layer hen farms.
   Laboratory investigations revealed that the farms had been infected by
   the H9N2 influenza subtype. Virological and molecular characterization
   of the viruses identified in Ghana is described here for the first time.
   Whole genome analysis showed that the viruses belong to the G1-lineage
   and cluster with viruses identified in North and West Africa. The low
   pathogenicity of the virus was confirmed by the intravenous
   pathogenicity index assay. Further investigations revealed co-infection
   with infectious bronchitis virus of the GI-19 lineage, which very likely
   explained the severity of the disease observed during the outbreaks. The
   H9N2 outbreaks in Ghana highlight the importance of performing a
   differential diagnosis and an in-depth characterization of emerging
   viruses. In addition, the detection of a potentially zoonotic subtype,
   such as the H9N2, in a region where highly pathogenic avian influenza
   H5Nx is currently circulating highlights the urgency of implementing
   enhanced monitoring strategies and supporting improved investments in
   regional diagnostic technologies.},

Abstract = {The study was conducted to describe the dynamics of ST398
   methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) on a dairy herd in
   northeastern Italy. MRSA was first identified in this herd of 120 cows
   in 2016, after which the herd was sampled once every 3 months for 1 year
   (April 2016-May 2017). Samples collected included nasal swabs and milk
   samples from cows and nasal swabs from farmworkers. In addition, pen
   fencing and teat milk liners were swabbed and air samples from cow pens
   and the milking parlor were collected. All samples were tested for MRSA
   using a selective medium; positive isolates were confirmed by mecA PCR.
   A representative set of MRSA isolates was genotyped using spa typing and
   multilocus sequence typing. Overall, 34 (mean 23\%, range 16-30\%)
   milking cows were found harboring MRSA in the mammary gland and only 6
   recovered from infection or colonization. The mean incidence rate was
   14\% (range 8-20\%), mean cure rate was 23\% (range 13-43\%), and
   estimated basic reproduction number (R-0) was 1.08. The average of
   positive quarters found was 35.1\% and most of the positive quarters
   (82.4\%) developed subclinical mastitis. The mean duration of MRSA
   colonization in quarters during the study was 247 days, but quarters
   affected by subclinical mastitis harbored MRSA for a longer time than
   healthy ones (285 days vs. 131 days). After the second sampling, the
   farmer segregated MRSA-positive cows from the uninfected cows and milked
   them last. Despite segregation, 25 newly infected or colonized cows were
   detected. MRSA isolates from cows, environment, and two farmworkers
   belonged to the same sequence type (ST398) and spa type (t034). This
   study highlights the ability of ST398 MRSA to cause a persistent
   infection of the mammary gland and to survive in the farm environment.},

Abstract = {This is the first description of a betanodavirus infection in the dusky
   grouper Epinephelus marginatus within the marine protected areas (MPAs)
   of the Balearic Islands. Histopathology techniques were employed to
   describe neurological lesions in infected fish. Abnormal swimming,
   mortality, and neurological lesions were detected in all analysed
   grouper individuals. Virus particles were observed by means of
   transmission electron microscopy. Reverse transcription of RNA1 and RNA2
   followed by cDNA amplification and sequencing allowed viral
   classification. Phylogenetic analysis showed the isolates from wild E.
   marginatus of the Balearic Islands MPAs to be closely related to
   Dicentrarchus labrax and Mullus barbatus strains from Cyprus and Italy.
   Although vertical transmission from infected spawners has been described
   as the major route for nodavirus infection, we point out in this work
   that horizontal transmission among sub-clinical fishes after migration
   or commercial import for aquaculture production could play a major role
   in the spreading of the disease in MPAs.},

Title = {Benefits of dietary supplements on the physical fitness of German
   Shepherd dogs during a drug detection training course},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {A high standard of physical fitness is an essential characteristic of
   drug detection dogs because it affects not only their ability to sustain
   high activity levels but also their attention and olfaction efficiency.
   Nutritional supplements could improve physical fitness by modulating
   energy metabolism, oxidative processes, and perceived fatigue. The aim
   of this study was to investigate the physiological and biochemical
   changes induced by submaximal exercise on drug detection dogs (German
   Shepherd breed) and to assess whether a dietary supplement improves
   their physical fitness. During a drug detection dog training course,
   seven dogs were fed with a basal diet (Control Group) for three-month
   period, while a further seven dogs were fed with a basal diet as well as
   a daily nutritional supplement containing branched-chain and limiting
   amino acids, carnitine, vitamins, and octacosanol (Treatment Group). At
   the end of this period, individual physical fitness was assessed by
   making each subject take a graded treadmill exercise test. A human heart
   rate monitor system was used to record the dog's heart rate (HR) during
   the treadmill exercise and the subsequent recovery period. The
   parameters related to HR were analysed using nonparametric statistics.
   Blood samples were collected before starting the nutritional supplement
   treatment, before and after the treadmill exercise and following
   recovery. Linear mixed models were used. The dietary supplements
   accelerated HR recovery, as demonstrated by the lower HR after recovery
   (P<0.05) and Time constants of HR decay (P<0.05), and by the higher
   Absolute HR Recovered (P<0.05) recorded in the Treatment group compared
   with the Control dogs. The supplemented dogs showed the lowest
   concentrations of creatine kinase (CK; P<0.001), aspartate
   aminotransferase (AST, P<0.05) and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA;
   P<0.01) suggesting a reduction in muscle damage and improvement of
   energy metabolism. These data suggest that this combined supplement can
   significantly enhance the physical fitness of drug detection dogs.},

Abstract = {On 31 August, a veterinarian and a farmworker were hospitalised for skin
   lesions. Both had been exposed to a dead cow on 19 August on a farm near
   Rome, where eight further cattle died of confirmed anthrax later the
   same month. At admission, the first case showed a black depressed eschar
   and another smaller lesion on one hand. The second case presented deep
   infection of the skin, with involvement of both arms. Anthrax diagnosis
   was confirmed by detection of B. anthracis DNA in eschar fragments from
   both patients. T-cell specific immunity was studied by flow cytometry
   and Elispot assay after stimulation with B. anthracis secretome in blood
   samples collected from Case 1. Immunoglobulin production was detected by
   complement fixation assay. In Case 1, specific CD4(+) T-cell activation
   was detected, without antibody production. Specific antibodies were
   detected only in the second patient with severe cutaneous illness. Both
   patients recovered. The two human anthrax cases were epidemiologically
   linked, but anthrax was not suspected at admission in either case. The
   veterinarian had initially unrecognised professional exposure and the
   exposed farmworker did initially not report exposure to affected
   animals. A One Health strategy integrating human and animal
   investigations was essential to confirm the diagnosis.},

Title = {Control of paratuberculosis: who, why and how. A review of 48 countries},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JUN 13},
Abstract = {Paratuberculosis, a chronic disease affecting ruminant livestock, is
   caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). It has
   direct and indirect economic costs, impacts animal welfare and arouses
   public health concerns. In a survey of 48 countries we found
   paratuberculosis to be very common in livestock. In about half the
   countries more than 20\% of herds and flocks were infected with MAP.
   Most countries had large ruminant populations (millions), several types
   of farmed ruminants, multiple husbandry systems and tens of thousands of
   individual farms, creating challenges for disease control. In addition,
   numerous species of free-living wildlife were infected. Paratuberculosis
   was notifiable in most countries, but formal control programs were
   present in only 22 countries. Generally, these were the more highly
   developed countries with advanced veterinary services. Of the countries
   without a formal control program for paratuberculosis, 76\% were in
   South and Central America, Asia and Africa while 20\% were in Europe.
   Control programs were justified most commonly on animal health grounds,
   but protecting market access and public health were other factors.
   Prevalence reduction was the major objective in most countries, but
   Norway and Sweden aimed to eradicate the disease, so surveillance and
   response were their major objectives. Government funding was involved in
   about two thirds of countries, but operations tended to be funded by
   farmers and their organizations and not by government alone. The
   majority of countries (60\%) had voluntary control programs. Generally,
   programs were supported by incentives for joining, financial
   compensation and/or penalties for non-participation. Performance
   indicators, structure, leadership, practices and tools used in control
   programs are also presented. Securing funding for long-term control
   activities was a widespread problem. Control programs were reported to
   be successful in 16 (73\%) of the 22 countries. Recommendations are made
   for future control programs, including a primary goal of establishing an
   international code for paratuberculosis, leading to universal
   acknowledgment of the principles and methods of control in relation to
   endemic and transboundary disease. An holistic approach across all
   ruminant livestock industries and long-term commitment is required for
   control of paratuberculosis.},

Abstract = {Acrylamide (AA) is a food process contaminant with carcinogenic and
   genotoxic properties that is formed in thermally treated foods,
   especially carbohydrate-rich. Dietary exposure to AA, due to school
   canteen foods, was estimated in schoolchildren aged 3-13 years by
   combining the AA concentration in foods with the amount and frequency of
   food consumption. Potato products and bakery products presented the
   highest mean levels of AA (841 and 244 mu g/kg, respectively) followed
   by meat (222 mu g/kg) and egg products (151 mu g/kg). The mean total AA
   intake was estimated at 2.16 mu g/kg bw/d, with the highest percentages
   provided by potato products (34.5\%), meat products (26.1\%) and bread
   (24.5\%). The calculated margins of exposure (MOEs) for the average AA
   exposure (84 and 212 for the benchmark dose lower confidence limits
   (BMDL) of 0.17 and 0.43 mg/kg bw/d) suggest that there is a health
   concern with respect to students eating in school canteens.},

Title = {Acorn-related acquired pseudomelanosis in Calabrian black pigs},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JUN 4},
Abstract = {BackgroundMelanosis of lymph nodes in black pigs has generally been
   related to regression of congenital melanoma and, occasionally, to
   ingestion of acorns. The aim of this manuscript is to confirm the
   hypothesis of a possible acquired acorn-related pseudomelanosis in the
   Nero Calabrese pig, a swine breed belonging to the group of Italian
   native breeds and whose coverage area corresponds to the region of
   Calabria, southern Italy. This pig is characterized by slow-growing
   subjects, producing, however, high quality meat suitable for the
   production of sausages and fine hams. The study was carried out on 142
   normally slaughtered pigs. All organs were examined. Lymph nodes and
   intestine (jejunum) were sampled. Histochemistry was performed on
   deparaffinized histological sections to identify the cell types involved
   and to characterize the pigment stored. To further confirm the
   pigmentation disorder, immunohistochemistry was carried out. Total
   phenolic substances were identified in acorns through the use of a
   biochemical reaction.ResultsLymph node pigmentation appears directly
   related to acorn ingestion, with a higher incidence in the group which
   was 70\% natural fed (acorn of Quercus virgiliana). Moreover, findings
   obtained revealed how different amounts of phenolic substrates present
   in Q. virgiliana and Q. ilex acorns can influence the incidence of such
   exogenous pigmentation.ConclusionThe findings obtained in this study
   confirm the acquired nature of the melanin-like pigmentation detected in
   lymph nodes from acorn-fed swine. Acquired pigmentation must be
   differentiated from true melanosis as well as from melanosis related to
   tumor regression of congenital melanoma. This thesaurismosis can be
   proposed as a marker of wellbeing and quality, confirming that the pigs
   have been bred and fed in natural conditions.},

Title = {Socio-economic factors as indicators for various animal diseases in
   Sardinia},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 3},
Abstract = {The need to consider the role of social factors in the efficacy of farm
   management and, consequently, in the onset and persistence of diseases
   typical to animal farms is increasingly being realized increasingly
   worldwide. Many risk analysis studies have been conducted to assess the
   role of various factors in the development of animal diseases; however,
   very few have accounted for the role of social factors. The aim of this
   work was to bridge this gap, with the main hypothesis that different
   socio-economic factors could be valid indicators for the occurrence of
   different animal diseases. A socio-economic analysis was performed using
   demographic characteristics of the farmers and data from 44 social
   indicators released by the Italian Statistician National Institute of
   Statistics (ISTAT) database. African swine fever (ASF) in wild boars
   (WB) and domestic pigs and other endemic animal diseases and zoonoses in
   Sardinia were considered, such as cistic echinococcosis (CE), contagious
   agalactia (CA), trichinellosis, West Nile disease (WND), and bluetongue
   (BT). Seven different negative binomial regression models were fitted
   using the number of cases between 2011-2017. Three indicators-cultural
   demand, employment rate, and legality-showed a statistically significant
   association with risk for all the diseases considered, but with varying
   effects. Some indicators, such as the age and sex of the farmer,
   material deprivation index, number of farms and animals,
   micro-criminality index, and rate of reported thefts were common to ASF,
   CA, trichinellosis, and CE cases. Others such as the forest surface and
   the energy produced from renewable sources were common to BT, WND, and
   ASF in WB. Tourism in seasons other than summer was a valid predictor of
   ASF and trichinellosis, while out-of-region hospital use had a
   statistically significant role in CE risk identification. These results
   may help understand the social context in which these diseases may occur
   and thus guide the design and implementation of additional risk
   management measures that go beyond well-known veterinary measures.},

Abstract = {The presence of the insecticide Fipronil and its main products of
   toxicological relevance, namely Sulfone and Desulfinyl, was assessed in
   161 residential house dust samples in the absence (N=101) and presence
   (N=60) of cats and dogs in Italy. High-resolution mass spectrometry
   analysis revealed a significant difference (p<0.001) in the dust
   contamination in the presence of pets (median: 467 vs. 24ng/g dry
   weight), even if the highest value was found in the absence of pets
   (82,069 vs. 67,799ng/g dry weight). Fipronil intake estimates from dust
   in toddlers, computed according to US-EPA and EU-ECHA guidelines, ranged
   from 333 to 556 and from 20 to 34ng/kg per day for acute and chronic
   scenario, respectively. Dust seemed not able itself to lead to Fipronil
   overexposure with respect to acute and chronic toxicity health-based
   guidance values. Kittens were potentially overexposed to Fipronil under
   both acute (26,076ng/kg per day) and chronic (1,633ng/kg per day)
   scenarios. The mild symptomatology associated with acute intoxication
   could possibly determine case underreporting within pharmacosurveillance
   schemes. Its administration was estimated in 7.3-9.7 tons per year. Such
   a range suggests its prudent use under strict veterinary control to
   prevent pest resistance and ecotoxicological outcomes.},

Abstract = {Clostridium difficile is a major cause of infectious diarrhea associated
   to healthcare settings. Community-acquired infections are increasingly
   reported in the last decade and exposure other than to symptomatic
   patients rather to contaminated foods or animals is feasible. Occurrence
   of C. difficile in shellfish raises concern because spores can survive
   the cooking temperatures given that shellfish is often consumed poorly
   cooked or raw. Aim of our study was to investigate whether shellfish
   represents a reservoir of C. difficile human PCR-ribotypes (RTs). 702
   shellfish samples of farmed and wild bivalve mollusc species were
   collected over the 2015-2017 period in North Adriatic Italian Sea to
   investigate contamination with C. difficile and characterize the
   isolates in terms of genotypic variability and antimicrobial resistance
   profile. C. difficile was detected in 16.9\% (CI: 14.1\%-19.8\%)
   samples: 11.6\% mussels and 23.2\% clams. Compared to mussels, clams
   were significantly associated with detection of C. difficile (OR = 2.4,
   P < 0.01). Overall 113 C. difficile isolates were genotyped and 75
   (66.4\%) were toxigenic. Fifty-three different RTs were identified.
   40.7\% C. difficile isolates were among the RTs most commonly involved
   in human infection in Europe. The profile of antimicrobial
   susceptibility was determined by E-test; microbiological resistance was
   frequent against clindamycin (17\%), erythromycin (23\%), rifampicin
   (8.8\%) and moxifloxacin (10.6\%). All isolates were susceptible to
   metronidazole and one showed MIC > ECOFF for vancomycin. C. difficile
   strains showed high variety in RTs, most of them already detected in
   other animals or known as highly virulent and epidemic in humans. These
   results prompt towards investigating on specific risk mitigation
   measures against C. difficile and are preliminary for any source
   attribution and risk assessment study.},

Abstract = {A study was conducted to determine the prevalence, serotypes,
   antimicrobial resistance and plasmids profiles of Salmonella spp. in
   Nile perch (Lates niloticus) from Lake Victoria, Tanzania. Presence of
   Salmonella spp. and quantification of Escherichia coli in water and fish
   were investigated using standard bacteriological methods. Antimicrobial
   resistance was determined using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
   method. A total of 352 samples were analysed including Nile perch, lake
   water and swabs from surfaces of facilities used for fish
   transportation. A total of 10 different Salmonella serovars were
   isolated. Salmonella enterica subsp. salamae with antigenic formula
   42:r:- had a prevalence of 10.0\% (n = 60) in Nile perch from fishing
   grounds which were significant different (P < 0.05) to the prevalence of
   this serovar at landing sites and domestic markets 1.7\% (n = 60 each).
   The prevalence of Salmonella Waycross (41:z4, z23:-) in Nile perch from
   fishing grounds was 18.3\% (n = 60) with no significant difference (P >
   0.05) compared to the ones at landing sites 10\% (n = 60) and markets
   13.3\% (n = 60). The prevalence of S. enterica subsp. salamae 42:r:- in
   water from fishing grounds was 6.7\% (n = 60). Two out of 12 S. enterica
   subsp. salamae 42:r:- were resistant to sulfamethoxazole, while one was
   resistance to azithromycin. S. Waycross were resistant to
   sulfamethoxazole (6/30), azithromycin (6/30) and ampicillin (4/30).
   Seven S. Waycross carried plasmids, but none of S. enterica subsp.
   salamae 42:r:- carried plasmids. E. coli mean counts were 2.51 log cfu/g
   in fish intestines, 2.38 log cfu/g in gills, and 2.02 log cfu/ml in
   water. The frequent findings of S. enterica subsp. salamae 42:r:- and S.
   Waycross in Nile perch are surprising as these serovars are rarely
   associated with human diseases. Follow-up studies of their ecology in
   Nile perch and Lake Victoria are needed.},

   neutralization test. The seroprevalence levels detected, as well as the
   absence of reports of clinical cases in the hunting dog groups tested,
   indicate limited contact of this species with ADV in the study area.
   Further studies are warranted to assess the pathogenicity of Aujeszky's
   disease virus strains infecting wild boar.},

Abstract = {Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a contagious viral pathogen that usually
   causes a mild, self-limiting respiratory disease. More recently, highly
   virulent FCV strains have emerged and have been associated with severe
   systemic infection, referred to as virulent systemic disease (VSD).
   The objective of this study is to report VSD cases in Italian cats along
   with the molecular characterization of two detected FCV strains. Three
   client-owned cats showed clinical signs resembling to those described
   for VSD cases. The cats were subjected to molecular investigations for
   detection of FCV and other feline pathogens. Histopathology and
   immunohistochemistry were performed on internal organs of one cat;
   molecular characterization of two detected FCV strains was obtained
   through sequence and phylogenetic analyses.
   Putative VS-FCV strains were detected in all three cats, which were
   co-infected with feline panleukopenia virus. The cat submitted to
   histopathology and immunohistochemistry displayed severe histological
   changes and FCV antigens in internal organs. Two Italian FCV strains,
   for which amplification of ORF2 was successful, were strictly related
   and formed a unique phylogenetic cluster. These viruses did not show
   consistent changes in the amino acid sequences with respect to reference
   VS-FCVs.
   The results of our study confirm that VS-FCV strains are circulating in
   Italy and that VSD diagnosis is complicated since both genetic and
   clinical markers have not been identified so far.},

Abstract = {Coxiella burnetii causes diseases in humans (Q fever) and animals,
   domestic ruminants playing a major role in the epidemiology of the
   infection. Information on C. burnetii infection in Lebanon is scanty. In
   order to assess the prevalence of C. burnetii infection in ruminants, a
   cross-sectional study was undertaken in 2014. A total of 1633 sera from
   ruminants (865 cattle, 384 sheep and 384 goats) from 429 farms (173
   cattle, 128 sheep and 128 goats), in seven provinces of Lebanon were
   randomly selected and assayed for the presence of antibodies.
   39.86\% of farms (95\% CI: 35.23-44.56) resulted positive. The
   seroprevalence was 30.63\% in Cattle-farms, 46.88\% in sheep-farms and
   45.31\% in goat-farms.
   Milk samples collected from 282 seropositive animals (86 cows, 93 sheep
   and 103 goats) from 171 positive farms were tested by a high sensitive
   Real-Time PCR targeted to the IS1111 transposon of C. burnetii. The
   overall prevalence in farms was estimated to be 14.04\%. Cattle-, sheep-
   and goat farm prevalence rates were 15.09\%, 10\% and 17.24\%,
   respectively.
   The findings of the study show that C. burnetii prevalence in Lebanese
   domestic ruminants is related to animal species and farming practices.
   Indeed, the mixed herds with sheep (p < 0.01), the presence of common
   lambing/kidding areas (p < 0.001) in farms where the use of
   disinfectants was not a routine practice (p < 0.05) were identified as
   important risk factors.
   The results of the study provide baseline information for setting up
   herd management and public health measures for the prevention and
   control of Q fever in Lebanon.},

Abstract = {Swimmer's itch is caused by the penetration of free-swimming larvae of
   trematodes of the family Schistosomatidae in human skin. It is usually
   reported in people engaged in recreational water activities in
   freshwater bodies and in most of cases, it is provoked by bird
   schistosomes of the genus Trichobilharzia. In the summer 2017, many
   cases of dermatitis were recorded in people bathing in the waters of the
   Albano Lake (Rome, Italy) and a parasitological investigation was
   carried out in order to ascertain the causative agent of these cases.
   Snails of the family Lymnaeidae, natural intermediate hosts of bird
   schistosomes, were collected from lake shallow waters to detect the
   presence of trematodes of the genus Trichobilharzia. Pools of maximum 10
   snails were placed in Petri dishes, and cercarial emergence was
   stimulated exposing snails to strong artificial light intensity at 25
   degrees C. Three hundred and thirty-seven snails were collected and
   screened for the shedding of cercariae. Furcocercariae of the family
   Schistosomatidae, with a morphology overlapping that of the genus
   Trichobilharzia, were detected in seven Petri dishes. Assuming that in
   each positive Petri dish just one snail was shedding furcocercariae, the
   minimum infectious rate was 2.1\%. Molecular analysis of furcocercariae
   allowed ascribing them to the species Trichobilharzia franki. Snails of
   the species Radix auricularia were identified as intermediate hosts of
   the parasite. This is the second record of T. franki causing cercarial
   dermatitis in Central Italy, the third in Italy. The 2017 was in Italy
   exceptionally warm and dry. Trematodes are sensitive to changes in
   temperature, being cercarial production and emission rates temperature
   dependent. Small increases in water temperature would speed up parasite
   development and transmission, leading to a manifold increase in
   cercarial emergence. Moreover, high temperatures raise chances to
   acquire the infection, due to increased time spent in water by people.},

Abstract = {Adenoviruses are important pathogens of humans and animals. Bats have
   been recognized as potential reservoirs of novel viruses, with some
   viruses being regarded as a possible zoonotic threat to humans. In this
   study, we report the detection and analysis of adenoviruses from
   different bat species in northern Italy. Upon sequence and phylogenetic
   analysis, based on a short diagnostic fragment of the highly-conserved
   DNA polymerase gene, we identified potential novel candidate adenovirus
   species, including an avian-like adenovirus strain. An adenovirus
   isolate was obtained in simian cell lines from the carcass of a
   Pipistrellus kuhlii, and the complete genome sequence was reconstructed
   using deep sequencing technologies. The virus displayed high nucleotide
   identity and virtually the same genome organization as the Pipistrellus
   pipistrellus strain PPV1, isolated in Germany in 2007. Gathering data on
   epidemiology and the genetic diversity of bat adenoviruses may be
   helpful to better understand their evolution in the mammalian and avian
   hosts.},

Abstract = {In the last years, the increase of anthropogenic activities has led to a
   progressive pollution of ecosystems. Oniscidean isopods are a group of
   terrestrial animals known as excellent bio-indicators and
   bio-accumulators, because of their capacity to accumulate contaminants
   and to implement appropriate strategies of detoxification. For this
   study, we collected Porcellionides pruinosus from two different sites in
   the Corinth region (Greece), a polluted site and a control site, to
   assess the heavy metal pollution status. We conducted an inductively
   coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis for the detection of
   trace elements in animals' hepatopancreas and soil; we performed also
   immunohistochemistry for detection of metallothioneins 1 (MT1) and heat
   shock protein 70 (HSP70s). The results suggest a great capacity of the
   species in trace elements bioaccumulation and the high degree of
   pollution of the area near Agioi Theodoroi where the metal pollution
   index (MPI) is threefolds higher than the control site, due to the
   presence of significantly higher concentration of arsenic, cadmium,
   cobalt, chromium, manganese, molybdenum, and lead found in
   hepatopancreas and soil. The environmental stress is confirmed by the
   expression of the relative biomarkers of exposure MT1 and HSP70. Our
   study, with a multimarker approach, consents getting a complete analysis
   of environmental quality and the effect of pollution on organisms and
   shows for the first time the heavy metals contamination status in
   certain Greece area. Furthermore, P. pruinosus proved to be an
   appropriate indicator of pollution in terrestrial ecosystems.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Interest in bat-related viruses has increased considerably during the
   last decade, leading to the discovery of a rising number of new viruses
   in several bat species. Poxviridae are a large, diverse family of DNA
   viruses that can infect a wide range of vertebrates and invertebrates.
   To date, only a few documented detections of poxviruses have been
   described in bat populations on three different continents (America,
   Africa, and Australia). These viruses are phylogenetically dissimilar
   and have diverse clinical impacts on their hosts. Herein, we report the
   isolation, nearly complete genome sequencing, and annotation of a novel
   poxvirus detected from an insectivorous bat (Hypsugo savii) in Northern
   Italy. The virus is tentatively named Hypsugopoxvirus (HYPV) after the
   bat species from which it was isolated. The nearly complete genome size
   is 166,600 nt and it encodes 161 genes. Genome analyses suggest that
   HYPV belongs to the Chordopoxvirinae subfamily, with the highest
   nucleotide identity (85\%) to Eptesipoxvirus (EPTV) detected from a
   microbat Eptesicus fuscus in WA, USA, in 2011. To date, HYPV represents
   the first poxvirus detected in bats in Europe; thus, its viral ecology
   and disease associations should be investigated further.},

Title = {Diagnostic value of composite milk sample vs single quarter milk sample
   for the detection of Staphylococcus aureus intra-mammary infections in
   cattle},
Journal = {PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE},

Abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is one of the most important causes of
   mastitis in dairy cattle. Control and eradication programs of S. aureus
   intra-mammary infections (IMI) are based on different factors included
   the correct detection and management of the infected cows. The present
   study aimed at evaluating the efficacy of composite milk samples (CMS)
   analysis, compared to quarter milk samples (QMS) analysis, for the
   bacteriological detection of S. aureus intra-mammary infections. During
   2016, 661 CMS (hygienically collected) and 2644 QMS (aseptically
   collected) were obtained from 661 cows in 5 herds, All the samples were
   submitted to S. aureus bacteriological culture and somatic cell count
   (SCC) analysis.
   QMS bacteriological analysis on blood agar plates was able to detect 236
   cows excreting S. aureus, while the bacteriological analysis of CMS,
   using selective agar, identified 229 positive cows. The concordance was
   95\% with an excellent Cohen's kappa (0.89). Relative sensitivity and
   specificity of CMS vs QMS, considered as the reference test, were 91.5\%
   +/- 2.1 and 96.9\% +/- 1.3 (CI 95\%), respectively. In addition, the
   relative sensitivity of CMS improved as the number of infected quarters
   per cow and the number of colony forming units (cfu) per sample
   increased.
   The predictive value of CMS results was better when paired with SCC
   data, in particular CMS showed better negative predictive value when SCC
   was < 200,000 cells/mL and better positive predictive value when SCC was
   > 200,000 cells/mL. The probability for a cow to be S. aureus positive
   was 56.4\% in case of SCC > 200,000 cells/mL, while it was 18.6\% in
   case of SCC < 200,000 cells/mL. The average SCC in CMS was significantly
   higher in positive cows and the value rose as the number of infected
   quarters per cow increased.
   Given the intermittent excretion of S. aureus in milk from dairy cows,
   it could be more advantageous to carry out several serial CMS, rather
   than few QMS, being CMS an easier to collect and less expensive milk
   sampling method. Thus, bacteriological examination of CMS, combined with
   SCC data of the same sample, could be extremely useful for the success
   of S. aureus IMI control plans, because repeated CMS are easier to be
   performed and could be more easily proposed to the farmers.},

Abstract = {Swine brucellosis due to Brucella suis biovar 2 (bv2) is enzootic in
   wild boar and hare in continental Europe and may cause major economic
   losses to the pig industry, mainly in free-ranged pig farms. The high
   nucleotide identity found among the B. suis biovar 2 isolates has long
   hindered the full understanding of the epidemiology and the
   phylogeography of the disease. Here, we used multilocus variable-number
   tandem-repeat (VNTR analysis (MLVA) and whole-genome analysis to
   identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in order to gait
   insights from the largest B. suis bv2 dataset analyzed so far composed
   of domestic pigs and wildlife isolate collected throughout Europe since
   the 1970s. We found four major clades with a specific phylogeographic
   pattern. The Iberian Glade contains isolates exclusively from the
   Iberian Peninsula. The Central European clad includes most isolates from
   France, Northern Italy, Switzerland and an important proportion of those
   of Northern Spain. The Eastern European Glade clustered isolates from
   Croatia and Hungary mainly but also from areas of France, Germany, Italy
   and Poland. Finally, a separated Sardinian Glade grouped three isolates
   from this island At fine scale, MLVA demonstrated an endemic status of
   the infection in Europe and it allowed tracking a large outbreak formed
   by different farms from Spain linked to the same infection source. The
   whole genome SNPs analysis showed that the strains form genetically
   distinct clades, shared between wild boar and pigs, in agreement with
   the MLVA clades. Interestingly, all hare isolates clustered together
   within two groups compose exclusively of wildlife isolates. Our results
   support the hypothesis that maintenance and spread of B. suis bv2 in
   Europe is a dynamic process linked to the natural expansion of wild boar
   as the main wild reservoir of the infection, while spread over long
   distances is found largely dependent on anthropogenic activities.},

Abstract = {Sow mortality represents a relevant issue in the modern pig industry and
   can negatively impact the profitability of farming. Sow mortality rate
   should range between 3-6\% on a yearly basis, but higher rates are quite
   commonly reported. Disease conditions of the locomotor, digestive,
   reproductive and urinary systems are most frequently observed in
   dead/euthanized sows. On the other hand, respiratory diseases are rare
   in this category of animals, the most severe episodes resulting from the
   introduction of a ``new{''} infectious agent into the breeding stock,
   thus in absence of an adequate level of herd immunity. We describe
   herein the main clinical, pathological and microbiological findings
   observed during a severe outbreak of respiratory disease, which occurred
   in a breeding pig herd in Central Italy. The respiratory syndrome
   affected a very high percentage of pregnant and lactating sows (around
   30\%), both primiparous and multiparous. Within two weeks, the mortality
   rate reached 15\%. At necropsy, serous-fibrinous pleuritis, along with
   large foci of acute bronchopneumonia, affecting the cranio-ventral parts
   of both lungs, represented the most relevant pathological findings in
   animals under study. In depth bacteriological investigations identified
   a capsular type D and hgbB-positive Pasteurella multocida strain as the
   sole causative agent. Pneumonic pasteurellosis usually affects
   grower/finishing pigs and represents the final stage of the so-called
   porcine respiratory disease complex. As a matter of fact, Pasteurella
   multocida rarely acts as the primary cause of porcine pneumonia, rather
   being considered an opportunist which complicates primary infections
   caused by other bacteria and/or viruses. The co-factors which likely
   contributed to determine such a severe respiratory syndrome in sows are
   largely unknown. Speculatively, we hypothesize that resulted from the
   introduction of a ``new{''} strain of P. multocida, which infected
   immunologically naive sows. The poor level of biosecurity adopted, as
   well as the kinetics of this outbreak, argue in favour of such a
   scenario.},

Title = {Dehydrated Alfalfa and Fresh Grass Supply in Young Rabbits: Effect on
   Performance and Caecal Microbiota Biodiversity},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Simple Summary The weaning of young rabbits is a critical period that is
   often accompanied by digestive troubles. Innovations in feeding strategy
   are urgently needed to preserve rabbit health and to reduce the use of
   antibiotics. We show here that providing dehydrated alfalfa during
   weaning is a promising solution to manage health status by favoring the
   establishment of a proper digestive microbiota.
   Abstract The improvement of rabbit gut microbiota by modifying
   nutritional components of the feed or favoring its early intake of feed
   has been previously investigated. The early administration of dehydrated
   alfalfa (A) or fresh grass (G) for rabbits, during the peri-weaning
   period (30 and 45 days of age), and their effect on performance and
   caecal microbiota compared to a standard diet (C) were evaluated. Until
   15 days of age, nine litters/group were housed in the maternal cage and
   milked once per day. From 15 to 30 days, the young rabbits could consume
   both milk and solid feed (pelleted for C or supplemental feed for A and
   G). At 30 days of age, the rabbits were weaned and, until 45 days, were
   kept in single cages following the same dietary protocol. No significant
   changes were found in the milk intake or the individual weight of young
   rabbits at 30 and 45 days. The caecal Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes
   (bacterial phyla ratio) increased with age (from 2.43 to 6.05 on
   average, at 30 and 45 days). The Ruminococcaceae/Lachinospiraceae
   (bacterial family ratio) was highest in the A group at both ages,
   followed by G then C. The early administration of dehydrated alfalfa is
   a promising solution to improve health status by favoring an appropriate
   digestive microbiota.},

Abstract = {Crenosoma vulpis, the fox lungworm, is a nematode parasite of wild and

   survey of infection was carried out examining 88 red foxes (Vulpes
   vulpes) obtained during the regular hunting season (2014-2015) from the
   Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. Carcasses were stored frozen (-21
   degrees C) prior to necropsy. Lungs were examined for the presence of
   adult worms by dissection of the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles, and
   then the lung tissue was examined for first-stage larvae (L1) by the
   Baermann method. No adult stages were detected, but L1, identified based
   on morphology as Crenosoma vulpis, were recovered from 28.4\% (25/88) of
   the fox lungs. No significant differences in infection were found based
   on sex or geographical distribution. A brief review on C. vulpis report
   in red foxes in Italy and other European countries was also carried out.},

Abstract = {Usnic acid (UA) is a lichenic secondary metabolite useful for the
   treatment of burn wounds thanks to its antimicrobial activity,
   particularly toward strains responsible for their infections. However,
   the poor solubility is the main factor limiting the activity and thus
   its use in health care products.
   Adhesive polymeric films were designed to improve UA use by enhancing
   its bioavailability in the wounded tissues. Three different NaCMC
   hydrogel films, NaCMC 2\% alone (F1), mixed to PVP K90 0.1\% (F2) or to
   Carbopol 971 P 0.1\% (F3), were prepared by casting method.
   Ex vivo experiments performed on pig skin samples showed their suitable
   adhesion capacity. in vitro release test, performed using the extraction
   cell, showed that film F2 provides the highest UA concentrations.
   Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray analyses performed on the
   three films highlighted that UA is present in a more soluble form in F2.
   The in vitro antibacterial activity studies demonstrated that F2 is the
   most effective film against UA sensitive bacteria S. Epidermidis, E.
   Faecalis, B. Cereus and S. Pyogenes. In vitro cytotoxicity assays on
   human keratinocytes and fibroblasts showed that cells viability is not
   compromised.},

Abstract = {A high-precision exact-matching quadruple isotope dilution method
   (ID4MS) was employed for the quantitation of nitrate in an air-dried
   spinach powder Certified Reference Material (CRM). The analyte was
   extracted in hot water following addition of 15NO -3 internal standard.
   The blend was then treated with sulfamic acid to remove nitrite and with
   triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate to promote aqueous conversion of
   nitrate into volatile EtONO2. The derivative was analyzed by headspace
   GC-MS with 3-min elution time. The method performance was validated with
   a series of tests which demonstrated adequate selectivity and
   ruggedness. This method supported the development of novel SPIN-1 CRM
   giving a modest contribution to its uncertainty (uchar = 0.85\%). With
   respect to previous attempts, the SPIN-1 was proven stable, homogeneous
   (uhom = 0.44\%), and suitable for spinach monitoring under EU
   regulations. On dried basis, the nitrate content of SPIN-1 was found to
   be 22.53 +/- 0.43 mg/ g (Uc = 1.9\%, k = 2). The material was also used
   in an inter-laboratory study where four laboratories employed a total of
   ten measurement methods.},

Title = {Genomic Profiling of KRAS/NRAS/BRAF/PIK3CA Wild-Type Metastatic
   Colorectal Cancer Patients Reveals Novel Mutations in Genes Potentially

Abstract = {Previous findings suggest that metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC)
   patients with KRAS/NRAS/BRAF/PIK3CA wild-type (quadruple-wt) tumors are
   highly sensitive to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
   monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). However, additional molecular alterations
   might be involved in the de novo resistance to these drugs. We performed
   a comprehensive molecular profiling of 21 quadruple-wt tumors from mCRC
   patients enrolled in the ``Cetuximab After Progression in KRAS wild-type
   colorectal cancer patients{''} (CAPRI-GOIM) trial of first line FOLFIRI
   plus cetuximab. Tumor samples were analyzed with a targeted sequencing
   panel covering single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions/deletions
   (Indels), copy number variations (CNVs), and gene fusions in 143
   cancer-related genes. The analysis revealed in all 21 patients the
   presence of at least one SNV/Indel and in 10/21 cases (48\%) the
   presence of at least one CNV. Furthermore, 17/21 (81\%) patients had
   co-existing SNVs/Indels in different genes. Quadruple-wt mCRC from
   patients with the shorter progression free survival (PFS) were enriched
   with peculiar genetic alterations in KRAS, FBXW7, MAP2K1, and NF1 genes
   as compared with patients with longer PFS. These data suggest that a
   wide genetic profiling of quadruple-wt mCRC patients might help to
   identify novel markers of de novo resistance to anti-EGFR MoAbs.},

Abstract = {This short article presents loss rates of honey bee colonies over winter
   2017/18 from 36 countries, including 33 in Europe, from data collected
   using the standardized COLOSS questionnaire. The 25,363 beekeepers
   supplying data passing consistency checks in total wintered 544,879
   colonies, and reported 26,379 (4.8\%, 95\% CI 4.7-5.0\%) colonies with
   unsolvable queen problems, 54,525 (10.0\%, 95\% CI 9.8-10.2\%) dead
   colonies after winter and another 8,220 colonies (1.5\%, 95\% CI
   1.4-1.6\%) lost through natural disaster. This gave an overall loss rate
   of 16.4\% (95\% CI 16.1-16.6\%) of honey bee colonies during winter
   2017/18, but this varied greatly from 2.0 to 32.8\% between countries.
   The included map shows relative risks of winter loss at regional level.
   The analysis using the total data-set confirmed findings from earlier
   surveys that smaller beekeeping operations with at most 50 colonies
   suffer significantly higher losses than larger operations (p < .001).
   Beekeepers migrating their colonies had significantly lower losses than
   those not migrating (p < .001), a different finding from previous
   research. Evaluation of six different forage sources as potential risk
   factors for colony loss indicated that intensive foraging on any of five
   of these plant sources (Orchards, Oilseed Rape, Maize, Heather and
   Autumn Forage Crops) was associated with significantly higher winter
   losses. This finding requires further study and explanation. A table is
   included giving detailed results of loss rates and the impact of the
   tested forage sources for each country and overall.},

Title = {Systemic tuberculosis by MYCOBACTERIUM BOVIS in a free-ranging MARSICAN
   brown bear (URSUS ARCTOS MARSICANUS): a Case report},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},
Month = {MAY 17},
Abstract = {own b BackgroundMycobacterium bovis is known to have a wide host range
   and has been isolated from numerous free-ranging wildlife species,
   carnivores included. In bears, M. bovis has been previously reported
   only from a culture of pooled lymph nodes of a black bear (Ursus
   americanus) in the absence of lesions. The aims of this study were to
   describe gross and microscopic pathological findings of M. bovis
   tuberculosis in a deceased Marsican brown bear (Ursus arctos
   marsicanus).Case presentationIn March 2014, an adult female Marsican
   brown bear was found in the Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise National Park
   (Italy) showing severe non-specific clinical signs. The animal died soon
   after its discovery and the carcass was submitted to post-mortem
   examination to identify the cause of death. The bear was diagnosed with
   a severe Mycobacterium bovis infection, with both pathological and
   microbiological aspects suggesting ongoing generalization. A presumptive
   diagnosis of mycobacterial infection was initially made based on gross
   findings. Histopathology showed the presence of acid-fast bacilli in all
   sampled tissues along with poorly organized granulomatous lesions.
   Slow-growing Mycobacterium sp. was isolated from multiple organs
   (intestine, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, lung and kidneys).
   The PCR and sequencing algorithm identified the Mycobacterium sp.
   isolate as M. bovis. Spoligotyping demonstrated that the M. bovis
   isolate belonged to spoligotype SB0120.ConclusionsThis is the first
   report of lethal M. bovis tuberculosis infection in a free-ranging
   brear. This pathogen could have serious adverse effects in an endangered
   relic population such as the Marsican brown bear. Stricter application
   of health regulations in force, surveillance of M. bovis infections in
   wild ungulates and carnivore scavengers, along with dismissal of

Abstract = {Escherichia coli causes a significant number of clinical mastitis cases
   in dairy cattle worldwide. The antimicrobial susceptibility of E. coli
   is important for both human and animal health. Surveillance reports
   recorded that the efficacy of most antibiotics is substantially
   preserved but detection of E. coli from clinical mastitis cases
   producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and plasmid-encoded AmpC
   beta-lactamases has been reported. These resistance determinants have
   frequently been associated with multidrug resistance. The aim of this
   study was to determine if a MacConkey agar medium supplemented with 8
   mg/L of ceftiofur (MC-CEF) could be a useful tool to identify
   cephalosporin-resistant and multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. coli among
   bovine mastitis isolates. During the period 2010-2011, 773 E. coli were
   isolated from bovine clinical mastitis milk samples collected in 80
   dairy farms in Northern Italy. A total of 105 E. coli were selected and
   assigned either to group randomly selected E. coli (RSEC; n = 53), based
   on a random selection among the whole collection of 773 E. coli, or to
   group ceftiofur-resistant E. coli (CEFREC; n = 52). CEFREC isolates were
   identified by spreading the 773 E. coli isolates on MC-CEF. Minimum
   inhibitory concentration (MIC) was used to test the phenotypic
   antimicrobial susceptibility to 16 antibiotics. The MIC results
   confirmed the ceftiofur resistance in 73.1\% (38/52) of CEFREC isolates,
   whereas all RSEC isolates were susceptible to ceftiofur. The comparison
   of MIC values for each antibiotic tested between the two groups revealed
   significantly higher frequencies of resistance to antimicrobials other
   than ceftiofur in the CEFREC group. Resistance profiles highlighted a
   significantly higher frequency of MDR isolates among CEFREC (73.1\%)
   than RSEC (17\%) E. coli. The results showed that MC-CEF may be a useful
   selective medium to identify cephalosporin-resistant and MDR E. coli on
   dairy farms, without performing MIC on all the isolates.},

Abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly malignant tumor that responds
   very poorly to existing therapies, most probably due to its
   extraordinary inter- and intra-tumor molecular heterogeneity. The modest
   therapeutic response to molecular targeted agents underlines the need
   for new therapeutic approaches for HCC. In our study, we took advantage
   of well-characterized human HCC cell lines, differing in transcriptomic
   subtypes, DNA mutation and amplification alterations, reflecting the
   heterogeneity of primary HCCs, to provide a preclinical evaluation of
   the specific heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor AUY922
   (luminespib). Indeed, HSP90 is highly expressed in different tumor
   types, but its role in hepatocarcinogenesis remains unclear. Here, we
   analyzed HSP90 expression in primary human HCC tissues and evaluated the
   antitumor effects of AUY922 in vitro as well as in vivo. HSP90
   expression was significantly higher in HCC tissues than in cirrhotic
   peritumoral liver tissues. AUY922 treatment reduced the cell
   proliferation and viability of HCC cells in a dose-dependent manner, but
   did not do so for normal human primary hepatocytes. AUY922 treatment led
   to the upregulation of HSP70 and the simultaneous depletion of HSP90
   client proteins. In addition, in a cell type-dependent manner, treatment
   induced either both caspase-dependent beta-catenin cleavage and the
   upregulation of p53, or Mcl-1 expression, or NUPR1 expression, which
   contributed to the increased efficacy of, or resistance to, treatment.
   Finally, in vivo AUY922 inhibited tumor growth in a xenograft model. In
   conclusion, HSP90 is a promising therapeutic target in HCC, and AUY922
   could be a drug candidate for its treatment.},

Title = {Equine trypanosomosis: enigmas and diagnostic challenges},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Equine trypanosomosis is a complex of infectious diseases called
   dourine, nagana and surra. It is caused by several species of the genus
   Trypanosoma that are transmitted cyclically by tsetse flies,
   mechanically by other haematophagous flies, or sexually. Trypanosoma
   congolense (subgenus Nannomonas) and T. vivax (subgenus Dutonella) are
   genetically and morphologically distinct from T. brucei, T. equiperdum
   and T. evansi (subgenus Trypanozoon). It remains controversial whether
   the three latter taxa should be considered distinct species. Recent
   outbreaks of surra and dourine in Europe illustrate the risk and
   consequences of importation of equine trypanosomosis with infected
   animals into non-endemic countries. Knowledge on the epidemiological
   situation is fragmentary since many endemic countries do not report the
   diseases to the World Organisation for Animal Health, OIE. Other major
   obstacles to the control of equine trypanosomosis are the lack of
   vaccines, the inability of drugs to cure the neurological stage of the
   disease, the inconsistent case definition and the limitations of current
   diagnostics. Especially in view of the ever-increasing movement of
   horses around the globe, there is not only the obvious need for reliable
   curative and prophylactic drugs but also for accurate diagnostic tests
   and algorithms. Unfortunately, clinical signs are not pathognomonic,
   parasitological tests are not sufficiently sensitive, serological tests
   miss sensitivity or specificity, and molecular tests cannot distinguish
   the taxa within the Trypanozoon subgenus. To address the limitations of
   the current diagnostics for equine trypanosomosis, we recommend studies
   into improved molecular and serological tests with the highest possible
   sensitivity and specificity. We realise that this is an ambitious goal,
   but it is dictated by needs at the point of care. However, depending on
   available treatment options, it may not always be necessary to identify
   which trypanosome taxon is responsible for a given infection.},

Title = {Two similar commercial live attenuated AMPV vaccines prepared by random

Abstract = {Since late `80 s Avian metapneumovirus subtype A causes sufficient
   disease in Europe for commercial companies to have started developing
   live attenuated vaccines. Here, two of those vaccines were fully
   consensus sequenced alongside their progenitor field strain (\#8544).
   Sequences comparison shows that the attenuation of field strain \#8544
   was associated with no common substitutions between the two derived
   vaccines. This finding suggests that the attenuation of field viruses
   via serial passage on cell cultures or tissues is the result of a random
   process, rather than a mechanism aiming to achieve a specific sequence.
   Furthermore, field vaccination strategies would greatly benefit by the
   unambiguous vaccine markers identified in this study, enabling a prompt
   and confident vaccines detection. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {A cross-talk between blood-cell neuroplasticity-related genes and

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAY 6},
Abstract = {This study aims to identify a panel of blood-cell
   neuroplasticity-related genes expressed following environmental
   enrichment stimulation (EE). The Drug detection (DD) training course was
   an excellent model for the study of EE in the working dog. This research
   is divided into two experimental trials. In the First Trial, we
   identified a panel of blood-cell neuroplasticity related-genes
   associated with DD ability acquired during the training course. In the
   Second Trial, we assessed the EE additional factor complementary feeding
   effect on blood-cell neuroplasticity gene expressions. In the First and
   Second Trials, at different time points of the DD test, blood samples
   were collected, and NGF, BDNF, VEGFA, IGF1, EGR1, NGFR, and ICE2
   blood-cell neuroplasticity related-genes were analyzed. As noted in the
   First Trial, the DD test in working dogs induced the transient
   up-regulation ofVEGFA, NGF, NGFR, BDNF, and IGF, immediately after the
   DD test, suggesting the existence of gene regulations. On the contrary,
   the Second Trial, with feeding implementation, showed an absence of mRNA
   up-regulation after the DD test. We suppose that complementary feeding
   alters the systemic metabolism, which, in turn, changes
   neuroplasticity-related gene blood-cell mRNA. These findings suggested
   that, in working dogs, there is a cross-talk between blood-cell
   neuroplasticity-related genes and environmental enrichment. These
   outcomes could be used to improve future treatments in sensory
   implementation.},

Title = {Report of the human body louse (Pediculus humanus) from clothes sold in
   a market in central Italy},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Month = {MAY 3},
Abstract = {BackgroundPediculus humanus, the human body louse, is widespread where
   overcrowding and lack of hygiene are present, in areas of the world
   affected by poverty, war, famine and presence of refugees. It has
   recently been considered re-emerging among homeless populations in
   developed countries. In Italy, it was last reported in 1945. Pediculus
   humanus is a vector of highly relevant human pathogens.MethodsIn October
   2018, a woman found small insects on a T-shirt bought second-hand in a
   local street market in a village 35km south of Rome (central Italy).
   Insects were identified both morphologically and by molecular analysis.
   Moreover, they were analyzed molecularly for the presence of Rickettsia
   prowazekii, Borrelia recurrentis, Bartonella quintana, Coxiella burnetii
   and Yersinia pestis.ResultsMorphological and molecular analyses of the
   insects identified them as 26 lice (12 females, 10 males and 4 nymphs)
   of the species P. humanus. Many nits were found on the T-shirt seams.
   DNA of the investigated pathogens was not detected in any of the
   lice.ConclusionsThe exceptionality of the described case lies both in
   the report of P. humanus from a country where it had not been reported
   since 1945, and in its finding from second-hand clothes for sale in a
   market, constituting a potential source of infection for people buying
   this type of goods. The question arises, how did adults and nits of P.
   humanus infest clothes for sale on a market stall in a country where it
   had not been reported for decades. Given that the body louse requires
   frequent blood meals to survive and develop, its arrival on clothes
   imported from abroad is highly improbable. Hence, it must be presumed
   that people infected with the human body louse are present in Italy.
   This report points out a serious regulatory problem regarding the
   management of second-hand clothes prior to sale and, more generally, of
   controls in street markets.},

Title = {Two novel amino acid substitutions in highly conserved regions of prion

   native Ethiopian goats},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},
Month = {MAY 3},
Abstract = {BackgroundPolymorphisms of the prion protein gene may influence scrapie
   susceptibility in small ruminants through modified protein conformation.
   At least 47 amino acid substitutions and 19 silent polymorphisms have
   been described in goat PRNP reported from several countries. The
   objective of this study was to investigate PRNP polymorphisms of native
   Ethiopian goat breeds and compare the results with other goat
   breeds.ResultsThe analysis of the prion protein gene PRNP in 229 goats
   belonging to three of the main Ethiopian native goat breeds showed a
   remarkably high frequency (>34.6\%) of p.(Asn146Ser) in these breeds, a
   variant involved in scrapie resistance in Cyprus. In addition, two novel
   amino-acid substitutions p.(Gly127Ala) and p.(Thr193Ile), with
   frequencies ranging from 1.5 to 7.3\% were detected. Both amino acids
   are well conserved in prion proteins (PrP) of most species and these
   changes have never been reported before in goats worldwide. Residue 127
   is within the N-terminal domain of PrP and is probably involved in the
   recruitment of neural cell adhesion molecules (NCAM). Residue 193 is
   within the highly conserved string of 4 threonines that plays a role in
   determining the efficiency of prion protein conversion towards its
   pathological form.ConclusionTwo novel coding polymorphisms and a high
   frequency of a scrapie protective variant indicate a high level of
   genetic diversity in PRNP of Ethiopian goats. This finding increases the
   interest in exploring PRNP polymorphisms of native goat breeds in areas
   where cross breeding with foreign goats has rarely occurred.},

Abstract = {A simple procedure for field fish sample pretreatment was developed.
   This treatment in combination with square wave anodic stripping
   voltammetry (SW-ASV) with solid gold electrodes (SGE) and gold
   nanoparticle-modified glassy carbon electrodes (AuNPs-GCE) was applied
   for the determination of total mercury content. A certified reference
   material (CRM, Tuna Fish BCR 463), ten freeze-dried samples of canned
   tuna and two fresh fish samples were analysed both with a bench-top
   voltammetric analyser after microwave digestion and with a portable
   potentiostat after mild eating using a small commercial food warmer. The
   results obtained by the two SW-ASV approaches and by a Direct Mercury
   Analyser (DMA), the official method for mercury determination, were in
   very good agreement. In particular, (i) the results obtained with in
   field procedure are consistent with those obtained with the conventional
   microwave digestion; (ii) the presence of gold nanoparticles on the
   active electrode surface permits an improvement of the analytical
   performance in comparison to the SGE: the Limit of Quantification (LOQ)
   for mercury in fish-matrix was 0.1 g L-1 (Hg cell concentration),
   corresponding to 0.06 mg kg(-1) wet fish, which is a performance
   comparable to that of DMA. The pretreatment proposed in this study is
   very easy and applicable to fresh fish; in combination with a portable
   potentiostat, it proved to be an interesting procedure for on-site
   mercury determination.},

Abstract = {Intramammary infections are a serious problem in dairy sheep farming,
   and Staphylococcus epidermidis is one of the main etiological agents of
   ovine mastitis. In this work, 199 S. epidermidis isolates collected in
   Sardinia (Italy) from sheep milk samples and used for the preparation of
   inactivated autogenous vaccines were characterized with phenotypic and
   genotypic methods. The potential for biofilm production was evaluated
   phenotypically by assessing colony characteristics on Congo Red Agar
   (CRA), and genotypically by PCR for i) the icaA/D genes coding the
   polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) and ii) for the bhp, aap and
   embp genes coding biofilm accumulation proteins. Isolates were also
   investigated by PCR for the presence of autolysins (atlE and aae genes),
   microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules
   (MSCRAMMs, sdrG and sdrF genes), enterotoxins (sea, seb, sec, sed and
   see genes), and the toxic shock syndrome toxin (tsst genes). In
   addition, the staphylococcal accessory gene regulator (agr), the most
   important locus responsible for the regulation of virulence factors, was
   characterized for the first time. As a result, only two isolates showed
   biofilm production on CRA and harbored the icaA/D genes. Four isolates,
   phenotypically classified as non-biofilm producers, possessed the icaA/D
   genes (n = 3) or only the icaA gene (n = 1). All isolates harbored the
   atlE, aae, embp and sdrG genes, but none harbored the genes encoding
   enterotoxins and tsst. Most isolates belonged to the agr-3(se) group
   (56.3\%), followed by agr-1(se) (41.2\%) and agr-2(se) (2.5\%). All six
   isolates that harbored ica genes belonged to agr-1(se).
   In conclusion, this study provides a detailed characterization of the
   putative virulence genes present in S. epidermidis strains circulating
   in Sardinian sheep. Because of their role in ovine mastitis
   pathogenesis, these might represent valuable candidates for vaccine
   development.},

Abstract = {A total of 172 different salamis were purchased from farms and small
   salami factories located in four Italian regions (Piedmont, Veneto,
   Calabria, and Sicily) and analyzed for the presence of ochratoxin A
   (OTA). Analysis was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography
   coupled to a fluorimetric detector (HPLC-FLD). The detection limit (LOD)
   for the method used was 0.05g/kg, while the quantitation limit (LOQ) was
   0.20g/kg; the average recovery rate was 89.1\%. OTA was detected in 22
   salamis, and 3 samples exceeded the Italian guidance value for OTA in
   pork meat (1g/kg). In particular, what emerges from this research is the
   high percentage of spicy salamis among positive samples (68.2\%, 15 out
   of 22), although spicy salamis are only 27.3\% of the total number of
   samples collected and analyzed. Red chili pepper contaminated by OTA
   could be responsible for the presence of the mycotoxin in these spicy
   salamis. It follow that, also the control of some ingredients used in
   the manufacture of these meat products, like spices, should not be
   neglected.},

Abstract = {Case report A 7-year-old female-neutered Maltese Terrier x Papillon dog
   was presented with tachypnoea and weight loss following 12 months of
   therapy with toceranib phosphate for a metastatic,
   histologically-low-grade mast cell tumour. The dog was diagnosed with
   Pneumocystis canis based on PCR with supportive clinical, radiographic
   and cytological findings. No other clinical evidence of immunocompromise
   was identified through assessment of haematology and immunoglobulin
   quantification. Clinical signs completely resolved with a short course
   of potentiated sulfonamides and discontinuation of the toceranib.
   Conclusion To the authors' knowledge this represents the first case of
   Pneumocystis in a dog secondary to immunomodulatory drug therapy. It is
   also the first case of opportunist infection secondary to a tyrosine

Abstract = {Illegal use of growth promoter compounds in food production exposes
   consumers to health risk. Surveillance of such practices is based on
   direct detection of drugs or related metabolites by HPLC-MS/MS.
   Screening strategies focusing on indirect biological responses are
   considered promising tools to improve surveillance. In this study, an
   untargeted shotgun proteomics approach based on tandem mass tags (TMTs)
   is carried out to identify proteins altered in bovine liver after
   different anabolic treatments. Three controlled pharmacological
   treatments with dexamethasone, a combination of dexamethasone and
   clenbuterol, or a combination of sexual steroids (trenbolone and
   estradiol) are analyzed. Untargeted TMT analysis of liver digests by
   high resolution MS allowed for the relative quantification of proteins.
   Thanks to partial least squarediscriminant analysis, a set of proteins
   capable to classify animals treated with dexamethasone alone (11
   proteins), or in combination with clenbuterol (13 proteins) are
   identified. No significant difference is found upon administration of
   sexual steroids. After relative quantification of candidate markers by
   parallel reaction monitoring (PRM), two predictive models are trained to
   validate protein markers. Finally, an independent animal set of control
   bulls and bulls treated with dexamethasone is analyzed by PRM to further
   validate a predictive model giving an accuracy of 100\%.},

Abstract = {In view of the large number of soil analyses in environmental studies
   dealing with metal contamination, the use of simple, fast, sustainable
   and cost-effective methodologies is desired. In this sense, the role of
   total reflection X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (TXRF) has to be
   highlighted due to the possibility of direct analysis of solid
   suspensions without the need for a digestion process. Internal
   standardization is successfully used as a quantification approach in
   multielement TXRF analysis of liquid samples, including soil digests.
   However, its application for the analysis of soil suspensions is not
   always possible. In the present manuscript we found that although
   acceptable results were obtained for TXRF quantification by internal
   standardization when considering soil certified reference materials
   (recoveries: 80-120\%), a systematic underestimation of the
   concentration values was found when using the same approach for real
   soil sample analysis (recoveries <70\%). In view of these problems, we
   explored the possibilities of different quantification approaches,
   including external calibration, which can be used in combination with
   soil suspension preparation and TXRF analysis to obtain reliable results
   for metal determination in soils. Data obtained showed that the best
   strategy was the use of internal standardization with correction of the
   TXRF results using a calibration curve obtained in the analysis of a set
   of soil samples with a matrix similar to the unknown ones by using a
   reference technique (digestion and ICP-OES analysis). With this
   analytical approach quantitative results were obtained for all the
   studied metals with recovery values around 95\%. As a study case, the
   proposed TXRF method has been applied for the specific determination of
   Pb, Zn and Cd concentrations in soils from an abandoned metal mining
   area but the developed methodology could be extended to other
   environmental studies dealing with the determination of other metals and
   soil types. Taking into account the selectivity and sensitivity
   limitations when determining high Z elements such as Cd using TXRF
   systems equipped with Mo X-ray tubes, we compare the analytical
   performance of TXRF systems with different sources (Mo and W) as well.},

Abstract = {Over the last 20 years, Italy has experienced multiple incursions of
   different serotypes of Bluetongue virus (BTV), a Culicoides-borne
   arbovirus, the causative agent of bluetongue (BT), a major disease of
   ruminants. The majority of these incursions originated from Northern
   Africa, likely because of wind-blown dissemination of infected midges.
   Here, we report the first identification of BTV-3 in Sardinia, Italy.
   BTV-3 circulation was evidenced in sentinel animals located in the
   province of Sud Sardegna on September 19, 2018. Prototype strain BTV-3
   SAR2018 was isolated on cell culture. BTV-3 SAR2018 sequence and partial
   sequences obtained by next-generation sequencing from nucleic acids
   purified from the isolate and blood samples, respectively, were
   demonstrated to be almost identical (99-100\% of nucleotide identity) to
   BTV-3 TUN2016 identified in Tunisia in 2016 and 2017, a scenario already
   observed in past incursions of other BTV serotypes originating from
   Northern Africa.},

Title = {Text Mining Analysis to Evaluate Stakeholders' Perception Regarding
   Welfare of Equines, Small Ruminants, and Turkeys},

Abstract = {Simple Summary Consumers are currently more sensitive regarding the way
   animals are kept and handled and, in general, have increased their
   awareness towards animal welfare. There is a close link between welfare
   of animals and stakeholders' perception of their needs. This study aimed
   at investigating stakeholders' perception of the welfare of equines,
   small ruminants, and turkeys using a text mining approach to analyze
   their answers to open-ended questions. A total of 270 surveys were
   collected from respondents of 32 different countries. Independently from
   the species, respondents considered that an animal needs appropriate
   nutrition to be fit, healthy, and productive. The environment was
   considered particularly important for turkey stakeholders, whereas
   housing factors were relevant for goat stakeholders. Horse stakeholders
   also considered exercise, pasture and proper training important.
   Although the sample was too small to analyze variation in welfare
   perception among stakeholders of different species, text mining analysis
   seems to be a promising method to investigate stakeholders' perception
   of animal welfare, as it emphasizes their real perception, without the
   constraints deriving by close-ended questions.
   Abstract Welfare of animals significantly depends on how stakeholders
   perceive their needs and behave in a way to favor production systems
   that promote better welfare outcomes. This study aimed at investigating
   stakeholders' perception of the welfare of equines, small ruminants, and
   turkeys using text mining analysis. A survey composed by open-ended
   questions referring to different aspects of animal welfare was carried
   out. Text mining analysis was performed. A total of 270 surveys were
   filled out (horses = 122, sheep = 81, goats = 36, turkeys = 18, donkeys
   = 13). The respondents (41\% veterinarians) came from 32 different
   countries. To describe welfare requirements, the words feeding and water
   were the most frequently used in all the species, meaning that
   respondents considered the welfare principle good feeding as the most
   relevant. The word environment was considered particularly important for
   turkeys, as well as the word dry, never mentioned for other species.
   Horses stakeholders also considered exercise and proper training
   important. Goat stakeholders' concerns are often expressed by the word
   space, probably because goats are often intensively managed in
   industrialized countries. Although the sample was too small to be
   representative, text mining analysis seems to be a promising method to
   investigate stakeholders' perception of animal welfare, as it emphasizes
   their real perception, without the constraints deriving by close-ended
   questions.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Bluetongue is an infectious disease transmitted by Culicoides biting
   midges. Culicoides imicola is considered the main vector in the
   Mediterranean basin but other species have been implicated in the
   Bluetongue virus (BTV) transmission. During 2017, BTV serotype 4
   re-occurred in Sardinia causing outbreaks in sheep farms. A survey was
   carried out on affected farms with the aim to detect the virus in
   field-collected Culicoides. Biting midges were morphologically
   identified, pooled and then assayed with a real time RT-PCR. To evaluate
   BTV dissemination, some Culicoides were dissected and head, thorax and
   abdomen were tested singly by PCR. A total of 173,738 Culicoides adults
   were collected. Viral RNA was detected in 68 out of 77 pools and all
   species analysed resulted positive. Detection of BTV in parous female
   body regions (head, thorax and abdomen) confirmed the full dissemination
   of BTV in all species analysed. During this study, the vector competence
   of C imicola, C newsteadi s.l. and Obsoletus complex was confirmed. The
   authors found two new Culicoides species BTV positive, C paolae never
   associated with BTV transmission and C circumscriptus only recently
   found BTV positive in Turkey, which could be considered potential
   vectors.},

Abstract = {Several viral infections of swine are responsible for major economic
   losses and represent a threat to the swine industry worldwide. New tools
   are needed to prevent and control endemic, emerging, and re-emerging
   viral diseases. Dendritic cells (DC) play a central role in linking the
   innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, so knowledge regarding
   their interaction with pathogens is necessary to understand the
   mechanisms underlying diseases pathogenesis and protection. In the first
   part of this review, we provide an update on the heterogeneous cell
   subsets that comprise the porcine DC family. In the second part of this
   review, we provide an overview of how three viruses, affecting pork
   production at a global level, African swine fever virus (ASFV),
   classical swine fever virus (CSFV), and porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2),
   modulate DC function.},

Abstract = {African swine fever (ASF) is a notifiable infectious disease, caused by
   the ASF virus (ASFV), which is a DNA virus belonging to the family
   Asfarviridae, genus Asfivirus. This disease has gained importance in the
   last decade after its spread in several countries in Eastern and Central
   Europe, and more recently, in China. Despite the efforts made to
   eradicate it, ASF is still present on the Mediterranean island of
   Sardinia (Italy) and has been since 1978. ASF risk factors on the island
   have been analysed in previous studies; the role of free-ranging pigs in
   virus persistence has been suggested, but has not been fully elucidated.
   The most recent eradication plan provides more stringent measures to
   combat free-ranging pigs and any kind of illegality in the pig sector.
   From December 2017 to June 2018, a total of 29 depopulation actions were
   performed in 13 municipalities in central Sardinia, during which 2,281
   free-ranging pigs were culled and more than 50\% of them were tested for
   ASFV and antibody presence (1,218 and 1,416, respectively). A total of
   651 pigs were seropositive, with a mean seroprevalence of 53.4\% (CI
   95\% = 50.6-56.3), and 38 were ASFV positive (virus prevalence = 2.6\%;
   CI 95\% = 2.1-3.0). To the best of our knowledge, the present study is
   the first to provide a complete evaluation of this millennial system of
   pig farming and ASFV prevalence in free-ranging pigs. Furthermore, it
   has emphasised the necessity of combining the maintenance of an
   epidemiological surveillance program with continuous education of
   farmers and other people involved in pig husbandry, based on cultural
   and economic aspects.},

Abstract = {The cellular prion protein (PrPC), whose misfolded conformers are
   implicated in prion diseases, localizes to both the presynaptic membrane
   and postsynaptic density. To explore possible molecular contributions of
   PrPC to synaptic transmission, we utilized a mass spectrometry approach
   to quantify the release of glutamate from primary cerebellar granule
   neurons (CGN) expressing, or deprived of (PrP-KO), PrPC, following a
   depolarizing stimulus. Under the same conditions, we also tracked
   recycling of synaptic vesicles (SVs) in the two neuronal populations. We
   found that in PrP-KO CGN these processes decreased by 40 and 60\%,
   respectively, compared to PrPC-expressing neurons. Unbiased quantitative
   mass spectrometry was then employed to compare the whole proteome of CGN
   with the two PrP genotypes. This approach allowed us to assess that,
   relative to the PrPC-expressing counterpart, the absence of PrPC
   modified the protein expression profile, including diminution of some
   components of SV recycling and fusion machinery. Subsequent quantitative
   RT-PCR closely reproduced proteomic data, indicating that PrPC is
   committed to ensuring optimal synaptic transmission by regulating genes
   involved in SV dynamics and neurotransmitter release. These novel
   molecular and cellular aspects of PrPC add insight into the underlying
   mechanisms for synaptic dysfunctions occurring in neurodegenerative
   disorders in which a compromised PrPC is likely to intervene.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Buffalo mastitis is an important economic problem in southern Italy,
   causing qualitative/quantitative alterations in milk and resulting in
   economic losses due to the sub-clinical course and chronic evolution. We
   investigated 50 udders of slaughtered buffaloes and subjected them to
   effectual microbiological screening to evaluate macro and microscopic
   mammary gland changes, immune-characterize the cell infiltrates, and
   compare the degree of tissue inflammation with somatic cell counts.
   Numerous Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from all
   samples, majority of which were environmental mastitis pathogens.
   Histological features referable to chronic mastitis were observed in
   92\% udders. Lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages were found to
   evolve into aggregates in 48\% udders, which often organized to form
   tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs). A predominance of interstitial CD8+
   over CD4+ lymphocytes and, in TLSs, scattered CD8+ lymphocytes in the
   mantle cells and CD79+ lymphocytes in germinal centers, were evidenced.
   Environmental pathogens are known to persist and cause chronic
   inflammatory changes in buffaloes, where CD8+ lymphocytes play an
   important role by controlling the local immune response. Moreover, the
   TLSs evidenced here for the first time in buffalo mastitis, could play a
   role in maintaining immune responses against persistent antigens,
   thereby contributing in determining the chronic course of mastitis.},

Abstract = {Microorganisms belonging to the Lactobacillus genus complex (LGC) are
   naturally associated or deliberately added to fermented food products
   and are widely used as probiotic food supplements. Moreover, these
   bacteria normally colonize the mouth, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and
   female genitourinary tract of humans. They exert multiple beneficial
   effects and are regarded as safe microorganisms. However, infections
   caused by lactobacilli, mainly endocarditis, bacteremia, and
   pleuropneumonia, occasionally occur. The relevance of Lactobacillus spp.
   and other members of the LGC as opportunistic pathogens in humans and
   related risk factors and predisposing conditions are illustrated in this
   review article with more emphasis on the species L. rhamnosus that has
   been more often involved in infection cases. The methods used to
   identify this species in clinical samples, to distinguish strains and to
   evaluate traits that can be associated to pathogenicity, as well as
   future perspectives for improving the identification of potentially
   pathogenic strains, are outlined.},

Abstract = {Sulcascaris sulcata Rudolphi 1819 is a gastric nematode parasite of sea
   turtles. Here, we report the occurrence and describe for the first time
   the pathological changes caused by S. sulcata in the Mediterranean
   loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) stranded along the Tyrrhenian
   coast and northern Adriatic coast of Italy. Prevalence of infection was
   significantly higher in loggerhead sea turtles from the Adriatic Sea.
   Both prevalence and abundance of infection showed an increasing trend
   along with host age classes from both geographical localities.
   Nevertheless, while many small loggerhead sea turtles were found
   infected from the Adriatic Sea, only bigger individuals were infected
   from the Tyrrhenian Sea. The most common gross pathological change was a
   mucous gastritis with focal to multifocal raised ulcerous lesions
   roundish to irregular in shape ranging from 1 to over 20cm in length,
   and cream-yellowish to greenish in color. The severity grade of
   gastritis increased with higher number of S. sulcata individuals.
   Microscopic pathological changes ranged from atrophic gastritis with
   heterophilic infiltration in the lamina propria to the destruction of
   the mucosal and sub-mucosal surfaces and necrosis. Results here obtained
   demonstrate that S. sulcata may cause ulcerous gastritis in both samples
   of loggerhead sea turtles studied from the Mediterranean Sea. Observed
   differences in S. sulcata infection among the different host age classes
   and between the two studied basins are likely linked to the differences
   of regional habitat and intermediate prey host availability.},

Abstract = {Small hive beetles (SHBs) are parasites of social bee colonies endemic
   to sub-Saharan Africa and have become a widespread invasive species. In
   the new ranges, SHBs can cause damage to apiculture and wild bees.
   Although the further spread seems inevitable, eradication of new
   introductions and containment of established ones are nevertheless
   urgently required to slow down the invasion speed until better
   mitigation options are available. However, at present there is no
   adequate action plan at hand. Here, we propose to take advantage of SHB
   invasion history and biology to enrol a feasible plan involving all
   stakeholders. Raising awareness, education and motivation of
   stakeholders (incl. adequate and timely compensation of beekeepers) is
   essential for success. Moreover, sentinel apiaries are recommended in
   areas at risk, because early detection is crucial for the success of
   eradication efforts. Given that introductions are detected early, SHB
   eradication is recommended, incl. destruction of all infested apiaries,
   installation of sentinel colonies to lure escaped SHBs and a ban on
   migratory beekeeping. If wild perennial social bee colonies are
   infested, eradication programs are condemned to fail and a strategic
   switch to a containment strategy is recommended. Containment includes
   adequate integrated pest management and a strict ban on migratory
   beekeeping. Despite considerable gaps in our knowledge of SHBs, the
   proposed action plan will help stakeholders to slow down the global
   spread of SHBs.},

Title = {Jet-Setting Koalas Spread Cryptococcus gattii VGII in Australia},
Journal = {MSPHERE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {Cryptococcus gattii molecular type VGII is one of the etiologic agents
   of cryptococcosis, a systemic mycosis affecting a wide range of host
   species. Koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) exhibit a comparatively high
   prevalence of cryptococcosis (clinical and subclinical) and nasal
   colonization, particularly in captivity. In Australia, disease
   associated with C. gattii VGII is typically confined to Western
   Australia and the Northern Territory (with sporadic cases reported in
   eastern Australia), occupying an enigmatic ecologic niche. A cluster of
   cryptococcosis in captive koalas in eastern Australia (five confirmed
   cases, a further two suspected), caused predominantly by C. gattii VGII,
   was investigated by surveying for subclinical disease, culturing koala
   nasal swabs and environmental samples, and genotyping cryptococcal
   isolates. URA5 restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis,
   multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and whole-genome sequencing (WGS)
   provided supportive evidence that the transfer of koalas from Western
   Australia and subsequently between several facilities in Queensland
   spread VGII into uncontaminated environments and environments in which
   C. gattii VGI was endemic. MLST identified VGII isolates as
   predominantly sequence type 7, while WGS further confirmed a limited
   genomic diversity and revealed a basal relationship with isolates from
   Western Australia. We hypothesize that this represents a founder effect
   following the introduction of a koala from Western Australia. Our
   findings suggest a possible competitive advantage for C. gattii VGII
   over VGI in the context of this captive koala environment. The ability
   of koalas to seed C. gattii VGII into new environments has implications
   for the management of captive populations and movements of koalas
   between zoos.
   IMPORTANCE Cryptococcus gattii molecular type VGII is one of the causes
   of cryptococcosis, a severe fungal disease that is acquired from the
   environment and affects many host species (including humans and koalas).
   In Australia, disease caused by C. gattii VGII is largely confined to
   western and central northern parts of the country, with sporadic cases
   reported in eastern Australia. We investigated an unusual case cluster
   of cryptococcosis, caused predominantly by C. gattii VGII, in a group of
   captive koalas in eastern Australia. This research identified that the
   movements of koalas between wildlife parks, including an initial
   transfer of a koala from Western Australia, introduced and subsequently
   spread C. gattii VGII in this captive environment. The spread of this
   pathogen by koalas could also impact other species, and these findings
   are significant in the implications they have for the management of
   koala transfers and captive environments.},

Abstract = {Since 2005, two cases of natural bovine spongiform encephalopathies
   (BSE) have been reported in goats. Furthermore, experimental
   transmissions of classical (C-BSE) and atypical (L-BSE) forms of BSE in
   goats were also reported. To minimize further spreading of prion
   diseases in small ruminants the development of a highly sensitive and
   specific test for ante-mortem detection of infected animals would be of
   great value. Recent studies reported high diagnostic value of a second
   generation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Real-Time Quaking-Induced
   Conversion (RT-QuIC) assay across a wide spectrum of human prions. Here,
   we applied this improved QuIC (IQ-CSF) for highly efficient detection of
   TSEs prion protein in goat cerebrospinal fluid. IQ-CSF sensitivity and
   specificity were evaluated on CSF samples collected at disease endpoint
   from goats naturally and experimentally infected with scrapie or bovine
   isolates of C-BSE and L-BSE, respectively. Next, CSF samples collected
   from L-BSE infected goats during pre-symptomatic stage were also
   analysed. PrPL BSE associated seeding activity was detected at early
   time points after experimental inoculation, with an average time of 439
   days before clinical symptoms appeared. Taken together these data are
   indicative of the great potential of this in vitro prion amplification
   assay as ante-mortem TSE test for live and asymptomatic small ruminants.},

Title = {First report of Salmonella 1,4,{[}5],12:i:- in free-ranging striped

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {Between 2015 and the beginning of 2018 (January-March), 30 cetaceans
   were found stranded along the Ligurian Sea coast of Italy. Necropsies
   were performed in 22 cases and infectious diseases resulted the most
   common cause of death. Three striped dolphins, showed a severe
   coinfection involving the monophasic variant of Salmonella Typhimurium
   (Salmonella 1,4,{[}5],12:i:-). The isolates were characterized based on
   antimicrobial resistance, Multiple-Locus Variable-number tandem-repeat
   Analysis (MLVA) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). All isolates
   demonstrated the same multidrug resistant genotype (ASSuT isolates),
   showed three different MLVA profiles, two of which closely related, and
   were identified as Sequence Type 34. Moreover, Single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNP) analysis confirmed strong correlations between two
   out of the three isolates. To our knowledge, S. 1,4,{[}5],12:i:-, one of
   the most common serovars in cases of human infection and food sources
   worldwide, has not previously been described in marine mammals, and
   reports of Salmonella-associated disease in free-ranging cetaceans are
   rare. These results highlight the role of cetaceans as sentinel species
   for zoonotic and terrestrial pathogens in the marine environment,
   suggest a potential risk for cetaceans and public health along the North
   Western Italian coastline and indicate cetaceans as a novel potential
   reservoir for one of the most widespread Salmonella serovars.},

Abstract = {Rare earth elements (REEs) are central in several critical technologies;
   their use is constantly increasing as is their release into the
   environment. For this reason, it is important to investigate REE
   concentrations in different matrices to evaluate human exposure and
   environmental risk of these emerging contaminants.
   REEs were measured by ICP-MS in matrices of terrestrial (plant feed,
   fruit, honey, wildlife livers) and marine origin (seaweeds, zooplankton,
   bivalves, fish) collected from Northwestern Italy. Highest REE
   concentrations were measured at low trophic levels, both in terrestrial
   and marine environments, such as plants (Sigma REE 1.8 mg kg(-1)) and
   seaweed (Sigma REE 12 mg kg(-1)), the major source of exposure and
   transfer of REEs to food webs. REE concentrations were several orders of
   magnitude lower in fruit, honey, and livers from terrestrial wildlife,
   suggesting a negligible risk of exposure by these matrices. Marine
   biota, such as bivalves (Sigma REE 0.16 mg kg(-1)) and fish (Sigma REE
   0.21 mg kg(-1)) may constitute a pathway for human or animal dietary
   exposure.
   The study confirmed that REEs have low potential for biomagnification,
   but instead are subject to trophic dilution. However, given the numerous
   sources of dietary introduction of REEs, they should be monitored for a
   possible harmful cumulative effect.
   Owing to the scarcity of data regarding REEs worldwide, our results
   contribute to assessment of the occurrence of these emerging
   contaminants. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {One of the major constraints in the diagnosis of animal brucellosis is
   the cross-reactivity that occurs between Brucella and Yersinia surface
   antigens. With the aim to find a method to distinguish Brucella from
   Yersinia infection, the expansion of interferon gamma producing
   (IFN-gamma(+)) T cell subsets obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear
   cells (PBMC) isolated from cattle either infected by Brucella abortus or
   experimentally immunized with Yersinia enterocolitica O:9 were compared.
   The lymphocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry after PBMC were in vitro
   re-exposed to Yersinia or Brucella antigens. The results highlighted a
   statistically significant difference in the expansion of the CD4(+) and
   CD8(+)IFN-gamma T+ cells occurring when PBMC of animals immunized with
   Yersinia are in vitro exposed to Y. enterocolitica O:9 antigen but not
   to Brucella antigen. This method could thus be suggested in those cases
   where results obtained by serodiagnosis need to be further clarified.},

Abstract = {Purpose Sesame can cause food allergy and according to European
   legislation, its presence in food must be declared on the label. The
   purpose of this paper is to investigate the presence of sesame in food
   products carrying no mention of sesame on the ingredient label and in
   food products carrying the voluntary labelling statement ``may contain
   traces of sesame{''}. Design/methodology/approach Packaged bakery and
   non-bakery food items were collected at retail. Sample size was
   calculated according to estimated prevalence of 2 per cent and precision
   of 5 per cent: in total 32 samples of packaged bakery and non-bakery
   food were collected for each food category. The RIDASCREEN (R) FAST
   Sesame test (R-Biopharm AG, Darmstadt, Germany) was used for the
   analysis: its limit of detection was fixed in the laboratory at 0.5 ppm.
   Findings Of the 32 food samples that did not mention sesame seed on the
   ingredient label, one (3.1 per cent) breadsticks sample tested positive
   at a concentration (326 ppm). Of the 32 food samples that carried the
   precautionary label statement ``may contain traces of sesame{''}, one
   (3.1 per cent) breadcrumbs sample tested positive (305 ppm). Comparison
   between the allergen concentration and the published eliciting dose
   (ED5) for sesame proteins (1 mg) was performed. The calculated exposure
   was more than 2 the ED05 reported in the literature. Originality/value
   To date, few studies investigating compliance with food-allergen
   labelling requirements are available. This survey provides data for
   preliminary risk assessment for sesame allergenic consumers.},

Title = {Yeasts isolated from cloacal swabs, feces, and eggs of laying hens},
Journal = {MEDICAL MYCOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {57},
Number = {3},
Pages = {340-345},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Domestic and wild birds may act as carriers of human pathogenic fungi,
   although the role of laying hens in spreading yeasts has never been
   investigated. We evaluated the presence of yeasts in the cloaca (Group
   I, n = 364), feces (Group II, n = 96), and eggs (Group III, n = 270) of
   laying hens. The occurrence and the population size of yeasts on the
   eggshell, as well as in the yolks and albumens, were assessed at the
   oviposition time and during storage of eggs at 22 +/- 1 degrees C and 4
   +/- 1 degrees C. A statistically higher prevalence and population size
   of yeasts were recorded in Group I (49.7\% and 1.3 x 10(4) cfu/ml) and
   II (63.8\% and 2.8 x 10(5) cfu/ml) than in Group III (20.7\% and 19.9
   cfu/ml). Candida catenulata and Candida albicans were the most frequent
   species isolated. Candida famata and Trichosporon asteroides were
   isolated only from the eggshells, whereas Candida catenulata was also
   isolated from yolks and albumens. During storage, the yeast population
   size on the shell decreased (from 37.5 to 8.5 cfu/ml) in eggs at 22 +/-
   1 degrees C and increased (from 4.6 to 35.3 cfu/ml) at 4 +/- 1 degrees
   C. The laying hens harbor potentially pathogenic yeasts in their
   gastrointestinal tract and are prone to disseminating them in the
   environment through the feces and eggs. Eggshell contamination might
   occur during the passage through the cloaca or following deposition
   whereas yolk and albumen contamination might depend on yeast density on
   eggshell.},

Title = {A new approach to outbreak management for bovine Cystic Echinococcosis
   cases in hypo-endemic areas},
Journal = {VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY- REGIONAL STUDIES AND REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Cystic Echinococcosis (CE) surveillance in Italy is based on detection
   of its larval stage (hydatic cysts) at the slaughterhouse. In northern
   Italy, a hypo-endemic area, local health authorities investigate each
   individual farm with positive animals to treat their dogs with
   cestocidal drugs, but this system is time-consuming and poorly effective
   for bovine farms. The study applied a new approach based on targeted
   epidemiological surveys in areas with aggregation of bovine CE cases,
   and compared the outcome with that of two control areas with farms
   individually investigated.
   The presence of territorial cluster of bovine farms with CE cases was
   investigated for 3 consecutive years (2013-2014-2015) in a high-risk
   area of Veneto Region (north-eastern Italy), using a spatial scan
   statistic. Epidemiological investigations, consisting of a questionnaire
   survey and canine faecal samples collection, were conducted in cluster
   and control areas. All faecal samples were analyzed for taeniids eggs
   and positive samples were sequenced and identified.
   In total, 99 farms were surveyed and 208 faecal samples were retrieved
   from dogs. Sixty-two farms (42 bovine and 20 sheep) were investigated in
   cluster areas and 37 farms (33 bovine and 4 sheep) in control areas.
   Based on the results of the cestode egg isolation procedure, 14 animals
   (6.7\%) were positive to taeniid eggs. For molecular analysis, two dogs
   resulted positive to Echinococcus granulosus, and seven to Taenia
   hydatigena. Twelve positive dogs were found in targeted survey areas and
   ten of these dogs were shepherd dogs, belonging to transhumant sheep
   flocks known to pass in cluster areas.
   The new approach demonstrated to successfully identify the probable
   source of infection of CE positive bovines. Most of positive dogs
   belonged to transhumant flocks, underlining the importance to include
   shepherd dogs in the surveillance system for CE.},

Abstract = {Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neural disorder gradually
   leading to paralysis of the whole body. Alterations in superoxide
   dismutase SOD1 gene have been linked with several variants of familial
   ALS. Here, we investigated a transgenic (Tg) cloned swine model
   expressing the human pathological hSOD1(G93A) allele. As in patients,
   these Tg pigs transmitted the disease to the progeny with an autosomal
   dominant trait and showed ALS onset from about 27 months of age. Post
   mortem analysis revealed motor neuron (MN) degeneration, gliosis and
   hSOD1 protein aggregates in brainstem and spinal cord. Severe skeletal
   muscle pathology including necrosis and inflammation was observed at the
   end stage, as well. Remarkably, as in human patients, these Tg pigs
   showed a quite long presymptomatic phase in which gradually increasing
   amounts of TDP-43 were detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
   Thus, this transgenic swine model opens the unique opportunity to
   investigate ALS biomarkers even before disease onset other than testing
   novel drugs and possible medical devices.},

Abstract = {Giant African land snails (Achatina fulica) are becoming increasingly
   popular pets and may be anaesthetised to allow diagnostics and surgical
   procedures. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the
   anaesthetic effects and anaesthetic-related complications of immersion
   in 5\% ethanol in client-owned African pet land snails, anaesthetised to
   allow biopsies of the foot for screening of parasites. Variables such as
   minutes elapsing from immersion to anaesthetic induction and from
   removal from the bath to return of tentacle withdrawal reflex and
   recovery from anaesthesia were recorded, as well as the occurrence of
   adverse effects. Of the 30 snails enrolled, one (3.3\%) had a fatal
   outcome whereas the remaining 29 (96.7\%) snails completed the study and
   recovered from anaesthesia. Time to anaesthetic induction was 25
   {[}25-29] minutes. Recovery was prolonged in one snail, which required
   210 minutes to regain normal muscular strength. Time from removal from
   the ethanol solution to return of tentacle withdrawal reflex was 20
   {[}14-42] minutes. Beside death, other observed adverse effects were
   production of bubbles (n = 4; 13.3\%), and mucus secretion (n = 4;
   13.3\%). Immersion in 5\% ethanol may be regarded as suitable
   anaesthetic technique for African giant snails for brief and moderately
   invasive surgical procedures. Nevertheless, recovery from anaesthesia
   may be prolonged and unpredictable.},

Abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is able to produce enterotoxins causing
   staphylococcal food poisoning, and is frequently harboured by dairy
   products. Also, S. aureus is able to form biofilm in the production
   environment, enhancing the risk of food contamination. The ability of 49
   S. aureus isolates from the dairy production chain to form biofilm aim
   was tested, and their genetic diversity in terms of population structure
   and presence of genes involved in biofilm formation or enterotoxins
   production was explored. The majority of the genotypes found were
   generally bovine associated; however, some have been also reported
   frequently in human clinical cases. Two isolates were
   methicillin-resistant. In total, 38.7\% of the isolates were biofilm
   producers, and among them 47.3\%, 42.1\% and 10.5\% exhibited weak,
   moderate, or strong biofilm-forming ability, respectively. In total 68\%
   of the biofilm producing isolates were also positive for enterotoxins
   genes, raising concerns for consumer safety. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {In fuel-cell technology development, one of the most important
   objectives is to minimize the amount of Pt, the most employed material
   as an oxygen reduction and methanol oxidation electro-catalyst. In this
   paper, we report the synthesis and characterization of Te nanotubes
   (TeNTs) decorated with Pt nanoparticles, readily prepared from stirred
   aqueous solutions of PtCl2 containing a suspension of TeNTs, and ethanol
   acting as a reducing agent, avoiding the use of any hydrophobic
   surfactants such as capping stabilizing substance. The obtained TeNTs
   decorated with Pt nanoparticles (TeNTs/PtNPs) have been fully
   characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM), selected area diffraction patterns (SAD), X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and cyclic voltammetry (CV). We
   demonstrated that the new material can be successfully employed in fuel
   cells, either as an anodic (for methanol oxidation reaction) or a
   cathodic (for oxygen reduction reaction) electrode, with high efficiency
   in terms of related mass activities and on-set improvement. Remarkably,
   the cell operates in aqueous electrolyte buffered at pH 7.0, thus,
   avoiding acidic or alkaline conditions that might lead to, for example,
   Pt dissolution (at low pH), and paving the way for the development of
   biocompatible devices and on-chip fuel cells.},

Title = {Farm productive contexts and the dynamics of bovine viral diarrhea (BVD)
   transmission},
Journal = {PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {165},
Pages = {23-33},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) is a viral disease that affects cattle and
   that is endemic to many European countries. It has a markedly negative
   impact on the economy, through reduced milk production, abortions, and a
   shorter lifespan of the infected animals. Cows becoming infected during
   gestation may give birth to Persistently Infected (PI) calves, which
   remain highly infective throughout their life, due to the lack of immune
   response to the virus. As a result, they are the key driver of the
   persistence of the disease both at herd scale, and at the national
   level. In the latter case, the trade-driven movements of PIs, or
   gestating cows carrying PIs, are responsible for the spatial dispersion
   of BVD. Past modeling approaches to BVD transmission have either focused
   on within-herd or between-herd transmission. A comprehensive portrayal,
   however, targeting both the generation of PIs within a herd, and their
   displacement throughout the country due to trade transactions, is still
   missing. We overcome this by designing a multiscale metapopulation model
   of the spatial transmission of BVD, accounting for both within herd
   infection dynamics, and its spatial dispersion. We focus on Italy, a
   country where BVD is endemic and seroprevalence is very high. By
   integrating simple within-herd dynamics of PI generation, and the
   highly-resolved cattle movement dataset available, our model requires
   minimal arbitrary assumptions on its parameterization. We use our model
   to study the role of the different productive contexts of the Italian
   market, and test possible intervention strategies aimed at prevalence
   reduction. We find that dairy farms are the main drivers of BVD
   persistence in Italy, and any control strategy targeting these farms
   would lead to significantly higher prevalence reduction, with respect to
   targeting other production compartments. Our multiscale metapopulation
   model is a simple yet effective tool for studying BVD dispersion and
   persistence at country level, and is a good instrument for testing
   targeted strategies aimed at the containment or elimination of this
   disease. Furthermore, it can readily be applied to any national market
   for which cattle movement data is available.},

Abstract = {The potential use of X-ray on Fiordilatte cheese was investigated. To
   the aim, some Fiordilatte brine packaged samples were subjected to X-ray
   treatment at 0.5, 2 and 3 kGy. Untreated control samples, as well as
   treated samples, were then stored at 9 +/- 1 degrees C. The results
   suggested that irradiated samples show a significant shelf life
   increase, compared to the untreated samples. The best performances were
   obtained at 2 and 3 kGy with a shelf life lasting a little more than 40
   days, while control samples remained only acceptable for about 10 days.
   Results highlighted that the evolution of both microbiological and
   sensory quality in control and irradiated samples was very different,
   thus justifying the longer shelf life of irradiated samples. Chemical
   analysis showed the presence of 2-dodecylcyclobutanone only in the
   treated samples, as it was already demonstrated to rely on the X-ray
   degradation of lipids. Moreover, the brine analysis of the same treated
   samples evidenced the presence of 1,3-bis (1,1 dimethylethyl) benzene as
   packaging degradation product. A more dynamic situation of various
   compounds appeared in the brine, being some of them increased and some
   other decreased after the X-ray treatments.},

Title = {Prevalence estimation of Italian ovine cystic echinococcosis in
   slaughterhouses: A retrospective Bayesian data analysis, 2010-2015},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a complex zoonosis with domestic and
   sylvatic life-cycles, involving different intermediate and definitive
   host species. Many previous studies have highlighted the lack of a
   surveillance system for CE, its persistence in Italy, and endemicity in
   several Italian regions. Because of the absence of a uniform
   surveillance program for both humans and animals, disease occurrence is
   widely underestimated. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of
   ovine CE in Italy. Survey data on the prevalence of Echinococcus
   granulosus complex infections in Italian sheep farms from 2010 to 2015
   were obtained in collaboration with Regional Veterinary Epidemiology
   Observatories (OEVRs). Bayesian analysis was performed to estimate the
   true CE farm prevalence. The prior true CE prevalence was estimated
   using data from Sardinia. Second, Bayesian modelling of the observed
   prevalence in different regions and the true prevalence estimation from
   the first step were used to ultimately estimate the prevalence of ovine
   CE in Italy. We obtained survey data from 10 OEVRs, covering 14 Italian
   regions. We observed that the risk of CE infection decreased over the
   years, and it was strictly correlated with the density of susceptible
   species. Using Sardinia as prior distribution, where the disease farm
   prevalence was approximately 19\% (95\% CI, 18.82-20.02), we estimated
   that the highest endemic CE farm prevalence was in Basilicata with a
   value of 12\% (95\% BCI: 7.49-18.9\%) and in Piemonte 7.64\%(95\% BCI:
   4.12-13.04\%). Our results provide spatially relevant data crucial for
   guiding CE control in Italy. Precise information on disease occurrence
   location would aid in the identification of priority areas for disease
   control implementation by the authorities. The current underestimation
   of CE occurrence should urge the Italian and European governments to
   become aware of the public health importance of CE and implement
   targeted interventions for high-risk areas.},

Abstract = {Escherichia coli 0157:H7 is a food-borne pathogen that can cause severe
   complications in vulnerable populations. Mouse infection models of E.
   coli 0157:H7 are usually developed under severe animal suffering
   classification by depleting the normal flora, in which age plays a role.
   Objective: To develop a refined method for longitudinal monitoring of E.
   coli 0157:H7 in young and old mice with intact flora.
   Methods: We applied discriminant analysis and computed composite
   standardized scores from 19 variables obtained from physiological
   parameters, analysis of locomotor activity, grip strength measurement
   and fecal shedding in 16 aged and 16 young C57BL/6 mice after two mild
   oral challenges of E. coli 0157:H7. The resulting scores were validated
   in another experiment performed in 24 aged and 24 young mice including a
   group (8 aged and 8 young mice) treated with oxytetracycline.
   Results:We show that our scores are significantly affected in the
   post-infection period and that can be used to measure and compare the
   recovery time after a treatment. The scores are most sensitive when
   separately developed in young and aged mice.
   Conclusions: We developed a method that minimizes the level of animal
   suffering and that can be applied in preclinical testing of new
   therapies.},

Abstract = {Livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
   (LA-MRSA) clones other than Clonal Complex (CC) 398, as CC1, have been
   isolated in pigs in some countries, and appeared to be prevalent in
   Italy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of Sequence
   Type (ST) 1, CC1, LA-MRSA clone to colonize and to be transmitted among
   piglets. Eighteen caesarean-derived/colostrum-deprived piglets of 35
   days of age were assigned randomly to three groups: four seeder piglets
   were contaminated with a spa type t127, ST1, SCCmec V, MRSA (Group A),
   10 MRSA-negative piglets were exposed to Group A after 2 days
   post-contamination, dpc (Group B) and 4 piglets were used as control
   group (Group C). Piglets were evaluated until 44 dpc (Group A) or at 42
   days post-exposure, dpe (Group B) and then euthanized and necropsied.
   All nasal and skin cultures of Group A resulted MRSA-positive throughout
   the experiment starting from two dpc, while Group C tested always
   MRSA-negative. At first sampling, all Group B piglets became positive
   and remained positive throughout the experiment. This is the first
   colonization/transmission study with a CC1 LA-MRSA in pigs. The results
   add further knowledge on the ability of CC1 LA-MRSA to colonize pigs,
   and on colonization/transmission patterns, both suggesting good host
   adaptation.},

Abstract = {Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 is the etiological agent of a severe disease
   of terrestrial carnivores. This unique specie encompasses canine
   parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) and feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV). Studies
   widely analyzed the main capsid protein (VP2), but limited information
   is available on the nonstructural genes (NS1/NS2). This paper analyzed
   the NS1 gene sequence of FPLV and CPV strains collected in Italy in
   2009-2017, along with worldwide related sequences. Differently from VP2,
   only one NS1 amino-acid residue (248) clearly and constantly
   distinguished FPLV from CPV-2, while five possible convergent amino-acid
   changes were observed that may affect the functional domains of the NS1.
   Some synonymous mutation in NS1 were non-synonymous in NS2 and vice
   versa. No evidence for recombination between the two lineages was found,
   and the predominance of negative selection pressure on NS1 proteins was
   observed, with low and no overlap between the two lineages in negatively
   and positively selected codons, respectively. More sites were under
   selection in the CPV-2 lineage. NS1 phylogenetic analysis showed
   divergent evolution between FPLV and CPV, and strains were clustered
   mostly by country and year of detection. We highlight the importance of
   obtaining the NS1/NS2 coding sequence in molecular epidemiology
   investigations.},

Abstract = {In 2016-2017, the H5N8 strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza
   (HPAI) spread worldwide and Uganda reported the first occurrence of the
   disease in its poultry and wild birds. Genetic analysis revealed that
   the virus clusters with 2.3.4.4 group B strains from birds in central
   and southern Asia, and thus forms part of the 2.3.4.4 group B Glade.
   Since Uganda is in the path of two major migratory bird flyways, it is
   likely that infected migratory wild birds played a crucial role in the
   introduction of H5N8 HPAI viruses into Uganda. The outbreaks happened in
   the districts of Wakiso, Masaka and Kalangala and affected domestic and
   wild birds. A One Health Multisectoral Coordination Committee,
   consisting of a National Task Force, Technical Working Groups and
   District Disaster Management Committees, was immediately activated to
   coordinate the preparedness and response efforts to control the disease.
   In all the affected districts, surveillance was intensified on both
   domestic and wild birds; biosecurity measures were increased; and
   movement controls, culling, cleaning, disinfection and safe disposal of
   carcasses were implemented. Awareness of the disease was raised through
   education materials, leaflets and brochures distributed to farmers.
   Finally, Uganda successfully controlled the H5N8 outbreak, using its
   national preparedness and response mechanisms and through collaboration
   with international partners. The emergence and spread of this virus
   strain in Uganda and other parts of Africa poses a significant threat to
   the poultry industry and food security.},

Abstract = {A 7-month-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel female was referred due to a
   chronic cough refractory to antibiotic treatments. Laboratory findings
   showed leukocytosis, increased serum C-reactive protein,
   hypogammaglobulinemia, and decreased total serum immunoglobulin G
   concentration. Thoracic radiographs showed a mild bronchial pattern.
   Cytology of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid revealed a septic
   inflammation. Bordetella bronchiseptica, Mycoplasma spp., and
   Pneumocystis carinii were identified by polymerase chain reaction
   testing, and Klebsiella pneumonia was cultured from the bronchoalveolar
   lavage fluid. Moreover, Escherichia coli was also cultured from urine.
   Pneumocystis spp. identification was done by sequencing of genetic
   amplicons. The dog died due to cardiopulmonary arrest secondary to a
   spontaneous pneumothorax on the day following the procedure. This report
   documents the detection of Pneumocystis carinii f. sp. canis in a
   suspected immunocompromised Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with
   concurrent pulmonary and urinary tract infections involving four
   different pathogens, and highlights the importance of the use of
   polymerase chain reaction testing to detect canine Pneumocystis spp. in
   cases with negative bronchoalveolar lavage cytology.},

Abstract = {Although the use of antimicrobial is not allowed in bee industry
   according to current EU legislation, antimicrobial residues are often
   detected in honey doomed to human consumption. This study aims to
   investigate if bees living in hives located nearby tanks filled with pig
   manure containing residues of oxytetracycline, would naturally harvest
   water from it, thus contaminating their honey. Data from this experiment
   were compared with those originating from direct contamination with
   oxytetracycline through the beehive feeders. Bees did not harvest water
   from manure, even during the warmest days of summer. Instead,
   antimicrobial residues were evidenced and quantified in honey from hives
   directly contaminated with oxytetracycline. Interestingly, antimicrobial
   residues were also observed in honey from untreated hives thus
   suggesting that illegal treatments can cause contamination, albeit at
   low levels, of honey produced in legally-untreated neighboring hives.},

Abstract = {The Italian National Reference Center for Echinococcosis (CeNRE,
   Sassari, Italy) set up a diagnostic protocol of one-step-PCR useful for
   the detection of E. granulosus sensu stricto (E.g.s.s.) and the
   identification of its genotype (G1-G3). The purpose of this work was to
   perform the validation of the PCR E.g.s.s. method. The procedures were
   performed employing the criteria of the World Organization for Animal
   Health as well as of the Italian Accreditation Body (ACCREDIA) based on
   the Regulation UNI CEI EN ISO/IEC 17025. Positive DNA samples belonging
   to E. granulosus, E. ortleppi, E. multilocularis, E. canadensis species
   were used for the experiments. Analytical specificity evidenced primer
   pairs Cal (Calreticulin l gene of 1001bp) with an specificity higher
   respect to Ef1 (Elongation-Factor 1 Alpha gene of 706bp) and NAD
   (Dehydrogenase-subunit 1 gene of 219bp). The analytical sensitivity
   presented the capability to detect a very low amount of parasite DNA
   corresponding to a concentration of 12.5pg/mu l; accuracy and precision
   related to the operator performance, along with repeatability and
   reproducibility, evidenced high concordance among results and
   demonstrated an excellent values of Cohen. According to the good
   performance related to the evaluated parameters, the method PCR E.g.s.s.
   was suitable for the validation procedure, and consequently, to be
   undergone to the accreditation process. In conclusion, the results
   demonstrated an elevated robustness and reliable features of the PCR
   E.g.s.s. able to perform a rapid diagnosis of E. granulosus in only one
   step, hence, it is likely to avoid the sequencing step.},

Title = {Validation of an immunoblot assay employing an objective reading system
   and used as a confirmatory test in equine infectious anaemia
   surveillance programs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VIROLOGICAL METHODS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {266},

Abstract = {Equine infectious anaemia (EIA) is a blood borne disease that is listed
   among the notifiable diseases of the World Organisation for Animal
   Health (OIE). EIA is also regulated by the OIE for the international
   trading provisions and is generally subject to control programmes. Since
   2011, Italy has been conducting a surveillance plan based on a
   three-tier diagnostic system, using a serological ELISA as screening
   test, an agar gel immunodiffusion test (AGIDT) as a confirmatory method,
   and an immunoblot (IB) as an alternative confirmatory assay for
   discordant results between the first two tests. As for the in-house
   competitive ELISA (c-ELISA) and the AGIDT, the Italian National
   Reference Laboratory for EIA (NRL) validated the IB according to the OIE
   guidelines, employing eight panels containing positive sera, including
   those from EIA virus (EIAV) proven infected horses, and negative horse,
   mule and donkey sera collected from different geographical areas. In
   addition, two international reference image panels were employed for the
   optimization and the validation of the digital image reading system
   adopted that allows an impartial measurement of the serum reactivity in
   the IB assay.
   The immunological reactivity to EIAV antigens, p26, gp45 and gp90
   adsorbed on the IB membrane, determines the serological status of the
   animal and for EIA, a p26 positive band together with at least one of
   the other antigen defines a subject as serologically positive for EIAV.
   For validation, the parameters assessed were threshold values,
   analytical and diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, repeatability and
   reproducibility. These parameters were evaluated for each antigen as
   well as in combination, according to the diagnostic algorithm
   established above.
   The validation data defined the IB as having a satisfactory sensitivity,
   specificity, repeatability and reproducibility for all antigens and
   species tested.
   An instrumental recording of the results improves the confidence in
   using IB as a confirmatory test for EIAV, differently from the AGIDT
   that is read by an operator.
   The advantages of using the IB are its higher sensitivity, to that of
   the AGIDT, which allows an earlier detection of infection that reduces
   the risk of transmission and therefore the incidence of the EIA, and its
   higher specificity to that of the ELISA which is based on the
   discrimination of subjects reacting only against the p26, the antigen
   used by all ELISAs available, which are not considered as infected by
   EIAV.
   In particular, when this assay is used in outbreaks it can detect new
   cases earlier than the AGIDT, and therefore reduce the restriction
   period with an economic benefit for the animal owners and the public
   veterinary sanitary system.},

Abstract = {In order to study the capability of a Bluetongue virus serotype 2
   (BTV-2) field isolate to cross the placental barrier, 2 groups of 5
   pregnant ewes were infected with a field BTV-2 Italian strain (Group A)
   or with the same strain passaged once in Culicoides cells (Kc) (Group
   B). Following infection, EDTA-blood and serum samples were collected
   weekly and tested for the presence of BTV RNA/infectious virus and
   anti-BTV-2 antibodies, respectively. At lambing, precolostral EDTA-blood
   and serum samples were collected from lambs and tested as before. The
   lambs were then sampled as scheduled for the dams. All sheep
   seroconverted on day 12 post-infection (pi) and remained seropositive
   throughout the sampling period (day 68 pi). BTV was isolated from day 7
   pi to day 14 pi in animals of Group A and from day 5 pi to day 12 pi in
   animals of Group B. None of the 14 lambs born had pre-colostral
   antibodies. Three lambs born from two ewes of Group B were viraemic at
   birth and in one lamb infectious virus was isolated from blood up to 11
   days of age.This study proved for the first time that a single passage
   of BTV-2 field strain in Kc cells is able to give to BTV the ability to
   cross the placenta barrier and infect foetal tissues.},

Abstract = {Objectives Previous studies in food-producing animals have shown
   associations between antimicrobial use (AMU) and resistance (AMR) in
   specifically isolated bacterial species. Multi-country data are scarce
   and only describe between-country differences. Here we investigate
   associations between the pig faecal mobile resistome and characteristics
   at the farm-level across Europe.
   Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 176 conventional pig
   farms from nine European countries. Twenty-five faecal samples from
   fattening pigs were pooled per farm and acquired resistomes were
   determined using shotgun metagenomics and the Resfinder reference
   database, i.e. the full collection of horizontally acquired AMR genes
   (ARGs). Normalized fragments resistance genes per kilobase reference per
   million bacterial fragments (FPKM) were calculated. Specific farm-level
   data (AMU, biosecurity) were collected. Random-effects meta-analyses
   were performed by country, relating farm-level data to relative ARG
   abundances (FPKM).
   Results Total AMU during fattening was positively associated with total
   ARG (total FPKM). Positive associations were particularly observed
   between widely used macrolides and tetracyclines, and ARGs corresponding
   to the respective antimicrobial classes. Significant AMU-ARG
   associations were not found for -lactams and only few colistin ARGs were
   found, despite high use of these antimicrobial classes in younger pigs.
   Increased internal biosecurity was directly related to higher abundances
   of ARGs mainly encoding macrolide resistance. These effects of
   biosecurity were independent of AMU in mutually adjusted models.
   Conclusions Using resistome data in association studies is unprecedented
   and adds accuracy and new insights to previously observed AMU-AMR
   associations. Major components of the pig resistome are positively and
   independently associated with on-farm AMU and biosecurity conditions.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND Peanuts and tree nut allergies pose an increasing food safety
   problem. The aim of our study was to test the accuracy of different
   commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits in the
   detection of the presence of walnuts in untreated and heat exposed food
   samples. The effects of thermal treatment of samples were evaluated by
   exposing walnuts to different heat treatments. All samples were first
   analysed by two different commercial ELISA assays. Then, we performed a
   skin prick test (SPT) on nine patients with proven nut allergy using
   small walnut pieces from raw and treated samples. RESULTS The presence
   of nuts proteins in thermally processed foods was not accurately
   detected by ELISA kits. All patients had a positive SPT reaction with
   raw walnut, while thermal treatments affected walnut allergenicity. The
   ELISA test gives a negative result in the case of strong thermal
   treatment, but at the same time allergic subjects react positively to
   stimulation with the same sample. CONCLUSION This study suggests that
   commercial ELISA kits may not be able to accurately determine the amount
   of proteins present in thermally processed foods due to changes in the
   solubility and immunoreactivity of the target proteins. Finally, the
   clinical results highlight that thermal treatment might induce a
   reduction in walnut allergenicity. (c) 2018 Society of Chemical Industry},

Abstract = {Salmonella enterica serovar 1,4,{[}5],12:i:- has emerged over the last
   two decades as one of the most common serovars causing human
   salmonellosis in Europe. It is supposed to originate from Salmonella
   enterica serovar Typhimurium due to antigenic and genotypic similarities
   between the two serovars. Due to the high level of similarity, the
   multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) protocol
   designed for Salmonella Typhimurium routine typing is commonly used also
   for the characterization of S. 1,4,{[}5],12:i. Nevertheless, the
   Salmonella Typhimurium-based MLVA protocol often shows poor
   discriminatory power for S. 1,4,{[}5],12:i. Indeed, only a limited
   number of MLVA profiles have been described for S. 1,4,{[}5],12:i:-.
   Moreover, based on the MLVA clustering, S. 1,4,{[}5],12:i:- is supposed
   to display high clonality. The aim of the present work was to assess
   whether the five loci of Salmonella Typhimurium investigated by MLVA are
   sufficiently accurate to correctly assign S. 1,4,{[}5],12:i:- isolates.
   For this purpose, 38 epidemiologically unrelated S. 1,4,{[}5],12:i:-
   were subjected to whole-genome sequencing. Isolates were selected among
   a collection of monophasic strains isolated in Italy from different
   sources over the period 2014-2016 and belonging to the five most
   commonly detected MLVA profiles. Results confirmed the possible
   clonality for S. 1,4,{[}5],12:i:- serovar in the light of the scarce
   difference observed in terms of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
   among investigated isolates. Nevertheless, unrelated isolates on the
   basis of the difference of SNP number were characterized as
   indistinguishable by MLVA profile, thus suggesting an insufficient
   resolution of MLVA. Hence, we can conclude that MLVA-based approach does
   not seem a valuable proxy to deepen into the epidemiological
   relationship among S. 1,4,{[}5],12:i:- isolates. These evidences can be
   useful to avoid incorrect assignment especially when surveillance data
   are used for outbreak investigations.},

Abstract = {Gastropods comprise nearly 60,000 species of aquatic as well as
   terrestrial mollusks, primarily snails and slugs. The giant African land
   snail (Achatina fulica) is one of the most popular pet snails worldwide.
   This gastropod mollusk is known as the intermediate host of several
   parasites that cause severe diseases in pets, free-ranging vertebrates,
   and humans. The aim of this survey was to investigate the occurrence of
   parasites in giant African land snails kept as pets in southern Italy.
   Fresh fecal samples were collected from a total of 60 giant African land
   snails kept in three private collections in Campania region (Italy). In
   addition, microscopic analysis of mucus and histological examination of
   biopsy samples from the foot muscle of 30 individual snails were
   performed. Coprological examination revealed the presence of rhabditid
   nematodes identified by both morphological and molecular assessment as
   Rhabditella axei in two out of three examined samples, and Rhabditis
   terricola, Cruznema sp., and Pristionchus entomophagus in one
   coprological sample. No parasites were detected in the muscle biopsy
   samples, or in the mucus. Due to the potential harm of rhabditid
   nematodes, their presence in giant African land snails potentially in
   contact with both pets and humans should not be disregarded.},

Title = {The invasive mosquito Aedes japonicus japonicus is spreading in
   northeastern Italy},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Month = {MAR 26},
Abstract = {Background: The invasive mosquito species, Aedes japonicus japonicus,
   was detected in northeastern Italy for the first time in 2015, at the
   border with Austria. After this finding, a more intensive monitoring was
   carried out to assess its distribution and to collect biological data.
   Herein, we report the results of four years (2015-2018) of activity.
   Methods: The presence of Ae. j. japonicus was checked in all possible
   breeding sites through collections of larvae. The monitoring started
   from the site of the first detection at the Austrian border and then was
   extended in all directions. The mosquitoes were identified
   morphologically and molecularly.
   Results: Aedes j. japonicus was found in 58 out of 73 municipalities
   monitored (79.5\%). In total (2015-2018), 238 sampling sites were
   monitored and 90 were positive for presence of Ae. j. japonicus larvae
   (37.8\%). The mosquito was collected mainly in artificial containers
   located in small villages and in rural areas. Cohabitation with other
   mosquito species was observed in 55.6\% of the samplings.
   Conclusions: Aedes j. japonicus is well established in Italy and in only
   four years has colonised two Italian Regions, displaying rapid spreading
   throughout hilly and mountainous areas. Colonization towards the south
   seems limited by climatic conditions and the occurrence of a large
   population of the larval competitor, Ae. albopictus. The further spread
   of Ae. j. japonicus has the potential to pose new threats of zoonotic
   agents (i.e. Dirofilaria spp. and West Nile virus) within areas at
   altitudes previously considered at negligible risk in Italy.},

Title = {Leishmania infantum-specific IFN-gamma production in stimulated blood
   from cats living in areas where canine leishmaniosis is endemic},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},

Abstract = {Background: Feline leishmaniosis caused by Leishmania infantum is
   considered a rare disease in endemic areas, whereas subclinical
   infections are common. Immune response plays a key role in driving the
   course of L. infantum infection in other host species; however, the
   feline cell-mediated immune response to L. infantum infection has not
   yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the
   cell-mediated immune response specific to L. in fanturn by means of
   interferon (IFN)-gamma release in whole blood assay from cats living in
   endemic areas (66 in Sicily and 113 in Catalonia) and to compare with
   antibody levels to L. infantum {[}enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   (ELISA) and immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT)], blood parasite
   load and retroviral infections.
   Results: Most cats (n= 140) were L. infantum antibody negative and only
   22\% (n = 39) were positive. Only 9 and 2\% of tested cats had a feline
   immunodeficency virus (FIV) infection or a feline leukemia virus (FeLV)
   infection, respectively. Thirty-two cats out of 179 (18\%) produced
   IFN-gamma after stimulation with L. infantum soluble antigen (LSA) while
   the majority of cats (93\%) produced IFN-gamma after stimulation with
   concanavalin A (ConA). Six LSA-IFN-y-producer cats were seropositive
   (three to ELISA and five to IFAT) but they were polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) negative, while only one cat was antibody- and
   PCR-positive. Significant positive correlations were found between
   IFN-gamma concentrations after stimulation with LSA and ConA, and
   between serology and PCR testing. No association was found between FIV
   status and LSA or ConA-IFN-gamma production. Combining PCR, serology and
   specific IFN-gamma concentration results, we found that 36\% of cats
   studied were exposed to L. infantum.
   Conclusions: As expected, cats from endemic areas produce IFN-gamma
   after ex vivo blood stimulation with LSA and therefore are able to
   activate a cell-mediated adaptive immune response against the parasite
   that is variably associated with antibody or blood PCR positivity. The
   association of this assay to serological and molecular tests provides a
   better estimate of cat exposure to L. infantum.},

Abstract = {Brucellosis is a major public health problem still prevalent as a
   neglected endemic zoonosis requiring proactive attention in many
   communities worldwide. The present study involved analysis of Brucella
   field strains submitted for typing to the Italian National Reference
   Laboratory for Brucellosis from 2007 to 2015. Strains were identified at
   the species and biovar levels by classic and molecular techniques
   according to the World Organisation for Animal Health Manual. In total,
   5,784 strains were typed: 3,089 Brucella abortus (53.4\%), 2,497 B.
   melitensis (43.2\%), 10 B. ovis (0.2\%), 181 B. suis (3.1\%), and 7 B.
   ceti (0.1\%). The 2,981 strains from cattle were typed as B. abortus
   biovars 1, 3, and 6 (90.1\%) and B. melitensis biovar 3 (9.9\%). The 318
   strains from water buffalo were typed as B. abortus biovars 1, 3
   (95.9\%) and B. melitensis biovar 3 (4.1\%). The 2,279 strains from
   sheep and goats were typed as B. abortus biovars 1 and 3 (4.3\%); B.
   melitensis biovars 1, 3, (95.3\%); and B. ovis (0.4\%). The 173 strains
   from wild boar were typed as B. suis biovar 2 (98.3\%) and B. melitensis
   biovar 3 (1.7\%). The 11 strains from pigs were typed as B. suis biovar
   2. The 13 strains from humans were typed as B. melitensis biovar 3. The
   two strains from horses were typed as B. abortus biovar 1, while the
   seven strains from dolphins were typed as B. ceti. This additional
   knowledge on the epidemiology of brucellosis in Italy may be useful to
   formulate policies and strategies for the control and eradication of the
   disease in animal populations. The animal species affected, biovars
   typed, geographical origins, and spatial distributions of isolates are
   herein analyzed and discussed.},

Title = {Comparative histopathologic and viral immunohistochemical studies on

Abstract = {Cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV) is a major natural cause of morbidity and
   mortality in ceta-ceans worldwide and results in epidemic and endemic
   fatalities. The pathogenesis of CeMV has not been fully elucidated, and
   questions remain regarding tissue tropism and the mechanisms of
   immunosuppression. We compared the histopathologic and viral
   immunohistochemical features in molecularly confirmed CeMV-infected
   Guiana dolphins (Sotalia guianensis) from the Southwestern Atlantic
   (Brazil) and striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) and bottlenose
   dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from the Northeast-Central Atlantic
   (Canary Islands, Spain) and the Western Mediterranean Sea (Italy). Major
   emphasis was placed on the central nervous system (CNS), including
   neuroanatomical distribution of lesions, and the lymphoid system and
   lung were also examined. Eleven Guiana dolphins, 13 striped dolphins,
   and 3 bottlenose dolphins were selected by defined criteria. CeMV
   infections showed a remarkable neurotropism in striped dolphins and
   bottlenose dolphins, while this was a rare feature in CeMV-infected
   Guiana dolphins. Neuroanatomical distribution of lesions in dolphins
   stranded in the Canary Islands revealed a consistent involvement of the
   cerebrum, thalamus, and cerebellum, followed by caudal brainstem and
   spinal cord. In most cases, Guiana dolphins had more severe lung
   lesions. The lymphoid system was involved in all three species, with
   consistent lymphoid depletion. Multinucleate giant cells/syncytia and
   characteristic viral inclusion bodies were variably observed in these
   organs. Overall, there was widespread lymphohistiocytic, epithelial, and
   neuronal/neuroglial viral antigen immunolabeling with some individual,
   host species, and CeMV strain differences. Preexisting and opportunistic
   infections were common, particularly endoparasitism, followed by
   bacterial, fungal, and viral infections. These results contribute to
   understanding CeMV infections in susceptible cetacean hosts in relation
   to factors such as CeMV strains and geographic locations, thereby
   establishing the basis for future neuro- and immunopathological
   comparative investigations.},

Title = {Comparative Immunopathology of Cetacean morbillivirus Infection in
   Free-Ranging Dolphins From Western Mediterranean, Northeast-Central, and
   Southwestern Atlantic},

Abstract = {Cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV; Paramyxoviridae) causes epizootic and
   interepizootic fatalities in odontocetes and mysticetes worldwide.
   Studies suggest there is different species-specific susceptibility to
   CeMV infection, with striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba),
   bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), and Guiana dolphins (Sotalia
   guianensis) ranking among the most susceptible cetacean hosts. The
   pathogenesis of CeMV infection is not fully resolved. Since no previous
   studies have evaluated the organ-specific immunopathogenetic features of
   CeMV infection in tissues from infected dolphins, this study was aimed
   at characterizing and comparing immunophenotypic profiles of local
   immune responses in lymphoid organs (lymph nodes, spleen), lung and CNS
   in CeMV-molecularly (RT-PCR)-positive cetaceans from Western
   Mediterranean, Northeast-Central, and Southwestern Atlantic.
   Immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses targeted molecules of immunologic
   interest: caspase 3, CD3, CD20, CD57, CD68, FoxP3, MHCII, Iba1 , IFN
   gamma, IgG, IL4, IL10, lysozyme, TGF beta, and PAX5. We detected
   consistent CeMV-associated inflammatory response patterns. Within CNS,
   inflammation was dominated by CD3(+ )(T cells), and CD20(+) and PAX5(+
   )(B cells) lymphocytes, accompanied by fewer lba1(+), CD68(+), and
   lysozyme+ histiocytes, mainly in striped dolphins and bottlenose
   dolphins. Multicentric lymphoid depletion was characterized by reduced
   numbers of T cells and B cells, more pronounced in Guiana dolphins.
   Striped dolphins and bottlenose dolphins often had hyperplastic
   (regenerative) phenomena involving the aforementioned cell populations,
   particularly chronically infected animals. In the lung, there was mild
   to moderate increase in T cells, B cells, and histiocytes. Additionally,
   there was a generalized increased expression of caspase 3 in lymphoid,
   lung, and CNS tissues. Apoptosis, therefore, is believed to play a major
   role in generalized lymphoid depletion and likely overt
   immunosuppression during CeMV infection. No differences were detected
   regarding cytokine immunoreactivity in lymph nodes, spleen, and lung
   from infected and non-infected dolphins by semiquantitative analysis;
   however, there was striking immunoreactivity for IFN gamma in the CNS of
   infected dolphins. These novel results set the basis for tissue-specific
   immunophenotypic responses during CeMV infection in three highly
   susceptible delphinid species. They also suggest a complex interplay
   between viral and host's immune factors, thereby contributing to gain
   valuable insights into similarities, and differences of CeMV infection's
   immunopathogenesis in relation to body tissues, CeMV strains, and
   cetacean hosts.},

Title = {Estimation of Performance Characteristics of Analytical Methods for
   Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis Detection in Dairy Products},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Paratuberculosis is a chronic enteric infection, caused by Mycobacterium
   avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), affecting virtually all ruminants
   as well as other animals. MAP is also suspected to be involved in the
   etiology of some human diseases, like Crohn's disease and others. In
   surveillance studies, different analytical methodologies were employed
   to detect MAP, showing different results and incidence in dairy
   products. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance
   characteristics of three analytical methods {[}culture, quantitative PCR
   (qPCR) and peptide-mediated magnetic separation (PMS) phage-based assay]
   for MAP detection in raw, heat-treated and powdered milk. The methods
   were evaluated according to performance characteristics defined for
   qualitative methods in ISO 16140-2:2016. To estimate sensitivity
   (including trueness) and LOD, 720, and 900 test portions, respectively,
   were blind tested by two laboratories. Considering all matrices,
   different sensitivities, expressed as the percentage of positives from
   the total of true positive test portions, were obtained for IS900 qPCR
   (94\%), f57 qPCR (76\%), culture (83\%), and PMS-phage (40\%). Trueness,
   expressed as results correctly assigned (including positive and
   negative) to the reference value, was 93\% for the IS900 qPCR method,
   89\% for culture and 49\% for the PMS-phage. The LODs obtained in this
   study were similar to the LODs previously published for cultural and
   qPCR methods. However, for the PMS-phage method, the obtained results
   showed higher LOD values compared to the limited data available in the
   scientific literature. Our results highlight that while the PMS-phage
   assay is workable in pure liquid culture for estimation of MAP counts,
   its usage for surveillance of dairy matrices should be treated with a
   lot of caution as performance characteristics obtained were lower than
   for the two other methods tested. qPCR and culture are the most
   appropriate methods to detect MAP in milk-based matrices according to
   ISO 16140 methodology. Cultural techniques are considered the gold
   standard for detection of viable MAP, but qPCR, which is widely used in
   analytical and surveillance studies, can be considered a suitable and
   recommendable alternative to cultural methods for screening, if
   confirmation of MAP'S viability is not requested.},

Abstract = {BackgroundTroglostrongylus brevior, a lungworm usually affecting wild
   felids, has been recently recorded in a number of cases in domestic
   cats, mainly in Mediterranean areas. Although feline troglostrongylosis
   is a severe and life-threatening disease, especially in young cats,
   treatment options are very limited. The present study evaluated the
   efficacy and safety of a spot-on formulation containing emodepside 2.1\%
   and praziquantel 8.6\% (Profender((R)), Bayer), which is licensed for
   treatment of the more common cat lungworm Aelurostrongylus abstrusus,
   for the treatment of natural troglostrongylosis.MethodsSixteen cats
   enrolled in the study were 1:1 allocated to two groups, i.e. Group T,
   treated with Profender((R)) spot-on on days 0 and 14 (2) at the
   recommended clinical dose, and Group C which remained untreated. After
   study completion, the control cats received two rescue treatments with
   Profender((R)) on days 28 (2) and 42 (+/- 2). The primary efficacy
   criterion was the absence of T. brevior L1 following treatment. Other
   efficacy parameters were the quantitative comparison of L1 presence
   before (baseline) and after treatment in both groups, and the comparison
   of clinical signs pre- and post-treatment.Results p id=Par3 In terms of
   stopping larval shedding, Profender((R)) showed an efficacy of 97\% and
   97.5\% (arithmetic and geometric means, respectively) for group T,
   97.1\% and 98.5\% for group C after one administration, and 100\% for
   both groups after two doses. Overall, 12 cats showed clinical signs
   related to T. brevior. Specifically, 9 were clinically affected before
   treatment while clinical signs appeared after the first treatment in 3
   cats. At the end of the study, all symptomatic cats fully recovered with
   the exception of 3 cats that showed clinical signs similar to those
   observed at the pre-treatment examination at the end of the
   study.Conclusions<This study shows that Profender((R)) is effective
   against T. brevior.},

Abstract = {Information on the population dynamics of a reservoir species have been
   increasingly adopted to understand and eventually predict the dispersal
   patterns of infectious diseases throughout an area. Although potentially
   relevant, to date there are no studies which have investigated the
   genetic structure of the red fox population in relation to infectious
   disease dynamics. Therefore, we genetically and spatially characterised
   the red fox population in the area stretching between the Eastern and
   Dinaric Alps, which has been affected by both distemper and rabies at
   different time intervals. Red foxes collected from north-eastern Italy,
   Austria, Slovenia and Croatia between 2006-2012, were studied using a
   set of 21 microsatellite markers. We confirmed a weak genetic
   differentiation within the fox population using Bayesian clustering
   analyses, and we were able to differentiate the fox population into
   geographically segregated groups. Our finding might be due to the
   presence of geographical barriers that have likely influenced the
   distribution of the fox population, limiting in turn gene flow and
   spread of infectious diseases. Focusing on the Italian red fox
   population, we observed interesting variations in the prevalence of both
   diseases among distinct fox clusters, with the previously identified
   Italy 1 and Italy 2 rabies as well as distemper viruses preferentially
   affecting different sub-groups identified in the study. Knowledge of the
   regional-scale population structure can improve understanding of the
   epidemiology and spread of diseases. Our study paves the way for an
   integrated approach for disease control coupling pathogen, host and
   environmental data to inform targeted control programs in the future.},

Title = {In vitro and ex vivo evaluation of the anti-Giardia duodenalis activity
   of the supernatant of Slab51 (SivoMixx)},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 7},
Abstract = {The effects on Giardia duodenalis of Slab51 probiotic supernatants were
   evaluated in vitro and ex vivo. In vitro, Slab51 (10(1) UFC) was
   cultured and the obtained supernatant was filtered, adjusted at pH 7,
   and added (100 mu l/ml) as such (Slab51 FS) or after heat-treatment, to
   G. duodenalis cultures to evaluate its effects on G. duodenalis
   trophozoites growth and adherence. For comparison, negative and
   metronidazole (20 mu g/ml) treated controls were used. The morphological
   and ultrastructural alterations of G. duodenalstrophozoites following
   treatment with Slab51 FS supernatant were investigated by transmission
   electron microscopy. Ex vivo, mice duodenal portions were cultivated in
   standard conditions with 5x10(5) G. duodenalistrophozoites/ml, while to
   further five duodenal portions similarly cultured and infected, Slab51
   FS 200p1 was added. After 12 and 18h, samples were fixed in 10\%
   buffered formalin and histologically processed to score Giardia
   infection and cell damage. Cell proliferation/apoptosis was scored by
   Ki67, TUNEL and Caspase-3 tests. All experiments were conducted in
   triplicate throughout the study. All data were statistically evaluated
   (P< 0.05). Results showed that Slab51 FS significantly reduced Giardia
   growth and adherence respect to negative controls, but its efficacy was
   overall lower than that of metronidazole. Moreover, the effects of
   Slab51 FS were significantly lowered by heat-treatment and this
   reduction was statistically higher at 90 degrees C than at 56 degrees C,
   indicating a heat-sensitive nature of active Slab51 FS compounds. At the
   ultrastructural level, Slab51 FS treated Giardia trophozoites were
   swelling, increased in size and showed alterations of their cellular
   membrane and vacuole patterns, loss of the nuclear envelope and nuclear
   architecture. In ex vivo trials, viable G. duodenalis trophozoites and
   enterocyte TUNEL+ and Caspase-3 expression were significantly reduced in
   intestinal sections added with Slab51 FS, while enterocyte Ki67
   expression was significantly increased, confirming the anti-G.
   duodenalis activity of Slab51 FS observed in vitro. In conclusion,
   results from this study showed that the fresh culture supernatant of the
   commercial probiotic Slab51 has anti-G. duodenalis properties both in
   vitro and ex vivo in a mouse model.},

Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {The health benefits of nuts, mainly in relation to the improvement of
   dysmetabolic conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and
   the related cardiovascular diseases, have been widely demonstrated.
   Compared to other nuts, pistachios have a lower fat and caloric content,
   and contain the highest levels of unsaturated fatty acids, potassium,
   gamma-tocopherol, phytosterols and xanthophyll carotenoids, all
   substances that are well known for their antioxidant and
   anti-inflammatory actions. This variety of nutrients contributes to the
   growing body of evidence that the consumption of pistachios improves
   health, leading to a greater potential of healthy antioxidant and
   anti-inflammatory activity, glycemic control, and endothelial function.
   The present review examines the nutrients and phytochemicals present in
   pistachios as well as the potential health benefits of including
   pistachios in a diet.

Title = {Prevalence of anisakid parasites in fish collected from Apulia region
   (Italy) and quantification of nematode larvae in flesh},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {292},
Pages = {159-170},
Month = {MAR 2},
Abstract = {Anisakis spp. and Hysterothylacium spp. are nematodes that commonly
   parasitize several fish species. Nematode larvae can be recovered in
   coelomic cavity and viscera, but also in flesh and have an important
   economic and public health impact. A total of 1144 subjects of wild
   teleosts, 340 samples of cephalopods and 128 specimens of farmed fish
   collected from Apulia region were analysed for anisakid larvae detection
   by visual inspection of coelomic cavity and viscera and by digestion of
   the flesh. No nematode larvae were found in farmed fish and cephalopod
   molluscs. All examined wild-caught fish species were parasitized, except
   for 5 species for each of which only a few subjects belonging to the
   same batch were sampled, therefore the results are just indicative. A
   total of 6153 larvae were isolated; among these, 271 larvae were found
   in the muscular portion. Larvae were identified by morphological method
   as belonging to the genera Anisakis (97.2\%) (type I and type II) and
   Hysterothylacium (2.8\%). Both nematodes could be found in all fish
   species, except for round sardinella (Sardinella aurita), infected only
   by Hysterothylacium spp. and for Mediterranean scaldfish (Arnoglossus
   laterna), little tunny (Euthynnus alleteratus) and chub mackerel
   (Scomber japonicus) infected only with Anisakis spp.. A sample of 185
   larvae was sent to the National Reference Centre for Anisakiasis
   (C.Re.N.A.) of Sicily for identification at the species level: 180
   larvae belonged to the species A. pegreffii and 2 larvae to A.
   physeteris. The remaining 3 larvae were identified at genus level as
   Hysterothylacium. Statistical indices such as prevalence, mean intensity
   and mean abundance were calculated. Chub mackerel (S. japonicus) was the
   species with the highest prevalence and mean intensity. Moreover, the
   average and the median values of larvae per 100 g of edible part for
   each fish species were determined to estimate the consumer exposure to
   Anisakis spp.. The obtained values were then recalculated by referring
   to the edible part of all specimens (infected and non-infected) forming
   a single parasitized batch, getting more realistic and objective data
   useful for risk assessment. Our results indicate that the consumption of
   raw or undercooked wild fish caught off Apulian coasts could result in
   the acquisition of anisakiasis; on the contrary, farmed fish and
   cephalopods appear to be safer for the consumer.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Objective: To study the molecular features of mesenchymal stem cells
   from Wharton Jelly (WJ-MSCs) of umbilical cord to predict their
   differentiation capacity.
   Design: Comparison of gene expression from mesenchymal stem cells of
   male and female umbilical cord
   Setting: University hospital
   Patient (s): umbilical cords (n = 12, 6 males and 6 females) retrieved
   from spontaneous full-term vaginal delivery of healthy women
   Intervention: we analyzed the expression of the sternness related genes
   C-MYC, OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG and of the epigenetic modulating gene
   DNA-methyltransferase 1 (DNMTI).
   Mean outcome measure: WJ-MSCs were isolated by standard procedures and
   immunophenotypically characterized. Gene expression analysis of
   sternness related genes and the epigenetic modulating gene DNMTI were
   performed by real-time PCR
   Results: expression of the OCT4 and DNMTI genes was significantly higher
   in WJ- MSCs isolated from male subjects, as compared to MSCs isolated
   from female-derived WJ. The resulting higher expression of OCT4 and
   DNMTI in WJ-MSCs from males as compared with female WJ-MSCs for the
   first time identifies a specific relationship between sternness genes,
   an epigenetic modulator, and gender differences.
   Conclusion: our findings disclose novel biomedical implications in
   WJ-MSCs related to the sex of the donor, thus providing additional cues
   to exploit their regenerative potential in allogenic transplantation.

Abstract = {Berries have repeatedly been associated with outbreaks of hepatitis A
   virus (HAV) infection. The fruits are usually minimally processed in the
   food industry due to their delicate nature. While washing treatments
   partially remove enteric viruses, the commonly used chemical additives
   produce toxic by-products. A valid alternative to preserve the food
   safety of these products could be the use of essential oils (EOs). EOs
   exert antimicrobial activity and do not interfere with the nutritional
   characteristics of food products. We investigated the efficacy of four
   essential oils, lemon (Citrus limon), sweet orange (Citrus sinensis),
   grapefruit (Citrus paradisi), and rosemary cineole (Rosmarinus
   officinalis chemotype 1.8 cineole) in reducing viral loads of HAV in
   soft fruits. Mixed fruit berries were inoculated with 10(6.74) TCID50/ml
   of HAV, and treated with four different EOs (0.5\% lemon, 0.1\% sweet
   orange and grapefruit, and 0.05\% rosemary) for 1 h at room temperature.
   Virus infectivity was then assessed by titration assays for its ability
   to grow on cell cultures. A statistically significant reduction in HAV
   titer on the fruit surface was observed after treating the berries with
   EOs of lemon (2.84 log TCID50/ml), grapefruit (2.89 log TCID50/ml), and
   rosemary cineole (2.94 log TCID50/ml). Rosemary cineole was the most
   effective EO in reducing viral titer on berries, followed by grapefruit
   EO. These results improve our knowledge about the antiviral activity of
   these EOs and highlight their potential use in fresh produce sanitation.},

Abstract = {Mammalian orthoreoviruses (MRV) type 3 have been recently identified in
   human and several animal hosts, highlighting the apparent lack of
   species barriers. Here we report the identification and genetic
   characterization of MRVs strains in alpine chamois, one of the most
   abundant wild ungulate in the Alps. Serological survey was also
   performed by MRV neutralization test in chamois population during five
   consecutive years (2008-2012). Three novel MRVs were isolated on cell
   culture from chamois lung tissues. No respiratory or other clinical
   symptoms neither lung macroscopic lesions were observed in the chamois
   population. MRV strains were classified as MRV-3 within the lineage III,
   based on S1 phylogeny, and were closely related to Italian strains
   identified in dog, bat and diarrheic pig. The full genome sequence was
   obtained by next-generation sequencing and phylogenetic analyses showed
   that other segments were more similar to MRVs of different geographic
   locations, serotypes and hosts, including human, highlighting genome
   reassortment and lack of host specific barriers. By using serum
   neutralization test, a high prevalence of MRV-3 antibodies was observed
   in chamois population throughout the monitored period, showing an
   endemic level of infection and suggesting a self-maintenance of MRV
   and/or a continuous spill-over of infection from other animal species.},

Title = {Pathogenicity and Full Genome Sequencing of the Avian Influenza H9N2

Abstract = {In Morocco in early 2016, a low pathogenic avian influenza virus
   serotype H9N2 caused large economic losses to the poultry industry, with
   specific clinical symptoms and high mortality rates on infected farms.
   Subsequent to the H9N2 outbreak, the causal agent was successfully
   isolated from chicken flocks with high morbidity and mortality rates,
   propagated on embryonated eggs, and fully sequenced. The phylogenetic
   analysis suggested that the Moroccan isolate could have derived from the
   Middle East isolate A/chicken/Dubai/D2506. A/2015. This study was
   designed to assess the pathogenicity of the Moroccan isolate H9N2 in
   experimentally infected broiler and specific-pathogen-free (SPF)
   chickens. At 22 days of age, one broiler and two SPF chicken groups were
   inoculated by dropping 0.2 ml of the H9N2 isolate (10(7.5) EID50/ml) in
   both nostrils and eyes. Clinically inoculated chickens with H9N2
   displayed mild lesions, low mortality rates, and an absence of clinical
   signs. The H9N2 virus was more pathogenic in broiler chickens and
   produced more severe tissue lesions compared to SPF chickens. The viral
   shedding was detected up to 6 days postinoculation (pi) in oropharyngeal
   and cloacal swabs in infected birds with a maximum shedding in the
   oropharynges of the broiler group. All experimental chickens
   seroconverted and registered high hemagglutination inhibition titers as
   early as day 7 pi. The present study indicates that the H9N2 virus
   isolated from a natural outbreak was of low pathogenicity under
   experimental conditions. However, under field conditions infection with
   other pathogens might have aggravated the disease.},

Abstract = {We compared results of a serum immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and lymph
   node quantitative PCR (qPCR) in dogs classified as exposed, infected, or
   sick because of leishmaniasis. We also determined how IFA or qPCR
   results changed in response to treatment and reflected different
   clinical and clinicopathologic improvement of dogs. We included 108 dogs
   in our retrospective study: 12 exposed, 25 infected, and 71 sick, as
   classified according to Canine Leishmaniasis Working Group standards.
   Between-group comparison showed higher IFA values (p < 0.01) for sick
   dogs; qPCR values were higher for sick than infected dogs (p < 0.01). A
   novel clinical and clinicopathologic score was created and applied to 50
   sick dogs. Using this score, 41 were reclassified as partially recovered
   (PR) within 3 mo, and 37 as totally recovered (TR) 3-6 mo after
   presentation. Statistically significant differences in IFA values were
   found between the sick and TR dogs (p < 0.01), but not between sick and
   PR dogs (p = 0.98). During follow-up, qPCR revealed a progressive
   decrease in parasite load, with a statistically significant difference
   in sick versus PR (p < 0.01), sick versus TR (p < 0.01), and PR versus
   TR (p < 0.01) dogs. A decrease of 1 point in the clinical score
   corresponded to 1.3 Leishmania/mu L qPCR decrease (p < 0.01) and
   decrease of 1:42 in IFA (p < 0.01). Our findings confirm that the
   clinical status of dogs affected by leishmaniasis is closely related to
   parasite load and antibody level, both before and after treatment.},

Title = {Exosome secretion by Leishmania infantum modulate the chemotactic
   behavior and cytokinic expression creating an environment permissive for
   early infection},
Journal = {EXPERIMENTAL PARASITOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {198},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In recent years, several studies demonstrated the role of exosomes in
   intercellular communications, several Leishmania species belonging to
   subgenera Leishmania and Viannia have been demonstrated to release
   exosomes, and their role in parasite-macrophage interactions and in
   leishmaniasis development has been investigated. However, the release of
   exosomes by Leishmania infant an has not been studied sa far. The aim of
   this study was to isolate and characterize L. infantum exosomes, and to
   investigate the biological activity of these exosomes in macrophage
   cultures. To this end, exosomes were collected from both amastigote and
   promastigote L. infantum conditioned medium by ultracentrifugation.
   Exosomes were then characterized by monitoring the presence of HSP70,
   HSP83/90 and acetylcholinesterase activity. Moreover, extracellular
   vesicles-tracking analysis revealed that promastigote and amastigote
   exosomes had mean diameter of 122 +/- 56 nm and 115 +/- 65 nm,
   respectively. Human monocytic cell line U937-derived macrophages treated
   with promastigote and amastigote exosomes showed an increase in motility
   and an overproduction of interleukin IL-10 and IL-18 reduction, involved
   in immune response. Since L. infantum exosomes demonstrated the capacity
   to modulate the chemotactic behaviour of the cells studied and cytokines
   production, they could contribute in the disease establishment and may
   be considered an appropriate candidate for a vaccine therapy in
   prophylaxis and treatment.},

Abstract = {Due to the limited number of available antibiotics, antimicrobial
   peptides (AMPs) are considered antimicrobial candidates to fight
   difficult-to-treat infections such as those associated with biofilms.
   Marine environments are precious sources of AMPs, as shown by the recent
   discovery of antibiofilm properties of Holothuroidin 2 (H2), an AMP
   produced by the Mediterranean sea cucumber Holothuria tubulosa. In this
   study, we considered the properties of a new H2 derivative, named H2d,
   and we tested it against seven strains of the dangerous foodborne
   pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. This peptide was more active than H2 in
   inhibiting the growth of planktonic L. monocytogenes and was able to
   interfere with biofilm formation at sub-minimum inhibitory
   concentrations (MICs). Atomic-level molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
   revealed insights related to the enhanced inhibitory activity of H2d,
   showing that the peptide is characterized by a more defined tertiary
   structure with respect to its ancestor. This allows the peptide to
   better exhibit an amphipathic character, which is an essential
   requirement for the interaction with cell membranes, similarly to other
   AMPs. Altogether, these results support the potential use of our
   synthetic peptide, H2d, as a template for the development of novel
   AMP-based drugs able to fight foodborne that are resistant to
   conventional antibiotics.},

Abstract = {African swine fever (ASF) is a contagious viral disease of wild and
   domestic pigs that is present in many parts of Africa, Asia and Europe,
   including Sardinia (Italy). Deletions in the EP402R and B602L genes have
   been found in almost all ASF virus (ASFV) strains circulating in
   Sardinia from 1990 onwards, and modern Sardinian strains (isolated after
   1990) might have acquired some selective advantage compared to
   historical ones (isolated before 1990). Here, we analysed the host cell
   responses of wild boars and domestic pigs upon infection with virus
   variants. Higher intracellular levels of the late protein p72 were
   detected after infection with the modern strain 22653/14 compared to the
   historical strain Nu81.2, although both isolates grew at the same rate
   in both monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages. Higher cytokine
   levels in the supernatants of ASFV-infected pig monocytes compared to
   pig macrophages and wild-boar cells were detected, with no differences
   between isolates.},

Abstract = {The authors investigated the arsenic (As) accumulation in different
   tissues (muscle, gill, liver, stomach, and intestine) and the possible
   correlation between tissue concentration and hematological parameters in
   mullet (Mugil cephalus Linnaeus, 1758) caught in Faro Lake (Messina,
   Sicily, Italy). On all fish, hematological analyses of blood samples,
   measurement of biometric indices, and the removal of the muscles, gills,
   liver, stomach, and intestine for the determination of arsenic
   concentration were performed. A hemogram was performed to find effects
   of arsenic concentration in tissues on hematological variables. One-way
   analysis of variance showed significant differences of arsenic
   concentration in different tissues, with higher values in the gill. The
   correlation between hematological parameters and tissue arsenic
   concentration showed a statistical significance for red blood cell
   (RBC), hemoglobin concentration (Hb), and hematocrit (Hct) with the
   liver As concentration. Biometric indices (weight, length, and fork
   length) showed a significant correlation with As concentration of the
   muscle and liver also. Our results indicate the role of some
   hematological parameters as biomarkers useful to monitoring
   anthropogenic load of arsenic in water and sediment, because variations
   of these parameters represent one of the effects that arsenic exposure
   can have on fish.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the presence of five
   neonicotinoid pesticides, acetamiprid, imidacloprid, clothianidin,
   thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam, in sheep and cow milk samples collected
   from animals bred in the Jordan Valley. In this area, numerous citrus
   plantations are present, and these insecticides are commonly used to
   protect plants from pests and diseases. Thirty-seven sheep milk samples
   and 31 cow milk samples were analysed. The analytical method, based on a
   single cleanup extraction step with SPE cartridges packed with
   diatomaceous earth material, together with analysis by LC-MS/MS, has
   guaranteed average recoveries between 75.1\% and 88.3\%, limits of
   detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of 0.5 and 1 mu g/kg,
   respectively, for all the five neonicotinoids. LOQ was much lower than
   the codex maximum residues limits for these pesticides in milks. No
   residues of the five neonicotinoids were found in any sample at a
   concentration level above LOD.},

Title = {Study of the underlying mechanisms and consequences of pathogenicity
   differences between two in vitro selected G1-H9N2 clones originating
   from a single isolate},
Journal = {VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {50},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {The G1-H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV) has caused significant economic
   losses in the commercial poultry industry due to reduced egg production
   and increased mortality. The field observations have shown that H9N2
   viruses circulate and naturally mix with other pathogens and these
   simultaneous infections can exacerbate disease. To avoid an incorrect
   virus characterization, due to co-infection, isolates were purified by
   in vitro plaque assays. Two plaque purified G1-H9N2 clones, selected on
   different cell types, named MDCK-and CEF-clone in regards to the cell
   culture used, were studied in vivo, revealing two different virulence
   phenotypes. Subsequently, the underlying mechanisms were studied.
   Specifically, the phenotypical outcome of SPF bird infection by the two
   clones resulted in completely different clinical outcomes. These
   differences in clinical outcome were used to study the factors behind
   this output in more detail. Further studies demonstrated that the more
   severe disease outcome associated with the MDCK-clone involves a strong
   induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a lack of type I interferon
   production, whereas the mild disease outcome associated with the
   CEF-clone is related to a greater antiviral cytokine response. The
   immunosuppressive effect of the MDCK-clone on splenocytes was further
   demonstrated via ChIFN-gamma lack production after ex vivo mitogenic
   stimulation. Genome sequencing of the two clones identified only four
   amino acid differences including three in the HA sequence (HA-E198A,
   HA-R234L, HA-E502D-H9 numbering) and one in the NA sequence (NA-V33M).
   In the present study, valuable insights on the mechanisms responsible
   for AI pathogenicity and molecular mechanisms of H9N2 infections in
   chicken were obtained while highlighting the impact of the cells viruses
   are grown on their virulence.},

Abstract = {Objectives To control the emerging threat of antimicrobial resistance,
   international policy appeals for appropriate monitoring of antimicrobial
   usage (AMU) at supranational, species and farm level. The aim of this
   study was to quantify AMU in broilers at farm and flock level in nine
   European countries.
   Methods Antimicrobial treatment data of one flock and purchased
   antimicrobials over one year were collected at 181 European broiler
   farms. Afterwards AMU was quantified using treatment incidence (TI) per
   100days based on Defined Daily Dose (DDDvet), Defined Course Dose
   (DCDvet) or Used Daily Dose (UDDvet) values. Total AMU at flock level
   was obtained by summing the TIDDDvet of all treatments in the sampled
   flock (TIDDDvetFl{*}).
   Results The median TIDDDvetFl{*} was 9.0 (95\% CI 5.5-10.8), meaning
   that broilers were treated with antimicrobials during 9\% of their
   rearing period. TIDDDvetFl{*} varied considerably within and between
   countries. However, in every country at least one untreated flock was
   present. Average TIDDDvetFl{*} at country level ranged from 3.3 to 36.7.
   Polymyxins, extended-spectrum aminopenicillins and fluoroquinolones were
   the most used antimicrobials, accounting for 26\%, 26\% and 18\% of
   total AMU, respectively. Twenty-six percent of the farms started a
   treatment on day 1 of production, and 49\% of overall AMU was
   administered within the first week.
   Conclusions Results show that rearing broilers without AMU is feasible.
   However, a huge variation in AMU in terms of amount, moment of
   administration and antimicrobial classes was observed. This shows that
   there is still ground to be covered when it comes to AMU on broiler
   farms.},

Abstract = {Here we report studies of the antigenic relationship of West Nile virus
   (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV), two zoonotic flaviviruses from Italy,
   together with a Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) strain and compared
   them with their genetic relationship using the immunodominant viral E
   protein. Thirty-nine isolates and reference strains were inactivated and
   used to immunize rabbits to produce hyper immune sera. Serum samples
   were tested by neutralization against all isolates and results
   visualized by generating antigenic map. Strains of WNV, USUV, and JEV
   grouped in separate clusters on the antigenic map. JEV was closer
   antigenically to USUV (mean of 3.5 Antigenic Unit, AU, equivalent to a
   2-fold change in antibody titer) than to WNV strains (mean of 6 AU). A
   linear regression model predicted, on average, one unit of antigenic
   change, equivalent to a 2-fold change in antibody titer, for every 22
   amino acid substitutions in the E protein ectodomain. Overall, antigenic
   map was demonstrated to be robust and consistent with phylogeny of the E
   protein. Indeed, the map provided a reliable means of visualizing and
   quantifying the relationship between these flaviviruses. Further
   antigenic analyses employing representative strains of extant
   serocomplexes are currently underway. This will provide a more in deep
   knowledge of antigenic relationships between flaviviruses.},

Title = {A mecC allotype, mecC3, in the CoNS Staphylococcus caeli, encoded within

Abstract = {Background Methicillin resistance in staphylococci is conferred by an
   alternative PBP (PBP2a/2) with low affinity for most -lactam
   antibiotics. PBP2a is encoded by mecA, which is carried on a mobile
   genetic element known as SCCmec. A variant of mecA, mecC, was described
   in 2011 and has been found in Staphylococcus aureus from humans and a
   wide range of animal species as well as a small number of other
   staphylococcal species from animals.
   Objectives We characterized a novel mecC allotype, mecC3, encoded by an
   environmental isolate of Staphylococcus caeli cultured from air sampling
   of a commercial rabbit holding.
   Methods The S. caeli isolate 82B(T) was collected in Italy in 2013 and
   genome sequenced using MiSeq technology. This allowed the assembly and
   comparative genomic study of the novel SCCmec region encoding mecC3.
   Results The study isolate encodes a novel mecA allotype, mecC3, with
   92\% nucleotide identity to mecC. mecC3 is encoded within a novel SCCmec
   element distinct from those previously associated with mecC, including a
   ccrAB pairing (ccrA5B3) not previously linked to mecC.
   Conclusions This is the first description of the novel mecC allotype
   mecC3, the first isolation of a mecC-positive Staphylococcus in Italy
   and the first report of mecC in S. caeli. Furthermore, the SCCmec
   element described here is highly dissimilar to the archetypal SCCmec XI
   encoding mecC in S. aureus and to elements encoding mecC in other
   staphylococci. Our report highlights the diversity of mecC allotypes and
   the diverse staphylococcal species, ecological settings and genomic
   context in which mecC may be found.},

Abstract = {Sheep milk is mainly transformed into cheese; thus, the dairy industry
   seeks more rapid and cost-effective methods of analysis to determine
   milk coagulation and acidity traits. This study aimed to assess the
   feasibility of Fourier-transform mid-infrared spectroscopy to determine
   milk coagulation and acidity traits of sheep bulk milk and to classify
   milk samples according to their renneting capacity. A total of 465 bulk
   milk samples collected in 140 single-breed flocks of Comisana (84
   samples, 24 flocks) and Sarda (381 samples, 116 flocks) breeds located
   in Central Italy were analyzed for coagulation properties (rennet
   coagulation time, curd firming time, and curd firmness) and acidity
   traits (pH and titratable acidity) using standard laboratory procedures.
   Fourier-transform mid-infrared spectroscopy prediction models for these
   traits were built using partial least squares regression analysis and
   were externally validated by randomly dividing the full data set into a
   calibration set (75\%) and a validation set (25\%). The discriminant
   capacity of the rennet coagulation time prediction model was determined
   using partial least squares discriminant analysis. Prediction models
   were more accurate for acidity traits than for milk coagulation
   properties, and the ratio of prediction to deviation ranged from 1.01
   (curd firmness) to 2.14 (pH). Moreover, the discriminant analysis led to
   an overall accuracy of 74 and 66\% for the calibration and validation
   sets, respectively, with greater sensitivity for samples that coagulated
   between 10 and 20 min and greater specificity to detect
   early-coagulating (<10 min) and late-coagulating (20-30 min) samples.
   Results suggest that Fourier-transform mid-infrared spectroscopy has the
   potential to help the dairy sheep industry identify milk with better
   coagulation ability for cheese production and thus improve milk
   transformation efficiency. However, further research is needed before
   this information can be exploited at the industry level.},

Abstract = {Dermanyssus gallinae (Mesostigmata: Dermanyssidae, De Geer, 1778) is an
   ectoparasite of poultry, suspected to play a role as a vector of
   Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica ser. Gallinarum. Despite an
   association between them being reported, the actual dynamics in field
   remain unclear. Therefore, the present study aimed to confirm the
   interactions among mites, pathogen and chickens. The study was carried
   out in an industrial poultry farm infested by D. gallinae, during an
   outbreak of fowl typhoid. The presence of S. Gallinarum in mites was
   assessed and quantified by a semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
   and real-time PCR, respectively, in mites collected during two
   subsequent productive cycles and the sanitary break. The anti-group D
   Salmonella antibodies were quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
   assay. During the outbreak and the sanitary break, S. Gallinarum was
   constantly present in mites. In the second cycle, scattered positivity
   was observed, although hens did not exhibit signs of fowl typhoid, as a
   result of the vaccination with BIO-VAC SGP695 (Fatro, Ozzano Emilia Bo,
   Italy). The data strongly suggest that D. gallinae acts as reservoir of
   S. Gallinarum, thus allowing the pathogen to persist in farms.
   Furthermore, the present study has highlighted the interactions among D.
   gallinae, S. Gallinarum and hens with respect to enhancing the
   mite-mediated circulation of S. Gallinarum in an infested poultry farm.},

Abstract = {Objectives: Enteric viruses are responsible for foodborne and waterborne
   infections affecting a large number of people. Data on food and water
   viral contamination in the south of Italy (Sicily) are scarce and
   fragmentary. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of viral
   contamination in food, water samples, and surface swabs collected in
   Sicily
   Methods: The survey was conducted on 108 shellfish, 23 water samples
   (seawater, pipe water, and torrent water), 52 vegetables, one peach and
   17 berries, 11 gastronomic preparations containing fish products and/or
   raw vegetables, and 28 surface swabs. Hepatitis A virus (HAV), genogroup
   GI, GII, and GIV norovirus (NoV), enterovirus (EV), rotavirus (RoV),
   hepatitis E virus (HEV), adenovirus (AdV), and bocavirus (BoV) were
   detected by nested (RT) PCR, real-time PCR, and sequence analysis.
   Results: The most frequently detected viruses in shellfish were HAV
   (13\%), NoV (18.5\%), and EV (7.4\%). Bocavirus was found in 3.7\%, HEV
   in 0.9\%, and AdV in 1.9\% of the molluscs. Of the 23 water samples,
   21.7\% were positive for GII NoV and 4.3\% for RoV and HEV genotype 3.
   Of the 70 vegetable samples, 2.9\% were positive for NoV GI (GI. 5 and
   GI. 6), 2.9\% for EV, and 1.4\% for HEV. In the gastronomic
   preparations, only one EV (9\%) was detected. No enteric viruses were
   detected in the berries, fruit, or swabs analyzed.
   Conclusions: Molecular surveillance of water and food samples clearly
   demonstrated that human pathogenic viruses are widely found in aquatic
   environments and on vegetables, and confirmed the role of vegetables and
   bivalve molluscs as the main reservoirs. (c) 2019 The Author(s).

Abstract = {I am often reminded of the famous saying of Goethe: ``Vedi Napoli e poi
   muori! - See Naples and die!{''}. Sadly, Naples is now confronted with a
   number of serious, ongoing problems with a need to alleviate pressure on
   the worsening environment. One serious problem facing the environment is
   the presence of the potentially hazardous persistent organic pollutants
   (POPs), although few systematic studies at regional scale have been
   conducted. In this study, samples of soil, air, and bulk deposition were
   collected in Naples metropolitan area (NMA) to characterize the status
   of POPs, including organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The
   results obtained showed that most of these compounds are pervasive in
   all the studied environmental matrices, especially in some hotspot
   areas, such as the Bagnoli Brownfield Site and the infamous ``Triangle
   of the Death{''}, where unwanted ecological risk conditions for PAHs and
   Endosulfan were determined, respectively. The interactional complexity
   between urban and the surrounding rural areas was also confirmed, as is
   the role that urban areas play in the migration and transformation
   process of POPs. High urban-rural gradients for atmospheric PAHs and
   PCBs were observed in the NMA, and the urban areas were identified as
   the emission source of these contaminants. Similarly, the OCP residues,
   historically originated from the nearby agricultural regions, experience
   long-term soil re-emission and continuously influence the connected
   urban environment via atmospheric transport processes.},

Abstract = {Mediterranean mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and blue mussels
   (Mytilus edulis) are among the most consumed fishery products, but they
   are frequent vehicles of foodborne infection worldwide. In this study,
   we investigated the occurrence and seasonality of zoonotic protozoans in
   mussels farmed or sold at retail outlets in Italy. We collected and
   tested 1,440 M. galloprovincialis and 180 M. edulis. Pooled samples were
   molecularly tested for Giardia duodenalis, Cryptosporidium spp., and
   Toxoplasma gondii and then sequenced. Sixty-two (45.9\%; 95\% confidence
   interval, 37.5 to 54.3\%) mussel pools tested positive for one or more
   of the investigated pathogens. Both Mytilus species and samples from all
   the investigated areas harbored pathogens. Mussels were statistically
   more contaminated by Cryptosporidium spp., followed by T. gondii and G.
   duodenalis assemblage A, and M. galloprovincialis was more contaminated
   than M. edulis (P < 0.01). Contamination was more likely in mussels at
   retail outlets (P < 0.05) than in those from farms and in mussels
   collected in spring (P < 0.01) than in other seasons. This is the first
   report of T. gondii found in M. galloprovincialis in Italy and in M.
   edulis in Europe. The detection of zoonotic protozoans in a widely
   consumed food source indicates the need for a more detailed
   microbiological risk analysis, especially considering that bivalve
   mollusks are often consumed raw worldwide.},

Abstract = {From November 2016 to April 2017, a cross-sectional study to determine
   the sero-prevalence of contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP) and to
   investigate its epidemiology was conducted in selected districts of
   Borana zone in Ethiopia. In addition, the study aimed at identifying
   Mccp antigens using species specific primer of PCR. A multistage random
   sampling was implemented to select districts, pastoral associations
   (villages), and households. A total of 890 serum samples of small
   ruminants that had not been vaccinated (goats n=789 and sheep n=101)
   were collected and screened for the presence of antibodies against
   Mycoplasma capricolum subspecies capripneumoniae using a competitive
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Lung tissues and pleural fluid
   samples were collected from 3 sero-positive and clinically suspected
   goats for isolation of Mycoplasma capricolum subspecies capripneumoniae.
   Serology showed that overall 31.2\% (246/789) of goats and 12.9\%
   (13/101) of sheep were positive with statistically significant
   differences between districts (p=0.001). Multivariable logistic
   regression analysis revealed that goats from Moyale and Yabello
   districts had higher odds of being positive than goats from Elwoya
   district with odd ratios of 2.05 and 1.61, respectively. Age of goats
   was also significantly associated with sero-positivity (OR=1.47; CI 95\%
   1.2-1.8). Mycoplasma capricolum subspecies capripneumoniae was
   identified in 6 (75\%) of the tissue samples using species-specific
   primer of PCR. Besides improving the understanding of the epidemiology
   of CCPP in the selected districts and demonstrating its wide
   distribution, the study highly also provides evidence of the possible
   role of sheep in the maintenance of the disease.},

Abstract = {BackgroundColonization by livestock-associated MRSA (LA-MRSA) has
   increasingly been reported in the swine population worldwide. The aim of
   this study was to assess the prevalence of MRSA nasal carriage in
   healthy pigs, including the black (Calabrese) breed, from farms in the
   Calabria Region (Southern Italy). Between January and March 2018, a
   total of 475 healthy pigs reared in 32 farms were sampled by nasal
   swabbing. MRSA isolates were characterized by spa, MLST and SCCmec
   typing, and susceptibility testing to 17 antimicrobials.Results22 of 32
   (66.8\%) pig farms resulted positive for MRSA. The prevalence of MRSA
   was 46.1\% (219 MRSA culture-positive out of 475 samples). MRSA
   colonization was significantly higher in intensive farms and in pigs
   with a recent or ongoing antimicrobial treatment. All 219 MRSA isolates
   were assigned to ST398. The most common spa types were t011 (37.0\%),
   t034 (22.4\%) and t899 (15.1\%). A novel spa type (t18290) was detected
   in one isolate. An insertion of IS256 in the ST398-specific A07 fragment
   of the SAPIG2195 gene was detected in 10 out of 81t011 isolates. Nearly
   all isolates carried the SCCmec type V element, except 11 isolates that
   carried the SCCmec type IVc. None of the isolates was positive for the
   Panton-Valentine leukocidin. All isolates were resistant to
   tetracycline. High resistance rates were also found for clindamycin
   (93.1\%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (68.4\%), fluoroquinolones
   (47.9-65.3\%) and erythromycin (46.1\%). None of the isolates was
   resistant to vancomycin and fusidic acid. Overall, a multidrug resistant
   phenotype was observed in 88.6\% of isolates.ConclusionsWe report a high
   prevalence of MRSA among healthy swine in Southern Italy farms, with
   higher isolation frequency associated with intensive farming. The
   epidemiological types identified in our study reflect those reported in
   other European countries. Our findings underscore the importance of
   monitoring the evolution of LA-MRSA in pig farms in order to implement
   control measures and reduce the risk of spread in the animal population.},

Title = {A new approach for Small Ruminant Lentivirus full genome
   characterization revealed the circulation of divergent strains},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},

Month = {FEB 21},
Abstract = {Small Ruminant Lentiviruses (SRLV) include at least 4 viral highly
   divergent genotypes. Genotypes A and B are widely distributed and
   genotypes C and E have been recognized in restricted geographic areas.
   New phylogroups have been identified targeting conserved regions.
   However, this approach suffers from the potential risk to misamplify
   highly divergent strains. Pathogenic strains are easily adapted to
   fibroblastic cells, but non-pathogenic strains isolation may require a
   different approach. We developed a fast and effective method for SRLV
   full genome characterization after cell culture isolation. Spleen
   samples were collected during regular slaughter from sheep and goats in
   northwestern Italy. Spleen-derived macrophage cultures were monitored
   for reverse transcriptase activity and RNA was extracted from the
   supernatant of positive cultures. Using Illumina MiSeq platform 22 new
   full genome sequences were obtained. The success of this approach is
   based on the following features: spleen is one of the main target for
   SRLV persistence; red pulp is a reserve of resident macrophages, the
   main target for SRLV replication in vivo; RTA is a sensitive assay for
   any replicating retrovirus; de novo sequencing do not require genetic
   knowledge in advance.},

Title = {Orthobunyavirus spike architecture and recognition by neutralizing

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {Orthobunyaviruses (OBVs) form a distinct genus of arthropod-borne
   bunyaviruses that can cause severe disease upon zoonotic transmission to
   humans. Antigenic drift or genome segment re-assortment have in the past
   resulted in new pathogenic OBVs, making them potential candidates for
   causing emerging zoonoses in the future. Low-resolution electron
   cryo-tomography studies have shown that OBV particles feature prominent
   trimeric spikes, but their molecular organization remained unknown. Here
   we report X-ray crystallography studies of four different OBVs showing
   that the spikes are formed by an N-terminal extension of the fusion
   glycoprotein Gc. Using Schmallenberg virus, a recently emerged OBV, we
   also show that the projecting spike is the major target of the
   neutralizing antibody response, and provide X-ray structures in complex
   with two protecting antibodies. We further show that immunization of
   mice with the spike domains elicits virtually sterilizing immunity,
   providing fundamental knowledge essential in the preparation for
   potential newly emerging OBV zoonoses.},

Title = {Anti-inflammatory and cognitive effects of interferon-beta 1a (IFN beta
   1a) in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROINFLAMMATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},
Month = {FEB 18},
Abstract = {Background: A beta(1-42) peptide abnormal production is associated with
   the development and maintenance of neuroinflammation and oxidative
   stress in brains from Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. Suppression of
   neuroinflammation may then represent a suitable therapeutic target in
   AD. We evaluated the efficacy of IFN1 beta a in attenuating cognitive
   impairment and inflammation in an animal model of AD.
   Methods: A rat model of AD was obtained by intra-hippocampal injection
   of A beta(1-42) peptide (23 mu g/2 mu l). After 6 days, 3.6 mu g of IFN
   beta 1a was given subcutaneously (s.c.) for 12 days. Using the novel
   object recognition (NOR) test, we evaluated changes in cognitive
   function. Measurement of pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory
   cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and SOD activity levels was
   performed in the hippocampus. Data were evaluated by one-way ANOVA with
   Fisher's Protected Least Significant Difference (PLSD) test.
   Results: We showed that treatment with IFN beta 1a was able to reverse
   memory impairment and to counteract microglia activation and
   upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1 beta) in the
   hippocampus of A beta(1-42)-injected rats. The anti-inflammatory
   cytokine IL-10, significantly reduced in the A beta(1-42) animals,
   recovered to control levels following IFN beta 1a treatment. IFN beta 1a
   also reduced ROS and lipids peroxidation and increased SOD1 protein
   levels in the hippocampus of A beta(1-42)-injected rats.
   Conclusion: This study shows that IFN beta 1a is able to reverse the
   inflammatory and cognitive effects of intra-hippocampal A beta(1-42) in
   the rat. Given the role played by inflammation in AD pathogenesis and
   the established efficacy of IFN beta 1a in the treatment of inflammatory
   diseases of the central nervous system such as multiple sclerosis, its
   use may be a viable strategy to inhibit the pro-inflammatory cytokine
   and oxidative stress cascade associated with A beta deposition in the
   hippocampus of AD patients.},

Title = {Influence of the early bacterial biofilms developed on vats made with

Volume = {291},

Month = {FEB 16},
Abstract = {Early vat bacterial biofilms developed spontaneously through contact
   with whey have been characterized on seven wood types (Castanea sativa
   Miller, Cedrus libani, A. Rich., Prunus avium L., Fraxinus ornus L.,
   Juglans regia L., Pinus nigra J.F. Arnold and Populus nigra L.). The
   present study aimed to evaluate the influence of these biofilms on the
   microbiological, chemical, physical and sensory characteristics of PDO
   Vastedda della valle del Belice (VdB) cheese, processed traditionally
   from raw ewe's milk using wooden tools. To this purpose, the
   experimental cheeses after 15 d of refrigerated storage were examined.
   Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) populations dominated the microbial community
   of all samples. The species more frequently identified were Lactococcus
   laths among starter LAB and Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus
   rhamnosus, Lactobacilli's fermentum and Pediococcus pentosaceus among
   non starter LAB. Culture-independent analysis of microbiota diversity
   was performed by MiSeq Illumina that identified Streptococcus as major
   group followed by members of Enterobacteriaceae family, Lactococcus and
   Lactobacillus. Generally, the seven tree species did not negatively
   affect the physicochemical composition of VdB cheeses. Chestnut (both
   Sicilian and Calabrian) vats produced cheeses with significant lower hue
   angle (a(star)/b(star)) than other wood types. Among chemical
   parameters, significant variations were registered for a(w), primary and
   secondary lipid oxidation state (significantly lower for the VdB cheeses
   produced with poplar wood), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The
   significant differences detected among the VOCs emitted from cheeses
   were not perceived by the panelists who recognized all cheeses from the
   different trials as similar. This study confirmed the suitability of
   cedar, cherry, ash, walnut, black pine and poplar as alternative woods
   to chestnut for the production of the wooden vats employed in cheese
   making for the Sicilian traditional dairy productions.},

Title = {Considerations for design and implementation of vaccine field trials for
   novel foot-and-mouth disease vaccines},
Journal = {VACCINE},

Abstract = {Vaccines are commonly used to control Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) in
   endemic regions and form an important part of contingency plans for
   FMD-free countries. Conventional FMD vaccines have numerous limitations,
   and the U.S. government supports the development of next-generation
   vaccines. In the U.S., vaccine efficacy is typically demonstrated
   through experimental vaccination and challenge of animals using the
   World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) standards. Although
   conventional challenge and immunogenicity studies provide useful
   information, they have limitations and results do not always accurately
   predict field performance. Consequently, there is a need to test
   next-generation vaccines under field conditions to gain a better
   understanding of field performance to inform policy decisions and
   support their viability as a commercial product.
   In June 2017, an expert consultation was organised to discuss and define
   an optimal field study design for novel FMD vaccines. Cattle were the
   primary species considered, although parallel strategies for swine and
   small ruminants were also discussed. Many methodological and logistical
   considerations in the study design were identified, including: (1) study
   site selection and the importance of baseline studies to understand
   exposure risk, (2) ethics of using a placebo and assessing equivalence
   with conventional vaccines, (3) merits of using individual randomised
   versus cluster randomised trials, (4) preventive versus reactive
   vaccination, and (5) methods of randomisation and blinding.
   The proposed optimal study design was a multicentre (i.e. farm),
   three-arm, double-blind randomised controlled trial comparing groups
   receiving the novel vaccine to a conventional vaccine group and a
   placebo group. Large farms in areas of high exposure risk were
   identified as ideal study sites, and the primary study outcome was
   susceptibility to disease or infection, during a six-month observation
   period, following a single dose of vaccine. This report provides a
   summary of the important issues to consider when designing a field
   efficacy study in livestock and proposes a study design that could be
   utilised for novel FMD vaccines.},

Title = {Nutritional and lipidomics biomarkers of docosahexaenoic acid-based
   multivitamin therapy in pediatric NASH},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 14},
Abstract = {Two recent randomized controlled trials demonstrated improved
   radiographic, histological and hepatometabolic cues of non-alcoholic
   steatohepatitis (NASH) in pediatric patients treated with the omega-3
   fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in combination with vitamin D (VD)
   or with choline (CHO) and vitamin E (VE), the DHA-VD and DHA-CHO-VE
   trials, respectively). In the present study we verified the nutritional
   compliance to these DHA-based multivitamin treatments; lipidomics
   biomarkers of the reported outcome on NASH indicators were also
   investigated. Samples were obtained from 30 biopsyproven pediatric NASH
   patients of the DHA-CHO-VE trial randomized in multivitamin treatment
   group and placebo group (n = 15 each), and from 12 patients of the
   treatment group of the DHA-VD trial. All patients underwent 6-month
   therapy plus 6 months of follow-up. Plasma samples and clinical data
   were obtained at baseline and at the end of the study (12 months).
   Selected biomarkers included the free form of DHA and other omega-3
   fatty acid arachidonic acid (AA), indices of the vitamin E status, and
   some hepatic metabolites of these lipids. Radiographic and histological
   improvements of treated patients were associated with increased
   concentrations of DHA, alpha-linolenic acid and alpha-tocopherol (i.e.
   VE), and with decreased AA that was also investigated in complex lipids
   by untargetd lipidomics. As a result a significantly lowered AA/DHA
   ratio was observed to represent the main indicator of the response to
   the DHA-based therapy. Furthermore, baseline levels of AA/DHA showed
   strong association with NAS and US improvement. A stable correction of
   DHA AA metabolism interaction is associated with the curative effect of
   this therapy and may represent a key nutritional endpoint in the
   clinical management of pediatric NASH.},

   that delta VB (0.5 mM) ameliorated the HG cytotoxicity (0.57 +/- 0.02 vs
   0.41 +/- 0.018 O.D. (P < 0.01). Interestingly, buffalo milk extracts
   enriched with delta VB showed improved significant efficacy in
   decreasing reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and cytokine
   release during HG treatment compared to milk extracts alone (P < 0.05).
   It is noteworthy that delta VB reduced the HG-activated inflammatory
   signal by modulating SIRT1 (0.96 +/- 0.05 vs 0.85 +/- 0.04 AU), SIRT6
   (0.82 +/- 0.04 vs 0.61 +/- 0.03 AU), and NF-kappa B (0.85 +/- 0.03 vs
   1.23 +/- 0.03 AU) (P < 0.05). On the whole, our data show the first
   evidence of delta VB efficacy in reducing endothelial oxidative stress
   and inflammation, suggesting a potential role of this betaine as a novel
   dietary compound with health-promoting properties.},

Title = {Characterization of circulating miRNA signature in water buffaloes
   (Bubalus bubalis) during Brucella abortus infection and evaluation as

Abstract = {Brucellosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria from the
   Brucella genus that can be transmitted to humans through contact with
   infected animals or contaminated animal products. Brucellosis also
   causes financial losses in animal production. Ruminants are highly
   susceptible to brucellosis, and the causative agent water buffaloes
   (Bubalus bubalis) is Brucella abortus. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs)
   are cropping up as promising biomarkers for several infectious diseases.
   The goals of this study were to characterize the serum miRNA signature
   associated with brucellosis in water buffaloes and investigate the
   miRNAs' potential use as biomarkers in vaginal fluids. Next Generation
   Sequencing was used to assess miRNA expression profiles in
   Brucella-positive and Brucella-negative blood sera; dysregulated miRNAs
   in blood serum and vaginal fluids were validated using RT-qPCR. ROC
   curves were generated to evaluate the diagnostic value of miRNAs for
   Brucella. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were exploited to
   investigate the biological functions of dysregulated miRNAs. The results
   showed that 20 miRNAs were modulated, of which, 12 were upregulated and
   8 were downregulated. These findings were corroborated by RT-qPCR, and
   ROC curves indicated that the miRNAs can serve as potential biomarkers
   for Brucella. GO and KEGG pathway analyses pointed out that some of
   these miRNAs are related to immune response and apoptosis. These results
   provided an overview of miRNA expression profiles and highlighted
   potential biomarkers for Brucella infection in water buffaloes. We also
   demonstrated the potential of vaginal fluids in studies involving
   microRNA detection. Further functional and mechanistic studies of these
   miRNAs may improve our understanding of the biological processes
   involved in Brucella infection and host immune response.},

Abstract = {Bioactive glasses are well-known materials suitable for bone-related
   applications thanks to their biocompatibility and osteoconductivity. In
   order to improve their in vivo performance, the modification of the
   glass composition by adding ions with specific biological functions is
   required. As copper (Cu) possesses antibacterial properties, in this
   study, 5 wt \% of CuO has been added to the 45S5 bioactive glass
   composition. The investigation of the effect of the Cu-containing
   bioactive glass on cellular behavior has revealed that the presence of
   Cu induces an early differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells
   through osteoblast phenotype, Target la earn promotes the expression of
   anti-inflammatory interleukin, and reduces proinflammatory interleukin
   expression. With the aim to produce coatings with antibacterial
   properties, the Cu-containing bioactive glass was used as the target
   material for the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) of bioactive thin films.
   PLD experiments were carried out at different substrate temperatures to
   study the effect on the film's characteristics. All of the films are
   compact, crack-free, and characterized by a rough morphology and good
   wettability. The in vitro bioactivity was demonstrated by the apatite
   growth on the coating surface, after soaking in simulated body fluid,
   revealed by Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy-energy
   dispersive X-ray analyses. The antibacterial study proved that the
   material showed more effective activity against three Gram-negative
   bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica)
   rather than against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus).},

Abstract = {Human colon cancer is one of the higher aggressive solid tumors, whose
   high mortality, much like many other solid tumors, results from
   metastasis formation. To reduce this high mortality, more effective
   chemotherapy, allowing a specific tumor accumulation and an efficient
   early-stage medical imaging as well, are still needed. At this regard,
   stimuli-responsive nanocarriers for anticancer drug delivery are
   promising strategy in cancer therapy. For this purpose, a dual targeted
   redox-responsive drug delivery system, prepared by coating
   super-paramagnetic nanoparticles (SPIONs) with the amphiphilic copolymer
   INU-LA-PEG-FA and loading doxorubicin (DOXO-SPIONs) was investigated as
   tool for solid tumor chemotherapy. Folic acid (FA) has been chosen as
   active targeting agent as its receptor is upregulated in many tumors,
   including colon cancer. Lipoic acid (LA) has been used to act as the
   redox-responsive moiety, due to the presence of the -S-S- linkage into
   its structure, which can undergo intracellular reductive-induced
   cleavage, and therefore, a modification of stability and release profile
   of the nanocarrier. Accumulation by magnetic attraction was used as
   synergistic targeting strategy. Improved anticancer activity was
   demonstrated in mice by evaluating tumor volume reduction,
   immunohistochemical analyses and imaging properties using magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI).},

Abstract = {Avian feathers have the potential to accumulate trace elements
   originating from contaminated food and polluted environments. In fact,
   in feathers, metals bind to keratin, a sulphur-containing protein for
   which several metals have a strong affinity. Here, the concentrations of
   18 essential and non-essential elements were investigated in a Humboldt
   penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) colony housed at the Acquario di
   Cattolica (Italy). This species is listed as vulnerable in the Red List
   of the International Union for Conservation of Nature. According to the
   literature, there is usually a link between metal levels in the diet of
   birds and levels detected in their feathers. Thus, metals were also
   determined in the penguins' food (capelin, Mallotus villosus). We
   hypothesize that the controlled conditions in which birds are kept in
   captivity, and the homogeneous diet that they follow could allow a
   better understanding of metal bioaccumulation (such as mercury) or
   bio-dilution (such as arsenic) in the marine food chain, indicated by
   penguins' feathers.
   Moreover, comparisons with our previous investigations performed on an
   ex-situ African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) colony suggest that
   penguins living indoors have lower body burden of metals than those
   living outdoors. Indeed, environmental contaminants usually found in
   areas subjected to anthropogenic impact, where zoos and aquaria are
   often located, are not accumulated to levels of concern. (C) 2018

Title = {Reproduction of contagious caprine pleuropneumonia reveals the ability
   of convalescent sera to reduce hydrogen peroxide production in vitro},
Journal = {VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {50},
Month = {FEB 8},
Abstract = {Contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP), caused by Mycoplasma
   capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae is a severe disease widespread in
   Africa and Asia. Limited knowledge is available on the pathogenesis of
   this organism, mainly due to the lack of a robust in vivo challenge
   model and the means to do site-directed mutagenesis. This work describes
   the establishment of a novel caprine challenge model for CCPP that
   resulted in 100\% morbidity using a combination of repeated intranasal
   spray infection followed by a single transtracheal infection employing
   the recent Kenyan outbreak strain ILRI181. Diseased animals displayed
   CCPP-related pathology and the bacteria could subsequently be isolated
   from pleural exudates and lung tissues in concentrations of up to 10(9)
   bacteria per mL as well as in the trachea using immunohistochemistry.
   Reannotation of the genome sequence of ILRI181 and F38(T) revealed the
   existence of genes encoding the complete glycerol uptake and metabolic
   pathways involved in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production in the
   phylogenetically related pathogen M. mycoides subsp. mycoides.
   Furthermore, the expression of L--glycerophosphate oxidase (GlpO) in
   vivo was confirmed. In addition, the function of the glycerol metabolism
   was verified by measurement of production of H2O2 in medium containing
   physiological serum concentrations of glycerol. Peroxide production
   could be inhibited with serum from convalescent animals. These results
   will pave the way for a better understanding of host-pathogen
   interactions during CCPP and subsequent vaccine development.},

Title = {Cross-Border Transmission of Salmonella Choleraesuis var. Kunzendorf in
   European Pigs and Wild Boar: Infection, Genetics, and Evolution},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {FEB 6},
Abstract = {Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serotype Choleraesuis is a swine
   adapted serovar. S. Choleraesuis variant Kunzendorf is responsible for
   the majority of outbreaks among pigs. S. Choleraesuis is rare in Europe,
   although there have been serious outbreaks in pigs including two
   outbreaks in Denmark in 1999-2000 and 2012-2013. Here, we elucidate the
   epidemiology, possible transmission routes and sources, and clonality of
   European S. Choleraesuis isolates including the Danish outbreak
   isolates. A total of 102 S. Choleraesuis isolates from different
   European countries and the United States, covering available isolates
   from the last two decades were selected for whole genome sequencing. We
   applied a temporally structured sequence analysis within a Bayesian
   framework to reconstruct a temporal and spatial phylogenetic tree. MLST
   type, resistance genes, plasmid replicons, and accessory genes were
   identified using bioinformatics tools. Fifty-eight isolates including 11
   out of 12 strains from wild boars were pan-susceptible. The remaining
   isolates carried multiple resistance genes. Eleven different plasmid
   replicons in eight plasmids were determined among the isolates.
   Accessory genes were associated to the identified resistance genes and
   plasmids. The European S. Choleraesuis was estimated to have emerged in
   similar to 1837 (95\% credible interval, 1733-1983) with the mutation
   rate of 1.02 SNPs/genome/year. The isolates were clustered according to
   countries and neighbor countries. There were transmission events between
   strains from the United States and European countries. Wild boar and pig
   isolates were genetically linked suggesting cross-border transmission
   and transmission due to a wildlife reservoir. The phylogenetic tree
   shows that multiple introductions were responsible for the outbreak of
   2012-2013 in Denmark, and suggests that poorly disinfected vehicles
   crossing the border into Denmark were potentially the source of the
   outbreak. Low levels of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
   differences (0-4 SNPs) can be observed between clonal strains isolated
   from different organs of the same animal. Proper disinfection of
   livestock vehicles and improved quality control of livestock feed could
   help to prevent future spread of S. Choleraesuis or other more serious
   infectious diseases such as African swine fever (ASF) in the European
   pig production system.},

Title = {Paternal leakage and mtDNA heteroplasmy in Rhipicephalus spp. ticks},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 6},
Abstract = {Paternal leakage of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and heteroplasmy have been
   recently described in several animal species. In arthropods, by
   searching in the Scopus database, we found only 23 documented cases of
   paternal leakage. Therefore, although arthropods represent a large
   fraction of animal biodiversity, this phenomenon has been investigated
   only in a paucity of species in this phylum, thus preventing a reliable
   estimate of its frequency. Here, we investigated the occurrence of
   paternal leakage and mtDNA heteroplasmy in ticks belonging to one of the
   most significant tick species complexes, the so-called Rhipicephalus
   sanguineus sensu lato. By developing a multiplex allele-specific PCR
   assay targeting a fragment of the 12S rRNA ribosomal region of the
   mtDNA, we showed the occurrence of paternal leakage and mtDNA
   heteroplasmy in R. sanguineus s.l. ticks originated from experimental
   crosses, as well as in individuals collected from the field. Our results
   add a new evidence of paternal leakage in arthropods and document for
   the first time this phenomenon in ticks. Furthermore, they suggest the
   importance of using allele-specific assays when searching for paternal
   leakage and/or heteroplasmy, as standard sequencing methods may fail to
   detect the rare mtDNA molecules.},

Title = {A survey on zoo mortality over a 12-year period in Italy},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {FEB 6},
Abstract = {Background. The zoo is a unique environment in which to study animals.
   Zoos have a long history of research into aspects of animal biology,
   even if this was not the primary purpose for which they were
   established. The data collected from zoo animals can have a great
   biological relevance and it can tell us more about what these animals
   are like outside the captive environment. In order to ensure the health
   of all captive animals, it is important to perform a post-mortem
   examination on all the animals that die in captivity.
   Methods. The causes of mortality of two hundred and eighty two mammals
   which died between 2004 and 2015 in three different Italian zoos (a
   Biopark, a Safari Park and a private conservation center) have been
   investigated.
   Results. Post mortem findings have been evaluated reporting the cause of
   death, zoo type, year and animal category. The animals frequently died
   from infectious diseases, in particular the causes of death in ruminants
   were mostly related to gastro-intestinal pathologies. pulmonary diseases
   were also very common in each of the zoos in the study. Moreover, death
   was sometimes attributable to traumas, as a result of fighting between
   conspecifics or during mating. Cases of genetic diseases and
   malformations have also been registered.
   Discussion. This research was a confirmation of how conservation,
   histology and pathology are all connected through individual animals.
   These areas of expertise are extremely important to ensure the survival
   of rare and endangered species and to learn more about their
   morphological and physiological conditions. They are also useful to
   control pathologies, parasites and illnesses that can have a great
   impact on the species in captivity. Finally, this study underlines the
   importance of a close collaboration between veterinarians, zoo
   biologists and pathologists. Necropsy findings can help conservationists
   to determine how to support wild animal populations.},

Abstract = {We examined a total of 369 bovine liver and muscle samples for the
   detection of oxytetracycline (OTC), tetracycline (TC), chlortetracycline
   (CTC), and doxycycline (DOX) residues by implementation and validation
   of a LC-MS/MS method. The method showed good recovery values between
   86\% and 92\% at three levels of concentrations. The linearity tests
   revealed r(2) > 0.996 for all the tetracyclines examined. Furthermore,
   the Youden test revealed that the method was robust. Only 14.4\% of the
   samples showed OTC and TC residues in a concentration range of 10.4-40.2
   mu g kg(-1). No CTC and DOX residues were found in all the samples
   analyzed. Liver samples showed the highest average values (31.5 +/- 20.6
   and 21.8 +/- 18.9 for OTC and TC, respectively). The results showed a
   low incidence of TCs in all the samples examined, in comparison with
   other studies reported in the literature. A significant decrease in TC
   residues frequency was found from 2013 (p < 0.05). This work reports for
   the first time epidemiological data on the presence of TC residues in
   liver and muscle samples of cattle farmed in Sicily (Southern Italy).
   The very low incidence of TC residues indicates a continuous improvement
   in farming techniques in Southern Italy, which is essential to ensure
   consumers' protection.},

Title = {Determination of the microbiological contamination in minced pork by

Abstract = {Routine evaluation of bacterial contamination in minced pork is still
   mainly performed by the enumeration of indicator bacteria, including
   total aerobic colony count and E. coli, using standardized isolation
   methods. However, the bacterial community structure as well as the
   effect of the storage time and temperature on the aerobic plate count
   are largely unknown for this matrix. The aim of the study was to
   characterize the microbial community in minced pork by 16S rRNA amplicon
   sequencing compared to classical isolation methods combined with
   identification by Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of
   flight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF MS) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
   Analysis of 14 unrelated samples showed that total aerobic counts
   determined at 30 degrees C and 7 degrees C showed no significant
   difference, but the richness was higher on PCA at 30 degrees C for 7
   samples, equal in 5, and higher at 7 degrees C for 2 samples. Members of
   the genus Pseudomonas, along with the genera Brochothrix and
   Carnobacterium were commonly identified among both the mesophilic and
   psychrotrophic population. Comparing to 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing,
   some contrasting data were obtained. Except for Brochothrix spp. and
   Pseudomonas spp., that were abundant and always detected, genera
   obtained with the two methods in the same sample were not always the
   same. Comparison of different sample preparation techniques and DNA
   extraction methods demonstrated also in this matrix that different
   results on the microbial composition and complexity are obtained.
   Present data illustrate that the combined isolation and identification
   of isolates using MALDI TOF MS and 16S gene sequencing and overall
   community profiling using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing provides
   complementary results and yields important insights into the complex
   relationship between microorganisms in a food.},

Abstract = {Food packaging is not only a simple protective barrier, but a real
   active component, which is expected to preserve food quality, safety and
   shelf-life. Therefore, the materials used for packaging production
   should show peculiar features and properties. Specifically,
   antimicrobial packaging has recently gained great attention with respect
   to both social and economic impacts. In this paper, the results obtained
   by using a polymer material functionalized by a small synthetic peptide
   as active packaging are reported. The surface of Polyethylene
   Terephthalate (PET), one of the most commonly used plastic materials in
   food packaging, was plasma-activated and covalently bio-conjugated to a
   bactenecin-derivative peptide named 1018K6, previously characterized in
   terms of antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities. The immobilization of
   the peptide occurred at a high yield and no release was observed under
   different environmental conditions. Moreover, preliminary data clearly
   demonstrated that the active packaging was able to significantly reduce
   the total bacterial count together with yeast and mold spoilage in
   food-dairy products. Finally, the functionalized-PET polymer showed
   stronger efficiency in inhibiting biofilm growth, using a Listeria
   monocytogenes strain isolated from food products. The use of these
   active materials would greatly decrease the risk of pathogen development
   and increase the shelf-life in the food industry, showing a real
   potential against a panel of microorganisms upon exposure to fresh and
   stored products, high chemical stability and re-use possibility.},

Abstract = {This review summarizes the available knowledge on the immune defences of
   European sea bass against antigenic preparations derived from the viral
   encephalopathy and retinopathy virus (betanodavirus), which represents a
   major threat to the health of this fish species. The nodavirus is widely
   present and differentiates into several strains that infect
   invertebrates (in insects, alphanodavirus) and teleost fish, and thus
   may represent a great problem for farmed fish species. Many efforts have
   been directed to discovering new immunizations to induce protection in
   sea bass, especially at young stages, and these efforts have included
   employing diverse betanodavirus strains, antigen preparation,
   vaccination routes, and the addition of adjuvants and/or
   immunostimulants. The obtained results showed that inactivated
   preparations of betanodavirus that were administered intraperitoneally
   may induce both immune recognition and protection. Attempts at
   performing mucosal immunization by immersion and/or oral administration,
   which is a vaccination route that is highly preferred for sea bass, have
   shown intriguing results, and more studies are necessary for its
   improvement. Overall, the objective of identifying a reliable vaccine
   that also cross-protects against different genotypes or reassortant
   viruses for use in European sea bass against betanodavirus appears to be
   an attainable goal in the near future.},

Abstract = {Samples (n=485) of raw (n=394) or heat-treated (n=91) milk of three
   different species (cow, n=170; sheep, n=133; donkey, n=84), collected
   2013-2016 in Western Sicily (Southern Italy), were analyzed for
   aflatoxin M-1 (AFM(1)) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
   Positive ELISA results were further analyzed by HPLC with fluorescence
   detection. Both methods had a detection limit for AFM(1) in milk of
   7ngkg(-1). ELISA yielded 12.9 and 5\% positives in cows and sheep milk,
   respectively, all samples of donkey milk were negative. Levels of AFM(1)
   were in most cases at 0.007-<0.05gkg(-1), only two samples (sheep milk)
   slightly exceeded the European Union maximum level of 0.05gkg(-1). Only
   6\% of the samples were positive for AFM(1) in a concentration range of
   0.008-0.15gkg(-1). Only milk samples collected directly from farms were
   positive. Overall, the levels were much lower than previously reported
   for Southern Italy cow and sheep milk samples purchased in retail
   stores. The results of this work indicate a continuous improvement of
   the feeding techniques on dairy farms of Southern Italy, which is
   essential to ensure consumers' protection.},

Title = {From purchase to consumption of bivalve molluscs: A qualitative study on
   consumers' practices and risk perceptions},
Journal = {FOOD CONTROL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {96},
Pages = {410-420},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Worldwide bivalve production has increased significantly in recent
   years. Bivalve meat is recommended in dietary regimens due to the
   benefits associated with their consumption but, at the same time, is
   internationally recognized as a potential vehicle for outbreaks of
   foodborne disease. To reduce food risk exposure, consumers must pay
   close attention when purchasing, handling and consuming bivalves. This
   study aimed to collect information on consumers' perceptions and
   practices related to bivalve purchasing, managing and consumption at
   home. A focus group methodology was adopted to better understand
   consumers' food practices and risk perceptions regarding molluscs. Four
   focus groups involving 42 consumers were conducted in Veneto and Marche
   region. The core analysis was then applied to each focus group
   discussion in order to identify, categorize and rank the information
   collected. The most important factors that came to light during the
   focus groups concerned the personal reasons for preparing bivalves at
   home; the place of purchase; the elements guiding consumers when
   purchasing bivalves; the bivalve preparation, cooking and storage
   conditions at home; the consumption of raw molluscs and the health
   risks; the consumers' categories most at risk; and the production chain
   control by the authorities. The data reported in the article can provide
   useful information to public authorities working on food safety for
   developing effective risk communication strategies.},

Abstract = {In this study, an immunology-based assay that employed specific
   monoclonal antibodies binding with somatic or flagella antigens of
   Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica was performed. As this pathogen is
   one of the most important bacterial species responsible for foodborne
   outbreaks, its detection in food by rapid and easy methods is properly
   suitable. After a first screening by indirect ELISA, three monoclonal
   antibodies (1B6D9, 1B6C11, 1D12F11) versusS. enterica subsp. enterica
   serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028 (whole antigen) and another one (4E6F11)
   versusS. enterica flagellin were further characterized by immunoblotting
   and mass spectrometry analysis. Then, a total of 84 food samples (dairy
   products, meat, pasta and flour, eggs, and animal feed) were analyzed by
   both the official method ISO 6579:2002 and S. enterica capture ELISA.
   For the standardization of the last method, the specific monoclonal
   antibody 4E6F11 was selected. The developed Salmonella capture ELISA
   showed a significant agreement with the official method (ISO 6579:2002).
   Relative sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 100\%, 81.0\%, and
   90.5\%, respectively. Therefore, this assay could represent a valid
   alternative to conventional methods able to detect this pathogen in
   food.},

Abstract = {Exploring the microbial diversity of ticks is crucial to understand
   geographical dispersion and pathogen transmission. Tick microbes
   participate in many biological processes implicated in the acquisition,
   maintenance, and transmission of pathogens, and actively promote host
   phenotypic changes, and adaptation to new environments. The microbial
   community of Ixodes ventalloi still remains unexplored. In this study,
   the bacterial microbiota of wild-caught I. ventalloi was characterized
   using shotgun-metagenomic sequencing in samples from unfed adults
   collected during December 2013-January 2014 in two locations from
   Sicily, Italy. The microbiota identified in I. ventalloi was mainly
   composed of symbiotic, commensal, and environmental bacteria.
   Interestingly, we identified the genera Anaplasma and Borrelia as
   members of the microbiota of I. ventalloi. These results advance our
   information on L ventalloi microbiota composition, with potential
   implications in tick-host adaptation, geographic expansion, and vector
   competence.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to assess the concentrations of lead
   (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) in the liver and kidney from stray dogs (Canis
   lupus familiaris) and cats (Felis catus) found dead between 2014 and
   2017 in the city of Naples and its surrounding areas. These organs from
   290 dogs and 88 cats were collected after ordinary necropsy of stray
   animals. Heavy metal concentrations were determined by using atomic
   absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). Concentrations of Pb (up to
   5.93mg/kg) and Cd (ranging from 0.005 to 6.13mg/kg) were detected in
   both livers and kidneys analyzed. Differences in concentration were
   found based on age class, gender, and kind of tissue for both elements,
   with a trend similar to those already reported in the literature for
   comparable studies from different countries. Cadmium levels in the
   kidney were significantly higher (p<0.05) in females than those in males
   for both species. As regards to Pb, the highest concentrations were
   detected in the liver (3.45mg/kg in dog and 5.93 in cat, respectively)
   followed by the renal tissue, with no significant difference depending
   on the animal gender. This study can be considered the first one in
   Italy regarding stray dogs and cats as bio-indicators of environmental
   contamination due to lead and cadmium, suggesting that pets could be
   sentinel animals to evaluate human exposure to these heavy metals.},

Title = {A relationship between environmental pollutants and enteric viruses in
   mussels(Mytilus galloprovincialis)},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {169},
Pages = {156-162},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Mussels can be affected by environmental contaminants, as
   non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (NDL-PCBs), polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and cadmium (Cd). Moreover, mussels may
   concentrate human enteric viruses, like noroviruses (NoVGI/GII),
   astrovirus (AsV) and rotavirus (RV). Herein, to establish a relationship
   between environmental and viral contamination, with the aim to ensure
   human food safety, both chemical and microbiological analysis were
   carried out in mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis, farmed in Campania
   region (Italy). Chemical analysis revealed ranges below the European
   maximum limits, and were: Sigma 6 NDL-PCBs (28, 52, 101, 138, 153, 180)
   0.579-16.857 ng g(-1) wet weight (ww); BaP LOQ (< 0.2 g kg(-1))- 2.9 pg
   kg(-1) ww, and E4 PAHs (BaA, CHR, BbFA, BaP) 0.7-23.7 g kg(-1) ww; Cd
   LOQ (< 0.005 mg kg(-1))-0.078 mg kg(-1) ww. In addition, mussels
   exhibited a prevalence of NoVGI (18\%), NoVGII (43\%), AsV (40\%), RV
   (30\%) and the presence of more than one viruses resulted in about 35\%.
   Overall, a simultaneous contamination, both chemical and viral, was
   found in 62\% of samples. Interestingly, virus-positive mussels showed
   levels of chemicals higher than negative ones.},

Title = {The importance of distinguishing pufferfish species (Lagocephalus spp.)
   in the Mediterranean Sea for ensuring public health: Evaluation of the
   genetic databases reliability in supporting species identification},
Journal = {FISHERIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {210},
Pages = {14-21},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Taxonomic identification of marine organisms is sometimes hindered by
   morphological similarities and utilization of wrong criteria. Therefore,
   the morphological approach often requires the support of molecular tools
   which usually rely on a comparison of DNA sequences available in free
   publicly-accessible databases. However, the process can be affected by
   wrongly deposited sequences which lead to specimens' misidentification.
   This is the case of two toxic pufferfish species (Lagocephalus spadiceus
   and L. guentheri), both reported as Lessepsian invasive species, whose
   actual presence in the Mediterranean is debated within the scientific
   community. In this study, the reliability of the genetic databases
   GenBank and BOLD in supporting the discrimination of L. spadiceus and L.
   guentheri was assessed as it has been already debated in literature.
   Twenty Mediterranean specimens of L. guentheri were collected and
   morphologically identified. COI and cytb reference sequences were then
   produced and included in two separate analyses (one for each gene)
   together with corresponding online sequences of L. spadiceus and L.
   guentheri from all the available localities. A high percentage of
   sequences with non-valid taxonomic identification was observed,
   involving 32.5\% of the COI and 43.7\% of the cytb sequences from
   GenBank and 30\% of the COI sequences from BOLD. The majority of
   sequences deposited under L. spadiceus, mostly of Mediterranean origin,
   were genetically confirmed to be misidentified L. guentheri. Outcomes
   highlighted two main shortcomings: i) a low taxonomic accuracy of
   official databases due to the presence of sequences attributed to wrong
   species; (ii) a significant underestimation of L. guentheri presence in
   the Mediterranean Sea. This study, therefore, underlines the necessity
   to improve the databases accuracy in term of deposited sequences
   reliability. In this specific case, accuracy is even more important,
   considering the involved toxic species and the potential concern for
   public health associated with their accidental entering in the seafood
   chain.},

Title = {Effectiveness of a 10\% imidacloprid/4.5\% flumethrin polymer matrix
   collar in reducing the risk of Bartonella spp. infection in privately
   owned cats},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {BackgroundBartonella henselae, Bartonella clarridgeiae and the rare
   Bartonella koehlerae are zoonotic pathogens, with cats being regarded as
   the main reservoir hosts. The spread of the infection among cats occurs
   mainly via fleas and specific preventive measures need to be
   implemented. The effectiveness of a 10\% imidacloprid/4.5\% flumethrin
   polymer matrix collar (Seresto (R), Bayer Animal Health), registered to
   prevent flea and tick infestations, in reducing the risk of Bartonella
   spp. infection in privately owned cats, was assessed in a prospective
   longitudinal study.MethodsIn March-May 2015 {[}Day 0 (D0)], 204
   privately-owned cats from the Aeolian Islands (Sicily) were collared
   (G1, n = 104) or left as controls (G2, n = 100). The bacteraemia of
   Bartonella spp. was assessed at enrolment (D0) and study closure (D360)
   by PCR and DNA sequencing both prior to and after an enrichment step,
   using Bartonella alpha proteobacteria growth medium (BAPGM).ResultsA
   total of 152 cats completed the study with 3 in G1 and 10 in G2 being
   positive for Bartonella spp. Bartonella henselae genotype I ZF1 (1.35\%)
   and genotype II Fizz/Cal-1 (6.76\%) as well as B. clarridgeiae (5.41\%)
   were detected in cats of G2. Bartonella clarridgeiae was the only
   species detected in G1. Based on the yearly crude incidence of
   Bartonella spp. infection (i.e. 3.85\% in G1 and 13.51\% in G2; P =
   0.03) the Seresto (R) collar achieved a preventative efficacy of
   71.54\%. The incidence of Bartonella spp. infection was more frequent in
   flea-infested cats (6/33, 18.18\%) than in uninfested ones (7/112,
   5.88\%) (P = 0.036).ConclusionsCats living in the Aeolian Islands are
   exposed to B. henselae and B. clarridgeiae. The Seresto (R) collar
   provided significant risk reduction against Bartonella spp. infection in
   outdoor cats under field conditions. Such a preventative tool could be a
   key contribution for decreasing the risk of Bartonella spp. infection in
   cats and thus ultimately to humans.},

Abstract = {Bluetongue (BT) and epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) are globally
   re-emerging diseases of domestic and wild ruminants, respectively caused
   by BT virus (BTV) and EHD virus. Both viruses are transmitted by
   hematophagous midges; however, newly recognized BTV serotypes may be
   transmitted horizontally without requirement for any biological vector.
   The global range of these viruses and/or their associated diseases have
   changed remarkably in recent years, most notably with the invasion of
   Europe by multiple serotypes of BTV since 1998. Although not zoonoses,
   the unanticipated emergence of BT and EHD in several different areas of
   the world provides a uniquely sobering and unambiguous reminder of the
   potential consequences of climate change on the distribution and
   severity of vector-borne diseases. Recent experiences with these viruses
   have also emphasized the need for effective, DIVA-compatible vaccines to
   combat anticipated future incursions, as existing vaccines have serious
   inherent deficiencies.},

Abstract = {The epidemiological patterns of Bluetongue (BT) in North Africa and
   Mediterranean Basin (MB) dramatically changed by emergence of subsequent
   episodes of novel bluetongue virus (BTV) serotypes with highly
   pathogenic indexes and socio-economic impacts. The objective of the
   study was to investigate the sero-prevalence and serotype distribution
   of BTV in Libya. During 2015-2016, a total of 826 serum samples were
   collected from domestic ruminants in Libya. All sera were assayed by
   competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (c-ELISA).
   C-Elisa-positive samples (43.3\%; 173/400) were further analyzed by
   virus neutralization assay to identify BTV serotypes and determine the
   antibody titre of positive samples. An overall BTV sero-prevalence was
   48.4\% (95\% CI: 45.0\%-51.8\%). Neutralizing antibodies were detected
   against the following BTV serotypes namely: BTV-1, BTV-2, BTV-3, BTV-4,
   BTV-9 and BTV-26. While BTV-1, BTV-2, BTV-4 and BTV-9 circulation was
   unsurprising as they have been responsible of the last year outbreaks in
   Northern African Countries, the detection of BTV-3 and BTV-26 was
   definitely new and concerning for the animal health of the countries
   facing the Mediterranean Basin. It is crucial that European and Northern
   African authorities collaborate in organizing common surveillance
   programmes to early detect novel strains or emerging serotypes in order
   to set up proper preventive measures, and, in case, develop specific
   vaccines and plan coordinated vaccination campaigns.},

Abstract = {In human breast cancer, both circulating tumour cells (CTCs) in
   peripheral blood and disseminated tumour cells (DTCs) in the bone marrow
   are predictive of short survival and may be used as liquid biopsy to
   guide therapy. Herein we investigate, for the first time, the
   feasibility to quantify CTCs and DTCs in canine metastatic mammary
   carcinoma (MMC) with the automated CellSearch platform, which identifies
   tumour cells by immune-magnetic enrichment and fluorescent labelling.
   Using this approach before start of treatment, we could detect at least
   1 CTC per 7.5 mL of peripheral blood in 12 out of 27 evaluable samples
   (44.4\%) and at least 1 DTC per 1 mL of bone marrow in 11 out of 14
   evaluable samples (78.6\%). Conversely, we did not find any CTCs in the
   healthy, negative control dogs (n = 5) that we analysed in parallel.
   Interestingly, the levels of CTCs/DTCs and the prevalence of positive
   dogs closely resemble results obtained by CellSearch assay in metastatic
   breast cancer patients at diagnosis. Moreover, in the canine cohort, the
   presence of CTCs was significantly associated with poor outcome. These
   observations identify the first actionable marker in veterinarian
   oncology to guide treatment of canine MMC. Furthermore, our findings
   have important implications for human research, since it reinforce the
   value of canine MMC as model useful to speed up pharmacological studies
   with primary endpoint of overall survival, given the reduced life-span
   of the canine species.},

Abstract = {A Flavivirus survey on 183 hunting dogs was conducted in Campania
   region, Southern Italy. The seroprevalence value of 40.43\% (74/183,
   95\% confidence intervals {[}CIs] 33.37-47.49) detected in our study
   using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent serologic assay (cELISA)
   proves a considerable level of Flavivirus exposition of these animals.
   Among the 74 cELISA-positive sera, seroneutralization (SN) test showed
   that 24 sera resulted positive for Usutu virus with an overall
   prevalence of 13.11\% (24/183) (95\% CI 8.27-17.95), but none of
   cELISA-positive samples resulted positive for West Nile virus. Data
   analysis showed a significant difference of cELISA seropositivity risk
   factors in case of presence of farm animals in contact with hunting dogs
   and for dogs living in a rural environment but not for gender, age,
   management, hunting season, and hunting abroad. A RT-PCR assay was
   performed to detect the Flavivirus RNA, but none of the blood samples
   tested positive. This study documents the first report regarding the
   circulation of Flavivirus in hunting dog in Southern Italy and suggests
   the dog as an interesting target to monitor Flavivirus circulation.},

Title = {EU and US control measures on Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp.
   in certain ready-to-eat meat products: An equivalence study},
Journal = {FOOD CONTROL},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {European Union (EU) and United States (US) regulations implement
   different food safety standards, particularly relating to the presence
   of Listeria monocytogenes in certain ready-to-eat (RTE) meat products.
   Compared to EU, the US adopt different procedures and methods, and
   establish zero tolerance limits to ensure consumers protection from
   Listeria monocytogenes in RTE products. A complete equivalence
   evaluation of the EU and US food inspection and certification systems
   has not been carried out yet. This study was funded by the Italian
   Central Competent Authority in the field of food safety (Ministry of
   Health) and included a total of 164 Italian establishments, 81
   authorized for export of pork meat products to US ({''}US
   establishments{''}) and 83 only authorized for EU internal trade ({''}EU
   establishments{''}). Establishments were stratified according to
   production volume, type of RTE products manufactured, presentation and
   processing, in order to include two homogeneous groups (US and EU).
   Sampling was carried out by NAS (Carabinieri Corps for the prevention of
   the adulteration of beverages and foodstuffs) without any given notice.
   Sampling, detection and identification of Listeria monocytogenes and
   Salmonella spp. took place according to US Food Safety and Inspection
   Service (FSIS) directives and procedures. All 1124 samples tested
   negative for Salmonella spp., while 5 samples tested positive for
   Listeria monocytogenes. Among the latter, 4 samples were collected in 3
   US establishments (US products prevalence 4/556 = 0.72\%, 95\% CL:
   0.29-1.83\%; US establishments prevalence 3/81 = 3.70\%, 95\% CL:
   1.34-10.32\%) and 1 was collected in a EU establishment (EU products
   prevalence 1/568 = 0.18\%, 95\% CL: 0.04-0.98\%; EU establishment
   prevalence 1/83 = 1.20\%, 95\% CL: 0.29-0.46\%). Bilateral Fisher's
   exact test showed no differences between EU and US products and
   establishments prevalence (P = 0.213 and P = 0.364, respectively),
   corroborating the existence of equivalent Listeria monocytogenes and
   Salmonella spp. contamination in the products under these two control
   systems.},

Abstract = {Viral encephalopathy and retinopathy (VER) is a severe infective disease
   characterized by neuropathological changes in several fish species
   associated with high mortality. The etiological agent is a virus
   belonging to the Nodaviridae family, genus Betaraodavirus. To date, four
   different betanodavirus species have been officially recognized by
   International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), namely the
   red-spotted grouper-(RGNNV), the striped jack- (SJNNV), the barfin
   flounder- (BFNNV) and the tiger puffer nervous necrosis virus (TPNNV).
   Moreover, two reassortants RGNNV/SJNNV and SJNNV/RGNNV have been
   described.
   Betanodaviruses can be classified into three different serotypes (A, B
   and C) that are antigenically different, so none (between serotype A and
   C) or partial (between serotype B and C) cross-immunoreactivity has been
   detected in vitro.
   In this study we investigated the in vivo cross-protection of the two
   main betanodavirus species (RGNNV and SJNNV), which belong to distinct
   serotype, by immunizing intraperitoneally (IP) juvenile sea bass with
   formalin inactivated RGNNV and SJNNV vaccines, followed by a challenge
   with RGNNV.
   Fish IP vaccinated with inactivated RGNNV showed a high protection value
   (85\%). Serological analyses highlighted a great specific anti-NNV
   immunoglobulin M (IgM) production against the homologous virus, while a
   good seroconversion with low neutralization property was highlighted
   against the heterologous virus. In fish IP vaccinated with inactivated
   SJNNV the protection recorded was equal to 25\%, significantly lower
   respect to the one provided by RGNNV IP vaccine. ELISA test detected
   good IgM production against the homologous virus, and a lower, but still
   detectable IgM production against the heterologous one. By contrast,
   serum neutralization test highlighted a poorly detectable antibody
   production unable to neutralize either the homologous or the
   heterologous virus.
   These results confirm that the two serotypes are not cross-protective in
   vivo. According to these findings, the production of multivalent
   formulation, or at least the provision of different types of vaccines
   based on both fish and virus species requirement, should be recommended
   in order to broaden the range of protection.},

   samples, but toxigenic C. difficile was isolated only in two of them.
   The prevalence in cooked food was 0,3\% (1/296), while in uncooked
   processed foods was 1,9\% (1/54). Data support the potential risk of
   food as a source of toxigenic C. difficile for hospitalized patients,

Title = {Expression of the feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptors in normal

Journal = {VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY},

Abstract = {The feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptors (FLVCRs) were originally
   cloned as virus receptors, but are now believed to function also as heme
   transporters and are expressed in a broad range of tissues in a wide
   range of mammalian species. Expression of FLVCR1 and FLVCR2 was
   investigated in 19 bovine papillomavirus-associated urinary bladder
   cancers and in 15 non-neoplastic samples of bladder from cattle. E5
   oncoprotein of bovine Deltapapillomaviruses (delta PVs) was detected in
   17 of the 19 bladder cancers. Flvcr1 and Flvcr2 were amplified and
   sequenced both in neoplastic and non-neoplastic samples showing a 100\%
   identity with bovine Flvcr1 and Flvcr2 mRNA sequences present in GenBank
   database (accession numbers: NM\_001206019.1 and NM\_001192143.1,
   respectively). Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR showed that Flvcr1 and
   Flvcr2 were overexpressed in 4 and 5 out of 19 urothelial cancers,
   respectively, but in none of the non-neoplastic samples. In addition,
   western blot analysis detected higher levels of FLVCR1 and FLVCR2 in
   samples in which transcripts were not increased, suggesting
   post-translational changes to these proteins. Increased FLCVR1 and
   FLVCR2 was also observed immunohistochemically in the neoplastic cells.
   Immunolabeling for FLVCR1 was seen in the cytoplasm and plasm membrane
   of urothelial cancer cells, wheras immunolabeling for FLVCR2 was present
   within the nucleus. This is the first time that FLVCR expression has
   been investigated in bovine tissues and the first to suggest that
   expression could be increased in cancers. Additional studies are
   required to define the role, if any, of FLVCR in
   papillomavirus-associated cancer cells.},

Abstract = {Sturgeon aquaculture production has increased worldwide, particularly in
   Italy, yet there is little information about diseases that affect
   sturgeons. With this study we describe the results of screening for
   bacterial infections during monitoring campaigns carried out from 2014
   to 2017. A total of 402 sturgeons from six sturgeon farms with one or
   more reared sturgeon species among five species and two hybrids were
   analysed. Bacteriological exam was positive in 93 individuals (23\%) and
   negative in the remaining 309 (77\%). Generally, no external or internal
   macroscopic lesions were present, though some specimens showed skin
   lesions, liver anaemia or splenomegaly, which are non-pathognomonic
   signs of bacterial infection. The majority of the isolated bacteria were
   opportunistic. This knowledge base is important to help create a
   bacterial profile of sturgeons reared in Italy.},

Abstract = {Chemical hazards may enter the milk chain during primary production. The
   study, for the first time, investigated the occurrence of bisphenol A
   (BPA) levels in cow milk samples collected on the farm following manual
   or mechanical milking and from the cooling tank. We applied a new
   monitoring model based on the identification of the hazards at each
   stage of the milk chain to identify potential pathways for contamination
   along the milk chain. We evaluated exposure to BPA through milk
   consumption based on detected contamination levels and the temporary
   tolerable daily intake established by the European Food Safety Authority
   (EFSA). Milk samples (n = 72) were analyzed using liquid chromatography
   with fluorescence detection. The mean BPA concentrations were 0.757 mu
   g/L in manually milked samples, 0.580 mu g/L in mechanically milked
   samples, and 0.797 mu g/L in milk from the cooling tank. Bisphenol A
   occurred in the milk chain as a result of different stages of milking,
   and reached the highest levels at the end of the milk chain. Although
   the dietary intake of BPA was below the EFSA's temporary tolerable daily
   intake, exposure to BPA, even at low doses, through milk consumption
   represents a public health concern. Therefore, to ensure milk safety,
   new monitoring plans should be applied based on the identification of
   hazards at each stage of the milk chain.},

Title = {Antimicrobial susceptibility pattern to disinfectants in Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa strains isolated from dairy sheep breeds in Sardinia},
Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {11-15},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Introduction - Pseudomonas aeruginosa is still one of the leading causes
   of morbidity in dairy animals and particularly associated with severe
   clinical forms of mastitis. Its outstanding capacity to evade the
   activity of antimicrobial prophylaxis makes this species one of the most
   feared pathogens. In this context the World Health Organization (WHO)
   has reported this pathogen in a catalogue of bacteria that pose the
   greatest threat to human health. Thus, an accurate disinfection
   procedure is needed to avoid the incidence of Pseudomonas- related
   diseases in veterinary as well as in human medicine.
   Aim - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance
   patterns to common disinfectants in P. aeruginosa strains isolated from
   ovine breeding farms in Italy.
   Materials and methods - In this study a set of 44 clinical P aeruginosa
   strains isolated from 11 different sheep breeding farms with clinical
   cases of severe mastitis were analyzed and evaluated for susceptibility
   to 4 different disinfectants: Benzalkonium Chloride (BZC), Chlorhexidine
   (CHX), Sodium Hypochlorite (NaClO) and Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2). The
   capacity of these disinfectants to inhibit P. aeruginosa was evaluated
   by using standard broth microdilution methods.
   Results and discussion - The results showed that CHX and NaClO were the
   most active against this bacterium, but a great number of
   multi-disinfectant resistant strains were observed altogether,
   especially if we consider BZC and H2O2, with 55\% of drug resistant
   strains. Moreover, a correlation was evaluated between H2O2 MIC values
   and: (i) percentage of mucoid strains, (ii) increase in resistance
   patterns to other disinfectants (Pearson's 2 was 0.029 for CHX).
   Conclusion - The work suggests the crucial role of disinfection in
   veterinary medicine and raises concern about the possibility of an
   inadequate prophylaxis through the use of Hydrogen Peroxide on breeding
   farms contaminated with Pseudomonas spp.},

Abstract = {Interspecific differences in arsenic bioaccumulation and organ
   distribution (muscle, liver, kidney and gills) in three predator fish
   (creole perch, rainbow trout and brown trout) from a Patagonian lake
   impacted by volcanic eruptions were studied. Arsenic in fish organs were
   compared analyzing: 1) temporal (before and after volcanic eruption) and
   spatial (near and far from the volcano) influence of Puyehue-Cordon
   Caulle volcanic complex activity on arsenic concentrations; 2) the
   influence of growth (as total length), organ type and their interactions
   over arsenic accumulation; and 3) arsenic speciation and total arsenic
   relationship with carbon to nitrogen ratios (C:N), as a proxy of lipid
   presence, in fish muscle. In general, total arsenic concentrations in
   creole perch organs were 2-7 times higher than those recorded in the
   corresponding organs of salmonids. Arsenic was preferentially
   accumulated in liver and kidney in the three fish species. The influence
   of the volcanic activity over arsenic concentrations was more evident in
   creole perch: organs from creole perch captured closest to the volcano
   exhibited higher arsenic concentrations. Temporal variations were not so
   consistent. No clear relationship between arsenic and fish length was
   observed. Positive and linear relationship between arsenic in all pair
   of organs was found in creole perch, while rainbow trout showed a
   quadratic relationship between muscle and the remaining organs,
   indicating different arsenic assimilation-elimination relationships
   between organs and fish. The arsenic liver:muscle ratio in the three
   fish species was greater than 1, suggesting some level of arsenic
   stress. Arsenobetaine (AB) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) were the
   dominant arsenic species in muscle of these fish, having creole perch
   3-4 times higher AB than rainbow trout. A positive relationship between
   C:N ratio and total arsenic concentrations was found, with higher C:N in
   creole perchs near the volcano. In terms of food safety, no inorganic
   arsenic compound were detected, therefore arsenic levels in fish from
   Lake Nahuel Huapi does not represent any health risk to consumers.},

Abstract = {The extremely complex tumor microenvironment (TME) in humans is the
   major responsible for the therapeutic failure in cancer nanomedicine. A
   new concept of disease-driven nanomedicine, henceforth named
   ``Theranomics{''}, which attempts to target cancer cells and TME on the
   whole, represents an attractive alternative. Herein, a nanomedicine able
   to co-deliver doxorubicin and a tumor suppressive proteolytic protein
   such as collagenase-2 was developed. We successfully obtained
   superparamagnetic nanogels (SPIONs/Doco@Col) via the intermolecular
   azide-alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition. We demonstrated that a local ECM
   degradation and remodeling in solid tumors by means of collagenase-2
   could enhance tumor penetration of nanomedicines and the in situ
   sustained release of the drug payload throughout 3-D tumor spheroids up
   to the core (parenchyma), thus enabling a synergistic and efficient
   anticancer effect toward highly invasive breast tumors. We illustrate
   that SPIONs/Doxo@Col is also capable of reducing the invasivity of
   cancer cells.},

Abstract = {An unusual mortality event (UME) of striped dolphins Stenella
   coeruleoalba occurred in the period July to December 2016 along the
   Italian Ionian coastline. We conducted a complete postmortem examination
   on 28 specimens and detected dolphin morbillivirus (DMV), by means of
   biomolecular analyses, in the target tissues of 17 animals. Unlike
   previous outbreaks occurring in the Mediterranean Sea in 2011 and 2013,
   we observed typical pathological changes suggestive of morbilliviral
   infection in an acute/subacute phase and immunohistochemical reactivity.
   The same findings were observed in 13 other specimens beached along the
   Italian coastline during 2016 with no temporal and geographical
   relationship with the ongoing epidemic outbreak. Molecular
   characterization and phylogenetic analysis showed that DMV sequences
   detected in Italy in 2016 clustered with those identified in Portugal
   and Galicia (Spain), representing a novel DMV strain of Atlantic origin
   which entered the Mediterranean Sea and affected a naive striped dolphin
   population. DMV sequences detected in the previous Mediterranean
   outbreaks exhibited a marked genetic relatedness and diverged from those
   detected in cetaceans stranded along the Galician and Portuguese coasts
   since 2007.},

Abstract = {This study reports gross, histopathological, and molecular features of a
   Chlamydia abortus infection in a stranded female striped dolphin
   Stenella coeruleoalba from the Tyrrhenian coast of southern Italy.
   Post-mortem examination revealed liver congestion, splenic lymphoid
   depletion with capsular petechiae, and pneumonia. Histology revealed
   disseminated intravascular coagulation with vasculitis and congestion.
   Hepatocellular and acute myocardial degeneration were also observed.
   Basophilic, coccobacillary inclusions consistent with Chlamydia spp.
   were ob served histologically in the type II pneumocytes, myocardial
   fibers, and hepatocytes, and in macro phages and plasma cells of liver,
   spleen, and prescapular lymph nodes. Chlamydial antigen was detected by
   immunofluorescence assay using genus-specific anti-Chlamydia antibodies.
   PCR assay revealed C. abortus in spleen, liver, heart, and lungs. C.
   abortus was the only pathogen detected. The main pathological changes
   suggest that Chlamydia infection may have been the cause of stranding
   and death of the striped dolphin. This case represents the first
   molecular detection of a member of the Chlamydiaceae in a marine mammal.},

Abstract = {Blood donation screening for West Nile virus (WNV) was mandatory in the
   Lazio region in 2017 and 2018 (June-November) according to the national
   surveillance plan. In these years, all five donations reactive in WNV
   nucleic acid amplification tests harboured instead Usutu virus (USUV).
   Clade `Europe 2' was identified in four blood donations and a 2018
   mosquito pool. The cocirculation of WNV and USUV in Lazio warrants
   increased laboratory support and awareness of possible virus
   misidentification.},

   Italian bats},
Journal = {VIRUS RESEARCH},

Volume = {260},

Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been detected worldwide in several bat
   species, which are considered the main reservoir. The attention to the
   high diversity of CoVs hosted by bats has increased during the last
   decade due to the high number of human infections caused by two zoonotic
   Beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, that cause several respiratory
   diseases. Among coronaviruses, two Alpha-CoV strains (HuCoV-229E and
   HuCoV-NL63) cause mild respiratory disease that can change to severe
   disease in children, elderly and individuals affected by illnesses.
   Phylogenetic analysis conducted on bat Alpha-CoV strains revealed their
   evolutive correlation to human strains, suggesting their origin in bats.
   The genome of CoVs is characterized by a high frequency of mutations and
   recombination events, increasing their ability to switch hosts and their
   zoonotic potential. In this study, three strains of Alpha-CoV genera
   detected in Italian bats (Pipistrellus kuhlii) were fully sequenced by
   Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and characterized. The complete genome
   analysis showed the correlation of the Italians strains with a Chinese
   strain detected in 2013 and, based on CoV molecular species demarcation,
   two new Alpha-CoV species were established. The analysis of a fragment
   of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) showed the correlation of the
   Italian strains with CoVs that was only detected in the bat Pipistrellus
   genera (Pipistrellus kuhlii and Pipistrellus Pipistrellus) in European
   countries.},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe present study evaluated the therapeutic effectiveness of
   moxidectin 1.0\% (w/v) and imidacloprid 10\% (w/v) (Advocate (R) spot-on
   solution for cats, Bayer Animal Health) against natural infections with
   the eyeworm Thelazia callipaeda in cats. This study was conducted as a
   GCP, negative-controlled, blinded and randomised field study in
   privately owned cats living in an area in southern Italy where T.
   callipaeda is enzootic.MethodsThe study was carried out in 30 cats (19
   females and 11 males, aged from 8 months to 5 years, weighing 1.2-5.2
   kg) of different breeds, naturally infected by T. callipaeda. At study
   inclusion (Day 0), animals were physically examined and the infection
   level was assessed by examination of both eyes for clinical score and
   live adult T. callipaeda count. Each cat was weighed and randomly
   assigned to one of the treatment groups (G1: Advocate, G2: untreated
   control). Clinical assessments and T. callipaeda adult counts were
   performed on Day 14. At the study completion visit on Day 28, clinical
   assessments and counts of T. callipaeda adults and larvae were
   performed. All cats were daily observed by their owners and general
   health conditions were recorded during the entire period of the
   study.ResultsThe primary effectiveness variable was the percentage of
   animals in G1 group (Advocate) showing a complete elimination
   (parasitological cure) of adult eye worms at Day 14 and Day 28 . The
   effectiveness of the treatment in the G1 group was 93.3 and 100\% at Day
   14 and Day 28 , respectively, when compared to group G2. Total worm
   count reduction from both eyes for Advocate was 96.3\% on Day 14 and
   100\% on Day 28. Clinical data were confirmed by the examination of
   conjunctival pouch flushing. An overall reduction in the number of cats
   with lacrimation and conjunctivitis was observed following treatment
   despite the fact that in a few cats treated with Advocate clinical signs
   persisted due to the chronic nature of the disease.ConclusionsBased on
   the results of the present trial, a single dose of Advocate was found to
   be safe and highly effective in the treatment of natural T. callipaeda
   infection in cats.},

Abstract = {The bacterial photosynthetic reaction centre (RC) is a membrane spanning
   protein that, upon illumination, promotes the reduction of a ubiquinone
   molecule withdrawing electrons from cytochrome c(2). This
   photo-activated reaction has been often exploited, in suitably designed
   photoelectrochemical cells, to generate photocurrents sustained by the
   reduction at the working electrode of the photo-oxidized electron donor
   or by the oxidation of the electron acceptor. In this work we have
   explored in more detail the factors affecting the photocurrent
   generation in commercially available screen-printed electrochemical
   cells containing an electrolyte solution where RC proteins and suitable
   mediators are solubilized. In particular, the role of the applied
   potential and the influence of concentration and structure of acceptor
   and donor molecules have been assessed. We show that efficient
   generation of cathodic photocurrents in a three electrode configuration
   occurs at an applied potential of 0.0 V versus quasi-ref Ag (the open
   circuit potential of the system measured in the dark) in presence of
   ferrocenemethanol and decylubiquinone, which proved to guarantee high
   performances as electron donor and acceptor respectively. Moreover, we
   employed a set of differential equations, describing reaction and
   diffusion processes, for modelling with high accuracy the
   chronoamperometry profiles recorded at variable RC concentrations. This
   model allowed us to estimate the kinetic parameters relevant to the
   chemical and electrochemical reactions triggered by light and to get a
   snapshot of the electrolyte composition in the bulk and electrode
   surroundings at different times from the light exposure. The
   characteristic time course of the photocurrent, showing a fast rise to a
   peak value followed by a slower decay, has been therefore explained as
   the result of the strict interconnection between the dynamical processes
   involved. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Month = {JAN 9},
Abstract = {Bluetongue (BT) is a viral disease that affects ruminants and is
   transmitted by midges of the genus Culicoides spp. The seroprevalence,
   the clinical form and the occurrence rates significantly differ in
   relation to several factors such as bluetongue virus (BTV) serotype,
   host species, breed susceptibility, specific previous exposure, vector
   ecology, husbandry and health status. Following the 2001-2006 BTV2 and
   BTV16 epidemics in central Italy, a new epidemic caused by BTV1 occurred
   in 2013-2015 causing 398 outbreaks in a susceptible population of about
   1 million ruminants. The present study assessed the BTV1 seroprevalence
   in the sheep population of central Italy by conducting two
   cross-sectional surveys, in the proximity of and within BT outbreak
   farms. A total of 2,984 sheep from 437 farms were sampled. The
   animal-level prevalence was 19\% (95\% CI: 17-21\%), the between-herd
   prevalence was 46\% (95\% CI: 41-51\%) and the within-herd prevalence
   was 21\% (95\% CI: 16-26\%). Risk factors were investigated by logistic
   regression models. Living on a farm where an outbreak occurred and the
   number of outbreaks in proximity of the farm were identified as risk
   factors, while herd size was identified as a protective factor. This
   study represents the first BT survey in southern Europe and reports
   valuable findings on BTV epidemiology. Despite intensive virus
   circulation, the estimated seroprevalences were low. The assessment of
   the population immunity level is crucial for defining an efficient
   vaccination strategy and for predicting the impact of future virus
   circulation. In view of the low seroprevalence detected albeit an
   extensive BTV1 circulation, the population immunity was likely to be
   inadequate in preventing new BTV1 epidemics. Moreover, considering the
   recurrent introduction of new serotypes from North Africa and the
   Balkans, the control of multi-serotype BTV infections will continue to
   present a challenge in the near future.},

Abstract = {Staphylococcal food poisoning outbreaks are a major cause of food-borne
   illness in the European Union and their notification has been mandatory
   since 2005. Criteria for the enumeration of coagulase-positive
   Staphylococci (CPS) and the detection of staphylococcal enterotoxins
   (SEs) in cheese have been set down in Commission Regulation EC
   2073/2005. Currently, few information are available about the
   distribution of SEs in naturally contaminated cheeses, including
   raw-milk and artisanal dairy products. The aim of this study was
   therefore to investigate at both the CPS enumeration and the succession
   of the enterotoxigenic Staphylococcus aureus and produced enterotoxins
   levels on the rind and the core of a raw-milk semi-hard cheese, produced
   on farm. The study has been conducted in three steps: (I) seven wheels
   at different time of ripening where tested for the presence of SEs. (II)
   from each wheel, four portions were subsequently sampled from four
   different areas (peripheral rind, central rind, peripheral core and
   central core). (III) two cheese wheels, characterized by the highest and
   lowest CPS numbers and SEs quantification, based on the second step of
   the study, were further analyzed. A significant difference has been
   observed in the distribution of CPS and SEs in the four areas sampled,
   irrespectively of the batch and the time of ripening. The results of
   this study provided a set of previously unknown information on the
   influence of natural conditions on the distribution of CPS and SEs
   thereof in the cheese matrix, filling a gap in the understanding of SEs
   biosynthesis process.},

Title = {Impact of intramammary inoculation of inactivated Lactobacillus
   rhamnosus and antibiotics on the milk microbiota of water buffalo with
   subclinical mastitis},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},

Month = {JAN 7},
Abstract = {Water buffalo mastitis represents a major issue in terms of animal
   health, cost of therapy, premature culling and decreased milk yeld. The
   emergence of antibiotic resistance has led to investigate strategies to
   avoid or reduce antibiotics' based therapies, in particular during sub
   clinical mastitis. The use of Generally Regarded As Safe bacteria (GRAS)
   such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus to restore the unbalance in mammary
   gland microbiota could provide potential corrective measures. The aim of
   this study was to investigate the changes in milk microbiota after the
   intramammary treatment with inactivated cultures of Lactobacillus
   rhamnosus of mammary gland quarters naturally affected by subclinical
   mastitis as compared to antibiotic therapy.A number of 43 quarters
   affected by subclinical mastitis with no signs of clinical inflammation
   and aerobic culture positive for pathogens were included in the study.
   The experimental design was as follows: 11 quarters were treated with
   antibiotics, 15 with inactivated cultures of Lactobacillus rhmnosus and
   17 with PBS as negative control, by means of intrammary injection.
   Samples were collected at eight time points, pre- (T-29, T-21, T-15,
   T-7, T0 days) and post-treatment (T1, T2, and T6 days). Microbiological
   culture and Somatic Cell Count (SCC) were perfomed on all the samples,
   and microbiota was determined on milk samples collected at TO and T6 by
   amplifying the V4 region of 16S rRNA gene by PCR and sequencing using
   next generation sequencing technique. Treatment with Lactobacillus
   rhamnosus elicited a strong chemotactic response, as determined by a
   significant increase of leukocytes in milk, but did not change the
   microbiological culture results of the treated quarters. For what
   concerns the analysis of the microbiota, the treatment with
   Lactobacillus rhamnosus induced the modification in relative abundance
   of some genera such as Pseudomonas and 5-7N15. As expected, antibiotic
   treatment caused major changes in microbiota structure with an increase
   of Methylobacterium relative abundance. No changes were detected after
   PBS treatment. In conclusion, the present findings demonstrated that the
   in vivo intrammmary treatment with Lactobacillus rhamnosus has a
   transient pro-inflammatory activity by increasing SCC and is capable to
   modify the microbiota of milk after six days from inoculation, albeit
   slightly, even when the bacterial cultures were heat inactivated.
   Further studies are necessary to assess the potential use of this GRAS
   as supportive therapy against mastitis.},

Abstract = {We conducted a survey of attitudes towards antimicrobial use and
   awareness of antimicrobial resistance among turkey and rabbit farmers (N
   = 117 and N = 41, respectively) in Italy's utmost turkey- and
   rabbit-producing region. We found either similarities or significant
   differences between these two livestock sectors. Most farmers of both
   groups (72\% of turkey farmers vs 76\% of rabbit farmers) reported that
   antimicrobials are properly used in their farms. Almost three-quarters
   of the farmers reported that antimicrobials solve the health problem
   treated for. However, 47\% of turkey farmers and 78\% of rabbit farmers
   reported that antimicrobial use could be decreased, with a 20-30\%
   reduction being the most frequently chosen range. Genetic improvement
   was reported to be the main factor able to reduce antimicrobial use in
   turkeys, whereas improvements in feed quality and microclimate were the
   main factors for rabbits. Most farmers reported that high antimicrobial
   use may affect the quality of meat products and be hazardous to human
   health, but they also reported that antimicrobial resistance is mainly
   related to antimicrobial use in humans. In conclusion, turkey and rabbit
   farmers have a generally positive opinion on veterinary antimicrobial
   use, but also low levels of awareness of the negative impact on public
   health. Economic and structural factors of rabbit production industry
   may explain the differences observed. Farm veterinarians will be crucial
   to support farmers' education and the expected transition to lower
   antimicrobial use while maintaining high animal health/welfare
   standards.},

Abstract = {Globally, vibrios represent an important and well-established group of
   bacterial foodborne pathogens. The European Commission (EC) mandated the
   Comite de European Normalisation (CEN) to undertake work to provide
   validation data for 15 methods in microbiology to support EC
   legislation. As part of this mandated work programme, merging of ISO/TS
   21872-1:2007, which specifies a horizontal method for the detection of
   V. parahaemolyticus and V. cholerae, and ISO/TS 21872-2:2007, a similar
   horizontal method for the detection of potentially pathogenic vibrios
   other than V. cholerae and V. parahaemobeticus was proposed. Both parts
   of ISO/TS 21872 utilized classical culture-based isolation techniques
   coupled with biochemical confirmation steps. The work also considered
   simplification of the biochemical confirmation steps. In addition,
   because of advances in molecular based methods for identification of
   human pathogenic Vibrio spp. classical and real-time PCR options were
   also included within the scope of the validation. These considerations
   formed the basis of a multi-laboratory validation study with the aim of
   improving the precision of this ISO technical specification and
   providing a single ISO standard method to enable detection of these
   important foodborne Vibrio spp.. To achieve this aim, an international
   validation study involving 13 laboratories from 9 countries in Europe
   was conducted in 2013. The results of this validation have enabled
   integration of the two existing technical specifications targeting the
   detection of the major foodborne Vibrio spp., simplification of the
   suite of recommended biochemical identification tests and the
   introduction of molecular procedures that provide both species level
   identification and discrimination of putatively pathogenic strains of V.
   parahaentolyticus by the determination of the presence of theromostable
   direct and direct related haemolysins. The method performance
   characteristics generated in this have been included in revised
   international standard, ISO 21872:2017, published in July 2017.},

Abstract = {Background: Toxoplasmosis is one of the most frequent parasitic
   infections in animals causing reproductive disorders and thus notable
   economic losses in productivity. Among food animals, pigs along with
   sheep and goats possess the highest incidence of Toxoplasma gondii cysts
   in meat, and play a role as a source of human infection. Methods: The
   commercial ELISA kit (PrioCHECK (R) Toxoplasma Ab SR, Prionics
   Schlieren-Zurich, Switzerland) for the detection of specific antibodies
   against T. gondii in swine serum was compared with a commercial IFAT
   (indirect fluorescent antibody test) (Toxo-Spot IF, bioMerieux, France),
   used as the reference test. Results: The kappa value obtained comparing
   the results performed on sera by ELISA with the by IFAT was 1. By a
   receiver operating characteristics curve analysis, the commercial ELISA
   had a relative sensitivity of 100\%, and a relative specificity of 100\%
   respect to IFAT. Conclusions: The commercial ELISA showed a very good
   agreement with the commercial IFAT in the detection of serum antibodies
   to Toxoplasma in pigs. Our study confirmed the usefulness of the
   commercial ELISA kit for the detection of antibodies against T. gondii
   in pigs, representing a valuable tool to improve the diagnostic activity
   for T. gondii in swine populations at the farm level or at the
   slaughterhouse, contributing to the control of this widespread
   infection.},

Abstract = {The increased resistance to disease observed after monensin treatment
   could reflect a reduction of inflammation and oxidative stress. We
   hypothesised that if monensin supplementation was given before calving,
   it would help in controlling inflammation, reduce the susceptibility to
   disease and increase the performance. Fourteen pregnant heifers (PR) and
   24 multiparous cows (ML) were randomly assigned to a treated group (Mon)
   or a control group (Ctr). The Mon group received 32.4 g of monensin in a
   controlled-release capsule 21 days before calving (expected release
   rate, 335 mg/d for 95 days). Their health status, rumination activity,
   and plasma parameters were monitored from -28 to 56 days from calving.
   The milk yield (MY), milk composition, and cheese-making properties were
   also monitored. Rumen samples were collected at 30 days from calving to
   assess the volatile fatty acids composition and investigate
   immunological parameters. After calving, the Mon group had fewer
   clinical diseases, an increased rumination time, and a higher MY.
   Monensin reduced the infiltration of both T and B cells in rumen fluid.
   In ML, the Mon group had lower levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate in the
   early postpartum period and a lower level of total reactive oxygen
   species. Of PR, the Mon group had a tendency for lower levels of
   nonesterified fatty acids, higher levels of ceruloplasmin after the
   first month of lactation, a tendency for lower levels of paraoxonase,
   higher levels of gamma-glutamyl transferase and higher levels of total
   reactive oxygen species. Monensin treatment decreased the cheese-making
   properties in the milk of PR.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine whether buffalo heifers
   maintained at a constant live weight (LW) and body condition score (BCS)
   by a restricted diet show changes in reproductive function in response
   to changes in day length. Heifers were fed a low energy diet (86\% daily
   intake recommended for the species) throughout the study, which involved
   an 8-week period of decreasing day length and a 7-week period of
   increasing day length. Weekly, LW, BCS and ovarian follicular/oocyte
   population were assessed. Blood and follicular fluid samples were taken
   at the time of ovum pick-up for hormone analyses and at 30-day intervals
   to measure metabolic substrates. Buffalo heifers maintained LW and BCS
   throughout the study and blood concentrations of the main metabolic
   hormones, such as GH, insulin, IGF-1 and thyroid hormones were not
   influenced by photoperiod. Likewise, there were no differences in
   metabolic substrates such as glucose, NEFA, triglycerides and HDL
   cholesterol, suggesting that the metabolic condition remained
   essentially the same. During increasing day length periods, the number
   of total follicles (8.4 +/- 0.5 vs. 11.9 +/- 0.6; p < .01),
   cumulus-oocyte complexes (2.2 +/- 0.3 vs 4.3 +/- 0.5; p < .01) and
   superior quality Grade A + B COCs (0.2 +/- 0.1 vs 1.1 +/- 0.2; p < .01)
   decreased. These features were associated to reduced oestradiol levels
   both in plasma (3.9 +/- 0.4 vs 9.2 +/- 0.5 pg/mL; p < .01) and
   follicular fluid (49.7 +/- 12.9 vs. 109.1 +/- 25.8 ng/mL; p = .05), as
   well as to reduced intrafollicular IGF-1 levels (45.5 +/- 4.0 vs. 58.5
   +/- 3.9 ng/mL; p < .05). These findings suggest that the ovarian
   function in buffalo heifers is influenced by photoperiod independent of
   nutritional and metabolic status.},

Abstract = {Contagious agalactia (CA), a disease caused by Mycoplasma agalactiae and
   other pathogenic mycoplasmas, is a well-known multietiological syndrome
   affecting dairy breeds of sheep and goats in the Mediterranean basin.
   The aim of this work was to study the effect on milk production and
   composition of mastitis caused by M. agalactiae in Valle del Belice
   dairy sheep. All ewes were manually milked twice daily and the milk from
   both daily milking was analysed for milk composition and somatic cell
   counts. Moreover the morning milk samples were collected aseptically
   from each animal for bacteriological analyses. A mixed linear model was
   utilised to consider milk production and composition between animals
   infected by CA and healthy animals. After bacteriological investigation
   using both cultural and molecular methods, 37 ewes were found to be
   infected by M. agalactiae while 50 uninfected ewes were randomly
   selected from the same herds to compare milk production and composition
   between infected and healthy animals. Statistical analyses showed that
   the infection with M. agalactiae had a significant effect on yield and
   some milk components. In particular, infected ewes showed lower milk
   production with lower lactose content and higher somatic cell counts.
   The implementation of disease control programmes based on rapid
   laboratory diagnosis and modern control methods is desirable for
   Mediterranean endemic areas.},

Abstract = {The multifunctional virion protein 35 (VP35) of ebolaviruses is a
   critical determinant of virulence and pathogenesis indispensable for
   viral replication and host innate immune evasion. Essential for VP35
   function is homo-oligomerization via a coiled-coil motif. Here we report
   crystal structures of VP35 oligomerization domains from the prototypic
   Ebola virus (EBOV) and the non-pathogenic Reston virus (RESTV), together
   with a comparative biophysical characterization of the domains from all
   known species of the Ebolavirus genus. EBOV and RESTV VP35
   oligomerization domains form bipartite parallel helix bundles with a
   canonical coiled coil in the N-terminal half and increased plasticity in
   the highly conserved C-terminal half. The domain assembles into trimers
   and tetramers in EBOV, whereas it exclusively forms tetramers in all
   other ebolavirus species. Substitution of coiled-coil leucine residues
   critical for immune antagonism leads to aberrant oligomerization. A
   conserved arginine involved in inter-chain salt bridges stabilizes the
   VP35 oligomerization domain and modulates between coiled-coil oligomeric
   states.},

Abstract = {A rapid and sensitive method for the confirmatory analysis of eight
   synthetic corticosteroids (betamethasone, dexamethasone, prednisolone,
   6-methylprednisolone, triamcinolone, flumethasone, beclomethasone,
   fluocinolone acetonide) is proposed. The method is useful for detecting
   illegal treatments in different animal species. It consists of an
   extraction and cleanup using the quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged,
   and safe (QuEChERS) strategy. Quantitative determination is achieved by
   ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution
   mass spectrometry with heated electrospray ionization in negative mode.
   Quantification is performed using surrogate matrix-matched standard
   calibration curve with dexamethasone-D-4 as the internal standard. The
   method was validated for analyzing liver samples according to the
   criteria established by Decision 2002/657/EC. Linearity was assessed in
   the 1-10gkg(-1) range and linear correlation coefficients were over 0.99
   for all the analytes. CC ranged from 0.04 to 0.16gkg(-1) for substances
   without maximum residue limit. The method allows confident
   quantification and confirmation of corticosteroids in liver samples, and
   its simplicity makes it suitable for analyzing large numbers of samples.},

Abstract = {The health status of the honey bee populations has attracted a great
   amount of interest in recent years. We investigated honey bee health in
   five natural protected areas in Italy from October 2009 to December
   2010. Areas were selected to represent a wide range of bio-geographical
   zones including alpine, continental, and Mediterranean. Within each of
   these natural protected areas, one apiary of 20 colonies near potential
   pollution sources (e.g., agricultural areas, industrial areas, or urban
   settlements) and another apiary of 20 colonies far from possible sources
   of pollutants have been placed. To monitor honey bee health, colony
   mortality was related to: honey bee pathologies, environment (Naturality
   Index, plant protection products and heavy metal exposure), and apiary
   management. Anthropogenic pollutants and pathogens did not have
   significant effects on colony mortality while environment and the poor
   colony management skills of the beekeepers did.},

Title = {Interobserver agreement and sensitivity to climatic conditions in
   sheltered dogs' welfare evaluation performed with welfare assessment
   protocol (Shelter Quality protocol)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VETERINARY BEHAVIOR-CLINICAL APPLICATIONS AND RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {29},
Pages = {45-52},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {The Shelter Quality protocol (SQP) is a concise and easily implemented
   tool for assessing dog welfare and to identify critical aspects of the
   shelter environment. A first version of the protocol has been modified
   to improve its performance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   reliability of the measures included in the second version of the
   protocol (SQP2) by testing the interobserver agreement between two
   independent assessors. We evaluated the sensitivity of animal-based
   measures in detecting the shelter dogs' welfare outputs during two
   different seasons. Ten Italian shelters were assessed contemporaneously
   by two assessors to determine the reliability of SQP2 measures.
   Interobserver agreement was evaluated using the Cohen's kappa for
   qualitative variables and Pearson' correlation for quantitative
   variables. The SQP2 was also applied twice (January and August) by the
   same observer in five Italian shelters to evaluate the sensitivity of
   the protocol to seasonal condition changes. The quantitative variables,
   ``Number of animals shivering/huddling{''} and ``Number of animals
   panting{''} were analyzed by Wilcoxon test. Credible intervals (95\%)
   were calculated using a beta distribution for qualitative variables:
   ``Body condition{''}, ``Skin condition{''}, ``Dog cleanliness{''},
   ``Signs of diarrhea{''}, ``Coughing{''}, and ``Lameness{''}. The level
   of agreement between the two observers on the qualitative variables such
   as body condition, lameness, skin condition, was quite high, ranging
   from substantial (0.61-0.80) to almost perfect (0.81-0.99).
   Interobserver agreement was also significant with Pearson correlation
   coefficients ranging from 0.51 to 0.92 (e.g., curious = 0.74; sociable =
   0.83; barking level = 0.61). ``Number of animals panting{''} and ``Signs
   of diarrhea{''} showed a significant difference between the assessments
   (P<0.05). The observations of animals with lameness, coughing, and
   inadequate body condition increased in the winter season, whereas the
   observations of animals with skin lesions increased during the summer,
   but not significantly. The behaviors of shivering/huddling were observed
   too infrequently to be meaningfully analyzed. Consistent interobserver
   agreement exists in assessing dogs' welfare using the SQP2 confirming
   the reliability of the measures included in the protocol. The SQP2 shows
   potential in detecting changes in dogs' welfare outputs due to different
   climatic conditions. Further investigations are required to confirm the
   sensitivity of selected measures to different seasons. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Title = {Biology and distribution of Danube barbel (Barbus balcanicus)

Journal = {EUROPEAN ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL},

Volume = {86},

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Presence of Danube barbel Barbus balcanicus was investigated at the
   westernmost portion of its distribution area (Italian portion of the
   Isonzo River Basin). Genetic analyses carried out on specimens collected
   in different watercourses confirmed B. balcanicus presence in the same
   locations where Barbus caninus was erroneously classified in the past.
   More precisely, 4 Cyt b haplotypes belonging to the Balkanic species
   were described, three of which were evidenced for the first time.
   Analysis of meristic characters also confirmed genetic results and
   completed the taxonomical assessment. At the same time, a target
   population was studied to deepen knowledge about the species ecology. In
   this case, 120 specimens belonging to five age classes (from 0+ to 4+)
   were collected with monthly frequency in Barbucina Creek, representing
   the model watercourse inhabited by the species in the study area.
   Regression between total weight (W) and standard length (S-L) did not
   differ significantly between males and females, therefore not displaying
   sexual dimorphism. S-L values showed wide ranges, often overlapping
   among age classes. Mean condition factor (Kmean) decreased significantly
   with growth and age, as small individuals were in better nutritional
   condition. From an ecological point of view, biometric parameters seemed
   to be affected by habitat conditions and, specifically, to the limited
   space of the creeks, rather than by trophic conditions. Finally, trends
   of gonadosomatic index (GSI) showed that B. balcanicus reproductive
   period stretches between April and late May/early June. Results
   indicated that sexual maturity is reached at 1+ age, corresponding to a
   mean standard length equal to 5.50 +/- 0.66 for female and 5.71 +/- 0.53
   for male breeders. In conclusion, experimental results highlighted the
   presence and adaptability of this ``forgotten{''} species of the Italian
   fish fauna, which certainly will deserve attention in a future amendment
   of the Italian IUCN Red List of vertebrates.},

Title = {Preliminary Observations of the Effect of Garlic on Egg Shedding in
   Horses Naturally Infected by Intestinal Strongyles},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EQUINE VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {72},
Pages = {79-83},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Intestinal strongyles are the most common endoparasites of horses, and
   anthelmintic treatments are the main strategy to control these
   nematodes. However, the development of anthelmintic resistance has led
   to a decreased efficacy of synthetic drugs, and for this reason, there
   is a growing interest in alternative control strategies as the use of
   medicinal plants. The aim of the present study was to determine the in
   vivo efficacy of garlic (Allium sativum) in horses naturally infected by
   intestinal strongyles. The field trial was conducted in a horse trotter
   farm in Southern Italy. Fifteen mares were selected based on fecal egg
   count >200 eggs per gram and allocated into three groups of five
   animals: fresh garlic group (FG group), animals received 40 g of fresh
   crushed garlic once daily for 15 days; dry garlic group (DG group),
   animals received 40 g of commercial dry garlic flakes food supplement
   once daily for 15 days; and control group (C group), not treated. Two
   weeks after the first administration of garlic, fecal egg count
   reduction test showed failure of garlic to reduce intestinal strongyles
   egg shedding (-11.7\% and -19.4\% for FG and DG groups, respectively).
   Red blood cell count values were in the normal ranges over the entire
   period of garlic administration. In our study model, the oral
   administration of garlic formulations has no effect on reducing the egg
   shedding of intestinal strongyles, and the garlic supplementation over a
   short period of time is not responsible for hematological changes in
   horses. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Equine Adipose-Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Release Extracellular
   Vesicles Enclosing Different Subsets of Small RNAs},
Journal = {STEM CELLS INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2019},
Abstract = {Background. Equine adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (e-AdMSC)
   exhibit attractive proregenerative properties strongly related to the
   delivery of extracellular vesicles (EVs) that enclose different kinds of
   molecules including RNAs. In this study, we investigated small RNA
   content of EVs produced by e-AdMSC with the aim of speculating on their
   possible biological role. Methods. EVs were obtained by
   ultracentrifugation of the conditioned medium of e-AdMSC of 4 subjects.
   Transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were
   performed to assess their size and nanostructure. RNA was isolated,
   enriched for small RNAs (<200nt), and sequenced by Illumina technology.
   After bioinformatic analysis with state-of-the-art pipelines for short
   sequences, mapped reads were used to describe EV RNA cargo, reporting
   classes, and abundances. Enrichment analyses were performed to infer
   involved pathways and functional categories. Results. Electron
   microscopy showed the presence of vesicles ranging in size from 30 to
   300nm and expressing typical markers. RNA analysis revealed that
   ribosomal RNA was the most abundant fraction, followed by small
   nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs, 13.67\%). Miscellaneous RNA (misc\_RNA) reached
   4.57\% of the total where Y RNA, RNaseP, and vault RNA represented the
   main categories. miRNAs were sequenced at a lower level (3.51\%) as well
   as protein-coding genes (1.33\%). Pathway analyses on the protein-coding
   fraction revealed a significant enrichment for the ribosome pathway
   followed by oxidative phosphorylation. Gene Ontology analysis showed
   enrichment for terms like extracellular exosome, organelle envelope, RNA
   binding, and small molecule metabolic process. The miRNA target pathway
   analysis revealed the presence of signaling pathways regulating
   pluripotency of stem cells coherent with the source of the samples.
   Conclusion. We herein demonstrated that e-AdMSC release EVs enclosing
   different subsets of small RNAs that potentially regulate a number of
   biological processes. These findings shed light on the role of EVs in
   the context of MSC biology.},

Title = {Impact of DNA purification method and primer selection on 16S rRNA gene
   metabarcoding on wine},
Journal = {OENO ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {53},
Number = {3},
Pages = {511-517},
Abstract = {Aim: The high-throughput sequencing methods have revolutionized the
   study of the microbiota in different matrices including those of the
   grapevine production chain. DNA extraction is a crucial step in the
   sample processing. In this study, we compared different DNA purification
   methods and two primer sets for 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding to evaluate
   the best protocol to explore the wine microbiota by metabarcoding.
   Methods and results: We collected a wine from Barbera grapes after
   malolactic fermentation previously inoculated by Oenococcus oeni
   starter. The same sample was used to evaluate the best performing
   protocol to study the wine microbiota. DNA was purified using nine
   different methods and then amplified for the 16S rRNA gene with two
   primer sets (according to Illumina or Earth Microbiome Project
   protocols). The obtained amplicons were then sequenced in a single
   sequencing session on an Illumina MiSeq. We evaluated the best protocol
   considering DNA concentration and purity, alpha (Observed species) and
   beta diversity from metabarcoding analysis.
   The sequencing generated 36,031,756 reads in total. Although no
   statistically significant difference was observed between purification
   methods or primer sets, better results were obtained with
   phenol-chloroform DNA purification combined to Earth Microbiome Project
   primers.
   Metabarcoding was able to highlight the domination of the inoculum, O.
   oeni, representing the main species of the analyzed wine microbiota.
   Conclusion: Our data show that, for the tested wine, metabarcoding
   output is more influenced by the primer set than by the DNA purification
   method. Moreover, the metabarcoding detected that O. oeni represents the
   main species, evidencing the domination of the inoculum done with
   lyophilized commercial preparation of this species. Other lactic acid
   bacteria are present at a much lower abundance.
   Significance and impact of the study: This is the fast report applying
   the 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding to study the microbiota of wine. For
   this reason, the evaluation of alternative methods for DNA processing is
   essential for future research using this innovative methodology.},

Abstract = {Border disease virus (BDV) is widespread both in domestic small
   ruminants and wildlife. Here we report the genome of BDV genotype 8 from
   chamois, strain Italy-58987, obtained by next generation sequencing and
   the comparison with other pestiviruses. The sequence of 12,245 bp long
   was aligned to 22 pestivirus genomes and it showed a nt/aa similarity of
   81.3/89.4\% with BDV genotypes, and 65.9/67.8\% with the other
   pestiviruses. The genome showed a mean nt/aa similarity of 91.2/95.0\%
   with three Swiss genomes closely related to the BDV-8 5'-UTR and Npro
   sequences. The identification of divergent BDV-8 isolates in
   North-Western Italy and in Switzerland suggests that this genotype may
   have been circulating in a wider area than previously supposed, and may
   have a high host adaptability.},

Abstract = {Monitoring environmental contaminants in edible animal species is

   safety as well. In this study, the occurrence of 2,3,7,8 dioxins, and
   furans, dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls, six non-dioxin-like
   polychlorinated biphenyl indicators (ndl-PCBs), seven polybrominated
   diphenylethers (PBDEs), four polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and
   four metals (As, Hg, Ni, Pb) was evaluated in 90 European eels (Anguilla
   anguilla) from Lake Garda. The results on eel samples showed a frequent
   contamination of dl-PCBs, found at concentrations higher than the
   maximum limit (ML) provided by European Union in 41 \% of the eels. Two
   PBDE congeners (BDE 47 and BDE 99) were detected in almost all the
   samples. The contamination by PAHs was found negligible; only one sample
   had a high concentration of benzo{[}a]pyrene. Concerning metals, Pb
   showed concentrations higher than the maximum level (ML) in 77\% of the
   samples, while Ni content could be a cause of acute toxicity due to
   dermatitis. Extreme consumers (95th percentile) are subjected to an
   actual risk attributable to dioxins, furans, and mainly dl-PCBs and
   PBDEs. The contamination of Lake Garda eels is therefore a matter of
   concern and a constant monitoring of the pollution levels of its
   freshwater is mandatory.},

Abstract = {Simple Summary Anticipatory behaviour to an oncoming food reward can be
   triggered via classical conditioning, implies the activation of neural
   networks, and may serve to study the emotional state of animals. This
   work aimed to investigate how the anticipatory response affects cerebral
   cortex activity in sheep. Eight ewes were conditioned to associate a
   neutral auditory stimulus (water bubble) to a food reward (maize
   grains). Then, sheep were trained to wait 15 s before accessing the food
   (anticipatory phase). Behavioural reaction and changes in cortical
   oxy-haemoglobin ({[}O(2)Hb]) and deoxy-haemoglobin ({[}HHb])
   concentration were recorded by functional near infrared spectroscopy
   (fNIRS). During the anticipatory phase, sheep increased their active
   behaviour together with a cortical activation (increase of {[}O(2)Hb]
   and a decrease of {[}HHb]) compared to baseline. Sheep showed a greater
   response of the right hemisphere compared to the left hemisphere,
   possibly indicating frustration. Behavioural and cortical changes
   observed during anticipation of a food reward reflect a learnt
   association and an increased arousal, but no clear emotional valence of
   the sheep subjective experience.
   Abstract Anticipatory behaviour to an oncoming food reward can be
   triggered via classical conditioning, implies the activation of neural
   networks, and may serve to study the emotional state of animals. The aim
   of this study was to investigate how the anticipatory response to a food
   reward affects the cerebral cortex activity in sheep. Eight ewes from
   the same flock were trained to associate a neutral auditory stimulus
   (water bubble) to the presence of a food reward (maize grains). Once
   conditioned, sheep were trained to wait 15 s behind a gate before
   accessing a bucket with food (anticipation phase). For 6 days, sheep
   were submitted to two sessions of six consecutive trials each.
   Behavioural reaction was filmed and changes in cortical oxy- and
   deoxy-hemoglobin concentration ({[}O(2)Hb] and {[}HHb] respectively)
   following neuronal activation were recorded by functional near infrared
   spectroscopy (fNIRS). Compared to baseline, during the anticipation
   phase sheep increased their active behaviour, kept the head oriented to
   the gate (Wilcoxon's signed rank test; p 0.001), and showed more
   asymmetric ear posture (Wilcoxon's signed rank test; p 0.01), most
   likely reflecting a learnt association and an increased arousal. Results
   of trial-averaged {[}O(2)Hb] and {[}HHb] within individual sheep showed
   in almost every sheep a cortical activation during the anticipation
   phase (Student T-test; p 0.05). The sheep showed a greater response of
   the right hemisphere compared to the left hemisphere, possibly
   indicating a negative affective state, such as frustration. Behavioural
   and cortical changes observed during anticipation of a food reward
   reflect a learnt association and an increased arousal, but no clear
   emotional valence of the sheep subjective experience. Future work should
   take into consideration possible factors affecting the accurateness of
   measures, such as probe's location and scalp vascularization.},

Abstract = {A survey of BPA, BPB, BPF, BADGE and BFDGE contamination in canned beers
   from the Italian market is reported. An analytical method for the
   determination of these five bisphenols down to 0.5 ng mL(-1) using UPLC
   with fluorescence detection was developed and validated. A total of 40
   canned beers were collected from the market in Southern Italy and
   analysed. The results showed that only 14 samples were contaminated at
   concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 ng mL(-1) by at least BPA, BPF
   and BADGE. No contamination by BPB and BFDGE was detected. This survey
   suggests that canned beers from the Italian market should represent
   neither a relevant source of intake of bisphenols nor a risk for
   consumer's health.},

Abstract = {During the last few decades native European hares (Lepus europaeus) have
   declined in Central and Northern Italy. Despite this trend having
   multiple causes, it was hypothesized that invasive Eastern cottontails
   (Sylvilagus floridanus) contributed to the decline through apparent
   competition and disease transmission. In this research we explored
   whether cottontails may act as carriers of EBHSV (European Brown Hare
   Syndrome Virus) and RHDV (Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease Virus), the viral
   agents of two major diseases affecting lagomorphs in Europe. We took
   biological samples from 267 cottontails that were shot between March and
   August 2015 in Tuscany, performing specific antigenic and serological
   ELISA tests for both viruses as well as molecular investigation for
   lagoviruses. Virologic tests were all negative and serological titers
   were below the threshold that could indicate the active circulation of
   either of the two pathogenic viruses. Our findings suggest that
   cottontails were not playing an active role as carriers or reservoirs
   for both known virulent lagoviruses and were also not infected with
   non-pathogenic lagoviruses - at least at that time in the study area.},

Abstract = {The redclaw crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus (von Martens, 1868) is one
   of the most commonly exploited freshwater crayfish species worldwide.
   Redclaw crayfish are susceptible to a number of pathogens but none have
   been linked to widespread epizootics. Mycobacterial in-fections have
   been sporadically reported in crayfish. In the case described,
   histopathology and bacterial identification confirmed an opportunistic
   infection caused by Mycobacterium gordonae in a hatchery of C.
   quadricarinatus in Israel. Intranuclear inclusion bodies, recorded in
   cells of the tubular epithelium of the hepatopancreas by histopathology,
   indicate a co-infection with a viral agent, referable to C.
   quadricarinatus bacilliform virus (CqBV). To the best of our knowledge
   this is the first description of mycobacteriosis in redclaw crayfish.},

Abstract = {Swine influenza viruses (SIVs) have been repeatedly demonstrated to
   circulate in wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations, whereas no evidence of
   exposure to avian influenza viruses (AIVs) has been described in wild
   boar. To better understand how different environments may influence the
   ecology of influenza A viruses (IAVs) in wild suid populations, we
   examined biologic samples of wild boars from two study areas represented
   by an upland (UL) and a wetland (WL) in northern and central Italy,
   respectively. Serum samples were collected from 388 wild boars sampled
   in the UL, whereas both a serum sample and a nasal swab were obtained
   from each of 35 wild boars sampled in the WL. Twenty of 388 (5.2\%) sera
   from the UL were positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the
   presence of antibodies against influenza A nucleoprotein and some of
   these samples showed antibodies by hemagglutination inhibition to SIVs
   of H1N1 (1/20), H1N2 (10/20), and H3N2 (1/20) antigenic subtypes. No
   IAV-seropositive wild boar was detected in the WL, although one of 35
   animals was found to be IAV-positive by both a reverse transcriptase PCR
   and a real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. We hypothesize an SIV
   exposure for IAV-seropositive wild boars occupying the UL, whereas a
   possible AIV spillover from aquatic bird species-natural reservoirs of
   IAVs-to wild boars in the WL cannot be ruled out. Further research is
   needed to better understand the role played by wild boars in IAV ecology
   in Mediterranean habitats.},

Abstract = {The identification of avian poxvirus and avian papillomavirus associated
   with cutaneous lesions in griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) by
   histopathology, electron microscopy and PCR analysis is reported.
   Sequence analysis of the fpv140 gene revealed 99\% identity to two
   poxviruses obtained from a white-tailed sea eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla)
   and a common buzzard (Buteo buteo). Partial sequence of the
   papillomavirus L1 gene showed sequence similarity to papillomavirus LI
   genes from African grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus) (69\% identity),
   duck (Anas platyrhynchos) (68\% identity), and yellow-necked francolin
   (Francolinus leucoscepus) (66\% identity). To date, this is the first
   identification of avian poxvirus and papillomavirus in griffon vultures
   and the first evidence of infection of both viruses in live wild birds.},

Abstract = {Expansion in global rabbit populations and in the number of rabbits
   raised for consumption necessitates assessment of the environmental
   impact and sustainability of rabbit production systems. This study
   undertook two evaluations: utilization (animal efficiency) of organic
   matter (OM) and nitrogen (N) produced from feed during rabbit fattening,
   and emission of ammonia (NH3), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and
   nitrous oxide (N2O) from rabbit manure during its storage and land
   application in laboratory-simulated conditions. Results demonstrated
   manure contained approximately 30 and 65\% of the OM and N in the daily
   feed intake, respectively. Additionally, rabbit manure was shown to
   produce sizeable NH3 and GHG emissions. Specifically, cumulative N
   losses from storage and subsequent land application averaged 32.4 (NH3)
   and 2.2\% (N2O) of excreted TN; cumulative proportions of OM lost as CO2
   and CH4 averaged 51.3 and 0.4\%, respectively. Finally, while manure
   incorporation into the soil effectively abated NH3 emissions, it also
   showed its potential to increase N2O losses, a potent greenhouse gas
   (GHG). Future research should focus on identifying appropriate emission
   mitigation measures. Accurate field-scale measurements are also needed
   to make data available for the development of a reliable national
   emission inventory of the investigated gases.},

Title = {Biomimetic hydroxyapatite nanocrystals are an active carrier for
   Salmonella bacteriophages},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Pages = {2219-2232},
Abstract = {Purpose: The use of bacteriophages represents a valid alternative to
   conventional antimicrobial treatments, overcoming the widespread
   bacterial antibiotic resistance phenomenon. In this work, we evaluated
   whether biomimetic hydroxyapatite (HA) nanocrystals are able to enhance
   some properties of bacteriophages. The final goal of this study was to
   demonstrate that biomimetic HA nanocrystals can be used for
   bacteriophage delivery in the context of bacterial infections, and
   contribute - at the same time - to enhance some of the biological
   properties of the same bacteriophages such as stability, preservation,
   antimicrobial activity, and so on.
   Materials and methods: Phage isolation and characterization were carried
   out by using Mitomycin C and following double-layer agar technique. The
   biomimetic HA water suspension was synthesized in order to obtain
   nanocrystals with plate-like morphology and nanometric dimensions. The
   interaction of phages with the HA was investigated by dynamic light
   scattering and Zeta potential analyses. The cytotoxicity and
   intracellular killing activities of the phage-HA complex were evaluated
   in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. The bacterial inhibition
   capacity of the complex was assessed on chicken minced meat samples
   infected with Salmonella Rissen.
   Results: Our data highlighted that the biomimetic HA
   nanocrystal-bacteriophage complex was more stable and more effective
   than phages alone in all tested experimental conditions.
   Conclusion: Our results evidenced the important contribution of
   biomimetic HA nanocrystals: they act as an excellent carrier for
   bacteriophage delivery and enhance its biological characteristics. This
   study confirmed the significant role of the mineral HA when it is
   complexed with biological entities like bacteriophages, as it has been
   shown for molecules such as lactoferrin.},

Title = {Relationship between Protein Oxidation Biomarkers and Uterine Health in
   Dairy Cows during the Postpartum Period},
Journal = {ANTIOXIDANTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {High neutrophil (PMN, Polymorphonuclear neutrophil) counts in the
   endometrium of cows affected by endometritis, suggests the involvement
   of oxidative stress (OS) among the causes of impaired fertility. Protein
   oxidation, in particular, advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP),
   are OS biomarkers linked to PMN activity. To test this hypothesis, the
   relationship between protein oxidation and uterus health was studied in
   thirty-eight dairy cows during the puerperium. The animals were found to
   be cycling, without any signs of disease and pharmacological treatments.
   PMN count was performed either through a cytobrush or a uterine horn
   lavage (UHL). Cows were classified into four groups, based on the
   uterine ultrasonographic characteristics and the PMN percentage in the
   uterine horns with a higher percentage of high neutrophil horn (HNH).
   They were classified as: Healthy (H); Subclinical Endometritis (SCE);
   Grade 1 Endometritis (EM1); and Grade 2 Endometritis (EM2). AOPP and
   carbonyls were measured in plasma and UHL. UHL samples underwent Western
   blot analysis to visualize the carbonyl and dityrosine formation. Plasma
   AOPP were higher (p < 0.05) in EM2. AOPP and carbonyl group
   concentrations were higher in the HNH samples (p < 0.05). Protein
   concentration in the UHL was higher in the EM2 (p < 0.05). Carbonyl and
   dityrosine formation was more intense in EM1 and EM2. Protein oxidation
   observed in the EM2 suggests the presence of an inflammatory status in
   the uterus which, if not adequately hindered, could result in low
   fertility.},

Abstract = {The monitoring of the contamination levels of bisphenol A (BPA) and its
   congeners bisphenol B (BPB) and bisphenol F (BPF) in foodstuffs is a
   necessary process for assessment of consumers' risk. After development
   and validation of a method using Strata (R) C18-E cartridge cleanup with
   detection by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry,
   forty-six samples of fruit juices, sold on Italian markets, have been
   analysed to assess the concentration of BPA, BPB and BPF. BPB and BPF
   were not detected in any samples, BPA was found in 33 \% of the samples.
   The observed levels ranged from 0.50 ng mL(-1) to 2.85 ng mL(-1).
   Potential Daily Intakes (PDI) of BPA for Italian populations were
   calculated by the budget method model. PDIs ranged from 0.012 to 0.285
   mu g kg(-1) bw day(-1). None of the calculated values exceeded the
   current temporary TDI of 4 mu g kg(-1) bw day(-1).},

Abstract = {Q fever is a widespread zoonotic disease caused by Coxiella burnetii, an
   obligate intracellular bacterium with a wide range of hosts. The aim of
   this study was to estimate the seroprevalence of C. burnetii infection
   in cattle in Sicilian farms. A total of 4,661 serum samples, from cattle
   belonging to 198 Sicilian farms, were examined by ELISA test and 246
   resulted positive. The average seroprevalence at the farm level was
   38.8\% (77/198) (95\% CI), while at the animal level it was 5.28\%
   (246/4,661) (95\% CI). The present study highlights the need for
   continuous monitoring of C. burnetii spread as it represents a serious
   risk for human health.},

Abstract = {In 2015, a young female Alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra rupicapra),
   originated from the Aosta Valley Region, Northernwestern Italy, was
   conferred to the National Reference Centre for Wild Animal Diseases for
   pathologic examinations. Histological analysis revealed a severe
   meningoencephalitis characterized by lymphocytic and plasmacellular
   infiltration, gliosis, perivascular cuffs, and leptomeningitis at the
   level of brain and brain stem. Laboratory investigations included
   polymerase chain reaction, sequencing and characterization by
   phylogenetic analysis, and evaluation of the internal ribosome entry
   site secondary structure in the 5' untranslated region. These tests
   identified the pathological agent as border disease virus, a known
   health risk in domestic small ruminants. Genetic characteristics of the
   isolated strains, closely related to ovine and caprine strain sequences
   from neighboring regions of Piedmont, France, and Switzerland, suggested
   geographic segregation and micro-evolutive steps within the species.},

   HPLC-UV-DIODE array detection},
Journal = {METHODSX},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {856-861},
Abstract = {The use of food dyes in meat is regulated by the current European and
   non-European legislation, due to several food safety concerns. A
   reliable method for the quali-quantitative determination of 12 food dyes
   (Amaranth, Ponceau 4R, Carmine, Ponceau SX, Ponceau 3R, Allura Red AC,
   Carmoisine, Erythrosine, Sudan 1, Sudan 11, Sudan 111 and Sudan IV) in
   meat products, by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to UV
   diode array detection is presented. The extraction was accomplished by
   using acetonitrile, methanol, water, and ammonia, 50:40:9:1 (v/v/v/v) as
   the solvent and ultrasonic bath. The chromatographic separation was
   obtained with a C-18 RP column eluted by a gradient of acetate
   buffer/acetonitrile. Good analytical performances characterized this
   method (Table 1), in terms of selectivity, sensitivity, accuracy and
   ruggedness. Both method precision (CV\% range: 6\%-15\%) and recovery
   percentages (range: 86\%-105\%) resulted in compliance with Decision
   2002/657/EC, and the expanded measurement uncertainties, estimated by a
   bottom-up approach, were in the range 6\%-20\%. All these results
   demonstrated that the procedure can be applied successfully for
   confirmation analyses of commercial meat products.
   12 food dyes were determined in meat by new HPLC/UV-DAD method.
   The analytical method was fully validated for accurate confirmation
   analyses.
   Method accuracy, sensitivity, selectivity and ruggedness resulted
   satisfactory. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {This study aims at enumerating coagulase positive staphylococci (CPS) in
   404 samples of milk and dairy products collected in own-checks or during
   the official controls from different dairy industries located in Central
   Italy. These microorganisms were enumerated using ISO 6888-2:1999/Amd.
   1:2003 and only when they exceeded 10(b) CFU/g, the presence of any of
   the seven more common staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEA, SEB, SEC1, SEC2,
   SEC3, SED and SEE) was also investigated. Own-checks samples resulted
   always below the detection limit, whereas among those collected by the
   competent authorities in the framework of official controls, provola
   (100\%) and mozzarella (22.9\%) samples were positive to CPS, with mean
   values of 1.8x10(2) and 2.8x10(5) CFU/g respectively. Such values
   exceeded the maximum limits set by Commission Regulation (EC) No.
   2073/2005, resulting in a request of hygiene improvements in the first
   case; in the second case, the presence of staphylococcal enterotoxins in
   8 (2.7\%) mozzarella samples out of 298 investigated cheese products was
   also observed, resulting in their withdrawn from the market. Therefore,
   this study aims at highlighting that monitoring of CPS incidence in
   dairy products and subsequent testing of cheeses for enterotoxins when
   appropriate represent an important tool for public health in order to
   avoid the occurrence of foodborne outbreaks.},

Title = {Active and passive surveillance for bat lyssaviruses in Italy revealed
   serological evidence for their circulation in three bat species},
Journal = {EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {147},
Abstract = {The wide geographical distribution and genetic diversity of
   bat-associated lyssaviruses (LYSVs) across Europe suggest that similar
   viruses may also be harboured in Italian insectivorous bats. Indeed,
   bats were first included within the passive national surveillance
   programme for rabies in wildlife in the 1980s, while active surveillance
   has been performed since 2008. The active surveillance strategies
   implemented allowed us to detect neutralizing antibodies directed
   towards European bat 1 lyssavirus in six out of the nine maternity
   colonies object of the study across the whole country. Seropositive bats
   were Myotis myotis, M. blythii and Tadarida teniotis. On the contrary,
   the virus was neither detected through passive nor active surveillance,
   suggesting that fatal neurological infection is rare also in
   seropositive colonies. Although the number of tested samples has
   steadily increased in recent years, submission turned out to be rather
   sporadic and did not include carcasses from bat species that account for
   the majority of LYSVs cases in Europe, such as Eptesicus serotinus, M.
   daubentonii, M. dasycneme and M. nattereri. A closer collaboration with
   bat handlers is therefore mandatory to improve passive surveillance and
   decrypt the significance of serological data obtained up to now.},

Abstract = {Strain 82(T), a Gram-stain-positive, coagulase-negative staphylococcus
   was isolated from an air sample obtained from an industrial rabbit
   holding in Italy. It is phylogenetically closely related to the
   coagulase-negative species Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus
   xylosus and Staphylococcus edaphicus. However, it could be distinguished
   from these species by sequence differences between the 16S rRNA, hsp60,
   rpoB, dnaJ and gap genes. At the whole genome level, the isolate had an
   average nucleotide identity of <95 \% and an inferred DNA-DNA
   hybridization of <70 \% when compared to these species. Based on the
   genotypic results, it is proposed that this isolate is a novel species,
   with the name Staphylococcus caeli sp. nov. The type strain is 82B(T)

Abstract = {Botulism in cattle is rarely reported in Italy. This study describes an
   outbreak of botulism in a dairy herd in Central Italy in September 2012,
   and the notably high mortality rate it caused. Differential diagnoses
   involving toxicology and bacteriology, and electrolyte imbalances, all
   proved negative. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for
   detecting the BoNT gene led to the identification of the causative agent
   as Clostridium botulinum type DC.The presence of the toxin was confirmed
   subsequently via mouse bioassay. Initially, the peracute deaths and
   ambiguous clinical signs delayed the diagnosis and, as a result, impeded
   identification of the source of the infection on the farm. The severity
   of the outbreak demonstrates that screening for animal botulism should
   always form part of the diagnostic protocols used to investigate sudden
   peracute deaths without apparent cause in livestock.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the content of lead in
   carcasses of wild boars shot with lead bullets, in comparison with that
   of copper caused by lead-free ammunitions. Radiographic images of hunted
   boars were obtained in order to assess the degree of bullet
   fragmentation in the carcasses. Samples of meat were collected from
   different body areas at increasing distance from bullet trajectory, to
   be analysed by ICP-MS for lead and copper levels. In wild boars shot
   with lead ammunitions, a massive dispersion of bullet fragments and very
   high lead levels were detected. By contrast, in wild boars killed with
   copper ammunitions no radiographic signs of bullet fragmentation were
   observed. Copper ammunitions seem therefore a safer alternative to
   standard lead-core ones, due to their minimal fragmentation and the
   relatively low toxicity of this metal.},

Title = {Farm products' direct sale in accordance with national and EC
   Regulations},
Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF FOOD SAFETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {37-45},
Abstract = {Primary production has always been considered the weak link in the
   entire food production chain (from farm to fork) and, due also to the
   grave health and food emergencies that have taken place over the years
   (BSE, dioxin, avian flu etc.), greater attention has been focused on the
   production stage, together with the need to regain the consumers' faith.
   To preserve and support small farms in a local setting and, consistent
   with the aims of flexibility and respecting the main requisites
   contained in the EC Regulations (No. 852/2004; No. 853/2004) (European
   Commission, 2004; 2004a), production is allowed for
   tasting-administration on the premises and the processing and sales of
   agricultural products produced exclusively on the farm, such as: fresh
   meat from poultry and rabbits and small farmed wild animals; processed
   meats obtained from animals raised on the farm and from hunting; fishing
   and aquaculture products; raw milk for direct human consumption and
   dairy products; eggs, honey, fruit and vegetables, woodland products;
   jams and preserved fruit, flours, vegetable preserves, wild above ground
   and underground mushrooms; dried fruits, fruit juices, cereals, syrups;
   oil, wine, bread and baked products. This possibility is reserved for
   individual farmers or co-operatives, registered in the company register
   according to Article 8 of the Law 29th December 1993 No. 580 (Italian
   Republic, 1993); who may sell directly inside and outside farm, products
   coming mainly from the respective farms, observing the current
   regulations regarding health and hygiene. All this should provide an
   instrument for rural and competitive development for the entire European
   agricultural production chain strongly influenced by the marketing
   conditions imposed by the mass retailing groups on their own suppliers.
   Not least is the possibility of creating work and occupation and
   adequately counteracting the phenomenon of the depopulation of the
   countryside, encouraging the return to agricultural activities on the
   part of young people; and, consequently, a form of safeguarding the
   environment by reducing the costs linked to hydro-geological instability
   and soil maintenance. This trend, together with the national directions,
   may represent a support even for small local farms which, taking
   advantage of simplified procedures consistent with the objectives of
   flexibility of the community Regulations (EC) (No. 852/2004; No.
   853/2004) (European Commission, 2004; 2004a), may take part in the
   promotion of agricultural markets managed directly by the farmers as
   sales points for local products (farmers' markets), so as to guarantee a
   fairer price and consolidate the territorial link between production and
   consumption (short distribution chain or short circuit). Without, of
   course, renouncing the necessary prerequisites for placing any food on
   the market: health-hygiene; traceability; health and well-being of the
   animals; safeguarding of the environment and the plants.},

Title = {Immunological response in horses following west Nile virus vaccination

Journal = {VETERINARIA ITALIANA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {55},
Number = {1},
Pages = {73-79},

Abstract = {West Nile virus (WNV) is an RNA virus belonging to Flavivirus genus,
   family Flaviviridae. Transmitted by mosquitoes, the virus may cause
   significant morbidity and mortality in birds, humans and horses. Humans
   and horses are dead-end hosts. As no specific treatment for the disease
   is currently available, preventive measures are critical. In horses the
   prevention can be achieved by minimizing the exposure to the vectors or
   through vaccination. In Europe three products have been registered for
   horses. When used, they are capable of preventing WND clinical signs. To
   evaluate the immunological response following vaccination, 40 WNV
   serologically negative horses were selected and divided in two groups of
   20 animals. One group was vaccinated (booster after 28 days) with a
   whole inactivated viral strain and the second group with a live
   recombinant canarypox virus expressing the genes coding for the WNV
   preM/E viral proteins. IgM, IgG and neutralizing antibodies were
   monitored by class specific ELISAs and serum neutralization assay for
   360 days. In both groups, IgM antibodies were first detected 7 days post
   vaccination lasting up to 42 dpv and 52 dpv in the animals vaccinated
   with the inactivated and the recombinant product respectively. A similar
   (P < 0.05\%) number of horses (30\%; 95\% Confidence interval
   (CI):14.59\%-52.18\%) showed IgM antibodies after vaccination with the
   recombinant vaccine (Rec-WNV) compared to the group (32\%; 95\% CI:
   15.39-54.28\%) vaccinated with the inactivated vaccine (K-WNV). Both
   vaccines induced a detectable IgG antibody response as early as 7 days
   following the vaccinations till the end of the trial. Both vaccines
   induced the rise in neutralizing antibodies even though neutralizing
   antibody responses induced by the live canarypox virus-vectored vaccine
   were higher (mean titres 1:298 vs 1:18.9) and lasted longer than did
   those induced by the killed-virus vaccines. In fact, one year after the
   vaccination, neutralizing antibodies were still detectable in the horses
   which received the canarypox virus-based vaccine but not the group
   vaccinated with the killed product. The use of vaccines is a valuable
   tool to prevent WNV disease in horses and the availability of different
   products facilitate the control of the disease in endemic areas.},

Abstract = {Influenza D virus (IDV) was first reported in 2011 in swine in Oklahoma
   and consequently found in cattle, sheep, and goats across North America
   and Eurasia. Cattle have been proposed as the natural reservoir. In this
   study, we developed and validated a MAb-based competitive ELISA for the
   detection of antibodies against IDV. Thirty-one hybridomas specific to
   IDV were generated using Balb/C mice immunised with purified
   IDV/Swine/Italy/199724-3/2015. The specificity of MAbs was determined by
   comparing their reactivity with the homologous and other influenza A
   viruses along with additional bovine and swine viruses. A solid-phase
   competitive ELISA (IDV-cELISA) was set up using the partially purified
   antigen coated to the plate and incubation of two serum dilutions (1/10
   and 1/20) followed by addition of a peroxidase-conjugated MAb as
   competitor, which had shown wide intratype cross-reactivity and
   positivity in HI. To evaluate the diagnostic performances of IDV-cELISA,
   we used 884 sera (414 negative and 470 positive) from different species.
   ROC analyses were performed to enable the selection of best cut-off
   value and estimation of diagnostic specificity and sensitivity. The
   agreement between IDV-cELISA and HI test was assessed by Cohen's kappa
   value (kappa). The kappa analysis showed an almost perfect agreement
   (kappa = 0.93; 95\%CI -0.899 to 0.961) between HI test and IDV-cELISA.
   ROC analysis showed that IDV-cELISA was accurate with an area under the
   curve (AUC) = 0.999, 95\% CI 0.993-1.000). A cut-off value of 65\% was
   selected with Se and Sp values of 99.35 (95\% CI 98.1-99.9) and 98.75
   (95\% CI 97.1-99.6). These results proved excellent diagnostic
   performances of IDV-cELISA, which compared to HI presented major
   advantages, such as suitability for automation, low dependence on
   individual skills, spectrophotometric reading, and easy interpretation
   of the results. This assay can be exploited to detect anti-IDV
   antibodies in different animal species.},

Abstract = {The study evaluates the efficacy and effects of two organic acid-based
   miticides (Maqs((R)) and Api-Bioxal((R))) used in late summer to reduce
   the population of Varroa destructor mites in colonies of Apis mellifera
   ligustica. The study took place in Albaredo d'Adige (Verona,
   Northeastern Italy). Twenty-six honey bee colonies, divided into four
   groups, were used for the experiment. Miticide efficacy, average daily
   mortality rate of adult bees, and number of bees present in the hives at
   specific timeframes were evaluated. The average daily efficacy of
   Maqs((R))'s miticide proved to be 96.8\% compared to 93.4\% for
   Api-Bioxal((R)) combined with queen caging. High adult honey bee
   mortality was recorded after treatment with Maqs((R)), showing that
   average daily mortality was 82.4\% higher than natural daily mortality.
   Daily mortality for Api-Bioxal((R)) and queen caging was instead 30.1\%
   lower than in non-treated colonies. The average decrease in the colony
   population of the treated groups was higher in the Maqs((R)) (-38\%)
   than in the Api-Bioxal((R)) group (-28\%). The fall in the latter was
   comparable to the values recorded in the control groups (-23\% in the
   Api-Bioxal and -24\% in the Maqs((R)) control groups). Both veterinary
   medicinal products were effective for the control of V. destructor mite
   populations in late summer. However, the important negative effects
   recorded in the Maqs((R)) group discourage the use of this miticide in
   geographical and climatic conditions of the type described in this
   study. Api-Bioxal((R)) in combination with queen caging did instead
   confirm its efficacy and reliability for controlling the infestation in
   Northeastern Italy.},

Abstract = {The Italian National Law on companion animals and stray dog population
   control prohibits euthanasia of shelter dogs if they are not dangerous
   or seriously suffering. Free roaming dogs are captured and housed in
   long-term shelters (LTS) until rehomed, adopted or dead. In, this
   scenario, the sheltered dogs' welfare has become a community of
   scientific interest but few information is available about the human
   sphere in dogs' shelters. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   social relationship between dogs and shelter operators (employees and
   volunteers) in Italian shelters and the impact of their job on their
   quality of life. A questionnaire addressed to shelter operators was
   developed by a multidisciplinary group of experts and it was structured
   in three main sections: general information, operators' skills and
   operators' welfare and emotional sphere. The questionnaire was
   distributed in 64 Italian shelters during the field application of the
   Shelter Quality protocol for the assessment of dogs' welfare in LTS (IZS
   04/13 RC funded by Ministry of Health) that was used to assess the
   welfare of dogs housed in LTS. A descriptive analysis was carried out.
   These results show that Italian shelter operators have a positive
   perception of their job despite a stressful impact on their lives.},

Title = {Identification of virulence and antibiotic resistance factors in
   Arcobacter butzleri isolated from bovine milk by Whole Genome Sequencing},
Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF FOOD SAFETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},

Pages = {60-64},
Abstract = {Arcobacter butzleri is a pathogenic aerobic bacterium responsible for
   diarrhea and septicemia in humans. It is frequently isolated from food
   products of animal origin, including milk and dairy products. To data,
   few reports are currently available on the genetic characteristics and
   virulence profiles of A. butzleri. The aim of this study was to
   investigate the genetic diversity and to characterize the virulence and
   antibiotic resistance profiles of 10 A. butzleri strains isolated from
   bovine milk samples by Whole Genome Sequence (WGS). Multi-Locus Sequence
   Typing (MLST) revealed that three isolates belonged to the ST66, two to
   the ST420 and the remaining five strains to the ST627, ST629, ST630,
   ST633 and ST637, respectively. The 100\% of the strains carried cadF,
   pldA, ciaB, cj1349, mviN and tlyA virulence factors genes; 60\% iroE;
   50\% irgA; 10\% hecB. Resistome prediction showed a multidrug
   resistance: 100\% of isolates resulted resistant to fluoroquinolones and
   tetracycline; 90\% of strains to rifampicin and cephalosporins and a
   minor percentage to other antibiotics. Furthermore, the 50\% of strains
   harbored four mutations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis katG gene
   conferring resistance to isoniazid. The study provided interesting data
   on the virulence characteristics and on the genetic endowment related to
   the antimicrobial resistance of A. butzleri isolates from milk. The
   determination of the STs also added information concerning the genetic
   variability of this microorganism. To date, a very limited number of
   studies have been published on the typing of A. butzleri using WGS, so
   this paper proposes an innovative methodological approach that allows a
   rapid and complete characterization of pathogenic microorganisms.},

Title = {Survival of African swine fever virus (ASFV) in various traditional

Abstract = {A number of animal diseases can be transmitted to pigs via pork meat and
   pork products imported from infected areas. Therefore, feeding of swill
   to pigs is regulated or prohibited in many swine-rearing countries.
   African swine fever is one of the major porcine diseases recognized as
   significant in this transmission pathway. Assessment of disease risks
   associated with pork products requires knowledge about the viral load in
   the original material and for how long infectious virus can be recovered
   from the resulting product. In this work, we present the effect of the
   dry curing process on the inactivation of African swine fever virus
   (ASFV) in three different Italian dry-cured meat products prepared from
   experimentally infected pigs slaughtered at the peak of viremia. The
   meat products were processed using commercial methods and industrial
   procedures currently being followed in Italy. Samples collected at
   predetermined intervals during processing were analyzed for virus
   survival by virus isolation and animal inoculation. ASFV was detected by
   in vivo experiments for up to 18, 60, and 83 days of curing in Italian
   salami, pork belly, and loin, respectively. These data provide valuable
   information for the pork processing industry when planning the export of
   these products.},

   (comprising 8,119 nucleotides) and three additional near-complete
   genomic sequences were generated. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated
   that these viruses were classified within the A/AFRICA/G-IV lineage,
   most closely related to viruses circulating in Nigeria between 2009 and
   2015. These unexpected results motivate further studies to define the
   precise pathways by which this viral lineage has been introduced into

Abstract = {In fluorescence microscopy, light radiation can be used to bleach
   fluorescent molecules in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
   samples, in order to increase the ratio between signal of interest and
   background autofluorescence. We tested if the same principle can be
   exploited in bright field microscopy to bleach pigmented melanoma FFPE
   sections together with cell morphology maintenance. After dewaxing and
   rehydration, serial FFPE sections of a feline diffuse iris melanoma, a
   canine dermal melanoma, a gray horse dermal melanoma and a swine
   cutaneous melanoma were irradiated with visible light for I, 2, 3, 4 and
   5 days, prior to Hematoxylin \& Eosin staining. Complete bleaching was
   obtained after 1-day treatment in feline and swine melanomas, while 2
   and 3 days were required in canine and equine neoplasms, respectively.
   In all treated samples, cell morphology was maintained. Photo-induced
   bleaching combined with immunohistochemistry was tested after a 3-day
   photo-treatment using five different markers. According to the
   literature, in all samples neoplastic cells stained positive for
   vimentin, S100 and PNL2, while negative for FVIII and pancytokeratin. in
   conclusion, visible light can be effectively exploited to bleach
   pigmented melanoma FFPE sections prior to perform routine histochemical
   and immunohistochemical stains.},

Abstract = {Mercury contamination in fish products, and in large pelagic predatory
   fish in particular, is a remarkable food safety issue that affects fish
   industry. A lot made up by Bluefin tunas caught at Porto Paglia - in the
   south-western coast of Sardinia was subject to several sessions of fish
   meat official sampling, as disputable results of mercury level
   determination suggested a potential non-compliance to maximum allowable
   limit. Local competent Veterinary Service reviewed the sampling
   procedure introducing more rigorous details including the identification
   of a specific muscular portion as sampling site, after having taken into
   account both statutory provisions laid down by Regulation (EC) No
   333/2007 and available scientific evidence on variables affecting uneven
   distribution of mercury across tuna carcasses. This case-study aims to
   provide an initial contribution in order to ensure an appropriate and
   representative field sampling protocol of tuna lots that are to be
   analysed for mercury content.},

Abstract = {The present paper assesses the multi-observer evaluation of
   ultrasonographic response of horses with superficial digital flexor
   tendon (SDFT) damage to the inoculation of autologous adipose
   mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs). The study included 15 horses recruited
   at an equine hospital following a SDFT damage diagnosis. Horses were
   implanted with AMSCs obtained from the paracaudal region. Treatment
   efficacy, in terms of morphological recovery of SDTF considered as
   degree of echogenicity (TS) and percentage of fibres alignment (FAS),
   was evaluated using four experts. Inter-observer agreement of experts'
   judgements on ultrasonographic examinations in different stages of
   recovery was calculated. The classification of the intra-observer
   agreement was defined as good for both TS and FAS while the
   inter-observer agreement was good for TS and moderate for FAS.
   Ultrasonographic images judged as having a higher TS showed 95 times
   greater chance of belonging to the final recovery stage than the first
   and a 50 times greater chance resulted for FAS. This study provided
   evidence that the inter-observer agreement of ultrasonographic images is
   a reliable and valid method to evaluate the morphological recovery of
   injured tendons. In addition, the studydemonstrated the morphological
   recovery of SDFT in horses following AMSCs injection through an
   independent evaluation system.},

Abstract = {Trombiculosis has been reported in some wild ruminant species. We
   investigated the occurrence of trombiculosis in the northern chamois
   (Rupicapra rupicapra rupicapra) in the Western Italian Alps, and we
   describe the related histopathologic changes. Superficial scrapes and
   skin samples were taken from 191 chamois from the Lombardy and Piedmont
   regions during the hunting season in September-December 2015. Numbers of
   eosinophils, mast cells, cluster of differentiation (CD) 3-, CD79
   alpha-, CD68-positive cells were determined on immunohistochemically
   stained skin sections using a semiautomatic analysis system. Forty
   (20.9, 40/191) chamois were positive for trombiculid larvae on skin
   scrapings. Of the positive animals, 15 were from Lombardy and 25 from
   Piedmont, with similar prevalences. Macroscopic lesions were light with
   involvement of body regions that had contact with the ground, especially
   head (pinnae and areas around eyes and mouth) and limbs, where
   stylostome was easily formed due to thin skin. Histologically,
   trombiculosis caused a focal moderate dermatitis with epidermal
   necrosis, thin crusts, and hyperkeratosis. Inflammatory infiltrates were
   suggestive of a granulomatous reaction centered on a stylostome, formed
   by mite saliva and necrotic host tissue debris. However, we detected
   some difference in cutaneous immune response with some chamois showing a
   prevalent T-cell response and others having an increased B-cell count
   associated with a higher number of eosinophils, mast cells and a lower
   number of T cells.},

Title = {Glioblastoma: Microenvironment and Niche Concept},
Journal = {CANCERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The niche concept was originally developed to describe the location of
   normal neural stem cells (NSCs) in the subependymal layer of the
   sub-ventricular zone. In this paper, its significance has been extended
   to the location of tumor stem cells in glioblastoma (GB) to discuss the
   relationship between GB stem cells (GSCs) and endothelial cells (ECs).
   Their interaction is basically conceived as responsible for tumor
   growth, invasion and recurrence. Niches are described as the points of
   utmost expression of the tumor microenvironment (TME), therefore
   including everything in the tumor except for tumor cells: NSCs, reactive
   astrocytes, ECs, glioma-associated microglia/macrophages (GAMs), myeloid
   cells, pericytes, fibroblasts, etc. and all intrinsic and extrinsic
   signaling pathways. Perivascular (PVNs), perinecrotic (PNNs) and
   invasive niches were described from the pathological point of view,
   highlighting the basic significance of the EC/tumor stem cell couple.
   PNN development was reinterpreted based on the concept that
   hyperproliferative areas of GB are composed of GSCs/progenitors. TME was
   depicted in its function as the main regulator of everything that
   happens in the tumor. A particular emphasis was given to GAMs, pericytes
   and reactive astrocytes as important elements affecting proliferation,
   growth, invasion and resistance to therapies of tumor cells.},

Abstract = {Various ticks exist in the temperate hilly and pre-alpine areas of
   Northern Italy, where Ixodes ricinus is the more important. In this area
   different tick-borne pathogen monitoring projects have recently been
   implemented; we present here the results of a two-year field survey of
   ticks and associated pathogens, conducted 2009-2010 in North-eastern
   Italy. The cost-effectiveness of different sampling strategies,
   hypothesized a posteriori based on two sub-sets of data, were compared
   and analysed. The same two subsets were also used to develop models of
   habitat suitability, using a maximum entropy algorithm based on remotely
   sensed data. Comparison of the two strategies (in terms of number of
   ticks collected, rates of pathogen detection and model accuracy)
   indicated that monitoring at many temporary sites was more
   cost-effective than monthly samplings at a few permanent sites. The two
   model predictions were similar and provided a greater understanding of
   ecological requirements of I. ricinus in the study area. Dense
   vegetation cover, as measured by the normalized difference vegetation
   index, was identified as a good predictor of tick presence, whereas high
   summer temperatures appeared to be a limiting factor. The study suggests
   that it is possible to obtain realistic results (in terms of pathogens
   detection and development of habitat suitability maps) with a relatively
   limited sampling effort and a well-planned monitoring strategy.},

Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {138},
Pages = {322-327},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Environmental conditions and xenobiotic exposure can be sources of
   stress to living organisms. Biological markers are measurable indicator
   of changes which may happen at any biological level and which can be
   considered an early warning signal of some biological or environmental
   state or condition. A structured field study was undertaken to
   investigate the relationship between three biomarker assays and the
   spatial and temporal variation of each biomarker in samples of Mytilus
   edulis. The three biomarkers were the neutral red retention assay,
   micronucleus assay and comet assay, which indicate damage at different
   cellular/molecular levels. Three sites in Poole Harbour, an area on the
   South coast of the UK were sampled on six separate occasions at least
   three weeks apart. The results for the comet assay showed a significant
   difference between sites and between sampling dates whereas the results
   for the other two assays did not show a significant difference for
   either factor. There was no significant correlation between the results
   of any pair of the three biomarkers. The results of the micronucleus
   assay showed a significant correlation with water temperature. This
   temperature effect, as well as induced repair, may contribute to explain
   the lack of a strict correspondence between pollution gradients and
   biomarkers responses.},

Title = {( Standard methods for Apis mellifera beeswax research)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {58},
Number = {2, SI},
Abstract = {Due to its multifunctional and complex role in the honey bee colony
   functioning and health (construction material allowing food storage,
   brood rearing, thermoregulation, mediation in chemical and mechanical
   communication, substrate for pathogens, toxins and waste), Apis
   mellifera beeswax has been widely studied over the last five decades.
   This is supported by a comprehensive set of scientific reports covering
   different aspects of beeswax research. In this article, we present an
   overview of the methods for studying chemical, biological,
   constructional, and quality aspects of beeswax. We provide a detailed
   description of the methods for investigating wax scales, comb
   construction and growth pattern, cell properties, chemical composition
   of beeswax using different analytical tools, as well as the analytical
   procedures for provenancing beeswax and beeswax-derived compounds based
   on the hydrogen isotope ratio (IRMS). Along with classical
   physico-chemical and sensory analysis, we describe more precise and
   accurate methods for detection of adulterants in beeswax (GC-MS and
   FTIR-ATR). Moreover, we present methods for studying the influence of
   beeswax (comb foundation) adulteration on comb construction. Analytical
   protocols for determining the pesticide residues using different
   chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques are also described. As
   beeswax is an agent of high risk for the transmission of bee diseases,
   we present methods for detection of pathogens in beeswax. To ensure the
   reproducibility of experiments and results, we present best practice
   approaches and detailed protocols for all methods described, as well as
   their advantages and disadvantages.},

Abstract = {Porcine astroviruses (PoAstV) are found in the gastrointestinal tract of

   enteric disease in pigs and other animals has not been elucidated. In
   the present report, we describe for the first time in Italy, the
   identification and genetic characterization, through whole genome
   sequencing, of a PoAstV2 in pigs in Northeast Italy in 2015. This
   instance is the first detection of PoAstV2 in pigs in Italy. The
   phylogenetic analysis of the complete ORF2 segment highlights the high
   similarity of this virus to those circulating that same year in Japan.
   There are very few full astrovirus genomes available, and the present
   data represent an important contribution towards a better understanding
   of the characteristics and evolution of these viruses.},

Title = {Non-thermal inactivation of Listeria spp. in a typical dry-fermented
   sausage: ``Bergamasco{''} salami},
Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF FOOD SAFETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {168-173},
Abstract = {Aim of the present study was the evaluation of the growth potential of
   Listeria spp. inoculated in the typical North Italian dry fermented
   sausage ``Bergamasco{''} salami during its production. As it was
   necessary to carry out the challenge test in the production line of the
   industry, according to the guidelines of the European Reference
   Laboratory for Listeria monocytogenes, a non-pathogenic ``surrogate{''}
   microorganism was used: for the inoculum, two strains of Listeria
   innocua (1 ATCC, 1 strain isolated from a similar substrate) were used.
   The inoculation of the samples occurred during grinding and mixing of
   the sausage mass, before the filling. To avoid cross-contamination, the
   control samples were produced before the contaminated ones. After the
   dripping, salamis were subjected to the normal production process
   (drying and maturation in five steps at specific temperatures and
   humidity rates). The inoculated products were subjected to the
   enumeration of Listeria spp. at T0 (day of inoculation) and at T4
   (post-drying), and every 10 days during curing (T10, T20, T30, T40, T50,
   T60, T70, T80 and T90), as this salami is generally sold as whole piece
   with varying levels of curing (from T20 to T90). Since the product may
   be cut in half and vacuum-packed, at each of the times starting from
   T20, half salami was vacuum-packed and stored for 30 days at 12 degrees
   C, at the end of the which Listeria spp. enumeration was performed
   again. At all times and for each type of samples of each of the three
   batches, the enumeration of the natural microflora (Total Viable Count,
   lactic acid bacteria, Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacteriaceae) and the
   determination of water activity and pH were performed on control
   samples. The product was characterized by a high concentration of
   microflora (8-8.5 Log UFC/g), consisting mainly of lactic acid bacteria,
   added to the mixture at the beginning of the production process. The pH
   showed a decrease over time, expected for this type of products, due to
   the development of lactic acid bacteria (final pH: 5.42-5.55). The water
   activity reached values able to inhibit the development of Listeria spp.
   (final a(w): 0.826-0.863). Listeria counts in the tested batches of
   ``Bergamasco{''} salami showed the absence of significant growth in the
   product with a reduction of loads if compared to T0, between -0.59 and
   -1.04 Log CFU/g. Even in the samples subjected to vacuum packaging and
   storage at 12 degrees C, the absence of significant increase of lactic
   acid bacteria in the product was highlighted with further decrease of
   bacterial loads (-0.70/-0.79 Log CFU/g if compared to T20). Considering
   the worst case scenario (thus the batch with the highest growth
   potential), in the products stored in the curing room at 14-16 degrees
   C, at humidity of 80\% and in the samples stored at 12 degrees C and
   vacuum packaged, the threshold indicated by the EURL Lm guidelines (+0.5
   Log CFU/g) for the growth of Listeria spp. was not reached, allowing to
   classify ``Bergamasco{''} salami in the category 1.3 of the EC Reg.
   2073/2005 as ``Ready-to-eat food unable to support the growth of
   Listeria monocytogenes{''}.},

Title = {Arcobacter spp. in raw milk from vending machines in Piedmont and
   occurrence of virulence genes in isolates},
Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF FOOD SAFETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},

Pages = {180-183},
Abstract = {Arcobacter spp. has been recognized as an emerging foodborne pathogen
   and a hazard to human health. In the dairy chain, it has been isolated
   from different sources, nevertheless data on Arcobacter occurrence in
   raw milk provided by vending machines are few. This study aimed to
   identify potentially pathogenic Arcobacter spp. in raw milk intended for
   human consumption sold through vending machines located in Piedmont. In
   an 8-month period, 37 raw milk samples were collected from 24 dairy
   farms: 12 (32,4\%) were collected directly in farm from bulk tank milk
   and 25 (67,6\%) from vending machines. Eight (21,6\%) out of the 37 milk
   samples and 7 (29,2\%) out of the 24 dairy farms were positive for
   Arcobacter spp. by culture examination. Four (16\%) out of the 25
   samples from vending machines and 4 (33,3\%) out of the 12 samples from
   bulk tank milk were positive. All 8 isolates were identified as A.
   butzleri both by MALDI-TOF MS and multiplex end-point PCR. According to
   the detection of virulence genes, a total of four Patho-types were
   highlighted: 5 isolates in P-type 1 and only one isolate for each of the
   P-types 2-3-4. A. butzleri isolates carrying encoding virulence factors
   genes were isolated from raw milk intended for human consumption: these
   findings strengthen the compulsory consumption after boiling as required
   by current legislation and suggest the need of enlarging the analytical
   investigations to other microorganisms not yet included in the food
   safety criteria.},

Title = {RECENT CHANGES IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN EUROPEAN WILDLIFE},

Abstract = {Many infectious diseases originating from, or carried by, wildlife
   affect wildlife conservation and biodiversity, livestock health, or
   human health. We provide an update on changes in the epidemiology of 25
   selected infectious, wildlife-related diseases in Europe (from 2010-16)
   that had an impact, or may have a future impact, on the health of
   wildlife, livestock, and humans. These pathogens were selected based on
   their: 1) identification in recent Europe-wide projects as important
   surveillance targets, 2) inclusion in European Union legislation as
   pathogens requiring obligatory surveillance, 3) presence in recent
   literature on wildlife-related diseases in Europe since 2010, 4)
   inclusion in key pathogen lists released by the Office International des
   Epizooties, 5) identification in conference presentations and informal
   discussions on a group email list by a European network of wildlife
   disease scientists from the European Wildlife Disease Association, or 6)
   identification as pathogens with changes in their epidemiology during
   2010-16. The wildlife pathogens or diseases included in this review are:
   avian influenza virus, seal influenza virus, lagoviruses, rabies virus,
   bat lyssaviruses, filoviruses, canine distemper virus, morbilliviruses
   in aquatic mammals, bluetongue virus, West Nile virus, hantaviruses,
   Schmallenberg virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, African
   swine fever virus, amphibian ranavirus, hepatitis E virus, bovine
   tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis), tularemia (Francisella tularensis),
   brucellosis (Brucella spp.), salmonellosis (Salmonella spp.), Coxiella
   burnetii, chytridiomycosis, Echinococcus multilocularis, Leishmania
   infantum, and chronic wasting disease. Further work is needed to
   identify all of the key drivers of disease change and emergence, as they
   appear to be influencing the incidence and spread of these pathogens in
   Europe. We present a summary of these recent changes during 2010-16 to
   discuss possible commonalities and drivers of disease change and to
   identify directions for future work on wildlife-related diseases in
   Europe. Many of the pathogens are entering Europe from other continents
   while others are expanding their ranges inside and beyond Europe.
   Surveillance for these wildlife-related diseases at a continental scale
   is therefore important for planet-wide assessment, awareness of, and
   preparedness for the risks they may pose to wildlife, domestic animal,
   and human health.},

Title = {Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography of aminoglycoside
   antibiotics with a diol-type stationary phase},
Journal = {ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {1044},
Pages = {174-180},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {Owing to their pronounced polarity, hydrophilic interaction liquid
   chromatography (HILIC) can be considered as the elective choice for the
   LC analysis of aminoglycoside (AG) antibiotics.
   In the present work, a gradient program was optimized for the first time
   with a diol-type stationary phase and an evaporative light scattering
   detector (ELSD), thus allowing the almost complete separation of the
   nine analysed AGs: spectinomycin, dihydrostreptomycin, streptomycin A,
   gentamicin Cl, amikacin, kanamycin A, paromomycin, apramycin and
   neomycin.
   In the optimized analysis conditions, analyte retention was found to be
   governed by a multimodal mechanism encompassing electrostatic,
   partitioning and hydrophilic interactions. However, the gradient mode of
   elution complicated a deep understanding of the influence of each
   contribution on the retention behaviour.
   The developed HILIC-ELSD method was applied for the analysis of
   commercial tablets containing neomycin co-formulated with the
   polypeptide antibiotic bacitracin. The method was fully validated
   according to the guidelines enshrined in the International Conference on
   Harmonization (ICH).
   The use of the diol-type stationary phase was well suited for
   implementing a successful 2D-HPLC system. Indeed, in order to cope with
   the absence of chemoselectivity for the couples amikacin/kanamycin and
   paromomycin/apramycin, a successful 2D-HPLC method was implemented with
   the ``heart-cut{''} approach and the use of either heptafluorobutyric
   (for the former) or perfluorooctanoic acid (for the latter) as the
   ion-pair reagent in the second RP-LC dimension. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Abstract = {Between October 2016 and December 2017, several European Countries had
   been involved in a massive Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI)
   epidemic sustained by H5N8 subtype virus. Starting on December 2016,
   also Italy was affected by H5N8 HPAI virus, with cases occurring in two
   epidemic waves: the first between December 2016 and May 2017, and the
   second in July-December 2017. Eighty-three outbreaks were recorded in
   poultry, 67 of which (80.72\%) occurring in the second wave. A total of
   14 cases were reported in wild birds. Epidemiological information and
   genetic analyses were conjointly used to get insight on the spread
   dynamics. Analyses indicated multiple introductions from wild birds to
   the poultry sector in the first epidemic wave, and noteworthy lateral
   spread from October 2017 in a limited geographical area with high
   poultry densities. Turkeys, layers and backyards were the mainly
   affected types of poultry production. Two genetic sub-groups were
   detected in the second wave in non-overlapping geographical areas,
   leading to speculate on the involvement of different wild bird
   populations. The integration of epidemiological data and genetic
   analyses allowed to unravel the transmission dynamics of H5N8 virus in
   Italy, and could be exploited to timely support in implementing tailored
   control measures.},

Abstract = {On September 7, 2017, three potentially autochthonous cases of
   chikungunya were notified in the Lazio region. An Outbreak investigation
   based on established surveillance system data and molecular analysis of
   viral variant(s) were conducted. Epidemiological analysis suggested the
   occurrence of 3 main foci of local transmission. The major focus
   involved 317 cases with epidemiological link with the area of Anzio. The
   other two foci occurred in Rome (80 cases) and Latina (8 cases).
   Cumulative incidence in Anzio and Latina were 331.4 and 7.13 per 100,000
   residents, respectively. Cumulative incidences ranged from 1.4 to
   14.3/100,000 residents in Rome. This is the first report of a
   chikungunya outbreak involving a densely populated urban area in a
   western country. The outbreak probably started in Anzio, spread by
   continuity to neighbouring villages, and then to the metropolitan area
   of Rome and to the Latina area favoured by the touristic nature of the
   Anzio area.},

Abstract = {The genetic variability of Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is one of
   the main challenges for its control, hindering not only the development
   of effective vaccination strategies but also its classification and,
   consequently, epidemiology understanding. The 624/I and Q1 genotypes,
   now recognized to be part of the GI-16 lineage, represent an excellent
   example of the practical consequences of IBV molecular epidemiology
   limited knowledge. In fact, being their common origin unrecognized for a
   long time, independent epidemiological pictures were drawn for the two
   genotypes. To fix this misinterpretation, the present study reconstructs
   the history, population dynamics and spreading patterns of GI-16 lineage
   as a whole using a phylodynamic approach. A collection of worldwide
   available hypervariable region 1 and 2 (HVR12) and 3 (HVR3) sequences of
   the S1 protein was analysed together with 258 HVR3 sequences obtained
   from samples collected in Italy (the country where this genotype was
   initially identified) since 1963. The results demonstrate that after its
   emergence at the beginning of the XX century, GI-16 was able to persist
   until present days in Italy. Approximately in the late 1980s, it
   migrated to Asia, which became the main nucleus for further spreading to
   Middle East, Europe and especially South America, likely through
   multiple introduction events. A remarkable among-country diffusion was
   also demonstrated in Asia and South America. Interestingly, although
   most of the recent Italian GI-16 strains originated from ancestral
   viruses detected in the same country, a couple were closely related to
   Chinese ones, supporting a backward viral flow from China to Italy.
   Besides to the specific case-study results, this work highlights the
   misconceptions that originate from the lack of a unified nomenclature
   and poor molecular epidemiology data generation and sharing. This
   shortcoming appears particularly relevant since the described scenario
   could likely be shared by many other IBV genotypes and pathogens in
   general.},

Title = {Recent advances on Dirofilaria repens in dogs and humans in Europe},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Month = {DEC 19},
Abstract = {Dirofilaria repens is a nematode affecting domestic and wild canids,
   transmitted by several species of mosquitoes. It usually causes a
   non-pathogenic subcutaneous infection in dogs and is the principal agent
   of human dirofilariosis in the Old World. In the last decades, D. repens
   has increased in prevalence in areas where it has already been reported
   and its distribution range has expanded into new areas of Europe,
   representing a paradigmatic example of an emergent pathogen. Despite its
   emergence and zoonotic impact, D. repens has received less attention by
   scientists compared to Dirofilaria immitis. In this review we report the
   recent advances of D. repens infection in dogs and humans, and
   transmission by vectors, and discuss possible factors that influence the
   spread and increase of this zoonotic parasite in Europe. There is
   evidence that D. repens has spread faster than D. immitis from the
   endemic areas of southern Europe to northern Europe. Climate change
   affecting mosquito vectors and the facilitation of pet travel seem to
   have contributed to this expansion; however, in the authors' opinion,
   the major factor is likely the rate of undiagnosed dogs continuing to
   perpetuate the life-cycle of D. repens. Many infected dogs remain
   undetected due to the subclinical nature of the disease, the lack of
   rapid and reliable diagnostic tools and the poor knowledge and still low
   awareness of D. repens in non-endemic areas. Improved diagnostic tools
   are warranted to bring D. repens diagnosis to the state of D. immitis
   diagnosis, as well as improved screening of imported dogs and promotion
   of preventative measures among veterinarians and dog owners. For
   vector-borne diseases involving pets, veterinarians play a significant
   role in prevention and should be more aware of their responsibility in
   reducing the impact of the zoonotic agents. In addition, they should
   enhance multisectorial collaboration with medical entomologists and the
   public health experts, under the concept and the actions of One
   Health-One Medicine.},

Abstract = {Noroviruses are one of the leading causes of gastro-enteric diseases
   worldwide in all age groups. Novel epidemic noroviruses with GII.P16
   polymerase and GII.2 or GII.4 capsid type have emerged worldwide in late
   2015 and in 2016. We performed a molecular epidemiological study of the
   noroviruses circulating in Italy to investigate the emergence of new
   norovirus strains. Sentinel hospital-based surveillance, in three
   different Italian regions, revealed increased prevalence of norovirus
   infection in children (<15 years) in 2016 (14.4\% versus 9.8\% in 2015)
   and the emergence of GII.P16 strains in late 2016, which accounted for
   23.0\% of norovirus infections. The majority of the strains with a
   GII.P16 polymerase showed a GII.2 capsid genotype (79.5\%). Also, a
   marked circulation of strains with a GII.17 capsid (14.0\%) was
   observed, chiefly in early 2016. The emergence and global spread of
   non-GII.4 noroviruses pose challenges for the development of vaccine
   strategies.},

Abstract = {Background: Toxoplasmosis is a zoonotic disease causing severe symptoms
   in pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals. On average,
   worldwide, around 30\% of people are seropositive. The oral transmission
   route is of great significance and food, particularly meat, is an
   important transmission vehicle for T. gondii. However, the role of
   different food matrices is debated. Objectives: The aim of this review
   was to assess the risk of humans developing acute T. gondii infection
   via the foodborne route. Study eligibility criteria: Case-control
   studies including acute cases of T. gondii infection were included after
   literature searches, without time limits, in several databases. All
   studies estimating the risk of acquiring T. gondii infection after
   consumption of specific food categories were included. Results: Three
   risk factors proved to be significantly associated with acute T. gondii
   infection in humans: consumption of raw/undercooked meat, Odds Ratio
   (OR) 3.44 (1.29-9.16), consumption of raw/undercooked beef, OR 2.22
   (1.57-3.12), and consumption of raw/undercooked sheep meat, OR 3.85
   (1.85-8.00). Consumption of raw/undercooked pork, raw eggs, and
   unpasteurized milk proved to be non-significant risk factors.
   Limitations: Limitations in the present review and meta-analysis are due
   to the low number of case-control studies available for analysis and the
   lack of a search strategy targeting gray literature. Conclusion:
   Consumption of raw/undercooked beef and sheep meat are important risk
   factors for T. gondii infection. Their consumption should be avoided in
   order to prevent toxoplasmosis, particularly by those in at-risk
   categories, including pregnant women. The review protocol is registered
   in PROSPERO database (CRD42016043295).},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {DEC 11},
Abstract = {Sheep are not only a major livestock species globally, they are also an
   important large animal model for biomedical research and have
   contributed to our understanding of the ontogeny and architecture of the
   mammalian immune system. In this study, we applied immunohistochemistry
   and multicolor immunofluorescence in fixed and paraffin-embedded lymph
   nodes to phenotype the key populations of antigen presenting cells,
   lymphocytes, and stromal cells that orchestrate the host adaptive immune
   response. We used an extensive panel of antibodies directed against
   markers associated with dendritic cells (MHC class II, CD83, and CD208),
   macrophages (CD11b, CD163, and CD169), stromal cells (CNA. 42, S100, and
   CD83), and lymphocytes (CD3, Pax5, CD4, CD8). Using different methods of
   tissue fixation and antigen retrieval, we provide a detailed
   immunophenotyping of sheep lymph nodes including the identification of
   potential subpopulations of antigen presenting cells and stromal cells.
   By characterizing cells expressing combinations of these markers in the
   context of their morphology and location within the lymph node
   architecture, we provide valuable new tools to investigate the
   structure, activation, and regulation of the sheep immune system in
   health and disease.},

Title = {Hospitalized Pets as a Source of Carbapenem-Resistance},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {DEC 6},
Abstract = {The massive and irrational use of antibiotics in livestock productions
   has fostered the occurrence and spread of resistance to ``old class
   antimicrobials.{''} To cope with that phenomenon, some regulations have
   been already enforced in the member states of the European Union.
   However, a role of livestock animals in the relatively recent alerts on
   the rapid worldwide increase of resistance to last-choice antimicrobials
   as carbapenems is very unlikely. Conversely, these antimicrobials are
   increasingly administered in veterinary hospitals whose role in
   spreading bacteria or mobile genetic elements has not adequately been
   addressed so far. A cross-sectional study was carried out on 105
   hospitalized and 100 non-hospitalized pets with the aim of measuring the
   prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (GNB)
   colonizing dogs and cats, either hospitalized or not hospitalized and
   estimating the relative odds. Stool samples were inoculated on MacConkey
   agar plates containing 1 mg/L imipenem which were then incubated
   aerobically at 37 degrees C +/- 1 for 48 h. Isolated bacteria were
   identified first by Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
   time-of-flight mass spectrometry and were confirmed by 16S rRNA
   sequencing. The genetic basis of resistance was investigated using PCR
   methods, gene or whole genome sequencing CA/GS). The prevalence of pets
   harboring carbapenem-resistant bacteria was 11.4 and 1.0\% in
   hospitalized and not-hospitalized animals, respectively, with an odds
   ratio of 12.8 (p < 0.01). One pet carried two diverse isolates. Overall,
   14 gram-negative non-fermenting bacteria, specifically, one
   Acinetobacter radioresistens, five Acinetobacter baumannii, six
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa and two Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were
   isolated. The Acinetobacter species carried acquired carbapenemases
   genes encoded by bla(N)(DM-1) and bla(OXA-23). In contrast, Pseudomonas
   phenotypic resistance was associated with the presence of mutations in
   the oprD gene. Notably, inherent carbapenem-resistant isolates of S.
   maltophilia were also resistant to the first-line recommended
   chemotherapeutic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. This study estimates the
   risk of colonization by carbapenem-resistant non-fermenting GNB in pets
   hospitalized in veterinary tertiary care centers and highlights their
   potential role in spreading resistance genes among the animal and human
   community. Public health authorities should consider extending
   surveillance systems and putting the release of critical antibiotics
   under more strict control in order to manage the infection/colonization
   of pets in veterinary settings.},

Abstract = {We analyzed the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5 epizootic of
   2016-17 in Europe by epidemiologic and genetic characteristics and
   compared it with 2 previous epizootics caused by the same H5 Guangdong
   lineage. The 2016-17 epizootic was the largest in Europe by number of
   countries and farms affected and greatest diversity of wild birds
   infected. We observed significant differences among the 3 epizootics
   regarding region affected, epidemic curve, seasonality, and outbreak
   duration, making it difficult to predict future HPAI epizootics.
   However, we know that in 2005-06 and 2016-17 the initial peak of wild
   bird detections preceded the peak of poultry outbreaks within Europe.
   Phylogenetic analysis of 2016-17 viruses indicates 2 main pathways into
   Europe. Our findings highlight the need for global surveillance of viral
   changes to inform disease preparedness, detection, and control.},

Title = {Neomyogenesis in 3D Dynamic Responsive Prosthesis for Inguinal Hernia
   Repair},

Abstract = {Despite undisputed improvements, prosthetics hernia repair continues to
   be affected by unacceptable rates of complications. Postoperative
   adverse events such as discomfort and chronic pain represent a subject
   of increasing concern among the surgical community. Poor quality
   biologic response, stiff scar plates, and mesh shrinkage, a typical
   effect of conventional static meshes and plugs, are all indicated as the
   main reasons for many of the complications related to inguinal hernia
   repair. Even the conventional concept of treatment based upon a supposed
   reinforcement of the groin consequent to the fibrotic incorporation of
   meshes, would appear to be inadequate in the light of the latest
   scientific evidence concerning the degenerative genesis of inguinal
   hernia. Following these recent studies, a newly conceived 3D dynamically
   responsive implant has been developed. It concerns a multilamellar
   shaped prosthesis, intended to be placed fixation-free to obliterate the
   hernia defect. This 3D structure has already demonstrated to induce a
   probiotic biological response with development of viable tissue, instead
   of the fibrotic plaque typical of conventional meshes. Newly formed
   elastic fibers, neo-angiogenesis, and neo-nerve genesis in a surrounding
   of well perfused connective tissue are the typical elements of the
   biologic response in the newly conceived implant. In addition to these
   elements, muscle fibers have also been detected in the implant
   structure. The aim of this research was to determine the ingrowth of
   muscle fibers in the implant by assessing the quantity and quality of
   muscle development in the short, medium, and long term
   post-implantation. Histological examination of biopsy samples excised
   from patients who underwent dynamic hernia repair with the 3D dynamic
   implant showed the presence of muscular elements that in the short term
   could be described as multiple spots of myocytes in the early stage of
   development. Over the mid- to long-term, muscle fibers increased in
   number and level of maturation, assuming the typical aspect of standard
   muscle bundles in the final phase. Effectively, long term, myocytes
   histologically evidenced the distinctive arrangement of the muscle
   structure, with nuclei and striated elements being similar to normal
   muscle elements. The development of this highly specialized connective
   tissue in the 3D dynamic responsive implant seems to document the
   finalization of an enhanced biologic response leading to the ingrowth of
   typical tissue components of the groin. Reverting degenerative
   pathogenesis into effective regeneration recognized in the newly
   conceived 3D prosthesis would appear to represent a significant concept
   change in the repair of inguinal hernias.},

Abstract = {Infectious disease is a major challenge in aquaculture and poses a
   constraint for the development of farming of new species. In 2017,
   Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii) juveniles were imported from Italy
   to a Swedish farm. Transport conditions were suboptimal. Thirty percent
   died during transport and within the first days after arrival. Ten days
   after arrival, mortalities started to occur again, which prompted
   initiation of an investigation into the mortalities. Diseased fish were
   transported live to the National Veterinary Institute (SVA) for necropsy
   and further analysis. Pathological and histopathological investigation
   was conducted. Virology was performed on gills and internal organs by
   cell culture isolation and using specific PCR protocols against nervous
   necrosis virus (NNV) and Acipenser iridovirus European (AcIV-E). The
   juveniles displayed neurological signs such as lethargy, inability to
   maintain an upright position, and erratic swimming. Body condition was
   below normal, and gills were pale. One fish had petechial hemorrhages on
   the abdomen and the snout. Two specimens had intestinal hyperemia.
   Ventricles were air-filled, and swim bladders were deflated. Viral cell
   cultures gave negative results, but PCR analysis of gills and internal
   organs detected the presence of AcIV-E. We conclude that AcIV-E was
   associated with disease and high mortality in the sturgeon juveniles,
   and stress probably aggravated the course of the infection.},

Abstract = {This report describes an outbreak of botulism occurred among a
   free-living population of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and geese (Anser
   anser) in an urban park. Mortality rate among investigated population
   was 86,8\% (118 dead out of 136). Twenty-seven carcasses were collected
   for macroscopic examination and screened for microbiological,
   virological, toxicological investigations. A sick mallard was captured
   and neurological symptoms were observed. No causative agent of viral
   avian diseases was found in the examined animals and screening for
   environmental neurotoxic substances proved negative as well. In
   contrast, microbiological cultures from specimens tested positive for
   botulinum toxin-producing clostridia. Blood serum and fecal extract of
   the sick mallard proved positive for botulinum neurotoxin in the
   standard mouse protection test using reference Clostridium botulinum
   type C antitoxin. Gene content of cultured strains showed a mosaic
   composition of bont/C and bont/D sequences, defining them as type C/D
   chimeric organisms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The interest for the endovanilloid system and for transient receptor
   potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is continuously increasing, due to their
   involvement in inflammation, nociception and pruritus. Even if TRPV1
   enrolment was highlighted in both physiological and pathological
   conditions, some aspects remain unclear, mostly in veterinary medicine.
   This study aimed to verify the expression and functionality of TRPV1 in
   canine keratinocytes to investigate in vitro the role of TRPV1 in these
   cells that are involved in different cutaneous pathologies.
   Keratinocytes primary cultures were isolated from bioptical samples and
   cultivated. Binding assay (using (3){[}H]-resiniferatoxin), displacement
   assay (in the presence of 1.2 nM (3){[}H]-resiniferatoxin) and
   functional assays (in the presence of 1 mu Ci/Ca-45(2+)) with vanilloid
   agonists and antagonists, specifically addressed to TRPV1 receptor, were
   performed. Binding assay demonstrated the presence of measurable
   concentrations of TRPV1 (B-max = 1,240 +/- 120 fmol/mg protein; K-d =
   0.01 +/- 0.004 nM). Displacement assay highlighted the highest affinity
   for resiniferatoxin (RTX) and 5-iodo-resiniferatoxin (5-I-RTX), among
   agonists and antagonists, respectively. The same compounds results as
   the most potent in the functional assays. This study demonstrated the
   identification and the characterization of TRPV1 receptor in primary
   canine keratinocytes cultures. The results are promising for a clinical
   use, but further in vivo investigations are required.},

Abstract = {American foulbrood (AFB) is a severe bacterial brood disease of honey
   bees (Apis mellifera L.) caused by the spore-forming bacterium
   Paenibacillus larvae. Low-levels of P. larvae in honey bee colonies are
   very widespread and can be considered endemic, whereas AFB occurs in
   clinical form only when a certain level of spores is reached in the
   colony. We studied for the first time the relationship between the level
   of the wintry contamination by P. larvae in materials taken from the
   hive and the onset of the disease in the following spring. In ten
   apiaries, from 125 colonies without signs of AFB, samples of adult bees,
   honey from the brood chamber and hive debris were collected in winter
   and cultured to detect P. larvae spore levels. The colonies were then
   checked in spring, until the end of May, for AFB symptoms. The
   performance of tests based on bees, honey and hive debris was evaluated,
   with respect to the results of clinical examination, by determination
   and comparison of sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp) and positive
   predictive value (PPV) at different cut-off thresholds. Using the
   presence or absence of spores as a cut-off threshold, the examination of
   debris and bees showed a good Se (100\%), while the Se of honey was
   limited (81.25\%). At the same cut-off threshold, debris showed a
   greater Sp than that of bees (57.80\% vs 7.34\%). At increased cut-off
   thresholds, the Se was always higher for bee examination than for debris
   examination, whereas Sp and PPV were always higher for debris than for
   bees. The results showed that the levels of P. larvae spores in adult
   bees and, above all, in hive debris can be a useful tool for AFB risk
   assessment. The identification and proper management of the colonies
   with an increased risk of developing the disease is crucial for reducing
   the impact of AFB.},

Abstract = {Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea Virus (PEDV) causes watery diarrhoea,
   dehydration, and a high mortality rate among suckling pigs. Recently,
   PEDV had a large negative economic impact on the swine industries in
   Asia and North America. In 2014, PEDV re-emerged in many European
   countries, but most countries only reported a few sporadic cases. Here,
   we report the epidemic wave that occurred in Italy from 2015 to 2017.
   During this time, PEDV was detected by real-time PCR in 438 farms
   located mainly in the high-density pig production area in Northern
   Italy. Most of the outbreaks were in farrow-to-finish, farrow-to-wean
   and finisher farms. Clinical signs were observed mainly in suckling and
   fattening animals, while mortality rates were higher in piglets,
   reaching 50\%. A sequence analysis showed that a PEDV strain, similar to
   the OH851 S-INDEL strain isolated in the USA in January 2014, was
   responsible for the outbreaks in Italy in 2015 and 2016. However, from
   January 2017, a recombinant variant strain, containing a portion of the
   Swine Enteric Coronavirus in the S1 gene, spread and almost completely
   outcompeted the previous nonrecombinant strain. In total, 14.1\% of the
   environmental swabs collected from trucks at slaughterhouses after
   animals were unloaded tested positive for PEDV before the trucks were
   cleaned and disinfected, and 46\% remained positive after cleaning and
   disinfection processes were performed. Moreover, environmental swabs
   indicated that 17.3\% of the empty trucks arriving at the farms to load
   animals were PEDV-positive. This study indicates that trucks can have an
   important role in the spread of PEDV in Italy.},

   of, and two hours after a standardized treadmill exercise test, to
   detect differences in hematological parameters between healthy horses
   (10, group N), horses with upper (10, group U), and lower airway
   diseases (10, group L). Packed cell volume, erythrocyte number,
   hemoglobin, glucose, and total and unconjugated bilirubin concentration
   were statistically different between the groups, because of increased
   oxygen demands in respiratory diseases and intravascular hemolysis. This
   could occur during exercise and is worsened by the increased breakdown
   of erythrocytes secondary to exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage,
   diagnosed in horses in group L. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Context: Recent studies have suggested that influenza A virus (IAV)
   might be involved in the etiology of diabetes.
   Objective and Methods: To address this question, we tested the ability
   of H1N1 pandemic IAV to infect, replicate, and damage human beta
   cells/pancreatic islets in vitro and induce pancreatic damage and/or
   glucose metabolism alterations in chemical and autoimmune models of b
   cell damage in vivo. Moreover, we looked for direct and/or indirect
   evidence of correlation between IAV infection and autoimmunity/diabetes
   in humans.
   Results: Human H1N1 A/California/2009-derived viruses infected human
   pancreatic islets in vitro, inducing a proinflammatory response
   associated with substantial increases of CXCL9 and CXCL10 release. In
   vivo, infected mice showed a clear susceptibility to the virus, with its
   localization also found in extrapulmonary organs, including the
   pancreas. Infection was able to induce mild modifications of glycemia in
   C57B6 mice after chemical damage of islets but did not modulate the
   autoimmune damage of islets in NOD mice. One of 69 nasopharyngeal swabs
   collected from patients at the onset of type 1 diabetes yielded positive
   results for IAV. Pancreas sections from 17 organ donors available from
   the Network for Pancreatic Organ Donors With Diabetes showed the
   persistence of CXCL10-positive cells in islet autoimmunity-positive
   subjects; however, extremely rare cells stained for viral RNA and not
   preferentially in autoimmune subjects.
   Conclusion: Influenza H1N1 pdm strains are able to infect and replicate
   in mammalian pancreatic cells both in vitro and in vivo but did not
   cause any functional impairment consistent with diabetes.},

Abstract = {Mycobacterium genavense infection was diagnosed in an adult ferret with
   ptosis of the left eye, a proliferative lesion of the conjunctiva of the
   nictitating membrane, conjunctival swelling, and tumefaction of the
   periorbital tissues with a watery ocular discharge and the presence of a
   retrobulbar mass. The diagnosis was based on characteristic cytology of
   the retrobulbar mass and left mandibular lymph node that revealed
   granulomatous inflammation. Ziehl-Neelsen staining showed the presence
   of positive acid-fast bacilli in the cytoplasm of the macrophages. The
   diagnosis was confirmed by sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene
   amplified by using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction from a fresh
   lymph node biopsy. Therapy with marbofloxacin, rifampicin, and
   clarithromycin was recommended for 6 months and after this period, the
   veterinarian who was treating the ferret reported the disappearance of
   clinical signs. Six months after the end of the antibiotic treatment,
   the symptoms described previously reoccurred. Confirmatory laboratory
   tests were not performed but a recurrence of M genavense infection was
   suspected and the veterinarian, in agreement with the owner, euthanized
   the ferret. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The complete and near-complete genome sequences (7206nt and 7229nt) of
   two wild boar HEV strains detected in Southern Italy were obtained by
   the next generation sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis and p distance
   comparisons of one of the strains with HEV-3 reference subtype strains
   confirmed the detection of a subtype 3i (p distance=0.110) strain in
   wild boar, never detected in Italy either in wild boar or pigs. The
   sequence of the second strain was not classifiable in any of the
   subtypes defined to date, showing a p distance>0.138 and a low
   nucleotide identity with all HEV reference strains. The virus may
   represent a novel subtype, with a low relationship to other strains of
   genotype 3 detected in wild boar, pigs, or humans in Europe. This result
   suggests the circulation in Italy of an emerging or uncommon HEV strain.
   Sequencing followed by phylogenetic analyses of the complete HEV coding
   regions are important tools for understanding the evolutionary and
   epidemiological dynamics underlying the wide genetic diversity of HEV
   strains.},

Title = {Statin Use and Survival in Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant
   Prostate Cancer Treated with Abiraterone Acetate},
Journal = {EUROPEAN UROLOGY FOCUS},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Background: Although statin use has been associated with favorable
   effects in various solid malignancies, no conclusive evidence is
   available at present. Statins are safe and inexpensive, and may
   synergize with novel antiandrogen agents abiraterone via pharmacokinetic
   interactions and decrease substrate availability for de novo androgen
   biosynthesis.
   Objective: To determine whether statin use affects survival in patients
   with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated
   with abiraterone.
   Design, setting, and participants: Medical records of patients with
   documented mCRPC between September 2011 and August 2016 were reviewed at
   multiple participating centers. This research was conducted in ten
   institutions, including both referral centers and local hospitals. A
   total of 187 patients receiving abiraterone for mCRPC between September
   2011 and August 2016 were eligible for inclusion in this retrospective
   study.
   Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Patients were assessed
   for overall survival (OS), statin use at the time of treatment
   initiation, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) variations, and other
   variables of interest. Univariable and multivariable analysis was used
   to explore the association of variables of interest with OS and PSA
   declines.
   Results and limitations: Statin use was a significant prognostic factor
   for longer OS in univariable (hazard ratio {[}HR] 0.51, 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] 0.37-0.72; p < 0.001) and multivariable
   analysis(HR0.40,95\% CI0.27-0.59; p < 0.001) and was significantly
   associated with PSA declines (> 50\% decline at 12 wk: 72.1\% in statin
   users vs 38.5\% in non-users; p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Our study suggests a prognostic impact of statin use in
   patients receiving abiraterone for mCRPC. The mechanism of this
   interaction warrants elucidation, but may include enhancement of the
   antitumor activity of abiraterone as well as cardioprotective effects.
   Patient summary: We assessed the effects of statin use in patients with
   advanced prostate cancer receiving abiraterone. Patients treated with a
   statin plus abiraterone appeared to live longer than those treated with
   abiraterone only. Since no negative drug-drug interaction is known and
   statins are widely used and inexpensive, further studies assessing the
   use of abiraterone plus statins are warranted. (C) 2017 Published by

Abstract = {Biting midges of the genus Culicoides are known vectors of arboviruses
   affecting human and animal health. However, little is known about
   Culicoides imicola microbiota and its influence on this insect's
   biology. In this study, the impact of biotic and abiotic factors on C.
   imicola microbiota was characterized using shotgun-metagenomic
   sequencing of whole-body DNA samples. Wild-caught C. imicola adult
   nulliparous females were sampled in two locations from Sicily, Italy.
   The climatic variables of temperature and soil moisture from both
   localities were recorded together with potential host bloodmeal sources.
   Shared core microbiome among C. imicola populations included
   Pseudomonas, Escherichia, Halomonas, Candidatus Zinderia,
   Propionibacterium, and Schizosaccharomyces. Specific and unique taxa
   were also found in C. imicola from each location, highlighting
   similarities and differences in microbiome composition between the two
   populations. DNA and protein identification showed differences in host
   preferences between the two populations, with Homo sapiens and Canis
   lupus familiaris L. being the preferred bloodmeal source in both
   locations. A principal component analysis showed that the combined
   effect of host preferences (H. sapiens) and local soil moisture factors
   shape the microbiome composition of wild-caught populations of C.
   imicola. These results contribute to characterizing the role of the
   microbiome in insect adaptation and its utility in predicting geographic
   expansion of Culicoides species with potential implications for the
   control of vector-borne diseases.},

Abstract = {Seafood freshness is a quality key parameter due to the short shelf life
   of this highly perishable foodstuff in relation to safety, nutritional
   value, availability, and edibility. A variety of physical,
   microbiological, and chemical methods are used for assessing and
   predicting seafood quality. Chemical analyses to assess seafood
   freshness quality are based on the determination of substances like
   volatile amines that are structurally similar to ammonia and responsible
   for the fishy odour fish give off several days after catch.
   Here we report the results of a method to detect and quantify
   trimethylamine (TMA) by means of direct sampling analysis (DSA) coupled
   with a high-resolution mass spectrometer with a time of flight detector
   (TOF).
   Three different seafood products, Sea bream (Sparus aurata), Octopus
   (Octopus vulgaris), and Red mullet (Mullus barbartus) purchased fresh
   from a wholesale fish market (Savona, Ligurian Sea, Italy) were
   analyzed. The TMA adduct was correctly identified in all samples.
   Monitoring of TMA levels in the wholesale products from day 0 to day 20
   showed an increase in all samples, confirming deterioration of freshness
   quality.
   This innovative, simple, and rapid method may prove useful for routine
   screening analysis and holds promise as a tool to evaluate seafood
   freshness quality and protect consumers from potential health risks.},

Abstract = {Honey bees are pollinators that play a key-role in plant biodiversity
   conservation and crop production. This unique insect species has been
   managed in hives by beekeepers for millennia, even though such a
   peculiar animal production system never resulted in the domestication of
   the western honey bee. The western honey bee was originally distributed
   throughout most of Europe, Africa, the Middle East, part of the Arabian
   Peninsula and some parts of Central Asia. From Europe, the honey bee was
   introduced to America, Asia and Oceania. This adaptation to a range of
   environmental conditions, together with geological and climatic changes
   in past eras, has resulted in grouping of Apis mellifera into 31
   subspecies. In the last 150 years, technological advances in beekeeping
   and globalisation have heavily endangered conservation of the native
   subspecies of A. mellifera in Europe, with an impact on honey bee
   production and health status. Evaluation of the impact of this
   phenomenon on the ecological equilibrium is still ongoing, but there is
   already scientific evidence of negative effects that this problem is
   having on beekeeping. This document sets forth the scientific arguments
   in support of the conservation of native subspecies, and lists the
   existing Italian legislation in terms of subspecies protection
   initiatives. It also lists the main factors that are contributing to
   loss of genetic diversity and of local adaptations. This document does
   not intend to oppose the actions of the beekeeping industry, but rather
   to contribute to a more global vision of the very serious problem of
   honey bee decline.},

Abstract = {Responses of animals to environmental changes and their interactions
   with other species play an important role in conservation. Sharing a
   common habitat may lead to interspecific competition for resources, but
   field assessment of these biological events is not always easily
   accomplished. By using a non-invasive method, we evaluated the
   physiological stress responses of Apennine chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica
   ornata) to the presence of cattle, sheep and goat, red deer (Cervus
   elaphus), people (hikers), and predators to identify which factors may
   affect this endangered species. During September 2012, November 2012,
   and July 2013, a total of 318 faecal samples were collected in
   representative sites and analysed for faecal cortisol metabolites (FCM).
   FCM concentration was analysed through linear mixed-effect models. A
   significant increase in FCM values in Apennine chamois sharing their
   habitat with domestic animals was recorded during all study periods. On
   the contrary, stress responses to red deer and people were limited in
   time and emerged only during summer months, when hikers are more
   frequent and red deer extend their altitudinal range reaching chamois'
   habitat. The observed effects of domestic animals, red deer, and hikers
   should be considered in future Apennine chamois management plans, which
   should include the regulation of pastured domestic livestock,
   anthropogenic disturbances, and possible interferences with other wild
   species within parks.},

Abstract = {The spread of non-native species in the Mediterranean Sea, due to
   Lessepsian migration and tropicalization, as well as the use of
   ``non-selective'' fishing practices, causes frequently the capture of
   uncommon and abyssal species, that can be sold in seafood market. This
   could represent a risk for food safety, since some of these species are
   not listed in the European Union (EU) regulations for human consumption.
   Heavy metal contamination (lead, cadmium, mercury and arsenic) was
   evaluated, for the first time, in 12 uncommon lessepsian and abyssal
   finfish and cephalopod species, caught in the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea.
   Mercury exceeded the maximum limit set by the EU in some species, while
   lead and cadmium concentrations were compliant. Total inorganic arsenic
   was detected in all species, in a wide concentration range. Therefore,
   inclusion in the EU regulations of all these species is suggested to
   reduce the risk of consumer exposition to heavy metals.},

   Disease Virus Nonstructural Protein 2B},

Abstract = {Nonstructural protein 26 of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus (FMDV) is
   comprised of a small, hydrophobic, 154-amino-acid protein.
   Structure-function analyses demonstrated that FMDV 2B is an ion
   channel-forming protein. Infrared spectroscopy measurements using
   partially overlapping peptides that spanned regions between amino acids
   28 and 147 demonstrated the adoption of helical conformations in two
   putative transmembrane regions between residues 60 and 78 and between
   residues 119 and 147 and a third transmembrane region between residues
   79 and 106, adopting a mainly extended structure. Using synthetic
   peptides, ion channel activity measurements in planar lipid bilayers and
   imaging of single giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) revealed the
   existence of two sequences endowed with membrane-porating activity: one
   spanning FMDV 2B residues 55 to 82 and the other spanning the C-terminal
   region of 2B from residues 99 to 147. Mapping the latter sequence
   identified residues 119 to 147 as being responsible for the activity.
   Experiments to assess the degree of insertion of the synthetic peptides
   in bilayers and the inclination angle adopted by each peptide regarding
   the membrane plane normal confirm that residues 55 to 82 and 119 to 147
   of 2B actively insert as transmembrane helices. Using reverse genetics,
   a panel of 13 FMD recombinant mutant viruses was designed, which
   harbored nonconservative as well as alanine substitutions in critical
   amino acid residues in the area between amino acid residues 28 and 147.
   Alterations to any of these structures interfered with pore channel
   activity and the capacity of the protein to permeabilize the endoplasmic
   reticulum (ER) to calcium and were lethal for virus replication. Thus,
   FMDV 26 emerges as the first member of the viroporin family containing
   two distinct pore domains.
   IMPORTANCE FMDV nonstructural protein 2B is able to insert itself into
   cellular membranes to form a pore. This pore allows the passage of ions
   and small molecules through the membrane. In this study, we were able to
   show that both current and small molecules are able to pass though the
   pore made by 26. We also discovered for the first time a virus with a
   pore-forming protein that contains two independent functional pores. By
   making mutations in our infectious clone of FMDV, we determined that
   mutations in either pore resulted in nonviable virus. This suggests that
   both pore-forming functions are independently required during FMDV
   infection.},

Abstract = {In summer 2017, a foodborne outbreak occurred in Central Italy,
   involving 26 workers employed in the post-earthquake reconstruction.
   After eating a meal provided by a catering service, they manifested
   gastrointestinal symptoms; 23 of them were hospitalized. The
   retrospective cohort study indicated the pasta salad as the most likely
   vehicle of poisoning. Foods, environmental samples, and food handlers'
   nasal swabs were collected. Bacillus cereus (Bc) and coagulase-positive
   staphylococci (CPS) including S. aureus, together with their toxins,
   were the targets of the analysis. CPS, detected in all the leftovers,
   exceeded 10(5) CFU/g in the pasta salad, in which we found
   Staphylococcal Enterotoxins (SEs) (0.033 ng SEA/g; 0.052 ng SED/g). None
   of the environmental and human swabs showed contamination. We
   characterized 23 S. aureus from foods. They all belonged to the human
   biotype, showed the same toxigenic profile (sea, sed, sej, and ser
   genes), and had the same Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE)
   pattern; none of them harbored mecA or mupA genes. We also detected Bc
   contamination in the pasta salad but none of the isolates harbored the
   ces gene for the emetic toxin cereulide. The EU Reference Laboratory for
   CPS confirmed the case as a strong-evidence outbreak caused by the
   ingestion of SEs produced by a single strain of S. aureus carried by the
   same human source. This outbreak was successfully investigated despite
   the emergency situation in which it occurred.},

Abstract = {Cherax destructor is a crayfish endemic to south-eastern Australia and
   one of the last alien crayfish to be introduced in Italy. In the Laghi
   di Ninfa Natural Reserve (Latium region, Central Italy), the species was
   probably introduced in 1999, but only reported for the first time in
   2008. Nearby this area, the most widespread alien crayfish is the red
   swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii. In the Natural Reserve, between 2008
   and 2013 and during spring and summer, crayfish sampling was carried out
   with baited traps to assess the distribution of C. destructor and its
   possible relationship with P. clarkii. Cherax destructor was first
   recorded in 2008; few P. clarkii were detected in the cultivation ponds
   where C. destructor was present in 2012 and 2013. Moreover, crayfish
   plague analyses evidenced a positive result in two out of the 12 sampled
   P. clarkii. Cherax destructor is now completely absent from the Natural
   Reserve, while P. clarkii has spread in the area and was probably
   responsible for this eradication since C. destructor is vulnerable to
   crayfish plague which was also detected in the area. An ecosystem
   restoration project in the area favoured the spread of. P. clarkii; the
   implications of this intervention are discussed.},

Abstract = {The design of new materials as active layers is important for
   electrochemical sensor and biosensor development. Among the techniques
   for the modification and functionalization of electrodes, the laser
   induced forward transfer (LIFT) has emerged as a powerful physisorption
   method for the deposition of various materials (even labile materials
   like enzymes) that results in intimate and stable contact with target
   surface. In this work, Pt, Au, and glassy carbon screen printed
   electrodes (SPEs) treated by LIFT with phosphate buffer have been
   characterized by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force
   microscopy to reveal a flattening effect of all surfaces. The
   electrochemical characterization by cyclic voltammetry shows significant
   differences depending on the electrode material. The electroactivity of
   Au is reduced while that of glassy carbon and Pt is greatly enhanced. In
   particular, the electrochemical behavior of a phosphate LIFT treated Pt
   showed a marked enrichment of hydrogen adsorbed layer, suggesting an
   elevated electrocatalytic activity towards glucose oxidation. When Pt
   electrodes modified in this way were used as an effective glucose
   sensor, a 1-10 mM linear response and a 10 mu M detection limit were
   obtained. A possible role of phosphate that was securely immobilized on
   a Pt surface, as evidenced by XPS analysis, enhancing the glucose
   electrooxidation is discussed.},

   genetic clade 2.3.4.4 group-B and clustered with viruses collected in
   2017 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in West Africa. Our
   results suggested that infected migratory wild birds might have played a
   crucial role in the introduction of HPAI H5N8 into this region.},

Abstract = {Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious viral disease that
   affects all Artiodactyla. Seven immunologically distinct serotypes of
   FMD virus (FMDV) exist. In Chad, although FMD is included in the list of
   diseases monitored by the Chadian Animal Disease Surveillance Network
   (REPIMAT), the epidemiological situation remains unclear. A serological
   survey was conducted in the cattle population in eight of the nine
   administrative regions of the country (those regions with the highest
   cattle densities), to evaluate the prevalence and serotypes of
   circulating FMDV. A total of 796 sera from randomly selected cattle were
   analysed at the World Organisation for Animal Health/Food and
   Agriculture Organization of the United Nations FMD Reference Laboratory
   at the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e
   dell'Emilia Romagna (IZSLER), in Brescia (Italy). An enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA), called 3ABC ELISA, was used to detect
   antibodies against non-structural proteins (NSPs), as well as a series
   of six competitive ELISAs to detect and serotype antibodies against the
   structural proteins of FMDV serotypes 0, A, SAT 1, SAT 2, Asia 1 and C.
   Based on the detection of anti-NSP antibodies, the animal-level
   seroprevalence was 35.6\% (95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 32.2-38.9)
   and the herd-level seroprevalence was 62.3\% (95\% CI: 53.0-71.5). FMD
   was present in all livestock administrative divisions surveyed, with a
   higher prevalence in southern regions, which are characterised by higher
   rainfall and humidity and more important transboundary animal movements.
   Cattle aged more than four years had a higher seroprevalence, which may
   be due to repeated exposure. Semi-sedentary farming and transhumance
   were also risk factors. Antibodies against serotypes A, 0, SAT 1 and SAT
   2 were detected.},

Abstract = {Chronic wasting disease (CWD) persists in cervid populations of North
   America and in 2016 was detected for the first time in Europe in a wild
   reindeer in Norway. We report the detection of CWD in 3 moose (Alces
   alces) in Norway, identified through a large-scale surveillance program.
   The cases occurred in 13-14-year-old female moose, and we detected an
   abnormal form of prion protein (PrPsc) in the brain but not in lymphoid
   tissues. lmmunohistochemistry revealed that the moose shared the same
   neuropathologic phenotype, characterized by mostly intraneuronal
   deposition of PrPSc This pattern differed from that observed in reindeer
   and has not been previously reported in CWD-infected cervids. Moreover,
   Western blot revealed a PrPSc type distinguishable from previous CWD
   cases and from known ruminant prion diseases in Europe, with the
   possible exception of sheep CH1641. These findings suggest that these
   cases in moose represent a novel type of CWD.},

Abstract = {In dogs, inflammatory mammary carcinoma is a clinicopathological entity
   characterized by rapid progression and aggressive behavior from onset of
   disease. Reported median survival time is short, with no effective
   treatment options. The aims of this prospective, noncontrolled clinical
   trial were to investigate outcome variables and safety profile of
   toceranib, thalidomide and piroxicam with or without hypofractionated
   radiation therapy in dogs with measurable histologically confirmed
   inflammatory mammary carcinoma that underwent a complete staging.
   Eighteen dogs were enrolled: 14 received medical treatment, and 4 were
   treated with hypofractionated radiation therapy and medical therapy.
   Overall, median time to progression was 34 days and median survival time
   was 109 days. In dogs treated with medical therapy, overall response
   rate was 21\%, and clinical benefit rate (CBR) was 64\%; median time to
   progression was 28 days and median survival time was 59 days. In dogs
   receiving medical therapy and undergoing radiation therapy, overall
   response rate and clinical benefit rate were 100\%, with significantly
   longer time to progression (156 days) and survival time (180 days).
   Overall, treatment was well tolerated, with mild gastrointestinal and
   dermatological adverse events. Although the optimal treatment to this
   disease remains uncertain, the current approach consisting of systemic
   anti-angiogenic drugs with or without hypofractionated radiation
   therapy, provided clinical benefit in a significant proportion of dogs
   and should, therefore, be further explored.},

Title = {Evaluation of Quantitative PCR (qPCR) Paenibacillus larvae Targeted
   Assays and Definition of Optimal Conditions for Its
   Detection/Quantification in Honey and Hive Debris},
Journal = {INSECTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {The application of quantitative PCR (qPCR) as a routine method to detect
   and enumerate Paenibacillus larvae in honey and hive debris could
   greatly speed up the estimation of prevalence and outbreak risk of the
   American foulbrood (AFB) disease of Apis mellifera. However, none of the
   qPCR tests described so far has been officially proposed as a standard
   procedure for P. larvae detection and enumeration for surveillance
   purposes. Therefore, in this study, inclusivity, exclusivity and
   sensitivity of detection of P. larvae spores directly in samples of
   honey and hive debris were re-evaluated for the previously published
   qPCR methods. To this aim, recently acquired P. larvae sequence data
   were considered to assess inclusivity in silico and more appropriate
   non-target species were used to verify exclusivity experimentally. This
   led to the modification of a previously described method by shortening
   the forward primer, designing a new reverse primer and using more
   stringent amplification conditions. The new test allowed the detection
   of P. larvae spores in honey and hive debris down to 1 CFU/g. The qPCR
   test optimized in this study proved suitable for quantification and also
   for identification of field P. larvae strains and real contaminated
   samples. Therefore, it is proposed for reliable detection and
   quantification of P. larvae in honey and hive debris, thus circumventing
   the disadvantages of late AFB diagnosis based on clinical symptoms and
   possible underestimation of spore numbers that is the main drawback of
   culture-dependent procedures.},

Abstract = {Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), belongs to the genus
   Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae and causes severe
   diarrhoea, vomiting, dehydration and high mortality in seronegative
   newborn piglets. Thus, a precise and rapid diagnosis of PEDV infection
   is important for the application of control measures to limit viral
   dissemination. In this investigation, a monoclonal antibodies
   (MAbs)-based competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for
   detecting antibodies against PEDV was developed and validated. The
   diagnostic performance of the test was evaluated by receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) analysis using a panel of 829 known sera collected
   from different commercial pig farms, with or without a history of PED
   presence and from experimentally infected pigs. The competitive ELISA
   showed excellent diagnostic performance and discriminatory power with
   high sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) values (Se = 96.5\%, 95\% IC
   94.1-98.1; Sp = 98.2\%, 95\% IC 96.3-99.3). Moreover, this competitive
   ELISA method has other properties, such as high feasibility of testing
   sera without pre-treatment and automatic and instrument-mediated
   revealing, that makes it appropriate for large-scale screenings of
   affected pig farms in endemic regions or for monitoring plans in
   PEDV-free areas.},

Abstract = {Abortion and neonatal mortality are events that can occur in breeding
   bitches and queens. It has been reported that up to 55\% and 33\% of
   these cases remain without a known cause, respectively, in canine and
   feline pregnancies. Unusual abortigenic and potentially zoonotic agents,
   including Coxiella burnetii and Leptospira spp., may be involved in
   these cases. C. burnetii is able to cause reproductive disorders in
   cattle, sheep and goats, and cases of abortion have been observed in
   dogs and cats. Moreover, several outbreaks of C burnetii infection in
   humans have been caused by delivering bitches and queens, and some of
   these animals experienced abortion. Leptospira interrogans sensu lato is
   able to cause abortion or stillbirth in several animal species and its
   abortigenic role has occasionally been described in bitches and queens.
   The aim of this study was to search for C. burnetii and Leptospira spp.
   DNA in a retrospective series of 103 cases of canine and feline
   abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality submitted for the
   identification of possible infectious agents. One hundred and fifty-one
   specimens were tested using PCR assays and found negative for C.
   burnetii and Leptospira DNA. However, in 49 samples (47.6\%) other
   infectious causes of abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality were
   identified. These results showed that C. burnetii and Leptospira spp.
   are probably not common abortigenic agents or causes of neonatal deaths
   in dogs. However, given the potential abortigentic and zoonotic role of
   these agents, surveillance of canine and feline abortion, stillbirth,
   and neonatal mortality could be advisable for a systematic investigation
   of these events. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Dogs may be useful sentinels for public health monitoring of spotted
   fever group rickettsioses (SFGR). The aim of this study was to determine
   the exposure to SFGR among dogs and feeding ticks in central Italy. A
   total of 344 dogs and 607 adult ticks (395 Rhipicephalus sanguineus and
   212 Ixodes ricinus specimens) collected from the coats of sampled
   animals were included in the study. Canine serum samples were analyzed
   by indirect fluorescent antibody technique (IFAT) for IgG antibodies
   against Rickettsia conorii and Rickettsia rickettsii. All the ticks and
   buffy coats were processed by a PCR targeting a fragment of gltA
   followed by sequencing. Overall, 56 dogs (16.3\%) tested positive for
   one or both rickettsial antigens by IFAT with endpoint titers ranging
   from 1:64 to 1:2048; 38 (11\%) serum samples reacted against R. conorii,
   46 (13.4\%) reacted against R. rickettsii, and 28 (8.1\%) reacted
   simultaneously against both rickettsial agents. All buffy coats were PCR
   negative. Rickettsial DNA was revealed in 39 (18.4\%) I. ricinus and in
   10 (2.5\%) R. sanguineus specimens. The amplicons sequencing showed
   three SFGR, that is, R. conorii detected in 10 R. sanguineus specimens
   and Rickettsia helvetica and Rickettsia monacensis detected in 7 and 32
   I. ricinus ticks. Nine out of the 10 R. conorii isolates were obtained
   from ticks collected from seronegative dogs, and one specimen from a dog
   tested positive for both R. rickettsii and R. conorii by
   immunofluorescence assay. Among the seven ticks tested positive for R.
   helvetica, six were recovered from the coats of seronegative dogs and
   one from a dog having antibodies against R. conorii; the 32 isolates of
   R. monacensis were obtained from 28 seronegative and 4 R. conorii/R.
   rickettsii-positive dogs. The results highlight the non-negligible
   exposure of the canine population to SFGR in the sampled areas.},

Abstract = {Pistachios contain beneficial substances such as unsaturated fatty
   acids, phytosterols, and polyphenols. In the present study, we
   investigated if pistachio consumption is able to prevent or to revert
   hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and adipose tissue
   morphological alterations caused by high fat diet (HFD) in the mouse.
   Moreover, the impact of pistachio intake on the mRNA expression of
   peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-), fatty acid transport
   proteins (FAT-P), fatty acid synthase (FAS), stearoyl-CoA desaturase
   (SCD1), and sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor-1c
   (SREBP-1c) in liver and adipose tissue was also analyzed. No change in
   body weight, food intake, and hyperglycemia was observed between mice
   consuming pistachios (HFD-P) and HFD mice. Pistachio intake was able to
   prevent but not to reverse HFD-induced hypertriglyceridemia. Cholesterol
   plasma levels, steatosis grading, body fat mass, and adipocyte size were
   significantly lower in HFD-P group compared to HFD in both prevention
   and reversal protocol. Pistachio-diet was able to prevent HFD-induced
   overexpression of PPAR-, FAS, and SCD1 in the liver and SREBP-1c, PPAR-,
   and FAT-P in adipose tissue. Similarly, HFD-P significantly ameliorated
   the expression levels of FAT-P and SCD1 in the liver and SREBP-1c, FAS,
   and SCD1 in adipose tissue of obese mice. The present study shows that
   pistachio consumption is able to prevent and to ameliorate
   obesity-related dysfunctions by positively modulating the expression of
   genes linked to lipid metabolism.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of Shiga
   toxin-producing Escherichia coli in fresh beef marketed in 2017 in 13
   regions of Italy, to evaluate the potential risk to human health.
   According to the ISO/TS 13136:2012 standard, 239 samples were analysed
   and nine were STEC positive, from which 20 strains were isolated. The
   STEC-positive samples were obtained from Calabria (n = 1), Campania (n =
   1), Lazio (n = 2), Liguria (n = 1), Lombardia (n = 1) and Veneto (n =
   3). All STEC strains were analysed for serogroups O26, O45, O55, O91,
   O103, O104, O111, O113, O121, O128, O145, O146 and O157, using Real-Time
   PCR. Three serogroups were identified amongst the 20 strains: O91 (n =
   5), O113 (n = 2), and O157 (n = 1); the O-group for each of the 12
   remaining STEC strains was not identified. Six stx subtypes were
   detected: stxla, stxlc, stx2a, stx2b, stx2c and stx2d. Subtype stx2c was
   the most common, followed by stx2d and stx2b. Subtype stx2a was
   identified in only one eae-negative strain and occurred in combination
   with stxla, stxlc and stx2b. The presence in meat of STEC strains being
   potentially harmful to human health shows the importance, during
   harvest, of implementing additional measures to reduce contamination
   risk.},

Abstract = {Insects have recently emerged as a new protein source for both food and
   feed. Some studies have already demonstrated that insects' meal can be
   successfully added to animal feed without threaten animals' growth
   indices. However, effective and validated tests to individuate insects'
   meal in feed are strongly needed to meet traceability and safety
   concerns and to support the European legislation under development.
   Spectroscopic techniques represent valuable rapid and non-destructive
   methods that can be applied for in-situ analysis in feed production
   plants or in farms.
   In this work a Fourier Transform Near Infrared spectroscopy imaging (FT
   NIR) as a potential screening method for the detection and
   quantification of insects' meal in feed is presented. Discriminant
   analysis was used for the automatic recognition of insects' meal
   fragments into the feed matrix. Moreover, the possibility to quantify
   insect's meal in feed sample was successfully tested. The proposed
   method is a rapid and green strategy for feed contamination screening
   analysis.},

Title = {Physiological outcomes of calming behaviors support the resilience
   hypothesis in horses},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 30},
Abstract = {To manage a stressful stimulus animals react both behaviorally and
   physiologically to restore the homeostasis. In stable horses, a
   stressful stimulus can be represented by social separation, riding
   discomfort or the presence of novel objects in their environment.
   Although Heart Rate Variability is a common indicator of stress levels
   in horses, the behavioral mechanisms concurrently occurring under
   stressful conditions are still unknown. The sudden inflation of a
   balloon was administered to 33 horses. Video-recording of self-directed
   behaviors (snore, vacuum chewing, snort, head/body shaking) and
   monitoring of heart activity (HR and SDRR) were conducted for five
   minutes before (Pre-test) and after the stimulus administration
   (Stress-test). During the Stress-test, only snore and vacuum chewing
   increased and a significant increase was also recorded in both HR and
   SDRR. Moreover, the snore variation between the two conditions showed a
   significant correlation with the variation of both HR and SDRR. With the
   snore acting as stress-releasing behavior to restore basal condition,
   the homeostasis recovered via the enactment of such behavior could be
   physiologically expressed by an increasing vagal activity. Hence, the
   capacity to maintain homeostasis (resilience) could correspond to a
   prevalence of parasympathetic control on heart activity, intervening
   when certain behaviors are performed.},

Title = {A New Phylogenetic Framework for the Animal-Adapted Mycobacterium
   tuberculosis Complex},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {NOV 27},
Abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) affects humans and other animals and is caused by
   bacteria from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC). Previous
   studies have shown that there are at least nine members of the MTBC
   infecting animals other than humans; these have also been referred to as
   ecotypes. However, the ecology and the evolution of these animal-adapted
   MTBC ecotypes are poorly understood. Here we screened 12,886 publicly
   available MTBC genomes and newly sequenced 17 animal-adapted MTBC
   strains, gathering a total of 529 genomes of animal-adapted MTBC
   strains. Phylogenomic and comparative analyses confirm that the
   animal-adapted MTBC members are paraphyletic with some members more
   closely related to the human-adapted Mycobacterium africanum Lineage 6
   than to other animal-adapted strains. Furthermore, we identified four
   main animal-adapted MTBC clades that might correspond to four main host
   shifts; two of these clades are hypothesized to reflect independent
   cattle domestication events. Contrary to what would be expected from an
   obligate pathogen, MTBC nucleotide diversity was not positively
   correlated with host phylogenetic distances, suggesting that host
   tropism in the animal-adapted MTBC seems to be driven by contact rates
   and demographic aspects of the host population rather by than host
   relatedness. By combining phylogenomics with ecological data, we propose
   an evolutionary scenario in which the ancestor of Lineage 6 and all
   animal-adapted MTBC ecotypes was a generalist pathogen that subsequently
   adapted to different host species. This study provides a new
   phylogenetic framework to better understand the evolution of the
   different ecotypes of the MTBC and guide future work aimed at
   elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying host range.},

Title = {Death Associated to Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus ST8
   Infection in Two Dolphins Maintained Under Human Care, Italy},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {NOV 22},
Abstract = {The present study describes the isolation of Methicillin-resistant
   Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) from respiratory tract of 2 dolphins of
   different origin, a stranded juvenile Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus)
   and a captive born common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) calf,
   which died in the same institution at 1-month distance from the other. A
   complete microbiological and genetic investigation confirmed the
   presence of MRSA clone-complex 8, sequence type (ST) 8, spa-type t008 in
   both individuals. This strain differs from the one previously reported
   in walruses and dolphins and has never been described in dolphins
   before, but it is randomly isolated from Italian human patients.
   Vertical transmission of the infection may also occurs in other species
   and considering the description and location of the pathological
   lesions, this seems to be the most likely route of transmission implied
   in the young bottlenose dolphin. Staphylococcus aureus is known as an
   opportunistic agent, usually secondary to other pathogens, but its
   multiple antibiotic resistance and its zoonotic implications suggest a
   thorough and strict application of animal management hygiene protocols.},

Abstract = {A multiclass screening method to detect fifty-three forbidden substances
   by liquid-chromatography coupled to hybrid high-resolution mass
   spectrometry (LC-Q-Orbitrap) was developed and validated in bovine bile
   and urine. Eight classes of compounds were included in the method's
   scope (beta-agonists, corticosteroids, nitroimidazoles, progestins,
   resorcylic acid lactones (RALs), sedatives, steroids and stilbenes) plus
   chloramphenicol and dapsone. After hydrolysis, the sample was divided in
   two aliquots, which followed two parallel purification steps. The
   reunified extracts were injected and two chromatographic runs performed
   in positive and negative ionization mode, respectively. The validation
   data (60 different samples per matrix) proved that the method was fit
   for purpose with detection capabilities lower than 1 mg L-1 in both
   matrices. The combined application of accurate mass acquisition and
   two-stage mass spectrometry (parallel reaction monitoring) was crucial
   to achieve suitable selectivity, which is the most critical parameter
   mainly for urines. Finally, the long-standing problem of the high rate
   of false positive results for RALs, due to the natural ingestion of
   mycotoxin, zearalenone, was taken on including all their labelled
   standards. That allowed a very satisfactory management of this screening
   test. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Application of different laboratory techniques to monitor the behaviour
   of a Mycoplasma synoviae vaccine (MS-H) in broiler breeders},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},
Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {BackgroundMycoplasma synoviae (MS) is a major poultry pathogen which
   causes severe economic losses in all the productive sectors. The
   prevalence of MS in European countries has increased in the last few
   years, leading to greater attention to the available methods to prevent
   its spread. The main strategy currently applied for its containment is
   the development and maintenance of MS-free breeder flocks. A live MS
   vaccine (MS-H) obtained by mutagenizing an Australian field strain has
   recently been introduced in Italy. The aim of the present study was to
   evaluate the vaccine behaviour in broiler breeder groups at different
   production stages and the effectiveness of the available laboratory
   tests in discriminating the MS-H from a field strain.ResultsThe vaccine
   diffused extensively through the population, shown by the wide
   serological response (over 80\% of positive samples in RSA and 85\% in
   ELISA), the high serological titres, the positivity of all the tracheal
   samples collected during the production phase by MS PCR and the
   positivity by cultivation from tracheal swabs at the end-point (55weeks
   after vaccination). In contrast, only one swab from a sternal bursa was
   positive in MS PCR, while all the joint and oviduct samples were
   negative. There was no evidence of vertical transmission. Different
   genotyping techniques were used to achieve a clear classification of the
   MS positive samples. The vlhA and the obg gene analysis showed that most
   of the strains were homologous with the vaccine, but some ambiguous
   samples were further investigated with the multi locus sequence typing
   (MLST) scheme which confirmed the homology.ConclusionsThe development of
   a multi-technique approach to monitor vaccinated avian flocks, based
   both on serological and biomolecular methods, is advised as well as the
   use of effective genotyping techniques to analyse the MS strains
   circulating in high densely populated poultry areas.},

Abstract = {West Nile virus (WNV) is an important zoonotic pathogen maintained in a
   natural transmission cycle between mosquitoes and birds as reservoir
   hosts. In dead-end hosts, such as humans, infection may result in fatal
   neurologic disease translating into disease and death-related suffering
   and increased health care costs. In humans, WNV may also be transmitted
   through blood transfusions and organ transplants. WNV is not present in
   Switzerland yet, but competent vector species (especially Culex pipiens
   and Aedes japonicus) are prevalent and an introduction of the virus,
   likely through wild birds, is expected at any time. Therefore, it is
   important for Switzerland to be prepared and establish a surveillance
   system for WNV to initiate increased prevention activities, such as the
   screening of blood and organ donations and public education activities
   in case virus circulation is detected. The long-term goal of these
   surveillance measures would be a reduced infection rate in humans
   resulting in less suffering and reduced health care costs. To provide
   the basis for a pragmatic and resource-effective WNV surveillance
   program, this study used aliquots of serum samples of free-range laying
   hens taken at the abattoir and collected in the frame of the ongoing
   Swiss Avian Influenza and Newcastle Disease monitoring program for a
   2-year period. All 961 aliquots were analyzed using a commercial
   competitive WNV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The study
   allowed to set up sampling and laboratory routines as a basis for future
   WNV surveillance activities. At this stage there is no evidence for
   circulation of WNV in Switzerland.},

Title = {Distribution of Transferable Antibiotic Resistance Genes in

Volume = {9},
Month = {NOV 19},
Abstract = {In the present study, the distribution of antibiotic resistance genes in
   laboratory-reared fresh mealworm larvae (Tenebrio molitor L.), their
   feeding substrates (carrots and wheatmeal), and frass was assessed.
   Microbial counts on selective media added with antibiotics highlighted
   the presence of lactic acid bacteria resistant to ampicillin and
   vancomycin and, more specifically, enterococci resistant to the latter
   antibiotic. Moreover, staphylococci resistant to gentamicin,
   erythromycin, tetracycline, and vancomycin were detected.
   Enterobacteriaceae resistant to ampicillin and gentamicin were also
   found, together with Pseudomonadaceae resistant to gentamicin. Some of
   the genes coding for resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B
   (MLSB) {[}erm(A), erm(C)], vancomycin {[}vanA, vanB], tetracycline
   {[}tet(O)], and beta-lactams {[}mecA and blaZ] were absent in all of the
   samples. For the feeding substrates, organic wheatmeal was positive for
   tet(S) and tet(K), whereas no AR genes were detected in organic carrots.
   The genes tet(M), tet(K), and tet(S) were detected in both mealworms and
   frass, whereas gene aac-aph, coding for resistance to amynoglicosides
   was exclusively detected in frass. No residues for any of the 64
   antibiotics belonging to 10 different drug classes were found in either
   the organic wheatmeal or carrots. Based on the overall results, the
   contribution of feed to the occurrence of antibiotic resistance (AR)
   genes and/or antibiotic-resistant microorganisms in mealworm larvae was
   hypothesized together with vertical transmission via insect egg
   smearing.},

   performed on the fused data by Partial Least Squares Discriminant
   Analysis; a strict validation protocol was used to estimate the
   predictive performances of the models. The best results were obtained
   with high-level data fusion combining Raman and NIR spectroscopy and
   PTR-MS, with classification performances better than those obtained on
   single analytical sources (accuracy of 99\% and 100\% on test and
   training samples respectively). The combination of just three analytical

Year = {2018},
Volume = {32},

Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Rationale: Carry-over is an undesirable contamination from medicated to
   non-medicated during the production of feedingstuffs. In 2014 the
   European Parliament and the Council started working to produce a new
   regulatory act that will fix tolerable levels of drugs by carry-over in
   non-target feed to have a harmonized practice to evaluate this
   contamination by veterinary drugs.
   Methods: We developed a rapid and effective multi-analyte method
   coupling ultraperformance liquid chromatography to tandem mass
   spectrometry (UPLC/MS/MS) for the detection of 37 drugs belonging to
   different classes of antimicrobials (sulfonamides, tetracyclines,
   macrolides, quinolones, pleuromutilins and streptogramins) in feeds at
   carry-over levels. The method was in-house validated in the
   concentration range 0.25-2.0 mg kg(-1), according to the Regulation (UE)
   2017/625 requirements and the guideline included in the Commission
   Decision 2002/657/EC for official methods.
   Results: The UPLC/MS/MS method allows the determination of the
   antimicrobials in 15 min, by providing results compliant to the criteria
   established by the European Commission legislation. All the analytes
   showed a limit of detection (LOD) in the range 2.0-5.0 mu g kg(-1) and a
   limit of quantification (LOQ) at 10.0 mu g kg(-1); oxytetracycline,
   doxycycline, spiramycin and virginiamycin have a higher LOD and LOQ
   (15.0 mu g kg(-1); 30.0 mu g kg(-1), respectively). Recoveries were
   satisfactory ranging from 90.4\% to 103.1\%.
   Conclusions: The method is characterized by an effective clean-up of all
   drugs without the use of large sample size and organic solvent
   extraction.},

Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},
Month = {NOV 13},
Abstract = {BackgroundStreptococcus agalactiae is pathogenic for both animals and
   humans. In dairy cattle it commonly causes mastitis, with great economic
   losses, and there is scientific evidence of mastitis, caseous
   lymphadenitis, contagious skin necrosis and purulent infections
   associated with S. agalactiae in camels (Camelus dromedarius) as well.
   In humans, it is a common component of the respiratory and
   gastrointestinal microflora, but it can also act as a pathogen,
   especially in elderly people and immunocompromised patients, as well as
   in pregrant women and newborns.Case presentationA 10-year old
   non-pregnant female llama (Lama glama) was conferred to the Institute
   for Animal Health Control, in Bolzano for necropsy after sudden death.
   The animal had not shown unusual behaviour and had a low to normal
   nutritional condition (body condition score 2/5). The breeder had
   reported a chronic suppurative subcutaneous infection in the
   intermandibular area, resistant to therapy (therapy unknown). After
   necropsy, several samples were processed for histological,
   bacteriological and parasitological examinations.ConclusionsThis report
   describes, to the best of our knowledge, the first isolation of S.
   agalactiae in llamas (Lama glama). The animal came from a herd that
   counts approximately 200 South American camelids (llamas, alpacas) along
   with several horses, chicken, rabbits, cats and dogs; this farm offers
   services, such as trekking and pet therapy activities.},

Abstract = {Currently, a strict gluten-free diet is the only treatment for celiac
   disease. In Italy, food service establishments and restaurants can be
   certified for providing gluten-free foods, including pizza restaurants
   that make both gluten-free pizza and traditional wheat-based pizza. With
   this study we analyzed the gluten content in samples of gluten-free
   pizza prepared and purchased at certified restaurants in the Turin
   metropolitan area. All samples, from 28 pizzas and 28 cooked dough
   bases, produced results below the test limit of detection, except for
   one sample of cooked dough, that tested positive for gluten but still
   below the warning level for celiac consumers (<20 ppm). Gluten-free
   pizza, as advertised in the restaurants surveyed, can be considered a
   safe option for gluten-free consumption. Attention to and compliance
   with good manufacturing practices, a requisite for obtaining gluten-free
   certification for restaurants, were noted to have a positive effect on
   the final product.},

Abstract = {The acute course of disease in young oysters infected by OsHV-1 and the
   rapid tissue degradation often preclude histological examination of
   specimens collected during outbreaks in field. Herein, live spat
   originated from two geographical areas were sampled just at the onset of
   a mortality event that occurred in Normandy (France) in June 2016. The
   lesions, associated with high OsHV-1 DNA quantities, were characterized
   by severe and diffuse haemocytosis mainly involving blast-like cells,
   myocyte degeneration and large, irregularly shaped degenerate
   eosinophilic cells in the connective tissue. The herpesvirus was
   identified by negative staining TEM and real-time PCR. Sequencing of the
   C region and ORFs 42/43 confirmed that the variants met the definition
   of OsHV-1 mu Var. We sequenced 30 other ORFs in twenty OsHV-1-positive
   individuals and compared them to the mu Var specimens isolated between
   2009 and 2011. The ORFs encoding putative membrane proteins showed the
   highest number of variations. Seven different genotypes were identified,
   confirming the presence of relevant genetic diversity. Phylogenetic
   analysis provided evidence for a well-separated mu Var new group, with
   an evolutionary divergence estimated at 0.0013 from the other mu Var
   variants. The geographical distribution of these newly described
   variants and their effective virulence should be investigated in future.},

Journal = {VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {PARS is one of the main viral diseases in pig production, causing huge
   economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. The virus shows an
   intrinsic genomic instability and is able to change continuously, with
   the emergence of new strains, with different pathogenicity patterns.
   Commercially available vaccines only partially prevent or counteract the
   disease and the correlated losses. Moreover, the emergence of highly
   virulent and pathogenetic isolates represents a particular concern for
   PARS control and diagnosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate
   the efficacy of a modified-live virus (MLV) PRRSV-1 commercial vaccine
   in reducing the severity of the disease and minimizing losses upon
   challenge with a highly pathogenic PRRSV-1.1 Italian isolate
   (PRRSV-1\_PR40/2014). Four different groups were compared: C
   (unvaccinated-uninfected), VAC-C (vaccinated-uninfected), PR40
   (unvaccinated-infected) and VAC-PR40 (vaccinated-infected). The tested
   vaccine provided partial, but statistically significant clinical,
   virological and pathological protection after challenge under
   experimental conditions. In particular, vaccinated animals showed
   reduced viremia in terms of duration and magnitude, reduced respiratory
   signs and pathological lesions. Vaccination was able to trigger adaptive
   immunity able to respond efficiently also against the HP PR40 isolate.
   Vaccinated animals showed higher average daily weight gain, even during
   the viremic period, compared to non-vaccinated challenged pigs.},

Abstract = {Tick-borne rickettsioses are recognized as emerging vector-borne
   infections capable of infecting both human and animal hosts worldwide.
   This study focuses on the detection and molecular identification of
   species belonging to the genus Rickettsia in ticks sampled from human,
   vegetation, and domestic and wild vertebrates in Sardinia. Ticks were
   tested by PCR targeting gItA, ompA, and ompB genes, followed by
   sequencing analysis. The results provide evidences of a great variety of
   Rickettsia species of the Spotted fever group in Ixodid ticks and allow
   establishing for the first time the presence of R. raoultii in
   Rhipicephalus sanguineus s.l. and Dermacentor marginatus ticks in
   Sardinia island. Rickettsia massiliae was detected on R sanguineus s.l.
   and R. aeschlimannii in Hyalomma marginatum and Hy. lusitanicum ticks.
   In addition, eight D. marginatus ticks were positive for R. slovaca.
   This study provides further evidence that different Rickettsia species
   are widespread in Sardinian ticks and that detailed investigations are
   required to understand the role these tick species play on spotted fever
   group rickettsiae circulation. More studies will provide new background
   on molecular epidemiology of zoonotic rickettsiae. the geographical
   distribution of tick-transmitted rickettsial pathogens, and the
   involvement of vertebrate hosts in propagation and maintenance of these
   bacteria in nature.},

Abstract = {Lutzomyia migonei is incriminated as a vector of Leishmania
   braziliensis, the main causative agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis in
   Brazil. Recently, this phlebotomine sand fly species has been suggested
   as a vector for Leishmania infantum, which causes zoonotic visceral
   leishmaniasis. Considering the widespread distribution of Lu. migonei in
   South America, the existence of isolated populations has been
   hypothesized. Three Lu. migonei populations, two from north-eastern
   Brazil (Machados, Pernambuco State, and Baturite, Ceara State) and other
   from the south-eastern region (Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro State) were
   analysed both morphologically and genetically. Though no significant
   morphological differences were found amongst the sand fly specimens
   analysed, discriminant analysis based on specific morphometric
   characters (i.e., length of wing, antennal segment 3 and coxite for
   males, and length of wing and antennal segment 3 for females), showed
   that specimens from Machados were closer to Baturite than to NiterOi.
   The molecular analysis of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene sequences
   also supported this observation by the distinct separation of two
   monophyletic clades, grouping specimens from Machados and Baturite
   separately from those of Niteroi. Our results suggest the existence of
   different populations within the distribution range of Lu. migonei.
   Whether these populations are reproductively isolated and/or present
   differences in terms of vector competence/capacity for L. braziliensis
   and L. infantum needs to be further investigated.},

   State of Sao Paulo was divided into seven cattle-producing regions, and
   in each of them, 300 cattle farms were randomly selected. One animal
   from each farm (out of a total of 1,598 farms) was selected and its sera
   tested by virus neutralization technique against BTV serotypes (1-24 and
   26) for determining antibody titre. Moreover, for each sampled farm, an
   epidemiological questionnaire was submitted to verify the type of cattle
   production and the zootechnical and sanitary practices carried out,
   which could be associated with a higher risk of BTV infection. In this
   study, antibodies (percentage, {[}95\% confidence interval]) were
   identified against 11 serotypes: BTV-1 (22.15\%, {[}15.72-27.92]), BTV-2
   (31.03\%, {[}26.65-37.98]), BTV-3 (18.96\%, {[}12.42-24.90]), BTV-4
   (24.90\% {[}19.41-29.12]), BTV-9 (6.82\%, {[}1.45-11.72]), BTV-12
   (7.50\%, {[}2.82-12.51]), BTV-17 (23.90\%, {[}17.35-29.35]), BTV-19
   (10.20\%, {[}4.62-5.56]), BTV-21 (30.66\%, {[}25.00-36.00]), BTV-22
   (12.14\%, {[}5.91-18.55]), BTV-26 (57.00\%, {[}51.41-63.59]). In this
   study, for the first time in Brazil serological evidence of the presence
   of serotypes BTV-2, BTV-9, BTV-21 and BTV-26 is reported. The variable
   `new cattle entering herd' was considered a risk factor for the
   occurrence of infection (OR = 2.183, 95\% CI = 1.6-2.9).},

Abstract = {We used a real-time PCR (rtPCR) targeting a 150-bp amplicon of the
   mitochondrial small subunit of ribosomal RNA (mtSSU rRNA) to screen for
   Pneumocystis DNA in lungs of wild squirrels (Callosciurus finlaysonii, n
   = 85) and river rats (Myocastor coypus, n = 43) in Italy. The rtPCR
   revealed Pneumocystis DNA in 20 of 85 (24\%) squirrels and in 35 of 43
   (81\%) river rats, and was more sensitive than a nested PCR that targets
   a portion of the mtSSU rRNA and the mitochondrial large subunit of rRNA
   (mtLSU rRNA). Phylogenetic analysis based on mtSSU rRNA and mtLSU rRNA
   sequences showed distinct Pneumocystis sequence types in these rodents.
   The rtPCR assay should be reliable for screening large populations for
   this potential pathogen, thereby allowing cost-effective monitoring of
   the disease in wild animals.},

Abstract = {Honey is usually classified as ``unifloral{''} or ``multifloral{''},
   depending on whether a dominating pollen grain, originating from only
   one particular plant, or no dominant pollen type in the sample is found.
   Unifloral honeys are usually more expensive and appreciated than
   multifloral honeys, which highlights the importance of honey
   authenticity. Melissopalynological analysis is used to identify the
   botanical origin of honey, counting down the number of pollens grains of
   a honey sample, and calculating the respective percentages of the
   nectariferous pollens. In addition, sensory properties are also very
   important for honey characterization, and electronic senses emerged as
   useful tools for honey authentication. In this work, a comparison of the
   results obtained from melissopalynological analysis with those provided
   by a potentiometric electronic tongue is given, resulting in a 100\%
   match between the two techniques.},

Abstract = {The anthropogenic contamination of water bodies with metals via
   fertilizer, industrial sewage and urban wastewater has resulted in
   widespread problems in aquatic organisms, but also poses a risk to
   consumer health. Shellfish from coastal and estuarine environments
   bioaccumulate toxic metals in their tissues due to their ability to
   concentrate inorganic contaminants several orders of magnitude above
   ambient levels. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of
   trace elements in adult specimens of indigenous clams (Ruditapes
   decussatus). To this end, wild clams were collected from four different
   brackish areas of Sardinia (Western Mediterranean Sea, Italy) devoted to
   extensive aquacultural practices. The concentration of 16 trace elements
   (Al, Ag, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, Sn, Tl and Zn) in
   the tissues of the clams was quantified. The legal limits set by
   European Regulations for cadmium; mercury and lead were never exceeded.
   However, unexpectedly high values for aluminium and iron (mean 207 mg
   kg(-1) and 113 mg kg(-1) wet weight) were found in Santa Gilla lagoon,
   which is close to industrial settlements and had the highest values for
   the majority of chemical elements investigated. The highest values of
   the metalloid arsenic (As) were reported in the Porto Pozzo and San
   Teodoro lagoons (9.6 and 6.8 mg kg(-1) w.w., respectively). The clam R.
   decussatus confirmed the capacity of bivalves as suitable bioindicators
   of trace elements pollution. Further investigations are necessary for
   constant monitoring of clams, 32 which constitute an important
   traditional resource for the fishing activity in Sardinia. (C) 2018

Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential for diagnosis
   of fatty liver by means of ultrasonographic measurement of liver and
   perivisceral adipose tissue as an alternative to blood indicators of
   lipomobilization and liver biopsy in periparturient high-yielding dairy
   cows. Thirty cows were enrolled and divided into two groups. The
   evaluation of body condition score (BCS), non-esterified fatty acids
   (NEFA), beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), liver and perivisceral adipose
   tissue ultrasonographic measurement and histological liver lipid content
   (GdL) was performed at 15 +/- 5 d prepartum (T-0), 10 +/- 2 d postpartum
   (T-1), 30 +/- 2 d postpartum (T-2) and 50 +/- 2 d postpartum (T-3).
   Mesenteric fat thickness (the thickness of the perivascular adipose
   tissue) measured on ultrasound was shown to be an independent
   determinant of fatty liver. The cut-off of the ultrasonographic
   evaluation of the liver may be useful as a first and practical approach
   in identifying fatty liver. In conclusion, a non-invasive and reliable
   diagnostic method for predicting the risk of fatty liver in high

Title = {RNA Sequencing-Based Whole-Transcriptome Analysis of Friesian Cattle Fed
   with Grape Pomace-Supplemented Diet},

Abstract = {Simple Summary Grape pomace (GPO) is an important source of polyphenols
   which are known to have antioxidant properties. In the past decade, GPO
   has received some attention as a bioactive dietary component in farm
   animals' diet. In this study, we have analyzed the whole-transcriptome
   of Friesian calves fed with a GPO-supplemented diet using
   RNA-sequencing. We noted that the most affected pathway was the
   cholesterol lipid biosynthesis and this effect was consistent with a
   reduction in both serum cholesterol and lipid oxidation in the
   carcasses. This study provides evidence on the antioxidant property of
   GPO-supplemented diet, from a molecular biology standpoint.
   Abstract Grape pomace (GPO), the main by-product of the wine making
   process, is a rich source of polyphenols with potent antioxidant
   properties. Recently, GPO has emerged as a potential feed additive in
   livestock nutrition, with several reports describing its beneficial
   effects on animals' overall health status or production traits. However,
   little is known about it from a molecular biology standpoint. In the
   present study, we report the first RNA sequencing-based
   whole-transcriptome profiling of Friesian calves fed with a
   GPO-supplemented diet. We identified 367 differentially expressed genes
   (p < 0.05) in the GPO-supplemented calves (n = 5), when compared with
   unsupplemented control group (n = 5). The pathway analysis showed that
   cholesterol lipid biosynthesis' was the most negatively-enriched (p <
   0.001) pathway in the GPO-supplemented animals. In specific terms, five
   important genes coding for cholesterol biosynthesis enzymes, namely the
   Farnesyl-diphosphate Farnesyltransferase 1 (FDFT-1), Squalene Epoxidase
   (SQLE), NAD(P)-dependent Steroid Dehydrogenase-like (NSDHL),
   Methylsterol Monooxygenase (MSMO)-1, and Sterol-C5-desaturase (SC5D),
   two major transcription factors (the Sterol Regulatory Element-binding
   Transcription Factor 1 and 2), as well as the Low-Density Lipoprotein
   Receptor (LDLR), were all downregulated following GPO supplementation.
   Such an effect was mirrored by a reduction of blood cholesterol levels
   (p = 0.07) and a lowered (p < 0.001) Malondialdehyde (lipid oxidation
   marker) level in carcasses. We provide evidence on the effects of
   GPO-supplemented diets on the whole-transcriptome signature in veal
   calves, which mainly reflects an antioxidant activity.},

Title = {Genotyping Mycoplasma synoviae: Development of a multi-locus variable
   number of tandem-repeats analysis and comparison with current molecular
   typing methods},

Abstract = {Control of one of the most important avian mycoplasmas, Mycoplasma
   synoviae, and tracing the spread of the infection can be challenging as
   the pathogen is transmissible by both horizontal and vertical routes,
   and it can be disseminated through long distances via the hatching eggs,
   day-old chicks or pullets during intensive international trade. Genetic
   information provided by molecular typing methods support control
   programmes and epizootiologic studies. The aims of the present study
   were to develop a multi-locus variable number of tandem repeats analysis
   (MLVA) method for the typing of M. synoviae isolates and to evaluate the
   currently used molecular typing methods which are applicable directly on
   clinical samples.
   Tandem repeat (TR) regions were selected from the whole genome sequence
   of the M. synoviae type strain (WVU1853) to characterise the genetic
   diversity of 86 M. synoviae strains originating from 15 countries. The
   strains were also submitted to multi-locus sequence typing (MLST)
   assays, vlhA gene sequence analysis and to assays designed to
   differentiate live vaccine strains from field strains.
   The developed MLVA involves the examination of seven TR regions and
   provides similar genetic resolution as the tested MLST assays by
   identifying 35 genotypes among the tested strains. Differentiation of
   the live vaccine strains from field strains was also successful with the
   developed assay.
   The provided MLVA method proved to be a highly discriminative, rapid and
   cost-effective alternative typing technique for the genetic
   characterisation of M. synoviae and it is also suitable for the
   complementation of live vaccine strain differentiating assays in
   ambiguous cases.},

Abstract = {Massive antimicrobial use in animal farming is considered as the
   greatest contributor to the presence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria
   (ARB) in food of animal origin. Nevertheless, sewage from treated
   animals may impact on vegetables grown on fertilised fields, but it is
   largely unknown whether and to what extent ARB are transferred to
   vegetables and the human gut. It could be hypothesised that food of
   animal and vegetal origin have a different role in ARB transfer to the
   human gut and that different diets could be characterised by different
   antimicrobial resistance gene (ARG) loads. This study included three
   groups comprising vegans (n=26), vegetarians (n=32) and omnivores (n =
   43). Metadata regarding food consumption and anthropometric parameters
   were collected. Gut microbial communities were investigated by 16S rDNA
   analysis. Four ARGs (sul2, tetA, bla TEm and strB) were quantified by
   qPCR. The results showed a lower total load of investigated ARGs in
   vegan diet (pairwise comparison adjusted results: omnivorous-vegan, P=
   0.0119; omnivorous-vegetarian, P= 0.7416; and vegan-vegetarian, P =
   0.0119). No significant differences in abundance of each gene separately
   were found between the three groups. Neither the amount of animal
   protein nor the occurrence of ARGs was significant in explaining
   differences in the gut microbial community of individuals, and a large
   proportion of the differences between community composition (PERMANOVA,
   46.87\%) was not explained by the analysed variables. The results
   support the role of omnivorous and vegetarian diets in accumulating
   ARGs, suggesting a possible role for animal-derived food consumption.

Abstract = {Until now there are only few data on the effects of thermal treatments
   on the nutritional and hygienic characteristics of donkey milk. This
   Research Communication aims to provide information on the effects of
   pasteurization (at +65 degrees C for 30 min) and prolonged storage at
   refrigeration and freezing temperatures (21 d at + 3 degrees C +/- 2
   degrees C and up to 90 d at -20 degrees C +/- 5 degrees C) on some
   nutritional and hygienic characteristics of Amiata donkey milk. The milk
   was monitored by chemical and microbiological analysis. Pasteurization
   ensured compliance with EC Regulation No 1441/2007, as
   Enterobacteriaceae were never found in the milk, or during storage at
   refrigeration and freezing temperatures. Colony count at 30 degrees C in
   pasteurized milk never went beyond 1 log CFU/ml. The heat treatment and
   the storage did not result in any variations in the main constituents of
   the milk. Only a decrease in lactose and few variations in some fatty
   acids at 90 d of freezing were observed. In conclusion, pasteurization
   was able to achieve and maintain a high hygienic-sanitary quality over

Title = {Veterinary Public Health Activities and Management of the Livestock
   Sector during Earthquakes and Snowstorms in the Abruzzo RegionItaly,
   January 2017},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Simple Summary This article describes the actions that were taken to
   provide assistance to farm animals during and in the aftermath of
   earthquakes and snowstorms that hit the Abruzzo region in January 2017.
   This experience showed the importance of an integrated emergency
   management response system. An updated information system, in addition
   to punctual data management, allows for the rationalization of resources
   and the organization of necessary interventions. This knowledge will be
   fundamental to the involvement and integration of Regional Veterinary
   Services (RVS) and the relevant actors in animal welfare in emergency
   management plans.
   Abstract In 2017 the Abruzzo region, located in central Italy, was
   struck by a sequence of four moderately powerful seismic events (5.0
   magnitude on Richter scale), in addition to heavy snowfall that caused a
   state of emergency affecting the resident population and farm animals. A
   total of 282 stables were reported to have collapsed or been damaged and
   several animals (224 cows, 4025 ewes, 40,725 chickens, 22 horses and
   3092 pigs) were killed. The Istituto Zooprofilattico of Abruzzo and
   Molise G. Caporale (IZSAM)National Reference Center for Veterinary Urban
   Hygiene and Non-Epidemic Emergencies (IUVENE), played a crucial role in
   planning, coordinating and controlling veterinary activities during
   these catastrophic events. Operational and information tools were used
   to manage the needs of the communities involved, as well as to
   prioritize the veterinary interventions, record information, provide
   real-time data access, and produce reporting maps and Geographic
   Information System (GIS) layers. These events have highlighted how the
   integration of veterinary services into disaster management efforts can
   play an important role in protecting the health and welfare of animals,
   whilst also restoring economic activity and community life.},

Abstract = {Mesocestoides spp. are tapeworms harbored in the intestine of many
   domestic and wild carnivores, birds of prey and, rarely, of humans. The
   life cycle is assumed to involve three hosts and the metacestode
   juvenile stage (tetrathyridium) may reproduce asexually, provoking
   severe systemic infections. In the present study, a case of a peritoneal
   infection by Mesocestoides sp. occurred in a captive gold-handed tamarin
   (Saguinus midas) is described. Phylogenetic positions based on COl and
   12S loci were analysed to describe in details this unusual finding of
   Mesocestoides in a callitrichid monkey. The phylogenetic analyses has
   not clearly resolve relationships between the metacestode forms from the
   tamarin and any of the described Mesocestoides species available so far,
   including those described from non-human primates, thus supporting the
   hypothesis of a new taxon within the genus.},

Abstract = {Synthetic antibacterial peptides are advanced weapons that scientists
   design and produce to confront current threats of harmful and mortal
   pathogens, which could affect humans in everyday life. Recently, many
   small amino acid sequences, greatly efficient in their antibacterial
   action, have been reported in the literature. To date, only a few
   synthetic peptides, acting at micromolar or even tenths of micromolar
   concentrations, are on the market as commercial products, mainly because
   of their high cost of production. In this context, materials science can
   provide fundamental help by engineering small synthetic peptides,
   powered by hybrid gold nanoparticles, which have been found to strongly
   enhance antimicrobial activity against bacterial infections.
   Submicromolar concentrations of the 1018K6 peptide, bioconjugated to
   hybrid polymer-gold nanoparticles, kill almost 100\% of pathogen
   bacteria, such as Listeria and Salmonella genera, paving the way for
   economically sustainable commercial products based on this synthetic
   nanocomplex.},

Abstract = {The use of fresh milk, delivered and processed within 60 h from the
   first milking is mandatory for production of Protected Designation of
   Origin buffalo mozzarella. However, the use of frozen milk is a common
   practice during the summer to cope with a greater market demand. The aim
   of this study was to detect qualitative and quantitative differences
   between fresh and frozen milk at the protein level. The fresh buffalo
   milk was aliquoted in eight batches, keeping them for up to 104 weeks at
   -20 degrees C. Fresh and frozen buffalo milk batches were analysed by
   the application of a sensitive ELISA test. The results showed a decrease
   in beta-casein levels during frozen storage, revealing enzymatic
   activity at -20 degrees C. Therefore, the ELISA assay could be a
   promising tool to safeguard the production of the typical local fresh
   cheeses through the control of raw milk before cheese manufacturing. (C)

Abstract = {Trypanorhynch cestodes are common parasites of marine fish with
   complicated life cycles which have been suggested as model taxa to study
   the evolution of marine helminth parasites and their life cycles. Among
   the Trypanorhyncha, the genus Grillotia includes 18 valid species, of
   which only four have been found in Mediterranean fish hosts.
   Morphological. histopathological, and molecular data are presented on a
   massive Grillotia plerocercus infection in an anglerfish (Lophius
   piscatorius) from the Tyrrhenian Sea. BLAST analysis of the 28S rDNA
   sequences revealed 99\% similarity between specimens here found and a G.

Abstract = {Pentamidine (Pent), an antiparasitic drug used for the treatment of
   visceral leishmaniasis, has been modified with terminal azide groups and
   conjugated to two different polymer backbones (PLGA-PEG {[}PP] copolymer
   and hyaluronic acid {[}HA]) armed with alkyne end-groups. The
   conjugation has been performed by Copper Catalyzed Azido Alkyne
   Cycloaddition (CuAAC) using CuSO4/sodium ascorbate as metal source. The
   novel PP-Pent and HA-Pent bioconjugates are proposed, respectively, as
   non-targeted and targeted drug delivery systems against Leishmania
   infections. Moreover, Pent has been encapsulated into PP nanoparticles
   by the oil-in-water emulsion method, with the aim to compare the
   biological activity of the bioconjugates with that of the classical
   drug-loaded delivery system that physically entraps the therapeutic
   agent. Biological assays against Leishmania infantum amastigote-infected
   macrophages and primary macrophages revealed that Pent, either
   covalently conjugated with polymers or loaded into polymeric
   nanoparticles, turned out to be more potent and less toxic than the free
   Pent. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part B: Appl

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Abstract = {Salmonella Typhimurium is one of the main causes of outbreaks and
   sporadic cases of human gastroenteritis. At present, the rapid detection
   of this pathogen is a major goal of biosensing technology applied to
   food safety. In fact, ISO standardized culture method takes up to ten
   days to provide a reliable response. In this paper, we describe a
   relatively simple protocol for detecting Salmonella Typhimurium in
   chicken meat based on a Quartz-Crystal Microbalance (QCM), which leads
   to a limit of detection (LOD) less than of 10 degrees CFU/mL and
   requires a pre-enrichment step lasting only 2 h at 37 degrees C. The
   reliability of the proposed immunosensor has been demonstrated through
   the validation of the experimental results with ISO standardized culture
   method. The cost-effectiveness of the procedure and the rapidity of the
   QCM-based biosensor in providing the qualitative response make the
   analytical method described here suitable for applications in food
   inspection laboratory and throughout the chain production of food
   industry.},

Title = {Protective effects of platelet-rich plasma against lidocaine
   cytotoxicity on canine articular chondrocytes},
Journal = {ACTA VETERINARIA SCANDINAVICA},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {60},
Month = {OCT 26},
Abstract = {BackgroundLidocaine (LD) is one of the most commonly used local
   anesthetics for performing arthroscopic surgery and managing of
   osteoarthritic pain in both human and veterinary medicine. However, over
   the last years, several studies have focused on the chondrotoxic effects
   of LD. In order to ensure that intra-articular lidocaine is safe to use,
   treatments aimed at mitigating chondrocyte death have recently been
   investigated. The aim of this study is to evaluate the possible
   protective effects of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) against LD cytotoxicity
   on canine articular chondrocytes.ResultsArticular canine chondrocytes,
   were exposed to 1\% or 1.8\% LD alone or in co-presence with 10\% PRP
   for 30min. In order to evaluate the effects of PRP pre-treatments,
   experiments were carried out on cells cultured in serum-free medium-or
   in medium supplemented with 10\% PRP or 10\% fetal bovine serum. Cell
   viability was evaluated by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay and cell
   apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry using annexin V-fluorescein
   isothiocyanate/propidium iodide. The results showed that LD
   significantly reduced canine chondrocytes viability, probably due to
   apoptosis induction. Pre-treatment or the co-presence of PRP in the
   media restored the number of viable chondrocytes. The PRP also seemed to
   protect the cells from LD-induced apoptosis.ConclusionsPre-treatments
   and/or the simultaneous administration of PRP reduced LD-induced
   cytotoxicity in canine chondrocytes. Further in vivo studies are
   required to determine whether PRP can be used as a save protective
   treatment for dogs receiving intra-articular LD injections.},

Title = {Milk microbiome diversity and bacterial group prevalence in a comparison

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {Dry and early lactation periods represent the most critical phases for
   udder health in cattle, especially in highly productive breeds, such as
   the Holstein Friesian (HF). On the other hand, some autochthonous cattle
   breeds, such as the Rendena (REN), have a lower prevalence of mastitis
   and other transition-related diseases. In this study, milk microbiota of
   6 HF and 3 REN cows, all raised on the same farm under the same
   conditions, was compared. A special focus was placed on the transition
   period to define bacterial groups' prevalence with a plausible effect on
   mammary gland health. Four time points (dry-off, 1 d, 7-10 d and 30 d
   after calving) were considered. Through 16S rRNA sequencing, we
   characterized the microbiota composition for 117 out of the 144 milk
   samples initially collected, keeping only the healthy quarters, in order
   to focus on physiological microbiome changes and avoid shifts due to
   suspected diseases. Microbial populations were very different in the two
   breeds along all the time points, with REN milk showing a significantly
   lower microbial biodiversity. The taxonomic profiles of both
   cosmopolitan and local breeds were dominated by Firmicutes, mostly
   represented by the Streptococcus genus, although in very different
   proportions (HF 27.5\%, REN 68.6\%). Large differences in HF and REN
   cows were, also, evident from the metabolic predictive analysis from
   microbiome data. Finally, only HF milk displayed significant changes in
   the microbial composition along the transition period, while REN
   maintained a more stable microbiota. In conclusion, in addition to the
   influence on the final characteristics of dairy products obtained from
   milk of the two breeds, differences in the milk microbiome might, also,
   have an impact on their mammary gland health.},

Abstract = {RationalePhytocannabinoids are natural compounds produced by Cannabis
   spp. Some of these compounds show psychotropic effects on humans and are
   therefore used as drugs of abuse. These compounds are present in food
   and beverages containing ingredients from hemp, and thus can reach
   consumers. The Italian Ministry of Health planned to evaluate the intake
   of cannabinoids from food containing hemp ingredients. Thus, we were
   asked to develop and validate a multi-residue test method to determine
   nine phytocannabinoids in beverages and food.
   MethodsNine natural phytocannabinoids, hereafter called cannabinoids,
   were cleaned up from food by solid-liquid extraction, while beverages
   were simply diluted prior to analysis. The cannabinoids were separated
   by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, and on-line
   determination was carried out by tandem mass spectrometry using a 4000
   QTRAP mass spectrometer with a TurboIonSpray source, in
   multiple-reaction monitoring mode, using both positive and negative
   ionization.
   ResultsEach compound was determined down to 0.25ng/mL in solvent.
   In-house validation was carried out; the mean recoveries ranged from
   83.4\% to 101.2\% in food, and from 84.5\% to 104.5\% in beverages. The
   limits of quantification were 20g/kg for food and 2g/L for beverages.
   ConclusionsA reliable and rapid method for the identification and
   quantification of the psychotropic (9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, its
   non-psychoactive precursor (9)-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid A, and seven
   other cannabinoids was developed and validated, to monitor the content
   of these substances in food and beverages produced using hemp seeds,
   flour and oil as ingredients.},

Title = {Infection, modulation and responses of antigen-presenting cells to
   African swine fever viruses},
Journal = {VIRUS RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {258},

Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {African swine fever (ASF) is a devastating viral disease of domestic
   pigs and wild boar for which there is no vaccine available. The
   aetiological agent ASF virus (ASFV) has a predilection for cells of the
   myeloid lineage. Macrophages provide a first line defence against
   pathogens and are the main target of ASFV, thus several studies analysed
   their response to infection in terms of cytokine/chemokine expression
   and modulation of functionality. These studies have typically used
   macrophages differentiated in vitro from blood or bone marrow
   progenitors and few studies have focused on responses of polarized
   macrophages (M1, M2) or functional macrophage subsets isolated from
   different tissues. ASFV can also infect dendritic cells (DC), but
   regardless of their central role in the induction of adaptive immune
   responses, their role in ASFV infection was only partially analysed.
   Future studies on ASFV-DC interaction are needed, which should take into
   consideration the heterogeneity within this family, composed of
   different subsets whose phenotype is also organ specific. Other porcine
   immune cells such as gamma delta-T cells, NK cells and fibrocytes, can
   act as `non-conventional' antigen-presenting cells (APCs). In
   particular, gamma delta-T cells from ASFV immune pigs were shown to
   present viral antigens to T cells, but no studies have further explored
   the interaction of ASFV with this cell type or other non-conventional
   APCs. In this review we will provide an overview of the interaction of
   APCs with ASFV, describing the differences between virulent and
   attenuated strains, and suggesting areas for possible future studies.},

Title = {Genome-wide identification of geographical segregated genetic markers in
   Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium variant 4,{[}5],12:i:-},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium monophasic variant 4,{[}5],12:i:-
   has been associated with food-borne epidemics worldwide and swine
   appeared to be the main reservoir in most of the countries of isolation.
   However, the monomorphic nature of this serovar has, so far, hindered
   identification of the source due to expansion of clonal lineages in
   multiple hosts and food producing systems. Since geographically
   structured genetic signals can shape bacterial populations,
   identification of biogeographical markers in S. 1,4,{[}5],12:i:- genomes
   can contribute to improving source attribution. In this study, the
   phylogeographical structure of 148 geographically and temporally related
   Italian S. 1,4,{[}5],12:i:- has been investigated. The Italian isolates
   belong to a large population of clonal S. Typhimurium/1,4,{[}5],12:i:-
   isolates collected worldwide in two decades showing up to 2.5\% of
   allele differences. Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed that isolates
   from the same geographical origin form highly supported monophyletic
   groups, suggesting discrete geographical segregation. These monophyletic
   groups are characterized by the gene content of a large sopE-containing
   prophage. Within this prophage, genome-wide comparison identified
   several genes overrepresented in strains of Italian origin. This
   suggests that certain lineages may be characterized by the acquisition
   of specific accessory genetic markers useful for improving
   identification of the source in ongoing epidemics.},

Abstract = {7-Hydroxymatairesinol (7-HMR) is a plant lignan abundant in various
   concentrations in plant foods. The objective of this study was to test
   HMRLignan (TM), a purified form of 7-HMR, and the corresponding Picea
   abies extract (total extract P. abies; TEP) as dietary supplements on a
   background of a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic syndrome in mice
   and in the 3T3-L1 adipogenesis model. Mice, 3 weeks old, were fed a HFD
   for 60 d. Subgroups were treated with 3 mg/kg body weight 7-HMR
   (HMRLignan (TM)) or 10 mg/kg body weight TEP by oral administration.
   7-HMR and TEP limited the increase in body weight (-11 and -13\%) and
   fat mass (-11 and -18\%) in the HFD-fed mice. Epididymal adipocytes were
   19 and -12 \% smaller and the liver was less steatotic (-62 and -65\%).
   Serum lipids decreased in TEP-treated mice (-11\% cholesterol, -23 \%
   LDL and -15 \% TAG) and sugar metabolism was ameliorated by both lignan
   preparations, as shown by a more than 70\% decrease in insulin secretion
   and insulin resistance. The expression of several metabolic genes was
   modulated by the HFD with an effect that was reversed by lignan. In
   3T3-L1 cells, the 7-HMR metabolites enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol
   (END) showed a 40 \% inhibition of cell differentiation accompanied by
   the inhibited expression of the adipogenic genes PPAR gamma, C/EBP alpha
   and aP2. Furthermore, END and ENL caused a 10 \% reduction in TAG uptake
   in HEPA 1-6 hepatoma cells. In conclusion, 7-HMR and TEP reduce
   metabolic imbalances typical of the metabolic syndrome and obesity in
   male mice, whereas their metabolites inhibit adipogenesis and lipid
   uptake in vitro.},

Title = {Occurrence and characterization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
   pseudintermedius in successive parturitions of bitches and their puppies
   in two kennels in Italy},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},
Month = {OCT 11},
Abstract = {Background: Multi-drug methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
   pseudintermedius (MRSP) detection is rapidly increasing in microbial
   specimens from pets across Europe. MRSP has also been isolated from
   bitches and newborns in dog breeding kennels. This study assessed
   whether MRSP lineage differs between breeding kennels and is maintained
   over time. Post-partum bitches (at day 3 vaginal and day 3, 9 and 35
   milk samples) and their litters (at day 3, 9 and 35 oral and abdominal
   skin samples) from two Italian breeding kennels (A and B) were sampled
   and MRSP was subsequently characterized via whole-genome sequencing and
   antibiotic susceptibility testing. The study was carried out from
   October 2014 to March 2016 and included successive parturitions from the
   same animals.
   Results: The analysis revealed different situations in both investigated
   kennels. In kennel A, circulating strains were from 7-locus sequence
   types ST688, ST258 and closely related isolates of ST71, which included
   most isolates. In kennel B, only a new isolate, ST772, was detected. In
   addition, most isolates from both kennels had multi-resistant antibiotic
   profiles. MRSP was only isolated from litters of MRSP-positive bitches,
   thus suggesting that bitch-litter transmission is likely.
   Conclusions: Our data show that MRSP circulation can differ in different
   settings, that several clonal lineages can circulate together, and that
   vertical transmission appears common. MRSP colonization did not affect
   the health conditions of the bitches or of their litters.},
