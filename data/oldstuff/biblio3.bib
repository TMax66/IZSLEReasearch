Abstract = {A sensitive and reproducible screening analytical method is described
   for the determination of six pyrethroids (phenothrin, permethrin,
   cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, fenvalerate) in egg and meat
   samples by gas chromatography and electron capture detection (GC-ECD). A
   fast cleanup procedure, based on solid-phase extraction has been used,
   ensuring reduced solvent consumption and time and allowing the
   simultaneous preparation of multiple sample extracts. Under the optimal
   chromatographic conditions, an efficient separation was obtained with a
   total analysis time of less than 60 min, including the
   extraction-purification steps. Good responses for the six pyrethroids
   were obtained in a range of 50-500 mu g L-1 with linear coefficients
   higher than 0.9992. Instrumental limits of detection were between 0.22
   and 0.63 mu g L-1, corresponding to 0.04 and 0.13 mu g kg(-1) in the
   matrix. Detection limits in chicken eggs and various meat samples,
   calculated on spiked samples, were in the range 0.05-0.25 mu g kg(-1)
   and 0.07-0.23 mu g kg(-1), respectively. The validation results
   confirmed that the proposed GC-ECD method can be used as a reliable
   screening tool for the determination of pyrethroids in official check
   analyses. The method was extensively validated following the European
   directives, demonstrating its conformity in terms of selectivity,
   sensitivity, recovery, precision, and measurement uncertainty.},

Title = {Characterization of the blastogenic response to LPS of bovine peripheral
   blood mononuclear cells},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {Mitogens are diverse compounds of plant and microbial origin, widely
   employed to test immunocompetence in animals. The blastogenic response
   of bovine Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) to
   lypopolysaccharides (LPS) has been investigated in our laboratories for
   a long time. In particular, a possible correlation between blastogenic
   response to LPS and disease resistance of periparturient dairy cows had
   been observed in previous studies. Most important, low responder cows
   presented a higher frequency of disease cases after calving, compared
   with high responder animals. Owing to the above, different aspects of
   the blastogenic response to LPS were investigated on PBMC of healthy
   Friesian cows, using a 72-hour Bromodeoxyuridin (BrDU) cell
   proliferation assay. Stimulation with LPS induced little if any
   replication of bovine PBMC over 72 hours despite consistent BrDU
   detection in all the PBMC samples under study. Poor replication of
   LPS-stimulated PBMC was confirmed by cell cycle and cell growth flow
   cytometry analyses. In particular, LPS stimulation gave rise to very low
   percentages of S phase cells, sometimes lower than in control,
   unstimulated cells, as opposed to Concanavalin A-stimulated PBMC.
   Magnetic separation and analysis of BrDU-treated bovine PBMC after
   exposure to LPS showed that both B and CD4 T cells are involved in the
   blastogenic response to LPS, in contrast with current data based on
   human and murine models. Finally, LPS caused an early, specific
   up-regulation of TNF-alpha and TLR4 genes in bovine PBMC, and
   significant correlations were shown between the expression of
   inflammatory cytokine and Indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1)
   genes. On the whole, our data indicate that differences in the
   blastogenic response to LPS could be partly accounted for by
   heterogenicity of responding cells (B and T lymphocytes), which might
   also have an impact on induction and regulation of inflammatory
   responses and endotoxin tolerance.},

Title = {Reconstructing the evolutionary history of pandemic foot-and- mouth
   disease viruses: the impact of recombination within the emerging
   O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 lineage},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease of livestock
   affecting animal production and trade throughout Asia and Africa.
   Understanding FMD virus (FMDV) global movements and evolution can help
   to reconstruct the disease spread between endemic regions and predict
   the risks of incursion into FMD-free countries. Global expansion of a
   single FMDV lineage is rare but can result in severe economic
   consequences. Using extensive sequence data we have reconstructed the
   global space-time transmission history of the O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 lineage
   (which normally circulates in the Indian sub-continent) providing
   evidence of at least 15 independent escapes during 2013-2017 that have
   led to outbreaks in North Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, the
   Far East and the FMD-free islands of Mauritius. We demonstrated that
   sequence heterogeneity of this emerging FMDV lineage is accommodated
   within two co-evolving divergent sublineages and that recombination by
   exchange of capsid-coding sequences can impact upon the reconstructed
   evolutionary histories. Thus, we recommend that only sequences encoding
   the outer capsid proteins should be used for broad-scale
   phylogeographical reconstruction. These data emphasise the importance of
   the Indian subcontinent as a source of FMDV that can spread across large
   distances and illustrates the impact of FMDV genome recombination on
   FMDV molecular epidemiology.},

Journal = {MOLECULES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},

Abstract = {Melaleuca styphelioides, known as the prickly-leaf tea tree, contains a
   variety of bioactive compounds. The purposes of this study were to
   characterize the polyphenols extracted from Melaleuca styphelioides
   leaves and assess their potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
   effects. The polyphenol extracts were prepared by maceration with
   solvents of increasing polarity. The LC/MS-MS technique was used to
   identify and quantify the phenolic compounds. An assessment of the
   radical scavenging activity of all extracts was performed using
   2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH),
   2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonate) (ABTS(+)), and
   ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. The anti-inflammatory
   activity was determined on interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)/histamine
   (H)-stimulated human NCTC 2544 keratinocytes by Western blot and RT-PCR.
   Compared to other solvents, methanolic extract presented the highest
   level of phenolic contents. The most frequent phenolic compounds were
   quercetin, followed by gallic acid and ellagic acid. DPPH, ABTS(+), and
   FRAP assays showed that methanolic extract exhibits strong
   concentration-dependent antioxidant activity. IFN-gamma/H treatment of
   human NCTC 2544 keratinocytes induced the secretion of high levels of
   the pro-inflammatory mediator inter-cellular adhesion molecule-1
   (ICAM-1), nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and
   nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), which were inhibited by extract. In
   conclusion, the extract of Melaleuca styphelioides leaves is rich in
   flavonoids, and presents antioxidant and anti-inflammatory proprieties.
   It can be proposed as a useful compound to treat inflammatory skin
   diseases.},

Title = {Influence of 6-aminonicotinamide (6AN) on Leishmania promastigotes

Abstract = {6-Aminonicotinamide (6AN) is an antimetabolite used to inhibit the
   NADPH-producing pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in many cellular
   systems, making them more susceptible to oxidative stress. It is
   converted by a NAD(P)(+) glycohydrolase to 6-aminoNAD and 6-aminoNADP,
   causing the accumulation of PPP intermediates, due to their inability to
   participate in redox reactions. Some parasites like Plasmodium
   falciparum and Coccidia are highly sensitive but not all cell types
   showed a strong responsiveness to 6AN, probably due to the different
   targeted pathway. For instance, in bacteria the main target is the
   Preiss-Handler salvage pathway for NAD(+) biosynthesis. We were
   interested in testing 6AN on the kinetoplastid protozoan Leishmania as
   another model to clarify the mechanisms of action of 6AN, by using
   metabolomics. Leishmania promastigotes, the life-cycle stage residing in
   the sandfly, demonstrated a three order of magnitude higher EC50 (mM)
   compared to P. falciparum and mammalian cells (mu M), although
   pre-treatment with 100 mu M 6AN prior to sub-lethal oxidative challenge
   induced a supra-additive cell kill in L. infantum. By metabolomics, we
   did not detect 6ANAD/P suggesting that NAD(+) glycohydrolases in
   Leishmania may not be highly efficient in catalysing transglycosidation
   as happens in other microorganisms. Contrariwise to the reported effect
   on 6AN-treated cancer cells, we did not detect 6-phosphogluconate (6 PG)
   accumulation, indicating that 6ANADP cannot bind with high affinity to
   the PPP enzyme 6 PG dehydrogenase. By contrast, 6AN caused a profound
   phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) decrease and nucleobases accumulation
   confirming that PPP is somehow affected. More importantly, we found a
   decrease in nicotinate production, evidencing the interference with the
   Preiss-Handler salvage pathway for NAD(+) biosynthesis, most probably by
   inhibiting the reaction catalysed by nicotinamidase. Therefore, our
   combined data from Leishmania strains, though confirming the
   interference with PPP, also showed that 6AN impairs the Preiss-Handler
   pathway, underlining the importance to develop compounds targeting this
   last route.},

Abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes and Campylobacter spp. are foodborne pathogens
   responsible for outbreaks and disease in humans. The emerging problem of
   bacterial antibiotic resistance and the persistence of pathogens in the
   environment, especially where foods are processed, are some of the
   reasons that have led to a re-emerging interest in bacteriophages and
   their lysins as potential candidates for bio-control.This review focuses
   on the use of bacteriophages and their lysins as alternative strategies
   for controlling the foodborne pathogens L. monocytogenes and
   Campylobacter spp. In addition, the application of bacteriophages and
   their lysins in food safety and animal health, as well as
   phage-resistance development, legislation, and future prospects were
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Prompt and accurate diagnosis is warranted for infectious diseases of
   domestic animals which may have a significant impact on animal
   production or clinical practice. In this study, the identification and
   genetic characterization of a bovine enterovirus (BEV) strain isolated
   from a calf with diarrhea, are described. Two different next generation
   sequencing platforms were employed. Shotgun metagenomic accomplished by
   MinION sequencing (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) allowed the
   identification of BEV RNA from a cell-culture isolate. BEV was then
   confirmed by a specific real time RT-PCR assay. To achieve the whole
   genome of this isolate, sequence reads obtained by MinION were coupled
   with those originating from NextSeq500 (Illumina). Genomic relatedness
   and phylogeny with extant BEV strains is also reported. Overall, this
   manuscript highlights the use of the portable MinION sequence technology
   as a tool for support diagnostics in veterinary practice.},

Abstract = {A few studies have been published on the distribution of oxytetracyline
   (OTC) residues present in milk among cheese, whey, and milk protein
   fractions, throughout cheese-making, most of them, focused on the effect
   of pasteurization and Ultra High Temperature (UHT) treatments, and
   carried out on cow milk. This study aimed to investigate the impact of a
   thermisation treatment of ovine milk spiked with oxytetracycline at MRL
   (maximum residue limit) and half MRL, on the fate of the molecule, and
   the effect of OTC residues on starter culture development and cheese
   composition. The antibiotic recovery and partition from milk into whey
   and cheese were assessed by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass
   spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Starter and non-starter microflora development
   was monitored by viable plate counts. Milk thermisation did not affect
   OTC recovery, partition and cheese chemical composition. On a dry matter
   basis, an OTC reduction between 15 and 19\% was calculated in 60-day
   cheese, at MRL and half MRL, respectively. OTC caused a dose-dependent
   difference in the time required to reach pH 5.60, which was
   significantly higher (P < 0.05) at MRL level compared to half MRL and
   control, allowing coliform bacteria to reach 6 log CFU g(-1) in 1-day
   MRL OTC cheeses.},

Title = {Co-circulation of eight different phleboviruses in sand flies collected

Volume = {64},
Pages = {131-134},

Abstract = {The sand flies are the biological vectors of a variety of viruses
   belonging to the Phlebovirus genus. As several of these viruses, like
   Toscana virus, are important agents of diseases in humans, the
   definition the phleboviruses circulating in a particular area is an
   important health issue. This work presents results obtained between 2013
   and 2016, by testing 25,853 field-collected sand flies, sampled at 50
   sites in the Northern edge of the Apennine Mountains, in Emilia-Romagna
   and Lombardy regions (Italy). Isolation of the three reassortant
   Ponticelli I, II, and III viruses was successful from five pools of sand
   flies. These results, and phylogenetic analysis made by obtained
   sequences, suggest the presence of eight different viruses: Toscana
   virus, Fermo-like virus, Corfou virus, Ponticelli viruses, and two
   unknown putative viruses. The co-circulation of different phlebovirus
   reported in this study, indicate a very dynamic and complex situation,
   which deserves a more detailed investigation to characterize their
   possible pathogenicity to humans and animals.},

Abstract = {Although the eradication of Pseudorabies virus (PrV) in domestic pigs is
   ongoing, the circulation of this virus in wild boars remains a threat in
   the currently unprotected, `low prevalence', pig population. In this
   study, we reported PrV prevalence data and the influence of possible
   risk factors in 2 North-West Italian wild boar populations (free and
   enclosed) with the goal of supporting the implementation of a risk-based
   AD surveillance system. Sera from 1,425 wild boars were collected
   between 2011 and 2015 and tested by ELISA for the presence of PrV
   antibodies; the overall raw seroprevalence was 30.39\% (433/1,425; CI
   95\% 28.01-32.85\%). A significant difference was however observed
   between the prevalence rates of the free range population (9.98\%;
   90/902; CI 95\%; 8.10-12.12\%) and the enclosed population of La Mandria
   park (Piedmont, Italy) (65.58\%; 343/523; CI 95\%; 61.51-69.65\%). In
   both populations a significantly higher number of adults and females
   were found positive to PrV ELISA. Specific territorial data on PrV
   circulation in wild boars should be acquired from other regions for
   guiding risk-based measures in order to reduce the threat of AD
   re-infection in a more cost-effective manner.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the successful application of total reflection X-ray
   fluorescence spectroscopy (TXRF) for the identification of products
   obtained from mechanically separated meat (MSM), a very important issue
   for food quality and safety. According to the European Food Safety
   Authority, one of the most important parameters to distinguish MSM is
   the content of Ca. Consequently, the development of reliable and
   cost-effective analytical tools is very important to monitor the
   chemical composition of these foods.
   In this study, we have developed an analytical method for elemental
   analysis of meat samples based on total reflection X-ray fluorescence. A
   simple sample preparation by suspending the grinded meat sample in a
   solution of diluted Triton X-100 and polyvinyl alcohol in water showed
   to be the best for this kind of samples. Fresh chicken meat, chicken
   meat with different percentage of MSM, pure MSM and meat products
   prepared with MSM were analyzed. The content of K, Ca, Fe, Cu and Zn was
   determined. Results show that Ca, but also K and Fe are significant
   markers to distinguish MSM from fresh meat. A limit of 40\% MSM for
   differentiation was achieved by applying principal component analysis.
   The method accuracy was evaluated comparing the obtained results with
   those obtained after acidic digestion and ICP-MS analysis.},

Title = {Network-based assessment of the vulnerability of Italian regions to
   bovine brucellosis},
Journal = {PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {158},
Pages = {25-34},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The endemic circulation of bovine brucellosis in cattle herds has a
   markedly negative impact on economy, due to decreased fertility,
   increased abortion rates, reduced milk and meat production. It also
   poses a direct threat to human health. In Italy, despite the long
   lasting efforts and the considerable economic investment, complete
   eradication of this disease still eludes the southern regions, as
   opposed to the northern regions that are disease free. Here we
   introduced a novel quantitative network-based approach able to fully
   exploit the highly resolved databases of cattle trade movements and
   outbreak reports to yield estimates of the vulnerability of a cattle
   market to brucellosis. Tested on the affected regions, the introduced
   vulnerability indicator was shown to be accurate in predicting the
   number of bovine brucellosis outbreaks (Spearman r= 0.82, p= 0.04), thus
   confirming the suitability of our tool for epidemic risk assessment. We
   evaluated the dependence of regional vulnerability to brucellosis on a
   set of factors including premises spatial distribution, trading
   patterns, farming practices, herd market value, compliance to outbreak
   regulations, and exploring different epidemiological conditions. Animal
   trade movements were identified as a major route for brucellosis spread
   between farms (r = 0.85, p < 10(-5) between vulnerability and number of
   inbound movements), with an additional potential risk attributed to the
   use of shared pastures (r = 0.4, p = 0.04). By comparing the
   vulnerability of disease-free regions in the north to affected regions
   in the south, we found that more intense trade and higher market value
   of the cattle sector in the north (r = 0.56, p = 0.01) likely inducing
   more efficient biosafety measures, together with poor compliance to
   trade restrictions following outbreaks in the south were key factors
   explaining the diverse success in eradicating brucellosis. Our modeling
   scheme is both synthetic and effective in gauging regional vulnerability
   to brucellosis persistence. Its general formulation makes it adaptable
   to other diseases and host species, providing a useful tool for
   veterinary epidemiology and policy assessment.},

Abstract = {Animal assisted interventions (AAI) have become increasingly popular in
   Western countries during the last fifty years, attracting a lot of
   attention both from the general public and the scientific community. In
   Italy, similarly to other countries, this evolution has been accompanied
   by the diffusion of associations delivering AAI. What is the current
   state of AAI in Italy? How many realities are dealing with AAI? What
   professionals and animals are involved? The results of the questionnaire
   here reported have the objective to answer these questions, outlining a
   snapshot of the distribution and the main features of AAI within Italian
   territory. According to the 208 respondents, the sector has seen a
   remarkable expansion over the last twenty years. AAI providers are
   located mainly in the North and Centre of the country, the majority of
   them are arranged in associations or AAI specialized centers and work
   mainly with dogs and equids in animal assisted activity (AAA) programs
   addressed to disabled people and children. The picture of the sector
   still appears fragmented in particular regarding team of professionals
   involved and their training; nonetheless, the recent set up of national
   guidelines by the Italian authorities has the objective of standardizing
   the field and defining best practices for each type of intervention.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {To provide up-to-date information on the occurrence of Cryptosporidium
   in pre-weaned calves from Sardinia (Italy), the species implicated and
   their zoonotic potential, 147 faecal samples from 22 cattle herds were
   microscopically examined for Cryptosporidium oocysts; positive isolates
   were molecularly characterised. A questionnaire was developed to
   identify risk factors for Cryptosporidium infection. Overall, the
   percentage of positive calves and farms was 38.8 and 68.2\%,
   respectively. The SSU rRNA-based PCR identified two Cryptosporidium
   species, Cryptosporidium parvum (95.8\%) and C. bovis (4.2\%). Sequence
   analyses of the glycoprotein (gp60) gene revealed that all C. parvum
   isolates belonged to the subtype family IIa (IIaA15G2R1 and IIaA16G3R1),
   with the exception of three isolates that belonged to the subtype family
   IId (IIdA20G1b and IIdA20). Mixed logistic regression results indicated
   that calves aged 15-21 days were more likely to be
   Cryptosporidium-positive. The risk of being positive was also
   significantly higher in herds from Central Sardinia and in farms using
   non-slatted flooring. In addition, the application of disinfectants and
   milk replacers was significantly associated with higher Cryptosporidium
   prevalence. In contrast, the risk of being positive was significantly
   reduced in halofuginone-treated calves. Our results reveal that a
   significant percentage of suckling calves are carriers of zoonotic
   subtypes of C. parvum. Thus, both healthy and diarrhoeic calves younger
   than 1 month may represent a risk for the transmission of
   cryptosporidiosis in humans and animals.},

Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Introduction - A few large surveys on tumour prevalence in goats
   indicate that tumours in general are quite common in this species.
   Reviews of neoplastic diseases in goats indicate a prevalence ranging
   from 0,8 to 11\%. However, osteogenic tumours arising from facial bones
   in goats are rare. Regarding oral localization only a few mesenchymal
   tumours have been described arising from the gengiva.
   Case presentation - A 4-year old, female crossbred goat was referred
   with a history of dysorexia and a slow growing painful mass on the face.
   On physical examination the animal showed poor body condition and the
   left side of the face was deformed by a voluminous mass which, at the
   inspection of the oral cavity, displaced the maxillary teeth.
   Differential diagnoses included osteomyelitis and benign (osteoma,
   chondroma, ossifying and non ossifying fibroma, odontogenic tumours) as
   well as malignant (osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma) mesenchymal tumours
   arising from either the connective tissue and bone. The goat was
   euthanized because of the extension of the lesion and a complete
   necropsy was performed. Grossly, the face was deformed by the presence
   of a hard mass arising from the branch of the left mandible.
   Histologically the oral mass was composed of heterogeneous proliferation
   of malignant osteoblasts intermigled with brightly eosinophilic strands
   or island of osteoid matrix. Neoplastic cells, interpreted as malignant
   osteoblasts, were characterized by plump to round or spindle-shape
   morphology, with moderate basophilic cytoplasm and an eccentrically
   located voluminous nucleus containing a large prominent nucleolus.
   Mitotic figures were found and were either bipolar and atypical. At
   necropsy no metastases were found and the final diagnosis was
   non-metastasizing mandibular osteoblastic osteosarcoma.
   Conclusion - In conclusion, regardless the type of tumour, the goat was
   euthanized because of the extension and the severity of the lesion.
   Necropsy and histological examination were necessary to correctly
   classify the tumour as a non-metastasizing mandibular osteosarcoma.},

   TB-ELISA method and a novel TB multiplex test, based on Luminex
   technology, were developed to detect antibodies to multiple antigen
   targets. The performance levels of the two tests were evaluated and
   compared using selected panels of samples having known TB states. The
   TB-ELISA test (containing five antigens, including PPDb) had a
   sensitivity (Se) of 74.2\% and a specificity (Sp) of 94.9\%, while the
   TB-Luminex test had higher Se (79.0\%) and Sp (99.1\%) rates even when
   only one reactive antigen was used to classify the test as positive. If
   a more restrictive criterion, requiring two positive antigens to
   classify the test as positive, was used, then the TB-ELISA's Sp rate
   increased to 99.8\% but the Se decreased to 61.3\%, while the TB-Luminex
   test's Sp rate increased to 100\% but the Se decreased to 51.2\%.
   TB-ELISA and TB-Luminex were applied to a panel of 257 sera collected
   from bTB-positive herds, as determined by a post-mortem inspection. They
   showed good performance levels, identifying 49 (80.3\%) and 48 (78.7\%),
   respectively, of 61 samples that had tested positive by the intradermal
   tuberculin (IDT) test and/or interferon-gamma assay. In addition,
   TB-ELISA and TB-Luminex were able to identify 60 and 42 samples as
   positive, respectively, out of the 196 samples that tested negative to
   IDT and interferon-gamma at the time of serum collection. Subsequent IDT
   tests performed after 1-2 months, confirmed the positivity of 18
   samples, indicating the strategic value of having two serological assays
   to detect TB-infected herds that were not reactive to initial IDT
   testing, thereby allowing for the rapid control of outbreaks and
   eradication of the disease.},

Abstract = {Orthopoxviruses (OPVs) are diffused over the complete Eurasian
   continent, but previously described strains are mostly from northern
   Europe, and few infections have been reported from Italy. Here we
   present the extended genomic characterization of OPV Abatino, a novel
   OPV isolated in Italy from an infected Tonkean macaque, with zoonotic
   potential. Phylogenetic analysis based on 102 conserved OPV genes (core
   gene set) showed that OPV Abatino is most closely related to the
   Ectromelia virus species (ECTV), although placed on a separate branch of
   the phylogenetic tree, bringing substantial support to the hypothesis
   that this strain may be part of a novel OPV clade. Extending the
   analysis to the entire set of genes (coding sequences, CDS) further
   substantiated this hypothesis. In fact the genome of OPV Abatino
   included more CDS than ECTV; most of the extra genes (mainly located in
   the terminal genome regions), showed the highest similarity with cowpox
   virus (CPXV); however vaccinia virus (VACV) and monkeypox virus (MPXV)
   were the closest OPV for certain CDS. These findings suggest that OPV
   Abatino could be the result of complex evolutionary events, diverging
   from any other previously described OPV, and may indicate that
   previously reported cases in Italy could represent the tip of the
   iceberg yet to be explored.},

Abstract = {A flock of sheep in Central Sicily was affected by a severe outbreak of
   contagious agalactia (CA) caused byMycoplasma agalactiae, affecting
   nearly 30\% resulting in a large drop in milk production. Many ewes had
   warm and swollen udders that often became sclerotic and was accompanied
   by keratoconjunctivitis and arthritis in both adults and young. As
   antibiotic treatment appeared ineffective, the whole flock was given two
   doses of an inactivated vaccine againstM agalactiaetwo weeks apart. A
   small group was selected for close examination and additional tests. A
   fortnight after the last vaccination mycoplasma excretion fell in all
   but one of the selected ewes and was undetectable in all but two animals
   two weeks after that. In nearly all the selected ewes, there was an
   improvement in milk quality and udder condition. This work provided
   preliminary evidence for the continued use of CA vaccines to slow or
   prevent disease progression.},

Abstract = {The recent outbreak of Salmonella Agona linked to the consumption of
   infant formula (powdered formula) has rekindled the attention about the
   correct procedures for preparation and use of these products.
   International guidelines have already been published so far,
   particularly in association with Cronobacter sakazakii in early 2000s.
   FAO/WHO suggested to reconstitute formula with water at no less than 70
   degrees C. We therefore contaminated powdered formula with low levels of
   Salmonella spp and C sakazakii to evaluate the pathogens inactivation
   during the formula preparation using water at 70 degrees C. In these
   conditions we observed a survival of both pathogens, indicating that the
   suggested recommendations may be not enough to guarantee the safety of
   this product. Higher temperatures are needed to reduce the biological
   risk, even if it may be not easily realized in actual domestic
   conditions. Moreover, the impact on the nutritional value of
   reconstituted formulas should be evaluated.},

Abstract = {In February 2017 a case of Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS) was reported
   to the National Registry of HUS in an adult living in Northern Italy.
   Stool specimens from the patient and his family contacts were collected
   and the analyses led to the isolation of a Locus of Enterocyte
   Effacement (LEE)-negative Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2)-producing Escherichia
   coll. The epidemiological investigations performed brought to collect
   fecal samples from the animals reared in a farm held by the case's
   family and a mixture of bovine and swine feces proved positive for Shiga
   toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) and yielded the isolation of a
   LEE-negative stx2-positive E. coli strain. Further characterization by
   whole genome sequencing led to identify the isolates as two identical
   O2:H27 hybrid Enterotoxigenic Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (ETEC-STEC).
   Sequencing of a high molecular weight plasmid present in the human
   isolate disclosed a peculiar plasmid harboring virulence genes
   characteristic for both pathotypes, including the enterohemolysin-coding
   gene and sta1, encoding the heat stable enterotoxin. Moreover, a
   complete fae locus encoding the ETEC F4 fimbriae could be identified,
   including a novel variant of faeG gene responsible for the production of
   the main structural subunit of the fimbriae. This novel faeG showed
   great diversity in the nucleotidic sequence when compared with the
   reference genes encoding the swine F4 allelic variants, whereas at the
   amino acid sequence level the predicted protein sequence showed some
   similarity with FaeG from E. coli strains of bovine origin. Further
   investigation on the plasmid region harboring the newly identified faeG
   allelic variant allowed to identify similar plasmids in NCBI sequence
   database, as part of the genome of other previously uncharacterized
   ETEC-STEC strains of bovine origin, suggesting that the novel F4-like
   fimbriae may play a role in bovine host specificity.},

   enumerate BALOs and to evaluate their prey specificity and predation
   efficiency. Transmission electron microscopy and 16S rRNA analysis were
   used to identify them. Means of BALOs counts ranged from 5<bold></bold>0
   PFU per ml (March 2017) to 98<bold></bold>6 PFU per ml (August 2016).
   HBXCO1 had the ability to attack all tested prey strains of V.
   parahaemolyticus, Vibrio cholerae non-O1/O139 and Vibrio vulnificus, but
   it did not prey on non-Vibrio strains and V. alginolyticus under the
   tested conditions.
   ConclusionsBdellovibrio and like organisms capable of infecting
   pathogenic vibrios are naturally present in seawater of the Adriatic,
   Italy. Isolate HBXCO1 shows prey specificity preferentially for the
   Vibrio genus and high predatory efficiency towards a wide range of
   pathogenic strains.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyThe public impact of V.
   parahaemolyticus, non-O1/O139V. cholerae and V. vulnificus in bivalves
   is relevant and current decontamination processes are not always
   effective. We believe that the predator HBXCO1 represents a potential
   candidate for the development of strategies of biocontrol of pathogenic
   vibrios in bivalves from harvesting to trade.},

Title = {Testicular Degeneration and Infertility following Arbovirus Infection},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {92},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Arboviruses can cause a variety of clinical signs, including febrile
   illness, arthritis, encephalitis, and hemorrhagic fever. The recent Zika
   epidemic highlighted the possibility that arboviruses may also
   negatively affect the male reproductive tract. In this study, we focused
   on bluetongue virus (BTV), the causative agent of bluetongue and one of
   the major arboviruses of ruminants. We show that rams that recovered
   from bluetongue displayed signs of testicular degeneration and
   azoospermia up to 100 days after the initial infection. Importantly,
   testicular degeneration was induced in rams experimentally infected with
   either a high (BTV-1(IT2006))- or a low (BTV-1(IT2013))-virulence strain
   of BTV. Rams infected with the low-virulence BTV strain displayed
   testicular lesions in the absence of other major clinical signs.
   Testicular lesions in BTV-infected rams were due to viral replication in
   the endothelial cells of the peritubular areas of the testes, resulting
   in stimulation of a type I interferon response, reduction of
   testosterone biosynthesis by Leydig cells and destruction of Sertoli
   cells and the blood-testis barrier in more severe cases. Hence, BTV
   induces testicular degeneration and disruption of spermatogenesis by
   replicating solely in the endothelial cells of the peritubular areas
   unlike other gonadotropic viruses. This study shows that a naturally
   occurring arboviral disease can cause testicular degeneration and affect
   male fertility at least temporarily.
   IMPORTANCE During the recent Zika epidemic, it has become apparent that
   arboviruses could potentially cause reproductive health problems in male
   patients. Little is known regarding the effects that arboviruses have on
   the male reproductive tract. Here, we studied bluetongue virus (BTV), an
   arbovirus of ruminants, and its effects on the testes of rams. We show
   that BTV was able to induce testicular degeneration in naturally and
   experimentally infected rams. Testicular degeneration was caused by BTV
   replication in the endothelial cells of the peritubular area surrounding
   the seminiferous tubules (the functional unit of the testes) and was
   associated with a localized type I interferon response, destruction of
   the cells supporting the developing germinal cells (Sertoli cells), and
   reduction of testosterone synthesis. As a result of BTV infection, rams
   became azoospermic. This study highlights that problems in the male
   reproductive tract caused by arboviruses could be more common than
   previously thought.},

Abstract = {Veterinary antimicrobial use could lead to problems such as the spread
   of antimicrobial resistance or the presence of residues in
   animal-derived products for human consumption. Related to this, data on
   drug consumption is in strong demand. The aims of this study are
   therefore to evaluate a regional Defined Daily Dose (DDDvet\_Umbria) for
   all of the antimicrobials prescribed in Umbria during 2014 and to
   analyse prescriptions for cattle, swine, small ruminants, poultry,
   rainbow trout, and food-producing horses. Consumption, prevalence, and
   intensity of use indicators are calculated. Swine, poultry, and fish
   were the most treated species during 2014. Beta-lactams were the most
   frequently consumed antimicrobials for these species. Critically
   important antimicrobials were mostly prescribed for swine, poultry, and
   cattle. Colistin was the most frequently used critically important
   antimicrobial to treat swine and poultry. This study helps to better
   understand antimicrobial consumption in food-producing animals by
   overcoming the limitations of other proposed approaches. Our data are
   useful for quantifying antimicrobial consumption, identifying
   problematic farms, and supports a comparison among different animal
   species. Results highlight that the critical sectors in drug consumption
   - where the highest use of antibiotics were found - are swine, poultry,
   and trout farms.},

Abstract = {The epidemiology of invasive listeriosis in humans appears to be weakly
   characterized in Poland, the sixth most populous member state of the
   European Union. We obtained antimicrobial susceptibility data,
   PCR-serogroups and genotypic profiles for 344 invasive isolates of
   Listeria monocytogenes, collected between 1997 and 2013 in Poland. All
   isolates were susceptible to the 10 tested antimicrobials, except one
   that was resistant to tetracycline and minocycline and harbored the
   tet(M), tet(A) and tet(C) genes. Overall, no increasing MIC values were
   observed during the study period. Four PCR-serogroups were observed: IVb
   (55.8\%), IIa (34.3\%), IIb (8.1\%) and IIc (1.8\%). We identified
   clonal complexes (CCs) and epidemic clones (ECs) previously involved in
   outbreaks worldwide, with the most prevalent CCs/ECs being: CC6/ECII
   (32.6\%), CC1/ECI (17.2\%), CC8/ECV (6.1\%) and CC2/ECIV (5.5\%). The
   present study is the first extensive analysis of Polish L. monocytogenes

Abstract = {The oomycete Aphanomyces astaci is the causative agent of crayfish
   plague in native European freshwater crayfish. Molecular analyses showed
   that several distinct genotype groups of this pathogen, apparently
   associated with different original host taxa, are present in Europe.
   Tracking their distribution may contribute to understanding the
   introduction pathways of A. astaci. We used microsatellite markers to
   genotype the pathogen strains involved in 7 mass mortalities of the
   endangered indigenous crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes that occurred
   between 2009 and 2016 in the Abruzzi and Molise regions, central Italy.
   Three A. astaci genotype groups (A, B, and D, with the latter
   represented by 2 distinct multilocus genotypes) were identified,
   suggesting the existence of multiple infection sources even in a
   relatively small area. Most crayfish plague episodes were due to
   genotype groups associated with the North American host species
   Pacifastacus leniusculus and Procambarus clarkii, although these
   crayfish are not widespread in the study area. A. astaci genotype group
   A was detected not only in crayfish plague outbreaks but also in
   apparently healthy Astacus leptodactylus imported for human consumption
   from Armenia and kept alive in an aquaculture facility. Imports of
   chronically infected A. leptodactylus from Armenia, Turkey, and possibly
   Eastern Europe are an underestimated introduction pathway for A. astaci.
   Although we cannot exclude the presence of latently infected native
   populations of A. pallipes in the region, A. astaci infections in
   legally imported crayfish species considered vulnerable to crayfish
   plague may represent further reservoirs of A. astaci; this should be
   reflected in the policies regulating the trade of live crayfish.},

Title = {Anisakis sensitization in different population groups and public health
   impact: A systematic review},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 20},
Abstract = {Anisakis simplex spp. sensitization rates have increased worldwide, with
   a significant impact on health-care systems. To date, no clear-cut
   diagnostic criteria and laboratory algorithm have been established, so
   anisakiasis still represents an under-reported health problem whose
   clinical manifestations, when present, mimic the much more common
   allergic and digestive disorders. Aim of the study was to systematically
   review the available literature on the prevalence of sensitization
   against Anisakis in the general population and in specific population
   groups, taking into account the impact of the different available
   diagnostic techniques on the epidemiological data. Following the
   Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
   (PRISMA) statement, relevant papers reporting Anisakis sensitization
   epidemiological data were found covering a period ranging from 1996 to
   February 2017. Overall, 41 studies comprising 31,701 participants from
   eleven countries were included in the qualitative synthesis. General
   asymptomatic population resulted sensitized to Anisakis in 0.4 to 27.4\%
   of cases detected by means of indirect ELISA or ImmunoCAP specific IgE
   detection, and between 6.6\% and 19.6\% of the samples by Skin prick
   test (SPT). Occupationally exposed workers (fishermen, fishmongers and
   workers of fish-processing industries) documented specific IgE between
   11.7\% and 50\% of cases, whereas SPT positivity ranged between 8\% and
   46.4\%. Symptomatic allergic patients to any kind of allergen were found
   to be positive to Anisakis specific IgE detection between 0.0\% (in
   children with mastocytosis) to 81.3\% (among adults with shellfish
   allergy). Results highlighted that hypersensitivity prevalence estimates
   varied widely according to geographical area, characteristics of the
   population studied, diagnostic criteria and laboratory assays. Further
   studies are needed to overcome the documented misdiagnosis by improving
   the diagnostic approach and, consequently, providing more affordable
   estimates in order to address public health interventions on populations
   at high risk of exposure to Anisakis and to tailor health services
   related to specific groups.},

Title = {West Nile virus transmission and human infection risk in Veneto (Italy):
   a modelling analysis},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {SEP 18},
Abstract = {An intensified and continuous West Nile virus (WNV) spread across
   northern Italy has been observed since 2008, which caused more than one
   hundred reported human infections until 2016. Veneto is one of the
   Italian regions where WNV is considered endemic, and the greatest
   intensity of circulation was observed during 2013 and 2016. By using
   entomological data collected across the region in those years, we
   calibrated a temperature-driven mathematical model through a Bayesian
   approach that simulates the WNV infection in an avian population with
   seasonal demography. We considered two alternative routes of life cycle
   re-activation of the virus at the beginning of each vector breeding
   season: in the first one the virus is maintained by infected birds, in
   the other by diapausing mosquitoes previously infected. Afterwards, we
   computed seasonal risk curves for human infection and quantified how
   they translate into reported symptomatic cases. According to our
   results, WNV is more likely to be re-activated each year via previously
   infected mosquitoes. The highest probability of human infection is
   expected to occur in August, consistently with observations. Our
   epidemiological estimates can be of particular interest for public
   health authorities, to support decisions in term of designing efficient
   surveillance plans and preventive measures.},

Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Dourine is a parasitic venereal disease of equines caused by T.
   equiperdum. Humoral antibodies are found in infected animals, but
   diagnosis of dourine must include history, clinical, and pathological
   findings in addition to serology. Complement Fixation Test (CFT) is the
   Office International des Epizooties (OIE) recommended test for
   international trade; however, some uninfected equines may give
   inconsistent or nonspecific reactions in CFT due to the
   anticomplementary effects of their sera. In this study an Indirect
   Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (iELISA) was developed. This test
   could be used to confirm positive serological cases of dourine or to
   solve inconclusive results obtained by CFT, in addition to Indirect
   Fluorescent Antibody Test (IFAT) and a Chemiluminescent Immunoblotting
   Assay (cIB). Six-hundred-and-six CFT negative sera and 140 sera positive
   to CFT and IFAT were tested by iELISA using OVI C equiperdum as antigen.
   Results were expressed as percentage of positivity and the optimum
   cut-off value determined sensitivity and specificity of 100\%. All
   positive sera, tested by cIB, were confirmed as positive. Additionally,
   twenty seven sera, low-positive at CFT and negative by IFAT, were tested
   with iELISA and cIB. All samples resulted negative by clB and one of
   them was positive in ELISA. Our results suggest that iELISA and cIB may
   be used as alternative or supplementary confirmatory tests whenever
   other recommended serological methods are inconclusive or doubtful.},

   observational study through the submission of questionnaires to three
   target populations: fishermen who fish exclusively in Bolsena Lake,
   restaurateurs whose businesses are close to the lake and general
   population living in the province of Viterbo. Results showed hazardous

   a poor knowledge of opisthorchiasis and preventative healthcare
   measures.},

   Two juvenile and well-preserved male striped dolphins (Stenella
   coeruleoalba), found stranded along the Tuscany and Latium coasts of
   Italy in 2015 and 2016, respectively, showed typical skin lesions
   ascribable to TSD. Histological, ultrastructural and biomolecular
   investigations confirmed a poxviral aetiology for the aforementioned
   skin lesions. To our knowledge, this should be the first report of TSD
   in cetaceans stranded along the Italian coastline. As organochlorines
   like PCBs and DDTs are known to be highly immunotoxic, the tissue loads
   of these contaminants were evaluated, in order to increase our knowledge
   on their potential role as well as on the relationships between the
   level of exposure to these pollutants and poxviral infection's
   occurrence.},

Title = {A Set of Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reactions for Genomic Detection of
   Nine Edible Insect Species in Foods},

Abstract = {On 1 January 2018, a new regulation on `Novel Food' has come into
   application in the EU. Insects and insect-based products are therefore
   included among the categories of food which constitute novel foods.
   Insects are nutrient-rich, produce fewer greenhouse gases and ammonia
   than conventional livestock, and have high feed conversion efficiency.
   Insects may be an alternative food source in the near future, but
   consideration of insects as a food requires scrutiny due to the risk of
   allergens.The aim of the present study was to develop a set of multiplex
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect nine edible insect species
   directly in foods. Four sets of mPCRs were designed to detect Locusta
   migratoria migratorioides (Reiche \& Fairmaire, 1849) (Orthoptera:
   Acrididae), Tenebrio molitor (Linnaeus, 1758) (Coleoptera:
   Tenebrionidae) (mPCR-I), Acheta domesticus (Linnaeus, 1758) (Orthoptera:
   Gryllidae), Bombyx mori (Linnaeus, 1758) (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae
   (mPCR-II), Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer, 1797) (Coleoptera:
   Tenebrionidae), Schistocerca gregaria (Forskal, 1775) (Orthoptera:
   Acrididae), Zophobas atratus (Fabricius, 1775)
   (Coleoptera:Tenebrionidae) (mPCR-III), Galleria mellonella (Linnaeus,
   1758) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), and Gryllodes sigillatus (Walker, 1869)
   (Orthoptera: Gryllidae) (mPCR-IV). Results demonstrate that the panel of
   mPCRs allowed a rapid genetic identification of the insect species and
   has proved to be a sensible and highly discriminatory method. The assay
   is a potential tool in issues related to the labeling of products and
   food safety, in case of allergic consumers.},

Abstract = {Congenital fibropapillomatosis of the gingiva and oral mucosa and
   epidermal hyperplasia of the lip are described, for the first time, in
   two newborn lambs. Expression of the E5 oncoprotein of bovine
   deltapapillomavirus types 2 (BPV-2) and-13 (BPV-13) was detected in both
   fibropapillomas and the hyperplastic epidermal cells suggesting the BPV
   infection was the cause of the proliferative lesions. No DNA sequences
   of BPV-1 and BPV-14 were detected. Both BPV-2 and BPV-13 DNA were also
   amplified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of the newborn
   lambs' dams. The concordance between BPV genotypes detected in the blood
   of dam and the oral and skin pathological samples of their offspring
   suggests that a vertical hematogeneous transmission was most likely
   source of BPV infection. Immunoblotting revealed the presence of E5
   dimers allowing the viral protein to be biologically active. E5 dimers
   bind and activate the platelet derived growth factor beta receptor (PDGF
   beta R), a major molecular mechanism contributing to disease. The
   detection of E5 protein within the proliferating cells therefore adds
   further evidence that the BPV infection was the cause of the
   proliferative lesions seen in these lambs. This is the first evidence of
   vertical transmission of BPVs in sheep resulting in a clinical disease.},

Abstract = {In recent years, bats have been found to harbour many viruses, raising
   several questions about their role as reservoirs and potential
   disseminators of zoonotic viruses. We investigated the presence of six
   virus families in bats in three regions of Central-Southern Italy.
   Astroviruses were identified in seven of 13 bat species. Sequence
   analysis revealed marked genetic heterogeneity among the astroviruses
   identified, with nucleotide identity ranging between 60.26\% and
   87.62\%. Astrovirus diversity was not associated with the bat species,
   the geographic areas or the bat colony, suggesting the circulation of
   several astrovirus strains in Italian ecosystems. Genetic
   diversification and interspecies transmission appear common in bat
   astroviruses and could provide, potentially, the bases for transmission
   to humans and other mammals. Yet overemphasizing this risk might have
   detrimental consequences for bat conservation and preservation of the
   important ecosystem services bats provide.},

Abstract = {In 2016 and 2017, 509 raw milk samples were collected from bulk milk
   tanks in 315 dairy farms in Parma province, Italy. Yersinia
   pseudotuberculosis was never detected. Yersinia enterocolitica was
   isolated from 17 (3.1\%) bulk milk samples by culture methods. Estimated
   apparent prevalence was 3.91\% in 2016, and 2.63\% in 2017, with no
   significant difference between the two years (df = 1; p-value = 0.419).
   Five BT 2/O: 5,27 and 12 BT 1A isolates were detected. The most common
   virulence genes (ail, inv, virF, yadA, ystA, ystB, myfA, irp2, fyuA)
   were screened and the genes ail, virF, yadA, ystA were harboured only by
   2 O: 5,27 isolates. The Italian strains were very close by SNP analysis.
   The 2 O:5,27 isolates showed a unique antimicrobial resistance pattern,
   being resistant to amoxicillin, cefoxitin, cephalexin and amoxicillin
   clavulanic acid. The study suggests that consumption of raw or
   improperly pasteurised milk may be hazardous for the consumers. (C) 2018

   Abstract No data have been published on the use of infrared thermography

   animal approach (VAA) tests were conducted (and filmed) on five ewes
   before and after being restrained. The restraining process was performed
   by a handler for five minutes. IRT was used during restraint and the VAA
   tests. The lacrimal caruncle temperature was significantly higher during
   restraint and in the VAA test after the restraint compared with the VAA
   test before the restraint (Wilcoxon's test; p = 0.04). The latency
   period until first contact was longer in the second VAA test (132 s)
   than in the first one (60 s). Our preliminary results suggest that IRT,

Abstract = {Despite a significantdecrease in acute hepatitis A in the last 2 decades
   in Italy, outbreaks were observed occurring mostly in southern Italy. In
   this study, Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was used to analyze the
   origin of these epidemics. With this aim, 5 different data sets of
   hepatitis A virus sequences were built to perform genotyping by the
   neighbor-joining method to estimate the evolutionary rates by using a
   Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo approach and to investigate the
   demographic history by independent Markov chain Monte Carlo runs
   enforcing both a strict and relaxed clock. The estimated mean value of
   the evolutionary rate, representing Ia and Ib strains, was 1.21x10(-3)
   and 2.0x10(-3) substitutions/site/year, respectively. The Bayesian
   maximum clade credibility tree of hepatitis A virus (HAV) Ia and Ib
   strains showed that Italian sequences mostly formed separate clusters.
   The root of the time for the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) for HAV
   Ia and Ib strains dated back to 1981 and to 1988, respectively, showing
   in both cases different epidemic entrances. Phylodynamic analysis showed
   that genotype Ia increased in 1997, when the Apulia epidemic started,
   then suffered a bottleneck, probably consequent to vaccination and to
   the herd immunity, followed by a new increase in virus population in the
   years 2013-2014consequent to the epidemic caused by the ingestion of
   mixed frozen berries. A similar trend without an evident bottleneck was
   observed also in the case of genotype Ib. In conclusion, the Bayesian
   phylogenetic analysis represents a good tool to measure the
   effectiveness of the public health plans used for HAV control.},

Abstract = {Endotoxin contamination is a serious concern for manufacturers of
   biological products and vaccines in terms of not only quality but also
   safety parameters. We evaluated the endotoxin presence in different
   veterinary autogenous vaccines produced by the Pharmaceutical Unit at
   the Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute of Umbria and Marche ``Togo
   Rosati{''} (IZSUM). According to the 3Rs principles (Replace, Reduce,
   Refine), which aim to progressively reduce animal use in the quality
   control process, we tested the vaccines obtained from gram-negative
   bacteria and adjuvants by the limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay. The
   results revealed low endotoxin concentrations compared to available data
   in the literature and represent the first report of the application of
   the 3Rs principles to veterinary autogenous vaccines production in
   Italy.},

Title = {A severe outbreak of listeriosis in central Italy with a rare pulsotype
   associated with processed pork products},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1351-1360},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Purpose. From May 2015 to March 2016, an outbreak due to Listeria
   monocytogenes serotype 1/2a and clinical pulsotype never previously
   isolated in Europe occurred in central Italy, involving 24 confirmed
   clinical cases. The article provides a description of the outbreak and
   the investigation carried out by a multidisciplinary network.
   Methodology. Epidemiological and microbiological surveillance was
   conducted to confirm the outbreak and to detect the food vehicle of
   infection. The origin and destination of the implicated food and its
   ingredients were investigated by tracing-back and -forward
   investigation.
   Results. Next-generation sequencing confirmed the unique outbreak
   strain. On 4 January 2016, a L. monocytogenes strain with pulsotype
   indistinguishable from that isolated from clinical cases in the outbreak
   was detected in a sample of hog head cheese purchased from a retail
   supermarket by one of the patients. The hog head cheese was produced by
   a small meat processing plant in the Marche region, where
   microbiological investigation confirmed environmental and food
   contamination by the outbreak strain. Plant production was suspended and
   all contaminated batches of the hog head cheese were withdrawn from the
   market by 19 February by local health authority. We subsequently
   observed a sharp decline in clinical cases, the last being reported on
   11 March 2016.
   Conclusion. The key factor in the timely conclusion of this
   investigation was intersectoral collaboration among epidemiologists,
   microbiologists, veterinarians, statisticians and health and food safety
   authorities at national, regional and local levels.},

Title = {Core Genome Multilocus Sequence Typing and Single Nucleotide
   Polymorphism Analysis in the Epidemiology of Brucella melitensis
   Infections},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {56},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) using next-generation
   sequencing (NGS) technology has become a widely accepted method for
   microbiology laboratories in the application of molecular typing for
   outbreak tracing and genomic epidemiology. Several studies demonstrated
   the usefulness of WGS data analysis through single-nucleotide
   polymorphism (SNP) calling from a reference sequence analysis for
   Brucella melitensis, whereas gene-by-gene comparison through core-genome
   multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) has not been explored so far. The
   current study developed an allele-based cgMLST method and compared its
   performance to that of the genome-wide SNP approach and the traditional
   multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) on a defined
   sample collection. The data set was comprised of 37 epidemiologically
   linked animal cases of brucellosis as well as 71 isolates with unknown
   epidemiological status, composed of human and animal samples collected
   in Italy. The cgMLST scheme generated in this study contained 2,704
   targets of the B. melitensis 16M reference genome. We established the
   potential criteria necessary for inclusion of an isolate into a
   brucellosis outbreak cluster to be <= 6 loci in the cgMLST and <= 7 in
   WGS SNP analysis. Higher phylogenetic distance resolution was achieved
   with cgMLST and SNP analysis than with MLVA, particularly for strains
   belonging to the same lineage, thereby allowing diverse and unrelated
   genotypes to be identified with greater confidence. The application of a
   cgMLST scheme to the characterization of B. melitensis strains provided
   insights into the epidemiology of this pathogen, and it is a candidate
   to be a benchmark tool for outbreak investigations in human and animal
   brucellosis.},

Abstract = {We report detection and full-genome characterization of a novel
   orthopoxvirus (OPXV) responsible for a fatal infection in a cat. The
   virus induced skin lesions histologically characterized by leukocyte
   infiltration and eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions. Different PCR
   approaches were unable to assign the virus to a defined OPXV species.
   Large amounts of typical brick-shaped virions, morphologically related
   to OPXV, were observed by electron microscopy. This OPXV strain
   (Italy\_09/17) was isolated on cell cultures and embryonated eggs.
   Phylogenetic analysis of 9 concatenated genes showed that this virus was
   distantly related to cowpox virus, more closely related to to ectromelia
   virus, and belonged to the same cluster of an OPXV recently isolated
   from captive macaques in Italy. Extensive epidemiologic surveillance in
   cats and rodents will assess whether cats are incidental hosts and
   rodents are the main reservoir of the virus. The zoonotic potential of
   this novel virus also deserves further investigation.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the cost of diarrhoea in lambs on dairy sheep
   farms located in Grosseto (Italy). Farmers' profits have recently
   declined due to a stable product price but increasing production costs.
   Animal diseases have a cascade of effects on farm productivity. Lamb
   enteric disease outbreaks, which result in mortality in the herd and
   reduced weight gain, can drastically compromise the income of farmers.
   An economic analysis of the impact of an outbreak of diarrhoea in lambs
   was thus performed, evaluating the cost of disease based on the main
   visible production losses (such as mortality, reduced weight gain and
   variation in milk production). A sensitivity analysis was also conducted
   by applying different observed ranges of prevalence and mortality
   associated with the disease. Finally, an economic scenario analysis was
   performed, considering different in-farm management options for
   delivering lambs to the abattoir, i.e. early, standard and late
   delivery. The results showed that a dairy sheep farm with around 300
   lambs that delivers them to the abattoir at 30 days of age would
   experience a loss of between 50 and 1200 Euro during an outbreak of
   diarrhoea with a prevalence of 34.21 (23.54-44.88)\% and a mortality of
   15.69 (9.98-21.4)\%.},

Abstract = {Genealogical relationships among colony members, inbreeding status, and
   presence of hybrids are crucial data that can assist zoo curators in
   captive colony management and decision-making on relocation for
   reproduction.This study employed molecular markers to study a large
   colony (n= 56) of African Penguin hosted in an Italian biopark. A panel
   of 15 STRs (single tandem repeats) was selected, and genotype data were
   analyzed using COLONY software to determine parentage relationships and
   compare the existing studbook information to a pedigree built from
   genetic analyses. The existence of extra-pair mating and the presence of
   hybrids were investigated: discrepancies in kinship relationships
   emerged following molecular parentage analysis and 10 unknown genetic
   relationships were revealed. Infidelity of one member of the pair was
   observed in 6 cases and extra-pair copulation was assessed by genetic
   analysis in 2 episodes. One member of the colony was found to be a
   hybrid (S. demersus x S. humboldti); his progeny, derived by extra-pair
   copulation, was traced.Three other hidden hybrids were discovered and
   assessed using the identified candidate private alleles. Overall, our
   results demonstrate that molecular methods to confirm parentage and
   analyze relatedness among colony members are a valuable tool to
   complement studbook-based genetic management of African penguin captive
   populations. Because a variety of behavioral dynamics (e.g., extra-pair
   mating) can make observations ineffective in some species and because
   molecular markers outperform studbook in identifying the presence of
   hybrids, reliance on studbook information alone is not recommended.},

Abstract = {Cardiac laceration with non-penetrating chest trauma is reported as a
   common cause of death in human following rapid deceleration in
   high-speed vehicular accident. In contrast, in veterinary medicine,
   traumatic rupture of heart and great-vessel structures appears to be an
   uncommon cause of death. Here we report three cases of cardiac
   laceration following non-penetrating chest trauma in a one cat and two
   dogs. In two of these cases, necropsy revealed a rupture of the heart
   associated with fractures of the ribs and lung contusion; only one case
   did not exhibit any external chest injury but revealed pericardial tear
   associated with hemothorax following rupture of the right auricle of the
   heart. However, in all three presented cases, the thoracic location of
   the injuries allowed to conclude that the cause of the cardiac rupture
   was due to a direct impact of the chest wall with a high speed object
   and consequent transmission of the kinetic force and compression of the
   heart between left and right thorax. These case reports underline the
   importance of a systematic and complete macroscopic evaluation of the
   heart in all cases of death following non-penetrating chest trauma in
   dog and cat such as in human. They also highlight how, in clinical and
   forensic practice, the cardiac injury following blunt chest trauma
   should be ruled out even in the cases of absence of external chest
   injury. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Fishing activities are considered one of the most relevant threats for
   cetaceans and sea turtles conservation since these animals are sometimes
   found dead entangled in fishing gears. Currently, postmortem diagnosis
   is based mainly on the presence of nets and lines on the body and the
   related marks and injuries evident at gross examination. A more detailed
   and objective evidence is needed to clarify doubts cases and the diatoms
   technique, used in forensic human medicine, could support drowning
   diagnosis also in this field. Diatoms' investigation was implemented to
   be applied in marine vertebrate on 8 striped (Stenella coeruleoalba) and
   1 bottlenose (Tursiops truncatus) dolphins and 5 sea turtles (Caretta
   caretta) stranded along the Italian coastlines with a likely cause of
   death hypothized on necropsies carried out by veterinary pathologists.
   Diatoms were microscopically searched in the bone marrow collected from
   long bones implementing protocols used in human medicine and their
   presence was observed in 4 cetaceans and 2 sea turtles. Despite a clear
   relation between diatoms' presence and amount and the likely cause of
   death was not proved due to the poor number of samples, the higher
   burden of diatoms was found in 3 animals deemed to be death for the
   interaction with human activity. Despite more studied are necessary to
   identify the possible relation between the cause of death and diatoms'
   findings, the present study implemented this technique to be adapted to
   marine animals, confirming its possible application also in veterinary
   forensic medicine. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Neuron glial antigen 2 (NG2) is a chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan 4
   (CSPG4) that occurs in developing and adult central nervous systems
   (CNSs) as a marker of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) together
   with platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR beta). It
   behaves variably in different pathological conditions, and is possibly
   involved in the origin and progression of human gliomas. In the latter,
   NG2/CSPG4 induces cell proliferation and migration, is highly expressed
   in pericytes, and plays a role in neoangiogenesis. NG2/CSPG4 expression
   has been demonstrated in oligodendrogliomas, astrocytomas, and
   glioblastomas (GB), and it correlates with malignancy. In rat tumors
   transplacentally induced by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU), NG2/CSPG4
   expression correlates with PDGFR alpha, Olig2, Sox10, and Nkx2.2, and
   with new vessel formation. In this review, we attempt to summarize the
   normal and pathogenic functions of NG2/CSPG4, as well as its potential
   as a therapeutic target.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of short
   purification cycles on the safety of naturally contaminated Mytilus
   galloprovincialis from harvesting areas of the Gulf of Olbia (Sardinia,
   Italy). Samples from ten batches of mussels were collected before,
   during and after purification treatment at two purification centres
   (A-B). All the samples were analysed for Escherichia coli and Salmonella
   spp according to Council Regulation (EC) 2285/2015. Detection and
   enumeration of Vibrio spp were performed according to previously
   published methods. Presumptive identification of Vibrio spp isolates
   were performed by means of conventional biochemical tests and polymerase
   chain reaction. The presence of Hepatitis A virus was detected by nested
   reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Environmental
   parameters (water temperature and salinity) were also recorded. The
   results of Escherichia coli counts showed the overall efficacy of the
   short purification cycles; a purification cycle of 8 h led to a rapid
   decline in the concentration. The decrease in Escherichia coli counts
   does not correlate with the presence of naturally occurring vibrios, the
   decline of which occurs at an even slower rate. The average
   contamination levels for Vibrio spp before purification were 8.20 +/-
   0.47 and 7.99 +/- 0.62 Log(10) CFU/g in samples collected at
   purification plants A and B, respectively. After purification, the
   average contamination levels were 8.10 +/- 0.60 Log(10 )CFU/g at
   purification plant A and 7.85 +/- 0.57 Log(10) CFU/g at purification
   plant B. The contaminated samples revealed the presence of Vibrio
   alginolyticus (n=21), Vibrio fluvialis (n=12), Vibrio cholerae (n=4),
   Vibrio parahaemolyticus (n=2) and Vibrio vulnificus (n=1). The Vibrio
   parahaemolyticus isolates carried the tdh or the trh genes. None of the
   isolates was tdh+/trh+. Salmonella spp and Hepatitis A virus were not
   detected. The adoption of short purification cycles for Mytilus
   galloprovincialis in the presence of pathogenic vibrios might not be
   sufficient to guarantee the safety of consumers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {FOOD MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {74},
Pages = {120-124},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {AiV-1 is considered an emerging human enteric pathogens and foodborne
   transmission has been documented as an important source of exposure for
   humans, chiefly in relation to non-safe, risky food habits. We surveyed
   the presence of AiV-1 in retail shellfish, including oysters and
   mussles, identifying the virus in 3/170 (1.8\%) of the analysed samples.
   The AiV-1 positive samples were of different geographic origin. Upon
   sequence analysis of a portion of the 3CD junction region, two AiV
   strains identified from harvesting areas in Northern Italy were
   characterised as genotype B and displayed 99-100\% identity at the
   nucleotide level to other AiV-1 strains detected in sewages in Central
   Italy in 2012, suggesting that such strains are stably circulating in
   Italian ecosystems. Interestingly, a strain identified from mussles
   harvested in Southern Italy could not be characterised firmly, as
   inferred in the Bayesian analysis and by sequence comparison, indicating
   that different AiV strains are also circulating in Italy. Viral
   contamination in retail shellfish challenges the microbiological
   guidelines for food control and requires the development and
   optimization of additional diagnostic and prevention strategies. (C)

   characteristics of typical Sicilian stretched raw milk PDO (Protected

   packaging applied did not affect the microbiological profiles of the
   cheeses. Of the chemical and physical parameters, only pH and water
   activity (a(w)) were statistically different among the trials. In
   particular, the cheeses wrapped in paraffin showed the highest pH value
   while those packaged using MAP showed the highest aw. The vacuum-packed
   VdB cheeses were characterised by the highest lightness (L{*}) value.
   The cheeses covered with paraffin reached the lowest scores at sensory
   evaluation, probably because they were characterised by the highest
   concentrations of the free fatty acids responsible for bitter flavours.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Samples of non-irradiated walnuts exhibit a single line with a g value
   of 2.0045 +/- 0.0006. The irradiation process gives rise to
   ``cellulose-like{''} Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) spectrum two lines
   symmetrical to the central line, at a distance of ca. 3 mT. Irradiation
   increases the central line and produces two satellite peaks (lines) with
   an amplitude growing with dose. The stability of the radiation-induced
   ESR signal at room temperature was studied from a quantitative point of
   view. The fading study and dose evaluation were pursued for a period of
   two years analyzing irradiated walnuts samples.
   The reported curves, describing the fading at different doses, differ
   only by a multiplicative factor and the attenuation factor (the ratio
   between the amplitude measured and the amplitude evaluated after
   irradiation) depends only on the time elapsed following treatment.},

Abstract = {Edible insects are expected to become an important nutrient source for
   animals and humans in the Western world in the near future. However,
   before insects can be put on the market, the safety of their use for
   feed and food is warranted. This literature study was prepared to
   provide an overview of the actual knowledge of possible food safety
   hazards, including chemical, microbiological, and allergenic agents and
   prions, to human and animal health upon the use of insects for food and
   feed, and to highlight data gaps and suggest the way forward. From the
   data available, heavy metals of concern are cadmium in black soldier fly
   and arsenic in yellow mealworm larvae. Investigated mycotoxins do not
   seem to accumulate. Residues of pesticides, veterinary drugs, and
   hormones, as well as dioxins and PCBs, are sometimes found in insects.
   Contamination of insects with pathogens to human health is a consequence
   of a combination of the substrates used and the farming and processing
   steps applied. Insects harbor a wide variety of microorganisms, and some
   human pathogenic bacteria may be present. In addition, insects may
   harbor and transmit parasites. There is no evidence so far insects may
   harbor pathogenic viruses or prions, but they may act as vectors.
   Insects and insect-derived products may have allergenic potential. In
   this review, evidence on some safety aspects is displayed, and data gaps
   are identified. Recommendations are given for future research to fill
   the most relevant data gaps.},

Abstract = {Canine babesiosis is caused by haemoprotozoan organisms of the genus
   Babesia which are transmitted by the bite of a hard tick. The aim of
   this survey was to determine the prevalence and risk factors associated
   with Babesia species infections in hunting dogs from Southern Italy.
   Blood samples were collected from 1311 healthy dogs in the Napoli,
   Avellino and Salerno provinces of the Campania region of Southern Italy.
   Serological testing was performed using two enzyme-linked immunosorbent
   assays (ELISA), with one designed to detect B. canis and B. vogeli
   antibodies, and the other designed to detect B. gibsoni antibodies.
   Blood samples were also tested by quantitative real-time polymerase
   chain reaction (qPCR) assays for amplification of B. canis, B. vogeli
   and B. gibsoni DNA. The overall seroprevalence for B. canis/B. vogeli
   was 14.0\%, compared to 0.2\% for B. gibsoni. B. canis and B. vogeli PCR
   positive rates were 0.15\% and 1.1\%, respectively. B. gibsoni DNA was
   not amplified by qPCR. Male gender (OR 1.85), increased age (OR 1.01),
   long hair coat (OR 1.61) and living in Salerno province (OR 1.71)
   represented risk factors for B. canis/B. vogeli seroreactivity. Hunting
   dogs in Southern Italy are often exposed to B. canis/B. vogeli, however
   Babesia spp. infection was infrequently detected using qPCR. Further
   studies are needed to determine the extent to which Babesia spp. cause
   clinical disease in hunting dogs, and to evaluate the potential
   epidemiological relationships between hunting dogs and wild animal
   populations sharing the same area.},

Abstract = {Introduction: West Nile virus (WNV) immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies
   have been shown to persist for up to 500 days in certain patients. To
   evaluate the usefulness of immunoglobulin G (IgG) avidity assessment in
   the diagnosis of WNV infection, we analyzed 54 WNV IgM-and/or
   IgG-positive serum samples from 39 patients with neuroinvasive disease
   and 15 asymptomatic cases tested during a seroprevalence investigation.
   Methods: Serological tests (WNV IgM/IgG antibody detection, IgG avidity)
   were performed using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent
   assays. Results: WNV IgM antibodies were detected in 47 (87\%) samples.
   Acute/recent WNV infection was confirmed based on low/borderline avidity
   index (AI) in 44 IgM-positive samples (93.6\%). In three IgM-positive
   samples (6.4\%), high IgG AIs were detected, thus indicating persisting
   IgM antibodies from previous infections. All IgM-negative samples showed
   high AIs. Patients with WNV neuroinvasive disease tested within 30 days
   showed low AIs. In six patients tested 34-50 days after disease onset,
   AI was borderline (42\%-60\%), suggesting earlier WNV IgG maturation.
   Samples with the highest IgM values were associated with the lowest AIs
   (Spearman's rho coefficient -0.767, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our results
   indicate that IgG avidity differentiates current/recent WNV infection
   from persistent IgM seropositivity from the previous WNV transmission
   season both in patients with WNV neuroinvasive disease and in
   asymptomatic persons. A strong negative correlation between IgM antibody
   levels and AI indicates that in cases with very high IgM levels,
   determination of IgG avidity may not be necessary. As many patients
   showed rapid avidity maturation, low IgG avidity is indicative of WNV
   infection within the previous month.},

Abstract = {The substitution and sale of frozen-thawed fish labeled as fresh is a
   widespread, difficult to unmask commercial fraud and a potential risk
   for consumer health. Proteomics could help to identify markers for the
   rapid screening of food samples and the identification of frozen-thawed
   seafood. Using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and
   high-resolution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry
   (LC-MS/MS), we identified biomarkers that are able to discriminate
   between fresh and frozen-thawed tissue samples of curled octopus
   (Eledone cirrhosa). The 2-DE analysis showed a significant reduction in
   two protein spots (molecular weight of 45-50 kDa, isoelectric point of
   6.5-7) identified as transgelin. At shotgun analysis, nine proteins
   resulted modulated and transgelin was confirmed as down-regulated,
   making it a potentially useful marker for differentiating between fresh
   and frozen-thawed fish product samples.
   Biological significance: This work, based on two different proteomics
   approaches, investigated differentially expressed proteins in the
   tentacles of the curled octopus (E. cirrhosa) after freezing-thawing
   processes. We were able to characterize the proteome of the tentacles,
   increasing our knowledge on this species, and a common down-regulated
   protein was identified by 2-DE and shotgun analysis, a calponin-like
   protein called transgelin, suggesting a potential use as a marker to
   distinguish different states of conservation in this species.},

Title = {A G1-lineage H9N2 virus with oviduct tropism causes chronic pathological
   changes in the infundibulum and a long-lasting drop in egg production},
Journal = {VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {49},
Month = {AUG 29},
Abstract = {Since 1997, G1-lineage H9N2 avian influenza viruses have been
   circulating in Asia and later on in the Middle East, and they have been
   associated to mild respiratory disease, drops in egg production and
   moderate mortality in chickens, in particular in the presence of
   concurrent infections. In this study, we investigated the importance of
   the G1-lineage H9N2 A/chicken/Israel/1163/2011 virus as a primary
   pathogen in layers, analyzing its tropism and binding affinity for the
   oviduct tissues, and investigating the long-term impact on egg
   production. Besides causing a mild respiratory infection, the virus
   replicated in the oviduct of 60\% of the hens causing different degrees
   of salpingitis throughout the organ, in particular at the level of the
   infundibulum, where the detection of the virus was associated with
   severe heterophilic infiltrate, and necrosis of the epithelium. Binding
   affinity assays confirmed that the infundibulum was the most receptive
   region of the oviduct. The drop in egg production was at its peek at 2
   weeks post-infection (pi) (60\% decrease) and continued up to 80 days pi
   (35\% decrease). On day 80 pi, non-laying birds showed egg yolk
   peritonitis, and histopathological analyses described profound
   alteration of the infundibulum architecture, duct ectasia and thinning
   of the epithelium, while the rest of the oviduct and ovary appeared
   normal. Our results show that this H9N2 virus is a primary pathogen in
   layer hens, and that its replication in the infundibulum is responsible
   for acute and chronic lesions that limits the effective functionality of
   the oviduct, compromising the commercial life of birds.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},

Month = {AUG 27},
Abstract = {Arthropod vectors are responsible for the transmission of human
   pathogens worldwide. Several arthropod species are bird ectoparasites,
   however, no study to date has characterized their microbiota as a whole.
   We sampled hematophagous ectoparasites that feed on migratory birds and
   performed 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding to characterize their microbial
   community. A total of 194 ectoparasites were collected from 115 avian
   hosts and classified into three groups: a) Hippoboscidae diptera; b)
   ticks; c) other arthropods. Metabarcoding showed that endosymbionts were
   the most abundant genera of the microbial community, including Wolbachia
   for Hippoboscidae diptera, Candidatus Midichloria for ticks, Wolbachia
   and Arsenophonus for the other arthropod group. Genera including
   pathogenic species were: Rickettsia, Borrelia, Coxiella, Francisella,
   Bartonella, Anaplasma. Co-infection with Borrelia-Rickettsia and
   Anaplasma-Rickettsia was also observed. A global overview of the
   microbiota of ectoparasites sampled from migratory birds was obtained
   with the use of 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding. A novel finding is the
   first identification of Rickettsia in the common swift louse fly,
   Crataerina pallida. Given their possible interaction with pathogenic
   viruses and bacteria, the presence of endosymbionts in arthropods merits
   attention. Finally, molecular characterization of genera, including both
   pathogenic and symbiont species, plays a pivotal role in the design of
   targeted molecular diagnostics.},

Title = {High-resolution diffusion pattern of human infections by Salmonella

Abstract = {Salmonella enterica serovar Napoli (serovar Napoli) is an emerging cause
   of human salmonellosis in Northern Italy. No specific reservoirs of
   serovar Napoli have been identified in Italy, so far. However, the
   environment, especially surface waters, has been hypothesized as an
   important source of infection based on the observation that
   genotypically different clusters of serovar Napoli are detected in
   different geographical macro-areas. To further support the hypothesis of
   a spatially-restricted pattern of serovar Napoli diffusion, a spatial
   segregation of serovar Napoli lineages should be observed also at
   smaller geographical scale. However, classical genotyping techniques
   used for Salmonella, such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE),
   did not possess enough discriminatory power to highlight spatial
   clustering of serovar Napoli within the macro-areas. To this purpose, we
   performed phylogeographical analyses based on genome-wide single
   nucleotide polymorphisms to test whether spatio-temporal evolution
   patterns of serovar Napoli in Northern Italy could be recognized with
   high geographical resolution, i.e. at local level. Specifically, we
   analyzed the local spread of the main PFGE clonal group, responsible for
   more than 60\% of human infections in the study area, that did not show
   any geographical differentiation by PFGE within Northern Italy, i.e. the
   macro-area considered in the study. Both discrete and continuous
   phylogeography highlighted the existence of two main
   geographically-restricted clades: a Southern clade corresponding to the
   Po Valley and a Northern clade corresponding to the Pre-Alps area.
   Furthermore, the phylogeographical analyses suggested that the most
   probable site of origin of the clone was in an area of the Po Valley at
   the confluence of the Po and Ticino rivers, one of the most important
   Italian wetlands. These findings provide further support to the
   hypothesis that environmental transmission may play an important role in
   the ecology of serovar Napoli.},

Abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides have received great attention for their potential
   benefits to extend the shelf-life of food products. Innate defense
   regulator peptide-1018 (IDR-1018) represents a promising candidate for
   such applications, due to its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity,
   although food-isolated pathogens have been poorly investigated. Herein,
   we describe the design and the structural-functional characterization of
   a new 1018-derivative peptide named 1018-K6, in which the alanine in
   position 6 was replaced with a lysine. Spectroscopic analysis revealed a
   noticeable switch from beta-sheet to helical conformations of 1018-K6
   respect to IDR-1018, with a faster folding kinetic and increased
   structural stability. Moreover, 1018-K6 evidenced a significant
   antibiofilm/bactericidal efficiency specifically against Listeria
   monocytogenes isolates from food-products and food-processing
   environments, belonging to serotype 4b involved in the majority of
   human-listeriosis cases, with EC50 values two-five-fold lower than those
   measured for IDR-1018. Therefore, a single amino-acid substitution in
   IDR-1018 sequence produced severe changes in peptide conformation and
   antimicrobial performances.},

Abstract = {Colistin-resistance mediated by mobilisable and plasmid-borne mcr genes
   has emerged worldwide, threatening the efficacy of colistin, a last
   resort antibiotic increasingly used for treating human invasive
   infections by multidrug-resistant or extensively drug-resistant

   mcr-1-mediated colistin resistance in four multidrug resistant (MDR) out
   of 324 Salmonella infantis from the Italian antimicrobial resistance
   (AMR) monitoring (2001-2017) in broilers and broiler meat. Two were also
   Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamases (ESBL)-producing isolates.
   Characterization by whole genome sequencing (WGS), located mcr-1.1 on an
   incX4 plasmid. Phylogenetic analysis of these isolates with selected
   Italian S. Infantis previously isolated from animals, meat and human
   clinical cases with unknown epidemiological relationship, demonstrated
   that ESBL-producing, mcr-1-positive isolates belonged to the emerging
   pESI-like-positive-ESBL-producing clone described in Italy in 2015.},

   showing mild or no clinical signs. However, transplacental infection can
   occur and lead to abortion, malformations and stillborn lambs, calves
   and goat kids. During November and December 2014, malformations were
   observed in 11 stillborn calves from two farms in the north-eastern
   region of Namibia. Blood samples were collected from 9 of the 11 cows
   that delivered stillborn and malformed calves. All these animals tested
   negative for Rift Valley fever, bovine viral diarrhoea and infectious
   bovine rhinotracheitis and were serologically positive for bluetongue
   virus, SBV and epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus. Clinical findings
   and serological results suggested that SBV may be circulating in

Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Volume = {13},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 16},
Abstract = {Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) affects economically important livestock
   and is one of the most contagious viral diseases. The most commonly used
   FMD diagnostic assay is a sandwich ELISA. However, the main disadvantage
   of this ELISA is that it requires anti-FMD virus (FMDV)
   serotype-specific antibodies raised in small animals. This problem can
   be, in part, overcome by using anti-FMDV monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) as
   detecting reagents. However, the long-term use of MAbs may be
   problematic and they may need to be replaced. Here we have constructed
   chimeric antibodies (mouse/rabbit D9) and Fabs (fragment
   anti-gen-binding) (mouse/cattle D9) using the Fv (fragment variable)
   regions of a mouse MAb, D9 (MAb D9), which recognises type O FMDV. The
   mouse/rabbit D9 chimeric antibody retained the FMDV serotype-specificity
   of MAb D9 and performed well in a FMDV detection ELISA as well as in
   routine laboratory assays. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis confirmed
   engagement with antigenic site 1 and peptide competition studies
   identified the aspartic acid at residue VP1 147 as a novel component of
   the D9 epitope. This chimeric expression approach is a simple but
   effective way to preserve valuable FMDV antibodies, and has the
   potential for unlimited generation of antibodies and antibody fragments
   in recombinant systems with the concomitant positive impacts on the 3Rs
   (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement) principles.},

Abstract = {We examined 151 European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.) samples from
   farms and fish markets of Sicily (Southern Italy) for Anisakidae larvae
   detection. All the samples were examined by visual inspection and
   modified chloro-peptic digestion. Two nematode larvae were found in the
   viscera of only one European sea bass sample from a farm located in
   Greece (FAO 37.3), giving a total prevalence of infestation of 0.7\%. No
   other parasites were found after chloro-peptic digestion of the samples.
   The larvae were morphologically ascribed, at genus level, to morphotypes
   I and molecularly identified as Anisakis pegreffii. To the best if our
   knowledge, this is the first report on the presence of anisakid
   parasites in farmed European sea bass of Mediterranean Sea. Our findings
   suggest that the risk of exposure to Anisakidae nematodes in farmed
   European sea bass remains very low. However, further data on
   Mediterranean farms are needed to have a detailed risk analysis.},

Abstract = {Limited data exist on the occurrence of the dwarf sperm whale Kogia sima
   in the Mediterranean Sea and its parasite fauna. Here, the occurrence of
   the anisakid species Anisakis physeteris and A. pegreffii in the stomach
   chambers of an adult female dwarf sperm whale, stranded in southern
   Italy, is reported. In addition, the occurrence of Phyllobothrium
   delphini larvae infecting the blubber of the caudal peduncle region was
   recorded. A. physeteris and A. pegreffii represent the 2 parasite
   species of the genus, mostly distributed in the Mediterranean Sea in
   fish and squids. The finding of A. pegreffii and A. physeteris in the
   dwarf sperm whale represents a new record in this host species for the
   Mediterranean Sea. The study of gastrointestinal content also revealed a
   massive presence of cephalopod beaks identified as belonging to pelagic
   squids including the umbrella squid Histioteuthis bonnellii, the reverse
   jewel squid H. reversa, the long-armed squid Chiroteuthis veranii, and
   the comb-finned squid Ctenopteryx sicula. The feeding habits of the
   dwarf sperm whale, as well as the occurrence of these squid residuals in
   the cetacean host, suggest that these squid species play a major role in
   maintaining the life cycle of anisakid parasite species and P. delphini.},

Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Month = {AUG 7},
Abstract = {It has been estimated that 44,000 Caretta caretta turtles die every year
   due to anthropomorphic activity in the Mediterranean Sea, and that
   longline fishing is one of the most significant causes of mortality. A
   total of 482 specimens of C. caretta were rescued from different parts
   of the Sicilian coast (Mediterranean Sea) from 2014 to 2016. The most
   numerous stranding was recorded during the spring and summer seasons,
   mainly along the north and eastern coasts of Sicily. The curved carapace
   length for all the specimens ranged from between 19 and 95 cm and most
   of these were young or sub adults. The highest number of strandings was
   recorded in 2014 and 2015, with 206 and 169 individuals, respectively. A
   total of 66 live specimens out of 239 were successfully rehabilitated
   and released after surgery or drug therapy; fishing hooks were found in
   129 specimens in different parts of the digestive tract with greater
   frequency in the oesophagus (47.3\%) followed by the gut (24.8\%),
   stomach (14.7\%), and mouth (13.2\%). This paper will highlight the
   incidence of the incidental catch by longline fishing of C. caretta
   along the Sicilian coasts and also relate the size of ingested hooks to
   the size of examined specimens.},

Title = {Innovative multi-protectoral approach increases survival rate after
   vitrification of ovarian tissue and isolated follicles with improved
   results in comparison with conventional method},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OVARIAN RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Month = {AUG 7},
Abstract = {Background: In recent years, autotransplantation of cryopreserved
   ovarian tissue became a promising approach to preserve female fertility.
   The slow freezing is the most effective technique which resulted in
   greater live birth incidence so far. Despite that, interest to
   vitrification of the ovarian tissue is swiftly growing, thereby
   undermining the necessity for further improvements in the technique. In
   present study, we evaluated possibilities to increase follicle survival
   rates adopting innovative multi-protectoral vitrification protocols,
   applied to the slivers of ovarian cortex or isolated early-antral
   follicles, frozen individually. These experimental protocols have been
   compared with with validated vitrification and slow freezing ones,
   clinically used for female fertility preservation.
   Results: The results showed that third tested variation of experimental
   vitrification protocol, with four cryoprotectants in relatively low
   concentrations and applied to pieces of ovarian tissue at 0 degrees C
   during equilibration, increased survival rate of ovine ovarian tissue
   and improved results in comparison with conventional vitrification
   method. This variation of experimental protocol showed significant
   increase in percentage of follicles with good morphology (69,3\%) in
   comparison with only commercially available vitrification protocol for
   ovarian tissue (62,1\%). Morphology results were confirmed by TUNEL
   assay. Analysis of estradiol and progesterone production by cultured
   individual follicles after freezing/thawing revealed that steroids
   secretion remained significantly higher after multi-protectoral
   vitrification and slow freezing protocol, when follicles after standard
   vitrification protocol demonstrated decline in steroidogenic activity.
   Conclusions: The multi-protectoral approach represents a workable
   solution to improve vitrification outcome on ovarian tissue and isolated
   follicles. The reduction of individual cryoprotectants concentrations,
   while maintaining their sufficient cumulative level in the final
   freezing solution, helps to increase efficiency of the procedure.
   Moreover, equilibration with lower temperatures helped to decrease even
   further the toxic effects of cryoprotectants and preserve original
   quality of ovarian tissue. Therefore, multi-protectoral vitrification
   can be suggested as an improved method for the clinical cryopreservation
   of ovarian tissue.},

Abstract = {Acute-phase proteins and trace elements are considered biomarkers of the
   immune response to infection, inflammation, trauma and other
   pathological conditions, as well as indicators of the health status and
   productivity of farm animals. Given the scarcity of published data on
   this topic, the purpose of this study was to determine the serum levels
   of serum amyloid A (SAA) and haptoglobin, as well as lysozyme, iron and
   zinc in clinically healthy Lacaune sheep in lactation months 3-7 ranging
   in age from 2 to 6 years. The mean serum levels for SAA (12.2 mu g/mL),
   lysozyme (1.47 mu g/mL), zinc (78.9 mu g/dL) and iron (26.6 mmol/L)
   differed from those found in other sheep breeds and indicate
   considerable variations depending on breed, age and physiological status
   of the sheep. Reference values for clinically healthy mid-lactating
   Lacaune sheep were determined by using well-described and modern
   analytical and statistical methods. The reference intervals may be used
   to determine the health and welfare of lactating Lacaune sheep and may
   serve as a starting point to investigate diseases.},

Title = {Microbial dynamics of model Fabriano-like fermented sausages as affected
   by starter cultures, nitrates and nitrites},

Abstract = {The present study promotes the valorization of Fabriano-like fermented
   sausages, which are central-Italy salami with an origin that dates to
   the early 17th century, for the possible future selection of
   autochthonous starter cultures to be used with respect to local
   traditions. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study represents
   the first attempt to define the microbial dynamics in Fabriano-like
   fermented sausage and the effect of nitrates/nitrites and starter
   cultures on its natural bacterial biota. Culture and RNA-based
   techniques (RT-PCR-DGGE and Illumina sequencing) were used to assess the
   microbial ecology of model Fabriano-like fermented sausages together
   with the impact of starter cultures and different nitrate and nitrite
   concentrations. The meat batter was used to produce two batches of
   fermented sausages that were prepared as follows: i) without commercial
   starters or ii) with the use of starter cultures composed of Pediococcus
   pentosaceus and Staphylococcus xylosus. Each batch was further divided
   into three different batches with the addition of 0/0 mg kg(-1)
   nitrate/nitrite, 75/60 mg kg(-1) nitrate/nitrite and 150/125 mg kg(-1)
   nitrate/nitrite to the first, second and third batch, respectively. The
   samples, which were produced in triplicate, were analyzed on the day of
   production and after 7, 21, and 42 days of ripening. Enterobacteriaceae
   counts were always higher in model Fabriano-like sausages produced
   without the use of starter cultures at all of the sampling times
   irrespective of the tested nitrate/nitrite concentrations. Lactobacilli
   counts were positively influenced by the starters, although this
   influence was not evident over time; moreover, the effect of nitrates
   and nitrites on the counts of lactobacilli differed over time. As a
   general trend, coagulase-negative cocci counts were apparently not
   influenced by the tested nitrate/nitrite concentrations. Regarding the
   effect of nitrates/nitrites on the microbial diversity revealed by
   RT-PCR-DGGE, the higher the concentration, the lower the presence of
   some genera/species such as Pseudomonas spp., Serratia liquefaciens and
   Staphylococcus spp. However, Illumina sequencing detected Pseudomonas
   spp. as a minority species after 7, 21 and 42 days of ripening
   irrespective of the nitrate/nitrite concentration. The presence of
   Staphylococcus species was highlighted by both RT-PCR-DGGE and Illumina
   sequencing at all of the stages of ripening, although its presence was
   massively detected in fermented sausages produced without the use of
   nitrates/nitrites at the end of ripening. Overall, the data collected
   clearly highlighted the dominance of Lactobacillus sakei in all of the
   fermented sausages during ripening (from day 7 to day 42) and
   irrespective of the nitrate/nitrite concentration and added starter
   cultures. Moreover, Pediococcus spp. was principally detected in model
   Fabriano-like fermented sausage with added starter cultures irrespective
   of the nitrate/nitrite concentration.},

Title = {Dietary supplementation with olive mill wastewaters induces
   modifications on chicken jejunum epithelial cell transcriptome and
   modulates jejunum morphology},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {19},
Month = {AUG 2},
Abstract = {Background: The Mediterranean diet is considered one of the healthier
   food habits and olive oil is one of its key components. Olive oil
   polyphenols are known to induce beneficial effects in several
   pathological conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, and to
   contrast the proliferation of cancer cells or hypercholesterolemia.
   Polyphenols are also present in waste products derived from the olive
   industry: olive mill wastewaters (OMWW) are rich in polyphenols and
   there is an increasing interest in using OMWW in animal nutrition. OMWW
   are attributed with positive effects in promoting chicken performance
   and the quality of food-derived products. However, a tissue-specific
   transcriptome target analysis of chickens fed with OMWW has never been
   attempted.
   Results: We explored the effect of dietary OMWW on the intestinal
   function in broilers. A morphological analysis of the jejunum revealed
   that OMWW reduced crypt depth, whereas no significant modifications were
   observed for villus height and the villus height/crypt depth ratio. An
   RNA Sequencing analysis was performed on isolated, intestinal,
   epithelial cells and 280 differentially expressed genes were found using
   a count-based approach. An enrichment analysis revealed that the
   majority of up regulated genes in the OMWW group were over-represented
   by the regulation of viral genome replication-related GO-Terms, whereas
   down regulated genes were mainly involved in cholesterol and lipid
   metabolism.
   Conclusions: Our study showed how an industrial waste product can be
   recycled as a feed additive with a positive relapse. OMWW dietary
   supplementation can be a nutritional strategy to improve chicken
   performance and health, prevent intestinal damage, enhance innate
   immunity and regulate cholesterol metabolism and fat deposition.},

Abstract = {This study showed the results of a monitoring program aimed at detecting
   the fraudulent use of horse meat in samples collected in the framework
   of official controls during the years 2013-2017 after the so-called
   horse meat scandal that caused a decreasing consumer confidence in the
   food industry, particularly in meat products. A total of 125 samples
   diversely distributed in the 5years of monitoring were analyzed by
   liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The method
   was validated according to Commission Decision 657/2002/EC with regard
   to the following parameters: linearity, specificity, decision limit
   (CC), detection capability (CC), recovery, and precision (repeatability
   and within-laboratory reproducibility). Even if the results of this
   study revealed no positive sample, the need for constant assurance of
   food safety and consumers' health protection requires the implementation
   of preventive as well as corrective actions in the management of risks
   linked to the food chain in a more global context.},

Abstract = {Samples obtained from 11 teleost fish species collected in waters off of
   the Mediterranean coasts of Sicily, Italy, were examined for the
   presence of Hysterothylacium spp. larvae. In total, 3,017 fish samples
   were examined, and the larvae recovered were used in subsequent
   phylogenetic studies. Fifty-eight raphidascaridid parasitic nematodes
   were found in the examined fish, with prevalence values ranging from
   0.2\% in anchovies to 60\% in forkbeard samples. Twenty-seven parasites
   were identified as Hysterothylacium fabri and Hysterothylacium aduncum
   by sequencing the following regions: the nuclear ribosomal internal
   transcribed spacer (ITS) and the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase
   subunit II (COXII). Two other larvae collected from Lophius piscatorius
   had very low identity scores, with ITS and COXII sequences reported in
   GenBank and high genetic distances (AY603539). Pairwise comparisons
   between the ITS region of the H. fabri isolated from fishes from
   Sicilian coastal waters and those isolated from the Mediterranean Sea,
   Turkey (KC852206), revealed genetic differences ranging from 0.015 to
   0.018. Our H. aduncum samples had very low genetic differences to H.
   aduncum from the Adriatic Sea (KP979763, 0.00-0.003). The concatenated
   phylogenetic examination of the ITS-COXII sequences by using maximum
   likelihood analyses indicated 3 distinct clades supported by high
   bootstrap values. Further molecular identification and detailed
   morphological analyses are needed to clarify these results and confirm
   the diversity and relationships within Hysterothylacium.},

Abstract = {Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a zoonotic pathogen with consumption of pork
   and derived products identified in different countries as a risk factor
   for human exposure to HEV. Great efforts have been made to understand
   the dynamics of virus transmission within domestic swine populations
   through modelling. However, from a food safety prospective, it is
   critical to integrate the parameters involved in the transmission
   dynamics with those governing the actual presence of HEV in the
   bloodstream, the liver, gallbladder or faeces. To date, several aspects
   related to the pathogenesis of the disease are still unknown or
   characterized by significant levels of uncertainty, making this
   conjunction challenging. We used published serological data obtained
   from pigs in a farrow-to-finish farm to implement an
   Immune-Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (MSIR) model reproducing the
   on-farm dynamics that lead to the occurrence of viraemic pigs at
   slaughter. Expert opinion on the length of time infectious HEV can be
   detected in liver, gallbladder/bile and faeces after recovery from
   viraemic status were used to inform a stochastic model aimed at
   estimating the expected proportion of viraemic pigs, pigs with
   infectious HEV in liver, gallbladder/bile and faeces entering the
   slaughterhouse. To simulate the potential effect of on-farm mitigation
   strategies, we estimated the changes in outcomes of interest as a
   function of variations in the baseline transmission parameters. The
   model predicted a proportion of viraemic pigs entering the
   slaughterhouse of 13.8\% while the proportions of, and ranged from
   13.8\% to 94.4\%, 13.8\% to 94.7\% and from 25.3\% to 30.8\%
   respectively, due to the uncertainty surrounding the experts' opinions.
   Variations in MSIR model's parameters alert of the need to carefully
   consider the application of mitigation strategies aimed at delaying the
   decay of maternal immunity or the peak of the within herd transmission.
   When the rate of decay of maternal immunity and the transmission rate
   were decreased between 80\% and 5\% and 40\% and 5\% from the baseline
   values respectively, adverse effects on were observed. The model
   highlights the relevance of specific aspects in the pathogenesis of the
   disease from a food safety prospective and it was developed to be easily
   reproducible and updatable as soon as accurate data becomes available.
   As presented, the model can be directly connected to existing or future
   pig-related models to estimate the significance of the identified
   parameters on the risk of human exposure to HEV through consumption of
   pork products.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to develop a real-time RT-PCR to detect and
   quantitate feline morbillivirus (FeMV) RNA in biological samples.
   Primers and probe were targeted on a conserved region of FeMV P/V/C
   gene. To validate the assay with field samples, a total number of
   specimens of cats have been recruited including 264 urine and blood
   samples and compared with a generic RT-PCR targeting the L protein
   encoding gene of morbilliviruses. In addition, 385 tissue samples from
   35 carcasses of cats have been also employed. RNA titres were low in all
   tested samples. Results also indicated the absence of cross-reaction
   with related morbilliviruses and existing pathogens of cats. In tissues
   with low levels of FeMV RNA, the presence of viral antigen was also
   evidenced by immunohistochemistry targeting the N viral protein. This
   newly described assay allows for a rapid, accurate and reliable
   quantitative detection of FeMV RNA that can be applied for diagnostics
   and research studies.},

Abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is a rising threat for human health. Although in
   clinical settings and terrestrial environments the rise of antibiotic
   resistant bacteria is well documented, their dissemination and spread in
   the marine environment, covering almost two-thirds of the Earth's
   surface, is still poorly understood. In this study, the presence and
   abundance of sulphonamide resistance gene (sul2) and class 1
   integron-integrase gene (intI1), used as markers for the occurrence and
   spread of antibiotic resistance genes since the beginning of the
   antibiotic era, were investigated. Twenty-nine archived formalin-fixed
   samples, collected by the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey in
   the Atlantic Ocean and North Sea from 1970 to 2011, were analysed using
   Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) applied for the first time on CPR samples.
   The two marker genes were present in a large fraction of the samples
   (48\% for sul2 and 76\% for intI1). In contrast, results from Real-Time
   PCR performed on the same samples greatly underestimate their occurrence
   (21\% for sul2 and 52\% for intI1). Overall, besides providing
   successful use of ddPCR for the molecular analysis of CPR samples, this
   study reveals long-term occurrence and spread of sul2 gene and class 1
   integrons in the plankton-associated bacterial communities in the ocean.},

Abstract = {During oestrus, fattening female pigs are more prone to lameness,
   fractures and wounds due to mounting and agonistic behaviours of
   penmates. This study assessed the effect of sexual maturity on the
   behaviour and welfare of heavy female pigs slaughtered at 36 weeks of
   age (180 +/- 10 kg) for dry-cured ham production. An immunocastrated
   control group was used for comparison. In all, 56 15-week-old female
   pigs, individually identifiable by back tattoos were equally distributed
   among four pens. All animals from two pens were subject to a three-dose
   immunocastration schedule at 16, 20 and 32 weeks of age. Skin lesions
   and behaviours were assessed at 18, 23, 28, 33 and 36 weeks of age. A
   blood sample was collected at 20, 24, 28 and 32 weeks of age for
   assessing health/stress parameters and GnRH antibodies. At slaughter,
   ovaries were weighed, measured and histologically examined; stomachs,
   carcasses and lungs were scored for lesions and a further blood sample
   was taken. Immunocastrated pigs did not significantly differ from
   controls in growth rate, feed efficiency and slaughter performances
   (lung score, gastric score, backfat thickness). However, they showed a
   lower frequency of aggressive interactions at 33 and 36 weeks, lower
   front lesions at 28 weeks, but higher at 30 weeks; a lower haptoglobin
   level at 28 weeks, a lower level of cortisol and back lesions at
   slaughter (36 weeks). These findings suggest a low, yet not negligible,
   impact of sexual maturity on the welfare of heavy female pigs.},

Abstract = {Drinking water for poultry is not subject to particular microbiological,
   chemical and physical requirements, thereby representing a potential
   transmission route for pathogenic microorganisms and contaminants and/or
   becoming unsuitable for watera-dministered medications. This study
   assessed the microbiological, chemical and physical drinking water
   quality of 28 turkey farms in North-Eastern Italy: 14 supplied with tap
   water (TW) and 14 with well water (WW). Water salinity, hardness, pH,
   ammonia, sulphate, phosphate, nitrate, chromium, copper and iron levels
   were also assessed. Moreover, total bacterial count at 22'C, presence
   and enumeration of Enterococcus spp. and E. coli, presence of Salmonella
   spp. and Campylobacter spp. were quantified. A water sample was
   collected in winter and in summer at 3 sampling sites: the water source
   (A), the beginning (B) and the end (C) of the nipple line (168 samples
   in total). Chemical and physical quality of both TW and WW sources was
   mostly within the limits of TW for humans. However, high levels of
   hardness and iron were evidenced in both sources. In WW vs. TW, sulphate
   and salinity levels were significantly higher, whilst pH and nitrate
   levels were significantly lower. At site A, microbiological quality of
   WW and TW was mostly within the limit of TW for humans. However, both
   sources had a significantly lower microbiological quality at sites B and
   C. Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype Kentucky was isolated
   only twice from WW. Campylobacter spp. were rarely isolated (3.6\% of
   farms); however, Campylobacter spp. farm-level prevalence by real-time
   PCR was up to 43\% for both water sources. Winter posed at higher risk
   than summer for Campylobacter spp. presence in water, whereas no
   significant associations were found with water source, site,
   recirculation system, and turkey age. Low salinity and high hardness
   were significant risk factors for C. coli and C. jejuni presence,
   respectively. These results show the need of improving sanitization of
   drinking water pipelines for commercial turkeys.},

Abstract = {The aim of this work was to demonstrate that employing a copolymer of
   hyaluronic acid and alpha-elastin (HA-EDA-g-alpha-elastin) is possible
   to produce a scaffold able to support the adhesion and growth of human
   vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) thanks to its ability to incorporate
   and control the diffusion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
   HA-EDA-g-alpha-elastin was crosslinked with low molecular weight
   hyaluronic acid (HA(LMW)) to obtain a hydrogel that gives rise to the
   formation of three dimensional sponge after the freeze drying process.
   The physicochemical features the obtained material along with its
   ability to act as a support for the three dimensional culture of
   endothelial cells were here investigated.
   The obtained hydrogel is able to seize the VEGF and control its release
   in the first days of incubation. The presence of the growth factor
   stimulates the proliferation of HUVEC and induces the formation of
   tubular structures.},

Abstract = {Wild dabbling ducks are the main reservoir for avian influenza (AI)
   viruses and pose an ongoing threat to commercial poultry flocks.
   Combining the (i) size of that population, (ii) their flight distances
   and (iii) their AI prevalence, the density of AI-infected dabbling ducks
   (DID) was calculated as a risk factor for the introduction of AI viruses
   into poultry holdings of Emilia-Romagna region, Northern Italy. Data on
   747 poultry holdings and on 39 AI primary outbreaks notified in
   Emilia-Romagna between 2000 and 2017 were used to validate that risk
   factor. A multivariable Bayesian logistic regression was performed to
   assess whether DID could be associated with the occurrence of AI primary
   outbreaks. DID value, being an outdoor flock, hobby poultry trading,
   species reared, length of cycle and flock size were used as explanatory
   variables. Being an outdoor poultry flock was significantly associated
   with a higher risk of AI outbreak occurrence. The probability of DID to
   be a risk factor for AI virus introduction was estimated to be 90\%. A
   DID cut-off of 0.23 was identified to define high-risk areas for AI
   virus introduction. Using this value, the high-risk area covers 43\% of
   the region. Seventy-four per cent of the primary AI outbreaks have
   occurred in that area, containing 39\% of the regional poultry holdings.
   Poultry holdings located in areas with a high DID value should be
   included in a risk-based surveillance programme aimed at AI early
   detection.},

Abstract = {The long-term shedding of Canine alphaherpesvirus 1 (CaHV-1) by neonatal
   pups with natural infection is reported. The pups belonged to a litter
   of 11 pointers of a breeding kennel in southern Italy, 9 of which
   developed a fatal form of systemic infection, as resulted by the
   detection of CaHV-1 in internal organs (kidney, liver, lung and brain)
   of one of this dogs and in the vaginal swab of their mother. The two
   remaining animals displayed a milder form of disease, with one pup
   showing ocular involvement, and underwent a progressive recovery. These
   pups were monitored from 11 to 36 days of age, showing a long-term
   shedding of the virus through the nasal and ocular secretions and the
   faeces. CaHV-1 shedding, as assessed by means of a specific and
   sensitive real-time PCR assay, occurred mainly through the nasal
   secretions, although the pup displaying ocular disease shed the virus at
   high titres and for a long period even in the ocular secretions.},

Abstract = {In this study, a new and alternative method based on monoclonal
   antibodies (MAbs) for the rapid detection of Yersinia enterocolitica O:8
   was developed. This microorganism is an emerging foodborne pathogen
   causing gastrointestinal disease in humans. The transmission can occur
   through contaminated food such as raw or undercooked meat, milk and
   dairy products, water and fresh vegetables. Nine MAbs (46F7, 54B11,
   54C11, 62D10, 64C7, 64C10, 72E8, 72E10, 72G6) were characterized and
   selected versus Y. enterocolitica O:8, and only 2 of them showed also a
   weak cross-reaction with Campylobacter jejuni. The MAb 54B11 was used
   for the development of Y. enterocolitica capture-ELISA in food matrices,
   i.e. meat and dairy products (n = 132). The method was validated by ISO
   16140:2003 and compared with the official method for the detection of
   presumptive pathogenic Y. enterocolitica (ISO 10273:2003). Relative
   accuracy, sensitivity and specificity corresponded to 100\%. The
   selectivity was evaluated on other food samples (n = 126) showing a
   lower confidence limit of 90.3\% and an upper confidence limit of 100\%.
   The results from this study demonstrated that the developed method was
   rapid and cheap, specific and sensitive for the screening of the
   pathogen in food. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Abstract = {Mass strandings of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) are rare in the
   Mediterranean Sea. Nevertheless, in 2014 a pod of 7 specimens stranded
   alive along the Italian coast of the Central Adriatic Sea: 3 individuals
   died on the beach after a few hours due to internal damages induced by
   prolonged recumbency; the remaining 4 whales were refloated after great
   efforts. All the dead animals were genetically related females; one was
   pregnant. All the animals were infected by dolphin morbillivirus (DMV)
   and the pregnant whale was also affected by a severe nephropathy due to
   a large kidney stone. Other analyses ruled out other possible relevant
   factors related to weather conditions or human activities. The results
   of multidisciplinary post-mortem analyses revealed that the 7 sperm
   whales entered the Adriatic Sea encountering adverse weather conditions
   and then kept heading northward following the pregnant but sick leader
   of the pod, thereby reaching the stranding site. DMV infection most
   likely played a crucial role in impairing the health condition and
   orientation abilities of the whales. They did not steer back towards
   deeper waters, but eventually stranded along the Central Adriatic Sea
   coastline, a real trap for sperm whales.},

Journal = {APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Free-roaming dogs (FRDs) pose a significant health threat to humans,
   other animals and the environment. Yet, the effects of their movements
   and habitat use within cities and adjacent rural areas are poorly known,
   especially in relation to predation and the transmission of diseases
   that can impact human health (i.e., cystic echinococcosis and rabies).
   We explored the temporal and spatial distribution of owned FRDs for a
   remote Patagonian city surrounded by a grasslands rural ecosystem by
   superimposing GPS coordinates of tracked dogs on satellite images
   (Google map). Using logistic regressions, we evaluated the potential
   effect of age, body condition score (BCS) and distance from their
   initial recorded GPS fix (at or near the owner's home) to the rural
   boundary (RD) as predictors of home range (HR) and maximum distance (MD)
   travelled from home. Our study revealed that owned FRDs in Puerto
   Natales, Chile have a high site fidelity to the urban environment and
   especially their owners home, seldom venturing into rural areas. We
   observed that even FRDs living in close proximity to the city boundary
   spent most of their time within the urban environment. On average, FRDs
   had a HR of 0.65 km(2) (65 ha) and travelled a MD of 1.05 km. There were
   two individuals that travelled significantly further, and hence occupied
   a larger HR than the rest. Additionally, our results indicated that BCS
   was a predictor of HR, while age and RD were predictors of MD. These
   findings add to the range of predictors known to affect roaming dog HR
   size and used across different studies, suggesting that site-specific
   factors are likely affecting dog behavioral ecology. The study findings
   provide useful and original data on the movement ecology and site
   fidelity of owned FRDs in a remote city in Patagonia. We recommend that
   to make meaningful and cost-effective management decisions regarding
   owned FRDs in urban areas, future studies should also include the
   collection of sociocultural information on the interactions between of
   dogs and people.},

Volume = {59},

Abstract = {One hundred and thirty-eight C. difficile isolates from different
   sources (66 from the environment, 36 from animals, 9 from food and 27
   from humans) were ribotyped by capillary electrophoresis PCR ribotyping
   (CE-PCR). A multilocus variable tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) was
   carried out on a sample subset.
   The most frequently isolated PCR ribotypes were 126 (15.9\%), 078
   (14.5\%), 011/018 (11.6\%), 014/020/077 (10.1\%), and 010 (2.8\%). In
   particular, strains of PCR ribotype 011/018 were isolated from human,
   raw milk and environmental samples. The hypervirulent PCR ribotype 027
   was isolated from two human samples.
   The majority of the strains were toxigenic (34.1\% showed the toxigenic
   profile A(+)B(+)CDT(+) and 38.9\% the profile A(+)B(+)CDT(-)). MLVA
   allowed to identify 4 clonal complexes of genetically related isolates:
   complex n. 1 grouped together human, environmental and food strains,
   whereas complex n. 3 included human and environmental isolates. The use
   of MLVA gave further evidence to the possible role of environment,
   animals and food as routes of transmission of C. difficile infections to
   human.},

Abstract = {Thiacloprid is an insecticide belonging to the family of neonicotinoids,
   substances initially underestimated for their potential adverse effects,
   that they may manifest in the long term leading to an extensive use. The
   objective of this study was to evaluate the effect at increasing
   concentrations of thiacloprid on chick embryos development. The research
   was carried out on 75 fertile eggs of Gallus gallus domesticus. The eggs
   were opened after 10, 15 and 20 days of incubation and in treated
   embryos were observed developmental alterations, growth retardation,
   limbs defects and ectopia viscerale. The histological analysis showed
   hepatic steatosis and haemorrhages both in the liver and in the lungs.
   Moreover, the immunohistochemical analysis performed on the liver
   sections showed a strong positivity only for the erythrocytes to the
   anti-CYP1A antibody. Thiacloprid exposure increases the risks of
   teratogenic effects especially at the higher doses tested, therefore its
   use should be more controlled and limited. Since the literature on the
   topic is lacking, then the human health impacts resulting from
   neonicotinoids exposure is not yet fully understood, and, our data will
   be helpful to allow the assessment of an oral reference dose and health
   risk characterization.},

Abstract = {Ruminants' milk contains delta-valerobetaine originating from rumen
   through the transformation of dietary N-epsilon-trimethyllysine. Among
   ruminant's milk, the occurrence of delta-valerobetaine, along with
   carnitine precursors and metabolites, has not been investigated in
   buffalo milk, the second most worldwide consumed milk, well-known for
   its nutritional value. HPLCESI-MS/MS analyses of bulk milk revealed that
   the Italian Mediterranean buffalo milk contains delta-valerobetaine at
   levels higher than those in bovine milk. Importantly, we detected also
   gamma-butyrobetaine, the L-carnitine precursor, never described so far
   in any milk. Of interest, buffalo milk shows higher levels of
   acetylcarnitine, propionylcarnitine, butyrylcarnitine,
   isobutyrylcarnitine, and 3-methylbutyrylcarnitine (isovalerylcarnitine)
   than cow milk. Moreover, buffalo milk shows isobutyrylcarnitine and
   butyrylcarnitine at a 1-to-1 molar ratio, while in cow's milk this ratio
   is 5 to 1. Results indicate a peculiar short-chain acylcarnitine profile
   characterizing buffalo milk, widening the current knowledge about its
   composition and nutritional value.},

Abstract = {The occurrence of trace elements, REE and iAs was investigated in
   macroalgae collected from Giglio Island (Grosseto, Italy), 3 years after
   the Costa Concordia shipwreck recovery operations.
   There was a high variability of metals and REE between species, even
   those belonging to the same phylum. Arsenic level was found within the
   range of the Tuscany marine environment; the inorganic fraction was from
   9\% to 31\%. Al, Be, Pb and Zn levels in seaweeds from Giglio Island
   were found to be significantly higher than in macroalgae from other
   islands of the Tuscany archipelago. REE were double the values found in
   the Tuscan islands of Elba and Capraia. We suggest that concentrations
   of metals and REE were influenced by the 3-year-long naval operations
   carried out for the Costa Concordia shipwreck rescue, and that
   macroalgae could be suitable bioindicators of perturbations in metal
   concentrations in the marine environment. Capsule: Inorganic
   contaminants in seaweeds for Giglio Island.},

Title = {A new procedure for surface contamination of food products using
   absorbent paper},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FOOD SAFETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {38},
Number = {4},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {A new method was developed for artificial contamination of food products
   during challenge test studies, in products where superficial
   contamination is needed. Rinds of Gorgonzola cheese wheels were divided
   into quarters and then squares with 12 cm of side and contaminated with
   absorbent paper soaked with a bacterial suspension of Listeria
   monocytogenes left in contact with the surface of the blue-veined
   cheese, in order to achieve homogenous contamination of the whole
   surface. To verify the performance of the method of contamination, after
   24 hr L. monocytogenes was enumerated to evaluate surface contamination.
   With the method described, an average concentration of about 5
   log(10)cfu/cm(2) or MPN/cm(2) was obtained starting from a contaminated
   suspension of 8 log(10)cfu/ml. The homogeneity of the contamination was
   demonstrated by the application of statistical tests.
   Practical applicationsChallenge tests are carried out to simulate
   contaminations as they happen during the processing and aging of
   cheeses, cured meats or ready-to-eat foods, for cross contamination
   studies, for applications of predictive microbiology, and to evaluate
   potential dragging of bacteria during the cutting of slices. In all
   cases, the inoculum should be applied on the product using the
   appropriate technique, in order to mimic natural contamination. This
   study reports a new method of contamination that allows the achievement
   of homogeneous microbial distribution on the whole flat surface of
   foods, using absorbent paper soaked with a bacterial suspension of
   Listeria monocytogenes. It was tested in the framework of challenge
   tests aimed to quantify the dragging of bacteria from Gorgonzola cheese
   rinds to paste during different processing steps. The procedure could
   be, however, profitably used also in other food products, when uniform
   surface contamination is required.},

Abstract = {Anthrax caused by Bacillus anthracis is an old and neglected zoonosis
   that continues to raise concerns in Southern Africa. In this study,
   twenty (20) slides with suspected isolates of B. anthracis from anthrax
   cases between 1990 and 2014 and two (2) from that of a vaccine strain
   were analysed using MLVA with 15 VNTRs and CanSNPs test. The results
   from the CanSNPs indicate that all anthrax outbreaks in Zambia between
   1990 and 2014 were caused by the lineage A.Br.005/006 of the clade A.
   This indicates a common ancestral origin of the B. anthracis circulating
   in the country. This data has described several environmental, wildlife,
   livestock and human cases that occurred in a 24 year period, from the
   major areas where anthrax is endemic. The molecular characterization of
   isolates from anthrax outbreaks in Zambia has revealed a genetic
   structure in agreement with previous studies from neighbouring
   countries. Further studies are needed to elucidate how to better manage
   anthrax outbreaks and define the risk maps of Zambia.},

Abstract = {For the first time, this study evaluated the use of MALDI-TOF as a
   typing tool for Arcobacter butzleri. A total of 104 A. butzleri strains
   isolated from different sources in an artisanal dairy plant in Italy
   were identified and typed using MALDI-TOF and compared with their
   multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed field gel electrophoresis
   (PFGE) profiles found in previous studies. MALDI-TOF correctly
   identified all the isolates to species level. No clearly delineated
   clusters appeared on dendrograms based on either the complete spectra or
   the significant peaks, but nine clusters were defined using the
   cophenetic correlation. Interestingly, MALDI-TOF proved able to
   discriminate A. butzleri strains below species level, confirming its
   potential use for epidemiological surveys. As expected, the comparative
   analysis with PFGE and MLST showed that the discriminatory index was
   lower for MALDI-TOF but roughly comparable to sequence types and
   pulsotypes. MALDI-TOF appears to be a relatively low cost answer to the
   urgent need for more rapid, less expensive typing tools suitable for
   source attribution studies, readily allowing multiple typing methods to
   be combined. This study provides insights into MALDI-TOF as potential
   epidemiological tool. Its application in healthcare surveillance systems
   awaits further exploration to encourage interaction and convergence
   studies between primary care in humans and animal and food veterinary
   authorities as part of the One Health concept.},

Title = {Biological compatibility between two temperate lineages of brown dog
   ticks, Rhipicephalus sanguineus (sensu lato)},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUL 9},
Abstract = {Background: The brown dog tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus (sensu stricto)
   is reputed to be the most widespread tick of domestic dogs worldwide and
   has also been implicated in the transmission of many pathogens to dogs
   and humans. For more than two centuries, Rh. sanguineus (s.s.) was
   regarded as a single taxon, even considering its poor original
   description and the inexistence of a type specimen. However, genetic and
   crossbreeding experiments have indicated the existence of at least two
   distinct taxa within this name: the so-called temperate and tropical
   lineages of Rh. sanguineus (sensu lato). Recent genetic studies have
   also demonstrated the existence of additional lineages of Rh. sanguineus
   (s.l.) in Europe and Asia. Herein, we assessed the biological
   compatibility between two lineages of Rh. sanguineus (s.l.) found in
   southern Europe, namely Rhipicephalus sp. I (from Italy) and
   Rhipicephalus sp. II (from Portugal).
   Methods: Ticks morphologically identified as Rh. sanguineus (s.l.) were
   collected in southern Portugal and southern Italy. Tick colonies were
   established and crossbreeding experiments conducted. Morphological,
   biological and genetic analyses were conducted.
   Results: Crossbreeding experiments confirmed that ticks from the two
   studied lineages were able to mate and generate fertile hybrids. Hybrid
   adult ticks always presented the same genotype of the mother, confirming
   maternal inheritance of mtDNA. However, larvae and nymphs originated
   from Rhipicephalus sp. I females presented mtDNA genotype of either
   Rhipicephalus sp. I or Rhipicephalus sp. II, suggesting the occurrence
   of paternal inheritance or mitochondrial heteroplasmy. While
   biologically compatible, these lineages are distinct genetically and
   phenotypically.
   Conclusions: The temperate lineages of Rh. sanguineus (s.l.) studied
   herein are biologically compatible and genetic data obtained from both
   pure and hybrid lines indicate the occurrence of paternal inheritance or
   mitochondrial heteroplasmy. This study opens new research avenues and
   raises question regarding the usefulness of genetic data and
   crossbreeding experiments as criteria for the definition of cryptic
   species in ticks.},

Abstract = {The present study aimed to identify the microbiota present in six
   species of processed edible insects produced in Thailand and marketed
   worldwide via the internet, namely, giant water bugs (Belostoma
   lutarium), black ants (Polyrhachis), winged termites (alates,
   Termitoidae), rhino beetles (Hyboschema contractum), mole crickets
   (Gryllotalpidae), and silkworm pupae (Bombyx mori). For each species,
   two samples of boiled, dried and salted insects were purchased. The
   microbial DNA was extracted from the insect samples and subjected to
   polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis
   (PCR-DGGE), high-throughput sequencing and qualitative real-time PCR
   assays. The microbiota of the analyzed samples were widely characterized
   by the presence of spore-forming bacteria mainly represented by the
   genera Bacillus and Clostridium. Moreover, the genera Anaerobacillus,
   Paenibacillus, Geobacillus, Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Massilia,
   Delftia, Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Vagococcus, and
   Vibrio were also detected. Real-time PCR allowed for ascertainment of
   the absence of Coxiella burnetii, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC),
   and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in all samples. The results of this study
   confirm the importance of combining different molecular techniques to
   characterize the biodiversity of complex ecosystems such as edible
   insects. The presence of potential human pathogens suggests the need for
   a careful application of good manufacturing practices during insect
   processing. This study provides further data that will be useful in risk
   analyses of edible insects as a novel food source.},

Title = {Usefulness of indicator bacteria as potential marker of Campylobacter
   contamination in broiler carcasses},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {276},
Pages = {63-70},
Month = {JUL 2},
Abstract = {According to Regulation (EC) No 2017/1495, amending Regulation (EC) No
   2073/2005, a slaughterhouse process hygiene criterion based on a limit
   of 10(3) CFU/g of Campylobacter for no more than 20 (for the years 2018
   and 2019), 15 (for the years 2020-2024) and 10 (starting from 2025) of
   50 neck skin samples of broiler carcasses could be an effective measure
   to reduce the incidence of human campylobacteriosis. In order to
   stimulate the poultry industry to improve the control of Campylobacter
   along the slaughter-line, the quantification of indicator bacteria such
   as Escherichia coli or Enterobacteriaceae could be a useful strategy.
   The aims of this study were: a) to investigate the possible relationship
   between Campylobacter and indicator bacteria counts at two different
   points of the broiler slaughter-line and b) to evaluate the probability
   that carcasses have Campylobacter counts above 10(3) CFU/g in relation
   to indicator bacteria counts. E. coli, Enterobacteriaceae and
   Campylobacter were simultaneously enumerated on neck skin samples of
   broiler carcasses sampled at the post-evisceration (n = 75) and at the
   post-chilling points (n = 75) of three Italian poultry slaughterhouses.
   In general, the log counts of all the investigated microorganisms were
   significantly lower at the post-chilling point, and the indicator
   bacteria (E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae) counts were significantly
   higher than Campylobacter counts at both sampling points. A multilevel
   linear mixed model, relating the Campylobacter log(10) counts with the
   E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae log(10) counts, showed that the
   Campylobacter log(10) counts increased significantly for every
   additional E. coli log(10) count, and this was more evident at the
   post-chilling than at the post-evisceration sampling point. With regards
   to the Enterobacteriaceae, the increase was similar at the two sampling
   points. An additional model, developed to assess the probability that
   carcasses would have Campylobacter counts above 3 log(10) CFU/g, showed
   that this probability increased significantly if the level of E. coli
   count also increased. Carcasses classified as Campylobacter > 3 log(10)
   CFU/g according to the observed results of E. coli >= 4 log(10) CFU/g
   did have high Campylobacter counts. Conversely, it was not possible to
   conclude anything for carcasses with E. coli < 4 log(10) CFU/g. These
   findings support the hypothesis that the monitoring of poultry carcasses
   for E. coli load could be useful to identify those heavily contaminated
   with Campylobacter, in order to implement control measures on the farms
   of origin of such batches, or improving the slaughter process of the
   plants where the heavily contaminated batches are found.},

Abstract = {Little is known about the role of traditional dairy products in
   naturally supplying beneficial microorganisms able to survive in the
   human gastrointestinal tract (GIT). To investigate this aspect, a fresh
   artisanal Pasta Filata cheese was administered daily to 18 healthy
   children, 3-6 years of age, for seven days. Counts and type of lactic
   acid bacteria (LAB) and propionic acid bacteria (PAB) were carried out
   on the cheese and children's faeces before and after cheese consumption.
   In most cases, statistically significant increases of presumptive LAB
   were observed after seven days from suspension compared to values before
   and at the end of consumption.
   Based on repetitive element palindromic PCR (rep-PCR) genotyping, six
   cheese isolates were identical to faecal isolates. Identity was
   confirmed by sequencing regions of clpP and rpoD genes for LAB and pepN
   andproW genes for PAB.
   Among those cheese isolates P. freudenreichii S-1-P, L. pUmtarum S-2-2
   and L helveticus S-2-6 stimulated the production of high interleukin 10
   (IL-10) and low tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) levels by peripheral
   blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Therefore they could exert
   anti-inflammatory effects in vivo.
   Results suggested that traditional dairy products should be more
   efficiently exploited as a natural source of health-promoting
   microorganisms.},

Abstract = {Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a zoonotic infectious disease with a
   severe impact on humans and animals. Infection is transmitted by
   phlebotomine sand flies, and several domestic and wild mammals act as
   reservoirs for the infection, so the prompt detection of infected hosts
   is crucial to preventing and controlling the spread of the disease and
   its transmission to humans. A rapid and portable tool for VL diagnosis
   based on the lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) technology is described
   herein. The device exploits a highly specific chimeric recombinant
   antigen as the recognition element for capturing anti-leishmanial
   antibodies, and protein A labelled with gold nanoparticles as the signal
   reporter. The LFIA shows excellent diagnostic sensitivity (98.4\%),
   specificity (98.9\%), and agreement with serological reference methods
   for diagnosing canine VL. The long-term stability of the LFIA device was
   confirmed based on six months of storage at room temperature or 4 A
   degrees C, and the qualitative response of the device was not affected
   by limited thermal stress. The use of the broadly specific protein A
   means that the LFIA can be readily adapted to diagnose VL in dogs (the
   main reservoir for human infection) and other mammals, thus further
   assisting efforts to control the spread of VL.},

Abstract = {The virulence gene profile of 26 rabbit enteropathogenic Escherichia
   coli strains, isolated from 17 colibacillosis outbreaks located in two
   regions of Northern Italy, was determined using an Echerichia coli
   virulence DNA microarray. All strains were classified according to their
   determined biotype, sero-and phylo-group. The distribution of virulence
   genes encoding for the Locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), LEE type
   III secretion system (T3SS), non-LEE T3SS translocated proteins and
   adherence factors was also determined. All strains but one belonged to
   phylogroups A and B1. A prevalent association between the O103 serogroup
   with the rhamnose-negative phenotype (biotype 12 or 14) was found. The
   most prevalent LEE profile found in tested strains was
   ler/cesT/espA-1/espB-3/tir-1/eae(beta)/espD-2/escN/eprJ. All strains
   possessed either the adhesive factor rabbit-2 (afr/2) or the plasmid
   Rabbit adherence locus (ral) gene and 24 of them an additional
   individual or combined set of colonization factors efa1/lifA, lpfA and
   paa genes. Finally, the combined or single presence of a set of LEE
   and/or non-LEE effector proteins encoding genes, namely espG, cif, map
   and nle family genes, attested to the genetic potential of investigated
   strains to induce pathologic lesions to the host. The application of
   microarray-based technologies in assessing the genetic profile of rabbit
   E. coli is a reliable, cost-effective candidate for large scale
   investigations in monitoring programs aimed to survey the circulation of
   pathogenic strains within rabbit production units, their zoonotic
   genetic potential and to select E. coli strains eligible for vaccinal
   prophylaxis in fattening rabbit production.},

   tolerant to a low pH values, susceptible to antibiotics and can inhibit
   the growth of a wide spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. Both strains are
   good candidates (by using 3\% of the mixture of both strains) for the
   reduction of mycotoxins; these additional properties promote their
   broader application in the food sector. Whey enriched with 2.5\%

Abstract = {This study fully describes a severe disease outbreak occurred in 2016 in
   black bullhead catfish farmed in Italy. Affected fish showed nervous
   clinical signs as well as emaciations and haemorrhagic petechiae on the
   skin at the fin bases, abdomen and gills. Viral isolation in cell
   culture allowed the subsequent identification of a rhabdovirus,
   tentatively named ictalurid rhabdovirus (IcRV), through electron
   microscopy, immunofluorescence and whole genome sequencing (WGS). The
   newly isolated virus, together with 14 additional viral strains stored
   in our repository and detected during similar mortality episodes in the
   period 1993-2016, was phylogenetically analysed on the basis of the
   nucleoprotein and the glycoprotein nucleotide and amino acid sequences.
   The genetic distances among Italian IcRV strains were also estimated.
   Our results show that all the IcRV strains belong to the genus
   Sprivivirus and are closely related to the tench rhabdovirus (TenRV).
   Italian catfish production is constantly decreasing, mainly due to viral
   infections, which include the newly characterized IcRV. Data presented
   in this work will assist to investigate the molecular epidemiology and
   the diffusive dynamics of this virus and to develop adequate
   surveillance activities.},

Abstract = {African swine fever (ASF) virus is a DNA virus responsible for a severe
   haemorrhagic fever in pigs, which (still in the absence of vaccination
   strategies) results in high mortality rates. Herein, we present a
   biosensor-based method for the detection of ASF viral DNA in the blood
   of pigs. The biosensor exploits a single-strand DNA probe with locked
   nucleic acid nucleotides (LNA) substitutions as the complementary
   recognition element for the conserved region of vp72 gene of ASF virus.
   The biosensor was calibrated using qPCR-quantified ASF viral DNA
   extracted from the blood of pigs experimentally infected with the
   virulent Italian isolate 49/08, genotype I. Globally, the proposed
   biosensor showed good sensitivity and specificity, with the limits of
   detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) being 178 and 245 copies/pL of
   genomic ASF viral DNA, respectively. The reversible nature of the
   interaction between the DNA/LNA probe and the target DNA sequence
   granted multiple rapid analyses, with up to 40 analyses per single
   surface possible, and a single test requiring approximately 5 min.
   When applied to non-amplified DNA extracts from the blood of
   field-infected pigs, the assay discriminated between ASFV-infected and
   ASFV non-infected animals, and allowed the rapid quantification of ASF
   viral DNA, with values falling in the range 373-1058 copies/mu L of
   genomic ASFV DNA. In this range, excellent correlation was observed
   between the results of this biosensor and OIE-approved qPCR.
   This method represents a promising screening assay for preliminary ASF
   diagnosis, having the major advantages in the relative rapidity,
   ease-of-use, the reusability of the sensing surface, and low cost per
   single test.},

Title = {Retrospective analysis of Bluetongue farm risk profile definition, based

Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Bluetongue (BT) is a vector-borne disease transmitted by species of
   Culicoides midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae). Many studies have
   contributed to clarifying various aspects of its aetiology, epidemiology
   and vector dynamic; however, BT remains a disease of epidemiological and
   economic importance that affects ruminants worldwide. Since 2000, the
   Sardinia region has been the most affected area of the Mediterranean
   basin. The region is characterised by wide pastoral areas for sheep and
   represents the most likely candidate region for the study of Bluetongue
   virus (BTV) distribution and prevalence in Italy. Furthermore, specific
   information on the farm level and epidemiological studies needs to be
   provided to increase the knowledge on the disease's spread and to
   provide valid mitigation strategies in Sardinia. This study conducted a
   punctual investigation into the spatial patterns of BTV transmission to
   define a risk profile for all Sardinian farmsby using a logistic
   multilevel mixed model that take into account agro-meteorological
   aspects, as well as farm characteristics and management. Data about
   animal density (i.e. sheep, goats and cattle), vaccination, previous
   outbreaks, altitude, land use, rainfall, evapotranspiration, water
   surface, and farm management practices (i.e. use of repellents,
   treatment against insect vectors, storage of animals in shelter
   overnight, cleaning, presence of mud and manure) were collected for
   12,277 farms for the years 2011-2015. The logistic multilevel mixed
   model showed the fundamental role of climatic factors in disease
   development and the protective role of good management, vaccination,
   outbreak in the previous year and altitude. Regional BTV risk maps were
   developed, based on the predictor values of logistic model results, and
   updated every 10 days. These maps were used to identify, 20 days in
   advance, the areas at highest risk. The risk farm profile, as defined by
   the model, would provide specific information about the role of each
   factor for all Sardinian institutions involved in devising BT prevention
   and control strategies.},

Abstract = {Increasing knowledge on blood profiles for bulls residing in an

   value and because they represent a homogeneous bovine sub-population
   with specific characteristics different from other categories of cattle.
   Therefore, the aims of this study were to calculate descriptive
   statistics for blood variables routinely collected from Holstein
   Friesian bulls of genetic merit; to investigate the sources of variation
   (age, season, and genetic merit) and to calculate the relationship among
   blood analytes and selection indexes calculated on their daughters. Age
   affected some erythrocytes series (increasing trend) and white blood
   cell count (decreasing trend). The seasonal factor influenced
   significantly mainly urea. Total bilirubin was significantly affected by
   genetic merit, inversely correlated with the official productive
   selection index. Hematologic variables were mainly correlated with
   production index, whereas biochemical variables, such as glucose, urea
   and proteins, were related to fertility index.},

Title = {Systemic profiling of ectopic fat deposits in the reproductive tract of
   dairy cows},
Journal = {THERIOGENOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {114},
Pages = {46-53},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {During the transition period, high-yielding dairy cows suffer from
   negative energy balance, intense lipomobilization and impaired lipid
   metabolism; this metabolic condition can lead to overburdened
   triglycerides accumulation in the liver, known as liver lipidosis, which
   has been associated to impaired fertility in dairy cows. The mechanisms
   of this impairment can be in principle correlated with the presence and
   the extent of ectopic fat depots. However, current methods for
   evaluating fat accumulation in liver and in the reproductive tract
   suffer from low resolution, sensitivity, and specificity. Confocal
   microscopes are equipped with Gallium arsenide phosphide detectors, thus
   enabling the acquisition of intense signals from tissue biopsies. This
   method could differentiate whether fat deposition occurred without
   requiring sample sectioning. Here, we examined with this technique
   liver, uterine and ovarian samples of heifers and regularly slaughtered
   repeat breeder and overconditioned dairy cows, to quantify lipid
   droplets and depots at a submicrometer scale with high specificity. With
   the aid of this technique, we found lipid depots in uterine and ovarian
   specimens. Moreover, we found that the size and number of depots
   increased with the degree of liver lipidosis. Further studies are needed
   to elucidate the relationship between the severity and extent of these
   deposits and the fertility of lactating dairy cows. Since tissues other
   than liver display different characteristic lipid droplet distributions,
   this technique can be potentially employed to shed new light on the
   pathogenesis of lipidosis and to assess new risk factors for

Abstract = {Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular pathogen and the cause of
   Q fever in many animal species and humans. Several studies have reported
   the association between C. burnetii and abortion, premature delivery,
   stillbirth, and weak offspring. However, no solid evidence indicates
   that C. burnetii causes endometritis, subfertility, and retained fetal
   membranes. For this study, histopathological and PCR evaluation were
   performed on 40 uterine biopsies from dairy cattle with poor fertility.
   Uterine swabs were concurrently tested with microbiology assays. The
   endometrial biopsies of 30 cows did not have any significant lesions,
   and no pathogens were identified by aerobic bacterial culture and PCR.
   Ten cows were PCR-positive for C. burnetii and negative for other
   pathogens by aerobic bacterial culture and PCR. These 10 cases revealed
   a mild to severe chronic endometritis admixed with perivascular and
   periglandular fibrosis. Immunohistochemical evaluation of C. burnetii
   PCR-positive biopsies identified, for the first time, the presence of
   intralesional and intracytoplasmic C. burnetii in macrophages in the
   endometrium of cattle.},

Abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are suggested to play a role in the
   pathogenesis of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, a severe respiratory
   disorder caused by Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides (Mmm). The
   present study investigated the generation of ROS by different strains of
   Mmm, as well as their effect on the oxidative response of bovine
   neutrophils. The production of ROS was indirectly measured using a
   luminol-based chemiluminescence assay. Our results confirm that Mmm can
   produce ROS via the metabolism of glycerol, significant differences
   existing between African and European strains. Mmm was capable of
   adhering to the external surface of neutrophils. Interestingly, Mmm
   enhanced the respiratory burst of bovine neutrophils. This activity was
   particularly pronounced with the African field strain and in presence of
   glycerol. Taken together, our data argue in favour of a major role for
   neutrophils as the main source of ROS in contagious bovine
   pleuropneumonia.},

Abstract = {Scarce data are currently available about the ecology of canine
   adenoviruses (CAdVs) in wild carnivores. In this paper, the consecutive
   circulation of CAdV-1 and CAdV-2 in wild carnivores maintained in a
   French zoological park is reported. A fatal CAdV-1 infection was
   observed in a Eurasian wolf (Canis lupus lupus), which displayed gross
   lesions, histopathological changes and immunohistochemical findings
   suggestive of CAdV-1 infection. The virus was isolated on cell cultures
   and its genome was determined through next-generation sequencing,
   resulting genetically related to a recent Italian CAdV-1 strain detected
   in an Italian wolf. Subsequently, subclinical circulation of CAdV-2 was
   demonstrated by molecular methods in wild carnivores maintained in the
   same zoological park, some of which had been previously vaccinated with
   a CAdV-2 vaccine. Virus detection at a long distance from vaccination
   and by unvaccinated animals was suggestive of infection by a CAdV-2
   field strain, although no data are available about the extent and
   duration of shedding of CAdV-2 modified-live virus in wild or domestic
   carnivores. The present paper provides new insights into the CAdV
   ecology in wildlife, although future studies are needed to fully
   understand the pathogenic potential of both CAdVs especially in
   endangered carnivore species.},

Abstract = {The human microbiota is a complex ecological community of commensal,
   symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms harboured by the human body.
   Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, in particular targeted
   amplicon sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (16S-seq), are
   enabling the identification and quantification of human-resident
   microorganisms at unprecedented resolution, providing novel insights
   into the role of the microbiota in health and disease. Once microbial
   abundances are quantified through NGS data analysis, diversity indices
   provide valuable mathematical tools to describe the ecological
   complexity of a single sample or to detect species differences between
   samples. However, diversity is not a determined physical quantity for
   which a consensus definition and unit of measure have been established,
   and several diversity indices are currently available. Furthermore, they
   were originally developed for macroecology and their robustness to the
   possible bias introduced by sequencing has not been characterized so
   far. To assist the reader with the selection and interpretation of
   diversity measures, we review a panel of broadly used indices,
   describing their mathematical formulations, purposes and properties, and
   characterize their behaviour and criticalities in dependence of the data
   features using simulated data as ground truth. In addition, we make
   available an R package, DiversitySeq, which implements in a unified
   framework the full panel of diversity indices and a simulator of 16S-seq
   data, and thus represents a valuable resource for the analysis of
   diversity from NGS count data and for the benchmarking of computational
   methods for 16S-seq.},

Abstract = {Zika Virus (ZIKV) is a RNA virus belonging to the genus Flavivirus,
   family Flaviviridae. This virus is transmitted through bite of Aedes
   mosquitoes, in particular Ae. aegypti. On February 1st 2016, the World
   Health Organization (WHO) has declared ZIKV a Public Health Emergency of
   International Concern. Successively, considering the establishment of
   Ae. albopictus, WHO has classified Italy as having a moderate likelihood
   of local transmission of ZIKV, preceded in Europe only by France. For
   this reason an entomological surveillance plan was been activated in
   Sardinia in 2016. BG Sentinel Mosquito Traps have been positioned in 29
   sites, comprising urban areas and points of entry, as ports and
   airports. Mosquitoes were collected fortnightly from April to December.
   A total of 3,089 mosquitoes were collected belonging to 10 species. The
   most numerous species have been Cx. pipiens s.l. and Ae. albopictus. All
   mosquitoes sampled have been assayed by real time reverse transcriptase
   PCR for detection of ZIKV RNA. A total of 584 pool have been analyzed
   and have been reported no evidence of ZIKV. A permanent entomological
   surveillance should be implemented principally in the urban areas and
   points of entry, as ports and airports, because Ae. albopictus,
   susceptible to ZIKV, is established in Sardinia and also know the recent
   introduction of invasive mosquitoes species Ae. koericus and Ae.

Abstract = {Cathelicidins are an important family of antimicrobial peptide effectors
   of innate immunity in vertebrates. Two members of this group, CATH-1 and
   CATH-2, have been identified and characterized in teleosts (ray-finned
   fish). In this study, we investigated the expression of these genes in
   different tissues of rainbow trout challenged with 4 different
   inactivated pathogens. By using qPCR, we detected a strong induction of
   both cath-1 and cath-2 genes within 24 hours after intraperitoneal
   inoculation with Lactococcus garvieae, Yersinia ruckeri, Aeromonas
   salmonicida, or Flavobacterium psychrophilum cells. Up to 700-fold
   induction of cath-2 was observed in the spleen of animals challenged
   with Y. ruckeri. Moreover, we found differences in the intensity and
   timing of gene up-regulation in the analyzed tissues. The overall
   results highlight the importance of cathelicidins in the immune response
   mechanisms of salmonids.},

Title = {Microbiological Parameters in the Primary Production of Berries: A Pilot
   Study},
Journal = {FOODS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The primary production of fresh soft fruits was considered to be a
   suspected critical point for the contamination of frozen berries that
   were responsible for the large 2013-2014 Hepatitis A virus (HAV)
   outbreak in Europe. In this study, an Italian berries' production area
   was studied for its agro-technical characteristics, and the fresh fruits
   were analyzed for the presence of enteric viruses (HAV and Norovirus
   (NoV) genogroup I and genogroup II (GGI and GGII)), the enumeration of
   hygienic quality parameters, and the prevalence of bacterial pathogens.
   A total of 50 producers were sampled, who specialized in the exclusive
   or shared cultivation of berries. Escherichia coli was detected in two
   blackberry samples, whereas HAV and Norovirus were not detected. The
   samples were negative for Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and
   Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). The farms' attributes
   were not associated with positive samples, apart from the presence of E.
   coli and the aerobic mesophilic bacteria for blackberry that were
   statistically correlated. In blueberries, the high aerobic mesophilic
   count could likely be associated with the resistance of the outer layer
   to handling. However, the two pathogens (Salmonella spp. and STEC) and
   the targeted viruses (HAV, NoV GGI and GGII) were not detected,
   highlighting the low risk of foodborne pathogens and viral contamination
   at the primary production stage of the berry food chain in the area
   considered in this pilot study.},

Abstract = {The study summarises the results obtained over the period 2002-2013 by
   the Italian IT-Enter-Vet network, aimed at collecting data on Salmonella
   isolates from non-human sources. A total of 42,491 Salmonella isolates
   were reported with a progressive decrease over the years. S. Typhimurium
   was the most frequent serovar up to 2011, but then, it was overtaken by
   S. 4,{[}5],12,:i:-, S. Derby, S. Livingstone and S. Enteritidis
   alternated as the third most commonly isolated serovars. With regard to
   the sources of isolation, S. Typhimurium was distributed ubiquitously
   among the animal species. On the contrary, S. 4,{[}5],12,:i:- and S.
   Derby were strictly associated with pigs, whereas S. Livingstone, S.
   Enteritidis and S. Infantis were clearly related to poultry.
   Intriguingly, when the frequency of serovar distribution along the food
   chain was considered, it was evident that S. Typhimurium and S. Derby
   tended to persist along the chain, as they were isolated even more
   frequently from foods than from animals. A similar distribution was
   found for S. Enteritidis and S. Hadar. Despite limitations related to
   non-mandatory participation of laboratories in the network, the data
   presented are valuable to obtain a picture of the evolution of
   Salmonella from non-human sources over time in Italy.},

Abstract = {Babesia caballi and Theileria equi are tick-borne pathogens causing
   equine piroplasmosis infecting the Equidae family in which they cause
   significant sanitary and economic losses. Furthermore, equine
   piroplasmosis is included in the World Animal Health Organization (OIE)
   notifiable diseases list with possible movement restrictions for
   positive horses.
   Thirty-nine EDTA and whole-blood samples collected during 2013 and 2014
   from symptomatic and asymptomatic horses of Central-Southern Italy were
   included in the present study either because of their strongly positive
   results in Real Time (RT) PCRs targeting the 18S rRNA gene specific for
   each piroplasm and/or due to their serological ELISA/18S rRNA RT-PCR
   discordant results. A nested PCR amplifying the hypervariable V4 region
   of the 18S rRNA gene of both piroplasms was performed on all samples. T.
   equi positive samples were also analysed with a PCR targeting the equi
   merozoite antigen 1-gene (EMA-1). The sequences obtained were thirty for
   T. equi, 25 of which were for the hypervariable V4 region of the 18S
   rRNA gene and 13 for the EMA-1 gene, with eight samples positive for
   both targets, while only six 18S rRNA gene sequences were retrieved for
   B. caballi.
   The phylogenetic analysis results are as follows: T. equi sequences of
   the 18S rRNA gene clustered in three different phylogenetic groups,
   respectively in the A (15), B (9) and C (1) while those of B. caballi in
   the A (1), B1 (3) and B2 (2) groups. T. equi sequences for EMA-1 gene
   clustered in A (11) and in B (2).
   This analysis confirms that both T. equi and B. caballi sequences
   present a genetic heterogeneity independently of their geographical
   location, similar to that reported by other authors.
   Statistical associations were evaluated between phylogenetic groups of
   T. equi 18S rRNA gene and each of the following variables, using
   Fisher's exact test: clinical signs, serological ELISA/ 18S rRNA RT-PCR
   discordant results and T. equi EMA-1 negativity. The different groups
   were found to be statistically related to the presence of signs (less
   present in group B samples), to ELISA negativity/18S rRNA RT-PCR
   positivity (more seronegative samples in group B). No statistical
   analysis was performed for the B. caballi as the number of sequences
   available was insufficient and for the EMA - 1 sequences which almost
   all grouped in the same cluster.
   The results here obtained provide additional information about T. equi
   and B. caballi sequences, which could also be used to verify the
   performance of serological and molecular diagnostic methods.},

Abstract = {AimsTo evaluate the survival of Mycobacterium avium subsp.
   paratuberculosis (MAP) during anaerobic digestion (AD), we studied two
   different biogas plants loaded with manure and slurry from
   paratuberculosis-infected dairy herds.
   Methods and ResultsBoth plants were operating under mesophilic
   conditions, the first with a single digester and the second with a
   double digester. Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis detection
   was performed by sampling each stage of the process, specifically the
   prefermenter, fermenter, liquid digestate and solid digestate stages,
   for 11months. In both plants, MAP was isolated from the prefermenter
   stage. Only the final products, the solid and liquid digestates, of the
   one-stage plant showed viable MAP, while no viable MAP was detected in
   the digestates of the two-stage plant.
   ConclusionsMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis showed a
   significant decrease during subsequent steps of the AD process,
   particularly in the two-stage plant. We suggest that the second digester
   maintained the digestate under anaerobic conditions for a longer period
   of time, thus reducing MAP survival and MAP load under the culture
   detection limit.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyOur data are unable to exclude the
   presence of MAP in the final products of the biogas plants, particularly
   those products from the single digester; therefore, the use of
   digestates as fertilizers is a real concern related to the possible
   environmental contamination with MAP.},

Title = {New genotyping method for the causative agent of crayfish plague

Abstract = {The oomycete Aphanomyces astaci causes crayfish plague, the most
   important disease of European freshwater crayfish species. Presumably
   introduced into Europe 150 years ago with the import of North American
   crayfish, A. astaci is highly pathogenic to European crayfish species.
   Five genotypes (A, B, C, D, and E) have been defined based on random
   amplified polymorphic DNA analysis (RAPD-PCR) from A. astaci pure
   cultures. The distinction of genotypes is an essential tool to conduct
   molecular epidemiological studies on crayfish plague and it has been
   used to clarify and better understand the history and spread of this
   disease in Europe. Whereas RAPD-PCR requires DNA from pure culture
   isolates, the development of genotyping tools that can be applied to DNA
   extracted from clinical samples allows a much wider application of
   genotyping studies, including revisiting historic samples. In this
   study, we present a new approach that adds to currently available
   methods for genotyping A. astaci strains directly from clinical crayfish
   samples. Whole-genome sequencing of A. astaci strains representing all
   currently known genotypes was employed, genomic regions unique to the
   respective genotype identified, and a PCR-based genotyping assay
   designed, which focuses on the presence/absence of PCR product after
   amplification with the genotype-specific primers. Our diagnostic
   methodology was tested using DNA extracts from pure A. astaci cultures,
   other Aphanomyces species and additional oomycetes, samples from a
   recent Italian crayfish plague outbreak and additional historical
   samples available in the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and
   Aquaculture Science laboratory. The new markers were reliable for pure
   culture and clinical samples from a recent outbreak and successfully
   discriminated genotype A, B, D, and E. The marker for genotype C
   required an additional sequencing step of the generated PCR product to
   confirm genotype.},

Abstract = {Canine parvovirus (CPV) is the etiological agent of a severe viral
   disease of dogs. After its emergence in late 1970s, the CPV original
   type (CPV-2) was rapidly and totally replaced by three antigenic
   variants named CPV-2a, CPV-2b and CPV-2c. CPV has an evolutionary rate
   nearest to those of RNA viruses, with consequences on disease diagnosis
   and epidemiology. This paper reports the molecular characterization of
   eight CPV-2a strains collected from dogs in Italy in 2016-2017. Genetic
   analysis was conducted on a CPV genomic region encompassing both open
   reading frames (ORFs) encoding for nonstructural (NS1-NS2) and
   structural proteins (VP1-VP2). Sequence analysis indicates new and
   unreported sequence changes, mainly affecting the VP2 gene, which
   included the mutation Tyr324Leu. This study represents the first
   evidence of a new CPV-2a mutant (VP2 324Leu) and illustrates the
   importance of a continuous molecular survey in order to obtain more
   information on effective spread of new CPV mutants.},

Abstract = {Canine distemper virus (CDV) is the etiologic agent of distemper in
   dogs. It exhibits an elevated potential of crossing species barriers,
   infecting a wide range of wild and domestic carnivores. Of its encoding
   genes, hemagglutinin (H) shows high heterogeneity, and it was used to
   determine the relationship between CDV strains due to its variability
   and key role in determining cell tropism, host shift, and in eliciting a
   protective immune response. This study analysed the full-length H gene
   sequence of Arctic-like CDV strains collected from dogs in Italy during
   a period in which an increased activity of CDV diffusion was observed.
   The common amino acid changes and features of Arctic-like CDV strains
   collected from 2011 to 2016 in Europe were described, providing an
   updated analysis of the genomic features. A comparison with CDV vaccine
   strains was carried out to evaluate the increased genomic difference
   with CDV Arctic-like field strains. This study provides a complete and
   updated analysis of the current spreading strains of Arctic-like lineage
   and the main amino acid variations in the hemagglutinin gene sequence
   circulating in Italy. Moreover, it provides novel information regarding
   the evolution of the most recent CDV Arctic-like lineage strains
   collected in Europe.},

Abstract = {A 7-year-old neutered female Doberman pinscher was presented with a
   palpebral nodule on the haired eyelid of the left eye. The nodule was
   removed surgically. Microscopically, the nodule was consistent with
   eyelid melanocytoma. The tumour was characterized by the presence of
   numerous lacunar and slit-like spaces filled by erythrocytes and
   interspersed throughout the neoplastic melanocytes.
   Immunohistochemically, these spaces were lined by cells expressing PNL2
   and factor VIII, but the cells were negative for CD31. These findings
   were consistent with neoplastic melanocytes without endothelial cell
   participation. This feature was interpreted as `vasculogenic mimicry', a
   mechanism of tumour angiogenesis that is well-recognized in human
   melanomas, but has not yet been reported in melanomas in animals. (C)

Title = {Low evolutionary rate of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) in
   Italy is associated with reduced virulence in trout},
Journal = {VIRUS EVOLUTION},
Year = {2018},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) is a naked double-stranded
   RNA virus with a bi-segmented genome that is classified within the
   family Birnaviridae, genus Aquabirnavirus. IPNV was first detected in
   Italian trout farms in the late 1970s and ultimately became endemic. To
   characterize the evolution of IPNV circulating in Italy, particularly
   whether there is a link between evolutionary rate and virulence, we
   obtained and analyzed the VP1 (polymerase) and the pVP2 (major capsid
   protein precursor) sequences from 75 IPNV strains sampled between 1978
   and 2017. These data revealed that the Italian IPNV exhibit relatively
   little genetic variation over the sampling period, falling into four
   genetic clusters within a single genogroup (group 2 for VP1 and
   genogroup V for pVP2) and contained one example of inter-segment
   reassortment. The mean evolutionary rates for VP1 and pVP2 were
   estimated to be 1.70 and 1.45 x 10(-4) nucleotide substitutions per
   site, per year, respectively, and hence significantly lower than those
   seen in other Birnaviruses. Similarly, the relatively low ratios of
   non-synonymous (d(N)) to synonymous (d(S)) nucleotide substitutions per
   site in both genes indicated that IPNV was subject to strong selective
   constraints, again in contrast to other RNA viruses infecting salmonids
   that co-circulate in the same area during the same time period. Notably,
   all the Italian IPNV harbored a proline at position 217 (P-217) and a
   threonine at position 221 (T-221) in pVP2, both of which are associated
   with a low virulence phenotype. We therefore suggest the lower virulence
   of IPNV may have resulted in reduced rates of virus replication and
   hence lower rates of evolutionary change. The data generated here will
   be of importance in understanding the factors that shape the evolution
   of Aquabirnaviruses in nature.},

Abstract = {In the current decade, the major risk factors that play a role in
   bluetongue disease development have been studied, with many of these
   studies being carried out in order to help understand the spread of the
   disease. Although these studies have focused on environmental factors
   and territory features, establishing their role in bluetongue outbreak
   probability, little attention has been given to the analysis of the
   characteristics of farms at a micro-level. The main objective of this
   study was to identify farm management and groups with similar hygiene
   practice habits, i.e. ``farm management{''}, providing a micro-scale
   characterization that has not been studied in detail earlier. A total of
   5547 Biosecurity Habits questionnaire, based on examining the respect of
   all suggested practices against bluetongue, was completed by specialized
   veterinarians or agronomists, each involving a Sardinian sheep farm.
   Since the biosecurity items were dichotomous, multiple correspondence
   analysis was performed to summarize a set of categorical variables into
   a small number of orthogonal variables called principal components, and
   provide graphical displays. As the first two dimensions of multiple
   correspondence analysis accounted for more than 50\% of the variability
   between farms, these were retained for the analysis. The first dimension
   generally defined the good/poor farm management, where good management
   was particularly associated with large farms. The second dimension was
   able to explain differences in hygiene conditions. Finally, the
   association of these gradients with bluetongue was assessed using
   logistic regression. There was a significant association (p < 0.0001)
   between the first dimension and the probability of bluetongue at the
   farm level, showing an important role in generally improving the
   management to prevent the disease spread. The high hygiene conditions
   (dimension 2) reveal a strong association (p < 0.0001) in preventing
   bluetongue, with approximately 1.5 times less probability of disease
   development as compared to farms with low hygiene and cleaning. This
   innovative micro-analysis could be an important support for future
   strategic programs against this vector-borne disease, which to date
   affects our region.},

Title = {Multilocus microsatellite typing (MLMT) reveals host-related population

Abstract = {Background
   Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by Leishmania infantum is an ongoing
   health problem in southern Europe, where dogs are considered the main
   reservoirs of the disease. Current data point to a northward spread of
   VL and canine leishmaniasis (CanL) in Italy, with new foci in northern
   regions previously regarded as non-endemic.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   Multilocus microsatellite typing (MLMT) was performed to investigate
   genetic diversity and population structure of L. infantum on 55 samples
   from infected humans, dogs and sand flies of the E-R region between 2013
   and 2017. E-R samples were compared with 10 L. infantum samples from VL
   cases in other Italian regions (extra E-R) and with 52 strains within
   the L. donovani complex. Data displayed significant microsatellite
   polymorphisms with low allelic heterozygosity. Forty-one unique and
   eight repeated MLMT profiles were recognized among the L. infantum
   samples from E-R, and ten unique MLMT profiles were assigned to the
   extra E-R samples. Bayesian analysis assigned E-R samples to two
   distinct populations, with further sub-structuring within each of them;
   all CanL samples belonged to one population, genetically related to
   Mediterranean MON-1 strains, while all but one VL cases as well as the
   isolate from the sand fly Phlebotomus perfiliewi fell under the second
   population. Conversely, VL samples from other Italian regions proved to
   be genetically similar to strains circulating in dogs.
   Conclusions/Significance
   A peculiar epidemiological situation was observed in northeastern Italy,
   with the co-circulation of two distinct populations of L. infantum; one
   population mainly detected in dogs and the other population detected in
   humans and in a sand fly. While the classical cycle of CanL in Italy
   fits well into the data obtained for the first population, the
   population found in infected humans exhibits a different cycle, probably
   not involving a canine reservoir. This study can contribute to a better
   understanding of the population structure of L. infantum circulating in
   northeastern Italy, thus providing useful epidemiologic information for
   public health authorities.},

Title = {Glioblastoma niches: from the concept to the phenotypical reality},

Abstract = {Recently, the concept of niches as sites of tumor progression, invasion,
   and angiogenesis in glioblastoma (GB) has been extensively debated.
   Niches, considered the sites in which glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs)
   reside, have been classified as perivascular, perinecrotic, and
   invasive. However, from a neuropathological point of view, it is not
   easy to establish when a tumor structure can be considered a niche. The
   relevant literature has been reviewed in the light of our recent
   experience on the subject. As for perinecrotic niches, the occurrence of
   GSCs around necrosis is interpreted as triggered by hypoxia through
   HIF-1 alpha. Our alternative hypothesis is that, together with
   progenitors, they are the cell constituents of hyper-proliferative areas
   of GB, where perinecrotic niches have developed, and they would,
   therefore, represent the remnants of GSCs/progenitors spared by the
   developing necrosis. Perivascular structures originate from both
   transport vessels and exchange vessels, i.e., venules, arterioles, or
   the undefinable neo-formed small vessels, but only those in which a
   direct contact between GSCs/progenitors and endothelial cells occurs can
   be called niches. Both pericytes and microglia/macrophages play a role
   in niche function: Macrophages of blood origin invade GB only after the
   appearance of ``mother vessels{''} with consequent blood-brain barrier
   disruption. Not all vessel/tumor cell structures can be considered
   niches, that is, crucial sites of tumor progression, invasion, and
   angiogenesis.},

Abstract = {Midichloria mitochondrii is a tick-borne intracellular bacterium of the
   order Rickettsiales, found with high prevalence in the sheep tick
   (Ixodes ricinus). Midichloria mitochondrii is capable of vertical
   transmission in the tick, but recently evidence of potential horizontal
   transmission to the tick hosts through the blood meal has been reported.
   We investigated the presence of the bacterium in the blood of roe deer
   (Capreolus capreolus) collected from an area known to be highly infested
   with I. ricinus ticks. We collected blood and sera samples for 3 yr in
   Gardouch (Haute Garonne, France) and subjected them to molecular
   screening through PCR and to serological investigation using
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blot. Bacterial DNA was
   detected in the blood of four of seven animals, but only at one or two
   points in time, whereas all sera were positive for M. mitochondrii
   antigens at all times. Our results indicated that the presence of the
   bacterium in the blood is transient, but the antibody response appeared
   to be long-lasting, possibly due to constant exposure to tick bites, and
   thus to repeated injection of bacteria. The role of M. mitochondrii in
   the mammalian host, and its interaction with other tick-borne bacteria,
   remains unknown.},

Abstract = {In the present study, we investigated the health status of marine
   mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) caged and deployed at three
   different sites on the Sardinian coastline characterized by different
   levels of contamination: Fornelli (F, the reference site), Cala Real
   (CR), and Porto Torres (PT). A new low density oligonucleotide
   microarray was used to investigate global gene expression in the
   digestive gland of mussels. Target genes were selected to cover most of
   the biological processes involved in the stress response in bivalve
   mollusks (e.g. DNA metabolism, translation, immune response,
   cytoskeleton organization). A battery of classical biomarkers was also
   employed to complement the gene expression analyses. Chemical analysis
   revealed higher loads of heavy metals (Pb and Cu) and total polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at PT compared to the other sites. In
   mussels deployed at CR, functional genomics analysis of the microarray
   data rendered 78 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in 11
   biological processes. Animals exposed at PT had 105 DEGs that were
   characterized by the regulation of 14 biological processes, including
   mitochondrial activity, adhesion to substrate, DNA metabolism,
   translation, metal resistance, and cytoskeleton organization. Biomarker
   data (lysosomal membrane stability, lysosomal/cytoplasm volume ratio,
   lipofuscin accumulation, metallothionein content, micronucleus
   frequency, and cyloskeleton alteration) were in trend with
   transcriptomic output. Biomarker data were integrated using the Mussel
   Expert System (MES), allowing defining the area in which the presence of
   chemicals is toxic for mussels. Our study provides the opportunity to
   adopt a new approach of integrating transcriptomic (microarray) results
   with classical biomarkers to assess the impact of pollutants on marine
   mussels in biomonitoring programs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Seroprevalence of Coxiella burnetii infection (Q fever) in sheep farms
   located in Sicily (Southern Italy) and related risk factors},

Abstract = {Q fever is an important and widespread zoonotic disease caused by the
   bacterium Coxiella burnetii, which has been recently reclassified as
   belonging to the order Legionellales. Q fever in humans is considered an
   endemic, mostly occupational, disease in several Mediterranean
   Countries.
   The infection is often asymptomatic in ruminants but infected animals
   excrete the bacteria into the environment, mainly during and after
   parturition or abortion.
   The aim of this study was to estimate the seroprevalence of C. burnetii
   infection and related risk factors in Sicilian ovine farms. A total of
   6641 serum samples, from sheep belonging to 205 flocks, were examined by
   Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA).
   The seroprevalence at the animal level was 18\% (95\% CI), while at farm
   level it was 73.6\% (95\% CI). Moreover, an evaluation of potential risk
   factors was carried out on farms, including: farm size, contact with
   other animals, production type, farm localization and presence of water
   sources. The multivariate analysis indicated only two factors
   significantly associated with C. burnetii seropositivity: flock size
   (chi(2) = 10.82; p < 0.0010) and altitude of the farm (chi(2) = 4.28; p
   < 0.0386).
   These findings represent a first piece of information on Coxiella
   burnetii circulation in the examined areas. There is actually no
   specific vaccination plan to reduce the infection prevalence in animals;
   therefore, a better knowledge on the pathogen spreading could be helpful
   to take adequate preventive measures, especially considering the
   potential consequences and risks for human public health too.},

Title = {Sheep embryonic stem-like cells engrafted into sheep femoral condyle
   osteochondral defects: 4-year follow-up},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},
Month = {JUN 28},
Abstract = {Background: Articular cartilage lacks a regenerative response. Embryonic
   stem cells (ESCs) are a source of pluripotent cells for cartilage
   regeneration. Their use, however, is associated with a risk of teratoma
   development, which depends on multiple factors including the number of
   engrafted cells and their degree of histocompatibility with recipients,
   the immunosuppression of the host and the site of transplantation.
   Colonies of sheep embryonic stem-like (ES-like) cells from in
   vitro-produced embryos, positive for stage-specific embryonic antigens
   (SSEAs), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Oct 4, Nanog, Sox 2 and Stat 3 gene
   expression, and forming embryoid bodies, were pooled in groups of
   two-three, embedded in fibrin glue and engrafted into osteochondral
   defects in the left medial femoral condyles of 3 allogeneic ewes (ES).
   Empty defects (ED) and defects filled with cell-free glue (G) in the
   condyles of the controlateral stifle joint served as controls. After
   euthanasia at 4 years post-engraftment, the regenerated tissue was
   evaluated by macroscopic, histological and immunohistochemical (collagen
   type II) examinations and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) assay
   to prove the ES-like cells origin of the regenerated tissue.
   Results: No teratoma occurred in any of the ES samples. No statistically
   significant macroscopic or histological differences were observed among
   the 3 treatment groups. FISH was positive in all the 3 ES samples.
   Conclusions: This in vivo preclinical study allowed a long-term
   evaluation of the occurrence of teratoma in non-immunosuppressed
   allogeneic adult sheep engrafted with allogeneic ES-like cells,
   supporting the safe and reliable application of ES cells in the clinic.},

Abstract = {Xylella fastidiosa, a bacterial species infecting a broad range plants,
   includes five subspecies, fastidiosa, multiplex, pauca, mulberry and
   sandyi. In Europe, Xylella was isolated in olive trees in southern Italy
   (Apulia region) during the year 2013. The aim of the present study was
   to apply phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis to trace the possible
   origin and way of the entrance of Xylella fastidiosa in Italy. All the
   genomes available for Xylella fastidiosa spp were downloaded from NCBI.
   A phylogeographic analysis was performed using BEAST. X.fastidiosa
   strains belonging to X.fastidiosa subsp. pauca and subsp. sandyi have
   been reported to infect olive trees and coffee plants, respectively. The
   phylogeographic analysis also revealed and confirmed these two different
   ways of provenience X.fastidiosa subsp. pauca from Costa Rica and
   X.fastidiosa subsp sandyi from California Phylogeny have been an
   important tool to validate and support the recent hypothesis for
   X.fastidiosa pauca provenience.},

Title = {Undeclared animal species in dry and wet novel and hydrolyzed protein
   diets for dogs and cats detected by microarray analysis},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},
Month = {JUN 27},
Abstract = {Background: Although the European Pet Food Industry Federation (FEDIAF)
   stated that labels must be accurate and provide detailed information on
   the ingredients, mislabeling of pet food has been documented by several
   authors. This phenomenon is of particular concern when related to
   products used as elimination diets for the diagnosis of adverse food
   reaction (AFR) in dogs and cats because the presence of undeclared
   ingredients may negatively interfere with the trial and prevent the
   veterinarian from making an appropriate diagnosis. The aim of this study
   was to shed light upon the problem of contamination and mislabeling in
   both dry and wet novel protein diets (NPDs) and hydrolyzed protein diets
   (HPDs) using a microarray-based commercial kit which tests for the
   presence of 19 animal species.
   Results: Of the 40 analyzed products (9 dry NPDs, 22 wet NPDs, 6 dry
   HPDs and 3 wet HPDs), ten presented a content that correctly matched the
   label, while five did not contain the declared animal species,
   twenty-three revealed the presence of undeclared animal species, and two
   had a vague label that did not allow the evaluation of its accuracy. The
   most frequently contaminants identified in both dry and wet pet foods
   were pork, chicken and turkey. The presence of undeclared animal species
   was higher in dry than wet pet foods; furthermore, a lower number of
   contaminating animal species was identified in HPDs than NPDs (4 vs 10),
   and a lower number of contaminated HPDs (6 out of 9, 67\%) than
   contaminated NPDs was detected (24 out of 31, 77\%). Thirteen out of 14
   brands tested presented at least one mislabeled product.
   Conclusions: Mislabeling seems to be a widespread issue in pet foods
   used as elimination diets. Contamination can occur in all types of
   products used for the purpose, although dry NPDs are the main issue. Due
   to the high risk of contamination, particular attention should be given
   to both the selection of raw material suppliers and the production
   process.},

Title = {A Web Geographic Information System to share data and explorative
   analysis tools: The application to West Nile disease in the
   Mediterranean basin},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {Background
   In the last decades an increasing number of West Nile Disease cases was
   observed in equines and humans in the Mediterranean basin and
   surveillance systems are set up in numerous countries to manage and
   control the disease. The collection, storage and distribution of
   information on the spread of the disease becomes important for a shared
   intervention and control strategy. To this end, a Web Geographic
   Information System has been developed and disease data, climatic and
   environmental remote sensed data, full genome sequences of selected
   isolated strains are made available. This paper describes the Disease
   Monitoring Dashboard (DMD) web system application, the tools available
   for the preliminary analysis on climatic and environmental factors and
   the other interactive tools for epidemiological analysis.
   Methods
   WNV occurrence data are collected from multiple official and unofficial
   sources. Whole genome sequences and metadata of WNV strains are
   retrieved from public databases or generated in the framework of the
   Italian surveillance activities. Climatic and environmental data are
   provided by NASA website. The Geographical Information System is
   composed by Oracle 10g Database and ESRI ArcGIS Server 10.03; the web
   mapping client application is developed with the ArcGIS API for
   Javascript and Phylocanvas library to facilitate and optimize the
   mash-up approach. ESRI ArcSDE 10.1 has been used to store spatial data.
   Results
   The DMD application is accessible through a generic web browser at
   https://netmed.izs.it/networkMediterraneo/. The system collects data
   through on-line forms and automated procedures and visualizes data as
   interactive graphs, maps and tables. The spatial and temporal dynamic
   visualization of disease events is managed by a time slider that returns
   results on both map and epidemiological curve. Climatic and
   environmental data can be associated to cases through python procedures
   and downloaded as Excel files.
   Conclusions
   The system compiles multiple datasets through user-friendly web tools;
   it integrates entomological, veterinary and human surveillance,
   molecular information on pathogens and environmental and climatic data.
   The principal result of the DMD development is the transfer and
   dissemination of knowledge and technologies to develop strategies for
   integrated prevention and control measures of animal and human diseases.},

Title = {Multilocus genotype analysis outlines distinct histories for Trichinella
   britovi in the neighboring Mediterranean islands of Corsica and Sardinia},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUN 19},
Abstract = {Background: The zoonotic nematode Trichinella britovi was discovered in
   two neighboring Mediterranean islands of Corsica and Sardinia, almost
   simultaneously at the beginning of the 21st century. An epidemiological
   link between the two parasite populations was generally assumed. In
   2015, an outbreak of trichinellosis in Nice, the South of France, was
   reportedly caused by the consumption of raw pork delicatessen imported
   from Corsica. The aims of the present study were to investigate, by
   multilocus genotype (MLG) analyses, the hypothesis of the common origin
   of the Corsican and Sardinian T. britovi foci and to trace ``from fork
   to farm{''} the origin of the pork product, which caused a
   trichinellosis outbreak in mainland France in 2015.
   Methods: Sixty-three T. britovi isolates were collected from animals and
   pork products of Sardinia and Corsica islands and from mainland of
   Italy, France and Spain. We analyzed genetic variability at four
   polymorphic microsatellite loci by two independent algorithms, the
   Bayesian and multivariate analyses, to evaluate the genetic
   relationships of 1367 single larvae.
   Results: Trichinella britovi isolates of the two islands showed
   different genetic structures and the Bayesian analysis revealed a
   different membership of the two insular populations. Furthermore, two
   geographically separate genetic groups were identified among Corsican
   isolates. Lastly, the origin of the pork delicatessen marketed in Nice
   was linked to a breeder-butcher in Corsica.
   Conclusions: The low level of genetic admixture of the insular T.
   britovi isolates suggests that this pathogen colonized the two islands
   by separate events. On the other hand in Corsica, although the isolates
   share the same genetic structure, geographically separate isolates
   showed different membership. We suggest the MLG analysis as a suitable
   method in supporting epidemiological investigations to trace ``from fork
   to farm{''} insular populations of T. britovi.},

Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},
Month = {JUN 18},
Abstract = {Background: The Avian Influenza A (H5N1) virus is endemic in poultry in
   Egypt. The winter of 2014/2015 was particularly worrying as new clusters
   of HPAI A (H5N1) virus emerged, leading to an important number of Al A
   (H5N1) outbreaks in poultry farms and sporadic human cases. To date, few
   studies have investigated the distribution of HPAI A (H5N1) outbreaks in
   Egypt in relation to protective / risk factors at the farm level, a gap
   we intend to fill. The aim of the study was to analyse passive
   surveillance data that were based on observation of sudden and high
   mortality of poultry or drop in duck or chicken egg production, as a
   basis to better understand and discuss the risk of HPAI A (H5N1)
   presence at the farm level in large parts of the Nile Delta.
   Results: The probability of HPAI A (H5N1) presence was associated with
   several characteristics of the farms. Vaccination status, absence of
   windows/openings in the farm and the number of birds per cycle of
   production were found to be protective factors, whereas the presence of
   a duck farm with significant mortality or drop in egg production in the
   village was found to be a risk factor.
   Conclusions: Results demonstrate the key role of several prevention and
   biosecurity measures to reduce HPAI A (H5N1) virus circulation, which
   could promote better poultry farm biosecurity in Egypt.},

Title = {Intake estimates of dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorobiphenyls in the

Abstract = {The implementation of the European Union strategy for
   polychlorodibenzo-dioxins and -furans (PCDD/Fs), and dioxin-like
   polychlorobiphenyls (DL-PCBs) is determining a general reduction of
   their presence in the environment and in the food chain. The most
   important route for human exposure to these substances is food
   consumption and, as a consequence, a progressive decrease of their
   dietary intake has been observed in the last decades. In this context,
   it seemed worth updating the PCDD/F and DL-PCB intake estimation for the
   Italian population. A total of 2659 samples of food of animal and
   vegetable origin analyzed for PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs in the period
   2013-2016 by accredited official laboratories and the national food
   consumption database were considered for the dietary intake assessment
   in different age groups of the Italian general population The median
   cumulative intake estimates expressed as pg WHO-TEQ/kg body weight per
   day and computed with a deterministic and a probabilistic approach were
   1.40-1.52 for children, 0.82-0.85 for adolescents, and 0.64-0.61 for
   adults, respectively. Such results confirm the decreasing trend of
   PCDD/F and DL-PCB dietary intake even though the Tolerable Daily
   Intake(TDI) value of 2 WHO-TEQ/kg body weight per day is exceeded at the
   95th percentile for all age groups, with children as sensitive group.
   Most contributing food categories to the intake resulted fish, food of
   vegetable origin, and cheese. A sensitivity analysis was also performed
   to calculate the target contamination levels able to keep the dietary
   exposure below the TDI. Computed target levels fall between P50 and P97
   of the occurrence distribution of the main food groups, meaning that
   most of the Italian food production can be considered safe. (C) 2018

Title = {Combined larvicidal and adulticidal treatments to control Culicoides
   biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae): Results of a pilot study},

Abstract = {Culicoides biting midges can transmit viruses such as bluetongue virus
   and Schmallenberg virus to ruminants and African horse sickness virus to
   equines. The control of Culicoides population can be based on physical
   and/or chemical methods. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of
   larvicides and adulticides combined treatments to control the vector
   Culicoides populations. Field trials have been conducted during 2014 on
   seven farms in northern Sardinia (Italy). Three insecticide treatments
   (larvicides and adulticides) have been carried out on three farms,
   whereas four farms remained unsprayed as untreated controls. For the
   larval control two commercial formulations, based on diflubenzuron and
   Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (H-14), have been used. Against
   adults a deltamethrin based product has been sprayed on the walls and
   roofs of animal shelters. Adult Culicoides have been collected on each
   farm twice a week with an Onderstepoort blacklight suction trap. After
   each treatment a significant reduction in the abundance of total
   Culicoides, C. imicola and C. newsteadi s.l., has been observed. The
   Obsoletus complex density has been affected by the first two treatments.
   Our results suggest the possibility to control the Culicoides
   populations with a combination of adulticide and larvicide treatments.},

Title = {The containment of potential outbreaks triggered by imported Chikungunya
   cases in Italy: a cost utility epidemiological assessment of vector
   control measures},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 13},
Abstract = {The arrival of infected travelers from endemic regions can trigger
   sustained autochthonous transmission of mosquito-borne pathogens in
   Europe. In 2007 a Chikungunya outbreak was observed in central Italy,
   mostly affecting two villages characterised by a high density of Aedes
   albopictus. The outbreak was mitigated through intervention strategies
   reducing the mosquito abundance. Ten years later, in 2017, sustained
   Chikungunya transmission was documented in both central and southern
   Italy. The proposed analysis identifies suitable reactive measures for
   the containment and mitigation of future epidemics by combining
   epidemiological modeling with a health economic approach, considering
   different arrival times of imported infections and possible delays in
   the notification of cases. Obtained estimates suggest that, if the first
   notification will occur in the middle of the mosquito breeding season,
   the combination of larvicides, adulticides and breeding sites removal
   represents the optimal strategy. In particular, we found that
   interventions implemented in 2007 were cost-effective, with about 3200
   prevented cases, 1450 DALYs averted and (sic)13.5 M saved. Moreover,
   larvicides are proven to be more cost beneficial in early summer and
   warmer seasons, while adulticides should be preferred in autumn and
   colder seasons. Our results provide useful indications supporting urgent
   decision-making of public health authorities in response to emerging
   mosquito-borne epidemics.},

Title = {Molecular Epidemiology of mcr-Encoded Colistin Resistance in
   Enterobacteriaceae From Food-Producing Animals in Italy Revealed Through
   the EU Harmonized Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUN 12},
Abstract = {Colistin resistance by mobilisable mcr genes has been described in
   bacteria of food-animal origin worldwide, which has raised public health
   concerns about its potential foodborne transmission to human pathogenic
   bacteria. Here we provide baseline information on the molecular
   epidemiology of colistin-resistant, mcr-positive Escherichia coli and
   Salmonella isolates in food-producing animals in Italy in 2014-2015. A
   total 678, 861 and 236 indicator E. coli, Extended Spectrum
   Beta-Lactamase (ESBL)/AmpC-producing E. coli, and Salmonella isolates,
   respectively, were tested for colistin susceptibility. These isolates
   were collected according to the EU harmonized antimicrobial resistance
   monitoring program and are representative of at least 90 and 80\% of the
   Italian poultry (broiler chickens and turkeys) and livestock (pigs and
   bovines < 12 months) production, respectively. Whole genome sequencing
   by Illumina technology and bioinformatics (Center for Genomic
   Epidemiology pipeline) were used to type 42 mcr-positive isolates by
   PCR. Colistin resistance was mainly observed in the ESBL/AmpC E. coli
   population, and was present in 25.9, 5.3, 6.5, and 3.9\% of such
   isolates in turkeys, broilers, pigs, and bovines, respectively. Most
   colistin-resistant isolates (141/161, 87.5\%) harbored genes of the
   mcr-1 group. mcr-1 was also detected in a small proportion of Salmonella
   isolates (3/146, 2.0\%) in turkeys. Additional mcr types were mcr-3 in
   four ESBL-producing E. coli from bovines, and two mcr-4 in ESBL (n = 1)
   and indicator E. coli (n = 1) from pigs and bovines. We describe notable
   diversity of mcr variants with predominance of mcr-1.1 and mcr-1.2 on
   conjugative IncX4 plasmids in E. coli and in Salmonella serovars
   Typhimurium, Newport, Blockley from turkey. A new variant, mcr-1.13 was
   detected in the chromosome in E. coli in turkey and pig isolates.
   Additionally, we describe mcr-3.2 and mcr-4.3 in E. coli from bovines,
   and mcr-4.2 in E. coli from pigs. These findings elucidate the
   epidemiology of colistin resistance in food-producing animals in Italy
   along with its genetic background, and highlight the likelihood of mcr
   horizontal transfer between commensal bacteria and major food-borne
   pathogens (Salmonella) within the same type of productions. Thorough
   action and strategies are needed in order to mitigate the risk of mcr
   transfer to humans, in a ``One Health{''} perspective.},

   malignancy: approach to diagnosis and treatment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JUN 11},
Abstract = {Background: Human pulmonary dirofilariasis is a rare zoonosis caused by
   the dog worm Dirofilaria spp., a parasite transmitted by mosquitos and
   resulting in peripheral lung nodules. The filarial nematode enters the
   subcutaneous tissue, travels to the right ventricle and dies causing a
   small pulmonary infarction that may embolize through the pulmonary
   vessels and may appear as a solitary nodule. These nodules are usually
   incidentally identified in asymptomatic patients undergoing chest
   imaging studies, and are generally interpreted to be malignant.
   Case presentation: We present the case report of a human dirofilariasis
   in a patient with multiple pulmonary nodules resected using
   video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). According to our literature
   review, this is the first case with double synchronous lung nodules
   reported in Italy.
   Conclusions: Minimally invasive resection with histologic examination
   may be the best approach for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary
   dirofilariasis. Polymerase Chain Reaction testing may provide a more
   accurate etiological diagnosis in case of an inconclusive pathology
   result.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Brucellosis is essentially a disease of domesticated livestock; however,
   humans can also be infected via the consumption of contaminated meat or
   dairy products, underlying the need for rapid and accurate
   identification methods. Procedures for microbiological identification
   and typing of Brucella spp. are expensive, time-consuming, and must be
   conducted in biohazard containment facilities to minimize operator risk.
   The development of a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
   time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS)-based assay has reduced
   the processing time while maintaining performance standards. In this
   study, to improve the identification accuracy and suitability of the
   MALDI-TOF-based assay for routine diagnosis, we developed a new protein
   extraction protocol and generated a custom reference database containing
   Brucella strains representative of the most widespread species. The
   reference library was then challenged with blind-coded field samples
   isolated from infected animals. The results indicated that the database
   could be used to correctly identify 99.5\% and 97\% of Brucella strains
   at the genus and species level, respectively, indicating that the
   performance of the assay was not affected by the different culture
   conditions used for microbial isolation. Moreover, the inactivated
   samples were stored and shipped to reference laboratories with no ill
   effect on protein stability, thus confirming the reliability of our
   method for routine diagnosis. Finally, we evaluated the epidemiological
   value of the protocol by comparing the clustering analysis results of
   Brucella melitensis strains obtained via multiple locus variable-number
   tandem repeat analysis or MALDI-TOF MS. The results showed that the
   MALDI-TOF assay could not decipher the true phylogenetic tree,
   suggesting that the protein profile did not correspond with the genetic
   evolution of Brucella.},

Abstract = {The presence of botulinum neurotoxin-producing Clostridia (BPC) in food
   sources is a public health concern. In favorable environmental
   conditions, BPC can produce botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) outside or
   inside the vertebrate host, leading to intoxications or
   toxico-infectious forms of botulism, respectively. BPC in food are
   almost invariably detected either by PCR protocols targeted at the known
   neurotoxin-encoding genes, or by the mouse test to assay for the
   presence of BoNTs in the supernatants of enrichment broths inoculated
   with the tested food sample. The sample is considered positive for BPC
   when the supernatant contains toxic substances that are lethal to mice,
   heat-labile and neutralized in vivo by appropriate polyclonal antibodies
   raised against purified BoNTs of different serotypes. Here, we report
   the detection in a food sample of a Clostridium tetani strain that
   produces tetanus neurotoxins (TeNTs) with the above-mentioned
   characteristics: lethal for mice, heat-labile and neutralized by
   botulinum antitoxin type B. Notably, neutralization occurred with two
   different commercially available type B antitoxins, but not with type A,
   C, D, E and F antitoxins. Although TeNT and BoNT fold very similarly,
   evidence that antitoxin B antiserum can neutralize the neurotoxic effect
   of TeNT in vivo has not been documented before. The presence of C.
   tetani strains in food can produce misleading results in BPC detection
   using the mouse test.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted to describe the cheese-making procedure of
   Fontina Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) cheese and to evaluate the
   behavior of Escherichia coli O157:H7 during cheese manufacture and
   ripening. The study was divided into 2 phases: the production of Fontina
   PDO cheese was monitored at 3 different dairies in the Aosta Valley and
   an E. coli O157 challenge was conducted at a fourth dairy. The dairies
   employ different commercial starter cultures for cheese making. The
   growth of lactic acid bacilli (LAB) and the decrease in pH were slower
   in the first hours and the LAB concentrations were overall higher in
   dairy A than in the other 2 dairies. The pH remained substantially
   unchanged during ripening (range 5.2 to 5.4) in all dairies. Water
   activity remained constant at around 0.98 until d 21, when it decreased
   to around 0.97 until d 80 in dairies A and B and 0.95 in dairy E. Whole
   raw cow milk was used for making Fontina cheese according to the
   standard procedure. For the experimental production, the milk was
   inoculated with E. coli O157:H7 at a concentration of approximately 5
   log(10) cfu/mL and commercial starter cultures were used according to
   the Fontina PDO regulation. An increase of 2.0 log(10) cfu/g in E. coli
   O157:H7 was observed during the first 9.5 h of cheese making, followed
   by a decrease at 46 h when pH decreased to 5.4 in all trials. Fresh
   cheeses were salted and held at 10 degrees C for ripening for 80 d.
   Water activity was decreased to 0.952 at the end of the ripening stage.
   The LAB concentrations declined gradually; this trend was more marked
   for the lactobacilli than either the thermophilic or the mesophilic
   lactococci. The increase in LAB count and the decrease in pH in the
   first hours did not seem to affect E. coli O157 growth. Ripening was
   found to inhibit pathogen survival, however, as seen in the reduction of
   3 log(10) from the maximum concentration measured during the earlier
   stages of production.},

Abstract = {The Egg Reappearance Period (ERP) is considered an early indicator of
   anthelmintic resistance. The aims of the present study were to determine
   the field efficacy and evaluate the ERP of four broad-spectrum
   anthelmintic drugs administered at horse dose rate in donkeys naturally
   infected by Cyathostominae. The trials were conducted in two farms (A
   and B). Forty-eight female crossbreed donkeys, 24 animals for each farm,
   were selected on the basis of Fecal Egg Count (FEC) > 300 eggs per gram
   and allocated to four treatment groups of six animals: pyrantel group
   (PYR), fenbendazole group (FBZ), ivermectin group (IVM), and moxidectin
   group (MOX). FEC was performed from the first to the 12th week after
   treatment. In the farm A at 2 weeks after treatment, the Fecal Egg Count
   Reduction Test (FECRT) showed high efficacy for all drugs (PYR 99.3\%,
   FBZ 99.8, and IVM/MOX 100\%), and ERP rates were not shorter than those
   expected. In the farm B at 2 weeks after treatment, FECRT showed high
   efficacy for IVM/MOX (100\%), suspect resistance (86.3\%), and
   resistance (83.9\%) to PYR and FBZ, respectively; only in the MOX group
   a shortened ERP was detected (9 weeks). No adverse reactions were
   observed at clinical examination. The results demonstrate that the major
   anthelmintic classes, administered orally at horse dose, are effective
   and safe for treatment of Cyathostominae in donkeys, although resistance
   development is possible and could be correlated to the high treatment
   frequency and the extra-label use of anthelmintic licensed for
   ruminants. Furthermore, a shortened ERP may be the early indicator of
   developing anthelmintic resistance in donkeys. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {Tritia mutabilis, formerly classified as Nassarius mutabilis, represents
   an important but declining resource for small scale fishery in the
   central Adriatic Sea, likely due to overfishing. A preliminary
   investigation on the use of artificial substrates to favour its spawning
   was carried out in a coastal area off the Abruzzi region, central Italy.
   Between May and June 2015, five groups of six pyramid structures made of
   a steel frame covered by plastic net, with a 0.5 m(2) surface available
   for deposition, were placed on sandy bottoms at about 0.5 nautical miles
   from the coast and at sea depths ranging from 5.5 m to 7.5 m. A density
   of T. mutabilis egg capsules > 1 per 100 cm(2) was observed in two of
   the pyramid groups. The number of embryos present in each capsule ranged
   from 8 to 22 (mean number: 14). At the end of the study, almost all the
   capsules presented an apical opening and were empty, thus indicating
   successful hatching and larval release. This preliminary investigation
   shows that the natural deposition of T. mutabilis egg capsules can be
   facilitated by placing artificial substrates on sandy bottoms and it is
   conceivable that their use would contribute to maintain sustainable
   stocks of this species.},

Abstract = {Toxoplasmosis is a cosmopolitan disease and has a broad range of hosts,
   including humans and several wild and domestic animals. The human
   infection is mostly acquired through the consumption of contaminated
   food and pork meat has been recognized as one of the major sources of
   transmission. There are, however, certain fundamental differences
   between countries; therefore, the present study specifically aims to
   evaluate the exposure of the Italian population to Toxoplasma gondii
   through the ingestion of several types of pork meat products habitually
   consumed in Italy and to estimate the annual number of human infections
   within two subgroups of the population. A quantitative risk assessment
   model was built for this reason and was enriched with new elements in
   comparison to other similar risk assessments in order to enhance its
   accuracy. Sensitivity analysis and two alternative scenarios were
   implemented to identify the factors that have the highest impact on risk
   and to simulate different plausible conditions, respectively. The
   estimated overall average number of new infections per year among adults
   is 12,513 and 92 for pregnant women. The baseline model showed that
   almost all these infections are associated with the consumption of fresh
   meat cuts and preparations (mean risk of infection varied between 4.5 x
   10(-5) and 5.5 x 10(-5)) and only a small percentage is due to fermented
   sausages/salami. On the contrary, salt-cured meat products seem to pose
   minor risk but further investigations are needed to clarify still
   unclear aspects. Among all the considered variables, cooking temperature
   and bradyzoites' concentration in muscle impacted most the risk.},

Abstract = {Female reproductive performance is a central component of ungulate
   population dynamics, and it can be influenced by individual, social, and
   environmental factors. Researchers have often assumed direct effects of
   different predictors on reproduction, yet more complex relationships
   should be considered when investigating temporal variations in
   life-history traits within a broader eco-evolutionary context. In this
   study, we explored direct effects of individual, social, and
   environmental predictors on female reproductive performance and
   investigated potential causal chains among variables. We analyzed the
   variation in fecundity, measured as the probability of being pregnant,
   in 215 adult female deer Cervus elaphus culled on the Italian Alps, with
   respect to age, body mass, kidney fat, jaw length, lactation status,
   population size, temperature and precipitation in spring-summer,
   temperature and snow depth in winter, and the delayed effect of
   spring-summer temperature. We used random forest and logistic regression
   models to select variables whose direct effects best explained variation
   in fecundity. Path analysis was used to test for alternative hypotheses
   of direct/indirect effects between pre-selected weather (spring-summer
   temperature) and individual (age, kidney fat index {[}KFI]) predictors.
   The most important direct predictors of fecundity were age, kidney fat,
   and the interaction between kidney fat and spring-summer temperature.
   Path analysis supported the hypothesis that higher spring-summer
   temperature had negative, indirect effects on the probability of being
   pregnant, mediated by decreasing values of KFI. Our study revealed some
   complex, cause-effect relationships between weather stochasticity, body
   condition, and reproduction, possibly suggesting a conditional trade-off
   between opportunity for reproduction and survival, and emphasizing how
   environmental variations and individual characteristics may interact to
   shape life-history traits in ungulate populations.},

Abstract = {Cases of intentional animal poisonings are still widespread in Italy,
   even if the improper or malicious use of poisoned baits is banned. This
   represents a serious threat to pets as well as wildlife species, but
   also an environmental and human health concern. A retrospective study
   was performed based on baits sent for toxicological analysis to the
   laboratories of Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale del Mezzogiorno
   (IZSM) in Southern Italy over a five year period. Analyses were carried
   out by using different analytical techniques in relation to the
   toxicants. Results show a trend different from other countries, as well
   as from that reported for Northern Italy. The molluscicide metaldehyde
   proved to be the most common substance detected in our laboratory
   (63.9\%) followed by organochlorine insecticides (29.2\%),
   organophosphine insecticides (11.1\%) and anticoagulant rodenticides
   (9.7\%). Other rodenticides, such as strychnine and zinc phosphide were
   detected only one time in baits. Among the organochlorine insecticide,
   endosulfan (both alpha and beta isomers) occurred as the main poisoning
   agent. The incidence of poisoning cases detected in the present survey
   is extremely alarming and pointed out that actions have to be made to
   reduce this illegal practice and its environmental impact. (c) 2018

Title = {Comparative evaluation of immune responses of swine in PRRS-stable and

Abstract = {Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) is an elusive model
   of host/virus relationship in which disease is determined by virus
   pathogenicity, pig breed susceptibility and phenotype, microbial
   infectious pressure and environmental conditions. Successful disease
   control in PRRS-endemic Countries corresponds to ``stability{''}, i.e. a
   condition with no clinical signs of PRRS in the breeding-herd population
   and no viremia in weaning-age pigs. The aim of this work was to compare
   the profile and time-course of humoral and cell-mediated immunity in
   stable and unstable herds, respectively. In particular, we investigated
   PRRS virus (PRRSV) in serum and group oral fluid samples by Real-time
   RT-PCR, PRRSV-specific IgA and IgG in oral fluids, serum IgG antibody
   and the cell-mediated response (PRRSV-specific release of
   interferon-gamma) in whole blood samples. These parameters were measured
   in order to identify possible discrepancies in the development and
   kinetics of the immune response against PRRSV. PRRS-free gilts got
   regularly infected after entering PRRS-stable and unstable farms. In an
   open cycle, unstable pig farm PRRSV infection could be demonstrated in
   all groups of pigs, including suckling piglets. Four main results should
   be highlighted: A) the precocity of the Ab response in group oral fluids
   was generally similar to that recorded in sera; B) circulation of PRRSV
   was consistently detected in all age groups in the unstable herds, as
   opposed to the stable ones; C) an early, balanced, IgA and IgG response
   in oral fluids was only observed in the stable herds; D) an early
   IFN-gamma response after PRRSV infection was often observed in stable
   herds, as opposed to the unstable ones. These were characterized by
   IFN-gamma responses in piglets, likely due to transfer of maternal
   immunity. Most important, the mucosal IgA response was associated with
   cessation of virus excretion in oral fluid samples of PRRS-unstable
   herds. The above findings indicate that a peculiar profile of immune
   response to PRRSV can be found in PRRS-stable herds. Therefore, the
   outlined immune parameters can represent a useful readout system to
   evaluate successful adaptation to PRRSV based on acclimatization of
   breeding animals and management of pig flow.},

Abstract = {Objectives: KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) represent a
   serious problem worldwide. Herein, we describe the evolution of
   ceftazidime/avibactam resistance by sequencing longitudinal clinical
   isolates from a patient with KPC-Kp bloodstream infection undergoing
   ceftazidime/avibactam treatment.
   Methods: WGS was performed on one ceftazidime/avibactam-susceptible
   KPC-Kp (BOT-CA-S) and two phenotypically different
   ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant KPC-Kp with low (BOT-CA-R) and high
   (BOT-EMO) carbapenem MICs. The population diversity was assessed by the
   frequency of allele mutations and population analysis profiles (PAPs).
   Results: Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated clonal relatedness of the
   KPC-Kp isolates, all belonging to the clone ST1519. The D179Y mutation
   in blaKPC-3 was detected in both of the ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant
   KPC-Kp, whereas it was absent in the ceftazidime/avibactam-susceptible
   isolate. The mutation emerged independently in the two
   ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant isolates and was associated with a
   significant reduction in carbapenem MICs in BOT-CA-R, but not in
   BOT-EMO. WGS analysis revealed that the frequency of the D179Y mutation
   was 96.32\% and 51.05\% in BOT-CA-R and BOT-EMO, respectively. PAP
   results demonstrated that carbapenem resistance in BOT-EMO was due to
   the coexistence of mixed subpopulations harbouring WT and mutated
   blaKPC-3. A bacterial subpopulation with high ceftazidime/avibactam
   resistance for BOT-EMO KPC-Kp showed low carbapenem MICs, whereas a
   subpopulation with highmeropenem resistance had a low MIC of
   ceftazidime/ avibactam.
   Conclusions: Our analysis indicates that mixed subpopulations of
   ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant KPC-Kp emerge after
   ceftazidime/avibactam treatment. The evolution of different
   subpopulations that are highly resistant to ceftazidime/avibactam likely
   contributes to treatment failure, thereby highlighting the need for
   combination treatment strategies to limit selection of
   ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant KPC-Kp subpopulations.},

Abstract = {Small Ruminant Lentivirus (SRLV) subtype El, also known as Roccaverano
   strain, is considered a low pathogenic virus on the basis of natural
   genetic deletions, in vitro properties and on-farm observations. In
   order to gain more knowledge on this atypical lentivirus we investigated
   the in vivo tropism of Roccaverano strain in both, experimentally and
   naturally infected goats. Antibody responses were monitored as well as
   tissue distribution and viral load, evaluated by real time PCR on single
   spliced (gag/env) and multiple spliced (rev) RNA targets respectively,
   that were compared to histopathological lesions. Lymph nodes, spleen,
   alveolar macrophages and mammary gland turned out to be the main tissue
   reservoirs of genotype El-provirus. Moreover, mammary gland and/or
   mammary lymph nodes acted as active replication sites in dairy goats,
   supporting the lactogenic transmission of this virus. Notably, a direct
   association between viral load and concomitant infection or inflammatory
   processes was evident within organs such as spleen, lung and testis.
   Our results validate the low pathogenicity designation of SRLV genotype
   E1 in vivo, and confirm the monocyte-macrophage cell lineage as the main
   virus reservoir of this genotype. Accordingly, SRLV genotype E displays
   a tropism towards all tissues characterized by an abundant presence of
   these cells, either for their own anatomical structure or for an
   occasional infectious/inflammatory status.},

Abstract = {Background: Curative surgery of synchronous peritoneal metastases (PM)
   and colorectal liver metastases (LM) has been recently investigated as
   feasible option. When synchronous peritoneal and liver resection is not
   achievable, the sequence of the surgery remains unknown. Our hypothesis
   was that liver resection (LR) promotes peritoneal growth resulting in a
   non-resectable PM. We sought to analyse the effects of major LR and
   liver regeneration after hepatectomy in a murine model of PM and the
   associated angiogenesis.
   Methods: Murine model of colorectal PM in Balb/C mice was developed by
   intraperitoneal injection of different CT-26 tumour cell concentrations.
   Five days after the injection, mice were randomized into three groups:
   68\% hepatectomy group, sham laparotomy and control group without
   surgery. On postoperative days 1, 5 and 20, PM was evaluated
   macroscopically, tumour growth and liver regeneration by
   immunohistochemistry, and angiogenesis by immunofluorescence.
   Circulating progenitor cells, plasmatic cytokines and digestive arterial
   blood flow velocity measurements were also analysed.
   Results: Reproducible murine model of limited colorectal PM was
   obtained. Surgery induced PM increases and promoted neo-angiogenesis.
   Major hepatectomy influence the tumour growth in the late phase after
   surgery, the extent of extra-peritoneal metastasis and the increase of
   Ki-67 expression in the remnant liver.
   Conclusions: This animal model confirms the pro-tumoural and
   pro-angiogenic role of surgery, laparotomy and major LR, which promotes
   the increase of angiogenic factors and their participation in PM growth.
   These results suggest that peritoneal resection should be first step in
   the case of two-step liver and peritoneal surgery for patients with
   colorectal PM and LM. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd, BASO similar to The

Title = {National surveillance plan for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR)
   in autochthonous Italian cattle breeds: Results of first year of
   activity},

Abstract = {Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR)/infectious pustular
   vulvovaginitis (IPV) caused by Bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) is a
   significant disease in domestic and wild cattle. In June 2015, the
   Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry in Italy approved a national
   surveillance plan to control and eradicate IBR in beef cattle breeds.
   The objective of this study was to evaluate the results of the first
   year of the IBR voluntary surveillance plan in Italy. The aim of the
   plan is to eradicate IBR in all bovines recorded in the National Herd
   Book for Italian beef cattle breeds over six years. Monetary incentives
   are used to encourage breeders to achieve the annual seroprevalence
   ranges stated in the plan. A Ministerial decree states that all bovines
   in breeding herds and aged older than 12 months should be serologically
   tested. Serum samples were tested for presence of the antibody to
   glycoprotein E of BoHV-1 using commercially available enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assays. The national herd seroprevalence was 55.49\% (95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI] 52.01-58.92). Of 25,121 bovines tested for
   antibodies against BoHV-1, 8014 were positive. The seroprevalence in
   animals from autochthonous Italian cattle breeds was 31.89\% (95\% CI
   31.31-32.47). Seroprevalence was highest in Podolica cattle (55.14\%;
   95\% CI 54.07-56.21), lowest in Maremmana cattle (9.95\%; 95\% CI
   7.99-12.31), and intermediate in Chianina (22.01\%; 95\% CI
   21.03-23.01), Marchigiana (24.85\%; 95\% CI 23.52-26.23), and Romagnola
   (15.60\%; 95\% CI 14.62-16.64) cattle. These seroprevalence rates
   indicate a need for intervention to decrease the inevitable severe
   economic losses arising from BoHV-1 infection. Although some regions in
   Italy have a long history of combatting BoHV-1 infection, only the
   province of Bolzano has eradicated IBR.},

Abstract = {Protothecal mastitis poses an emergent animal health problem in dairy
   herds, with a high impact on dairy industries, causing heavy economic
   losses. Current methods of treating protothecal infections are
   ineffective, and no drug is licensed for use in cattle. The aim of the
   present study was to check the antialgal activity of 30 chemically
   defined essential oils (EOs) against Prototheca zopfii and Prototheca
   blaschkeae isolated from the milk of dairy cows with mastitis. A
   microdilution test was carried out to estimate the antialgal
   effectiveness of the selected chemically defined EOs. The microdilution
   test showed different degrees of inhibition among the examined
   Prototheca species. The activity of some of the examined EOs seem
   interesting. In particular, Citrus paradisi yielded the lowest minimal
   inhibitory concentration values (0.75\%) for both algal species. P.
   zopfii appeared to be more sensitive to EOs in comparison to P.
   blaschkeae. The present study investigated the in vitro susceptibility
   of P. zopfii and P. blaschkeae to a wide range of EOs, obtained from
   different botanical families. Further investigations are necessary to
   evaluate the efficacy of EO-based formulations intended for the
   disinfection of both udder and milking products.},

Abstract = {A study was conducted to investigate the seroprevalence and associated
   risk factors of Chlamydia abortus infection in cattle and some selected
   wildlife species at selected interface areas at the periphery of the
   Great Limpopo Transfrontier Conservation Area in Zimbabwe. Three study
   sites were selected based on the type of livestock-wildlife interface,
   porous livestock-wildlife interface (unrestricted), non-porous
   livestock-wildlife interface (restricted by fencing), and
   livestock-wildlife non-interface (totally absent or control). Sera were
   collected from cattle aged ae<yen> 2 years representing both female and
   intact male. Sera were also collected from selected wild ungulates from
   Mabalauta (porous interface) and Chipinda Pools (non-interface) areas of
   the Gonarezhou National Park. Sera were tested for antibodies to
   Chlamydia abortus using a CFT. A X (2) test was used to assess
   differences between categories and p < 0.05 was considered as
   significant. In cattle, the overall seroprevalence was 32.7\% (327/1011;
   95\% CI 29.5-35.3). A significantly lower seroprevalence was recorded
   for the porous interface (24.2\%) compared to the non-porous (42.5\%) (p
   < 0.0001) and the non-interface (36.2\%) (p = 0.001). Overall, the wet
   season recorded a significantly (p = 0.015) higher seroprevalence than
   the dry season. In wildlife, antibodies were detected in buffaloes
   (47.7\%) and impalas (43.8\%) but not in kudus. Buffaloes from Chipinda
   Pools (53.4\%) had a significantly (p = 0.036) higher seroprevalence
   than those from Mabalauta (26.1\%). The results established the presence
   of chlamydiosis in cattle and selected wildlife and that independent
   infections may be maintained in buffalo populations. Further studies are
   required to clarify chlamydiae circulating between cattle and wildlife.},

Title = {Effect of consecutive re-synchronization protocols on pregnancy rate in
   buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) heifers out of the breeding season},
Journal = {THERIOGENOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {113},
Pages = {120-126},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The combined effect of six consecutive timed artificial inseminations
   (TAIs) on pregnancy rates, following two different synchronization
   protocols on buffalo heifers, over a period of seven months typically
   characterized by low breeding performances, were investigated in this
   study. A total of 2189 TAIs were performed on 1463 buffalo heifers
   within a large buffalo farm in the south of Italy. Individual animals
   were allowed to undergo synchronization protocol (either a slightly
   modified Ovsynch or Progesterone treatment) and TAI until establishment
   of pregnancy or else for not more than six consecutive times. Semen of
   seven proven bulls was used throughout the study, which was carried out
   from March to September of the same year. Therefore, other than the
   effect given by consecutive TAIs over time, a monthly and a seasonal
   effect could also be tested, once the entire period was split into a Low
   Breeding Season (LBS) from March to June, and a Transition to Breeding
   Season (TBS) from July to September. From the data recorded in this
   study and the statistical analysis performed, it can be stated that the
   two protocols for the synchronization of ovulation were similar in
   efficiency in determining pregnancies with an overall fertility rate of
   89.4\% when the comparison was run both on a monthly basis or when
   months were grouped into two different seasons. In addition, an average
   of 1.83 AI/pregnancy was reported, slightly higher for the Ovsynch when
   compared to the Progesterone protocol: 1.91 vs 1.70, respectively.
   Finally, when considering the number of progressive synchronization
   treatments implemented over time as covariate, neither Ovsynch nor
   Progesterone treatment significantly affected pregnancy rates following
   the first of the six synchronization sessions. However, repeating the
   synchronization procedure, the progesterone based protocol resulted in
   significantly higher probability of success in terms of established
   pregnancies during the second and third re-synchronization sessions. (C)

Abstract = {Toxigenic and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and genetic

   isolated from seafood and marine water of the Adriatic sea, Italy, and 9
   clinical strains, two of which with seawater of the Adriatic as the
   source of infection, were studied. All strains had hlyA El Tor gene but
   lacked ctxA gene. Four and two isolates, respectively, also had stn/sto
   and tcpA Class genes. More than 90\% of strains showed susceptibility to
   cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, cloramphenicol, tetracycline, trimethoprim
   thorn sulfamethoxazole and intermediate or full resistance to
   tetracycline and erythromycin. Six strains of seafood and clinical
   source were multi-drug resistant. PFGE analysis allowed to type all the
   strains with 50 banding patterns. Twenty-one strains, 11 and 8 from
   seafood and seawater, respectively, and 2 of clinical origin, were
   grouped into 9 different clusters. We report the presence of toxigenic
   and multidrug resistant non-O1/O139 V. cholerae strains in Adriatic,
   some of which genetically related, and support that they represent a
   potential reservoir of toxin and antibiotic resistance genes. (c) 2017

Abstract = {Cd bioaccumulation was investigated in the most consumed rice varieties
   (Oryza saliva L.) in Italy to assess the health risk related to
   consumption of the cereal for Italian population. In addition, the
   health implications concerning to consumption of rice-based foods was
   evaluated for Italian infants. Cadmium was detected by QICP-MS. Method
   was validated in compliance with UNI CEI EN ISO/IEC 17025. Cd
   concentrations were found below the Maximum Levels (MLs) established at
   the European Union level for rice (0.092 mg kg(-1) for brown rice and
   0.062 mg kg(-1) for white rice). The Cd Estimated Weekly Intakes (EWIs)
   through brown rice and white rice consumption by total population
   accounted approximately for 6\% and 4\% of the TWI set by the European
   Food Safety Authority (2.5 pg kg(-1) body weight), respectively. The Cd
   EWIs through rice consumption by different population groups obtained in
   this survey did not show notable differences with those related to the
   total population except for child group that showed the highest EWIs of
   Cd. As regards to the Cd EWIs quantified for infants of four, six and
   eight month old considering the rice-based infant food consumption
   accounted for 22\%, 38\%, and 36\% of the EFSA TWI, respectively.},

Abstract = {Considering the importance of honey bees for pollination activity and
   biodiversity preservation different studies have dealt with the impact
   of pesticides on honeybee health. Within the hive, beeswax is a matrix
   of particular interest because most of the chemicals used in
   agricultural and beekeeping activities can easily accumulate and persist
   in this matrix long after treatment has ceased, affecting honeybees
   survival. However, chemical analyses of pesticide residues in beeswax
   are not mandatory, so there are no residue limits, for beeswax. The
   present study was carried outwith the aim of investigating the beeswax
   residue pattern in the Italian hives. 178 beeswax samples collected from
   2013 to 2015 were analyzed for 247 pesticides. 73.6\% of the analyzed
   samples reported the presence of one or more pesticides. On average
   every single sample showed a mean of three different pesticides each
   with a maximum of fourteen compounds, some of which were banned in
   Europe or not authorized in Italy. The higher frequencies were
   associated with three acaricides: coumaphos (60.7\% of samples),
   taufluvalinate (50\%) and chlorphenvinphos (35.4\%), but the higher
   concentrations were associated to pyrethrins and piperonil butoxide. (c)

Abstract = {BACKGROUNDAedes albopictus has spread during the last few decades all
   over the world. This has increased significantly the risk of exotic
   arbovirus transmission (e.g. chikungunya, dengue, and Zika) also in
   temperate areas, as demonstrated by the Chikungunya 2007 and 2017
   outbreaks in northeastern and central Italy. Insecticides are an
   important tool for limiting the circulation of these mosquito-borne
   viruses. The aim of the present study was to address the gap in current
   knowledge of pyrethroid insecticide resistance of European Ae.
   albopictus populations, focusing on populations from Italy, Albania and
   Greece.
   RESULTSBioassays for resistance to permethrin (0.75\%), -cypermethrin
   (0.05\%) or deltamethrin (0.05\%) were performed according to World
   Health Organization (WHO) protocols and showed reduced susceptibility
   (<90\% mortality) of some Italian populations to permethrin and
   -cypermethrin, but not to deltamethrin.
   CONCLUSIONThis study reports the first evidence of resistance to
   pyrethroids in adult Italian Ae. albopictus populations. Results refer
   to the season preceding the Chikungunya 2017 outbreak in central Italy
   and highlight the need to increase efforts to monitor the spread of
   insecticide resistance and the need to develop strategies to limit the
   spread of insecticide resistance, particularly in areas where extensive
   treatments have been carried out to contain disease outbreaks. (c) 2017

Abstract = {Herein, we examined the brain of adult ewes and lambs less than 30 days

   in Sardinia (Italy). Gross anatomo-pathological examination of all
   brains of the animals revealed multiple linear reddish-yellow foci of
   necrotic purulent inflammation due to oncosphere migration.
   Histologically, we confirmed a multifocal pyo-granulomatous
   meningo-encephalitis both in ewes and in lambs, confirming acute
   coenurosis. Morphological examination and DNA sequencing identified the
   Taenia multiceps we isolated as Tm1 strain. This report describes for
   the first time a natural acute coenurosis infection in suckling lambs
   under 30 days of age.},

Abstract = {Leigh syndrome (LS) associated with cytochrome c oxidase (COX)
   deficiency is an early onset, fatal mitochondrial encephalopathy,
   leading to multiple neurological failure and eventually death, usually
   in the first decade of life. Mutations in SURF1, a nuclear gene encoding
   a mitochondrial protein involved in COX assembly, are among the most
   common causes of LS. LSSURF1 patients display severe, isolated COX
   deficiency in all tissues, including cultured fibroblasts and skeletal
   muscle. Recombinant, constitutive SURF-/- mice show diffuse COX
   deficiency, but fail to recapitulate the severity of the human clinical
   phenotype. Pigs are an attractive alternative model for human diseases,
   because of their size, as well as metabolic, physiological and genetic
   similarity to humans. Here, we determined the complete sequence of the
   swine SURF1 gene, disrupted it in pig primary fibroblast cell lines
   using both TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing systems, before finally
   generating SURF1(-/-) and SURF1(-/+) pigs by Somatic Cell Nuclear
   Transfer (SCNT). SURF1(-/-) pigs were characterized by failure to
   thrive, muscle weakness and highly reduced life span with elevated
   perinatal mortality, compared to heterozygous SURF1(-/+) and wild type
   littermates. Surprisingly, no obvious COX deficiency was detected in
   SURF1(-/-) tissues, although histochemical analysis revealed the
   presence of COX deficiency in jejunum villi and total mRNA sequencing
   (RNAseq) showed that several COX subunit-encoding genes were
   significantly down regulated in SURF1(-/-) skeletal muscles. In
   addition, neuropathological findings, indicated a delay in central
   nervous system development of newborn SURF1(-/-) piglets. Our results
   suggest a broader role of sSURF1 in mitochondrial bioenergetics.},

Title = {Antimicrobial susceptibility survey on bacterial agents of canine and

Abstract = {Objectives: This work characterised the antimicrobial susceptibility of
   uropathogens isolated from empirically treated dogs and cats.
   Within-household transmission of uropathogens can involve humans and
   companion animals. Knowledge on the prevalence and susceptibility
   pattern of isolates from canine and feline urine samples and the impact
   of prior antimicrobial treatment is important to prevent the
   dissemination of antimicrobial resistance.
   Methods: A retrospective study was conducted selecting
   antibiotic-treated companion animals. Urine samples were collected by
   cystocentesis and were submitted to an Italian diagnostic laboratory
   over a 2-year period (2013-2015). The antimicrobial susceptibility of
   the isolates was analysed both using Clinical and Laboratory Standards
   Institute (CLSI) guidelines and a formula to help select rational
   antimicrobial therapy.
   Results: Gram-negative bacteria were clearly prevalent. Gentamicin had
   the highest impact factors. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and doxycycline
   appeared to be the most effective compounds against Grampositive
   infections, whilst marbofloxacin may be a useful option against
   Gram-negative urinary tract infections (UTIs) as well as doxycycline and
   trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in cats and dogs, respectively. Consulting
   published studies, a comparable overall trend regarding bacterial
   species incriminated in canine and feline UTIs and their
   susceptibilities seems likely, despite different circumstances where the
   studies were conducted.
   Conclusions: Companion animals are potential reservoirs of
   drug-resistant uropathogens. Judicious use of antibiotics is necessary
   to maintain the efficacy of antimicrobials in human and veterinary
   medicine. Antimicrobial susceptibility monitoring programmes are
   therefore essential to facilitate the choice of antimicrobial agent that
   is most likely to be effective, particularly in cases of prior
   antimicrobial treatment. (C) 2018 International Society for Chemotherapy

Abstract = {Blood samples from 65 sheep were tested for the presence of bovine
   Deltapapillomavirus (PVs) DNA. The sheep were divided into three groups.
   Sheep in groups 1 and 2 were from Sardinia and Campania, respectively,
   and were in contact with cattle and grazed on lands contaminated with
   bracken fern. Sheep in Group 3 lived in closed pens and had no contact
   with cattle. These sheep were fed hay that did not contain bracken fern.
   Bovine PV E5 DNA was detected in blood from 24 of 27 (89\%) sheep in
   Group 1. A single bovine PV type was detected in the blood from nine
   (33\%) sheep, including the detection of bovine PV-1 DNA in four sheep,
   bovine PV-2 in four and PV-13 in one sheep. Two PV types were detected
   in 33\% of the sheep, and three bovine PV types were detected in 22\% of
   the sheep. Bovine PVs were detected in 17 of 20 (85\%) sheep from Group
   2. The detection rate by a single PV type was 40\% with just PV-1 DNA
   amplified from two, just PV-2 DNA from four, and just PV-13 DNA from two
   sheep. Two and three PVs were detected in 30\% and 15\%, respectively.
   All sequenced amplicons showed a 100\% identity with papillomaviral E5
   DNA deposited in GenBank. Bovine PV-14 DNA sequences were not detected
   from any sheep. No bovine PV DNA was revealed in blood samples from
   sheep in Group 3. The detection of bovine PV DNA in the blood of sheep
   means that sheep may be able to be infected by these PVs. This suggests
   that bovine PVs could potentially be a previously unrecognized cause of
   disease in sheep. Furthermore, it is possible that sheep could act as a
   reservoir for these viruses.},

Abstract = {Intestinal and respiratory parasites are among the most common pathogens
   in dogs and some of them are recognized as zoonotic agents. In Italy,
   various taxa have been reported, with variable prevalence estimates
   depending on study area, dog category and coprological exam technique.
   In this paper, we report the results of six years of passive
   surveillance. In the period January 2006-December 2012, 2,775 dog faecal
   samples from Lazio Region (Central Italy), were examined for parasites,
   1,156 from household and 1,619 from shelter dogs, respectively. The
   following parasites were detected: Giardia duodenalis, Cystoisospora
   sp., Ancylostomatidae, Toxocara canis, Toxascaris leonina, Trichuris
   vulpis, Eucoleus bohmi, Eucoleus aerophilus, Mesocestoides sp.,
   Taeniidae and Dipylidium caninum. Helminths were more frequent than
   protozoa, with total prevalences of 29.1\% and 10.7\%, respectively. T.
   vulpis and Ancylostomatidae were the most common parasites, with
   prevalences of 9.9\% and 9.6\% respectively. T. vulpis and
   Ancylostomatidae were significantly more prevalent in shelter dogs than
   in household ones. T. canis and Cystoisospora sp. were significantly
   more frequent in household dogs.
   The assessment of the prevalence in sheltered and in household dogs is
   useful to infer the occurrence of different parasites in the origin
   population and to plan possible control intervention.},

Title = {A Baseline Study of the Occurrence of Rare Earth Elements in Animal Feed},
Journal = {WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {229},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The concentrations of rare earth elements (REEs) were determined by
   ICP-MS in feed for farm animals in three regions of Northwestern Italy.
   This is the first study aimed at defining the levels and patterns of
   REEs in feed for different animal species. REEs are in fact emerging as
   contaminants worldwide, following their applications in industry,
   technology, medicine, and agriculture. Moreover, in 2016, the first
   REE-based feed additive-a zootechnical additive for weaned piglets-was
   authorized in the EU. Therefore, information about the natural content
   of REEs in animal feed of vegetal origin is required to evaluate the
   potential use of REEs as a growth promoter. There was a high variability
   in the REEs content of the animal feed in three different Italian
   regions, and REEs content varied according to the different animal
   species for which the feed was intended. Concentrations of light REE
   (LREE) were higher than those of heavy REE (HREE) in each feed typology.
   Raw materials were shown to have higher I REE pound concentrations (mean
   concentration 2.4 mg kg(-1)) than complete or complementary feed.
   Considering the animal species, mean I REE pound concentrations were as
   follows: horse feed (2.7 mg kg(-1)) > poultry feed > bovine feed > swine
   feed (0.61 mg kg(-1)). REE levels in feed were in line with values
   available in the literature on vegetables; thus, REE concentrations in
   feed do not constitute a concern for animal health.},

Title = {Taurine Supplementation Alleviates Puromycin Aminonucleoside Damage by
   Modulating Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Mitochondrial-Related
   Apoptosis in Rat Kidney},
Journal = {NUTRIENTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Taurine (TAU) is a sulfur-containing beta amino acid that is not
   involved in protein composition and anabolism, conditionally essential
   in mammals provided through diet. Growing evidence supports a protective
   role of TAU supply in osmoregulation, calcium flux, and reduction of
   inflammation and oxidant damage in renal diseases like diabetes.
   Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, due to abnormal proteostasis, is a
   contributor to nephrotic syndrome and related renal damage. Here, we
   investigated the effect of dietary TAU (1.5\% in drinking water for 15
   days) in an established rat model that mimics human minimal change
   nephrosis, consisting of a single puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)
   injection (intraperitoneally 15 mg/100 g body weight), with sacrifice
   after eight days. TAU limited proteinuria and podocytes foot processes
   effacement, and balanced slit diaphragm nephrin and glomerular claudin 1
   expressions. In cortical proximal tubules, TAU improved lysosomal
   density, ER perimeter, restored proper ER-mitochondria tethering and
   mitochondrial cristae, and decreased inflammation. Remarkably, TAU
   downregulated glomerular ER stress markers (GRP78, GRP94), pro-apoptotic
   C/EBP homologous protein, activated caspase 3, tubular caspase1, and
   mitochondrial chaperone GRP75, but maintained anti-apoptotic HSP25. In
   conclusion, TAU, by targeting upstream ER stress separate from
   mitochondria dysfunctions at crucial renal sites, might be a promising
   dietary supplement in the treatment of the drug-resistant nephrotic
   syndrome.},

Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Background: As the epidemiology of human Q Fever generally reflects the
   spread of Coxiella burnetii in ruminant livestock, molecular
   characterization of strains is essential to prevent human outbreaks. In
   this study we report the genetic diversity of C. burnetii in central
   Italy accomplished by MST and MLVA-6 on biological samples from 20 goat,
   sheep and cow farms.
   Results: Five MST and ten MLVA profiles emerged from the analysis
   establishing a part of C. burnetii strain world atlas. In particular,
   ST32 occurred on 12 farms (60\%), prevalently in goat specimens, while
   ST12 (25\%) was detected on 4 sheep and 1 goat samples. ST8 and a
   variant of this genotype were described on 2 different sheep farms,
   whereas ST55 was observed on a goat farm. Five complete MLVA profiles
   different from any other published genotypes were described in this
   study in addition to 15 MLVA incomplete panels. Despite this,
   polymorphic markers Ms23, Ms24 and Ms33 enabled the identification of
   samples sharing the same MST profile.
   Conclusions: Integration of such data in international databases can be
   of further help in the attempt of building a global phylogeny and
   epidemiology of Q fever in animals, with a ``One Health{''} perspective.},

Abstract = {Monitoring of small ruminants for transmissible spongiform
   encephalopathies (TSEs) has recently become more relevant after two
   natural scrapie suspected cases of goats were found to be positive for
   classical BSE (C-BSE). C-BSE probably established itself in this species
   unrecognized, undermining disease control measures. This opens the
   possibility that TSEs in goats may remain an animal source for human
   prion diseases. Currently, there are no data regarding the natural
   presence of the atypical BSE in caprines. Here we report that C-BSE and
   L-type atypical BSE (L-BSE) isolates from bovine species are
   intracerebrally transmissible to goats, with a 100\% attack rate and a
   significantly shorter incubation period and survival time after C-BSE
   than after L-BSE experimental infection, suggesting a lower species
   barrier for classical agentin goat. All animals showed nearly the same
   clinical features of disease characterized by skin lesions, including
   broken hair and alopecia, and abnormal mental status. Histology and
   immunohistochemistry showed several differences between C-BSE and L-BSE
   infection, allowing discrimination between the two different strains.
   The lymphoreticular involvement we observed in the C-BSE positive goats
   argues in favour of a peripheral distribution of PrPSc similar to
   classical scrapie. Western blot and other currently approved screening
   tests detected both strains in the goats and were able to classify
   negative control animals. These data demonstrate that active
   surveillance of small ruminants, as applied to fallen stock and/or
   healthy slaughter populations in European countries, is able to
   correctly identify and classify classical and L-BSE and ultimately
   protect public health.},

Title = {Leishmania Infection Induces MicroRNA hsa-miR-346 in Human Cell

Abstract = {Leishmaniasis is an anthropo-zoonotic disease caused by various
   Leishmania species. The clinical manifestations of the disease vary
   according to the species and host characteristics. Leishmania infection
   leads to subversion/modulation of the host's innate immune response and
   cellular metabolic pathways. In the last years, it has been shown that
   many host cell gene expression and signaling pathways are targeted by
   Leishmania to subvert host defenses (e.g., oxidative damage, immune
   activation, antigen presentation, apoptosis) and allow parasite survival
   and replication. However, the molecular mechanisms triggered by the
   parasite are not fully elucidated. The role of miRNA has recently been
   evaluated in human or murine macrophages infected with Leishmania
   (Leishmania) major, L. (L.) donovani or L. (L.) amazonensis. However, no
   literature exists regarding miRNA dysregulation in host cells infected
   with L. (L.) infantum or L. (Viannia) species. Since we previously
   showed that L. (L.) infantum infection induced unfolded protein response
   (UPR) in macrophages, we focused on miR-346, which has been shown to be
   induced by the UPR-activated transcription factor sXBP1 and has a
   potential role in the modulation of the immune response. Macrophages
   differentiated from U937 and/or THP-1 human monocytic cells were
   infected with four L. (L.) infantum strain/clinical isolates and one L.
   (V.) sp. clinical isolate. A significant upregulation of miR-346 (p <
   0.05) was observed in infections with all the Leishmania species tested.
   Moreover, RFX1 (a miR-346 predicted target gene) was found to be
   significantly downregulated (p < 0.05) after 48h infection, and miR-346
   was found to have a role in this downregulation. The induction of
   miR-346 in macrophages infected with L. (L.) infantum and L. (V.) sp.,
   reported here for the first time, could play a role in regulating
   macrophage functions since several MHC- or interferon-associated genes
   are among the targets of this miRNA. Hence, miR-346 could be considered
   an attractive anti-Leishmania drug target.},

Abstract = {Testudinid herpesviruses (TeHVs) have a worldwide distribution among
   tortoises. However, information such as risk factors promoting the
   occurrence or the recrudescence of the associated disease and the
   mid-term sequelae of an outbreak comprising the extent and dynamic of
   the viral shedding have been only minimally investigated. Critical
   management information is also lacking or anecdotal. Furthermore, major
   aspects of the viral pathogenesis including the likelihood of vertical
   transmission of the virus are virtually unknown. The present study
   describes the occurrence and the management of an outbreak of Testudinid
   herpesvirus genotype 3 (TeHV3) in a large, private collection of
   chelonians. Clinical, pathological, molecular and serological
   characterization of the outbreak were carried out. Seventy-five percent
   of the infected tortoises died. Complementation of molecular and
   serological testing was a critical point for successful management
   implementations. A case-control study was performed to analyze possible
   risk factors associated with the infection. Furthermore, a subgroup of
   six asymptomatic infected tortoises was monitored for two consecutive
   seasons after the outbreak: all the infected tortoises were determined
   to be intermittent shedders, except one, which was a persistent shedder.
   Post-hibernation was associated with the highest number of shedders.
   Finally, evidence of the most likely vertical transmission of the virus
   was obtained for the first time.},

Abstract = {Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato is a zoonotic agent with a life cycle
   consisting of definitive hosts (dogs and wild carnivores), and
   intermediate hosts (usually ungulates). Other animals and humans may
   accidentally ingest eggs and contract cystic echinococcosis, acting as
   aberrant hosts. A 3-year-old neutered female cat was brought to a
   veterinary practice in Sassari (Italy) with abdominal distension.
   Ultrasound showed multiple intraperitoneal vesicles, which on laparotomy
   were found to be metacestodes of E. granulosus. Videos of the extraction
   of cysts are provided. Phylogenetic analysis based on a fragment of the
   cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) mitochondrial gene identified the
   isolate as E. granulosus sensu stricto genotype G1, the most common
   genotype circulating in Europe and the Mediterranean basin. This is the
   first case report of cystic echinococcosis in domestic cats from Italy.},

Abstract = {During 2014-2015, 300 pig carcasses before chilling and 85 food contact
   surfaces (FCSs) at cutting lines were tested for Salmonella in three
   slaughterhouses (namely A, B, and C) of northern Italy. In
   slaughterhouses A and B, four carcass sites of 100cm(2) each (from both
   the exterior and interior side) were swabbed with a single sponge. In
   abattoir C, four 100cm(2) sites of the exterior and the interior sides
   were swabbed with two independent sponges. The population average
   prevalence of Salmonella-positive carcasses (which takes into account
   the structure of the study design, with multiple samples collected in a
   single day) in slaughterhouses A and B was 12.3\%, while in
   slaughterhouse C it was 11.2\%. Presence of Salmonella on exterior and
   interior sides of carcasses showed a low level of concordance (only 3/12
   of the contaminated carcasses were positive on both sides). No
   significant difference was found for FCSs contamination in the three
   slaughterhouses, with a population average prevalence of
   Salmonella-positive FCSs of 19.9\%. In addition, we found that the
   clustering due to the day of sampling account for more than 36\% and
   60\% of the overall prevalence variation on carcasses and FCSs,
   respectively. Eight serovars were identified, with Salmonella Derby as
   the most common type. The counting of Salmonella on carcasses showed
   large variability. It was low (<0.0075 most probable number
   {[}MPN]/cm(2)) in 46.6\% of the carcasses and as high as 2.7 MPN/cm(2)
   in 4.7\%. Specifically, we found that counts on carcasses fit with heavy
   tailed distributions (lognormal and Weibull with a small shape
   parameter), suggesting not negligible probability of episodes of high
   Salmonella contamination. The mean values of contamination obtained with
   the two distributions ranged from 0.235 to 0.435 MPN/cm(2).},

Abstract = {Tenebrio molltor represents one of the most popular species used for the
   large-scale conversion of plant biomass into protein and is
   characterized by high nutritional value. In the present laboratory
   study, the bacterial biota characterizing a pilot production chain of
   fresh T. molitor larvae was investigated. To this end, different batches
   of fresh mealworm larvae, their feeding substrate (wheatmeal) and frass
   were analyzed by viable microbial counts, PCR-DGGE and alumina
   sequencing. Moreover, the occurrence of Coxiella burnetii, Pseudonwnas
   aeruginosa and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) was assessed through
   qualitative real-time PCR assays. Microbial viable counts highlighted
   low microbial contamination of the wheatmeal, whereas larvae and frass
   were characterized by high loads of Enterobacteriaceae, lactic acid
   bacteria, and several species of mesophilic aerobes. Spore-forming
   bacteria were detected to a lesser extent in all the samples. The
   combined molecular approach used to profile the microbiota confirmed the
   low microbial contamination of wheatmeal and allowed the detection of
   Enterobacter spp., Erwinia spp., Enterococcus spp. and Lactococcus app.
   as dominant genera in both larvae and frass. Moreover, Kiebsiella spp.,
   Pantoea spp., and Xenorhabdus spp. were found to be in the minority.
   Entomoplasmatales (including Spiroplasma spp.) constituted a major
   fraction of the microbiota of one batch of larvae. From the real-time
   PCR assays, no sample was positive for either C. burnetii or STEC,
   whereas P. aerughtosa was detected in one sample of frass. Based on the
   overall results, two sources of microbial contamination were
   hypothesized, namely feeding with wheatmeal and vertical transmission of
   microorganisms from mother to offspring. Since mealworms are expected to
   be eaten as a whole, the overall outcomes collected in this laboratory
   study discourage the consumption of fresh mealworm larvae. Moreover,
   microbial loads and the absence of potential pathogens known to be
   associated with this insect species should be carefully assessed in
   order to reduce the minimum risk for consumers, by identifying the most
   opportune processing methods (e.g., boiling, frying, drying, etc.).},

Abstract = {The surveillance activities for abnormal bivalve mortality events in
   Italy include the diagnosis of ostreid herpesvirus type 1 (OsHV-1) in
   symptomatic oysters. OsHV-1-positive oysters (Crassostrea gigas) were
   used as a source for in vivo virus propagation and a virus-rich sample
   was selected to perform shotgun sequencing based on Illumina technology.
   Starting from this unpurified supernatant sample from gills and mantle,
   we generated 3.5 million reads (2x300 bp) and de novo assembled the
   whole genome of an Italian OsHV-1 microvariant (OsHV-1-PT). The
   OsHV-1-PT genome encodes 125 putative ORFs, 7 of which had not
   previously been predicted in other sequenced Malacoherpesviridae.
   Overall, OsHV-1-PT displays typical microvariant OsHV-1 genome features,
   while few polymorphisms (0.08 \%) determine its uniqueness. As little is
   known about the genetic determinants of OsHV-1 virulence, comparing
   complete OsHV-1 genomes supports a better understanding of the virus
   pathogenicity and provides new insights into virus-host interactions.},

Abstract = {Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella Typhimurium) and its
   monophasic variant (Salmonella 4,{[}5],12 i:-) are the major causes of
   gastroenteritis in both humans and animals. Pulsed-field gel
   electrophoresis and multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis
   have been used widely as subtyping methods for these pathogens in
   molecular epidemiological analyses, but the results do not precisely
   reflect phylogenetic information. In this study, we performed a
   phylogenetic analysis of these serovars using whole-genome sequencing
   data and identified nine distinct genotypic clades. Then, we established
   an allele-specific PCR-based genotyping method detecting a
   clade-specific single nucleotide polymorphism to rapidly identify the
   clade of each isolate. Among a total of 815 isolates obtained from
   cattle in Japan between 1977 and 2017, clades 1, 7, and 9 contained 77\%
   of isolates. Obvious replacement of the dominant clone was observed five
   times in this period, and clade 9, which mostly contains Salmonella
   4,{[}5],12:i:-, is currently dominant. Among 140 isolates obtained from
   swine in Japan between 1976 and 2017, clades 3 and 9 contained 64\% of
   isolates. Clade 9 is the latest clone as is the case in cattle isolates.
   Clade 9 is similar to an epidemic clone from Europe, which is
   characterized by sequence type 34 (ST34), chromosomal Salmonella genomic
   island 3, and a composite transposon containing antimicrobial resistance
   genes. The increased prevalence of clade 9 among food animals in Japan
   might be a part of the pandemic of the European Salmonella 4,{[}5],12:i:

Abstract = {Livestock and food products of animal origin constitute important
   reservoirs of intestinal and extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coil
   including antibiotic-resistant E. coli isolates. To assess potential
   risks to public health related to E. coil strains of animal origin in
   Tunisia, 65 E. coli isolates recovered from healthy animals and food
   products of animal origin were studied. Antimicrobial susceptibility was
   determined according to CLSI guidelines and genes encoding antibiotic
   resistance as well as virulence factors were investigated by PCR. High
   rates of antibiotic resistance were observed to kanamycin (78.4\%),
   gentamicin (75.3\%) and streptomycin (75.3\%, encoded by strA-strB (7
   isolates)), amoxicillin (64.6\%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (60\%),
   tetracycline (44.6\%; tetA (8 isolates) and tetB (7 isolates)),
   nalidixic acid (27.6\%, qnrS (3 isolates), qnrB (2 isolates) and qnrA
   (one isolate)) and sulfonamides (36.9\%; sull (1 isolate), sul2 (4
   isolates), and sul3 (1 isolate)). Virulotypes classified some isolates
   as STEC (3\%), MNEC (1.5\%) and atypical EPEC (1.5\%). This study
   demonstrated high rates of antimicrobial resistance and the presence of
   some pathogenic pathovars from animal origins that are a cause of
   concern for public health.},

Abstract = {Gall-bladder diseases are common in dogs and two-dimensional
   ultrasonography is a current standard method for diagnosis and treatment
   planning. However, findings from this modality can be nonspecific. The
   aim of this retrospective, case series study was to describe
   conventional and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (using SonoVue (R))
   findings in a group of dogs with histologically confirmed gall bladder
   disease. A total of 65 dogs were included. Branchlike, heterogeneous,
   and homogeneous contrast enhancement of echogenic intraluminal
   mass-forming lesions was a contrast-enhanced ultrasound characteristic
   of polypoid lesions due to cystic mucosal hyperplasia of the gallbladder
   and/or tumor, which had different wash-in and washout characteristics.
   In dogs with mobile or immobile biliary sludge or mucocele, the
   echogenic intraluminal masses remained unenhanced. A double rim mark or
   enhancement defect in the gallbladder wall was a characteristic of edema
   or necrosis/rupture of the wall, respectively. Conventional
   ultrasonography correctly identified biliary sludge or mucocele in 36/37
   dogs, cholecystitis/edema in 44/47 dogs, necrosis/rupture in 19/25 dogs,
   and gallbladder neoplasia in three of three dogs with these pathologies.
   It falsely identified biliary sludge or mucocele in eight of 28 dogs,
   cholecystitis/edema in three of 15 dogs, necrosis/rupture in 13/37 dogs,
   and gall-bladder neoplasia in 20/59 dogs that did not have these
   pathologies. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound correctly identified
   cholecystitis/edema in 42/47 dogs, but falsely identified
   cholecystitis/edema in three of 18 dogs. It correctly identified
   necrosis/rupture, benign polypoid lesions, and gallbladder neoplasia in
   all dogs with no false-positive results. Findings supported
   contrast-enhanced ultrasound as a complement to conventional
   ultrasonography for dogs with suspected gallbladder pathologies such as
   edema, necrosis, and rupture.},

Journal = {PHYTOPATHOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {108},
Number = {5},
Pages = {595-601},

Abstract = {Brown rot, caused by Monilinia spp., is a major disease of stone fruit
   and, in favorable environmental conditions and in the absence of
   fungicide treatments, it causes important economic losses. In the
   present work, we propose a modification of classical susceptible,
   exposed, infectious and removed compartmental models to grasp the
   peculiarities of the progression of brown rot epidemics in stone fruit
   orchards in the last stage of the fruit growth (i.e., from the end of
   the pit hardening to harvest time). Namely, we took into account (i) the
   lifespan of airborne spores; (ii) the dependence of the latent period on
   the cuticle crack surface area, which itself varies in time with fruit
   growth; (iii) the impossibility of recovery in infectious fruit; and
   (iv) the abrupt interruption of disease development by the elimination
   of the host fruit at harvest time. We parametrized the model by using
   field data from a peach Prunus persica orchard infected by Monilinia
   laxa and M. fructicola in Avignon (southern France). The basic
   reproduction number indicates that the environmental conditions met in
   the field were extremely favorable to disease development and the model
   closely fitted the temporal evolution of the fruit abundance in the
   different epidemiological compartments. The model permits us to
   highlight crucial mechanisms undergoing brown rot build up and to
   evaluate the consequences of different agricultural practices on the
   quantity and quality of the yield. We found that winter sanitation
   practices (which decrease the initial infection incidence) and the
   control of the fruit load (which affects the host bun density and the
   single fruit growth trajectory) can be effective in controlling brown
   rot in conjunction with or in place of fungicide treatments.},

Abstract = {Faro Lake is a coastal meromictic lagoon with singular characteristics
   in the Mediterranean (Messina, Sicily - Italy). It is part of the
   Natural Oriented Reserve of Capo Peloro (38 degrees 15 57 N; 15 degrees
   37 50 E). In this area, traditional mollusc farming activity persists,
   producing autochthonous' mussels. This study reports of the Mytilus
   galloprovincialis haemolymph chemical profile and water variables
   determination of 1 year-lasted survey (April 2016 - March 2017). The
   determinations of electrolytes (Na+, Cl-, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, P inorganic)
   and heavy metals in both Faro lake water and haemolymph have been
   carried out. Heavy metals are elements with high density and are quite
   toxic in low concentrations, such as Aluminum (Al), Arsenic (As), Cobalt
   (Co), Chrome (Cr), Copper (Cu), Iron (Fe), Magnesium (Mg), Manganese
   (Mn), Lead (Pb), Tin (Sn), Zinc (Zn). Heavy metals toxicity depends,
   principally, on bioaccumulation processes. M. galloprovincialis is a
   good bio-indicator, ideal for assess levels of environmental pollution
   thanks to its biological, ecological and physiological characteristics.
   The results of this study showed a typical fluctuation range in
   haemolymph and water parameters, related to the water ones;
   chemical-physical parameters affected the ions (electrolytes and metals)
   levels in some period of the year. The study reports the interactions
   between biotic (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and abiotic (water
   parameters) components of Faro Lake, and creates reference data for
   further future study on the same area or on similar ones.},

Abstract = {Corynebacterium ulcerans, an emerging pathogen related to C. diphtheriae
   and C. pseudotuberculosis, is able to cause disease in both human and
   animal hosts. C. ulcerans may harbor acquired virulence factors such as
   dermonecrotic exotoxin phospholipase D (PLD) and the prophage-encoded
   diphtheria toxin (DT). Infections typically occur in persons reporting
   close contact with animals. In pets, C. ulcerans has been isolated from
   both asymptomatic carriers and clinically affected dogs and cats. We
   describe the isolation and characterization of C. ulcerans strains from
   2 pet dogs with ulcerative lesions in Italy. The 2 isolates tested
   negative for both DT genes, but were PLD-producers and belonged to
   sequence types (STs) 325 and 339. These 2 cases highlight that C.
   ulcerans cutaneous infections might be underestimated in pets, given
   that many veterinary laboratories do not routinely consider and/or
   identify Corynebacterium species from cutaneous samples. Early detection
   and molecular typing of C. ulcerans is essential in order to implement
   effective treatment and to prevent diffusion and possible zoonotic
   transmission of certain STs.},

Abstract = {The effective control of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) requires
   sensitive, specific and rapid diagnostic tools. However, the control and
   eradication of FMD in Africa is complicated by, among other factors, the
   existence of five of the seven FMD virus (FMDV) serotypes, including the
   SAT-serotypes 1, 2 and 3 that are genetically and antigenically the most
   variable FMDV serotypes. A key diagnostic assay to enable a country to
   re-gain its FMD-free status and for FMD surveillance, is the 3ABC or the
   non-structural protein (NSP) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
   Although many kits are available to detect 3ABC antibodies, none has
   been developed specifically for the variable SAT serotypes. This study
   designed a SAT-specific NSP ELISA and determined whether this assay
   could better detect NSP-specific antibodies from FMDV SAT-infected
   livestock. The assay's performance was compared to validated NSP assays
   (PrioCheck (R)-NSP and IZSLER-NSP), using panels of field and
   experimental sera, vaccinated and/or infected with FMDV SAT1, SAT2 or
   SAT3. The sensitivity () of the SAT-NSP was estimated as 76\% (70\%,
   81\%) whereas the specificity was 96\% (95\%, 98\%) at a 95\% confidence
   interval. The sensitivity and specificity were comparable to the
   commercial NSP assays, PrioCheck (R)-NSP (82\% and 99\%, respectively)
   and IZSLER-NSP (78\% and 98\%, respectively). Good correlations were
   observed for all three assays.},

Abstract = {BackgroundOptimal procedure for storage of feline blood is needed.
   Open-collection systems have been employed in feline medicine, thus
   limiting the possibility for storage.
   ObjectivesTo evaluate indicators of quality of feline blood stored for
   35 days at +4 degrees C in a closed-collection system specifically
   designed for cats.
   AnimalsEight healthy adult European domestic shorthair cats with a
   weight of 5-6.8 kg.
   MethodsThis is a case series study. A bacteriological test, CBC, blood
   smear, pH, osmotic fragility, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), and
   adenosine triphosphate (ATP) measurement were performed weekly on whole
   blood (WB) units from day 1 to day 35 after donation. The hemolysis
   index, lactate and potassium concentrations, prothrombin time (PT),
   activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and fibrinogen were
   measured on plasma aliquots.
   ResultsOne out of eight blood units (BUs) had bacterial growth (Serratia
   marcescens) at day 35. No significant differences were found regarding
   CBC, morphology, pH, and osmotic fragility. Despite high
   inter-individual variability and low starting levels, significant
   decreases in the mean concentrations of 2,3-DPG (T0 1.99 mmol/g Hb, SD
   0.52, T35 1.25 mmol/g Hb, SD 1.43; P=.003) and ATP (T0 1.45 mmol/g Hb,
   SD 0.71, T35 0.62 mmol/g Hb, SD 0.51; P<.001) were detected during the
   study, as opposed to an increase in hemolysis (T0 0.11 mmol/L, SD 0.07,
   T35 0.84 mmol/L, SD 0.19; P<.001), lactate (T0 3.30 mmol/L, SD 0.86, T35
   13.36 mmol/L, SD 2.90; P<.001), and potassium (T0 3.10 mmol/L, SD 0.21,
   T35 4.12 mmol/L, SD 0.35; P<.001) concentrations.
   Conclusions and Clinical ImportanceThe commercial BU kit is appropriate
   for blood collection and conservation of WB in cats. The maintenance of
   WB quality indicators during storage is essential for future
   improvements of feline transfusion medicine.},

Abstract = {Cognebacterium pseudotuberculosis is the causative agent of caseous
   lymphadenitis (CLA) in domestic and wild ruminants. Here we describe CLA
   in alpine chamois (Rupicapra r. rupicapra) based on a series of 98 cases
   of C. pseudotuberculosis infection confirmed by bacteriology and gene
   sequence analysis. The population included 53 males and 45 females
   distributed within three age groups: up to 18 months (n = 14), 18 months
   to 4 years (n = 11) and over 4 years (n = 73). Four different gross
   lesion distribution patterns, observed individually or variably combined
   in the same animal, were defined: (1) cutaneous/external (i.e.
   subcutaneous lymph nodes with or without muscle involvement, n = 34);
   (2) abdominal visceral (i.e. only abdominal organs involved: liver
   and/or spleen and/or kidney and/or lymph nodes, n = 35); (3) thoracic
   visceral (i.e. only thoracic organs involved: lung and/or heart and/or
   lymph nodes, n = 26); and (4) generalized visceral (i.e. abdominal and
   thoracic organs involved, n = 26). In six particularly severe cases,
   mammary gland, testis, vertebral hone and the central nervous system
   were also affected. Macroscopically, most abscesses were characterized
   by fluid pus, confirmed by microscopy that showed the absence of
   distinct concentric layers and coagulative necrosis, which are typically
   seen in sheep and goats raised in areas where the infection is endemic.
   In three cases amyloid deposits were observed in the liver and kidney.
   The C. pseudotuberculosis strains isolated were highly homologous to the
   reference strain ATCC 19410, except for some variability in their
   ability to ferment maltose and mannitol. Based on the production of
   nitrate reductase, 95 strains were attributed to the ovis biovar
   (nitrate reduction negative) and three to the equi biovar (nitrate
   reduction positive). All strains were sensitive to antibiotics, except
   to ampicillin (62.3\% resistant strains) and gentamicin (83.7\%
   resistant strains). Using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   designed for CLA in sheep and goats, seven (58.3\%) of 12 scrum samples
   tested positive for antibodies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The effect of a dietary oregano aqueous extract on meat fatty acid
   profile, quality, and consumer acceptance in chickens fed a diet rich in
   polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) was evaluated in 3 consecutive
   trials.
   For each trial, 171 day-old Ross 308 chicks were randomly divided in
   replicates of 19 birds each and assigned to one of 3 experimental diets:
   1) basal control diet, 2) basal diet supplemented with 0.2 g/kg of
   oregano aqueous extract, and 3) basal diet supplemented with 150 ppm of
   vitamin E (as positive control). To better analyze the antioxidant
   activity of both oregano and vitamin E, all the experimental diets were
   enriched with a fatty acid supplement consisting in a mixture of PUFA at
   the same dose (1.16 \%) in both starter and finisher feeds. Oregano
   supplementation positively influenced (P < 0.05) broiler live
   performance. No differences were observed in physicochemical or proximal
   composition or in total fatty acid composition of breast meat. Dietary
   oregano influenced meat composition in terms of total phenolic content,
   antioxidant capacity, and thiobarbituric acidreactive substances,
   improving meat resistance to oxidation, compared to both other groups.
   During consumer tests, meat from the 3 dietary groups obtained the same
   liking score in a blind session. Under informed condition, consumer
   perception was positively influenced by labeling for all the considered
   attributes. Furthermore, consumers showed a higher expectation for meat
   derived from chickens fed the oregano extract when compared to that
   deriving from the other 2 groups.
   Results obtained in the present study allow stating that using oregano
   aqueous extract in diets enriched with PUFA can represent a valid
   solution to increase live weight of chickens, improve resistance to
   oxidation of meat, and positively influence consumer perception of
   poultry meat.},

Abstract = {In May 2016 a Norovirus (NoV) gastroenteritis outbreak involved a high
   school class visiting a seaside resort near Taormina (Mascali, Sicily).
   Twenty-four students and a teacher were affected and 17 of them showed
   symptoms on the second day of the journey, while the others got ill
   within the following 2 days. Symptoms included vomiting, diarrhoea and
   fever, and 12 students required hospitalisation. Stool samples tested
   positive for NoV genome by Real-Time polymerase chain reaction assay in
   all 25 symptomatic subjects. The GII.P2/GII.2 NoV genotype was linked to
   the outbreak by ORF1/ORF2 sequence analysis. The epidemiological
   features of the outbreak were consistent with food/waterborne followed
   by person-to-person and/or vomit transmission. Food consumed at a shared
   lunch on the first day of the trip was associated to illness and
   drinking un-bottled tap water was also considered as a risk factor. The
   analysis of water samples revealed the presence of bacterial indicators
   of faecal contamination in the water used in the resort as well as in
   other areas of the municipal water network, linking the NoV
   gastroenteritis outbreak to tap water pollution from sewage leakage.
   From a single water sample, an amplicon whose sequence corresponded to
   the capsid genotype recovered from patients could be obtained.},

Abstract = {In this research communication we exploited the potential use of milk
   microRNAs (miRs) as biomarkers for bovine tuberculosis (bTB). bTB is a
   zoonotic disease caused by Mycobacterium bovis which affects animal
   health, influencing herd economic sustainability. Diagnosis is based on
   skin delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction and quantification of
   interferon gamma but both techniques are influenced by several
   confounding factors. Thus, new methods for early diagnosis are required.
   In this context, microRNAs have been used as promising biomarkers for
   both infectious and non-infectious diseases. To determine the possible
   involvement of microRNAs in bTB, we analysed the expression of four
   immune-related miRs in 200 cows grouped in cases and controls with
   respect to positivity to tuberculosis. The analysis showed a different
   magnitude of expression in the groups indicating that active
   tuberculosis could influence miRs expression. We used expression values
   of miR-146a, the highest differentially expressed miR, for Receiver
   operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. In order to determine a
   test cut-off value for miR-146a expression that would differentiate
   cases and controls, a value for the miR-146a expression higher than 8
   was selected as this gave a test specificity and sensitivity of 80
   center dot 0\% and 86 center dot 0\% respectively. These values confirm
   the possibility of using miR-146a as a milk prognostic biomarker for
   bovine tuberculosis.},

Title = {Environmental and public health related risk of veterinary zinc in pig
   production - Using Denmark as an example},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {114},
Pages = {181-190},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {At great economic cost, important steps have been taken over the last
   many decades to reduce and control emissions of heavy metals in order to
   protect the environment and public health. Monitoring has confirmed the
   success of these policies with progressive declines of heavy metals in
   for example air, sewage sludge and environmental samples. For zinc, such
   improvements may nevertheless be counter-acted by its widely usage as a
   feed additive and veterinary medicinal product to piglets in the
   post-weaning period resulting in reduced occurrence of diarrhea and
   improvement of daily weight gain. This review therefore focuses on two
   major concerns associated with veterinary use of zinc, namely the
   quantifiable risks to the environment and promotion of (multi) resistant
   bacteria like LA-MRSA in pig farms. Denmark is used as an informed and
   realistic worst-case scenario, representing the largest pig production
   per capita in Europe. It is furthermore, one of the countries where most
   recent information can be found regarding soil monitoring data and zinc
   consumption within the pig production. An average increase in soil
   concentration by > 45\% was recently reported within the period
   1998-2014. In order to predict future risk, this review presents new and
   simplified model predictions using current soil concentrations, annual
   load rates and predicted accumulation rates. In conclusion, it is
   estimated that within 25 years, continued agricultural practice of
   current zinc loads may result in a situation where almost all soils
   receiving manure from intensive piglet production may be at risk, but
   also other pig production types may result in scenarios with predicted
   risk to soil dwelling species, especially in sandy soils. Besides the
   quantifiable risks to soil ecosystems, high levels of zinc furthermore
   co-select for the persistence of LA-MRSA CC398 and other resistant
   bacteria on pig farms.},

Title = {Factors associated with passive immunity transfer in dairy calves:
   combined effect of delivery time, amount and quality of the first
   colostrum meal},
Journal = {ANIMAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {Despite the well-known importance of an adequate colostral
   immunoglobulin (Ig) transfer to calf health and survival, failed
   transfer of passive immunity (FTPI) remains a widespread problem in
   dairy farming. The aim of this study was to investigate the management
   factors associated with FTPI in newborn calves, evaluating particularly
   the combined effect of delivery time, amount and quality of the first
   colostrum meal. The study was conducted from March to August 2014 on 21
   Italian dairy farms. Farmers were asked as first to answer a farm-level
   questionnaire on calf management. Blood sampling was then performed on
   overall 244 calves (1 to 5 days of age) born from Holstein cows, and a
   sample of the first colostrum meal of each calf was collected.
   Individual information on calves and the respective colostrum management
   were recorded. Serum and colostrum Ig concentrations were assessed by
   electrophoresis. A mixed effects multivariable logistic regression model
   was used to investigate the association of the variables obtained from
   both the management questionnaire and the individual calf data with FTPI
   (calf serum Ig concentration <10.0 g/l). A cumulative colostrum
   management score (CMS) that considered delivery time, amount and quality
   of the first colostrum meal was generated for 236 calves, with higher
   values indicating better colostrum management. Overall, 41.0\% of the
   calves were found having FTPI, and within-farm percentage of FTPI was
   over 20.0\% in 71.4\% of the farms. The risk of having FTPI was higher
   both for Holstein purebred calves compared with Holstein-beef crossbreds
   and for females compared with males. Moreover, it increased by 13\% with
   every hour of delay of the first colostrum meal provision since birth,
   whereas it decreased by 59\% and 3\%, respectively, with every
   additional liter of colostrum given and every additional gram of Ig per
   liter contained in the colostrum fed. Calf serum Ig concentration varied
   significantly according to the CMS, increasing by 1.53 g/l with every
   additional CMS point. In order to completely avoid FTPI, calves should
   receive at least 2.5 l of high-quality colostrum (Ig concentration >87.6
   g/l) within 1.0 h from birth. Considerable improvements are still needed
   about colostrum management for newborn calves in dairy farms. The
   results of this study will help in developing farm-specific programs for
   reducing the occurrence of FTPI.},

Abstract = {Fungi have a crucial role in the correct maturation of salami, but
   special attention should be addressed to the production of the
   nephrotoxic, immunotoxic, and carcinogenic mycotoxin ochratoxin A (OTA).
   In a monitoring study conducted in Northern Italy, OTA was detected by
   liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry in 13 out 133
   samples of traditional salami (9.8\% of the total count). Mycological
   analysis of these samples yielded 247 fungal isolates which were
   identified to species level. The most frequent species were Penicillium
   nalgiovense, P. solitum, and P. chrysogenum. P. nordicum, an
   OTA-producing species commonly found in proteinaceous food, was not
   found in these samples. Three isolates were found to be Aspergillus
   westerdijkiae, an OTA-producing species. In order to check the results
   of the microbiological identification, 19 different strains of
   Aspergillus and 94 of Penicillium were tested for the presence of a
   sequence common to OTA-producing fungi by real-time PCR. None of the
   studied isolates, including the three A. westerdijkiae, possessed the
   otanpsPN target which is common to OTA-producing strains. Two out of
   three isolates of the A. westerdijkiae were also PCR-negative for the
   otanpsPN gene and did not produce OTA in culture. Conversely, this
   target sequence was amplified from the DNA purified from 14 salami
   casings including three casings harboring A. westerdijkiae. The
   amplification of sequences specific for OTA-producing strains performed
   on total genomic DNA extracted directly from salami casings provided a
   more suitable approach than PCR analysis of isolates from salami for the
   OTA-related otanpsPN gene to evaluate the risk of OTA contamination.},

Abstract = {The ability of Listeria monocytogenes to survive during the manufacture
   of water buffalo Mozzarella and to grow during its shelf life was
   evaluated. A wild-type and a reference strain were used to contaminate
   raw milk. The viable count of the reference strain ATCC 9525 dropped
   after the stretching process, and in the cheese, it fell to below
   100cfu/g. When the wild-type strain was used, however, stretching did
   not appear to have any effect on the pathogen. The artificially
   contaminated cheeses were stored, for eleven days, at 4, 20 and 30
   degrees C. Pathogen populations increased at 20 (approximate to 2.60log
   cfu/g) and 30 degrees C (approximate to 1.95log cfu/g).},

Title = {Effect of cariporide on ram sperm pH regulation and motility: possible
   role of NHE1},
Journal = {REPRODUCTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {155},
Number = {5},
Pages = {433-445},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Sperm motility, a feature essential for in vivo fertilization, is
   influenced by intracellular pH (pHi) homeostasis. Several mechanisms are
   involved in pHi regulation, among which sodium-hydrogen exchangers
   (NHEs), a family of integral transmembrane proteins that catalyze the
   exchange of Na+ for H+ across lipid bilayers. A preliminary
   characterization of NHE activity and kinetic parameters, followed by
   analysis of the expression and localization of the protein in ram
   spermatozoa was performed. NHE activity showed an apparent Km for
   external Na+ of 17.61 mM. Immunoblotting revealed a molecular mass of 85
   kDa. Immunolocalization pattern showed some species-specific aspects,
   such as positive labeling at the equatorial region of the sperm head.
   Cariporide, a selective NHE1 inhibitor, significantly reduced pHi
   recovery (85\%). Similarly, exposure to cariporide significantly
   inhibited different motility parameters, including those related to
   sperm capacitation. In vitro fertilization (IVF) was not affected by
   cariporide, possibly due to the non-dramatic, although significant, drop
   in motility and velocity parameters or due to prolonged exposure during
   IVF, which may have caused progressive loss of its inhibitory effect. In
   conclusion, this is the first study documenting, in a large animal model
   (sheep) of well-known translational relevance, a direct functional role
   of NHE on sperm pHi and motility. The postulated specificity of
   cariporide toward isoform 1 of the Na+/H+ exchanger seems to suggest
   that NHE1 may contribute to the observed effects on sperm cell
   functionality.},

   Subunits From Echinococcus granulosus and Their Evaluation as Target
   Antigens for Cyst Viability Assessment},

Abstract = {Background: Several tools have been proposed for serodiagnosis of cystic
   echinococcosis (CE), but none seems promising for cyst viability
   assessment. Antigens with stage-specific diagnostic value have been
   described, but few studies with well-characterized antigens and human
   serum samples have been performed. Antigen B (AgB) proteoforms hold
   promise as markers of viability, due to their differential stage-related
   expression and immunoreactivity.
   Methods: Four AgB subunits (AgB1, AgB2, AgB3, AgB4) were synthesized and
   structurally characterized. Based on the preliminary evaluation of the
   subunits by western immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   (ELISA), AgB1 and AgB2 were further tested in two ELISA setups and
   extensively validated on 422 human serum samples.
   Results: All subunits showed a high degree of spontaneous
   oligomerization. Interacting residues within oligomers were identified,
   showing that both the N-terminal and C-terminal of each subunit are
   involved in homo-oligomer contact interfaces. No hetero-oligomer was
   identified. AgB1 and AgB2 ELISAs revealed different sensitivities
   relative to cyst stage. Of note, besides high specificity (97.2\%), AgB1
   revealed a higher sensitivity for active-transitional cysts (100\% for
   CE1, 77.8\% for CE2, 81.5\% for CE3a, and 86.3\% for CE3b) than for
   inactive cysts (41.7\% for CE4 and 11.1\% for CE5) and postsurgical
   patients (44\%). Interestingly, 19 of 20 patients with spontaneously
   inactive cysts and 6 of 9 treated with albendazole > 5 years earlier
   were negative on the AgB1 assay.
   Conclusions: The structural characterization of subunits provides
   insights into the synthetic antigen conformation. The stage-related
   sensitivity of synthetic AgB1 holds promise as part of a multiantigen
   setting and deserves further longitudinal evaluation as marker of cyst
   viability.},

Abstract = {Common wheat is one of the most important staple food crops worldwide.
   However, unlike other important staple crops such as maize or soybean,
   genetically modified (GM) wheat is not yet present in the global food
   market. Nonetheless, in the recent past, the adventitious presence of GM
   glyphosate-tolerant volunteers was reported in open wheat fields in the
   USA. The European Union Reference Laboratory for GM Food and Feed
   (EURL-GMFF) was therefore called to develop a strategy to detect such
   unauthorised GM wheat in wheat samples by using both taxon-specific and
   screening tests. Two candidate common wheat taxon-specific real-time PCR
   methods were suggested, one targeting ssII-D gene coding for starch
   synthase and the other targeting waxy-D1 gene, coding for granule-bound
   starch synthase. In the present study, the two above-mentioned real-time
   PCR taxon-specific methods were in-house verified and compared,
   proposing droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) as a new tool for supporting the
   application of the European Network of GMO Laboratories (ENGL)
   established method performance criteria. Preliminary performance data of
   waxy-D1 and ssII-D methods in ddPCR format are shown too to give a
   contribution to the bridging process from the consolidated to the
   emerging quantitative PCR methodology.},

Abstract = {Here we report and characterize a porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED)
   outbreak which occurred in a swine fattening farm in the province of
   Teramo, Abruzzi region (central Italy), in January 2016. PED virus
   (PEDV) identification was determined by real-time RT-PCR performed on
   RNAs purified from fecal samples collected from two symptomatic pigs.
   Whole genome sequence (PEDV 1842/2016) was also obtained by next
   generation sequencing straight from RNA purified from one fecal sample.
   Genome comparison with extant global PEDV strains revealed a high
   nucleotide identity with recently reported European and American S-INDEL
   PEDVs. Efficient sequencing, share of genomic data combined with the
   implementation of epidemiological tools would be the ideal approach for
   study and analysis of transboundary infectious diseases as PED.},

Abstract = {We tested cadmium (Cd2+) effects on porcine IPEC-J2 cells, which
   represent an in vitro model of the interaction between intestinal cells
   and both infectious and non-infectious stressors. Accordingly, we
   investigated the effects of low (2 mu M) to moderate (20 mu M)
   concentrations of Cd2+, in terms of pro-inflammatory gene expression and
   protein release, as well as of infectivity in a Salmonella typhimurium
   penetration model. Our data showed a significant (P<.001) increase of
   intracellular Cd2+ after 3, 6 and 24 h of exposure with respect to
   levels at 1 h. These data showed the ability of IPEC-J2 to absorb Cd2+
   as a function of both time and concentration. Also, the absorption of
   this heavy metal was related to a significant modulation of important
   pro-inflammatory messengers. In particular, down-regulation of IL-8 was
   associated with a significant decrease of Salmonella typhimurium ability
   to penetrate into IPEC-J2 cells, in agreement with a previous study in
   which an anti-IL8 antibody could significantly inhibit Salmonella
   penetration into the same cells Glary uoli et al., 2017). This finding
   demonstrates the ability of Cd2+ to affect the outcome of an important
   host-pathogen relationship. In conclusion, our study highlighted the
   ability of an environmental pollutant like Cd2+ to modulate innate
   immune responses in terms of chemokine release and gene expression, and
   susceptibility to microbial infections.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FOOD PROTECTION},

Volume = {81},

Abstract = {Fish consumption is the principal source of intake of organochlorinated
   compounds in humans. Compared with other types of foods of animal
   origin, fish contain the highest levels of polychlorinated biphenyls
   (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, and polychlorinated
   dibenzofurans, all of which are classified as highly toxic
   organochlorine compounds. Currently, lakes and fish farms in northern
   Italy are not regularly monitored for PCBs and dioxins in areas
   contaminated by industrial sources, partially because of the high costs
   of traditional analytical methods that limit the number of samples to be
   analyzed. The DR-CALUX cell bioassay is based on the uptake of the
   cellular aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) for dioxins and dioxin-like
   compounds. The aim of this study was to assess the levels of dioxins and
   dioxin-like PCB contamination in Lake Maggiore and Lake Como, two lakes
   in northwestern Italy, and in nearby areas. The levels were quantified
   using the cell bioassay DR-CALUX and reference controls in two wild fish
   species, perch (Perca fluviatilis) and roach (Rutilus rutilus), and in a
   farmed species, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Tissue samples
   collected from the fanned rainbow trout were also submitted to
   immunohistochemical analysis of CYP1A expression as a marker for
   environmental pollutant-induced liver damage. The levels of dioxins,
   furans, and dioxin-like PCBs were all below the maximum levels and
   action limits set by European Union Regulation, suggesting no risk for
   human health associated with the consumption of the fish species caught
   or farmed in these areas.},

Title = {DISCONTOOLS: Identifying gaps in controlling bovine spongiform
   encephalopathy},
Journal = {TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {65},
Number = {1},
Pages = {9-21},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This article summarizes the 2016 update of the DISCONTOOLS project gap
   analysis on bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), which was based on a
   combination of literature review and expert knowledge. Uncertainty still
   exists in relation to the pathogenesis, immunology and epidemiology of
   BSE, but provided that infected material is prohibited from entering the
   animal feed chain, cases should continue to decline. BSE does not appear
   to spread between cattle, but if new strains with this ability appear
   then control would be considerably more difficult. Atypical types of BSE
   (L-BSE and H-BSE) have been identified, which have different molecular
   patterns and pathology, and do not display the same clinical signs as
   classical BSE. Laboratory transmission experiments indicate that the
   L-BSE agent has zoonotic potential. There is no satisfactory conclusion
   regarding the origin of the BSE epidemic. C-BSE case numbers declined
   rapidly following strict controls banning ruminant protein in animal
   feed, but occasional cases still occur. It is unclear whether these more
   recent cases indicate inadequate implementation of the bans, or the
   possibility that C-BSE might occur spontaneously, as has been postulated
   for H-and L-BSE. All of this will have implications once existing bans
   and levels of surveillance are both relaxed. Immunochemical tests can
   only be applied post-mortem. There is no immunological basis for
   diagnosis in the live animal. All aspects of disease control are
   expensive, particularly surveillance, specified risk material removal
   and feed controls. There is pressure to relax feed controls, and
   concurrent pressure from other sources to reduce surveillance. While the
   cost benefit argument can be applied successfully to either of these
   approaches, it would be necessary to maintain the ban on intraspecies
   recycling and some baseline surveillance. However, the potential risk is
   not limited to intraspecies recycling; recycling with cross-species
   transmission may be an ideal way to select or/ and modify properties of
   transmissible spongiform encephalopathies agents in the future.},

Abstract = {Twelve different approaches commonly used for the simultaneous LC tandem
   MS (MS/MS) determination of mycotoxins (deoxynivalenol, aflatoxins,
   ochratoxin A, T-2 and HT -2 toxins, fumonisins, and zearalenone) were
   tested in cereals and feed materials. They comprised different
   extraction solvents, types of cleanup {[}solid-phase extraction,
   QuEChERS, and immunoaffinity (IMA)], and calibration approaches
   (external or matrix matched). The percentage of mycotoxins with
   acceptable recovery, according to Regulation (EC) No. 401/2006, ranged
   from 9 to 100\%. The approach giving the highest percentage of
   acceptable results was selected and further tested for corn, rice, and
   feed spiked at three different mycotoxin levels (low, medium, and high).
   The method is based on extraction with MeOH water (70 + 30, v/v) and
   cleanup with two multiantibody IMA columns. For corn and rice spiked at
   low mycotoxin levels, a significant matrix effect was observed and was
   compensated by using C-13 calibration. At higher mycotoxin levels
   (medium and high), matrix effects were negligible as no significant
   differences were observed for the majority of recovery results
   calculated by C-13 calibration and external calibration. Although the
   proposed method still needs improvement in terms of accuracy and, to a
   lesser extent, precision, it was successfully tested with four
   proficiency tests in buckwheat, corn, rice, and feed, giving acceptable
   z -scores for 97\% (34 out of 35) of results.},

Abstract = {The identification of field mice Apodemus flavicollis, Apodemus
   sylvaticus, and Apodemus alpicola represents a challenge for field
   scientists due to their highly overlapping morphological traits and
   habitats. Here, we propose a new fast real-time PCR method to
   discriminate the three species by species-specific TaqMan assays.
   Primers and probes were designed based on the alignment of 54 cyt-b
   partial sequences from 25 different European countries retrieved from
   GenBank. TaqMan assays were then tested on 133 samples from three
   different areas of Italy. Real-time PCR analysis showed 92 samples
   classified as A.flavicollis, 13 as A.sylvaticus, and 28 as A.alpicola.
   We did not observe any double amplification and DNA sequencing confirmed
   species assignment obtained by the TaqMan assays. The method is
   implementable on different matrices (ear tissues, tail, and blood). It
   can be used on dead specimens or on alive animals with minimally
   invasive sampling, and given the high sensitivity, the assay may be also
   suitable for degraded or low-DNA samples. The method proved to work well
   to discriminate between the species analyzed. Furthermore, it gives
   clear results (amplified or not) and it does not require any
   postamplification handling of PCR product, reducing the time needed for
   the analyses and the risk of carryover contamination. It therefore
   represents a valuable tool for field ecologists, conservationists, and
   epidemiologists.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUNDDonkey milk is considered as a functional food for sensitive
   consumers, such as children who are allergic to cow milk. No information
   is available regarding the effect of farming systems on the quality of
   donkey milk. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of the
   farming system and lactation stage on donkey milk with respect to gross
   composition, as well as fat-soluble vitamins and fatty acids (FA).
   RESULTSIndividual milk samples were collected from lactating jennies
   (n=53) on the six of the largest farms located in North West Italy. The
   performance of lactating jennies, herd characteristics and feeding
   strategies were recorded at each milk sampling. The gross composition of
   the milk, along with the fat-soluble vitamin content, differed in
   accordance with the farming system. The lactation stage had limited
   effects on milk quality. A higher milk fat content corresponded to a
   higher amount of fresh herbage proportion in the diet, with the highest
   polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), C18:1c9, C18:3n-3, n-3 FA, retinol
   and -tocopherol content and the lowest concentrations of the FA that are
   less favorable for human health in the milk of animals fed on only
   forage diets.
   CONCLUSIONExtensive farming of dairy donkeys increased the fat content
   and fat-soluble vitamin concentration of milk and also altered the FA
   composition to a more favorable profile for human nutrition. (c) 2017

Title = {Circulating miRNAs as Putative Biomarkers of Exercise Adaptation in
   Endurance Horses},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {APR 24},
Abstract = {Endurance exercise induces metabolic adaptations and has recently been
   reported associated with the modulation of a particular class of small
   noncoding RNAs, microRNAs, that act as post-transcriptional regulators
   of gene expression. Released into body fluids, they termed circulating
   miRNAs, and they have been recognized as more effective and accurate
   biomarkers than classical serum markers. This study examined serum
   profile of miRNAs through massive parallel sequencing in response to
   prolonged endurance exercise in samples obtained from four competitive
   Arabian horses before and 2 h after the end of competition. MicroRNA
   identification, differential gene expression (DGE) analysis and a
   protein-protein interaction (PPI) network showing significantly enriched
   pathways of target gene clusters, were assessed and explored. Our
   results show modulation of more than 100 miRNAs probably arising from
   tissues involved in exercise responses and indicating the modulation of
   correlated processes as muscle remodeling, immune and inflammatory
   responses. Circulating miRNA high-throughput sequencing is a promising
   approach for sports medicine for the discovery of putative biomarkers
   for predicting risks related to prolonged activity and monitoring
   metabolic adaptations.},

Title = {A Comparative Genomic Analysis Provides Novel Insights Into the

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Over the past decades, Salmonella 4,{[}5],12:i:- has rapidly emerged and
   it is isolated with high frequency in the swine food chain. Although
   many studies have documented the epidemiological success of this
   serovar, few investigations have tried to explain this phenomenon from a
   genetic perspective. Here a comparative whole-genome analysis of 50
   epidemiologically unrelated S. 4,{[}5],12:i:-, isolated in Italy from
   2010 to 2016 was performed, characterizing them in terms of genetic
   elements potentially conferring resistance, tolerance and persistence
   characteristics. Phylogenetic analyses indicated interesting
   distinctions among the investigated isolates. The most striking genetic
   trait characterizing the analyzed isolates is the widespread presence of
   heavy metals tolerance gene cassettes: most of the strains possess genes
   expected to confer resistance to copper and silver, whereas about half
   of the isolates also contain the mercury tolerance gene rnerA. A
   functional assay showed that these genes might be useful for preventing
   the toxic effects of metals, thus supporting the hypothesis that they
   can contribute to the success of S. 4,{[}5],12:i:- in farming
   environments. In addition, the analysis of the distribution of type II
   toxin-antitoxin families indicated that these elements are abundant in
   this serovar, suggesting that this is another factor that might favor
   its successful spread.},

Abstract = {Rickettsia helvetica is an emerging human pathogen, belonging to the
   spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae, associated with generally
   aneruptive fever, meningitis, and sudden death in chronic
   perimyocarditis. In this study, we describe the detection of R.
   helvetica in human-parasitizing and free-living Ixodes ricinus from the
   Metropolitan City of Rome. The pathogen was found in a tick acquired by
   a woman in an urban park. The circulation of R. helvetica was further
   confirmed by its detection in free-living ticks from a wild green area.
   These findings demonstrate that urban as well as wild green areas can
   represent a risk of infection to humans by R. helvetica, with
   potentially severe sequelae. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
   first report of R. helvetica in the Lazio region. Large-scale studies
   are needed to evaluate and quantify the presence of R. helvetica and
   other SFG rickettsiae in the urban and periurban context and to assess
   the risk to humans and animals related to their frequentation.},

Title = {Relevant Measures to Prevent the Spread of African Swine Fever in the
   European Union Domestic Pig Sector},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Month = {APR 16},
Abstract = {During the past decade, African swine fever (ASF) has spread from the
   Caucasus region to eastern European Union countries affecting domestic
   pig and wild boar populations. In order to avert ASF spread, mitigation
   measures targeting both populations have been established. However,
   despite these efforts, ASF has been reported in thirteen different
   countries (Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, the Russian Federation,
   Ukraine, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Moldova, Czech
   Republic, and Romania). In the absence of an effective vaccine or
   treatment to ASF, introduction and spread of ASF onto domestic pig farms
   can only be prevented by strict compliance to control measures. This
   study systematically reviewed available measures to prevent the spread
   of ASF in the EU domestic pig sector distinguishing between commercial,
   non-commercial, and outdoor farms. The search was performed in PubMed
   and using a common browser. A total of 52 documents were selected for
   the final review process, which included scientific articles, reports,
   EU documents and official recommendations, among others. From this
   literature review, 37 measures were identified as preventive measures
   for the introduction and spread of ASF. Subsequently, these measures
   were assessed by ASF experts for their relevance in the mitigation of
   ASF spread on the three mentioned types of farms. All experts agreed
   that some of the important preventive measures for all three types of
   farms were: the identification of animals and farm records; strict
   enforcement of the ban on swill feeding; and containment of pigs, so as
   to not allow direct or indirect pig-pig and/or pig-wild boar contacts.
   Other important preventive measures for all farms were education of
   farmers, workers, and operators; no contact between farmers and farm
   staff and external pigs; appropriate removal of carcasses, slaughter
   residues, and food waste; proper disposal of manure and dead animals,
   and abstaining from hunting activities during the previous 48 h
   (allowing a 48 h interval between hunting and being in contact with
   domestic pigs). Finally, all experts identified that the important
   preventive measures for non-commercial and outdoor farms is to improve
   access of those farms to veterinarians and health services.},

Abstract = {The Commission Regulation (EC) Regulation N. 488/2014, established the
   concentration limits for cadmium in specific products based on cocoa and
   chocolate products as from January 2019. Based on this information there
   is a need to determine ultratrace levels of elements that might be
   presents in cocoa and chocolate products. In this work, the
   concentrations of Arsenic, Antimony, Cadmium, Chromium, Lead, Selenium
   and Vanadium were evaluated in cocoa powder and chocolate by the
   validation of an ICP-MS method. Good selectivity/specificity, recovery,
   repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility, LOD, LOQ, range of
   linearity, standard measurement uncertainty parameters for method
   validation were achieved, in accordance with Commission Regulation. The
   cocoa powder revealed the maximum metal concentrations of 0.303 +/-
   0.035 mg/kg for cadmium, 1.228 +/- 0.146 mg/kg for lead and 0.094 +/-
   0.013 mg/kg for arsenic. A significant difference was found between
   cocoa powder and chocolate samples (p < .05).},

Title = {Putative human sperm Interactome: a networks study},
Journal = {BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Month = {APR 11},
Abstract = {Background: For over sixty years, it has been known that mammalian
   spermatozoa immediately after ejaculation are virtually infertile. They
   became able to fertilize only after they reside for long time (hours to
   days) within female genital tract where they complete their functional
   maturation, the capacitation. This process is finely regulated by the
   interaction with the female environment and involves, in spermatozoa, a
   myriad of molecules as messengers and target of signals. Since, to date,
   a model able to represent the molecular interaction that characterize
   sperm physiology does not exist, we realized the Human Sperm Interactme
   Network3.0 (HSIN3.0) and its main component (HSNI3.0\_MC), starting from
   the pathway active in male germ cells.
   Results: HSIN3.0 and HSIN3.0\_MC are scale free networks, adherent to
   the Barabasi-Albert model, and are characterised by an ultra-small world
   topology. We found that they are resistant to random attacks and that
   are designed to respond quickly and specifically to external inputs. In
   addition, it has been possible to identify the most connected nodes (the
   hubs) and the bottlenecks nodes. This result allowed us to explore the
   control mechanisms active in driving sperm biochemical machinery and to
   verify the different levels of controls: party vs. date hubs and hubs
   vs. bottlenecks, thanks the availability of data from KO mice. Finally,
   we found that several key nodes represent molecules specifically
   involved in function that are thought to be not present or not active in
   sperm cells, such as control of cell cycle, proteins synthesis, nuclear
   trafficking, and immune response, thus potentially open new perspectives
   on the study of sperm biology.
   Conclusions: For the first time we present a network representing
   putative human sperm interactome. This result gives very intriguing
   biological information and could contribute to the knowledge of
   spermatozoa, either in physiological or pathological conditions.},

Title = {Risk Factors for Avian Influenza H9 Infection of Chickens in Live Bird
   Retail Stalls of Lahore District, Pakistan 2009-2010},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {APR 4},
Abstract = {This study was conducted to identify risk factors associated with AIV
   infections in live bird retail stalls (LBRS) in Lahore District,
   Pakistan. A cross-sectional survey of LBRS was conducted from December
   2009-February 2010 using two-stage cluster sampling based on probability
   proportional to size. A total of 280 oropharyngeal swab sample pools
   were collected from 1400 birds in 8 clusters and tested by qRT-PCR for
   the matrix (M) gene of type A influenza virus and HA gene subtypes H9,
   H5 and H7. Thirty-four (34) samples were positive for the M gene, of
   which 28 were also positive for H9. No sample was found positive for H5
   or H7. Data for 36 potential risk factors, collected by questionnaire,
   were analyzed by survey-weighted logistic regression and prevalence odds
   ratios (OR) for associated risk factors were calculated. A final
   multivariable model identified three risk factors for H9 infection in
   LRBS, namely obtaining birds from mixed sources (OR 2.28, CI95\%:
   1.4-3.7), keeping birds outside cages (OR 3.10, CI95\%: 1.4-7.0) and
   keeping chicken breeds other than broilers (OR 6.27, CI95\%: 1.7-23.2).
   Sourcing birds from dealers/wholesalers, keeping birds inside cages and
   avoiding mixing different breeds in cages could reduce the risk of H9
   infections in LRBS.},

Title = {Metabolic and hormonal adaptation in Bubalus bubalis around calving and
   early lactation},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 4},
Abstract = {Pregnancy and lactation are physiological periods that result in an
   increased metabolic demand that, if not satisfied, could provoke a
   threat to homeostasis. In this study changes in the values of
   Non-Esterified Fatty Acids (NEFA) and p-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), glucose,
   insulin, thyroid hormones, milk composition and yield were investigated
   in buffaloes during the late pregnancy and early lactation. From a total
   of 50 buffaloes, blood samples were collected -7 +/- 5 days before
   expected calving; +7 +/- 5; +30 +/- 5 and +50 +/- 5 days post-partum;
   milk samples were collected at the same post-partum time points. On
   serum samples, the values of Non-Esterified Fatty Acids (NEFA),
   beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), glucose, insulin, Triiodothy-ronine (T3),
   Thyroxine (T4) and Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were evaluated. On
   milk, fat \%, protein \%, lactose \%, somatic cells score (SCS), milk
   yield and daily milk production (DMP) were assessed. Peripartum period
   significantly influenced all studied parameters (P<0.05). Milk
   constituents and productivity statistically changed throughout
   monitoring period (P<0.005). Milk yield resulted positively correlated
   with insulin and TSH values, negatively correlated with NEFA and BHB.
   Insulin was negatively correlated with lactose \% and positively
   correlated with SCS. The obtained results showed that the peripartum
   period and lactation are accompanied by marked changes in some
   biochemical variables and in the thyroid hormones values in Italian
   Mediterranean Buffaloes. Moreover, the relationship found between TSH
   values and milk yield seems to suggest a possible role of thyroid gland
   on the maintenance of lactogenesis. This study underlines the importance
   of monitoring the hormonal status of buffalo during the transition
   period in order to understand when adjustments of regulatory mechanisms
   break through physiological limits predisposing the buffalo to metabolic
   problems.},

Abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is an important zoonosis, which has been
   re-emerging in different ecological scenarios. In Sicily, Italy, from
   2004 to 2014, an anatomopathological survey for tuberculosis-like
   lesions both in farmed and wild animals was performed. The isolates were
   genotyped using spoligotyping and Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive
   Units-Variable Number of Tandem Repeats (MIRU-VNTR) techniques. High
   prevalence of lesions was observed for cattle (4\%), pigs (4.9\%) and
   wild boars (6.8\%), and a total of 625 Mycobacterium bovis isolates were
   identified. Genotyping analysis showed the presence of 37 different
   spoligotypes including fifteen spoligotypes not present in other Italian
   regions and 266 MIRU-VNTR profiles. Spoligotype SB0120 exhibited the
   highest prevalence in cattle (50\%) and pigs (56\%) and the highest
   genetic variety with 126 different MIRU-VNTR profiles. The isolation of
   M.bovis in a farmer underlines the importance of M.bovis identification
   during the human TB diagnostic processes. This study supported the use
   of the genotyping analysis as a valuable tool for the evaluation of the
   epidemiological role of pigs and other domestic reservoirs such as goats
   and the role of wildlife in the maintenance of bTB infection.},

Abstract = {According to European Union (EU) regulations, the serological tests for
   the eradication of bovine and ovine brucellosis are the Rose Bengal
   Test, Complement Fixation Test, and i-ELISA. These methods, also
   recommended by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) for
   international trades, have limitations related to the use of suspensions
   of smooth Brucellae or LPS extracts. Limitations include false-positive
   serological reactions to brucellosis, which in turn impedes accurate
   diagnosis in some herds. False positive reactions should be considered
   carefully during the final stages of an eradication programme and for
   surveillance purposes in brucellosis-free areas. In this study, we
   produced specific sera through the experimental infection of sheep with
   Y. enterocolitica 0:9 and E. coli 0157:H7. These are the most important
   cross-reactive bacteria with Brucella. We then evaluated the antibody
   response of groups of sheep that had been immunised towards homologous
   antigens and official antigens for brucellosis, in order to identify a
   differential diagnostic protocol to distinguish cross-reaction in
   Brucella-infected animals.},

Abstract = {Pteropine Orthoreoviruses (PRVs) are fusogenic bat-borne orthoreoviruses
   that cause flu-like upper respiratory tract infections in humans. The
   presence of this group of viruses in bats and humans has been well
   documented in areas where their biological reservoirs - fruit bats
   (family Pteropodidae) - live densely. In the present study, a serum
   neutralization (SN) assay to detect neutralizing antibodies against PRV
   Indonesia/2010 isolate was set up and used to assess the seroprevalence
   of this virus in Italian domestic animals. The new developed assay was
   able of detecting PRV neutralizing antibodies in the hyper-immune
   polyclonal serum produced in rabbits (titer of 1:160). The negative
   serum was negative at all tested dilutions. No cross-reactions have been
   evidenced neither against reference MRVs nor against their respective
   hyper-immune sera. Eight hundred and fifty-three serum samples collected
   from 524 bovines, 271 small ruminants, and 58 horses (all used as
   sentinel animals in the Bluetongue and West Nile disease National
   surveillance program) were also tested with the new developed SN assay.
   According to the results of this survey, neither PRV nor PRV
   cross-reacting viruses antibodies have been demonstrated in Italian
   domestic animals. However, the new developed SN assay could be a very
   valuable diagnostic tool to detect infection in animals and humans.},

Title = {Evaluation of biological and socio-economic factors related to
   persistence of African swine fever in Sardinia},
Journal = {PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {152},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Despite the implementation of several eradication programmes, African
   swine fever (ASF), a viral disease in pigs caused by a DNA virus (ASFV),
   has been present in Sardinia (Italy) since 1978. Several studies have
   been carried out on the epidemiology of ASF in Sardinia, aimed at
   attaining a better understanding of the role of the risk factors related
   to ASFV persistence, but those studies did not address the social
   aspects involved. This work sought to bridge this gap, identifying the
   main social risk factors associated with ASF persistence. With this aim,
   this study takes into account not only the known ``biological{''} risk
   factors identified in previous studies, but also the direct correlation
   between ASF persistence and well-known socio-economic aspects. The
   demographic characteristics, the Material Deprivation Index (IDM) and
   the non-compliance with the rules on ASF controls, including the
   traditional method of keeping free-range pigs has been evaluated. To
   assess the weight of each risk factor, data about pig farms, wild boar
   and social factors in Sardinia, were analysed using the Negative
   Binomial Regression Model. The main outcome was the number of domestic
   pig outbreaks occurring in Sardinian during 2011-2016. The effect in
   terms of the odds ratio (OR) was calculated to each factor included. The
   biological risk factors identified covered the number of animals (OR =
   3.33, p < .0001, by 100 animals) and farms (OR = 1.07, p = .006, by 10
   farms), the animal movements (OR = 1.64, p = .001, by 10 movements), the
   presence of illegal pigs (OR = 6.87, p < .0001) and the ASFV prevalence
   in wild boars (OR = 1.30, p = .001). Among the socio-economic factors,
   the compliance with control measures (OR = 0.90, p < .0001), the human
   population increasing by 1000 people (OR = 0.89, p < .0001), the growing
   age of the farmers (OR = 0.66, p = .025, by 5 years) and
   non-relationships with other farms (OR = 0.85, p < .001), decreased the
   ASF risk. The deprived condition (i.e. cultural and material
   deprivation, lack of resources and overcrowding index) increases the
   risk of about four times, as the low educational level (OR = 3.97, p =
   .002). Having highlighted the important role of social conditions, this
   risk definition allows understanding the Sardinian situation and may be
   useful to decision-makers to draft specific control strategies against
   this disease in the island, which should take into account local risk
   factors.},

Title = {Risk factors for pre-slaughter mortality in fattening and breeding
   rabbits},
Journal = {LIVESTOCK SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {210},
Pages = {55-58},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Pre-slaughter transportation of rabbits under commercial conditions may
   influence their mortality, routinely recorded at the slaughterhouse as
   DOA ('dead-on-arrival' rate). The aim of this study was to identify
   potential risk factors for DOA, including batch size (number of rabbits
   loaded), season, stocking density, and transport and lairage duration. A
   retrospective analysis of 6411 fattening rabbit and 450 breeding rabbit
   batches transported in a 3-year period to a major abattoir of Northeast
   Italy was performed. At least one dead animal was recorded in 62\% of
   fattening batches and 14\% of breeding batches. Average DOA was 0.08\%
   for fattening rabbits, but in transports with at least one dead rabbit
   the average DOA was 0.13\%. For fattening rabbits, significantly
   increased DOAs were observed in batches with < 1201 or > 3508 rabbits,
   mainly during the summer, and at a stocking density higher than 29.3
   kg/crate. The highest number of batches at high stocking density was
   found in winter (61\% of all batches). Batches with high stocking
   density showed a higher DOA even in winter, suggesting that the
   reduction of space availability does not protect against low
   temperatures. Regarding travel duration, transports longer than 3 h
   increased significantly DOA by approximate to 40\% compared to
   transports shorter than 1 h. A lairage longer than 7 h doubled the DOA
   compared to a lairage shorter than 2 h. The interaction between travel
   and lairage duration showed that a journey shorter than 1 h can
   significantly reduce DOA associated with a long lairage. For breeding
   rabbits, the average DOA in batches with at least one dead rabbit (n =
   65), was 1.79\%; no significant association with variables was detected.},

Volume = {117},
Number = {4},
Pages = {981-987},

Abstract = {Ticks are well known to be important vectors for a wide range of
   bacteria, viruses and protozoa affecting human and animal health. Ixodid
   ticks are widely distributed in Sardinia, and an increasing number of
   tick-borne bacteria have been documented in the island. A growing number
   of evidence are supporting the hypothesis of alternative transmission
   routes for chlamydial bacteria such as the involvement of vectors. This
   study was conducted to provide possible molecular detection of members
   belonging to the Chlamydiales order in Sardinian ticks and to update
   information concerning the presence of new ectoparasite-borne bacteria
   in ticks collected from domestic and wild hosts in a typical
   Mediterranean environment. A total of 378 ticks were individually
   screened with a pan-Chlamydiales specific primers targeting the 16S rRNA
   gene. Chlamydiales DNA was detected in 28\% of the total ticks analyzed.
   The analyses of sequences highlighted that Rhipicephalus sanguineus
   sensu lato, Rhipicephalus bursa, Rhipicephalus annulatus, Haemaphysalis
   sulcata, Haemaphysalis punctata and Dermacentor marginatus ticks
   exhibited DNA of Chlamydiaceae and Parachlamydiaceae members. Our
   results revealed that DNA of zoonotic microorganisms such as C.
   psittaci, C. abortus and the emerging pathogen Parachlamydia
   acanthamoebae are present in Sardinian ticks. Since routes of Chlamydia
   transmission are yet to be fully defined, the role of ticks as possible
   vectors for Chlamydiales remains the most challenging and interesting
   question to be addressed in future research. Continued monitoring of
   these pathogens in tick vectors is needed to provide strategies for
   controlling of possible chlamydial infections and disease outbreaks in
   the island.},

Abstract = {Noroviruses and hepatitis A virus are the pathogens most frequently
   involved in non-bacterial gastroenteritis and hepatitis worldwide.They
   are mainly transmitted via the faecal-oral route, direct
   person-to-person contact or through the consumption of contaminated
   water and foods. In food virology, detection methods of these viruses
   are currently based on real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain
   reaction (RT-PCR). A crucial step in this process is the acid nucleic
   extraction, since its performance can negatively influence viral
   detection and thus give false negative results. The aim of this study is
   to evaluate the efficiency of 2 automated extraction systems, MagMAX
   Express and EZ1 Advanced XL, in recovering hepatitis A virus and
   norovirus RNA from mussels. In the present study, we used mengovirus as
   a process control to assess the efficiency of the extraction process.
   Samples were tested for mengovirus, hepatitis A, and norovirus by real
   time one-step RT-PCR assay. Our data indicates the MagMax Express is the
   better system to extract hepatitis A and norovirus RNA from mussels
   since its extraction efficiency was higher (p < 0.05) than EZ1 Advanced
   XL.},

Abstract = {Mortality caused by rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) in wild
   rabbits is reduced in parts of Australia where the related,
   non-pathogenic calicivirus RCV-A1 is endemic. Laboratory experiments
   previously showed that prior infection with RCV-A1 enabled rabbits to
   better withstand subsequent infection with highly virulent RHDV, and
   this was assumed to explain higher survival. Here, we analyse
   serological data from the field suggesting that reduced mortality rates
   among wild rabbits may also result from rabbits previously infected with
   RCV-A1 having a reduced likelihood of RHDV infection. We discuss the
   possible mechanisms underlying this finding and its implications. The
   methods we describe for analysing field data gave far greater insights
   into epidemiological processes and virus interactions than gained from
   reporting basic seroprevalence rates alone.},

Abstract = {The Brucella melitensis REV1 vaccine is the most widely employed vaccine
   for prophylaxis against brucellosis in sheep and goats. The objective of
   vaccination is disease control in herds or preventing infection in
   farms. In this study, we produced REV1 vaccine with a protocol, based on
   the use of liquid medium in a bioreactor, that resulted efficient, safe,
   relatively fast, and cost-effective. The live attenuated vaccine
   produced was tested in mice and sheep to investigate its immunogenicity
   and efficacy. Seventy-two female BALB/c mice were obtained and
   subdivided in 2 groups, one was stimulated with 1 x 10(6) colony-forming
   units (CFUs) of B. melitensis while the other with physiological
   solution alone and acting as control group. Furthermore, 25 sheep were
   subdivided into 5 groups: four were inoculated with a B. melitensis
   dose, ranging from 0.6 x 10(9) and 3.2 x 10(9) CFUs and the other was
   the control group. In addition, a serological diagnosis was performed
   for sheep by rapid serum agglutination and the complement-fixation test.
   Immunocompetent cells from both experiment were collected at different
   times post vaccination and immunostained to evaluate innate and
   adaptive-immune responses. In mice flow cytometry was used to detect
   macrophages, T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, memory cells, naive cells,
   natural killer cells, major histocompatibility complex type II, B
   lymphocytes, regulatory T lymphocytes, T helper lymphocytes, cytotoxic T
   lymphocytes and recently activated CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes. In
   sheep, macrophages, T helper cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, regulatory
   T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, memory cells and naive lymphocytes, by
   the same method, were analyzed. The results showed, both in mice and
   sheep, that the live, attenuated REV1 vaccine stimulated all
   immunocompetent cells tested, with a balanced innate and adaptive
   response. In the sheep experiment, the administered vaccine dose was
   very important because, at the lower doses, immunological tolerance
   tended to disappear, while, at the highest dose, the immunological
   tolerance remained active for a long period. In our experimental
   conditions, the optimal vaccine dose for sheep was 3.2 x 10(9) CFUs,
   although a good immune response was found using a dose of 1.6 x 10(9)
   CFUs. The vaccine produced in this study could be extensively employed
   in developing countries to control the brucellosis in sheep and goats.},

Abstract = {The objective of this research was to analyze the impact of different
   cooking procedures (i.e., gas hob and traditional static oven) and
   levels of cooking (i.e., rare, medium, and well-done) on inactivation of
   Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella in pork loin chops. Moreover, the
   consumer's exposure to both microorganisms after simulation of meat
   leftover storage at home was assessed. The results showed that well-done
   cooking in a static oven was the only treatment able to inactivate the
   tested pathogens. The other cooking combinations allowed to reach in the
   product temperatures always 73.6 degrees C, decreasing both pathogens
   between 6 log(10) cfu/g and 7 log(10) cfu/g. However, according to
   simulation results, the few cells surviving cooking treatments can
   multiply during storage by consumers up to 1 log(10) cfu/g, with
   probabilities of 0.059 (gas hob) and 0.035 (static oven) for L.
   monocytogenes and 0.049 (gas hob) and 0.031 (static oven) for
   Salmonella. The key factors affecting consumer exposure in relation to
   storage practices were probability of pathogen occurrence after cooking,
   doneness degree, time of storage, and time of storage at room
   temperature. The results of this study can be combined with prevalence
   data and dose-response models in risk assessment models and included in
   guidelines for consumers on practices to be followed to manage cooking
   of pork meat at home.},

Abstract = {In the last decades, adverse food reactions have increased considerably
   in dogs and cats. In this study we report on the possible onset of food
   intolerances symptoms, including otitis, diarrhoea, generalised anxiety,
   and dermatitis in a cohort of 8 dogs consuming commercial diets. All
   dogs received an organic chicken-based diet for 15 days. We performed
   analysis of blood biochemical parameters, kibble composition, and
   oxytetracycline (OTC) serum concentration before and after 15 days of
   organic chicken-based diet supplementation. We hypothesised that a
   chronic intake of contaminated food enhanced by the presence of
   nanoparticle aggregates might be at the base of the onset of
   pharmacologic or idiopathic food intolerances. At the end of the
   evaluation period, an overall significant reduction of otitis,
   diarrhoea, generalised anxiety, and dermatitis was observed. Biochemical
   analyses indicate a significant increase in the alkaline phosphatase,
   from 41 to 52.5 U/L, after 15 days ({*}{*}p < 0.01), while a significant
   decrease in Gamma-glutamyl transferase and urea, from 9.37 to 6.25 U/L
   and from 32.13 +/- 8.72 to 22.13 +/- 7.8 mg/dL, respectively, was
   observed ({*}p < 0.05). A significant decrease, from 0.22 to 0.02 mu
   g/mL, in mean OTC serum concentration was also observed ({*}{*}p <
   0.01). Composition analysis revealed the presence of OTC, calcium,
   aluminium, silicon, and phosphorous nanoparticle aggregates. Further
   research on a wider sample size would help to confirm the hypothesis
   proposed here.},

Abstract = {Reproductive disorders are responsible for significant economic losses
   in canary aviculture due to embryo and newborn chick mortality. Most of
   the time, deaths are caused by bacterial pathogens, however little
   published data exist about the prevalence of bacterial isolates that are
   identified during diagnostic protocols. This study reports on data
   collected from previous investigations carried out on cloacal swabs (n
   456), unhatched eggs (n 52), and dead newborn chicks (n 68) collected
   from canary aviaries with a history of reproductive disorders. Of the
   examined samples, 41\% were positive for the presence of pathogenic or
   potentially pathogenic bacteria, with particular regard to Gram negative
   species during bacteriological investigations. The most prevalent
   microorganisms were Gram-negative (55\%). A predominance of Klebsiella,
   Escherichia, and Pantoea genera was observed. These are usually
   associated to pathological conditions in pet birds. Among Gram-positive
   bacteria, Bacillus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. were most prevalent. The
   antimicrobial susceptibility testing carried out on bacterial isolates
   showed a multiple resistance, especially against amoxycillin,
   erythromycin, spiramycin, tiamulin, and tylosin. This study represents a
   first attempt to provide an update on microbial causes of embryonic and
   neonatal mortality in canary aviaries in Italy; in addition, it provides
   further understandings about the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy.},

Abstract = {Mercury (Hg) is a global pollutant that affect human and ecosystem
   health. It is transferred through trophic level and bio magnification in
   the food chain. In this study, total Hg was measured in the muscular
   tissue of samples of swordfish (Xiphias gladius) from different FAO
   fishing areas and imported in Italy between 2014 and 2017. Total mercury
   concentrations of muscular tissues were determined using cold vapour
   atomic absorption spectrometry. In order to assess the health risk
   associated with human consumption of this fish, the Hg intake values
   were calculated and compared with those of provisional tolerable daily
   intake (PTDI) (0.57 mu g/kg b.w.) as fixed by the Food and Agriculture
   Organization/World Health Organization (FAO/WHO). The estimated PTDI
   (provisional tolerable daily intake) were lower for adults (0.40 mu g/kg
   b.w./day) but not for children (0.97 mu g/kg b.w./day), and therefore is
   considered to pose an alert for children with the present fish
   consumption volume. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Investigation of potential risk factors associated with Salmonella

Abstract = {Background: In 2012/13, the Federal government of Nigeria approved the
   surveillance of salmonellae in commercial poultry farms with the aim of
   generating baseline data for the development of a control programme.
   That baseline provided an opportunity to investigate potential risk
   factors in commercial layer farms.
   Methods: Five hundred and twenty-three farms were evaluated for the
   presence of Salmonella. Each farmer was interviewed through a structured
   questionnaire. Univariate analysis identified 26 variables potentially
   associated with Salmonella presence on the farms, with different levels
   of significance. To simultaneously evaluate the effect of these
   variables, a multivariable logistic regression model was implemented.
   Results: Farmers that are member of the Poultry Association of Nigeria
   (PAN) emerged as a risk factor, as well as being farmer as exclusive
   occupation. The risk of Salmonella increased in farms with a combined
   housing system as compared to farms with a single housing system.
   Moreover, in terms of farm management the use of plastic egg crates had
   a higher risk of Salmonella presence compared to paper crates. Higher
   risk of contamination was also identified in farms having regular
   contact with animal health workers, since this could be indicative of
   animal health problems requiring continuous assistance. Farms with no
   previous outbreak of salmonellosis were associated with an increase
   risk, since most of the farms in this category were newly established.
   With regard to feeding, the use of coccidiostats and commercial feeds
   were associated with the spread of Salmonella. Unexpectedly, the
   presence of other farms at distances further than 1 km away was
   associated with an increase in Salmonella presence as compared to farms
   which were in closer proximity. Close proximity among farms could favour
   the application of stricter biosecurity measures.
   Conclusions: The results of the survey can be considered a baseline for
   implementing effective measures aimed at reducing the Salmonella
   prevalence in Nigerian laying hen farms.},

Abstract = {Paratuberculosis (or Johne's disease) is an infectious disease which
   affects mainly ruminants and it is caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp.
   paratuberculosis (MAP). During a culling program (years 2011-2015) aimed
   at controlling the red deer (Cervus elaphus) population in Stelvio
   National Park (Italian Alps), where paratuberculosis was already
   described in this species, 382 tissue samples from the Lombardy Region
   and 102 fecal specimens from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano were
   analyzed by PCR. Of these, 77 samples (20.16\%) from the Lombardy area
   and 19 specimens (18.63\%) from the Bolzano area resulted PCR positive.
   The cultural test was carried out on PCR positive samples (n = 96),
   enabling the isolation of 19 MAP field strains which were genotyped
   using MIRU-VNTR typing and Short Sequence repeats (SSRs).
   Our results suggest that all isolates share an identical VNTR profile
   corresponding to the INMV1 genotype. The only variation was on the locus
   SSR2, but the utility of this last locus has already been questioned
   because of its instability. Overall, these data suggest a common clonal
   origin and host adaptation during the diffusion of paratuberculosis in
   this population. Finally, this profile is the same as that which has
   already been described in the cattle population in Northern Italy,
   suggesting a possible inter-species disease transmission pattern from
   wildlife to domestic ruminants and vice versa.},

Abstract = {Grasses (Poaceae) are very common plants, which are widespread in all
   environments and urban areas. Despite their economical importance, they
   can represent a problem to humans due to their abundant production of
   allergenic pollen. Detailed information about the pollen season for
   these species is needed in order to plan adequate therapies and to warn
   allergic people about the risks they take in certain areas at certain
   moments. Moreover, precise identification of the causative species and
   their allergens is necessary when the patient is treated with
   allergen-specific immunotherapy. The intrafamily morphological
   similarity of grass pollen grains makes it impossible to distinguish
   which particular species is present in the atmosphere at a given moment.
   This study aimed at developing new biomolecular tools to analyze
   aerobiological samples and identifying major allergenic Poaceae taxa at
   subfamily or species level, exploiting fast real-time PCR. Protocols
   were tested for DNA extraction from pollen sampled with volumetric and
   gravimetric methods. A fragment of the matK plastidial gene was
   amplified and sequenced in Poaceae species known to have high
   allergological impact. Species- and subfamily-specific primer-probe
   systems were designed and tested in fast real-time PCRs to evaluate the
   presence of these taxa in aerobiological pollen samples.
   Species-specific systems were obtained for four of five studied species.
   A primer-probe set was also proposed for the detection of Pooideae (a
   grass subfamily that includes also major cereal grains) in
   aerobiological samples, as this subfamily includes species carrying both
   grass allergens from groups 1 and 5. These, among the 11 groups in which
   grass pollen allergens are classified, are considered responsible for
   the most frequent and severe symptoms.},

Abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of food-borne intoxications.
   Several staphylococcal food poisoning outbreaks have been linked to
   consumption of raw milk cheeses and artisanal cheese production.
   However, information on Staph. aureus isolated from artisanal raw milk
   cheeses and small-scale dairy production environments is very limited.
   Therefore, we aimed to characterize Staph. aureus isolated along the
   artisanal raw milk production chain by determining (1) the population
   structure, and (2) the presence/absence of enterotoxin genes, mecA/C,
   and pvl. We collected 276 samples from different production stages (raw
   milk, whey, curd, brine, drying worktops, and cheese) at 36 artisan
   dairies in Italy. A total of 102 samples from 25 dairies tested positive
   for Staph. aureus, with 80\% positive samples among the tested artisan
   cheeses. All isolates were further characterized by spa typing and PCR
   screening for staphylococcal enterotoxin genes, the mecA/mecC genes
   characteristic for methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus, and the pvl gene
   encoding Panton-Valentine leukocidin. The 102 isolates represented 15
   different spa types and were assigned to 32 different Staph. aureus
   strains. The spa type most frequently detected was t2953 (30\%), which
   is associated with genotype B strains causing high within-herd levels of
   bovine mastitis. In addition, 3 novel spa types (t13269, t13277, and
   t13278) were identified. Although none of the strains harbored mecA/mecC
   or pvl, 55\% of the isolates exhibited at least one enterotoxin gene.
   Many strains were present in samples from multiple dairies from
   different regions and years, highlighting the spread of Staph. aureus in
   small-scale cheese production plants. Our findings demonstrate that
   enterotoxigenic Staph. aureus and in particular t2953 (genotype B)
   isolates commonly occur in artisanal dairies and raw milk cheeses in
   Italy. It is particularly alarming that 80\% of the artisan cheeses
   sampled in our study were positive for Staph. aureus. These findings
   stress the need for effective measures preventing staphylococcal food
   poisoning by limiting Staph. aureus growth and enterotoxin formation
   along the production chain and in the final product.},

Title = {Detection of Human Bocavirus Species 2 and 3 in Bivalve Shellfish in

Journal = {APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Human bocavirus (HBoV) has been shown to be a common cause of
   respiratory infections and gastroenteritis in children. Recently, HBoVs
   have been detected in sewage and river waters in Italy and worldwide.
   However, studies on their presence in other water environments and in
   bivalve mollusks are not yet available. In this study, 316 bivalve
   shellfish samples collected in three Italian regions over a 6-year
   period (2012 to 2017) were analyzed by nested PCR and sequencing using
   broad-range primer pairs targeting the capsid proteins VP1 and VP2 of
   HBoV. The virus was detected in 27 samples (8.5\% of the total samples),
   and a statistically significant difference was found within the three
   regions. A further 13 samples, collected in geographic and temporal
   proximity to positive samples, were included in the study to assess the
   spread of HBoV in shellfish production areas at the time of
   contamination. Twelve of these additional samples were found to be
   positive for HBoV. All positive samples in this study were characterized
   as HBoV species 2 (17 samples; 8 different sequences) or species 3 (22
   samples; 4 different sequences). This study reports the occurrence of
   HBoV in bivalve shellfish and shows evidence of considerable spatial
   spread of the virus throughout shellfish production areas. Further
   studies are needed to elucidate both the role of HBoV as an agent of
   gastroenteritis and the risk for foodborne transmission of this virus.
   IMPORTANCE Human bocavirus is recognized as an important cause of acute
   respiratory tract infections and has recently been considered an
   etiological agent of gastroenteritis in the pediatric population. Our
   findings document that HBoVs are detected in bivalve shellfish with a
   relevant prevalence and suggest that an assessment of the risk for
   foodborne transmission of these viruses should be undertaken.},

Title = {Association between passive immunity and health status of dairy calves
   under 30 days of age},
Journal = {PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {152},
Pages = {12-15},

Abstract = {Calves are highly susceptible to disease and mortality occurrence within
   the first month of life. Even if failed transfer of passive immunity
   (FTPI) is commonly recognized as a main factor affecting calf health and
   survival, conflicting results are reported in literature about the
   association between passive immunity (PI) and calf health, especially
   regarding enteric diseases. Therefore, a prospective cohort study was
   conducted on 78 calves of three Italian dairy farms during winters of
   years 2014-2016, with the specific aim of evaluating the association
   between PI and health status of calves within 30 days of age under field
   conditions. Blood samples were collected between 1 and 5 days of age
   from each calf included in the study, and disease and mortality
   occurrence was monitored throughout the first month of life.
   Additionally, fecal samples were collected from calves with scours
   before treatment. Blood serum samples were tested by an electrophoretic
   method for the assessment of immunoglobulin (Ig) concentration, whereas
   fecal samples were submitted to ELISA test for positivity to Escherichia
   coli K99, rotavirus, coronavirus, and Cryptosporidium spp. Only enteric
   diseases occurred in calves of this study. Calves that suffered from
   diarrhea or died within the first month of life had lower serum Ig
   concentrations than those that remained healthy or survived (P < .05).
   Even if not significantly (P = .127), lower serum Ig concentrations were
   observed in sick calves that had been treated with antibiotics compared
   to those that had not been treated. The odds of disease and mortality
   occurrence were 24 (95\% CI = 3-231) and 11 (95\% CI = 1-111) times
   higher, respectively, for calves with FTPI (serum Ig concentration <
   10.0 g/L) than for those with an adequate PI transfer (P < .05). Calves
   with adequate PI transfer had also a 6-day delay in the age at first
   disease onset compared to those with FTPI (P < .01). Even if estimated
   on a small number of calves, those with FTPI had higher risks of enteric
   infections by rotavirus (odds ratio = 12; 95\% CI = 1-137) and
   Cryptosporidium spp. (odds ratio = 9; 95\% CI = 1-72) (P < .05). In this
   study, the PI level influenced the occurrence of enteric diseases and
   mortality in calves under one month of age, confirming the importance of
   a proper colostrum provision to calf health and, consequently, to the
   reduction of antimicrobial use in dairy farming. However, further
   investigations are needed, particularly focusing on the relationship
   between PI and specific enteropathogen infections in calves.},

Abstract = {Bluetongue (BT), is one of the OIE-listed major diseases of ruminants.
   Following the official report of BT virus serotype 3 (BTV-3) in a sheep
   in Cap Bon (Tunisia), blood and serum samples of ruminants were
   collected from some areas of Tunisia to further investigate the presence
   of this virus in the country. A quantitative real time RT-PCR has been
   first developed for the detection and quantitation of BTV-3 RNA from
   field specimens. Out of 62 collected blood samples, 23 were shown to be
   positive for BTV-3 RNA. Isolation on cell cultures was also possible
   from six samples. Genome sequencing revealed the circulation of two
   unrelated western strains of BTV-3, one circulating in Cap Bon and
   neighboring areas, and the other circulating nearby the border with
   Libya. The presence of a putative novel BTV serotype (BTV-Y TUN2017) in
   sheep introduced from Libya to Tunisia, genomically related to the BTV
   strain contaminating a commercially-available sheep pox vaccine and to
   BTV-26, has been also demonstrated. This finding highlights the pressing
   need for a prompt production and release of a novel inactivated BTV-3
   vaccine to be used in case of emergence or proactively in the areas of
   Southern Europe at major risk of BTV introduction. The assessment of a
   novel vaccine will certainly exalt the role and importance of
   surveillance activities and collaboration with Northern African
   countries.},

Abstract = {In recent years, consumers have been increasingly interested in the
   quality and safety of specialty food products that are perceived as
   healthy and wholesome. However, few studies have been carried out to
   assess the effects of domestic cooking on the fate of pathogens in
   meat-based products. The present study aimed to assess the shelf life of
   ready-to-cook Ascoli-style olives, an Italian specialty food
   preparation, through accelerated shelf life tests. A challenge test was
   also carried out to test the efficacy of cooking methods on the survival
   of Salmonella Senftenberg strains. Accelerated shelf life assays,
   including physico-chemical assays (investigating the total volatile
   basic nitrogen and pH), microbiological counts (Enterobacteriaceae
   counts) and sensory parameters (appearance, color, odor, flavor and
   texture) allowed us to obtain sound information on the durability of
   pre-cooked Ascoli-style olives in an affordable and efficient manner.
   This is therefore an effective method that could be exploited by food
   business operators hoping to provide scientific information on product
   shelf life assessments. The challenge tests demonstrated that fan-baking
   in an electric oven at 200 A degrees C for 12 min and deep frying for 4
   min are the more effective treatments needed to inactivate the
   artificially inoculated Salmonella Senftenberg strains.},

Abstract = {We summarized the neuropathologic findings in 60 cetaceans stranded
   along the Italian coastline from 2002 to 2014. The following
   neuropathologic changes were detected in 45\% (27/60) of animals:
   nonsuppurative meningo-encephalitides (30\%, 18/60), nonspecific lesions
   (12\%, 7/60), suppurative encephalitis (2\%, 1/60), and neoplasm (2\%,
   1/60). No histologic lesions were found in 47\% (28/60) of the
   specimens. Five (8\%, 5/60) samples were unsuitable for analysis.
   Analysis with PCR detected Brucella spp., morbillivirus, and Toxoplasma
   gondii infection in one, six, and seven individuals, respectively.
   Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed positivity for morbillivirus and
   for T. gondii infection in three cases each. No evidence of the
   scrapie-associated prion protein PrPSc was detected. Our findings
   underscore the importance of an adequate surveillance system for
   monitoring aquatic mammal pathologies and for protecting both animal and
   human health.},

Title = {Outbreak of ``Winter Dysentery{''} (Bovine Coronavirus, BCoV) infection
   in dairy cows housed in a farm in Sicily},
Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {24},

Pages = {59-62},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Introduction - Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV) is an important pathogen of
   livestock that causes an enteric and respiratory disease in cattle
   (Winter Dysentery) and calves (Neonatal Calf Diarrhea). The BCoV
   infection rarely causes death but shows high morbidity (up to 100\%)
   that induces economic losses in farms.
   Aim - This paper describes a case of BCoV infection occurred on December
   2016 in a high milk production farm, placed in Ragusa (Sicily, Italy).
   Materials and methods - All bovines farmed (nr. 150 subjects) showed
   hyperthermia (41 degrees C), watery dysentery mixed to blood and fibrin,
   buccal and gengival erosions, high reduction of milk production. Four
   days before the appearance of these symptoms, the involved animals had
   been vaccinated with a delete vaccine against Bovine Viral Diarrhea
   Virus (BVDV). Whole blood, sera, feces and nasal swabs were collected
   from 15 animals that showed more severe symptoms. Serological (ELISA)
   and Virological tests (RT-PCR, Real Time RT-PCR, ELISA) were carried out
   to detect BCoV, Rotavirus, BVDV, Bluetongue Virus (BTV), Infectious
   Bovine Rhinotracheitis/Infectious Pustular Vulvovaginitis Virus
   (IBR/IPV), Herpes Bovine Virus type 4 (BHV4), Bovine Respiratory
   Syncytial Virus (BRSV) and Schmallenberg Virus (SBV). Feces were also
   analyzed for BCoV detection through Immunoelectron Microscopy (IEM).
   Results and discussion - Blood and swabs samples gave negative results
   for all virological tests. All feces samples resulted positives for BCoV
   by Semi Nested RT-PCR but they resulted negative by ELISA. Viral
   particles, referable to BCoV, were also observed at IEM. Serological
   tests gave positive results for Rotavirus, BVDV, IBR/IPV, VRSB, BHV4. In
   this study, BCoV was the only etiological agent detected in feces
   collected from cows affected by severe clinical signs. RT-PCR and IEM
   were found to be two reliable methods for the diagnosis of BCoV, showing
   a greater sensitivity than ELISA. Serological positivity detected for
   IBR/IPV, BTV, BVDV, BHV4 and VRSB were connected to previous
   vaccinations, while, the presence of antibodies against Rotavirus showed
   previous circulation of this virus in farm.
   Conclusions - BCoV infection, usually referred as ``Winter Dysentery{''}
   (WD) is also reported as ``Conditioned Disease{''} because it is induced
   by various stressors. Vaccination against BVDV could have been one of
   the putative stressor, responsible for the disease. Although BCoV
   infection has had a benign evolution, without mortality in affected
   animals, it has caused significant economic losses. Therefore, a control
   of stressors and a correct management of animal welfare represent the
   only valid prevention tool.},

Abstract = {The present case study concerns a case of predation of 4 individuals of
   captive pink flamingo in Emilia Romagna Region, Northeastern Italy. The
   pink flamingo (Phoenicopterus roseus) is a species included in the Red
   List of Threatened Species established by the International. Union for
   Conservation of Nature (IUCN) which lists species in danger of
   extinction. During the Winter of 2013, 4 flamingos (2 in the Comacchio
   area, and 2 from Argenta and Codigoro oases - Ferrara province) were
   found dead some of them headless, with their bodies severely bitten. At
   first, a fox (Vulpes vulpes) was suspected to be the predator
   responsible for the killing and the birds were taken to the laboratory
   for further investigations. The investigations included: field
   observations, study of the predator behaviour, necropsy examinations,
   assessment of the intercanine distance, and genetic analysis on the
   predator's traces. The intercanine distance indicated that the predator
   could not have been a fox. The analysis of salivary DNA samples enabled
   us to establish that the predator was in fact a dog. This case
   highlights the importance of co-operation among the various branches of
   forensic sciences and the great usefulness of the roles filled by other
   veterinary forensic experts involved in solving crime.},

Abstract = {Widely spread in nature, Yersinia enterocolitica (YE) is a foodborne
   pathogen of major health and economic significance in developed
   countries. The aim of this study is to analyse YE strains isolated from
   400 slaughtered pigs from the Abruzzo region, Italy, using biochemical
   tests and a multiplex polymerase chain reaction PCR detecting 6
   chromosomal genes (ystA, irp2, 16s, ail, inv, hemR) and one
   plasmid-borne virulence gene (yadA). Antimicrobial susceptibility was
   evaluated and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was also performed
   in order to assess phylogenetic diversity. In total, 56 samples of
   porcine tonsils (14\%) were found to be positive for the presence of
   pathogenic YE. All YE belonged to the pathogenic bioserotype 4/O:3. All
   YE samples were positive for the chromosomal virulence genes ystA, ail,
   and inv, whereas results for the presence of yadA and hemR were
   variable. This study found that YE isolates were resistant to ampicillin
   (100\%), streptomycin (26.79\%), sulfisoxazole (19.65\%), tetracycline
   (16.08\%), nalidixic acid (14.30\%), and chloramphenicol (10.72\%). The
   strains characterised by PFGE showed a high similarity. This study
   demonstrates the usefulness of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
   compared with conventional phenotypic assays for the identification of
   pathogenic YE isolates and the limitations of PFGE for the molecular
   typing of YE bioserotype 4/O:3.},

   exposure originating from contaminated food and polluted environments.
   The concentrations of 15 essential and non-essential metals were
   investigated in African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) feathers from a
   Northwestern Italian zoological facility. These birds are exclusively
   fed with herring from the northeast Atlantic Ocean. Certain elements,
   such as Hg and Cd, reflected the bioaccumulation phenomena that occur
   through the marine food chain. The levels of Cr, Mn, and Ni were
   comparable to those registered in feathers of birds living in polluted
   areas. These results are important for comparative studies regarding the
   health, nutrition and welfare of endangered seabirds kept under human

Abstract = {Seaweeds have been used as animal feed since a long time and are
   consumed as food in several cultures. In fact, macroalgae are a source
   of protein, fiber, polyunsaturated fat, and minerals. The concentration
   of trace elements was determined in dominant macroalga species from
   three sites of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. A high interspecies
   variability was observed, with higher metal levels in brown and green
   than those in red seaweeds. The maximum values set by European
   regulations for arsenic, mercury, and cadmium in food and feed were
   never exceeded, but a few samples were very close to limits set for
   mercury. Conversely, the maximum limit for lead in feed was exceeded in
   all species from one of the considered sites. Analogously, lead in
   seaweeds could constitute a potential risk for human health, due to the
   exceeding of the maximum value set for food supplements.},

Title = {A comprehensive mitochondrial DNA mixed-stock analysis clarifies the

Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {165},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Migration is one of several marine vertebrate traits increasingly
   affected by human encroachment. The Adriatic Sea is an important
   foraging and wintering site for loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta),
   and one of the Mediterranean regions where they are most heavily
   impacted, particularly by fisheries bycatch. Conservation measures
   concern foraging and wintering areas and nesting grounds, and must,
   therefore, be informed by the natal origin of individuals in these mixed
   aggregates. Genetic diversity was investigated among 488 loggerheads
   found stranded or incidentally captured in fishing gear across the
   Adriatic and the origin of individuals was assessed through mixed-stock
   analysis based on comparison of 755 bp of mitochondrial DNA control
   region sequence. In addition, we highlight the importance of the Gulf of
   Manfredonia (Apulia, Italy), and of the northeastern Adriatic-a
   previously genetically undescribed foraging ground. No significant
   genetic divergence was recorded among sampling areas, between turtles
   sampled in cold and warm months or between adults and juveniles. The
   distribution of turtles across the Adriatic Sea appeared not to depend
   on individual origin. Rookeries in western Greece and Crete provided the
   most important contributions to the Adriatic mixed stock. In particular,
   the Greek populations were the most abundant locally in the Gulf of
   Manfredonia, so they are likely to experience an even greater impact
   than previously thought because of the severe fishery bycatch levels in
   this area. This study also provides an example of how substantial
   increases in sample sizes permit a relatively comprehensive testing of
   genetic structure across groupings in foraging aggregations.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to isolate, define the genetic profile, assess

   Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Vibrio River, vulnificus
   strains isolated from the Vibrata river (Abruzzo Region, Italy) during a
   monitoring Vibrio spp., period of one year. Detection was performed
   according to ISO/TS 21872-1-2:2007. Species Virulence genes.
   identification and characterisation were achieved using molecular
   methods. Vibrio spp. were detected in 50\% (23) of the water samples. In
   particular, V. cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus, and V. vulnificus were
   isolated in 18 (39.1\%), 4 (8.7\%), and 2 (4.3\%) samples, respectively.
   All V. parahaemolyticus strains were tdh gene negative, 75\% were
   positive for trh gene. In 30 V. cholerae isolates, the polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) assay for detecting virulence and regulatory genes (ctxA,
   toxR, tcpA, ompU, hlyA, tcpl, zot, and stn/sto) revealed 6 genotypes
   associated to different levels of pathogenicity. Pulsed-field gel
   electrophoresis (PFGE) characterisation of the V. cholerae strains
   identified 13 different pulsotypes. A greater degree of similarity was
   shown for strains isolated in the same period of the year. Results of
   our study reveal a potential health risk associated with the waters of
   the Vibrata river, which are used for irrigation and next to the
   swimming areas of Abruzzo coastline.},

   fluids},

Pages = {65-73},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Many production diseases of dairy cows are related to digestive
   troubles. The rumen subacute acidosis is the most relevant one, albeit
   not easily recognized. Recent studies suggest that forestomachs can
   perform regulatory actions at both regional and systemic levels, since
   forestomach walls express immune receptors and cytokines, and the rumen
   liquor is infiltrated by leukocytes. Therefore, the rumen fluid could be
   conveniently collected for investigating metabolic production diseases.
   Thus, we investigated the origin of the leukocytes of the rumen fluid
   and demonstrated that they partly derive from saliva. Next, we carried
   out a field survey of innate immunity in rumen fluids of 128 cows from
   12 dairy farms, along with clinical inspections, assessment of milk
   yield, rumen pH, volatile fatty acids (VFA) and major inflammo-metabolic
   parameters. Significant statistical correlations were found between
   immune markers in rumen fluids and biochemical parameters. A significant
   negative correlation was found in rumen between CD45 gene expression
   (leukocyte infiltration) and pH level. B cells were the most frequent
   mononuclear leukocyte population in the rumen liquor and their
   infiltration was negatively affected by low ruminal pH and high
   concentrations of VFA. Moreover, total Ig and IgM in rumen fluids were
   negatively correlated with ruminal pH and positively correlated with
   uremia.
   Our data suggest that forestomach immune responses could be directed to
   ``dangers{''} arising within the forestomach environment. The immune
   markers could integrate consolidated diagnostic parameters (e.g. rumen
   pH) and contribute to robust, early diagnosis of tricky digestive
   troubles of cattle.},

Abstract = {Several factors influence bacteria biodiversity in hot springs. The
   impact of biotic and abiotic pathways on travertine deposition plays a
   key role in microbial ecology and in the final composition of the
   waterborne microbiota. The metabolism of some bacterial groups such as
   photoautotrophs or lithoautotrophs influences water chemistry, favoring
   carbonate precipitation processes. The role of microbial mats in mineral
   precipitation processes is not fully clarified. For the first time, a
   comprehensive metagenomic analysis has been undertaken in the historical
   Bullicame hot spring. Bacterial biodiversity was characterized and
   biomineralization activities were assigned to different genera. A higher
   biodiversity in mat samples compared to water samples was observed:
   Shannon index of 3.34 and 0.86, respectively. Based on the functional
   assignment of each Operational Taxonomic Unit, the bacteria involved in
   biologically- induced mineralization are prevalent in mat and released
   in the water. According to the principle that each geothermal water
   specimen has distinctive physic-chemical characteristics, our results
   suggest new interacting bio-actions within these ecosystems. The
   saturation index and the chemical composition, as the high concentration
   of sulfur species and HCO3, can be linked to create a selective
   environment where pioneer communities are able to live and shape the
   ecosystem.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH DISEASES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {41},

Abstract = {Betanodaviruses are small ssRNA viruses responsible for viral
   encephalopathy and retinopathy, otherwise known as viral nervous
   necrosis, in marine fish worldwide. These viruses can be either
   horizontally or vertically transmitted and have been sporadically
   detected in invertebrates, which seem to be one of the possible viral
   sources. Twenty-eight new betanodavirus strains were retrieved in three
   molluscs species collected from different European countries between
   2008 and 2015. The phylogenetic analyses revealed that strains retrieved
   from bivalve molluscs are closely related to viruses detected in finfish
   in Southern Europe in the period 2000-2009. Nevertheless, a new
   betanodavirus strain, markedly different from the other members of the
   RGNNV genotype, was detected. Such a massive and varied presence of
   betanodaviruses in bivalve molluscs greatly stresses the risks of
   transmission previously feared for other invertebrates. Bivalve molluscs
   reared in the same area as farmed and wild finfish could act as a
   reservoir of the virus. Furthermore, current European regulations allow
   relaying activities and the sale of live bivalve molluscs, which could
   pose a real risk of spreading betanodaviruses across different
   geographic regions. To our knowledge, this is the first study, which
   focuses on the detection and genetic characterization of betanodaviruses
   in bivalve molluscs.},

Abstract = {Background and aim: Epidemiology of human non-typhoid salmonellosis is
   characterised by recurrent emergence of new clones of the pathogen over
   time. Some clonal lines of Salmonella have shaped epidemiology of the
   disease at global level, as happened for serotype Enteritidis or, more
   recently, for Salmonella 4,{[}5],12:i:-, a monophasic variant of
   serotype Typhimurium. The same clonal behaviour is recognisable at
   sub-serotype level where single outbreaks or more generalised epidemics
   are attributable to defined clones. The aim of this study was to
   understand the dynamics of a clone of Salmonella 4,{[}5],12:i:- over a
   3-year period (2012-15) in a province of Northern Italy where the clone
   caused a large outbreak in 2013. Furthermore, the role of candidate
   outbreak sources was investigated and the accuracy of multilocus
   variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) was evaluated. Methods: we
   retrospectively investigated the outbreak through whole genome
   sequencing (WGS) and further monitored the outbreak clone for 2 years
   after its conclusion. Results: The study showed the transient nature of
   the clone in the population, possibly as a consequence of its occasional
   expansion in a food-processing facility. We demonstrated that important
   weaknesses characterise conventional typing methods applied to clonal
   pathogens such as Salmonella 4,{[}5],12:i:-, namely lack of accuracy for
   MLVA and inadequate resolution power for PFGE to be reliably used for
   clone tracking. Conclusions: The study provided evidence for the
   remarkable prevention potential of whole genome sequencing used as a
   routine tool in systems that integrate human, food and animal
   surveillance.},

Title = {Serological survey in wild boar (Sus scrofa) in Switzerland and other
   European countries: Sarcoptes scabiei may be more widely distributed
   than previously thought},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},
Month = {MAR 27},
Abstract = {Background: Sarcoptic mange has recently emerged in wild boar in
   Switzerland, raising the question of the origin of the infection. The
   main aim of this study was to assess the extent of exposure of the wild
   boar populations to Sarcoptes scabiei in Switzerland, prior to and after
   the detection of mange cases, to determine whether the mite has been
   recently introduced into the populations concerned. We performed a
   serological survey using a commercially available ELISA and 1056
   archived blood samples of free-ranging wild boar from Switzerland. To
   facilitate the interpretation of the obtained data, we additionally
   estimated seroprevalence in wild boar populations of four other European
   countries (1060 samples), both from areas with confirmed clinical cases
   of mange and from areas without reported cases in wild boar. Lastly, we
   revised the evaluation of the commercial ELISA when used with wild boar
   sera.
   Results: Seropositive reactions were observed for samples from all five
   countries and from 15 of the 16 study areas. The obtained apparent
   seroprevalences ranged from 0.0\% (0/82; 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI]: 0.0-4.4) to 17.4\% (8/46; 95\% CI: 7.8-31.4). Wild boar from
   study areas with known clinical cases and those <= 60 kg were four times
   more likely to be seropositive than wild boar from areas without
   reported cases and > 60 kg, respectively. Optical density values did not
   differ between the two types of study areas among seropositive samples
   but were significantly lower among seronegative samples from areas
   without than from areas with clinical cases. No difference was observed
   between the two sampling periods in Switzerland. The revised ELISA
   specificity was 96.8\% (984/1017; 95\% CI: 95.5-97.7) when wild boar
   from areas without history of mange were considered truly negative.
   Conclusions: Seropositivity to S. scabiei is more frequent and occurs
   over a larger geographic range than expected. Data suggest that the
   parasite is endemic within the wild boar populations of Switzerland and
   other European countries but that its presence is not necessarily
   associated with disease occurrence. Extrinsic factors which trigger
   disease emergence in infected populations remain to be investigated. The
   applied ELISA represents a promising tool for future studies.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD MICROBIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread zoonotic parasite with a high
   seroprevalence in the human population and the ability to infect almost
   all warm blooded animals. Humans can acquire toxoplasmosis from
   different transmission routes and food plays a critical role. Within the
   food category, meat is of utmost importance, as it may contain
   bradyzoites inside tissue cysts, which can potentially cause infection
   after ingestion if parasites are not inactivated through freezing or
   cooking before consumption. In Italy, the most commonly consumed meat
   producing animal species are bovines and pigs. However, T. gondii
   prevalence and consumption habits for meat of these animal species are
   very different. There is debate within the scientific community
   concerning which of these animal species is the main source of
   meat-derived human toxoplasmosis. The aim of this work was to build a
   quantitative risk assessment model to estimate the yearly probability of
   acquiring toxoplasmosis infection due to consumption of bovine meat and
   pork (excluding cured products) in Italy, taking into account the
   different eating habits. The model was fitted with data obtained from
   the literature regarding: bradyzoite concentrations, portion size,
   dose-response relation, prevalence of T. gondii in bovines and swine,
   meat consumption and meat preparation habits. Alternative handling
   scenarios were considered. The model estimated the risk per year of
   acquiring T. gondii infection in Italy from bovine and swine meat to be
   0.034\% and 0.019\%, respectively. Results suggest that, due to existing
   eating habits, bovine meat can be a not negligible source of
   toxoplasmosis in Italy.},

Title = {Ticks are more suitable than red foxes for monitoring zoonotic
   tick-borne pathogens in northeastern Italy},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {Background: Northeastern Italy is a hotspot for several tick-borne
   pathogens, transmitted to animals and humans mainly by Ixodes ricinus.
   Here we compare the results of molecular monitoring of ticks and
   zoonotic TBPs over a six-year period, with the monitoring of red foxes
   (Vulpes vulpes) in an endemic area.
   Results: In the period 2011-2016, 2,578 ticks were collected in 38 sites
   of 20 municipalities of Belluno Province. Individual adults (264),
   pooled larvae (n = 330) and nymphs (n = 1984) were screened for
   tick-borne encephalitis virus, Borrelia burgdorferi (s.l.), Rickettsia
   spp., Babesia spp., Anaplasma phagocytophilum and ``Candidatus
   Neoehrlichia mikurensis{''} by specific SYBR green real-time PCR assays
   and sequencing. The spleens of 97 foxes, culled in the period 2015-2017
   during sport hunting or population control programs, were also screened.
   Overall, nine different pathogens were found in I. ricinus nymph and
   adult ticks: Rickettsia helvetica (3.69\%); R. monacensis (0.49\%); four
   species of the B. burgdorferi (s. l.) complex {[}B. afzelii (1.51\%); B.
   burgdorferi (s. s.) (1.25\%); B. garinii (0.18\%); and B. valaisiana
   (0.18\%)]; A. phagocytophilum (3.29\%); ``Candidatus N. mikurensis{''}
   (1.73\%); and Babesia venatorum (0.04\%). Larvae were collected and
   screened in the first year only and two pools (0.6\%) were positive for
   R. helvetica. Tick-borne encephalitis virus was not found in ticks
   although human cases do occur in the area. The rate of infection in
   ticks varied widely according to tick developmental stage, site and year
   of collection. As expected, adults were the most infected, with 27.6\%
   harboring at least one pathogen compared to 7.3\% of nymphs. Pathogens
   with a minimum infection rate above 1\% were recorded every year. None
   of the pathogens found in ticks were detectable in the foxes, 52 (54\%)
   of which were instead positive for Babesia cf. microti (also referred to
   as Babesia microti-like, ``Theileria annae{''}, ``Babesia annae{''} and
   ``Babesia vulpes{''}).
   Conclusions: The results show that foxes cannot be used as sentinel
   animals to monitor tick-borne pathogens in the specific epidemiological
   context of northeastern Italy. The high prevalence of Babesia cf.
   microti in foxes and its absence in ticks strongly suggests that I.
   ricinus is not the vector of this pathogen.},

Abstract = {Background: Cats can be carriers of infected arthropods and be infected
   with several vector-borne pathogens (VBP) but there is limited knowledge
   about their pathogenic role in cats.
   Results: A cross-sectional controlled study investigated the clinical
   status and antibody (Bartonella henselae, Rickettsia conorii, Ehrlichia

   indoor cats treated against ectoparasites (control group {[}CG], n = 63)
   were enrolled. Clinical data and retroviral co-infections were compared
   between the two groups. Multivariable analysis tested associations

   Co-infections were confirmed in about one-third of the cats and were
   more frequent in SG cats. Molecular and overall (antibody and PCR)
   positivity to Bartonella and antibody positivity to R. conorii were
   higher in SG. Multivariable analysis found significant associations of
   Bartonella spp. infection with Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV)
   infection and increased globulins, and of Mycoplasma spp. infection with
   adult age, FIV infection, anaemia, and increased creatinine.
   Conclusions: A very high prevalence of exposure to zoonotic VBP was
   found in cats, with Rickettsia and Bartonella infections being most
   prevalent. Some risk factors were documented namely for Mycoplasma spp.
   and Bartonella spp. The lifestyle of cats is clinically relevant and
   requires specific preventative measures to protect their health.},

Title = {First detection of Borrelia miyamotoi in Ixodes ricinus ticks from
   northern Italy},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {Background: Borrelia miyamotoi is a spirochete transmitted by several
   ixodid tick species. It causes a relapsing fever in humans and is
   currently considered as an emerging pathogen. In Europe, B. miyamotoi
   seems to occur at low prevalence in Ixodes ricinus ticks but has a wide
   distribution. Here we report the first detection of B. miyamotoi in
   Ixodes ricinus ticks collected in two independent studies conducted in
   2016 in the north-eastern and north-western Alps, Italy.
   Results: Three out of 405 nymphs (0.74\%) tested positive for Borrelia
   miyamotoi. In particular, B. miyamotoi was found in 2/365 nymphs in the
   western and in 1/40 nymphs in the eastern alpine area. These are the
   first findings of B. miyamotoi in Italy.
   Conclusions: Exposure to B. miyamotoi and risk of human infection may
   occur through tick bites in northern Italy. Relapsing fever caused by
   Borrelia miyamotoi has not yet been reported in Italy, but misdiagnoses
   with tick-borne encephalitis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis or other
   relapsing fever can occur. Our findings suggest that B. miyamotoi should
   be considered in the differential diagnosis of febrile patients
   originating from Lyme borreliosis endemic regions. The distribution of
   this pathogen and its relevance to public health need further
   investigation.},

Title = {Isoquercetin as an Adjunct Therapy in Patients With Kidney Cancer
   Receiving First-Line Sunitinib (QUASAR): Results of a Phase I Trial},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAR 16},
Abstract = {Sunitinib is the most commonly prescribed drug for advanced renal cell
   carcinoma in the first-line setting and has been associated with
   multiple adverse events related to its on-and off-target effects,
   including hand and foot syndrome and fatigue. It was hypothesized that
   sunitinib-induced fatigue may be related to off target inhibition of the
   AMPK enzyme, which results in impairment of energy-producing processes
   at a systemic level. Quercetin is a naturally occurring flavonol with
   established AMPK-stimulating activity. While clinical use of quercetin
   is limited by its poor bio-availability,
   quercetin-3-O-b-d-glucopyranoside, that is isoquercetin, has an improved
   pharmacokinetic profile. On the grounds of the in vitro stimulatory
   activity with respect to AMPk, we hypothesized that oral isoquercetin
   could improve fatigue in kidney cancer patients receiving sunitinib.
   Given the lack of data on the safety of isoquercetin given concomitantly
   with sunitinib, we conducted a phase I trial to assess the safety of GMP
   manufactured isoquercetin given at two dose levels (450 and 900mg a
   day). In the 12-patient study cohort included in this study,
   isoquercetin was administered concomitantly with 50mg sunitinib for a
   median 81 days (IQR, 75.5, 86.5). None of the 12 patients required
   isoquercetin suspension or isoquercetin dose reduction because of
   adverse events. No abnormalities in ECG, heart or lower limbs doppler
   ultrasound were detected. A statistically significant improvement was
   reported for the FACIT fatigue score (6.8 points; 95\% CI: 2.8-10.8; p =
   0.002) and for the FACIT Adverse Events score (18.9 points; 95\% CI:
   9.1-28.8; p < 0.001) after isoquercetin consumption vs. baseline. In
   this phase I trial, isoquercetin was remarkably safe, with a preliminary
   signal of activity in terms of improvement of sunitinib adverse events.},

Abstract = {The near-complete genomic sequences of two hepatitis E virus (HEV)

   FR-SHEV3c-like detected in 2006 (p-distance value 0.101), belonging to
   HEV-3 but not assigned to any known subtype. The three HEV sequences
   showed, relatively high nucleotide distances (p-distance > 0.129)
   compared to the other defined HEV subtype references and unclassified
   strains. The HEV classification criteria and the high sequence
   similarity suggest that these strains can be assigned to a putative
   novel subtype of genotype 3, HEV-31.},

Title = {A cross-sectional study to identify a set of risk factors for caprine
   herpesvirus 1 infection},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},
Month = {MAR 14},
Abstract = {Background: Caprine herpesvirus 1 (CpHV-1) causes neonatal mortality and
   reproductive failure in goats. Despite its impact on herd reproductive
   performance, few studies have investigated the risk factors associated
   with CpHV-1 infection. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to
   identify potential herd-and host-level risk factors associated with
   CpHV-1 prevalence in a goat population with heterogeneous seropositivity
   for CpHV-1.
   Results: Blood samples and individual data from 4542 goats were
   collected from 255 herds in Piedmont, Italy. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent
   assay (ELISA) and serum neutralization tests were carried out to detect
   antibodies against CpHV-1. A mixed-effects model was applied to identify
   any statistical association between CpHV-1 seropositivity and a set of
   putative host-level and herd-level risk factors. A total of 630 samples
   tested were found positive by ELISA (prevalence = 13.9\%; 95\%
   confidence interval (CI) 12.9-14.9). Of the 255 tested herds, 85 were
   classified as positive for the presence of at least one gB-positive
   animal (herd prevalence 33.3\%, 95\% CI 27.5-39.2), with a within-herd
   prevalence between 0.7 and 100\% (Q1 = 17.6\%; median = 32.3\%; Q3 =
   50\%) (Q = quartiles). The prevalence ratios showed a statistical
   association with the following risk factors: breeds other than Saanen,
   older age, larger herd size, meat and extensive herds, and co-existence
   of CAEV-infected animals.
   Conclusions: Results from this cross sectional study may help to
   elucidate the natural history of the infection and inform targeted
   strategies to control a disease with a potentially important impact on
   animal health and goat farming economy.},

Abstract = {In May 2016, two separate clusters of febrile gastroenteritis caused by
   Listeria monocytogenes were detected by the local health authority in
   Piedmont, in northern Italy. We carried out epidemiological,
   microbiological and traceback investigations to identify the source. The
   people affected were students and staff members from two different
   schools in two different villages located in the Province of Turin; five
   of them were hospitalised. The epidemiological investigation identified
   a cooked beef ham served at the school canteens as the source of the
   food-borne outbreak. L. monocytogenes was isolated from the food, the
   stools of the hospitalised pupils and the environment of the factory
   producing the cooked beef ham. All isolates except one were serotype
   1/2a, shared an indistinguishable PFGE pattern and were 100\% identical
   by whole genome sequencing (WGS). By combining a classical
   epidemiological approach with both molecular subtyping and WGS
   techniques, we were able to identify and confirm a Listeria
   gastroenteritis outbreak associated with consumption of sliced cold beef
   ham.},

Title = {Predicting the impact of selection for scrapie resistance on PRNP
   genotype frequencies in goats},
Journal = {VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {49},
Month = {MAR 6},
Abstract = {The European Union has implemented breeding programmes to increase
   scrapie resistance in sheep. A similar approach can be applied also in
   goats since the K222 allele provides a level of resistance equivalent to
   that of ARR in sheep. The European Food Safety Authority stated that
   breeding for resistance could be offered as an option for Member States
   to control classical scrapie in goats. We assessed the impact of
   different breeding strategies on PRNP genotype frequencies using a
   mathematical model that describes in detail the evolution of K222 in two
   goat breeds, Chamois Coloured and Saanen. Different patterns of age
   structure and replacement rate were modelled as factors affecting
   response to selection. Breeding for scrapie resistance can be
   implemented in goats, even though the initial K222 frequencies in these
   breeds are not particularly favourable and the rate at which the
   resistant animals increase, both breeding and slaughtered for meat
   production, is slow. If the goal is not to achieve the fixation of
   resistance allele, it is advisable to carry out selection only until a
   desired frequency of K222-carriers has been attained. Nucleus selection
   vs. selection on the overall populations is less expensive but takes
   longer to reach the desired output. The programme performed on the two
   goat breeds serves as a model of the response the selection could have
   in other breeds that show different initial frequencies and population
   structure. In this respect, the model has a general applicability.},

Title = {Assessing the Influence of Vegan, Vegetarian and Omnivore Oriented
   Westernized Dietary Styles on Human Gut Microbiota: A Cross Sectional
   Study},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAR 5},
Abstract = {Diet and lifestyle have a strong influence on gut microbiota, which in
   turn has important implications on a variety of health-related aspects.
   Despite great advances in the field, it remains unclear to which extent
   the composition of the gut microbiota is modulated by the intake of
   animal derived products, compared to a vegetable based diet. Here the
   specific impact of vegan, vegetarian, and omnivore feeding type on the
   composition of gut microbiota of 101 adults was investigated among
   groups homogeneous for variables known to have a role in modulating gut
   microbial composition such as age, anthropometric variables, ethnicity,
   and geographic area. The results displayed a picture where the three
   different dietetic profiles could be well distinguished on the basis of
   participant's dietetic regimen. Regarding the gut microbiota;
   vegetarians had a significantly greater richness compared to omnivorous.
   Moreover, counts of Bacteroidetes related operational taxonomic units
   (OTUs) were greater in vegans and vegetarians compared to omnivores.
   Interestingly considering the whole bacterial community composition the
   three cohorts were unexpectedly similar, which is probably due to their
   common intake in terms of nutrients rather than food, e.g., high fat
   content and reduced protein and carbohydrate intake. This finding
   suggests that fundamental nutritional choices such as vegan, vegetarian,
   or omnivore do influence the microbiota but do not allow to infer
   conclusions on gut microbial composition, and suggested the possibility
   for a preferential impact of other variables, probably related to the
   general life style on shaping human gut microbial community in spite of
   dietary influence. Consequently, research were individuals are
   categorized on the basis of their claimed feeding types is of limited
   use for scientific studies, since it appears to be oversimplified.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAR 5},
Abstract = {The diagnosis of dourine can be difficult because the clinical signs of
   this disease in horses are similar to those of surra, caused by
   Trypanosoma evansi. Moreover, T equiperdum and T evansi are closely
   related and, so far, they cannot be distinguished using serological
   tests. In a previous work, the T equiperdum protein pattern recognized
   by antibodies from dourine-infected horses and the humoral immune
   response kinetics were investigated by immunoblotting assay; a total of
   20 sera from naturally and experimentally infected horses and from
   healthy animals were tested. lmmunoblotting analysis showed that
   antibodies from infected horses specifically bind T equiperdum low
   molecular weight proteins (from 16 to 35 kDa), which are not recognized
   by antibodies from uninfected horses. In this work, we tested other 615
   sera (7 from naturally infected horses and 608 sera from healthy horses
   and donkeys): results confirmed the data obtained previously. In
   addition, six SDS-PAGE bands with molecular weight ranging from 10 to 37
   kDa were analyzed by mass spectrometry, in order to identify immunogenic
   proteins that could be used as biomarkers for the diagnosis of dourine.
   A total of 167 proteins were identified. Among them, 37 were found
   unique for T equiperdum. Twenty-four of them could represent possible
   candidate diagnostic antigens for the development of serological tests
   specific for T equiperdum.},

Title = {Development of an Injectable Slow-Release Metformin Formulation and

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAR 2},
Abstract = {Metformin is an antidiabetic drug which possesses antiproliferative
   activity in cancer cells when administered at high doses, due to its
   unfavorable pharmacokinetics. The aim of this work was to develop a
   pharmacological tool for the release of metformin in proximity of the
   tumor, allowing high local concentrations, and to demonstrate the in
   vivo antitumor efficacy after a prolonged metformin exposition. A 1.2\%
   w/w metformin thermoresponsive parenteral formulation based on
   poloxamers P407 and P124, injectable at room temperature and undergoing
   a sol-gel transition at body temperature, has been developed and
   optimized for rheological, thermal and release control properties; the
   formulation is easily scalable, and proved to be stable during a 1-month
   storage at 5 degrees C. Using NOD/SCID mice pseudo-orthotopically
   grafted with MDA-MB-231/luc(+) human breast cancer cells, we report that
   multiple administrations of 100 mg of the optimized metformin
   formulation close to the tumor site cause tissue accumulation of the
   drug at levels significantly higher than those observed in plasma, and
   enough to exert antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activities. Our
   results demonstrate that this formulation is endowed with good
   stability, tolerability, thermal and rheological properties,
   representing a novel tool to be pursued in further investigations for
   adjuvant cancer treatment.},

Abstract = {Oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a common finding in domestic and
   wild felids. Only two cases of oral SCC have been reported in Lynx
   species (Lynx rufus and Lynx canadensis), at mandibular and gingival
   sites. In this study, we describe the first report of tongue SCC in a 15
   years old female European lynx (Lynx lynx), along with viral
   investigations. Necropsy and histological analysis were performed and
   the presence of papillomavirus (PV) infection was investigated by
   ultrastructural and molecular methods. The lardaceous mass at tongue
   level was histologically diagnosed as moderately differentiated SCC.
   Typical microscopical features of SCC were also found in the
   retropharyngeal lymph node and at the pulmonary level. Neither viral DNA
   by PCR, nor viral particles by transmission electron microscopy were
   found. Despite that PV infection is associated with Felidae, this work
   reports the first description of tongue SCC in Lynx species, but no
   evidence of PV infection, suggesting that PV may not be involved in
   development of SCC in bobcat species.},

   through 2016. The 118 samples were collected on the production line or
   during feed distribution and storage to determine the sampling sites at
   major risk of cross-contamination. For determination of nonionophoric
   coccidiostats, a fast, easy, and cheap method was developed and
   validated. Feed samples were extracted with acetonitrile-methanol and
   directly injected for liquid chromatography with tandem mass
   spectrometry. A total of 24 samples (20.3\%) were positive, but only 5
   (4.2\%) of these samples exceeded the maximum limit set by European
   legislation. Most of the positive samples were collected from a batch of
   feed produced immediately following processing of another batch to which
   the coccidiostat robenidine had been added.},

Abstract = {Cell-based therapy holds great promise for tendon disorders, a
   widespread debilitating musculoskeletal condition. Even if the cell line
   remains to be defined, preliminary evidences have proven that
   amniotic-derived cells possess in vitro and in vivo a great tenogenic
   potential. This study investigated the efficacy of transplanted human
   amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) by testing their early regenerative
   properties and mechanisms involved on a validated ovine Achilles tendon
   partial defect performed on 29 animals. The injured tendons treated with
   hAECs recovered rapidly, in 28days, structural and biomechanical
   properties undertaking a programmed tissue regeneration, differently
   from the spontaneous healing tissues. hAECs remained viable within the
   host tendons establishing with the endogenous progenitor cells an active
   dialogue. Through the secretion of modulatory factors, hAECs inhibited
   the inflammatory cells infiltration, activated the M2 macrophage
   subpopulation early recruitment, and accelerated blood vessel as well as
   extracellular matrix remodelling. In parallel, some in situ
   differentiated hAECs displayed a tenocytelike phenotype. Both paracrine
   and direct hAECs stimulatory effects were confirmed analysing their
   genome profile before and after transplantation. The 49 human
   up-regulated transcripts recorded in transplanted hAECs belonged to
   tendon lineage differentiation (epithelial-mesenchymal transition,
   connective specific matrix components, and skeleton or muscle system
   development-related transcripts), as well as the in situ activation of
   paracrine signalling involved in inflammatory and immunomodulatory
   response. Altogether, these evidences support the hypothesis that hAECs
   are a practicable and efficient strategy for the acute treatment of
   tendinopathy, reinforcing the idea of a concrete use of amniotic
   epithelial cells towards the clinical practice.},

Abstract = {Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is circulating in cattle in
   Europe. Although vaccination helps control the disease, its prevalence
   within and among herds remains high. Previous genetic characterization
   studies revealed a strict geographic correlation between viral variants;
   on the other hand, they showed the emergence of new variants in northern
   Europe. Few studies have described BRSV distribution, and little is
   known about the genetic features of BRSV strains circulating in Italy.
   We studied sample-positive tests for BRSV, and sequenced the coding
   regions of the G and N proteins to determine the presence of divergent
   variants. Two different sets of sequences were found, including in
   samples from animals from vaccinated herds. The 2 groups of sequences
   correspond to 2 time periods and suggest an active role of herd immunity
   in preventing the spread of infection. Our findings that different
   strains of BRSV are circulating in Italy and that the virus is evolving
   rapidly highlight the importance of updating vaccination strategies.},

Abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the evolution of the pathogen Mayaro virus,
   causing Mayaro fever (a mosquito-borne disease) and to perform selective
   pressure analysis and homology modelling. Methods: Nine different
   datasets were built, one for each protein (from protein C to
   non-structural protein 4) and the last one for the complete genome.
   Selective pressure and homology modelling analyses were applied.
   Results: Two main clades (A and B) were pointed in the maximum
   likelihood tree. The clade A included five Brazilian sequences sampled
   from 1955 to 2015. The Brazilian sequence sampled in 2014 significantly
   clustered with the Haitian sequence sampled in 2015. The clade B
   included the remaining 27 sequences sampled in the Central and Southern
   America from 1957 to 2013. Selective pressure analysis revealed several
   sites under episodic diversifying selection in envelope surface
   glycoprotein E1, non-structural protein 1 and nonstructural protein 3
   with a posterior probability P <= 0.01. Homology modelling showed
   different sites modified by selective pressure and some protein-protein
   interaction sites at high interaction propensity. Conclusion: Maximum
   likelihood analysis confirmed the Mayaro virus previous circulation in
   Haiti and the successful spread to the Caribbean and USA. Selective
   pressure analysis revealed a strong presence of negatively selected
   sites, suggesting a probable purging of deleterious polymorphisms in
   functional genes. Homology model showed the position 31, under selective
   pressure, located in the edge of the ADP-ribose binding site predicting
   to possess a high potential of protein-protein interaction and
   suggesting the possible chance for a protective vaccine, thus preventing
   Mayaro virus urbanization as with Chikungunya virus.},

Abstract = {Sardinia is a hotspot for studying tick-borne diseases in the
   Mediterranean region, where cases of notifiable tick-borne diseases are
   increasing. The aim of this study was to determine the presence of
   tick-borne bacteria of medical and veterinary importance in ixodid ticks
   collected from domestic and wild animals, humans, and vegetation from
   different collection sites in Sardinia. Using standard PCR and
   sequencing techniques, the presence of Rickettsia, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia,
   and Bartonella species, as well as Coxiella burnetii was evaluated. A
   total of 1619 ticks were morphologically identified as Rhipicephalus
   sanguineus sensu lato, R. bursa, R. annulatus, Dermacentor marginatus,
   Haemaphysalis punctata, Ha. sulcata, Hyalomma lusitanicum, H.
   marginatum, Ixodes festai (sometimes referred to erroneously as I.
   ventalloi), and Argas reflexus. Results indicated the presence of
   several circulating pathogens in Sardinian ticks. DNA of Rickettsia
   species was detected in 58 out of 1619 (4\%) belonging to R. sanguineus
   s.l., D. marginatus, Ha. punctata, H. marginatum, and I. festai species.
   Ehrlichia canis DNA was detected in 33 out of 1619 ticks (2\%) belonging
   to R. sanguineus s.l., R. bursa, and Ha. punctata species. A total of 61
   out of 1619 (4\%) ticks (R. sanguineus s.l., R. bursa, Ha. punctata, and
   I. festai) tested positive for Anaplasma spp. Coxiella burnetii was
   detected in 21 out of 1619 (1\%) ticks belonging to R. sanguineus s.l.,
   R. bursa, R. annulatus, and H. marginatum species. Five R. sanguineus
   s.l. and one R. bursa ticks were positive for the presence of Bartonella
   sp. 16S rRNA gene. Our findings expand the knowledge on tick-borne
   microorganism repertoires and tick distribution in Sardinia. Tick
   distribution should be monitored for effective control of these
   arthropods and the infections they transmit.},

Abstract = {Currently, although the prevalence of brucellosis in Kazakhstan remains
   high, there are limited data available on the genetic diversity of
   circulating Brucella strains. Here, MLVA was employed to genotype a
   panel of 102 Brucella isolates collected from eight Kazakh regions and
   neighboring countries (Russia, Kyrgyzstan) during the period 1935-2017.
   MLVA-11 analysis classified 64 B. abortus strains into genotypes 72, 82,
   331, 71, 341 and 69, while one genotype was novel, having no
   correspondence within the MLVA international database. MLVA-11 analysis
   of 37 B. melitensis strains showed 100\% identity with genotypes 116,
   114 and 11. One B. suis strain was classified into genotype 33.
   Phylogeography based on MLVA-15 demonstrated that all B. abortus and B.
   melitensis strains belonged to ``Abortus C{''} and ``East
   Mediterranean{''} lineages, respectively. B. abortus strains from
   Kazakhstan and Russia resulted genetically related to Portuguese,
   Brazilian and US isolates, suggesting ancient spread of these lineages
   from Europe westwards to South America and eastwards to Turkey, Russia
   and Asia. Most of Kazakh B. melitensis isolates were related to strains
   circulating in China, likely due to long-term trading partnerships
   between the two countries.
   In fine-scale MLVA-15 analysis, 17 B. abortus and 12 B. melitensis
   genotypes were identified; among them 12 are novel. Interestingly,
   epidemiological information supporting molecular data were retrieved for
   two clusters within the B. abortus group, thus proving that MLVA is an
   appropriate tool for effective traceback analyses. Our findings suggest
   that molecular genotyping should be applied systematically to support
   control plans for eradication of brucellosis in Kazakhstan.},

Abstract = {Parasites are among the most common pathogens recorded in dogs. High
   prevalence rates are usually reported in stray and shelter dogs, as
   these animals are less likely to be tested and treated. In this study a
   survey was carried out on intestinal and lung parasites of stray dogs at
   the moment of the admission in a shelter in Central Italy. In the period
   June 2014-June 2015, 262 individual faecal samples were examined. Twelve
   parasitic taxa were detected. Helminths were more prevalent than
   protozoa (61.8\% and 25.6\%, respectively). Ancylostomatidae showed the
   higher prevalence (40.5\%), followed by Giardia duodenalis (21.4\%),
   Toxocara canis (20.6\%) and Trichuris vulpis (17.6\%). Angiostrongylus
   vasorum was the most prevalent lungworm (12.6\%), Crenosoma vulpis being
   recorded just in one dog. G. duodenalis had a high prevalence, probably
   because of the diagnostic techniques adopted, actually the most
   sensitive available for its detection. Nevertheless, the zoonotic
   potential of this parasite in dogs appears reduced, as all the isolates
   were identified as C (24.0\%) and D (76.0\%) dog specific assemblages.
   Taeniidae constituted a high potential zoonotic risk, as from the eggs
   it is impossible to exclude they were Echinococcus granulosus, the most
   relevant zoonotic parasite in Europe. The present study underline the
   importance of stray dogs control, aimed at preventing or minimizing
   parasitic spread and zoonotic transmission.},

Title = {Highlighting priority areas for bovine viral diarrhea control in Italy:
   A phylogeographic approach},

Abstract = {The prevalence and genetic diversity of bovine viral diarrhea virus
   (BVDV) in a geographic area are largely influenced by live animal trade
   and management practices. Despite control and eradication programs
   currently underway in several European countries, the risk of BVDV
   spread within and among countries is still present. BVDV-1 is the
   predominant type circulating in European cattle population. In this
   study, a phylogeographic analysis was applied to the BVDV-1 highest
   prevalent subtypes in Italy to reconstruct the origin and
   spatial-temporal distribution and to trace main viral flows between
   different locations to highlight priority areas for BVDV control. A
   comprehensive dataset of BVDV-1b (n = 173) and 1e (n = 172) 5' UTR
   sequences was analysed, including both novel and published sequences
   from Italy and from European countries bordering and/or with commercial
   cattle flows with Italy. A common phylogeographic pattern was observed
   for BVDV-1b and 1e subtypes: interspersion from multiple Italian areas
   and European countries was widespread until the end of the last century,
   whereas significant local clusters were observed starting from 2000.
   These findings support a continuous viral flow among different areas
   over long time scales with no evidence of significant geographical
   structure, while local transmission networks are limited to more recent
   years. Northern Italy has been confirmed as the area of origin of the
   main clades of both BVDV subtypes at national level, acting both as a
   crucial area for introduction and a maintenance source for other areas.
   Piedmont, Central and Southern Italian regions contributed to limited
   geographical distribution and local BVDV-1b and 1e persistence. On the
   whole, priority control measures for BVDV-1b and 1e in Italy should be
   focused on: i) implementation of BVDV systematic control in all Northern
   Italian regions to break the viral flow from larger to smaller animal
   populations; and ii) breaking the dynamics of infections in regions with
   self-maintenance of BVDV by voluntary control programs.},

Title = {A highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus
   type 1 (PRRSV-1) strongly modulates cellular innate and adaptive immune
   subsets upon experimental infection},
Journal = {VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {216},

Abstract = {Highly pathogenic (HP) PRRSV isolates have been discovered within both
   PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 genotypes and investigated in recent years
   especially for their ability to cause extremely severe disease in
   conventional pig herds. The exacerbation of general and respiratory
   clinical signs has been attributed not only to an efficient replication
   (virulence) but also to the ability to dysregulate viral recognition and
   induce mechanisms of immune evasion or immune enhancement of humoral and
   cellular anti-viral responses differently from non-HP PRRSV isolates in
   terms of intensity and temporal onset. Thus, the understanding of the
   immunopathogenesis of HP PRRSV is a major concern for the study of virus
   biology and development of efficacious vaccines. The present study aims
   at addressing the modulation of relevant immune cell subsets by flow
   cytometry in the blood of 4 week-old pigs experimentally infected with
   the recently discovered PR40/2014 HP PRRSV-1.1 strain phenotypically
   characterized in Canelli et al. (2017) compared to pigs infected with a
   non-HP PRRSV isolate (PR11/2014) and uninfected controls. PR40 infected
   animals showed an early and marked reduction of pro-inflammatory CD172
   alpha+ CD14 + CD16 + and CD14 + CD163 + monocytes and TCR8 gamma delta +
   CD8 alpha + /CD8 alpha- lymphocytes when pigs were most infected,
   possibly due to a recruitment sustaining an acute inflammatory response
   in target tissues. The prolonged increased CD3 + CD16 + NKT cell levels
   may sustain peripheral inflammation and/or the anti-viral response. The
   late reduction (potential depletion) of gamma/delta T lymphocytes and
   CD3 + CD4 + CD8 alpha- nave Th lymphocytes paralleled with the delayed
   increase of CD3 + CD4 + CD8 alpha + memory and CD3 + CD4-CD8 alpha/beta
   + cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In addition, PR40 infection showed an early
   depletion of activated CD4 + CD25 + T lymphocytes and Tregs together
   with an intense and lasting depletion of CD21 + B lymphocytes. Overall,
   these features demonstrate that the more severe clinical signs observed
   upon infection with the HP PR40 strain are sustained by remarkable
   changes in the peripheral blood distribution of immune cells and provide
   further insights into the immune regulation/immunopathogenesis induced
   by PRRSV-1 subtype 1 European isolates.},

Abstract = {The complex life cycle of taeniids represents an ideal model of a
   multi-host system. The complexity of these parasites can therefore cover
   the epidemiological issues of the interface between wild and domestic
   animals, especially once spatial overlap between wild and domestic
   definitive and intermediate hosts occurs. Here we use the occurrence of
   Taenia ovis krabbei in two model areas as an example of this
   epidemiological complexity. In two contiguous areas in the Italian
   northern Apennines, two hunted roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) showed
   numerous cysticerci in the muscles of their whole body and an adult
   tapeworm was recorded in a semi-stray dog (Canis lupus familiaris).
   Through molecular typing of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I
   (cox1) gene, cysticerci and the adult tapeworm of T. krabbei were
   identified. Taenia krabbei cysticercosis was recorded for the first time
   in Italy. Although the role of dogs in the parasite's life cycle
   emerges, the overlap between wild and domestic definitive hosts and the
   increase of wild population densities raise concerns about the temporal
   (old or new) introduction and the spread of this parasite by one of
   these canid species (wolf (Canis lupus) or dog). Although T. krabbei is
   not a public health issue, economic concerns emerged for hunters and
   meat producers, related to the damage of carcasses by cysticerci.
   Therefore, there is a need to evaluate the spread of T. krabbei in the
   intermediate and definitive host populations, and to ensure the relevant
   sanitary education for hunters in order to avoid practices that could
   favour the spread and maintenance of its life cycle.},

Abstract = {In a market undergoing constant evolution, the production of chicken
   meat that consumers would perceive as ``natural{''} and ``animal
   friendly{''} is crucial. The use of probiotics in rurally reared
   chickens could represent a major opportunity to achieve mutual benefit
   for both the industry and consumers. A total of 264 male Kabir chicks
   were randomly distributed to one of 2 dietary treatments: the L group
   received a commercial feed supplemented with 2.0 g/100 kg of
   Lactobacillus acidophilus D2/CSL, while the C group received the same
   basal diet without the additive. To assess the effects of probiotic
   supplementation in the chickens' diet, productive performance was
   evaluated at d 21 and 42, whereas microbiological analyses of the
   intestinal content and intestinal histology and morphometry were
   performed at the end of the trial (d 42). At d 21 and 42, L birds showed
   better (P < 0.001) performance in terms of body weight, average daily
   gain, and feed conversion ratio. Enterococci, staphylococci, and
   Escherichia coli populations were not influenced by dietary treatment.
   On the contrary, Lactobacillus population increased (P = 0.032) in the L
   group. Furthermore, a tendency (P = 0.069) was observed for the
   coliforms to be influenced by diet, with lower values in the L group in
   comparison to the C group. Histological techniques revealed that the
   number of goblet cell containing neutral mucins was lower in the C
   group. Morphometric evaluations demonstrated that the probiotic
   supplementation increased the height of the mucosal layer by improving
   (P = 0.040) villus height, while crypt depth was unaffected. In
   conclusion, the results obtained in this study demonstrate that it is
   possible to use Lactobacillus acidophilus D2/CSL (CECT 4529) in rurally
   reared chicken breeds with positive effects on performance and gut
   health.},

Title = {Interaction of porcine monocyte-derived dendritic cells with African

Abstract = {African swine fever (ASF) is a devastating disease for which there is no
   vaccine. The ASF virus (ASFV) can infect dendritic cell (DC), but
   despite the critical role these cells play in induction of adaptive
   immunity, few studies investigated their response to ASFV infection. We
   characterized the in vitro interactions of porcine monocyte-derived DCs
   (moDC) with a virulent (22653/14), a low virulent (NH/P68) and an
   avirulent (BA71V) ASFV strain. At a high multiplicity of infection (MOI
   = 1), all three strains infected immature moDC. Maturation of moDC, with
   IFN-alpha/TNF-alpha, increased susceptibility to infection with 22653/14
   and other virulent strains, but reduced susceptibility to NH/P68 and
   BA71V. The reduced moDC susceptibility to BA71V/NH/P68 was IFN-alpha
   mediated, whereas increased susceptibility to 22653/14 was induced by
   TNF-alpha. Using an MOI of 0.01, we observed that BA71V replicated less
   efficiently in moDC compared to the other isolates and we detected
   increased replication of NH/P68 compared to 22653/14. We observed that
   BA71V and NH/P68, but not 22653/ 14, downregulated expression of MHC
   class I on infected cells. All three strains decreased CD16 expression
   on moDC, whereas ASFV infection resulted in CD80/86 down-regulation and
   MHC class II DR up-regulation on mature moDC. None of the tested strains
   induced a strong cytokine response to ASFV and only modest IL-1 alpha
   was released after BA71V infection. Overall our results revealed
   differences between strains and suggest that ASFV has evolved mechanisms
   to replicate covertly in inflammatory DC, which likely impairs the
   induction of an effective immune response.},

Title = {A LC-HRMS After QuEChERS Cleanup Method for the Rapid Determination of

Volume = {11},

Abstract = {The reliability of a rapid LC-HRMS method was studied in order to find a
   sensitive and accurate, simple, cheap, and rapid method for screening
   and quantitative determination of malachite green (MG), leucomalachite
   green (LMG), brilliant green (BG), crystal violet (CV), and leucocrystal
   violet (LCV) in fish muscle. All the analytes were extracted using a
   mixture of acetonitrile and citrate buffer, while the cleanup phase was
   carried out by Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe
   (QuEChERS) method. All the data analyzed were acquired using both full
   MS and dd-MS2 modes. Good specificity, precision (relative standard
   deviation <11\% for each sample tested), recovery (10-60\%), decision
   limit (CC alpha between 0.55 and 0.62 mu g kg(-1)), detection
   capabilities (CC beta between 0.65 and 0.78 mu g kg(-1)), and ruggedness
   were achieved for the reliability of the method. Satisfactory results
   were obtained during the linearity test in the range of 0.10-2 ng mL(-1)
   (r(2) > 0.999). Best recoveries were obtained by the QuEChERS cleanup
   method for all the analytes examined, presenting values between 70 and
   104\%. The application of 70,000 FWHM mass resolution and narrow mass
   windows significantly improved the selectivity of the method, leading to
   simultaneous screening and quantification of dye residues in comparison
   to other methods proposed in literature. The optimized method proposed
   in this work enables a simple and fast preparation; it offers
   exceptional sensitivity and selectivity and maximizes efficiency and
   reproducibility with a low consumption of reagents. Finally, the present
   method was successfully employed to detect dye residues in 73 fish
   samples, as provided for the national residue control plan.},

Journal = {INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {58},
Pages = {279-289},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been documented in almost every species of bat
   sampled. Bat CoVs exhibit both extensive genetic diversity and a broad
   geographic range, indicative of a long-standing host association.
   Despite this, the respective roles of long-term virus-host co-divergence
   and cross-species transmission (host-jumping) in the evolution of bat
   coronaviruses are unclear. Using a phylogenetic approach we provide
   evidence that CoV diversity in bats is shaped by both species richness
   and their geographical distribution, and that CoVs exhibit clustering at
   the level of bat genera, with these genus-specific clusters largely
   associated with distinct CoV species. Co-phylogenetic analyses revealed
   that cross-species transmission has been more common than co-divergence
   across coronavirus evolution as a whole, and that cross-species
   transmission events were more likely between sympatric bat hosts.
   Notably, however, an analysis of the CoV RNA polymerase phylogeny
   suggested that many such host-jumps likely resulted in short-term
   spill-over infections, with little evidence for sustained onward
   transmission in new co-roosting host species.},

Title = {MycoKey Round Table Discussions of Future Directions in Research on
   Chemical Detection Methods, Genetics and Biodiversity of Mycotoxins},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {MycoKey, an EU-funded Horizon 2020 project, includes a series of
   ``Roundtable Discussions{''} to gather information on trending research
   areas in the field of mycotoxicology. This paper includes summaries of
   the Roundtable Discussions on Chemical Detection and Monitoring of
   mycotoxins and on the role of genetics and biodiversity in mycotoxin
   production. Discussions were managed by using the nominal group
   discussion technique, which generates numerous ideas and provides a
   ranking for those identified as the most important. Four questions were
   posed for each research area, as well as two questions that were common
   to both discussions. Test kits, usually antibody based, were one major
   focus of the discussions at the Chemical Detection and Monitoring
   roundtable because of their many favorable features, e.g., cost, speed
   and ease of use. The second area of focus for this roundtable was
   multi-mycotoxin detection protocols and the challenges still to be met
   to enable these protocols to become methods of choice for regulated
   mycotoxins. For the genetic and biodiversity group, both the depth and
   the breadth of trending research areas were notable. For some areas,
   e.g., microbiome studies, the suggested research questions were
   primarily of a descriptive nature. In other areas, multiple experimental
   approaches, e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics, RNAi and gene deletions,
   are needed to understand the regulation of toxin production and
   mechanisms underlying successful biological controls. Answers to the
   research questions will provide starting points for developing
   acceptable prevention and remediation processes. Forging a partnership
   between scientists and appropriately-placed communications experts was
   recognized by both groups as an essential step to communicating risks,
   while retaining overall confidence in the safety of the food supply and
   the integrity of the food production chain.},

Abstract = {Indoor and outdoor winter activity of Culicoides spp. (Diptera:
   Ceratopogonidae) in central Italy was investigated in order to evaluate
   whether indoor activity might account for the overwintering of
   bluetongue virus, as has been hypothesized by some authors. Weekly
   Culicoides collections were performed at three farms over three
   consecutive winter seasons. At each farm, two black-light traps were
   operated simultaneously, indoors and outdoors. Culicoides were
   identified using both morphological and molecular means. The Culicoides
   obsoletus group accounted for 98.2\% of sampled specimens. Within this
   group, C.obsoletus s.s. accounted for 56.8\% and Culicoides scoticus for
   43.2\% of samples. Nulliparous, parous and engorged females were caught
   throughout the entire winter, both indoors and outdoors. At times,
   indoor catch sizes outnumbered outdoor collections. A significant
   inverse correlation was found between minimum temperature and the
   proportion of indoor Culicoides of the total midge catch, thus
   indicating that lower outdoor temperatures drive Culicoides midges
   indoors. High rates of engorged females were recorded indoors, possibly
   as the result of the propensity of C.obsoletus females to feed indoors.
   Higher proportions of parous females were found in indoor than in
   outdoor catches, indicating higher survival rates indoors and,
   consequently, higher vectorial capacities of midges sheltering indoors
   compared with those remaining outdoors.},

Abstract = {Ewe's milk naturally contaminated with afiatoxin M-1 (AFM(1)) at
   0.024-0.117 mu g/kg, was used to produce a semi-hard, ripened, Pecorino
   cheese. A predictive model to estimate the concentration of AFM(1) in
   milk, by considering the values in cheese, was applied; furthermore, an
   AFM(1) concentration in cheese, at different time of ripening, was
   investigated. The regression model showed a high correlation between the
   AFM(1) amount in milk and its concentration in cheese. To establish the
   level of AFM(1) contamination in milk, from taking into account the
   cheese AFM(1) amount, a concentration factor of 4.13, with a confidence
   interval (CI) of 3.80-4.41, was obtained. The concentration index was
   constant during ripening. Thus, the model is a useful tool for the food
   business operator, when the competent authority carries out an official
   control, as prescribed by the European Commission Regulation No.

Abstract = {Canine parvovirus type-2 (CPV-2) is a DNA virus that causes a very
   common worldwide diffused infectious disease in dogs. Since its
   appearance, the CPV-2 evolved generating novel genetic and antigenic
   variants (CPV-2a/2b/2c) which are distributed throughout the world. In
   the present study, the frequency of CPV-2 in a canine population in
   Sicily (Italy) was investigated, using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
   for a fragment of the VP2 gene. Out of a total of 673 samples from 370
   dogs, submitted to the laboratory from July 2009 to August 2015, 265
   samples (39.38\%) were positive and these were further analyzed by
   restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and DNA sequence
   analysis. A high prevalence of the CPV-2c variant (79.56\% of CPV-2
   positive dogs) was observed in this survey, underlining that this type
   of CPV field isolate is prevalent circulating in Sicily. Sequence and
   phylogenetic analysis showed a close relationship with CPV-2a and CPV-2c
   strains from Europe and non-European countries. Considering that CPV-2c
   is reaching a worldwide distribution and that this variant is also
   affecting vaccinated dogs, efforts should be made towards the
   development of new CPV vaccines.},

Abstract = {Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus, strain CV777, was initially
   characterized in 1978 as the causative agent of a disease first
   identified in the UK in 1971. This coronavirus has been widely
   distributed among laboratories and has been passaged both within pigs
   and in cell culture. To determine the variability between different
   stocks of the PEDV strain CV777, sequencing of the full-length genome
   (ca. 28kb) has been performed in 6 different laboratories, using
   different protocols. Not surprisingly, each of the different full genome
   sequences were distinct from each other and from the reference sequence
   (Accession number AF353511) but they are >99\% identical. Unique and
   shared differences between sequences were identified. The coding region
   for the surface-exposed spike protein showed the highest proportion of
   variability including both point mutations and small deletions. The
   predicted expression of the ORF3 gene product was more dramatically
   affected in three different variants of this virus through either loss
   of the initiation codon or gain of a premature termination codon. The
   genome of one isolate had a substantially rearranged 5'-terminal
   sequence. This rearrangement was validated through the analysis of
   sub-genomic mRNAs from infected cells. It is clearly important to know
   the features of the specific sample of CV777 being used for experimental
   studies.},

Abstract = {Vegetables that can be eaten raw in salads are considered at higher risk
   for contamination by foodborne pathogens and pesticide residues. In this
   study fresh leafy green vegetables, both pre-cut and uncut, were sampled
   at retail in all 20 Italian regions and tested for pathogens and
   pesticide residues{''} contamination.
   Both in pre-cut and in uncut vegetables 1.00\% of samples tested
   positive for pathogens investigated. Pesticide residues were detected in
   53.33\% of samples, pre-cut vegetables were more often contaminated
   (59.06\%) than uncut vegetables (47.68\%). Samples tested positive from
   one (monoresidual samples, 27.33\%) to seven chemical compounds
   (multiresidual samples, 26.00\%). Maximum Residual Levels (MRL)
   established by European legislation were exceeded in two multiresidual
   samples of uncut romaine lettuce (overall non-compliant prevalence
   0.67\%).
   A few samples resulted non-compliant for MRL or contaminated by
   pathogens. Nevertheless in more than half of the samples analysed
   pesticide residues were found; furthermore vegetables encompassed in
   this survey are eaten raw and process does not include any effective
   microbial elimination step. These findings can suggest that public
   health risk remains, especially regarding pre-cut vegetables. (C) 2017

Abstract = {Ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) are bloodsucking arthropods involved in pathogen
   transmission in animals and humans. Tick activity depends on various
   ecological factors such as vegetation, hosts, and temperature. The aim
   of this study was to analyse the spatial/temporal distribution of ticks
   in six sites within a peri-urban area of Palermo (Natural Reserve of
   Monte Pellegrino) and correlate it with field data using Geographical
   Information System (GIS) data. A total of 3092 ticks were gathered via
   dragging method from June 2012 to May 2014. The species collected were:
   Ixodes ventalloi (46.09\%), Hyalomma lusitanicum (19.99\%),
   Rhipicephalus sanguineus (17.34\%), Rhipicephalus pusillus (16.11\%),
   Haemaphisalis sulcata (0.36\%), Dermacentor marginatus (0.10\%), and
   Rhipicephalus turanicus (0.03\%). GIS analysis revealed environmental
   characteristics of each site, and abundance of each tick species was
   analysed in relation to time (monthly trend) and space (site-specific
   abundance). A relevant presence of I. ventalloi in site 2 and H.
   lusitanicum in site 5 was observed, suggesting the possible exposure of
   animals and humans to tick-borne pathogens. Our study shows the
   importance of surveillance of ticks in peri-urban areas and the useful
   implementation of GIS analysis in vector ecology; studies on temporal
   and spatial distribution of ticks correlated to GIS-based ecological
   analysis represent an integrated strategy for decision support in public
   health.},

Abstract = {Based on choline oxidase immobilized by co-crosslinking on an
   overoxidised polypyrrole modified platinum electrode, a novel
   electrochemical assay for cholinesterase activity in human serum was
   developed. The assay was performed by adding an aliquot of
   cholinesterase standard solution or serum sample to phosphate buffer
   containing choline or thiocholine ester and measuring the oxidation
   current of hydrogen peroxide at the rotating modified electrode
   polarized at +0.7 V vs. SCE. The influence of some experimental
   parameters such as pH of the assay, mass transport at the electrode,
   type and concentration of the cholinesterase substrate was studied and
   optimised. Reversible inhibition of choline oxidase from cholinesterase
   substrates was evidenced for the first time, which increases in the
   order of acetylcholine, butyrylcholine and s-butyrylthiocholine. Wide
   linear range, fast response time and appreciable long-term stability
   were assured for both acethyl-and butyrylcholinesterase assays. On
   allowing the polypyrrole layer to efficiently remove interferences from
   the electroactive compounds in the sample, the present method revealed
   to be suitable for the detection of butyrylcholinesterase in human serum
   at activities as low as 0.5 U L-1. The validation with a reference
   spectrophotometric method showed no significant differences when human
   serum samples were analysed.},

Title = {Isolation of a novel Rhabdovirus from an insectivorous bat (Pipistrellus
   kuhlii) in Italy},
Journal = {VIROLOGY JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {15},
Month = {FEB 17},
Abstract = {Background: Rhabdoviridae is one of the most ecologically diverse
   families of RNA viruses which can infect a wide range of vertebrates and
   invertebrates. Bats, among mammals, are pointed to harbor a
   significantly higher proportion of unknown or emerging viruses with
   zoonotic potential. Herein, we report the isolation of a novel
   rhabdovirus, detected in the framework of a virological survey on bats
   implemented in North Italy.
   Methods: Virus isolation and identification were performed on samples of
   635 bats by using cell cultures, negative staining electron microscopy
   and PCRs for different viruses. NGS was commonly performed on cell
   culture supernatants showing cytopathic effect or in case of samples
   resulted positive by at least one of the PCRs included in the diagnostic
   protocol.
   Results: A rhabdovirus was isolated from different organs of a
   Pipistrellus kuhlii. Virus identification was obtained by electron
   microscopy and NGS sequencing. The complete genome size was 11,774 nt
   comprised 5 genes, encoding the canonical rhabdovirus structural
   proteins, and an additional transcriptional unit (U1) encoding a
   hypothetical small protein (157aa) (3'-N-P-M-G-U1-L-5'). The genome
   organization and phylogenetic analysis suggest that the new virus, named
   Vaprio virus (VAPV), belongs to the recently established genus
   Ledantevirus (subgroup B) and it is highly divergent to its closest
   known relative, Le Dantec virus (LDV) (human, 1965 Senegal). A specific
   RT-PCR amplifying a 350 bp fragment of the ORF 6 gene, encoding for L
   protein, was developed and used to test retrospectively a subset of 76
   bats coming from the same area and period, revealing two more VAPV
   positive bats.
   Conclusions: VAPV is a novel isolate of chiropteran rhabdovirus. Genome
   organization and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that VAPV should be
   considered a novel species within the genus Ledantevirus for which viral
   ecology and disease associations should be investigated.},

Abstract = {Cancer stem cell (CSC) self-renewing and drug resistance cause treatment
   failure and tumor recurrence. Osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone tumor
   characterized by biological and molecular heterogeneity, possibly
   dependent on CSCs. CSC identification in osteosarcoma and their
   efficient targeting are still open questions. Spontaneous canine
   osteosarcoma shares clinical and biological features with the human
   tumors, representing a model for translational studies. We characterized
   three CSC-enriched canine osteosarcoma cultures. In serum free
   conditions, these CSC cultures grow as anchorage-independent spheroids,
   show mesenchymal-like properties and in vivo tumorigenicity,
   recapitulating the heterogeneity of the original osteosarcoma.
   Osteosarcoma CSCs express stem-related factors (Sox2, Oct4, CD133) and
   chemokine receptors and ligands (CXCR4, CXCL12) involved in tumor
   proliferation and self-renewal. Standard drugs for osteosarcoma
   treatment (doxorubicin and cisplatin) affected CSC-enriched and parental
   primary cultures, showing different efficacy within tumors. Moreover,
   metformin, a type-2 diabetes drug, significantly inhibits osteosarcoma
   CSC viability, migration and self-renewal and, in co-treatment with
   doxorubicin and cisplatin, enhances drug cytotoxicity. Collectively, we
   demonstrate that canine osteosarcoma primary cultures contain CSCs
   exhibiting distinctive sensitivity to anticancer agents, as a reliable
   experimental model to assay drug efficacy. We also provide
   proof-of-principle of metformin efficacy, alone or in combination, as
   pharmacological strategy to target osteosarcoma CSCs.},

Title = {Feline leishmaniosis: Is the cat a small dog?},
Journal = {VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {251},
Pages = {131-137},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Leishmania infantum is a vector-borne zoonotic disease transmitted by
   phlebotomine sand flies and dogs are considered the main reservoir of
   the parasite. Feline leishmaniosis (FeL) caused by L. infannun is an
   emergent feline disease more and more frequently reported in endemic
   areas. This review summarizes current knowledge focusing similarities
   and differences with canine leishmaniosis (CanL). Cats are infected by
   the same Leishmania species than dogs but prevalence of the infection is
   lower and cases of disease are less frequently reported. Scarce
   information is available on adaptive immune response of cats naturally
   exposed to L. infantum infection and mechanisms responsible for
   susceptibility or resistance of feline hosts. However, about half of
   clinical cases of FeL are reported in cats with possible impaired
   immunocompetence. Coinfections or comorbidities are frequently detected
   in sick cats and they can contribute to a misrepresentation of clinical
   FeL albeit lesions associated with the presence of the parasite have
   been detected in skin, lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, liver, oral
   mucosa, stomach, large bowel, kidney, nasal exudate, lung, eye. As for
   dogs, skin or mucocutaneous lesions are the most common reason for
   veterinary consultation and finding on physical examination in cats with
   leishmaniosis.
   Molecular investigations of Leishmania DNA and anti-Leishmania antibody
   detection are largely used with the same methodologies for both CanL and
   FeL, however few information is available about their diagnostic
   performance in feline hosts. Treatment of cats with clinical FeL is
   still empirically based and off label by using the most common drugs
   prescribed to dogs. Life expectancy of cats with clinical FeL is usually
   good unless concurrent conditions or complications occur and prognosis
   does not seem significantly influenced by therapy or retroviral
   coinfection.
   According to current knowledge, cats can play a role as additional
   reservoir host of L. infantum and, in a ``One Health{''} perspective,
   preventative measures should be taken.
   In conclusion, albeit feline infection and the associated cat disease
   caused by L. infantum is increasingly reported in endemic areas and have
   many similarities with CanL, consolidated evidence-based knowledge is
   not available and we cannot exclude that important differences between
   dogs and cats exist about transmission, immunopathogenesis and best
   practice for management and prevention.},

Title = {Determination of Lipophilic Marine Biotoxins in Mussels Harvested from
   the Adriatic Sea by LC-MS/MS},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 12},
Abstract = {Lipophilic marine biotoxins include okadaic acid, pectenotoxin,
   yessotoxin and azaspiracid groups. The consumption of contaminated
   molluscs can lead to acute food poisoning syndromes depending on the
   exposure level. Regulatory limits have been set by Regulation (European
   Community, 2004a) No 853/2004 and LC-MS/MS is used as the official
   analytical method according to Regulation (European Community, 2011) No
   15/2011. In this study specimens of mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis)
   were collected along the coasts of the central Adriatic Sea during the
   years 2015-2017 and analyzed by the European harmonized Standard
   Operating Procedure. The method was validated for linearity,
   specificity, repeatability and reproducibility and it revealed able to
   be used for the detection of the lipophilic marine biotoxins. Levels of
   okadaic acid, pectenotoxin, yessotoxin and its analogs were detected at
   different concentrations in 148 (37\%) out of a total of 400 samples,
   always below the maximum limits, except for 11 (4.3\%) of them that were
   non-compliant because they exceeded the regulatory limit. Moreover, some
   samples were exposed to a multi-toxin mixture with regards to okadaic
   acid, yessotoxin and 1-Homo yessotoxin. Following these results, the
   aquaculture farms from which the non-compliant samples derived were
   closed until the analytical data of two consecutive samplings returned
   favorable. Besides the potential risk of consumption of mussels
   contaminated by lipophilic marine biotoxins, these marine organisms can
   be considered as bio-indicators of the contamination status of the
   marine ecosystem.},

Abstract = {Background and aim: Plasmid-mediated colistin resistance mechanisms have
   been identified worldwide in the past years. A multiplex polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR) protocol for detection of all currently known
   transferable colistin resistance genes (mcr-1 to mcr-5, and variants) in
   Enterobacteriaceae was developed for surveillance or research purposes.
   Methods: We designed four new primer pairs to amplify mcr-1, mcr-2,
   mcr-3 and mcr-4 gene products and used the originally described primers
   for mcr-5 to obtain a stepwise separation of ca 200 bp between
   amplicons. The primer pairs and amplification conditions allow for
   single or multiple detection of all currently described mcr genes and
   their variants present in Enterobacteriaceae. The protocol was validated
   testing 49 European Escherichia coli and Salmonella isolates of animal
   origin. Results: Multiplex PCR results in bovine and porcine isolates
   from Spain, Germany, France and Italy showed full concordance with whole
   genome sequence data. The method was able to detect mcr-1, mcr-3 and
   mcr-4 as singletons or in different combinations as they were present in
   the test isolates. One new mcr-4 variant, mcr-4.3, was also identified.
   Conclusions: This method allows rapid identification of mcr-positive
   bacteria and overcomes the challenges of phenotypic detection of
   colistin resistance. The multiplex PCR should be particularly
   interesting in settings or laboratories with limited resources for
   performing genetic analysis as it provides information on the mechanism
   of colistin resistance without requiring genome sequencing.},

Title = {Genomic Diversity and Evolution of the Fish Pathogen Flavobacterium
   psychrophilum},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 7},
Abstract = {Flavobacterium psychrophilum, the etiological agent of rainbow trout fry
   syndrome and bacterial cold-water disease in salmonid fish, is currently
   one of the main bacterial pathogens hampering the productivity of
   salmonid farming worldwide. In this study, the genomic diversity of the
   F. psychrophilum species is analyzed using a set of 41 genomes,
   including 30 newly sequenced isolates. These were selected on the basis
   of available MLST data with the two-fold objective of maximizing the
   coverage of the species diversity and of allowing a focus on the main
   clonal complex (CC-ST10) infecting farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus
   mykiss) worldwide. The results reveal a bacterial species harboring a
   limited genomic diversity both in terms of nucleotide diversity, with
   similar to 0.3\% nucleotide divergence inside CDSs in pairwise genome
   comparisons, and in terms of gene repertoire, with the core genome
   accounting for similar to 80\% of the genes in each genome. The
   pan-genome seems nevertheless ``open{''} according to the scaling
   exponent of a power-law fitted on the rate of new gene discovery when
   genomes are added one-by-one. Recombination is a key component of the
   evolutionary process of the species as seen in the high level of
   apparent homoplasy in the core genome. Using a Hidden Markov Model to
   delineate recombination tracts in pairs of closely related genomes, the
   average recombination tract length was estimated to similar to 4.0 Kbp
   and the typical ratio of the contributions of recombination and
   mutations to nucleotide-level differentiation (r/m) was estimated to
   similar to 13. Within CC-ST10, evolutionary distances computed on
   non-recombined regions and comparisons between 22 isolates sampled up to
   27 years apart suggest a most recent common ancestor in the second half
   of the nineteenth century in North America with subsequent
   diversification and transmission of this clonal complex coinciding with
   the worldwide expansion of rainbow trout farming. With the goal to
   promote the development of tools for the genetic manipulation of F.
   psychrophilum, a particular attention was also paid to plasmids. Their
   extraction and sequencing to completion revealed plasmid diversity that
   remained hidden to classical plasmid profiling due to size similarities.},

Title = {Isolation of three novel reassortant phleboviruses, Ponticelli I, II,

Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Month = {FEB 6},
Abstract = {Background: Different phleboviruses are important pathogens for humans;
   most of these viruses are transmitted by sand flies. An increasing
   number of new phleboviruses have been reported over the past decade,
   especially in Mediterranean countries, mainly via their detection in
   sand flies.
   Results: At least five different phleboviruses co-circulated in sand
   flies that were collected in three sites in EmiliaRomagna (Italy) in the
   summer of 2013. The well-known Toscana virus (TOSV) was isolated; three
   new, closely related phleboviruses differing in their M segments and
   tentatively named Ponticelli I, Ponticelli II and Ponticelli III virus,
   respectively, were isolated; a fifth putative phlebovirus, related to
   the sand fly fever Naples phlebovirus species, was also detected. The
   co-circulation, in a restricted area, of three viruses characterized by
   different M segments, likely resulted from reassortment events.
   According to the phylogenetic analysis of complete genome sequences, the
   TOSV belongs to clade A, together with other Italian isolates, while the
   Ponticelli viruses fall within the Salehabad phlebovirus species.
   Conclusions: Results highlight an unexpected diversity of phleboviruses
   that co-circulate in the same area, suggesting that interactions likely
   occur amongst them, that can present challenges for their correct
   identification. The co-circulation of different phleboviruses appears to
   be common, and the bionomics of sand fly populations seem to play a
   relevant role. Such a complex situation emphasizes the need for detailed
   investigations of the biology of these viruses to better characterize
   their pathogenic potential for mammals, including humans.},

Abstract = {Reliable indicators of antimicrobial consumption (AMC) measured with
   harmonised data and supported by indicators for antimicrobial resistance
   (AMR) at herd level are necessary to target antimicrobial misuse in
   food-producing animals. AMC data in 2010-2015 in 32 Italian industrial
   rabbit holdings weighted with semester production and standardised with
   animal daily doses (ADDs) were collected. Herd-level AMR against eight
   antimicrobials was assessed in Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis
   and Enterococcus hirae collected in 2014-2015. Escherichia coli were
   assessed for mcr-1 and mcr-2 genes. To produce 1 kg of live rabbit, a
   mean of 71.8 ADDs was used. Overall AMC reduced over time (P < 0.05)
   owing to lowering consumption of tetracyclines (P < 0.05) and colistin
   (P < 0.01), but consumption of quinolones (P < 0.05), bacitracin (P <
   0.01) and sulfonamides (P = 0.017) increased. All except one indicator
   E. coli were wildtype for cefotaxime, whereas 97\% displayed reduced
   susceptibility to tetracyclines, 89\% to trimethoprim, 63\% to
   enrofloxacin, 24\% to chloramphenicol and 21\% to colistin. mcr-1 was
   detected in 50/320 E. coli isolates from 15/32 holdings; mcr-2 was not
   detected in 58 isolates with colistin MIC >= 2 mg/L. All 305 enterococci
   were wild-type for ampicillin, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin and
   displayed reduced tetracycline susceptibility. The mean antimicrobial
   resistance index (ARI) was 0.5 for E. coli and 0.3 for enterococci. ARI
   was significantly correlated with AMC at herd level for enterococci (P =
   0.008) but not E. coli where high ARI levels were found in a few
   holdings with low AMC. (c) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a zoonotic pathogen with a worldwide
   distribution, and infects several mammalian species, including pigs and
   wild boars, which are recognized as its natural reservoirs. The virus
   causes a usually self-limiting liver disease with a mortality rate
   generally below 1\%, although mortality rates of 15\%-25\% have been
   recorded in pregnant woman. Chronic infections can also occur. The
   prevalence of HEV has been extensively studied in wild boars and pigs in
   northern Italy, where intensive pig herds are predominantly located. In
   contrast, few data have been collected in south-central Italy, where
   small pig herds are surrounded by large regional parks populated with
   heterogeneous wild fauna. In this study, 291 liver samples from wild
   boars caught in south-central Italy were analysed with the molecular
   detection of viral RNA. Our results confirm the circulation of HEV in
   these animals, with a mean prevalence of 13.7\% (40 of 291). A
   nucleotide sequence analysis showed that the HEV strains were highly
   conserved within the same geographic areas. The wild boar HEV strains
   belonged to the HEV-3c subtype, which is frequently described in wild
   boars, and to an uncommon undefined subtype (HEV-3j-like).The viral
   prevalence detected is concerning because it could represent a potential
   risk to hunters, meat workers and consumers of wild boar liver and
   derivative products. The hypothesized inter-species transmission of HEV
   to pigs and the possibility that the virus maintains its virulence in
   the environment and the meat chain also present potential risks to human
   health, and warrant further investigations in the near future.},

Abstract = {Equine mortalities suspected to be due to African horse sickness (AHS)
   were reported from the arid Khomas Region, Namibia, in 2008. The area
   was previously considered a localized AHS-free area. Hartmann's mountain
   zebra (Equus zebra hartmannae), a potential but unconfirmed reservoir
   host of African horse sickness virus (AHSV), occurs in the region.
   Between 2009 and 2010 serum, blood and tissue samples from 31 culled
   E.z.hartmannae were analysed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain
   reaction(RT-PCR) (n = 31) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
   (n = 18) to determine the presence of AHSV and/or antibodies against
   AHSV. The presence of antibodies against AHSV was demonstrated in all 18
   samples assayed, and AHSV double stranded RNA was detected in 26\% of
   the animals. This is evidence that E.z.hartmannae can become infected
   with AHSV.},

   cells, 51 out of 84 genes were significanfly up-or down-regulated, while
   in HT-29 cells only 16 genes were significantly up-or down-regulated.
   Dosage of REEs seems to be the pivotal factor for switching the
   biological effects from down-to up-regulation of cell growth; thus, low
   concentrations promoted cell survival and proliferation, but when
   concentrations increased, REEs exerted antiproliferative and
   cytostatic/cytotoxic effects.
   The molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are still not
   well-defined and further analysis of the mechanisms that result in
   inhibition or induction of cell proliferation are crucially important.},

Title = {Characterization of hazards, welfare promoters and animal-based measures

Year = {2018},
Volume = {150},

Abstract = {An expert opinion elicitation, based on a modified Delphi technique, was
   organized to collect the opinion of 16 Italian veterinarians with the
   aim of conducting a hazard and a welfare promoter characterization for
   defining and weighing a list of management and housing factors
   potentially associated with negative or positive welfare outcomes in
   dairy cows kept in loose housing systems. In addition, the 16 experts
   judged a set of animal-based measures in order to rate them by
   appropriateness and by the level of animal pain and suffering due to the
   welfare consequences they measure. Veterinary experts were asked to
   score 52 hazards, 47 welfare promoters and 18 animal-based measures.
   Management and housing hazards, that were determined to be associated
   with a very high impact on the welfare of dairy cows, were mainly
   referred to lactating cows (absence of bedding material, presence of
   inadequate or slippery floor in walking areas, wrong design of the lying
   area), but also the use of harmful tools for animal handling and the
   lack of scheduled foot inspection, trimming and foot bathing reached
   very high impact scores. Management and housing welfare promoters
   dealing with optimal cow comfort around resting obtained the highest
   ratings, together with the presence of experienced and trained
   stockpersons, the implementation of an attentive animal grouping
   strategy and the control of temperature, humidity and ventilation.
   Considering animal-based measures, the highest ranking of importance was
   given to observation of lameness, records of mortality of adult cows and
   calves, observation of integument alterations and body condition
   scoring. This study has been the starting point for the development of
   the first Italian national protocol for the assessment of the welfare of
   dairy cows farmed in loose housing systems.},

Title = {Geo-statistical analysis of Culicoides spp. distribution and abundance
   in Sicily, Italy},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Background: Biting midges belonging to Culicoides imicola, Culicoides
   obsoletus complex and Culicoides pulicaris complex (Diptera:
   Ceratopogonidae) are increasingly implicated as vectors of bluetongue
   virus in Palaearctic regions. Culicoides obsoletus complex includes C.
   obsoletus (sensu stricto), C. scoticus, C. dewulfi and C. chiopterus.
   Culicoides pulicaris and C. lupicaris belong to the Culicoides pulicaris
   complex. The aim of this study was a geostatistical analysis of the
   abundance and spatial distribution of Culicoides spp. involved in
   bluetongue virus transmission. As part of the national bluetongue
   surveillance plan 7081 catches were collected in 897 Sicilian farms from
   2000 to 2013.
   Methods: Onderstepoort-type blacklight traps were used for sample
   collection and each catch was analysed for the presence of Culicoides
   spp. and for the presence and abundance of Culicoides vector species (C.
   imicola, C. pulicaris / C. obsoletus complexes). A geo-statistical
   analysis was carried out monthly via the interpolation of measured
   values based on the Inverse Distance Weighted method, using a GIS tool.
   Raster maps were reclassified into seven classes according to the
   presence and abundance of Culicoides, in order to obtain suitable maps
   for Map Algebra operations.
   Results: Sicilian provinces showing a very high abundance of Culicoides
   vector species were Messina (80\% of the whole area), Palermo (20\%) and
   Catania (12\%). A total of 5654 farms fell within the very high risk
   area for bluetongue (21\% of the 26,676 farms active in Sicily); of
   these, 3483 farms were in Messina, 1567 in Palermo and 604 in Catania.
   Culicoides imicola was prevalent in Palermo, C. pulicaris in Messina and
   C. obsoletus complex was very abundant over the whole island with the
   highest abundance value in Messina.
   Conclusions: Our study reports the results of a geo-statistical analysis
   concerning the abundance and spatial distribution of Culicoides spp. in
   Sicily throughout the fourteen year study. It provides useful decision
   support in the field of epidemiology, allowing the identification of
   areas to be monitored as bases for improved surveillance plans.
   Moreover, this knowledge can become a tool for the evaluation of virus
   transmission risks, especially if related to vector competence.},

Abstract = {Summer mortality episodes in adult Pacific oysters have been described
   since the 1950s in various farming areas. Starting in 2012, a
   recrudescence of mortalities in commercial-sized oysters was first
   observed in France and then in Italy, with seasonality extension and
   translation later in the year. Moribund individuals collected during an
   event in Italy in December 2014 showed yellowish lesions of the mantle
   and adductor muscle. Histological examination revealed filamentous
   bacteria associated with necrotic areas. Quantitative PCRs targeting
   OsHV-1 and Vibrio aestuarianus detected only high loads of the
   pathogenic bacteria in tissues of symptomatic individuals. A lower
   diversity of the hemolymph microbiota was also evidenced in moribund
   individuals, with a predominance of Vibrio and Arcobacter species. A
   strain of Flavobacteriaceae was isolated from all the symptomatic
   individuals. Sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene identified the
   strain as Tenacibaculum soleae. When strain pathogenicity was tested by
   injection in adult individuals, it induced mortality rates of up to
   45\%, even in the absence of V.aestuarianus. As mortality occurred only
   11 days post-infection, further investigation is needed to determine its
   effective virulence in natural conditions. This is the first description
   of a Tenacibaculum strain associated with bivalve mortalities.},

Abstract = {In this study, mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from rat adipose
   tissue (AD-MSCs) to characterize and differentiate them into
   endothelial-like cells. AD-MSCs were isolated by mechanical and
   enzymatic treatments, and their identity was verified by colony-forming
   units (CFU) test and by differentiation into cells of mesodermal
   lineages. The endothelial differentiation was induced by plating another
   aliquot of cells in EGM-2 medium, enriched with specific endothelial
   growth factors. Five subcultures were performed. The expression of
   stemness genes (OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG) was investigated. The presence of
   CD90 and the absence of the CD45 were evaluated by flow cytometry. The
   endothelial-like cells were characterized by the evaluation of
   morphological changes and gene expression analysis for endothelial
   markers (CD31, CD144, CD146). Characterization of AD-MSCs showed their
   ability to form clones, to differentiate in vitro and the OCT-4, SOX-2,
   NANOG genes expression. Immunophenotypic characterization showed the
   CD90 presence and the CD45 absence. The endothelial-like cells showed
   morphological changes, the expression of CD31, CD144, CD146 genes and
   the presence of CD31 membrane receptor. Matrigel assay showed their
   ability to form network and vessels-like structures. This study lays the
   foundations for future evaluation of the potential AD-MSCs
   pro-angiogenic and therapeutic role.},

Abstract = {The availability of a rapid and accurate method for the diagnosis of
   Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp), able to discriminate
   its strictly correlated subsp. damselae (Phdd), formally known as Vibrio
   damsela, is essential for managing fish pasteurellosis outbreaks in
   farmed fish. A single-step, high-sensitivity real-time PCR assay for
   simultaneous detection and quantification of P.damselae was designed
   targeting partial of the sequence of the bamB gene and tested for
   specificity and sensitivity on laboratory-generated samples as well as
   on experimentally infected seabream tissue samples. With a limit of
   detection (LOD) of one copy in pure bacterial DNA, the sensitivity was
   higher than all methods previously reported. Validation in target and
   non-target bacterial species proved the assay was able to discriminate
   Phdd-Phdp subspecies from diverse hosts/geographical origins and between
   non-target species. In addition, two SNPs in the target amplicon region
   determine two distinctive qPCR dissociation curves distinguishing
   between Phdp-Phdd. This is the first time that a molecular method for
   P.damselae diagnosis combines detection, quantification and subspecies
   identification in one step. The assay holds the potential to improve the
   knowledge of infection dynamics and the development of better strategies
   to control an important fish disease.},

Abstract = {Influenza A virus (IAV) infection in swine plays an important role in
   the ecology of influenza viruses. The emergence of new IAVs comes
   through different mechanisms, with the genetic reassortment of genes
   between influenza viruses, also originating from different species,
   being common. We performed a genetic analysis on 179 IAV isolates from
   humans (n. 75) and pigs (n. 104) collected in Northern Italy between
   2010 and 2015, to monitor the genetic exchange between human and swine
   IAVs. No cases of human infection with swine strains were noticed, but
   direct infections of swine with H1N1pdm09 strains were detected.
   Moreover, we pointed out a continuous circulation of H1N1pdm09 strains
   in swine populations evidenced by the introduction of internal genes of
   this subtype. These events contribute to generating new viral
   variantspossibly endowed with pandemic potentialand emphasize the
   importance of continuous surveillance at both animal and human level.},

Title = {Grading abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture risk},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {59},
Number = {1},
Pages = {87-94},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper was to develop a scoring system to
   grade the risk of rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in
   individual patients.
   METHODS: Computed tomography angiography of an AAA were coupled with
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) evaluation performed using open
   source software (ElmerSolver, Institute of Technology, Espoo, Finland).
   CFD criteria studied were: Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI), time averaged
   wall shear stress (TAWSS) and residence relative time (RRT) on both
   two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) models. AAA rupture
   predictors were analyzed and a scoring system was generated using Arabic
   numerals for all significant variables in order to grade the individual
   patient risk of rupture.
   RESULTS: There were 143 patients examined. Ninety-one AAAs (18 ruptured
   AAAs), and 52 had a non-aneurysmal aorta. The 2D OSI was the best CFD
   criterion following multivariate analysis and ROC curves evaluation. An
   AAA was deemed respectively at low, moderate, or high risk of rupture,
   according to whether the risk score was defined as AAA I (total score
   <2.3), AAA II (2.3-6.5) or AAA III (>6.5). The only protective factor
   was found in diabetes (OR=0.775; CI: 0.665-0.902).
   CONCLUSIONS: The Florence Risk Score for AAA rupture based on this
   report may be a useful tool to predict AAA rupture. A prospective
   multicenter registry will need to confirm its validity.},

Abstract = {Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 first entered
   Myanmar in 2006 in the Mandalay District. Several H5N1 outbreaks
   followed and the one of Bago East District (2007) required post outbreak
   surveillance in the at-risk domestic duck population of the Moyingyi
   Wetland. A field epidemiological study based on a randomised prospective
   stratified study with five surveys provided the serological evidence
   that the avian influenza H5 subtype circulates in the domestic duck
   population and spreads to almost all the newly housed (and negative)
   flocks in the time span of a seasonal production cycle. Virological
   investigation was negative. The survival analysis showed that the
   probability of seroconversion increased rapidly over the study period,
   without significant difference among different agro-ecosystems. The
   analysis suggests that viral spread in the new cycle could be limited if
   control measures were adopted at the time new flocks are housed. The
   study recommends that future surveillance schemes for ducks are designed
   in a way to get as much information as possible from serological results
   which should drive virological sampling to determined farms.},

Title = {Formation and Characterization of Early Bacterial Biofilms on Different
   Wood Typologies Applied in Dairy Production},
Journal = {APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {The main hypothesis of this work was that Sicilian forestry resources
   are suitable for the production of equipment to be used in cheese making
   and indigenous milk lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are able to develop
   stable biofilms providing starter and nonstarter cultures necessary for
   curd fermentation and cheese ripening, respectively. Hence, the present
   work was carried out with deproteinized whey to evaluate LAB biofilm
   formation on different woods derived from tree species grown in Sicily.
   Microbiological and scanning electron microscopy analyses showed minimal
   differences in microbial levels and compositions for the neoformed
   biofilms. The specific investigation of Salmonella spp., Listeria
   monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS),
   and sulfite-reducing anaerobes did not generate any colony for all vats
   before and after bacterial adhesion. LAB populations dominated all vat
   surfaces. The highest levels (7.63 log CFU/cm(2)) were registered for
   thermophilic cocci. Different colonies were characterized
   physiologically, biochemically, and genetically (at strain and species
   levels). Six species within the genera Enterococcus, Lactobacillus,
   Lactococcus, and Streptococcus were identified. The species most
   frequently present were Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactococcus lactis.
   LAB found on the surfaces of the wooden vats in this study showed
   interesting characteristics important for dairy manufacture. To
   thoroughly investigate the safety of the wooden vat, a test of
   artificial contamination on new Calabrian chestnut (control wood) vats
   was carried out. The results showed that LAB represent efficient
   barriers to the adhesion of the main dairy pathogens, probably due to
   their acidity and bacteriocin generation.
   IMPORTANCE This study highlights the importance of using wooden vats for
   traditional cheese production and provides evidence for the valorization
   of the Sicilian forest wood resources via the production of dairy
   equipment.},

Title = {What we have lost: Mastitis resistance in Holstein Friesians and in a
   local cattle breed},
Journal = {RESEARCH IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {116},
Pages = {88-98},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In Holstein Friesian dairy cows, selective pressure for increased milk
   production has led to a higher propensity to disease, including
   mastitis, when compared to less selected and lower producing dairy
   breeds. The biology underpinning the higher resistance to disease of
   such ``local breeds{''} is not fully understood. With the aim of
   investigating the factors associated to this phenomenon, we applied a
   multidisciplinary approach to compare innate immune response patterns,
   metabolic parameters, milk protein profiles and the milk microbiota in
   Holstein Friesian and Rendena cows reared in the same farm and under the
   same management conditions. Quarter milk samples and blood plasma were
   collected from all cows at dry-off, 1 day after calving, 7-10 days after
   calving and 30 days after calving. Quarter milk samples were subjected
   to bacteriological culture, characterization of the milk microbiota by
   16S metagenomics, milk protein profiling by electrophoresis and
   densitometry, somatic cell counting, measurement of the inflammation
   marker cathelicidin and assessment of different innate immune-related
   mediators such as lysozyme, CD45, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, PTX3, IL-1R8. In
   parallel, the main inflammometabolic parameters were measured in blood
   plasma samples. Despite having relatively few animals (6
   moderate-yielding Holstein Friesian and 4 low-yielding Rendena) some
   important differences were apparent. Holstein Friesian cows showed a
   more severe fat mobilization and systemic inflammatory response
   postpartum in comparison with Rendena cows, which had a greater
   postpartum muscle mass and an increased amino acid mobilization compared
   to Holstein Friesians. Upon bacteriological analysis, contagious
   bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae were
   absent, but significant differences were seen in the general composition
   of the milk microbiota of the two breeds. Concerning the milk protein
   abundance profile, pronounced differences were seen in colostrum, with
   significantly higher amounts of immunoglobulins and other immune-related
   proteins in Rendena. Added to this, the expression of innate immune
   related genes such as PTX3, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and KRT5 expression in
   milk epithelial and leukocyte cell components, respectively, was lower
   in Holstein Friesian colostrum compared with Rendena. In conclusion,
   several differences were observed in the two breeds, in spite of the
   same farming conditions. The observations reported in this work present
   numerous pointers to the factors that may provide autochthonous, more
   rustic breeds with a higher resistance to disease.},

   serological prevalence of peste des petits ruminants (PPR) infection and
   to investigate host factors associated with PPR infection in small
   ruminants in Libya. A two-stage sampling design was carried out. A total
   number of 148 flocks owning at least 100 heads each were randomly
   selected. Sixteen to forty-eight samples were collected from each
   selected flock. A total number of 3,508 serum samples from unvaccinated
   animals were collected and analysed at IZSLER Brescia, Italy, by using
   competitive ELISA, IDvet innovative diagnostics (IDvet 310, France). The
   overall serological prevalence among SR was 33\% (95\% CI: 31.4-34.5).
   Significant differences between the prevalence in the geographical
   branches were observed. The lowest prevalence level was observed in
   Zawiyah branch (16.1\%), whereas the highest value was obtained for the
   Sabha branch (56.8\%). Considering the age, a serological prevalence of
   24.7\%, 31.5\% and 42.1\% was observed in SR <1year, between 1 and
   2years and more than 2years, respectively. Statistically significant
   differences (p<.001) in the sero-prevalence levels were also observed
   between the age groups. Our findings suggest that the southern part of
   Libya could be more exposed to the infections coming from the
   neighbouring countries and this should be better investigated to
   correctly identify wherever specific entry points can be considered at
   higher risk than others. The results also confirmed the endemic status
   of PPR in Libya, with a constant exposure to the infection of the
   animals during their life. In the framework of the global strategy for
   control and eradication of PPR, our results, even if obtained by a
   preliminary study, can contribute to the assessment of the
   epidemiological situation of PPR in Libya as required by the Stage 1 of
   the plan.},

Abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is an important cause of infections in
   hospitalized neonates. Preterm or low birthweight infants are especially
   at risk to develop a S. aureus infection due to the immaturity of the
   immune system, length of hospital stay and invasive procedures.
   Exfoliative toxin (ET)-producing S. aureus is often responsible for
   neonatal infections, causing clinical manifestations such as
   staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, characterized by both localized
   blisters or generalized exfoliation of the skin.
   We describe an outbreak due to an S. aureus strain producing ETA
   occurring in a local hospital in Northern Italy. Molecular typing of the
   isolates included spa typing and multilocus sequence typing. DNA
   microarray hybridization was also performed on one representative
   strain.
   In the period from July 2013 to February 2014, 12 neonates presented
   with skin infections, mainly bullae or pustules. Cultures of skin swabs
   yielded methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA). By molecular typing,
   an epidemic strain (t1393/ST5) was identified in nine neonates;
   microarray analysis and PCR revealed that it contained the ETA encoding
   gene. Screening of staff, mothers and healthy neonates and environmental
   cultures did not reveal the presence of the epidemic strain. However,
   the father of an infected neonate was found to be a carrier of MSSA
   t1393 five months after the outbreak started.
   Implementation of hygiene procedures and sanitization of the ward twice
   terminated the outbreak. Timely surveillance of infections, supported by
   molecular typing, is fundamental to prevent similar episodes among
   neonates.},

Abstract = {Treatment of Swine Dysentery (SD) caused by Brachyspira hyodysenteriae
   (B. hyodysenteriae) is carried out using antimicrobials such as
   macrolides, lincosamides and pleuromutilins leading to the selection of
   resistant strains. Whole genome sequencing of a multidrug-resistant B.
   hyodysenteriae strain called BH718 belonging to sequence type (ST) 83
   revealed the presence of the lincosamide resistance gene lnu(C) on the
   small 1724-bp transposon MTnSagl. The strain also contains an A to T
   substitution at position 2058 (A2058T) in the 23S rRNA gene which is
   known to be associated with macrolide and lincosamide resistance in B.
   hyodysenteriae. Testing of additional strains showed that those
   containing lnu(C) exhibited a higher minimal inhibitory concentration
   (MIC) of lincomycin (MIC >= 64 mg/L) compared to strains lacking lnu(C),
   even if they also harbor the A2058T mutation. Resistance to
   pleuromutilins could not be explained by the presence of already
   reported mutations in the 23S rRNA gene and in the ribosomal protein L3.
   This study shows that B. hyodysenteriae has the ability to acquire
   mobile genetic elements conferring resistance to antibiotics.},

Title = {Italy finally complies with the requirements to be declared as free from
   Enzootic Bovine Leukosis},
Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-9},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Enzootic Bovine Leukosis is an infectious disease caused by an exogenous
   retrovirus (BLV), worldwide distributed in cattle population. The
   European Union provided a specific legislation with the aim to eradicate
   the disease (council directive of 64/432/EEC); in fact, most of member
   states have eradicated the EBL implementing an active serological survey
   of susceptible population and ``test and removal{''} strategy for the
   seropositive animals. Anyway, EBL is still persistent in several
   European countries, including Italy, where a national eradication plan
   is active since the 1996. The rules of this plan are directly transposed
   from European legislation: all the breeding cattle herds should be
   tested and all the animals (over the 12 months) should be negative to
   achieve the recognition of freedom status; the positive animals should
   be eliminated and restriction measures have to be applied to the herd
   until the outbreak eradication. The Italian northern regions were
   already recognised as BLV free, whereas in the ``South{''}, in relation
   to the original timetable, the application of the plan is well overdue.
   EBL causes direct production losses (milk loss, reduced value of
   infected animals...) and treatment costs (surveillance activities,
   veterinary facilities, extra farm-labour costs...), with reduced export
   competitiveness and commercial restrictions for bovine sector. For these
   reasons the Italian Ministry of Health implemented, in the recent past,
   more relevant measures to efficiently complete the eradication process.
   On these basis, BLV infection is currently notified in limited clusters
   (Lazio, Puglia, Campania, Sicilia) whereas the risk of viral circulation
   to the rest of the country is negligible.
   In fact, the data derived from VET-INFO, the national platform of
   veterinary informative system, in support of the management of animal
   population and the control of the animal diseases, allowed to verify the
   compliance of the entire national territory with the European rules: the
   prevalence of BLV outbreaks is now computable under the threshold of
   0.2\% (of controllable herds).
   This means that Italy has finally achieved the requirements provided by
   the National and European legislation, to be officially declared as free
   from EBL. Consequently, the eradication plan could be considered as out
   of date and a less expensive surveillance plan should be implemented to
   assure the maintenance of the free status. A consistent part of the
   saved resources will enable the Ministry of Health and the interested
   Regions to adopt specific plans to eradicate EBL even in the remaining
   persistent clusters of infection.},

Abstract = {In this work 437 fish samples of species belonging to the families
   Myctophidae (Electrona risso and Diaphus metopoclampus) and
   Phosichthyidae (Vinciguerria attenuata) were examined for the presence
   of Anisakidae larvae. The study was performed with fishes in the central
   Mediterranean Sea, particularly in the Strait of Sicily and in the
   Strait of Messina. The visual inspection and chloro-peptic analysis
   revealed the presence of nematode parasites with prevalence values
   between 2.9\% in Electrona risso samples and 5.4\% in Vinciguerria
   attenuata samples. A positive correlation was found between standard
   length (SL) and prevalence of infestation in D. metopoclampus samples (p
   < 0.05). The larvae examined were morphologically ascribed, at genus
   level, to Anisakis morphotypes I and II and molecularly identified as
   Anisakis pegreffii, Anisakis ziphidarum and Anisakis physeteris, in
   67\%, 9\% and 24\% of the fish samples examined. Overall, A. pegreffii
   and A. ziphidarum larvae were isolated in 14 and 2 specimens of D.
   metopoclampus respectively, A. physeteris larvae were found in 3 E.
   risso and 2 V. attenuata. A positive correlation was found between
   standard length and prevalence of infestation in D. metopoclampus
   samples (p < 0.05). First information is provided on the presence of
   Anisakis spp. larvae of the myctophid fish species E. risso, D.
   metopoclampus and V. attenuata from the Central Mediterranean. It is
   also confirmed the role of lanternfishes (Myctophidae) as paratenic
   hosts for Anisakis spp.},

Abstract = {The aim of our study was to investigate the infection epidemiology in
   dairy farms with recent history of Streptococcus agalactiae
   intramammary-infection with special reference to: farming conditions,
   prevalence of infected cows, susceptibility to antimicrobials and
   molecular characteristics of the involved strains. In 15 dairy farms of
   the Lodi's Province, resulted positive for S. agalactiae at the official
   tank bulk milk test in the last two years, 1794 individual composite
   milk samples were obtained (range 24-217) and selective bacteriological
   examination were performed. The results showed the presence of S.
   agalactiae in 13 herds, with a prevalence of infected cows ranging from
   10.4 to 54.7\%. The analysis of the milking and biosecurity checklists
   on farms highlight some critical factors correlating with the prevalence
   of infection, such as: insufficient udder preparation (R = 0.66),
   failure to perform post-dipping (R = 0.77), incorrect milking routine (R
   = 0.58), inappropriate washing and disinfection procedures of the
   milking machine (R = 0.61), the administration of the infected milk to
   the calves (R = 0.85), poor udder hygiene (R = 0.64), high counts of
   both somatic cells and UFC/mL of S. agalactiae in bulk tank milk
   (respectively R = 0.63 and R = 0.64). Results of the minimum inhibitory
   concentration on one strain for farm (n. 13) showed strains resistant to
   tetracycline (n. 5), erythromycin (n. 1) and pirlimycin (n. 1); all
   strains were sensitive to beta-lactams tested. Results of RAPD-PCR on 55
   strains (4 for each farm) showed a genetic variability between strains
   (6 different profiles), but also evidenced that in 11 herds out of 13,
   strains with the same genetic profile were spread (clonal diffusion),
   while in 2 herds, different strains were simultaneously present.
   Eighteen strains representative of the strains circulating in the
   investigated farms were all positive at PCR-RT for a specific species
   gene and for neuC and cpsL virulence genes factors. Our findings confirm
   the severity of infection by S. agalactiae and underline the need of
   constant monitoring of the correct and hygienic procedures of milking,
   the animal management and bulk tank milk analysis.},

Abstract = {This Research Communication investigated the potential of mid-infrared
   spectroscopy to predict detailed mineral composition of bovine milk. A
   total of 153 bulk milk samples were analysed for contents of Ca, Cl, Cu,
   Fe, K, Mg, Na, P and Zn. Also, soluble and colloidal fractions of Ca, Mg
   and P were quantified. For each milk sample the mid-infrared spectrum
   was captured and stored. Prediction models were developed using partial
   least squares regression and the accuracy of prediction was evaluated
   using both cross- and external validation. The proportion of variance
   explained by the prediction models in cross-validation ranged from 34\%
   (Na) to 77\% (total P), and it ranged from 13\% (soluble Mg) to 54\%
   (Cl-) in external validation. The ratio of the standard deviation of
   each trait to the standard error of prediction in external validation,
   which is an indicator of the practical utility of the prediction model,
   was low and never greater than 2. Results from the current study
   supported the limited usefulness of mid-infrared spectroscopy to predict
   minerals present in low concentration in bulk milk. For major mineral
   components, results from the present research did not match previous
   findings demonstrating the need for further studies using larger
   reference datasets.},

Abstract = {Canine kobuviruses (CaKoVs) were first identified in diarrhoeic and
   asymptomatic dogs in 2011 in the USA. Subsequent studies have
   demonstrated a worldwide distribution of these viruses, but it is not
   clear if CaKoVs play a role as enteric pathogens of dogs. More recently,
   CaKoV RNA has been detected in wild carnivores, including red fox,
   golden jackal, side-striped jackal and spotted hyena. In this study, we
   addressed the hypothesis that wolves are susceptible to CaKoV
   infections. A total of 185 wolf stool samples were collected from
   necropsied animals and from transects in the Liguria, Piemonte and Valle
   D'Aosta regions of Italy, and CaKoV RNA was identified in two of these
   specimens. Both samples were obtained from necropsied wolves, with a
   prevalence rate of 4.9\% (2/41). Sequence analysis of the full-length
   VP1 region showed that these strains displayed the highest nucleotide
   (nt) sequence identity (86.3-98.5\%) to canine strains identified in the
   UK and Africa, and to kobuviruses that were previously detected in other
   African wild carnivores. This suggests that genetically related CaKoV
   strains circulate in domestic and wild carnivores, with interspecies
   transmission being not uncommon among carnivores of different
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Canine parvovirus (CPV) is an important infectious agent of domestic and
   wild carnivores, responsible for severe and often fatal haemorrhagic
   gastroenteritis and leukopenia. This paper reports the genomic
   characterization of a CPV strain collected from a dog recently imported
   to Italy from Thailand. The virus was detected in all tissue samples
   collected. The whole genome encompassing the two open reading frames
   encoding for non-structural (NS1/NS2) and structural (VP1/VP2) proteins
   was amplified and sequenced. On the basis of genetic analysis of the VP2
   gene, the isolate was characterized as CPV-2c, but it presented genetic
   signatures typical of Asian strains. Sequence analysis revealed the
   presence of amino acid changes never observed in European CPV-2c strains
   (NS1: Ile60Val, Tyr544Phe, Glu545Val, Leu630Pro; VP2: Ala5Gly,
   Phe267Tyr, Tyr324Ile, Gln370Arg). By phylogenetic analysis of
   full-length VP2 gene, the analysed strain clustered together with Asian
   viruses. Therefore, a possible introduction of the virus from Asia
   through the imported dog was suggested, thus confirming the important
   role of movement of dogs in the global spread of viruses. In addition,
   full-length genome analysis could help better trace the spread of canine
   viruses through different continents.},

Abstract = {African swine fever virus (ASFV) has been endemic in Sardinia since
   1978, resulting in severe losses for local pig producers and creating
   important problems for the island's veterinary authorities. This study
   used a spatially explicit stochastic transmission model followed by two
   regression models to investigate the dynamics of ASFV spread amongst
   domestic pig farms, to identify geographic areas at highest risk and
   determine the role of different susceptible pig populations (registered
   domestic pigs, non-registered domestic pigs {[}brado] and wild boar) in
   ASF occurrence. We simulated transmission within and between farms using
   an adapted version of the previously described model known as Be-FAST.
   Results from the model revealed a generally low diffusion of ASF in
   Sardinia, with only 24\% of the simulations resulting in disease spread,
   and for each simulated outbreak on average only four farms and 66 pigs
   were affected. Overall, local spread (indirect transmission between
   farms within a 2km radius through fomites) was the most common route of
   transmission, being responsible for 98.6\% of secondary cases. The risk
   of ASF occurrence for each domestic pig farm was estimated from the
   spread model results and integrated in two regression models together
   with available data for brado and wild boar populations. There was a
   significant association between the density of all three populations
   (domestic pigs, brado, and wild boar) and ASF occurrence in Sardinia.
   The most significant risk factors were the high densities of brado
   (OR=2.2) and wild boar (OR=2.1). The results of both analyses
   demonstrated that ASF epidemiology and infection dynamics in Sardinia
   create a complex and multifactorial disease situation, where all
   susceptible populations play an important role. To stop ASF transmission
   in Sardinia, three main factors (improving biosecurity on domestic pig
   farms, eliminating brado practices and better management of wild boars)
   need to be addressed.},

Abstract = {Incursion of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) into Sweden was
   documented in 1990 and it is now considered endemic in wild rabbit
   (Oryctolagus cuniculus) populations. Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus 2
   (RHDV2), a new, related lagovirus was first detected in France in 2010,
   and has spread rapidly throughout Europe and beyond. However, knowledge
   of RHDV2 in northern Europe is sporadic and incomplete, and in Sweden,
   routinely available diagnostic methods to detect rabbit haemorrhagic
   disease (RHD) do not distinguish between types of virus causing disease.
   Using RHDV2-specific RT-qPCR, sequencing of the VP60 gene and
   immunological virus typing of archived and prospective case material
   from the National Veterinary Institute's (SVA) wildlife disease
   surveillance programme and diagnostic pathology service, we describe the
   emergence of RHDV2 in Sweden in both wild and domestic rabbits. The
   earliest documented outbreak occurred on 22 May 2013, and from May 2013
   to May 2016, 10 separate incidents of RHDV2 were documented from six
   different municipalities in the southern half of Sweden. Phylogenetic
   analysis of the VP60 gene shows clear clustering of Swedish isolates
   into three separate clusters within two different clades according to
   geographic location and time, suggesting viral evolution, multiple
   introduction events or both. Almost all cases of RHD examined by SVA
   from May 2013 to May 2016 were caused by RHDV2, suggesting that RHDV2
   may be replacing RHDV as the predominant cause of RHD in Sweden.},

Title = {Assessment of Urinary Deoxynivalenol Biomarkers in UK Children and

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Deoxynivalenol (DON), the mycotoxin produced mainly by Fusarium
   graminearum and found in contaminated cereal-based foodstuff, has been
   consistently detected in body fluids in adults. Available data in
   children and adolescents are scarce. This study assessed urinary DON
   concentrations in children aged 3-9 years (n = 40) and adolescents aged
   10-17 years (n = 39) in the UK. Morning urine samples were collected
   over two consecutive days and analysed for free DON (un-metabolised
   form), DON-glucuronides (DON-GlcA), deepoxy deoxynivalenol (DOM-1), and
   total DON (sum of free DON, DON-GlcA, and DOM-1). Total DON was detected
   in the urine of >95\% of children and adolescents on both days. Mean
   total DON concentrations (ng/mg creatinine) were 41.6 and 21.0 for
   children and adolescents, respectively. The greatest total DON levels
   were obtained in female children on both days (214 and 219 ng/mg
   creatinine on days 1 and 2, respectively). Free DON and DON-GlcA were
   detected in most urine specimens, whereas DOM-1 was not present in any
   sample. Estimation of dietary DON exposure suggested that 33-63\% of
   children and 5-46\% of adolescents exceeded current guidance regarding
   the maximum provisional tolerable daily intake (PMTDI) for DON. Although
   moderate mean urinary DON concentrations were shown, the high detection
   frequency of urinary DON, the maximum biomarker concentrations, and
   estimated dietary DON exposure are concerning.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the development and validation of an analytical
   method to determine 15 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in fish
   and shellfish tissues with gas chromatography coupled to triple
   quadrupole mass spectrometry using electron impact source (GC-EI-MS/MS).
   A QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe)-like
   procedure was applied; the extract was cleaned up on an acidic
   Extrelut-NT3 column connected on top of a silica cartridge and further
   purified with gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The SIM acquisition
   proved to yield better results than traditional MRM approach for octa-,
   nona-, and deca-brominated congeners. The validation study was carried
   out in inter-laboratory conditions. The average recoveries were in the
   range 66-118\%, with relative standard deviations generally lower than
   or equal to 22\%. Quality assurance and quality control practices were
   thoroughly described and highlighted. These long and tedious practices
   are fundamental to obtain reliable quantitative data during food
   monitoring programs and, therefore, to support daily intake assessments.
   Finally, the procedure was applied to the analysis of marine fish
   samples collected in local markets. Mackerel and mullet were the most
   contaminated species.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Ixodidae ticks are vectors and reservoirs of several species of
   rickettsiae, and tick-borne rickettsioses are reported worldwide. This
   study was aimed to verify the distribution of spotted fever group
   rickettsiae associated with ticks in a wild environment, the National
   Park of Gargano, where there is proximity between wild and domestic
   animals, and which is within an endemic area for rickettsiosis. Ticks
   were collected from animals or vegetation, morphologically identified
   and tested by a PCR targeting the 17kDa gene, and by a loop-mediated
   isothermal amplification (LAMP) targeting ompB gene. Out of 34 tested
   tick pools, 2 from Dermacentor marginatus, 1 from Ixodes ricinus, and 1
   from Rhipicephalus turanicus resulted positive. Nucleotide sequences of
   amplicons showed high similarity with sequences from Rickettsia slovaca,
   Rickettsia raoultii, Rickettsia helvetica, and Rickettsia felis. The
   overall calculated infection rate was 26.19 per 1,000, while it rose up
   to 107.77 when only D. marginatus was considered. The results highlight
   the association among Ri. slovaca, Ri. raoultii, D. marginatus and wild
   boars from which infected ticks were collected. Finally, the study shows
   the low efficacy of the previously described LAMP method for the
   detection of Rickettsia spp., when compared to PCR, making urgent the
   development of most effective LAMP protocols.},

Abstract = {A quick and reproducible screening analytical method for the
   simultaneous determination of algal toxins, belonging to different
   chemical classes, was developed to provide a toxin profile in seawater,
   useful to assess potential risks to environment and human health. The
   target compounds were: gonyautoxin-1,4, gonyautoxin-2,3,
   decarbamoylgonyautoxin-2,3, NaEurosulfocarbamoyl-gonyautoxin-1,2,
   neosaxitoxin, decarbamoyl-neosaxitoxin, saxitoxin,
   decarbamoyl-saxitoxin, domoic acid, 13-desmethyl spirolide C (SPX1),
   palytoxin and okadaic acid. Extraction and clean-up were carried out
   with a combination of Bond Elut LRC-C18 and Carbograph4 cartridges
   connected in series. Analyte separation was performed in gradient
   elution mode in 12 min with a Gemini C-18 column. Compound detection was
   carried out in multiple reaction monitoring and in positive ionization
   mode for paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins, domoic acid, SPX1 and
   palytoxin, and in negative ionization mode for okadaic acid. The toxins
   were quantified with matrix-matched calibration curves constructed by
   spiked seawater samples (concentration levels 0.02-2 mu g L-1 depending
   on the compound). The method was reproducible with intra-day and
   inter-day relative standard deviations ranging from 4 to 9\% and from 8
   to 16\%, respectively. Good recoveries (84-105\%) and good accuracy
   (2-20\%) were obtained by spiking experiments. Limits of detection were
   calculated for each toxin and varied from 0.011 to 0.12 mu g L-1
   depending on the compound. The developed method was applied to cultured
   Ostreopsis cf. ovata samples. The proposed procedure may be considered a
   valuable alternative to existing methods for monitoring toxic
   microalgae, since it offers a rapid screening of target toxins, reduced
   organic solvent consumption, and handling of smaller sample volumes
   while providing good sensitivity and accuracy.},

Title = {The economic implications of sylvatic rabies eradication in Italy},
Journal = {ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {65},
Number = {1},
Pages = {147-157},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {After more than 10years of absence, sylvatic rabies re-appeared in Italy
   in 2008. To prevent disease spread, three oral rabies vaccination (ORV)
   campaigns targeting red foxes were performed through manual distribution
   of vaccine baits between January and September 2009. As these campaigns
   proved unsuccessful, at the end of December 2009, baits started being
   distributed using helicopters, allowing uniform coverage of larger areas
   in a shorter time period. From winter 2009 to autumn 2016, a total of 15
   ORV campaigns (four emergency, four regular and seven preventive ORV)
   were implemented through aerial distribution of baits. In this study, we
   assessed the costs of the aerial ORV campaigns, which were aimed at
   eradicating the disease and reobtaining the rabies-free status.
   Cumulative costs per km(2) were estimated at Euro59.45 during emergency
   campaigns and ranged between Euro51.94 and Euro65.67 in the regular
   vaccinations. The main portion of costs for ORV programmes were related
   to baits supply and distribution: Euro49.24 (82.83\%) in emergency
   campaigns and from Euro40.33 to Euro 43.35 in regular ORVs (71.97\% and
   66.02\%, respectively). At the end of each ORV campaign, the efficacy of
   vaccination activities was estimated by assessing the proportion of
   foxes testing positive for tetracycline biomarker in jawbone, indicating
   bait intake. Results revealed that the proportion of foxes that ingested
   baits varied between 70.97\% and 95.51\%. Statistical analysis indicated
   that reducing the density of dropped baits could potentially lead to a
   cost-saving of 22.81\%, still maintaining a satisfactory level of bait
   intake by the fox population.},

   tissues and at a fourfold lower concentration than other phthalates in
   Dermochelys coriacea. No traces of DEP were detected in C. caretta
   tissues where DOTP was also revealed. The presence of phthalates in fat
   tissue 1n specimens of C. caretta showed a major prevalence of the most
   lipophilic phthalates DEHP and DOTP. The total concentration of all
   analyzed phthalates, showed high values in all tissues. Results
   suggested that for monitoring purpOses from live specimens sample
   collection should be addressed to fat tissue with accurate
   manipulations.},

Abstract = {The concentrations of trace and non-trace elements were determined in
   blood and fibers of alpacas (Vicugna pacos) from a north Italian area,
   as well as in their pasture forages. This is the first investigation
   regarding this species in Italy, and the first considering alpaca's
   fiber as bioindicator worldwide. Metal contents in blood were in the
   decreasing order: copper > zinc > aluminum > selenium > lead > nickel >
   manganese > chromium > arsenic and cadmium, while in fiber, metal levels
   were in the following order: aluminum > zinc > copper > manganese >
   chromium > nickel > selenium > lead > arsenic and cadmium. Antimony,
   beryllium, mercury, tin, and thallium were below the limit of
   quantification (0.010 mg kg(-1)). The analysis of the alpacas' forage
   confirmed the same trend found in fiber, suggesting that metal
   bioaccumulation was affected by diet. These preliminary results have
   shown that all the trace elements studied bioaccumulated to a greater
   extent in the fibers of the alpaca than in the blood. Accordingly, we
   may suggest that alpaca fibers could be used for monitoring exposure
   especially to non-essential metals like aluminum, cadmium, and lead, and
   could constitute a suitable non-invasive method for measuring trace and
   non-trace element exposure in camelids.},

   Diseases},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Natural killer T cells (NKT) are a subset of T lymphocytes bridging
   innate and adaptive immunity. These cells recognize self and microbial
   glycolipids bound to non-polymorphic and highly conserved CD1d
   molecules. Three NKT cell subsets, type I, II, and NKT-like expressing
   different antigen receptors (TCR) were described and TCR activation
   promotes intracellular events leading to specific functional activities.
   NKT can exhibit different functions depending on the secretion of
   soluble molecules and the interaction with other cell types. NKT cells
   act as regulatory cells in the defense against infections but, on the
   other hand, their effector functions can be involved in the pathogenesis
   of several inflammatory disorders due to their exposure to different
   microbial or self-antigens, respectively. A deep understanding of the
   biology and functions of type I, II, and NKT-like cells as well as their
   interplay with cell types acting in innate (neuthrophils, innate
   lymphoid cells, machrophages, and dendritic cells) and adaptive immunity
   (CD4(+),CD8(+), and double negative T cells) should be important to
   design potential immunotherapies for infectious and autoimmune diseases.},

Abstract = {A sexual dimorphism in liver inflammation and repair was previously
   demonstrated. Its cellular dissection in the course of acute liver
   injury (ALI) was explored. BALB/c mice were treated with carbon
   tetrachloride (CCl4) by intraperitoneal injection and killed after 3, 5,
   and 8 days. Histological and hepatic cell population analyses were
   performed. The correlation between androgen receptor (AR) expression and
   liver recruited inflammatory cells was investigated by treatment with
   the AR antagonist flutamide. Additionally, patients with a diagnosis of
   drug induced liver injury (DILI) were included in the study, with a
   particular focus on gender dimorphism in circulating monocytes. A
   delayed resolution of necrotic damage and a higher expression of
   proinflammatory cytokines were apparent in male mice along with a slower
   recruitment of inflammatory monocytes. F4/80(+)CD11b(+) macrophages and
   CD11b(high)Gr-1(high) monocytes expressed AR and were recruited later in
   male compared with female livers after CCl4 treatment. Moreover,
   CD11b(high)AR+Gr-1(high) recruitment was negatively modulated by
   flutamide in males. Analysis of DILI patients showed overall a
   significant reduction in circulating mature monocytes compared with
   healthy subjects. More interestingly, male patients had higher numbers
   of immature monocytes compared with female patients.
   A stronger cytotoxic tissue response was correlated with an impaired
   recruitment of CD11b(high)AR+Gr-1(high) cells and F4/80(+)CD11b(+)
   macrophages in the early inflammatory phase under AR signaling. During
   DILI, a dimorphic immune response was apparent, characterized by a
   massive recruitment of monocytes to the liver both in males and females,
   but only in males was this recruitment sustained by a turnover of
   immature monocytes.},

Title = {Thromboelastometric assessment of hemostasis following hydroxyethyl
   starch (130/0.4) administration as a constant rate infusion in
   hypoalbuminemic dogs},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},
Month = {JAN 31},
Abstract = {Background: The primary aim was to evaluate by means of
   thromboelastometry (ROTEM) the effects of hydroxyethyl starch (HES)
   130/0.4 administered as a constant rate infusion (CRI) on hemostasis in
   hypoalbuminemic dogs. The second aim was to use ROTEM analysis to detect
   whether all hypoalbuminemic dogs of our population were hypercoagulable.
   Results: The study sample was 20 hypoalbuminemic dogs (albumin < 2 g/dl)
   with normal perfusion parameters and requiring intravenous fluid
   therapy. In order to support plasma colloid osmotic pressure, in
   addition to crystalloid, HES 130/0.4 was administered as a constant rate
   infusion at 1 ml/kg/h (group 1, n=11) or 2 ml/kg/h for 24 h (group 2,
   n=9). Blood samples were collected at baseline (T0) and 24 h
   postinfusion (T1); coagulation was assessed by standard coagulation
   profile (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and
   fibrinogen), and ROTEM analysis (in-TEM (R), ex-TEM (R) and fib-TEM (R)
   profile).
   No statistically significant differences in ROTEM values in group 1 were
   observed (P > 0.05), whereas in group 2 statistically significant
   differences (P < 0.05) were found at T1 in the in-TEM (R) profile
   {[}decrease in clot formation time (P = 0.04) and increase in a angle (P
   = 0.02)] and in the ex-TEM (R) profile {[}increase in maximum clot
   firmness (P = 0.008) and a angle (P = 0.01)]; no changes were identified
   in the fib-TEM (R) profile. In both groups, a statistically significant
   decrease (P = 0.007) in hematocrit was noted, whereas no statistically
   significant differences in platelet count and standard coagulation
   profile were found. In group 2, a statistically significant increase in
   TS values (P = 0.03) was noted at T1. ROTEM tracings indicating a
   hypercoagulable state were observed in 7/20 dogs at T0 (5/11 in group 1
   and 2/9 in the group 2).
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that HES 130/0.4 administered as CRI
   does not cause hypocoagulability in hypoalbuminemic dogs. A trend toward
   hypercoagulability, probably related to the underlying diseases, was
   observed in group 2 at T1.
   Although all dogs were hyoalbuminemic, only 7/20 were hypercoagulable at
   T0, confirming the lack of correlation between albumin level and
   prothrombotic state.},

Abstract = {A juvenile female striped dolphin Stenella coeruleoalba live stranded on
   4 March 2016 at Alassio, western Ligurian Sea coast, Italy. The dolphin
   died shortly after stranding, and a complete postmortem examination was
   performed. Necropsy revealed severe tracheal occlusion and unilateral
   bronchial stenosis with luminal accumulation of abundant green-yellow
   mucous-gelatinous material. Histological features suggestive of
   tracheobronchial aspergillosis were observed. Cultures of lung tissue
   and tracheo-bronchial exudate isolated Aspergillus fumigatus, identified
   by a Microseq D2 LSUrDNA fungal sequencing kit. A pan-Herpesvirus
   nested-PCR assay on frozen samples obtained from multiple organs was
   positive. Phylogenetic analysis on the partial DNA polymerase gene
   revealed that the striped dolphin isolate was closely related to known
   cetacean Alphaherpesvirus sequences from the same host species.
   Attempted virus isolation was unsuccessful. The tissue levels of
   different persistent organic pollutants and the toxicological stress,
   evaluated using a theoretical model, showed a severely impaired immune
   response. This study reports the first case of occlusive mycotic
   tracheobronchitis in a free-living cetacean and the first molecular
   identification of an Alphaherpesvirus in a free-ranging striped dolphin
   stranded on the coast of Italy.},

Abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the common malignancies and is
   an increasingly important cause of cancer death worldwide. Surgery,
   chemotherapy, and radiation therapy extend the 5-year survival limit in
   HCC patients by only 6\%. Therefore, there is a need to develop new
   therapeutic approaches for the treatment of this disease. The orally
   bioavailable proteasome inhibitor MLN2238 (ixazomib) has been
   demonstrated to have anticancer activity. In the present study, we
   investigated the preclinical therapeutic efficacy of MLN2238 in HCC
   cells through in vitro and in vivo models, and examined its molecular
   mechanisms of action. MLN2238 inhibited cell viability in human HCC
   cells HepG2, Hep3B, and SNU475 in a time- and dose-dependent manner.
   Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that MLN2238 induced G2/M cell
   cycle arrest and cellular apoptosis in HCC cells. Cell cycle arrest was
   associated with increased expression levels of p21 and p27.
   MLN2238-induced apoptosis was confirmed by caspase-3/7 activation, PARP
   cleavage and caspase-dependent beta-catenin degradation. In addition,
   MLN2238 activated ER stress genes in HCC cells and increased the
   expression of the stress-inducible gene nuclear protein-1. Furthermore,
   MLN2238 treatment induced upregulation of myeloid cell leukemia-1
   (Mcl-1) protein, and Mcl-1 knockdown sensitized HCC cells to MLN2238
   treatment, suggesting the contribution of Mcl-1 expression to MLN2238
   resistance. This result was also confirmed using the novel Mcl-1 small
   molecule inhibitor A1210477. Association of A1210477 and MLN2238
   determined synergistic antitumor effects in HCC cells. Finally, in vivo
   orally administered MLN2238 suppressed tumor growth of Hep3B cells in
   xenograft models in nude mice. In conclusion, our results offer hope for
   a new therapeutic opportunity in the treatment of HCC patients.},

Abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to estimate, for the first time,
   the human seroprevalence of Q fever in Lebanon, by assessing the
   presence of antibodies against the causative agent, Coxiella burnetii. A
   total number of 421 serum samples (226 females and 196 males) were
   collected in February 2015 from hospitals and laboratories dispersed in
   five Lebanese provinces: Akkar, Bekaa, Mount Lebanon, Nabatieh, and
   South Lebanon.
   Methods: Serial testing approach was used. Samples were first screened
   for IgG phase II antibodies against C. burnetii by Enzyme Linked
   Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Kit. Then, both positive and inconclusive
   sera were reexamined by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) test with the
   aims to confirm and specify the infection status (past or probably acute
   infection) by detecting IgG (I/II) and IgM (I/II) in human sera.
   Results: Screening of 421 samples was estimated to be 38.70\% (95\% CI
   34-43.3) positive samples, 5.90\% (95\% CI 3.7-8.2) suspect samples (as
   doubtful results), and 55.40\% (95\% CI 50.7-60.1) negative samples.
   Furthermore, all positive and suspect samples by ELISA test were
   retested by immunofluorescence assay test (IFAT), and the prevalence of
   positive sample was 37\% and the infection case was recorded: 23.75\%
   (95\% CI 19.7-27.8) samples resulted from past infection, 1.9\% (95\% CI
   0.6-3.2) probably acute infection characterized by several dominance
   clinical symptoms as: fever, cough, headache, difficulty breathing, and
   atypical pneumonia, and 0.23\% (95\% CI 0-0.7) inconclusive sample
   accompanied by different symptoms as bone metastasis and lung cancer.
   Conclusion: The study records the exposition of 37\% of 421 patients to
   C. burnetii distributed in five Lebanese provinces with the highest
   seroprevalence in Bekaa and Akkar provinces and the lowest reported in
   Mount Lebanon. This difference may be due to the presence of high
   density of livestock production and of major agricultural areas in these
   two provinces.},

Abstract = {The Dolphin Morbillivirus (DMV) genome from the first Mediterranean
   epidemic (1990-'92) is the only cetacean Morbillivirus that has been
   completely sequenced. Here, we report the first application of next
   generation sequencing (NGS) to morbillivirus infection of aquatic
   mammals. A viral isolate, representative of the 2006-'08 Mediterranean
   epidemic (DMV\_IZSPLV\_2008), efficiently grew on Vero. DogSLAMtag cells
   and was submitted to whole genome characterization by NGS. The final
   genome length was 15,673 nucleotides, covering 99.82\% of the DMV
   reference genome. Comparison of DMV\_IZSPLV\_2008 and 1990-'92 DMV
   strain sequences revealed 157 nucleotide mutations and 47 amino acid
   changes. The sequence similarity was 98.7\% at the full genome level.
   Whole-genome phylogeny suggested that the DMV strain circulating during
   the 2006-'08 epidemics emerged from the 1990-'92 DMV strain. Viral
   isolation is considered the ``gold standard{''} for morbillivirus
   diagnostics but efficient propagation of infectious virus is difficult
   to achieve. The successful cell replication of this strain allowed
   performing NGS directly from the viral RNA, without prior PCR
   amplification. We therefore provide to the scientific community a second
   DMV genome, representative of another major outbreak. Interestingly,
   genome comparison revealed that the neglected L gene encompasses 74\% of
   the genetic diversity and might serve as ``hypervariable{''} target for
   strain characterization.},

Abstract = {A closer monitoring of tropane alkaloids (TA) in foods is now
   recommended by the European Commission, following a series of alerts
   related to the contamination of buckwheat with weeds of the genus
   Datura. A novel, accurate UHPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated
   for the rapid detection of scopolamine and atropine in buckwheat foods.
   A suitable extraction protocol was set up to maximize recoveries and
   detection limits in different raw, processed and baked foods. The method
   offers good performances in terms of sensitivity, accuracy and
   precision, with LOQs at 0.04 and 0.10 mu g/kg. The established method is
   suitable for routine determination of trace levels of TA and was applied
   to 26 different buckwheat-derived organic foods, detecting TA in 3
   samples (13.9-83.9 mu g/kg for atropine and 5.7-10.4 mu g/kg for
   scopolamine). Only in one case the level of contamination was relevant
   in terms of food safety. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Respiratory explants as a model to investigate early events of
   contagious bovine pleuropneumonia infection},
Journal = {VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {49},
Month = {JAN 12},
Abstract = {Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is a severe disease caused by
   Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides (Mmm). Knowledge on CBPP
   pathogenesis is fragmented and hampered by the limited availability of
   laboratory animal and in vitro models of investigation. The purpose of
   the present study is to assess respiratory explants as useful tools to
   study the early stages of CBPP. Explants were obtained from trachea,
   bronchi and lungs of slaughtered cattle, tested negative for Mycoplasma
   spp. and for the major bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens. The
   interaction of Mmm with explant cells was studied by
   immunohistochemistry (IHC), double-labelling indirect immunofluorescence
   (DLIIF) and laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM). Mmm capability to
   survive and proliferate within the explants was evaluated by standard
   microbiological procedures. Finally, the putative cellular
   internalization of Mmm was further investigated by the gentamicin
   invasion assay. IHC and DLIIF indicated that Mmm can colonize explants,
   showing a marked tropism for lower airways. Specifically, Mmm was
   detected on/inside the bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells, the
   alveolar macrophages and the endothelial cells. The interaction between
   Mmm and explant cells was abolished by the pre-incubation of the
   pathogen with bovine anti-Mmm immune sera. Mmm was able to survive and
   proliferate in all tracheal, bronchial and lung explants, during the
   entire time course of the experiments. LSCM and gentamicin invasion
   assay both confirmed that Mmm can enter non-phagocytic host cells. Taken
   together, our data supports bovine respiratory explants as a promising
   tool to investigate CBPP, alternative to cattle experimental infection.},

Abstract = {Lead ammunition represents a source of poisoning for raptors eating
   game. Although the Peregrine Falcon Falco peregrinus commonly preys on
   gamebirds, only a few cases of lead poisoning have been recorded,
   probably owing to the lack of specific investigations. We document an
   adult female found dead with many lead shot in the digestive tract,
   mixed with the remains of a feral Pigeon Columba livia domestica and a
   European Starling Sturnus vulgaris. Concentrations in heart blood clot,
   liver, kidney and bone suggest that lead poisoning was not the ultimate
   cause of death. However, lead levels in the blood clot suggest that a
   small amount of lead may have been absorbed from the shot. The two prey
   species involved cannot be hunted in Italy but they are intensively shot
   all year round to prevent damage to crops.},

Title = {Insecticide Resistance Associated with kdr Mutations in Aedes
   albopictus: An Update on Worldwide Evidences},
Journal = {BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {2018},
Abstract = {Insecticide resistance is an increasing problem worldwide that limits
   the efficacy of control methods against several pests of health
   interest. Among them, Aedes albopictus mosquitoes are efficient vectors
   of relevant pathogens causing animal and human diseases worldwide,
   including yellow fever, chikungunya, dengue, and Zika. Different
   mechanisms are associated in conferring resistance to chemical
   insecticides. One of the most widespread and analysed mechanisms is the
   knockdown resistance (kdr) causing resistance to DDT and pyrethroids.
   The mechanism is associated with mutations in the voltage sensitive
   sodium channel, which is involved in beginning and propagation of action
   potentials in nervous cells. The mechanism was originally discovered in
   the housefly and then it was found in a large number of arthropods. In
   2011, a kdr associated mutation was evidenced for the first time in A.
   albopictus and afterward several evidences were reported in the
   different areas of the world, including China, USA, Brazil, India, and
   Mediterranean Countries. This review aims to update and summarize
   current evidences on kdr in A. albopictus, in order to stimulate further
   researches to analyse in depth A. albopictus resistance status across
   the world, especially in countries where the presence of this vector is
   still an emerging issue. Such information is currently needed given the
   wellknown vector role of A. albopictus in the transmission of severe
   infectious diseases. Furthermore, the widespread use of chemical
   insecticides for control strategies against A. albopictus progressively
   lead to pressure selection inducing the rise of insecticide
   resistance-related mutations in the species. Such event is especially
   evident in some countries as China, often related to a history of
   uncontrolled use of chemical insecticides. Thus, a careful picture on
   the diffusion of kdr mutations worldwide represents a milestone for the
   implementation of control plans and the triggering of novel research on
   alternative strategies for mosquito-borne infections.},

Abstract = {The field of regenerative medicine is moving toward clinical practice in
   veterinary science. In this context, placenta-derived stem cells
   isolated from domestic animals have covered a dual role, acting both as
   therapies for patients and as a valuable cell source for translational
   models. The biological properties of placenta-derived cells, comparable
   among mammals, make them attractive candidates for therapeutic
   approaches. In particular, stemness features, low immunogenicity,
   immunomodulatory activity, multilineage plasticity, and their successful
   capacity for long-term engraftment in different host tissues after
   autotransplantation, allotransplantation, or xenotransplantation have
   been demonstrated. Their beneficial regenerative effects in domestic
   animals have been proven using preclinical studies as well as clinical
   trials starting to define the mechanisms involved. This is, in
   particular, for amniotic-derived cells that have been thoroughly studied
   to date. The regenerative role arises from a mutual tissue-specific cell
   differentiation and from the paracrine secretion of bioactive molecules
   that ultimately drive crucial repair processes in host tissues (e.g.,
   anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, angiogenic, and neurogenic factors).
   The knowledge acquired so far on the mechanisms of placenta-derived stem
   cells in animal models represent the proof of concept of their
   successful use in some therapeutic treatments such as for
   musculoskeletal disorders. In the next future, legislation in veterinary
   regenerative medicine will be a key element in order to certify those
   placenta-derived cell-based protocols that have already demonstrated
   their safety and efficacy using rigorous approaches and to improve the
   degree of standardization of cell-based treatments among veterinary
   clinicians.},

Abstract = {Salmonella is the second cause of food-borne infection in humans in the
   USA and Europe. Pigs represent the second most important reservoir for
   the pathogen and the consumption of pork meat is a major risk factor for
   human salmonellosis. Here, we evaluated the virulence patterns of eleven
   Salmonella isolated from pigs (carcasses and faces) bred in intensive
   farms in the north of Italy. The two serotypes identified were S.
   Typhimurium and its monophasic variant 1,4,5,12:i:-. None of the
   isolates was an ESBL producer, as confirmed also by PCR. However, the
   presence of a multidrug resistant pattern was evident, with all the
   isolates being resistant to at least to five antimicrobial agents
   belonging to various classes. Moreover, six out of eleven isolates
   showed important resistance profiles, such as resistance against
   colistin and ciprofloxacin, with nine to twelve recorded resistances.
   The isolates were negative for the biofilm synthesis test, while four
   different virulotypes were characterized. All the isolates showed the
   presence of invA, hilA, stn, ssrA, sipC. One sample also harbored ssaR
   and spvC genes. One strain was positive for all the virulence genes
   tested and was resistant to 12 antimicrobial agents. The present study
   contributes new data to the surveillance program for antibiotic
   resistance. Furthermore, the presence of eleven highly virulent isolates
   poses concern for human health in relation to their diffusion in the
   environment.},

Abstract = {We analyzed the concentrations of 20 trace elements in Eurydice
   spinigera (Isopoda) and Flaccisagitta enflata (Chaetognatha), which
   represent a hyperbenthic and a zooplanktonic marine species
   respectively, sharing the same predaceous feeding strategy, from a
   highly productive coastal region (Ligurian Sea, Northwestern
   Mediterranean). The same elements were also quantified in marine
   sediments, where geological anomalies were found for arsenic, chromium
   and nickel. Metal transfer seems to be deeply influenced by different
   habitats. The carnivorous isopod E. spinigera, which spends most of its
   lifetime on the seabed, was found to have the highest concentrations of
   most trace elements, such as Al, As, Cd, Ce, Cr, Fe, La, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se,
   V and Zn, and consequently have the highest bioaccumulation factors
   (BAFs). Moreover, the estimation of biota sediment accumulation factors
   (BSAFs) revealed that cadmium, copper and zinc concentrations were
   higher in the isopod than in the sediment.
   Conversely, in the carnivorous chaetognath F. enflata, which is not a
   benthonic species, the highest levels of copper and tin were found.
   Moreover, arsenic speciation analysis confirmed the presence of
   inorganic As (III + V) in E. spinigera. In the context of utilizing a
   marine organism as a bio-indicator of metal transfer, it is crucial to
   consider both feeding behavior and feeding habitat.},

Abstract = {Background: Nanotechnology is a promising area in industry with a broad
   range of applications including in the agri-food sector. Several studies
   have investigated the potential benefits deriving from use of
   nanomaterials in the context of the whole food chain drawing scenarios
   of benefits but also potential for concerns. Among the agri-food sector,
   animal production has potential for nanomaterial application but also
   for safety concerns due to the possibility of nanomaterial accumulation
   along the farm-to-fork path.
   Scope and Approach: The aim of this work was to define the state of the
   art of nanomaterial applications in the animal production sector by
   assessing data belonging to recently publishes studies. To do this, a
   qualitative synthesis approach was applied to build a fit-for-purpose
   framework and to summarise relevant themes in the context of
   effectiveness, feasibility and health concerns.
   Key findings and conclusions: Nanomaterials have potential for use in a
   wide range of applications from feed production and farming to food
   packaging, including several detection tools designed for the benefit of
   consumer protection. The current high degree of variability in
   nanomaterials tested and in study designs impairs external validation of
   research results. Further research is required to clearly define which
   safe nanomaterial applications have the potential to reach the market.},

Abstract = {People re-identification task has seen enormous improvements in the
   latest years, mainly due to the development of better image features
   extraction from deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the
   availability of large datasets. However, little research has been
   conducted on animal identification and re-identification, even if this
   knowledge may be useful in a rich variety of different scenarios. Here,
   we tackle cattle re-identification exploiting deep CNN and show how this
   task is poorly related with the human one, presenting unique challenges
   that makes it far from being solved. We present various baselines, both
   based on deep architectures or on standard machine learning algorithms,
   and compared them with our solution. Finally, a rich ablation study has
   been conducted to further investigate the unique peculiarities of this
   task.},

Abstract = {Over the last few years a considerable spread of ethnic foods was
   observed in Italy. Among them is the Doner kebab. During 2014-2015, in
   order to evaluate the effectiveness of traditional cooking process, raw
   product (defrosted), sliced cooked portions cut through electric knife
   and assembled sandwich were officially sampled in kebab houses and in a
   local industrial kebab producer in Reggio Emilia (a province in Italy).
   Microbiological researches for safety and hygienic microbiological
   indicators were carried out (research of Salmonella, Listeria
   monocytogenes, Campylobacter and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli;
   enumeration mesophilic aerobic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria,
   sulfite-reducing bacteria growing under anaerobic conditions, yeasts and
   molds). Between the raw and the cooked product an average of 3 log
   reduction in mesophilic aerobic bacteria counts was observed. In two out
   of three kebab houses sampled, which were supplied by the same local
   industrial producer, the presence of L. monocytogenes was detected.
   During the official inspection carried out at the production plant a
   contamination of L. monocytogenes was assessed in both ambient and
   instruments. Furthermore, 3 lots of products were analyzed and all were
   found to be contaminated by L. monocytogenes (always above 100 CFU/g).
   In order to verify the capability of the traditional cooking process to
   reduce the risk of contamination at an acceptable level, a batch of
   naturally contaminated kebab (4.5 log CFU/g) was cooked and sliced
   simulating a day work activity in a kebab shop. The product was then
   sampled during preparation and enumeration of L. monocytogenes was
   obtained. After an hour of cooking, the residual contamination was 1.8
   log CFU/g, after two hours and a half L. monocytogenes was no longer
   detectable in the product, but half an hour later it was again
   detectable in 25g. At the end of the experiment, the contamination grown
   up to the same level enumerated after an hour of cooking (1.8 log
   CFU/g). Considering the microbiological results, traditional cooking
   obtained a rate of -2.40 log CFU/gh(-1), a D=26 min that corresponds to
   a temperature of maximum 60 degrees C (z=6). In conclusion, our
   experiment demonstrates the traditional kebab cooking process could not
   always guarantee a complete product decontamination.},

Abstract = {This trial evaluates the feasibility of using passive injectable
   transponders (PITs) in field operations by testing identification
   procedures on 185 one-year-old Biellese ewes reared under nomadic
   farming conditions. Commercial PITs of 3.85 +/- 0.05 mm x 31.2 mm were
   used at two application sites, the armpit and the retro-auricular
   region. The two application sites were compared taking into account the
   ease of injection, animal reaction, injection duration, inflammatory
   response, PIT readability at up to 12 months post-injection and PIT
   recovery at the slaughterhouse. The injection site influenced the
   reaction of the animal and the ease and duration of the injection, but
   it did not affect the palpation and the reading findings during the
   rearing period. The injection site also influenced the PIT retrieval at
   the slaughterhouse depending on the operator who recovered the PIT. The
   readability values observed at the end of the observation period for
   both injection sites (83\% in the retro-auricular region and 79\% in the
   armpit region) were too low to be suitable for long-term animal
   identification. In addition, the failed retrieval of PITs at slaughter,
   determined the destruction of 40 (22\%) carcases to avoid any risks in
   the food chain. These findings suggest that the limited use of PITs is
   indicated when other methods of electronic identification cannot be
   employed, while a wider application of the device tested in the present
   study is not recommended in farming practices.},

Abstract = {In this short note we present comparable loss rates of honey bee
   colonies during winter 2016/2017 from 27 European countries plus
   Algeria, Israel and Mexico, obtained with the COLOSS questionnaire. The
   14,813 beekeepers providing valid loss data collectively wintered
   425,762 colonies, and reported 21,887 (5.1\%, 95\% confidence interval
   5.0-5.3\%) colonies with unsolvable queen problems and 60,227 (14.1\%,
   95\% CI 13.8-14.4\%) dead colonies after winter. Additionally we asked
   for colonies lost due to natural disaster, which made up another 6,903
   colonies (1.6\%, 95\% CI 1.5-1.7\%). This results in an overall loss
   rate of 20.9\% (95\% CI 20.6-21.3\%) of honey bee colonies during winter
   2016/2017, with marked differences among countries. The overall analysis
   showed that small operations suffered higher losses than larger ones (p
   < 0.001). Overall migratory beekeeping had no significant effect on the
   risk of winter loss, though there was an effect in several countries. A
   table is presented giving detailed results from 30 countries. A map is
   also included, showing relative risk of colony winter loss at regional
   level.},

Volume = {184},
Pages = {31-38},

Abstract = {Most of the antileishmanial modern therapies are not satisfactory due to
   high toxicity or emergence of resistance and high cost of treatment.
   Previously, we observed that two compounds of a small library of
   trans-stilbene and terphenyl derivatives, ST18 and TR4, presented the
   best activity and safety profiles against Leishmania infan turn
   promastigotes and amastigotes. In the present study we evaluated the
   effects of ST18 and the TR4 in 6 different species of Leishmania and the
   modifications induced by these two compounds in the production of 8
   different cytokines from infected macrophages. We observed that TR4 was
   potently active in all Leishmania species tested in the study showing a
   leishmanicidal activity higher than that of ST18 and meglumine
   antimoniate in the most of the species. Moreover, TR4 was able to
   decrease the levels of 1L-10, a cytokine able to render the host
   macrophage inactive allowing the persistence of parasites inside its
   phagolysosome, and increase the levels of 1L-10, a cytokine important

Abstract = {The role of the veterinarian as a public health officer is intrinsic to
   the history and the culture of veterinary organization in Italy. The
   Veterinary service being part of the Health administration since the
   birth of the Italian State in the XIX Century. In the second half of the
   last century the birth of the Italian National Health Service confirmed
   that the function of the Italian veterinary service was to analyze and
   reduce the risks for the human population connected to the relationship
   man-animal-environment, animal health, food safety and security. The
   Italian Veterinary Medicine School curricula, reflected this ``model{''}
   of veterinarian as well. In the majority of countries in the world,
   Veterinary Services are organized within the Agriculture Administration
   with the main function to assure animal health and wellbeing. After the
   so-called ``Mad-cow crisis{''} the awareness of the direct and essential
   role of veterinary services in the prevention of human illness has been
   officially recognized and in the third millennium the old concept of
   ``one health{''} and ``human-animal interface{''} has gained popularity
   worldwide.
   The concept of Veterinary Public Health, has evolved at International
   level and has incorporated the more than a century old vision of the
   Italian Veterinary medicine and it is defined as ``the sum of the
   contributions to the physical, mental and social development of people
   through the knowledge and application of veterinary science{''} (WHO,
   Future trends in veterinary public health. Gruppo di lavoro OMS: TE,
   Italy, 1999, Available from: http://www.who.int/zoonoses/vph/en/. Last
   visited 16 Feb 2016, 1999).
   On the subject of Cooperation, Sustainability and Public Health, the
   EXPO 2015 event and the activities of international organizations WHO,
   FAO and World Organization for Animal Health are refocusing at present
   their worldwide mandate to protect human health and the economy of both
   the poorest Countries and the developed countries, according to the
   ``new{''} concept of Veterinary Public Health.
   Focus of Italian Veterinary Services activity is connected to research,
   diagnosis and epidemiological analysis of infectious diseases, including
   zoonosis, food safety as well as food security.},

Journal = {BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {2018},
Abstract = {The Trypanosoma theileri group includes several trypanosome species
   hardly distinguishable due to the lack of discriminating morphological
   characters. Trypanosomes belonging to this group have been isolated from
   different bovine, ovine, and cervids in Europe, Africa, Asia, and
   Americas. The principal vectors of the T. theileri group are considered
   tabanid flies; however, T. melophagium is transmitted exclusively by
   sheep keds. In 2016, 128 sand flies out of 2,728 trapped in Valsamoggia
   municipality, Italy, were individually dissected and an unknown
   trypanosome strain, named TrPhpl, was isolated from a female of the sand
   fly Phlebotomus perfiliewi. Sequence analysis placed this trypanosome in
   the T. theileri group with very high homology to other trypanosomes
   detected in European cervids. This is the first report of the T.
   theileri group isolation from a sand fly, and the possible role of this
   insect group in the trypanosome transmission cycle is discussed. Within
   the T. theileri group, the phylogenetic analysis distinguished several
   lineages, which, unfortunately, do not correspond with their host
   specificity and their taxonomic status remains ambiguous.},

Abstract = {A total of 205 bluefin and yellowfin tuna samples were examined for
   mercury detection in order to verify possible differences and have a
   detailed risk assessment of the two tuna species. The results showed
   significant higher mercury concentration in muscle tissue of bluefin
   tuna respect yellowfin tuna (p<0.001) with mean concentration of
   0.84mg/kg and maximum value of 1.94mg/kg. These differences can be due
   the different biological and ecological aspects of the two tuna species
   and to different oceanographic aspects between Atlantic Ocean and
   Mediterranean sea. The results obtained in this study suggest an
   advisable containment of the sources of pollution and further studies on
   the closed-loop farming of bluefin tuna, in order to ensure the product
   safety.

Abstract = {To evaluate the ability of Escherichia coli O157 to growth and survival
   on wooden vat surface during the manufacture process and subsequent
   ripening of traditional raw milk cheese, Pecorino Siciliano PDO cheese
   (protected denomination of origin) - made from raw ewes' milk - was used
   as a model system. Two wooden vats were activated with deproteinized
   whey in a dairy pilot plant. One vat was used for control production and
   one for experimental production performed after a massive contamination
   of milk with a multi-strain combination of E. coli O157. Cheese making
   processes were monitored from wooden vats surface to ripened cheese by
   performing microbiological and chemico-physical analysis. The results of
   pH, activity water (a(w)) and LAB concentration showed similar trends in
   both productions. In particular, pH and a(w) decreased during the
   production and ripening while LAB count increased. The specific
   investigation of E. coli O157 in experimental production showed the
   inability of this pathogen to adhere and survive on wooden vat biofilms:
   this may be due to the acidity and the bacteriocin generated by LAB that
   represented efficient barriers to their adhesion. The level of E. coli
   O157 in cheese decreased progressively but their presence was detected
   up to 90 days of ripening showing the ability of this bacteria to
   survive at low values of pH (5.20) and a(w) (0.920). Escherichia coli
   O157 was never detected at 120 days of ripening. These results confirmed
   that the ripening and the synergistic effect among acid condition
   generated by LAB and the low a(w) are able to delete this pathogen from
   raw ewes' milk cheeses.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence and genetic
   characteristics of Arcobacter spp. in bovine bulk tank milk produced in
   Apulia Region (Italy). Samples collected from 396 dairy farms, after
   enrichment in a selective broth, were subjected to an Arcobacter genus -
   specific Real Time PCR. Positive broths, previously filtered, were
   seeded on Karmali, MCCD and Columbia Blood Agar plates; presumptive
   Arcobacter spp. colonies were identified using an amplification and
   sequencing method and then characterized by Multi-Locus Sequence Typing
   (MLST). Prevalence of Arcobacter spp. in bovine milk samples was 5\%
   (20/396); A. butzleri was the only isolated species, in agreement with
   previous studies that reported A. butzleri as the most commonly
   recovered species in milk and dairy products. MLST analysis of the 20 A.
   butzleri strains identified 81 alleles and 16 STs. Consistent with
   previous studies, MLST revealed a high level of heterogeneity between
   the A. butzleri isolates and confirmed the high discriminatory power of
   this method and its suitability for epidemiological investigations. This
   study confirmed the importance of raw milk as a possible source of
   Arcobacter spp. for humans.},

Title = {Impact of bovine respiratory disease on lung lesions, slaughter
   performance and antimicrobial usage in French beef cattle finished in
   North-Eastern Italy},
Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE},

Pages = {1065-1069},
Abstract = {Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a major health concern in beef
   cattle, with several pathogens and environmental risk factors being
   involved. Clinical signs of BRD may remain undetected, preventing proper
   diagnosis. Yet, BRD-associated lung lesions can be detected at
   slaughter, providing a more sensitive way to estimate BRD prevalence, as
   these lesions are present also in subclinically affected animals. In
   April-August 2016, the lungs of 518 Charolaise males from 8 farms in
   North-Eastern Italy were scored at slaughter based on the presence of
   pleural adhesions and the percentage of affected parenchyma. Moreover,
   individual antimicrobial dosages were acquired from the farm registries.
   64\% of animals had at least one lung lesion; a negative association
   between lung lesions and carcass weight was found. No association
   between lung lesions and antimicrobial use was identified. The
   appropriateness of each antimicrobial treatment was evaluated based on
   the ratio between each actual daily dose used and the correspondent
   defined daily dose available in the Summary of Product Characteristics
   (SPC). Three methods based on different estimation of
   live-weight-at-treatment were applied and provided significantly
   different results for some antimicrobial classes. Aminoglycosides and
   high-priority critical anti-microbials like macrolides were those most
   frequently administered (20\% and 42\% of treatments, respectively).
   Evaluation of dosage appropriateness showed that aminoglycosides were
   administered properly in 60-75\% of treatments, while macrolides were
   underdosed in 30-60\% of treatments. In conclusion, this study shows a
   high prevalence of BDR-associated lung lesions at slaughter associated
   with carcass weight, and that antimicrobial use is frequently
   inconsistent with recommended doses.},

Title = {Influence of essential oils in diet and life-stage on gut microbiota and

Volume = {69},

Pages = {318-333},
Abstract = {Developing fish farming to meet the demands of food security and
   sustainability in the 21st century will require new farming systems and
   improved feeds. Diet and microbe interactions in the gut is an important
   variable with the potential to make a significant impact on future fish
   farming diets and production systems. It was monitored the gut
   microbiota of farmed rainbow trout using 16S rRNA profiling over 51weeks
   during standard rearing conditions and feeding diet with supplementation
   of an essential oils (MixOil) mixture from plants (at a concentration in
   diet of 200mg/kg). Gut microbiota 16S rRNA profiling indicated that the
   fish gut was dominated by Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes
   and Firmicutes. Although the dietary supplementation with MixOil had no
   impact on either the composition or architecture of gut microbiota,
   significant changes in alpha and beta diversity and relative abundance
   of groups of gut bacteria were evident during growth stages on test
   feeds, especially upon prolonged growth on finishing feed. Fish fillet
   quality to guarantee palatability and safety for human consumption was
   also evaluated. Significant differences within the gut microbiota of
   juvenile and adult trout under the same rearing conditions were
   observed, The addition of essential oil blend affected some
   physicochemical characteristics of trout fillets, including their
   resistance to oxidative damage and their weight loss (as liquid loss and
   water holding capacity) during the first period of storage, that are two
   important parameters related to product shelf life and susceptibility to
   spoilage. The results highlighted the need for further studies concern
   dietary microbiome modulation at different life stages and its influence
   on animal health, growth performance and final product quality.},

Abstract = {Anaplasma species are globally distributed tick-borne bacteria causing a
   range of clinical conditions in domestic animals, wildlife, and human.
   Nevertheless, data on presence and distribution of Anaplasma strains in
   ticks are still lacking, especially in the Mediterranean region. This
   study reports the molecular identification, genetic characterization and
   phylogeny of Anaplasma strains of both veterinary and zoonotic
   importance in ticks collected from domestic and wild hosts sampled in a
   typical Mediterranean warm temperate region, the island of Sardinia.
   Results reveal the presence of A. ovis in Rhipicephalus bursa and R.
   sanguineus sensu lato ticks; A. platys-like was found in R. bursa ticks;
   while A. platys and A. phagocytophilum were detected in Hyalomma
   marginatum and H. lusitanicum ticks. Investigating the occurrence of
   different Anaplasma species in ticks from domestic and wild hosts
   improves the knowledge of tick-borne diseases in the Mediterranean area,
   and has implications in defining vector species distribution and risk
   assessment.},

Journal = {PATHOGENS AND GLOBAL HEALTH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {112},

Abstract = {Arthropod-borne disease outbreaks, facilitated by the introduction of
   exotic mosquitoes, pose a significant public health threat. Recent
   chikungunya virus (CHIKV) epidemics in Europe highlight the importance
   of understanding the vector potential of invading mosquitoes. In this
   paper we explore the potential of Aedes koreicus, a mosquito new to
   Europe, to transmit CHIKV. Mosquitoes were challenged with CHIKV and
   maintained at two temperatures: 23 degrees C and a fluctuating
   temperature. Total CHIKV infection rates at 3, 10 and 14 days
   post-feeding were low for both temperature treatments (13.8\% at 23
   degrees C; 6.2\% at fluctuating T). A low percentage (6.1\%, n = 65) of
   mosquitoes maintained at a constant 23 degrees C showed dissemination of
   the virus to the wings and legs. Infection of mosquito saliva, with live
   virus, occurred in 2 mosquitoes. No dissemination was noted under the
   fluctuating temperature regime. Based on these results we conclude that
   CHIKV transmission by this species is possible.},

   containing a parasitic mite. Microscopically, subcutaneous tissue showed
   large areas of severe granulomatous inflammation. To our knowledge, this
   is the first record of this poorly known hypoderatid mite in Europe,
   about five thousand kilometers west from the type locality in
   Kirghizstan. The deutonymphal stage of N. (C.) vulturis is redescribed
   following modern standards of taxonomic description for astigmatan

Abstract = {Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), endemic in Africa, Asia,
   Eastern Europe and the Middle East, is caused by a tibovirus (CCHFV)
   transmitted in particular by the Hyalomma genus of the Ixodidae family
   that can remain attached to the host for up to 26 days, which in case of
   migratory birds allows long distance carriage. Although CCHF in domestic
   ruminants is usually subclinical, they may become reservoirs and act as
   sentinels for the introduction and/or circulation of CCHFV.
   In this study, possible CCHFV introduction and circulation in Italy were
   monitored by tick sampling on migratory birds and by a serosurvey
   conducted on sheep. While bird tick sampling was conducted in thirteen
   ringing sites of Central and Southern Italy, the serosurvey was
   performed on flocks grazing in coastal provinces of Central Italy that
   are stop over areas for birds flying from Africa, where Hyalomma ticks
   and CCHFV are endemic, to Central and Northern Europe.
   A total of 282 ticks (80.8\% were Hyalomma spp.) were collected from 139
   (0.28\%) migratory birds of the 50,325 birds checked with 0.22\%
   infested by Hyalomma spp., involving 22 avian species with a mean number
   of 1.6 Hyalomma spp. per infested bird.
   For the serosurvey, 540 sheep sera were randomly collected that resulted
   all negative when examined by an indirect IgG ELISA, employing a
   recombinant antigen coded by the CCHFV S gene.
   While the present study confirmed the introduction of CCHFV potential
   vectors in Central Italy, transported by migratory birds arriving from
   endemic areas, the serosurvey results did not put in evidence the
   concomitant arrival of the virus in the study area during the survey
   period. In general, in areas potentially at risk of CCHFV introduction
   and circulation, structured serological monitoring of susceptible
   domestic animals represents a rational system for an early detection of
   virus circulation.},

Abstract = {The transmission of enteric pathogens by fresh produce depends on the
   survival of the bacteria organisms during the product shelf-life. The
   removal of any potentially hazardous microorganism from the vegetables
   is therefore dependent on the washing and sanitizing techniques employed
   by individual households. For this purpose, in this work we investigated
   the persistence of enteric bacteria, using as model Salmonella enterica
   serovar Napoli (S. Napoli) and Yersinia enterocolitica, in vegetables
   stored at refrigeration temperature (4 degrees C). The efficiency of tap
   water and different chlorine solutions for cleaning vegetables
   experimentally contaminated with Y. enterocolitica were tested. The
   results showed that in lettuce spiked with different concentrations of
   S. Napoli and Y. enterocolitica, both microorganisms were still detected
   after seven days of storage at 4 degrees C. Lettuce contaminated with
   low concentrations of Y. enterocolitica was not decontaminated by
   washing with tap water or with water added with 60 ppm of chlorine. The
   presence of Y. enterocolitica in lettuce was reduced of about 1-2 logs
   after washing with water added with 220 ppm of chlorine. The addition of
   low concentration of chlorine in post harvest washing processes
   represents a useful tool to reduce the contamination of the vegetables,
   with consequent reduction of the risks. However, since complete
   decontamination was not achieved, foodborne infections linked to fresh
   produce can still be possible, although contamination is avoided during
   primary production.},

Abstract = {Within the particular context of controlling chemical residues in food,
   an alternative to targeted approaches has emerged; it consists in the
   characterisation of physiological perturbations induced upon exposure of
   animals to a given chemical substance/class of substances to highlight
   suitable biomarkers addressing safety and/or regulatory issues.
   Metabolomics in particular has been investigated in the hope of
   identifying such biomarkers, and a range of studies have demonstrated
   the efficiency of the strategy. Until very recently, steps remained to
   be taken towards official or commercial implementation of corresponding
   tools. In particular, the lack of guidelines and criteria to validate
   such methods that do not target specific chemical species per se,
   constituted a bottleneck. In the present work, a metabolomics model
   dedicated to the detection of -agonist administration in bovines has
   been developed and fully validated; criteria (selectivity, robustness,
   stability, suspicion threshold definition, false positive and false
   negative rates) have been proposed in agreement with EU expectations
   (Dec 2002/657), enabling demonstration that performances comply with
   screening requirements.Although some of the biomarkers involved in the
   prediction model remain un-elucidated, the corresponding LC-HRMS method
   has recently been ISO17025 accredited, allowing for the very first
   official implementation of a metabolomics based strategy within French
   National Monitoring Plans.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to evaluate the occurrence of Arcobacter spp.
   in food samples collected from Sicilia region. A total of 91 food
   products of animal origin (41 meat, 17 fresh milk, 18 shellfish) and 15
   samples of fresh vegetables, were examined by cultural method and
   confirmed by biochemical analysis and PCR methods. The detection of
   Arcobacter spp. was performed, after selective enrichment, on two
   selective agar plates: Arcobacter agar and mCCD (modified charcoal
   cefoperazone deoxycholate) agar supplemented with CAT (Cefoperazone,
   Amphotericin B and Teicoplanin). Arcobacter species were isolated using
   the membrane filtration technique. In 13 (14.3\%) out of the 91 tested
   samples, the presence of Arcobacter spp. was found: the isolates were
   confirmed by multiplex PCR and identified as belonging to the species A.
   butzleri and A. cryaerophilus. The highest prevalence rate was observed
   in chicken meat (8.8\%) followed by shellfish (3.3\%). Negative results
   have been obtained for raw milks and vegetables samples. The preliminary
   study highlights the importance of this emerging pathogen and the need
   for further studies on its prevalence and distribution in different
   types of food for human consumption.},

Abstract = {Arsenic (As) is a global contaminant of terrestrial and aquatic
   environments posing concern for environmental and human health. The
   effects of subacute concentrations of arsenic trioxide (As-III) and
   dimethylarsinic acid (DMA(V)) were examined using Crandell Rees feline
   kidney (CRFK), human hepatocellular carcinoma (PLC/PRF/5), and
   epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC). Whole monolayer with suffering
   cells (confluence 100\%, pyknosis and refractive cells; value scale=2)
   led to identification of subacute As concentrations for the three cell
   lines. The selected As-III concentrations were 1.33 mu M for CRFK and
   33.37 mu M for PLC/PRF/5 and EPC, at 48hr time point. The selected
   DMA(V) concentrations were 0.67mM for PLC/PRF/5, 1.33mM for CRFK, and
   2.67mM for EPC for 48hr. Unlike the As-III test, the three cell lines
   did not exhibit marked susceptibility to DMA(V)-mediated toxicity.
   Several oxidative stress biomarker levels, directly or indirectly
   associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination including
   superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidases, glutathione
   reductase, glutathione S-transferase, glyoxalase I, glyoxalase II, and
   total glutathione, were determined in the three cell lines at 24 and
   48hr. Antioxidant responses in metal-treated cells were significantly
   altered compared to controls, suggesting a perturbation of redox state.
   The weakening of antioxidant pathway in either healthy or tumoral cells
   was greater using As-III than DMA(V). Differences in level of several
   oxidative stress biomarkers suggest that the oxidative stress mechanism
   induced by As-III is distinctly different from DMA(V). Multifaceted
   mechanisms of action underlying ROS generation in tumor and nontumor
   cells versus As-III and DMA(V) exposure are thus involved. Since
   As-mediated toxicity is quite complex, more data regarding both
   oxidant-enhancement and oxidant-lowering strategies may be useful to
   improve knowledge regarding the influence of As on human and animal
   cells.},

Abstract = {Goats are adapted to live in harsh areas of the world ensuring minimum
   levels of milk and meat production without much economic input. Scrapie
   is a fatal prion disease of small ruminants detected in different
   countries worldwide. Polymorphisms in the prion protein gene (PRNP)
   modify the degree of susceptibility/resistance to scrapie. PRNP
   polymorphisms were analysed in the four main Algerian goat breeds (Naine
   de Kabylie, Arbia, Mozabite, Mekatia), and in two native breeds of South
   Italy (Aspromontana from Calabria and Cilentana from Campania). The
   results were compared also with two previously described Sicilian native
   breeds (Girgentana and Rossa Mediterranea). Seven amino acid
   substitutions were detected in Naine de Kabylie goat which represents
   the original native Berber breed. All other breeds presented no more
   than six variants and common polymorphisms were present at codons, 154
   and 240. Isoleucine at 137 was present in Algerian breeds only. The
   Italian Cilentana shared more variants with Algerian breeds whereas the
   Aspromontana breed was the only one to show a Serine at 127. Exclusive
   new variants were not detected since all polymorphisms were already
   described in other goats worldwide. The scrapie protective allele
   encoding lysine (K) at codon 222 was detected in the Naine de Kabylie
   and M'zabite breeds at low-frequency whereas is present with frequencies
   higher than 10\% in all the Italian breeds reared in regions with
   elevated scrapie incidence. The overall results showed a substantial
   number of polymorphisms in PRNP, particularly in Naine de Kabylie breed,
   which carried also unique genotypes.},

Abstract = {Tick-borne diseases have become a world health concern, emerging with
   increasing incidence in recent decades. Spotted fever group (SFG)
   rickettsiae are tick-borne pathogens recognized as important agents of
   human tick-borne diseases worldwide. In this study, 88 adult ticks from
   the species Hyalomma anatolicum, Rhipicephalus annulatus, Rh. bursa, Rh.
   sanguineus sensu lato, and Rh. turanicus, were collected from farm
   ruminants in Lebanon, and SFG rickettsiae were molecularly identified
   and characterized in these ticks. The screening showed a prevalence of
   68\% for Rickettsia spp., including the species R. aeschlimannii, R.
   africae, R. massiliae and Candidatus R. barbariae, the latter considered
   an emerging member of the SFG rickettsiae. These findings contribute to
   a better knowledge of the distribution of these pathogens and
   demonstrate that SFG rickettsiae with public health relevance are found
   in ticks collected in Lebanon, where the widespread distribution of tick
   vectors and possible livestock animal hosts in contact with humans may
   favor transmission to humans. Few reports exist for some of the tick
   species identified here as being infected with SFG Rickettsia. Some of
   these tick species are proven vectors of the hosted rickettsiae,
   although this information is unknown for other of these species.
   Therefore, these results suggested further investigation on the vector
   competence of the tick species with unknown role in transmission of some
   of the pathogens identified in this study.},

Abstract = {The aim of this multi-institutional study was to identify predictors of
   residual high-grade (HG) disease at re-transurethral resection (reTUR)
   in a large cohort of primary T1 HG/Grade 3 (G3) bladder cancer patients.
   A total of 1155 patients with primary T1 HG/G3 bladder cancer from 13
   academic institutions that underwent a reTUR within 6 weeks after first
   TUR were evaluated. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess
   the association of predictive factors with residual HG at reTUR.
   Residual HG cancer was found in 288 (24.9\%) of patients at reTUR.
   Patients presenting residual HG cancer were more likely to have
   carcinoma in situ (CIS) at first resection (p<0.001), multiple tumors
   (p=0.02), and tumor size larger than 3 cm (p=0.02). Residual HG disease
   at reTUR was associated with increased preoperative
   neutrophil-to-lymphocytes ratio (NLR) (p=0.006) and body mass index
   BMI)>=25 kg/m(2). On multivariable analysis, independent predictors for
   HG residual disease at reTUR were tumor size >3cm (OR = 1.37; 95\% CI:
   1.02-1.84, p=0.03), concomitant CIS (OR 1.92; 95\% CI: 1.32-2.78,
   p=0.00I), being overweight (OR= 2.08; 95\% CI: 1.44-3.01, p<0.001) and
   obesity (OR 2.48; 95\% CI: 1.64-3.77, p<0.001).
   A reTUR in high grade T1 bladder cancer is mandatory as about 25\% of
   patients, presents residual high grade disease. Independent predictors
   to identify patients at risk of residual high grade disease after a
   complete TUR include tumor size, presence of carcinoma in situ, and BMI
   >=25 kg/m(2).},

   Raman-scattering techniques. They are about 100-200 nm in thickness and
   a few tens micrometers in length. Electrochemical characterization of
   alpha-MoO3 plates casted on Pt electrodes was performed by Cyclic
   Voltammetry in phosphate buffer to investigate the properties of this
   material against methanol oxidation. Reported results indicate that
   alpha-MoO3/Pt devices were suitable to promote the electroxidation of

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of peripartum period
   and lactation class on serum beta-hydroxybutyrate, non-esterified fatty
   acids (NEFA), insulin and glucose concentration in dairy cows.
   Thirty-five multiparous Holstein cows were selected from a
   high-producing dairy farm. The animals were divided according to their
   lactation class: second lactation group (L2, n =16), third lactation
   group (L3, n = 10) and fourth lactation group (L4, n=9). Blood sampling
   were performed 7 +/- 5 days before calving (Pre/C) and 7 +/- 5 days
   after calving (Post/C). Two-way analysis of variance was applied to
   determine significant effects of lactation class (L2, L3 and L4) and
   period (Pre/C and Post/C) on studied parameters. Increased NEFA values
   and lower insulin levels were found in Post/C respect to Pre/C in L2 and
   L4. These changes highlight the difficulty of dairy cows to cope with
   the energy demand characterizing the transition period. Improving in
   knowledge of energetic metabolism changes may help to supply a new
   strategy of farm management and reproductive performance in dairy cows
   during the transition period.},

Abstract = {The interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) test measures cell mediated immune
   response (CMI) during the early stages of tuberculosis infection.
   Although Bovine Tuberculosis (BT) spread in feral pigs is widely
   documented in literature, the effectiveness of IFN-gamma in this species
   has been only recently reported. One of the major obstacle of this assay
   is that whole blood samples should be stimulated with purified protein
   derivative (PPD) cocktail within 8 h from the blood sampling.
   This study set up a defined broth culture in which lymphocytes, the cell
   population predominantly responsible for IFN-gamma production, are
   maintained in a steady-state and their vitality is preserved. The
   IFN-gamma production measured from the samples added with the
   maintenance medium and stored at 4 degrees C was similar to the
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) optical density values
   obtained from the same assay performed within 8 h from sampling.},

Abstract = {The presence of corticosteroid residues was assessed in urine and liver
   samples from livestock of Sicily. A total of 630 bovine samples were
   collected from farms and slaughterhouses. The samples were analysed
   using solid-phase extraction (SPE) coupled with ultra-performance liquid
   chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). All the
   corticosteroids found were under the maximum residue limit imposed by
   Commission Regulation (EC) 37/2010. About 4\% of liver samples showed
   dexamethasone levels above the limit of detection (LOD), with a mean of
   1.5 +/- 0.2 mu g kg(-1). Betamethasone was found only in seven liver
   samples, with a mean of 1.6 +/- 0.1 mu g kg(-1). Furthermore,
   prednisolone and prednisone were found only in urine and liver samples
   from slaughterhouse, probably related to the high rate of stress for
   bovines. These results suggest good control practices adopted by
   Sicilian farms, able to ensure the quality of food products.},

Abstract = {The most direct way to estimate the shelf life of a product is to
   conduct simulation tests which are time consuming and expensive.
   Conversely, accelerated shelf life tests can be successfully used for
   stable products having long expected shelf life. The aim of the study
   was directed to verify the possibility to apply an accelerated shelf
   life test to perishable food products having a short-expected shelf
   life, such as a new ready-to-eat processed food preparation, composed
   mainly by cereals, tuna and chicken, packed in thermo-sealed trays and
   pasteurised. Different samples of the product were stored in thermal
   abuse conditions, collected periodically and subjected to determinations
   of TVB-N, pH and sensorial characteristics. Q(10) and activation energy
   were calculated allowing to obtain a predictive evaluation of the
   product shelf life at the 4 degrees C recommended temperature. The
   product shelf life was assessed at 26 days vs the 30 days expected by
   the manufacturer, showing the possibility to apply successfully ASLT for
   products having short shelf life, saving both tune and money.},

Title = {Soya bean meal increases litter moisture and foot pad dermatitis in

Journal = {BRITISH POULTRY SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {59},

Abstract = {1. A 2x2 factorial experiment was conducted to compare the effects of
   wheat or maize based diets differing in dietary electrolyte balance
   (DEB) on litter moisture and foot pad dermatitis (FPD) at 4, 8 and
   12weeks of age in heavy-medium turkeys. A second objective was to
   investigate the effects on foot pad dermatitis of the interaction
   between dietary composition and artificially increasing litter moisture
   by adding water to the litter.2. High DEB diets contained soya as the
   main protein source whereas low DEB diets did not contain soya bean
   meal. Diets were formulated to be iso-caloric and iso-nitrogenous in
   each of 3 successive 4-week phases following recommended dietary
   compositions. DEB concentrations were 330, 290 and 250mEq/kg in high DEB
   diets and 230, 200 and 180mEq/kg in low DEB diets.3. Litter moisture and
   mean FPD score were higher in turkeys fed on high DEB diets compared
   with low DEB diets whereas there was no difference between maize and
   wheat.4. Food intake was similar and body weight was lower after litter
   moisture was artificially raised in the wet compared with the dry litter
   treatment and there was no interaction with dietary composition.5. Mean
   body weight and feed intake were higher in turkeys fed on wheat compared
   with maize and in high DEB compared with low DEB diets at 12weeks of
   age.6. Lowering dietary DEB for turkeys may improve litter moisture and
   lower the prevalence of FPD in commercial turkey flocks.},

Abstract = {Strontium-90 (Sr-90) is a fission product, resulting from the use of
   uranium and plutonium in nuclear reactors and weapons. Consequently, it
   may be found in the environment as a consequence of nuclear fallouts,
   nuclear weapon testing, and not correct waste management. When present
   in the environment, strontium-90 may be taken into animal body by
   drinking water, eating food, or breathing air. The primary health
   effects are bone tumors and tumors of the blood-cell forming organs, due
   to beta particles emitted by both Sr-90 and yttrium-(Y-90). Moreover,
   another health concern is represented by inhibition of calcification and
   bone deformities in animals. Actually, radiometric methods for the
   determination of Sr-90 in animal bones are lacking. This article
   describers a radiochemical method for the determination of Sr-90 in
   animal bones, by ultra low-level liquid scintillation counting. The
   method precision and trueness have been demonstrated through validation
   tests (CV\% = 12.4\%; mean recovery = 98.4\%). Detection limit and
   decision threshold corresponding to 8 and 3 mBecquerel (Bq) kg(-1),
   respectively, represent another strong point of this analytical
   procedure. This new radiochemical method permits the selective
   extraction of Sr-90, without interferences, and it is suitable for
   radiocontamination surveillance programs, and it is also an improvement
   with respect to food safety controls.},

Abstract = {Avian paramyxovirus-1 (APMV-1) is the causative agent of Newcastle
   Disease which affects many species of birds leading to high mortality
   and heavy economic losses among poultry industry worldwide. Newcastle
   disease is endemic in Libya with frequent outbreaks occurring in
   commercial and backyard poultry. APMV-1 was isolated and characterised
   during the outbreak in 2013. In current study, we report another
   Newcastle disease outbreak that emerged in backyard chickens and pigeons
   in Alzintan city on March 2015. Two viruses were detected in cloacal
   swabs from backyard chickens, namely APMV-1/Libya/15VIR5368/2015 and
   APMV-1/Libya/15VIR5371/2015. Genetic sequencing of these viruses
   revealed the presence of velogenic APMV-1 belonging to genotype VIIi
   genetically similar to the viruses isolated on 2013. During the same
   period, neurologic signs and mortality were noticed in pigeons. Samples
   of brain tissue were tested by rRT-PCR which revealed presence of
   velogenic APMV-1 belonging to lineage 4A (GKKRKR{*}F Lin.4A) or genotype
   VIb. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the
   detection and molecular characterization of APMV-1 in a pigeon in Libya.
   The phylogenetic analysis of the F gene showed 86\% identity to isolates
   from Iran and Egypt. This study may indicate the circulation of APMV-1
   within backyard birds and pigeons which may present a threat to
   commercial poultry. Considering these findings, vaccination of backyard
   birds and pigeons and further epidemiological studies are strongly
   strongly recommended.},

Abstract = {Phylogenetic analyses of the complete genomes of the highly pathogenic
   avian influenza (HPAI) 2.3.2.1c H5N1 virus strains causing outbreaks in
   Nigeria's poultry population from 2014 to 2016 showed evidence of
   distinct co-circulating genotypes and the emergence of reassortant
   viruses. One of these reassortants became the predominant strain by
   2016, and the NA protein of this strain possessed the V96A substitution
   known to confer reduced susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibiting
   antiviral drugs. Our findings also demonstrated evolutionary
   relationships between Nigerian isolates and European and Middle Eastern
   strains of H5N1 which provides further evidence for the proposed role of
   migratory birds in spreading the virus, although the involvement of the
   live poultry trade cannot be excluded. Efforts must be directed towards
   improving biosecurity and gaining the cooperation of poultry farmers for
   more effective control of HPAI, in order to mitigate the emergence of
   HPAI strains in Nigeria with biological properties that are potentially
   even more dangerous to animals and humans.},

Abstract = {A serological survey was carried out in Libya to investigate the
   circulation of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) among domestic ruminants A
   total of 857 serum samples were collected from year 2015 to 2016 in
   eleven provinces of Libya belonging to five branches of the country.
   Samples were tested for RVFV antibodies using a competitive Enzyme
   Linked Immunosorbent Assay (c-ELISA). Antibodies specific for RVFV were
   not detected in any of the 857 samples. However, a statistical analysis
   was carried out to assess the maximum expected number of infected
   animals and the maximum expected prevalence of RVFV among Libyan
   ruminants' populations according to the sampled population. The overall
   maximum expected prevalence was estimated to be 1.8\% for cattle and
   0.4\% for small ruminants Results seem to exclude the circulation of
   RVFV, however, a surveillance plan should be implemented in areas at
   risk of RVFV introduction.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of transport
   on welfare traits, several haematological parameters and carcase hygiene
   in two different chicken genotypes (fast- and slow-growing strains)
   reared under free-range conditions. For this aim, two hundred male
   chicks, 100 from fast-growing (Ross 308, R) and 100 from slow-growing
   (Naked Neck, NN) strain were farmed. At the end of the rearing period,
   at 81 days of age, 56 birds/strain were randomly selected for
   slaughtering and submitted to two different pre-slaughter conditions: no
   transport (0h) or 4hours of transport (4h). Tonic immobility (TI), blood
   parameters and carcase hygiene traits were determined. Strain and
   transport significantly affected TI of birds. Both experimental factors
   and their interaction significantly affected plasma creatine kinase,
   alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate
   aminotransferase. Cholesterol and triglycerides were not different
   between the experimental groups, whereas glucose decreased after 4 hours
   of transport in both strains. A significant difference between groups
   for the heterophils/lymphocytes ratio after transport was also observed,
   with NN being higher than Ross. Concerning the oxidative stress, we
   observed a higher ROS production in NN chickens. The carcase microbial
   characteristics showed a higher level of contamination after the
   transport (total viable counts), but not concerning the
   Enterobacteriaceae counts.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to measure the level of activity and
   rumination in young bulls and to assess whether these data can be used
   as indicators of health status and average daily weight gain (ADG). Two
   groups of animals (period 1: n = 108 animals; period 2: n = 106 animals)
   were fitted with sensors to measure daily activity and rumination, were
   weighed on arrival and at the end of the trial (70 days) and were
   checked twice daily to verify their health condition. Any clinical signs
   and therapies were recorded. The dishomogeneity index of rumination
   (DR), and the daily dishomogeneity indices of activity (DDA) and
   rumination (DDR), were calculated. Bulls had an ADG of 1.42 +/- 0.38
   kg/day and showed an average duration of daily rumination of 404 +/- 63
   min and an average activity of 474 +/- 46 bits, respectively. Animals
   characterised by low ADG had lower values of minimum daily rumination (P
   = 0.01) and DDA (P < 0.001), and a greater rumination range (P = 0.007)
   and DR (P = 0.003). Bovine respiratory disease and lameness were
   detected 31 and five times, respectively; among affected animals, the
   average daily activity, rumination and DDA were lower (P < 0.05) at 3-6
   days before the onset of visible clinical signs, whereas DDR increased
   compared to the values when individuals were apparently healthy. The use
   of individual sensors appears promising for the early diagnosis of
   disease in beef cattle and for improving herd management. (C) 2017 The

Abstract = {In rabbit, P. multocida is considered a predominant pathogenic agent;
   despite this, few data on the molecular epidemiology are available so
   far. The aim of this work was to characterize P. multocida isolates from
   rabbit affected by various diseases in Italy. Comparison was made to
   reference strains from other countries. Thirty-nine isolates were tested
   using PCRs to detect the genes coding capsular antigens, virulence
   factors and lipopolysaccharide structures (LPS). Multilocus sequence
   typing (MLST) was performed and 19 STs registered that belonged to 9
   clonal complexes. Italian isolates were all related to P. multocida
   subsp. P. multocida. Three sequence types dominated (ST9, ST50 and
   ST74). The isolates were assigned to capsular types A (20/39), D (9/39)
   and F (10/39), to virulence genes pfhA (13/39), hgbB (21/39) and pjhA +
   hgbB (4/39) (one without virulence factors) and the isolates either
   belonged to the LPS genotypes 3 (22/39) or 6 (17/39). The clonal
   relationships of the Italian strains from rabbit had similarity to
   previously reported rabbit isolates that belonged to ST9, ST74, ST204
   and ST206, however, they differed from other rabbit references strains
   that belonged to six other STs. In particular, ST9 with capsular type F
   has been previously reported from diseased rabbit in Czech Republic and
   ST74 has been observed for older rabbit isolates. ST50 has probably been
   reported from Spain. ST9 and ST50 have previously also been reported
   from birds and pig, respectively, whereas ST74 has exclusively been
   reported from pig. It remains to be investigated if the isolates
   obtained from diseased rabbit in Italy represent introductions from
   other host or they are primarily of rabbit origin.},

Abstract = {Epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) was detected for the first
   time in Tunisia and in other Northern African countries in 2006.The
   objective of the present study was to investigate whether EHDV
   circulated in Tunisian livestock beforeand after the officially-reported
   outbreak of 2006.Thus, serum samples from cattle and dromedaries
   collected in different time periods (before and after 2006) and from
   different regions of Tunisia were screened for the presence of EHDV
   antibodies. Serological investigations conducted on cattle and dromedary
   sera collected in 2000 and 2001 demonstrated no virus circulation on
   these dates. However, viral circulation was evidenced in 2012 and 2013,
   although no EHDV cases were officially reported in these years.
   Serum-neutralization assessed on few ELISA positive samples, confirmed
   the presence of antibodies against EHDV serotype 6, which was the
   serotype involved in the EHDV outbreak in the Maghreb region in 2006.},

Abstract = {Due to favourable climate condition, Italy is a prominent producer of
   different wheat varieties. Several wheat baked goods are produced, but
   the most typical Italian foods, like pasta, pizza and bread, are made of
   durum and common wheat flour. Because of the great importance of wheat
   in the Italian food market, authenticity represents an essential quality
   parameter not only for the producers and regulatory bodies but also for
   consumers. The aim of our study was to test the effectiveness of an
   unconventional non-targeted method for the discrimination of Triticum
   species using direct analysis real time-high-resolution mass
   spectrometry (DART-HRMS). For this purpose, 60 wheat samples including
   durum, common and hulled wheat varieties were collected over two
   consecutive harvest years. Chemometric evaluation revealed an optimal
   sample clustering according to the wheat species and the presence of 18
   significant markers able to discriminate the groups. The discrimination
   power obtained is promising since the use of DART-HRMS can significantly
   reduce the analysis time compared to chromatographic techniques. A
   plausible future commercial and industrial scenario could see the
   application of this analytical approach especially to evaluate the risk
   of substitution of higher value wheat species with lower value flours.},

Abstract = {Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne zoonosis, which may cause
   significant losses for the livestock sector and have serious public
   health implications. Egypt has been repeatedly affected by RVF
   epidemics, mainly associated to the importation of animals from
   sub-Saharan countries, where the disease is endemic. The objective of
   our study was the improvement of the surveillance and control strategies
   implemented in Egypt. In order to do that, first we evaluated the legal
   trade of live animals into and within Egypt. Then, we assessed the risk
   of Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) transmission within the country using
   a multi-criteria evaluation approach. Finally, we combined the animal
   trade and the risk of RVFV transmission data to identify those areas and
   periods in which the introduction of RVFV is more likely. Our results
   indicate that the main risk of RVFV introduction is posed by the
   continuous flow of large number of camels coming from Sudan. The risk of
   RVFV transmission by vectors is restricted to the areas surrounding the
   Nile river, and does not vary significantly throughout the year.
   Imported camels are taken to quarantines, where the risk of RVFV
   transmission by vectors is generally low. Then, they are taken to animal
   markets or slaughterhouses, many located in populated areas, where the
   risk of RVFV transmission to animals or humans is much higher. The
   measures currently implemented (quarantines, vaccination or testing)
   seem to have a limited effect in reducing the risk of RVFV introduction,
   and therefore other (risk-based) surveillance strategies are proposed.},

Abstract = {Several epidemics caused by different bluetongue virus (BTV) serotypes
   occurred in European ruminants since the early 2000. Studies on the
   spatial distribution of these vector-borne infections and the main
   vector species highlighted contrasted eco-climatic regions characterized
   by different dominant vector species. However, little work was done
   regarding the factors associated with the velocity of these epidemics.
   In this study, we aimed to quantify and compare the velocity of BTV
   epidemic that have affected different European countries under
   contrasted eco-climatic conditions and to relate these estimates to
   spatial factors such as temperature and host density. We used the thin
   plate spline regression interpolation method in combination with trend
   surface analysis to quantify the local velocity of different epidemics
   that have affected France (BTV-8 2007-2008, BTV-1 2008-2009), Italy
   (BTV-1 2014), Andalusia in Spain (BTV-1 2007) and the Balkans (BTV-4
   2014). We found significant differences in the local velocity of BTV
   spread according to the country and epidemics, ranging from 7.9 km/week
   (BTV-1 2014 Italy) to 24.4 km/week (BTV-1 2008 France). We quantify and
   discuss the effect of temperature and local host density on this
   velocity.},

Title = {Exploring the use of red fox (Vulpes vulpes) counts during deer censuses
   as a tool to evaluate the fox population trend in the framework of
   disease surveillance},

Abstract = {Improving the knowledge on the distribution and status of the wild
   populations is desirable to inform strategies for disease surveillance,
   early detection and control. This is the case for the red fox in
   North-Eastern Italy, where rabies has been eradicated after a recent
   epizootic but the risk of its re-introduction through the eastern border
   is still acknowledged. Nevertheless, the systematic collection of data
   concerning fox distribution and dynamics remains difficult for many
   reasons, among which the very limited interest for this species and the
   land use changes. Since specific research performed by trained
   personnel, needed for providing accurate estimates of the population
   size and density, implies high expenses and can be maintained only for
   limited periods of time in small sample areas, a possible option is to
   exploit methods as cost-effective as possible, with the aim of a
   continuous monitoring at least of the fox population trend in time. For
   this aim, in this paper we explore the use of the spring night censuses
   for the red deer as a tool for the systematic collection of fox counts.
   This five-year study was carried out in the alpine province of Belluno,
   along the course of two subsequent epizootics in the fox population: the
   first caused by rabies and the second by canine distemper. The fox
   relative abundance (in terms of index ok kilometric abundance - IKA) was
   examined in the light of the consecutive presence of these two viral
   diseases by the passive disease surveillance data, in order to approach
   the use of spring night counts in detecting significant variations in
   the fox population size. The method herein proposed appears promising in
   the detection of these variations, such as those caused by severe
   epizootics, and further investigation aimed at its validation is
   worthwhile for both informing passive surveillance on disease and
   research in fox ecology.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop a liquid chromatography
   tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the determination of
   Ochratoxin A (OTA) and Ochratoxin (OT) in poultry tissues and eggs. The
   two toxins were extracted by a mixture of acetonitrile/water, purified
   with a reversed phase C18 solid phase extraction column (SPE) and
   determined by LC-MS/MS. The LC-MS/MS method performances were evaluated
   in terms of linearity in solvent and in matrix (ranged from 0.5 to 15.10
   mu g L-1 for OTA and from 0.60 to 17.85 mu g L-1 for OT), limit of
   detection (LOD), limit of quantitation (LOQ), specificity, accuracy and
   precision in repeatability conditions. Recovery experiments were
   performed by spiking poultry liver, kidney, muscle and eggs around 1 mu
   g kg(-1) and 10 mu g kg(-1). LODs were 0.27 and 0.26 mu g kg(-1) while
   LOQs were fixed at 1.0 and 1.2 mu g kg(-1) for OTA and OT, respectively.
   Main recoveries for OTA ranged from 82 to 109\% and for OT ranged from
   55 to 89\%. The values of within-laboratory relative standard deviation
   (RSDr) were equal to or below 20\%. Considering the results obtained and
   that all analytical performance criteria were fulfilled, the new
   extraction and purification method developed for OTA and OT
   determination in animal tissues and eggs was found appropriate for
   control laboratories and research activities designed to ensure food
   safety.},

Abstract = {Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a Fusarium toxin, to which humans are frequently
   exposed via diet. Although the elderly are speculated to be sensitive to
   the toxic effects of DON as a result of age-related conditions, disease
   and altered DON metabolism, there is lack of available data on DON
   biomarkers in this age group. This study characterised urinary DON
   concentrations and its metabolites in elderly aged 65years (n=20)
   residing in Hull, UK. Morning urinary specimens were collected over two
   consecutive days together with food records to assess dietary intake
   over a 24h-period prior to each urinary collection. Free DON
   (un-metabolised), total DON (sum of free DON and DON-glucuronides or
   DON-GlcA) and de-epoxy deoxynivalenol (DOM-1) were analysed using a
   validated LC-MS/MS methodology. Total DON above the limit of
   quantification 0.25ng/mL was detected in the urine from 90\% of elderly
   men and women on both days. Mean total DON concentrations on day 1 were
   not different from those on day 2 (elderly men, day 1: 22.2 +/-
   26.3ng/mg creatinine (creat), day 2: 28.0 +/- 34.4ng/mg creat, p=0.95;
   elderly women, day 1: 22.4 +/- 14.6ng/mg creat, day 2: 29.1 +/-
   22.8ng/mg creat, p=0.58). Free DON and DON-GlcA were detected in 60-70\%
   and 90\% of total urine samples, respectively. DOM-1 was absent from all
   samples; the LoQ for DOM-1 was 0.50ng/mL. Estimated dietary intake of
   DON suggested that 10\% of the elderly exceeded the maximum provisional
   tolerable daily intake for DON. In this single-site, UK-based cohort,
   elderly were frequently exposed to DON, although mean total DON
   concentrations were reported at moderate levels. Future larger studies
   are required to investigate DON exposure in elderly from different
   regions of the UK, but also from different counties worldwide.},

Abstract = {In the present study, the genetic relationships as well as the virulome

   coli (STEC) isolates, collected from dairy farms in Italy, were
   investigated in comparison to publicly available genomes collected
   worldwide. The whole genome of Italian isolates was sequenced on
   Illumina MiSeq Platform. Reads quality control, de novo draft genome
   assembly, species confirmation and the 7-loci Multi-Locus Sequence Type
   assignment were performed using INNUca pipeline. Reference-based SNPs
   calling was performed on O157 and O26 genomes, separately, mapping
   contigs to high-quality finished genomes. Virulence and antimicrobial
   resistance determinants were detected in silico using the tool ABRicate.
   Phylogenetic reconstructions revealed that genomes clustered mainly
   based on their 7-loci MLST type. The virulome of tested genomes included
   190 determinants. O157 genomes carried thu genes associated to heme
   mediated iron uptake, whereas O26 genomes harboured genes ybt associated
   to siderophore mediated iron uptake. Resistome analysis showed the
   presence of tet(34) on all but one O157 genomes and on only one O26
   genomes. Only 4 genomes carried genes associated to multiresistance. In
   the present study, the genes chu and ybt were identified as potential
   biomarker for the differentiation of O157 and O26 serotypes.},

Abstract = {Microbiological contamination is one of the main parameters that must be
   assessed to assure the safety of foods produced by a catering system.
   The aim of this study conducted between 2011 and 2015 was to assess the
   microbiological quality of meals (n = 620), work surfaces (n = 621) and
   the operators' hands (n = 319) in a school-deferred catering system. A
   general positive trend regarding the microbial contamination of food
   samples and surfaces was observed. Salmonella spp. and Listeria
   monocytogenes were never detected in prepared foods; moreover, the total
   mesophilic aerobes and the sulfite-reducing clostridia were always below
   the reference limit. The occurrence of Bacillus cereus in raw and cooked
   vegetables highlighted the need for corrective action and suggested that
   continuous monitoring of this toxin-forming microorganism was necessary.
   A critical evaluation of the data obtained from the microbiological
   analyses allowed us to obtain an overview of improvements and emerging

Title = {Liquid formic acid 60\% to control varroa mites (Varroa destructor) in

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL RESEARCH},

Abstract = {We verified the acaricide efficacy on Varroa destructor and the toxicity
   on honey bees of summer treatments carried out in three different
   apiaries in Central Italy with an evaporator filled with 290ml of formic
   acid 60\%. Acaricide efficacy was evaluated counting the number of mites
   killed by the application of formic acid in the evaporator according to
   the indications provided by the producer, while toxicity on honey bees
   of the treatment was evaluated adopting the Liebefeld method. The mean
   acaricide efficacy varied from a minimum of 57.021.8\% to a maximum of
   72.7 +/- 12.5\% and resulted always statistically higher with respect to
   the natural mite fall observed in the untreated groups. Concerning the
   toxicity for the honey bees, we observed only a statistically
   significant reduction of sealed brood with respect to the untreated
   hives in one of the three apiaries. No other statistically significant
   effects on the hive population or queen mortality could be observed.
   Environmental temperatures recorded in the three apiaries during the
   formic acid administration were within the ranges suggested by the
   evaporator producer. Considering the efficacy and toxicity obtained with
   the liquid formic acid treatment, the adopted protocol could represent a
   new sustainable organic tool to control varroa infestation in temperate
   areas. Se ha verificado la eficacia del acaricida sobre Varroa
   destructor y la toxicidad sobre las abejas meliferas de los tratamientos
   de verano realizados en tres colmenares diferentes en Italia Central con
   un evaporador lleno de 290 ml de acido formico al 60\%. La eficacia del
   acaricida se evaluo contando el numero de acaros muertos por la
   aplicacion de acido formico en el evaporador segun las indicaciones
   proporcionadas por el productor, mientras que la toxicidad sobre las
   abejas meliferas del tratamiento se evaluo mediante el metodo de
   Liebefeld. La eficacia media del acaricida vario de un minimo de 57.0
   +/- 21.8\% a un maximo de 72.7 +/- 12.5\% y siempre resulto
   estadisticamente mas alta con respecto a la caida natural de acaros
   observada en los grupos no tratados. En cuanto a la toxicidad para las
   abejas meliferas, solo observamos una reduccion estadisticamente
   significativa de la cria operculada con respecto a las colmenas no
   tratadas en uno de los tres colmenares. No se pudo observar ningun otro
   efecto estadisticamente significativo sobre la poblacion de las colmenas
   o la mortalidad de reinas. Las temperaturas ambientales registradas en
   los tres colmenares durante la administracion del acido formico
   estuvieron dentro de los rangos sugeridos por el productor del
   evaporador. Teniendo en cuenta la eficacia y la toxicidad obtenidas con
   el tratamiento de acido formico liquido, el protocolo adoptado podria
   representar una nueva herramienta organica sostenible para controlar la
   infestacion de varroas en zonas templadas.},

Abstract = {The microsporidiosis of the endangered white-clawed crayfish
   Austropotamobius pallipes complex has generally been attributed to only
   one species, Thelohania contejeani, the agent of porcelain disease.
   Species identification was mostly assessed by macroscopic examination or
   microscopic evaluation of muscle samples rather than by molecular or
   ultrastructural analyses. A survey conducted on A. pallipes complex
   populations in Northern Italy highlighted the presence of two different
   microsporidia causing similar muscular lesions, T. contejeani and an
   undescribed octosporoblastic species Vairimorpha austropotamobii sp.
   nov. Mature spores and earlier developmental stages of V.
   austropotamobii sp. nov. were found within striated muscle cells of the
   thorax, abdomen, and appendages of the crayfish. Only octosporoblastic
   sporogony within sporophorous vesicles (SPVs) was observed.
   Diplokaryotic sporonts separated into two uninucleate daughter cells,
   which gave rise to a rosette-shaped plasmodium, and eight uninucleate
   spores were produced within the persistent SPV. Ultrastructural features
   of stages in the octosporoblastic sequence were similar to those
   described for Vairimorpha necatrix, the type species. Mature spores were
   pyriform in shape and an average of 3.9 x 2.2 mu m in size. The polar
   filament was coiled 11-14 times, lateral to the posterior vacuole. The
   small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rRNA) and the large subunit RNA
   polymerase II gene (RPB1) of V. austropotamobii sp. nov. were sequenced
   and compared with other microsporidia. The highest sequence identity of
   SSU rRNA (99\%) and RPB1 (74\%) genes was with the amphipod parasite
   Nosema granulosis and subsequently with V. cheracis, which infects the
   Australian yabby Cherax destructor. In our work we discuss about the
   reasons for placing this new species in the genus Vairimorpha. In
   addition, we provide for T. contejeani a RPB1 gene sequence,
   supplemental sequences of SSU rRNA gene and ultrastructural details of
   its sporogony in the host A. pallipes complex.},

Abstract = {The incidence of allergic disease is globally increasing so much that
   food allergy is actually considered as one of the main diseases of
   civilization, as well as among the major costs for healthcare worldwide.
   In such a scenario, the recent legislations introduced from European
   Union to protect consumers drastically drive the need for rapid,
   sensitive, and robust techniques to detect allergens within foodstuffs.
   We here report on an innovative immunorecognition method for
   beta-lactoglobulin milk allergen detection, based on microcantilever
   resonator arrays, a promising class of biosensors. An original sandwich
   assay that uses the same polyclonal antibody as capture and secondary
   immunorecognition agent was proposed to overcome the low affinity of the
   simple direct method. The developed immunoassay showed better Limit Of
   Detection (LOD) and Limit Of Quantification (LOQ) than commercial ELISA
   plates, even after an aging of four months. To our knowledge, this work
   represents the first example in the literature of successfully
   immunodetection of milk allergens in low concentrations by
   microcantilever resonator arrays, thus opening new perspectives on
   alternative diagnostic tools for milk allergens screening tests. (C)

Abstract = {Milk is an important and beneficial food from a nutritional point of
   view, being an indispensable source of high quality proteins.
   Furthermore, it is a raw material for many dairy products, such as
   yoghurt, cheese, cream etc. Before reaching consumers, milk goes through
   production, processing and circulation. Each step involves potentially
   unsafe factors, such as chemical contamination that can affect milk
   quality. Antibiotics are widely used in veterinary medicine for dry cow
   therapy and mastitis treatment in lactating cows, which can cause the
   presence of antimicrobial residues in milk. In order to ensure
   consumers' safety, milk is analyzed to make sure that the fixed Maximum
   Residue Limits (MRLs) for antibiotics are not exceeded. Multiclass
   methods can monitor more drug classes through a single analysis, so they
   are faster, less time-consuming and cheaper than traditional methods
   (single-class); this aspect is particularly important for milk, which is
   a highly perishable food. Nevertheless, multiclass methods for
   veterinary drug residues in foodstuffs are real analytical challenges.
   This article reviews the major multiclass methods published for the
   determination of antibiotic residues in milk by liquid chromatography
   coupled to mass spectrometry, with a special focus on sample preparation
   approaches.},

Abstract = {The present work was carried out to investigate the microbiological
   profile of Sicilian ewes' ricotta cheeses during fifteen years of
   investigations (2002-2016). The samples were collected between those
   conferred to the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Sicilia
   (IZSSi) Adelmo Mirri, Palermo (Italy), by the competent authority during
   official control, by food business operator in HACCP systems and in
   research projects. Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli and
   coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS) were found only in some samples.
   Bacillus cereus was detected in c.a. 16\% of samples but the level of
   contaminations did not reach the threshold that leads to significant
   toxin production. Pathogenic bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes,
   Salmonella spp. and Brucella spp. were never detected. Furthermore, a
   total of 47 of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains were identified at
   species level by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene, resulting in the
   identification of 10 species belonging to four genera Enterococcus,
   Lactobacillus, Lactococcus and Leuconostoc, commonly employed as starter
   and non starter cultures in different traditional cheese. Results of
   this study highlighted an improvement of the hygienic conditions of the
   Sicilian ewes' ricotta cheeses during the last ten years of
   investigation. This observation was confirmed from reduction of
   undesired microorganisms such as Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli and CPS,
   used to define the process hygiene criteria. However, in order to
   improve the final quality of this product are needed further strategy
   such as the dairy makers training, with the aim to apply a good hygienic
   practices during the production.},

Abstract = {The National Reference Center for equine infectious anemia (EIA)
   validated a commercial ELISA (Eradikit (R) EIAV Indirect ELISA,
   In3diagnostie (R), Turin, Italy) employing a chimeric recombinant gag
   and env peptide for the detection of EIA virus antibodies, following the
   guidelines of the World Organization for Animal Health. The validation
   parameters evaluated were: analytical sensitivity (Se) and specificity
   (Sp); diagnostic Se and Sp; precision, based on repeatability and
   reproducibility through the estimation of the standard deviation (SD)
   and the coefficient of variation (CV); accuracy, estimated from a
   multiple K and relative Sp and Se with respect to those of the agar gel
   immunodiffusion test (AGIDT). Positive and negative predictive values
   were also defined.
   The assay showed a high specificity and a limit of detection of 1.43
   log(10) major than AGIDT. Diagnostic Se was 100\% and Sp was 99.3\%,
   while SD values ranged from 1.58 to 5.01 with a CV between 2.8\% and
   28.8\%. Multiple K was 0.98 and relative Se and Sp were respectively
   99.1\% and 100\%.
   The assay proved to be robust and to possess a high sensitivity in
   detecting first antibodies produced at onset of infection as well as
   high analytic and diagnostic Se and Sp values, confirming it as a
   serological assay fit for purpose within EIA surveillance programs.},

Abstract = {The domestic cat (Felis catus) was used as a sentinel of exposure to
   polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) in indoor urban environments y. Sera from 120
   cats were pooled to form 30 different groups selected by age (<2 years;
   > 2 <= 8 years; > 8 years), sex, municipality (Bologna and Turin) and
   environment (indoor vs. outdoor). Test portions of 1 mL were analyzed by
   means of gas chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry
   (GC-HRMS) for six selected indicators non-dioxin-like PCBs (Sigma 6
   PCBs: congeners \#28, \#52, \#101, \#132, \#153 and \#180) and the
   results were computed in the upper-bound mode. The internal dose of PCBs
   attributable to the cats' alimentary lipid intake ranged from 32.4 to
   1,446 ng/g (P50 165; mean 258). The Wilcoxon test revealed significantly
   lower PCB burden in outdoor groups than in indoor groups. Age correlated
   well with the heptachlorinated and most bio-accumulative congener, PCB
   \#180, and slightly with hexachlorinated PCBs \#138 and \#153.
   Contamination attributable to house dust collected in 15 living-rooms
   ranged from 10.0 to 279 ng/g dry weight (P50 97.4; mean 94.4). Exposure
   estimates indicated a 0.6-16 ng/kg bw range of daily Sigma 6 PCB intake
   from a default value of 200 mg/cat of dust ingestion. The intake of PCBs
   due to dust ingestion fell within the same order of magnitude as that
   computed from a 60g daily intake of commercial dry pet foods, while
   inhalation accounted for 0.21-8.2ng/kg bw/day, on setting the nominal
   Sigma 6 PCB contamination in outdoor and indoor air at 0.37 and 15
   ng/m(3), respectively. Italian indoor cats could be exposed to higher
   levels of Sigma 6 PCBs than the Reference Dose (RfD) of 10 ng/kg/bw/day;
   this supports the World Health Organization's statement that the quality
   of the indoor environment is a major determinant of health.},

Abstract = {Small ruminant lentivirus infections in goats affect both production and
   animal welfare. This represents a threat to the qualitative and
   quantitative growth of goat farming, recently observed in mountainous
   regions such as the Autonomous Province of Bolzano - South Tyrol
   (Italy). To monitor and eradicate the caprine arthritis encephalitis
   virus in this goat population, a compulsory eradication campaign was
   launched, based on a strict census of small ruminants and yearly
   serological testing of all animals, followed by the consequent culling
   of seropositive individuals. The campaign succeeded in completely
   eliminating cases of clinical disease in goats, while drastically
   reducing the seroprevalence at the herd as well as individual animal
   level. The serological outcome of the introduced control measures was
   determined using commercially available ELISA kits, demonstrating their
   suitability for use in this type of campaign, aimed at reducing
   seroprevalence as well as clinical manifestations of these infections.
   However, this clear success is diminished by the failure to achieve a
   complete eradication of these viruses. The reasons leading to the
   observed tailing phenomenon and the occurrence of new infections in
   already sanitised flocks are discussed and implementation of further
   measures are proposed.},

Abstract = {Brucellosis is a disease caused by bacteria belonging to the genus
   Brucella, which is endemic in sub-Saharan African countries, including
   Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe has a widespread dairy industry with peri-urban dairy
   establishments built in order to improve milkavailability to rural
   communities.This study has been the first attempt to estimate the
   prevalence of brucellosis in Zimbabwe as a whole, using samples
   submitted to the Central veterinary laboratory between 2010 and 2014. A
   total of 156 farms were tested with Rose Bengal Test (RBT), Complement
   Fixation Test (CFT) and Milk Ring Test (MRT). Parallel testing was used
   to determine whether or not a farm was to be considered positive: 30.1\%
   (95\% C.I.: 23.5\% - 37.8\%) of the farms tested were found positive
   (47/156). Harare district had the highest number of sample submissions
   with 6 out of 17 farms testing positive (P = 37.5\%; 95\% C.I.: 18.4\% -
   61.7\%). Awareness of milk-borne zoonoses is reportedly generally low in
   farmers (41.5\%).This is even more the case in small-holder farmers who
   have higher likelihoods of selling or ingesting raw milk compared with
   dairy farmers. The results show the need to carry out surveillance of
   brucellosis in cattle in Zimbabwe to understand the spatial distribution
   of the disease in the country. This is particularly relevant given the
   zoonotic and economic implications of this disease.},

Abstract = {1.An experiment was conducted to compare 5 different methods for the
   evaluation of litter moisture.2. For litter collection and assessment,
   55 farms were selected, one shed from each farm was inspected and 9
   points were identified within each shed.3. For each device, used for the
   evaluation of litter moisture, mean and standard deviation of wetness
   measures per collection point were assessed.4. The reliability and
   overall consistency between the 5 instruments used to measure wetness
   were high (=0.72).5. Measurement of three out of the 9 collection points
   were sufficient to provide a reliable assessment of litter moisture
   throughout the shed.6. Based on the direct correlation between litter
   moisture and footpad lesions, litter moisture measurement can be used as
   a resource based on-farm animal welfare indicator.7. Among the 5 methods
   analysed, visual scoring is the most simple and practical, and therefore
   the best candidate to be used on-farm for animal welfare assessment.},

Title = {Highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5N1 Clade 2.3.2.1c virus in poultry

Abstract = {In May 2016, highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of the subtype
   A/H5N1 was detected in Cameroon in an industrial poultry farm at
   Mvog-Betsi, Yaounde (Centre region), with a recorded sudden increase of
   deaths among chickens, and an overall mortality rate of 75\%. The virus
   spread further and caused new outbreaks in some parts of the country. In
   total, 21 outbreaks were confirmed from May 2016 to March 2017 (six in
   the Centre, six in the West, eight in the South and one in the Adamaoua
   regions). This resulted in an estimated total loss of 138,252 birds
   (44,451 deaths due to infection and 93,801 stamped out). Only domestic
   birds (chickens, ducks and geese) were affected in farms as well as in
   poultry markets. The outbreaks occurred in three waves, the first from
   May to June 2016, the second in September 2016 and the last wave in
   March 2017. The topology of the phylogeny based on the haemagglutinin
   gene segment indicated that the causative H5N1 viruses fall within the
   genetic clade 2.3.2.1c, within the same group as the A/H5N1 viruses
   collected in Niger in 2015 and 2016. More importantly, the gene
   constellation of four representative viruses showed evidence of
   H5N1/H9N2 intra-clade reassortment. Additional epidemiological and
   genetic data from affected countries in West Africa are needed to better
   trace the origin, spread and evolution of A/H5N1 in Cameroon.
   RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS
   HPAI A/H5N1 was detected in May 2016 in domestic chickens in
   Yaounde-Cameroon.
   Twenty-one outbreaks in total were confirmed from May 2016 to March
   2017.
   The causative H5N1 viruses fall within the genetic clade 2.3.2.1c.
   The viral gene constellation showed evidence of H5N1/H9N2 intra-clade
   reassortment.},

Abstract = {Non-toxigenic V. parahaemolyticus isolates (tdh(-)/trh(-)/T3SS2(-)) have
   recently been isolated from patients with gastroenteritis. In this study
   we report that the larvae of the wax moth (Galleria mellonella) are
   susceptible to infection by toxigenic or non-toxigenic clinical isolates
   of V. parahaemolyticus. In comparison larvae inoculated with
   environmental isolates of V. parahaemolyticus did not succumb to
   disease. Whole genome sequencing of clinical non-toxigenic isolates
   revealed the presence of a gene encoding a nudix hydrolase, identified
   as mutT. A V. parahaemolyticus mutT mutant was unable to kill G.
   mellonella at 24 h post inoculation, indicating a role of this gene in
   virulence. Our findings show that G. mellonella is a valuable model for
   investigating screening of possible virulence genes of V.
   parahaemolyticus and can provide new insights into mechanisms of
   virulence of atypical non-toxigenic V. parahaemolyticus. These findings
   will allow improved genetic tests for the identification of pathogenic
   V. parahaemolyticus to be developed and will have a significant impact
   for the scientific community.},

Abstract = {The illegal use of glucocorticoids (GCs) as growth-promoters (GPs) is
   prohibited in farm animals in the European Union because the strong
   pharmacological activity of most synthetic GCs produces residues that
   are dangerous for human consumption. Among the alternative methods
   proposed to increase the efficacy of official controls, histology was
   the technique of choice in Italy on account of its high performance
   level. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of
   immunohistochemistry (IHC) using anti-cleaved-Lamin A antibody to
   enhance the performance of the histological test applied to GC-related
   microscopic changes in the thymus. Veal calves (VC) and beef cattle (BC)
   were raised and both underwent different growth-promoting protocols or
   were left untreated. The morphology of the thymus parenchyma was
   evaluated for cortical atrophy with concurrent adipose tissue
   infiltration, and a score of 1 to 3 was attributed. A semi-quantitative
   IHC analysis was also performed by counting the number of positive
   thymocytes in 5 randomly selected high-power fields (HPFs). The
   distribution of the thymus atrophy scores was significantly different
   among the subgroups in both BC and VC. The IHC values were higher in
   untreated than in treated animals, for both BC and VC. The association
   between thymus atrophy score and IHC positivity showed higher median
   values in control than in treated animals (independently of the
   treatment protocol), for both BC and VC. Our data shows that IHC against
   anti-cleaved-Lamin A antibody is a reliable marker to detect illegal GC
   treatments, administered either alone or in association with other
   growth promoters, in both BC and VC. Combining IHC with the thymus
   atrophy score improves the accuracy of the histological method in
   correctly identifying treated animals and could represent a valuable,
   reproducible method to be applied to large-scale screening programmes.},

Abstract = {In this paper we show that the active interplay of nonlinear kinetics
   and transport phenomena in a chemical oscillator can be exploited to
   induce and control chaos. To this aim we use as a model system the
   ferroin-catalysed Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) oscillating reaction, which
   is known to evolve to characteristic chaotic transient dynamics when
   carried out under batch and unstirred conditions. In particular,
   chemical chaos was found to appear and disappear by following a
   Ruelle-Takens-Newhouse (RTN) scenario. Here we use medium viscosity as a
   bifurcation parameter to tune the reaction-diffusion-convection (RDC)
   interplay and force the reaction in a specific sequence of dynamical
   regimes: either (i) periodic -> quasi-periodic -> chaotic or (ii)
   periodic -> quasi-periodic or (iii) only periodic. The medium viscosity
   can be set by adding different amounts of surfactant (sodium dodecyl
   sulphate), known to have a little impact on the reaction mechanism,
   above its critical micelle concentration. Experimental results are
   supported by means of numerical simulations of a RDC model, which
   combines self-sustained oscillations to the related chemically-induced
   buoyancy convection.},

Abstract = {The adoption of high-througput technologies demonstrated that in mature
   spermatozoa are present proteins that are thought to be not present or
   active in sperm cells, such as those involved in control of cell cycle.
   Here, by using an in silico approach based on the application of
   networks theory, we found that Cyclins/Cdk complexes could play a
   central role in signal transduction active during capacitation. Then, we
   tested this hypothesis in the vitro model. With this approach,
   spermatozoa were incubated under capacitating conditions in control
   conditions (CTRL) or in the presence of Aminopurvalanol A a potent,
   selective and cell permeable inhibitor of Cyclins/Cdk complexes at
   different concentrations (2, 10, and 20 mu M). We found that this
   treatment caused dose-dependent inhibition of spermfertilizing ability.
   We attribute this event to the loss of acrosome integrity due to the
   inhibition of physiological capacitation-dependent actin polymerization,
   rather than to a detrimental effect on membrane lipid remodeling or on
   other signaling pathways such as tubulin reorganization or MAPKs
   activation. In our opinion, these data could revamp the knowledge on
   biochemistry of sperm capacitation and could suggest new perspectives in
   studying male infertility.},

Abstract = {Background: Today's globalised and interconnected world is characterized
   by intertwined and quickly evolving relationships between animals,
   humans and their environment and by an escalating number of accessible
   data for public health. The public veterinary services must exploit new
   modeling and decision strategies to face these changes. The organization
   and control of data flows have become crucial to effectively evaluate
   the evolution and safety concerns of a given situation in the territory.
   This paper discusses what is needed to develop modern strategies to
   optimize data distribution to the stakeholders.
   Main text: If traditionally the system manager and knowledge engineer
   have been concerned with the increase of speed of data flow and the
   improvement of data quality, nowadays they need to worry about data
   overflow as well. To avoid this risk an information system should be
   capable of selecting the data which need to be shown to the human
   operator. In this perspective, two aspects need to be distinguished:
   data classification vs data distribution. Data classification is the
   problem of organizing data depending on what they refer to and on the
   way they are obtained; data distribution is the problem of selecting
   which data is accessible to which stakeholder. Data classification can
   be established and implemented via ontological analysis and formal logic
   but we claim that a context-based selection of data should be integrated
   in the data distribution application. Data distribution should provide
   these new features: (a) the organization of situation types
   distinguishing at least ordinary vs extraordinary scenarios
   (contextualization of scenarios); (b) the possibility to focus on the
   data that are really important in a given scenario (data
   contextualization by scenarios); and (c) the classification of which
   data is relevant to which stakeholder (data contextualization by users).
   Short conclusion: Public veterinary services, to efficaciously and
   efficiently manage the information needed for today's health and safety
   challenges, should contextualize and filter the continuous and growing
   flow of data by setting suitable frameworks to classify data, users'
   roles and possible situations.},

Title = {Coronavirus and paramyxovirus in bats from Northwest Italy},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Month = {DEC 22},
Abstract = {Background: Bat-borne virus surveillance is necessary for determining
   inter-species transmission risks and is important due to the wide-range
   of bat species which may harbour potential pathogens. This study aimed
   to monitor coronaviruses (CoVs) and paramyxoviruses (PMVs) in bats
   roosting in northwest Italian regions. Our investigation was focused on
   CoVs and PMVs due to their proven ability to switch host and their
   zoonotic potential. Here we provide the phylogenetic characterization of
   the highly conserved polymerase gene fragments.
   Results: Family-wide PCR screenings were used to test 302 bats belonging
   to 19 different bat species. Thirty-eight animals from 12 locations were
   confirmed as PCR positive, with an overall detection rate of 12.6\%
   {[}95\% CI:9.3-16.8]. CoV RNA was found in 36 bats belonging to eight
   species, while PMV RNA in three Pipistrellus spp. Phylogenetic
   characterization have been obtained for 15 alpha-CoVs, 5 beta-CoVs and
   three PMVs; moreover one P. pipistrellus resulted co-infected with both
   CoV and PMV. A divergent alpha-CoV clade from Myotis nattereri SpA is
   also described. The compact cluster of beta-CoVs from R. ferrumequinum
   roosts expands the current viral sequence database, specifically for
   this species in Europe. To our knowledge this is the first report of
   CoVs in Plecotus auritus and M. oxygnathus, and of PMVs in P. kuhlii.
   Conclusions: This study identified alpha and beta-CoVs in new bat
   species and in previously unsurveyed Italian regions. To our knowledge
   this represents the first and unique report of PMVs in Italy. The 23 new
   bat genetic sequences presented will expand the current molecular
   bat-borne virus databases. Considering the amount of novel bat-borne
   PMVs associated with the emergence of zoonotic infections in animals and
   humans in the last years, the definition of viral diversity within
   European bat species is needed. Performing surveillance studies within a
   specific geographic area can provide awareness of viral burden where
   bats roost in close proximity to spillover hosts, and form the basis for
   the appropriate control measures against potential threats for public
   health and optimal management of bats and their habitats.},

Abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is the major cause of foodborne diseases
   worldwide. In this retrospective study, 84 S. aureus strains were
   characterized. The collection comprises 78 strains isolated during 1998
   and 2014 from dairy products and tissue samples from livestock bred for
   dairy production in Sicily. One isolate was obtained from a pet (dog),
   one from an exotic animal (a circus elephant), and four human isolates
   were obtained during a severe food poisoning outbreak that occurred in
   Sicily in 2015. All the strains were characterized by pulsed-field gel
   electrophoresis (PFGE), for antibiotic resistance and presence of toxin
   genes. PFGE results showed 10 different pulsotypes, with three
   relatively frequent and three unique. The antibiotic resistance
   profiling showed that penicillin G (35.7\%) and tetracycline (20.2\%)
   resistance is largely spread. Most isolates contained at least one toxin
   gene making them a potential threat for public health. Enterotoxin sec
   gene was observed in 28.6\% and seg in 23.8\% of the strains,
   respectively; the human isolates were the only ones to concurrently
   harbor both seg and sei genes. In addition, 24 isolates were randomly
   selected and analyzed by multilocus sequence typing. Interestingly, the
   analysis showed the presence of 12 sequence types (STs), of which 6 were
   novel. One of them, ST700, was detected in 29\% of the isolates and was
   found to be spread throughout Sicily. ST700 has been present in the
   island for almost 16 years (1998-2014) and it shows no host preference
   since it was isolated from different ruminant species. Four human
   isolates shared both the pulsotype (PT10) and the sequence type (ST9),
   as well as the virulence genes (seg-sei); this observation suggests that
   the isolates originated from a single clone, although they were obtained
   from two different individuals.},

Title = {Detection and full genome characterization of two beta CoV viruses
   related to Middle East respiratory syndrome from bats in Italy},
Journal = {VIROLOGY JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Background: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV),
   which belongs to beta group of coronavirus, can infect multiple host
   species and causes severe diseases in humans. Multiple surveillance and
   phylogenetic studies suggest a bat origin. In this study, we describe
   the detection and full genome characterization of two CoVs closely
   related to MERS-CoV from two Italian bats, Pipistrellus kuhlii and
   Hypsugo savii.
   Methods: Pool of viscera were tested by a pan-coronavirus RT-PCR. Virus
   isolation was attempted by inoculation in different cell lines. Full
   genome sequencing was performed using the Ion Torrent platform and
   phylogenetic trees were performed using IQtree software. Similarity
   plots of CoV clade c genomes were generated by using SSE v1.2. The three
   dimensional macromolecular structure (3DMMS) of the receptor binding
   domain (RBD) in the S protein was predicted by sequence-homology method
   using the protein data bank (PDB).
   Results: Both samples resulted positive to the pan-coronavirus RT-PCR
   (IT-batCoVs) and their genome organization showed identical pattern of
   MERS CoV. Phylogenetic analysis showed a monophyletic group placed in
   the Beta2c clade formed by MERS-CoV sequences originating from humans
   and camels and bat-related sequences from Africa, Italy and China. The
   comparison of the secondary and 3DMMS of the RBD of IT-batCoVs with
   MERS, HKU4 and HKU5 bat sequences showed two aa deletions located in a
   region corresponding to the external subdomain of MERS-RBD in IT-batCoV
   and HKU5 RBDs.
   Conclusions: This study reported two beta CoVs closely related to MERS
   that were obtained from two bats belonging to two commonly recorded
   species in Italy (P. kuhlii and H. savii). The analysis of the RBD
   showed similar structure in IT-batCoVs and HKU5 respect to HKU4
   sequences. Since the RBD domain of HKU4 but not HKU5 can bind to the
   human DPP4 receptor for MERS-CoV, it is possible to suggest also for
   IT-batCoVs the absence of DPP4-binding potential. More surveillance
   studies are needed to better investigate the potential intermediate
   hosts that may play a role in the interspecies transmission of known and
   currently unknown coronaviruses with particular attention to the S
   protein and the receptor specificity and binding affinity.},

Title = {Season-long control of flea and tick infestations in a population of
   cats in the Aeolian archipelago using a collar containing 10\%

Journal = {VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY},

Abstract = {Cats that have outdoor access are highly exposed to ticks, fleas, mites
   and flying insects, though the risk to become infested by arthropods is
   less perceived in cats than in dogs. This has resulted in fewer
   treatment and prevention options being available for cats than for dogs.
   A collar containing a combination of 10\% imidacloprid and 4.5\%
   flumethrin (Seresto (R) Bayer Animal Health) is available for cats and
   licensed with claims against ticks and fleas for 7-8 months. Following
   the assessment of the efficacy of the collar against Leishmania infanlum
   infection in privately owned cats living in the Aeolian archipelago,
   herein we report the efficacy of the collar in the treatment and
   prevention of tick and flea infestations in the same population of cats
   over a period of one year of observation. At the inclusion day (Study
   Day 0, SD 0), cats were visited and examined for ectoparasites (i.e.,
   flea combing and tick thumb counts) and allocated to group 1 (G1; n =
   104; cats treated with Seresto (R) collar) or group 2 (G2; n = 100;
   untreated controls) and further checked at SDs 210, 270 and 360 (study
   closure). At SD 0, G1 and G2 had a comparable percentage of cats
   infested by fleas (45.2\% and 49.0\%; chi(2) = 0.164; P = 0.6859) and
   ticks (6.7\% and 14.0\%; chi(2) = 2.946; P = 0.0861). The number of cats
   infested by fleas was reduced in G1, being 8.3\%, 0\% and 3.8\% on SDs
   210, 270 and 360, respectively, resulting in efficacies against fleas of
   79.4\%, 100\% and 93.6\% on SDs 210, 270 and 360. None of the cats in G1
   was found infested by ticks after the application of the collar, whereas
   in G2 ticks were observed on 15.7\%, 4.8\%, 17.5\% of the cats at the
   different follow up visits, leading to an overall efficacy against ticks
   of 100\%. A total of 375 ectoparasites were collected from cats, being
   249 fleas (six Ctenocephalides canis, 240 Ctenocephalides fells and
   three Nosopsyllus fasciatus) and 126 ticks (87 Ixodes ventalloi and 39
   Rhipicephalus pusillus). Field data gathered herein confirm a high
   efficacy of the collar in the prevention of tick and flea infestations
   on cats. This is of great importance both for the primary role of fleas
   and ticks as blood feeding parasites and, more importantly, because of
   their role as vectors of pathogens causing diseases of veterinary and
   medical importance.},

Abstract = {An innovative analytical strategy has been applied to identify signature
   peptides able to distinguish among processed animal proteins (PAPs)
   derived from bovine, pig, fish, and milk products. Proteomics was first
   used to elucidate the proteome of each source. Starting from the
   identified proteins and using a funnel based approach, a set of abundant
   and well characterized peptides with suitable physical-chemical
   properties (signature peptides) and specific for each source was
   selected. An on-target LC-ESI-MS/MS method (MRM mode) was set up using
   standard peptides and was then applied to selectively identify the PAP
   source and also to distinguish proteins from bovine carcass and milk
   proteins. We believe that the method described meets the request of the
   European Commission which has developed a strategy for gradually lifting
   the ``total ban{''} toward ``species to species ban{''}, therefore
   requiring official methods for species-specific discrimination in feed.},

Title = {Listeria monocytogenes in Gorgonzola cheese: Study of the behaviour

Abstract = {As reported on RASFF's portal, in the first 9 months of 2016, a total of
   13 ``alerts/information for attention{''} were issued concerning the
   presence of Listeria monocytogenes in mould cheeses throughout Europe.
   This study analyzes the behaviour of L. monocytogenes in Gorgonzola
   cheese, a typical Italian soft blue-veined cheese, when contaminated at
   different time points. In the first challenge test, the pasteurized milk
   was contaminated and the complete cheese manufacture (cheesemaking,
   ripening) and shelf life was simulated.
   After a decrease during the first days of the cheesemaking, the pH
   remained constant for 35 days (5 weeks) and then it increased rapidly
   reaching the final values of 6.8 +/- 0.02 in the core and 5.8 +/- 0.4 on
   the rind. At the same time, the pathogen concentration decreased (about
   2 log CFU/g), although during the last week a rapid pathogen growth was
   observed after the rise in pH values.
   When the cheese was stored at thermal abuse condition (8-12 degrees C),
   the pathogen concentration on the rind was 4.8 +/- 0.3 log CFU/g and
   after 66 days (about 9 weeks) no significant difference (p > 0.05) was
   observed; whereas, a growth from 5.4 +/- 0.4 to 7.1 +/- 0.5 log CFU/g
   was observed in the core. A second challenge test was performed using
   three batches of commercial slices of Gorgonzola cheese inoculated by L
   monocytogenes and stored at 8 degrees C. The maximum specific growth
   rates (mu(max), 1/h) of L. monocytogenes estimated ranged from 0.007 to
   0.061. The square root model was used to predict the mu(max) at others
   temperature and to establish the time necessary to reach the European
   critical legal limit of 2 log CFU/g, in different storage scenarios. The
   predictions obtained in this study can be applied to any
   time-temperature profile, and in particular to the conditions to which
   the product is most likely to be subject in normal use, up to its final
   consumption. This study can be considered a valuable contribution also
   aimed at supporting the monitoring surveys carried out by officers of
   the Regional Veterinary Authority.},

Title = {Pestivirus infection in cattle dairy farms: E2 glycoprotein ELISA
   reveals the presence of bovine viral diarrhea virus type 2 in
   northwestern Italy},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Month = {DEC 4},
Abstract = {Background: Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) types 1 and 2 are members
   of the Pestivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family. This genus also
   includes the HoBi-like virus, tentatively classified as BVDV type 3.
   BVDV-1 is widely distributed in Italy despite the extensive use of
   BVDV-1-based vaccines, while BVDV-2 and HoBi-like Pestivirus have been
   detected occasionally. Monitoring the occurrence of sporadic or atypical
   pestiviruses is a useful approach to evaluate the need for additional
   vaccine strains that can be used in BVDV control programs.
   Results: In this study we developed a multiwell antibody ELISA based on
   the recombinant E2 protein of the three bovine pestiviruses. We
   evaluated the assay's applicability for surveillance purposes using
   pooled milk samples, each prepared from a maximum of 35 lactating cows
   and collected from 176 dairy herds. As expected, the majority of the
   pooled samples reacted to a greater extent against the BVDV-1 E2
   antigen. All three milk pools from a single farm reacted to the BVDV-2
   antigen, however. Further analysis using spot tests, antigen detection,
   and sequence analysis of the 5'-UTR region confirmed the presence of
   five persistently infected calves carrying a BVDV-2a strain.
   Conclusions: This study highlights for the first time that sporadic
   circulation of BVDV-2 can be predicted by immunoenzymatic methods in the
   absence of specific vaccination.},

Title = {Approaches and Perspectives for Development of African Swine Fever Virus
   Vaccines},
Journal = {VACCINES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {African swine fever (ASF) is a complex disease of swine, caused by a
   large DNA virus belonging to the family Asfarviridae. The disease shows
   variable clinical signs, with high case fatality rates, up to 100\%, in
   the acute forms. ASF is currently present in Africa and Europe where it
   circulates in different scenarios causing a high socio-economic impact.
   In most affected regions, control has not been effective in part due to
   lack of a vaccine. The availability of an effective and safe ASFV
   vaccines would support and enforce control-eradication strategies.
   Therefore, work leading to the rational development of protective ASF
   vaccines is a high priority. Several factors have hindered vaccine
   development, including the complexity of the ASF virus particle and the
   large number of proteins encoded by its genome. Many of these virus
   proteins inhibit the host's immune system thus facilitating virus
   replication and persistence. We review previous work aimed at
   understanding ASFV-host interactions, including mechanisms of protective
   immunity, and approaches for vaccine development. These include live
   attenuated vaccines, and subunit vaccines, based on DNA, proteins, or
   virus vectors. In the shorter to medium term, live attenuated vaccines
   are the most promising and best positioned candidates. Gaps and future
   research directions are evaluated.},

Abstract = {Animal botulism is primarily due to botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) types C,
   D or their chimeric variants C/D or D/C, produced by Clostridium
   botulinum group III, which appears to include the genetically
   indistinguishable Clostridium haemolyticum and Clostridium novyi.
   In the present study, we used matrix-assisted laser
   desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF MS) to
   identify and characterize 81 BoNT-producing Clostridia isolated in 47
   episodes of animal botulism.
   The instrument's default database, containing no entries for Clostridium
   botulinum, permitted reliable identification of 26 strains at the genus
   level. Although supplementation of the database with reference strains
   enhanced the instrument's ability to identify the neurotoxic strains at
   the genus level, resolution was not sufficient to recognize field
   strains at species level.
   Characterization by MALDI TOF confirmed the well-documented phenotypic
   and genetic differences between Clostridium botulinum strains of
   serotypes normally implicated in human botulism (A, B, E, F) and other
   Clostridium species able to produce BoNTs type C and D. The chimeric and
   non-chimeric field strains grouped separately. In particular, very low
   similarity was found between two non-chimeric type C field strains
   isolated in the same outbreak and the other field strains. This
   difference was comparable with the differences among the various
   Clostridia species included in the study.
   Characterization by MALDI TOF confirmed that BoNT-producing Clostridia
   isolated from animals are closely related and indistinguishable at the
   species level from Clostridium haemolyticum and Clostridium novyi
   reference strains. On the contrary, there seem to be substantial
   differences among chimeric and some non-chimeric type C strains. (C)

Abstract = {Several arthropod-borne diseases are now rising with increasing impact
   and risks for public health, due to environmental changes and resistance
   to pesticides currently marketed. In addition to community surveillance
   programs and a careful management of herds, a next-generation of
   effective products is urgently needed to control the spread of these
   diseases, with special reference to arboviral ones. Natural product
   research can afford alternative solutions. Recently, a re-emerging of
   bluetongue disease is ongoing in Italy. Bluetongue is a viral disease
   that affects ruminants and is spread through the bite of bloodsucking
   insects, especially Culicoides species. In this review, we focused on
   the importance of vector control programs for prevention or bluetongue
   outbreaks, outlining the lack of effective tools in the fight against
   Culicoides vectors. Then, we analyzed a field case study in Sardinia
   (Italy) concerning the utilization of the neem cake (Azadirachta
   indica), to control young instar populations of Culicoides biting
   midges, the vectors of bluetongue virus. Neem cake is a cheap and
   ecofriendly by-product obtained from the extraction of neem oil.
   Overall, we propose that the employ of neem extraction by-products as
   aqueous formulations in muddy sites close to livestock grazing areas may
   represent an effective tool in the fight against the spread of
   bluetongue virus in the Mediterranean areas.},

Abstract = {Objective: To investigate some pathogenic characters of Salmonella
   enterica strains isolated from poultry.
   Methods: Twenty-three genetically distinct Salmonella enterica strains,
   of different serovars and pulsotype, were examined for virulence traits.
   Resistance to gastric acid environment was estimated by measuring the
   percentage of survived bacterial cells after exposure for 2 h to a
   synthetic gastric juice. Strains were analyzed with PCR for the presence
   of the following virulence genes: mgtC and rhuM located on SPI-3, sopB
   and pipB located on SPI-5, Salmonella virulence plasmid (spv) R (spvR),
   spvB and spvC located on Salmonella plasmid virulence and sodCI, sopE,
   and gipA located on prophage. Finally, resistance to 21 antibiotics was
   tested with Kirby-Bauer method.
   Results: A percentage of 82.60\% of strains were resistant to gastric
   environment after induction and 60.87\% of the strains exhibited
   constitutive resistance too. Nineteen different virulence profiles were
   detected. The phage related genes sodCI and sopE and the plasmid
   mediated operon spvR, spvB and spvC (spvRBC) were detected in 82.60\%,
   47.82\% and 52.17\% of strains, respectively. Typhimurium and
   Enteritidis strains showed the highest number of virulence genes.
   Twenty-one different antibiotic resistance profiles were obtained and
   two isolates (Typhimurium and Enteritidis) resulted sensible to all the
   tested molecules. The ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamide and
   tetracycline resistance profile was detected in seven isolates
   (30.43\%).
   Conclusion: Our results show that paratyphoid Salmonella strains with
   several characters of pathogenicity, that may be cause of severe
   pathology in animals and humans, are circulating among poultry.},

Title = {First report of a fish kill episode caused by pyrethroids in Italian
   freshwater},
Journal = {FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {281},
Pages = {176-182},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Introduction: Fish kills are events of strong emotional impact on the
   population because of the frequent suspicion that they can be the result
   of serious pollution accidents. As a matter of fact, they are often due
   to natural occurrences, such as low levels of dissolved oxygen in the
   water, but in many cases the causes remain unknown. Fish are
   particularly sensitive to pesticides and pyrethroids are reported to be
   the most ecotoxicologically active in the aquatic environment.
   Nevertheless, the reported cases of massive wild fish mortalities due to
   these toxicants are very few. This paper describes a fish kill episode
   occurred in the Padua Province (Veneto Region - North Eastern Italy)
   which involved several fish species and for which it was possible to
   identify the cause in the presence of pyrethroids in the water.
   Case presentation: When a whitish liquid coming from the rainwater drain
   of an industrial area was seen to be spilling into a drainage channel, a
   fish massive mortality was noticed and investigated. The collected water
   samples showed the presence of relevant concentrations of cypermethrin,
   permethrin, deltamethrin and tetramethrin. Analyses on the fish tissues
   revealed the presence of cypermethrin and permethrin at a concentration
   range of 476-2834 mg/kg and 346-2826 mg/kg on a lipid basis,
   respectively.
   Discussion: According to the results of the performed analyses, we can
   reasonably state that the described episode had been caused by the
   exposure of biota to high concentrations of pyrethroids. The present
   case report significantly contributes to the limited literature
   available on pesticides-related fish kills. Moreover, it highlights the
   importance of sharing protocols for fish kill management at a national
   level, as this would help to better define the roles of the different
   institutions involved and to improve the investigation and the reporting
   of these events. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV) is a lentivirus with an almost
   worldwide distribution that causes persistent infections in equids.
   Technical limitations have restricted genetic analysis of EIAV field
   isolates predominantly to gag sequences resulting in very little
   published information concerning the extent of inter-strain variation in
   pol, env and the three ancillary open reading frames (ORFs). Here, we
   describe the use of long-range PCR in conjunction with next-generation
   sequencing (NGS) for rapid molecular characterization of all viral ORFs
   and known transcription factor binding motifs within the long terminal
   repeat of two EIAV isolates from the 2006 Italian outbreak. These
   isolates were from foals believed to have been exposed to the same
   source material but with different clinical histories: one died 53days
   post-infection (SA) while the other (DE) survived 5months despite
   experiencing multiple febrile episodes. Nucleotide sequence identity
   between the isolates was 99.358\% confirming infection with the same
   EIAV strain with most differences comprising single nucleotide
   polymorphisms in env and the second exon of rev. Although the
   synonymous:non-synonymous nucleotide substitution ratio was
   approximately 2:1 in gag and pol, the situation is reversed in env and
   ORF3 suggesting these sequences are subjected to host-mediated selective
   pressure. EIAV proviral quasispecies complexity invivo has not been
   extensively investigated; however, analysis suggests it was relatively
   low in SA at the time of death. These results highlight advantages of
   NGS for molecular characterization of EIAV namely it avoids potential
   artefacts generated by traditional composite sequencing strategies and
   can provide information about viral quasispecies complexity.},

Abstract = {In January 2015, during a 3-week period, 12 captive Tonkean macacques at
   a sanctuary in Italy died. An orthopoxvirus infection was suspected
   because of negative-staining electron microscopy results. The diagnosis
   was confirmed by histology, virus isolation, and molecular analysis
   performed on different organs from all animals. An epidemiologic
   investigation was unable to define the infection source in the
   surrounding area. Trapped rodents were negative by virologic testing,
   but specific IgG was detected in 27.27\% of small rodents and 14.28\% of
   rats. An attenuated live vaccine was administered to the susceptible
   monkey population, and no adverse reactions were observed; a detectable
   humoral immune response was induced in most of the vaccinated animals.
   We performed molecular characterization of the orthopoxvirus isolate by
   next-generation sequencing. According to the phylogenetic analysis of
   the 9 conserved genes, the virus could be part of a novel clade, lying
   between cowpox and ectromelia viruses.},

Abstract = {We sampled 417 swallows in a wetland ecosystem of Zimbabwe in February
   2010 and October 2011. RT-PCR tests revealed circulation of avian
   paramyxovirus type I, avian influenza and West Nile disease viruses in
   these populations. We discuss the relevance of these findings in
   relation to what is known on the epidemiology of these viruses in these
   hosts and in relation to the host ecology. We conclude with
   recommendations to focus more research on Passeriformes in disease
   ecology and in particular on the hirundinidae family.},

Abstract = {Poxvirus was the causative agent of two unusual outbreaks of
   proliferative glossitis in canary (Serinus canaria forma domestica)
   breeders in the Northern Italy. A total of 45, 7-9-mo-old canaries were
   submitted in fair postmortem conditions to the Istituto Zooprofilattico
   Sperimentale delle Venezie at the beginning of November 2005 for
   diagnostic investigation. Birds belonged to two unrelated and
   geographically distant aviaries in northern Italy, herein identified as
   Aviary A and Aviary B. The two breeder flocks had both attended the same
   bird exposition held at the beginning of October and started
   experiencing an onset of high mortality 3 wk after the show. Twelve red
   factor-melanin canaries from Aviary A (Mantua) and 33 dominant white and
   recessive white canaries from Aviary B (Vicenza) were submitted for
   laboratory investigations. Clinical signs were unspecific and consisted
   of depression, ruffling of the feathers, epistaxis, and anorexia due to
   decreased feed and water intake. Postmortem findings revealed a severe
   increase in volume, thickening, and hardening of the tongue, which had
   turned pinkish to dark brown. No apparent gross lesions were noticed in
   integumentary, respiratory, and digestive systems or other internal
   organs. Histopathologic evaluation of the tongue revealed severe
   proliferation of the stratified squamous epithelium containing numerous
   large eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies (Bollinger bodies)
   displacing the nuclei of the cells peripherally. Severe ulceration of
   the surface epithelium, fibrinoheterophilic plaque formation, and
   moderate basal lymphoplasmacytic infiltrations were also associated with
   the proliferative lesion. Poxvirus was successfully isolated from the
   lesions in tissue cultures but not in specific-pathogen-free chicken
   embryonated eggs. Typical large, brick-shaped viral particles of 300-450
   nm were also observed in affected tongues by transmission electron
   microscopy. This is the first report of multiple outbreaks of ``poxvirus
   glossitis'' in canaries.},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Volume = {601},

Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The incidence of pesticides in poisoned baits recovered from 2005 to
   2014 in Italian northern regions of Emilia Romagna and Lombardy was
   analysed. A total of 956 baits tested positive for pesticides during the
   study period. In 9.3\% (n = 89) of the baits analysedmore than one toxic
   compound was present. Insecticides (53.2\%) proved to be the pesticides
   most commonly involved followed by rodenticides (34.3\%), molluscicides
   (12.3\%) and herbicides (0.2\%). Among insecticides, the
   anticholinesterases (organophosphates and carbamates) were themost
   frequently detected (59.1\%, n = 412) followed by organochlorines
   (39.8\%; n = 277). Anticoagulants proved to be the rodenticides most
   commonly involved (78.5\%; n = 353) with many baits containing
   brodifacoum or bromadiolone, while metaldehyde was the most used
   molluscicide (88.2\%; n = 142). A high number of baits contained banned
   pesticides such as endosulfan, methamidophos, carbofuran and strychnine
   indicating that the restrictions and the bans on the use of toxic and
   highly toxic pesticides are not accompanied by a lower use in poisoned
   baits. The high incidence of banned pesticides detected in the present
   survey is extremely worrying and poses the question of where and how
   these compounds were obtained. Efforts have to bemade to reduce this
   illegal practice and its environmental impact. Moreover, education and
   awareness campaigns should be instituted. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {FOOD CONTROL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {82},
Pages = {184-189},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Enterococci are significant nosocomial pathogens, also owing to their
   antibiotic resistance (AR). They can also be found in coastal marine
   sediments due to carriage by sewage and agricultural runoff. Clams are
   filter-feeding molluscs living in sandy bottoms. To investigate the
   possible role of clams as reservoirs of AR traits transmissible to
   humans, 46 enterococci isolated from clams collected in the mid-Adriatic
   Sea were analysed for species distribution, phenotypic/genotypic
   resistance to a large panel of antibiotics, and carriage of the relevant
   AR genes; 41 blood isolates collected during the same period were also
   analysed. Antibiotic-resistant strains and AR genes were more common in
   blood isolates, whereas OJD resistance and blaZ were only detected in
   clam isolates; 24.2\% of resistant clam isolates were multidrug
   resistant (MDR). Biofilm production ability and adhesion to Int407
   cells, assayed in selected MDR strains, were both greater in the blood
   isolates. Our data suggest that enterococci found in clams have a
   different origin from those found in humans and that they may contribute
   to spread AR against drugs that are still clinically effective and to
   the emergence of MDR strains via the food chain. Enterococci should thus
   be included in the microbiological surveillance of seafood. (C) 2017

Abstract = {The genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae includes some of the
   most important examples of emerging zoonotic arboviruses that are
   rapidly spreading across the globe. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV),
   West Nile virus (WNV), St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) and Usutu
   virus (USUV) are mosquito-borne members of the JEV serological group.
   Although most infections in humans are asymptomatic or present with mild
   flu-like symptoms, clinical manifestations of JEV, WNV, SLEV, USUV and
   tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) can include severe neurological
   disease and death. In horses, infection with WNV and JEV can lead to
   severe neurological disease and death, while USUV, SLEV and TBEV
   infections are mainly asymptomatic, however, and induce antibody
   responses. Horses often serve as sentinels to monitor active virus
   circulation in serological surveillance programmes specifically for WNV,
   USUV and JEV. Here, we developed and validated a NS1-antigen protein
   microarray for the serological differential diagnosis of flavivirus
   infections in horses using sera of experimentally and naturally infected
   symptomatic as well as asymptomatic horses. Using samples from
   experimentally infected horses, an IgG and IgM specificity of 100\% and
   a sensitivity of 95\% for WNV and 100\% for JEV was achieved with a
   cut-off titre of 1:20 based on ROC calculation. In field settings, the
   microarray identified 93-100\% of IgG-positive horses with recent WNV
   infections and 87\% of TBEV IgG-positive horses. WNV IgM sensitivity was
   80\%. Differentiation between closely related flaviviruses by the
   NS1-antigen protein microarray is possible, even though we identified
   some instances of cross-reactivity among antibodies. However, the assay
   is not able to differentiate between naturally infected horses and
   animals vaccinated with an inactivated WNV whole-virus vaccine. We
   showed that the NS1-microarray can potentially be used for diagnosing
   and distinguishing flavivirus infections in horses and for public health
   purposes within a surveillance setting. This allows for fast, cheap,
   syndrome-based laboratory testing for multiple viruses simultaneously
   for veterinary and public health purposes.},

Abstract = {Recently, bovine viral diarrhoea virus type 2c (BVDV-2c) was responsible
   for a severe outbreak in cattle in northern Europe. Here, we present the
   results of an epidemiological survey for pestiviruses in ruminants in
   southern Italy. Pooled serum samples were obtained from 997 bovine, 800
   ovine, 431 caprine and eight bubaline farms, and pestiviral RNA was
   detected by molecular methods in 44 farms consisting of 16 cattle and
   one buffalo herds and of 21 sheep and six goat flocks. Twenty-nine and
   15 farms were infected by BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 strains, respectively.
   BVDV-1 strains were recovered mainly from cattle and were heterogeneous,
   belonging to the subtypes 1b, 1u, 1e, 1g and 1h. In contrast, all BVDV-2
   viruses but two were detected in sheep or goats and were characterized
   as BVDV-2c by sequence analysis of 5UTR. These strains displayed high
   genetic identity to BVDV-2c circulating in cattle in northern Europe and
   were more distantly related to a BVDV-2c isolate recovered from a cattle
   herd in southern Italy more than 10years before. The circulation of a
   BVDV-2c in small ruminants suggests the need for a continuous
   surveillance for the emergence of pestivirus-induced clinical signs in
   southern Italian farms.},

Abstract = {Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis: (MAP) causes a contagious
   chronic infection results in Johne's disease in a wide range of animal
   species, including cattle. Several genome-wide association studies
   (GWAS) have been carried out to identify loci putatively associated with
   MAP susceptibility by testing each marker separately and identifying
   SNPs that show a significant association with the phenotype, while SNP
   with modest effects are usually ignored. The objective of this study was
   to identify modest-effect genes associated with MAP susceptibility using
   a pathway-based approach. The Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip was used to
   genotype 966 Holstein cows, 483 positive and 483 negative for antibody
   response to MAP, data were then analyzed using novel SNP-based Gene Set
   Enrichment Analysis (GSEA-SNP) and validated with Adaptive Rank
   Truncated Product methodology. An allele-based test was carried out to
   estimate the statistical association for each marker with the phenotype,
   subsequently SNPs were mapped to the closest genes, considering for each
   gene the single variant with the highest value within a window of 50 kb,
   then pathway-statistics were tested using the GSEA-SNP method. The GO
   biological process ``embryogenesis and morphogenesis{''} was most highly
   associated with antibody response to MAP. Within this pathway, five
   genes code for proteins which play a role in the immune defense relevant
   to response to bacterial infection. The immune response genes identified
   would not have been considered using a standard GWAS, thus demonstrating
   that the pathway approach can extend the interpretation of genome-wide
   association analyses and identify additional candidate genes for target
   traits.},

Abstract = {Pre-slaughter transportation may affect poultry welfare and mortality
   rates. A retrospective analysis was conducted to examine the effect of
   environmental, management and individual factors on the percentage of
   dead birds during pre-slaughter transportation (dead-on-arrival, DOA).
   The variables accounted for in the analyses included: environmental
   temperature, travel duration, genetic line, gender, crate type and crate
   stocking density. Among the 41 452 loads of turkeys (34 696 388 birds)
   and 3241 of end of lay hens (21 788 124 birds) transported to three
   large abattoirs in northern Italy in a 3-year period, the median DOA was
   0.14\% in turkeys, and 0.38\% in hens. In turkeys, travel duration
   longer than 30 min, temperature higher than 26 degrees C and high
   in-crate densities were associated with increased DOA. In winter (2
   degrees C), high stocking densities did not reduce the mortality risk
   from cold stress; on the contrary, for stocking densities either near to
   or just above the maximum density in EC Reg. 1/2005, the DOA risk was
   greater than for loads with densities of 10 kg/m(2) less than the EC
   maximum. Male birds and specific genetic lines also showed a higher DOA.
   In hens, transportation lasting longer than 2 h and the brown-feathered
   breed were associated with higher DOA. Dead-on-arrival progressively
   increased with travel duration, remaining constant between 4 and 6 h and
   peaking at 8 h (median: 0.57\%). The maximum DOA increase was detected
   during winter. These results show that several species-specific factors
   may lead to increased risk of mortality.},

Abstract = {A case of Vibrio parahaemolyticus- and V. alginolyticus-associated
   meningo-encephalitis in a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) found
   stranded along the Adriatic coast of Italy in 2016 is herein reported,
   along with a minireview on V. parahaemolyticus and V. alginolyticus
   infections in aquatic mammals.
   Macroscopically, two abscesses were found in the dolphin's forebrain,
   along with an extensive, bilateral, parasitic broncho-pneumonia.
   Histologically, a suppurative-to-pyogranulomatous meningo-encephalitis
   involved the brain but not the cerebellum. Microbiological
   investigations yielded isolation of V. parahaemolyticus and V.
   alginolyticus from the aforementioned abscesses and from the brain
   parenchyma, respectively, with simultaneous recovery of Shewanella algae
   from the heart and of Photobacterium damselae from a blowhole swab.
   Although V. parahaemolyticus and V. alginolyticus, which are widely
   distributed across marine ecosystems worldwide, likely played a role in
   the development of the suppurative meningo-encephalitis in this dolphin,
   we are not aware of previous isolations of any of these two bacteria
   neither from cetacean brain lesions, nor from abscesses in aquatic
   mammals.},

Abstract = {The concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-concentrations dioxins
   (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) (PCDD/Fs), and
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were determined in fruit and vegetables
   collected in farms located in the well-known ``Land of Fires{''} area of
   Southern Italy, in an effort to learn more about the environmental
   pollution of this high-risk area due to illegal waste dumping and
   uncontrolled burning near cultivated fields. Concentrations were in the
   range 0.011-2.26 ng g(-1) for the six ``indicator{''} non-dioxin-like
   PCBs (NDL-PCBs), and 0.0009-0.096 pg WHO toxic equivalent (TEQ) g(-1)
   for the sum of dioxin-like PCBs (DL-PCBs) and PCDD/Fs. Lacking maximum
   limits for these contaminants in fruit and vegetables, the concentration
   values found were compared with the action levels set out in the EU
   Recommendations. These levels were never exceeded in the examined
   samples. In the present study, the highest mean value for PCDD/Fs +
   DL-PCB corresponded to apricots, olives, and nuts, while the lowest
   values were observed in endive and green beans. The results showed also
   that NDL-PCB levels in apricots were much higher than in any other food,
   suggesting that they can accumulate PCBs: this fruit might be proposed
   as a ``sentinel{''} of the presence of these contaminants in the
   environment.},

   circovirus. It has been described by researchers in the USA and China
   and associated with porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome,

   reports the occurrence of the new virus in Italy. PCV3 was detected in
   the tissues of foetuses and stillborn piglets coming from two farms
   located in the Po Valley. The genome sequences of the two Italian
   strains share 99.7\% to 97.8\% of nucleotide identity with those
   available in GenBank. Results strengthen the hypothesis of PCV3 as a new
   emerging porcine circovirus, widespread all over the world. It follows
   the urgency of investigating in depth epidemiology and pathogenicity

Abstract = {In this study changes in hematochemical parameters, milk composition and
   yield were investigated in buffaloes during the transition period. A
   total of 93 buffaloes 113.9 +/- 8.03months old and 535 +/- 50kg average
   body weight were used. Parity was recorded, blood samples were collected
   from 80days pre-partum until 70days post-partum; milk samples were
   collected from 5days to 70days post-partum. On serum samples, the values
   of non-esterified fatty acids, -hydroxybutyrate, glucose, cholesterol,
   triglycerides, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase,
   gamma-glutamyltransferase, urea, total proteins were evaluated. On milk,
   percentage of fat, protein and lactose, along with the somatic cell
   count (SCC), milk yield and daily milk production (DMP) were assessed.
   The peripartum period significantly (P0.01) influenced all studied
   parameters with the exception of glucose. Milk fat percentage showed
   decreasing trend from 10 until 40days post-partum; DMP significantly
   (P0.01) increased from 1 day post-partum until 40days post-partum. Milk
   yield significantly (P0.01) decreased in animals over the sixth
   lactation. Our results confirmed the importance of transit period in
   buffaloes. Blood parameters and milk composition alterations are crucial
   to predict the energy balance status of buffaloes in order to improve
   their management and feed intake during the transition period.},

Abstract = {Infection of kidney cells (MDBK) with Bovine Herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) is
   affected by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- p-dioxin (TCDD), which
   accelerates BoHV-1-induced apoptosis and increases virus replication.
   Herein, to elucidate the mechanism through TCDD modifies BoHV-1
   infection, we analyzed the modulation of a members of Sirtuin proteins
   family in MDBK cells. We found that mitochondrial SIRT3 was upregulated
   during infection. This change was accompanied by cytoskeletal
   rearrangements and cell extensions. All these trends were drastically
   modified by TCDD. We hypothesize that, taken together, these results
   might further clarify the processes responsible for the action of TCDD
   on the BoHV-1 replication, resulting in enhanced virus production.},

Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms represent a severe issue worldwide. They affect
   ecosystem functions and related services and goods, with consequences on
   human health and socio-economic activities. This study reports new data
   on paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) from Sardinia and Sicily (Italy),
   the largest Mediterranean islands where toxic events, mainly caused by
   Alexandrium species (Dinophyceae), have been ascertained in mussel farms
   since the 2000s. The toxicity of the A. minutum, A. tamarense and A.
   pacificum strains, established from the isolation of vegetative cells
   and resting cysts, was determined by high performance liquid
   chromatography (HPLC). The analyses indicated the highest toxicity for
   A. pacificum strains (total PSTs up to 17.811 fmol cell(-1)). The PSTs
   were also assessed in a strain of A. tamarense. The results encourage
   further investigation to increase the knowledge of toxic species still
   debated in the Mediterranean. This study also reports new data on
   microcystins (MCs) and beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) from a
   Sardinian artificial lake (Lake Bidighinzu). The presence of MCs and
   BMAA was assessed in natural samples and in cell cultures by
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). BMAA positives were found in
   all the analysed samples with a maximum of 17.84 mu g L-1. The obtained
   results added further information on cyanotoxins in Mediterranean
   reservoirs, particularly BMAA, which have not yet been thoroughly
   investigated.},

Abstract = {Purpose. Alternatives to antibiotic therapy for mastitis in ruminants
   are needed. We present an evaluation, in two trials, of the efficacy of
   an intramammary infusion of a live culture of Lactococcus lactis for the
   treatment of subclinical and clinical mastitis in ewes.
   Methodology. In total, 67 animals were enrolled: 19 lactating ewes
   (study 1), including healthy (N=6) and coagulase-negative staphylococci
   (CNS)-infected ewes (N=13); and 48 lactating ewes (study 2) with either
   CNS mastitis (N=32), or Staphylococcus aureus mastitis (N=16), for a
   total of 123 mammary glands. Intramammary infusions were performed with
   either L. lactis or PBS for 3 (study 1) or 7 (study 2) consecutive days.
   Antibiotic-treated and untreated control glands were included. Milk
   samples for microbiology, somatic cell analysis and milk production were
   collected before and after treatment.
   Results/Key findings. L. lactis rapidly activated the mammary glands'
   innate immune response and initiated an inflammatory response as
   evidenced by the recruitment of polymorphonuclear neutrophils and
   increased somatic cell counts. But while leading to a transient
   clearance of CNS in the gland, this response caused mild to moderate
   clinical cases of mastitis characterized by abnormal milk secretions and
   udder inflammation. Moreover, S. aureus infections did not improve, and
   CNS infections tended to relapse.
   Conclusion. Under our experimental conditions, the L. lactis treatment
   led to a transient clearance of the pathogen in the gland, but also
   caused mild to moderate clinical cases of mastitis. We believe it is
   still early to implement bacterial formulations as alternatives in
   treating mastitis in ruminants and further experimentation is needed.},

Abstract = {Activity of ethanolic extracts of the algae Ulva rigida, Asparagopsis
   taxiformis, Dictyota dichotoma, and Cystoseira barbata, collected along
   Italian coasts, was tested against larvae of the Asian tiger mosquito
   (Aedes albopictus), a vector of pathogens for animals and humans. Tests
   were carried out using 10 specimens of 3rd-stage larvae per test,
   following the World Health Organization standard protocol with minor
   modifications. Among algal extracts, only D. dichotoma was active
   against the larvae of Ae. albopictus. Ethanolic extracts of that species
   showed LC90 (the concentration that kills 90\% of larvae) and LC50 (the
   concentration that kills 50\% of larvae) values at 44.32 and 85.92
   mg/liter, respectively. Based on the data obtained, D. dichotoma
   biometabolic extracts could be potential candidates as larvicide
   compounds to control Ae. albopictus, encouraging the use of macroalgae

Volume = {17},

Abstract = {There are growing evidences that the semen of infertile male population
   shows higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels concomitant with lower
   antioxidant capacity compared to those detected in semen of fertile
   population. The plasma membrane of the sperm cell, which has high levels
   of polyunsaturated fatty acids, renders it particularly sensitive to
   ROS. The aim of this study was to compare the sperm parameters
   (concentration, motility, morphology and vitality) and the levels of
   malondialdehyde (MDA), as marker of lipid peroxidation (LPO), nitric
   oxide (NO), ascorbic acid (AA), total (GSHt) and oxidized glutathione
   (GSSG) in viable sperm in a group of 38 infertile patients and in a
   group of 55 control subjects with unknown reproductive potential. The
   comparison between variables in infertile patients and controls revealed
   that the sperm quality was reduced in the infertile group, whereas the
   levels of NO, AA and GSH were significantly increased in viable
   spermatozoa from infertile men; however, the endogenous levels of MDA
   were similar in infertile and control groups. Based on our results, we
   could speculate that the rise of GSHt and AA levels in viable sperm of
   infertile group help partially to counteract the damaging effect of ROS
   and partly prevent a substantial LPO. The observation of the concomitant
   increase of NO and antioxidant indices in viable spermatozoa of
   infertile subjects is a novel finding and we think that these results
   can be useful since the viable sperm population is conceivably used in
   assisted reproductive technology.},

Abstract = {We determined the hepatitis E virus (HEV) seroprevalence and detection
   rate in commercial swine herds in Italy's utmost pig-rich area, and
   assessed HEV seropositivity risk in humans as a function of occupational
   exposure to pigs, diet, foreign travel, medical history and hunting
   activities. During 2011-2014, 2700 sera from 300 swine herds were tested
   for anti-HEV IgG. HEV RNA was searched in 959 faecal pools from
   HEV-seropositive herds and in liver/bile/muscle samples from 179 pigs
   from HEV-positive herds. A cohort study of HEV seropositivity in swine
   workers (n = 149) was also performed using two comparison groups of
   people unexposed to swine: omnivores (n = 121) and vegetarians/vegans (n
   = 115). Herd-level seroprevalence was 756\% and was highest in
   farrow-to-feeder herds (816\%). Twenty-six out of 105 (248\%) herds had
   HEV-positive faecal samples (25 HEV-3, one HEV-4). Only one bile sample
   tested positive. HEV seropositivity was 123\% in swine workers, 09\% in
   omnivores and 30\% in vegetarians/vegans. Factors significantly
   associated with HEV seropositivity were occupational exposure to pigs,
   travel to Africa and increased swine workers' age. We concluded that HEV
   is widespread in Italian swine herds and HEV-4 circulation is alarming
   given its pathogenicity, with those occupationally exposed to pigs being
   at increased risk of HEV seropositivity.},

Title = {Genetic basis of Lipomatous Myopathy in Piedmontese beef cattle},
Journal = {LIVESTOCK SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {206},
Pages = {9-16},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In Piedmontese cattle breed, the sporadic detection of Lipomatous
   Myopathy (LM) has been reported. The phenotypic disease expression
   consists in degeneration and infiltration of the muscular tissue
   characterized by replacement of myofibers with adipose tissue. The aim
   of this study was to investigate the existence of genetic loci
   associated with lipomatous myopathy in Piedmontese cattle breed through
   a genome wide association study based on a DNA pooling design. The
   samples used for the study were collected from a meat cutting plant,
   pairing cases and controls within farms. Samples of different muscles
   (diaphragm, superficial and deep pectoral, intercostal,
   sternocleidomastoid group and vastus lateralis) were histopathologically
   and enzymatically classified as cases and controls. DNA pools of cases
   and controls were constructed. Equal amounts of DNA were pooled from
   individuals for the constitution of 4 pools (2 independent biological
   replicates for cases and 2 for controls). Technical duplicates were also
   built and all pools genotyped with the Illumina BovineHD BeadChip three
   time each, for a total of 24 chip array positions. SNPs positions were
   based on the UMB 3.1 bovine assembly. The B-allele frequencies (BAF) for
   each array replicate were used in a specific pipeline in R software to
   perform multiple marker tests after excluding the 5\% of SNPs showing
   the highest BAF variability from the replicate arrays within tail, as
   well as the monomorphic SNPs. A total of 41 QTLRs were identified on the
   29 bovine autosomes, and 4 on the X chromosome. A subset of the
   identified markers fall inside or nearby genes involved in myogenesis,
   adipogenesis and cell to cell adhesions. The biological role of these
   genes in the onset of lipomatous myopathy has been identified looking at
   the known functions of the encoded proteins on the GeneCards database.
   Gene networks have been identified using STRING.},

Abstract = {A molecular screening for tick-borne pathogens was carried out in
   engorged and in questing ticks collected in Verbano Cusio Ossola county,
   Piemonte region, Italy. Engorged ticks were removed from wild and
   domestic animal hosts. The most abundant and common tick species in the
   area was Ixodes ricinus (192 adults, 907 nymphs). Few individuals of
   Ixodes hexagonus (15) and Rhipicephalus sanguineus (7) were found among
   the ticks removed from domestic animals (46 examined ticks). The
   presence of Rickettsia spp., Borrelia burgdorferi sensu latu,
   Francisella tularensis and Coxiella burnetii was evaluated by PCR and
   sequencing in 392 individuals of I. ricinus (adult and nymphal stages)
   and 22 individuals of the two other tick species. Five Borrelia species
   (i.e. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii, B. afzelii, B.
   valaisiana and B. lusitaniae), proved or suspected to cause clinical
   manifestations of Lyme disease in humans, showed 10.5 and 2.2\% combined
   prevalence in questing and engorged I. ricinus, respectively. In
   addition, two species of rickettsiae (R. helvetica and R. monacensis)
   were identified and reported with 14.5 and 24.8\% overall prevalence in
   questing and in engorged ticks. The prevalence of F. tularensis in the
   ticks collected on two wild ungulate species (Capreolus capreolus and
   Cervus elaphus) was 5.7\%. This work provided further data and broadened
   our knowledge on bacterial pathogens present in ticks in Northwest
   Italy.},

Abstract = {Morbilliviruses, such as Cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV) or Phocine
   distemper virus (PDV), represent a growing threat for marine mammals on
   both hemispheres. Because free-ranging animal populations strongly rely
   on natural resistance mechanisms, innate immunity-related genes and
   virus cell entry receptor genes may represent key factors involved in
   susceptibility to CeMV in Cetaceans. Using the next generation
   sequencing technology, we have sequenced 11 candidate genes in two model
   species, Stenella coeruleoalba and Phocoena phocoena. Suitable single
   nucleotide polymorphism markers of potential functional importance,
   located in genes coding for basigin (BSG, CD147), the signaling
   lymphocyte activating molecule (SLAMF1), the poliovirus-related
   receptor-4 (NECTIN4, PVRL4), toll-like receptors 3, 7, 8 (TLR3, TLR7,
   TLR8), natural resistance-associated macrophage protein (SLC11A1) and
   natural cytotoxicity triggering receptor 1 (NCR1), were identified in
   each model species, along with MHC-DQB haplotypes unique for each
   species. This set of molecular markers represents a potentially useful
   tool for studying host genetic variation and susceptibility to
   morbillivirus infection in Cetaceans as well as for studying
   functionally important genetic diversity of selected Cetacean
   populations.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess the trend of hepatitis A virus (HAV)
   in a coastal zone impacted by a contamination event, providing data for
   the development of management strategies. A total of 352 samples,
   including four bivalve mollusc species (Mytilus galloprovincialis, Solen
   vagina, Venus gallina and Donax trunculus), were taken over a period of
   6 months from 27 production areas of the coast and analysis were
   performed according to ISO/TS 15216-1:2013. HAV presence was detected in
   77 samples from 11 production areas and all positive results were
   related to samples collected in the first 3 months of the surveillance,
   during which HAV prevalence was 39.9\% and values as high as 5096 genome
   copies/g were detected. A progressive reduction of viral contamination
   was evident during the first trimester of the monitoring, with
   prevalence decreasing from 78.8\% in the first month, to 37.8\% in the
   second and 3.9\% in the third and quantitative levels reduced from an
   average value of 672 genome copies/g to 255 genome copies/g over a
   period of 4 weeks (virus half-life: 21.5 days). A regression analysis
   showed that, during the decreasing phase of the contamination, the data
   fitted a reciprocal quadratic model (Ra-2 = 0.921) and, based on the
   model, a residual presence of HAV could be estimated after
   negativization of the production areas. The statistical analysis of the
   results per shellfish species and per production area showed that there
   were limited differences in contamination prevalence and levels among
   diverse bivalve species, while a statistically significant difference
   was present in quantitative levels of one production area. These data
   could be useful for the development of both risk assessment models and
   code of practice for the management of viral contamination in primary
   production.},

Abstract = {Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is a lagovirus that can cause
   fatal hepatitis (rabbit haemorrhagic disease, RHD) with mortality of
   80-90\% in farmed and wild rabbits. Since 1986, RHDV has caused
   outbreaks in rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in Europe, but never in
   European brown hares (Lepus europaeus, EBH). In 2010, a new RHDV-related
   virus, called RHDV2, emerged in Europe, causing extended epidemics
   because it largely overcame the immunity to RHDV present in most rabbit
   populations. RHDV2 also was identified in Cape hare (Lepus capensis
   subsp. mediterraneus) and in Italian hare (Lepus corsicanus). Here, we
   describe two distinct incidents of RHDV2 infection in EBH that occurred
   in Italy (2012) and Spain (2014). The two RHDV2 strains caused
   macroscopic and microscopic lesions similar to European brown hare
   syndrome (EBHS) in hares, and they were genetically related to other
   RHDV2 strains in Europe. EBHs are common in Europe, often sharing
   habitat with rabbits. They likely have been exposed to high levels of
   RHDV2 during outbreaks in rabbits in recent years, yet only two
   incidents of RHDV2 in EBHs have been found in Italy and Spain,
   suggesting that EBHs are not a primary host. Instead, they may act as
   spillover hosts insituations when infection pressure is high and
   barriers between rabbits and hares are limited, resulting in occasional
   infections causing EBHS-like lesions. The serological survey of stocked
   hare sera taken from Italian and Spanish hare populations provided an
   understanding of naturally occurring RHDV2 infection in the field
   confirming its sporadic occurrence in EBH. Our findings increase the
   knowledge on distribution, host range and epidemiology of RHDV2.},

Abstract = {During recent decades, ornamental fish have proven to be one of the
   fastest growing categories of pets in Europe. In this framework, we
   evaluated both the potential pathogenic and zoonotic risks caused by 53
   Vibrio cholerae non-O1/non-O139 and a Vibrio mimicus strain isolated
   from ornamental fish species mostly originating from South-East Asia
   countries between 2000 and 2015 in Italy. All the strains were firstly
   identified at species level by biochemical, phylogenetic and mass
   spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of
   flight) methods, and then studied to reveal the presence of the main
   virulence and colonization-associated factors, as ctxA, ace, zot,
   stn/sto, toxR, rtxA, hlyA and tcpA by multiplex and single endpoint PCR
   assays. Findings showed that 21 of 54 strains harboured at least one
   virulence factor with a predominance for the toxR(+), rtxA(+) and
   hlyAET(+) genotype. Interestingly, the V.mimicus strain harboured the
   colonization factor and the CTX prophage receptor, tcpA, indicating the
   ability to capture and integrate it in its genome increasing its
   pathogenicity. Although these enterotoxins can sporadically cause
   gastroenteritis, the results highlight their probable involvement in
   causing severe implications for public health, suggesting the need for
   an European microbiological monitoring.},

Title = {Frequency of DEA 1 antigen in 1037 mongrel and PUREBREED dogs in ITALY},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Month = {NOV 29},
Abstract = {Background: The prevalence of dog erythrocyte antigen (DEA 1) in canine
   population is approximately 40-60\%. Often data are limited to a small
   number of breeds and/or dogs. The aims of this study were to evaluate
   frequency of DEA 1 in a large population of purebred and mongrel dogs
   including Italian native breeds and to recognize a possible association
   between DEA 1 and breed, sex, and genetic and phenotypical/functional
   classifications of breeds. Frequencies of DEA 1 blood group collected
   from screened/enrolled blood donors and from healthy and sick dogs were
   retrospectively evaluated. The breed and the sex were recorded when
   available. DEA 1 blood typing was assessed by immunocromatographic test
   on K3EDTA blood samples. The prevalence of DEA 1 antigen was
   statistically related to breed, gender, Federation Cynologique
   Internationale (FCI) and genotypic grouping.
   Results: Sixty-two per cent dogs resulted DEA 1+ and 38\% DEA 1-. DEA 1-
   was statistically associated with Dogo Argentino, Dobermann, German
   Shepherd, Boxer, Corso dogs, the molossian dogs, the FCI group 1, 2 and
   3 and the genetic groups ``working dogs{''} and ``mastiff{''}. DEA 1+
   was statistically associated with Rottweiler, Briquet Griffon Vendeen,
   Bernese mountain dog, Golden Retriever, the hunting breeds, the FCI
   group 4, 6, 7 and 8 and the genetic groups ``scent hounds{''} and
   ``retrievers{''}. No gender association was observed.
   Conclusions: Data obtained by this work may be clinically useful to
   drive blood donor enrollment and selection among different breeds.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we describe the preparation of polymeric nanoparticles
   (NPs) loaded with sorafenib for the treatment of hepatocellular
   carcinoma (HCC). A synthetic brush copolymer, named PHEA-BIB-ButMA
   (PBB), was synthesized by Atom Trasnfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP)
   starting from the alpha-poly(N-2-hydroxyethyl)-D,L-aspartamide (PHEA)
   and poly butyl methacrylate (ButMA). Empty and sorafenib loaded PBB NPs
   were, then, produced by using a dialysis method and showed spherical
   morphology, colloidal size, negative zeta potential and the ability to
   allow a sustained sorafenib release in physiological environment.
   Sorafenib loaded PBB NPs were tested in vitro on HCC cells in order to
   evaluate their cytocompatibility and anticancer efficacy if compared to
   free drug. Furthermore, the enhanced anticancer effect of sorafenib
   loaded PBB NPs was demonstrated in vivo by using a xenograft model, by
   first allowing Hep3B cells to grow subcutaneously into nude mice and
   then administering sorafenib as free drug or incorporated into NPs via
   intraperitoneal injection. Finally, in vivo biodistribution studies were
   performed, showing the ability of the produced drug delivery system to
   accumulate in a significant manner in the solid tumor by passive
   targeting, thanks to the enhanced permeability and retention effect.},

Abstract = {Since 2013 in Emilia-Romagna, Italy, surveillance information generated
   in the public health and in the animal health sectors has been shared
   and used to guide public health interventions to mitigate the risk of
   West Nile virus (WNV) transmission via blood transfusion. The objective
   of the current study was to identify and estimate the costs and benefits
   associated with this One Health surveillance approach, and to compare it
   to an approach that does not integrate animal health information in
   blood donations safety policy (uni-sectoral scenario). Costs of human,
   animal, and entomological surveillance, sharing of information, and
   triggered interventions were estimated. Benefits were quantified as the
   averted costs of potential human cases of WNV neuroinvasive disease
   associated to infected blood transfusion. In the 2009-2015 period, the
   One Health approach was estimated to represent a cost saving of
   (sic)160,921 compared to the uni-sectoral scenario. Blood donation
   screening was the main cost for both scenarios. The One Health approach
   further allowed savings of (sic)1.21 million in terms of avoided tests
   on blood units. Benefits of the One Health approach due to short-term
   costs of hospitalization and compensation for transfusion-associated
   disease potentially avoided, were estimated to range from (sic)0 to
   (sic)2.98 million according to the probability of developing WNV
   neuroinvasive disease after receiving an infected blood transfusion.},

Title = {From Invention to Innovation: Risk Analysis to Integrate One Health
   Technology in the Dairy Farm},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Month = {NOV 23},
Abstract = {Current Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) approaches
   mainly fit for food industry, while their application in primary food
   production is still rudimentary. The European food safety framework
   calls for science-based support to the primary producers' mandate for
   legal, scientific, and ethical responsibility in food supply. The
   multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary project ALERT pivots on the
   development of the technological invention (BEST platform) and
   application of its measurable (bio) markers-as well as scientific
   advances in risk analysis-at strategic points of the milk chain for time
   and cost-effective early identification of unwanted and/or unexpected
   events of both microbiological and toxicological nature. Health-oriented
   innovation is complex and subject to multiple variables. Through field
   activities in a dairy farm in central Italy, we explored individual
   components of the dairy farm system to overcome concrete challenges for
   the application of translational science in real life and (veterinary)
   public health. Based on an HACCP-like approach in animal production, the
   farm characterization focused on points of particular attention (POPAs)
   and critical control points to draw a farm management decision tree
   under the One Health view (environment, animal health, food safety). The
   analysis was based on the integrated use of checklists (environment;
   agricultural and zootechnical practices; animal health and welfare) and
   laboratory analyses of well water, feed and silage, individual fecal
   samples, and bulk milk. The understanding of complex systems is a
   condition to accomplish true innovation through new technologies. BEST
   is a detection and monitoring system in support of production security,
   quality and safety: a grid of its (bio) markers can find direct
   application in critical points for early identification of potential
   hazards or anomalies. The HACCP-like self-monitoring in primary
   production is feasible, as well as the biomonitoring of live food
   producing animals as sentinel population for One Health.},

Title = {Characterization of the upper and lower respiratory tract microbiota in
   Piedmontese calves},
Journal = {MICROBIOME},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Month = {NOV 21},
Abstract = {Background: The microbiota of the bovine upper respiratory tract has
   been recently characterized, but no data for the lower respiratory tract
   are available. A major health problem in bovine medicine is infectious
   bronchopneumonia, the most common respiratory syndrome affecting cattle.
   With this study, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize and
   compare the microbial community composition of the upper and lower
   respiratory tracts in calves.
   Results: The microbiota of the upper (nasal swab {[}NS]) and the lower
   (trans-tracheal aspiration {[}TTA]) respiratory tracts of 19 post-weaned
   Piedmontese calves with (8/19) and without (11/19) clinical signs of
   respiratory disease, coming from six different farms, was characterized
   by 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding. A total of 29 phyla (29 in NS, 21 in
   TTA) and 305 genera (289 in NS, 182 in TTA) were identified. Mycoplasma
   (60.8\%) was the most abundant genus identified in both the NS (27.3\%)
   and TTA (76.7\%) samples, followed by Moraxella (16.6\%) in the NS and
   Pasteurella (7.3\%) in the TTA samples. Pasteurella multocida (7.3\% of
   total operational taxonomic units {[}OTUs]) was the most abundant
   species in the TTA and Psychrobacter sanguinis (1.1\% of total OTUs) in
   the NS samples. Statistically significant differences between the NS and
   the TTA samples were found for both alpha (Shannon index, observed
   species, Chao1 index, and Simpson index; P = 0.001) and beta (Adonis; P
   = 0.001) diversity. Comparison of the NS and TTA samples by farm origin
   and clinical signs revealed no statistical difference (P > 0.05), except
   for farm origin for the NS samples when compared by the unweighted
   UniFrac metric (P = 0.05).
   Conclusions: Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we characterized the
   microbiota of the upper and lower respiratory tracts of calves, both
   healthy individuals and those with clinical signs of respiratory
   disease. Our results suggest that environmental factors may influence
   the composition of the upper airway microbiota in cattle. While the two
   microbial communities (upper and lower airways) differed in microbial
   composition, they shared several OTUs, suggesting that the lung
   microbiota may be a self-sustaining, more homogeneous ecosystem,
   influenced by the upper respiratory tract microbiota.},

Abstract = {In Europe, Trichinella spiralis, the most dangerous species for humans
   of the genus Trichinella, has a patchy distribution with important foci
   in Eastern countries and Spain. This zoonotic pathogen was apparently
   not circulating among wild and domestic animals of Italy. In 2016,
   muscle larvae belonging to this nematode species were detected in a red
   fox (Vulpes vulpes) shot in the Piacenza province (Northern Italy). This
   parasite may have been introduced into northern Italy from eastern
   Europe by hunters, by a hunting dog, or by immigrants, who illegally
   carried infected meat in their personal baggage. In the same year, T.
   spiralis infected sausages illegally introduced by personal baggage into
   Italy from Romania, were inadequately disposed of in the garbage of a
   central Italian town. Even though these two episodes may not be
   connected in time and space, they represent an increased risk of
   infection for domestic and wild swine, which are highly susceptible to
   this pathogen. In these animals, T. spiralis shows a higher larval
   burden and a longer survival time than other Trichinella species. Since
   most of the Italian pig production plants are in northern Italy, the
   circulation of T. spiralis should be strictly monitored in wildlife
   living in these areas.},

Title = {First record of Gongylonema nepalensis in domestic and wild ruminants in

Journal = {VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {246},

Abstract = {The gullet worm, Gongylonema pulchrwn, is cosmopolitan in distribution,
   infecting a variety of mammals including domestic and wild ruminants.
   Gongylonema nepalensis recently collected from the esophageal epithelium
   of water buffaloes in Nepal was separated from G. pulchrum based on its
   distinctly shorter left spicule relative to body length and unique
   nucleotide sequences of the ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) and the
   mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (cox-1). During meat
   inspections at four abattoirs on Sardinia Island, Italy, 25 Gongylonema
   worms were collected from one each individual of cattle (n = 8), sheep
   (n = 7), goats (n = 4), and mouflon (Ovis aries musimon; n = 6), and
   characterized morphologically and genetically. Intriguingly, all of the
   collected worms from these ruminants were G. nepalensis, exhibiting
   comparable body lengths to G. pulchrum in cattle from other regions but
   with significantly shorter left spicules like G. nepalensis (less than
   20.9\% of the entire body length in contrast to 21.8-65.6\%, the
   reported proportion of G. pulchrum). Furthermore, the rDNA nucleotide
   sequences of these worms from different ruminant species on Sardinia
   Island were almost identical to each other and to Nepalese G. nepalensis
   isolates. With the exception of one worm from a sheep (displaying a
   single nucleotide substitution), the 369-bp cox-1 nucleotide sequences
   of all the Sardinian G. nepalensis isolates from the different host
   sources were absolutely identical, forming a Glade with Nepalese G.
   nepalensis isolates and not G. pulchrum isolates. The present study
   reveals that G. nepalensis is not a local parasite in the Indian
   subcontinent (Nepal), but instead has a certain geographical
   distribution in Europe and takes several ruminant species as a
   definitive host.},

Title = {Microbial agents in macroscopically healthy mammary gland tissues of
   small ruminants},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Month = {NOV 13},
Abstract = {Background. Health of mammary glands is fundamental for milk and dairy
   products hygiene and quality, with huge impacts on consumers welfare.
   Methods. This study aims to investigate the microbial agents (bacteria,
   fungi and lentiviruses) isolated from 89 macroscopically healthy udders
   of regularly slaughtered small ruminants (41 sheep, 48 goats), also
   correlating their presence with the histological findings. Multinomial
   logistic regression was applied to evaluate the association between
   lesions and positivity for different microbial isolates, animal age and
   bacteria.
   Results. Twenty-five samples were microbiologically negative; 138
   different bacteria were isolated in 64 positive udders.
   Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most prevalent bacteria
   isolated (46.42\%), followed by environmental opportunists (34.76\%),
   others (10.14\%) and pathogens (8.68\%). Most mammary glands showed
   coinfections (75\%). Lentiviruses were detected in 39.3\% of samples.
   Histologically, chronic non-suppurative mastitis was observed in 45/89
   glands, followed by chronic mixed mastitis (12/89) and acute suppurative
   mastitis (4/89). Only 28 udders were normal. Histological lesions were
   significantly associated with the animal species and lentiviruses and
   coagulase-negative staphylococci infections. Goats had significantly
   higher risk to show chronic mixed mastitis compared to sheep. Goats
   showed a significantly lower risk (OR D 0.26; 95\% CI {[}0.06-0.71]) of
   being infected by environmental opportunists compared to sheep, but
   higher risk (OR D 10.87; 95\% CI {[}3.69-37.77]) of being infected with
   lentiviruses.
   Discussion. The results of the present study suggest that
   macroscopically healthy glands of small ruminants could act as a
   reservoir of microbial agents for susceptible animals, representing a
   potential risk factor for the widespread of acute or chronic infection
   in the flock.},

Title = {A real time metabolomic profiling approach to detecting fish fraud using
   rapid evaporative ionisation mass spectrometry},
Journal = {METABOLOMICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Number = {12},
Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {Fish fraud detection is mainly carried out using a genomic profiling
   approach requiring long and complex sample preparations and assay
   running times. Rapid evaporative ionisation mass spectrometry (REIMS)
   can circumvent these issues without sacrificing a loss in the quality of
   results.
   To demonstrate that REIMS can be used as a fast profiling technique
   capable of achieving accurate species identification without the need
   for any sample preparation. Additionally, we wanted to demonstrate that
   other aspects of fish fraud other than speciation are detectable using
   REIMS.
   478 samples of five different white fish species were subjected to REIMS
   analysis using an electrosurgical knife. Each sample was cut 8-12 times
   with each one lasting 3-5 s and chemometric models were generated based
   on the mass range m/z 600-950 of each sample.
   The identification of 99 validation samples provided a 98.99\% correct
   classification in which species identification was obtained
   near-instantaneously (ae 2 s) unlike any other form of food fraud
   analysis. Significant time comparisons between REIMS and polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR) were observed when analysing 6 mislabelled samples
   demonstrating how REIMS can be used as a complimentary technique to
   detect fish fraud. Additionally, we have demonstrated that the catch
   method of fish products is capable of detection using REIMS, a concept
   never previously reported.
   REIMS has been proven to be an innovative technique to help aid the
   detection of fish fraud and has the potential to be utilised by
   fisheries to conduct their own quality control (QC) checks for fast
   accurate results.},

Title = {First record of the invasive mosquito species Aedes (Stegomyia)
   albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) on the southernmost Mediterranean
   islands of Italy and Europe},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {Background: Aedes albopictus, a known worldwide vector of several
   mosquito-borne disease pathogens including dengue, chikungunya and Zika
   viruses, was introduced into Europe in the late 1970s through global
   trade. First recorded in northern Italy in 1990, this mosquito species
   has rapidly spread throughout the country, where it was responsible for
   an outbreak of chikungunya in 2007 that affected more than 200 people.
   As part of the VectorNet project, which is aimed at improving
   preparedness and responsiveness for animal and human vector-borne
   diseases in Europe, a mosquito targeted study was carried out on the
   three southernmost Italian islands. The objective was to verify the
   current European southern distribution limits of Ae. albopictus and the
   potential occurrence of other invasive mosquito species, in the light of
   the introduction of high risk for vector-borne disease pathogens into
   Europe via migration flows.
   Results: In the summer 2015, six surveys for container-breeding
   mosquitoes were carried out by setting up a network of oviposition traps
   and BG Sentinel traps in selected areas on the islands of Pantelleria,
   Lampedusa and Linosa. Aedes albopictus was found on all three islands
   under investigation. The consequences on public health with regard to
   the presence of this mosquito vector and the migrant people entering the
   country from Africa and the Middle East are also discussed here.
   Conclusions: The detection of the Asian tiger mosquito on these islands,
   which represent the last European strip of land facing Africa, has
   important implications for public health policy and should prompt the
   national authorities to implement tailored surveillance activities and
   reinforce plans for preparedness strategies in such contexts.},

Abstract = {West Nile virus-associated disease is one of the most widespread
   vector-borne diseases in the world. In Morocco, the first cases were
   reported in horses in 1996 and the disease re-emerged in 2003 and in
   2010. The objective of this work was to study the epidemiological
   situation of WNV-associated infection in Morocco, by quantifying the
   seroprevalence of anti-WNV IgM and IgG antibodies in horses in different
   bioclimatic regions-zones of Morocco in 2011. During the months of May,
   June and July 2011, 840 serum samples were collected from horses in four
   regions characterized by different environmental and climatic features
   such as altitude, temperature and precipitation. These
   environmental-climatic regions are: the Atlantic plateaus of the Gharb
   and pre-Rif region, the North Atlasic plains and plateaus region, the
   Atlas Mountains and pre-Atlas region and the plains and plateaus of the
   Oriental region. All samples were tested for the anti-WNV IgG antibodies
   by ELISA and positive sera were confirmed by virus neutralization (VN).
   An anti-WNV antibody prevalence map was developed. A total of 261
   samples (31\%) were found positive by both techniques. The prevalence of
   the infection was higher in the Atlantic plateaus of the Gharb and
   pre-Rif region, in the northern part of the country. Available data
   concerning the previous WNV-associated disease outbreaks in Morocco and
   the preliminary results of this serological survey suggest that the
   Moroccan northwest is the region at highest risk for WNV circulation. In
   this region, the climate is more humid with higher rainfall than other
   regions and milder winter temperatures exist. In the same area, the
   presence of migratory bird settlements may affect the risk of virus
   introduction and amplification.},

Title = {European wildcat and domestic cat: Do they really differ?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VETERINARY BEHAVIOR-CLINICAL APPLICATIONS AND RESEARCH},

Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {The wildcat (Felis silvestris) is considered a ``strictly protected{''}
   species, and it is included in CITES Appendix II. Nevertheless, it is
   classed as threatened in many European countries. Improving our
   knowledge on the behavior of the European wildcat might be valuable for
   the conservation of this species in the wild as well as for its
   husbandry in captive environment. The aim of this study was to enhance
   biological and behavioral knowledge of the European wildcat by comparing
   its behavior with that of the domestic cat. Individual and social
   behaviors of a group of Europeanwildcats in captivity were observed and
   compared with behaviors of a domestic cats' group to underline
   similarities and differences. Six European wildcats housed at Parco
   Natura Viva and 5 domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus) were the
   subjects of this study. Two 10-minute daily sessions per subject were
   run. For each subject, a total of 120 minutes of observational data were
   collected. Individual and social behaviors of the 2 groups were
   recorded. A continuous focal animal sampling method was used to assess
   the amount of time spent in all behaviors. Results of this study
   underline that both captive wildcats and domestic cats showed
   species-specific behaviors. However, captive wildcats performed more
   ``not observed,{''} ``vigilance,{''} and ``scent marking{''} than
   domestic cats, whereas domestic cats performed more ``individual
   sleeping{''} than captive wildcats. In conclusion, findings of this
   study seem to suggest that behavioral differences between European
   wildcat and domestic cat are less common than are their similarities.
   However, further research on the behavior of wildcats is needed to
   improve the ex situ and in situ conservation of this species. (C) 2017

Title = {Effects of different ozonized slurry-ice treatments and superchilling
   storage (-1 degrees C) on microbial spoilage of two important pelagic
   fish species},

Abstract = {Combining different preservative treatments for improving quality and
   safety of fishery products increasingly receives global research
   attention. Consistent with this pursuit, the current research was
   undertaken to determine the effects of different ozonized slurry-ice
   treatments and superchilling (-1 degrees C) storage on microbial
   spoilage of European anchovy (Eugraulis encrasicolus) and sardine
   (Sardina pilchardus), which are two commercially important pelagic fish
   species. After the catch (within <5hr) and at defined scheduled storage
   times, ozone has been discharged once on sardine (herein referred to as
   One-T) and repeatedly/sequentially on European anchovy (herein referred
   to as Seq-T). Microbiological analyses enumerated total viable count
   (TVC), Bacillus spp., Enterobacteriaceae, Lactobacillus spp., Moraxella
   spp., Shewanella spp., Listeria monocytogenes and Pseudomonas spp.
   Independent of potential antimicrobial effects of ozone during
   superchilling storage, no Listeria spp., Shewanella spp., Moraxella
   spp., and Bacillus spp. were found in all processed samples. While
   Enterobacteriaceae and Lactobacillus spp. were detected at below 1 log
   cfu/g, both TVC and Pseudomonas spp. proliferated at different rates
   throughout superchilling storage. The repeated ozone-treated (Seq-T)
   showed lower TVC and Pseudomonas spp. values compared with one-time
   treated (One-T) slurry-iced and control samples. Thus, combined
   slurry-ice and superchilling storage at Seq-T produced improved
   antimicrobial activity over One-T application. Largely, ozonized
   slurry-ice outcomes/results appear promising thanks to superchilling
   storage.},

Abstract = {The Pacific oyster is one of the world's most widespread bivalves and a
   suitable species for biomonitoring trace elements in marine environments
   thanks to its bioaccumulation ability. As it is also an edible mollusc,
   concentrations of harmful elements in its tissues must be monitored. For
   these purposes, 464 wild individuals were collected from 12 sites along
   the Italian coasts. The concentration of fourteen trace elements (Al,
   As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, Sn, Tl, and Zn) in their tissues
   was quantified. Among the three heavy metals, cadmium, lead, and
   mercury, none exceeded the maximum limit for in food set by European
   Union regulations but Cd in one sample from the Varano Lagoon resulted
   extremely close to this value. Contamination by Hg of the northern
   Adriatic and Orbetello Lagoons was also observed. Moreover, there was a
   positive association between the lagoon's environmental conditions and
   the bioaccumulation of this element in oysters. Despite the ban
   instituted 15 years ago on the use of Sn in antifouling paints, this
   element is still present in several marine environments, as demonstrated
   in the oysters sampled from harbour areas. Samples collected from
   harbours also showed very high concentrations of Cu and Zn due to the
   ability of oysters to accumulate these elements, which have replaced Sn
   in antifouling paints. Analysis of the samples from most sites indicated
   a low risk of human exposure to harmful elements through oyster
   consumption; nonetheless, chemical sanitary controls should focus
   primarily on Cd, Cu, and Zn. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A total of 71 loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) stranded along the
   coasts of Sicily (Southern Italy) were examined for non-dioxine like
   polychlorinated biphenyl (NDL-PCB) levels in muscle and adipose tissue
   by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS)
   method. The results revealed 6 high-indicator congener (Sigma 6PCBIND)
   levels in 45\% of the loggerhead turtles examined, with mean values of
   980.39 +/- 2508.39ng/g wet weight in adipose tissue and 102.53 +/-
   238.58ng/g wet weight in muscle tissue. The hexachloro and heptachloro
   PCB congeners were the most abundant in both the sample types. The
   highest NDL-PCB levels were reached in an adipose tissue sample of a
   loggerhead turtle of 80kg stranded along the coasts of Termini Imerese
   (14183.85ng/g wet wt). No significant correlation was found between
   modified Fulton's K values of the loggerhead turtles and PCB contents
   (S=47 151, p>0.05). Furthermore, no significant differences were found
   between sexes (W=365, p> 0.05). The PCB levels found in the present
   study were much higher than those found in the literature. The present
   study is the first report on the existence of NDL-PCBs in loggerhead
   turtles stranded in Sicilian coasts confirming C. caretta as a valuable
   indicator of contaminant exposure in the marine environment because of

   and USUV in natural environment in central Italy, we carried out
   serological surveillance in wild rodents. During this study, 90 animals
   were captured in forested areas of Abruzzo and Marche regions and tested
   with serological assays for the specific pathogens. Serological test
   provided no evidence of PUUV and DOBV circulation in the studied area.
   However, four rodents (Apodemus flavicollis) were found to be positive

Abstract = {Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a life-threatening fungal disease that
   can occur in dogs. The aim of this study was to provide a preliminary
   genetic characterisation of Pneumocystis carinii f. sp. `canis' (P.
   canis) in dogs and thereby develop a reliable molecular protocol to
   definitively diagnose canine PCP. We investigated P. canis in a variety
   of lung specimens from dogs with confirmed or strongly suspected PCP
   (Group 1, n = 16), dogs with non-PCP lower respiratory tract problems
   (Group 2, n = 65) and dogs not suspected of having PCP or other lower
   respiratory diseases (Group 3, n = 11). Presence of Pneumocystis DNA was
   determined by nested PCR of the large and small mitochondrial subunit
   rRNA loci and by a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction
   (qPCR) assay developed using a new set of primers. Molecular results
   were correlated with the presence of Pneumocystis morphotypes detected
   in cytological/histological prepa rations. Pneumocystis DNA was
   amplified from 13/16 PCP-suspected dogs (Group 1) and from 4/76 dogs of
   control Groups 2 and 3 (combined). The latter four dogs were thought to
   have been colonized by P. canis. Comparison of C-T values in `infected'
   versus `colonized' dogs was consistent with this notion, with a distinct
   difference in molecular burden between groups (C-T <= 26 versus C-T
   range (26 < C-T < 35), respectively). Phylogenetic analyses showed that
   P. canis is specifically `canine' associated, being separated from other
   mammalian Pneumocystis species, thereby confirming the accuracy of qPCR
   amplicon for Pneumocystis in dogs. Using qPCR, Pneumocystis DNA can be
   detected in specimens from the respiratory tract and a C-T value can be
   interpreted to distinguish infection versus colonization.},

Title = {A survey on the Aflatoxin M1 occurrence and seasonal variation in
   buffalo and cow milk from Southern Italy},
Journal = {FOOD CONTROL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {81},
Pages = {30-33},

Abstract = {This study evaluates the aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) contamination in 804
   samples of raw milk from cow and buffalo, collected randomly in Campania
   and Calabria regions of Southern Italy over a two years period.
   The competitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method was
   used to analyze AFM1 in the samples. AFM1 levels result above the CO
   value of 0.004 mu g/kg in 51 (123\%) cow milk samples and in 28 (7.2\%)
   buffalo milk samples. Positive results from screening analysis were
   confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorimetric
   detection (HPLC-FLD) after a procedure of centrifugation, extraction and
   immunoaffinity column clean-up of milk. Only one cow milk sample
   exceeded the maximum limit (0.05 mu g/kg) set by the European
   Regulation.
   The occurrence of AFM1 contamination was significantly (p < 0.05) higher
   in cold season, particularly fall, than in warm season, principally
   spring.
   Our results indicate that feedstuff used in the buffalo and cow farms
   were not highly contaminated with aflatoxins, determining a good quality
   of the analyzed milk. Therefore, the AFM1 contamination of the milk does
   not represent a serious public health problem in both regions in
   Southern Italy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   original type. In this study, we analyzed 81 animals collected in
   Sardinia, Italy. The VP2 sequence analysis of 27 positive samples showed
   that all antigenic CPV-2 types are circulating. CPV-2b seems to be the
   most widespread variant, followed by CPV-2a. Furthermore, 12 CPV-2b
   strains displayed further amino acid substitutions and formed a separate
   cluster in a phylogenetic tree, indicating regional genetic variation.},

Title = {Brucella suis biovar 2 multi locus sequence type ST16 in wild boars (Sus

   Europe?},

Year = {2017},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Porcine brucellosis occurs in many countries where pigs are farmed,
   often representing an underrated problem. B. suis biovar 2 is the most
   common isolate in Europe, with high prevalence reported in wild boars in
   which it is generally isolated in the absence of gross lesions. In the
   last five years, we tested for Brucella spp. 389 lymph nodes of wild
   boars collected during hunting seasons or during necropsy procedures.
   In this paper, we describe the first case of isolation of B. suis biovar
   2 from a wild boar aborted foetus, and we analyse the genomic
   relationships with B. suis biovar 2 strains isolated in the past five
   years in Abruzzi Region, Central Italy. The genetic fingerprint revealed
   that the isolates under study belong to the MLST ST16 and to the MLVA11
   Gt 57, similar to the Central-Eastern European strains. Massive
   restocking (for hunting purpose) of wild boars from Eastern Europe have
   been done since 1950 in Italy contributing to the increasing of
   population size and distribution, as well as to the interbreeding
   between these foreign breeds and the local population. The contamination
   of pastures with infected material such as aborted wild boars foetuses
   can increase the risk of transmission of Brucella among wild and
   domestic animals. The contact of B. suis with domestic ruminants may
   also cause serological reactions to brucellosis serological testing, and
   even unapparent infection, thus hampering the efforts made in the
   brucellosis eradication campaign.},

Abstract = {In this preliminary study, a digestive method used in forensic context
   to extract diatoms has been applied in organs taken from ten wildlife
   animals belonging three species of mammals (a deer, a roe and five
   otters) and one species of birds (two magpies). Only four carcasses were
   recovered from aquatic environments (bath trough for animals, bathtub
   irrigation, river) and only in three cases out of ten that the cause of
   death was ruled out as drowning. In seven cases, the death was due to
   other causes: gunshot injuries for one otter, blunt trauma for a magpie,
   and traumatic injuries followed by motor vehicle collision in other four
   otters and a roe. Post-mortem examination was performed in all
   carcasses. The diatom test protocol was performed according to the
   Italian guidelines for analysis of benthic diatoms for ecological status
   assessment of inland waters. Five grams of lung, liver, and kidney was
   taken from all the animal carcasses. In some cases, additional tissue
   samples were also available among which brain, heart, spleen, and bone
   marrow. In all four cases found in water, the drowning medium was also
   available. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) digestion was performed, and
   identification of 21 genera of diatoms was obtained. The method proved
   to be suitable for the identification of diatoms in the organs of the
   animals drowned supporting the final diagnosis of drowning. Only in
   otters, all died for causes other than drowning, diatoms did not prove
   to be suitable for the diagnosis of drowning since their presence in the
   internal organs was mainly related to their main diet based on fishmeal.
   The authors believe that this first trial is very promising, and the
   results suggest that diatom test can be easily applied in forensic
   veterinary context.},

Abstract = {The first reports of diatoms growing on marine mammals date back to the
   early 1900s. However, only recently has direct evidence been provided
   for similar associations between diatoms and sea turtles. We present a
   comparison of diatom communities inhabiting carapaces of green turtles
   Chelonia mydas sampled at two remote sites located within the Indian
   (Iran) and Atlantic (Costa Rica) Ocean basins. Diatom observations and
   counts were carried out using scanning electron microscopy. Techniques
   involving critical point drying enabled observations of diatoms and
   other microepibionts still attached to sea turtle carapace and revealed
   specific aspects of the epizoic community structure. Species-poor,
   well-developed diatom communities were found on all examined sea
   turtles. Significant differences between the two host sea turtle
   populations were observed in terms of diatom abundance and their
   community structure (including growth form structure). A total of 12 and
   22 diatom taxa were found from sea turtles in Iran and Costa Rica,
   respectively, and eight of these species belonging to Amphora,
   Chelonicola, Cocconeis, Navicula, Nitzschia and Poulinea genera were
   observed in samples from both locations. Potential mechanisms of diatom
   dispersal and the influence of the external environment, sea turtle
   behaviour, its life stage, and foraging and breeding habitats, as well
   as epibiotic bacterial flora on epizoic communities, are discussed.},

Abstract = {Awareness about pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) and tropane alkaloids
   (TAs) in food was recently raised by the European Food Safety Authority
   stressing the lack of data and gaps of knowledge required to improve the
   risk assessment strategy. The present study aimed at the elaboration and
   validation of a method to determine PAs and TAs in honey. QuEChERS
   sample treatment and liquid chromatography coupled to hybrid high
   resolution mass spectrometry, were used. The method resulted in good
   linearity (R-2 > .0.99) and low limits of detection and quantification,
   ranging from 0.04 to 0.2 mu g kg(-1) and from 0.1 to 0.7 mu g kg(-1)
   respectively. Recoveries ranged from 92.3 to 114.8\% with repeatability
   lying between 0.9 and 15.1\% and reproducibility between 1.1 and 15.6\%.
   These performances demonstrate the selectivity and sensitivity of the
   method for simultaneous trace detection and quantification of PAs and
   TAs in honey, verified through the analysis of forty commercial samples.

Title = {Ethnic food consumption: Habits and risk perception in Italy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FOOD SAFETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {37},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This study aims to provide an overview of the consumption of ethnic food
   in Italy and to analyze the perception of risk associated with this kind
   of food. A sample of 1,317 Italian consumers was surveyed. The
   consumption of ethnic food products is growing. Such food items are
   consumed at restaurants and as take-out food and are purchased and
   cooked at home. Ethnic food consumers are mainly women, younger than
   non-consumers, have higher educational qualifications, are employed and
   have children. The ethnic food consumers live mainly in the south part
   of Italy or in the Islands, are inhabitants of larger cities and meet
   their financial responsibilities more easily than non-consumers. The
   motivations connected with ethnic food consumption were analyzed. The
   perception of risk associated with ethnic food appears to be higher than
   that related to Italian food. The perceptions regarding the riskiest
   foods and the associated rationale were explored.
   Practical applicationsEthnic food consumption is a growing phenomenon
   that deserves attention not only to analyze changes in Italian food
   consumption habits but also because these foods bring about specific
   food safety issues. Associated risk factors are related to preparation
   practices in retail and food service establishments as well as the use
   of particular ingredients that pose specific biological chemical and
   nutritional issues that need to be considered. The definition of the
   characteristics of ethnic food consumers and the study of their
   practices and perceptions of risk can help in the understanding of
   aspects that may limit or encourage the acceptance of these products
   thus fostering the comprehension of the potential impact of these foods
   on consumer health. Moreover, these data can be useful for institutions
   that address the protection of public health to analyze the food safety
   issues related to the introduction of ethnic products into Italian
   consumption habits.},

Title = {Loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta): A target species for
   monitoring litter ingested by marine organisms in the Mediterranean Sea},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {230},
Pages = {199-209},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Marine litter is any persistent, manufactured or processed solid
   material discarded, disposed of or abandoned in the marine and coastal
   environment. Ingestion of marine litter can have lethal and sublethal
   effects on wildlife that accidentally ingests it, and sea turtles are
   particularly susceptible to this threat. The European Commission drafted
   the 2008/56/EC Marine Strategy Framework Directive with the aim to
   achieve a Good Environmental Status (GES), and the loggerhead sea turtle
   (Caretta caretta, Linnaeus 1758) was selected for monitoring the amount
   and composition of litter ingested by marine animals. An analogous
   decision has been made under the UNEP/MAP Barcelona Convention for the
   protection of the Mediterranean Sea, following the Ecosystem Approach.
   This work provides for the first time, two possible scenarios for the
   Marine Strategy Framework Directive GES, both related to ``Trends in the
   amount and composition of litter ingested by marine animals{''} in the
   Mediterranean Sea. The study validates the use of the loggerhead turtle
   as target indicator for monitoring the impact of litter on marine biota
   and calls for immediate use of this protocol throughout the
   Mediterranean basin and European Region. Both GES scenarios are relevant
   worldwide, where sea turtles and marine litter are present, for
   measuring the impact of ingested plastics and developing policy
   strategies to reduce it. In the period between 2011 and 2014, 150
   loggerhead sea turtles, found dead, were collected from the Italian
   Coast, West Mediterranean Sea Sub-Region. The presence of marine litter
   was investigated using a standardized protocol for necropsies and lab
   analysis. The collected items were subdivided into 4 main categories,
   namely, IND-Industrial plastic, USE-User plastic, RUB-Non plastic
   rubbish, POL-Pollutants and 14 sub-categories, to detect local
   diversity. Eighty-five percent of the individuals considered (n = 120)
   were found to have ingested an average of 1.3 +/- 0.2 g of litter (dry
   mass) or 16 +/- 3 items. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Adaptive response to exercise of fast-growing and slow-growing chicken
   strains: Blood oxidative status and non-enzymatic antioxidant defense},
Journal = {POULTRY SCIENCE},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The adaptation of chickens to free-range rearing systems mainly involves
   the locomotory behavior, which is very different in fast-growing (FG)
   and slow-growing (SG) strains. This study aimed to compare the effect of
   moderate locomotory activity (induced and prolonged) on the blood
   oxidative status in a slow-growing chicken strain with that in a
   fastgrowing one. Thirty FG (Ross 308) birds and 30 SG (Hubbard) birds
   were divided into 2 groups for each strain and subjected to different
   treatments: no exercise (the control group {[}C]) and 1 h of walking at
   4 km/h (the exercise group {[}E]). Daily exercise was promoted by
   operators, who walked behind the animals around a paddock. Blood samples
   were obtained weekly from both groups. For the E group, samples were
   obtained before exercise (E-1) and after exercise (E-2). Oxidative
   markers (creatine kinase {[}CK], reactive oxygen molecular substance
   {[}ROMS], thiobarbituric acid reactive substances {[}TBARS]), and
   antioxidant compounds (alpha-tocopherol {[}alpha-T], gamma-tocopherol
   {[}gamma-T], dtocopherol {[}delta-T], alpha-tocotrienol {[}alpha-T3],
   gamma-tocotrienol {[}gamma-T-3], retinol, and carotenoids) were
   evaluated. In both strains, the CK level was higher in chickens
   subjected to exercise; however, its increase was greater in the FG group
   than in the SG one (1.56-fold vs. 1.08fold). The antioxidant status was
   worse in FG strain birds subjected to exercise, whereas the status
   remained nearly the same in the SG strain birds. The alpha-T and retinol
   concentrations were significantly reduced by exercise, primarily in the
   FG group, whereas the other antioxidant compounds (alpha-T-3, gamma-T-3
   , gamma-T, delta-T, lutein, and zeaxanthin) were unaffected by strain or
   treatment. The FG and SG strains had different responses to exercise,
   and only the SG showed a progressive reduction in TBARS and ROMS values
   during the 28-day experiment. Accordingly, moderate exercise may be
   beneficial only when the birds have suitable behavioral characteristics
   (e.g., higher kinetic activity, rusticity, and explorative nature) or
   physical characteristics (e.g., low body weight); otherwise, exercise is
   highly stressful and affects physiology and wellbeing.},

Abstract = {Dogs are a common feeding hosts for Ixodes ricinus and may act as
   reservoir hosts for zoonotic tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) and as carriers
   of infected ticks into human settings. The aim of this work was to
   evaluate the presence of several selected TBPs of significant public
   health concern by molecular methods in I. ricinus recovered from dogs
   living in urban and suburban settings in central Italy. A total of 212
   I. ricinus specimens were collected from the coat of domestic dogs. DNA
   was extracted from each specimen individually and tested for Rickettsia
   spp., Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Babesia spp., and Anaplasma
   phagocytophilum, using real-time and conventional PCR protocols,
   followed by sequencing. Sixty-one ticks (28.8\%) tested positive for
   TBPs; 57 samples were infected by one pathogen, while four showed
   coinfections. Rickettsia spp. was detected in 39 specimens (18.4\%), of
   which 32 were identified as Rickettsia monacensis and seven as
   Rickettsia helvetica. Twenty-two samples (10.4\%) tested positive for A.
   phagocytophilum; Borrelia lusitaniae and Borrelia afzelii were detected
   in two specimens and one specimen, respectively. One tick (0.5\%) was
   found to be positive for Babesia venatorum (EU1). Our findings reveal
   the significant exposure of dogs to TBPs of public health concern and
   provide data on the role of dogs in the circulation of I. ricinus-borne
   pathogens in central Italy.},

Title = {Expression of hepcidin and ferroportin in full term placenta of pregnant
   cows},
Journal = {THERIOGENOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {90-97},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Hepcidin (HEP) and ferroportin (FPN) play a central role in systemic
   iron homeostasis. The HEP/FPN axis controls both extracellular iron
   concentration and total body iron levels. HEP is synthesized mainly by
   hepatocytes and controls the absorption of dietary iron and the
   distribution of iron to the various cell types; its synthesis is
   regulated by both iron and innate immunity. FPN is a membrane protein
   and the major exporter of iron from mammalian cells, including iron
   recycling macrophages, iron absorbing duodenal enterocytes, and iron
   storing hepatocytes. HEP limits the pool of extracellular iron by
   binding FPN and mediating its degradation, thus preventing its release
   from intracellular sources. Here we investigated, for the first time,
   the molecular and morphological expression of HEP and FPN in placenta of
   pregnant cows at term. Their expression has been evaluated investigating
   their mRNAs by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Sequencing of related
   amplicons revealed a 100\% identity with HEP and FPN sequences from Bos
   taurus as reported in the GeneBank (mRNASequence ID: NM\_001114508.2 and
   ID: NM\_001077970.1, respectively). HEP and FPN proteins have also been
   revealed by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. The
   strongest immunoreactivity for both proteins was observed in the
   cytoplasm of the trophoblastic cells of the villi and the caruncular
   crypts of the placentome. Hep mRNA was more representative in caruncular
   rather cotyledonar areas; on the contrary, Fpn mRNA was more expressed
   in cotyledonar rather than in caruncular areas. Transcripts of ferritin,
   transferrin and its receptor have been also documented by real time
   RT-PCR.
   HEP and FPN placental proteins may play a dual role. HEP/FPN axis seems
   to have a central role in infections, with microorganisms within
   macrophages or that survive in the bloodstream or other cellular spaces.
   In addition, HEP may be responsible for iron flux regulation as a
   molecular bridge for iron trafficking and response to infection. FPN may
   also have a significant role for embryonic development, growth and
   organogenesis. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Abstract = {ERas is a new gene recently found in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and
   localized on the X chromosome. It plays a role in mouse ES cell survival
   and is constitutively active without any mutations. It was also found to
   be responsible for the maintenance of quiescence of the hepatic stellate
   cells (HSCs), liver-resident mesenchymal stem cells, the activation of
   which results in liver fibrosis. This gene was not present in human ES
   cells. ERas was found to be activated in a significant population of
   human gastric cancer, where ERAS may play a crucial role in gastric
   cancer cell survival and metastases to liver via down-regulation of
   E-cadherin. ERas gene has been found to be expressed both in ES cells
   and adult tissues of cynomolgus monkey. Cynomolgus ERAS did not promote
   cell proliferation or induce tumor formation. ERAS was also detected in
   normal and neoplastic urothelium of the urinary bladder in cattle, where
   bovine ERAS formed a constitutive complex with platelet derived growth
   factor 13 receptor (PDGF beta R) resulting in the activation of AKT
   signaling. Here, molecular and morphological findings of ERAS in the
   full term placenta of pregnant cows have been investigated for the first
   time. ERAS was studied by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Alignment
   of the sequence detects a 100\% identity with all transcript variant
   bovine ERas mRNAs, present in the GenBank database
   (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Furthermore, ERAS was detected by Western
   blot and investigated by real time PCR that revealed an amount of ERAS
   more than ERAS found in normal bovine urothelium but less than ERAS
   present in the liver. Immunohistochemical examination revealed the
   presence of ERAS protein both at the level of plasma membrane and in
   cytoplasm of epithelial cells lining caruncular crypts and in
   trophoblasts of villi. An evident ERAS immunoreactivity was also seen
   throughout the chorionic and uterine gland epithelium. Although this is
   not a functional study and further investigations will be warranted, it
   is conceivable that ERAS may have pleiotropic effects in the placenta,
   some of which, like normal urothelial cells, might lead to activation of
   AMT pathway. We speculate that ERAS may play a key role in cellular
   processes such as cell differentiation and movement. Accordingly, we
   believe it may be an important factor involved in trophoblast
   invasiveness via AKT signaling pathway. Therefore, ERas gene is a
   functional gene which contributes to homeostasis of bovine placenta. (C)

Abstract = {Honey is a valuable food produced by bees from sugary substances that
   they gather in nature. The transformation the nectar into honey, by
   bees, is long and complex. Except for honey, where heavy metals are
   absent or are found only in traces, the bees and their products have
   always been considered excellent biomarkers of such contaminants. We
   have assumed that the absence of heavy metals in honey is due to the
   presence of a detoxification system in the digestive system of bees,
   which involves metallothioneins, proteins that have a role in the
   homeostatic control of essential and non-essential metals. We have
   placed the beehives in three different zones: industrial, urban and
   rural. Investigations were carried out with ICP-MS method for the
   detection of heavy metals in the guts of honey bees and honey. The
   metallothioneins have been identified by Immunohistochemical and
   Western-blotting analisys. The investigations have shown the presence of
   heavy metals only in bees guts but not in honey, while the presence of
   metallothionein has been highlighted only in epithelium of the honey
   sac, demonstrating the existence of an efficient system of
   detoxification of heavy metals.},

Abstract = {During the investigations on ticks and tick-borne pathogens (TBP) range
   expansion in the Northern Apennines, we captured 107 Podarcis muralis
   lizards. Sixty-eight animals were infested by immature Ixodes ricinus,
   Haemaphysalis sulcata and H. punctata. Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. was
   detected in 3.7\% of I. ricinus larvae and 8.0\% of nymphs. Together
   with the species-specific B. lusitaniae, we identified B. garinii, B.
   afzelii and B. valaisiana. Rickettsia spp. (18.1\% larvae, 12.0\%
   nymphs), namely R. monacensis, R. helvetica and R. hoogstraalii, were
   also found in I. ricinus. R. hoogstraalii was detected in H. sulcata
   nymphs as well, while the two H. punctata did not harbour any bacteria.
   One out of 16 lizard tail tissues was positive to R. helvetica. Our
   results support the hypothesis that lizards are involved in the
   epidemiological cycles of TBP. The heterogeneity of B. burgdorferi
   genospecies mirrors previous findings in questing ticks in the area, and
   their finding in attached I. ricinus larvae suggests that lizards may
   contribute to the maintenance of different genospecies. The rickettsiae
   are new findings in the study area, and R. helvetica infection in a tail
   tissue indicates a systemic infection. R. hoogstraalii is reported for
   the first time in I. ricinus ticks. Lizards seem to favour the bacterial
   exchange among different tick species, with possible public health
   consequences.},

Abstract = {In the last decade there has been a rapid global spread of
   methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) clones
   displaying multidrug resistance in dogs. We investigated prevalence,
   antimicrobial susceptibility and clonal distribution of MRSP isolated
   from clinical canine samples between during 2011-2014. Following species
   identification by nuc VCR, MRSP were confirmed by the presence of mecA
   and characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, Pulsed Field
   Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE), SCCmec typing, and Multi-Locus Sequence
   Typing (MLST) of a few isolates having distinct PFGE profiles. Both the
   MRSP isolation frequency in the 175 samples tested (12\%) and the
   prevalence of methicillin resistance amongst the 63 S. pseudintermedius
   isolates (33\%) were high compared to a previous study in Italy.
   Sequence type (ST)71 carrying SCCmec type II-III, described as the
   epidemic European MRSP clone, accounted for approximately half of the
   isolates. The remaining isolates belonged to ST410-SCCmec type II-III,
   ST258-SCCmec type IV and other three clones associated with SCCmec type
   IV (ST261, ST290 and ST477). MRSP were consistently resistant to
   potentiated sulfonamides, and more frequently to clindamycin,
   ciprofloxacin and doxycycline than methicillin-susceptible isolates.
   Gentamicin was the only antibiotic showing good in vitro activity on all
   MRSP with 20 of the 21 isolates being susceptible. Results confirm a
   high prevalence of MRSP amongst clinical samples in Italy, revealing the
   emergence of new clones other than ST71, such as ST258, ST410, ST261,
   ST290 and ST477, here describe for the first time. Implementation of
   antimicrobial stewardship and surveillance programmes are required to
   prevent the emergence of new MRSP clones and reducing transmission in
   small animal practice.},

Title = {Emergence of carp edema virus (CEV) and its significance to European

Abstract = {Carp edema virus disease (CEVD), also known as koi sleepy disease, is
   caused by a poxvirus associated with outbreaks of clinical disease in
   koi and common carp Cyprinus carpio. Originally characterised in Japan
   in the 1970s, international trade in koi has led to the spread of CEV,
   although the first recognised outbreak of the disease outside of Japan
   was not reported until 1996 in the USA. In Europe, the disease was first
   recognised in 2009 and, as detection and diagnosis have improved, more
   EU member states have reported CEV associated with disease outbreaks.
   Although the structure of the CEV genome is not yet elucidated,
   molecular epidemiology studies have suggested distinct geographical
   populations of CEV infecting both koi and common carp. Detection and
   identification of cases of CEVD in common carp were unreliable using the
   original PCR primers. New primers for conventional and quantitative PCR
   (qPCR) have been designed that improve detection, and their sequences
   are provided in this paper. The qPCR primers have successfully detected
   CEV DNA in archive material from investigations of unexplained carp
   mortalities conducted > 15 yr ago. Improvement in disease management and
   control is possible, and the principles of biosecurity, good health
   management and disease surveillance, applied to koi herpesvirus disease,
   can be equally applied to CEVD. However, further research studies are
   needed to fill the knowledge gaps in the disease pathogenesis and
   epidemiology that, currently, prevent an accurate assessment of the
   likely impact of CEVD on European koi and common carp aquaculture and on
   wild carp stocks.},

Title = {MG-132 reduces virus release in Bovine herpesvirus-1 infection},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {OCT 17},
Abstract = {Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) can provoke conjunctivitis, abortions and
   shipping fever. BoHV-1 infection can also cause immunosuppression and
   increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections, leading to
   pneumonia and occasionally to death. Herein, we investigated the
   influence of MG-132, a proteasome inhibitor, on BoHV-1 infection in
   bovine kidney (MDBK) cells. Infection of MDBK cells with BoHV-1 induces
   apoptotic cell death that enhances virus release. Whereas, MG-132
   inhibited virus-induced apoptosis and stimulated autophagy. Protein
   expression of viral infected cell protein 0 (bICP0), which is
   constitutively expressed during infection and is able to stimulate
   Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), was completely inhibited by MG-132.
   These results were accompanied by a significant delay in the NF-kappa B
   activation. Interestingly, the efficient virus release provoked by
   BoHV-1-induced apoptosis was significantly reduced by MG-132. Overall,
   this study suggests that MG-132, through the activation of autophagy,
   may limit BoHV-1 replication during productive infection, by providing
   an antiviral defense mechanism.},

Journal = {FOOD CHEMISTRY},

Volume = {233},

Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {The profile of 18 trace elements was traced in 68 milk samples collected
   from buffalo farms in the territory known as the ``Land of Fires{''} in
   the Campania region (Italy). This area has been polluted by the illegal
   dumping in fields of industrial or domestic waste, wich is sometimes
   then burned spreading toxic contaminants. Milk from buffaloes raised on
   rural farms might be a good indicator of environmental contamination
   risk in the human food chain. Trace element analysis in milk was
   performed using mass spectrometry. One milk sample was found to be
   non-compliant due to high Pb concentration. In the absence of threshold
   values for the elements, established through legislation, the results
   were compared with similar studies from other countries, and in most
   cases the content determined in this study was in agreement with values
   reported elsewhere and do not represent a risk to human health. (C) 2017

Title = {First characterization of a Middle-East GI-23 lineage (Var2-like) of

Journal = {VIRUS RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {242},
Pages = {43-48},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Variants assigned to GI-23 lineage of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV),
   formerly called Var2, have circulated for nearly 20 years only in
   countries of the Middle East. Strains of this lineage were first
   identified in Israel in 1998. More severe form of the virus appeared in
   2006, when the second wave of Var2 epidemic has spread over the Middle
   East region. The present study describes the detection and detailed
   genetic characterization of the GI-23 viruses in Poland. The full-length
   genome of gammaCoV/Ck/Poland/G052/2016 strain consists of 27596
   nucleotides and has typical organization for IBV
   (UTR5'-POl-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-UTR3'). The phylogenetic analysis
   of the complete sequence showed that it formed separate branch distinct
   from all of the full-length genome sequences analyzed in this study.
   Recombination analyses with other gammacoronaviruses revealed that
   Polish GI-23 strain may originate from recombination events and
   potential donors of build-in sequences are IBV of GI-1, GI-13 and G-19
   lineages (Mass-, 793B- and QX-like strains, respectively). The 1a, 1b
   and N genes were involved in these recombination events. The source of
   virus introduction to the chicken population in Poland is unknown.},

Title = {Cardiovascular flukes (Trematoda: Spirorchiidae) in Caretta caretta
   Linnaeus, 1758 from the Mediterranean Sea},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {Background: The northern Adriatic Sea represents one of the most
   important neritic foraging grounds for the loggerhead sea turtle Caretta
   caretta L. in the Mediterranean Sea. Four genera of blood flukes with
   variable prevalence and pathogenic impact have been reported worldwide
   in this species. Hapalotrema Looss, 1899 and Amphiorchis Price, 1934 are
   the only two genera reported in Mediterranean waters; however, updated
   data describing spirorchiidiasis in the central and eastern
   Mediterranean and infection prevalence are still lacking. This work
   aimed to investigate the presence and pathology of spirorchiidiasis in
   C. caretta in the Mediterranean Sea.
   Methods: One hundred sixty-eight animals stranded along the northwestern
   Adriatic coast between 2009 and 2015 were submitted to necropsy and
   subsequent analyses for the detection of adult flukes, detection of eggs
   in the faeces and spleen and histopathology. Molecular analyses were
   carried out on hosts (mitochondrial D-loop) and parasites (28S gene and
   ITS2 spacer) to trace the turtle origins and identify the fluke
   phylogenetic relationships.
   Results: Spirorchiidiasis was detected in 16.7\% of the animals.
   Hapalotrema mistroides (Monticelli, 1899) and Neospirorchis sp. were
   found in twenty-six and ten cases, respectively. Adult flukes were found
   in six cases, while eggs were detectable through copromicroscopic
   examination for all infected turtles, and the results for the detection
   of eggs in the spleen agreed with the copromicroscopic analysis. Only
   mild lesions were observed. Eggs of types 1 and 3 were grossly visible
   in the gastrointestinal mucosa, vasculitis was rarely observed in the
   heart and great vessels, and multifocal granulomas were widespread in
   the tissues. Molecular identification unambiguously assigned the
   spirorchiid samples to H. mistroides and Neospirorchis sp. Genetic
   characterization of loggerhead mtDNA pointed to a Mediterranean origin
   of the turtle hosts.
   Conclusion: This survey provides new data on the spread of
   spirorchiidiasis in the Mediterranean loggerhead sea turtle population
   and reports for the first time the presence of Neospirorchis spp. in
   this basin. The infections did not have a causal effect on the death nor
   a strong impact on the general health status of the animals.},

Abstract = {Vero cell lines are extensively employed in viral vaccine manufacturing.
   Similarly to all established cells, mutations can occur during Vero
   cells in vitro amplification which can result in adverse features
   compromising their biological safety. To evaluate the potential
   neoplastic evolution of these cells, in vitro transformation test, gene
   expression analysis and karyotyping were compared among low- (127 and
   139 passages) and high-passage (passage 194) cell lines, as well as
   transformed colonies (TCs). In vivo tumorigenicity was also tested to
   confirm preliminary in vitro data obtained for low passage lines and
   TCs. Moreover, Vero cells cultivated in foetal bovine serum-free medium
   and derived from TCs were analysed to investigate the influence of
   cultivation methods on tumorigenic evolution. Low-passage Vero developed
   TCs in soft agar, without showing any tumorigenic evolution when
   inoculated in the animal model. Karyotyping showed a hypo-diploid modal
   chromosome number and rearrangements with no difference among Vero cell
   line passages and TCs. These abnormalities were reported also in
   serum-free cultivated Vero. Gene expression revealed that high-passage
   Vero cells had several under-expressed and a few over-expressed genes
   compared to low-passage ones. Gene ontology revealed no significant
   enrichment of pathways related to oncogenic risk. These findings suggest
   that in vitro high passage, and not culture conditions, induces Vero
   transformation correlated to karyotype and gene expression alterations.
   These data, together with previous investigations reporting tumour
   induction in high-passage Vero cells, suggest the use of low-passage
   Vero cells or cell lines other than Vero to increase the safety of
   vaccine manufacturing.},

Title = {The Contribution of Adipose Tissue-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells and
   Platelet-Rich Plasma to the Treatment of Chronic Equine Laminitis: A
   Proof of Concept},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES},
Year = {2017},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Laminitis, a highly debilitating disease of the foot in ungulates, is
   characterized by pathological changes of the complex lamellar structures
   that maintain the appendicular skeleton within the hoof. Laminitis is a
   multifactorial disease that involves perturbation of the vascular,
   hematological, and inflammatory homeostasis of the foot. Interestingly,
   the pathogenesis of the disease resembles what is observed in metabolic
   syndromes and sepsis-induced organ failure in humans and animals. We
   hypothesized that local administration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
   and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) might contribute to establishing an
   anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic environment, and could stimulate
   the injured tissue in order to restore its functional integrity.
   According to this assumption, an experimental protocol based on the
   local intravenous administration of adipose tissue-derived MSCs (aMSCs)
   in combination with PRP was developed for the treatment of horses
   affected by chronic laminitis. Nine horses with severely compromised
   venograms (showing grade III and IV laminitis) that had been
   unsuccessfully treated with conventional therapies were enrolled. aMSCs
   and PRP (15 x 10(6) cells resuspended in 15 mL of PRP) were injected
   into the lateral or medial digital vein three times, at one-month
   intervals. The first administration was performed with allogeneic aMSCs,
   while for the following administrations, autologous aMSCs were used.
   There was no adverse short-term reaction to the intravenous injection of
   aMSCs. In the long term, venograms outlined, in all subjects, a
   progressive amelioration of the vascularization of the foot. An
   improvement in the structure and function of the hoof was also observed.
   No adverse events were reported during the follow-up, and the horses
   returned to a comfortable quality of life. Although the number of
   animals enrolled in the study is limited, both clinical observations and
   venography demonstrated an enhancement in the condition of all horses,
   suggesting that the regenerative therapies in chronic laminitis could be
   useful, and are worthy of further investigation.},

Title = {Application of Free Choice Profiling to assess the emotional state of
   dogs housed in shelter environments},
Journal = {APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {195},
Pages = {72-79},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Dogs housed in shelters may experience poor welfare. To ensure these
   dogs a good quality of life, welfare assessment tools should be
   sensitive not only to the animals' physical health but also to their
   mental state, including the assessment of positive and negative
   emotions. In this study, we focused on the assessment of shelter dogs'
   emotional expression using a Qualitative Behavioural Assessment (QBA)
   approach. Previous work successfully applied QBA to assess the emotional
   state of working and rescue dogs, and the observations were carried out
   on individual dogs in standardised settings with little or no
   stimulation. Results from such experiments might not be fully
   representative of the expressive demeanour that a dog could show in
   shelter conditions, where animals are exposed to a number of social and
   environmental stimuli. Thus, our aim was to apply QBA to a wider variety
   of shelter environments and social contexts than has been done so far,
   giving the animals the opportunity to express a wider repertoire of
   emotions and allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of dogs'
   affective state. A set of descriptive terms was generated using
   Free-Choice-Profiling methodology by a group of 13 observers. QBA was
   made by scoring 16 video clips of shelter dogs in very different
   contexts (e.g. single/pair/group housing, presence/absence of human
   activity). Generalised Procrustes Analysis showed a high consensus
   between observers' scoring patterns (75.7\%; p < 0.001), and generated
   three main consensus dimensions explaining overall 66.6\% of the
   variation between clips. The terms generated by the observers describing
   these consensus dimensions were semantically consistent, and
   characterised dogs as ranging: 1) from ``playful/sociable/curious{''} to
   ``bored/uncomfortable/apathetic{''}, 2) from ``relaxed/tranquil{''} to
   ``nervous/alert/fearful{''} and 3) from ``stressed/anxious{''} to
   ``wary/timorous/hesitant{''}. Overall, these broad dimensions are
   similar to those described in previous QBA studies on dogs. However, we
   detected differences in the type or frequency of the terms used,
   especially concerning three semantic spheres (i.e. ``sociability{''},
   ``fearfulness{''} and ``boredom{''}). It appears that, compared to what
   has been reported previously, by presenting more complex contexts and
   thus giving the animals the opportunity to express different behaviours,
   we generated a richer list of terms representing a wider repertoire of
   emotions. Our results support the notion that QBA can be immediately
   sensitive to an animal's circumstances, integrating the ways in which,
   animals experience the conditions in which they live into meaningful
   emotional indicators. This also highlights the importance of developing
   QBA tools that are species- and context-specific, especially for applied
   purposes.},

Title = {Pasture influence on fatty acids profile of mountain farms bovine milk},
Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {5},
Pages = {163-168},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Introduction - Milk and dairy products are considered an important
   source of fatty acids in the diet that varies in quantity according to
   the methods of bovine rearing and feeding. In the last decades,
   evaluation of the fatty acid composition in bovine milk has been the
   subject of several studies for the beneficial effects on human health.
   The aim of this study is to quantify satured and unsatured fatty acids
   by indirect estimation with Infrared spectroscopy in bovine bulk tank
   milk samples collected in typical mountain farms, in particular to
   confirm the effect of pasture period on the milk composition.
   Materials and methods - The 189 milk samples were collected from 37
   dairy farms representative of the typical ``farm{''} in a mountainous
   area of North Italy (Valle Camonica): small (12 heads/farm on average),
   prevalence of Brown Alpine and Red Piebald, low production level (about
   16 Lt/head/die), mainly fed with local hay, integration of feed-stuffs
   under 30\% of the feed ration, without maize silage. The samples were
   collected directly from farms (first period, April-May 2015) or from
   pasture areas (second period, June-July 2015).
   Results and discussion - Our observations confirm the change in milk
   composition related to the grazing period as well with the increased
   content in fat and unsatured fatty acids and, in particular, the
   ``grazing effect{''} was statistically confirmed by a significant
   increase in the unsatured/satured fatty acids ratio: 0.42 (SD 0.025) in
   farms vs 0.57 (SD 0.048) in pasture areas, as already highlighted by
   other studies made with reference method.
   Conclusions - The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analytical
   method, easy to use and cheap, although the indirect evaluation of the
   milk composition, produces results and information useful to support the
   quality of milk and milk products in mountain areas, also for larger
   projects in the future.},

Title = {Time-optimal control strategies in SIR epidemic models},
Journal = {MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {292},
Pages = {86-96},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {We investigate the time-optimal control problem in SIR
   (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) epidemic models, focusing on different
   control policies: vaccination, isolation, culling, and reduction of
   transmission. Applying the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP) to the
   unconstrained control problems (i.e. without costs of control or
   resource limitations), we prove that, for all the policies investigated,
   only bang bang controls with at most one switch are admitted. When a
   switch occurs, the optimal strategy is to delay the control action some
   amount of time and then apply the control at the maximum rate for the
   remainder of the outbreak.
   This result is in contrast with previous findings on the unconstrained
   problems of minimizing the total infectious burden over an outbreak,
   where the optimal strategy is to use the maximal control for the entire
   epidemic. Then, the critical consequence of our results is that, in a
   wide range of epidemiological circumstances, it may be impossible to
   minimize the total infectious burden while minimizing the epidemic
   duration, and vice versa.
   Moreover, numerical simulations highlighted additional unexpected
   results, showing that the optimal control can be delayed also when the
   control reproduction number is lower than one and that the switching
   time from no control to maximum control can even occur after the peak of
   infection has been reached. Our results are especially important for
   livestock diseases where the minimization of outbreaks duration is a
   priority due to sanitary restrictions imposed to farms during ongoing
   epidemics, such as animal movements and export bans. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {Little is known about the characteristics and diseases associated with
   methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in nondomestic
   animals. Four presumptive MRSA isolates, obtained from clinical (n = 3)
   and surveillance specimens (n = 1) from dwarf (Helogale parvula) and
   yellow mongooses (Cynictis penicillata) from a United Kingdom zoo, were
   analyzed by PCR for detection of mecA and mecC-mediated methicillin
   resistance, and virulence genes. Isolates were genotyped by multilocus
   sequence typing (MLST) and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec
   (SCCmec) and spa sequence typing. Three isolates, obtained from the
   dwarf mongooses, carried mecA, tetK, and fexA resistance and virulence
   genes (icaA, icaD, and sec) and were typed to SCCmec IVa, spa type t899,
   and clonal complex (CC) 398. The fourth MRSA isolate, obtained from the
   femoral bone marrow of a yellow mongoose showing postmortem findings
   consistent with septicemia, carried mecC and was oxacillin/cefoxitin
   susceptible, when tested at 37 degrees C but showed a characteristic
   MRSA susceptibility profile at 25 degrees C +/- 2 degrees C.
   Furthermore, this isolate exhibited a different genetic background
   (SCCmecXI/t843/CC130) and had biofilm-associated genes (bap, icaA, and
   icaD) and tetK tetracycline resistance genes. This work describes the
   first isolation of livestock-associated MRSA CC398 from two zoo mongoose
   species where it was associated with both clinical disease and
   colonization, and the first isolation of mecC MRSA from a zoo species in
   the United Kingdom. Both reports highlight the potential for zoo species
   to act as reservoirs for these zoonotic agents.},

Abstract = {The eradication of tuberculosis, brucellosis and leucosis in cattle has
   not yet been achieved in the entire Italian territory. The region of
   Lazio, Central Italy, represents an interesting case study to evaluate
   the evolution of costs for these eradication programmes, as in some
   provinces the eradication has been officially achieved, in some others
   the prevalence has been close to zero for years, and in still others
   disease outbreaks have been continuously reported. The objectives of
   this study were i) to describe the costs for the eradication programmes
   for tuberculosis, brucellosis and leucosis in cattle carried out in
   Lazio between 2007 and 2011, ii) to calculate the ratio between the
   financial contribution of the European Union (EU) for the eradication
   programmes and the estimated total costs and iii) to estimate the
   potential savings that can be made when a province gains the
   certification of freedom from disease. For the i) and ii) objectives,
   data were collected from official sources and a costing procedure was
   applied from the perspective of the Regional Health Service. For the
   iii) objective, a Bayesian AR(1) regression was used to evaluate the
   average percentage reduction in costs for a province that gained the
   certification. The total cost for the eradication programmes adjusted
   for inflation to 1 January 2016 was estimated at 18919797 euro (5th and
   95th percentiles of the distribution: 18325050-19552080 euro). When a
   province gained the certification of freedom from disease, costs
   decreased on average by (median of the posterior distribution) 47.5\%,
   54.5\% and 54.9\% for the eradication programmes of tuberculosis,
   brucellosis and leucosis, respectively. Information on possible savings
   from the reduction of control costs can help policy makers operating
   under budget constraints to justify the use of additional resources for
   the final phase of eradication.},

Abstract = {An increase in autochthonous hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections has been
   recorded in Italy suspected to be zoonotically transmitted from pigs;
   this study was carried out to determinate the seroprevalence and risk
   factors associated with hepatitis HEV exposition, both in swine and
   humans working in pig farms, located within a high-density pig farming
   area in Piedmont region, north-western Italy. The presence of viral RNA
   in human and swine samples was also evaluated, and phylogenetic analysis
   was performed on HEV-positive samples. Forty-two swine farms were
   sampled; 142 workers were enrolled in the study and classified into two
   groups: (i) 69 workers with occupational contact with swine (including
   veterinarians and farmers) recruited in the 42 sampled farms; (ii) 73
   without occupational contact with swine. Forty-one of 42 (97\%) swine
   farms resulted positive to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test for
   HEV antibodies (Abs). Overall seroprevalence in swine was 50\%
   (441/879), with seropositivity rate higher in sows (333/469, 71\%). HEV
   RNA in stool samples was detected in animals from 13 of 42 tested farms
   (31\%), and a higher positivity resulted in weaners (40/246, 16.3\%).
   Phylogenetic analysis classified all HEV isolates within genotype 3
   (subtypes 3f, 3e, 3c). All humans were negative for HEV viral genome in
   blood. Five of 142 sera were positive for IgG anti-HEV with an overall
   prevalence of 3.52\% with no statistically significant differences in
   prevalence rates between workers at zoonotic risk and the control group
   (5.7\% versus 1.3\%). In contrast, a significant difference (OR 10.1)
   was observed within the subgroup including subjects exposed for short
   periods (veterinarians) compared with those who worked for long periods
   (farmers) suggesting a correlation between the time of exposure and the
   likelihood of HEV infection. Reporting HEV infection is not mandatory in
   Italy, but a constant epidemiological surveillance should be ensured to
   clarify the epidemiology of this disease.},

Abstract = {Yersinia enterocolitica causes foodborne disease in humans and
   infections are usually acquired from contaminated raw or undercooked
   pork. Pigs are considered the primary reservoir of human pathogenic
   bio-serotypes. A total of 376 tonsil tissue samples collected after
   evisceration and cutting from pig carcasses were tested for Yersinia
   enterocolitica. Animals came from an abattoir located in the Abruzzo
   region, Italy. Yersinia enterocolitica was isolated from 35 out of 376
   (9.31\%) samples. A total of 47 strains were isolated, the prevalent
   bio-serotype was 4/O: 3 (95.74\%), followed by bio-serotype 4/O: 9
   (2.13\%), and 3/O: 9 (2.13\%). When characterized by DNA microarray, all
   strains clustered into 2 main groups. The bigger group was characterised
   by the presence of plasmid genes of the secretion apparatus as well as
   by the genes for the flagellum transport machinery, while the smaller
   group was characterised only by genes for the flagellum transport
   machinery. The high frequency of the pathogenic biotype 4/O: 3 able to
   infect humans and considered an emerging zoonotic pathogen confirms the
   role of pigs as natural reservoir. Since there is no official data on
   Yersinia enterocolitica, it is difficult to assess the implications of
   this food pathogen for public health. A monitoring program should be
   implemented for contamination in food in order to assess the risk for
   the consumer linked to raw or undercooked pork products.},

Abstract = {The Chianina, one of the oldest and most important cattle breeds of
   Italy, is now reared all over the world. The Chianina has been known and
   appreciated since ancient times because, from a nutritional point of
   view, its meat has no proper rivals. To date, studies have been
   performed to evaluate the genetic profile of the breed, but knowledge
   about the chemical profile is generally lacking. Due to the increased
   interest from farmers regarding breeding of the Chianina, this study
   proposes a preliminary evaluation of main endogenous urinary
   corticosteroids (cortisol and cortisone) and most commonly used
   synthetic one (dexamethasone). Moreover, after recent findings regarding
   the presence of endogenous prednisolone in the urine of more popular
   breeds, particular attention was given to analysis of the presence of
   prednisolone and prednisone, as well. For this aim, the urine samples of
   12 young cows and 30 young bulls was collected at the farms and analysed
   using a fit-for-purpose LC-MS/MS method. The preliminary results of this
   study show that prednisolone was found only in Chianina females (3 out
   of 12). Cortisol and cortisone were found at concentrations that showed
   a high inter-individual variability, and that were higher in female
   urine compared to that of males.},

Abstract = {Arsenic (As), Cadmium (Cd), Lead (Pb) and Mercury (Hg) were analyzed in
   different prepared meals. Baby food composite and school canteen lunches
   collected on a five-days basis were selected as potential surrogates of
   the diet of 9-12 months toddlers and of 4-9 years children,
   respectively. Five-days servings from an office canteen, three fast food
   meals, seven-days lunches from a hotel-school and duplicate 1-day
   portions including a vegetarian meal were surrogates of the diet of
   18-64 year adults. Occurrence data of pooled servings were determined by
   Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer including a Dynamic
   Reaction Cell (ICP-MS-DRC). From such surrogated diets, estimated
   intakes felt in the range for As (0.28-6.91 mu g kg(-1) body weight
   (b.w.) day(-1)), Cd (0.09-0.96 mu g kg(-1) b.w. day(-1)), Pb (0.14-1.50
   mu g kg(-1) b.w. day(-1)) and Hg (0.03-0.40 mu g kg(-1) b.w. day(-1)).
   For Cd, the intake from almost all surrogate diets considered resulted
   close to the Total Daily Intake (TDI) suggested by EFSA (0.36 mu g
   kg(-1) b.w. day(-1)).},

Title = {Nuclear morphometry in histological specimens of canine prostate cancer:
   Correlation with histological subtypes, Gleason score, methods of
   collection and survival time},
Journal = {RESEARCH IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Ten normal prostates, 22 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 29
   prostate cancer (PC) were morphometrically analyzed with regard to mean
   nuclear area (MNA), mean nuclear perimeter (MNP), mean nuclear diameter
   (MND), coefficient of variation of the nuclear area (NACV), mean nuclear
   diameter maximum (MDx), mean nuclear diameter minimum (MDm), mean
   nuclear form ellipse (MNFe) and form factor (FF). The relationship
   between nuclear morphometric parameters and histological type, Gleason
   score, methods of sample collection, presence of metastases and survival
   time of canine PC were also investigated. Overall, nuclei from
   neoplastic cells were larger, with greater variation in nuclear size and
   shape compared to normal and hyperplastic cells. Significant differences
   were found between more (small acinar/ductal) and less (cribriform,
   solid) differentiated PCs with regard to FF (p < 0.05). MNA, MNP, MND,
   MDx, and MDm were significantly correlated with the Gleason score of PC
   (p < 0.05). MNA, MNP, MDx and MNFe may also have important prognostic
   implications in canine prostatic cancer since negatively correlated with
   the survival time. Biopsy specimens contained nuclei that were smaller
   and more irregular in comparison to those in prostatectomy and necropsy
   specimens and therefore factors associated with tissue sampling and
   processing may influence the overall morphometric evaluation.
   The results indicate that nuclear morphometric analysis in combination
   with Gleason score can help in canine prostate cancer grading, thus
   contributing to the establishment of a more precise prognosis and
   patient's management.},

Abstract = {Limited information is available on suitable height of transport crates
   for turkeys. We compared behaviors and physiological indicators of four
   groups of 10 female turkeys each confined in either conventional (38.5
   cm height) or experimental (77 cm height) crates during six commercial
   pre-slaughter transportations for 86 km (76 +/- 4 min) along two tracts
   with one-lane streets, crossroads, bends, roundabouts (S1 and S2) and a
   highway tract (H) between S1 and S2. Only 36\% of birds in the higher
   crates maintained a standing position. In conventional versus
   experimental crates, the frequency of rising attempts was five/bird/hour
   versus less than one/bird/hour, while wing flapping was seven/bird/hour
   versus 20/bird/hour, and balance loss was one versus four/bird/hour. The
   behaviors of both groups differed significantly according to the route
   tract, with a lower frequency of stress-related behaviors at H. No
   scratches, fractures or hematomas were detected in any birds after
   transportation. Crate height had no significant effect on
   hemato-biochemical markers. These results suggest that crates enabling a
   standing position may increase potentially dangerous behaviors.
   Moreover, busy and curvy routes should be avoided, as they may
   contribute to increasing the frequency of stressrelated behaviors.},

   the availability of diagnostic assays would represent key components for
   adequate surveillance and control programs. In this study, the gene
   encoding the VP7 protein of EHD virus (EHDV) was expressed into a
   baculovirus-infected insect cell system. With this unpurified protein we
   developed a home-made competitive ELISA (cELISA) and a total number of
   275 serum samples, originating from domestic and wild ruminants, were
   tested. 74/275 were previously shown to be positive for EHDV antibodies
   by a commercially available ELISA kit. A ``very good{''} agreement was
   demonstrated when compared to a commercial ELISA kit (Cohen's kappa
   value = 0.832). Samples which caused disagreement between the two assays
   originated from wildlife which highlights the need for further
   validation by using serum samples from wild animals.},

Title = {Bovine papillomatosis in Sicily: virus identification, diagnosis and
   co-infections},
Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {5},
Pages = {171-174},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Introduction - Bovine papillomatosis is an infectious disease
   distributed worldwide among cattle herds consisting of
   hyper-proliferative lesions affecting cutaneous tissue and mucosa. The
   disease, known as papillomas, may occur in different part of the body.
   Bovine papillomaviruses (BPVs) are non-enveloped double stranded DNA
   viruses belonging to the Papillomaviridae family, a group of viruses
   that infect all amniotes. Despite the benign characters of the lesions,
   in some cases bovine papillomatosis may dramatically reduce the
   productive performances when the lesions are extensive over the body
   involving teats and udders.
   Aim - This work was particularly aimed at the identification and
   characterization of BPVs circulating in Sicily in order to obtain
   autovaccine against BPVs. Material and methods - Thirty-one epithelial
   lesions, collected from cattle, clinically diagnosed as papillomas, were
   referred to the Laboriatories of Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale
   of Sicily. Samples were analyzed by electron microscopy, PCR
   amplification, Rolling Circle Amplification, sequencing, negative
   staining electronic microscopy and standard histological examinations.
   Results and discussion - The investigation revealed the presence of
   different BPV types 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, mostly in the
   form of co-infections. Besides BPV amplification, zoonotic viruses
   belonging to the genus parapoxvirus within the Poxviridae family were
   screened and detected in 11 samples. This is the first study performed
   in Sicily, reporting a wide diversity of BPV genera and types
   circulating in the territory.
   Conclusion - The data collected showed the necessity of proper diagnosis
   to produce an effective vaccine while virus characterization is
   important to know the epidemiological scenario of the region and set
   appropriate control measures and reliable diagnostic methods for bovine
   papillomatosis. The presence of co-infecting zoonotic viral agents
   underlies the need for a better understanding of the possible
   interactions between the two viruses and suggests the importance of
   identifying proper measures to prevent the infection to humans.},

Title = {Prevalence and characterization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus

Abstract = {Between January and May 2012, a total of 286 bulk tank milk samples from
   dairy sheep farms located in central Italy were tested for the presence
   of Staphylococcus aureus. One hundred fifty-three samples were positive
   for S. aureus (53.5\%), with an average count of 2.53 log cfu/mL. A
   total of 679 S. aureus colonies were screened for methicillin resistance
   by the cefoxitin disk diffusion test, and 104 selected
   cefoxitin-susceptible isolates were also tested for their susceptibility
   to other antimicrobials representative of the most relevant classes
   active against Staphylococcus spp. by using the Kirby-Bauer disk
   diffusion method. Two methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
   isolates, carrying respectively the mecA and the mecC genes, were
   detected in 2 samples from 2 different farms (prevalence 0.7\%). The
   mecA-positive MRSA isolate was blaZ positive, belonged to spa type t127,
   sequence type (ST)1, clonal complex (CC)1, carried a staphylococcal
   cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type IVa, and was phenotypically
   resistant to all the beta-lactams tested and to erythromycin,
   streptomycin, kanamycin, and tetracycline. The mecC-positive MRSA
   isolate was negative for the chromosomally or plasmid-associated blaZ
   gene but positive for the blaZ allotype associated with SCCmec XI
   (blaZ-SCCmecXI), belonged to spa type 843, ST(CC)130, carried a SCCmec
   type XI, and was resistant only to beta-lactams. Both MRSA were negative
   for the presence of specific immune-evasion and virulence genes such as
   those coding for the Panton-Valentine leucocidin, the toxic shock
   syndrome toxin 1, and the immune evasion cluster genes. Regarding the
   presence of the major S. aureus enterotoxin genes, the mecC-positive
   MRSA tested negative, whereas the ST (CC)1 mecA-positive MRSA harbored
   the seh gene. Among the 104 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates
   examined for antimicrobial susceptibility, 63 (60.58\%) were susceptible
   to all the antimicrobials tested, and 41 (39.42\%) were resistant to at
   least 1 antimicrobial. In particular, 23 isolates (22.12\%) were
   resistant to tetracycline, 16 (15.38\%) to sulfonomides, 14 (13.46\%) to
   trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, and 9 (8.65\%) to ampicillin, whereas
   only 1 isolate was resistant to both fluoroquinolones and
   aminoglycosides. The high prevalence of S. aureus found in bulk tank
   milk samples and the isolation of MRSA, although at a low prevalence,
   underlines the importance of adopting control measures against S. aureus
   in dairy sheep farms to minimize the risks for animal and public health.
   Moreover, this study represents the first report of mecC-positive MRSA
   isolation in Italy and would confirm that, among livestock animals,
   sheep might act as a mecC-MRSA reservoir. Although this lineage seems to
   be rare in dairy sheep (0.35\% of farms tested), because mecC-positive
   MRSA are difficult to detect by diagnostic routine methods employed for
   mecA-positive livestock-associated MRSA, diagnostic laboratories should
   be aware of the importance of searching for the mecC gene in all the
   mecA-negative S. aureus isolates displaying resistance to oxacillin,
   cefoxitin, or both.},

Abstract = {Between 2007 and 2014, 83 cetaceans were found stranded along the
   Ligurian coast of Italy, in the Pelagos Sanctuary, the largest marine
   protected area in the Mediterranean basin. Forty-nine (59\%) were
   submitted to complete or partial necropsy, depending on the conservation
   status of the carcass. Based on gross and histological pathology and
   ancillary testing, the cause of death was determined and categorized as
   anthropogenic or natural (i.e., nonanthropogenic) in origin for 33
   animals (67\%) and of undetermined origin in the remaining 16 (33\%).
   Natural causes of death, accompanied by either poor or good nutritional
   status, were attributed to 29 animals (59\%), whereas four (8\%) were
   diagnosed with an anthropogenic cause of death, consisting of
   interaction with fishing activities. Infectious and noninfectious
   disease was the most common cause of death, involving 29 cetaceans
   (59\%). These data are valuable for understanding health and mortality
   trends in cetacean populations and can provide information for
   establishing policies for cetacean conservation and management in such
   an important protected area of the Mediterranean basin.},

Abstract = {Natural corticosteroids include two families of substances:
   mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. Several drugs of similar
   structure and biological activity have been synthesized and are
   currently used in the clinical practice. Beside legal pharmacological
   treatments, these drugs have been consistently misused in animal
   breeding. One of the most abused corticosteroids is prednisolone. For
   many years, prednisolone has been considered of exclusive synthetic
   origin, but nowadays a debate about its possible endogenous production
   is under way. Several studies have been addressed to ascertain the
   potential relationship between stressful conditions, such as
   transportation and slaughtering, and endogenous production of
   prednisolone. In order to verify further the effect of stressful
   conditions, our laboratory analysed urine samples collected from the
   cows participating to the ``Batailles des Reines{''} (a traditional
   contest based on ritual and spontaneous fights of pregnant cows), to
   verify if an endogenous prednisolone production may occur in these
   animals. We developed and validated a LC-MS/MS method for the
   simultaneous determination of cortisol, cortisone, prednisolone and five
   of its metabolites. The method was applied to the analysis of urine
   samples collected from ``Batailles des Reines{''} competitions in 2012
   and 2013. All these samples had been previously analysed within an
   anti-doping control program and tested compliant to all screenings.},

Abstract = {Human tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium bovis surveillance is
   affected by a lack of data. The aims of the present study were: (i) to
   estimate the proportion of human TB caused by M. bovis over a period of
   5 years in Bologna, Northern Italy, which, like most Western European
   countries, has been declared bovine TB-free; (ii) to compare the genetic
   profiles of M. bovis strains identified in humans with those circulating
   in cattle in the last 15 years in Italy. Among 511 TB patients, the
   proportion of human TB caused by M. bovis was 1.76\%, significantly
   associated to extra-pulmonary localization (P = 0.004) and to being
   elderly (P < 0.001) and Italy-born (P = 0.036). The molecular
   epidemiology analysis by spoligotyping and Multilocus Variable Tandem
   Repeat Analysis confirmed that most M. bovis strains from Italyborn
   patients matched those circulating in cattle herds in Italy between 2001
   and 2016. Two cases of Mycobacterium bovis BCG infection were also
   characterized. In conclusion, the rate of human TB caused by M. bovis
   was not negligible, highlighting the relevance of molecular typing in
   evaluating the effectiveness of programmes designed to eradicate TB in
   cattle in Italy.},

Title = {Seroprevalence of brucellosis in cattle and selected wildlife species at
   selected livestock/wildlife interface areas of the Gonarezhou National
   Park, Zimbabwe},
Journal = {PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {146},
Pages = {158-165},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {A study was conducted to investigate seroprevalence and risk factors for
   Brucella species infection in cattle and some wildlife species in
   communities living at the periphery of the Great Limpopo Transfrontier
   Conservation Area in south eastern Zimbabwe. Three study sites were
   selected based on the type of livestock wildlife interface: porous
   livestock wildlife interface (unrestricted); non-porous livestock
   wildlife interface (restricted by fencing); and livestock wildlife
   non-interface (totally absent or control). Sera were collected from
   cattle aged 2 years representing both female and intact male animals.
   Sera were also collected from selected wild ungulates from Mabalauta
   (porous interface) and Chipinda (non-interface) areas of the Gonarezhou
   National Park. Samples were screened for Brucellaantibodies using the
   Rose Bengal plate test and confirmed by the complement fixation test.
   Data were analysed by descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic
   regression modelling. In cattle, brucellosis seroprevalence from all
   areas was 16.7\% (169/1011; 95\% CI: 14.5-19.2\%). The porous interface
   recorded a significantly (p = 0.03) higher seroprevalence (19.5\%; 95\%
   CI: 16.1-23.4\%) compared to the non-interface area (13.0\%; 95\% CI:
   9.2-19.9\%). The odds of Brucellaseropositivity increased progressively
   with parity of animals and were also three times higher (OR = 3.0, 2.0 <
   OR < 4.6, p < 0.0001) in cows with history of abortion compared to those
   without. Brucella antibodies were detected in buffaloes; 20.7\% (95\%
   CI: 13.9-29.7\%) form both study sites, but no antibodies were detected
   from impalas and kudus. These results highlight the importance of porous
   interface in the interspecies transmission of Brucella species and that
   independent infections may be maintained in buffalo populations. Thus,
   brucellosis control aimed at limiting animal inter-species mixing may
   help reduce the risk of human brucellosis in interface areas. Further
   studies should aim at establishing subspecies identity and direction of
   possible transmission of brucellosis between wildlife and livestock.},

   Effects on milk production traits and blood metabolites},

Year = {2017},

Abstract = {Exhausted myrtle berries (EMB) is a by-product of the maceration process
   of myrtle (Myrna communis L.) berries to produce a commercial liqueur
   called Mirto. This study evaluated the effect of the dietary inclusion
   of EMB on milk production traits, milk coagulation properties, liver and
   kidney metabolic activity and nitrogen balance in lactating dairy ewes.
   Thirty Sarda dairy ewes were randomly assigned to 3 dietary treatments
   consisting of a control diet (CON), a diet supplemented with 50 g/d per
   head of EMB (EMB50), or a diet supplemented with 100 g/d per head of EMB
   (EMB100). The study lasted 13 weeks, with 2 weeks of adaptation period
   and 11 weeks of experimental period. Milk yield was measured and milk
   samples were collected weekly and analyzed for fat, protein, casein,
   lactose, milk urea (MU) content and somatic cell count (SCC). Milk
   samples collected every two weeks were analyzed for milk coagulation
   properties. Blood samples were collected on d 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 of
   the experiment by jugular vein puncture and analyzed for hematological
   parameters, albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin, creatinine,
   gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST),
   alanine aminotransferase (ALT), protein, blood urea (BU), and serum
   protein fractions. Dietary treatments did not affect milk yield,
   composition and coagulation properties, except for MU, which decreased
   as the dose of EMB in the diet increased, and SCC. Diets did not
   influence hematological, kidney and liver parameters, except for BU
   content and blood protein, which decreased with the inclusion of EMB in
   the diet. The reduction in MU and BU as EMB dose increased suggests that
   the EMB use might positively affect the dietary nitrogen use. The
   limited variation in milk production traits, and hematological and
   metabolic parameters suggests that EMB can be included in the diet of
   dairy ewes without adverse effects on milk production and health status.},

Abstract = {Canine vector-borne diseases (CVBDs) are caused by a range of pathogens
   transmitted to dogs by arthropods. The present study investigates
   Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma spp., Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, and
   Dirofilaria immitis seroprevalences in hunting dogs from southern Italy.
   Dogs (no. 1335) were tested using a commercial in-clinic enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay kit. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated by logistic
   regression analysis to identify risk factors. Overall, 138/1335 dogs
   (10.3\%) were seroreactive to at least one CVBD pathogen. E. canis,
   Anaplasma spp., B. burgdorferi s.l., and D. immitis seroprevalences were
   7.6, 4.4, 0.3, and 0.2\%, respectively. E. canis and Anaplasma spp.
   co-exposures were found in 30 dogs (2.2\%), compared with Anaplasma spp.
   and B. burgdorferi s.l. co-exposures in 2 dogs (0.1\%). Adult age was a
   risk factor for E. canis (OR 2.35) seroreactivity whereas hunting
   fur-bearing animals for E. canis (OR 4.75) and Anaplasma spp. (OR 1.87),
   respectively. The historical presence of tick infestation was identified
   as a risk factor for positivity to E. canis (OR 2.08) and Anaplasma spp.
   (OR 2.15). Finally, larger dog pack size was significantly associated
   with E. canis (OR 1.85) and Anaplasma spp. (OR 2.42) exposures. The
   results of the present survey indicated that hunting dog populations are
   at relative risk of CVBDs in southern Italy. Further studies are needed
   to evaluate the role of hunting dogs in the epidemiology of vector-borne
   organisms due to sharing common environments with wild, sympatric animal
   populations.},

Abstract = {The Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) is the aetiological agent of
   chronic bee paralysis, a contagious disease associated with nervous
   disorders in adult honeybees leading to massive mortalities in front of
   the hives. Some of the clinical signs frequently reported, such as
   trembling, may be confused with intoxication syndromes. Therefore,
   laboratory diagnosis using real-time PCR to quantify CBPV loads is used
   to confirm disease. Clinical signs of chronic paralysis are usually
   associated with viral loads higher than 108 copies of CBPV genome copies
   per bee (8 log(10) CBPV/bee). This threshold is used by the European
   Union Reference Laboratory for Bee Health to diagnose the disease. In
   2015, the accuracy of measurements of three CBPV loads (5, 8 and 9
   log(10) CBPV/bee) was assessed through an inter-laboratory study.
   Twenty-one participants, including 16 European National Reference
   Laboratories, received 13 homogenates of CBPV-infected bees adjusted to
   the three loads. Participants were requested to use the method usually
   employed for routine diagnosis. The quantitative results (n = 270) were
   analysed according to international standards NF ISO 13528 (2015) and NF
   ISO 5725-2 (1994). The standard deviations of measurement
   reproducibility (S-R) were 0.83, 1.06 and 1.16 at viral loads 5, 8 and 9
   log(10) CBPV/bee, respectively. The inter-laboratory confidence of viral
   quantification (+/- 1.96 S-R) at the diagnostic threshold (8 log(10)
   CBPV/bee) was +/- 2.08 log(10) CBPV/bee. These results highlight the
   need to take into account the confidence of measurements in
   epidemiological studies using results from different laboratories.
   Considering this confidence, viral loads over 6 log(10) CBPV/bee may be
   considered to indicate probable cases of chronic paralysis.},

Abstract = {Bluetongue virus (BTV) and Epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV)
   are double-stranded RNA orbiviruses of the Reoviridae family. Bluetongue
   virus and EHDV infect domestic and wild ruminants and they are
   transmitted by biting midges of the genus Culicoides (Diptera:
   Ceratopogonidae). Since 1999, BTV outbreaks have occurred in Tunisia and
   4 serotypes, BTV2, BTV1, BTV4 and BTV3, were involved in 2000, 2006,
   2009, and 2016, respectively. Epizootic haemorrhagic disease was
   detected for the first time in Tunisia and in other Northern African
   countries in 2006. These incursions have caused considerable economic
   losses. Our study had the goal to describe diversity, distribution, and
   seasonal dynamics of Culicoides. Fourteen sampling sites were chosen
   throughout the country and 2-night trapping of midges was performed
   monthly from June 2006 to July 2008. A total of 11,582 Culicoides
   specimens were collected from 336 light traps, comprising 25 species, of
   which 7 were identified for the first time in Tunisia, increasing to 35
   the total number of Culicoides species now reported in this country.
   Twenty-three pools of parous females belonging to the Culicoides imicola
   and Culicoides kingi were tested for detection of BTV and EHDV by
   molecular assays. Both BTV1 and BTV4 were detected in C. imicola.},

Abstract = {In this study, arsenic content in 200 cat- and dog-food samples was
   estimated by means of electro thermal atomic absorption (Z-ETA-AAS),
   after using the wet digestion method, that were imported or
   commercialised in Italy from 2007 to 2012. The maximum value of total
   arsenic (As) in the samples was 12.5 mg kg(-1). Some imported pet food
   was intercepted as a result of the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed
   (RASFF) and rejected at the border or withdrawn from the Italian market,
   because they exceeded the maximum level of arsenic content imposed in
   Italy at the time of this study (2002/32/EC). All the samples with a
   significant arsenic level were fish-based. Recently, the 2013/1275/EC
   raised the maximum level of As permitted in fish-based pet food.
   However, the analysis of As species is required (EFSA 2014) in order to
   identify correctly the different contributions of dietary exposure to
   inorganic As and to assure pet food quality.},

Abstract = {An oligonucleotide DNA microarray targeting 348 virulence factors and
   genetic markers was used in the pathotyping, serotyping and
   phylogrouping of 51 Escherichia coli strains isolated from faecal
   samples. The samples were collected from diarrhoeic 1 to 30 days old
   calves located at 14 farms in the Teheran province, Iran. Positive
   microarray signals for genes encoding the Locus of Enterocyte Effacement
   (LEE), the Type III Secretion System (TTSS), and the absence of EPEC
   adherence factor (EAF) permitted the pathotyping of 25 strains as
   atypical Enteropathogenic (aEPEC) or Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli
   (EHEC). The lack of LEE and TTSS-associated genes distinguished the
   remaining 26 strains, which were classified as Extraintestinal
   pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC). Atypical EPEC belonged to phylogroup B1 and
   possessed a LEE profile tir-1, eae(beta), espA-1, espB-3. The EHEC
   strains primarily belonged to the B1 phylogroup type-O26 and possessed
   either a LEE profile tir-1, eae(beta), espA-1, espB-3, or a B1
   type-O111, LEE tir-3, eae(gamma), espA-1, espB-2. ExPEC-typed strains
   generally harboured genes localised to the constant region of Colicin V
   plasmid (pColV), including increased serum survival factor (iss),
   complement resistance protein (traT), aerobactin operon (iucD), and the
   siderophore receptor (iroN). The microarray platform used in this study
   is well suited to accurately and rapidly type attaching and effacing E.
   coli (AEEC-types), thus providing a database for the meta-analysis of
   ExPEC-typed strains.},

Title = {Accuracy estimation of an indirect ELISA for the detection of West Nile

Abstract = {West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV), genus Flavivirus, are
   members of the Japanese encephalitis virus antigenic complex, and are
   maintained primarily in an enzootic cycle between mosquitoes and birds.
   WNV is zoonotic, and poses a threat to public health, especially in
   relation to blood transfusion. Serosurveillance of wild birds is
   suitable for early detection of WNV circulation, although concerns
   remain to be addressed as regards i) the type of test used, whether
   ELISA, virus neutralization test (VNT), plaque reduction neutralization
   test (PANT), ii) the reagents (antigens, revealing antibodies), iii) the
   different bird species involved, and iv) potential cross-reactions with
   other Flaviviruses, such as USUV. The authors developed an indirect IgG
   ELISA with pan avian specificity using EDIII protein as antigen and a
   monoclonal antibody (mAb 1A3) with broad reactivity for avian IgG. A
   total of 140 serum samples were collected from juvenile European magpies
   (Pica pica) in areas where both WNV and USUV were co-circulating. The
   samples were then tested using this in-house ELISA and VNT in parallel.
   Estimation of test accuracy was performed using different Bayesian two
   latent class models. At a cut-off set at an optical density percentage
   (OD\%) of 15, the ELISA showed a posterior median of diagnostic
   sensitivity (DSe) of 88\% (95\%PCI: 73-99\%) and a diagnostic
   specificity (DSp) of 86\% (95\%PCI: 68-99\%). At this cut-off, ELISA and
   VNT (cut-off 1/10) performances were comparable: DSe = 91\% (95\%PCI:
   79-99\%), and DSp = 77\% (95\%PCI: 59-98\%). With the cut-off increased
   to 30 OD\%, the ELISA DSe dropped to 78\% (95\%PCI: 52-99\%), and the
   DSp rose to 94\% (95\%PCI: 83-100\%). In field conditions, the cut-off
   that yields the best accuracy for the ELISA appears to correspond to 15
   OD\%. In areas where other Flaviviruses are circulating, however, it
   might be appropriate to raise the cut-off to 30 OD\% in order to achieve
   higher specificity and reduce the detection of seropositive birds
   infected by other Flaviviruses, such as USUV.},

Abstract = {An autochthonous chikungunya outbreak is ongoing near Anzio, a coastal
   town in the province of Rome. The virus isolated from one patient and
   mosquitoes lacks the A226V mutation and belongs to an East Central South
   African strain. As of 20 September, 86 cases are laboratory-confirmed.
   The outbreak proximity to the capital, its late summer occurrence, and
   diagnostic delays, are favouring transmission. Vector control, enhanced
   surveillance and restricted blood donations are being implemented in
   affected areas.},

Title = {The microbiota of water buffalo milk during mastitis},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 19},
Abstract = {The aim of this study was to define the microbiota of water buffalo milk
   during sub-clinical and clinical mastitis, as compared to healthy
   status, by using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. A
   total of 137 quarter samples were included in the experimental design:
   27 samples derived from healthy, culture negative quarters, with a
   Somatic Cell Count (SCC) of less than 200,000 cells/ml; 27 samples from
   quarters with clinical mastitis; 83 samples were collected from quarters
   with subclinical mastitis, with a SCC number greater of 200,000 cells/ml
   and/or culture positive for udder pathogens, without clinical signs of
   mastitis. Bacterial DNA was purified and the 16S rRNA genes were
   individually amplified and sequenced. Significant differences were found
   in milk samples from healthy quarters and those with sub-clinical and
   clinical mastitis. The microbiota diversity of milk from healthy
   quarters was richer as compared to samples with sub-clinical mastitis,
   whose microbiota diversity was in turn richer as compared to those from
   clinical mastitis. The core microbiota of water buffalo milk, defined as
   the asset of microorganisms shared by all healthy milk samples, includes
   15 genera, namely Micrococcus, Propionibacterium, 5-7N15, Solibacillus,
   Staphylococcus, Aerococcus, Facklamia, Trichococcus, Turicibacter,
   02d06, SMB53, Clostridium, Acinetobacter, Psychrobacter and Pseudomonas.
   Only two genera (Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas) were present in all the
   samples from sub-clinical mastitis, and no genus was shared across all
   in clinical mastitis milk samples. The presence of mastitis was found to
   be related to the change in the relative abundance of genera, such as
   Psychrobacter, whose relative abundance decreased from 16.26\% in the
   milk samples from healthy quarters to 3.2\% in clinical mastitis. Other
   genera, such as SMB53 and Solibacillus, were decreased as well.
   Discriminant analysis presents the evidence that the microbial community
   of healthy and clinical mastitis could be discriminated on the
   background of their microbiota profiles.},

Title = {Prevalence of Verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli strains isolated from
   raw beef in southern Italy},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {257},
Pages = {201-205},
Month = {SEP 18},
Abstract = {Verocytotoxin (VT)-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) are a significant
   foodborne public health hazard, where most human infections are
   associated with six serogroups (0157, 026, 0103, 0145, 0111 and 0104).
   VTEC was the fourth most commonly reported zoonosis in the EU in 2015,
   with 5901 confirmed human cases. Ruminant animals, including cattle, are
   a major reservoir of VTEC. The consumption of VTEC-contaminated
   animal-derived foodstuffs, especially undercooked ground beef, is an
   important transmission route. To the best of our knowledge, there are
   few data available on the contamination of VTEC in meat products in
   Italy. During 2015 and 2016, 250 raw meat samples were collected from
   retail markets in southern Italy (Apulia) and analysed for the
   occurrence of vtx genes (vtx1/vtx2) at the Istituto Zooprofilattico
   Sperimentale della Puglia e della Basilicata (IZS PB, Italy). In
   addition, the isolates were characterized by determining the presence of
   VTEC main virulence factors, the antimicrobial resistance profiles and
   the genetic relatedness by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The
   results have shown that 8.4\% (21/250) of the samples were positive for
   vtx genes in the preliminary screening step but VTEC strains were
   isolated from only 2\% (5/250) of overall meat analysed samples,
   including raw ground beef, beef hamburger and beef carpaccio. 5 isolates
   displayed a multi-drug resistance phenotype. All VTEC strains were
   analysed by XbaI-PFGE and dendrogram revealed 5 distinct restriction
   profiles, indicating their relatively high genetic diversity. Although
   this study demonstrates a low prevalence of VTEC in raw beef marketed in
   southern Italy, the presence of potentially pathogenic E. coli strains
   points to the need for proper hygiene during meat production to reduce
   the risk of foodbome illness and transmission of multi-drug resistant
   organisms via foods to humans.},

Title = {Influenza D in Italy: towards a better understanding of an emerging
   viral infection in swine},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Influenza D virus (IDV), a new member of the Orthomyxoviridae family,
   was first reported in 2011 in swine in Oklahoma, and consequently found
   in cattle across North America and Eurasia. To investigate the
   circulation of IDV among pigs in Italy, in the period between June 2015
   and May 2016, biomolecular and virological tests were performed on 845
   clinical samples collected from 448 pig farms affected by respiratory
   distress located in the Po Valley. Serological tests were conducted on
   3698 swine sera, including archive sera collected in 2009, as well as
   samples collected in 2015 from the same region. Viral genome was
   detected in 21 (2.3\%) samples from 9 herds (2\%), while virus was
   successfully isolated from 3 samples. Genetic analysis highlighted that
   Italian swine IDVs are closely related to the D/swine/
   Oklahoma/1334/2011 cluster. Sera collected in 2015 showed a high
   prevalence of IDV antibody titers (11.7\%), while archive sera from 2009
   showed statistically significant lower positivity rates (0.6\%). Our
   results indicate an increasing epidemiological relevance of the pathogen
   and the need for in-depth investigations towards understanding its
   pathogenesis, epidemiology and possible zoonotic potential of this
   emerging virus.},

Title = {The Degree of One Health Implementation in the West Nile Virus
   Integrated Surveillance in Northern Italy, 2016},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {West Nile virus (WNV) is endemic in the Po valley area, Northern Italy,
   and within the legal framework of the national plan for the surveillance
   of human vector-borne diseases, WNV surveillance has over time been
   implemented. The surveillance plans are based on the transdisciplinary
   and trans-sectorial collaboration between regional institutions involved
   in public, animal, and environmental health. This integrated
   surveillance targets mosquitoes, wild birds, humans, and horses and aims
   at early detecting the viral circulation and reducing the risk of
   infection in the human populations. The objective of our study was to
   assess the degree of One Health (OH) implementation (OH-ness) of the WNV
   surveillance system in three North Italian regions (Emilia-Romagna,
   Lombardy, Piedmont) in 2016, following the evaluation protocol developed
   by the Network for Evaluation of One Health (NEOH). In detail, we (i)
   described the OH initiative (drivers, outcomes) and its system
   (boundaries, aim, dimensions, actors, stakeholders) and (ii) scored
   different aspects of this initiative (i.e., OH-thinking, -planning,
   -sharing, -learning, transdisciplinarity and leadership), with values
   from 0 (=no OH approach) to 1 (=perfect OH approach). We obtained a mean
   score for each aspect evaluated. We reached high scores for OH thinking
   (0.90) and OH planning (0.89). Lower scores were attributed to OH
   sharing (0.83), transdisciplinarity and leadership (0.77), and OH
   learning (0.67), highlighting some critical issues related to
   communication and learning gaps. The strengths and weaknesses detected
   by the described quantitative evaluation will be investigated in detail
   by a qualitative evaluation (process evaluation), aiming to provide a
   basis for the development of shared recommendations to refine the
   initiative and conduct it in a more OH-oriented perspective.},

Abstract = {Aedes (Hulecoeteomyia) koreicus (Edwards) and Aedes (Stegomyia)
   albopictus (Skuse) are two invasive mosquito species well established in
   northeastern Italy, and these two species may co-occur in artificial
   larval habitats such as tires, buckets, drums, and catch basins. Because
   Ae. albopictus has been shown experimentally to be a superior competitor
   to several mosquito species, we investigated larval competition between
   Ae. koreicus and Ae. albopictus using two diet levels (low level and
   high level) and 10 Ae. albopictus: Ae. koreicus density combination
   levels (30: 0, 60: 0, 15: 15, 30: 30, 10: 20, 20: 10, 20: 40, 40: 20, 0:
   60, and 0: 30). A multivariate analysis (MANOVA) demonstrated a
   significant effect of the density combination on Ae. koreicus
   survivorship, female development time, and female wing length considered
   simultaneously in low-level diet and high-level diet treatments.
   Pairwise comparisons across low-level diet treatments showed a
   significant reduction of Ae. koreicus survivorship in 20: 10 combination
   treatments (i.e. 20 Ae. albopictus and 10 Ae. koreicus larvae) compared
   to 10: 20, 20: 40, and 30: 30 combination treatments, while no
   difference was detected for Ae. albopictus between density combination
   treatments. Furthermore, Ae. albopictus developed faster than Ae.
   koreicus regardless of diet and density combination treatments. Our
   results show weak larval competition between Ae. koreicus and Ae.
   albopictus with a slight advantage of the latter species. On the other
   hand, the presence of Ae. albopictus seems to favor the emergence of
   larger Ae. koreicus females. We suggest that factors such as habitats
   preferences or seasonal distributions may be determinant for the
   invasion success of Ae. koreicus.},

Title = {Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease impairs the cytochrome P-450-dependent

Journal = {JOURNAL OF NUTRITIONAL BIOCHEMISTRY},

Volume = {47},

Abstract = {This study aims to investigate in in vivo and in vitro models of
   nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) the enzymatic metabolism of
   alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) and its relationship to vitamin
   E-responsive genes with key role in the lipid metabolism and
   detoxification of the liver. The experimental models included mice fed a
   high-fat diet combined or not with fructose (HFD+F) and HepG2 human
   hepatocarcinoma cells treated with the lipogenic agents palmitate,
   oleate or fructose. CYP4F2 protein, a cytochrome P-450 isoform with
   proposed alpha-tocopherol omega-hydroxylase activity, decreased in HFD
   and even more in HFD+F mice liver; this finding was associated with
   increased hepatic levels of alpha-tocopherol and decreased formation of
   the corresponding long-chain metabolites alpha-13-hydroxy and
   alpha-13-carboxy chromanols. A decreased expression was also observed
   for PPAR-gamma and SREBP-1 proteins, two vitamin E-responsive genes with
   key role in lipid metabolism and CYP4F2 gene regulation. A transient
   activation of CYP4F2 gene followed by a repression response was observed
   in HepG2 cells during the exposure to increasing levels of the lipogenic
   and cytotoxic agent palmitic acid; such gene repression effect was
   further exacerbated by the co-treatment with oleic acid and
   alpha-tocopherol and was also observed for PPAR-gamma and the SREBP
   isoforms 1 and 2. Such gene response was associated with increased
   uptake and omega-hydroxylation of alpha-tocopherol, which suggests a
   minor role of CYP4F2 in the enzymatic metabolism of vitamin E in HepG2
   cells. In conclusion, the liver metabolism and gene response of
   alpha-tocopherol are impaired in experimental NAFLD. (C) 2017 Published

Abstract = {Vegetables play an important role in the human diet, and the transfer of
   toxic contaminants from the soil to plants has been little studied for
   most tree species and their edible portions. In an area affected by
   hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) contamination, in the Sacco River Valley
   (central Italy), measurements of beta- and alpha-HCH isomers were made
   on different parts of two tree species: Juglans regia and Prunus
   spinosa. Concentrations were analysed in roots, branches, leaves,
   fruits, and seeds. A spatial evaluation of the results highlighted an
   inverse association of contamination with distance from the river, which
   is the main route of transport in the environment. Results in J. regia
   showed decreasing values in this order: branches > leaves > husks >
   nutmeat. Results in P. spinosa showed decreasing values in the following
   order: branches > leaves > fruits. In J. regia, nutmeat values were all
   below limit of detection (LOD, 0.0005 mg/kg), except in one case in
   which a very low concentration of beta-HCH was found (0.006 mg/Kg),
   compliant with maximum residue limits (MRLs). The ability of J. regia to
   store large quantities of beta-HCH in wooden and leafy parts but not in
   edible kernels makes this plant a potential and precious tool in
   remediation and economical reconversion of polluted areas. It is also
   valuable for food and wood manufacturing.},

Abstract = {A study was carried out to determine the quality characteristics,
   antioxidant capacity, oxidative status, and consumer acceptability of
   chicken meat after dietary administration of a semi-solid olive cake,
   known as ``pate{''} (pOC), in broilers. pOC is an olive oil industry
   waste rich in bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols, obtained by
   mechanical extraction from destoned olives. Two hundred and ninety-seven
   22-day-old fast growing (Ross 308) female chicks were randomly assigned
   to three experimental grower-finisher diets. Each dietary group
   consisted of three replicates, each with 33 birds. The experimental
   treatments were: (1) basal control diet (C); (2) C diet supplemented
   with a low dose of pOC (82.5 g/Kg, L-pOC); and (3) C diet supplemented
   with a high dose of pOC (165.0 g/Kg, H-pOC). Chicken growth rate
   increased with increasing pOC concentration in the diet. Polyphenol
   analyses were performed through liquid-chromatography coupled to tandem
   mass spectrometry technique (LC-MS/MS). In meat of animals belonging to
   L-pOC and H-pOC groups, tyrosol and sulphate metabolites of
   hydroxytyrosol were detected. Meat quality parameters and proximate
   composition were not affected by the dietary treatment, whereas the
   antioxidant status and the oxidative stability of meat were positively
   affected, especially when the highest level of pOC was applied. These
   results demonstrate that pOC can be recommended in chicken diets to
   improve performance and meat oxidative status.},

   of OsHV-1 mu Var was approximately 205 kbp, shorter than the reference
   genotype and the overall genome organisation resembled herpes simplex
   viruses. 94.4\% similarity was observed with the OsHV-1 reference
   genotype. Large indels, including five deletions and three insertions
   were found to induce the loss and the addition of several ORFs, summed
   with codon substitutions in 64\% of genes shared with the reference
   type. This diversity raises the question of the exact origin and
   evolution of OsHV-1 mu Var.},

Abstract = {Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of
   plasmid-mediated colistin resistance genes in Escherichia coli from pigs
   affected by post-weaning diarrhoea (PWD).
   Methods: DNA samples collected from 51 E. coli isolates from Italian
   pigs affected by PWD in 20152016 were studied. Isolates were classified
   as presumptively resistant to colistin by routine susceptibility testing
   and were investigated for the presence of the mcr-1 gene of plasmid
   origin by PCR. E. coli isolates testing negative for mcr-1 were analysed
   for the presence of a novel plasmid-mediated gene, mcr-2. Isolates were
   characterised for fimbrial {[}F4 (k88), F5 (k99), F6 (987P), F18 and
   F41] and toxin (LT, STa, STb and Stx2e) determinants by PCR as well as
   for the occurrence of haemolysis by phenotypic observation.
   Susceptibility to apramycin, cefquinome, enrofloxacin, florfenicol,
   gentamicin, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT) was
   also determined by disk diffusion.
   Results: Most of the isolates showed the presence of at least one
   virulence factor, confirming their pathogenic potential. The presence of
   mcr-1 was shown in 37 (72.5\%) of the 51 isolates. All of the
   mcr-1-negative isolates tested negative for the mcr-2 gene. Moreover,
   80.4\% of the isolates were resistant to apramycin, 9.8\% to cefquinome,
   54.9\% to enrofloxacin, 52.9\% to florfenicol, 76.5\% to gentamicin,
   96.1\% to tetracycline and 78.4\% to SXT.
   Conclusions: This is the first report documenting the presence of the
   mcr-1 gene in pathogenic E. coli isolated from pigs affected by PWD in
   Italy. (C) 2017 International Society for Chemotherapy of Infection and

Abstract = {Introduction: Intentional and accidental poisoning of animals is often
   caused by readily available commercial pesticides, such as the
   molluscicide metaldehyde. A retrospective analysis of suspected
   metaldehyde poisonings between 2014 and 2016 in Italy was conducted.
   Material and Methods: Biological matrices were collected for
   toxicological analyses in the course of routine Institute activity. A
   total of 183 organs from dogs and cats and 49 pieces of bait, here
   specificall y poisoned food used to lure animals, were analysed and the
   presence of metaldehyde was confirmed by gas chromatography coupled to
   mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Results: A high content of metaldehyde was
   demonstrated in the analysed samples from dogs and cats: 50 (27.3\%)
   animals were found positive for metaldehyde intoxication together with
   17 pieces of bait. Conclusion: The study emphasised the need for the
   control of metaldehyde use by the veterinary service.},

Abstract = {The hormonal activity of the thyroid gland has an important role in
   ruminants for the modulation of metabolic variables. In this study
   changes in thyroid hormones and biochemical parameters in dairy cows
   around calving were evaluated and the critical thyroid hormones
   thresholds for predicting the risk of ketosis were estimated. Blood
   samples were collected from 82 dairy cows at 5 +/- 3 days pre-partum and
   5 +/- 3 days postpartum. Serum values of triiodothyronine (T3),
   thyroxine (T4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), non-esterifi ed fatty
   acids (NEFA), beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), insulin, glucose, Ca, Cl, Mg,
   P, K, Na, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and
   urea were evaluated. Signifi cant decrease in the levels of T3, T4 and
   TSH was found in the postpartum period. The values of T3 and T4 were
   negatively correlated with NEFA and BHB levels, and TSH values were
   negatively correlated with NEFA. A critical T3 threshold was found by
   means of ROC analysis for predicting the risk of ketosis. T3 values <
   1.23 nmol/L were associated with BHB > 1.10 mmol/L in postpartum, which
   represents the BHB threshold commonly used as the indicator of
   hyperketonaemia.
   The results confi rm that the peripartum period is accompanied by marked
   changes in circulating thyroid hormone profile that is correlated with
   lipomobilization predictors.},

Title = {Lack of viable parasites in cured `Parma Ham' (PDO), following
   experimental Toxoplasma gondii infection of pigs},

Abstract = {Twelve Large White pigs were experimentally infected with 1000
   Toxoplasma gondii oocysts/each. Serology was carried out at different
   time points post infection (p.i.) and animals were slaughtered at four
   months p.i. One of two thighs was examined for T gondii infection status
   by PCR and bioassay in mice. The other thigh was processed for Parma ham
   production. Four thighs were examined after twelve months of curing,
   four after fourteen months and four were examined after sixteen months.
   Cured hams were analyzed by PCR, bioassay and in-vitro cultivation on
   Vero cells followed by real-time PCR. Pigs seroconverted from day 21
   p.i. Bioassays were positive for all fresh thighs, but negative for
   cured hams. PCR was positive for parasite DNA from most thighs both at
   slaughter and post curing, but parasite growth was not observed
   following in vitro cultivation and real-time PCR. Results indicate that
   the curing process of Parma Ham (PDO), when carried out according to the
   Parma Ham consortium regulations, can inactivate T gondii tissue cysts.
   Results would suggest that food-borne transmission of T gondii to
   consumers from Parma ham can be excluded. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {In this work the presence of Alloxan in bread, pastry and cake bleached
   flour was investigate in order to verify possible risk for consumers
   related to the use of chemicals for flour bleaching. A selective
   UHPLC-MS/MS method has been developed and validated for the purpose.
   Alloxan is one of the possible minor side products of oxidation after
   chemical bleaching of wheat flours, when several chemical agents are
   used. One hundred and seventy-five flour samples were analyzed for
   Alloxan determination. The validation of the method was performed in
   accordance with the ISO/IEC/EN 17025 for linearity, detection limit,
   quantification limit, accuracy, precision and ruggedness determination.
   Satisfactory performances were obtained for the analyte, with a Limit of
   Detection (LOD) of 0.73 mg kg(-1), a Limit of Quantification (LOQ) of
   0.85 mg kg(-1) and recovery values between 94\% and 102\%. The present
   work report for the first time the presence of trace levels of Alloxan
   in 24\% of the analyzed samples, with mean values of 0,95 +/- 0,04 mg
   kg(-1). The presence of Alloxan was detected only in cake flour samples.
   Further studies on toxicological levels of Alloxan are needed in order
   to evaluate possible risks for consumers linked to the consumption of
   bakery products. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Effectiveness and economic assessment of routine larviciding for
   prevention of chikungunya and dengue in temperate urban settings in
   Europe},
Journal = {PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {In the last decades, several European countries where arboviral
   infections are not endemic have faced outbreaks of diseases such as
   chikungunya and dengue, initially introduced by infectious travellers
   from tropical endemic areas and then spread locally via mosquito bites.
   To keep in check the epidemiological risk, interventions targeted to
   control vector abundance can be implemented by local authorities. We
   assessed the epidemiological effectiveness and economic costs and
   benefits of routine larviciding in European towns with temperate
   climate, using a mathematical model of Aedes albopictus populations and
   viral transmission, calibrated on entomological surveillance data
   collected from ten municipalities in Northern Italy during 2014 and
   2015. We found that routine larviciding of public catch basins can limit
   both the risk of autochthonous transmission and the size of potential
   epidemics. Ideal larvicide interventions should be timed in such a way
   to cover the month of July. Optimally timed larviciding can reduce
   locally transmitted cases of chikungunya by 20\% - 33\% for a single
   application (dengue: 18-22\%) and up to 43\% - 65\% if treatment is
   repeated four times throughout the season (dengue: 31-51\%). In larger
   municipalities (> 35,000 inhabitants), the cost of comprehensive
   larviciding over the whole urban area overcomes potential health
   benefits related to preventing cases of disease, suggesting the adoption
   of more localized interventions. Small/medium sized towns with high
   mosquito abundance will likely have a positive cost-benefit balance.
   Involvement of private citizens in routine larviciding activities
   further reduces transmission risks but with disproportionate costs of
   intervention. International travels and the incidence of mosquito-borne
   diseases are increasing worldwide, exposing a growing number of European
   citizens to higher risks of potential outbreaks. Results from this study
   may support the planning and timing of interventions aimed to reduce the
   probability of autochthonous transmission as well as the nuisance for
   local populations living in temperate areas of Europe.},

Title = {A comparative study of the in vitro activity of iodopropynyl

   European dairy herds},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to assess the in vitro effect of
   iodopropynyl butylcarbamate (IPBC) and amphotericin B (AMB) on
   Prototheca zopfii genotype 2 and Prototheca blaschkeae isolates
   recovered from dairy herds of Belgium, France, Italy, Germany, and
   Poland. The combination of IPBC with AMB on Prototheca isolates and
   toxicity of IPBC to the bovine mammary epithelial cells were also
   evaluated. The in vitro activity of IPBC and AMB against 96 isolates of
   P. zopfii genotype 2 and 42 isolates of P. blaschkeae was performed.
   Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum algicidal
   concentrations (MAC) of IPBC and AMB were determined. To determine any
   synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effect of the combination of IPBC
   and AMB, 2-dimensional checkerboard combination tests were also
   performed to calculate fractional inhibitory concentrations.
   Cytotoxicity analysis of IPBC to the bovine mammary epithelial cell line
   was performed using a 3-(4,5-dimethy1-2-thiazol-2y1)-2,5diphenyl
   tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The MIC for 50 and 90\% of isolates
   (MIC50 and MIC90, respectively) for IPBC were 4 and 8 mg/L versus 0.5
   and 1 mg/L for AMB, respectively. The MIC profiles differed between P.
   zopfii genotype 2 and P. blaschkeae, with the latter species being more
   susceptible to both compounds. The MIC50 and MIC90 of IPBC were 4 and 8
   mg/L for P. zopfii genotype 2 and 1 and 2 mg/L for P. blaschkeae,
   respectively. The MIC50 and MIC90 of AMB were both 1 mg/L for P. zopfii
   genotype 2 and 0.25 and 1 mg/L for P. blaschkeae, respectively. Both
   IPBC and AMB exhibited the ability to kill Prototheca spp. The MAC for
   90\% of isolates of IPBC was twice the MIC90, whereas an 8-fold increase
   of the MIC90 was algicidal in the case of AMB. Overall, the combined use
   of IPBC and AMB exhibited an increased algicidal effect, albeit the
   fractional inhibitory concentration index showed synergistic activity
   only against 3 P. zopfii genotype 2 isolates. For all the remaining
   isolates (87.5\%), this combination produced only an additive effect.
   The MTT assay results showed both IPBC and AMB, at the concentrations
   employed in the study, to be nontoxic to the epithelial mammary gland
   cells (cell viability >90\%). Notably, only IPBC at the highest
   concentration (i.e., 8 mg/L) exerted a slight cytotoxic effect on the
   cell line tested (mean cell viability: 88.54 +/- 3.88 and 90.66 +/- 3.0,
   after 2 and 4 h of MTT treatment, respectively). The anti-Prototheca
   activity of IPBC was here demonstrated for the first time. In addition,
   the combined use of IPBC with AMR enhanced each other's effect, creating
   an additive rather than synergistic interaction. Both agents, used at
   concentrations corresponding to MIC values against Prototheca spp.,
   showed no toxic effect for the mammary epithelial cells. In conclusion,
   IPBC, used either alone or in combination with AMB, can be considered a
   promising option in the treatment armamentarium for protothecal mastitis
   in dairy cows.},

Title = {Detection of Norovirus GII.17 Kawasaki 2014 in Shellfish, Marine Water

Abstract = {Norovirus (NoV) is a major cause of non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis
   worldwide, and the variants of genotype GII.4 are currently the
   predominant human strains. Recently, a novel variant of NoV GII.17
   (GII.P17\_GII.17 NoV), termed Kawasaki 2014, has been reported as the
   cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks in Asia, replacing the pandemic
   strain GII.4 Sydney 2012. The GII.17 Kawasaki 2014 variant has also been
   reported sporadically in patients with gastroenteritis outside of Asia,
   including Italy. In this study, 384 shellfish samples were subjected to
   screening for human NoVs using real-time PCR and 259 (67.4\%) tested
   positive for Genogroup II (GII) NoV. Of these, 52 samples, selected as
   representative of different areas and sampling dates, were further
   amplified by conventional PCR targeting the capsid gene, using
   broad-range primers. Forty shellfish samples were characterized by
   amplicon sequencing as GII.4 (n = 29), GII.2 (n = 4), GII.6 (n = 2),
   GII.12 (n = 2), and GII.17 (n = 3). Sixty-eight water samples (39
   seawater samples from the corresponding shellfish production areas and
   29 water samples from nearby underwater sewage discharge points) were
   also tested using the above broad-range assay: eight NoV-positive
   samples were characterized as GII.1 (n = 3), GII.2 (n = 1), GII.4 (n =
   2), and GII.6 (n = 2). Based on full genome sequences available in
   public databases, a novel RT-PCR nested assay specific for GII.17 NoVs
   was designed and used to re-test the characterized shellfish (40) and
   water (8) samples. In this second screening, the RNA of GII.17 NoV was
   identified in 17 additional shellfish samples and in one water sample.
   Upon phylogenetic analysis, these GII.17 NoV isolates were closely
   related to the novel GII.17 Kawasaki 2014. Interestingly, our findings
   chronologically matched the emergence of the Kawasaki 2014 variant in
   the Italian population (early 2015), as reported by hospital-based NoV
   surveillance. These results, showing GII.17 NoV strains to be widespread
   in shellfish samples collected in 2015 in Italy, provide indirect
   evidence that this strain has started circulating in the Italian
   population. Notably, using a specific assay, we were able to detect many
   more samples positive for GII.17 NoV, indicating that, in food and water
   matrices, broad-range assays for NoV may grossly underestimate the
   prevalence of some, less common, NoVs. The detection of the GII.17
   strain Kawasaki 2014 in clinical, water and food samples in Italy
   highlights the need for more systematic surveillance for future disease
   control and prevention.},

Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {Introduction Although there has been a decrease in the number of cases
   of salmonellosis in the European Union, it still represents the primary
   cause of foodborne outbreaks. In Calabria region, data are lacking for
   the incidence of human non-typhoid salmonellosis as active surveillance
   has never been carried out.
   Objective To report the results of a laboratory and patient-based
   morbidity survey in Calabria to describe the incidence and distribution
   of Salmonella serovars isolated from humans, with a focus on
   antimicrobial resistance patterns.
   Methods Positive cultures from human samples were collected from every
   laboratory participating in the surveillance, with a minimum set of
   information about each isolate. A questionnaire was then administered to
   the patients by telephone interview to assess the potential risk
   exposures. Salmonella isolates underwent biochemical identification,
   molecular analysis by PCR and antimicrobial susceptibility testing by
   the disk-diffusion method.
   Results During a 2-year period, 105 strains of Salmonella spp were
   isolated from samples of patients with diarrhoea, with the highest
   isolation rate for children aged 1-5 years. The standardised rate was
   2.7 cases per 1 00 000 population. The most common Salmonella isolates
   belonged to monophasic variant of S. Typhimurium (S. 4,{[}5], 12: i:-)
   (33.3\%), followed by S. Typhimurium (21.9\%). 30.5\% of the isolates
   were susceptible to all microbial agents tested and the most common
   pan-susceptible serotype was S. Napoli (100\%). S. 4,{[}5], 12: i:-was
   resistant to ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamides and tetracyclines in
   42.9\% cases, while resistance to quinolones was seen in 14.3\% of the
   isolates.
   Conclusions The results provide evidence that an active surveillance
   system effectively enhances Salmonella notifications. The high
   prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, including resistance to
   quinolones and multiresistance, enforces the need to strengthen
   strategies of surveillance and monitoring of antimicrobial use.},

Abstract = {Usutu virus (USUV), a member of the genus Flavivirus, is known to
   circulate at low prevalence in Northern Italy, and has been reported to
   cause overt infection. USUV was first reported in Europe in 2001, but a
   retrospective study showed that it has been present in Italy at least
   since 1996. Seroprevalence data for USUV antibodies in sera are being
   collected in different European countries, showing circulation at low
   prevalence in human populations. Interestingly, two consecutive studies
   in Northern Italy indicate a possible increase in the presence of the
   virus, from 0\% to 0.23\% seroprevalence in blood donors. In this study,
   antibodies against USUV were measured in 3 consecutive blood samples
   collected from October 2014 to December 2015 from 33 forestry workers in
   the Po river valley, while samples from 200 blood donors from the same
   geographical area were tested in parallel. Neutralizing and IgG
   antibodies were found in six forestry workers (18.1\%) and in two blood
   donors (1\%). Our results indicate that USUV circulation in the examined
   area, part of a highly populated region in Northern Italy, is higher
   than expected. Healthy subjects exhibit a higher prevalence than what
   was found in a previous report in an adjoining region (0.23\%), while
   the population at risk shows a much higher prevalence value (18.1\%).},

Abstract = {Invasive alien species (IAS) are a significant and growing problem
   worldwide. In Europe, some aspects of IAS have been addressed through
   existing legal instruments, but these are far from sufficient to tackle
   the problem comprehensively. The FINS II Conference considered the
   relevance of Top 20 IAS issues (Top 10 threats and opportunities) for
   Europe determined at the 1st Freshwater Invasiveness-Networking for
   Strategy (FINS I) conference held in Ireland in 2013. Using a similar
   format of sequential group voting, threats from FINS I (lack of funding,
   of awareness and education; poor communication) and several new threats
   (lack of lead agencies, of standardized management and of common
   approach; insufficient monitoring and management on private property)
   were identified by 80 academics, applied scientists, policy makers and
   stakeholders from 14 EU and three non-EU countries (including 10 invited
   speakers) during four workshop break-out sessions (legislation remit in
   both EU/non-EU countries; best management and biosecurity practice for
   control; data management and early warning; pathways of introductions
   and citizen science). Identified opportunities include improved
   cooperation and communication, education and leadership to enhance
   public awareness and stakeholder participation, systems establishment
   for early detection, rapid response, monitoring and management of IAS
   using standardised methods of data collection, storage and usage. The
   sets of threats and opportunities identified underline the importance of
   international cooperation on IAS issues in communication, education and
   funding as priorities, as well as in standardization of legislation,
   control methods and best practise of research.},

Abstract = {The development of more sensitive diagnostic tools allowing an
   early-stage and highly efficient medical imaging of tumors remains a
   challenge. Magnetic nanoparticles seem to be the contrast agents with
   the highest potential, if properly constructed. Therefore, in this
   study, hybrid magnetic nanoarchitectures were developed using a new
   amphiphilic inulin-based graft copolymer (INU-LA-PEG-FA) as coating
   material for 10-nm spinel iron oxide (magnetite, Fe3O4)
   superparamagnetic nanoparticles (SPION). Folic acid (FA) covalently
   linked to the coating copolymer in order to be exposed onto the
   nanoparticle surface was chosen as the targeting agent because folate
   receptors are upregulated in many cancer types. Physicochemical
   characterization and in vitro biocompatibility study was then performed
   on the prepared magnetic nanoparticles. The improved targeting and
   imaging properties of the prepared FA-SPIONs were further evaluated in
   nude mice using 7-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). FA-SPIONs
   exhibited the ability to act as efficient contrast agents in
   conventional MRI, providing a potential nanoplatform not only for tumor
   diagnosis but also for cancer treatment, through the delivery of
   anticancer drug or locoregional magnetic hyperthermia.},

Title = {Detection of morbillivirus infection by RT-PCR RFLP analysis in

Abstract = {Morbillivirus genus comprises several members related to specific hosts,
   such as canine distemper virus (CDV) and cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV)
   in which the dolphin morbillivirus (DMV) is included. Both CDV and DMV
   are able to cause serious outbreak associated with high morbidity and
   mortality representing an important conservation threat for terrestrial
   and aquatic mammalian species. This paper describes a new RT-PCR RFLP
   technique based on a RT-PCR with degenerate primers targeting a 287 bp
   fragment located on the conserved N terminus of the morbillivirus NP
   gene, followed by MseI RFLP, in order both to confirm the detection of
   the virus and to distinguish DMV from CDV. Both carnivores and cetaceans
   tissues (brain, lung and lymph node) presenting evidence of
   morbillivirus infection (MI) were analyzed. RT-PCR positive samples were
   typed by RFLP analysis and then sequenced to confirm the RFLP results.
   This method was applied during the last morbillivirus cetacean die-off
   occurred in the Mediterranean basin in 2013, when there was the urgent
   need of a rapid and economic method to investigate among causes of death
   on stranded cetaceans. This new technique has proved to be a valuable,
   reliable, simple and relatively inexpensive diagnostic tool easily
   applicable also in limited-resource laboratories.},

Journal = {FOOD CHEMISTRY},

Abstract = {European Union prohibited the use of anabolic agents in food producing
   animals since 1988. An efficient control of abuses is guaranteed not
   only by highly performing analytical methods, but also by knowledge of
   metabolic pathways, kinetics of elimination and tissue distribution. To
   obtain data concerning metabolites production and accumulation in bile,
   two typical growth promoting treatments are carried out in cattle. In
   the first study, sixteen beef cattle were implanted with trenbolone
   acetate and estradiol. In the second one, three animals were implanted
   with zeranol and three were fed a diet containing zearalenone. Methods
   based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were
   developed and validated to quantify the analytes of interest. The
   results evidenced that the biliary concentrations of the marker residues
   were always higher than those determined at the same time in urine and
   liver which are the matrices generally collected within the official
   monitoring programmes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The existing European Regulation (EC n(o) 51/2013) prohibits the use of
   animals meals in feedstuffs in order to prevent Bovine Spongiform
   Encephalopathy infection and diffusion, however the legislation is
   rapidly moving towards a partial lifting of the ``feed ban{''} and the
   competent control organisms are urged to develop suitable analytical
   methods able to avoid food safety incidents related to animal origin
   products. The limitations of the official methods (i.e. light microscopy
   and Polymerase Chain Reaction) suggest exploring new analytic ways to
   get reliable results in a short time. The combination of spectroscopic
   techniques with optical microscopy allows the development of an
   individual particle method able to meet both selectivity and sensitivity
   requirements (0.1\% w/w). A spectroscopic method based on Fourier
   Transform micro-Raman spectroscopy coupled with Discriminant Analysis is
   here presented. This approach could be very useful for in-situ
   applications, such as customs inspections, since it drastically reduces
   time and costs of analysis. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Angiostrongylus vasorum in wolves in Italy: prevalence and pathological
   findings},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 11},
Abstract = {Background: Angiostrongylus vasorum is a nematode residing in the heart
   and pulmonary vessels of dogs and wild carnivores. In Europe the red fox
   is its reservoir, while only three records from wolves have been
   published. Angiostrongylus vasorum has a worldwide distribution, and
   many pieces of evidence demonstrate that it is spreading from endemic
   areas to new ones. In Italy, A. vasorum was reported with increasing
   frequency in dogs and foxes in the last decades, and now it is
   considered endemic throughout the country. Angiostrongylus vasorum can
   be asymptomatic or cause respiratory and circulatory disorders, at times
   causing severe disseminated infections.
   Methods: Between February 2012 and December 2016, 25 wolves found dead
   in central Italy were submitted to the Istituto Zooprofilattico del
   Lazio e della Toscana for post-mortem examination. Samples of lungs,
   heart, liver, spleen, kidneys, mediastinic lymph nodes and brain were
   collected from each animal for histological examination. When adult and
   larval nematodes were microscopically seen in lungs, the other organs
   were processed, and five histological sections for each organ were
   examined. To confirm parasite identification, lung samples were
   submitted to a PCR-sequencing protocol targeting the ITS2 region of A.
   vasorum.
   Results: Seven wolves (28.0\%) harboured nematode larvae in lung
   sections. In two of the positive wolves, adult nematodes were visible in
   pulmonary arteries, in four animals larvae were also detected in other
   organs. DNA sequencing reactions confirmed parasite identification as A.
   vasorum in all the cases.
   Conclusions: As a result of the high prevalence of A. vasorum reported
   in wolves in the present study, a focus of high circulation could be

Abstract = {There is epidemiological evidence that H. pylori might predispose to
   Alzheimer's disease. To understand the cellular processes potentially
   linking such unrelated events, we incubated the human gastric cells
   MNK-28 with the H. pylori peptide Hp(2-20). We then monitored the
   activated genes by global gene expression. The peptide modulated 77
   genes, of which 65 are listed in the AlzBase database and include the
   hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease: APP, APOE, PSEN1, and PSEN2. A large
   fraction of modulated genes (30 out of 77) belong to the inflammation
   pathway. Remarkably, the pathways dis-regulated in Alzheimer's and
   Leasch-Nyhan diseases result dis-regulated also in this study. The
   unsuspected links between such different diseases - though still
   awaiting formal validation - suggest new directions for the study of
   neurological diseases.},

Abstract = {In this study samples of feedstuffs were collected from different feed
   mills and animal farms located in central Italy and analyzed for
   ionophore coccidiostat residues at carry-over levels by liquid
   chromatography-mass spectrometry. Since unavoidable cross-contamination
   of feedstuffs may occur during their production as well as distribution
   and storage, the collection of samples covered all these different
   stages. Residues of lasalocid, monensin, salinomycin and maduramicin
   were detected in 32.4\% of samples, both at production and storage
   level. The maximum content for unavoidable carry-over set by Regulation
   (EU) No 574/2011 was exceeded in 11.3\% of samples. The variability of
   the results highlighted the different approach of each investigated feed
   business operator to avoid any cross-contamination in non-target feed.
   The method developed in this study can be able to detect ionophore
   coccidiostats at low concentrations consequent to carry-over.},

Title = {Genomic signatures of adaptive introgression from European mouflon into
   domestic sheep},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {Mouflon (Ovis aries musimon) became extinct from mainland Europe after
   the Neolithic, but remnant populations from the Mediterranean islands of
   Corsica and Sardinia have been used for reintroductions across Europe
   since the 19(th)-century. Mouflon x sheep hybrids are larger-bodied than
   mouflon, potentially showing increased male reproductive success, but
   little is known about genomic levels of admixture, or about the adaptive
   significance of introgression between resident mouflon and local sheep
   breeds. Here we analysed Ovine medium-density SNP array genotypes of 92
   mouflon from six geographic regions, along with data from 330
   individuals of 16 domestic sheep breeds. We found lower levels of
   genetic diversity in mouflon than in domestic sheep, consistent with
   past bottlenecks in mouflon. Introgression signals were bidirectional
   and affected most mouflon and sheep populations, being strongest in one
   Sardinian mouflon population. Developing and using a novel approach to
   identify chromosomal regions with consistent introgression signals, we
   infer adaptive introgression from mouflon to domestic sheep related to
   immunity mechanisms, but not in the opposite direction. Further, we
   infer that Soay and Sarda sheep carry introgressed mouflon alleles
   involved in bitter taste perception and/or innate immunity. Our results
   illustrate the potential for adaptive introgression even among recently
   diverged populations.},

Title = {Swine enteric colibacillosis: diagnosis, therapy and antimicrobial
   resistance},
Journal = {PORCINE HEALTH MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {3},
Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {Intestinal infection with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is an
   important disease in swine resulting in significant economic losses.
   Knowledge about the epidemiology, the diagnostic approach and methods of
   control are of fundamental importance to tackle the disease. The ETEC
   causing neonatal colibacillosis mostly carry the fimbriae F4 (k88), F5
   (k99), F6 (987P) or F41, while the ETEC of post-weaning diarrhoea carry
   the fimbriae F4 (k88) and F18. These fimbriae adhere to specific
   receptors on porcine intestinal brush border epithelial cells
   (enterocytes), starting the process of enteric infection. After this
   colonization, the bacteria produce one or more enterotoxins inducing
   diarrhoea, such as the heat stable toxin a (STa), the heat stable toxin
   b (STb), and the heat labile toxin (LT). A role in the pathogenesis of
   the disease was demonstrated for these toxins. The diagnosis of enteric
   colibacillosis is based on the isolation and quantification of the
   pathogenic E. coli coupled with the demonstration by PCR of the genes
   encoding for virulence factors (fimbriae and toxins). The diagnostic
   approach to enteric colibacillosis must consider the differential
   diagnosis and the potential different causes that can be involved in the
   outbreak. Among the different methods of control of colibacillosis, the
   use of antimicrobials is widely practiced and antibiotics are used in
   two main ways: as prophylactic or metaphylactic treatment to prevent
   disease and for therapeutic purposes to treat diseased pigs.
   An accurate diagnosis of enteric colibacillosis needs an appropriate
   sampling for the isolation and quantification of the ETEC responsible
   for the outbreak by using semi-quantitative bacteriology. Definitive
   diagnosis is based on the presence of characteristic lesions and results
   of bacteriology along with confirmation of appropriate virulence factors
   to identify the isolated E. coli. It is important to confirm the
   diagnosis and to perform antimicrobial sensitivity tests because
   antimicrobial sensitivity varies greatly among E. coli isolates. Growing
   concern on the increase of antimicrobial resistance force a more
   rational use of antibiotics and this can be achieved through a correct
   understanding of the issues related to antibiotic therapy and to the use
   of antibiotics by both practitioners and farmers.},

Abstract = {A fast, easy, and cheap method for the simultaneous determination and
   quantification of aflatoxins (B1, B2, G1, G2), T-2 and HT-2 toxins, and
   fumonisins (B1, B2) in cereal-derived products was developed. This
   method involved a quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe
   (QuEChERS) extraction coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass
   spectrometry. The method validation was performed by analyzing samples
   spiked at four levels, and the recoveries ranged from 83.6 to 102.9\%,
   whereas the maximum values of repeatability and within-laboratory
   reproducibility were 14.3 and 15.7\% following the performance criteria
   set by the European legislation. The method was then applied for the
   analysis of 21 cereal-derived products purchased on the Italian market,
   which were correctly packaged and labeled as intended for human
   consumption. The co-occurrence of more than one mycotoxin in the
   analyzed samples could represent a risk for consumers, and the described
   method could be a valid alternative for their simultaneous detection in
   the framework of official control.},

Title = {Comparison of semi-automated commercial rep-PCR fingerprinting,

Abstract = {Purpose. Highly discriminatory genotyping strategies are essential in
   molecular epidemiological studies of tuberculosis. In this study we
   evaluated, for the first time, the efficacy of the repetitive
   sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) DiversiLab Mycobacterium typing kit over
   spoligotyping, 12-locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive
   unit-variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing and embB single
   nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis for Mycobacterium bovis typing.
   Methodology. A total of 49 M. bovis animal isolates were used. DNA was
   extracted and genomic DNA was amplified using the DiversiLab
   Mycobacterium typing kit. The amplified fragments were separated and
   detected using a microfluidics chip with Agilent 2100. The resulting
   rep-PCR-based DNA fingerprints were uploaded to and analysed using
   web-based DiversiLab software through Pearson's correlation coefficient.
   Results. Rep-PCR DiversiLab grouped M. bovis isolates into ten different
   clusters. Most isolates sharing identical spoligotype, MIRU-VNTR profile
   or embB gene polymorphism were grouped into different rep-PCR clusters.
   Rep-PCR DiversiLab displayed greater discriminatory power than
   spoligotyping and embB SNP analysis but a lower resolution power than
   the 12-locus MIRU-VNTR analysis. MIRU-VNTR confirmed that it is superior
   to the other PCR-based methods tested here.
   Conclusion. In combination with spoligotyping and 12-locus MIRU-VNTR
   analysis, rep-PCR improved the discriminatory power for M. bovis typing.},

Title = {Biofilm formation and virulence factor analysis of Staphylococcus aureus
   isolates collected from ovine mastitis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {123},
Number = {2},
Pages = {372-379},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {AimsTo perform a phenotypic and genotypic characterization of 258
   Staphylococcus aureus isolates from clinical ovine mastitis and used for
   the preparation of inactivated autogenous vaccines.
   Methods and ResultsThe potential for biofilm production was determined
   by phenotypic test of Congo Red Agar (CRA) and by PCR for the detection
   of icaA/D genes. Isolates were also screened by PCR for the presence of
   enterotoxins (sea, seb, sec, sed and see), toxic shock syndrome toxin
   (tsst), leukotoxins (lukD-E, lukM and lukPV83), haemolysins (hly- and
   hly-), autolysin (atlA) genes and encoding microbial surface components
   recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMMs: clfA, clfB, fnbA, fnbB,
   bbp, cna, eno, fib, epbs, sdrC, sdrD and SdrE). None of the 258 isolates
   showed biofilm-forming ability on CRA and harboured icaA/D genes. The
   most frequent pyrogenic toxin superantigen genes amplified were sec plus
   tsst-1, which were found strictly in combination with 71<bold></bold>3\%
   of the Staph.aureus isolates tested. None of the isolates harboured the
   genes encoding sea and see. Of the 258 isolates tested, 159
   (61<bold></bold>6\%) possessed all lukD-E/lukM/lukPV83 genes, 123
   (47<bold></bold>7\%) harboured both hly-/hly- genes, whereas almost all
   (97<bold></bold>3\%) were PCR positive for atlA gene. With respect to
   adhesion determinants, 179 (69<bold></bold>4\%) isolates presented
   simultaneously four genes (fnbA, fib, clfA and clfB) for fibronectin-
   and fibrinogen-binding proteins.
   ConclusionsIn this search, several putative virulence determinants have
   been identified in ovine Staph.aureus isolates collected in Sardinia.
   Significance and Impact of the StudySome of the putative virulence
   determinants could be considered as components of a vaccine because of
   their role in ovine mastitis pathogenesis.},

Title = {New protein sources and food legislation: the case of edible insects and

Abstract = {Growing global food demand has generated a greater interest in the
   consumption of new and diversified protein sources. Novel foodstuffs
   represent a challenge for food law as they need proper safety
   assessments before obtaining market permission. The case of edible
   insects and European law is a good representation of this issue because
   a selection of food grade insect species may be available on the
   European market in the coming years. However, European legislation does
   not explicitly address edible insects. Consequently, this has left a
   grey area, allowing different interpretations of the legislation among
   Member States. The aim of this paper is to analyse the challenge of the
   safe management of edible insects in the context of the current legal
   framework. The current Novel Food legislation, as well as the
   forthcoming version of the legislation, will be analysed and discussed
   in relation to edible insects. Particular attention will be paid to the
   evolution of legislation and to the experiences of both EU and non-EU
   countries. In recent years, a number of different stakeholders have
   supported the legalization of edible insect consumption in Europe, but
   market permission is just the first step towards a new framework for a
   novel food in a regulatory context. Once admitted, edible insects
   require proper rules to assure consumers and stakeholders of their
   benefits and safety. This overview highlights the need to develop
   clearer legislation to govern the future production and consumption of
   new food in Europe, provide guarantees to producers, and achieve
   consumer protection.},

   on a DNA biochip technology that simultaneously detects 24 animal
   species. Mixtures of the animal species the kit is designed to detect
   were prepared at different concentrations and tested on raw/pasteurized,
   and heated meat and milk matrices. The LCD Array showed high specificity
   and high sensitivity and it appeared to be robust and repeatable. As
   such, it provides a useful tool for detecting common adulterants in food
   items of animal origin. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Evidence for Tunisian-Like Pestiviruses Presence in Small Ruminants in

Abstract = {The genus Pestivirus, which belongs to the Flaviviridae family, includes
   ssRNA+ viruses responsible for infectious diseases in pigs, cattle,
   sheep, goats and other domestic and wild ruminants. Like most of the RNA
   viruses, pestivirus has high genome variability with practical
   consequences on disease epidemiology, diagnosis and control. In addition
   to the officially recognized species in the genus Pestivirus, such as
   BVDV-1, BVDV-2, BDV and CSFV, other pestiviruses have been detected.
   Furthermore, most of the ruminant pestiviruses show low or absent
   species specificity observed in serological tests and are able to infect
   multiple species. Particularly, small ruminants are receptive hosts of
   the most heterogeneous group of pestiviruses. The aim of this study was
   to carry out the molecular characterization of pestiviruses isolated
   from sheep and goats in Sicily, Italy. Phylogenetic analysis of two
   viral genomic regions (a fragment of 5-UTR and the whole N-pro regions)
   revealed the presence of different pestivirus genotypes in the analysed
   goat and sheep herds. Two of five viral isolates were clustered with
   BVDV-1d viruses, a strain widespread in Italy, but never reported in
   Sicily. The other three isolates formed a distinct cluster with high
   similarity to Tunisian isolates, recently proposed as a new pestivirus
   species. This represents the first evidence for Tunisian-like pestivirus
   presence in small ruminants in Italy. Furthermore, one of the isolates
   was collected from a goat, representing the first isolation of
   Tunisian-like pestivirus from this species.},

Title = {Risky behaviours from the production to the consumption of bivalve
   molluscs: Involving stakeholders in the prioritization process based on
   consensus methods},
Journal = {FOOD CONTROL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {78},
Pages = {426-435},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The most recent data show that shellfish farming represents
   approximately 60\% of the total aquaculture production in Europe.
   Bivalves molluscs are internationally recognized as a potential vehicle
   for food borne diseases especially when consumed raw or improperly
   cooked. Bivalves are filter-feeding animals that may accumulate
   particles present in the surrounding water, including viruses and
   pathogenic microorganisms. For these reasons consumers have to be
   careful during purchasing, handling and cooking of this food. In Europe
   several regulations have been adopted to protect consumers' health.
   However in the development of new food safety strategies it is also
   crucial to find an effective approach to guide authorities' decisions on
   priorities for controlling foodborne risks. In the article a study for
   the selection and ranking of behavioural information on bivalve risks is
   reported. The ``consensus methods{''} provide a means of synthesising
   information and of harnessing the insights of experts to enable
   decisions shared and validated by the scientific community. The Delphi
   method and Nominal Group technique (NGT) were applied for their
   capability to assess the level of agreement and to develop consensus
   among participants. In the article, the NGT is presented as a way to
   involve relevant stakeholders in the ranking of risky behaviours from
   the production to the consumption of bivalve molluscs previously
   selected by scientific experts through the Delphi method. The inclusion
   of a full range of experts and stakeholders in a community participatory
   research project regarding food risk management represents an innovative
   approach in the Italian public health context, especially in the
   analysis of bivalve risks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The parasitic nematode Capillaria (C.) aerophila affects the respiratory
   system of domestic and wild animals and, albeit rarely, human beings. In
   cats the infection may be subclinical, or present as chronic bronchitis
   with various respiratory clinical signs. In Europe there is no licensed
   product for the treatment of pet capillariosis. The present study aimed
   to deliver further evidence of the efficacy and safety of a spot-on
   formulation containing moxidectin 1 \% (w/v) and imidacloprid 10 \%
   (w/v) (Advocate (R), Advantage (R) Multi, Bayer) in the treatment of C.
   aerophila infection in cats when administered once at the approved dose
   (one pipette 0.4 ml for cats weighing 1-4 kg, one pipette 0.8 ml for
   cats weighing 4-8 kg). Efficacy was tested on days 7 +/- 1 and 11 +/- 1
   following treatment on day 0 and compared to pre-treatment faecal egg
   counts on days -6 +/- 2 and -2 +/- 2. Overall, 41 cats were enrolled in
   two groups: G1, treated with Advocate (R) (n=20 cats) and G2, left
   untreated (n=21 cats). All G1 cats were negative for C. aerophila faecal
   egg output at the post-treatment evaluation (efficacy: 100 \%) while all
   G2 cats were persistently infested with an average of 195.2 EPG.
   Differences in mean EPG values were statistically significant (p<
   0.001). Of the eleven G1 cats that showed respiratory signs at
   pre-treatment enrolment, nine fully recovered after the administration
   of Advocate (R). No adverse events occurred in treated cats. This trial
   confirmed that Advocate (R) is safe and effective in the treatment of
   feline lung capillariosis in naturally infected cats.},

Abstract = {Welfare Quality (R) Protocol is a flexible, standardized and
   scientifically proven tool for welfare assessment of pigs at the time of
   slaughtering. The sampling scheme is based on defined sample sizes and
   is developed across the major slaughtering phases (unloading, lairage,
   stunning, jugulation). The protocol has been applied in 9 Italian
   abattoirs, to highlight possible margins of improvement and to define
   reference values for some important animal based indicators. In the
   unloading area, the levels of fear, slipping, lameness, space, thermal
   comfort, sick and dead animals were assessed. At lairage, space
   allowance, drinking points and level of thermal comfort were considered.
   Vocalisations were counted by means of two measurements (continuous and
   instantaneous) when pigs were moved from lairage to the stunning system.
   Stunning effectiveness by means of 4 parameters, level of skin lesions
   and signs of diseases (pneumonia, pericarditis, liver parasites) were
   evaluated in the stunning area and after slaughtering the animals,
   respectively. All abattoirs assured an overall good level of welfare; in
   particular, the prevalence of slipping ranged between 1 and 13\%,
   lameness did not exceed 2\% and carcasses with more than 10 lesions
   ranged between 2 and 10\%. Collected data are part of a larger study on
   the application of Welfare Quality protocol in 5 countries (Italy,
   Spain, Portugal, Finland and Brazil) with the ultimate aim to provide
   risk thresholds taking into account the high variability of production
   systems worldwide.},

Abstract = {Mycoplasma infections are commonly associated with respiratory diseases
   in farm animals. However, few data are currently available about the
   presence and the etiology of mycoplasma pneumonia in small ruminants in
   central Italy, a region particularly devoted to pastoralism. The present
   study aims to investigate retrospectively the causative agents of
   pneumonia in sheep and goats, a special emphasis being placed upon
   mycoplasmas. In total, respiratory pathogens were identified in 129 of
   380 carcasses (32.36\%). Mycoplasmas were detected in a high percentage
   of cases, alone (59 animals) or in combination with other pathogens (26
   animals), Mycoplasma arginini being the most frequent species. No
   evidence of mycoplasma infection was demonstrated in 44 carcasses; in
   such animals, Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida were most
   commonly isolated. Overall, our results suggest that mycoplasma
   infections can contribute to a relevant portion of respiratory diseases
   in small ruminants and support the role of Mycoplasma arginini as a
   frequent cause of pneumonia in sheep. We consider that such data are of
   value to efficiently manage the health status of animal populations.},

Abstract = {Viruses similar to human hepatitis C virus, hepaciviruses, have been
   identified in various animal species. Equine hepacivirus (EqHV) is the
   closest relative of human hepaciviruses. Although detected worldwide,
   information on EqHV epidemiology, genetic diversity and pathogenicity is
   still limited. In this study we investigated the prevalence and genetic
   diversity of EqHV in Italian equids. The RNA of EqHV was detected in
   91/1932 sera (4.7\%) whilst it was not detectable in 134 donkey sera
   screened by a TaqMan-based quantitative assay. Upon sequencing and
   phylogenetic analysis of genomic portions located in the NS5B, 5'UTR and
   NS3 genes, the Italian EqHV strains segregated into two distinct clades
   that are also co-circulating globally, without apparent geographic
   restrictions.},

Title = {RNA-Based Amplicon Sequencing Reveals Microbiota Development during
   Ripening of Artisanal versus Industrial Lard d'Arnad},
Journal = {APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {83},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Valle d'Aosta Lard d'Arnad is a protected designation of origin (PDO)
   product produced from fat of the shoulder and back of heavy pigs. Its
   manufacturing process can be very diverse, especially regarding the
   maturation temperature and the NaCl concentration used for the brine;
   thereby, the main goal of this study was to investigate the impact of
   those parameters on the microbiota developed during curing and ripening.
   Three farms producing Lard d'Arnad were selected. Two plants, reflecting
   the industrial process characterized either by low maturation
   temperature (plant A {[}10\% NaCl, 2 degrees C]) or by using a low NaCl
   concentration (plant B {[}2.5\% NaCl, 4 degrees C]), were selected,
   while the third was characterized by an artisanal process (plant C
   {[}30\% NaCl, 8 degrees C]). Lard samples were obtained at time 0 and
   after 7, 15, 30, 60, and 90 days of maturation. From each plant, 3
   independent lots were analyzed. The diversity of live microbiota was
   evaluated by using classical plate counts and amplicon target sequencing
   of small subunit (SSU) rRNA. The main taxa identified by sequencing were
   Acinetobacter johnsonii, Psychrobacter, Staphylococcus equorum,
   Staphylococcus sciuri, Pseudomonas fragi, Brochothrix, Halomonas, and
   Vibrio, and differences in their relative abundances distinguished
   samples from the individual plants. The composition of the microbiota
   was more similar among plants A and B, and it was characterized by the
   higher presence of taxa recognized as undesired bacteria in
   food-processing environments. Oligotype analysis of Halomonas and
   Acinetobacter revealed the presence of several characteristic oligotypes
   associated with A and B samples.},

Abstract = {AimsTo evaluate and compare the capabilities of multilocus sequence
   typing (MLST) and multiple locus variable number tandem repeat analysis
   (MLVA) techniques to characterize Brachyspira hyodysenteriae isolates
   and to investigate the relationship between pleuromutilin resistance and
   genetic variability.
   Methods and ResultsMLST genotyping was performed on 180 B.
   hyodysenteriae isolates, and the results were evaluated considering
   profiles from 108 other strains previously reported in the database. In
   total, 37 sequence types were obtained. The MLVA approach completely
   characterized 172 strains and grouped the isolates into 22 different
   profiles. The combination of MLST and MLVA showed a slight increase in
   the discriminatory power, identifying 33 joint profiles. An antibiotic
   resistance analysis showed a reduction in the susceptibility to
   pleuromutilins over time, and a weak association between susceptibility
   to valnemulin and inclusion in clonal complex 4.
   ConclusionMLST and MLVA are reliable methods for characterizing
   B.hyodysenteriae strains and they have comparable discriminatory power.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyThe genotyping of B. hyodysenteriae
   isolates and a database of all the genetic profiles collected during the
   diagnostic activities could support traditional epidemiological
   investigations in identifying infection sources and routes of
   transmission among herds, and in developing more effective control
   measures.},

Abstract = {With the exception of Aelurostrongylus abstrusus, feline lungworms have
   been poorly studied. Information on their distribution is patchy and
   mostly limited to case reports. In this study, the occurrence of feline
   lungworms and co-infecting gastrointestinal parasites has been
   investigated in 12 European countries (i.e. Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria,
   France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Switzerland
   and the United Kingdom). An average of 10 domestic cats, with regular
   outdoor access, was sampled each month for 12 months, and freshly passed
   faeces were collected. Stools were processed using a McMaster assay and
   a quantitative Baermann-Wetzel method. Animals positive for lungworms
   and/or gastrointestinal parasites were treated with a formulation
   containing fipronil, (S)-methoprene, eprinomectin, and praziquantel
   (Broadline (R), Merial), and re-sampled 28 days post-treatment. The
   association between lungworm infection and risk factors was analysed
   using statistical medians/means and the efficacy of the treatment
   against each lungworm species was assessed. Of 1990 cats sampled, 613
   (30.8\%) were positive for at least one parasite, while 210 (10.6\%)
   were infected by lungworms. The prevalence of lung worm infection varied
   between the sampled sites, with the highest recorded in Bulgaria
   (35.8\%) and the lowest in Switzerland (0.8\%). None of the cats from
   Austria or the United Kingdom were infected by lungworms.
   Aelurostrongylus abstrusus was the species most frequently detected
   (78.1\%), followed by Troglostrongylus brevior (19.5\%), Eucoleus
   aerophilus (14.8\%) and Oslerus rostratus (3.8\%). The overall efficacy
   of the treatment was 99\% for A. abstrusus and 100\% for T. brevior, O.
   rostratus and E. aerophilus. Data presented provide a comprehensive
   account of the diagnosis, epidemiology and treatment of feline lungworms
   in Europe, as well as of the occurrence of co-infections by
   gastrointestinal parasites. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by

Abstract = {Several studies are increasingly underlying the biological role of
   vitamin E metabolites as bioactive compounds with anti-inflammatory,
   anti-proliferative and anti-atherogenic activity. A quantitative method
   for the simultaneous determination in human plasma and serum of vitamin
   E (alpha-tocopherol, alpha-T and gamma-tocopherol, gamma-T) and its
   cytochrome P-450 metabolites: 13'-hydroxychromanol (alpha-13'-OH),
   13'-carboxychromanol (alpha-13'COOH) and carboxyethyl hydroxychromanols
   (alpha-CEHC and gamma-CEHC), was developed and validated. After
   enzymatic hydrolysis and deproteinization, the metabolites were
   extracted with a mixture of hexane/ methyl tertiary butyl ether (2/1,
   v/v). The separation was achieved by reversed phase chromatography and
   the analytes detected by a triple quadrupole mass analyser using
   electrospray ionization in positive mode (LC-MS/MS). alpha-T and gamma-T
   were extracted separately without enzymatic hydrolysis. The analytes
   were quantified with the isotopic dilution method. After an extensive
   validation study (three levels in three different occasions for a total
   of 54 experiments), the procedure was successfully applied to the
   analysis of sera of healthy volunteers (before and after supplementation
   with alpha-T) and plasma of patients affected by chronic kidney disease.
   Finally, the structures of three unknown compounds found in blood and
   related to the long chain metabolites (alpha-13'-OH and alpha-13'-COOH)
   were further investigated using liquid chromatography coupled to high
   resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS).},

Title = {Salmonella Weltevreden in integrated and non-integrated tilapia
   aquaculture systems in Guangdong, China},
Journal = {FOOD MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {65},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Integrated tilapia-pig farming, which uses manure from pigs as
   fertilizers in fish pond, is a traditional and common production system
   practised by small-scale farmers in South-east Asia. Although such
   systems may be environmentally sustainable, they also pose potential
   food safety hazards including transmission of faecal zoonotic pathogens
   and accumulation of antimicrobial and other chemical residues. This
   study aimed to determine differences in occurrence and characteristics
   of Salmonella spp. isolated from tilapiapig and non-integrated
   aquaculture systems in Guangdong province, China. A total of 77 samples
   (9 pig feed, 19 fish feed, 9 pig faeces, 20 fish mucus and 20 fish
   intestine) from 10 tilapia-pig ponds and 10 non-integrated ponds were
   analysed. Salmonella spp. was found in fish mucus (20.0\%), fish
   intestine (40.0\%) and pig faeces (11.1\%) from integrated ponds, and
   from fish mucus (40.0\%) and fish intestine (40.0\%) from non-integrated
   ponds. S. Weltevreden (76.5\%) was by far the most common serovar
   showing limited antimicrobial resistance. One pig faeces sample
   contained S. Typhimurium whereas feed samples were found free of
   Salmonella spp.. DNA fingerprinting by the PFGE method showed a clonal
   relationship of S. Weltevreden which was supported by similar
   antimicrobial resistance patterns (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim
   resistance) as well as most isolates harbouring a 147-kb sized plasmid.
   The common finding of S. Weltevreden in both tilapia production systems
   indicates that this serovar may have a different ecology and increased
   survival in aquaculture environments in comparison with other Salmonella
   serovars. Further in vivo studies of the ecology of S. Weltevreden in
   aquaculture environments are needed. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Quality Systems. A Thermodynamics-Related Interpretive Model},
Journal = {ENTROPY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {19},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In the present paper, a Quality Systems Theory is presented. Certifiable
   Quality Systems are treated and interpreted in accordance with a
   Thermodynamics-based approach. Analysis is also conducted on the
   relationship between Quality Management Systems (QMSs) and systems
   theories. A measure of entropy is proposed for QMSs, including a virtual
   document entropy and an entropy linked to processes and organisation.
   QMSs are also interpreted in light of Cybernetics, and interrelations
   between Information Theory and quality are also highlighted. A measure
   for the information content of quality documents is proposed. Such
   parameters can be used as adequacy indices for QMSs. From the discussed
   approach, suggestions for organising QMSs are also derived. Further
   interpretive thermodynamic-based criteria for QMSs are also proposed.
   The work represents the first attempt to treat quality organisational
   systems according to a thermodynamics-related approach. At this stage,
   no data are available to compare statements in the paper.},

Title = {Serological Surveillance and Direct Field Searching Reaffirm the Absence

Abstract = {African swine fever (ASF), one of the most important diseases of swine,
   has been endemic in the Italian island of Sardinia for more than
   35years. During these decades, several strategies and eradication
   efforts have been implemented in the island with limited success. Strong
   climatic and ecological similarities exist between Sardinia and one area
   of the Iberian Peninsula where Ornithodoros erraticus ticks were
   involved in the persistence of ASF from 1960 to 1995. This fact leads to
   the hypothesis that, potentially, Ornithodoros ticks could be also
   involved in the ASF cycle in Sardinia, thus accounting for some of the
   reoccurring ASF outbreaks in this island. Initial efforts aimed at
   detection of Ornithodoros ticks in Sardinia were performed during the
   1970s/1980s with no positive results. Accordingly, the absence of
   Ornithodoros ticks in Sardinia has been generally accepted. However,
   since a new and reinforced ASF eradication programme has been recently
   launched in Sardinia, it is essential to clarify the presence and role
   of these soft ticks in the epizootiology of ASF in this island. For that
   purpose, 1767 porcine serum samples collected from all around the island
   (1261 from domestic and 506 from wild boar) were analysed by ELISA for
   antibodies to salivary antigens of Ornithodoros erraticus. In addition,
   Ornithodoros ticks were directly searched in a number of pig premises
   that have suitable habitats for these ticks and were located in areas
   repeatedly affected by ASF. Only one serum sample resulted positive in
   the serological assay, and no Ornithodoros ticks were collected in none
   of the premises. These results indicate that these soft tick species are
   not involved in the epizootic cycle of ASF in Sardinia and highlight the
   importance of controlling other risk factors still present in the island
   for effectively eradicate the disease.},

Title = {Evaluation of virulence genes in Yersinia enterocolitica strains using

Journal = {FOOD MICROBIOLOGY},

Volume = {65},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Yersinia enterocolitica comprises six biotypes 1A, 1B, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
   The virulence of the strains belonging to biotypes 1B and 2-5 depends on
   the presence of both chromosomal and plasmid-borne genes. Strains
   belonging to biotype 1A do not carry the virulence plasmid pYV. However,
   they carry other virulence genes, such as ystB and hreP. The aim of this
   study was to investigate the distribution of yadA, virF, inv, ystA,
   ystB, myfA, hreP and ymoA virulence genes in Y. enterocolitica strains
   in order to select the target genes that could be used for the
   development of a probe-specific real-time PCR to determine the presence
   of Y. enterocolitica in food samples. A total of 161 Y. enterocolitica
   strains isolated in eight countries and grouped into biotypes 1A, 2
   (serotypes 03, 05 and 09), 3 (serotypes 03 and 09) and 4 (serotype 03)
   were examined for virulence genes. The most common virulence-associated
   gene in pathogenic Y. enterocolitica proved to be ystA, which can
   therefore be considered the best target gene to be amplified in order to
   evaluate the presence of pathogenic biotypes. By contrast, to identify
   Y. enterocolitica 1A strains, ystB, which codes for the enterotoxin
   YstB, can be proposed. This has been found in all non-pathogenic
   biotypes studied, but never in pathogenic biotypes. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {Objectives: The present study had a dual purpose: to obtain a
   comprehensive picture of the Italian medical practitioners' opinions,
   professional experiences, training needs and knowledge of Animal
   Assisted Interventions (AAI); and to provide a detailed description of
   the medical practitioners who are characterized by a strongly positive
   attitude towards AAI.
   Methods: An online survey addressed to Italian medical practitioners was
   carried out using a 35-items structured questionnaire. Data obtained
   from the survey were analysed through appropriate summary statistics,
   analysis of variance (ANOVA) and logistic regression analysis.
   Results: 670 medical practitioners participated in the online survey.
   Among them, 508 stated that they knew of AM. 93.7\% of these described
   themselves fully favourable towards the use of the human-animal
   relationship for therapeutic purposes, 84.4\% defined themselves as
   confident and interested in studying the theme. A positive attitude
   towards AAI was greater in females, in people between 45 and 54 years
   old, in those who are pet owners and in those who believe that
   conferences are the most suitable tool to share information on AAI.
   Conclusions: The chance of having a positive attitude towards AAI is
   higher in respondents with specific characteristics. Data collected
   could be used as a starting point to promote and implement communication
   and training activities on AAI addressed to medical practitioners.},

Abstract = {This study evaluated the vector competence of Aedes albopictus in
   transmitting USUV after oral infection under laboratory conditions. Ae.
   albopictus showed a low vector competence for USUV, although the
   positive body sample found with a very high number of viral copies at
   one week post infection indicates that a replication in the mosquito
   body can occur, and that USUV can escape the midgut barrier. Field data
   from an extensive entomological arboviruses surveillance program showed
   a relevant incidence of Ae. albopictus USUV positive pools in the period
   2009-2012 while all pools were negative from 2013 on. No conceivable
   explanation regarding this field evidence was addressed, suggesting that
   attention must be paid to the trend of development of this
   vector-pathogen association, being aware of the potential rapid
   arbovirus' adaptation to new vectors, to prevent possible new disease's
   emergence.},

Title = {Molecular Typing of Vibrio parahaemolyticus Strains Isolated from

Journal = {FOODBORNE PATHOGENS AND DISEASE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {14},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background: Vibrio parahaemolyticus is an emerging foodborne pathogen in
   the Mediterranean, usually associated with shellfish consumption. The
   increase in the number of outbreaks in Europe is primarily associated
   with the global warming of the ocean that has a great impact on the
   spread and genetic selection of waterborne pathogens. The primary role
   of Italy in Europe's mollusk production, together with the fact that
   cases of infections with V. parahaemolyticus are not always notified to
   the European community, highlighted the necessity of acquiring new
   information about the epidemiological involvement of shellfish products.
   Objective: The aim of the study was to provide useful insights into the
   first steps of the Risk Assessment associated with V. parahaemolyticus
   through the molecular characterization of isolates from commercialized
   mollusks.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 102 strains identified as V.
   parahaemolyticus were investigated as part of a larger sampling (1-year
   survey) from several shellfish species collected from the Venice lagoon
   and the North Adriatic sea. All strains were characterized by multilocus
   sequence typing and tested for the presence of virulence genes (trh and
   tdh). The study of sampling/environmental factors and epidemiological
   analyses was performed to describe the behaviors of the different
   genetic populations.
   Results: The population structure analysis highlighted three genetic
   clusters that could be subject to temperature selection during cold (<=
   15 degrees C) and warm (>16 degrees C) seasons. Moreover, other factors,
   such as molluscan species (clams/mussels), probably played a role in the
   distribution of genetic clusters. Although few strains carried the
   virulence factors (n = 6 trh +), epidemiological links with clinical
   isolates and a local dissemination of some sequence types were
   underlined.
   Conclusion: This work provides a useful background on the genotype
   spread as a first step in the Hazard Identification in light of future
   climate changes.},

Journal = {VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {207},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Gut is often a receptacle for many different pathogens in feed and/or
   the environment, such as Salmonella spp. The current knowledge about
   pathogenicity of Salmonella is restricted to few serotypes, whereas
   other important ones like S. Coeln, S. Thompson, S. Veneziana, have not
   been investigated yet in human and animal models. Therefore, the aim of
   our work was to verify the ability of widespread environmental
   Salmonella strains to penetrate and modulate innate immunity in pig
   intestinal IPEC-J2 cells.
   Our results outline the different ability of Salmonella strains to
   modulate innate immunity; the expression of the IFN-beta gene was
   increased by S. Typhimurium, S. Ablogame and S. Diarizonae 2, that also
   caused an inflammatory response in terms of Interleukin (IL)-1 beta
   and/or IL-8 gene espression. In particular, IL-8 gene expression and
   protein release were significantly modulated by 5 Salmonella strains out
   of 7. Interestingly, S. Typhimurium, S. Coeln and S. Thompson strains,
   characterized by a peculiar ability to penetrate into IPEC-J2 cells,
   up-regulated both IL-8 and TNF-alpha gene expression. Accordingly,
   blocking IL-8 was shown to decrease the penetration of S. Typhimurium.
   On the contrary, S. Diarizonae strain 1, showing lesser invasion of
   IPEC-J2 cells, down-regulated the p38-MAPK pathway, and it did not
   induce an inflammatory response. Our results confirm that IPEC-J2 cells
   are a useful model to evaluate host-gut pathogen interaction and
   indicate IL-8 and TNF-alpha as possible predictive markers of
   invasiveness of Salmonella strains in enterocytes.},

Abstract = {Glucocorticoids, used in a wide range of pathologies thank to their
   therapeutical properties, are also illegally used as growth-promoters in
   animal breeding even if the European Union regulates their use to
   protect consumers' health from the adverse effects of residues in food.
   The first aim of the study was to establish the applicability of two
   histological parameters - atrophy and cortex-medulla ratio - to detect
   glucocorticoids misuse in calves. The second aim was to concurrently
   test the potentiality of both parameters to discriminate between treated
   and untreated animals.
   One hundred and seventy-two male Friesian veal calves were raised for
   six months and divided into two groups: Group A (106 calves) was given
   dexamethasone per os for twenty days (0.4 mg/day), Group B (66 calves)
   used as control. Thymic samples were microscopically examined. Fat
   infiltration was evaluated and a degree of atrophy, ranging from 1 to 3
   (mild, moderate, severe) was attributed; thymic cortex-medulla ratio was
   calculated too.
   Fisher's exact test and a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test were performed to
   investigate the differences in thymic atrophy and cortex-medulla ratio
   between the groups.
   Results demonstrate that the thymic atrophy grading was significantly
   increased in group A (p = 0,006), whereas the cortex-medulla ratio was
   decreased (p < 0,004) when compared to group B; moreover, the parallel
   testing with fixed degree of atrophy and cortex-medulla ratio cut-off
   thresholds optimize the sensitivity (90\%) in the detection of
   glucocorticoids anabolic treatments.
   These data suggest that microscopic thymus analysis represent a valid
   tool for the screening and monitoring of glucocorticoid illicit
   treatments.},

Abstract = {The Small Hive Beetle (SHB), Aethina tumida, is an invasive pest of
   honey bee colonies that causes significant damage to the beekeeping
   sector. SHB was detected in southern Italy (EU) in 2014 and despite
   adopted eradication measures, is still present there. After three years
   of observations of SHB in Calabria (2014-2016), we provide here some
   practical tips for improving control measures. A new time-saving colony
   examination method, including the use of an internal divider reduced the
   time needed for hive inspections by 31.86 \% on average. Prioritizating
   the inspection of pollen and honey combs rather than brood combs is
   advised. Sentinel apiaries with no more than five colonies without
   supers are suggested for each beekeeping location in order to attract
   and to monitor the early appearance of SHB. The use of these methods
   will enable early detection and prompt control measures application
   before this destructive pest can spread in the region.},

Abstract = {A sample preparation method was evaluated for the determination of
   polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in mussel samples, by using
   colorimetric and electrochemical immunoassay-based screening methods.
   Herein, a rapid procedure based on QuEChERS-like extraction approach
   followed by solid phase purification was optimized for PBDE extraction
   from mussel samples. The detection limits for colorimetric and
   electrochemical immunoassays, calculated as BDE-47 equivalent
   concentration, were 0.6 ng g(-1) and 1.1 ng g(-1), respectively. Real
   mussel samples, including a Certified Reference Material (CRM), were
   analyzed. The samples were measured by colorimetric and electrochemical
   immunoassays as well as by GC-MS. In comparison to GC-MS results, 106\%
   and 102\% relative accuracy were obtained for the colorimetric and
   electrochemical immunoassays, respectively. The proposed method could be
   useful for massive environmental campaigns, being able to rapidly detect
   possible polluted seafood samples.},

Title = {Mycoplasmas: Brain invaders?},
Journal = {RESEARCH IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {113},
Pages = {56-61},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Mycoplasmas of humans and animals are usually associated with
   respiratory, autoimmune, genital and joint diseases. Human mycoplasmas
   have also been known to affect the brain. Severe central nervous system
   (CNS) diseases, such as encephalitis, have been linked to Mycoplasma
   pneumoniae and ureaplasma infections. Less well known is the sheep and
   goat pathogen, Mycoplasma agalacdae, which has been found in large
   quantities in the brain where it may be responsible for non-purulent
   encephalitis as well as ataxia in young animals. Experimental
   intra-mammary infections of sheep with this mycoplasma have resulted in
   histopathological changes in the CNS. The cattle pathogen, M. bovis, has
   been reported occasionally in the brains of calves and adult cattle
   showing a range of histopathological lesions including abscesses and
   fibrinous meningitis. Two avian pathogens, M. gallisepticum and M.
   synoviae have been isolated from the brains of poultry showing meningeal
   vasculitis and encephalitis. There have been no reported detections of
   two other avian pathogens, M. meleagridis or M. iowae in the CNS. Over
   the last few decades, mycoplasmas have been isolated from the brains of
   sea mammals dying in large numbers in the North Sea although it was
   concluded that their role may be secondary to underlying viral disease.
   Finally, evidence has been advanced that certain Spiroplasma species may
   have a role in the development of the transmissible spongiform
   encephalopathies (TSE). Invasion of the brain by mycoplasmas may be as a
   result of direct entry following damage to the inner ear as seen with M.
   bovis or across the blood brain barrier by mechanisms as yet uncertain.},

Title = {Influenza D virus infection in cattle in Italy},
Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Pages = {123-128},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Introduction - Recently a new genus of influenza virus, tentatively
   named Influenzavirus D (IDV), was detected in swine and cattle firstly
   in USA and then in China, Japan, France, Mexico and in Italy. At present
   it seems that the bovine species is the reservoir of IDV and that this
   virus plays a role in bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC). Aim -
   The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of this new
   respiratory viral infection in bovine population in Northern Italy, an
   area with high density of swine and cattle farms, by applying molecular,
   virological and serological tests on samples submitted to the laboratory
   for routine diagnostic or surveillance investigations.
   Materials and method - Between April 2014 and October 2016, 895 samples,
   744 nasal swabs and 151 lung tissues, from cattle with or without BRDC,
   were analyzed by Real-Time RT-PCR and virological methods. The samples
   originated from 574 different herds. Genetic characterization of IDV
   isolated strains was performed by NGS sequencing. A serological study,
   using HI test with the Italian isolate swine/Italy/199724/2015, was
   performed on 420 serum samples randomly selected from 42 farms located
   in Mantova province, an area where the virus was detected in several
   herds.
   Results and discussion - Fifty-eight samples (6.5\%) were found to be
   positive for IDV with RT-PCR. Among these, 48 samples were taken from
   cattle with BRDC and 10 from subjects without BRDC. IDV was identified
   in 32 outbreaks of respiratory disease, 5 in beef fattening unit and 27
   in dairy herds. These farms were located in 12 different provinces of
   Northern Italy. In 20 outbreaks (62.5\%) the IDV was the only
   respiratory virus detected, while in 12 outbreaks (37.5\%) the infection
   was mixed with other major viral respiratory pathogens (BVDV, BRSV,
   BoHV-1, PI3V, BCoV). Eleven influenza D strains were isolated and their
   genetic analysis indicated that all clustered with the first detected
   virus D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011. Serology data showed that all the
   tested farms from Mantova province were positive to IDV, with a global
   animal prevalence amounted to a value of 92.4\%.
   Conclusion - This study shows evidences of a widespread circulation of
   influenza D virus in cattle in Italy and provides some data on the
   involvement of this virus in the etiology of the bovine respiratory
   disease complex. Many other aspects concerning the field of
   epidemiology, virology and pathobiology of this new respiratory
   infection need to be investigated in the future to better delineate the
   role of Influenzavirus D in BRDC.},

   Viruses from Sardinia, Based on Analysis of p30, CD2V and I73R/I329L
   Variable Regions},

Abstract = {African swine fever virus (ASFV) is the aetiological agent of a highly
   lethal haemorrhagic disease affecting pigs that inflicts significant
   economic damage on the swine industry. ASF is present in many African
   countries, in several eastern and central European countries and in
   Sardinia (Italy). Sequence analyses of variable genomic regions have
   been extensively used for molecular epidemiological studies of ASFV
   isolates. Previous sequencing data of genes that codify for viral
   protein p54, p72 and the central variable region (CVR) within the B602L
   gene revealed that Sardinian isolates show a very low level of
   variability. To achieve a finer level of discrimination among such
   closely related viruses, in this study, we have chosen three different
   genome regions to investigate the within-genotype relationships and to
   provide a more accurate assessment of the origin of outbreaks. The
   analysis of p30 and I73R/I329L sequences obtained from ASFV collected in
   Sardinia over a 13-years period confirms a remarkable genetic stability
   in these regions. The sequence comparison of the protein encoded by the
   EP402R gene (CD2v), carried out on various strains from 1978 to 2014,
   revealed a temporal subdivision of Sardinian viruses into two subgroups:
   one group includes the historical isolates from 1978 to 1990, and the
   second one is comprised of the viruses collected from 1990 until 2014.
   These data, together with those obtained from CVR within the B602L gene
   analysis, demonstrated that the viruses circulating in Sardinia belong
   to p72 genotype I, but have undergone genetic variations in two
   different regions of the genome since 1990. We proposed the cytoplasmic
   region of CD2v protein as a new genetic marker that could be use to
   analyse ASFVs from different locations to track virus spread. Our study
   reaffirms the need to analyse other genome regions in order to improve
   the molecular characterization of ASFV.},

Abstract = {In the last few years, several imported cases of Zika virus (ZIKV)
   infection were reported in European countries. We report the first
   imported ZIKV infection case in a Croatian traveler returning from
   Brazil. The patient presented with a low-grade fever, pruritic rash,
   general weakness, myalgia, arthralgia and edema of the legs and
   recovered completely within a week. ZIKV infection was confirmed by
   detection of IgM/IgG antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   ( ELISA) and confirmed by plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT).
   ZIKV IgM antibodies cross-reacted with dengue virus (DENV), West Nile
   virus (WNV) and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) in ELISA. In
   indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), IgM cross-reactivity was found
   only with DENV-3. ZIKV IgG antibodies cross-reacted with DENV in both
   ELISA and IFA. PRNT for DENV was negative. Control serology performed on
   days 64 and 98 after disease onset showed a decline in cross-reactive
   heterologous DENV IgG antibodies compared to persistently high titer of
   homologous ZIKV IgG antibodies.},

Abstract = {Bacterial environmental and surgical site infection (SSI) surveillance
   was implemented from 2011-2016 in a UK Equine Referral Veterinary
   Hospital and identified 81 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
   (MRSA) isolates. A cluster of MRSA SSIs occurred in early 2016 with the
   isolates confirmed as ST398 by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), which
   prompted retrospective analysis of all MRSA isolates obtained from the
   environment (n = 62), SSIs (n = 13) and hand plates (n = 6) in the past
   five years. Sixty five of these isolates were typed to CC398 and a
   selection of these (n = 38) were further characterised for resistance
   and virulence genes, SCCmec and spa typing. Overall, MRSA was identified
   in 62/540 (11.5\%) of environmental samples, 6/81 of the hand-plates
   (7.4\%) and 13/208 of the SSIs (6.3\%). spa t011 was the most frequent
   (24/38) and Based Upon Repeat Pattern (BURP) analysis identified spa
   t011 as one of the two group founders of the main spa CC identified
   across the five years (spa CC011/3423). However, 3 singletons (t073,
   t786, t064) were also identified suggesting separate introductions into
   the hospital environment. This long-term MRSA surveillance study
   revealed multiple introductions of MRSA CC398 in a UK Equine Hospital,
   identifying an emerging zoonotic pathogen so far only sporadically
   recorded in the UK.},

Title = {Prevention of feline leishmaniosis with an imidacloprid 10\%/flumethrin
   4.5\% polymer matrix collar},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUL 14},
Abstract = {Background: Leishmaniosis caused by Leishmania infantum is one of the
   most important vector-borne diseases affecting animals and humans
   worldwide. Dogs are considered main reservoirs of the zoonotic forms,
   though in the last years the role of cats as reservoirs has been
   increasingly investigated. Feline leishmaniosis (FeL) occurs in endemic
   areas and no specific preventive measures have been investigated so far.
   In this study the efficacy of a 10\% imidacloprid/4.5\% flumethrin
   polymer matrix collar, licensed for tick and flea prevention, has been
   assessed against FeL in a longitudinal study on 204 privately owned cats
   from the Aeolian islands (Sicily), an area highly endemic for the
   disease. From March to May 2015 {[}Study Day 0 (SD 0)], cats negative
   for FeL were collared (G1, n = 104) or left untreated (G2, n = 100).
   Diagnosis consisted of serology and qPCR on blood and conjunctival
   swabs, which were collected at baseline (SD 0) and at the end of the
   study (SD 360). Interim clinical examinations were performed on SD 210
   (when collars were replaced in G1) and SD 270.
   Results: Of the 159 cats which completed the study, 5 in G1 and 20 in G2
   were positive for L. infantum infection, in at least one of the
   diagnostic tests leading to a yearly crude incidence of 6.3\% and 25.0\%
   in G1 and G2, respectively (P = 0.0026). This translates into an
   efficacy of the collar of 75.0\% in preventing feline Leishmania
   infection. The collar was generally well tolerated with no systemic
   adverse reactions and few local skin reactions were observed in the
   application area in four out of 104 treated cats (3.8\%).
   Conclusions: The 10\% imidacloprid/4.5\% flumethrin collar significantly
   reduced the risk of L. infantum infection in cats. To our knowledge,
   this is the first study in which a preventative strategy against feline
   Leishmania infection is assessed under natural conditions. These
   findings close a gap in veterinary medicine, in that they confirm this
   collar as a tool in reducing the risk of Leishmania infection in cats.
   Such a preventative tool could contribute to the reduction of the risk
   of the disease in animal and in human populations when included in
   integrated leishmaniosis control programmes.},

Title = {Reconstructing the recent West Nile virus lineage 2 epidemic in Europe

Abstract = {West Nile virus lineage 2 (WNV-2) was mainly confined to sub-Saharan
   Africa until the early 2000s, when it was identified for the first time
   in Central Europe causing outbreaks of human and animal infection. The
   aim of this study was to reconstruct the origin and dispersion of WNV-2
   in Central Europe and Italy on a phylodynamic and phylogeographical
   basis. To this aim, discrete and continuous space phylogeographical
   models were applied to a total of 33 newly characterised full-length
   viral genomes obtained from mosquitoes, birds and humans in Northern
   Italy in the years 2013-2015 aligned with 64 complete sequences isolated
   mainly in Europe. The European isolates segregated into two highly
   significant clades: a small one including three sequences and a large
   clade including the majority of isolates obtained in Central Europe
   since 2004. Discrete phylogeographical analysis showed that the most
   probable location of the root of the largest European clade was in
   Hungary a mean 12.78 years ago. The European clade bifurcated into two
   highly supported subclades: one including most of the Central/East
   European isolates and the other encompassing all of the isolates
   obtained in Greece. The continuous space phylogeographical analysis of
   the Italian clade showed that WNV-2 entered Italy in about 2008,
   probably by crossing the Adriatic sea and reaching a central area of the
   Po Valley. The epidemic then spread simultaneously eastward, to reach
   the region of the Po delta in 2013, and westward to the border area
   between Lombardy and Piedmont in 2014; later, the western strain changed
   direction southward, and reached the central area of the Po valley once
   again in 2015. Over a period of about seven years, the virus spread all
   over an area of northern Italy by following the Po river and its main
   tributaries.},

Abstract = {Many prokaryote species are known to have fluid genomes, with different
   strains varying markedly in accessory gene content through the combined
   action of gene loss, gene gain via lateral transfer, as well as gene
   duplication. However, the evolutionary forces determining genome
   fluidity are not yet well understood. We here for the first time
   systematically analyse the degree to which this distinctive genomic
   feature differs between bacterial species. We find that genome fluidity
   is positively correlated with synonymous nucleotide diversity of the
   core genome, a measure of effective population size Ne. No effects of
   genome size, phylogeny or homologous recombination rate on genome
   fluidity were found. Our findings are consistent with a scenario where
   accessory gene content turnover is for a large part dictated by neutral
   evolution.},

Abstract = {This work investigated bacteriophage induced starter failures in
   artisanal buffalo Mozzarella production plants in Southern Italy. Two
   hundred and ten samples of whey starter cultures were screened for
   bacteriophage infection. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
   revealed phage infection in 28.56\% of samples, all showing
   acidification problems during cheese making. Based on DNA sequences,
   bacteriophages for Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis), Lactobacillus
   delbruekii (L. delbruekii) and Streptococcus thermophilus (S.
   thermophilus) were detected. Two phages active against L. lactis, phi
   Apr-1 and phi Apr-2, were isolated and characterised. The genomes,
   approximately 31.4 kb and 31 kb for phi Apr-1 and phi Apr-2
   respectively, consisted of double-stranded linear DNA with pac-type
   system. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
   (SDS-PAGE) showed one major structural protein of approximately 32.5 kDa
   and several minor proteins. This is the first report of phage isolation
   in buffalo milk and of the use of multiplex PCR to screen and study the
   diversity of phages against Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) strains in

Abstract = {Given the growing risk of arbovirus outbreaks in Europe, there is a
   clear need to better describe the distribution of invasive mosquito
   species such as Aedes albopictus. Current challenges consist in
   simulating Ae. albopictus abundance, rather than its presence, and
   mapping its simulated abundance at a local scale to better assess the
   transmission risk of mosquito-borne pathogens and optimize mosquito
   control strategy. During 2014-2015, we sampled adult mosquitoes using 72
   BG-Sentinel traps per year in the provinces of Belluno and Trento,
   Italy. We found that the sum of Ae. albopictus females collected during
   eight trap nights from June to September was positively related to the
   mean temperature of the warmest quarter and the percentage of artificial
   areas in a 250 m buffer around the sampling locations. Maps of Ae.
   albopictus abundance simulated from the most parsimonious model in the
   study area showed the largest populations in highly artificial areas
   with the highest summer temperatures, but with a high uncertainty due to
   the variability of the trapping collections. Vector abundance maps at a
   local scale should be promoted to support stakeholders and policy-makers
   in optimizing vector surveillance and control.},

Abstract = {Cheese-making trials with ovine milk spiked with oxytetracycline (OTC)
   at maximum residue limit (MRL) level were performed to study the OTC
   distribution between whey and cheese, and assess its effect in
   cheese-making process and cheese composition. An in-house validated
   method, based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, was
   adopted to detect OTC in milk, whey and cheeses. The MRL OTC spike
   induced a delay in the pH lowering causing a higher moisture content in
   1-day OTC cheese compared with the control cheese. No effects of OTC
   were observed on the mass balance of the process, on the recovery of fat
   and protein and, in general, on physico-chemical parameters and gross
   composition of obtained cheeses. OTC was mainly recovered in the 1-day
   cheeses (61 +/- 5\%). Despite a 17 +/- 8\% OTC reduction observed during
   cheese ripening, probably due to partial degradation, remaining residues
   were not negligible and could contribute to reach the acceptable daily
   intake. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Co-circulation of two Usutu virus strains in Northern Italy between 2009

Abstract = {Usutu virus is an arbovirus closely related to West Nile virus (genus
   Flavivirus), which circulates between mosquitoes and wild birds. This
   virus has been increasingly reported in Europe, raising concerns for its
   possible pathogenic potential for wild birds and humans. This study
   reports the whole genome sequences of 15 strains of USUV, isolated
   between 2010 and 2014 from mosquitoes and wild birds in the course of
   West Nile virus surveillance in the Emilia-Romagna and Lombardy regions
   of Northern Italy. Both whole and 656 partial genome sequences, obtained
   from isolated viruses and field samples (mosquitoes and wild birds),
   were analyzed to describe the temporal and geographical spread of USUV
   in the surveyed area. The detected sequences belonged to two groups,
   with one circulating primarily in the northwestern part of the area and
   the other in the southeastern part. This pattern is likely the result of
   different routes of introduction from the North (over the Alps) and from
   the East, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis of obtained sequences
   and other European sequences demonstrated that the majority of European
   strains belonged to one main Glade, while less common strains, mainly
   from Western Europe, fell in other two Glades. This analysis strongly
   suggested an autochthonous evolution process of strains of the main
   Glade from a common ancestor with an estimated time of arrival in Europe
   at the beginning of the 1990s.
   In addition to causing mass mortality in wild birds, Usutu virus can
   infect humans and can sporadically cause disease. These factors and the
   endemization of the Usutu virus in a large area of Europe, sustained by
   the obtained data, strongly support the need to adequately survey Usutu
   virus in areas in which its circulation is detected. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {African swine fever (ASF) is one of the most important and complex
   infectious diseases affecting pigs (Sus scrofa). The disease has been
   present in Sardinia, Italy, since 1978. Factors influencing the presence
   of the disease on the island are the presence of illegally bred pigs,
   uncontrolled movements of animals, and local traditions. Implementation
   of public health programs is essential for controlling ASF. The use of
   new diagnostic techniques on both wild boar (WB) and illegally bred pigs
   would provide tools for faster and more inexpensive control of the
   disease. We evaluated a commercial serological test kit (Pen-side {[}
   PS]) for use in the field. We sampled 113 hunter-harvested WB during the
   2014-15 season, collecting blood and lung samples to conduct serological
   analyses and to screen for the ASF virus. Although the sensitivity
   (81.8\%) and specificity (95.9\%) of tests performed in the field were
   reduced compared to the same test in laboratory, they nevertheless
   allowed for rapid diagnosis and reduced unnecessary carcass destruction.
   The test, conducted in the field, was less expensive than in the
   laboratory and required less manpower. Therefore, we conclude that the
   combined use of antibody PS test and antigen PS test may be a valuable
   emergency management method during an outbreak as well as a useful tool
   for conducting regular monitoring activities as a preventive policy.},

   Various factors, including oxidative stress, where excessive productions
   of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS)

   investigated the effect of antioxidant substances derived from food such
   as fruits and vegetables; however, data on Lycopene are still rare.
   Studies on HT-29 colorectal cancer cells and on animal models have shown
   that lycopene has effects on cell proliferation and on the progression
   of the CRC by interacting with various cellular signaling pathways. This
   analysis of the literature focused on the antioxidant effect of

Abstract = {Drug addiction is a major care and safety challenge in prison context.
   Nowadays, rehabilitation and specific therapeutic programs are suggested
   to improve health and well-being of inmates during their detention time
   and to reduce substance abuse relapse after release from prison. Among
   these programs, several studies reported the benefits for inmates coming
   from animal assisted interventions. In this pilot controlled study, we
   investigated the efficacy of a dog assisted therapy program addressed to
   22 drug addicted male inmates housed in an attenuated custody institute
   in Italy. The study lasted six months, the treated group (12 inmates)
   was involved once a week for one hour in 20 dog assisted therapy
   sessions, whereas the control group (10 inmates) followed the standard
   rehabilitation program. One week before the beginning and one week after
   the end of the sessions, all inmates involved were submitted to symptom
   checklist-90-revised and Kennedy axis V. Inmates involved in the dog
   assisted therapy sessions significantly improved their social skills,
   reducing craving, anxiety and depression symptoms compared to the
   control group. Despite the limitation due to the small number of inmates
   enrolled and to the absence of follow up, we found these results
   encouraging to the use of dog assisted therapy as co-therapy in drug
   addicted inmates rehabilitation programs, and we claim the need of more
   extensive study on this subject.},

Volume = {189},

Abstract = {Cathelicidins are well-characterized antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that
   are present in significant amounts in mastitic milk. Neutrophils are
   believed to be the main producers of these AMPs, while the role of
   mammary epithelial cells (MECs) in their production and release is still
   unclear. In this work, cathelicidin production patterns were
   investigated in mammary tissues of ewes infected by Staphylococcus
   aureus, Streptococcus uberis, or Mycoplasma agalactiae, with a combined
   approach including immunohistochemistry, immune-colocalization, and
   fluorescent in situ hybridization. Our results confirm that MECs produce
   and release cathelicidins in response to different mastitis pathogens.
   As opposed to neutrophils, however, MECs do not seem to store the
   preformed protein precursor in their cytoplasm, but appear to synthesize
   and release it only upon exposure to the microorganisms. Cathelicidin
   produdtion by MECs appears to occur before leukocyte influx in the milk,
   suggesting a role for these cells in the initial response of the mammary
   epithelium to microbial infection. Once in the milk, infiltrating
   neutrophils release massive amounts of cathelicidin by degranulation and
   production of neutrophil extracellular traps, acting as the main
   contributor for cathelicidin abundance in mastitic milk. Taken together,
   our results support the active contribution of MECs to cathelicidin
   production and release, and reinforce the value of cathelicidins as
   sensitive and pathogen-independent mastitis markers.},

Abstract = {Human exposure to contaminated food is a general health concern
   worldwide; it is necessary to evaluate food safety with respect to
   contaminants present in the edible parts of major food crops. This study
   evaluated the concentrations of 17 trace elements (As, Be, Cd, Co, Cr,
   Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Sn, Ti, V, and Zn) from 51 potato
   plantations in the Campania region, inside the area known as the
   ``Triangle of Death,{''} with inductively coupled plasma mass
   spectrometry analysis. Results confirm that the potatoes collected from
   the suburban area of Naples contained concentrations of trace elements
   below the safe limits prescribed by the Food and Agriculture
   Organization of the United Nations and the World Health Organization.
   The concentrations of elements were similar to those reported for
   potatoes grown in other countries. Monitoring the content of toxic and
   potentially toxic elements is one of the most important aspects of food
   quality assurance. The environmental persistence of metals may result in
   the accumulation of significant levels of these contaminants in plants.
   They are absorbed to different extents, depending on their source, soil
   and climatic factors, plant genotype, and agrotechnical conditions,
   thereby entering the food chain and representing a risk to human health.},

Abstract = {Papillomaviruses (PVs) are small, non-enveloped DNA viruses that cause
   mucocutaneous tumours including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in man. In
   animals, evidence supports a causal role for PVs in the development of
   cutaneous and oral SCC in some species. In reptiles, three cases of
   papilloma or fibropapilloma have been associated with PV infection, but
   no association has been reported to date with SCC. Two cases of
   cutaneous epithelial tumours, multiple papillomas in a spiny-tailed
   lizard (Uromastyx acanthinura) and SCC in a Dumeril's boa (Acrantophis
   dumerili), were investigated by polymerase chain reaction. PV DNA was
   amplified from samples of both lesions. Typical microscopical features
   suggestive of PV infection (e.g. the presence of koilocytes) were
   observed in the lesions from the spiny-tailed lizard. This is the first
   report of an association between PV and SCC in reptiles. Further studies
   are needed to better clarify the role of PVs in these species and to
   characterize the PV strains involved.},

Abstract = {On August 28, 2015, a staphylococcal food poisoning outbreak occurred in
   Umbria, Italy, affecting 24 of the 42 customers who had dinner at a
   local restaurant. About 3 h after ingesting a variety of foods, the
   customers manifested gastrointestinal symptoms. Within 24 h of
   notification from the hospital emergency department, Sanitary Inspectors
   of the local Public Health Unit performed an epidemiological
   investigation. A retrospective cohort study was conducted among the
   customers. Food and environmental samples were collected. Due to the
   rapid onset of symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea), the food samples were
   analyzed for the presence of toxigenic bacteria and their toxins;
   nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from the waiters and cooks. Among
   the food tested, high levels of coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS)
   (3.4 x 10 8 CFU/g) and staphylococcal enterotoxins (2.12 ng SEA/g) were
   only detected in the Chantilly cream dessert. CPS were also detected on
   the surface of a kitchen table (10 CFU/swab), and five food handlers
   were positive for Staphylococcus aureus. In total, five enterotoxigenic
   S. aureus isolates were recovered from three food handlers, a kitchen
   surface, and the Chantilly cream dessert. These isolates were further
   characterized by biotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and
   multiplex polymerase chain reaction assays for the detection of eleven
   enterotoxin encoding genes (sea, seb, sec, sed, see, seg, seh, sei, sej,
   sep, and ser) and three genes involved in antibiotic resistance (mecA,
   mecC, and mupA). Three sea-positive strains, isolated from the dessert,
   environment, and one of the cooks, had the same pulsed-field gel
   electrophoresis profile and belonged to the human biotype, suggesting
   that the contamination causing the outbreak most likely originated from
   a food handler. Moreover, improper storage of the dessert, at room
   temperature for about 5 h, permitted microbial growth and SEA
   production. This study underlines the importance of both laboratory
   evidence and epidemiological data for outbreak investigation.},

Abstract = {Fibromyalgia is a chronic syndrome characterized by widespread
   musculoskeletal pain and an extensive array of other symptoms including
   disordered sleep, fatigue, depression and anxiety. Important factors
   involved in the pathogenic process of fibromyalgia are inflammation and
   oxidative stress, suggesting that ant-inflammatory and/or antioxidant
   supplementation might be effective in the management and modulation of
   this syndrome. Recent evidence suggests that melatonin may be suitable
   for this purpose due to its well known ant-inflammatory, antioxidant and
   analgesic effects. Thus, in the current study, the effects of the oral
   supplementation of melatonin against fibromyalgia-related skeletal
   muscle alterations were evaluated. In detail, 90 Sprague Dawley rats
   were randomly treated with reserpine, to reproduce the pathogenic
   process of fibromyalgia and thereafter they received melatonin. The
   animals treated with reserpine showed moderate alterations at hind limb
   skeletal muscles level and had difficulty in moving, together with
   significant morphological and ultrastructural alterations and expression
   of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in the gastrocnemius
   muscle. Interestingly, melatonin, dose and/or time dependently, reduced
   the difficulties in spontaneous motor activity and the musculoskeletal
   morphostructural, inflammatory, and oxidative stress alterations. This
   study suggests that melatonin in vivo may be an effective tool in the
   management of fibromyalgia-related musculoskeletal morphofunctional
   damage.},

Abstract = {Haematological analysis is an essential field of veterinary medicine
   that provides inexpensive and reliable support to determinate animal
   health. The knowledge of how different factors affect the normal mean
   values of blood parameters is key to understand and improve animal
   health. In order to investigate how captivity can affect the
   haematological profile of birds of prey, the erythrocyte count,
   haemoglobin concentration, haematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, total
   leukocytes count of 123 griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) were analysed.
   The birds were divided into 4 groups according to their life conditions:
   a control group of free-living griffons, 2 semi-captive groups held in
   an aviary for 15 and 30 days respectively, representing short-term
   captivity, and a captive group that had lived in cage for about 2 years.
   Our results showed that long-term captivity could influence haematocrit
   value and haemoglobin concentration. Furthermore, discriminant analysis
   highlighted significant separation between the captive birds on one hand
   and the control group and the semi-captive birds on the other. Instead,
   short-term captivity did not seem to affect prominently haemocytometric
   profile.},

Abstract = {West Nile virus (WNV) is an arthropod borne virus of public health
   importance. The virus is a member of the genus Flavivirus and belongs to
   the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) antigenic complex under the
   Flaviviridae family. The WNV is continuously spreading across Tunisia
   especially in the coastal and Southern area of the country. The first
   human West Nile disease (WND) epidemic in Tunisia occurred in 1997,
   since then, the quantity and the extension of spillover effects
   increased constantly. However, the existing knowledge of factors
   triggering such events continues to be rather poor. The last epidemic
   WNV human meningitis and meningoencephalitis recorded in 2012, with 86
   cases and 6 deaths, confirmed the failure of the current system in
   predicting new cases. This review, based on analysis of scientific
   papers published between 1970 and 2015, summarises the state of
   knowledge on WNV in Tunisia and highlights the existing knowledge and
   research gaps that need to be addressed.},

Title = {Proposal for a unified classification system and nomenclature of

Abstract = {Lagoviruses belong to the Caliciviridae family. They were first
   recognized as highly pathogenic viruses of the European rabbit
   (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and European brown hare (Lepus europaeus) that
   emerged in the 1970-1980s, namely, rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus
   (RHDV) and European brown hare syndrome virus (EBHSV), according to the
   host species from which they had been first detected. However, the
   diversity of lagoviruses has recently expanded to include new related
   viruses with varying pathogenicity, geographic distribution and host
   ranges. Together with the frequent recombination observed amongst
   circulating viruses, there is a clear need to establish precise
   guidelines for classifying and naming lagovirus strains. Therefore, here
   we propose a new nomenclature based on phylogenetic relationships. In
   this new nomenclature, a single species of lagovirus would be recognized
   and called Lagovirus europaeus. The species would be divided into two
   genogroups that correspond to RHDV- and EBHSV-related viruses,
   respectively. Genogroups could be subdivided into genotypes, which could
   themselves be subdivided into phylogenetically well-supported variants.
   Based on available sequences, pairwise distance cutoffs have been
   defined, but with the accumulation of new sequences these cutoffs may
   need to be revised. We propose that an international working group could
   coordinate the nomenclature of lagoviruses and any proposals for
   revision.},

Abstract = {An immunohistochemical (IHC) technique was optimised using a monoclonal
   antibody (MAb) to detect Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides (Mmm), the
   agent of Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia (CBPP), in sections of lung
   tissue. A panel of MAbs was produced and screened for Mmm specificity
   and for cross-reactivity against other mycoplasmas belonging and not
   belonging to the Mycoplasma mycoides cluster, using in parallel indirect
   ELISA (i-ELISA) and Immunoblotting (IB). Based on i-ELISA and IB
   characterization data, 1 MAb (clone 3G10E7) was selected and its highest
   affinity vs Mmm was confirmed by the Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM)
   technology. Afterwards, IHC analyses were conducted to compare MAb
   3G10E7 vs rabbit Mmm specific hyperimmune serum using lung tissue
   sections of CBPP infected and CBPP negative animals. Results suggest
   that screening of MAbs using in parallel ELISA, IB, and QCM technology
   enables to select high affinity target specific MAbs.
   Immunohistochemical results demonstrated that MAb 3G10E7 improved IHC
   performances, showing reduced background staining and no
   cross-reactivity against Mycoplasma bovis, which is responsible of
   pneumonia in cattle.},

   At first, the analysis of press releases focused on the descriptive
   demographic variables, then stylistic and editorial variables were
   considered, and finally a lexicographic analysis was performed on the
   textual variables. The texts were found to have a moderate level of
   readability due to the use of scientific and technical terms. This study
   shows the need to improve training activities to develop effective risk
   communication, especially in terms of the language used, in order to
   facilitate interactions among veterinarians, mass media, and citizens.},

   been identified in 222Q/K animals. To investigate the contribution of
   the 222K variant to PrPres formation in natural and experimental Q/K
   scrapie cases, we applied an immunoblotting method based on the use of
   two different monoclonal antibodies, F99/97.6.1 and SAF84, chosen for
   their different affinities to 222K and 222Q PrP variants. Our finding
   that PrPres seems to be formed nearly totally by the 222Q variant
   provides evidence that the 222K PrP variant confers resistance to
   conversion to PrPres formation and reinforces the view that this
   mutation has a protective role against classical scrapie in goats.},

Title = {The disease burden of human cystic echinococcosis based on HDRs from
   2001 to 2014 in Italy},
Journal = {PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background
   Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is an important neglected zoonotic parasitic
   infection belonging to the subgroup of seven Neglected Zoonotic Disease
   (NZDs) included in the World Health Organization's official list of 18
   Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). CE causes serious global human
   health concerns and leads to significant economic losses arising from
   the costs of medical treatment, morbidity, life impairments and fatality
   rates in human cases. Moreover, CE is endemic in several Italian
   Regions. The aim of this study is to perform a detailed analysis of the
   economic burden of hospitalization and treatment costs and to estimate
   the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) of CE in Italy.
   Methods and findings
   In the period from 2001 to 2014, the direct costs of 21,050 Hospital
   Discharge Records (HDRs) belonging to 12,619 patients with at least one
   CE-related diagnosis codes were analyzed in order to quantify the
   economic burden of CE. CE cases average per annum are 901 (min-max =
   480-1,583). Direct costs include expenses for hospitalizations, medical
   and surgical treatment incurred by public and private hospitals and were
   computed on an individual basis according to Italian Health Ministry
   legislation. Moreover, we estimated the DALYs for each patient. The
   Italian financial burden of CE is around (sic)53 million; the national
   average economic burden per annum is around (sic)4 million; the DALYs of
   the population from 2001 to 2014 are 223.35 annually and 5.26 DALYs per
   10(5) inhabitants.
   Conclusion
   In Italy, human CE is responsible for significant economic losses in the
   public health sector. In humans, costs associated with CE have been
   shown to have a great impact on affected individuals, their families and
   the community as a whole. This study could be used as a tool to
   prioritize and make decisions with regard to a surveillance system for
   this largely preventable yet neglected disease. It demonstrates the need
   of implementing a CE control program aimed at preventing the
   considerable economic and social losses it causes in high incidence
   areas.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to assess the occurrence of drug
   residues in the raw milk collected from individual farms and milk
   collection points during 2009-2010 in six different major regions of
   Kosovo (Prishtine, Gjilan, Mitrovice, Peje, Gjakove, Prizren). In the
   present study, a total of 1734 raw milk samples were collected, and
   qualitatively screened with two different tests, the Delvotest SP assay
   and an enzyme-linked receptor-binding assay (SNAP). Overall, 106
   (6.11\%) out of 1734 samples examined with Delvotest SP contained
   possible drug residues (5.12\% and 7.51\% of samples from 2009 and 2010,
   respectively). All suspect samples were further analyzed by three
   distinct enzyme-linked receptor-binding assays specific for beta-lactams
   (new beta-lactam test), tetracyclines (SNAP tetracycline test), and
   sulfonamides (SNAP sulfamethazine test). Only the new SNAP beta-lactam
   test detected residues in 40 out of 52 samples in 2009 and 54 out of 54
   suspect samples in 2010. A confirmatory method based on liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to confirm the presence
   of beta-lactam drug residues in samples detected by the enzyme-linked
   receptor-binding assay. Amoxicillin, penicillin G, and cloxacillin were
   the most frequently detected residues and were in a concentration range
   between 2.1 mu g/kg and 1973 mu g/kg. Seventeen of the positive samples
   exceeded the maximum residue levels for one or more beta-lactam drug.
   The highest number of positive milk samples came from the Peje Region
   (58.8\%) and Gjakove Region (23.5\%), and the lowest number of positive
   samples originated from Gjilan (5.88\%), with no positive samples
   detected in two regions, Mitrovice and Prizren. Copyright (C) 2016, Food

Abstract = {In recent years, novel Bluetongue virus (BTV) serotypes have been
   isolated and/or sequenced by researchers within the field. During
   Bluetongue surveillance activities, we identified a putative novel BTV
   serotype in healthy goats from Sardinia, Italy. RNAs purified from blood
   and serum samples were positive for BTV by a generic real time RT-PCR
   and c-ELISA, respectively, whereas genotyping and serotyping were
   unsuccessful. By NGS, the whole genome sequence was obtained from two
   blood samples (BTV-X ITL2015 strains 34200 and 33531). Overall, Seg 2 of
   BTV-X111.2015 shows the highest identity (753-75.5\% nt/77.4-78.1\% aa)
   with recently isolated BTV27s from Corsica and with the last discovered
   BTV XJ1407 from China (75.9\% nt /78.2\% aa), whereas it is less related
   with BTV-25 from Switzerland (73.0\% nt/75.0\% aa) and BTV-26 from
   Kuwait (62.0\% nt/60.5\% aa). A specific RT-qPCR targeting Seg 2 of
   BTV-X111.2015 was assessed in this study. Considering the Seg 2/VP2
   identity of BTV-X ITL2015 with BTV-25, 26, 27s and BTV XJ1407 and that
   serum of BTV-X1TL2015 infected goats failed to neutralize all tested
   extant serotypes, we propose the existence of a novel BTV serotype
   circulating in goats in Sardinia. Isolation was so far unsuccessful thus
   hampering proper antigenic characterization. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Title = {Metabolomics analysis of liver reveals profile disruption in bovines
   upon steroid treatment},
Journal = {METABOLOMICS},

Abstract = {Introduction The surveillance of illegal anabolic practices in bovine
   meat production is necessary to guarantee consumers' health. Screening
   strategies based on the recognition of indirect biological effects are
   considered by the community as promising tools to overcome some
   limitations of classical analytical methods and might therefore concur
   to ensure safer food for the consumer.
   Objectives The present work aims at characterizing the metabolic profile
   induced in liver by administration of anabolic steroids, and at
   identifying potential disturbances in the hepatic metabolism.
   Methods A total of 32 liver samples, 16 from untreated bulls and 16 from
   bulls treated with an ear implant (Revalor-XS (R)) containing trenbolone
   acetate (200 mg) and beta-estradiol (40 mg), were analyzed following a
   LC-MS-based metabolomic analysis combining RP and HILIC chromatographic
   separations. Different multivariate statistical tools were applied to
   the datasets to select common metabolites that may be considered as
   potential markers based on their significant changes in concentrations
   after administration of sexual steroids.
   Results Eight candidate markers were identified. Moreover, a subset of
   four markers was also validated by a different laboratory that performed
   the same analysis using an independent instrumental and elaboration
   platform, confirming the robustness of the results achieved.
   Conclusion This study was performed mimicking experimental conditions
   that may be used during a potential misuse practice. It is promising in
   the objective of setting up an analytical strategy to highlight sexual
   steroids abuse in livestock animals.},

Abstract = {This study reports the mosquito collections conducted in July-August
   2013 in Castiglione del Lago (Umbria Region, Italy) during the
   entomological surveillance within the West Nile national control
   program. The mosquito collections showed the noteworthy occurrence of
   Anopheles hyrcanus s.l. (n = 156; 35.8\% of the whole sample), a
   relatively rare mosquito species in Italy, with molecular analyses
   confirming that these mosquitoes belong to An. hyrcanus s.s. The same
   catching site was characterized by a relevant richness in mosquito
   species, in particular the following were found: Anopheles maculipennis
   s.l. (n = 146; 33.5\% composed by 80\% Anopheles melanoon, 13.3\%
   Anopheles maculipennis s.s. and 6.7\% Anopheles atroparvus), Culex
   pipiens s.l. (n = 116; 26.6\% composed by 90\% Cx. p. pipiens, 5\% Cx.
   p. molestus and 5\% Cx. p. pipiens/molestus), Culiseta annulata (n = 10;

Abstract = {A single-step TaqManA (R) RT-qPCR was developed for the detection of
   bovine viral diarrhea virus type 1 (BVDV-1), an important pathogen of
   cattle worldwide. The assay was based on conserved 5'UTR sequences of
   Italian BVDV-1 isolates. In order to establish a diagnostic protocol
   which simplifies sample collection and processing, the assay was tested
   on a variety of biological specimens collected from persistently
   infected calves. The samples analyzed included PBMCs, plasma, dry blood,
   ear notch and hair bulb. Time and costs required for the analysis of
   each type of specimen were compared. The RT-qPCR, whose lower limit of
   detection was 100 copies of viral RNA (1 TCID50), correctly identified
   all PI animals, irrespective of the type of specimen. The highest copy
   numbers were obtained from the RNAs extracted from PBMCs, ear notches
   and hair bulbs. Hair bulb-supernatants directly used as a template
   allowed identification of all PI animals. In conclusion, based on time
   and cost evaluation, the most effective and efficient protocol was the
   one based on the direct analysis of hair bulb-supernatants, avoiding the
   RNA extraction step.},

Title = {Comparison among the Quantification of Bacterial Pathogens by qPCR,
   dPCR, and Cultural Methods},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 28},
Abstract = {The demand for rapid methods for the quantification of pathogens is
   increasing. Among these methods, those based on nucleic acids
   amplification (quantitative PCRs) are the most widespread worldwide.
   Together with the qPCR, a new approach named digital PCR (dPCR), has
   rapidly gained importance. The aim of our study was to compare the
   results obtained using two different dPCR systems and one qPCR in the
   quantification of three different bacterial pathogens: Listeria
   monocytogenes, Francisella tularensis, and Mycobacterium avium subsp.
   paratuberculosis. For this purpose, three pre-existing qPCRs were used,
   while the same primers and probes, as well as PCR conditions, were
   transferred to two different dPCR systems: the QX200 (Bio-Rad) and the
   Quant Studio 3D (Applied Biosystems). The limits of detection and limits
   of quantification for all pathogens, and all PCR approaches applied,
   were determined using genomic pure DNAs. The quantification of unknown
   decimal suspensions of the three bacteria obtained by the three
   different PCR approaches was compared through the Linear Regression and
   Bland and Altman analyses. Our results suggest that, both dPCRs are able
   to quantify the same amount of bacteria, while the comparison among
   dPCRs and qPCRs, showed both over and under-estimation of the bacteria
   present in the unknown suspensions. Our results showed qPCR
   over-estimated the amount of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis and F.
   tularensis cells. On the contrary, qPCR, compared to QX200 dPCR,
   underestimated the amount of L. monocytogenes cells. However, the
   maximum difference among PCRs approaches was <0.5 Log(10), while
   cultural methods underestimated the number of bacteria by one to two
   Log(10) for Francisella tularensis and Mycobacterium avium subsp.
   paratuberculosis. On the other hand, cultural and PCRs methods
   quantified the same amount of bacteria for L. monocytogenes, suggesting
   for this last pathogen, PCRs approaches can be considered as a valid
   alternative to the cultural ones.},

Title = {Development of a forecasting model for brucellosis spreading in the
   Italian cattle trade network aimed to prioritise the field interventions},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 27},
Abstract = {Brucellosis caused by Brucella abortus is an important zoonosis that
   constitutes a serious hazard to public health. Prevention of human
   brucellosis depends on the control of the disease in animals. Livestock
   movement data represent a valuable source of information to understand
   the pattern of contacts between holdings, which may determine the
   inter-herds and intra-herd spread of the disease. The manuscript
   addresses the use of computational epidemic models rooted in the
   knowledge of cattle trade network to assess the probabilities of
   brucellosis spread and to design control strategies. Three different
   spread network-based models were proposed: the DFC (Disease Flow
   Centrality) model based only on temporal cattle network structure and
   unrelated to the epidemiological disease parameters; a deterministic SIR
   (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model; a stochastic SEIR
   (SusceptibleExposed- Infectious-Recovered) model in which
   epidemiological and demographic within-farm aspects were also modelled.
   Containment strategies based on farms centrality in the cattle network
   were tested and discussed. All three models started from the
   identification of the entire sub-network originated from an infected
   farm, up to the fifth order of contacts. Their performances were based
   on data collected in Sicily in the framework of the national eradication
   plan of brucellosis in 2009. Results show that the proposed methods
   improves the efficacy and efficiency of the tracing activities in
   comparison to the procedure currently adopted by the veterinary services
   in the brucellosis control, in Italy. An overall assessment shows that
   the SIR model is the most suitable for the practical needs of the
   veterinary services, being the one with the highest sensitivity and the
   shortest computation time.},

Title = {Ticks and associated pathogens in dogs from Greece},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUN 23},
Abstract = {Background: With the aim to assess the occurrence of hard ticks and the
   pathogens they may carry in dogs from Greece, ixodid specimens (n = 757)
   were collected from 310 animals living in six provinces across the Greek
   peninsula. All ticks were morphologically identified, and genomic DNA
   was extracted from 344 (45.5\%) representative specimens, according to
   their species, engorgement status and sampling area. The occurrence of
   Anaplasma spp., Ehrlichia spp., Hepatozoon spp., Rickettsia spp.,
   Babesia spp., Theileria spp. and Cercopithifilaria spp. was assessed by
   conventional and quantitative real-time PCR.
   Results: Overall, 150 dogs (48.4\%) were infested by ticks, with
   Rhipicephalus sanguineus (sensu lato) being the most prevalent (70.1\%),
   followed by Haemaphysalis parva (14.7\%), Rhipicephalus turanicus
   (11.4\%), and Haemaphysalis concinna (2.4\%). Out of 344 specimens
   molecularly examined, 41 (11.1\%) were positive for at least one
   microorganism (i.e. 5.5\% for Cercopithifilaria bainae, 2.9\% for
   Hepatozoon canis, 1.7\% for Rickettsia hoogstraalii, 1.2\% for
   Hepatozoon felis, 0.6\% for Rickettsia massiliae, 0.6\% for Theileria
   ovis, 0.3\% for Anaplasma platys and 0.3\% for Coxiella
   like-endosymbiont).
   Conclusions: The results of this study show that different tick species
   parasitize dogs in Greece, carrying a range of microorganisms
   potentially pathogenic for dogs and humans. Consequently, control
   strategies against ticks are of great importance to prevent the risk of
   tick-borne diseases. The relationship between ticks infesting dogs and
   associated microorganisms is described according to collection site and
   dog lifestyle.},

Title = {Molecular detection of vector-borne pathogens in dogs and cats from
   Qatar},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {Background: Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) have been increasingly reported
   in dogs and cats worldwide. However, no data are currently available
   regarding canine and feline VBDs in Qatar and limited information is
   available from other Persian Gulf countries.
   Methods: Blood samples from 98 client-owned animals (i.e. 64 dogs and 34
   cats) living in Doha (Qatar) were collected and the presence of genomic
   DNA of Anaplasma spp., Babesia spp., Dirofilaria spp., Ehrlichia spp.,
   Hepatozoon spp., Mycoplasma spp. and Rickettsia spp. was assessed by
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real time-PCR (rt-PCR) and sequence
   analysis.
   Results: Of the 64 dogs, 12 (18.8\%) were infected with at least one
   pathogen (i.e. 7.8\% with Mycoplasma spp., 4.7\% with Babesia vogeli,
   3.1\% with Ehrlichia canis, and 1.6\% with Anaplasma platys, Babesia
   gibsoni and Hepatozoon canis, each). One of the 12 dogs was co-infected
   with B. vogeli and E. canis. Of the 34 cats, seven (20.6\%) animals were
   infected with at least one pathogen (i.e. 5.9\% were positive for
   Mycoplasma spp., and 2.9\% for Babesia felis, B. vogeli, E. canis,
   ``Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum{''} and Mycoplasma haemofelis,
   each). No dogs or cats were positive for Dirofilaria spp. or Rickettsia
   spp.
   Conclusions: Although the sample sizes of dogs and cats herein analysed
   was moderately small, data from this study report the occurrence of A.
   platys, B. vogeli, B. gibsoni, E. canis, H. canis and Mycoplasma spp. in
   domestic dogs and of B. felis, B. vogeli, ``Candidatus M.
   haemominutum{''}, E. canis and M. haemofelis in domestic cats from
   Qatar. Further investigations along with prophylactic measures are
   strongly recommended in order to reduce the risk of dogs and cats
   acquiring VBDs in Qatar.},

Title = {Evidence of Campylobacter jejuni reduction in broilers with early
   synbiotic administration},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {251},

Month = {JUN 19},
Abstract = {C. jejuni is considered a food safety concern to both public health
   authorities and consumers since it is the leading bacterial cause of
   food-borne gastroenteritis in humans. A high incidence of C. jejuni in
   broiler flocks is often correlated to pathogen recovery in retail
   poultry meat, which is the main source of human infection. In this work
   broiler chickens were fed with a synbiotic product mixed with
   conventional feed using two different administration strategies. The
   synbiotic was formulated with the microencapsulated probiotic
   Bifidobacterium longwn PCB133 and a xylo-oligosaccharide (XOS). 1-day
   old chicks were infected with C. jejuni strain Ml (10(5) cells) and the
   synbiotic mixture was then administered starting from the first and the
   14th day of chicken life (for animal groups GrpC and GrpB respectively).
   The goal of this study was to monitor C. jejuni load at caecum level at
   different sampling time by real-time PCR, identifying the best
   administration strategy. The microbiological analysis of the caecal
   content also considered the quantification of Campylobacter spp.,
   Bifidobacterium spp. and B. iongun.
   The supplemented synbiotic was more successful in reducing C. jejuni and
   Campylobacter spp. when administered lifelong, compared to the shorter
   supplementation (GrpB). Bifidobacteriwn spp. quantification did not show
   significant differences among treatments and B. longwn PCB133 was
   detected in both supplemented groups evidencing the successful
   colonization of the strain. Moreover, the samples of the control group
   (GrpA) and GrpC were analysed with PCR-denaturing gradient gel
   electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) to compare the caecal microbial community
   profiles at the beginning and at the end of the trial. Pattern analysis
   evidenced the strong influence of the early synbiotic supplementation,
   although a physiological change in the microbial community, occurring
   during growth, could be observed. Experimental results demonstrate that
   the synbiotic approach at can be an effective strategy, combined with
   biosecurity measures, to improve the safety of poultry meat.},

Title = {Progesterone prevents epithelial-mesenchymal transition of ovine
   amniotic epithelial cells and enhances their immunomodulatory properties},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUN 19},
Abstract = {The in vitro expansion is detrimental to therapeutic applications of
   amniotic epithelial cells (AEC), an emerging source of fetal stem cells.
   This study provides molecular evidences of progesterone (P-4) role in
   preventing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in ovine AEC (oAEC).
   oAEC amplified under standard conditions spontaneously acquired
   mesenchymal properties through the up-regulation of EMT-transcription
   factors. P-4 supplementation prevented phenotype shift by inhibiting the
   EMT-inducing mechanism such as the autocrine production of TGF-beta and
   the activation of intracellular-related signaling. The effect of P-4
   still persisted for one passage after steroid removal from culture as
   well as steroid supplementation promptly reversed mesenchymal phenotype
   in oAEC which have experienced EMT during amplification. Furthermore,
   P-4 promoted an acute up-regulation of pluripotent genes whereas
   enhanced basal and LPS-induced oAEC anti-inflammatory response with an
   increase in anti-inflammatory and a decrease in pro-inflammatory

Abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis, a reemerging zoonosis in diverse ecological
   scenarios, has been reported in the autochthonous Nebrodi black pig
   breed population used for meat production in Italy. During a routine
   abattoir inspection in 2013, 24 of 299 carcasses (8\%) of Nebrodi black
   pigs presented tuberculosis-like lesions at pathologic examination.
   Mycobacterium bovis was isolated from 23 animals and M. caprae from a
   3-year-old sow. The sow showed severe diffuse lesions involving the
   visceral organs, right coxofemoral joint, and mammary glands. Isolation
   of M. caprae from mammary glands is uncommon, with only one other case
   involving a sow reported so far; however, Mycobacteria infection of the
   mammary glands may be transmitted from lactating sows to piglets,
   contributing to the spread and maintenance of bovine tuberculosis in
   swine. Genotyping analysis showed M. caprae spoligotype SB0866 and
   profile 4,1,5,4,4,11,4,2,4,3,8,7 MIRU-VNTR (mycobacterial interspersed
   repetitive units-variable number of tandem repeats). The worldwide
   prevalence of this spoligotype is very low. The finding of severe,
   diffuse tuberculous lesions strongly suggests that Nebrodi black pigs
   are susceptible for Mycobacterium spp. and that they might act as a
   distributor for these microorganisms. Since natural ecosystems with
   multiple contacts among different livestock species and wild animals are
   very common in Mediterranean regions, current surveillance and
   eradication plans for bovine tuberculosis will need to be extended to
   other potential reservoir species in regions where extensive and
   traditional breeding systems are operated.},

Title = {Antimicrobial susceptibility and genotyping of Staphylococcus aureus
   isolates collected between 1986 and 2015 from ovine mastitis},
Journal = {VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {205},

Abstract = {In this research, 330 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, collected in
   Sardinia (Italy) in the period 1986-2015 from clinical ovine mastitis
   and used for the preparation of inactivated autogenous vaccines, were
   analyzed. Susceptibility to 12 antimicrobial agents was tested by disk
   diffusion, according to CLSI recommendations. Resistance genes were
   detected by PCR assays. The most of isolates (85.2\%) were susceptible
   to all antimicrobials tested, suggesting that did not exist change of
   resistance over time. Two isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR), one
   of them (isolate 1496) showed resistance to seven antibiotics including
   oxacillin and erythromycin. This MRSA harboured SCCmec type IV and the
   erm(C) gene. Isolates were characterized by spa typing and MLST.
   Isolates belonged to 29 spa types: t1773 (n = 186), t2678 (n = 53),
   t7754 (n = 14), t1532 (n = 5), 1524 (n = 5) and t6060 (n = 4) were the
   most frequent spa types found in Sardinia. The majority of ovine
   isolates (t1773, t7754 and t1532) was grouped in MLST CC130 (n = 205)
   followed by CC133 (n = 57). MRSA 1496 was classified as t3896, ST1 and
   CC1, a clonal complex common in human and also reported in cattle and
   pig. This study suggests that the CC130/ST700/t1773 is the prevalent S.
   aureus lineage associated with ovine mastitis in Sardinia.},

Title = {Evidence of a Prototheca Zopfii Genotype 2 Disseminated Infection in a

Volume = {182},
Number = {5-6},

Abstract = {Protothecosis is a disease caused by saprophyte aerobic unicellular
   algae belonging to the genus Prototheca. In dogs, it mainly occurs as a
   disseminated form, with initial clinical manifestations often referable
   to the gastrointestinal tract, followed by typical ocular and
   neurological signs. So far, Prototheca zopfii genotype 2 infection has
   been reported in severe forms of disseminated protothecosis, while in
   dogs has never been associated with cutaneous forms. In this study, we
   describe a case of Prototheca zopfii genotype 2 infection in a dog
   characterized by nodular and ulcerative dermatitis and with evidence of
   dissemination. In December 2015, a 5-year-old unneutered male English
   Setter dog was presented with a 4-month history of footpads ulcerations
   and multifocal nodular lesions (3-5 cm diameter) on both front limbs.
   Cytological examination of the aspirated fluid collected from all
   nodules revealed the presence of sporangic forms compatible with
   Prototheca spp. organisms. Suspected Prototheca spp. colonies were
   isolated from the aspirated fluid and identified as Prototheca zopfii
   genotype 2 by molecular methods. Few days after the visit, the patient
   developed serious neurological and ocular signs, and the owners elected
   humane euthanasia. To the authors' knowledge, this case could represent
   the first report of a disseminated Prototheca zopfii genotype 2
   infection associated with cutaneous lesions in a dog. This study
   underlines the importance of considering Prototheca zopfii genotype 2
   infection in the differential etiological diagnosis of nodular and
   ulcerative dermatitis in dogs.},

Abstract = {Buccal swabbing is a minimally invasive method to obtain DNA and
   biological material from humans and animals, including fish. Reports on
   buccal swabbing in fish are few and only for a limited number of
   species. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is an important animal
   model and because the yield of DNA may vary among and within different
   species in individuals of different sizes, it was selected as useful to
   optimize the buccal DNA collection in this species. Different storage
   methods were evaluated, aimed at DNA preservation by limiting DNA
   degradation and bacterial growth, using commonly available and
   inexpensive reagents. DNA quality was also tested by amplification of a
   single-copy nuclear gene and a mitochondrial gene. The results suggest
   that ethanol is the best storage choice for buccal swab sampling in fish
   genetic studies, as well as suitable for small-bodied rainbow trout.},

Abstract = {Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), introduced into in Australia
   and New Zealand as a biological-control agent for wild rabbits, is least
   efficacious in cool humid areas where a non-pathogenic calicivirus
   (RCV-A1) also circulates. Heavy rabbit mortality following release of
   RHDV on cold sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island, where RCV-A1 was apparently
   absent, not only complemented the planned rabbit eradication operations,
   especially by reducing secondary poisoning of sea-birds from aerial
   baiting, but also ruled out cool or humid climate as a major limiting
   factor of disease spread. In turn, this has advanced the idea that
   RCV-A1 antibodies inhibit RHDV spread as well as reducing disease
   severity and mortality.},

Abstract = {An ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass
   spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method for multiclass analysis of pesticide
   and fungicide residues in wheat flour based is presented. An efficient
   and rapid cleanup based on microextraction by packed sorbent (MEPS) has
   been developed in order to have a good enrichment factor together with a
   low matrix effect. The target analytes were 25 pesticides widely used in
   wheat, with different physico-chemical characteristics and different
   mechanism of action: acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as
   organophosphorus, carbamates, neonicotinoids, and inhibitors of
   ergosterol such as imidazoles and triazoles. MEPS was shown to be
   successful with reduction of the amount of solvent required and
   possibility of automation of the cleanup procedure. The whole method was
   then validated according to the SANCO/12571/2013 guidelines, proving its
   suitability as confirmation method for the selected analytes.},

Abstract = {The aim of this work was to evaluate the critical points while using a
   TBARs test to measure the lipid oxidation in meat samples; this method
   includes a distillation method, extracting acid solutions (7\%
   trichloroacetic acid-TCA, 4\% perchloric acid-HClO4 and 4 N hydrochloric
   acid-HCl), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) concentrations and their
   interactions. The TBARs test method has been evaluated in different
   animal meat species and in different kinds of meat: fresh, stored,
   frozen and at different times of defrosting. Moreover, the influence of
   sample management was evaluated. The best results were obtained after
   using a distillation and a cold extraction with 7\% TCA. The presence of
   the antioxidant agent (BHT) was essential and was more important in
   frozen samples than in fresh meat and especially when it was added at
   negligible concentrations immediately before defrosting, within 2 min of
   sample withdrawal from the freezer. The general management of the sample
   requires careful attention, avoiding storage and/or freezing, and lean
   meat appears to be more susceptible than fatty meat to the oxidative
   process.
   Practical Applications: Optimized TBARs test, including sample
   management, may represent a line guide to its application such that the
   results of future studies can be comparable and successfully employed.},

Abstract = {Drivers and risk factors for Influenza A virus transmission across
   species barriers are poorly understood, despite the ever present threat
   to human and animal health potentially on a pandemic scale. Here we
   review the published evidence for epidemiological risk factors
   associated with influenza viruses transmitting between animal species
   and from animals to humans. A total of 39 papers were found with
   evidence of epidemiological risk factors for influenza virus
   transmission from animals to humans; 18 of which had some statistical
   measure associated with the transmission of a virus. Circumstantial or
   observational evidence of risk factors for transmission between animal
   species was found in 21 papers, including proximity to infected animals,
   ingestion of infected material and potential association with a species
   known to carry influenza virus. Only three publications were found which
   presented a statistical measure of an epidemiological risk factor for
   the transmission of influenza between animal species. This review has
   identified a significant gap in knowledge regarding epidemiological risk
   factors for the transmission of influenza viruses between animal
   species.},

Abstract = {Sulphiting agents are well-known food preservatives. The European
   legislation does not allow their addition in fresh meat preparations.
   Therefore this type of food products has often been verified. To high
   sulphite levels in food is a health safety risk, due to toxic effects
   that these compounds may exercise on humans. In this study the control
   activity as performed by an Italian accredited laboratory from 2013 to
   2015, relating to determination of sulphites in meat products, is
   described. Six hundred and sixty-nine meat product samples were
   analysed. Both applied techniques, a screening method (malachite green
   test) and a confirmatory method (ion chromatography), were accredited.
   Forty-three samples resulted positive at screening test and nineteen of
   these samples showed high-sulphite concentrations, in the range
   67.6-1437mgkg(-1). The non-negligible percentage of positives (6.4\%)
   and the high concentrations verified confirmed that the control of
   sulphuring treatment of fresh meat preparations is an important task for
   organisations in charge of food inspections and control.},

Abstract = {Shellfish are an important vehicle for transmission of food-borne
   pathogens including norovirus (NoV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV). The
   risks related with consumption of shellfish are greater if these
   products are eaten raw or slightly cooked. As molluscs are
   filter-feeding organisms, they are able to concentrate pathogens
   dispersed in the water. Data on shellfish viral contamination are
   therefore useful to obtain a background information on the presence of
   contamination in the environment, chiefly in shellfish production areas
   and to generate a picture of the epidemiology of viral pathogens in
   local populations. From January 2013 to July 2015, 253 samples of
   bivalve molluscs collected in harvesting areas from a large coastal
   tract (860 km) of Southern Italy were screened for HAV and NoV of
   genogroups GI and GII, using real-time reverse transcription qualitative
   PCR. The RNA of HAV was not detected in any of the analyzed samples. In
   contrast, the RNA of NoV was identified in 14.2\% of the samples with a
   higher prevalence of NoVs of genogroup GII (12.2\%) than genogroup GI
   (1.6\%). Upon sequence analysis of a short diagnostic region located in
   capsid region, the NoV strains were characterized as GII.2, GII.4 Sydney
   2012, GII.6, GII.13, GI.4, and GI.6, all which were circulating in local
   populations in the same time span. These data confirm that consumption
   of mussels can expose consumers to relevant risks of infection. Also,
   matching between the NoV genotypes circulating in local population and
   detected in molluscs confirms the diffusion in the environment of NoVs.},

Abstract = {Pestiviruses of cattle include bovine viral diarrhoea 1 (BVDV-1) and 2
   (BVDV-2) plus an emerging group, named HoBi-like pestivirus. In the
   present paper, the results of an epidemiological survey for pestiviruses
   circulating in cattle in southern Italy are presented. Molecular assays
   carried out on a total of 924 bovine samples detected 74 BVDV strains,
   including 73 BVDV-1 and 1 BVDV-2 viruses. Phylogenetic analysis carried
   out on partial 5'UTR and N-Pro sequences revealed the presence of 6
   different subtypes of BVDV-1 and a single BVDV-2c strain. BVDV-1
   displayed a high level of genetic heterogeneity, which can have both
   prophylactic and diagnostic implications. In addition, the detection of
   BVDV-2c highlights the need for a continuous surveillance for the
   emergence of new pestivirus strains in cattle farms in southern Italy.

Abstract = {After the H7N7 highly pathogenic (HP) avian influenza (AI) outbreak in
   2013, and a single case of H5N8 HPAI in 2014, in April 2016, a H7N7 HPAI
   virus was detected in northeastern Italy. The case occurred in an
   organic free-range laying hen farm located in proximity with one of the
   highest densely populated poultry areas (DPPAs) in Italy. Control
   measures provided by the Council of the European Union in directive
   2005/94/CE were promptly applied, and enhanced surveillance activities
   were implemented in the DPPAs. On May 16, 2016, a second case was
   confirmed in a fattening turkey farm within the protection zone of the
   previous outbreak. Following an epidemiologic inquiry, another turkey
   farm was considered at risk of transmission and was subjected to
   preemptive culling. Epidemiologic data and phylogenetic analyses
   indicated that the virus was likely introduced from wild birds as a low
   pathogenicity AI strain, through direct contact. The rapid containment
   of the outbreak proves the level of preparedness of the veterinary
   public health sector in Italy. Nevertheless, the recurrent introductions
   from wild birds indicate the need of improving both the biosecurity
   levels in the DPPA and the surveillance activities in wild birds to
   quickly detect the presence of AI in the territory.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted to investigate the presence of Enterococcus

   randomly collected from different geographic localities in Libya. The
   samples were subjected to microbiological analysis for enumeration and
   isolation of Enterococcus spp. by conventional cultural and molecular
   identification using PCR and partial sequencing of 16S rDNA techniques.
   Out of 104 samples, 73 (70.2\%) isolates were found to be enterococci
   based on their cultural characteristics on ESD medium. However, out of
   36 samples subjected to molecular identification, only six isolates were
   confirmed to be Enterococcus spp. using PCR and partial sequencing of
   16S rDNA technique. All enterococci strains tested for their antibiotic
   sensitivity profiles showed high percentage of multi-resistance
   phenotype. These results can be used for further studies on enterococci
   as an emerging food borne pathogen and its role in human infection in
   Libya and would suggest that meat, meat products and seafood might play
   a role in the spreading of enterococci through the food chain with

Title = {Lumpy Skin Disease an emerging threat to Europe: description of symptoms

Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Pages = {83-86},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a disease of cattle mainly transmitted by
   blood feeding vectors, caused by a Capripoxvirus, LSD virus (LSDV).
   Although it is not a zoonosis, the World Organization for Animal Health
   (OIE) categorizes LSD as a notifiable disease due to its economic impact
   on cattle industry. LSD is endemic in Namibia, outbreaks typically occur
   in cycles with quiescent periods lasting several years, depending on the
   rainfalls that modulate the abundance of vectors. Farmers and
   veterinarians are familiar with LSD and usually make diagnosis by
   observing clinical symptoms and typical lumpy lesions. In commercial
   farms vaccination with live LSDV attenuated vaccines (Neethling type) is
   not routinely used but is generally implemented as soon as the disease
   is suspected. As in Namibia it is endemic in most African countries, but
   since 2012, LSD has been spreading on unusually large scale throughout
   Middle Eastern countries reaching South Eastern European countries in
   2015 and spreading further in 2016. Presently, due to its economic
   impact, LSD is considered one of the emerging threat to European cattle
   industry. The present paper describes two different outbreaks of LSD in
   Namibia providing original iconography. The activities are in compliance
   with the mandate of the Italian reference centre for foreign animal
   diseases (CeSME) at the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale
   dell'Abruzzo e del Molise ``G. Caporale{''} (IZSAM), in the framework of
   the preparedness policy in case of incursions of exotic disease of
   animals. The capacity to make a prompt diagnosis is, in fact, recognized
   as essential for all the diseases at risk of introduction in naive
   country as Italy and in this context LSD represent only the most recent
   example which threatens Europe. Furthermore, implementing of
   awareness-raising campaigns and training for farmers and veterinary
   staff in recognising the disease under field conditions has been
   strongly suggested by the experts of European Food Safety Authority
   (EFSA).},

Title = {Analysis of domestic refrigerator temperatures and home storage time
   distributions for shelf-life studies and food safety risk assessment},
Journal = {FOOD RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {96},
Pages = {171-181},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In the framework of food safety, when mimicking the consumer phase, the
   storage time and temperature used are mainly considered as single point
   estimates instead of probability distributions. This singlepoint
   approach does not take into account the variability within a population
   and could lead to an overestimation of the parameters. Therefore, the
   aim of this study was to analyse data on domestic refrigerator
   temperatures and storage times of chilled food in European countries in
   order to draw general rules which could be used either in shelf life
   testing or risk assessment. In relation to domestic refrigerator
   temperatures, 15 studies provided pertinent data. Twelve studies
   presented normal distributions, according to the authors or from the
   data fitted into distributions. Analysis of temperature distributions
   revealed that the countries were separated into two groups: northern
   European countries and southern European countries. The overall
   variability of European domestic refrigerators is described by a normal
   distribution: N (7.0, 2.7) degrees C for southern countries, and, N
   (6.1, 2.8) degrees C for the northern countries. Concerning storage
   times, seven papers were pertinent. Analysis indicated that the storage
   time was likely to end in the first days or weeks (depending on the
   product use-by-date) after purchase. Data fitting showed the exponential
   distribution was the most appropriate distribution to describe the time
   that food spent at consumer's place. The storage time was described by
   an exponential distribution corresponding to the use-by date period
   divided by 4. In conclusion, knowing that collecting data is time and
   money consuming, in the absence of data, and at least for the European
   market and for refrigerated products, building a domestic refrigerator
   temperature distribution using a Normal law and a time-to-consumption
   distribution using an Exponential law would be appropriate. (C) 2017

Abstract = {Orthobunyaviruses are enveloped viruses that can cause human and animal
   diseases. A novel and major member is the Schmallenberg virus (SBV), the
   etiological agent of an emerging disease of ruminants that has been
   spreading all over Europe since 2011. The glycoproteins Gn and Gc of
   orthobunyaviruses mediate the viral entry, and specifically Gc is a
   major target for the humoral immune response. For example, the N
   terminal subdomain of the SBV glycoprotein Gc is targeted by
   neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that recognize conformational
   epitopes. Here, we determined the structural features of the N terminus
   of Gc, and analysed its interaction with monoclonal antibodies. We were
   able to demonstrate that one of two N-glycosylation sites is essential
   for secretion and interaction with a subset of Gc-specific monoclonal
   antibodies. Furthermore, four disulfide bonds (S-S) were identified and
   the deletion of the third S-S blocked reactivity with another subset of
   mAbs with virus-neutralizing and non-neutralizing activity. The
   mutagenesis of the N-glycosylation sites and the disulfide bonds
   strongly indicated the independent folding of two subdomains within the
   SBV Gc N terminus. Further, the epitopes recognized by a panel of mAbs
   could be grouped into two clusters, as revealed by fine mapping using
   chimeric proteins. Combining the disulfide bonding and epitope mapping
   allowed us to generate a structural model of the SBV Gc N terminus. This
   novel information about the role and structure of the amino terminal
   region of SBV Gc is of general relevance for the design of antivirals
   and vaccines against this virus.},

Abstract = {Human leishmaniasis is an emerging problem in Italy and is on the
   increase in the Emilia-Romagna region, northeastern part of the country.
   Nevertheless, studies dealing with the molecular characterization of
   Leishmania spp. circulating in these areas are limited. In the present
   work, we explored the genetic polymorphism of Leishmania isolates from
   28 cases of canine leishmaniasis and three cases of human visceral
   leishmaniasis (VL), which occurred in 2013-2014 in the Emilia-Romagna
   region. The characterization was carried out in comparison with nine
   human isolates of Leishmania from other VL endemic Italian regions and
   two reference strains. Nucleic acid from 31 Leishmania-positive
   phlebotomine sandfly pools, sampled in 2012-2013 in the Emilia-Romagna
   region, were also evaluated. DNA amplification and sequencing of the
   ribosomal internal transcribed spacer-1 and of a repetitive nuclear
   region on chromosome 31 were carried out for genotyping. Two size
   polymorphic targets were also analyzed by PCR, the cpb E/F-gene and the
   k26-gene. Altogether, the analysis showed the circulation of different
   Leishmania infantum genotypes in the Emilia-Romagna region: two
   genotypes found in dogs from public kennels were similar to VL isolates
   from other Italian regions, whereas a third genotype was detected in VL
   cases of the Emilia-Romagna region and in all but one of the sandfly
   pools. The combined molecular tools applied in this study can constitute
   a helpful support for parasite tracking (e.g., in outbreak
   investigations) and for a better understanding of the epidemiological
   evolution of leishmaniasis in northeastern Italy.},

Abstract = {Information architecture (IA) is an essential component of a website,
   and its design significantly impacts the user experience. Within
   complex, large-scale organizational settings, the practice of IA must
   address a number of critical management issues. This paper describes a
   pilot action research project whose aim was to develop and test a model
   for designing the lAs of complex institutional websites. The resulting
   model is based on the strategic use of news content organized in
   accordance with a faceted classification approach. The model was piloted
   during the redevelopment of the website of the Istituto Zooprofilattico
   Sperimentale delle Venezie (IZSVe), a large Italian healthcare and
   research organization. Based on the collected data, the proposed IA
   model was found to effectively manage the website and to greatly reduce
   the need for structural changes in the 12 months after the intervention.
   The model also permits the collection of web analytics data that can be
   useful for web content editors and organization managers. Further
   research will be needed to validate or improve the model. (C) 2017

Abstract = {Since 1998, southern Europe has experienced multiple incursions of
   different serotypes and topotypes of Bluetongue virus, a vector-borne
   transmitted virus, the causative agent of Bluetongue (BT), a major
   disease of ruminants. Some of these incursions originated from northern
   Africa, likely because of wind-blown dissemination of infected midges.
   In this report, we describe the detection and whole genome
   characterization of a novel BTV-3 strain identified in a symptomatic
   sheep in Tunisia. Sequences were immediately deposited with the GenBank
   Database under Accession Nos KY432369-KY432378. Alert and preparedness
   are requested to face the next vector seasons in northern Africa and the
   potential incursion of this novel strain in southern Europe.},

Abstract = {In the early 2000s, Italian beekeepers began to report bee mortality
   events linked to maize sowing. Evidence pointed to three neonicotinoids
   (imidacloprid, clothianidin, thiamethoxam) and a phenylpyrazole
   (fipronil) used for seed dressing that were dispersed in the environment
   during sowing. Following these events and based on the precautionary
   principle, in September 2008, the Italian Ministry of Health suspended
   these four active ingredients as maize seed dressing. Here we show that
   in Italy after the precautionary suspension, the number of bee mortality
   events linked to maize sowing drastically declined. At the same time,
   the average annual maize production per hectare remained unchanged. This
   finding is indicative of the possibility to maintain stable maize
   productions without affecting honey bee health status. The
   implementation of Integrated Pest Management for maize production is
   discussed.},

Journal = {IMPLANT DENTISTRY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {429-437},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Purpose: The aim was to compare the osseointegration degree and
   secondary implant stability between implants with different surface
   treatments.
   Materials and Methods: A novel electrochemical treatment was applied to
   modify the sandblasted and acid-etched surface (SLA) to obtain the new
   hydrophilic Feeling (FEL) surface presenting a highly soluble and
   homogenous film made of calcium and phosphorus nanocrystals. Twenty 3.8
   x 10-mm dynamix implants (Cortex) were inserted in sheep iliac crests.
   Sheep were killed after 2 months. Bone-to-implant contact percentage
   (\%BIC) and biomechanical parameters, such as implant stability quotient
   (ISQ) and value of actual micromotion (VAM), were evaluated for each
   implants.
   Results: No implant failures were observed. Implants of test group
   showed \%BIC value 30\% higher in respect with control group (P =
   0.001). No statistical differences were detected between the 2 groups in
   VAM and ISQ values.
   Conclusion: Both surface treatments were highly osteoconductive because
   they were able to significantly increase the bone density onto implant
   surface in respect with that in which they were inserted (D4 bone
   density). The hydrophilic FEL surface demonstrated an increase of about
   216\% in BIC in respect with host bone density and an additional 30\%
   more in respect with SLA surface. Faster osseointegration process is
   desirable in case of early implant loading protocol.},

Title = {Characterization of hierarchical alpha-MoO3 plates toward resistive
   heating synthesis: electrochemical activity of alpha-MoO3/Pt modified
   electrode toward methanol oxidation at neutral pH},
Journal = {NANOTECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {28},
Number = {21},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {The growth of MoO3 hierarchical plates was obtained by direct resistive
   heating of molybdenum foils at ambient pressure in the absence of any
   catalysts and templates. Plates synthesized after 60 min resistive
   heating typically grow in an single-crystalline orthorhombic structure
   that develop preferentially in the {[}001] direction, and are
   characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscopy,
   selected area diffraction pattern and Raman-scattering measurements.
   They are about 100-200 nm in thickness and a few tens of micrometers in
   length. As heating time proceeds to 80 min, plates of alpha-MoO3 form a
   branched structure. A more attentive look shows that primary plates
   formed at until 60 min could serve as substrates for the subsequent
   growth of secondary belts. Moreover, a full electrochemical
   characterization of alpha-MoO3 plates on platinum electrodes was done by
   cyclic voltammetric experiments, at pH 7 in phosphate buffer, to probe
   the activity of the proposed composite material as anode to methanol
   electro-oxidation. Reported results indicate that Pt MoO3 modified
   electrodes are appropriate to develop new an amperometric non-enzymatic
   sensor for methanol as well as to make anodes suitable to be used in
   direct methanol fuel cells working at neutral pH.},

Title = {Expression of deleted, atoxic atypical recombinant beta2 toxin in a
   baculovirus system and production of polyclonal and monoclonal
   antibodies},
Journal = {MICROBIAL CELL FACTORIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {Background: Clostridium perfringens is an important animal and human
   pathogen that can produce more than 16 different major and minor toxins.
   The beta-2 minor toxin (CPB2), comprising atypical and consensus
   variants, appears to be involved in both human and animal enterotoxaemia
   syndrome. The exact role of CPB2 in pathogenesis is poorly investigated,
   and its mechanism of action at the molecular level is still unknown
   because of the lack of specific reagents such as monoclonal antibodies
   against the CPB2 protein and/or the availability of a highly purified
   antigen. Previous studies have reported that purified wild-type or
   recombinant CPB2 toxin, expressed in a heterologous system, presented
   cytotoxic effects on human intestinal cell lines. Undoubtedly, for this
   reason, to date, these purified proteins have not yet been used for the
   production of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Recently, monoclonal
   antibodies against CPB2 were generated using peptides designed on
   predicted antigenic epitopes of this toxin.
   Results: In this paper we report, for the first time, the expression in
   a baculovirus system of a deleted recombinant C-terminal 6xHis-tagged
   atypical CPB2 toxin -(rCPB2(Delta 1-25)-His(6)) lacking the 25 amino
   acids (aa) of the N-terminal putative signal sequence. A high level of
   purified recombinant rCPB2(Delta 1-25)-His(6) was obtained after
   purification by -Ni2+ affinity chromatography. The purified product
   showed no in vitro and in vivo toxicity. Polyclonal antibodies and
   twenty hybridoma-secreting Mabs were generated using purified
   rCPB2(Delta 1-25)-His(6). Finally, the reactivity and specificity of the
   new antibodies were tested against both recombinant and wild-type CPB2
   toxins.
   Conclusions: The high-throughput of purified atoxic recombinant CPB2
   produced in insect cells, allowed to obtain monoclonal and polyclonal
   antibodies. The availability of these molecules could contribute to
   develop immunoenzymatic methods and/or to perform studies about the
   biological activity of CPB2 toxin.},

Title = {Modelling farm-to-farm disease transmission through personnel movements:
   from visits to contacts, and back},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAY 24},
Abstract = {Infectious diseases in livestock can be transmitted through fomites:
   objects able to convey infectious agents. Between-farm spread of
   infections through fomites is mostly due to indirect contacts generated
   by on-farm visits of personnel that can carry pathogens on their
   clothes, equipment, or vehicles. However, data on farm visitors are
   often difficult to obtain because of the heterogeneity of their nature
   and privacy issues. Thus, models simulating disease spread between farms
   usually rely on strong assumptions about the contribution of indirect
   contacts on infection spread. By using data on veterinarian on-farm
   visits in a dairy farm system, we built a simple simulation model to
   assess the role of indirect contacts on epidemic dynamics compared to
   cattle movements (i.e. direct contacts). We showed that including in the
   simulation model only specific subsets of the information available on
   indirect contacts could lead to outputs widely different from those
   obtained with the full-information model. Then, we provided a simple
   preferential attachment algorithm based on the probability to observe
   consecutive on-farm visits from the same operator that allows overcoming
   the information gaps. Our results suggest the importance of detailed
   data and a deeper understanding of visit dynamics for the prevention and
   control of livestock diseases.},

Abstract = {Fresh vegetables and their ready-to-eat (RTE) salads have become
   increasingly recognized as potential vehicles for foodborne diseases.
   The EU Reg. 1441/2007 establishes microbiological criteria for bacterial
   pathogens for products placed on the market during their shelf-life
   (i.e. Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes) for pre-cut fruits and
   vegetables (RTE) whilst it does not address the problem of contamination
   by enteric viruses. In this study we investigated the contamination by
   hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis E virus (HEV) and norovirus (NoV) in
   911 ready-to-eat vegetable samples taken from products at retail in
   Apulia and in Lombardia.
   The vegetable samples were tested using validated real-time PCR
   (RT-qPCR) assays, ISO standardized virological methods and ISO culturing
   methods for bacteriological analysis.
   The total prevalence of HAV and HEV was 1.9\% (18/911) and 0.6\%
   (6/911), respectively. None of the samples analysed in this study was
   positive for NoV, Salmonella spp. or Listeria monocytogenes. The
   detection of HAV and HEV in RTE salads highlights a risk to consumers
   and the need to improve production hygiene. Appropriate implementation
   of hygiene procedures is required at all the steps of the RTE vegetable
   production chain and this should include monitoring of emerging viral
   pathogens. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Identification of a major Listeria monocytogenes outbreak clone linked

Journal = {BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Month = {MAY 12},
Abstract = {Background: Molecular subtyping and enhanced surveillance in Lombardy
   region identified a cluster of possibly related listeriosis cases from
   2006 to 2010. This cluster grouped 31 isolates that belonged to serotype
   1/2a and Sequence Type 38 (ST38) as defined by Multilocus Sequence
   Typing (MLST).
   Methods: Our study expanded the previous investigation to include cases
   from 2011 to 2014 and used Multi-Virulence- Locus Sequence Typing
   (MVLST) on all ST38 isolates to better understand their epidemiology and
   possibly identify a common source outbreak.
   Results: Out of 306 L. monocytogenes clinical isolates collected, 43
   (14.1\%) belonged to ST38 with cases occurring in nine out of twelve
   Lombardy provinces. The ST38 isolates were split by MVLST into two
   Virulence Types (VTs): VT80 (n = 12) and VT104 (n = 31). VT104 cases
   were concentrated between 2009 and 2011 in two provinces, Bergamo and
   Milan. An epidemiologic investigation was performed and in one case, a
   matching VT104 isolate was retrieved from a soft cheese sample from a
   patient's refrigerator.
   Conclusions: Our findings revealed a major listeriosis outbreak in
   Northern Italy linked to soft cheese in 20092011, which went undetected
   by local health authorities. Our study shows that integrating subtyping
   methods with conventional epidemiology can help identify the source of
   L. monocytogenes outbreak clones.},

Abstract = {Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are of interest due to their antimicrobial
   activity and are seen as potential candidates to replace antibiotics in
   animal husbandry. A few studies have focused on this new application,
   but they lack any considerations about residual accumulation of AgNPs in
   edible animal tissues and animal products. In this research, a 22 day in
   vivo study was carried out by oral administration of 20 nm spherical PVP
   coated AgNPs to hens. Six doses of approximately 1 mg kg(-1) of
   AgNPs-PVP each were administered to animals throughout the
   experimentation. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) was used for
   quantitative determination of residual total Ag in different organs and
   matrices. The analyses showed that Ag accumulates in livers
   (concentration ranging from 141 mu g kg(-1) to 269,mu g kg(-1)) and
   yolks (concentration ranging from 20 mu g kg(-1) to 49 mu g kg(-1)) but
   not in muscles, kidneys, and albumen belonging to hens of the treated
   group (tG2). Ag was not detected in animals of the control group (uG1)
   (i.e., total Ag < LOD = 10 mu g kg(-1)). Single particle inductively
   coupled plasma mass spectrometry (spICP-MS) and scanning electron
   microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray detection (SEM-EDX) were
   employed to elucidate the presence of AgNPs in livers and yolks
   belonging to tG2 animals. spICP-MS highlighted that part of residual Ag
   found in livers (about 5-20\%) is in NP form with an average dimension
   of approximately 20 nm. SEM-EDX technique confirmed the presence of
   AgNPs only in livers of treated animals. The results show that feeding
   AgNPs to hens may become a source of consumer exposure to AgNPs. As far
   as we know this is the first study showing transfer of AgNPs or reaction
   products thereof from animal feed to animal products.},

Abstract = {Outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in North Africa (2013) and the
   Gulf States (2013) of the Middle East have been caused by a FMD viral
   lineage (O/ME-SA/Ind-2001) that was before 2013 restricted to the Indian
   Sub-continent. This study was undertaken to assess the in vivo efficacy
   of a FMD virus emergency vaccine type O-1 Manisa against heterologous
   challenge with a representative field virus (O/ALG/3/2014) from this
   emerging lineage. This widely available vaccine was selected since in
   vitro vaccine-matching results gave inconclusive results as to whether
   or not it would be protective. Three groups of five cattle were
   vaccinated with O-1 Manisa (homologous potency >= 6PD(50)/dose) using
   study guidelines outlined in the European Pharmacopeia, and challenged
   at 21 days post-vaccination by tongue inoculation. All animals that were
   vaccinated with the lowest dose (1/16) of vaccine developed generalised
   FMD, defined as vesicular lesions at the feet. One animal vaccinated
   with a 1/4 dose of the vaccine also developed generalised disease, as
   did two animals vaccinated with the full dose of vaccine. These results
   indicate that the heterologous potency of this high potency O-1 Manisa
   vaccine was approximately 3.5 PD50/dose. These data support the use of
   the O-1 Manisa vaccine for FMD control in areas where FMDV is endemic
   e.g. North Africa, and motivate further studies to evaluate other
   vaccine candidates (or multivalent combinations) that might be
   potentially used for emergency purposes in FMD-free settings. (C) 2017

Abstract = {Background and aim
   Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous inflammatory disease whose
   causes are still unknown and for which epidemiological data are often
   discordant. The aim of our study is to investigate prevalence and
   spatial distribution of cases, and identify environmental exposures
   associated with sarcoidosis in an Italian province.
   Methods
   After georeferentiation of cases, the area under study was subdivided
   with respect to Municipality and Health Districts and to the altitude in
   order to identify zonal differences in prevalence. The bioaccumulation
   levels of 12 metals in lichen tissues were analyzed, in order to
   determine sources of air pollution. Finally, the analysis of the
   correlation between metals and between pickup stations was performed.
   Results
   223 patients were identified (58.3\% female and 41.7\% male of total)
   and the mean age was 50.6 +/- 15.4 years (53.5 +/- 15.5 years for the
   females and 46.5 +/- 14.4 for the males). The mean prevalence was 49 per
   100.000 individuals. However, we observed very heterogeneous prevalence
   in the area under study. The correlations among metals revealed
   different deposition patterns in lowland area respect to hilly and
   mountain areas.
   Conclusions
   The study highlights a high prevalence of sarcoidosis cases,
   characterized by a very inhomogeneous and patchy distribution with
   phenomena of local aggregation. Moreover, the bioaccumulation analysis
   was an effective method to identify the mineral particles that mostly
   contribute to air pollution in the different areas, but it was not
   sufficient to establish a clear correlation between the onset of
   sarcoidosis and environmental risk factors.},

Abstract = {This article uses the experience of five European countries to review
   the integrated approaches (human, animal and vector) for surveillance
   and monitoring of West Nile virus (WNV) at national and European levels.
   The epidemiological situation of West Nile fever in Europe is
   heterogeneous. No model of surveillance and monitoring fits all, hence
   this article merely encourages countries to implement the integrated
   approach that meets their needs. Integration of surveillance and
   monitoring activities conducted by the public health authorities, the
   animal health authorities and the authorities in charge of vector
   surveillance and control should improve efficiency and save resources by
   implementing targeted measures. The creation of a formal interagency
   working group is identified as a crucial step towards integration. Blood
   safety is a key incentive for public health authorities to allocate
   sufficient resources for WNV surveillance, while the facts that an
   effective vaccine is available for horses and that most infected animals
   remain asymptomatic make the disease a lesser priority for animal health
   authorities. The examples described here can support other European
   countries wishing to strengthen their WNV surveillance or preparedness,
   and also serve as a model for surveillance and monitoring of other
   (vectorborne) zoonotic infections.},

Title = {Viral nervous necrosis in gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) caused by

   Mediterranean aquaculture},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {Viral nervous necrosis (VNN) certainly represents the biggest challenge
   for the sustainability and the development of aquaculture. A large
   number of economically relevant fish species have proven to be
   susceptible to the disease. Conversely, gilthead sea bream has generally
   been considered resistant to VNN, although it has been possible to
   isolate the virus from apparently healthy sea bream and sporadically
   from affected larvae and postlarvae. Unexpectedly, in 2014-2016 an
   increasing number of hatcheries in Europe have experienced mass
   mortalities in sea bream larvae. Two clinical outbreaks were monitored
   over this time span and findings are reported in this paper. Despite
   showing no specific clinical signs, the affected fish displayed high
   mortality and histological lesions typical of VNN. Fish tested positive
   for betanodavirus by different laboratory techniques. The isolates were
   all genetically characterized as being reassortant strains RGNNV/SJNNV.
   A genetic characterization of all sea bream betanodaviruses which had
   been isolated in the past had revealed that the majority of the strains
   infecting sea bream are actually RGNNV/SJNNV. Taken together, this
   information strongly suggests that RGNNV/SJNNV betanodavirus possesses a
   particular tropism to sea bream, which can pose a new and unexpected
   threat to the Mediterranean aquaculture.},

Title = {Shelf life of diluted human interferon-alpha for veterinary clinical use},
Journal = {BIOLOGICALS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {47},
Pages = {18-21},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Background: Oral, low-dose, human interferon (IFN)-alpha treatments have
   shown efficacy in different models of viral and autoimmune diseases.
   Human IFN-alpha is commonly used at a daily dose between 1 and 10 IU/kg
   body weight. Registered products matching these doses at convenient
   concentrations are lacking.
   Aim: The stability of sterile, diluted, human leukocyte IFN-alpha was
   investigated under cold-chain and room temperature conditions.
   Results: Diluted IFN-alpha displayed moderate decay at room temperature
   (20-23 degrees C), which should restrict the shelf life to 3-4 days
   after compounding. On the contrary, a substantial stability was
   demonstrated over 6 months under cold-chain conditions. Such a stability
   of IFN-alpha was correlated with the maintenance of Class I
   MHC-modulating properties.
   Conclusion: A shelf life of six months can be envisaged for sterile,
   diluted preparations of human IFN-alpha under cold-chain conditions, and
   batch size should be adjusted in accordance with this property. (C) 2017

Abstract = {Aedes koreicus (Edwards) is an invasive mosquito species, like Aedes
   albopictus (Skuse) and Aedes japonicus japonicus (Theobald), that has
   already colonized a large part of northeastern Italy and other European
   countries. Despite its rapid expansion, information about adult
   distribution and trapping is lacking. Here, we conducted a 2-yr
   longitudinal survey using adult traps to investigate the spatiotemporal
   distribution of Ae. koreicus and evaluated the effectiveness of three
   trapping devices in Latin square experiments conducted in an urban site
   and a forested site. The following three different traps were compared:
   a CO2-baited Biogents (BG) Sentinel trap, a CO2-baited Centers for
   Disease Control and Prevention light trap (CDC trap), and a grass
   infusion-baited gravid trap.
   In northern Italy, Ae. koreicus was collected from late April to early
   November, with peak of abundance observed in August. Aedes koreicus was
   more abundant in 2015 than in 2014 because of higher temperatures during
   summer. Unlike Ae. albopictus, the abundance of Ae. koreicus was not
   related to the altitude of the sampling locations in the range 241-660 m
   above sea level. The BG Sentinel and gravid traps collected
   significantly more Ae. koreicus than the CDC trap in the urban site,
   whereas there was no significant difference between the three traps in
   the forested site. In the urban site, the BG Sentinel trap and the
   gravid trap were the most effective for collecting Ae. albopictus and
   Culex pipiens L., respectively. In the forested site, Cx. pipiens was
   primarily collected by the CDC trap.},

Abstract = {This study investigated whether canine mesenchymal stromal cells (cMSCs)
   are able to take up and release paclitaxel (PTX) in active form, and
   therefore whether they have potential as a tool for therapeutic delivery
   of this drug. cMSCs from bone marrow and adipose tissue were isolated,
   expanded and characterised phenotypically. cMSCs were loaded with PTX
   (cMSCs-PTX) and their capacity for release of PTX was determined by
   their effect on proliferation of cancer cells. cMSCs-PTX derived from
   bone marrow and adipose tissue were able to take up and then release
   active PTX. cMSCs-PTC inhibited proliferation of the canine glioma cell
   line J3T, and the human glioblastoma cell lines T98G and U87MG. The
   potential of canine cMSCs-PTX for treatment of canine gliomas should be
   investigated further. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   Hemostasis was evaluated using standard coagulation tests and ROTEM
   analysis, obtaining in-TEM, ex-TEM, and fib-TEM profiles. Statistically
   significant differences in the ROTEM profiles of newborn calves were
   found between T0 and T8 and between T0 and T15 (p < 0.05) but not
   between T8 and T15. Differences between ROTEM profiles of calves and
   adults were statistically significant at T0 (p < 0.05) but no
   differences were found at T15 (p < 0.05). Hence, ROTEM reference

Title = {Validation of a serum neutralization test for detection of antibodies

Abstract = {Cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3) is the aetiological agent of a serious
   infective, notifiable disease affecting common carp and varieties. In
   survivors, infection is generally characterized by a subclinical latency
   phase with restricted viral replication. The CyHV-3 genome is difficult
   to detect in such carrier fish that represent a potential source of
   dissemination if viral reactivation occurs. In this study, the
   analytical and diagnostic performance of an alternative serum
   neutralization (SN) method based on the detection of CyHV-3-specific
   antibodies was assessed using 151 serum or plasma samples from healthy
   and naturally or experimentally CyHV-3-infected carp. French CyHV-3
   isolate 07/108b was neutralized efficiently by sera from carp infected
   with European, American and Taiwanese CyHV-3 isolates, but no
   neutralization was observed using sera specific to other aquatic
   herpesviruses. Diagnostic sensitivity, diagnostic specificity and
   repeatability of 95.9\%, 99.0\% and 99.3\%, respectively, were obtained,
   as well as a compliance rate of 89.9\% in reproducibility testing.
   Neutralizing antibodies were steadily detected in infected carp
   subjected to restrictive or permissive temperature variations over more
   than 25months post-infection. The results suggest that this non-lethal
   diagnostic test could be used in the future to improve the
   epidemiological surveillance and control of CyHV-3 disease.},

Title = {ELIME assay vs Real-Time PCR and conventional culture method for an
   effective detection of Salmonella in fresh leafy green vegetables},
Journal = {TALANTA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {166},

Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {The detection of Salmonella according to EC regulation is still
   primarily based on traditional microbiological culture methods that may
   take several days to be completed.
   The purpose of this work is to demonstrate the applicability of an
   Enzyme-Linked-Immuno-Magnetic-Electrochemical (ELIME) assay, recently
   developed by our research group for the detection of salmonella in
   irrigation water, in fresh (raw and ready-to-eat) leafy green vegetables
   by comparison with Real-Time PCR (RTi-PCR) and ISO culture methods.
   Since vegetables represent a more complex matrix than irrigation water,
   preliminary experiments were carried out on two leafy green vegetables
   that resulted negative for salmonella by the ISO method. 25 g of these
   samples were experimentally inoculated with 1-10 CFU of S. Napoli or S.
   Thompson and pre-enriched for 20 h in two different broths. At this time
   aliquots were taken, concentrated at different levels by centrifugation,
   and analyzed by ELIME and RTi-PCR. Once selected the best culture medium
   for salmonella growth, and the optimal concentration factor suitable to
   reduce the sample matrix effect, enhancing the out-put signal, several
   raw and ready-to-eat leafy green vegetables were artificially inoculated
   and pre-enriched. Aliquots were then taken at different incubation times
   and analyzed with both techniques. Results obtained showed that 20 and 8
   h of pre-enrichment were required to allow the target salmonella (1-10
   CFU/25 g) to multiply until reaching a detectable concentration by ELIME
   and RTi-PCR assays, respectively. A confirmation with the ISO culture
   method was carried out. Based on the available literature, this is the
   first report of the application of an ELISA based method for the
   detection of Salmonella in vegetables.},

Abstract = {The occurrence of virus belonging to the putative genus Influenzavirus
   D, has been demonstrated allaround the world arousing interest within
   the scientific community. Most of the published virological surveys are
   based on the first described Real-Time PCR method, designed on the PB1
   gene of the first isolate. The necessity of extending investigation to
   different animal species and geographic areas, requires a continuous
   update of molecular tests, considering newly sequenced strains.
   Moreover, the availability of an alternative assay, is essential either
   to confirm data, or for ensuring the detection of the widest number of
   strains. A new Real-Time PCR, specific for influenza D virus (IDV), was
   developed and evaluated. The target sequences of primers and probe are
   highly conserved among IDV strains currently known. The specificity of
   the method was demonstrated in silico by BLAST, and in vitro with a huge
   panel of common swine and bovine respiratory pathogens. The analytical
   sensitivity of the Real-Time PCR was estimated through synthetic RNA
   molecules and the limit of detection was about 20 copies/mu L. The assay
   was assessed in field and proved to be a valuable tool for the detection
   of IDV strains. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Comparative phenotypic and functional analyses of the effects of
   autologous plasma and recombinant human macrophage-colony stimulating

Abstract = {Porcine monocyte-derived macrophages (moM phi) have been employed as a
   model cell in numerous studies of the porcine immune system. However,
   the lack of a standardized method for moM phi differentiation hampers
   the comparison of results coming from the use of different laboratory
   protocols. In this study we compared the use of varying concentrations
   of autologous plasma (10, 20 and 30\% v/v) or recombinant human
   macrophage-colony stimulating factor (hM-CSF; 50, 100, and 200 ng/ml) to
   differentiate porcine monocytes into macrophages. Changes in cell
   morphology and surface marker expression were assessed by confocal
   microscopy and flow cytometry. Macrophage differentiation was evaluated
   by analysing TNF-alpha response to LPS stimulation and determining
   cytokine secretion patterns under both basal conditions and after
   classical and alternative activation. The effects of the differentiation
   methods on metabolic activity and susceptibility to infection with the
   myelotropic African swine fever virus (ASFV) were also evaluated.
   Monocytes cultured using the different culture conditions tested
   augmented in dimension and cellular complexity, but increasing porcine
   plasma concentrations resulted in a dose dependent enhancement in
   granularity and a marked pleomorphism. As expected, CD163, MHC class II
   DR and CD203a expression were up-regulated in both hM-CSF (M-CSF-moM
   phi) and autologous plasma cultured macrophages (AP-moM phi), although a
   lower percentage of CD163 cells were found following differentiation
   with high percentages of porcine plasma. We observed enhanced number of
   viable cells using high concentration of hM-CSF compared to porcine
   plasma, suggesting a proliferative effect. Irrespective of
   differentiation conditions, monocyte differentiation into macrophages
   resulted in an increased susceptibility to ASFV and yielded larger
   amounts of LPS-induced TNF-alpha. AP-moM phi showed a higher basal
   release of IL-1RA compared to those cultured with hM-CSF and displayed a
   reduced ability to respond to classical activation, suggesting that the
   use of high percentages of porcine plasma led to the acquisition of a
   M2-like phenotype. We conclude that all the protocols tested in this
   study can be considered as suitable to produce porcine moM phi, although
   the use of hM-CSF provides high responsiveness to Ml polarization. Since
   a higher phenotypic and functional inter-animal variability was observed
   in AP-moM phi, we propose that the use of low concentration of hM-CSF
   should be adopted as the method of choice to provide a better
   reproducibility between experiments.},

Abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of clinical infections in humans
   and its enterotoxins cause foodborne disease. In the present study, we
   tested a total of 51 isolates of S. aureus from small-ruminant dairy
   farms with artisan dairy facilities, all located in Latium, Italy. The
   farms have a known history of a high prevalence of methicillin-resistant
   S. aureus (MRSA). Most of the MRSA isolates (27 of 51) belonged to
   spa-type t127 (43.1\%), followed by t2678 (3.9\%), t044 (2\%), t1166
   (2\%), and t1773 (2\%). PFGE performed on mecA positive strains
   identified one cluster (>= 80\% of similarity), comprising 22 MRSA. Nine
   of twenty-two MRSA isolates were assigned human host origin, and 13
   isolates did not belong to a specific host. During the characterization
   study, one strain isolated from bulk tank milk samples harbored the pvl
   gene; the strain was not enterotoxigenic with a non-specific host
   according to the biotyping scheme, highlighting the possible emerging
   risk of transmission of bacterial virulence factors by foods, the
   environment, and foodhandlers. These findings stress the importance of
   hygienic measures at all processing steps of the food production chain
   and underline that monitoring for the presence of MRSA throughout the
   food chain is essential for public health.},

Abstract = {Post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) is a relevant,
   worldwide disease caused by porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2).
   Microscopically, PMWS is mainly characterized by lymphocytic depletion,
   macrophage infiltration and syncytia in lymphoid tissues. Some data
   suggest that follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) could be infected by
   PCV2, thus likely playing a role in the pathogenesis of PMWS. The
   present paper aims at assessing, qualitatively and quantitatively, the
   FDCs' network in the soft palate tonsils of clinically healthy and
   PMWS-affected pigs. Consecutive tissue sections were tested by
   immunohistochemistry to detect PCV2, FDCs and macrophages. FDCs and PCV2
   antigens were quantitatively assessed by means of the Image J software
   and results submitted to statistical analysis. Our data demonstrated
   that FDCs are significantly reduced in PMWS-affected pigs compared with
   healthy pigs and that FDCs' depletion should be considered among
   microscopic features of PMWS. It is reasonable to hypothesize that
   depletion of FDCs further compromises the immune response and enhances
   the occurrence and the severity of secondary infections, which are
   relevant for the clinical manifestation of PMWS.},

Abstract = {Vaccines are useful tools to control influenza A virus infection in

   the evolution of the hemagglutinin of the H5N1 highly pathogenic avian
   influenza viral population in infected animals vaccinated with two
   vaccines conferring different protection levels. Results from this
   preliminary investigation suggested that the evolution of the viral
   population, as well as the abundance and heterogeneity of minority

Abstract = {This work investigated the effects of mercury chloride (HgCl2) acute
   exposure on virgin, pregnant and lactating rats by determination of
   renal and hepatic morphological and ultrastructural parameters and the
   expression of oxidative stress and stress tolerance markers, due to
   kidney and liver are the organs that more accumulate inorganic mercury.
   Adult Wistar rats virgin (90 days old), pregnant (18(th) gestation day)
   and lactating (7(th) lactation day) were injected once with HgCl2 (5
   mg/kg) or saline (controls). We observed that HgCl2 exposure of virgin
   rats caused significant inflammatory infiltration and severe
   morphological variations, like glomeruli atrophy, dilatation of Bowman's
   capsule, tubular degeneration and hepatocytes alteration. Moreover,
   virgin rats presented mitochondrial modification, important oxidative
   stress and increase in stress tolerance proteins at both kidney and
   liver level, compared with virgin controls. In detail, virgin rats
   exposed to HgCl2 presented significantly elevated level of inducible
   nitric oxide synthase, heat shock protein 27 and glucose regulated
   proteins 75 expressions at both renal tubular and hepatocytes level,
   respect untreated virgin rats. Interestingly, pregnant and lactating
   rats exposed to HgCl2 presented weak renal and liver morphological
   alterations, showing weak inflammatory infiltration and no significant
   difference in structural mitochondrial transmembrane protein, oxidative
   stress markers and stress tolerance proteins expressions respect
   controls (virgin, pregnant and lactating rats). Although, both control
   and HgCl2-exposed pregnant and lactating rats showed renal glomeruli
   greater in diameter respect virgin rats. In conclusion, we believe that
   virgin rats are more sensitive to HgCl2 toxicity respect pregnant and
   lactating rats. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Environ Toxicol 32:

Abstract = {Introduction: Mosquito-borne diseases (MBDs) are spreading worldwide due
   to globalization and climate change, representing a threat for both
   humans and animals. Of great concern are the infections caused by
   viruses belonging to the Flavivirus genus as West Nile virus (WNV) and
   Usutu virus (USUV) transmitted by Culex sp. or Dengue virus and Zika
   virus (ZIKV), transmitted by Aedes sp. This work describes the
   surveillance protocol enforced in Piedmont (Northwestern Italy) to
   control MBDs spread, focusing on the activities performed on mosquitoes
   during the 2015 vector season. Materials and Methods: From July to
   October, mosquitoes were fortnightly sampled in 50 selected sites
   according to risk factors with CDC dry ice-baited traps and BG-Sentinel
   traps baited with BG-Lure and dry ice. Adults were counted, identified
   to species level, pooled, and screened for flaviviruses using different
   reverse transcription-PCR protocols and sequencing. Finally,
   phylogenetic analysis was performed on a dataset including 2014 and 2015
   WNV sequences and reference sequences retrieved from GenBank. Results
   and Discussion: A total of 17,000 mosquitoes, grouped in 730 pools, were
   tested. Five pools of Culex pipiens were positive for WNV Lineage 2 in
   Novara, Alessandria, Vercelli, and Torino Provinces. One pool of C.
   pipiens and one pool of Anopheles maculipennis s.l. were positive for
   USUV in Vercelli and Alessandria Provinces. In Vercelli Province one
   pool of C. pipiens resulted positive both for WNV and USUV. Control
   measures were quickly implemented. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the
   WNV Lin 2 sequences from Piedmont region cluster with those circulating
   in Northeastern Italy in the previous years. Given the positive trend in
   WNV activity compared to 2014 and the emergence caused by other
   flavivirus as ZIKV, the level of attention for the 2016 vector season
   may be increased and this surveillance protocol could represent an
   important tool for public health authorities.},

Title = {Expression Dynamics of Innate Immunity in Influenza Virus-Infected Swine},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},

Abstract = {The current circulating swine influenza virus (IV) subtypes in Europe
   (H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2) are associated with clinical outbreaks of
   disease. However, we showed that pigs could be susceptible to other IV
   strains that are able to cross the species barrier. In this work, we
   extended our investigations into whether different IV strains able to
   cross the species barrier might give rise to different innate immune
   responses that could be associated with pathological lesions. For this
   purpose, we used the same samples collected in a previous study of ours,
   in which healthy pigs had been infected with a H3N2 Swine IV and four
   different H3N8 IV strains circulating in different animal species. Pigs
   had been clinically inspected and four subjects/group were sacrificed at
   3, 6, and 21 days post infection. In the present study, all groups but
   mock exhibited antibody responses to IV nucleoprotein protein. Pulmonary
   lesions and high-titered viral replication were observed in pigs
   infected with the swine-adapted virus. Interestingly, pigs infected with
   avian and seal H3N8 strains also showed moderate lesions and viral
   replication, whereas equine and canine IVs did not cause overt
   pathological signs, and replication was barely detectable. Swine IV
   infection induced interferon (IFN)-alpha and interleukin-6 responses in
   bronchoalveolar fluids (BALF) at day 3 post infection, as opposed to the
   other non-swine-adapted virus strains. However, IFN-alpha responses to
   the swine-adapted virus were not associated with an increase of the
   local, constitutive expression of IFN-alpha genes. Remarkably, the
   Equine strain gave rise to a Serum Amyloid A response in BALF despite
   little if any replication. Each virus strain could be associated with
   expression of cytokine genes and/or proteins after infection. These
   responses were observed well beyond the period of virus replication,
   suggesting a prolonged homeostatic imbalance of the innate immune
   system.},

Abstract = {Turtle blood flukes belonging to the family Spirorchiidae (Digenea)
   represent a major threat for sea turtle health and are considered the
   most important parasitic cause of turtle stranding and mortality
   worldwide. Despite the large diversity of spirorchiid species found
   globally, there are only 2 records for free-ranging Mediterranean sea
   turtles that date back to the late 1800s involving just Hapalotrema
   mistroides Monticelli, 1896. This study describes the first fatal
   confirmed case of spirorchiidiasis in a free-ranging Mediterranean
   loggerhead turtle Caretta caretta (Linnaeus) and, owing to the
   complexities of taxonomic identification of these parasites, provides
   the first molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of H.
   mistroides from the Mediterranean Sea. The loggerhead turtle showed
   cachexia and digestive disorders associated with severe damage to the
   pancreas and intestinal ganglia, caused by deposition of Hapalotrema
   eggs forming granulomas. Massive Hapalotrema egg emboli in several
   tissues and organs and encephalitis were the most probable contributions
   to the death of the turtle. The congruence between the phylogenetic
   analysis of both the ITS2 and 28S rDNA resolved the Italian and USA H.
   mistroides as the same species, confirming the parasite identification.
   The case here described clearly indicates that the blood flukes should
   be considered in the differential diagnosis of Mediterranean sea turtle
   diseases.},

Abstract = {The applicability to the determination of mercury in tuna of square wave
   anodic stripping voltammetry (SW-ASV) conducted at both solid gold
   electrode (SGE) and a gold nanoparticle-modified glassy carbon electrode
   (AuNPs-GCE) was demonstrated. Mercury content in two certified materials
   and in ten samples of canned tuna was measured. The performances of the
   electrodes were compared with one another as well as with two
   spectroscopic techniques, namely cold vapour atomic absorption
   spectroscopy (CV-AAS) and a direct mercury analyser (DMA). The results
   found pointed out that both SW-ASV approaches were suitable and
   easy-to-use method to monitor mercury concentration in tunas, since they
   allowed accurate quantification at concentration values lower than the
   maximum admissible level in this matrix ({[}Hg] = 1 mg/kg(wet
   weight,ww)). In particular, mercury detection at the AuNPs-GCE showed a
   LOQ in fish-matrix of 0.1 mu g/l, corresponding to 0.06 mg/kg(ww), with
   performance comparable to that of DMA. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Evaluation of six serological ELISA kits available in Italy as screening
   tests for equine infectious anaemia surveillance},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Month = {APR 14},
Abstract = {Background: ELISAs are known to have a higher diagnostic sensitivity
   than the agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) when employed for serological
   diagnosis of equine infectious anaemia (EIA). For this purpose, an
   ``in-house{''}and five commercial ELISAs available in Italy were
   assessed by the National Reference Centre for EIA for their analytic
   specificity (Sp); precocity, defined as capability of detecting first
   antibodies produced during a new infection; precision based on
   repeatability and reproducibility, estimated from the coefficient of
   variation (CV); accuracy, estimated from multiple K and relative Sp and
   sensitivity (Se). Two serum panels, positive for non-equine retroviruses
   and the most frequent equine viruses, were employed to measure analytic
   Sp. ELISA precocity was also compared to that of one ``in-house{''}and
   three commercial AGID kits, employing a panel of sera, collected weekly
   from horses infected with modified EIA viruses. Precision and accuracy
   were defined using results of a panel containing positive and negative
   sera examined in an inter-laboratory trial with the participation of the
   ten Official Laboratories. Furthermore, a questionnaire was used to
   assess the appropriateness of each kit for routine use.
   Results: Analytic Sp was 100\%, while the 75th percentile of CVs for
   positive sera varied from 0.4\% to 12.73\% for repeatability and from
   1.6\% to 44.87\% for reproducibility. Although CV of the negative serum
   was constantly high, its outcome was unaltered. Relative Se ranged from
   98.2\% to 100\%, relative Sp was constantly 100\% and multiple K ranged
   from 0.95 to 1. Precocity differed among the assays: three kits detected
   4.8\% and 42.9\% positive samples on 21 days post infection (dpi), all
   assays detected positive samples on 28 dpi, between 47.6\% and 95.2\%.
   Precocity of ELISAs was superior to that of the AGIDs except for two
   assays. In view of the feedback obtained from the questionnaires, all
   kits were considered appropriate for routine use.
   Conclusion: All ELISAs having high Se and precocity are preferable as a
   screening test in EIA surveillance programmes to the AGID tests
   examined. These two tests can be incorporated in a serial diagnostic
   pathway to improve the efficacy of a surveillance plan.},

Title = {Tick-Pathogen Interactions and Vector Competence: Identification of
   Molecular Drivers for Tick-Borne Diseases},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {APR 7},
Abstract = {Ticks and the pathogens they transmit constitute a growing burden for
   human and animal health worldwide. Vector competence is a component of
   vectorial capacity and depends on genetic determinants affecting the
   ability of a vector to transmit a pathogen. These determinants affect
   traits such as tick-host-pathogen and susceptibility to pathogen
   infection. Therefore, the elucidation of the mechanisms involved in
   tick-pathogen interactions that affect vector competence is essential
   for the identification of molecular drivers for tick-borne diseases. In
   this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of tick-pathogen
   molecular interactions for bacteria, viruses, and protozoa affecting
   human and animal health. Additionally, the impact of tick microbiome on
   these interactions was considered. Results show that different pathogens
   evolved similar strategies such as manipulation of the immune response
   to infect vectors and facilitate multiplication and transmission.
   Furthermore, some of these strategies may be used by pathogens to infect
   both tick and mammalian hosts. Identification of interactions that
   promote tick survival, spread, and pathogen transmission provides the
   opportunity to disrupt these interactions and lead to a reduction in
   tick burden and the prevalence of tick-borne diseases. Targeting some of
   the similar mechanisms used by the pathogens for infection and
   transmission by ticks may assist in development of preventative
   strategies against multiple tick-borne diseases.},

Title = {Proteomic analysis of protein purified derivative of Mycobacterium bovis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {15},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {Background: Tuberculin skin test based on in vivo intradermal
   inoculation of purified protein derivative from Mycobacterium bovis
   (bPPD) is the diagnostic test for the control and surveillance of bovine
   tuberculosis (bTB).
   Methods: Proteomic analysis was performed on different bPPD preparations
   from M. bovis, strain AN5. Proteins were precipitated from bPPD
   solutions by TCA precipitation. The proteome of bPPD preparations was
   investigated by bottom-up proteomics, which consisted in protein
   digestion and nano-LC-MS/MS analysis. Mass spectrometry analysis was
   performed on a Q-exactive hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer
   coupled online to an Easy nano-LC1000 system.
   Results: Three hundred and fifty-six proteins were identified and
   quantified by at least 2 peptides (99\% confidence per peptide). One
   hundred and ninety-eight proteins, which had not been previously
   described, were detected; furthermore, the proteomic profile shared 80
   proteins with previous proteomes from bPPDs from the United Kingdom and
   Brazil and 139 protein components from bPPD from Korea. Locus name of M.
   bovis (Mb) with orthologs from M. tuberculosis H37Rv, comparative gene
   and protein length, molecular mass, functional categories, gene name and
   function of each protein were reported. Ninety-two T cell mycobacterial
   antigens responsible for delayed-type hypersensitivity were detected,
   fifty-two of which were not previously reported in any bPPD proteome.
   Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD005920.
   Conclusions: This study represents the highest proteome coverage of bPPD
   preparations to date. Since proteins perform cellular functions
   essential to health and/or disease, obtaining knowledge of their
   presence and variance is of great importance in understanding disease
   states and for advancing translational studies. Therefore, to better
   understand Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex biology during infection,
   survival, and persistence, the reproducible evaluation of the proteins
   that catalyze and control these processes is critically important. More
   active and more specific tuberculins would be desirable. Indeed, many
   antigens contained within bPPD are currently responsible for the
   cross-reactivity resulting in false-positive results as they are shared
   between non-tuberculous and tuberculous mycobacteria.},

Abstract = {Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm) and its monophasic variant
   4,{[}5],12:i-: (VMSTm) have been responsible for an increased number of
   foodborne infections in humans in Europe in recent years. The aim of
   this study was to investigate the origin of three foodborne
   salmonellosis outbreaks that occurred in Pavia Province (Lombardy
   region, northern Italy) in 2010. Phenotypic and genetic characteristics
   of the STm and VMSTm isolates from patients and from food that were
   recovered in the framework of the three outbreaks were evaluated through
   serotyping, phage typing, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, pulsed
   field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and multiple-locus variable-number
   tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). Salami from three artisan producers,
   which had all purchased meat from the same slaughterhouse, was the food
   source of infection in outbreak I. STm isolates were recovered from
   salami and patients with symptoms of gastroenteritis. These isolates had
   the same PFGE type and the same rare MLVA profile (3-18-9-NA-211). The
   same molecular profiles were found in an STm isolate from a salami,
   which likely was the source of another family outbreak (II). A VMSTm
   strain with common phenotypic and molecular profiles was isolated from
   three hospitalized patients and identified as the cause of another
   putative outbreak (111). During the following 3 years (2011 through
   2013), 360 salami produced in Pavia Province were monitored for the
   presence of S. enterica. In 2011, no STm and VMSTm isolates were
   recovered from 159 salami tested. During 2012 and 2013, 13.9\% of 201
   tested salami harbored S. enterica, and half of the isolates were VMSTm,
   mainly in salami from those artisan producers involved in the previous
   outbreaks. These isolates were genetically variable, especially in terms
   of MLVA profiles. The data collected suggest that from 2012, VMSTm has
   replaced STm in the environments of the salami producers monitored in
   this study, and these data confirm the dominance of this emergent
   serovar along the pork supply chain.},

Title = {Genotyping of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
   isolated from milk and dairy products in South Italy},
Journal = {FOOD MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {62},
Pages = {141-146},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a pathogen
   emerging in hospitals as well as community and livestock. MRSA is a
   significant and costly public health concern because it may enter the
   human food chain and contaminate milk and dairy products causing
   foodborne illness.
   This study aimed to determine the occurrence and the characteristics of
   MRSA isolated from 3760 samples of milk and dairy products in a previous
   survey conducted in southern Italy during 2008-2014. Overall out of 484
   S. aureus strains isolated, 40 (8.3\%) were MRSA and were characterized
   by spa-typing, Multi-Locus Sequence Typing, SCCmec typing,
   Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) genes, Panton-Valentine Leukocidin
   (PVL) genes and ability to form biofilm.
   The most frequently recovered STs were ST152 (t355-67.5\%), followed by
   ST398 (t899, t108-25\%), ST1 (t127-5\%) and ST5 (t688-2.5\%). All
   isolates harboured the SCCmec type V (92.5\%) or IVa (25\%). In one
   isolate (2.5\%), ST398/t899, the SCCmec resulted not detected. Three
   isolates (7.5\%) carried one or more enterotoxin encoding genes (one
   strain had seg, sei, sem, sen and seo genes; two strains had seh gene).
   The 50\% of isolated strains harboured PVL-encoding genes. Molecular
   analysis for icaA and icaD genes showed: 72.5\% icaA and icaD positive,
   25\% only icaD gene and one icaA and icaD negative. The detection of
   MRSA in food of animal origin is a potential health hazard, thus it is
   necessary monitoring of food producing animals and improving hygiene
   standards in food practices in order to reduce the microbiological risk
   to minimum. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an

Title = {An alternative experimental case-control design for genetic association
   studies on bovine mastitis},

Abstract = {The possibility of using genetic control strategies to increase disease
   resistance to infectious diseases relies on the identification of
   markers to include in the breeding plans. Possible incomplete exposure
   of mastitis-free (control) animals, however, is a major issue to find
   relevant markers in genetic association studies for infectious diseases.
   Usually, designs based on elite dairy sires are used in association
   studies, but an epidemiological case-control strategy, based on cows
   repeatedly field-tested could be an alternative for disease traits. To
   test this hypothesis, genetic association results obtained in the
   present work from a cohort of Italian Holstein cows tested for mastitis
   over time were compared with those from a previous genome-wide scan on
   Italian Holstein sires genotyped with 50k single nucleotide
   polymorphisms for de-regressed estimated breeding values for somatic
   cell counts (SCCs) on Bos taurus autosome (BTA6) and BTA14. A total of
   1121 cows were selected for the case-control approach (cases=550,
   controls=571), on a combination of herd level of SCC incidence and of
   within herd individual level of SCC. The association study was conducted
   on nine previously identified markers, six on BTA6 and four on BTA14,
   using the R statistical environment with the qtscore' function of the
   GenABEL package, on high/low adjusted linear score as a binomial trait.
   The results obtained in the cow cohort selected on epidemiological
   information were in agreement with those obtained from the previous sire
   genome-wide association study (GWAS). Six out of the nine markers showed
   significant association, four on BTA14 (rs109146371, rs109234250,
   rs109421300, rs109162116) and two on BTA6 (rs110527224 and rs42766480).
   Most importantly, using mastitis as a case study, the current work
   further validated the alternative use of historical field disease data
   in case-control designs for genetic analysis of infectious diseases in
   livestock.},

Title = {Dietary administration of EDC mixtures: A focus on fish lipid metabolism},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2017},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Many man-made chemical compounds are recognized as endocrine disruptors
   and once released into the environment are likely to spread and
   bioaccumulate in wild species. Due to their lipophilic nature, these
   substances pass through the cell membrane or bind to specific receptors
   activating physiological responses that in the long run can cause
   reproductive impairment, physiological disorders, including the
   occurrence of metabolic syndromes. One significant source of
   contamination is represented by the consumption of polluted food. As a
   consequence, different environmental pollutants, with similar or
   different modes of action, can accumulate in organisms and biomagnify
   along the food web, finally targeting humans. The aim of this study was
   to analyze, under controlled conditions, the effects induced by the
   consumption of contaminated diets, focusing on the effects exerted at
   hepatic level. Juvenile seabream were fed for 21 days a diet enriched
   with different combinations of pollutants, nonylphenol (NP),
   tert-octylphenol (t-OP) and bisphenol A (BPA). The different diets
   containing 5 mg/kg bw of each contaminant, were formulated as follows:
   NP+ tOP, BPA+NP, BPA+ tOP and NP+BPA+ tOP (NBC). EDCs, at the doses
   administered, showed low biomagnification factor (BMF), suggesting that
   these pollutants hardly accumulate in muscles. The results obtained at
   hepatic level pinpointed the steatotic effect of all the administered
   diets, associated to a modulation of the expression of genes involved in
   lipid metabolism (ppars, fas, lpl, and hsl). Results were compared to
   those obtained in previous studies in which fish were fed single
   pollutants evidencing that the administration of mixture of contaminants
   exerts a milder lipogenic effect, highlighting the
   contrasting/antagonistic interaction establishing among chemicals.
   Noteworthy was the setup of a new chromatographic method to detect the
   presence of the selected chemical in fish muscle and the application of
   Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) analysis to evaluate
   pollutant-induced changes in the liver macromolecular building. (C) 2017

Abstract = {Edema disease (ED), caused by Escherichia coli has a huge economic
   impact on swine breeding. The capability to colonize hosts and survive
   in the environment is linked to biofilm formation. Biofilm is defined as
   a structured community of bacterial cells enclosed in a self-produced
   polymer matrix that is attached to a surface. Bacteria within biofilms
   can withstand host immune responses, and are much less susceptible to
   antibiotics and to disinfectants when compared with their planktonic
   counterparts. Many bacterial surface structures, including curli,
   flagella, pili and exopolysaccharide, play a role in various aspects of
   biofilm development. In this study we have examined the biofilm
   formation in 65 E. coli field strains, isolated from ED affected pigs.
   Using phenotypic assays, curli fimbriae and cellulose, two extracellular
   structures contributing to biofilm formation were investigated. Results
   showed that 23\% of the strains were classified as strong biofilm
   producers while 71\% were regarded as weak biofilm producers. All the
   O-138 serotypes were weak producers, while the majority (73\%) of the
   O-139 types were strong biofilm producer strains. Moreover, there is a
   different expression of both the studied structures, at the two tested
   temperatures. Noteworthy, 75\% of the E. coli strains isolated during
   episodes of ED produced curli fimbriae at 37 degrees C. A significant
   association has been observed between the O-type and the production of
   the biofilm and a significant difference in the morphotype results was
   observed on the basis of the used temperature. Our observations reveal
   E. coli from ED are biofilm formers, with different expression of the
   both studied structures, which may be linked to a role in virulence.},

Title = {Risk Assessment of Human Listeriosis from Semisoft Cheeses Made from Raw
   Sheep's Milk in Lazio and Tuscany (Italy)},
Journal = {RISK ANALYSIS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {37},
Number = {4},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Semisoft cheese made from raw sheep's milk is traditionally and
   economically important in southern Europe. However, raw milk cheese is
   also a known vehicle of human listeriosis and contamination of sheep
   cheese with Listeria monocytogenes has been reported. In the present
   study, we have developed and applied a quantitative risk assessment
   model, based on available evidence and challenge testing, to estimate
   risk of invasive listeriosis due to consumption of an artisanal sheep
   cheese made with raw milk collected from a single flock in central
   Italy. In the model, contamination of milk may originate from the farm
   environment or from mastitic animals, with potential growth of the
   pathogen in bulk milk and during cheese ripening. Based on the 48-day
   challenge test of a local semisoft raw sheep's milk cheese we found
   limited growth only during the initial phase of ripening (24 hours) and
   no growth or limited decline during the following ripening period. In
   our simulation, in the baseline scenario, 2.2\% of cheese servings are
   estimated to have at least 1 colony forming unit (CFU) per gram. Of
   these, 15.1\% would be above the current E.U. limit of 100 CFU/g (5.2\%
   would exceed 1,000 CFU/g). Risk of invasive listeriosis per random
   serving is estimated in the 10(-12) range (mean) for healthy adults, and
   in the 10(-10) range (mean) for vulnerable populations. When small
   flocks (10-36 animals) are combined with the presence of a sheep with
   undetected subclinical mastitis, risk of listeriosis increases and such
   flocks may represent a public health risk.},

Abstract = {Ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) are ectoparasites infesting livestock in every
   geographic area in the world and they are vectors of several viral,
   bacterial, and protozoan pathogens to animals and humans worldwide. A
   deep knowledge of the geographical distribution of these arthropods
   would have a key role in the control of tick-borne diseases. Few data
   are available about tick presence in domestic ruminants in Lebanon. The
   study aimed at providing an analysis of tick presence and distribution
   in Lebanon. Ticks were collected from cattle, sheep, and goats farms
   distributed in 6 Lebanese provinces between June and September 2014. A
   total of 272 adult hard ticks were randomly collected from domestic
   ruminants (cattle, sheep, and goats) located at 37 Lebanese farms,
   distributed among 30 villages. Ticks belonged to 4 Ixodidae genera:
   Rhipicephalus (72.4\%), Haemaphysalis (11.4\%), Dermacentor (8.1\%), and
   Hyalomma (8.1\%). They included the following species: Rhipicephalus
   annulatus (50.7\%), Rhipicephalus turanicus (18.8\%), Hyalomma
   anatolicum (8.1\%), Haemaphylasis punctata (11.4\%), Dermacentor
   marginatus (8.1\%), Rhipicephalus sanguineus (2.5\%), and Rhipicephalus
   bursa (0.4\%). Rhipicephalus turanicus and H. anatolicum were found on
   cattle, sheep, and goats, R. annulatus on cattle and sheep, R.
   sanguineus, D. marginatus and Hea. punctata on sheep and goats, while R.
   bursa was collected only on sheep. Tick species involved in pathogen
   transmission were found and some of the identified species were recorded
   in Lebanon for the first time.},

Title = {Management of an outbreak of bovine tuberculosis in a mixed goat and

Abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a chronic contagious disease caused by
   Mycobacterium bovis (Mb), which have wide host range in mammalian
   species, man included. In Italy, bTB is subjected to eradication
   programs in cattle, that could lead many regions to acquire Officially
   bovine Tuberculosis Free status (OTF), as recently occurred to Piedmont
   too {[}Execution of Decision (EU) 2016/168 of the Commission of 5
   February 2016]. Among the causes that may contribute to the persistence
   of bTB in cattle it is recognized the infection of other susceptible
   species such as goats, whose role in transmission and maintenance of
   infection in mixed herd is reported in many European Countries,
   including Italy.
   bTB in goats often occurs in subclinical forms, but it is associated to
   severe gross pathological lesions with a relative high risk of Mb
   environmental spread and negative impact on the eradication programs.
   Surveillance in goats is not mandatory, except for raw milk producers
   (Reg. CE n. 853/2004 del Parlamento Europeo) or outbreak occurrence
   suspect (D.M. n. 592 del 15/12/1995) and this leads to a lack of data on
   the role of goat in the epidemiology of bTB.
   This case report describes the diagnostic procedure adopted for the
   management of an outbreak of bTB in a Piedmont herd, in which both
   cattle and goats were reared. The diagnostic protocol included
   intra-vitam tests as gamma interferon tests (Bovigam((R))), Tuberculin
   Skin Test and indirect Elisa (IDEXX M. bovis Ab Test) and post-mortem
   exams as gross pathology, histopathology, microbiology and molecular
   tests (Spoligotyping and VNTR typing of isolated strains). On the basis
   of the intra-vitam test 13 cattle was declared infected and slaughtered
   highlighting typical lesions in 10 animals.
   Gamma interferon testing was extended to goats allowing to identify a
   positive animal that showed advanced lesions later at slaughter.
   Spoligotyping and VNTR typing identified the same strain type isolated
   from cattle (SB0134 VNTR 54534), confirming interspecific transmission.
   Due to high prevalence of infection, severity of observed lesions and
   inter-species bTB transmission, stamping out procedure was proposed and
   approved from Veterinary Services to extinguish the outbreak. Based on
   epidemiological analysis in this bTB outbreak, infection in small
   ruminants was fortuitous, even if the goat could have been represented a
   potential source of infection. The decision to extend intra-vitam tests
   to goats resulted conclusive for the extinction of the bTB outbreak.
   Therefore an epidemiological investigation conjugated to an appropriate
   diagnostic management represent the best ground for all actions targeted
   to the eradication of bTB outbreaks, especially in an area qualified as
   OTF.},

Abstract = {Demineralized bone matrix (DBM) is a natural, collagen-based,
   osteoinductive biomaterial. Nevertheless, there are conflicting reports
   on the efficacy of this product. The purpose of this study was to
   evaluate whether DBM collagen structure is affected by particle size and
   can influence DBM cytocompatibility and osteoinductivity. Sheep cortical
   bone was ground and particles were divided in three fractions with
   different sizes, defined as large (L, 1-2 mm), medium (M, 0.5-1 mm), and
   small (S, <0.5 mm). After demineralization, the chemical-physical
   analysis clearly showed a particle size-dependent alteration in collagen
   structure, with DBM-M being altered but not as much as DBM-S. DBM-M
   displayed a preferable trend in almost all biological characteristics
   tested, although all DBM particles revealed an optimal
   cytocompatibility. Subcutaneous implantation of DBM particles into
   immunocompromised mice resulted in bone induction only for DBM-M. When
   sheep MSC were seeded onto particles before implantation, all DBM
   particles were able to induce new bone formation with the best incidence
   for DBM-M and DBM-S. In conclusion, the collagen alteration in DBM-M is
   likely the best condition to promote bone induction in vivo.
   Furthermore, the choice of 0.5-1 mm particles may enable to obtain more
   efficient and consistent results among different research groups in bone
   tissue-engineering applications. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {Feed mill workers may handle or process maize contaminated with
   aflatoxins (AFs). This condition may lead to an unacceptable intake of
   toxins deriving from occupational exposure. This study assessed the
   serological and urinary levels of AFs in workers exposed to potentially
   contaminated dusts in two mills. From March to April 2014, blood and
   urine samples were collected, on Monday and Friday morning of the same
   working week from 29 exposed workers and 30 non-exposed controls. AFs
   (M-1, G(2), G(1), B-1, B-2) and aflatoxicol (AFOH) A were analyzed. Each
   subject filled in a questionnaire to evaluate potential food-borne
   exposures to mycotoxins. AFs contamination in environmental dust was
   measured in both plants. No serum sample was found to be positive.
   Seventy four percent of urine samples (73.7\%) revealed AFM(1) presence.
   AFM1 mean concentration was 0.035 and 0.027 ng/mL in exposed and
   non-exposed workers, respectively (p = 0.432); the concentration was
   slightly higher in Friday's than in Monday's samples, in exposed
   workers, 0.040 versus (vs.) 0.031 and non-exposed controls (0.030 vs.
   0.024, p = 0.437). Environmental AFs contamination ranged from 7.2 to
   125.4 mu g/kg. The findings of this study reveal the presence of higher
   AFs concentration in exposed workers than in non-exposed controls,
   although these differences are to be considered consistent with random
   fluctuations.},

Abstract = {A new method for simultaneous determination of five bisphenols in canned
   energy drinks by UPLC with fluorescence detection, after clean up on
   molecularly imprinted polymers, is herein described. The method was
   validated at two concentration levels, calculating trueness,
   repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility, specificity,
   linearity of detector response, the limits of quantifications and the
   limits of detection for each bisphenol. The method is specific, reliable
   and very sensitive, allowing for determination of bisphenol F diglycidyl
   ether (BFDGE), bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol B (BPB), bisphenol F (BPF)
   and bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) down to 0.50 ng/mL; it was
   employed to determine contamination levels from these bisphenols in
   forty energy drinks of different brands, collected from the market in
   Naples. BPA was detected in 17 out of 40 samples (42.5\%); in some
   energy drinks also BPF, BADGE and BFDGE were determined. (C) 2016

Title = {Morphological and molecular characterization of four Sarcocystis spp.,
   including Sarcocystis linearis n. sp., from roe deer (Capreolus
   capreolus) in Italy},
Journal = {PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {116},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Fresh (frozen/thawed) muscle samples from four 2-12-year-old roe deer
   (Capreolus capreolus) from the Sondrio province in north-eastern Italy
   were examined under a dissecting microscope, and about 180 sarcocysts
   were isolated and identified to morphological type in wet mounts by
   light microscopy (LM). Seventy-seven of these sarcocysts were
   subsequently examined by molecular methods, comprising polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing of the partial cytochrome c
   oxidase subunit I gene (cox1) of all isolates, as well as PCR
   amplification, cloning and sequencing of the complete18S ribosomal RNA
   (rRNA) gene of two isolates of each species found. By LM, three major
   sarcocyst types were recognised: spindle-shaped sarcocysts, 0.5-3 mm
   long, either with no clearly recognisable protrusions (thin-walled) or
   with finger-like protrusions (thick-walled); and slender, thread-like
   sarcocysts, 2-3 mm long, with hair-like protrusions. Sequencing of cox1
   revealed that the sarcocysts belonged to four different species. Those
   with no visible protrusions either belonged to Sarcocystis gracilis (n =
   24) or to a Sarcocystis taeniata-like species (n = 19), whereas those
   with finger- and hair-like protrusions belonged to Sarcocystis silva (n
   = 27) and Sarcocystis capreolicanis (n = 7), respectively. The 19 cox1
   sequences of the S. taeniata-like species, comprising five haplotypes,
   differed from each other at 0-16 of 1038 nucleotide positions
   (98.5-100\% identity). They differed from 25 previous cox1 sequences of
   S. taeniata from moose and sika deer (with 98.0-100\% intraspecific
   identity), at 33-43 nucleotide positions (95.9-96.8\% interspecific
   identity), and there were 20 fixed nucleotide differences between the
   two populations. In the phylogenetic analysis based on cox1 sequences,
   the two populations formed two separate monophyletic clusters. The S.
   taeniata-like species in roe deer was therefore considered to represent
   a separate species, which was named Sarcocystis linearis n. sp. At the
   18S rRNA gene, however, the two species could not be clearly separated
   from each other. Thus, there was considerable intraspecific sequence
   variation in the 18S rRNA gene of S. linearis (98.1-99.9\% identity
   between 24 sequences), which was similar both in magnitude and nature to
   the variation previously found in this gene of S. taeniata. The new 18S
   rRNA gene sequences of S. linearis shared an identity of 97.9-99.6\%
   with those of S. taeniata (overlap between intra- and interspecific
   identity), and in the phylogenetic tree, sequences of the two species
   were interspersed. By scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the sarcocysts
   of S. linearis were found to possess regularly spaced, thin and narrow
   ribbon-like cyst wall protrusions (about 2.8-3.2 mu m long, 0.3-0.4 mu m
   wide and about 0.02-0.03 mu m thick), terminating in a plate-like
   structure of the same thickness but with an elliptic outline (about
   0.3-0.4 mu m wide and 0.7-0.9 mu m long). The terminal plates were
   connected in the middle with the band-like portion of the protrusions
   like the board of a seesaw (tilting board). The terminal plates of
   adjacent protrusions were neatly arranged in a hexagonal pattern
   resembling tiles on a roof. Together, they formed an outer roof-like
   layer facing the surrounding cytoplasm of the host cell and completely
   covering the band-like proximal portion of the protrusions, which
   overlapped and were stacked in three to four layers close to the cyst
   surface. The sarcocyst morphology of S. linearis was consistent with
   that of an unnamed Sarcocystis sp.
   in roe deer previously found by transmission electron microscopy in
   several countries, including Italy. A few sarcocysts of S. gracilis and
   S. silva were also examined by SEM, confirming the presence of regularly
   distributed, short knob-like protrusions in S. gracilis (as seen in
   previous SEM studies) and revealing tightly packed, erect 6-7-mu m-long
   villus-like protrusions having regularly distributed round depressions
   on their surface in S. silva. The sequencing of cox1 of 7, 24 and 27 new
   isolates of S. capreolicanis, S. gracilis and S. silva, respectively,
   recovered 7, 11 and 10 new haplotypes from each of the three species and
   expanded our knowledge on the intraspecific sequence variation at this
   marker. Similarly, the study revealed a more extensive intragenomic
   sequence variation at the 18S rRNA gene of S. capreolicanis and S. silva
   than known from previous studies and confirmed a near absence of such
   variation in the 18S rRNA gene of S. gracilis.},

Abstract = {The worldwide consumption of meat is increasing, especially in
   developing countries. Many studies have correlated a diet characterised
   by high intake of processed red meats with a risk of colorectal cancer,
   stroke, coronary heart diseases and diabetes. Moreover, the quality and
   safety of meat products may be compromised by several admitted and not
   admitted procedures (i.e. addition of food additives and/or foreign
   proteins). For these reasons, the topic meat products' quality and
   safety' has gained much in importance during last few years. In this
   review, the recent advances in the field of analytical methods for the
   evaluation of meat adulteration due to the addition of foreign proteins
   and food additives are reported, compared and critically evaluated.
   Moreover, the most representative monitoring practices, developed
   worldwide, related to meats adulteration are described and discussed.},

Abstract = {Campylobacter spp. are ubiquitous bacteria and campylobacteriosis is the
   most frequently reported zoonotic disease in humans in Europe, since
   2005. Handling or consuming contaminated/undercooked meat (especially
   poultry) are the most important sources of human campylobacteriosis.
   However, in recent years, the role of dogs as a source of infection for
   humans has been amply demonstrated. Approximately 6\% of human
   campylobacteriosis cases are due to contact with pets. This review
   analyses the current literature related to risk factors at the dog-human
   interface.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal Analysis of African Swine Fever in Sardinia (2012-2014):
   Trends in Domestic Pigs and Wild Boar},
Journal = {TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {64},

Pages = {656-662},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {African swine fever (ASF) is a notifiable viral disease affecting
   domestic pigs and wild boars that has been endemic in Sardinia since
   1978. Several risk factors complicate the control of ASF in Sardinia:
   generally poor level of biosecurity, traditional breeding practices,
   illegal behaviour in movements and feeding of pigs, and sporadic
   occurrence of long-term carriers. A previous study describes the disease
   in Sardinia during 1978-2013. The aim of this study was to gain more
   in-depth knowledge of the spatio-temporal pattern of ASF in Sardinia
   during 2012 to May 2014, comparing patterns of occurrence in domestic
   pigs and wild boar and identifying areas of local transmission. African
   swine fever notifications were studied considering seasonality, spatial
   autocorrelation, spatial point pattern and spatio-temporal clusters.
   Results showed differences in temporal and spatial pattern of wild boar
   and domestic pig notifications. The peak in wild boar notifications
   (October 2013 to February 2014) occurred six months after than in
   domestic pig (May to early summer 2013). Notifications of cases in both
   host species tended to be clustered, with a maximum significant distance
   of spatial association of 15 and 25 km in domestic pigs and wild boars,
   respectively. Five clusters for local ASF transmission were identified
   for domestic pigs, with a mean radius and duration of 4 km (3-9 km) and
   38 days (655 days), respectively. Any wild boar clusters were found. The
   apparently secondary role of wild boar in ASF spread in Sardinia could
   be explained by certain socio-economic factors (illegal free-range pig
   breeding or the mingling of herds. The lack of effectiveness of previous
   surveillance and control programmes reveals the necessity of employing a
   new approach). Results present here provide better knowledge of the
   dynamics of ASF in Sardinia, which could be used in a more comprehensive
   risk analysis necessary to introduce a new approach in the eradication
   strategy.},

Abstract = {Dermestidae and Tenebrionidae are well known inhabitants of bird's nests
   and poultry farms, under favourable conditions they can be very abundant
   under favourable conditions. At times, their larvae shift from a
   scavenging behaviour to a parasitic/predatory one, entering nestling's
   plumage and feeding on skin and feathers, and finally provoking skin
   damages and blood losses. These episodes mainly involve species of the
   genus Dermestes, but the tenebrionid Alphitobius diaperinus h also been
   reported to be responsible of similar cases. In June 2014, a mortality
   of caged young pigeons occurred in a family farm in Central Italy.
   Post-mortem examination of 1 of the dead nestlings revealed the
   presence, near the cloacal orifice, of a triangular shaped hole of about
   1 cm side, with rounded edges facing inward and with bleeding from the
   cavity. Five coleoptera larvae 0.5-2 cm long were collected from the
   edges of the hole. Bacteriological examination of liver, intestine, and
   lungs revealed the presence of Escherichia coli in the lung samples. The
   5 larvae were morphologically identified as Dermestes bicolor (4) and
   Alphitobius diaperinus (1). This is the first reported case of pigeon
   nestling's mortality caused by Dermestidae and Tenebrionidae larvae
   acting as parasites/predators in Italy.},

Abstract = {Usutu (USUV) and West Nile (WNV) are mosquito-borne Flavivirus emerged
   in Italy in 1996 and 1998, respectively, and reappeared 10 years later.
   The aim of this work is to review the Italian mosquito species found
   positive for WNV and USUV between 2008 and 2014. Moreover, the role of
   mosquitoes in promoting the overwintering of these viruses is discussed,
   as a result of the mosquito collections performed in Molise region
   between September 2010 and April 2011. Overall 99,000 mosquitoes were
   collected: 337 and 457 mosquito pools tested positive by real time
   reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (real time RT-PCR) for
   WNV and USUV, respectively. West Nile virus was detected in pools of
   Culex pipiens s.l. (329), Ochlerotatus caspius (4), Culex modestus (2),
   and Culex spp. (2). Positive USUV pools were from Cx. pipiens s.l.
   (435), Aedes albopictus (12), Oc. caspius (5), Culex spp. (2), Anopheles
   maculipennis s.l. (1), Culiseta annulata (1), and Ochlerotatus detritus
   (1). In Molise region, 1,694 mosquitoes were collected, and USUV was
   identified in Cx. pipiens s.l., Cs. annulata, and Oc. detritus pools.
   This paper shows that Cx. pipiens s.l. is the mosquito species most
   involved in the WNV and USUV circulation in Italy, although other
   species would also support the spread of both the viruses during Winter.},

Abstract = {Cadmium is a highly toxic heavy metal with negative effects on oocyte
   fertilization. The aim of this study was to analyse whether
   cadmium-induced impairment of fertilization is caused by mitochondria
   dysfunction and oxidative stress in the cumulus-oocyte complex (COC).
   Preliminarily, 19 trace element levels were measured in ovaries from
   juvenile and adult ewes and age-related cadmium ovarian bioaccumulation
   at nanomolar concentrations was found. COCs from juvenile and adult
   ewes, exposed during in vitro maturation to 1 nM or 100 nM CdCl2, and
   subjected to in vitro fertilization showed significantly lower
   fertilization rates in exposed COCs compared with controls. In vitro
   matured exposed and control COCs underwent confocal microscopy analysis
   of mitochondria activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and
   lipid peroxidation (LPO) assay at cumulus cell and oocyte level. In both
   age groups, cadmium at nanomolar concentrations induced cumulus-oocyte
   mitochondria over-activity and oxidative damage which were related to
   impaired oocyte fertilization. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {All livestock transport within the European Union must comply with the
   EC Regulation 1/2005. For sheep, this law prescribes a maximum journey
   of 29 hours after which animals must rest in control posts (CP) for 24
   hours before further transportation. However, there is no scientific
   evidence defining the effects of different stop duration on sheep
   recovery during long journeys. The aim of this study was to assess if a
   shorter stop could be provided without impairing ewes' welfare.
   Ninety-six adult ewes were divided into 4 homogenous groups. One group
   stayed at the farm (control) and the other 3 were transported for 29
   hours (long-transport, LT), stopped at CP for different times (8 hours
   (S8 group); 16 hours (S16 group); 24 hours (S24 group)) and were
   re-transported for 6 hours (short-transport, ST). Blood and saliva were
   collected to assess dehydration, muscular damage, and adrenocortical
   stress before departure, after LT, after the stop, and after ST. The LT
   affected the hydration of all transported groups (i.e. higher
   BUN/creatinine levels than controls, p < 0.001), but basal values were
   restored after the ST, regardless of the stop duration. After the ST, S8
   group had higher muscular damage than the other groups (p < 0.05). No
   differences in stress level were observed. These results suggest that,
   in this trial, ewe's welfare was not impaired by a stop reduction from
   24 hours to 16 hours.},

Abstract = {The expression of CYP4F2, a form of cytochrome P-450 with proposed role
   in a-tocopherol and long -chain fatty acid metabolism, was explored in
   HepG2 and HepaRG human hepatocytes during ethanol toxicity.
   Cytotoxicity, ROS production, and,INK and ERK1/2 kinase signaling
   increased in a dose and time -dependent manner during ethanol
   treatments; CYP4F2 gene expression decreased, while other CYP4F forms,
   namely 4F11 and 12, increased along with 3A4 and 2E1 isoforms.
   a.-Tocopherol antagonized the cytotoxicity and CYP4F2 gene repression
   effect of ethanol in HepG2 cells. Ethanol stimulated the
   tocopherol-omega-hydroxylase activity and the other steps of vitamin E
   metabolism, which points to a minor role of CYP4F2 in this metabolism of
   human hepatocytes. PPAR-gamma and SREBP-lc followed the same expression
   pattern of CYP4F2 in response to ethanol and a-tocopherol treatments.
   Moreover, the pharmacological inhibition of PPAR-gamma synergized with
   ethanol in decreasing CYP4F2 protein expression, which suggests a role
   of this nuclear receptor in CYP4F2 transcriptional regulation. In
   conclusion, ethanol toxicity modifies the CYP expression pattern of
   human hepatic cells impairing CYP4F2 transcription and protein
   expression. These changes were associated with a lowered expression of
   the fatty acid biosynthesis regulators PPAR-gamma and SREBP-1c, and with
   an increased enzymatic catabolism of vitamin E. CYP4F2 gene repression
   and a sustained vitamin E metabolism appear to be independent effects of
   ethanol toxicity in human hepatocytes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of two different
   conditions of space allowance on reproductive performance and oxidative
   parameters, biochemical and hormonal profiles in buffalo. The trial was
   carried out on one hundred pluriparous buffaloes divided into two
   different groups. Buffaloes in group HDG (high density group - n = 50)
   were maintained in open yards that allowed 10 m(2)/head while those in
   group LDG (low density group -n = 50) were maintained in 22 m(2)/head.
   After 60 days, 45 buffaloes in each group underwent synchronization of
   ovulation by Ovsynch and were artificially inseminated to assess the
   reproductive efficiency. On the day of AI blood samples were collected
   to evaluate oxidative stress, hormonal and metabolic profile.
   Furthermore, on the same day, blood, saliva and hair samples were
   collected to assess cortisol levels. Simultaneously, five
   buffaloes/group, were synchronized but not inseminated and on the day of
   the hypothetical timed artificial insemination (TAI), follicular fluid
   was recovered by OPU and blood samples were collected from each animal
   to evaluate the redox status on both plasma and follicular fluid.
   Conception rate on day 70 post-AI was similar between the two groups
   (57.5 vs. 62.5\%, in LDG and HDG, respectively). No significant
   differences were found on redox status, metabolic and hormonal profile
   and cortisol levels between the groups. In conclusion, on the conditions
   of this experiment it was observed that the space allowance of 10
   m(2)/head did not affect reproductive efficiency in buffalo cows.},

Abstract = {Sudan dyes are synthetic azo dyes used by industry in a variety of
   applications. Classified as carcinogenic, they are not allowed in
   foodstuffs; however, their presence as adulterants in food products has
   been regularly reported. Here, we describe an innovative screening
   method to detect Sudan I, II, ill, and IV in tomato sauce, palm oil, and
   chilli powder. The method entails minimal sample preparation, completely
   avoiding the liquid chromatography phase, followed by detection and
   identification through atmospheric pressure chemical ionization
   time-of-flight mass spectrometry, in positive ionization mode. Analytes
   were efficiently identified and detected in samples, fortified both with
   individual analytes and with their mixture, with an error in mass
   identification less than 5 ppm. Limits of identification of the analytes
   in the fortified samples were 0.5 to 1 mg/kg, depending on the dye and
   matrix. The method had a linear range of 0.05 to 5 mg/kg and good linear
   relationships (R-2 > 0.98). Repeatability was satisfactory, with a
   coefficient of variation lower than 20\%. The method was applied to
   detect the dyes in real adulterated chilli samples, previously found
   positive by confirmatory high-performance liquid chromatography mass
   spectrometry and ELISA, and in commercial products purchased from
   supermarkets. In all positive samples, analytes were correctly
   identified with an error in mass identification lower than 5 ppm, while
   none of the 45 commercial samples analyzed were found to be
   contaminated. The proposed new assay is sensitive, with a limit of
   identification, for all the three matrices, complying with the limits
   defined by the European Union (0.5 to 1 mg/kg) for analytical methods.
   Compared with conventional methods, the new assay is rapid and
   inexpensive and characterized by a high throughput; thus, it could be
   suitable as screening technique to identify Sudan dyes in adulterated
   food products.},

Abstract = {Retail poultry meat is a crucial vehicle for consumers' exposure to
   Campylobacters, but no official controls are currently applied in Italy.
   The aim of this study was the evaluation of Campylobacter contamination
   of a wide range of poultry meats marketed in Italy. N. 472 chicken and
   turkey meat samples (sectioned meats, offal, meat preparations and
   products) were taken from slaughterhouses, deboning plants and different
   retailers and submitted to detection/enumeration of Campylobacter.spp.
   The isolates were identified by phenotypic and biomolecular techniques.
   Campylobacter spp. was detected in 34.1\% of the samples, with general
   low counts. Higher values were observed in offal (especially liver) and
   sectioned meats, with significantly higher rates in skin-on samples
   (86.8\% vs 32.7\%). Minced meat preparations showed lower prevalence
   (22.4\% vs 58.3\%) and counts than whole pieces. Decreasing rates were
   observed among slaughterhouses (80\%), deboning plants (49\%), butcher's
   shops (37\%) and large scale retailers (25\%). Sectioned chicken meats
   were significantly more contaminated than turkey meats. Almost all the
   isolates were identified as C. jejuni or C. coli, with similar
   prevalences (18.4\% and 20.5\%, respectively); C. jejuni was predominant
   only in samples from slaughterhouses/deboning plants. For setting future
   control programs, meat typology should be considered the main critical
   factor. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Consumers' perceptions of food risks: A snapshot of the Italian
   Triveneto area},
Journal = {APPETITE},

Volume = {111},

Abstract = {This study investigated the food risk perceptions of people living in
   the Triveneto area (Northeast Italy), a territory characterized by a
   particular interest in the production of quality foodstuffs, to
   determine what aspects people associate with food risk and to understand
   what beliefs underlie these perceptions.
   Four focus groups were conducted in the major towns of the target area
   (N = 45). A semi-structured interview was used that focused on beliefs
   about food risks, the use of information and media sources in relation
   to food risk, and the behaviours adopted when eating outside the home.
   A homogeneous view of food risk emerged among the respondents, and a
   common definition of risky food was identified. The concept of risk was
   in opposition to the quality and controllability of food, which emerged
   as major strategies to cope with food risks. Quality was linked to
   freshness and local origin, whereas controllability reflected a direct
   (e.g., checking labels, having a relationship with the vendor,
   cultivating one's own vegetable garden) or indirect (e.g., control
   guarantees provided by suppliers and the government) means to check the
   safety and quality of food. Although people seemed quite informed about
   food risks, a common sense of impotence with regard to one's own
   protection prevailed, together with a fatalistic sense of incomplete
   control over risk.
   The results identified food concerns for consumers living in this
   specific territory and might represent a starting point for public
   health authorities to increase compliance with responsible behaviours
   for risk mitigation and to define successful food policies for this
   area. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In Italy buffalo farms adopted intensive breeding techniques, however
   the high density of animals in intensive breeding favours the diffusion
   of ectoparasites, such as louse.
   The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro efficacy of the
   insecticide alphacypermethrin (ACYP) against the buffalo louse,
   Haematopinus tuberculatus. The study was performed by using louse
   collected from animals in a commercial buffalo farm located in the
   Campania region of Southern Italy. Lice (adults and nymphs) were
   collected from highly infested buffaloes. The ACYP was diluted with
   physiological solution to different concentrations: 1.5\%, 0.75\%,
   0.37\%. A volume of 600 mu l of the diluted sample was spread evenly
   over a filter paper held in the lower half of Petri dish. Ten adult lice
   and ten nymphs were placed on the top of each filter paper disc. The
   control groups were treated with physiological solution. Seven
   replicates were used for each concentration. The louse vitality was
   assessed at different time intervals: 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40,
   50, 60 minutes, after every 10 minutes until 240 minutes or at the louse
   death. After 240 minutes the louse vitality was examined each 60 minutes
   until 540 minutes. In vitro bioassays revealed that the lousicidal
   efficacy of ACYP improved as the concentration and the exposure time
   increased. The results of this in vitro study confirm that ACYP at 1.5\%
   concentration can also be used in buffalo for the control of lice, as
   already in use in cattle. Further field trials will need to be conducted
   to confirm the safety, the dosage and the in vivo parasitological
   efficacy of this drug on buffaloes.},

Abstract = {A total of 118 sera were collected during 2016 from two groups of
   dromedaries from Kebili and Medenine governorates in the south of
   Tunisia. The aim of this study was to provide the first serological
   investigation of four emerging vector-borne diseases in two groups of
   dromedaries in Tunisia. Sera were tested by ELISA and serum
   neutralisation test to identify West Nile virus (WNV), bluetongue virus
   (BTV), epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) and Rift Valley fever
   virus (RVFV). In the first group, the seroprevalence for BTV was 4.6\%,
   while in the second group, it was 25.8\% for WNV and 9.7\% for BTV. Only
   serotype 1 was detected for BTV in the two groups. No evidence for
   circulation of RVF and EHD viruses was revealed. Results indicated that
   dromedaries can be infected with BTV and WNV, suggesting that this
   species might play a significant role in the epizootiology of these
   viral diseases in Tunisia and neighbouring countries.},

Abstract = {Honeybees (Apis mellifera) are constantly subjected to many biotic
   stressors including parasites. This study examined honeybees infected
   with Nosema ceranae (N. ceranae). N. = ceranae infection increases the
   bees energy requirements and may contribute to their decreased survival.
   RNA-seq was used to investigate gene expression at days 5, 10 and 15
   Post Infection (P. I) with N. ceranae. The expression levels of genes,
   isoforms, alternative transcription start sites (TSS) and differential
   promoter usage revealed a complex pattern of transcriptional and
   post-transcriptional gene regulation suggesting that bees use a range of
   tactics to cope with the stress of N. ceranae infection. N. ceranae
   infection may cause reduced immune function in the bees by: (i)
   disturbing the host amino acids metabolism (ii) down-regulating
   expression of antimicrobial peptides (iii) down-regulation of cuticle
   coatings and (iv) down-regulation of odorant binding proteins.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capricolum is one of the causative agents
   of contagious agalactia (CA). Nevertheless, there is still a lack of
   information about its antimicrobial susceptibility and genetic
   characteristics. Therefore, the aim of this work was to study the
   antimicrobial and genetic variability of different Mycoplasma capricolum
   subsp. capricolum field isolates. For this purpose, the growth
   inhibition effect of 18 antimicrobials and a multilocus sequence typing
   (MLST) scheme based on five housekeeping genes (fusA, glpQ, gyrB, lepA
   and rpoB) were performed on 32 selected field isolates from Italy and
   Spain. The results showed a wide range of growth inhibitory effects for
   almost all the antimicrobials studied. Macrolides presented lower
   efficacy inhibiting Mcc growth than in previous works performed on other
   CA-causative mycoplasmas. Erythromycin was not able to inhibit the
   growth of any of the studied strains, contrary to doxycycline, which
   inhibited the growth of all of them from low concentrations. On the
   other hand, the study of the concatenated genes revealed a high genetic
   variability among the different Mcc isolates. Hence, these genetic
   variations were greater than the ones reported in prior works on other
   mycoplasma species.},

Title = {Activity of AMP2041 against human and animal multidrug resistant
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates},
Journal = {ANNALS OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY AND ANTIMICROBIALS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},
Month = {MAR 23},
Abstract = {Background: Antimicrobial resistance is a growing threat to public
   health. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a relevant pathogen causing human and
   animal infections, frequently displaying high levels of resistance to
   commonly used antimicrobials. The increasing difficulty to develop new
   effective antibiotics have discouraged investment in this area and only
   a few new antibiotics are currently under development. An approach to
   overcome antibiotic resistance could be based on antimicrobial peptides
   since they offer advantages over currently used microbicides.
   Methods: The antimicrobial activity of the synthetic peptide AMP2041 was
   evaluated against 49 P. aeruginosa clinical strains with high levels of
   antimicrobial resistance, isolated from humans (n = 19) and animals (n =
   30). In vitro activity was evaluated by a microdilution assay for lethal
   dose 90\% (LD90), while the activity over time was performed by
   time-kill assay with 12.5 mu g/ml of AMP2014. Evidences for a direct
   membrane damage were investigated on P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 reference
   strain, on animal isolate PA-VET 38 and on human isolate PA-H 24 by
   propidium iodide and on P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 by scanning electron
   microscopy.
   Results: AMP2041 showed a dose-dependent activity, with a mean (SEM)
   LD90 of 1.69 and 3.3 mu g/ml for animal and human strains, respectively.
   AMP2041 showed microbicidal activity on P. aeruginosa isolates from a
   patient with cystic fibrosis (CF) and resistance increased from first
   infection isolate (LD90 = 0.3 mu g/ml) to the mucoid phenotype (LD90 =
   10.4 mu g/ml). The time-kill assay showed a time-dependent bactericidal
   effect of AMP2041 and LD90 was reached within 20 min for all the
   strains. The stain-dead assay showed an increasing of membrane
   permeabilization and SEM analysis revealed holes, dents and bursts
   throughout bacterial cell wall after 30 min of incubation with AMP2041.
   Conclusions: The obtained results assessed for the first time the good
   antimicrobial activity of AMP2041 on P. aeruginosa strains of human
   origin, including those deriving from a CF patient. We confirmed the
   excellent antimicrobial activity of AMP2041 on P. aeruginosa strains
   derived from dog otitis. We also assessed that AMP2041 antimicrobial
   activity is linked to changes of the P. aeruginosa cell wall morphology
   and to the increasing of membrane permeability.},

Abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes causes invasive syndromes with high fatality
   rates in specific population groups. Cheeses have been commonly
   implicated in outbreaks worldwide. Gorgonzola is a cheese only produced
   in Northwestern Italy (it is the third Italian cheese in terms of
   production and export) and L. monocytogenes is frequently isolated from
   the production chain. The aims of this study were to assess the
   distribution of L monocytogenes Virulence Types (VTs) in isolates
   collected in Gorgonzola processing plants and to determine the presence
   of Epidemic Clones (ECs). Fifty-Six L. monocytogenes strains collected
   between 2004 and 2016 from cheese and environmental samples were
   subtyped with Multi-Virulence-Locus Sequence Typing (MVLST) and compared
   to previously typed strains. Most isolates (eta = 50) belonged to two
   new VTs (Vr113 arid VT114). The remaining isolates belonged to
   previously identified VTs: VT14-ECVIII (milk chocolate outbreak, 1994,
   USA) and VT80 (ricotta salata outbreak, 2012, USA). VT14, VT80 and VT113
   were shared with isolates from apparently sporadic human cases in the
   same geographical area and temporal period (Piedmont and Lombardy,
   2005-2016). The overall L. monocytogenes population appears to be
   homogeneous and may be characteristic of Gorgonzola production.
   Nevertheless, the detection in cheese and environmental samples of VTs
   observed in clinical isolates or outbreak related strains (VT80, VT14)
   contributed to better describe the current scenario and pointed out the
   need for increased surveillance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {A total of 162 samples of bivalve molluscs (45 mussels and 117 clams)
   collected between December 2012 and 2014 from harvesting areas of the
   Central Adriatic were analysed by a culturing method for the presence of
   Arcobacter spp. Species identification was performed by PCR and
   sequencing analysis of a fragment of the rpoB gene. Overall, Arcobacter
   species were detected in 30\% of samples, specifically 33\% clams and
   22\% mussels. A. butzleri was the most common species (20\% of the
   samples), followed by A. cryaerophilus (9\%) and A. skirrowii (1\%). A
   seasonal association ofA. butzleri contamination was detected. A.
   butzleri was significantly more commonly recovered from samples
   collected during the winter-spring period (29\%) than from those of the
   summer-autumn (8\%).A. cryaerophilus was cultured from 6\% to 11\% of
   the samples collected in summer-autumn and winter spring, respectively,
   but these differences were not statistically significant. A. skirrowii
   was recovered from a sample of mussels harvested in May 2014. To
   identify associations between the occurrence of Arcobacter spp. and E.
   coli levels, samples were divided into groups generating results with E.
   coli at > 230 MPN/100 g and E. coli at <= 230 MPN/100 g, the latter
   corresponding to EU microbiological criteria allowed for live bivalve
   molluscs at retail level. A. butzleri was significantly more commonly
   detected in samples with higher E. colt levels (48\%) than in those with
   lower levels of E. coli (10\%), providing evidence for considering E.
   coli as an index organism for A. butzleri contamination in bivalve
   molluscs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are prevalently investigated in dogs.
   Studies on feline VBDs are scant, though feline leishmaniosis (FeL) is
   increasingly recognised as a disease of cats in endemic areas.
   Comprehensive investigations on the distribution of VBDs in populations
   of cats and dogs living in relatively small geographical areas, such as
   islands, are currently lacking. In this study the prevalence of
   Leishmania infantum and other VBD pathogens was assessed in cohorts of
   cats and dogs living in the Aeolian Islands.
   Autochthonous animals (330 cats and 263 dogs) of different age and sex
   were sampled. Blood and conjunctival samples were collected from cats
   and dogs for serological and molecular testing. Eighty-five (25.8\%)
   cats were positive for L. infantum, 13 (3.9\%) for Bartonella spp. and 1
   (0.3\%) for Hepatozoon felis. One-hundred and ten dogs (41.8\%) were
   positive for L. infantum and three (1.1\%) for Hepatozoon canis. The
   incidence of L. infantum infection in cats positive after one season of
   exposure to sand fly was 14.7\%. Leishmania infantum prevalence and year
   incidence were higher in dogs than in cats (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.0003,
   respectively). Thirty-four cats (10.3\%) scored positive for ticks (mean
   intensity rate of infestation, 2.03 +/- 1.4), which were identified to
   the species level as Ixodes ventalloi and Rhipicephalus pusillus.
   Conversely, Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (s.I.) was the only
   species identified in dogs (10.6\%). A larger prevalence of infestation
   by Ctenocephalides felis was recorded in cats (n = 91; 27.6\%) than in
   dogs (n = 33; 12.5\%) (p = 0.0001). In addition, one female Nosopsyllus
   fasciatus (syn. Ceratophyllus fasciatus) and one male Spilopsyllus
   cuniculi were also identified in flea-infected cats. VBDs are endemic in
   the Aeolian Islands being L. infantum the most prevalent vector-borne
   pathogen circulating between cats and dogs. The overall seroprevalence
   of FeL herein recorded is higher than that assessed, only by IFAT, in
   populations of cats in Greece and in Spain. Because L infantum and VBDs
   are more commonly associated with dogs, the recognition of cats as hosts
   of different vector-borne pathogens is of paramount importance towards a
   better management of these diseases in both animals and humans. (C) 2017

Abstract = {Spray-dried microparticles of a derivative of hyaluronic acid (HA) have
   been engineered to obtain a controlled aggregation with Human
   Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hMSCs) into 3D constructs. We demonstrated the
   utility of chemical functionalization of a native constituent of the
   extracellular matrix to improve processing performances and to control
   on stem cell adhesion and differentiation. Native hyaluronic acid (HA),
   cell adhesive peptides (RGD), transforming growth factor beta(3),
   dexamethasone are biological agents potentially suitable for
   chondrogenic stimulation of hMSCS. However unmodified HA suffers of
   drawbacks in terms of stability and versatility of processing.
   Functionalization strategies are needed to overcome these drawbacks. In
   this paper microparticles were produced by spray drying of an aliphatic
   and amino functionalized HA derivative. Hydrophobic derivatization of HA
   allowed the production of microparticles stabilized by physical
   crosslinking and to load and to control dexamethasone release. The
   presence of pendant amino groups was exploited to tether cyclic RGD and
   transforming growth factor beta(3) via maleimide chemistry; cyRGDC
   functionalization controlled hMSC5/microparticles aggregation.
   Chondrogenic potential was preliminary assayed by qualitative
   immunohistological detection. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},

Month = {MAR 13},
Abstract = {The calicivirus Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is widely used
   in Australia as a biocontrol agent to manage wild European rabbit
   (Oryctolagus cuniculus) populations. However, widespread herd immunity
   limits the effectiveness of the currently used strain, CAPM V-351. To
   overcome this, we developed an experimental platform for the selection
   and characterisation of novel RHDV strains. As RHDV does not replicate
   in cell culture, variant viruses were selected by serially passaging a
   highly virulent RHDV field isolate in immunologically naive laboratory
   rabbits that were passively immunised 18-24 hours post-challenge with a
   neutralising monoclonal antibody. After seven passages, two amino acid
   substitutions in the P2 domain of the capsid protein became fixed within
   the virus population. Furthermore, a synonymous substitution within the
   coding sequence of the viral polymerase appeared and was also maintained
   in all subsequent passages. These findings demonstrate proof-of-concept
   that RHDV evolution can be experimentally manipulated to select for
   virus variants with altered phenotypes, in this case partial immune
   escape.},

Abstract = {Background: Anti-Leishmania antibodies are increasingly investigated in
   cats for epidemiological studies or for the diagnosis of clinical feline
   leishmaniosis. The immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT), the
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot (WB) are the
   serological tests more frequently used. The aim of the present study was
   to assess diagnostic performance of IFAT, ELISA and WB to detect anti-L.
   infantum antibodies in feline serum samples obtained from endemic (n =
   76) and non-endemic (n = 64) areas and from cats affected by feline
   leishmaniosis (n = 21) by a Bayesian approach without a gold standard.
   Methods: Cut-offs were set at 80 titre for IFAT and 40 ELISA units for
   ELISA. WB was considered positive in presence of at least a 18 KDa band.
   Statistical analysis was performed through a written routine with MATLAB
   software in the Bayesian framework. The latent data and observations
   from the joint posterior were simulated in the Bayesian approach by an
   iterative Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique using the Gibbs sampler for
   estimating sensitivity and specificity of the three tests.
   Results: The median seroprevalence in the sample used for evaluating the
   performance of tests was estimated at 0.27 {[}credible interval (CI) =
   0.20-0.34]. The median sensitivity of the three different methods was
   0.97 (CI: 0.86-1.00), 0.75 (CI: 0.61-0.87) and 0.70 (CI: 0.56-0.83) for
   WB, IFAT and ELISA, respectively. Median specificity reached 0.99 (CI:
   0.96-1.00) with WB, 0.97 (CI: 0.93-0.99) with IFAT and 0.98 (CI:
   0.94-1.00) with ELISA. IFAT was more sensitive than ELISA (75 vs 70\%)
   for the detection of subclinical infection while ELISA was better for
   diagnosing clinical leishmaniosis when compared with IFAT (98 vs 97\%).
   Conclusions: The overall performance of all serological techniques was
   good and the most accurate test for anti-Leishmania antibody detection
   in feline serum samples was WB.},

Title = {Prevalence and molecular characterization of canine and feline
   hemotropic mycoplasmas (hemoplasmas) in northern Italy},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAR 13},
Abstract = {Background: Hemotropic mycoplasmas (hemoplasmas), the agents of
   infectious anemia, have been reported in dogs and cats. Little data are
   available on hemoplasma infections in Italy. The aim of this study was
   to evaluate the species of hemoplasmas and their prevalence in dogs and
   cats of northern Italy.
   Methods: Blood samples were obtained from 117 candidate blood donor
   dogs, 278 free-roaming dogs and 227 free-roaming cats in 2014 and 2015.
   Samples were first screened for hemoplasmas with a SYBR green real time
   PCR. The positive samples were confirmed by a second SYBR green real
   time PCR and sequencing. Co-infections were detected using
   species-specific SYBR green real time PCR.
   Results: The overall prevalence in dogs was 4.5\% (18/395). Among the
   donors only one dog was positive for Mycoplasma haemocanis (0.8\%). The
   overall prevalence of infection in free-roaming dogs was 6.1\% (17/278),
   which was significantly higher than in candidate donors (P < 0.05). Both
   M. haemocanis (13/278; 4.7\%) and ``Candidatus M. haematoparvum{''}
   (4/278; 1.4\%) were identified. In dogs, no significant association was
   found between hemoplasma infection and gender, age or origin. The
   overall prevalence in cats was 13.2\% (30/227). All three feline
   hemoplasma species were detected, i.e. ``Candidatus Mycoplasma
   haemominutum{''} (28; 12.3\%), ``Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis{''}
   (11; 4.8\%) and Mycoplasma haemofelis (9; 4.0\%). Half of the infected
   cats were co-infected (15; 6.6\%) with different species of hemoplasmas.
   Risk factor analysis confirmed that older age, male gender and FIV
   positivity are predisposing factors for hemoplasma infection in cats.
   Conclusion: This study found that candidate blood donor dogs in northern
   Italy show a negligible risk for hemoplasma infection, confirming the
   appropriateness of the candidate selection criteria and the low
   prevalence in the study area. Accordingly, testing for hemoplasma should
   be considered optional for canine blood donor screening. Hemoplasma
   infection was instead common in free-roaming cats, and is expected to be
   non-negligible in owned cats with outdoor access. Feline candidates for
   blood donation will therefore need to be carefully selected.},

Abstract = {Commercial poultry farms (n degrees 523), located in all the six regions
   of Nigeria were sampled with a view to generate baseline information
   about the distribution of Salmonella serovars in this country. Five
   different matrices (litter, dust, faeces, feed and water) were collected
   from each visited farm. Salmonella was isolated from at least one of the
   five matrices in 228 farms, with a farm prevalence of 43.6\%
   (CI95{[}39.7-48.3\%]). Altogether, 370 of 2615 samples collected
   (14.1\%, CI95{[}12.8; 15.5\%]) contained Salmonella. Considering the
   number of positive farms and the number of positive samples, it was
   evident that for the majority of the sampled farms, few samples were
   positive for Salmonella. With regard to the matrices, there was no
   difference in Salmonella prevalence among the five matrices considered.
   Of the 370 isolates serotyped, eighty-two different serotypes were
   identified and Salmonella Kentucky was identified as having the highest
   isolation rate in all the matrices sampled (16.2\%), followed by S.
   Poona and S. Elisabethville. S. Kentucky was distributed across the
   country, whereas the other less frequent serovars had a more
   circumscribed diffusion. This is one of few comprehensive studies on the
   occurrence and distribution of Salmonella in commercial chicken layer
   farms from all the six regions of Nigeria. The relatively high
   prevalence rate documented in this study may be attributed to the
   generally poor infrastructure and low biosecurity measures in
   controlling stray animals, rodents and humans. Data collected could be
   valuable for instituting effective intervention strategies for
   Salmonella control in Nigeria and also in other developing countries
   with a similar poultry industry structure, with the final aim of
   reducing Salmonella spread in animals and ultimately in humans.},

Title = {A pan-European epidemiological study reveals honey bee colony survival
   depends on beekeeper education and disease control},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 9},
Abstract = {Reports of honey bee population decline has spurred many national
   efforts to understand the extent of the problem and to identify
   causative or associated factors. However, our collective understanding
   of the factors has been hampered by a lack of joined up trans-national
   effort. Moreover, the impacts of beekeeper knowledge and beekeeping
   management practices have often been overlooked, despite honey bees
   being a managed pollinator. Here, we established a standardised active
   monitoring network for 5 798 apiaries over two consecutive years to
   quantify honey bee colony mortality across 17 European countries. Our
   data demonstrate that overwinter losses ranged between 2\% and 32\%, and
   that high summer losses were likely to follow high winter losses.
   Multivariate Poisson regression models revealed that hobbyist beekeepers
   with small apiaries and little experience in beekeeping had double the
   winter mortality rate when compared to professional beekeepers.
   Furthermore, honey bees kept by professional beekeepers never showed
   signs of disease, unlike apiaries from hobbyist beekeepers that had
   symptoms of bacterial infection and heavy Varroa infestation. Our data
   highlight beekeeper background and apicultural practices as major
   drivers of honey bee colony losses. The benefits of conducting
   trans-national monitoring schemes and improving beekeeper training are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Canine monocytic ehrlichiosis and rickettsiosis are zoonotic tick-borne
   diseases of canids caused by the intracellular obligate bacteria
   Ehrlichia canis and Rickettsia species respectively. In this study, we
   investigated using standard and real-time PCR and sequencing, the
   occurrence and molecular characterization of E. canis and Rickettsia
   species in the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) from the southern Italian
   population. Samples were screened by using molecular assays also for
   Neospora caninum, Toxoplasma gondii, Clamydophyla spp., Coxiella
   burnetii, Leishmania spp., Cryptosporidium spp., and Giardia spp.
   detection, and helminths were studied by traditional methods. Out of six
   carcasses tested, three were positive for E. canis and co-infection with
   Rickettsia sp. occurred in one of those. Sequences of the 16S rRNA E.
   canis gene were identical to each other but differed from most of those
   previously found in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and wolves (Canis lupus)
   from southern Italy. Helminths included just cystacanths of
   Sphaerirostris spp. from the intestine of two Eurasian otters and the
   nematode Angiostrongylus vasorum from the lungs of a single Eurasian
   otter. None of the samples was positive for the other investigated
   selected pathogens. This study is the first report on the evidence of
   infection by rickettsial pathogens in the Eurasian otter. The present
   result prompts some inquiries into the pathogenic role of those bacteria
   for the isolated sub-populations of the endangered Eurasian otter in
   southern Italy.},

Abstract = {Essential oils (EOs) have deserved much attention in the past decades
   for their antimicrobial activity, since many of them have demonstrated
   efficacy against food-borne pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms.
   Moreover, they have potential application in animal nutrition as
   multifunctional feed supplements, avoiding or diminishing the use of
   antibiotics in livestock. However, low solubility and bioavailability as
   well as volatility and marked aromatic note are important limitations in
   food and feed applications. In this study we present the synthesis,
   characterization and evaluation of the antibacterial activity of new
   thymol, carvacrol and menthol derivatives. The new compounds have been
   designed to overcome the limitations of the precursors, such as poor
   water solubility and volatility, still maintaining a good antimicrobial
   profile. We evaluated the activity of the synthetized compounds against
   pathogens causing important foodborne diseases, i.e. Clostridium
   perfringens, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis and
   Escherichia coli. The low Ms and MBCs values for some of the studied
   compounds, combined with water solubility and negligible cytotoxicity
   towards HT-29 human cells, confirmed the potential use for EOs
   derivatives in the food industry. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {The influence of feeding strategies on trace element bioaccumulation in

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},

Volume = {74},
Pages = {311-320},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Copepods are the most numerous taxonomic group in marine mesozooplankton
   communities. These planktonic organisms have an essential role in the
   function of marine trophic webs, as they are the link between
   phytoplankton and secondary consumers.
   The concentrations of 20 essential and non-essential trace elements were
   investigated by Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS)
   in calanoid copepods with different feeding behaviors. The sampling was
   performed in the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea, at the border between
   the Northern Tyrrhenian Sea and the Ligurian Sea (Italy). Aluminum,
   iron, zinc and copper were present in the highest concentrations in
   herbivorous calanoids (Temora stylifera, Nannocalanus minor, Neocalanus
   gracilis). Conversely, the nonessential element - arsenic - and the
   essential elements selenium and molybdenum - were present in the highest
   levels in carnivores (Pontella mediterranea, Candacia ethiopica). In the
   omnivorous copepod Centropages typicus, metal concentrations were found
   at an intermediate level between herbivores and carnivores, reflecting
   the importance of dietary pathways in metal intake and bioaccumulation.
   Finally, the bioaccumulation factors (BAFs), expressed as a ratio of the
   total metal levels in copepods compared to the seawater metal levels,
   were as follows: herbivores (83699)> omnivores (47855) > carnivores
   (41648). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) established an Emerging Risks
   Exchange Network (EREN) to exchange information between EFSA and the
   Member states (MSs) on possible emerging risks for food and feed safety
   in 2010. The Network is composed of delegates from MSs and Norway
   designated through the Advisory Forum of EFSA and observers from the
   European Commission, EU pre-accession countries, the Food and Drug
   Administration of the USA and the Food and Agricultural Organisation of
   the United Nations. Through 2010 to 2014, the EREN met 12 times. The
   EREN discussed a total of 63 signals of potential emerging issues that
   were presented and assessed using a standard template developed by the
   Emerging Risks unit of EFSA (EMRISK). Out of these signals, 39
   originated from EFSA, 24 from MSs. The issues discussed were mainly
   microbiological and chemical hazards, but also food safety issues as
   result of illegal activity, new consumer consumption trends, biotoxins,
   new technologies and processes, allergens, animal health, environmental
   pollution, new analytical methods, new food packaging technology and
   unknown hazards were on the agenda. Based on the available evidence,
   EREN recommended whether an issue should be considered emerging or not,
   and if it merited further consideration, such as generating data on the
   issue, starting a full risk assessment and/or consultation of other
   bodies. According to the emerging risks identification process set in
   place at EFSA, the issues discussed and found of relevance by EREN were
   sent to the EFSA's Scientific Committee Standing Working Group on
   Emerging Risks for final evaluation. With four case studies, i.e the
   zoonotic potential of Usutu virus, risk of ciguatera fish poisoning in
   EU, zoonotic aspects of illegally imported wildlife products and
   benefits and risks of 3D food printing, the method developed to
   preliminary assess signals of potential emerging issues is presented and
   discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Rabbit meat has outstanding dietetic and nutritional properties.
   However, few data on microbiological hazards associated with rabbit
   productions are available. In this study, the presence of Listeria
   monocytogenes was determined in 430 rabbit carcasses, 256 rabbit meat
   cuts and products, and 599 environmental sponges collected from four
   Italian rabbit slaughterhouses over a period of 1 year. Prevalence of L.
   monocytogenes among the 1285 rabbit meat and environmental samples was
   11\%, with statistically significant differences between
   slaughterhouses. The highest prevalence (33.6\%) was observed in rabbit
   meat cuts and products; the majority of positive environmental samples
   were collected from conveyor belts. Overall, 27.9\% and 14.3\% of rabbit
   cuts and carcasses, respectively, had L. monocytogenes counts higher
   than 1 colony-forming unit (CFU)/10g. A selection of 123 isolates from
   positive samples was genotyped and serotyped to determine genetic
   profiles and diversity among L. monocytogenes isolates contaminating
   different slaughterhouses and classes of products investigated.
   Discriminatory power and concordance among the results obtained using
   multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA), multilocus
   sequence typing (MLST), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE),
   automated EcoRI ribotyping, and serotyping were assessed. The isolates
   selected for typing were classified into serotypes 1/2a (52.8\%), 1/2c
   (32.5\%), and 1/2b (14.6\%). The majority of the isolates were
   classified as ST14 (34.1\%), ST9 (35.5\%), ST121 (17.9\%), and ST224
   (14.6\%). The greatest discriminatory power was observed with the MLVA
   typing, followed by MLST, PFGE, and ribotyping. The best bidirectional
   concordance was achieved between PFGE and MLST. There was 100\%
   correlation between both MLST and MLVA with serotype. Moreover, a high
   unidirectional correspondence was observed between MLVA and both MLST
   and PFGE, as well as between PFGE and both MLST and serotyping. The
   results of this study show for the first time in Italy prevalence and
   genetic profiles of L. monocytogenes isolated in rabbit products and
   slaughterhouses.},

Abstract = {Aethina tumida (small hive beetle, SHB) was first detected in September
   2014 in Calabria region, southern Italy, and in a single apiary in
   Sicily in November 2014. In September 2015, SHB was again recorded in
   Calabria, and in 2016, only sentinel honey bee nucleus colonies were
   found to be infested. Its phylogenetic relationship and possible origin
   were investigated comparing the cox1 sequences with the corresponding
   region available in the GenBank database. The neighbour-joining method
   revealed that the first Italian specimen belonged to a group also
   containing an African specimen from Cameroon. The Italian specimens
   differ from the SHBs spread worldwide and are split into two different
   groups: group B1 includes the AfricCam3 sequence and the first SHB
   identified in Calabria; group B2 includes specimens from Calabria and
   the only one from Sicily which share identical cox1 sequences. SHB in
   Italy appears to have been introduced from Africa and includes
   independent or contemporary incursions in the two concerned regions. The
   most likely scenario is that SHB was introduced into Calabria followed
   by man-mediated migration to Sicily.},

Abstract = {The rising prevalence of celiac disease leads to an increased demand of
   ``gluten-free{''} products. A survey study on the gluten content and on
   the microbiological quality of ``gluten-free{''} flour, and processing
   flour products, was carried out from 2010 to 2015 in Northern Italy.
   Overall 12,419 samples were analyzed, and 94.7\% contained a gluten
   concentration less than 5 mg kg(-1) (lower limit of detection). Only
   0.1\% of samples showed a gluten concentration above 80 mg kg(-1)
   (maximum limit of detection). In the remaining 5.2\%, the gluten
   concentration was between 5 and 80 mg kg(-1), underlining how a
   gluten-free diet completely devoid of gluten is unrealistic. The
   microbiological quality of these products was investigated.
   Overall, the majority of samples revealed microbial loads of less than 1
   I g CFU g(-1) (lower limit of detection). High levels of spoilage
   bacteria were found in egg-containing products. Total mesophilic
   bacteria were counted in all analyzed food categories with
   concentrations up to about 6, 8 and 91 g CFU g-1 in dry pasta, flours
   and egg products respectively. Listeria monocytogenes was found only in
   one sample, whereas Salmonella spp. was never found.
   Buckwheat flour was the most frequently contaminated product by
   presumptive Bacillus cereus, with a prevalence of 12.5\%. Also, a
   contamination by Coagulase-Positive Staphylococci was found during this
   investigation, especially in buckwheat dry pasta and flour and in egg
   dry pasta, with a prevalence of 54.7\%.
   This study aimed to enhance the knowledge about the ``gluten-free{''}
   products which are still poorly studied, even if their impact on the
   food market is increasingly considerable. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Animal welfare (AW) is a growing concern worldwide and veterinary
   students are expected to demonstrate a high degree of professional
   interest in the welfare of animals. However, previous studies have
   highlighted gaps in the teaching of AW teaching in different countries,
   possibly impairing veterinary competency in the area. This survey aimed
   to assess the opinions of Italian veterinary students towards AW, as
   well as their knowledge on the issue. Questions were divided into
   different sections, investigating the definition of, and information on,
   AW, knowledge about AW legislation, and the level of tolerance towards
   AW in regard to the use of animals for different purposes. Results
   showed that behaviour was the most frequently used word to define AW.
   Italian students considered their own level of knowledge on AW as good,
   relying on their university training, websites and television. They
   requested more AW legislation, but when questioned on specifics of the
   current legislation, there was a general lack of knowledge. Although
   poultry, pigs and rabbits were considered the species experiencing the
   worst management conditions, the species that raised the most AW
   concerns were companion animals and cattle. Results from this
   investigation may allow the development of tailored actions aimed at
   appropriately implementing educational strategies, at national and
   international levels, to improve the role of future veterinarians as
   leaders in AW.},

Abstract = {We report a rapid and reliable method for the detection of Toxoplasma
   gondii in meat and animal tissues based on real-time polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR). Samples were collected from cattle, small ruminants,
   horses, and pigs raised or imported into Sicily, Italy. All DNA
   preparations were assayed by real-time PCR tests targeted to a 98-bp
   long fragment in the AF 529-bp repeat element and to the B1 gene using
   specific primers. Diagnostic sensitivity (100\%), diagnostic specificity
   (100\%), limit of detection (0.01 pg), efficiency (92-109\%), and
   precision (mean coefficient of variation = 0.60\%), repeatability
   (100\%), reproducibility (100\%), and robustness were evaluated using
   240 DNA extracted samples (120 positives and 120 negative as per the OIE
   nested PCR method) from different matrices. Positive results were
   confirmed by the repetition of both real-time and nested PCR assays. Our
   study demonstrates the viability of a reliable, rapid, and specific
   real-time PCR on a large scale to monitor contamination with Toxoplasma
   cysts in meat and animal specimens. This validated method can be used
   for postmortem detection in domestic and wild animals and for food
   safety purposes.},

Abstract = {We report the diagnostic sensitivity of 3 EU-approved rapid tests
   (ELISAs; 1 from IDEXX and 2 from Bio-Rad) for the detection of
   transmissible spongiform encephalopathy diseases in goats. Ninety-eight
   goat brainstem samples were tested. All the rapid tests had 100\%
   specificity and 80\% sensitivity, with the IDEXX test significantly more
   sensitive than the 2 Bio-Rad tests. All tests detected 100\% of samples
   from goats with clinical scrapie, but missed 8\% (IDEXX) to 33\%
   (Bio-Rad SG) of samples from preclinical goats. Importantly, only IDEXX
   picked up all samples from clinical bovine spongiform encephalopathy
   (BSE)-infected goats, whereas the other 2 rapid tests missed 15\%
   (Bio-Rad SG) to 25\% (Bio-Rad SAP). These results show that a fraction
   of preclinical scrapie infections are likely missed by EU surveillance,
   with sensitivity of detection strongly dependent on the choice of the
   rapid test. Moreover, a significant proportion of clinical BSE
   infections are underestimated by using either Bio-Rad test. Assuming
   that the same sensitivity on preclinical goats would also occur in
   BSE-infected goats, our data suggest that IDEXX is likely the most
   sensitive test for detecting preclinical field cases of BSE infection in
   goats, although with an 8\% failure rate. These results raise some
   concerns about the reliability of current EU surveillance figures on BSE
   infection in goats.},

Abstract = {Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR) occurs worldwide, requiring
   significant resources for eradication programs or surveillance purposes.
   The status of infection is usually detected by serological methods using
   the virus neutralization test (VNT) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   (ELISA) on individual sera. The gE DIVA (Differentiating Infected from
   Vaccinated Animals) vaccines approach, adopted in order to reduce the
   virus circulation and prevent clinical signs, have tightened the range
   of available methods for the serological diagnosis. Different gE
   blocking ELISA could be performed to detect specific antibodies in sera
   of infected or whole virus-vaccinated animals but with less sensitivity
   if applied to bulk milk samples, especially in marker-vaccinated herds.
   A new rec-gE ELISA was recently developed in Italy and applied with good
   performances on blood serum samples. The present paper focuses on the
   application of a rapid protocol for purification/concentration of
   immunoglobulin G (IgG) from bulk milk and on the use of the new rec-gE
   indirect ELISA. The study involved three different partners and 225
   herds (12,800 lactating cows) with different official IBR diagnostic
   statuses. The diagnostic specificity of the method was demonstrated
   closed to 100\% while the diagnostic sensitivity was strictly related to
   the herd-seroprevalence. Considering 2.5\% as the limit of detection of
   within-herd seropositivity prevalence, the diagnostic sensitivity showed
   by the proposed method was equal to 100\%. A single reactivation of a
   whole strain vaccine in an old cow was detected inside a group of 67
   lactating cows, showing the field applicability of the method. (C) 2017

Title = {Rabies Vaccination: Higher Failure Rates in Imported Dogs than in those
   Vaccinated in Italy},

Abstract = {The current European Union (EU) legislation decrees that pets entering
   the EU from a rabies-infected third country have to obtain a
   satisfactory virus-neutralizing antibody level, while those moving
   within the EU require only rabies vaccination as the risk of moving a
   rabid pet within the EU is considered negligible. A number of factors
   driving individual variations in dog vaccine response have been
   previously reported, including a high rate of vaccine failure in
   puppies, especially those subject to commercial transport. A total of
   21001 observations collected from dogs (2006-2012) vaccinated in
   compliance with the current EU regulations were statistically analysed
   to assess the effect of different risk factors related to rabies vaccine
   efficacy. Within this framework, we were able to compare the vaccination
   failure rate in a group of dogs entering the Italian border from EU and
   non-EU countries to those vaccinated in Italy prior to international
   travel. Our analysis identified that cross-breeds and two breed
   categories showed high vaccine success rates, while Beagles and Boxers
   were the least likely to show a successful response to vaccination
   (88.82\% and 90.32\%, respectively). Our analysis revealed diverse
   performances among the commercially available vaccines, in terms of
   serological peak windows, and marked differences according to
   geographical area. Of note, we found a higher vaccine failure rate in
   imported dogs (13.15\%) than in those vaccinated in Italy (5.89\%). Our
   findings suggest that the choice of vaccine may influence the likelihood
   of an animal achieving a protective serological level and that time from
   vaccination to sampling should be considered when interpreting
   serological results. A higher vaccine failure in imported compared to
   Italian dogs highlights the key role that border controls still have in
   assessing the full compliance of pet movements with EU legislation to
   minimize the risk of rabies being reintroduced into a disease-free area.},

Abstract = {Skeletal muscle fibers contain different isoforms of myosin heavy chain
   (MyHC) that define distinctive contractile properties. In light of the
   muscle capacity to adapt MyHC expression to pathophysiological
   conditions, a rapid and quantitative assessment of MyHC isoforms in
   small muscle tissue quantities would represent a valuable diagnostic
   tool for (neuro)muscular diseases. As past protocols did not meet these
   requirements, in the present study we applied a targeted proteomic
   approach based on selected reaction monitoring that allowed the absolute
   quantification of slow and fast MyHC isoforms in different mouse
   skeletal muscles with high reproducibility. This mass-spectrometry-based
   method was validated also in a pathological specimen, by comparison of
   the MyHC expression profiles in different muscles from healthy mice and
   a genetic mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) expressing
   the SOD1(G93A) mutant. This analysis showed that terminally ill ALS mice
   have a fast-to-slow shift in the fiber type composition of the tibialis
   anterior and gastrocnemius muscles, as previously reported. These
   results will likely open the way to accurate and rapid diagnoses of
   human (neuro)muscular diseases by the proposed method.},

Abstract = {We evaluated the use of oral fluid as an alternative to serum samples
   for Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) detection. Individual oral fluid
   and serum samples were collected at different times post-infection from
   pigs that were experimentally inoculated with CSFV Alfort 187 strain. We
   found no evidence of CSFV neutralizing antibodies in swine oral fluid
   samples under our experimental conditions. In contrast, real-time
   reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction could detect CSFV
   nucleic acid from the oral fluid as early as 8 d postinfection, which
   also coincided with the time of initial detection in blood samples. The
   probability of CSFV detection in oral fluid was identical or even higher
   than in the corresponding blood sample. Our results support the
   feasibility of using this sampling method for CSFV genome detection,
   which may represent an additional cost-effective tool for CSF control.},

Abstract = {Picophytoplankton (Pico) seasonal dynamics and ecology were investigated
   in three eutrophic coastal lagoons (Calich, Santa Giusta, and Corru
   S'Ittiri) located in the same geographic region (Sardinia, Mediterranean
   Sea). Pico dynamics were examined to determine a relationship with
   variability in environmental conditions characterizing the three sites,
   and identify which parameters affected observed Pico dynamics. Results
   showed Pico density reached 108 cells L-1 and biomass values did not
   exceed 72.8 mu g C L-1. Statistical analyses detected significant
   differences in hydrographic and nutrient conditions among lagoons, which
   were also characterized by variable Pico seasonal dynamics and
   composition. Calich and Santa Giusta were dominated all year around by
   picocyanobacteria. Maximum picocyanobacteria abundance was observed
   during summer in both lagoons, associated with the highest temperatures
   recorded. Picocyanobacteria abundance and nutrient concentrations showed
   a significant negative and positive correlation in Calich and Santa
   Giusta, respectively. In contrast, picoeukaryotes dominated Pico
   assemblages in Corru S'Ittiri, where the highest transparency and
   salinity and the lowest seasonal variation in salinity were recorded. In
   Corru S'Ittiri, the maximum Pico abundance was observed in autumn, when
   lower temperature and the highest nutrient concentrations were observed.
   Our study provides information on Pico assemblage ecology, which remains
   scarce in coastal and transitional environments, particularly in
   Mediterranean climate regimes.},

Title = {Exploring MALDI-TOF MS approach for a rapid identification of
   Mycobacterium avium ssp paratuberculosis field isolates},

Abstract = {Aims: The aim of the study was to explore the suitability of
   matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass
   spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for a rapid and correct identification of
   Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP) field isolates.
   Methods and ResultsMALDI-TOF MS approach is becoming one of the most
   popular tests for the identification of intact bacterial cells which has
   been shown to be fast and reliable. For this purpose, 36 MAP field
   isolates were analysed through MALDI-TOF MS and the spectra compared
   with two different databases: one provided by the vendor of the system
   employed (Biotyper ver. 30; Bruker Daltonics) and a homemade database
   containing spectra from both tuberculous and nontuberculous
   Mycobacteria. Moreover, principal component analysis procedure was
   employed to confirm the ability of MALDI-TOF MS to discriminate between
   very closely related subspecies. Our results suggest MAP can be
   differentiated from other Mycobacterium species, both when the species
   are very close (M. intracellulare) and when belonging to different
   subspecies (M. avium ssp. avium and M. avium ssp. silvaticum).
   ConclusionsThe procedure applied is fast, easy to perform, and achieves
   an earlier accurate species identification of MAP and nontuberculous
   Mycobacteria in comparison to other procedures.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyThe gold standard test for the
   diagnosis of paratuberculosis is still isolation of MAP by cultural
   methods, but additional assays, such as qPCR and subculturing for
   determination of mycobactin dependency are required to confirm its
   identification. We have provided here evidence pertaining to the
   usefulness of MALDI-TOF MS approach for a rapid identification of this
   mycobacterium among other members of M. avium complex.},

Abstract = {Purpose. In 2013/2014, Italy experienced one of the largest
   community-wide prolonged outbreaks of hepatitis A virus (HAV) throughout
   the country. The article provides a comprehensive description of the
   outbreak and the investigation carried out by a multidisciplinary
   National Task Force, in collaboration with regional and local public
   health authorities. Control strategies of food-borne HAV infection in
   both the human and food sectors are also described.
   Methodology. Enhanced human epidemiological and microbiological
   surveillance together with microbiological monitoring of HAV in food and
   trace-back investigation were conducted.
   Results. A total of 1803 HAV cases were identified from 1 January 2013
   to 31 August 2014, in Italy. Sequencing was possible for 368 cases (20.4
   \%), mostly collected between 1 January 2013 and 28 February 2014, and
   246 cases (66.8 \%) harboured an HAV outbreak strain. Imported frozen
   berries contaminated with HAV were identified as the vehicle of the
   outbreak which also involved many other European countries in 2013 and
   2014. Epidemiological evidence obtained through a case-control study was
   supported by the finding of a 100\% nucleotide similarity of the VP1/2A
   sequences of HAVs detected in human and food samples. Trace-back
   investigation revealed an extremely complex supplying network with no
   possibility for a point source potentially explaining the vast
   contamination of berries found in Italy.
   Conclusion. The investigation benefited from an excellent collaboration
   among different sectors who shared proactively the available
   information. Our findings highlight the importance of considering frozen
   berries among the highest risk factors for HAV.},

Title = {Effect of the inclusion of fresh lemon pulp in the diet of lactating
   ewes on the properties of milk and cheese},
Journal = {ANIMAL FEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {225},
Pages = {213-223},

Abstract = {This study investigated the effects of fresh lemon pulp (FLP), as a
   natural antioxidant in the diet, on the intake of feed and the
   production of milk and cheese of Valle del Belice lactating ewes during
   the hot summer in Sicily. A total of 15 second -lambing ewes, kept
   individually in 3 x 3 m pens, were divided into 3 homogeneous groups fed
   with 3 diets in a 3 x 3 Latin square design, with 3 experimental phases
   of 21 days each. The diets were: mixed hay ad libitum plus 600 g/day of
   concentrate (FLPO); mixed hay ad libitum plus 400 g/day of concentrate
   and 1 kg/day of FLP (FLP1); and mixed hay ad libitum plus 200 g/day of
   concentrate and 2 kg/day of FLP (FLP2). Nine experimental Pecorino
   cheeses were manufactured with bulk milk collected at the end of each
   phase from each group. The ewes of each group showed the same dry matter
   (DM) intake (2 kg/day/head), but the FLP2 group received lower (P =
   0.001) net energy for lactation (NEL) than other groups (2.13, 2.36, and
   2.31 Mcal/day per head for FLP2, FLPO, and FLP1, respectively). The FLP
   constituted 9\% and 16\% of the total DM intake in the FLP1 and FLP2
   groups, respectively. In general, the daily milk yield was low,
   reflecting the effect of the high environmental temperatures, and was
   lower (P = 0.001) in the FLP2 group than in the other groups (323, 355,
   and 369 g/day for FLP2, FLP1, and FLPO, respectively), probably due to
   the lower daily energy intake. Milk protein (P = 0.046) and casein (P =
   0.033) percentages were higher in the FLP2 group than in the FLP1 group;
   the FLP-fed groups had higher levels of (P = 0.011) milk urea than the
   FLPO group, due to a higher (P = 0.001) CP/NEL ratio in the ingested
   diet (96.4, 95.8, and 95.3 g/Mcal for FLP2, FLP1, and FLPO,
   respectively). The fatty acid composition of milk from FLP2-fed ewes was
   higher in vaccenic (10.6 vs. 7.96 mg/g fat; P = 0.031) and rumenic acids
   (6.21 vs. 5.30 mg/g fat; P = 0.048) than that in milk from FLPO ewes.
   The characteristics of the cheeses were not influenced by the diet, with
   the exception of the total content of phenolic compounds (P = 0:011) and
   antioxidant activity (P = 0.051), both of which were higher in cheeses
   made with milk from FLP-fed ewes.},

Journal = {FOOD PACKAGING AND SHELF LIFE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {This study aimed to describe the effects of refrigerated storage up to
   180 days on microbiological, chemical, physical, and sensory
   characteristics of a PDO ewes' raw milk stretched cheese. To this aim, a
   total of 224 cheeses were manufactured in four consecutive production
   weeks, and series of 32 of them were examined before packaging and after
   15, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 d of storage at 4 +/- 2 degrees C in the
   dark, respectively. Lactic acid bacteria cocci displayed the highest
   levels (7.8 Log CFU{*}g (1)) during early storage and decreased
   progressively over time (7.4 Log CFU{*} g (1)), while the opposite trend
   was observed for lactic acid bacteria rods (from 6.5 to 7.3 Log CFU{*}g
   (1)). TMC and enterocci significantly increased during the storage.
   Chemical parameters showed a natural increase of proteolytic index
   during storage, an increase of pH (from 5.44 to 5.92), salt (from 2.08
   to 2.40\% of DM) and a decrease of aw (from 0.984 to 0.971). Storage
   modified the color of the cheeses, provoked a slight browning, while
   a{*} value (red-green) and b{*} value (yellow-blue) increased until 30
   days and then remained unchanged. Cheese fatty acids composition didn't
   show particular trend during the storage, while several panel test
   parameters changed. Cheeses after 180 days of storage showed higher
   solubility, greater odor of butter and less odor of milk than fresh
   cheeses, that determined an high overall satisfaction of the panelists
   at the end of storage. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Background: Leishmaniasis is a widespread infectious disease, but there
   is not much information about its prevalence in high risk occupational
   categories. Objectives: The aim of this study is to assess the
   prevalence of Leishmania immunological positivity in human skin tissues
   collected from subjects living in Western Sicily, with suspected
   cutaneous Leishmania infection, in order to explore the risk possibly
   related to occupation. Methods: 318 consecutive subjects (M/F ratio=
   1.0, mean age= 40 +/- 25.4 years), attending the Dermatology Department
   of the University of Palermo Hospital from 2013 to 2015, without any
   previous history of Leishmania infection and performing various
   occupations, were included. Parasite isolation and PCR-RT test on skin
   scrapings were performed to evaluate the immunological status; all data
   were analyzed by the chi square test, comparing all positive results
   from the different provinces. Results: 81 (50.9\%) out of 159 females
   and 79 (49.7\%) out of 159 males were found PCR-RT positive to
   Leishmania infantum, with a higher risk in the Agrigento district (p<
   0.001) and in subjects living in rural areas (p= 0.0038), regardless of
   the type of work performed. The observed animal leishmaniasis prevalence
   in the same areas shows the endemic status of the disease in Sicily.
   Conclusions: Although based on a relatively small sample, our study
   shows that cutaneous leishmaniasis represents a health care problem with
   a medical and social impact in Western Sicily. An active surveillance
   system and the establishment of diagnosis and treatment centres could be
   useful in controlling this public health problem.},

Title = {The effect of interspecific competition on the temporal dynamics of
   Aedes albopictus and Culex pipiens},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Month = {FEB 23},
Abstract = {Background: Aedes albopictus and Culex pipiens larvae reared in the same
   breeding site compete for resources, with an asymmetrical outcome that
   disadvantages only the latter species. The impact of these interactions
   on the overall ecology of these two species has not yet been assessed in
   the natural environment. In the present study, the temporal patterns of
   adult female mosquitoes from both species were analysed in north-
   eastern Italy, and substantial temporal shifts between abundance curves
   of Cx. pipiens and Ae. albopictus were observed in several sites. To
   understand which factors can drive the observed temporal shifts, we
   developed a mechanistic model that takes explicitly into account the
   effect of temperature on the development and survival of all mosquito
   stages. We also included into the model the effect of asymmetric
   interspecific competition, by adding a mortality term for Cx. pipiens
   larvae proportional to the larval abundance of Ae. albopictus within the
   same breeding site. Model calibration was performed through a Markov
   Chain Monte Carlo approach using weekly capture data collected in our
   study sites during 2014 and 2015.
   Results: In almost half of observation sites, temporal shifts were due
   to competition, with an early decline of Cx. pipiens caused by the
   concurrent rise in abundance of its competitor, and this effect was
   enhanced by higher abundance of both species. We estimate that
   competition may reduce Cx. pipiens abundance in some sites by up to
   about 70\%. However, in some cases temporal shifts can also be explained
   in the absence of competition between species resulting from a
   ``temporal niche{''} effect, when the optimal fitness to environmental
   conditions for the two species are reached at different times of the
   year.
   Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the importance of considering
   ecological interactions and, in particular, competition between mosquito
   species in temperate climates, with important implications for risk
   assessment of mosquito transmitted pathogens, as well as the
   implementation of effective control measures.},

Title = {Development of Dirofilaria immitis and Dirofilaria repens in Aedes
   japonicus and Aedes geniculatus},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {Background: The mosquito-borne filarial nematodes Dirofilaria immitis
   and Dirofilaria repens primarily affect dogs but also cats, causing
   heartworm disease or subcutaneous dirofilariosis, respectively, and both
   may also cause zoonotic diseases in humans. Several mosquito species
   have been reported as competent vectors for these nematodes, but no data
   are available for the invasive mosquito species Aedes japonicus
   (Theobald, 1901). The objective of this study was to describe the
   development of both D. immitis and D. repens under standardised
   experimental laboratory conditions in mosquitoes.
   Methods: For this purpose, both a laboratory strain and field-collected
   individuals of the invasive mosquito species Ae. japonicus and, for
   comparative purposes, a laboratory strain of Aedes geniculatus, a rare
   indigenous species sharing habitats with Ae. japonicus, and of the
   tropical species Aedes aegypti were used. Anticoagulated
   microfilariaemic blood was fed at a density of 3000 mf/ml to mosquitoes
   with a hemotek system. Blood-fed mosquitoes were incubated at 27
   C-degrees and 85\% relative humidity, and specimens were dissected under
   the microscope at pre-set time points to observe developmental stages of
   both Dirofilaria species. Additionally, real-time PCRs were carried out
   in some microscopically negative samples to determine the infection
   rates.
   Results: In field-collected Ae. japonicus infectious L3 larvae of both
   D. immitis and D. repens developed, rendering this mosquito species an
   efficient vector for both filarial species. Additionally, Ae.
   geniculatus was shown to be an equally efficient vector for both
   filarial species. Aedes japonicus mosquitoes from a laboratory colony
   were refractory to D. immitis but susceptible to D. repens, whereas Ae.
   aegypti was refractory to both filarial species.
   Conclusions: To our knowledge, Aedes japonicus was for the first time
   shown to be an efficient vector for both D. immitis and D. repens,
   indicating that this invasive and locally highly abundant species may
   contribute to a transmission of filarial worms. The data emphasize the
   necessity to perform vector competence studies with local mosquito
   populations as basis for risk assessments. We further demonstrated that
   detection of filarial DNA in a mosquito species alone does not allow to
   draw reliable conclusions with regard to its vector competence.},

Title = {Food components and contaminants as (anti)androgenic molecules},
Journal = {GENES AND NUTRITION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Month = {FEB 16},
Abstract = {Androgens, the main male sex steroids, are the critical factors
   responsible for the development of the male phenotype during
   embryogenesis and for the achievement of sexual maturation and puberty.
   In adulthood, androgens remain essential for the maintenance of male
   reproductive function and behavior. Androgens, acting through the
   androgen receptor (AR), regulate male sexual differentiation during
   development, sperm production beginning from puberty, and maintenance of
   prostate homeostasis. Several substances present in the environment, now
   classified as endocrine disruptors (EDCs), strongly interfere with
   androgen actions in reproductive and nonreproductive tissues. EDCs are a
   heterogeneous group of xenobiotics which include synthetic chemicals
   used as industrial solvents/lubricants, plasticizers, additives,
   agrochemicals, pharmaceutical agents, and polyphenols of plant origin.
   These compounds are even present in the food as components (polyphenols)
   or food/water contaminants (pesticides, plasticizers used as food
   packaging) rendering the diet as the main route of exposure to EDCs for
   humans. Although huge amount of literature reports the (anti) estrogenic
   effects of different EDCs, relatively scarce information is available on
   the (anti) androgenic effects of EDCs. Here, the effects and mechanism
   of action of phytochemicals and pesticides and plasticizers as possible
   modulators of AR activities will be reviewed taking into account that
   insight derived from principles of endocrinology are required to
   estimate EDC consequences on endocrine deregulation and disease.},

Title = {Prevalence and characterization of Salmonella among humans in Ghana},
Journal = {TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {45},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Background: Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) is a public health problem
   worldwide and particularly in Africa with high disease burden. This
   study characterized Salmonella isolates from humans in Ghana to
   determine serovar distribution, phage types, and antimicrobial
   resistance. Further, the clonal relatedness among isolates was
   determined.
   Methods: One hundred and thirty-seven Salmonella isolates (111 clinical
   and 26 public toilet) were characterized using standard serotyping,
   phage typing, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods. The
   molecular epidemiology of common serovars (Salmonella Typhimurium and
   Salmonella Enteritidis) was established by pulsed field gel
   electrophoresis (PFGE).
   Results: Twenty-two serovars were identified with S. Enteritidis, S.
   Typhimurium, and Salmonella Derby as the most dominant. One hundred and
   twelve isolates showed resistance to more than one antimicrobial.
   Fifty-eight (n = 58/112; 54.5\%) strains were multi-resistant with low
   resistance to cephalosporins ceftazidime (8.0\%), cefotaxime (4.5\%),
   and cefoxitin (2.7\%) with synergy to clavulanic acid indicating
   possible ESBLs. Isolates showed high resistance to trimethoprim
   (66.1\%), tetracycline (61.6\%), ampicillin (57.1\%), sulfamethoxazole
   (46.4\%), chloramphenicol (33.9\%), and ciprofloxacin (25.0\%). The most
   common resistance pattern of multi-resistant serovars was to ampicillin,
   chloramphenicol, sulphonamide, and trimethoprim. S. Enteritidis (18/43)
   strains reacted with typing phages but did not conform to any phage type
   with PT14B and PT4 as predominant definitive phage types. Six S.
   Typhimurium strains reacted but did not conform to any recognized phage
   type while seven were non-typable. The predominant definitive phage
   types were DT1 and DT22. PFGE patterns of human S. Enteritidis were
   closely related to patterns of poultry isolates obtained in a previous
   study in Ghana.
   Conclusions: Cephalosporin resistance is uncommon among Salmonella from
   humans in Ghana. Poultry may be an important source of human
   salmonellosis. There is an urgent need for the implementation of routine
   surveillance of antimicrobial use and bacterial resistance among humans
   in Ghana.},

Title = {Laboratory colonization of the European invasive mosquito Aedes
   (Finlaya) koreicus},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Background: Aedes (Finlaya) koreicus (Edwards) is a mosquito that has
   recently entered Europe from Asia. This species is considered a
   potential threat to newly colonized territories, but little is known
   about its capacity to transmit pathogens or ability to compete with
   native mosquito species. The establishment of a laboratory colony is a
   necessary first step for further laboratory studies on the biology,
   ecology and vector competence of Ae. koreicus.
   Results: A self-mating colony was established at QIMR Berghofer Medical
   Research Institute (Brisbane, Australia) from eggs of the F1 progeny of
   individuals collected as free-living larvae in northeastern Italy
   (Belluno province). Mosquitoes are currently maintained on both
   defibrinated sheep blood provided via an artificial membrane system and
   human blood from volunteers. Larvae are maintained in rain water and fed
   with Tetramin (R) fish food ((c) 2015 Spectrum Brands - Pet, Home and
   Garden Division, Tetra-Fish). Morphometric measurements related to body
   size were taken and a fecundity index, based on wing length, was
   calculated. An in vivo technique for differentiating male and female
   pupae has been optimized. Our findings provide the basis for further
   studies on the ecology and physiology of Ae. koreicus.
   Conclusion: We describe the establishment of an Ae. koreicus colony in
   the laboratory and identify critical requirements for the maintenance of
   this mosquito species under artificial conditions. The laboratory colony
   will facilitate studies investigating the vector potential of this
   species for human pathogens.},

Title = {Comparison of virulence of Francisella tularensis ssp holarctica
   genotypes B.12 and B.FTNF002-00},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Background: Two main genetic groups (B.12 and B.FTNF002-00) of
   Francisella tularensis ssp. holarctica are endemic in Europe. The
   B.FTNF002-00 group proved to be dominant in Western European countries,
   while strains of the B.12 group were isolated mainly in Northern,
   Central and Eastern Europe. The clinical course of tularemia in the
   European brown hare (Lepus europaeus) also shows distinct patterns
   according to the geographical area. Acute course of the disease is
   observed in hares in Western European countries, while signs of
   sub-acute or chronic infection are more frequently detected in the
   eastern part of the continent. The aim of the present study was to
   examine whether there is any difference in the virulence of the strains
   belonging to the B.FTNF002-00 and B.12 genetic clades.
   Results: Experimental infection of Fischer 344 rats was performed by
   intra-peritoneal injection of three dilutions of a Hungarian (B.12
   genotype) and an Italian (B.FTNF002-00 genotype) F. tularensis ssp.
   holarctica strain. Moderate difference was observed in the virulence of
   the two genotypes. Significant differences were observed in total weight
   loss values and scores of clinical signs between the two genotypes with
   more rats succumbing to tularemia in groups infected with the
   B.FTNF002-00 genotype.
   Conclusions: Results of the experimental infection are consistent with
   previous clinical observations and pathological studies suggesting that
   F. tularensis ssp. holarctica genotype B.FTNF002-00 has higher
   pathogenic potential than the B.12 genotype.},

Abstract = {Opisthorchis felineus (family Opisthorchiidae) is a parasitic flatworm
   representing a serious threat to humans in some countries.
   Opisthorchiasis occurs after consumption of raw or undercooked cyprinid
   fish infected by the metacercarial stage of the parasite. Due to its
   small size, detection of the parasite in fish fillet is time-consuming
   and difficult Furthermore, isolated metacercariae can be identified to

Title = {Origins and global context of Brucella abortus in Italy},
Journal = {BMC MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Month = {FEB 2},
Abstract = {Background: Brucellosis is a common and chronic disease of cattle and
   other bovids that often causes reproductive disorders. Natural infection
   in cattle is caused by Brucella abortus and transmission typically
   occurs during abortions, calving, or nursing. Brucellosis is also a
   major zoonotic disease due to contamination of dairy products or contact
   with the tissues of infected animals. Brucellosis has been eradicated
   from most of the developed world in the last 40 years but persists in
   many regions-the disease remains prevalent in portions of Africa, the
   Middle East, Asia, and Central and South America, as well as in the
   Mediterranean basin. In Italy, B. abortus has persisted in southern
   regions in both cattle and water buffalo. Previous attempts at analyzing
   the phylogenetics of B. abortus in Italy have been challenging due to
   limited genetic variability and unresolved global population genetic
   structure of this pathogen.
   Results: We conducted genome-wide phylogenetic analyses on 11
   representative strains of B. abortus from Italy, and compared these
   sequences to a worldwide collection of publically available genomes.
   Italian isolates belong to three clades that are basal to the main and
   global B. abortus lineage. Using six SNP-based assays designed to
   identify substructure within the Italian clades, we surveyed a
   collection of 261 isolates and found that one clade predominates
   throughout endemic districts in the country, while the other two clades
   are more geographically restricted to portions of southern Italy.
   Conclusions: Although related strains exist worldwide, B. abortus
   isolates from Italy are substantially different than those found in much
   of the rest of Europe and North America, and are more closely related to
   strains from the Middle East and Asia. Our assays targeting genetic
   substructure within Italy allowed us to identify the major lineages
   quickly and inexpensively, without having to generate whole genome
   sequences for a large isolate collection. These findings highlight the
   importance of genetic studies to assess the status and the history of
   pathogens.},

Title = {Association between pigs with high caecal Salmonella loads and carcass
   contamination},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {242},
Pages = {82-86},
Month = {FEB 2},
Abstract = {Contaminated pork is a significant source of foodborne Salmonella
   infections. Pork is contaminated at the slaughterhouse; however, the
   mechanisms driving Salmonella contamination of carcasses are still
   poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the
   amount of Salmonella carried by slaughtered pigs in their guts has an
   influence on carcass contamination. On that account, we tested whether
   the number of carcasses contaminated during a slaughter day was
   associated with the prevalence of highly contaminated pigs (HCP:
   Salmonella caecal loads >= 3log/g), or with the prevalence of pigs that
   simply carry Salmonella spp. in their guts. Three hundred and six pigs
   were sampled in a slaughterhouse from Central Italy. Salthonella loads
   in the caecum and on the carcass of each pig were estimated by the most
   probable number (MPN) technique. The overall prevalence of Salmonella
   was 34.64\% and 7.19\% for the caeca and carcasses, respectively. S.
   Derby and Salmonella enterica 4,{[}5],12:i:- were the most frequently
   isolated serovars. The prevalence of HCP was 11.44\%. We found a higher
   number of contaminated carcasses on days of high prevalence of HCP than
   on days of low prevalence of HCP (p = 0.0011). Conversely, carcass
   contamination did not vary with the prevalence of pigs that simply
   carried Salmonella spp. in their guts (p = 0.7970). Therefore, the
   prevalence of HCP, but not the prevalence of pigs carrying Salmonella
   spp., was related to carcass contamination. Taken together, these
   findings suggest that reduction of Salmonella loads in the guts of
   slaughtered pigs would result in fewer contaminated carcasses, and
   consequently, help to minimise the risk of human infection due to the
   consumption of contaminated pork. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Seven hundred seventy-eight samples of packaged smoked fish (774 smoked
   salmon and 4 smoked swordfish) on sale in Italy, from 50 different
   manufacturers located in 12 European Union countries, were purchased
   from the Italian market between May and December 2011. The surface
   temperatures of the samples on sale ranged from 0 to 130 degrees C (3.4
   +/- 1.5 degrees C, mean +/- SD). Six hundred eighty (87.4\%) of 778
   samples were stored at <= 4 degrees C. One hundred fifty-seven samples
   (20.2\%, 95\% confidence interval 17.5 to 23.1\%) were contaminated by
   Listeria monocytogenes, with 26 samples (3.3\%, 95\% confidence interval
   2.3 to 4.8\%) at levels >100 CFU/g. The maximum level of contamination
   was 1.3 X 10(6) CFU/g. The differences in the level of contamination of
   smoked fish between countries (chi(2) = 91.54, P < 0.05) and
   manufacturers (chi(2) = 193.22, P < 0.05) were significant. The
   frequency of detection for products from different manufacturing
   premises ranged from 0 to 76.9\%. Serotyping by serological
   agglutination revealed that the main serotypes detected were 1/2a
   (65.3\%) and 1/2b (22.4\%). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing with
   restriction enzymes AscI and ApaI yielded 36 pulsotypes from 144
   isolates, clustering into 17 groups. Eight main pulsotypes accounted for
   70.8\% of the isolates. Three of the main pulsotypes were exclusively
   from products of a single manufacturer. In general, products from the
   same manufacturer showed genetic homogeneity, with one strongly
   prevalent pulsotype. Different manufacturers usually showed very
   different levels of contamination of the final product, confirming the
   importance of the management of process hygiene for controlling L.
   monocytogenes contamination.},

Abstract = {Canine mammary tumours are frequent neoplasms mostly affecting intact
   female dogs, for which no 100\% efficient therapy is available. Platelet
   derived growth factor beta receptor (PDGF beta R) is a tyrosine kinase
   receptor (TKR) with a potential role in human breast cancer and a series
   of canine tumours. In this study we demonstrated, for the first time,
   expression of PDGF beta R and its downstream transduction molecules,
   mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase
   (MEK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERIC), as well as their
   activated forms in canine mammary tumours by both biochemical analysis
   and immunohistochemistry. PDGF beta R was expressed and
   hyperphosphorylated in the majority of tumour samples and tumour derived
   cell lines. Additionally, both MEK and ERK were expressed and activated
   in cell lines as well as biopsies. TKR inhibitors (TKRi) are currently
   under investigation as possible therapy in human breast and several
   canine tumours, thus our in vivo and in vitro findings pave the way for
   future studies aimed at establishing a potential therapeutic employment
   of TKRi for the treatment of canine mammary cancer.(C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {Respiratory disease in sheep is accountable for considerable financial
   losses worldwide. While the most noticeable cause of pneumonic
   pasteurellosis is Mannheimia haemolytica, the role of mycoplasmas,
   particularly Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae, have been overlooked. Further,
   ``atypical{''} Mycoplasma species occasionally associated with
   respiratory disease have been detected from sheep lungs worldwide. The
   aim of this work was to carry out an epidemiological survey on
   mycoplasma population in pneumonic lungs of very young dairy lambs in
   relation with the detection of other respiratory pathogens. Genomic DNA
   was extracted from 115 pneumonic lungs of one-month-old dairy lambs. The
   DNA was then tested using a DNA Microarray for Mycoplasma species and
   three PCR assays for M. haemolytica, Parainfluenza-3 virus (PI3V) and
   Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), respectively. 25 animals tested
   positive for M. ovipneumoniae (21.7\%), six of which tested positive
   also for M. arginini (5.2\%). No atypical Mycoplasma species were
   detected with the DNA microarray assay. 50 animals tested PCR positive
   for M. haemolytica (43.5\%), 21 of which tested positive also for M.
   ovipneumoniae (84\%). All the samples tested PCR negative for PI3V and
   RSV. The results obtained from this epidemiological investigation
   broaden the knowledge about the prevalence of Mycoplasma species in the
   lungs of very young dairy lambs with pneumonia. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Molecular detection of Mannheimia haemolytica in lambs with respiratory

Abstract = {Mannheimia haemolytica is a major cause of respiratory disease and
   mortality in lambs, responsible of significant economic losses in ovine
   flocks. The suspected diagnosis of mannheimiosis is generally based on
   clinical signs, characterized by lethargy, inappetence and fever along
   with histopathological aspects of progressive pneumonia and dark
   consolidation of lung parenchyma. However, further investigations are
   needed to confirm the infection, including isolation and biochemical
   identification of involved M. haemolytica strains but these methods are
   time-consuming. Assay based on PCR amplification of bacterial genome
   could be improve the sensitivity of the diagnostic protocol especially
   if the test is applied directly on the pulmonary tissues of infected
   animals.
   The aim of this study is to develop a novel PCR able to detect specific
   sequence of M. haemolytica in lung samples collected from lambs whit
   respiratory disease. Specific primers targeting a fragment of OmpA gene
   were designed and their specificity was evaluated using 8 strains of M.
   haemolytica and 2 of Pasteurella multocida. The limit of detection of
   the test is 0,067 picomol/mu l of bacterial DNA, in agreement with
   previously described PCR protocols. One hundred samples of lungs showing
   gross lesions indicative of pneumonia, collected at the slaughterhouse
   from lambs belonging to 44 flocks of the Central Italy, were analysed by
   PCR and traditional microbiological test. The agreement between PCR and
   microbiology assays resulted fair (kappa = 0,31), probably due to a
   different distribution of bacteria in lung parenchyma. Compared whit
   microbiology, PCR allowed to detect M. haemolytica strains in additional
   15 tissue samples but failed to identify 17 samples positive only to
   microbial testing. Nevertheless, when applied in parallel testing, PCR
   resulted useful to increase the sensitivity of diagnosis, with a total
   of 38 flocks resulted positive to any of two test. These results suggest
   that the PCR test could be an efficient method for a rapid and early
   identification of mannheimiosis in lambs.},

Abstract = {Objective: The high incidence of foodborne disease among children
   suggests the value of health promotion. Children are a high-risk group
   so far as foodborne disease is concerned, although they may be hard to
   reach with training programmes. This research investigated the use of
   drawings, compared with questionnaires, to evaluate the impact of a
   health promotion programme to improve knowledge and habits in the
   context of food handling and personal hygiene.
   Setting: Children (184) attending primary school and living in the north
   of Italy were enrolled in the programme.
   Methods: Qualitative and quantitative tools: pre- and post-intervention
   questionnaires were administered, and children were asked to produce
   pre- and post-intervention drawings about microorganisms and their
   effects on humans. An observation grid was built to code key features in
   the drawings.
   Results: Results clearly showed that some drawing features correlated
   with and predicted high scores in the questionnaire on knowledge of
   microorganisms. These were the use of captions, the representation of a
   natural context and the presence of a causal link between depicted
   elements.
   Conclusion: Study findings highlight the potential of the use of drawing
   as an effective evaluation tool. The use of drawing can support the
   design of strategies for the validation of health campaigns aimed at the
   amelioration of children's food contamination-related (and perhaps
   other) risks.},

Abstract = {Exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a widespread
   highly toxic environmental contaminant, suppresses immune response and
   leads to an increased susceptibility to infectious agents. In
   particular, several studies have provided evidence that TCDD decreases
   resistance to numerous viruses. Indeed, in vivo and in vitro
   investigations showed that the presence of TCDD is able to interfere
   with the replication of both human and animal viruses, such as influenza
   A viruses, coxsackie virus B3, immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1),
   cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex II, and bovine herpesvirus 1.
   Moreover, TCDD could induce an exacerbation of latent infection produced
   by HIV-1, CMV or Epstein-Barr virus. In this review, we first describe
   the general effects of TCDD exposure on mammalian cells, then we focus
   on its influence on the viral infections. Overall, the available data
   support the concept that TCDD exposure may act as an additional risk
   factor in promoting of viral diseases.},

Title = {Assessing circumstances and causes of dairy cow death in Italian dairy
   farms through a veterinary practice survey (2013-2014)},
Journal = {PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE},

Volume = {137},

Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {A questionnaire survey about on farm dairy cow mortality was carried out
   among veterinary practitioners in Italy between January 2013 and May
   2014. The study aimed at investigating the main circumstances of death
   in dairy cows (euthanasia, emergency slaughter or unassisted death), the
   primary causes and the risk factors of death. Out of 251 dead cows
   involved (across 137 farms), 54.6\% died assisted and 45.4\% were found
   dead. The main causes of death were metabolic/digestive disorders
   (22.3\%) and mastitis/udder problems (17.1\%), while in 14.7\% of all
   cases, reasons of death were unknown. From the univariable generalised
   linear mixed models, dry cows showed a significantly higher odds to die
   unassisted compared to lactating cows (OR= 3.2); dry cows also had
   higher odds of dying from unknown reasons (OR = 11.7). Season was not
   significantly related to the risk of dying unassisted and for unknown
   reasons, but during the summer (characterised by hot and muggy weather
   in Northern Italy) cows died mostly for problems at calving. 54.2\% of
   cows died during the first 30 days in milk (DIM). Half of the
   multiparous cows that died, died in the first 29.5 DIM, while half of
   the primiparous cows that died, died in the first 50 DIM. Results
   pointed out that, especially in dry cows, around calving and during the
   summer, some failure in management practices and daily inspections may
   occur. Improvements should be done in monitoring activities and in
   recognising early symptoms of diseases among stockperson. In addition,
   in case of diagnosed diseases with poor prognosis, euthanasia procedures
   should be implemented to prevent cows from dying unassisted. (C) 017

Volume = {89},
Pages = {359-364},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of
   cholesterol-loaded cyclodextrins (CLC) on motility, viability,
   capacitation status, and in vivo fertility of buffalo frozen-thawed
   sperm. After the initial semen assessment, buffalo sperm were diluted in
   BULLXcell extender containing 0- (control), 1.5-, and 3-mg/mL CLC and
   cryopreserved. At thawing, sperm motility was evaluated by phase
   contrast microscopy, and viability-capacitation status was assessed by
   Hoechst 33258-chlortetracycline (CTC) assay. Capacitation status was
   also evaluated by an indirect immunofluorescence assay to localize
   phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. Moreover, buffaloes were artificial
   inseminated to assess the in vivo fertilizing potential of CLC-treated
   semen. No differences among control, 1.5-, and 3-mg/mL CLC-treated
   groups were recorded in both sperm motility (66.5 +/- 5.6, 68.8 +/- 4.8,
   and 68.8 +/- 4.8, respectively) and viability (86.5 +/- 1.9, 87.6 +/-
   1.5, 88.4 +/- 2.3, respectively). However, the extender supplementation
   with CLC significantly reduced sperm cryocapacitation. Indeed, CLC
   treatment decreased (P < 0.01) the proportion of sperm showing the CTC
   pattern B (capacitated sperm) compared with the control (69.6 +/- 3.4,
   37.8 +/- 1.5, and 513 +/- 4.7, respectively, with 0, 1.5-, and 3-mg/mL
   CLC; P < 0.01). Furthermore, the percentage of sperm displaying
   tyrosine-phosphorylated pattern EA (i.e. high capacitation level) was
   reduced (P < 0.01) in both CLC-treated groups (10.8 +/- 3.3 and 5.6 +/-
   1.6, respectively, with 1.5- and 3-mg/mL CLC) compared with the control
   (373 +/- 6.9), reaching values similar to those recorded in fresh semen
   (11.0 +/- 3.5). In addition, treating sperm with 3-mg/mL CLC increased
   (P < 0.01) the percentage of nonfluorescent (pattern NF), i.e.,
   non-capacitated sperm (41.8 +/- 3.6) compared with fresh semen (11.0 +/-
   6.9). No differences were recorded in pregnancy rates at 60 days
   post-artificial insemination among control, 1.5- and 3-mg/mL CLC groups
   (59.7\%, 65.6\%, and 56.9\%, respectively). In conclusion, CLC treatment
   of buffalo sperm strongly decreases sperm cryocapacitation damages,
   without affecting the in vivo fertilizing capability. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {Rating of animal welfare in Marchigiana beef farms in Marche Region},
Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Introduction - The breeding of Marchigiana cattle breed in the Marche
   Region, still plays a very important role in the rural realities of the
   region. In recent decades the methods of breeding of this breed have
   changed significantly and today, in addition to family farms, there are
   actually farms of considerable size, which breed this cattle
   intensively.
   Aim - It has gone from this variability to investigate any differences
   between the management of these farms and the level of animal welfare
   inside them
   . Material and methods - This aim was reached giving a questionnaire to
   the breeders of 36 farms asking them to clinical and health aspects,
   managerial and structural aspects, and the drug management. To each
   question was assigned a score from 1 to 3. At the same time, blood
   samples were performed on 270 calves under 6 months of age to evaluate
   some non-specific immune parameters (serum- amyloid A, haptoglobin,
   serum lysozyme, complement and bactericidal activities of serum).
   Results and discussion - According to our classification 15 farms were
   considered to have good management, 15 an intermediate level of
   management and 6 mismanagement. The questionnaire also showed that 22
   out of 36 companies do not carry out quarantine, only 6 companies make
   annual checks on the herd even without symptoms. The 67\% of farms (n.
   24) has reproductive problems, among which the most frequently turns out
   to be a return to heat (87\%). Only 3 companies make use of advice from
   a nutritionist and only 4 have made the last three therapies based on a
   complete diagnosis (clinical diagnosis and direct diagnosis of
   laboratory). It was observed statistically significant association (OR =
   3.1; 95\% CI 1.6 to 6; p=0.01) between the number of animals in a farm,
   the enteric diseases and mortality in calves under six months. In
   companies with a number = 80 of cattle units, the calves had a 3 times
   greater probability of developing intestinal disease or to die.
   Regarding the innate immunity parameters we can say that there is no
   difference between the values registered in the farms with a better or
   worse management.
   Conclusions - This shows that despite the selective pressure to which
   the Marchigiana cattle breed has undergone in the last decade, this
   bovine still keeps its rustic character that make it suitable to be
   breed also in the reality in which bacterial and viral loads are
   particularly high.},

Title = {Effects of different housing systems on haematological profile, salivary
   cortisol concentration, and behavioural stress responses in calves of
   different ages},
Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {11-19},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Introduction - European animal welfare legislation (2008/119/EC) poses
   limitations on the current management practices of Valle d'Aosta
   breeders.
   Aim - The haematological profiles, salivary cortisol concentrations, and
   behavioural responses of Valdostana calves housed in either tie-stalls
   (TS) or multiple pens (MP) were evaluated in relation to the age at
   enclosure: very young calves (VYC 7-39 days) or young calves (YC 40-80
   days).
   Materials and methods - Twenty-nine calves were divided into two age
   groups: VYC (12 females and two males) and YC (13 females and two
   males). Blood and saliva samples were collected at baseline, at 20 (T1)
   and at 40 days (T2) after enclosure in one of the two housing systems.
   Behaviour was analyzed by direct closed-circuit TV recording.
   Results - Salivary cortisol levels measured at 40 days were
   significantly higher in the VYC housed in TS than those housed in MP
   (P<0.01). Differences in haematological profiles were observed only in
   the animals that had entered indoor housing (TS or MP) at age >40 days.
   The VYC housed in TS spent more time in vigilant resting, tended to
   spend less time sleeping, and exhibited significantly more ruminant
   activity.
   Discussion - The type of enclosure for housing calves can affect
   haematological profiles, cortisol concentrations, and behaviours. A
   multidisciplinary approach is more effective for evaluating animal
   welfare than assessment investigating a single parameter.
   Conclusion - In this study, the hypothesis that MP housing could create
   stressful conditions in a breed selected for fighting behaviour was not
   confirmed by our data. The socioeconomic implications of different
   housing systems need to be studied in geographical areas with natural
   constraints, such as mountainous regions where local breeds are
   frequently reared. Animal welfare data on minor local breeds can be
   useful for informing practices and policies for maintaining biodiversity
   and breeding of local breeds.},

Title = {Variation in and relationship among environmental condition and total
   locomotor activity in dairy cows},
Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {23-27},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Introduction - Behavior is one of the most important indicators for
   assessing cattle health and welfare. The cow comfort improves
   economically important responses in dairy cattle such as feed intake,
   milk production, reproduction and health. The environmental variation in
   air temperature, relative humidity and rainfall were recognized as the
   potential hazards which affect the animal's biological system.
   Aim - The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of
   environmental conditions (ambient temperature, relative humidity and
   temperature-humidity index) on the total locomotor activity (TLA)
   behavior in dairy cows.
   Materials and methods - 18 Modicana cows (5-8 years, mean body weight
   512+/-78 kg), selected from two different farms (A and B), were enrolled
   in the study. During experimental period, ambient temperature and
   relative humidity were recorded by means of a data logger and the
   temperature-humidity index (THI) was calculated as indicator of thermal
   comfort for cattle. Each animals were equipped with an activity
   monitoring data loggers (Actiwatch-Mini(R)) in order to record the daily
   TLA.
   Results and discussion - The results of the present study confirmed that
   the TLA is influenced by environmental conditions. The ambient
   temperature and THI recorded during the experimental periods were within
   the upper critical zone. Two-way repeated measure analysis of variance
   (ANOVA) a significant effect of season (P < 0.0001), whereas no effect
   of farm on the amount of TLA was found. A trigonometric statistical
   model was used to describe the main rhythmic parameters: mean level,
   amplitude, acrophase and robustness of rhythm. Our results showed a
   circadian rhythm of daily TLA in all periods, with different percentages
   of robustness, and acrophase in the photophase.
   Conclusions - These results provide insight into the TLA responses of
   dairy cow to different environmental conditions, allowing to better
   evaluate its ability to adapt and cope with environmental stress. Major
   changes in TLA were found at the hottest environmental condition
   therefore suitable measures should be adopted in order to minimize
   environmental stress and to improve animal welfare.},

Title = {Mediterranean Azadinium dexteroporum (Dinophyceae) produces six novel

Abstract = {Azadinium dexteroporum is the first species of the genus described from
   the Mediterranean Sea and it produces different azaspiracids (AZA). The
   aims of this work were to characterize the toxin profile of the species
   and gain structural information on azaspiracids produced by the A.
   dexteroporum strain SZN-B848 isolated from the Gulf of Naples. Liquid
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analyses were carried out on
   three MS systems having different ion source geometries (ESI,
   TurboIonSprayA (R), ESI ION MAX) and different MS analyzers operating
   either at unit resolution or at high resolution, namely a hybrid triple
   quadrupole-linear ion trap (Q-Trap MS), a time of flight (TOF MS), and a
   hybrid linear ion trap Orbitrap XL Fourier transform mass spectrometer
   (LTQ Orbitrap XL FTMS). As a combined result of these different
   analyses, A. dexteroporum showed to produce AZA-35, previously reported
   from Azadinium spinosum, and six compounds that represent new additions
   to the AZA-group of toxins, including AZA-54 to AZA-58 and 3-epiAZA-7, a
   stereoisomer of the shellfish metabolite AZA-7. Based on the
   interpretation of fragmentation patterns, we propose that all these
   molecules, except AZA-55, have the same A to I ring system as AZA-1,
   with structural modifications all located in the carboxylic side chain.
   Considering that none of the azaspiracids produced by the Mediterranean
   strain of A. dexteroporum is currently regulated by European food safety
   authorities, monitoring programs of marine biotoxins in the
   Mediterranean area should take into account the occurrence of the new
   analogues to avoid an underestimation of the AZA-related risk for
   seafood consumers.},

Abstract = {Dolphin morbillivirus (DMV) has caused several mortality events in
   Mediterranean striped (Stenella coeruleoalba) and bottlenose (Tursiops
   truncatus) dolphins populations since 19; in the last 5 years, the virus
   was reported to infect new hosts in this basin, such as fin whales
   (Balaenoptera physalus), sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), and even
   a harbor seal (Phoca vitulina). Very recently, a calf Cuviers beaked
   whale (Ziphius cavirostris) calf stranded on the Southern Italian
   coastline with mild pathological findings suggestive of morbilliviral
   infection, received the first confirmation of DMV infection in this
   species by biomolecular evidences on lung tissue. This new cross-species
   infection report, along with 19\% of the cetaceans specimens examined by
   the Italian Stranding Network being found positive to DMV, support the
   hypothesis of an endemic circulation of this virus among Mediterranean
   cetaceans.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUNDThe increase in seafood consumption and the presence of
   different species of bivalves on the global markets has given rise to
   several commercial frauds based on species substitution. To prevent and
   detect wilful or unintentional frauds, reliable and rapid techniques are
   required to identify seafood species in different products. In the
   present work, a pyrosequencing-based technology has been used for the
   molecular identification of bivalve species.
   RESULTSProcessed and unprocessed samples of 15 species belonging to the
   bivalve families Pectinidae, Mytilidae, Donacidae, Ostreidae, Pharide
   and Veneridae were analysed and correctly identified by the developed
   pyrosequencing-based method according to the homology between query
   sequences of the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) and cytochrome c oxidase I
   (COI) genes and their correspondent reference libraries. This technique
   exhibits great potential in automated and high-throughput processing
   systems, allowing the simultaneous analysis of 96 samples in shorter
   execution and turnaround times.
   CONCLUSIONSThe correct identification of all the species shows how
   useful this technique may prove to differentiate species from different
   products, providing an alternative, simple, rapid and economical tool to
   detect seafood substitution frauds. (c) 2016 Society of Chemical

Title = {Efficacy of a polyvalent mastitis vaccine against Staphylococcus aureus
   on a dairy Mediterranean buffalo farm: results of two clinical field
   trials},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JAN 19},
Abstract = {Background: In the last years the knowledges on Mediterranean Buffalo
   (MB) mastitis is remarkably improving, nevertheless the attention has
   been never focused on vaccination as preventive strategy for the control
   of mastitis in these ruminates. The aim of the current study was to
   assess clinical efficacy over time of two different preventive
   vaccination protocols against S. aureus mastitis, in primiparous MB.
   Vaccinated (VG) and not-vaccinated (N-VG) groups, of 30 MB each one,
   were selected from two different herds (herd A: VG1 and N-VG1; herd B:
   VG2 and N-VG2) of the same farm. Herd A received a double vaccination
   (Startvac (R), 45 and 10 days before calving, protocol A), while in herd
   B an additional administration was performed (52 days after calving,
   protocol B). Bacteriological milk culture and assessment of somatic cell
   count (SCC) were performed at 10, 30, 60 and 90 days in milk (DIM) from
   composite milk samples. After 90 DIM, daily milk yields and SCC values
   were monthly detected until dry-off.
   Results: The overall incidence of positive MB for S. aureus was 40.8\%
   (49/120) in VG1 and 43.3\% (52/120) in N-VG1 (Protocol A), while 45.8\%
   (55/120) and 50.8\% (61/120) in VG2 and N-VG2 (Protocol B). The latter
   was associated with a significant decreased in prevalence (at 90 DIM)
   and incidence of mastitis (animals positive for S. aureus, SCC >
   200<\^{}>10(3), with or without clinical signs) in the vaccinated MB,
   while no difference occurred in protocol A. Moreover, herd B showed a
   significant reduction in prevalence of intramammary infection (animals
   positive for S. aureus, SCC < 200<\^{}>10(3), no clinical signs) in the
   vaccinated MB at 60 DIM while no differences were detected in herd A, at
   any sampling time; N-VG2 had significantly higher overall SCC values
   than VG2 (4.97 +/- 4.75 and 4.84 +/- 4.60 Log10 cells/mL +/- standard
   deviation, respectively), while no differences were recorded in herd A.
   Conclusions: The current investigation explores for the first time the
   clinical efficacy of vaccinations against S. aureus infections in MB,
   showing encouraging results regarding reduction in mastitis and somatic
   cell count; the polyvalent mastitis vaccine may be considered an
   additional tool for in-herd S aureus infection and should be associated
   to other control procedures to maximize its properties.},

Abstract = {Since November 2016, Europe witnesses another wave of incursion of
   highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5) viruses of the Asian
   origin goose/Guangdong (gs/GD) lineage. Infections with H5 viruses of
   clade 2.3.4.4b affect wild bird and poultry populations. H5 viruses of
   clades 2.2, 2.3.1.2c and 2.3.4.4a were detected previously in Europe in
   2006, 2010 and 2014. Clades 2.2.1.2 and 2.3.2.1.c are endemic in Egypt
   and Western Africa, respectively and have caused human fatalities.
   Evidence exists of their co-circulation in the Middle East. Subtype H5
   viruses of low pathogenicity (LPAI) are endemic in migratory wild bird
   populations. They potentially mutate into highly pathogenic phenotypes
   following transmission into poultry holdings. However, to date only the
   gs/GD H5 lineage had an impact on human health. Rapid and specific
   diagnosis marks the cornerstone for control and eradication of HPAI
   virus incursions. We present the development and validation of five
   real-time RT-PCR assays (RT-qPCR) that allow sequencing-independent
   pathotype and clade-specific distinction of major gs/GD HPAI H5 virus
   clades and of Eurasian LPAI viruses currently circulating. Together with
   an influenza A virus-generic RT-qPCR, the assays significantly speed up
   time-to-diagnosis and reduce reaction times in a OneHealth approach of
   curbing the spread of gs/GD HPAI viruses.},

Abstract = {The key role of cell cultures in different scientific fields is
   worldwide recognized, both as in vitro research models alternative to
   laboratory animals and substrates for biological production. However,
   many safety concerns rise from the use of animal/human cell lines that
   may be tumorigenic, leading to potential adverse contaminations in
   cell-derived biologicals.
   In order to evaluate the suitability of 13 different cell lines for
   Poliovirus vaccine production, safety and quality, in vitro/in vivo
   tumorigenicity and Poliovirus propagation properties were evaluated.
   Our results revealed that non-human primate cell lines CYNOM-K1, FRhK-4,
   4MBr-5 and 4647 are free of tumorigenic features and represent highly
   susceptible substrates for attenuated Sabin Poliovirus strains. In
   particular, FRhK-4 and 4647 cell lines are characterized by a higher in
   vitro replication, resulting indicated for the use in large-scale
   production field.},

Abstract = {Traditional Italian pork products can be consumed after variable drying
   periods, where the temporal decrease of water activity spans from
   optimal to inactivating values. This makes it necessary to A) consider
   the bias factor when applying culture-medium-based predictive models to
   sausage; B) apply the dynamic version (described by differential
   equations) of those models; C) combine growth and death models in a
   continuous way, including the highly uncertain growth/no growth range
   separating the two regions.
   This paper tests the applicability of published predictive models on the
   responses of Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia enterocolitica to
   dynamic conditions in traditional Italian pork sausage, where the
   environment changes from growth-supporting to inhibitory conditions, so
   the growth and death models need to be combined. The effect of
   indigenous lactic acid bacteria was also taken into account in the
   predictions.
   Challenge tests were carried out using such sausages, inoculated
   separately with L. monocytogenes and Y. enterocolitica, stored for 480
   hat 8, 12, 18 and 20 C. The pH was fairly constant, while the water
   activity changed dynamically. The effects of the environment on the
   specific growth and death rate of the studied organisms were predicted
   using previously published predictive models and parameters.
   Microbial kinetics in many products with a long shelf-life and dynamic
   internal environment, could result in both growth and inactivation,
   making it difficult to estimate the bacterial concentration at the time
   of consumption by means of commonly available predictive software tools.
   Our prediction of the effect of the storage environment, where the water
   activity gradually decreases during a drying period, is designed to
   overcome these difficulties. The methodology can be used generally to
   predict and visualise bacterial kinetics under temporal variation of
   environments, which is vital when assessing the safety of many similar
   products. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Acrylamide dietary intakes from selected street foods in youth
   population are estimated. The intake evaluation was carried out by
   combining levels of acrylamide in food, analytically determined by high
   performance liquid chromatography, with individual consumption data
   recorded using a questionnaire applied to a group of 200 students aged
   19 to 30. The mean value of acrylamide exposure was recorded to be 0.452
   mu g/kg bw/day, while the average intakes at 50th and 95th percentile
   were 0.350 mu g/kg bw/day and 1.539 mu g/kg bw/day, respectively. The
   street food categories that contributed the most to acrylamide intake
   are pizza and French fries. The margins of exposure, based on benchmark
   dose limits defined for neoplastic effects and peripheral neuropathy,
   are within the range of values that indicate a concern for public health
   as defined by European Authority for Food Safety (EFSA), confirming the
   needed effort to reduce acrylamide dietary exposure.},

Abstract = {In relation to consumer demand, crustaceans and cephalopods are sold as
   both fresh and defrosted. It is well known that total volatile basic
   nitrogen (TVB-N) and volatile amine values, especially, biogenic amines
   and biogenic amine index, are expression of freshness of fish products,
   but there is a lack of knowledge of their acceptability limits, for
   crustaceans and cephalopods. In order to assess these limits, real-time
   shelf life tests were carried out, relating the results of TVB-N,
   biogenic amines and BAI to the sensory evaluation of crustaceans and
   cuttlefishes, both fresh and defrosted. TVB-N and biogenic amines have
   been analysed in many shrimp species and cuttlefishes purchased in
   Perugia (Central Italy), and BAI was calculated as the ratio between
   different biogenic amines. The results show levels of TVB-N and spermine
   different between shrimp and cuttlefish (TVB-N: 37 vs. 14 mg/100 g;
   spermine: 4 vs. 14 mg/kg, respectively) while the other biogenic amines
   and BAI are close to zero in both. Among biogenic amines, cadaverine and
   even more putrescine significantly affect BAI values and seem to be the
   most effective in assessing limits of acceptability during storage.},

Abstract = {Valorisation of former foodstuff products (FFP) in feed is part of a
   long-term strategy for sustainability. An approach to valorise FFP
   outside the waste value chain is their use as an alternative source of
   feed materials, with a subsequent optimisation of the environmental
   impact of products. In the current practice of food production, food
   packaging is provided to ensure the maintenance of food quality and
   safety during transport and storage. One of the problems of reusing FFP
   is how to deal with packaging materials or remains that can become
   residues in the feed. The aim of this study is to propose a fast and
   sensitive gravimetric method, fit for routine official controls, for the
   determination of packaging residues in feed. The developed method can
   briefly be summarised as: (1) visual selection of the undesired
   ingredients which can be identified as remnants of packaging materials;
   (2) weighing of the selected materials; (3) defatting; (4) dehydration;
   (5) final weighing; and (6) reporting of weight and percentage.
   Moreover, the method has been validated through the determination of
   some of the parameters listed in Council Regulation 2004/882/EC (i.e.,
   specificity, limit of quantification (LOQ), recovery, repeatability,
   within-laboratory reproducibility and measurement uncertainty).},

   mice (Apodemus alpicola, Apodemus flavicollis and Apodemus sylvaticus)
   in Italy. We achieved an overall correct classification rate of 86-98\%;
   the best results (100\% correct classification) were obtained for
   Apodemus sylvaticus calls. This minimally invasive, effective and
   low-cost method highlights the potential role of bioacoustics as a
   powerful tool for field discrimination of cryptic species of terrestrial
   mammals.},

Title = {First evidence of intersex condition in extensively reared mullets from

Abstract = {The term intersex describes alterations in gonadal development with the
   simultaneous presence of male and female reproductive stages in the same
   gonad of a gonochoristic species. In coastal and estuarine environments,
   euryhaline fish living in polluted waters such as Mugilidae can
   frequently show these sexual anomalies. In this work, we analysed adult
   specimens of three species of euryhaline mullets (Chelon labrosus, Liza
   aurata and Mugil cephalus) from two Sardinian lagoons (Marceddi and San
   Teodoro) devoted to extensive aquacultural practices, in order to
   identify putative alterations in gonads and in gamete development.
   Overall, 13 of the 158 mullets examined (8.2\%) were affected by gonadal
   disorders: four subjects (one C. labrosus, two L. aurata and one M.
   cephalus) exhibiting an intersex condition were found in the Marceddi
   lagoon and the other nine (five C. labrosus, two L. aurata and two M.
   cephalus) in the San Teodoro lagoon. Twelve of these gonads were
   classified as testis-ova (TOs) and one, belonging to a C. labrosus
   specimen, was a mixed gonadal tissue (MGT). Intersex condition was
   evaluated using an intersex index and all the recorded values showed a
   mild Ovotestis Severity Index (OSI). However, our findings suggest that
   fish gonadal disorders may be underestimated in extensive reared fish
   species, particularly in coastal brackish environments polluted by
   intensive agriculture and animal husbandry activities.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUNDIn Europe, Aedes albopictus is an invasive mosquito species
   known to be a major nuisance as well as a vector of a range of
   arboviruses. A number of studies have indicated that community
   participation programmes are an effective pest control tool to reduce
   mosquito populations. However, few studies have evaluated the
   effectiveness of a community-based approach in Europe. In this study, we
   examined two Ae. albopictus control strategies that implemented a
   community-based approach in northern Italy: one was a partial
   intervention that included a public education campaign and the
   larviciding of public spaces, and the other was a full intervention that
   additionally included a door-to-door campaign. This latter consisted of
   going door to door actively to educate residents about control measures
   and deliver larvicide tablets for treating catch basins at home. A site
   where no intervention measures were carried out was used as a control.
   RESULTSIn the site where a full intervention was carried out, Ae.
   albopictus egg density was 1.6 times less than at the site that received
   partial intervention, and 1.9 times less than at the non-intervention
   site. No significant reduction in egg density was achieved in the
   partial intervention site.
   CONCLUSIONSIn our study, Ae. albopictus populations were most
   effectively reduced by larviciding both public and private catch basins.
   Door-to-door education was effective in convincing residents to apply
   control measures on their property; however, this method was labour
   intensive and costly. It may be possible to reduce personnel costs by
   involving volunteers or using a hot spot' approach. (c) 2016 Society of

Abstract = {Micro-RNA (miRNA) are a family of small non-coding ribonucleic acids
   that inhibits post-transcriptionally the expression of their target
   messenger RNA (mRNA). We are interested in studying the involvement of
   miRNA in longevity and autoimmune diseases. In this study we compared
   the different expression of seven microRNAs between human plasma healthy
   controls, plasma samples of centenarians and samples from patients with
   rheumatoid arthritis. We used the Life Technologies' protocol to
   quantify seven miRNAs from 62 plasma samples: 20 healthy human controls,
   14 centenarians, 28 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. TaqMan MicroRNA
   assays were used to analyze the expression profiles of miR-125b-5p,
   miR-425-5p, miR-200b5p, miR-200c-3p, miR-579-3p, miR-212-3p, miR-21-5p
   and miR-126-3p. The relative expression of mature miRNAs was analyzed
   using software REST. Our results show that miR-425-5p, miR-21 and
   miR-212 significantly decreased in centenarians and in patients with
   rheumatoid arthritis compared with controls. Furthermore in this work we
   highlight a connection between corticosteroid treatment and miRNAs

Abstract = {Lobomycosis is a chronic skin mycosis endemic in Amazon regions
   characterized by chronic nodular or keloidal lesions caused by Lacazia
   loboi, an uncultivable fungus. Imported cases in nonendemic countries
   are rare and diagnosed after years. We describe a case of lobomycosis in
   a healthy 55-year-old Italian traveler who had acquired the infection
   during 5-day-honeymoon in the Amazon region of Venezuela in 1999.
   Several weeks after return, he recalled pruritus and papular skin
   lesions on the left lower limb, subsequently evolving to a plaque-like
   lesion. Blastomycosis and cryptococcosis were hypothesized based on
   microscopic morphology of yeast-like bodies found in three consecutive
   biopsies, although fungal cultures were always negative. In 2016,
   exfoliative cytology and a biopsy specimen examination showed round
   yeast-like organisms (6-12 mu m), isolated or in a chain, connected by
   short tubular projections fulfilling the morphologic diagnostic criteria
   of Lacazia spp. The microscopic diagnosis was confirmed by molecular
   identification.},

Abstract = {Iridoviridae are known to cause disease in sturgeons in North America.
   Here, histological and molecular methods were used to screen for this
   family of virus in sturgeons from various European farms with
   low-to-high morbidity. Some histological samples revealed basophilic
   cells in the gill and labial epithelia, strongly suggesting the
   accumulation of iridovirus particles. Newly developed generic PCR tests
   targeting the major capsid protein (MCP) gene of sturgeon iridoviruses
   identified in North America, namely the white sturgeon iridovirus and
   the Namao virus (NV), produced positive signals in most samples from
   four sturgeon species: Russian (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii), Siberian (A.
   baerii), Adriatic (A. naccarii) and beluga (Huso huso). The sequences of
   the PCR products were generally highly similar one another, with
   nucleotide identities greater than 98\%. They were also related to
   (74-88\%), although distinct from, American sturgeon iridoviruses. These
   European viruses were thus considered variants of a single new virus,
   provisionally named Acipenser iridovirus-European (AcIV-E). Moreover,
   three samples infected with AcIV-E showed genetic heterogeneity, with
   the co-existence of two sequences differing by five nucleotides. One of
   our European samples carried a virus distinct from AcIV-E, but closely
   related to NV identified in Canada (95\%). This study demonstrates the
   presence of two distinct sturgeon iridoviruses in Europe: a new genotype
   AcIV-E and an NV-related virus.},

Journal = {TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},

Pages = {610-614},
Abstract = {Rickettsiae (family Rickettsiaceae, order Rickettsiales) are obligate
   intracellular bacteria transmitted by arthropod vectors. Several
   Rickettsia species causing vector-borne rickettsioses belong to the
   spotted fever group (SFG). Traditionally, Rickettsia conorii has been
   considered as the main etiologic agent of Mediterranean spotted fever.
   However, the molecular characterization of rickettsiae allowed
   identifying other species involved in spotted fever in the Mediterranean
   region.
   In this study, 42 ticks collected from humans were subjected to
   morphological identification and molecular characterization of
   Rickettsia species potentially involved in human rickettsiosis in
   Sicily.
   Fourteen ticks positive to at least two Rickettsia spp. molecular
   markers were used in the study. Identified Rickettsia spp. included R.
   conorii, found in Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato and Rhipicephalus
   turanicus, Rickettsia aeschlimannii found in Hyalomma marginatum,
   Hyalomma lusitanicum, Dermacentor marginatus and Ixodes ricinus,
   Rickettsia massiliae found in R. turanicus and R. sanguineus s.L, and
   Rickettsia slovaca found in D. marginatus and R. sanguineus s.l.
   Our results showed a great variety of zoonotic Rickettsia spp. in ticks
   collected from humans in Sicily. The Rickettsia spp. reported in this
   study were identified in previously recognized or new potential tick
   vectors in Europe, highlighting the risk of infection by different
   Rickettsia spp. for humans bitten by ticks in Sicily.},

Abstract = {Field observations indicate that the impact of velogenic Newcastle
   disease virus (vNDV) is more severe in countries with concomitant
   circulation of low pathogenicity avian influenza virus, as is the case
   in the Middle East, in particular in Israel, where H9N2 and NDV are
   endemic. In our study, we evaluated how the exposure of chickens to an
   H9N2 challenge either favours or interferes with a subsequent vNDV
   infection and its transmission to sentinels. For this purpose, single
   vNDV and sequential H9/NDV challenges were performed with increasing
   doses of vNDV (10(1)-10(6) EID50). The H9N2 challenge made birds more
   susceptible to the vNDV, lowering the minimum dose required to cause an
   infection, exacerbating the clinical outcome, while delaying the onset
   of the disease and time of death. Interestingly, the presence and degree
   of these seemingly contrasting effects were dose-dependent and not
   mutually exclusive.},

Title = {The Influence of Prednisone on the Efficacy of Cabazitaxel in Men with
   Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CANCER},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {14},
Pages = {2663-2668},
Abstract = {Background: Cabazitaxel is a second-generation taxane that is approved
   for use with concomitant low dose daily prednisone in metastatic
   castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) after docetaxel failure.
   Since the role of daily corticosteroids in improving cabazitaxel
   efficacy or ameliorating its safety profile has not been adequately
   investigated so far, we compared outcomes of patients receiving
   cabazitaxel with or without daily corticosteroids in a retrospective
   single-Institution cohort of mCRPC patients.
   Patients and methods: Medical records of deceased patients with
   documented mCRPC treated with cabazitaxel following prior docetaxel
   between January, 2011 and January, 2017 were reviewed at the single
   participating center. Patients who were receiving daily doses of
   systemic corticosteroids other than low dose daily prednisone or
   prednisolone (<= 10 mg a day) were excluded. The primary end point of
   this analysis was overall survival (OS). Secondary end-points were
   exposure to cabazitaxel as well as incidence of grade 3-4 adverse
   events. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards
   regression was used to evaluate prednisone use and other variables as
   potentially prognostic for overall survival.
   Results: Overall, among 91 patients, 57 patients received cabazitaxel
   concurrently with low dose prednisone and 34 patients did not receive
   concurrent prednisone. The median overall survival of the population was
   9.8 months (interquartile range, 9 to 14). Patients receiving prednisone
   had an overall survival of 9 months (interquartile range, 8 to 12) vs.
   14 months (interquartile range, 9.4 to 16.7) for patients not treated
   with prednisone. Approximately 45\% of patients had a >30\% PSA decline
   at 12 weeks. Prednisone use was not significantly prognostic for overall
   survival or PSA decline >= 30\% rates on regression analyses.
   Importantly, a >30\% PSA decline at 12, but not at 3, 6, 9 weeks, was
   prognostic for improved survival at multivariate analysis
   Conclusions: The data presented here support the hypothesis that
   omitting daily corticosteroids in cabazitaxel-treated patients has no
   negative impact on either survival or safety profile. In the large
   prospective trial CABACARE, cabazitaxel-treated patients will be
   randomized to receive or not receive daily prednisone. The CABACARE
   (EudraCT n. 2016-003646-81) study is currently ongoing at University
   Federico II of Naples and at other multiple participating centers in
   Italy.},

Abstract = {We report three new records of leatherback sea turtle, Dermochelys
   coriacea (Vandelli, 1761) recovered in February 2011 and in
   spring-summer 2016 in the Strait of Sicily. The individuals were handed
   over dead to the IZS of Palermo for necropsy. The first specimen
   measured 139 and 91 cm of CCL and CCW respectively and was found beached
   and alive but died a few hours later for septicemia. The second measured
   110 cm of CCL and 83 cm of CCW and showed a deep wound on its head
   probably due to contact with a boat propeller. The third individual
   measured 134 cm of CCL and 96 cm of CCW and had plastic bags, a piece of
   fishing net and debris of various nature in the stomach. For the second
   individual it was not possible to determine the sex because of the
   advanced state of decomposition, while the other two specimens were
   females and showed a typical picture of an immature ovary. These new
   records increase the knowledge on the presence of this species in the
   Mediterranean Sea and in particular along the Sicilian coast and are
   also useful for preparing strategic conservation plans.},

Abstract = {The evolution of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses
   (HPAI-H5N1) has resulted in the appearance of a number of diverse groups
   of HPAI-H5N1 based on the presence of genetically similar clusters of
   their haemagglutinin sequences (clades). An H5 antigen encoded by a
   recombinant baculovirus and expressed in insect cells was used for
   oil-emulsion-based vaccine prototypes. In several experiments,
   vaccination was performed at 10 days of age, followed by challenge
   infection on day 21 post vaccination (PV) with HPAI-H5N1 clades 2.2,
   2.2.1, and 2.3.2. A further challenge infection with HPAI-H5N1 clade
   2.2.1 was performed at day 42 PV. High haemagglutination inhibition
   titres were observed for the recH5 vaccine antigen, and lower
   haemagglutination inhibition titres for the challenge virus antigens.
   Nevertheless, the rate of protection from mortality and clinical signs
   was 100\% when challenged at 21 days PV and 42 days PV, indicating
   protection over the entire broiler chicken rearing period without a
   second vaccination. The unvaccinated control chickens mostly died
   between two and five days after challenge infection. A low level of
   viral RNA was detected by reverse transcription followed by a
   quantitative polymerase chain reaction in a limited number of birds for
   a short period after challenge infection, indicating a limited spread of
   HPAI-H5N1 at flock level. Furthermore, it was observed that the vaccine
   can be used in a differentiation infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA)
   approach, based on the detection of nucleoprotein antibodies in
   vaccinated/challenged chickens. The vaccine fulfilled all expectations
   of an inactivated vaccine after one vaccination against challenge with
   different clades of H5N1-HPAI and is suitable for a DIVA approach.},

Abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes (L.m.) is an agent of serious foodborne illness.
   It is a major concern for the food industry, since microorganism,
   growing in biofilms is protected against cleaning and disinfection and
   is difficult to eradicate. Aim of this study was to develop a protocol
   to assess the ability of two flexible packaging materials, named HGP40
   and GND35, submitted to corona discharge treatment, to limit the
   production of L.m. biofilm at 12 +/- 1 degrees C. Two strains were
   selected for this study: L.m ATCC 7644 and L.m. EURL 12MOB098LM isolated
   from dairy products. Results suggest that both L.m. strains were able to
   form biofilm on packaging materials tested. The differences on HGP40 and
   GND35s treated and not treated surfaces were not statistically
   significant.},

Abstract = {After thirty years, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) still
   represents the biggest crisis in the field of food safety. Initially
   detected in the United Kingdom in 1986, BSE spread to many other
   countries all over the world, involving approximately 200,000 cattle.
   The origin of BSE is uncertain, but epidemiological studies suggest that
   the source was cattle feed prepared from prion-infected animal tissues.
   The implementation of the drastic measures, including the ban of meat
   and bone meal from livestock feed and the removal of specified risk
   material from the food chain, has eventually resulted in a significant
   decline of the epidemic. For many years, it was believed that the
   disease was caused by transmission of a single prion strain. However,
   since 2004 two types of BSE, with distinct phenotypical characteristics,
   have been detected in Italy and France. These atypical types are
   characterized by distinct Western Blot profiles of abnormal
   proteaseresistant prion protein, named high-type (H-BSE) and low-type
   (L-BSE). At present, there is no comprehensive information about the
   origin of the atypical BSEs (sporadic vs. acquired), and data about the
   pathogenesis of both atypical forms are very limited as compared to the
   classical type (C-BSE). This chapter will provide a well-organized
   overview of what is known about classical and atypical BSE. It will
   review information on the main epidemiological features, pathogenesis,
   and the criteria for routine diagnosis based on rapid tests,
   histological, immunohistochemical, and Western blot analysis.
   Furthermore, a brief overview about the most recently in vitro
   techniques will be also provided.},

Title = {SANIST: optimization of a technology for compound identification based

Abstract = {Electrospray Ionization and collision induced dissociation tandem mass
   spectrometry are usually employed to obtain compound identification
   through a mass spectra match. Different algorithms have been developed
   for this purpose (for example the NIST match algorithm). These
   approaches compare the tandem mass spectra of the unknown analyte with
   the tandem mass spectra spectra of known compounds inserted in a
   database. The compounds are usually identified on the basis of spectral
   match value associated with a probability of recognition. However, this
   approach is not usually applied to multiple reaction monitoring
   transition spectra achieved by means of triple quadrupole apparatus,
   mainly due to the lack of a transition spectra database. The Surface
   Activated Chemical Ionization-Electrospray-NIST Bayesian model database
   search (SANIST) platform has been recently developed for new potential
   metabolite biomarker discovery, to confirm their identity and to use
   them for clinical and diagnostic applications. Here, we present an
   improved version of the SANIST platform that extends its application to
   forensic, pharmaceutical, and food analysis studies, where the compound
   identification rules are strict. The European Union (EU) has set
   directives for compound identification (EU directive 2002/657/EC). We
   have applied the SANIST method to identification of
   11-nor-9-carboxytetrahydro-cannabinol in urine samples (an example of a
   forensic application), circulating levels of the immunosuppressive drug
   tacrolimus in blood (an example of a pharmaceutical application) and
   glyphosate in fruit juice (an example of a food analysis application)
   that meet the EU directive requirements. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley

Abstract = {Pasteurella multocida is a widespread pathogen associated with major
   animal diseases of economic significance. Despite this, little is known
   about the capsular types, virulence gene pattern, and antimicrobial
   susceptibility of isolates from hosts affected by different diseases,
   and no data are available in Italy. One hundred eighty six isolates of
   P. multocida, were taken from different species in different states of
   health in several Italian regions, and were tested for genes encoding
   for capsular types (cap) and major virulence factors (tbpA, toxA, hgbB
   and pfhA). Antimicrobial susceptibility was investigated with the agar
   diffusion test. The majority of isolates was capA+. However, the
   distribution differed according to species and disease of origin, with a
   greater heterogeneity in isolates from rabbits; capE was never found,
   while capB was detected once. Only capA+ and capF+ strains tested
   positive for pfhA. Conversely, almost all capD+ isolates were hgbB+. In
   bovine respiratory disease, pfhA+/tbpA+/capA+ isolates predominated,
   while tbpA+/toxA+/capD+ isolates predominated in sheep. Overall, low
   levels of resistance were found, with full susceptibility to ceftiofur
   and florfenicol. Lower susceptibility to older antimicrobials was
   recorded, since only approximately 1/3 of the isolates showed
   susceptibility to tylosin and erythromycin, and resistance to
   tetracycline (7.5\%), and trimethoprim - sulphametoxazole (4.8\%) was
   also observed.},

Abstract = {Aggressiveness is reported to be the most important public health issue
   related to both owned and free-roaming dogs. Common approaches to assess
   canine aggressiveness are temperament tests. The main aim of this study
   was to evaluate whether one such test, the Socially Acceptable Behaviour
   (SAB) test, created to evaluate aggressive and fearful behaviour in dogs
   in the Netherlands, could be used reliably to assess dog aggression and
   fear in a population of owned dogs in Central Italy. Reactions to the
   test were recorded and compared to the owners' perception of their dog's
   aggressiveness using a validated questionnaire (C-BARQ). Dogs showing
   aggressive reactions during the test obtained significantly higher (more
   aggressive) scores on the C-BARQ subscales `stranger-directed
   aggression' (SDA p < 0.001), `owner-directed aggression' (ODA p = 0.03),
   and `familiar dog aggression' (FDA p = 0.006), than dogs who did not
   react aggressively. Logistic regression analysis revealed that 7 of the
   SAB-subtests were predictive of the SDA score. The findings indicated
   that aggression directed toward unfamiliar people can be reliably
   assessed using the SAB test for a population of Italian pet dogs.},

Abstract = {Endosulfan, a highly toxic insecticide and acaricide, was globally
   banned under the Stockholm Convention in May 2011 because of its threats
   to human health and the environment. Despite the ban on its use,
   endosulfan is still present in the environment, causing poisoning events
   in domestic animals and wildlife. Toxicologic analysis of poisoned
   animals conducted by the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale del
   Mezzogiorno revealed that in the past 3 y, this pesticide has not
   disappeared in the regions of interest. More than 650 samples (baits and
   animal organs) collected from 2013 to 2015 were analyzed through
   solid-phase extraction followed by gas chromatography-electron capture
   detection. This methodology allowed us to identify 45 positive samples
   from the Calabria region of southern Italy (10.2 \% of the total
   samples). Most were samples of gastric content (alpha-endosulfan range:
   1.27-3,800 mg/kg) and baits (alpha-endosulfan range: 92-1,497 mg/kg).
   Lower concentrations of pesticide were found in samples of stomach
   (alpha-endosulfan: 6.7-118 mg/kg) and liver (alpha-endosulfan: 0.38-14.2
   mg/kg).},

   calculated was lower than 1\%, and the efficiency was reported to be
   higher than 96\% in every assay. An internal amplification control was
   used to detect possible false negatives. The method was validated by
   means of laboratory-prepared samples mixing different species. Moreover,
   18 commercial dairy samples were analyzed by both real-time PCR and
   isoelectric focusing, the official European Union reference method. The
   4 TaqMan assays were confirmed to be a useful tool for milk and dairy

Abstract = {A simple and efficient method was developed for simultaneous analysis of
   five illegal residual beta(2)-agonists in cattle hair. beta(2)-Agonists
   were quantified by ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled
   with electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry operating in
   positive multiple-reaction monitoring mode. The method was validated as
   quantitative confirmatory method according to the EU Decision
   2002/657/EC: instrumental linearity, specificity, precision, recovery,
   decision limit (CC alpha) and detection capability (CC beta) were
   evaluated. The recovery were greater than 90\% and the method appeared
   suitable for the control of these beta(2)-agonists in cattle hair
   samples with LOQ values between 4.9 and 5.5 mu g/kg. This method could
   represent a simple and cheap approach to confirm beta(2)-agonists
   contamination of cattle for feeding in a not invasive way and before
   slaughter operations.

Abstract = {The diagnostic activity on wild animals implies a hard laboratory
   protocol where multiple disciplines, from biology to pathological
   anatomy until the biotechnological techniques, must be integrated to
   establish the causes of death. To demonstrate these concepts, the
   analytical approach adopted for an alpine ibex (Capra ibex) found dead
   in a mountain area of North Western Italy was described. The animal
   showed sub-costal and lymph nodes collections of green-yellow pus,
   fibrinous pleuropneumonia and catarrhal-hemorrhagic enteritis. Purulent
   process was ascribed to Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, the
   causative agent of caseous lymphadenitis or pseudotuberculosis,
   pleuropneumonia to Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica and
   enteritis to Mannheimia haemolytica. Parasitic bronchopneumonia in the
   caudal lobes of the lung, a severe enteric infestation by
   gastro-intestinal and pulmonary strongyles and coccidia were found. The
   cause of death in the studied ibex appeared to be a consequence of an
   association between various pathological processes, with bacteriological
   and parasitic etiology.},

Abstract = {Sporadic outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) have occurred in
   Libya for almost fifty years. During the spring of 2013, a countrywide
   serosurvey was undertaken to assess the level of FMD virus circulation
   and identify FMD virus serotypes in the country. A total of 4221 sera
   were collected, comprising samples from large ruminants (LR; n=1428
   samples from 357 farms) and small ruminants (SR; n=2793 samples from 141
   farms). FMD sero-prevalence of NSP antibodies determined by ELISA were
   19.0\% (271/1428) with 95\% CI (16.9-21.0) and 13.5\% (378/2793) with
   95\% CI (12.3-14.8) for LR and SR samples, respectively. The
   sero-prevalence of NSP antibodies in LR was 12.3\% and 19.8\% for age
   group < 1 year and >= 1 year, respectively (X-2=4.95, P=0.026), while in
   SR was 3.7\%, 13.6\% and 21.3\% for age group < 1 year, 1-2 year and > 2
   year, respectively (X-2=118.1, P=0.000). These observed NSP serologic
   profiles support the hypothesis of an endemic level of FMD circulation
   in Libya. All positive sera were tested for SP antibodies for O, A and
   SAT-2 FMD virus serotypes. Serotype O was the dominant circulating
   serotype followed by serotype A, while evidence of SAT-2 was not found.
   These data provide an insight into the wider epidemiology of FMD in
   Libya, and contribute to field and laboratory investigations that during
   2013 serotype O (O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 lineage) was isolated from clinical
   samples collected from the country.},

Abstract = {The consumption habits of 766 Italian shooters (96\% males, 4\%
   females), on average 52 years old, have been investigated, in Italy,
   through the distribution of questionnaires delivered during shooters'
   attendance to training and teaching courses, in compliance with
   853/2004/EC Regulation provisions on food hygiene. The most consumed
   wild species recorded were pheasant > woodcock > choke among feathered
   animals, and wild boar > hare > roe deer among mammals, respectively. An
   average of 100-200 g game per serving (four servings per month) was
   consumed, with highest intakes of 3000 g per month; meat, liver, and
   heart were the preferred food items. Mammalian and feathered game was
   regularly consumed with friends and relatives in 83\% and in 60\% of
   cases, respectively. Accounting for an inventoried population of 751,876
   shooters in Italy, it is estimated that there is regular consumption of
   wild game in around the 3\% of the Italian population. More than 80\% of
   responders were aware of health risks related to game handling and to
   food safety issues. Due to the occurrence in wild boar meat and liver of
   the heavy metal cadmium (Cd), the persistent organic pollutant
   perfluorooctan sulphonic acid (PFOS), and the radionuclide (137)cesium
   (Cs-137), it was possible to demonstrate the usefulness of such a food
   consumption database for intake assessment in this sensitive group of
   consumers. In high consumers of wild boar, threshold concentrations for
   intakes have been estimated in the ranges of 48-93ngg(-1) for Cd,
   35-67ngg(-1) for PFOS and 0.20-0.34 Bq kg(-1) for Cs-137.},

Title = {Hepatic lipidosis in high-yielding dairy cows during the transition
   period: haematochemical and histopathological findings},
Journal = {ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {57},
Number = {1},
Pages = {74-80},
Abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess the severity and distribution of
   hepatic lipidosis in high-yielding dairy cows during the transition
   period by the evaluation of body condition score (BCS), serum levels of
   non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and -hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and
   histological liver lipid content (GdL). Twenty-seven dairy cows, with a
   milk production of similar to 10000 kg per year were enrolled in an
   experiment. Clinical examination was performed to evaluate the health
   status or the presence of periparturient diseases after calving. Animals
   were divided into two groups: healthy (HG; n=11) and sick (SG; n=16).
   The evaluation of BCS, NEFA, BHB and liver biopsies were performed at 15
   +/- 5 days prepartum (T0), 10 +/- 2 days postpartum (T1), 30 +/- 2 days
   postpartum (T2) and 50 +/- 2 days postpartum (T3). Two-way
   repeated-measure ANOVA was applied to assess statistical significance of
   sampling time and between groups for all variables. Pearson's
   correlation coefficient was used to investigate the relationship between
   all variables. Results showed BCS loss from T0 to T3 in SG and a
   significant increase of NEFA and BHB at T1. The GdL began to be mild at
   T0 increasing and becoming moderate to severe at T1, fairly regressing,
   but not disappearing, at T2 and T3, in both groups. This study showed
   that high lipomobilisation with a mild to moderate fat infiltration does
   not imply that ketosis or other periparturient diseases might be
   present. Our results suggest that hepatic lipidosis is associated with
   long-term histological and metabolic changes in dairy cows.},

Abstract = {African swine fever (ASF) is a devastating disease for which there is no
   vaccine available. The ASF virus (ASFV) primarily infects cells of the
   myeloid lineage and this tropism is thought to be crucial for disease
   pathogenesis. A detailed in vitro characterization of the interactions
   of a virulent Sardinian isolate (22653/14) and a tissue culture adapted
   avirulent strain (BA71V) of ASFV with porcine monocytes, unactivated
   (moM Phi), classically (moM1) and alternatively (moM2) activated
   monocyte-derived macrophages was conducted in an attempt to better
   understand this relationship. Using a multiplicity-of infection (MOI) of
   1, both viruses were able to infect monocytes and macrophage subsets,
   but BA71V presented a reduced ability to infect moM1 compared to
   22653/14, with higher expression of early compared to late proteins.
   Using an MOI of 0.01, only 22653/14 was able to replicate in all the
   macrophage subsets, with initially lowest in moM1 and moM2. No
   differences were observed in the expression of CD163 between ASFV
   infected and uninfected bystander cells. ASFV down-regulated CD16
   expression but did not modulate MHC class II levels in monocytes and
   macrophage subsets. BA71V-infected but not 22653/14-infected moM Phi and
   moM2 presented with a reduced expression of MHC class I compared to the
   mock-infected controls. Higher levels of IL-18, IL1-beta and IL-1 alpha
   were released from moM1 after infection with BA71V compared to 22653/14
   or mock-infected control. These results revealed differences between
   these ASFV strains, suggesting that virulent isolates have evolved
   mechanisms to counteract activated macrophages responses, promoting
   their survival, dissemination in the host and so ASF pathogenesis. (C)

Title = {Determination of Ten Corticosteroids in Illegal Cosmetic Products by a
   Simple, Rapid, and High-Performance LC-MS/MS Method},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {2017},
Abstract = {The aim of our present work was the development of a rapid
   high-performance liquid chromatography method with electrospray
   ionization and tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC-ESI-MS/MS) for the
   determination of several corticosteroids in cosmetic products.
   Corticosteroids are suspected to be illegally added in cosmetic
   preparations in order to enhance the curative effect against some skin
   diseases. Sample preparation step consists in a single extraction with
   acetonitrile followed by centrifugation and filtration. The compounds
   were separated by reversed-phase chromatography with water and
   acetonitrile (both with 0.1\% formic acid) gradient elution and detected
   by ESI-MS positive and negative ionization mode. The method was
   validated at the validation level of 0.1mg kg(-1). Linearity was studied
   in the 5-250 mu gL(-1) range and linear coefficients (r(2)) were all
   over 0.99. The accuracy and precision of the method were satisfactory.
   The LOD ranged from 0.085 to 0.109mg kg(-1) and the LOQ from 0.102 to
   0.121mg kg(-1). Mean recoveries for all the analytes were within the
   range 91.9-99.2\%. The developed method is sensitive and useful for
   detection, quantification, and confirmation of these corticosteroids in
   cosmetic preparations and can be applied in the analysis of the
   suspected samples under investigation.},

Abstract = {Ex-food or former food products (FFPs) have been proposed as one of the
   categories with great promise as alternative feed ingredients. FFPs'
   nutritional potential is not yet fully exploited. Therefore, the aim of
   this study was to perform a nutritional evaluation of selected FFPs. In
   particular, six samples of mixed FFPs, all based on bakery products,
   were analysed for moisture, crude protein, ether extract, crude fibre,
   neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre, starch and ash.
   Nitrogen-free extractives and non-structural carbohydrate were also
   determined. Based on FFPs' composition data, estimation of digestible
   energy and metabolisable energy values for pigs were calculated.
   Further, the in vitro digestibility values of FFPs were investigated
   using a multi-step enzymatic technique. A wheat sample was included as a
   control feed ingredient in the study. All data were reported on dry
   matter basis. FFPs have shown a nutrient composition comparable with
   cereal grains. In the tested FFPs, the average protein content was
   10.0\% and the average starch content was 52.4\%. Nitrogen-free
   extractive ranged from 61.2\% to 74.7\%, whereas non-structural
   carbohydrate ranged from 58.5\% to 79.3\%. Compared with wheat, FFPs
   were characterised by a relative high fat content, averaging about
   10.1\%. The relatively high nitrogen-free extractive/non-structural
   carbohydrate/starch and fat concentration designated FFPs as valuable
   energy sources. Digestible energy and metabolisable energy averages were
   17.2 and 16.9MJkg(-1), respectively. The average in vitro digestibility
   value of FFPs samples was 88.2\%+/- 5.8\%, comparable with that of wheat
   (90.6\%+/- 1.6\%). FFPs are a fat-fortified version of common cereals
   grains. The high energy content and digestibility values elect FFPs as
   promising non-traditional ingredients for swine.},

Title = {Welfare parameters in dairy cows reared in tie-stall and open-stall

Journal = {ANIMAL SCIENCE PAPERS AND REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Pages = {379-386},
Abstract = {The increasing attention paid by both the legislature and consumers
   concerning animal welfare has raised criticism regarding the tie stall
   housing system of dairy cattle, since it restricts voluntary movement
   and limits the social behaviour of cows. The aim of this study was to
   compare the welfare of dairy cows kept in a tie-stall (TS)and an
   open-stall (OS) system by assessing metabolic, immunological and
   stress-related parameters. The study involved 155 cows in 18 farms
   located in Tuscany. Blood samples were collected in the morning in order
   to measure: aspartate-aminotransferase (AST), alanine-aminotransferase
   (ALT), betahydroxybutyrate (BHBA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN),
   nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), total proteins (TP), creatinine
   (Creat), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), phosphorus (P), lysozyme (SL),
   haptoglobin (Hp), and oxygen free radicals (OFR). At the same time, hair
   samples were collected to measure cortisol levels and the body condition
   score was recorded. The results showed that the housing system affected
   AST, ALT, BHBA, BUN, SL and OFR levels. Most parameters showed values
   within the range of reference. However, the OFR level was higher in the
   OS system, probably due to the higher productivity than in TS. Cortisol
   did not raise particular concern related to chronic stress, since the
   values were lower than the data reported in literature. The study
   revealed that the evaluation of welfare based on physiological
   parameters showed no severe signs of impairment in cows reared in the TS
   system.},

Abstract = {Objective: To monitor the spread and to evaluate the role for public
   health of Usutu virus (USUV) in an endemic area of Italy.
   Methods: The survey was retrospectively conducted by detecting USUV RNA
   and USUV antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid and serum samples collected
   between 2008 and 2011 from 915 patients with or without neurologic
   impairments in the area of the municipality of Modena, Italy. Organs of
   birds and pools of mosquitoes were also tested for USUV RNA. Positive
   samples were partially sequenced and used for phylogenetic analysis.
   Results: The presence of USUV RNA (1.1\%; 95\% confidence interval (CI)
   0.6-2.0) was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than that of West Nile
   virus (0\%; 95\% CI 0-0.33). USUV antibody level was 6.57\% (95\% CI
   4.87-8.82), and it was significantly higher (p < 0.05) compared to that
   of West Nile virus (p 2.96, 95\% CI 1.89-4.62). Partial genome
   sequencing of USUV strains detected in humans, birds and mosquitoes
   revealed high nucleotide sequence identity within them and with the USUV
   strains isolated in Central Europe.
   Conclusions: USUV infection in humans is not a sporadic event in the
   studied area, and USUV neuroinvasiveness has been confirmed. (C) 2016

Abstract = {The prevalence of Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of Q fever, in
   cattle and sheep raw milk farms was determined in Central Italy, an area
   in which dairy production plays an important economic role. Milk samples
   (n. 189), collected from 66 dairy farms in 2012-2013, were tested by a
   commercial real-time PCR assay. Seventeen dairy farms had at least one
   positive milk sample; percent positive was higher for cattle (50\%) than
   sheep (21\%) farms. Concerning milk, 15\% of samples tested overall gave
   a positive result, with the highest percentage of positivity observed
   for bovine milk compared with sheep milk (41\% and 12\%, respectively).
   In the only bovine farm repeatedly sampled during the study, C. burnetii
   contamination was persistently found for almost a year. The prevalence
   calculated for the sheep farms showed a discontinuous trend with a
   maximum peak in February. The results obtained underline the widespread
   presence of the pathogen in the considered geographical area, giving new
   epidemiological information. Since the milk route of elimination is a
   potential vehicle of infection for farmers, veterinarians and for dairy
   stakeholders in general, BTM screening by real-time PCR can be applied
   as a useful surveillance tool both for the identification of infected
   flocks and implementation of control programmes.},

Abstract = {A challenge test based on the inoculum of a multi-strain cocktail of
   Listeria innocua and Salmonella enterica viable cells was carried out to
   evaluate the capacity of an accelerated manufacturing technique
   (including conventional fermentation of the meat batter followed by
   freezing, slicing and drying) to guarantee the safety of Milano-type
   fermented sausages. The counts of S. enterica decreased by 1.5 and 1.6
   log CFU/g in the sausages inoculated with 2 and 4 log CFU/g,
   respectively, while a less notable reduction (0.4 log CFU/g) was
   recorded for L. innocua, independently from the inoculum load. The
   comparison between the main microbiological and physico-chemical
   features of non-inoculated fermented sausages, produced through either
   the accelerated or the traditional process, highlighted significant
   differences in the percent R.H. and a(w) values, as well as pH In both
   cases, the absence of Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes was
   ascertained. These outcomes encourage further investigation on the fate
   of these foodborne pathogens during a shelf-life challenge test. No
   differences were highlighted for the main sensory parameters analyzed.},

Abstract = {Geospatial database of farm locations and biosecurity measures are
   essential to control disease outbreaks. A study was conducted to
   establish geospatial database on poultry farms in Al-Jabal Al-Gharbi
   region of Libya, to evaluate the biosecurity level of each farm and to
   determine the seroprevalence of mycoplasma and its relation to
   biosecurity level. A field team of 7 Veterinarians belongs to the
   National Center of Animal Health was assigned for data recording and
   collection of blood samples. Personal information of the producers,
   geographical locations, biosecurity measures and description of the
   poultry farms were recorded. The total number of poultry farms in
   Al-Jabal Al-Gharbi Region is 461 farms distributed in 13 cities. Out of
   these, 102 broiler farms and one broiler breeder farm (10 houses) which
   were in operation during team visit were included in this study.
   Following collection of blood, sera were separated and tested by
   Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the presence of antibodies
   against Mycoplasma (General antigen for M. gallisepticum and M.
   synoviae). The seroprevalence of Mycoplasma in the region was 28\% (29
   poultry farms out of 103 were infected). About 50\% (23 out of 47) of
   poultry farms located in Garian city were infected with Mycoplasma and
   one significant cluster of Mycoplasma infection in the city was
   identified. Low level of biosecurity was found in poultry farms of the
   region. Out of the 103 farms included, 63\% of poultry houses has a
   ground of soil and 44\% of them has uncoated walls which may influence
   the proper cleaning and disinfection. Almost 100\% of the farms are at
   risk of exposure to diseases transmitted by wild birds such as avian
   influenza and Newcastle disease due to absence of wild birds control
   program. Although, 81\% of the farms have entry restrictions, only 20\%
   have disinfectants at entry which increase the risk of exposure to
   pathogens. The results of this study highlight the weakness points of
   biosecurity measures in poultry farms of Al-Jabal Al-Gharbi region and
   high seroprevalence of mycoplasma. Data collected in this study will
   assist the Veterinary authorities to apply effective disease control
   strategies.},

Abstract = {Liquid processing of 2D crystals offers scalable strategies for the
   production of 2D materials. Herein, we produce the hybrids of
   MoS2/graphene, consisting of few-layered nanosheets of luminescent MoS2
   and biofunctionalized few-layered graphene assisted by the Vmh2
   hydrophobin, a self-assembling adhesive fungal protein, through a green
   route of production. The functionalization of the graphene flakes
   assisted by Vmh2 adds surface charge, which enables electrostatic
   interaction between MoS2 and graphene flakes, leading to the van der
   Waals coupling. The surface morphology of 2D material based films is
   analyzed through optical imaging, scanning and transmission electron
   microscopy. The produced dispersions of MoS2, bGr and the hybrid
   solutions, are investigated by electrophoretic mobility, UV-Vis, Raman
   and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Interestingly, the effect of van der
   Waals interactions between the layers of MoS2 and bGr crystals are
   evidenced through the significant upshift of 14 cm(-1) in the G' Raman
   peak of graphene and an upshift of 1.4 cm(-1) of the A(1g) peak of MoS2.
   Due to the formation of heterostructures, significant quenching of the
   characteristic photoluminescence emitted from the monolayers of MoS2 was
   also observed, indicating the charge transfer process occurring between
   the crystal layers. This approach of scalable synthesis of 2D material
   based nano-bio hybrids offers economic and eco-friendly solutions to
   promote novel applications in biosensing and photodetection.},

Abstract = {Hens' eggs collected in home-producing farms located in different areas
   of the Campania region of southern Italy were analysed for six
   NDL-polychlorobiphenyls (PCB indicators), 17 polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxins
   (PCDDs) and polychlorodibenzofurans (PCDFs), and 12 congeners of
   dioxin-like PCBs (DL-PCBs). In the investigated area, waste from civil,
   industrial and hospital activities was illegally dumped and in many
   cases burned, so the area is called the `Land of fire'. This illicit
   practice has been considered the main source of pollution in this
   territory and the cause of the persistent organic pollutants' (POPs)
   contamination in the neighbouring lands intended for agricultural use
   and livestock. The results, which were obtained from the analysis of 56
   samples of eggs, showed levels of contamination by dioxins and PCBs that
   have often exceeded the action levels set by European Union
   Recommendation 711/2013 and sometimes even exceeded the maximum levels
   set by Commission Regulation (EU) 1259/2011. The median PCDD/Fs was 0.41
   pg TEQ g(-1) fat (range = 0.01-6.18 pg TEQ g(-1) fat) and the median
   concentration of DL-PCBs was 0.70 pg TEQ g(-1) fat (range = 0.01-14.60
   pg TEQ g(-1) fat), whereas NDL-PCBs median was 7.35 ng g(-1) fat (range
   = 0.48-67.55 ng g(-1) fat). Nevertheless, the estimated weekly intake
   (EWI) calculated for consumers of eggs home produced in Campania is
   lower than the tolerable weekly intake (TWI) established by the European
   Union Scientific Committee on Food (SCF).},

Abstract = {Despite their medical and veterinary importance, some tick species are
   so poorly studied, that their role within pathogen vector transmission
   cycles is difficult to assess. The tick Ixodes ventalloi is one such
   species, and its biology and phylogenetic status remain an issue of
   debate. In the present study, specimens of adult I. ventalloi (n=65
   females; n=31 males) infesting cats in the Lipari Island (Aeolian
   archipelago, Sicily, southern Italy) were characterized morphologically
   and molecularly, the latter based on mitochondrial 16S rRNA and
   cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) genes. The genetic data and
   phylogenetic analyses for both mitochondrial genes suggest the existence
   of two distinct genogroups. The ecological and epidemiological
   significance of the genetic structure within the I. ventalloi endemic
   population remains to be determined. The results highlight the need for
   further analysis of this tick species, including whole mitochondrial
   genome sequencing and crossbreeding studies, which will be pivotal to
   complement features of its status as a vector of pathogens.},

Abstract = {A gas-chromatographic single-quadrupole analytical method for the
   analysis of the 16 priority European Union (EU) polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs) in food is presented. The method fulfils the request
   of Regulation EU 836/2011 for an analytical procedure to be used for
   official control of PAHs in food in EU member states. The sample
   preparation involves a pressurised liquid extraction (PLE) with an
   in-cell clean-up step followed by a lipid removal using solid-phase
   extraction (SPE) on a styrene divinylbenzene stationary phase (SDVB) and
   a final gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) step. To reach a better
   sensitivity for all the analytes, including the heaviest last eluting
   PAHs, 3 l of the purified extract were injected in solvent vent mode
   using a programmable temperature vaporization (PTV) injector. The
   isobaric PAH isomers were successfully separated using an Agilent
   Technologies DB-17MS (20 m x 0.18 mm x 0.18 m) column. The method was
   fully validated using an in-house approach and the sensitivity, accuracy
   and precision obtained were satisfactory. The method expanded
   uncertainty was estimated and it was verified that it was below the
   maximum standard measurement uncertainty. Moreover, the results of 347
   samples of meat and meat products, fish and fish products and mussels
   collected from January 2012 to December 2016 in the Marche and Umbria
   regions of Italy are reported. None of the samples exceed the maximum
   levels fixed by EU Regulation 835/2011, and clams turned out to be the
   most contaminated among the food matrices analysed. Finally, an estimate
   of the sum of four marker PAHs (benzo{[}a]anthracene,
   benzo{[}b]fluoranthene, benzo{[}a]pyrene, chrysene) as indicator of the
   PAHs contamination was done by comparison with the 16 carcinogenic PAHs
   sum.},

Abstract = {Equids can be infected by a range of skin-dwelling filarial nematodes,
   including four species of the genus Onchocerca. Current literature on
   equine onchocercosis is fragmentary and often limited to isolated case
   reports. The present study aimed to describe a clinical case of equine
   onchocercosis caused by Onchocerca boehmi (Supperer, 1953) (syn.
   Elaeophora boehmi) in an 8-year-old gelding Belgian show jumper from
   northern Italy. The horse was presented with a firm and painless mass on
   the proximal third of the right metacarpal region. Ultrasound
   examination showed a peritendinous enlargement around the
   palmaro-lateral area of the tendons, characterized by an elongated
   hypoechoic and well-defined structure, embedding a coiled hyperechoic
   line. The metacarpal nodule was resected and histologically examined.
   Fragments of a parasitic nematode were detected, isolated and examined.
   The morphological analysis allowed identifying the nematode as O.
   boehmi. In addition, total genomic DNA was extracted from individual
   fragments using a commercial kit for the nematode identification and a
   comparative sequence analysis of the nematode cytochrome oxidase subunit
   1 (cox1) sequence with data available in the GenBankTM database revealed
   the closest identity (i.e. 91 \%) with that of Onchocerca lupi. Thus
   far, O. boehmi has only been reported in Austria and Iran, and
   information about its life-cycle and vectors is lacking. The systematic
   position of this species within the genus Onchocerca, not in Elaeophora
   where it was originally described, is in concordance with the
   morphological and molecular analysis. In this article, we describe the
   first autochthonous case of equine onchocercosis in Italy caused by O.
   boehmi and discuss novel parasitological, clinical, and pathological
   data on these pathogens of horses.},

Abstract = {In this study we investigated the circulation of methicillin-resistant
   Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in 2 dairy cattle farms (farm A and B),
   previously identified as MRSA-positive in bulk tank milk samples, and
   epidemiologically related to swine farms. Collected specimens included
   quarter milk samples and nasal swabs from dairy cows, pig nasal swabs
   collected at both the farm and slaughterhouse level, environmental dust
   samples, and human nasal swabs from the farms' owners and workers. The
   prevalence of MRSA was estimated at the herd level by testing quarter
   milk samples. The prevalence of MRSA was 4.8\% (3/63; 95\% confidence
   interval = 0-10.2\%) and 60\% (33/55; 95\% confidence interval =
   47.05-72.95) in farm A and B, respectively. In farm A, MRSA was also
   isolated from humans, pigs sampled at both farm and slaughterhouse
   level, and from environmental samples collected at the pig facilities.
   The dairy cattle facilities of farm A tested negative for MRSA. In farm
   B, MRSA was isolated from environmental dust samples in both the cattle
   and pig facilities, whereas nasal swabs collected from cows and from
   humans tested negative. Sixty-three selected MRSA isolates obtained from
   different sources in farm A and B were genetically characterized by
   multilocus sequence typing, spa-typing, ribosomal spacer-PCR, and also
   tested for the presence of specific virulence genes and for their
   phenotypical antimicrobial susceptibility by broth microdilution method.
   Different clonal complex (CC) and spa-types were identified, including
   CC398, CC97, and CC1, CC already reported in livestock animals in Italy.
   The MRSA isolates from quarter milk of farm A and B mostly belonged to
   CC97 and CC398, respectively. Both lineages were also identified in
   humans in farm A. The CC97 and CC398 quarter milk isolates were also
   identified as genotype GTBE and GTAF by ribosomal spacer-PCR
   respectively, belonging to distinct clusters with specific virulence and
   resistance patterns. The GTBE and GTAF clusters also included swine,
   environmental, and human isolates from both farms. A high heterogeneity
   in the genetic and phenotypic profiles was observed in environmental
   isolates, in particular from farm B. These results demonstrate the
   possibility of a dynamic sharing and exchange of MRSA lineages or
   genotypes between different species and farm compartments in
   mixed-species farms. The risk of transmission between swine and related
   dairy cattle herds should be considered. Our findings also confirm the
   zoonotic potential of livestock-associated MRSA and underline the
   importance of applying biosecurity measures and good hygiene practices
   to prevent MRSA spread at the farm level and throughout the food
   production chain.},

Title = {Neuronal and astrocytic involvement in striped dolphins (Stenella

Journal = {ACTA VIROLOGICA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {61},
Number = {4},
Pages = {495-497},
Abstract = {Dolphin morbillivirus (DMV), a highly pathogenic agent, may cause
   peculiar, ``brain-only{''} forms of infection (BOFDI), in which viral
   antigen and/ or genome is found exclusively in the brain from striped
   dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba). These BOFDIs show morphopathological
   similarities with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis and old dog
   encephalitis (ODE) in measles virus-infected patients and in canine
   distemper virus-infected dogs, respectively. The brain tissue from 3
   BOFDI-affected striped dolphins was investigated by means of double
   labelling-indirect immunofluorescence (DL-IIF) and ultrastructurally, in
   order to characterize the DMV-targeted neuronal and non-neuronal cell
   populations, along with the associated submicroscopic findings. Viral
   colonization of calbindin-immunoreactive (IR) and nitric oxide
   synthase-IR neurons was detected in the cerebral parenchyma from the 3
   DMV-infected dolphins under study, associated with nuclear (chromatin)
   and cytoplasmic (mitochondrial) ultrastructural changes. Furthermore, a
   limited viral targeting of brain astrocytes was found in these animals,
   all of which exhibited a prominent astrogliosis/astrocytosis. To the
   best of our knowledge, those herein reported should be the first
   submicroscopic pathology and neuropathogenetic data about BOFDI in
   striped dolphins. In this respect, the marked astrogliosis/astrocytosis
   and the low viral colonization of brain astrocytes in the 3 DMV-infected
   dolphins under investigation are of interest from the comparative
   pathology and viral neuropathogenesis standpoints, when compared with
   ODE-affected dogs, in whose brain a non-cytolytic,
   astrocyte-to-astrocyte infectious spread has been recently documented.
   Further studies aimed at characterizing the complex DMV-host
   interactions in BOFDI-affected striped dolphins are needed.},

Abstract = {In spring there is often a rise in honey bee mortality incidents. The
   aim of this study was to investigate the potential correlation, in the
   reported incidents, between exposure to pesticide treatments and virus
   infections. Here we summarize the situation in northeastern Italy during
   spring 2014, evaluated by monitoring 150 active ingredients and three
   honey bee viruses in dead honey bees and other matrices. At least one
   active ingredient was found in 72.2\% of the 79 dead honey bee samples,
   with the most abundant (59.4\%) being insecticides, mainly belonging to
   the class of neonicotinoids (41.8\%), followed by fungicides (40.6\%).
   Imidacloprid, chlorpyrifos, tau-fluvalinate, and cyprodinil were the
   most frequently detected active ingredients. Multiple virus infections
   were monitored, revealing a high prevalence of chronic bee paralysis
   virus (CBPV) and deformed wing virus (DWV), detected in all samples
   except one. 71 and 37\% of the CBPV- and DWV positive samples,
   respectively, showed a high number of viral copies per bee (> 10(7)).
   This work emphasizes possible relationship between spring mortality in
   honey bees and pesticide treatments. Honey bee viruses could
   synergistically exacerbate the negative impact of pesticides on honey
   bee health, endangering the survival of colonies.},

Abstract = {Diseases evolve constantly and research is needed to face emerging new
   threats. Evidences suggest that the impact of such threats will have its
   peak in the Mediterranean area. The FORE-Med, Foresight project for the
   Mediterranean, aims at identifying the future challenges on livestock
   health and aquaculture in this area, to ensure an effective coordination
   of research activities and the delivery of timely solution to emerging
   issues. One hundred experts with multidisciplinary background and coming
   from countries all around the Mediterranean basin were gathered to
   participate in a think-tank to develop a Strategic Research Agenda on
   animal health for Mediterranean up to 2030. A tailored foresight
   methodology was implemented, merging the best fit for purpose techniques
   (e.g. `7 questions', Social, Technological, Economical, Environmental,
   and Political (STEEP), analysis, scenario building, and backcasting).
   Both remote and face-to-face debates were held, to ensure a fruitful
   exchanges and participation among experts. Research needs were
   identified and prioritised, both on relevance and on temporal scale. The
   implemented participative approach allowed for the definition of a
   research priority list for animal health and aquaculture in the
   Mediterranean, which served as a basis to build a strategic research
   agenda. The latter is expected to satisfy the sectors' needs and
   guarantee a much-needed coordination for research activities in the
   Mediterranean area.},

Abstract = {A validated and accredited analytical method of inductively coupled
   plasma-mass spectrometry was used to determine the levels of 22 trace
   elements in 52 equine meat samples collected during 2015. Greater
   amounts of Zn, Fe, and Ca were found with mean values of over 25 mu g
   g(-1). Levels of non-essential trace elements, that is, Pb, Cd, Hg, and
   As, were generally low (mean values lower than 11.3 ng g(-1)). Equine
   gender and geographic origin of meats (Italy and Poland) were compared,
   with no significant differences being found, whereas equine meats could
   be differentiated from bovine through a multivariate approach. As
   regards trace element accumulation, evaluated considering slaughter age,
   Zn, Fe, Ca, and Cr showed greater increase. Finally, a good correlation
   was obtained between two pairs of trace elements, Zn/Fe (r = 0.82) and
   Ca/Fe (r = 0.87).},

Abstract = {This study aimed at evaluating the effect of Oregano vulgaris extract
   supplementation of heavy pig diet on the microbiological,

   Fabriano salamis were produced processing meat derived from pigs
   belonging to two dietary groups of 16 pigs each: CTRL group fed a
   commercial pelleted feed, and OR group fed the CTRL diet integrated with
   0.2\% of oregano extract. Ten salamis per group were collected at 0, 7,
   20 and 45 days of ripening and analysed for total viable count,
   enumeration of Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus spp, coagulase negative
   and positive staphylococci, Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp.,
   presence of Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogens, pH, water
   activity (a(w)) and colour (CIE L{*}a{*}b{*} colour system). At the end
   of the ripening (day 45) chemical composition (AOAC, 1990), total
   antioxidant capacity (ORAC(FL)), thiobarbituric reactive substances
   (TBARS), total phenolic content (TPC) (Folin-Ciocalteu method) and
   consumer tests were performed. The integration of oregano extract in pig
   diets did not interfere with the microbial evolution, chemical
   composition, pH and aw. After 20 days of ripening the OR salami were
   redder then CTRL samples, which were also yellower at the end of
   ripening. Furthermore, the diet has significantly improved the oxidative
   status, the polyphenolic content and antioxidant power in OR salami. The
   consumers gave a higher score to OR salami in informed condition.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ANIMAL RESEARCH},

Abstract = {The importance of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) within the
   biological functions of animals has been widely recognized. In this
   study, exercise and PUFAs' supplementation effects on serum
   triglycerides (Try), total cholesterol (Chol), and nonesterified fatty
   acids (NEFAs) concentration were evaluated in athletic horses. Ten
   regularly trained thoroughbred horses were randomly divided in two
   groups, control group (CG; n = 5) and experimental group (EG; n = 5). EG
   received a 4-week PUFA supplementation; CG received no dietary
   supplement. Blood samples were collected from the animals every 10 days
   before (PreD10, PreD20, PreD30) and after (PostD10, PostD20, PostD30)
   1700 metres of race and were tested for selected parameters. Two-way
   analysis of variance for repeated measures showed lower Chol levels at
   PreD10, PreD20, and PreD30 in EG with respect to control CG (P < .05).
   EG showed lower NEFA levels than CG at PreD20 and PostD30 (P < .05).
   Increase of Try levels was found in EG at PreD20 and PostD30 (P < .05).
   The results of this study highlighted both exercise and PUFA
   supplementation diet's effect on selected lipid parameters in
   thoroughbred horses. In addition PUFA supplementation diet seems to
   improve metabolic adaptation to physical exercise probably by increasing
   animal capacity for fatty acids' utilization in muscle.},

Title = {A novel variant of the infectious bronchitis virus resulting from
   recombination events in Italy and Spain},
Journal = {AVIAN PATHOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Pages = {28-35},
Abstract = {Infectious bronchitis is considered to be one of the most devastating
   diseases in poultry. Control of its spread is typically attempted
   through biosecurity measures and extensive vaccination. However, the
   remarkable genetic and antigenic variability of the virus, which
   originate from both mutations and recombination events, represents an
   unsolved challenge for this disease. The present study reports on the
   emergence and spread of recombinant clusters detected in Italy and Spain
   between 2012 and 2014. A total of 36 Spanish and Italian infectious
   bronchitis virus (IBV) field strains were investigated and genetically
   characterized using phylogenetic, molecular, recombination and selection
   pressure analyses of the complete S1 gene. Based on the partial S1
   sequencing, 27 IBV strains originating from Spain and nine from Italy
   were initially classified as being closely related to the
   Guandong/Xindadi (XDN) genotype. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete
   S1 gene revealed that the XDN strains formed a homogeneous clade with
   the Spanish IBV isolates within the QX genotype, whereas there was
   higher variability within the Italian strains. Recombination analysis
   determined that these strains belonged to four groups, which originated
   from independent recombination events between the QX and 793B IBV
   genotypes. Our data support the hypothesis of two different scenarios:
   firstly, in Spain, the large and homogeneous clade probably originated
   from a single offspring of the recombinant founder, which became
   dominant and spread throughout the country. Secondly, the nine Italian
   recombinants, which are characterized by three different recombination
   patterns, probably represent less fitted strains, because they were less
   viable with respect to their recombinant parents.},

   facility as a sanitizing measure against Aethina tumida},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {56},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Following the discovery of the small hive beetle (Aethina tumida) (SHB)
   in the Calabria region of Italy in 2014, and similar finds in the region
   in the following years, it seems appropriate to evaluate measures that
   could allow the movement of supers full of honey from SHB non-infested
   but at risk areas, to extraction and processing facilities located in
   SHB non-infested areas. Freezing is appropriate as a sanitary measure
   for hive products such as pollen, but honey has a low thermal
   conductivity, so long periods of time are necessary to freeze whole
   supers. Supers containing two different honey crops (chestnut and
   eucalyptus) were placed in a freezing facility to determine the optimum
   times for SHB control. We found that supers full of honey should be
   stored in a -20 degrees C freezer for at least 71 (chestnut honey) and
   83 (eucalyptus honey) hours respectively, to fulfil OIE recommendations
   for sanitization, but considering eucalyptus honey the worst scenario,
   we would recommend an 83-h-treatment generally.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of light microscopy with
   differential staining techniques for the discrimination of insect
   material from marine arthropods - classified as fishmeal. Specifically,
   three samples of single-species insect material, Hermetia illucens (HI),
   Bombyx mori (BM) and Tenebrio molitor (TM), and two samples of marine
   arthropods, shrimp material and krill, were analysed and compared after
   staining by two reagents to enhance fragment identification. Alizarin
   Red (AR) and Chlorazol Black (CB), which react respectively with calcium
   salts and chitin, were tested for their potential efficacy in
   distinguishing between insect and marine materials. Results indicated
   that AR failed to stain HI, BM and TM materials. By contrast, the three
   insect species materials tested were stained by CB. When shrimp
   fragments and krill were considered, AR and CB stained marine materials
   reddish-pink and light blue to black, respectively. By combining these
   results, it can be suggested that CB staining may efficiently be used to
   mark insect materials; AR does stain shrimp fragments but does not stain
   the tested insect material, indicating a possible approach for
   discriminating between insects and marine arthropods. However, since the
   present study was performed on pure materials and a small set of
   samples, possible implementation of this technique still needs to be
   confirmed in complex matrices such as compound feed.},

Title = {Historical Perspectives and Guidelines for Botulinum Neurotoxin Subtype
   Nomenclature},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Botulinum neurotoxins are diverse proteins. They are currently
   represented by at least seven serotypes and more than 40 subtypes. New
   clostridial strains that produce novel neurotoxin variants are being
   identified with increasing frequency, which presents challenges when
   organizing the nomenclature surrounding these neurotoxins. Worldwide,
   researchers are faced with the possibility that toxins having identical
   sequences may be given different designations or novel toxins having
   unique sequences may be given the same designations on publication. In
   order to minimize these problems, an ad hoc committee consisting of over
   20 researchers in the field of botulinum neurotoxin research was
   convened to discuss the clarification of the issues involved in
   botulinum neurotoxin nomenclature. This publication presents a
   historical overview of the issues and provides guidelines for botulinum
   neurotoxin subtype nomenclature in the future.},

Abstract = {In this study, the prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in poultry fresh
   meat and ready-to-cook products was evaluated. Seventy-three samples
   were collected at retail level from supermarkets and discount stores,
   obtaining 61.6\% positivity. Of 133 Campylobacter isolates, 86 strains
   (Campylobacter coli, 58.1\% and Campylobacter jejuni, 41.9\%) were
   selected for characterisation on the basis of their SmaI and kpnI pulsed
   field gel-electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles, to exclude clonal replicates.
   Campylobacters resulted highly resistant to tetracycline, ciprofloxacin,
   and nalidixic acid (79.1\%, 72.1\% and 65.1\%, respectively); 50\% of C.
   coli and 13.9\% of C. jejuni were resistant to ciprofloxacin and
   erythromycin, the most important antimicrobials for human
   campylobacteriosis therapy. Five C. coli were resistant to 5/7 of the
   tested antimicrobials. HS4c was the prevailing C. jejuni serotype group
   (22.3\%), whereas 8 other serotypes were identified in low percentages.
   SmaI and kpnI profiles showed a wide variability. The survey showed a
   high Campylobacter contamination of poultry meat and poultry products at
   retail level in Tuscany, Italy. A wide strains' heterogeneity and a
   remarkable level of strains' antimicrobial resistance have been
   reported, confirming the need for an improvement of specific preventive
   measures along the production chain.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF RISK RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {20},

Pages = {366-384},
Abstract = {The study aims to assess Italian consumers' attitudes towards food risks
   and seeks to outline their socio-demographic and behavioural
   characteristics on the basis of their attitudes (self-protective and
   non-self-protective) towards food risks. Using the Computer-assisted
   telephone interviewing survey method, a sample of 1000 Italian consumers
   was interviewed on risk perception issues and general eating habits.
   Factor analyses on the consumers' propensities to read the label when
   buying a food product for the first time, their propensities to seek
   food-related information and their perceived levels of exposure to food
   risks have enabled us to define Italian consumers' attitudes towards
   food risks. Distinguishing between consumers with more self-protective
   attitudes and those with less self-protective attitudes and identifying
   their distinctive socio-demographic and behavioural characteristics
   (e.g. gender, age, the frequency with which respondents do grocery
   shopping and the channels used for further inquiry) are crucial for
   communication campaigns aimed at reducing consumers' exposure to food
   risks.},

Title = {Optimization of the Extraction of the Volatile Fraction from Honey
   Samples by SPME-GC-MS, Experimental Design, and Multivariate Target
   Functions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {2017},
Abstract = {Head space (HS) solid phase microextraction (SPME) followed by gas
   chromatography with mass spectrometry detection (GC-MS) is the most
   widespread technique to study the volatile profile of honey samples. In
   this paper, the experimental SPME conditions were optimized by a
   multivariate strategy. Both sensitivity and repeatability were optimized
   by experimental design techniques considering three factors: extraction
   temperature (from 50 degrees C to 70 degrees C), time of exposition of
   the fiber (from 20 min to 60 min), and amount of salt added (from 0 to
   27.50\%). Each experiment was evaluated by Principal Component Analysis
   (PCA) that allows to take into consideration all the analytes at the
   same time, preserving the information about their different
   characteristics. Optimal extraction conditions were identified
   independently for signal intensity (extraction temperature: 70 degrees
   C; extraction time: 60 min; salt percentage: 27.50\% w/w) and
   repeatability (extraction temperature: 50 degrees C; extraction time: 60
   min; salt percentage: 27.50\% w/w) and a final global compromise
   (extraction temperature: 70 degrees C; extraction time: 60 min; salt
   percentage: 27.50\% w/w) was also reached. Considerations about the
   choice of the best internal standards were also drawn. The whole
   optimized procedure was than applied to the analysis of a multiflower
   honey sample and more than 100 compounds were identified.},

Abstract = {Species of Anoplocephalidae are cestodes affecting equines worldwide and
   causing many intestinal disorders. Between October 2010 and September
   2013, 284 faecal samples of horses originating from Lazio Region
   (Central Italy) were tested for the presence of Anoplocephala sp. eggs
   by a classic copromicroscopic technique. Data regarding
   pasture-dependence/non dependence, age, and sex of the horses were also
   collected. Statistical analysis, aimed at detecting possible
   associations between these variables and Anoplocephala sp. prevalence,
   was performed. Anoplocephala sp. eggs were found in 13.0\% of tested
   horses. Higher values of prevalence were recorded in females (15.2\%),
   younger animals (< 6 months old) (15.4\%), and animals dependent on
   pasture for their diet (18.58\%), the latter being the only
   statistically significant variable. Prevalence recorded in the present
   study is comparable to those reported in previous surveys based on
   coprological methods.},

Title = {The Potential Role of Direct and Indirect Contacts on Infection Spread
   in Dairy Farm Networks},
Journal = {PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Animals' exchanges are considered the most effective route of
   between-farm infectious disease transmission. However, despite being
   often overlooked, the infection spread due to contaminated equipment,
   vehicles, or personnel proved to be important for several livestock
   epidemics. This study investigated the role of indirect contacts in a
   potential infection spread in the dairy farm network of the Province of
   Parma (Northern Italy). We built between-farm contact networks using
   data on cattle exchange (direct contacts), and on-farm visits by
   veterinarians (indirect contacts). We compared the features of the
   contact structures by using measures on static and temporal networks. We
   assessed the disease spreading potential of the direct and indirect
   network structures in the farm system by using data on the infection
   state of farms by paratuberculosis. Direct and indirect networks showed
   non-trivial differences with respect to connectivity, contact
   distribution, and super-spreaders identification. Furthermore, our
   analyses on paratuberculosis data suggested that the contributions of
   direct and indirect contacts on diseases spread are apparent at
   different spatial scales. Our results highlighted the potential role of
   indirect contacts in between-farm disease spread and underlined the need
   for a deeper understanding of these contacts to develop better
   strategies for prevention of livestock epidemics.},

Abstract = {The occurrence of pesticides intended for non-agricultural use was
   investigated in 206 dust samples drawn from vacuum-cleaner bags from
   residential flats in Italy. The multi-residue analysis targeted on 95
   different active principles was performed with UPLC-MS/MS, with a Limit
   of Quantification (LOQ) of 0.008 mu g/g dry weight. The results
   indicated the presence of imidacloprid (IMI) and carbendazim (CARB) in
   30\% and 26\% of the samples, with a mean and P95 concentration between
   1.6 and 39 and between 0.08 and 4.9 mu g/g, respectively. Combined
   presence of two biocides was noted in 19.4\% samples, of three biocides
   in 9.2\% samples, of four biocides in 3.4\% samples, and of five and six
   biocides in 0.5\% and 1\% samples, respectively. According to the
   estimated dust intake in infants/toddlers aged 6-24 months (16-100 mg
   d(-1)) and cats (200 mg d(-1)), it was possible to obtain risk
   characterization with respect to the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for
   IMI of 0.060 mg/kg body weight (bw) proposed by the European Food Safety
   Authority (EFSA) and the chronic Population Adjusted Dose (cPAD) of
   0.019 mg/kg bw d(-1) by US-EPA. Under the worst-case scenario, the
   presence of IMI in dust indicates potential exceedance of the cPAD in
   kittens, to be considered as sentinel also accounting for combined
   exposure. This study highlights the relevance of consumer empowerment
   about the responsible use of pesticides as biocidal products in indoor
   environment.},

Abstract = {Enrofloxacin (E) is commonly used in veterinary medicine. It is
   necessary to perform pharmacokinetic/dynamic studies to minimize the
   selection of resistant mutants of bacteria and extend the efficacy of
   antimicrobial agents. Eight healthy adult Pogona vitticeps were assigned
   into two groups of equal size and treated with a single intramuscular
   injection of E at 10 mg/kg. Blood samples were withdrawn at different
   scheduled times for each group, and rectal swabs were collected. E and
   ciprofloxacin (active metabolite) blood concentrations were quantified
   by an HPLC validated method, while the in vitro antimicrobial
   susceptibility was evaluated by the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion
   susceptibility test. The pharmacokinetic profiles of E gave similar
   pharmacokinetic parameters irrespective of the collection time schedule.
   Bacteria isolation showed the presence of both E. coli, Salmonella
   enterica subspecies enterica and subspecies 3a, Proteus spp., and
   Pseudomonas spp. The majority of isolated colonies were sensitive to E,
   but the treatment did not reduce the number of bacteria in faeces.
   Results suggest that E is able to reach blood concentrations high enough
   to kill susceptible bacteria (MIC < 0.9 mu g/mL), but at the same time
   does not significantly affect intestinal bacteria.},

Abstract = {Brown hares have undergone a substantial population decline in Europe
   during recent decades, caused by, among other factors, the occurrence of
   European Brown Hare Syndrome (EBHS). To improve our knowledge regarding
   EBHS epidemiology, we developed a mathematical model that takes into
   consideration both brown hare biology and the infection dynamics of the
   EBHS virus (EBHSV). The model consists of eight ordinary differential
   equations simulating the spread of the virus in a closed hare
   population. Simulations showed that EBHSV's transmission has complex
   dynamics, which are strongly affected by the hare density. In
   particular, a density threshold of 7 individuals/km(2) was identified,
   determining two opposite epidemiological patterns: the extinction of the
   EBHSV below the threshold and its endemic stability when the hare
   population density is above the threshold, with a seroprevalence
   proportional to the population density. The model was validated using
   serological data collected in different areas in the province of Brescia
   (Northern Italy). The results suggested that the maintenance of the
   endemic circulating viral level through density control mechanisms is
   the best strategy for reducing EBHS's impact.},

   Stem Cells in a Minipig Model of Mandibular ``Critical Size{''} Defect},
Journal = {STEM CELLS INTERNATIONAL},

Abstract = {Introduction. Adding stem cells to biodegradable scaffolds to enhance
   bone regeneration is a valuable option. Different kinds of stem cells
   with osteoblastic activity were tested, such as bone marrow stromal stem
   cells (BMSSCs). Aim. To assess a correct protocol for osteogenic stem
   cell differentiation, so BMSSCs were seeded on a bone porcine block
   (BPB). Materials and Methods. Bone marrow from six minipigs was
   extracted from tibiae and humeri and treated to isolate BMSSCs. After
   seeding on BPB, critical-size defects were created on each mandible of
   the minipigs and implanted with BPB and BPB/BMSSCs. After three months,
   histomorphometric analysis was performed. Results. Histomorphometric
   analysis provided percentages of the three groups. Tissues present in
   control defects were 23 +/- 2\% lamellar bone, 28 +/- 1\% woven bone,
   and 56 +/- 4\% marrow spaces; in BPB defects were 20 +/- 5\% BPB, 32 +/-
   2\% lamellar bone, 24 +/- 1\% woven bone, and 28 +/- 2\% marrow spaces;
   in BPB/BMSSCs defects were 17 +/- 4\% BPB/BMSSCs, 42 +/- 2\% lamellar
   bone, 12 +/- 1\% woven bone, and 22 +/- 3\% marrow spaces. Conclusion.
   BPB used as a scaffold to induce bone regeneration may benefit from the
   addition of BDPSCs in the tissue-engineered constructs.},

Abstract = {The present research studied for the first time the potential
   application of the fat derived from the black soldier fly larvae fat
   (BSLF) in substitution to the soybean oil in the diet for broiler
   chickens: growth performances, feed-choice, blood traits, carcass
   characteristics and meat quality were considered in this study. A total
   of 150 male broiler chicks (Ross 308) at one-day of age were randomly
   allotted to 3 dietary treatments (5 replicates and 10 birds/pen): a
   basal control diet (C group), and the same diet in which the soybean oil
   was replaced by 50\% (CH group) or 100\% (H group) BSLF. Growth
   performances, feed-choice test, blood traits and slaughtering
   performances were not influenced by diets. Independently of BSLF
   inclusion, broiler chickens breast meat had also similar crude protein
   and ether extract contents and displayed similar thawing loss.
   Furthermore, pH, L{*}, a{*}, b{*} colour values, and drip loss were
   unaffected by dietary treatments both at 0 and 9 days of refrigerated
   storage. As expected, the fatty acid profile of broiler chickens breast
   was greatly affected by BSLF inclusion level. With increasing BSLF
   inclusion rate, the proportion of SFA increased (32.2, 37.8, 43.5\% for
   C, CH and H breast meat, respectively, p < . 001) to the detriment of
   the PUFA fraction (22.7, 23.0, 22.9\% for C, CH and H breast meat,
   respectively, p < . 001). On the contrary, MUFA fraction was unaffected.
   BSLF inclusion guaranteed satisfactory productive performances, carcass
   traits and overall meat quality, thus suggesting that BSLF could be a
   promising new feed ingredient for chickens.},

Title = {Evaluation of antibiotic usage in swine reproduction farms in Umbria
   region based on the quantitative analysis of antimicrobial consumption},
Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF FOOD SAFETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {6},

Pages = {112-119},
Abstract = {Antibiotic use in food-producing animals has considerable impact on
   public health, especially with respect to the development and spread of
   antibiotic resistance. Pigs represent one of the main species in which
   antibiotics are frequently used for different purposes. Surveillance of
   antibiotic consumption and dose appropriateness, through novel
   approaches based on defined daily doses, is strongly needed to assess
   farms' antibiotic risk, in terms of spread of antibiotic resistance and
   possibile presence of residues in meat. In this study, antibiotic
   consumption was monitored in 14 swine reproduction farms, together with
   managerial, structural, and health aspects. Most of the controlled farms
   (65\%) were classified as at medium antibiotic risk, 21\% at high
   antibiotic risk, and 14\% at low antibiotic risk. Critical aspects of
   antibiotic administration concerned treatments for suckling and weaner
   piglets, oral antibiotic administration, treatment and diagnosis of
   gastroenteric infections, and use of critically important antimicrobials
   for human medicine, especially colistin. These aspects could be
   considered critical aspects of antibiotic use in
   from-farrow-to-wean/finish swine farms in the Umbria region and must be
   controlled to minimize risks. Even though a small number of farms in
   Umbria region are at high antibiotic risk, the risk of antibiotic
   resistance should be minimized, and management and biosecurity of the
   farms should be improved by extending the use of antimicrobial
   susceptibility tests and optimizing the diagnostic methods for
   infectious diseases. Furthermore, farmers' and veterinarians' knowledge
   of antibiotic resistance should be improved and the prudent use of
   antibiotics encouraged to prevent the development and spread of
   resistant microorganisms.},

Title = {Evaluation of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification method for the

Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF FOOD SAFETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {6},

Pages = {179-184},
Abstract = {Objective of the present study was to test the performances of a
   loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)-based method for the
   detection of Listeria monocytogenes, with particular focus on the dairy
   products. The specificity of the method was evaluated on 42 different
   Listeria spp. strains from collections, food and environmental samples.
   100\% (32 of 32) of the L. monocytogenes strains were correctly
   recognised, and none of other 10 Listeria spp. strains was
   misidentified. The sensitivity was evaluated on four L. monocytogenes
   strains from different sources. The instrument was able to detect 10-400
   CFU/mL. The ability to detect low initial numbers of L. monocytogenes
   (0.3-0.7 Log CFU/g) was also evaluated, in duplicate, in pasteurised
   milk (whole and skimmed) and dairy samples (fresh ricotta, crescenza,
   mascarpone, mozzarella, cottage cheese, cream cheese, taleggio,
   gorgonzola). The analysis was performed after 18, 24 and 48 h of
   incubation, and was coupled with the count of L. monocytogenes in the
   broth. Microbial loads were insufficient to achieve a positive result
   after 18 and 24 h in most of the samples; after 48 h, all the products,
   except taleggio and one gorgonzola sample, were identified as positive;
   the sensitivity of the method when applied to contaminated dairy foods
   was about 5 Log CFU/g. The LAMP method tested can be considered a very
   useful tool, as it is a cost-effective and easy-functioning method. The
   preliminary data obtained should be confirmed with a validation process
   taking into account different food typologies.},

   (three spiked with RGNNV betanodavirus at different dilutions and three
   containing negative culture medium or fish serum) were provided to each

   relevant information were requested to the participants. Sixteen out of
   24 laboratories obtained the maximum score. The remaining 8 laboratories
   produced a percentage of correct results ranging between 66.67 and
   83.33\%. The average percentage of correct results was 90.28\%, while
   the average overall agreement was 0.6746. In general, the Real time

Abstract = {The European Commission (EC) regulation no. 854/2004 requires a
   systematic monitoring of chemical and microbiological contaminants in
   live bivalve molluscs, live echinoderms, live tunicates and live marine
   gastropods for human consumption through surveillance plans to be
   implemented in all European Union (EU) countries. A consortium of five
   Adriatic countries was set up in the framework of the Instrument of
   Pre-accession Assistance Adriatic Cross-border Cooperation Programme
   (IPA Adriatic CBC) 2007-2013 with the aim of collecting data and
   distribute information on harvesting and production in mollusc areas. A
   web-based geographical information system (GIS) application was
   developed to support the partners to manage data and to make these data
   available to final users, policy makers and to risk assessors. The GIS
   for the Strengthening of Centres for Aquaculture Production and Safety
   surveillance in the Adriatic countries (CAPS2) is divided into two
   levels, the national and the supranational one, and it distributes
   spatial and epidemiological information coming from various data
   acquisition and management sites. The great innovation is the
   possibility for each country to use online drawing, modifying and change
   of the geographic areas according to national surveillance needs.
   Currently it hosts data coming from about 230 production and relay areas
   with more than 29,478 laboratory tests performed on collected samples
   since August 2014. Data collected are used by each national competent
   authority to classify production or relay areas according to the EC
   regulation mentioned and to conduct risk assessment studies to evaluate
   the level of consumers' exposure to contaminants in the consumption of
   bivalve mollusc products.},

Abstract = {1. An experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of crude
   protein (CP) concentration and dietary electrolyte balance (DEB) on
   growth performance, processing yields, litter quality and foot pad
   dermatitis (FPD) in male turkeys from two commercial hybrids. Soya bean
   meal was replaced by vegetable protein sources selected for lower K
   concentrations to lower DEB in order to improve litter quality and
   subsequent quality of foot pads.2. Effects of CP on litter friability
   and wetness were not consistent during the production period. FPD in
   turkeys fed on diets with low CP was significantly lower than FPD in
   turkeys fed on diets with high CP until 84d. Growth performance was
   adversely affected at low CP. Processing yields were not affected by
   CP.3. Litter was significantly dryer in pens of turkeys fed on diets
   with low DEB than in pens of turkeys fed on diets with high DEB. FPD in
   turkeys fed on diets with low DEB was significantly lower than in
   turkeys fed on diets with high DEB. Growth performance and processing
   yields were adversely affected at low DEB.4. FPD in turkey hybrid A was
   higher than in turkey hybrid B at 28d of age. Thereafter, no differences
   in FPD between turkey hybrids were observed. Growth performance and
   processing yields were not affected by turkey hybrid.5. Overall, a
   significant interaction effect of CP x DEB was observed for FCR: in
   turkeys fed on the high DEB treatment, FCR of turkeys fed on the high CP
   diets was lower than FCR of turkeys fed on the low CP (LCP) diets
   whereas on the low DEB treatment, FCR was not affected by CP
   treatment.6. It was concluded that litter quality can be improved and
   FPD may be decreased in turkeys fed on diets containing lower CP and DEB
   levels.},

Title = {Differential Infection Patterns and Recent Evolutionary Origins of
   Equine Hepaciviruses in Donkeys},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY},

Abstract = {The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major human pathogen. Genetically
   related viruses in animals suggest a zoonotic origin of HCV. The closest
   relative of HCV is found in horses (termed equine hepacivirus {[}EqHV]).
   However, low EqHV genetic diversity implies relatively recent
   acquisition of EqHV by horses, making a derivation of HCV from EqHV
   unlikely. To unravel the EqHV evolutionary history within equid sister
   species, we analyzed 829 donkeys and 53 mules sampled in nine European,
   Asian, African, and American countries by molecular and serologic tools
   for EqHV infection. Antibodies were found in 278 animals (31.5\%), and
   viral RNA was found in 3 animals (0.3\%), all of which were
   simultaneously seropositive. A low RNA prevalence in spite of high
   seroprevalence suggests a predominance of acute infection, a possible
   difference from the mostly chronic hepacivirus infection pattern seen in
   horses and humans. Limitation of transmission due to short courses of
   infection may explain the existence of entirely seronegative groups of
   animals. Donkey and horse EqHV strains were paraphyletic and 97.5 to
   98.2\% identical in their translated polyprotein sequences, making
   virus/host cospeciation unlikely. Evolutionary reconstructions supported
   host switches of EqHV between horses and donkeys without the involvement
   of adaptive evolution. Global admixture of donkey and horse
   hepaciviruses was compatible with anthropogenic alterations of EqHV
   ecology. In summary, our findings do not support EqHV as the origin of
   the significantly more diversified HCV. Identification of a host system
   with predominantlyacute hepacivirus infection may enable new insights
   into the chronic infection pattern associated with HCV.
   IMPORTANCE The evolutionary origins of the human hepatitis C virus (HCV)
   are unclear. The closest animal-associated relative of HCV occurs in
   horses (equine hepacivirus {[}EqHV]). The low EqHV genetic diversity
   implies a relatively recent acquisition of EqHV by horses, limiting the
   time span for potential horse-to-human infections in the past. Horses
   are genetically related to donkeys, and EqHV may have cospeciated with
   these host species. Here, we investigated a large panel of donkeys from
   various countries using serologic and molecular tools. We found EqHV to
   be globally widespread in donkeys and identify potential differences in
   EqHV infection patterns, with donkeys potentially showing enhanced EqHV
   clearance compared to horses. We provide strong evidence against EqHV
   cospeciation and for its capability to switch hosts among equines.
   Differential hepacivirus infection patterns in horses and donkeys may
   enable new insights into the chronic infection pattern associated with
   HCV.},

Abstract = {We investigated the immunohistochemical expression of progesterone
   receptors (PRs) in the prostate and bulbourethral glands of thirty-two
   10-14-mo-old Charolais bulls following treatment with a low dosage of
   estrogens. Animals were divided into 2 groups: 16 animals (group T) were
   treated for 71 d with a therapeutic dose of trenbolone acetate and
   estradiol by subcutaneous implant, 16 animals (group C) received no
   treatment. Urine samples were collected both at the beginning of the
   trial and 9 times during the study. A semiquantitative analysis of
   immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed by counting the number of
   positive cells in 10 randomly selected high-power fields (hpf). Both
   groups showed no significant histologic lesions. IHC examination showed
   positive cells in the epithelium of both glands, with different patterns
   of distribution between groups. In group C, IHC-positive cells per hpf
   varied from 0 to 40 in the prostate and from 0 to 32 in the
   bulbourethral gland. In group T, positive cells varied from 0 to 85 per
   hpf in the prostate and from 0 to 75 in the bulbourethral gland. The
   treated group showed significantly higher median numbers of positively
   stained cells in both organs than the controls (p < 0.001). Chemical
   analysis of the urine samples confirmed that the experimental treatment
   mimics continuous, low-dose administration of anabolic steroids. IHC
   quantification showed good sensitivity with a high predictive power to
   correctly classify treated animals and could be used as a preliminary
   screening test in bulls.},

Abstract = {The bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) envelope protein (Env) is synthesized
   as a polyprotein precursor (gp72) proteolytically cleaved into the
   mature surface (SU) and transmembrane (TM) glycoproteins. The amino
   terminal region of SU contains conformational epitopes F, G and H, which
   require a glycosylated SU to be recognized by monoclonal antibodies
   (MAbs) and antibodies from BLV-infected cattle. The SU contains eight
   asparagine (N) residues that are putative N-glycosylation sites. The
   N129, N203, N230 and N251 appear involved in carbohydrate binding, play
   an essential role in the in vitro infection. To determine which sites
   were actually glycosylated, we generated mutated SU forms, where each
   N-glycosylation site was changed to alanine (A). Subsequently, these N
   to A mutations were inserted into the env gene to generate Env mutants.
   The increase of electrophoretic mobility of EnvA256 and EnvA271 derived
   SU showed that the asparagine residues N256 and N271 were also
   glycosylated. ELISA revealed that only the N129 oligosaccharide
   determined the antigenic conformation of SU. The syncytium formation
   induced by EnvA129 showed that fusogenic capacity was independent of
   amino-terminal SU glycan conformational structure. Finally, anti-BLV
   serum inhibited syncytia formation even with the EnvA129 mutant. The
   latter inhibition was higher than Env, suggesting that the
   oligosaccharides could be also involved in the glycan shield for viral
   escape. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has caused extensive economic
   losses to pig producers in many countries. It was recently introduced,
   for the first time, into North America and outbreaks have occurred again
   in multiple countries within Europe as well. To assess the properties of
   various diagnostic assays for the detection of PEDV infection, multiple
   panels of porcine sera have been shared and tested for the presence of
   antibodies against PEDV in an inter-laboratory ring trial. Different
   laboratories have used a variety of ``in house{''} ELISAs and also one
   commercial assay. The sensitivity and specificity of each assay has been
   estimated using a Bayesian analysis applied to the ring trial results
   obtained with the different assays in the absence of a gold standard.
   Although different characteristics were found, it can be concluded that
   each of the assays used can detect infection of pigs at a herd level by
   either the early European strains of PEDV or the recently circulating
   strains (INDEL and non-INDEL). However, not all the assays seem suitable
   for demonstrating freedom from disease in a country. The results from
   individual animals, especially when the infection has occurred within an
   experimental situation, show more variation. (C) 2016 Published by

Title = {Prognostic and Predictive Factors in Patients with Advanced Penile
   Cancer Receiving Salvage (2nd or Later Line) Systemic Treatment: A
   Retrospective, Multi-Center Study},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {Introduction and objectives: Metastatic penile squamous cell carcinoma
   (PSCC) is associated with dismal outcomes with median overall survival
   (OS) of 6-12 months in the first-line and,6 months in the salvage
   setting. Given the rarity of this disease, randomized trials are
   difficult. Prognostic risk models may assist in rational drug
   development by comparing observed outcomes in nonrandomized phase II
   studies and retrospective data vs. predicted outcomes based on baseline
   prognostic factors in the context of historically used agents. In this
   retrospective study, we constructed a prognostic model in the salvage
   setting of PSCC patients receiving second or later line systemic
   treatment, and also explored differences in outcomes based on type of
   treatment.
   Materials and methods : We performed a chart review to identify patients
   with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic PSCC who received
   second or later line systemic treatment in centers from North America
   and Europe. The primary outcome was OS from initiation of treatment,
   with secondary outcomes being progression-free survival (PFS) and
   response rate (RR). OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox
   proportional hazards regression was used to identify prognostic factors
   for outcomes using univariable and multivariable models.
   Results: Sixty-five patients were eligible. Seventeen of 63 evaluable
   patients had a response (27.0\%, 95\% confidence interval {[}Cl] =
   16.6-39.7\%) and median OS and PFS were 20 (95\% Cl = 20-21) and 12
   (95\% Cl = 12, 16) weeks, respectively. Visceral metastasis (VM) and
   hemoglobin (Hb) <= 10 gm/dl were consistently significant poor
   prognostic factors for both OS and PFS, and Hb was also prognostic for
   response. The 28 patients with neither risk factor had a median OS (95\%
   CI) of 24 (20-40) weeks and 1-year (95\% CI) OS of 13.7\% (4.4-42.7\%),
   while the 37 patients with 1 or 2 risk factors had median OS (95\% CI)
   of 20 (16-20) weeks and 1-year (95\% CI) OS of 6.7\% (1.8-24.9\%).
   Cetuximab-including regimens were associated with a trend for improved
   RR compared to other agents (Odds ratio = 5.05, 95\% CI = 0.84-30.37, p
   = 0.077). Taxanes vs. non-taxane, and combination vs. single agent
   therapy was not associated with improved outcomes. The study is limited
   by its modest sample size.
   Conclusion: This is the first prognostic classification proposed for
   patients receiving salvage systemic therapy for advanced PSCC. The
   presence of VM and Hb <= 10 gm/dl was associated with poor OS and PFS.
   Cetuximab appeared to be associated with better RR. This prognostic
   model may assist in salvage therapy drug development for this orphan
   disease by improving interpretation of outcomes seen in nonrandomized
   data.},

Title = {Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Shedding and Antibody Response in Swine
   Farms: A Longitudinal Study},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes an acute and highly
   contagious enteric disease characterized by severe enteritis, vomiting,
   watery diarrhea, and a high mortality rate in seronegative neonatal
   piglets. In the last few years. PED had a large economic impact on the
   swine industries in Asia and the US, and in 2014, the PEDV also
   re-emerged in Europe. Two main PEDV variants circulate worldwide but
   only the S INDEL variant, considered a mild strain, is spreading in
   Europe. To gain insights into the pathogenicity of this variant, its
   viral load and temporal shedding pattern were evaluated in piglets from
   infected farms. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) targeting the spike
   gene, was validated according to the minimum information for
   quantitative real-time PCR experiments guidelines. The qPCR was applied
   to longitudinal studies conducted in four swine farms naturally infected
   with the PEDV S INDEL variant. Clinical data, fecal swabs, and blood
   samples were collected from 103 piglets at 15-30-day intervals for 2-5
   months. On all four farms, diarrhea was observed in sows during
   gestation and in farrowing units, and the mortality rates of piglets
   were 18, 25, 30, and 35\%. Different clinical pictures (0-50\% of
   diarrhea positivity), viral titer levels (mean 5.3-7.2 log(10) genome
   copies/mL), and antibody conditions (30-80\% of positivity) were
   registered among sows on the four farms. The percentage of qPCR positive
   piglets varied greatly from the beginning (63-100\%) to the end (0\%) of
   the infection course. Clinical signs were present in 96\% of the qPCR
   positive animals. Viral loads ranged from 8.5 log(10) to 4 log(10)
   genome copies/mL in suckling pigs at 3-6 days of age and were not
   statistically different among farms, despite the different patterns
   observed in sows. After 2-3 weeks, only a few piglets still showed
   detectable viral levels and clinical signs, and they developed antibody
   responses. Moreover, co-infections with other pathogens and biosecurity
   procedures limiting the circulation of the virus could have influenced
   the severity of PED infection. QPCR and clinical data were useful in
   understanding the dynamics of PEDV infections and, therefore, in
   implementing appropriate control measures.},

Title = {Dystrophic mineralization of the arterial fibrovascular tissue
   associated with a vitamin D hypervitaminosis in an 8-year-old female
   Alpaca (Vicugna pacos)},
Journal = {IRISH VETERINARY JOURNAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {69},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Background: Prophylactic Vitamin D supplementation is a common practice
   in Alpaca breeding in many regions around the world. An overdosage can
   lead to dystrophic mineralization of soft tissues. In this paper we
   illustrate a suspected case of hypervitaminosis D in an 8-year-old
   female Alpaca.
   Case presentation: In June 2015, the carcass of an 8-year-old female
   Alpaca (Vicugna pacos) was submitted to the diagnostic laboratory of the
   Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie (IZSVe) for
   necropsy. The animal had undergone a spontaneous abortion with uterine
   prolapse and delivery of the placenta, and had died shortly thereafter.
   Death occurred due to internal haemorrhage related to dystrophic
   mineralization of the left renal artery with subsequent rupture and
   damage of the renal hilum. During the necropsy, histopathological and
   serum biochemical analyses were performed. After laboratory analyses and
   the history of mineral and vitamin supplementation reported by the
   breeder, a hypervitaminosis D was suspected to be the most probable
   cause of the dystrophic mineralization observed in the left renal
   artery.
   Conclusions: Most of the information regarding Llamas and Alpacas comes
   from the South American and Australian regions. It is therefore
   important to provide scientific information about these animals in other
   regions of the world in order to have a better and wider understanding
   of the nutritional and environmental conditions necessary for optimal
   breeding.},

Abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is a major agent of bovine mastitis in dairy
   herds, causing economic losses in dairy industry worldwide. In addition,
   milk and milk-products contaminated by Staph.aureus can cause harmful
   human diseases. The aim of this study was to characterize Staph.aureus
   strains isolated from dairy farms in Tunisia. Bulk tank milk (n=32) and
   individual cow milk (n=130) samples were collected during the period of
   2013-2014. Forty-three Staph.aureus isolates were recovered and typed by
   spa typing, 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer (RS-PCR) and multiplex PCRs
   for 22 virulence genes. Antimicrobial resistance was also investigated
   with a disc diffusion test. A selected subsample of 22 strains was
   additionally genotyped by multilocus sequence typing. Seventeen spa
   types were recovered, and t2421 (n=10), t521 (n=6) and t2112 (n=5) were
   the most common. Fourteen different RS-PCR genotypes grouped into 11
   clusters were detected in our study, with predominance of the R-VI
   genotype (n=24). Eight sequence types were identified and Clonal Complex
   97, corresponding to RS-PCR cluster R, was the most common (n=10),
   followed by CC1 (n=4), CC15 (n=3) and other four accounting for one or
   two strains. Different combinations of virulence genes were reported,
   and enterotoxin genes were present in few strains (seh, n=4; sea, n=2;
   sea and seh, n=2; sec and sel, n=2). The majority of strains were
   resistant only to penicillin; only one strain was found to be
   multiresistant and no methicillin-resistant Staph.aureus was
   demonstrated. Our study reported the isolation of CC97 from bovine milk
   in Tunisia for the first time and confirmed the relevance of this
   lineage in intramammary infection in cows.},

Title = {Effects of dietary Tenebrio molitor meal inclusion in free-range

Abstract = {Insects are currently being considered as a novel protein source for
   animal feeds, because they contain a large amount of protein. The larvae
   of Tenebrio molitor (TM) have been shown to be an acceptable protein
   source for broiler chickens in terms of growth performance, but till
   now, no data on histological or intestinal morphometric features have
   been reported. This study has had the aim of evaluating the effects of
   dietary TM inclusion on the performance, welfare, intestinal morphology
   and histological features of free-range chickens. A total of 140
   medium-growing hybrid female chickens were free-range reared and
   randomly allotted to two dietary treatments: (i) a control group and
   (ii) a TM group, in which TM meal was included at 75g/kg. Each group
   consisted of five pens as replicates, with 14 chicks per pen. Growth
   performance, haematological and serum parameters and welfare indicators
   were evaluated, and the animals were slaughtered at the age of 97days.
   Two birds per pen (10 birds/treatment) were submitted to histological
   (liver, spleen, thymus, bursa of Fabricius, kidney, heart, glandular
   stomach and gut) and morphometric (duodenum, jejunum and ileum)
   investigations. The inclusion of TM did not affect the growth
   performance, haematological or serum parameters. The morphometric and
   histological features were not significantly affected either, thus
   suggesting no influence on nutrient metabolization, performance or
   animal health. Glandular stomach alterations (chronic flogosis with
   epithelial squamous metaplasia) were considered paraphysiological in
   relation to free-range farming. The observed chronic intestinal
   flogosis, with concomitant activation of the lymphoid tissue, was
   probably due to previous parasitic infections, which are very frequently
   detected in free-range chickens. In conclusion, the findings of this
   study show that yellow mealworm inclusion does not affect the welfare,
   productive performances or morphological features of free-range
   chickens, thus confirming that TM can be used safely in poultry diets.},

Abstract = {Crops intended for human nutrition and food production containing
   different essential trace elements, such as copper and zinc, could be
   contaminated by toxic metals like cadmium and lead. The
   interrelationship between micronutrients and contaminant trace elements
   in different cereals was investigated in North-western Italy, where both
   agricultural and industrial activities are present. Elemental
   concentrations in sampled cereals were assessed by inductively coupled
   plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Rice, oats and barley reached the
   highest median levels for Al, Cd and Pb content, while corn samples were
   less contaminated by toxic metals. Regarding essential elements highest
   median values of Cu and Zn were both found in barley, while Ni median
   content was higher in oats. Rice had the lowest median levels of
   essential elements. The correlation study between toxic and essential
   elements seemed to demonstrate fixed trends in analysed samples,
   corroborating the importance of a different diet to limit potential
   adverse effects caused by toxic elements.},

Abstract = {The Culex pipiens complex includes species with reported differences in
   vector competence for arthropod-borne viruses, many of which are of
   significant importance to human health such as the West Nile virus and
   the Sindbis virus. This group of mosquitoes is difficult to distinguish
   morphologically; particularly as adult females. In Europe, the two
   species of the complex, Culex pipiensLinnaeus 1758 and Culex
   torrentiumMartini 1925, are often found sympatrically. With the aim to
   characterize the presence and spread of both species in the
   Emilia-Romagna region, Northern Italy, mosquitoes of the
   complex-collected during the West Nile virus surveillance plans-were
   tested by multiplex real-time PCR for the detection of the two species
   Cx. pipiens and Cx. torrentium. A total of 24165 mosquitoes, collected
   between 2012 and 2014 from 105 sites, and sorted in 204 pools, were
   tested. All tested pools were found to be composed of Cx. pipiens,
   whereas Cx. torrentium was not detected. These results indicate a likely
   absence of Cx. torrentium mosquitoes within the surveyed territory,
   whereas Cx. pipiens is widely distributed in the area mentioned. This is
   in line with previous reports, which describe a pre-alpine distribution
   of Cx. torrentium in Italy.},

Abstract = {Background: Both Bovine herpesvirus (BoHV-1) and Bubaline herpesvirus
   (BuHV-1) have been reported to cross the species barrier. Antibody
   seroconversion in glycoprotein E (gE) blocking ELISA during BuHV-1
   infection has been documented. Recent diagnostic efforts have focused on
   the development and application of discriminatory tests to distinguish
   between infections with BoHV-1 and BuHV-1.Objective: To evaluate the
   impact and distribution of these two infections in water buffalo farms
   in two regions (Piedmont (n = 3) and Campania (n = 10), Italy) where
   infectious bovine rhinotracheitis control programs have been
   implemented.Animals and methods: Sampling was carried out on 13 buffalo
   farms comprising 1089 animals using specific gE-indirect ELISA's test
   able to discriminate among BoHV-1 and BuHV-1 infections.Results: 59.0\%
   of animals reacted positive to ELISA (irrespective of whether BoHV-1 or
   BuHV-1 antigen was used) and 86.4\% of these were reactive to BuHV-1
   only, whereas 11.8\% showed absorbance values for both antigens and were
   classified as inconclusive. There was a statistically significant
   age-related difference in BuHV-1 infection rates but not in overall
   individual (47\% vs. 58\%) or herd prevalence (100\% vs. 90\%) of
   infection between the two regions.Conclusion: The low percentage of sera
   reactive to BoHV-1 (1.8\%, 12/643) indicates that BuHV-1 may be the main
   circulating alphaherpesvirus infection in Mediterranean water buffalo in
   the two study areas. Since Bubalus bubalis is included in Directive
   64/432/EEC on animal health problems affecting intra-community trade in
   bovine animals, diagnostic testing with nonspecific ELISA for BoHV-1
   infection in buffalo may yield false-positive reactions. This scenario
   could lead to economic losses and hamper buffalo trade and movement,
   particularly for reproduction purposes.},

Abstract = {Carnivores are potential carriers of agents that infect their prey
   species, even though they themselves are not susceptible, such as the
   lagovirus that causes European brown hare syndrome (EBHS), a severe
   disease of brown hares endemic in Europe. During our wildlife
   surveillance in Lombardy, we identified an EBHS outbreak in a protected
   area by both virological analyses (sandwich ELISA and RT-PCR) of the
   target organs from one dead hare and serological examinations
   (competitive ELISA) of captured animals. Since four red foxes were
   contemporarily hunted in the same area, we examined their organs by
   RT-PCR for the EBHS agent (EBHSv). The intestinal content of one fox
   tested positive, while the fox' other organs (liver, spleen, and
   mesenteric lymph nodes), and all of the samples from the remaining three
   foxes, tested negative. Moreover, in the gastrointestinal content of the
   positive fox, we found food debris that was genetically identified as
   being of hare origin. The competitive ELISA test for EBHSv antibodies
   gave negative results in all of the fox sera. Genetic analyses of the
   EBHSv amplicons obtained by RT-PCR in the hare and the fox indicated a
   full homology (99.9 \% nucleotide and 100 \% amino acid identity). These
   results support the fact that red fox, as other predators, feeding on
   EBHSv infected hares may have genetic prints of the virus in their gut
   contents. Even if we did not prove that lagovirus particles remained
   infective in the excreted feces and, thus, contaminated the ground in
   the outbreak area, these eventualities cannot be excluded, and we could
   at least conclude that red foxes might assume a potential role in the
   indirect transmission of lagovirus, as EBHSv.},

Abstract = {In this study, 1029 fish and cephalopod samples came from
   Central-Western Mediterranean (FAO 37.1.1 and FAO 37.13) were analysed
   for Anisakidae larvae research with the aim to identify possible
   hybridisations between Anisakis pegreffii and Anisakis simplex s.s.
   species. A total of 1765 larvae were detected, with prevalence values
   between 8.1\% and 100\%. The morphologic analysis revealed characters
   attributable to morphotype I of Anisakis in 98.5\% of the examined
   larvae, while 1.5\% belonged to the morphotype II. PCR-based Restriction
   Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis of the entire ITS
   region (ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2) of nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) was
   performed with HinfI and Hhal restriction enzymes. The majority of the
   larvae examined by PCR-RFLP were identified as A. pegreffii (71\%), with
   a prevalence on horse mackerel from FAO 37.1.3, while 10\% were
   identified as A. simplex s.s., 2\% as A. physeteris and 17\% as A.
   pegreffii x A. simplex s.s. hybrid genotype. The sequence analysis
   confirmed the hybridisation in the 85\% of the larvae recognised as
   hybrid forms by PCR-RFLP, suggesting this form as the product of natural
   interspecific recombination due to the presence of sympatry areas. The
   presence of hybrid forms were mostly found in fish samples from FAO
   subzone 37.1.1. This is the first report of A. pegreffii x A. simplex
   s.s. hybrid genotype in fishes caught off the coasts of Sicily (Southern
   Italy). Finally, this study provided substantial information about the
   geographical distribution of Anisakidae family in Central-Western
   Mediterranean Sea. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In July 2011, in a zoological garden in Rome, Italy, malignant catarrhal
   fever (MCF), a fatal, systemic disease of Artiodactyla, was suspected on
   the basis of neurological signs and gross lesions observed in a banteng,
   the first animal to die of this infection. An MCF type-specific PCR with
   subsequent sequencing of the PCR amplicon confirmed the aetiological
   agent as ovine herpesvirus-2 (OvHV-2). Biological samples were collected
   from the dead animals for gross, histological, bacteriological,
   virological and serological examinations. An epidemiological
   investigation was conducted to identify the source of the outbreak, as
   further deaths due to OvHV-2 still occurred after the removal of the
   acknowledged reservoirs, domestic sheep and goats. For this purpose,
   samples from other susceptible species and reservoir hosts were
   collected for virological and serological analysis. In conjunction, a
   retrospective sero-investigation was conducted on sera collected between
   1999 and 2010 from some of the species involved in the present episode.
   In total, 11 animals belonging to four different species (banteng,
   Himalayan tahr, Nile lechwe and sika deer) died between July 2011 and
   October 2012. The severe gross and histological lesions were consistent
   with the disease, namely haemorrhages and congestion of several organs
   as well as lymphoid cell infiltrates and vasculitis of varying severity.
   The virological tests confirmed that all animals had died of
   sheep-associated MCF. The investigation indicated that the OvHV-2
   infection could have been due to the arrival of sheep in the petting
   zoo, with cases commencing after first lambing and subsequent shedding
   of virus. This was also supported by the serological retrospective study
   that indicated limited previous MCF virus circulation. Further MCF cases
   that occurred even after the removal of the domestic sheep and goats
   were attributed to the mouflon. This episode confirms the importance of
   biosecurity measures in zoos, which house MCF susceptible species,
   especially those endangered.},

Abstract = {Toxoplasmosis is one of the most prevalent parasitic infections of
   medical and veterinary importance. A cross-sectional study was conducted
   from November 2013 to January 2014 to estimate the seroprevalence of
   Toxoplasma gondii infection in camels from four districts of Borana
   zone, Southern Oromia, Ethiopia. In addition, a questionnaire survey was
   administered to 124 pastoralists to identify possible risk factors and
   to assess the awareness level of pastoral communities about
   toxoplasmosis. A total of 396 serum samples were examined for
   anti-Toxoplasma IgG antibodies using the direct agglutination test
   (DAT). Fisher's exact test and logistic regression were used for data
   analysis. An overall seroprevalence of 8.33 \% (95 \% confidence
   interval {[}CI] 5.60 \%, 11.07 \%) at animal-level and 37.5 \% (95 \%
   CI: 20.1 \%, 57.4 \%) at herd-level was found. The seroprevalence was
   significantly high in Moyale district (23.07 \%) followed by Yabello
   (7.20 \%), Dirre (3.77 \%), and Arero (0.0 \%) districts (P < 0.001).
   Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that the likelihood
   of acquiring T. gondii infection was significantly higher in camels of
   Moyale district (adjusted OR = 5.89, 95 \% CI 2.15, 16.12; P = 0.001)
   than Dirre district, in camels of > 8 years old (adjusted odds ratio
   {[}OR] = 4.95, 95 \% CI 1.68, 14.55; P = 0.004) than camels of
   ae<currency>4 years old. There was no significant association between
   herd-level seroprevalence of T. gondii infection and abortion history,
   herd size, and presence of domestic cats and wild felids (P > 0.05). The
   majority of interviewees were uneducated (82.25 \%), and all had no
   knowledge of toxoplasmosis. All camel herders drink raw camel milk but
   consume cooked meat (90.32 \%). Of the interviewees, 93.06 \% are aware
   about soil-eating habit of camels and provide salt supplement for their
   camels. Majority of the respondents practice improper disposal of
   aborted materials (throw along the way) (88.70 \%), and 73 \% of the
   study participants do not wash their hands after handling aborted fetus.
   The results of the present study confirm relatively lower prevalence of
   T. gondii infection in camels reared in Borana zone. Age and study
   district are significant predictors of T. gondii seropositivity. The
   vast majorities of interviewed pastoralists were uneducated and practice
   poor biosecurity measures to prevent diseases. Education of pastoralists
   about biosecurity measures to prevent toxoplasmosis and further studies
   are warranted to unravel the economic and public health consequences of
   T. gondii infection.},

Abstract = {Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has caused economic losses in the
   Americas, Asia and Europe in recent years. Reliable serological assays
   are essential for epidemiological studies and vaccine evaluation. The
   objective of this study was to compare the ability of five enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to detect antibodies against different
   PEDV strains in pig serum. A total of 732 serum samples from North
   American or European pigs were tested. Samples included experimental
   samples from pigs infected with classical (G1a PEDV) or variant
   genogroup 1 PEDV (Gib PEDV), pandemic genogroup 2 PEDV (G2b PEDV) or
   non-infected controls. Field samples from herds with confirmed or
   unknown PEDV exposure were also used. Three indirect ELISAs based on G2b
   antigens (ELISAs 1, 2 and 3), a competitive ELISA based on the G2b
   antigen (ELISA 4) and a competitive ELISA based on the G1a antigen
   (ELISA 5) were compared. Overall, the tests had a moderate agreement
   (kappa = 0.61). G1a PEDV infected pigs were earliest detected by ELISA
   3, G1b PEDV infected pigs were earliest detected by ELISAs 4 and 5 and
   the performance of all tests was similar for the G2b PEDV group. ELISA 1
   showed the overall lowest detection on experimentally and field derived
   samples. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity with a 95\% probability
   interval were estimated to be 68.2\% (62.1-74.4\%) and 97.5\%
   (95.2-99.0\%) for ELISA 1, 73.7\%(71.5-79.6\%) and 98.4\% (96.6-99.5\%)
   for ELISA 2, 86.2\% (81.1-90.6\%) and 91.6\% (87.7-94.8\%) for ELISA 3,
   78.3\% (72.8-83.5\%) and 99.7\% (98.2-100\%) for ELISA 4, and 93.5\%
   (90.3-96.0\%) and 91.2\% (83.8-97.9\%) for ELISA 5. Differences in
   detection among assays seem to be more related to intrinsic factors of

Title = {Pain alleviation during castration of piglets: a comparative study of

Abstract = {Pain alleviation associated with castration of piglets is an important
   welfare issue. The present study compares the effect of different
   approaches and products suitable for farmer use, with the aim to
   alleviate pain due to castration in piglets. A randomized within-litter
   design, with 28 replicate litters, compared 7 treatments: handling (H)
   restraint of the piglet and manipulation of the scrotum, castration
   without pain relief (C), 2 treatments (T2, T6) with different
   concentrations of tetracaine (2 and 6\%) applied topically 10 min before
   and immediately post-surgery, and 3 treatments with i. m. injection of
   different nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) 10 min prior to
   surgery (M-meloxicam, K-ketoprofen, TA-tolfenamic acid). Efficacy of
   pain relief was assessed during a 300 min period after castration by
   serum cortisol, behavior (walking, lying, suckling, in the nest,
   isolated and pain related: tremors, rubbing the rear, hunching, wagging
   of the tail), facial expression and scrotal skin pressure sensitivity. C
   pigs had greater serum cortisol concentration than all other groups at
   60 min post-surgery (P < 0.001), while H pigs had lower concentrations
   than pigs given topical anesthesia (P < 0.001) though not injected
   analgesia. No treatment differences were significant at 180 min, but at
   300 min cortisol concentration was greater in T2 and T6 piglets than
   those given NSAIDs (P = 0.03). These treatment differences were mirrored
   by the pressure sensitivity of the scrotum; in comparison with C
   piglets, those given NSAIDs showed a reduced sensitivity (P = 0.003) but
   those given local anesthesia did not (P = 0.15). C pigs showed increased
   frequency of pain-related behavior in the first 30 min in comparison
   with all other treatments, more time isolated than H or NSAID
   treatments, and more time standing inactive than H or K treatments. No
   behavioral differences were apparent after 60 min. No differences in
   facial expressions were observed among treatments. In conclusion,
   on-farm methods for pain relief can provide some, though not complete,
   pain alleviation in the hours after castration. The use of topical
   anesthesia gave only minor benefit in comparison to NSAID agents
   injected prior to castration. Since the main differences in indicators
   of pain between positive and negative controls were observed within the
   first h after castration, it is important to select drugs that act
   quickly after administration to facilitate practical processing
   schedules on farm.},

Title = {Full genome sequence analysis of a newly emerged QX-like infectious
   bronchitis virus from Sudan reveals distinct spots of recombination},
Journal = {INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {46},
Pages = {42-49},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infection continues to cause
   economically important diseases in poultry while different geno-and
   serotypes continue to circulate globally. Two infectious bronchitis
   viruses (IBV) were isolated from chickens with respiratory disease in
   Sudan. Sequence analysis of the hypervariable regions of the S1 gene
   revealed a close relation to the QX-like genotype which has not been
   detected in Sudan before. Whole genome analysis of
   IBV/Ck/Sudan/AR251-15/2014 isolate by next generation sequencing
   revealed a genome size of 27,646 nucleotides harbouring 13 open reading
   frames: 5'-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3'. Highest nucleotide
   sequence identity of 93\% for the whole genome was found with the
   Chinese IBV strain Ck/CH/LHLJ/140906, the Italian IBV isolate
   ITA/90254/2005 and the 4/91 vaccine strain. Phylogenetic analysis of the
   S1 gene revealed that the IBV/Ck/Sudan/AR251-15/2014 isolate clustered
   togetherwith viruses of the GI-19 lineage. Recombination analysis gave
   evidence for distinct patterns of origin of RNA in the Sudanese isolate
   in multiple genes. Several sites of recombination were scattered
   throughout the genome suggesting that the Sudan-QX like strain emerged
   as a unique recombinant from multiple recombination events of parental
   viruses from 4/91, H120 and ITA/90254/2005 genotypes. The Sudanese
   QX-like isolate is plausibly genetically different from IBV strains
   previously reported in Africa and elsewhere. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Relationship between the ovarian follicular response at the start of an

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the
   ovarian follicular response at the start of the OVsynch-fixed-time
   artificial insemination (TAI) program and pregnancy outcome in the
   Mediterranean river buffalo. The study involved 116 pluriparous
   buffaloes at 118 +/- 65 days in milk maintained under commercial
   conditions on a buffalo dairy enterprise in southern Italy.
   Synchronization of the stage of the estrous cycle in the Ovsynch-TAI
   program involves an injection of GnRH on Day 0 (GnRH1), PGF(2 alpha). on
   Day 7, and GnRH on Day 9 (GnRH2). Timed artificial insemination is
   carried out on Day 10. Ovarian ultrasound examinations were undertaken
   on days 0, 2, 7, 9, 10, and 11 to record total follicles, the dimensions
   of follicles greater than 0.75 cm, dimensions of the corpus luteum (CL),
   and the occurrence of ovulation. Blood concentrations of P4 were
   measured on days 0 and 10 and 10 days after TAI. Pregnancy status was
   determined on days 27 and 45 after TAI to calculate late embryonic
   mortality. The data were analyzed by ANOVA and multiple logistic
   regression. A total of 70 of 116 (60.4\%) buffaloes showed ovulation
   after GnRH1. Buffaloes that ovulated after GnRH1 had a smaller (P <
   0.05) area of the ovulatory follicle on Day 0 compared with buffaloes
   that did not ovulate (1.08 +/- 0.1 and 1.29 +/- 0.1 cm(2),
   respectively). The former buffaloes also had a larger (P < 0.05) CL area
   (1.81 0.1 and 1.51 0.1 cm2, respectively) and greater (P < 0.05) blood
   concentrations of P4 (1.84 +/- 0.2 and 1.34 +/- 0.2 ng/mL, respectively)
   on Day 0. A larger (P < 0.05) proportion of buffaloes that ovulated
   after GnRH1 showed regression of the CL after the injection of PGF2a on
   Day 7 compared with buffaloes that did not ovulate (68 of 69 {[}98.6\%]
   and 27 of 32 {[}84.4\%], respectively). Buffaloes that ovulated after
   GnRH1 also had a greater (P < 0.05) ovulation rate after GnRH2 than
   buffaloes that did not ovulate (65 of 70 {[}92.8\%] and 37 of 46
   {[}80.4\%], respectively). Buffaloes that ovulated after GnRH1 had a
   higher (P < 0.01) pregnancy rate than buffaloes that did not ovulate,
   both at Day 27 (53 of 70 {[}75.7\%] and 14 of 46 {[}30.4\%],
   respectively) and Day 45 (46 of 70 {[}65.7\%] and 10 of 46 {[}21.7\%],
   respectively). The incidence of late embryonic mortality tended to be
   less for buffaloes that ovulated after GnRH1 than buffaloes that did not
   ovulate (7 of 53 {[}13.2\%] and 4 of 14 {[}28.6\%], respectively). The
   present findings have demonstrated a strong direct relationship between
   the ovarian follicular response at the start of an OVsynch-TAI program
   and pregnancy outcome in the Mediterranean river buffalo. (C) 2016

Title = {Modelling the impact of co-circulating low pathogenic avian influenza
   viruses on epidemics of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry},
Journal = {EPIDEMICS},

Abstract = {It is well known that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses
   emerge through mutation of precursor low pathogenic avian influenza
   (LPAI) viruses in domestic poultry populations. The potential for
   immunological cross-protection between these pathogenic variants is
   recognised but the epidemiological impact during co-circulation is not
   well understood. Here we use mathematical models to investigate whether
   altered flock infection parameters consequent to primary LPAI infections
   can impact on the spread of HPAI at the population level. First we used
   mechanistic models reflecting the co-circulatory dynamics of LPAI and
   HPAI within a single commercial poultry flock. We found that primary
   infections with LPAI led to HPAI prevalence being maximised under a
   scenario of high but partial cross-protection. We then tested the
   population impact in spatially-explicit simulations motivated by a major
   avian influenza A(H7N1) epidemic that afflicted the Italian poultry
   industry in 1999-2001. We found that partial cross-protection can lead
   to a prolongation of HPAI epidemic duration. Our findings have
   implications for the control of HPAI in poultry particularly for
   settings in which LPAI and HPAI frequently co-circulate. (C) 2016 The

Title = {Reference intervals for serum haptoglobin, cortisol and lysozyme in
   immediate post-partum and lactating dairy goats},
Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {22},
Number = {6},
Pages = {267-270},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Introduction - In Northern Italy the most common breeds reared for milk
   production are Saanen and Chamois Colored. Delivery and peak of
   lactation are two critical points during the life of a dairy goat and
   serum lysozyme activity, haptoglobin and cortisol are indicators of non
   specific immunity and stress that could be easily applicable in field
   evaluations.
   Aim - The objective of this study was to calculate Reference Intervals
   (RIs) in according to the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry
   (IFCC) and Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI).
   Materials and methods - 132 animals were sampled immediately postpartum
   and at peak of lactation. Sera obtained in laboratory were stored in
   aliquots at - 80 degrees C until analysis. Serum lysozyme was assessed
   by the lyso-plate assay, serum haptoglobin was measured by a
   colorimetric kit and serum cortisol was measured by a solid-phase,
   competitive chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay.
   Results and discussion - RIs for lysozyme were 0.7-6.4 mu g/ mL for
   Chamois Colored in the immediate postpartum and 0.6-4.7 mu g/ mL for
   Saanen. RIs for haptoglobin were 0-0.2 mg/ mL and 0-0.8 for Chamois
   Colored and Saanen respectively in the immediately postpartum while
   increased slightly in Chamois Colored and decreased for Saanen at the
   peak of lactation. Cortisol serum level were 0.1-3.4 mu g/ dL for
   Chamois Colored and 0.1-3.5 for Saanen in the immediately postpartum and
   they were 0.12.9 and 0-3.3 at the peak of lactation respectively.
   Conclusions - The results provide a well-established, statistically
   defined RIs for haptoglobin, lysozyme and cortisol for the two of the
   most typical dairy breeds goats raised in Northern Italy in two critical
   stages of goat breeding and could be indicators of animals health and
   welfare.},

Abstract = {BackgroundIdentification of Leishmania infantum-infected dogs is crucial
   for control of canine leishmaniosis. In particular, in areas where
   access to specialized laboratories is limited, the availability of
   reliable and rapid in-clinic serologic tests may support immediate
   diagnosis in suspected cases and permit detection of asymptomatic canine
   carriers of L infantum infection.
   ObjectiveThe purpose of the study was to validate the
   immunochromatographic test (ICT) Anigen Rapid Leishmania Ab Test kit for
   detection of L infantum antibodies in naturally exposed dogs in
   comparison with the immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT).
   MethodsSerum samples from 66 dogs, including 20 healthy control dogs and
   46 dogs suspected or confirmed with canine leishmaniosis, were measured
   by both tests. Anti-Leishmania IgG titers 1:40 by IFAT were considered
   positive. Kappa statistic with a 95\% CI was calculated to evaluate
   agreement between the 2 testing methods, and sensitivity, specificity,
   and positive and negative likelihood ratio were calculated.
   ResultsAnti-L infantum IgG antibodies were found in 35 of 66 samples
   using the IFAT test (titers 1:40-1:5120). Thirty-one out of 66 samples
   tested positive with the qualitative ICT. Four IFAT-positive (titers <
   1:80) samples were ICT-negative. The Kappa value of 0.853 demonstrated
   very good agreement between the 2 tests.
   ConclusionThe Anigen Rapid Leishmania Ab Test kit reliably identified
   canine sera with anti-L infantum IgG antibody titers 1:40. The ICT
   requires neither special preparation of the serum nor specialized
   equipment and can be stored at ambient temperature. The test is
   applicable as a field test because it is easy to use and provides rapid
   results.},

Title = {Disposition of Stanozolol in Plasma After Intra-articular Administration

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to provide data on the disposition of
   stanozolol after bilateral intra-articular injection in the tarsal
   joints, to discover the length of time for which the drug can be
   detected in plasma after administration. Fourteen horses were included
   in the study. After aseptically preparing the injection site, 1 mL of an
   aqueous suspension containing 5 mg of stanozolol was injected into both
   the right and left tarsal joints of 12 horses; the two remaining animals
   were not treated and were used as a control group. Five milliliters of
   blood was collected immediately before stanozolol administration (t0)
   and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132,
   144, 156, and 168 hours after injection. The plasma concentration was
   determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
   after solid phase extraction. The maximum plasma concentration was 1.7
   ng/mL (range, 0.5-3.0 ng/mL), measured at 6 hours (range, 4-12 hours).
   The plasma elimination half life varied between 4 and 12 hours, whereas
   the plasma clearance per fraction of dose absorbed was in the
   257.85-820.88 L/h range. The results of the present study make a
   preliminary contribution toward understanding the elimination profile of
   intra-articularly administered stanozolol in the horse. The drug passes
   rapidly into the systemic circulation, is eliminated rapidly, and is
   detected in plasma for no more than 36 hours after local administration.

Abstract = {Bovine papillomavirus type 13 (BPV-13), a novel Deltapapillomavirus, has
   been found associated with urothelial tumours of the urinary bladder of
   cattle grazing on lands infested with bracken fern. BPV-13 was detected
   in 28 of 39 urothelial tumours. Diagnosis was based on sequencing of L1
   and E5 amplicons from tumour samples. The nucleotide sequences generated
   from these amplicons showed a 100\% homology with the sequences of
   BPV-13 L1 and E5 DNA found in Brazil from a fibropapilloma of the ear in
   a cow and from equine sarcoids in two horses. GenBank accession number
   of our representative BPV-13 sequences is JQ798171.1. Furthermore, mRNA
   encoding BPV-13 E5 oncoprotein was also documented, and its expression
   was also shown by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence in the
   basal and suprabasal urothelial tumour cells. In twenty-three tumours,
   BPV-13 was simultaneously found with BPV-2, a Deltapapillomavirus genus,
   species 4. The latter virus was detected by amplifying and sequencing a
   154-bp-sized DNA fragment of BPV-2 E5. In addition, BPV-13 by itself was
   seen to be expressed in five BPV-2-negative urothelial tumours. This
   study shows that BPV-13 is present in urothelial tumour cells thus
   sharing biological properties with BPV-1 and BPV-2. Although further
   studies are needed, BPV13 appears to be another worldwide infectious
   agent responsible for a distressing disease causing severe economic
   losses in cattle industry.},

Abstract = {Three biodegradable thermoplastic polymers, poly(epsilon-caprolactone)
   (PCL), poly(L-lactide-co-D,L-lactide) (PLA) and
   poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), have been used to produce nonwovens
   scaffolds with uniform micrometer fibres. Scaffolds' physical and
   morphological characterization was performed by X-ray diffraction,
   Scanning Electron Microscopy and Contact-Angle test Morphological
   investigations revealed that all produced fibres were randomly
   orientated with interconnected pores ranging between 5 and 12 pm in
   diameter. An average fibre diameter of 1.5, 0.75 and 1.2 mu m was found
   for PCL, PLA and PLGA, respectively.
   Moreover, experiments were designed to verify whether the fabricated
   electrospun substrates were biocompatible for ovine amniotic epithelial
   stem cells (oAECs) under in vitro conditions. Cell adhesion, survival,
   spatial organization on fibres, proliferation index, and DNA
   quantification after 48 h culture, showed an enhanced adhesion and
   proliferation, especially for PLGA scaffolds.
   The favourable interaction between oAECs and the fibrous scaffolds was
   attributed to the greatly improved porosity and pore size distribution
   of the electrospun scaffolds. In addition, AECs can be considered ideal
   for tissue engineering especially when using biocompatible and
   opportunely produced scaffolds. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {For consumers, honey is a natural product that should not be subjected
   to treatment or alteration. Since the question of the presence of
   genetically modified organisms concerned pollen in honey, the aim of
   this research was to find an alternative, however, practical and
   efficient method of honey and bee pollen DNA extraction for routine
   analysis application. Furthermore, to evaluate the extracted DNA, a
   real-time PCR system based on the actin gene was optimized and validated
   in fast mode for the first time to reduce analysis time. To develop an
   alternative DNA extraction protocol, two already published procedures
   were combined and tested with some variations, in particular without
   beads/filters used to grind/enrich pollen. The best approach found in
   terms of quantity and quality of extracted DNA was a combination of the
   pretreatment and the extraction method, described in the German
   guideline, with some modifications and the addition of a DNA
   purification kit. This protocol was validated with DNA extracts from
   honey and bee pollen and it was applied to 18 commercial honey samples.
   Furthermore, a sample proved positive in transgenic screening elements
   analysis and for transgenic event identification, a knowledge-based
   approach was adopted. Since the DNA extraction protocol proved suitable,
   it could be applied for other analysis such as molecular species
   characterization, the study of traceability, and environmental
   monitoring, considering honey as a vector of authorized and not
   authorized genetically modified organisms.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE
   To create an atlas of the normal CT anatomy of the head of blue-and-gold
   macaws (Ara ararauna), African grey parrots (Psittacus erithacus), and
   monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus).
   ANIMALS
   3 blue-and-gold macaws, 5 African grey parrots, and 6 monk parakeets and
   cadavers of 4 adult blue-and-gold macaws, 4 adult African grey parrots,
   and 7 monk parakeets.
   PROCEDURES
   Contrast-enhanced CT imaging of the head of the live birds was performed
   with a 4-multidetector-row CT scanner. Cadaveric specimens were stored
   at -20 degrees C until completely frozen, and each head was then sliced
   at 5-mm intervals to create reference cross sections. Frozen cross
   sections were cleaned with water and photographed on both sides.
   Anatomic structures within each head were identified with the aid of the
   available literature, labeled first on anatomic photographs, and then
   matched to and labeled on corresponding CT images. The best CT
   reconstruction filter, window width, and window level for obtaining
   diagnostic images of each structure were also identified.
   RESULTS
   Most of the clinically relevant structures of the head were identified
   in both the cross-sectional photographs and corresponding CT images.
   Optimal visibility of the bony structures was achieved via CT with a
   standard soft tissue filter and pulmonary window. The use of contrast
   medium allowed a thorough evaluation of the soft tissues.
   CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE
   The labeled CT images and photographs of anatomic structures of the
   heads of common pet parrot species created in this study may be useful
   as an atlas to aid interpretation of images obtained with any imaging
   modality.},

Abstract = {The most effective and sustainable method to control and eliminate
   rabies in wildlife is the oral rabies vaccination (ORV) of target
   species, namely foxes and raccoon dogs in Europe. According to WHO and
   OIE, the effectiveness of oral vaccination campaigns should be regularly
   assessed via disease surveillance and ORV antibody monitoring. Rabies
   antibodies are generally screened for in field animal cadavers, whose
   body fluids are often of poor quality. Therefore, the use of alternative
   methods such as the enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been
   proposed to improve reliability of serological results obtained on
   wildlife samples. We undertook an international collaborative study to
   determine if the commercial BioPro ELISA Rabies Ab kit is a reliable and
   reproducible tool for rabies serological testing. Our results reveal
   that the overall specificity evaluated on naive samples reached 96.7\%,
   and the coefficients of concordance obtained for fox and raccoon dog
   samples were 97.2\% and 97.5\%, respectively. The overall agreement
   values obtained for the four marketed oral vaccines used in Europe were
   all equal to or greater than 95\%. The coefficients of concordance
   obtained by laboratories ranged from 87.2\% to 100\%. The results of
   this collaborative study show good robustness and reproducibility of the
   BioPro ELISA Rabies Ab kit. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The Simbu serogroup of orthobunyaviruses comprises a wide range of
   viruses with different medical and veterinary relevance. These viruses
   are known to reassort, and coinfection of the same cell is one of the
   prerequisites for reassortment. Here, a mammalian cell line was infected
   with various members of this virus group, inoculated after several time
   points with a second Simbu serogroup virus, and analyzed by strain or
   species specific immunofluorescence staining. Different virus species or
   different strains of the same virus species were able to co-infect
   mammalian cells, but only for a limited time frame. After a few hours,
   the replication of the first virus led to a gradual inhibition of a
   second virus until a complete resistance to superinfection after 24 h
   regardless whether it is another strain of the same virus species or a
   distinct member of the serogroup. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {African swine fever (ASF) is one of the most severe diseases of pigs; it
   has a drastic impact on the pig industry, causing serious socio-economic
   consequences to pig farmers and pork producers. In Europe, there are
   currently two main clusters of infection; one in Sardinia caused by
   strains of African swine fever virus (ASFV) belonging to genotype I and
   another in Eastern Europe caused by strains of ASFV belonging to
   genotype II. The latter is inducing an acute form of ASF and it
   represents a serious threat to the pig sector. ASF is a disease for
   which there is no effective vaccine; therefore, prevention has a pivotal
   role in the control strategy of the disease. This review describes the
   main preventive measures to adopt to mitigate the risk of ASF spread in
   pig farming systems.},

Title = {Encephalomyocarditis virus infection in Macaca sylvanus and Hystrix
   cristata from an Italian rescue centre for wild and exotic animals},
Journal = {VIROLOGY JOURNAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {13},
Month = {NOV 28},
Abstract = {Background: The Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) is a small, non
   enveloped, positive sense single-stranded RNA virus in the genus
   Cardiovirus, family Picornaviridae, with two known serotypes. It is
   spread worldwide and infects a huge range of vertebrate hosts with
   zoonotic potential for humans. The pig is the mammal most likely to be
   impacted on with the disease, but EMCV occurrence has also been reported
   in non-human primates and in a variety of domestic, captive and wild
   animals. Until now, human cases have been very rare and the risk appears
   to be almost negligible in spite of human susceptibility to the
   infection.
   Case presentation: Between September and November 2012 a fatal
   Encephalomyocarditis virus outbreak involving four Barbary macaques and
   24 crested porcupines occurred at a rescue centre for wild and exotic
   animals in Central Italy. In this open-field zoo park located near
   Grosseto, Tuscany about 1000 animals belonging to different species,
   including various non-human primates were hosted at that time. Sudden
   deaths were generally observed without any evident symptoms or only with
   mild nonspecific clinical signs. The major gross change was
   characterised by grey-white necrotic foci in the myocardium and the same
   EMCV strain was isolated both in macaques and crested porcupines.
   Phylogenetic analysis has confirmed that only one EMCV strain is
   circulating in Italy, capable of infecting different animal species.
   Conclusions: This report confirms the susceptibility of non-human
   primates to the EMCV infection and describes the disease in porcupine, a
   common wild Italian and African species. No human cases were observed,
   but given the zoonotic potential of EMCV these findings are of
   importance in the context of animal-human interface.},

Abstract = {Q fever is a zoonosis caused by Coxiella burnetii which infects humans
   as well as several animal species; sheep, goats and cattle are the
   primary animal reservoir. The main route of human exposure to Coxiella
   burnetii is inhalation of contaminated aerosols from excreta, especially
   birth products, while the role of unpasteurized dairy products in the
   transmission of Q fever to humans remains still controversial.
   The aim of this work was to evaluate the presence of Coxiella burnetii
   in unpasteurized cheese samples (n = 84) by PCR and to genotype the
   circulating strains by Multispacer sequence typing (MST) analysis.
   Coxiella burnetii DNA was detected in 27/84 (32.14\%) cheeses and
   positivity rate of handicraft cheeses reached 17.24\%, while positivity
   rate of non-handicraft cheeses reached 65.38\%. In addition, the MST
   profile of Coxiella burnetii detected in 5 cheese samples have shown the
   circulation of ST12 and ST32 genotypes in Tuscany. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   Development, Keystone, CO, 2015},
Abstract = {High levels of production in intensive farming systems are associated
   with increased replacement rates as a result of multifactorial diseases.
   The so-called ``production diseases{''} may include low-grade infection
   reducing profitability without increased morbidity. Such infections are
   sustained by low pathogenic viral and bacterial agents which give rise
   to full-blown disease in association with poor environmental conditions.
   In these farms, the results of vaccination may be disappointing.
   Therefore, fundamental issues should be dealt with toward successful
   immunoprophylaxis. High lean meat and milk production are associated
   with chronic inflammation and activation of the innate immune system
   vis-a-vis cellular stress. This may negatively affect adaptive immune
   responses. A negative modulation of the host micro biome by farm
   management practices and drug treatments is a further risk factor. The
   immune response to stressed cells questions the usual correlates of
   protection investigated after vaccination. In particular, there is
   evidence that specific and non-specific immune responses may overlap in
   vitro as a result of a high level of innate immune responses to
   Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPS) and stress antigens. A
   vigorous adaptive immune response to microbial agents may be sometimes
   counterproductive, as suggested in porcine reproductive and respiratory
   syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection. Alternative outcomes should be
   sometimes pursued: a better homeostatic control of the inflammatory
   response, effective and self-limiting innate immune responses, and even
   tolerance induction. On the whole, successful immunoprophylaxis in
   intensive farming systems demands co-ordinated and multi-disciplinary
   efforts in terms of animal breeding, farm management and hygiene,
   correct choice and harmonization of the prophylactic tools (vaccines,
   immunomodulators, pre- and probiotics). Finally, there is evidence that
   disease-predicting parameters of the innate immune response may greatly
   ease the identification of herds and animals at risk, and contribute to
   reduced antibiotic usage on farm. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {During the period 2004-2014 in the Abruzzi region (Central Italy),
   muscle samples gathered from hunted wild boars (n=16,323) and retrieved
   from carcasses of other susceptible wild mammals (n=838) and birds
   (n=438) were tested for Trichinella larvae according to European Union
   regulations. Although no positive samples were found from wild birds, 91
   wild mammals tested positive. Six species were found to harbor
   Trichinella spp. infections, namely wolf (Canis lupus, 59 positive
   samples out of 218), red fox (Vulpes vulpes, 24/480), wild boar (Sus
   scrofa, 3/16,323), stone marten (Martel foina, 2/27), pine marten
   (Mattes martes, 2/6) and wildcat (Felis silvestris, 1/8). All isolates
   tested for species attribution belonged to Trichinella britovi. The
   overall prevalence was 0.52\% (IC 95\%: 0.4-0.6). The higher frequency
   of positive samples in wolf, compared to red fox, was statistically
   significant (p = 0.001). In spite of the limited geographical area of
   investigation and the random nature of sampling, this study provides new
   data on the circulation of T. britovi in Italy. In particular, the
   highest prevalence being found among wolves allows us to consider this
   species as a sentinel for T. britovi infection in the investigated area,
   and probably also in other apennine regions, which is different from the
   alpine regions where the red fox was reputed as the primary reservoir of
   Trichinella spp. infection. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In August 2012 repeated respiratory outbreaks caused by swine influenza
   A virus (swIAV) were registered for a whole year in a breeding farm in
   northeast Italy that supplied piglets for fattening. The virus,
   initially characterized in the farm, was a reassortant Eurasian
   avian-like H1N1 (H1(av)N1) genotype, containing a haemagglutinin segment
   derived from the pandemic H1N1 (A(H1N1)pdm09) lineage. To control
   infection, a vaccination program using vaccines against the
   A(H1N1)pdm09, human-like H1N2 (H1(hu)N2), human-like H3N2 (H3N2), and
   H1(av)N1 viruses was implemented in sows in November 2013. Vaccine
   efficacy was assessed by sampling nasal swabs for two months in 35-75
   day-old piglets born from vaccinated sows. Complete genome sequencing of
   eight swIAV-positive nasal swabs collected longitudinally from piglets
   after the implementation of the vaccination program was conducted to
   investigate the virus characteristics.
   Over the two-month period, two different genotypes involving multiple
   reassortment events were detected. The unexpected circulation of
   multiple reassortant genotypes in such a short time highlights the
   complexity of the genetic diversity of swIAV and the need for a better
   surveillance plan, based on the combination of clinical signs,
   epidemiological data and whole genome characterization. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Beta-sympathomimetic compounds are widely used in therapy because of the
   bronchodilator, smooth muscle-relaxant and tocolytic properties.
   However, their growth promoting and performance enhancing effects are
   often subject to illegal use. The present work describes the development
   of a fast and reliable analytical multiresidue method for the
   confirmation 20 beta-agonist compounds in animal hair. The procedure is
   based on alkaline digestion, LLE with organic solvents, SPE clean up and
   liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) analysis,
   and is suitable for the public Official control of beta-agonist residues
   in hair sample.
   Validation was performed according to Commission Decision 2002/657/EC
   requirements. Independent samples spiked with the investigated compounds
   in the range 0.2-10.0 mu g kg(-1) are showing intra-day and inter-day
   precision (RSD) lower than 17.8\% and 19.7\%, respectively. Linearity,
   measured in the range of 0.1-10.0 mu g kg(-1), resulted with a Pearson's
   r > 0.996. The decision limits (CC alpha) for the all investigated beta
   agonists resulted in the range 0.2-1.0 mu g kg(-1).
   Furthermore, the method was tested on real hair samples obtained from
   cattle, known as positive to clenbuterol, in order to check its
   effectiveness and the beta-agonists stability. Published by Elsevier

Title = {Comparative liver accumulation of dioxin-like compounds in sheep and
   cattle: Possible role of AhR-mediated xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {571},
Pages = {1222-1229},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {PCDDs, PCDFs, and PCBs are persistent organic pollutants (POPS) that
   accumulate in animal products and may pose serious health problems.
   Those able to bind the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), eliciting a
   plethora of toxic responses, are defined dioxin-like (DL) compounds,
   while the remainders are called non-DL (NDL). An EFSA opinion has
   highlighted the tendency of ovine liver to specifically accumulate
   DL-compounds to a greater extent than any other farmed ruminant species.
   To examine the possible role in such an accumulation of xenobiotic
   metabolizing enzymes (XME) involved in DL-compound biotransformation,
   liver samples were collected from ewes and cows reared in an area known
   for low dioxin contamination. A related paper reported that sheep livers
   had about 5-fold higher DL-compound concentrations than cattle livers,
   while the content of the six marker NDL-PCBs did not differ between
   species. Specimens from the same animals were subjected to gene
   expression analysis for AhR, AhR nuclear translocator (ARNT) and
   AhR-dependent oxidative and conjugative pathways; XME protein expression
   and activities were also investigated. Both AhR and ARNT mRNA levels
   were about 2-fold lower in ovine samples and the same occurred for
   CYP1A1 and CYP1A2, being approximately 3 -and 9-fold less expressed in
   sheep compared to cattle, while CYP1B1 could be detectable in cattle
   only. The results of the immunoblotting and catalytic activity (most
   notably EROD) measurements of the CYP1A family enzymes were in line with
   the gene expression data. By contrast, phase II enzyme expression and
   activities in sheep were higher (UGT1A) or similar (GSTA1, NQO1) to
   those recorded in cattle. The overall low expression of CYP1 family
   enzymes in the sheep is in line with the observed liver accumulation of
   DL-compounds and is expected to affect the kinetics and the dynamics of
   other POPs such as many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, as well as of
   toxins (e.g. aflatoxins) or drugs (e.g. benzimidazole anthelmintics)
   known to be metabolized by those enzymes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {FOOD CHEMISTRY},

Abstract = {Recently there has been growing interest in the discovery of new
   antimicrobial agents to increase safety and shelf-life of food products.
   Here, we developed an innovative approach by introducing the concept
   that mitochondrial targeting peptides (MTP) can interact and disrupt
   bacterial membranes, acting as antimicrobial agents. As
   proof-of-principle, we used a multidisciplinary strategy by combining in
   silico predictions, docking simulations and antimicrobial assays, to
   identify two peptides, MTP1 and MTP2, which were structurally and
   functionally characterized. Both compounds appeared effective against
   Listeria monocytogenes, one of the most important foodborne pathogens.
   Specifically, a significant bactericidal activity was evidenced with
   EC50 values of 16.8 +/- 1.2 mu M for MTP1 and 109 +/- 7.0 mu M for MTP2.
   Finally, NMR structure determinations suggested that MTP1 would be
   oriented into the membrane bilayer, while the molecular shape of MTP2
   could indicate porin-mediated antimicrobial mechanisms, as predicted
   using molecular docking analysis. Therefore, MTPs represent alternative
   sources to design new potential bio-preservatives. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {In livestock production corticosteroids are licensed only for therapy;
   nevertheless, they are often illegally used as growth promoters. The aim
   of this study was to identify morphological or biomolecular alterations
   induced by prednisolone (PDN) in experimentally treated beef cattle,
   because PDN and its metabolites are no longer detectable by LC-MS/MS
   methods in biological fluids. Moreover, PDN does not induce any
   histological alterations in the thymus, different from dexamethasone
   treatments. Therefore, a marker of illicit treatment for this growth
   promoter could be useful. Eight male Italian Friesian beef cattle were
   administered prednisolone acetate 30 mg day(-1) per os for 35 days, and
   seven beef cattle represented the control group. Six days after drug
   withdrawal, the animals were slaughtered. Morphological and morphometric
   modifications were evaluated in the epididymis and testis, whereas
   transcriptomic changes induced by PDN administration were investigated
   in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at different sampling
   times and in skeletal muscle and testis sampled at slaughtering. In the
   epididymis, spermatozoa number decreased in PDN-treated animals, and in
   some cases they were totally absent. Correspondingly, in the testis of
   treated animals, down-regulation for serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11)
   gene expression was detected (p < 0.01). DNA microarray analysis
   revealed a total of 133 differentially expressed genes in skeletal
   muscle and testis, and 907 and 1416 in PBMCs after 33 days of treatment
   and at slaughtering, respectively. Histological investigations on
   epididymal content could represent a promising marker for PDN treatment
   in beef cattle and could be used as a screening method to identify
   animals worthy of further investigation with official methods. Moreover,
   the clear transcriptomic signature of PDN treatment evidenced in PBMCs
   supported the possibility of using this matrix to monitor the illicit
   treatment in vivo during ranching.},

Title = {L-BSE experimentally transmitted to sheep presents as a unique disease
   phenotype},
Journal = {VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {47},
Month = {NOV 8},
Abstract = {Apart from prion protein genotype, the factors determining the host
   range and susceptiblity for specific transmissible spongiform
   encephalopathy agents remain unclear. It is known that bovine atypical
   L-BSE can transmit to a range of species including primates and
   humanised transgenic mice. It is important, therefore, that there is as
   broad an understanding as possible of how such isolates might present in
   food animal species and how robust they are on inter-and intra-species
   transmission to inform surveillance sytems and risk assessments. This
   paper demonstrates that L-BSE can be intracerebrally transmitted to
   sheep of several genotypes, with the exception of ARR/ARR animals.
   Positive animals mostly present with a cataplectic form of disease
   characterized by collapsing episodes and reduced muscle tone. PrP
   accumulation is confined to the nervous system, with the exception of
   one animal with lymphoreticular involvement. In Western blot there was
   maintenance of the low molecular mass and glycoform profile associated
   with L-BSE, irrespective of ovine host genotype, but there was a
   substantially higher N-terminal antibody signal relative to the
   core-specific antibody, which is similar to the ratio associated with
   classical scrapie. The disease phenotype was maintained on experimental
   subpassage, but with a shortened survival time indicative of an original
   species barrier and subsequent adaptation. Passive surveillance
   approaches would be unlikely to identify such cases as TSE suspects, but
   current statutory active screening methods would be capable of detecting
   such cases and classifying them as unusual and requiring further
   investigation if they were to occur in the field.},

Abstract = {Italy is one of the main producers and exporters of cheese made from
   unpasteurized sheep milk. Since raw milk and its derived products are
   known sources of human infections, cheese produced from raw sheep milk
   could pose a microbiological threat to public health. Hence, the
   objectives of the study were: to characterize the potential risk of the
   presence of pathogens Escherichia coli O157, Listeria monocytogenes, and
   Salmonella in raw ovine milk destined for cheese production obtained
   from all the sheep farms (n = 24) in the Marches region (Central Italy)
   that directly transform raw milk into cheeses and to evaluate the
   equivalence between the analytical methods applied. A three-step
   molecular method (simultaneous culture enrichment, species-specific DNA
   magnetic isolation, and multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction)
   was used for milk (n = 143) and cheese (n = 5) analysis over a 3year
   period. L. monocytogenes was not detected on any of the farms, while E.
   coli O157 was found on three farms, although only using the molecular
   method. Four farms tested positive for Salmonella spp., and Salmonella
   enterica subsp. diarizonae serovar 61:k:1,5,7 was isolated in one of
   those cases. This information highlights the need to develop
   preventative measures to guarantee a high level of consumer safety for
   this specific product line, and the molecular method could be a
   time-saving and sensitive tool to be used in routine diagnosis.},

Abstract = {Poultry are possible sources of non-typhoidal Salmonella serovars which
   may cause foodborne human disease. We conducted a cross-sectional study
   to determine the prevalence of Salmonella serovars in egg-laying hens
   and broilers at the farm level and their susceptibility to
   antimicrobials commonly used in the poultry industry in Ghana. Sampling
   of faeces by a sock method (n = 75), dust (n=75), feed (n = 10) and
   drinking water (n = 10) was performed at 75 commercial egg-laying and
   broiler farms in two regions of Ghana and skin neck (n = 30) at a local
   slaughterhouse from broilers representing different flocks. Salmonella
   was detected in 94/200 (47\%) samples with an overall flock prevalence
   of 44.0\%. Sixteen different serovars were identified with S. Kentucky
   (18.1\%), S. Nima (12.8\%), S. Muenster (10.6\%), S. Enteritidis
   (10.6\%) and S. Virchow (9.6 \%) the most prevalent types. The
   predominant phage type of S. Enteritidis was PT1. All strains were
   susceptible to cefotaxime, ceftazidime and cefoxitin. Fifty-seven
   (60.6\%) strains were resistant to one or more of the remaining nine
   antimicrobials tested by disk diffusion, of which 23 (40.4\%) showed
   multi-resistance (resistance to >= 3 classes of antimicrobials). Of the
   resistant strains (n=57), the most significant were to nalidixic acid
   (89.5\%), tetracycline (80.7\%), ciprofloxacin (64.9\%), sulfamethazole
   (42.1\%), trimethoprim (29.8\%) and ampicillin (26.3\%). All S. Kentucky
   strains were resistant to more than two antimicrobials and shared common
   resistance to nalidixic acid or ciprofloxacin and tetracycline, often in
   combinations with other antimicrobials. PFGE analysis using XbaI of S.
   Kentucky demonstrated one dominant clone in the country. In conclusion,
   poultry produced in Ghana has a high prevalence of multi-resistant
   Salmonella and the common finding of clonal S. Kentucky in the Kumasi
   area warrants further investigations into the epidemiology of this
   serovar. There is an urgent need for surveillance and control programmes
   on Salmonella and use of antimicrobials in the Ghanaian poultry industry
   to protect the health of consumers.},

Abstract = {Aim: The biomedical application of contrast agents based on
   superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles is still limited because of
   their short intravascular half-life. The potential of red blood cells
   (RBCs) loaded with new ferucarbotran nanoparticles as magnetic contrast
   agents with longer blood retention time has been investigated. Materials
   \& methods: Ferucarbotran was loaded into RBCs by a procedure of
   hypotonic dialysis and isotonic resealing. Ferucarbotran amounts
   encapsulated in RBCs were determined by NMR. The survival of
   ferucarbotran-loaded RBCs and bulk ferucarbotran was evaluated in the
   mouse bloodstream. Results: Blood retention time of these RBC constructs
   is longer (similar to 14 days) than the bulk ferucarbotran (similar to 1
   h) with a slower Fe clearance from liver and spleen. Conclusion:
   Ferucarbotran-loaded RBCs could be used as potential contrasting agents
   for diagnostic applications in MRI/magnetic particle imaging.},

Abstract = {Metals have strong toxic effects in humans and can act as
   immunoregulatory factors. The purpose of our study was to determine
   whether the concentrations of metals are associated with the clinical
   course of nasal polyposis (NP). We measured the concentrations of 10
   metals and non-metal (Zn, Mn, Se, Fe, Cr, Ni, Pb, Al, Cd, and Cu) in 58
   patients with NP, and 29 controls with a healthy nasal mucosa. We used
   electron microscopy to compare the ultrastructural features of the nasal
   mucosa between NP patients and healthy controls. Concentrations of
   metals in nasal polyps and healthy mucosa were determined by mass
   spectrometry. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) and scanning
   electron microscopic (SEM) images of the nasal mucosa were obtained. The
   mean tissue concentrations of all 10 metals and non-metal were
   significantly lower in NP patients than in healthy controls (P <
   0.05).TEM and SEM revealed changes in the mucosal ultrastructure in NP
   with progressive fibrosis, devascularisation, and inflammation. Tissue
   concentrations of metals were lower in NP patients than in healthy
   controls, and this was particularly evident in massive polyposis.},

Abstract = {The flagellated protozoan Dientamoeba fragilis is often detected in
   humans with gastrointestinal symptoms, but it is also commonly found in
   healthy subjects. As for other intestinal protozoa, the hypothesis that
   genetically dissimilar parasite isolates differ in their ability to
   cause symptoms has also been raised for D. fragilis. To date, only two
   D. fragilis genotypes (1 and 2) have been described, of which genotype 1
   largely predominates worldwide. However, very few markers are available
   for genotyping studies and therefore the extent of genetic variation
   among isolates remains largely unknown. Here, we performed metagenomics
   experiments on two D. fragilis-positive stool samples, and identified a
   number of candidate markers based on sequence similarity to the
   phylogenetically related species Trichomonas vaginalis. Markers
   corresponding to structural genes and to genes encoding for proteases
   were selected for this study, and PCR experiments confirmed their
   belonging to the D. fragilis genome; two previously described markers
   (small subunit ribosomal DNA and large subunit of RNA polymerase II)
   were also included. Using this panel of markers, 111 isolates of human
   origin were genotyped, all of which, except one, belonged to genotype 1.
   These isolates had been collected at different times from symptomatic
   and asymptomatic persons of different age groups in Italy, Denmark,
   Brazil and Australia. By sequencing approximately 160 kb from 500 PCR
   products, a very low level of polymorphism was observed across all the
   investigated loci, suggesting the existence of a major clone of D.
   fragilis with a widespread geographical distribution. (C) 2016

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},

Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {In recent years researchers have investigated a growing number of
   weighted heterogeneous networks, where connections are not merely binary
   entities, but are proportional to the intensity or capacity of the
   connections among the various elements. Different degree centrality
   measures have been proposed for this kind of networks. In this work we
   propose weighted degree and strength centrality measures (WDC and WSC).
   Using a reducing factor we correct classical centrality measures (CD) to
   account for tie weights distribution. The bigger the departure from
   equal weights distribution, the greater the reduction. These measures
   are applied to a real network of Italian livestock movements as an
   example. A simulation model has been developed to predict disease spread
   into Italian regions according to animal movements and animal population
   density. Model's results, expressed as infected regions and number of
   times a region gets infected, were related to weighted and classical
   degree centrality measures. WDC and WSC were shown to be more efficient
   in predicting node's risk and vulnerability. The proposed measures and
   their application in an animal network could be used to support
   surveillance and infection control strategy plans.},

Abstract = {Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) type 1 in Italy is characterized by
   high genetic diversity, with at least 20 subtypes. Subtype 1f is endemic
   in a restricted geographic area, meaning that it has local distribution.
   We investigated the population dynamics of BVDV-1f in Northern Italy and
   characterized the transmission chains of a subset of samples from
   Piedmont and Aosta Valley regions.
   A total of 51 samples from 1966 to 2013 were considered and 5' UTR
   sequences were used for phylogeography. A subset of 12 samples was
   selected for Npro gene sequencing and further characterization of the
   transmission chains using both molecular and epidemiological data.
   Phylogeography estimated the root of BVDV-1f tree in Veneto in 1965.
   Four significant subclades included sequences clustering by region:
   Lombardy (n = 3), Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna (n = 7), Piedmont (n =
   17), Piedmont and Aosta Valley (n = 21). The Piedmont-only subclade has
   a ladder-like branching structure, while the Piedmont and Aosta Valley
   subclade has a nearly complete binary structure. In the subset, the
   outbreak reconstruction identified one sample from Piedmont as the most
   probable source of infection for the Aosta Valley cases. An ad hoc
   questionnaire submitted to public veterinarians revealed connections
   between sampled and non-sampled farms by means of trades, exhibitions
   and markets.
   According to the phylogeography, BVDV-1f moved westward, entering from
   Veneto, and spreading to Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna in the early 1990s,
   and finally to Piedmont and Aosta Valley in the first decade of 2000s.
   Both phylogeographic analyses on the whole dataset and on the selection
   of Npro dataset pointed out that subtype 1f entered Aosta Valley from
   Piedmont.
   The integration of molecular and epidemiological data revealed
   connections between farms, and such approach should be considered in any
   control plan. In Aosta Valley, the study showed that BVDV1f can be
   controlled only monitoring the introduction of cattle from Piedmont
   region. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Water basins with low hydrodynamic activities can promote the growth and
   increase in algal biomass due to eutrophication, and toxic cyanobacteria
   species might then produce metabolites hazardous to human health. Over
   the last decade, a neurotoxic non-protein amino acid,
   (2S)-2-amino-3-(methylamino) propanoic acid, known as
   -N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), has become of particular interest
   because it has been hypothesised to be involved in progressive human
   neurodegenerative pathologies. This toxin can be found both in algal
   cells and free in water, as well as in some foods of aquatic and
   terrestrial origin. Analytical methods used for BMAA are often based on
   chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, although these techniques
   involve long and expensive analysis. As the availability of a faster and
   cheaper screening method would be useful, we tested the only available
   Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay kit for BMAA evaluation and validated
   methods to verify their reliability for the analysis of water and fish
   muscle. For both matrices, we determined adequate selectivity and
   repeatability (relative standard deviation < 6\%), with recoveries from
   70\% to 83\% at the tested spiking levels; the methods were also robust.
   These data appear in contrast to a previous evaluation carried out on
   the same kit in 2013, although this might depend on an improvement to
   the kit performance. We can conclude that a preliminary determination of
   BMAA in water, and also in fish tissue after an adequate extraction
   procedure, can be performed efficiently with the tested kit, which
   provides for easier monitoring of this dangerous toxin.},

Abstract = {The objective of the present study is to assess the variability of the
   measures used in the welfare quality (WQ) protocol for pigs among
   slaughterhouses in five different countries and to propose alarm and
   critical thresholds for the calculation of scores for future development
   of an animal welfare certification scheme. The WQ protocol was
   applied,in 52,468 pigs in 42 slaughterhouses in 5 countries (Portugal,
   Italy, Finland, Brazil and Spain). The welfare assessment started in the
   unloading area, where measures of general fear, thermoregulation,
   slipping and falling, lameness, sickness and mortality were taken.
   Concerning lairage, space allowance, drinking points, thermoregulation
   and mortality were considered, and the human-animal relationship was
   assessed by means of high-pitched vocalisations when pigs were moved
   from lairage to the stunning system. Finally, stunning effectiveness,
   skin lesions and presence of pneumonia, pleurisy, pericarditis and white
   spots on the liver were assessed in the stunning area and after
   slaughtering the animals. There was a large degree of variability among
   slaughterhouses for measurements made. For instance, the percentage of
   animals slipping ranged from 0.4\% to 57\%. Pigs with signs of recovery
   after stunning ranged from 0\% to 90\% and the percentage of carcasses
   that were severely damaged with skin lesions ranged from 0\% to 48\%.
   The data obtained can be useful to establish some thresholds for future
   uses of the WQ protocol. Electric stunning was associated with more
   animals recovering consciousness than from CO2.},

Abstract = {Rift Valley fever (RVF) is one of the most important zoonotic
   Transboundary Animal Diseases able to cross international borders and
   cause devastating effect on animal health and food security. Climate
   changes and the presence of competent vectors in the most of the current
   RVF-free temperate countries strongly support the inclusion of RVF virus
   (RVFV) among the most significant emerging viral threats for public and
   animal health. The transmission of RVFV is driven by complex
   eco-climatic factors making the epidemiology of RVF infection difficult
   to study and to understand. Mathematical, statistical and spatial models
   are often used to explain the mechanisms underlying these biological
   processes, providing new and effective tools to plan measures for public
   health protection. In this paper we performed a systematic literature
   review on RVF published papers with the aim of identifying and
   describing the most recent papers developing compartmental models for
   the study of RVFV transmission dynamics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The current study investigated the effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus
   and Bacillus subtilis, used as probiotics, on the microflora,
   morphology, and morphometry of the gut in organic laying hens. The birds
   (180 Hy-Line laying hens) were divided into 3 homogenous groups and
   received a pre-deposition diet from 16 to 20 wk of age and a deposition
   diet for the remaining 7 months of the experiment. The control group
   (CTR) was fed a corn-soybean cake-based diet, the second group (L)
   received the same diet supplemented with 0.1\% of L. acidophilus while
   in the third group (B) the basal diet was supplemented with 0.05\% of B.
   subtilis. At 18 wk of age (T1) and at 5 (T2) and 7 months (T3) from the
   beginning of deposition, 9 subjects per group were humanely killed for
   microbiological, morphological and morphometric analyses of the
   intestinal tract. The 2 probiotic-supplemented diets increased
   Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. counts compared with the CTR
   diet. The lowest viable counts of E. coli, coliforms and staphylococci
   were observed in the L group (P < 0.001). Clostridium spp. decreased (P
   < 0.001) in both L and B subjects. The probiotic supplementation
   appeared to affect the intestinal microbial population, promoting the
   presence of beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillus spp. and
   Bifidobacterium spp. and reducing potential harmful bacteria such as E.
   coli, clostridia and staphylococci. Morphological and morphometric
   analyses did not reveal substantial differences among groups. At T3, the
   plasma cell infiltrate in the villi of the CTR hens was more severe than
   that observed in the L and B groups (P = 0.009).},

Abstract = {Background: A diversifying pool of mammalian-adapted influenza A viruses
   (IAV) with largely unknown zoonotic potential is maintained in domestic
   swine populations worldwide. The most recent human influenza pandemic in
   2009 was caused by a virus with genes originating from IAV isolated from
   swine. Swine influenza viruses (SIV) are widespread in European domestic
   pig populations and evolve dynamically. Knowledge regarding occurrence,
   spread and evolution of potentially zoonotic SIV in Europe is poorly
   understood.
   Objectives: Efficient SIV surveillance programmes depend on sensitive
   and specific diagnostic methods which allow for cost-effective
   large-scale analysis.
   Methods: New SIV haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) subtype-and
   lineage-specific multiplex real-time RT-PCRs (RT-qPCR) have been
   developed and validated with reference virus isolates and clinical
   samples.
   Results: A diagnostic algorithm is proposed for the combined detection
   in clinical samples and subtyping of SIV strains currently circulating
   in Europe that is based on a generic, M-gene-specific influenza A virus
   RT-qPCR. In a second step, positive samples are examined by tetraplex
   HA-and triplex NA-specific RT-qPCRs to differentiate the porcine
   subtypes H1, H3, N1 and N2. Within the HA subtype H1, lineages ``av{''}
   (European avian-derived), ``hu{''} (European human-derived) and
   ``pdm{''} (human pandemic A/H1N1, 2009) are distinguished by RT-qPCRs,
   and within the NA subtype N1, lineage ``pdm{''} is differentiated. An
   RT-PCR amplicon Sanger sequencing method of small fragments of the HA
   and NA genes is also proposed to safeguard against failure of multiplex
   RT-qPCR subtyping.
   Conclusions: These new multiplex RT-qPCR assays provide adequate tools
   for sustained SIV monitoring programmes in Europe.},

Abstract = {Sr-90 is considered an important contaminant relating to food supply
   chains. In this study, 176 liquid and 260 solid foods, were analysed in
   order to quantify Sr-90.
   Through ruggedness tests, the application field of radiochemical methods
   used was extended successfully to all most important types of
   foodstuffs.
   Regarding liquid matrices, milk samples resulted the most important
   indicator about Sr-90 contamination, with mean Sr-90 activity
   concentration equal to 0.058 Bq L-1. Among other liquid foods,
   wine/spirits and livestock watering resulted the most contaminated, with
   mean contamination levels equal to 0.022 and 0.035 Bq L-1, respectively.
   Concerning solid matrices, cheeses produced from sheep's milk and animal
   feeds resulted the most contaminated (mean levels: 1.237 and 1.557 Bq
   kg(-1), respectively). Meat products and seafood showed contamination
   levels not significant within this survey; while, among vegetables,
   cacao/chocolate and spices resulted in contamination levels comparable
   with those of cheese obtained from milk of cows origin. (C) 2016

Abstract = {This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of Salmonella spp.
   and their antimicrobial susceptibilities on poultry and swine farms,
   sampled in 2 regions in Central Vietnam. A total of 67 poultry farms and
   46 swine farms were sampled in a period of 5months (from September 2012
   to January 2013). Salmonella spp. was prevalent in 46.3\% and 71.7\% of
   poultry and swine farms, respectively. Altogether, 99 non-typhoidal
   Salmonella were isolated and the most common serovars were Salmonella
   Weltevreden (19\%), followed by Salmonella Typhimurium (12\%) and
   Salmonella 4,{[}5],12:i:- (11\%). Overall, 71 of 99 (72\%) Salmonella
   isolates were resistant to at least one of the 14 antimicrobial agents
   tested. Both in poultry and swine farms, high levels of resistance were
   observed for ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin,
   sulphamethoxazole and tetracycline. The presence of Salmonella isolates
   from poultry and swine farms which were resistant to different classes
   of antimicrobials suggests that alternative control measures to
   antimicrobials should be implemented. Moreover, an effective policy
   should be promoted to encourage a prudent use of these agents in animal
   farming in Vietnam.},

Abstract = {Cancer immunosuppression that facilitates tumor progression and
   metastasis evolves by development of an immunosuppressive network. The
   aim of this study was to assess this network in dogs with benign or
   malignant tumors with or without confirmed metastasis. The authors
   showed that the number of various T cell subpopulations was constant
   during tumor development; however the number of regulatory T cells
   (Tregs) was significantly higher in tumor-bearing dogs than in healthy
   individuals. The number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and
   their p-STAT3 expression (which is a negative regulator of hematopoiesis
   and regulates VEGF expression) were higher in cancer patients than in
   control dogs, however their number increased significantly in late-stage
   cancer patients. Canine mammary carcinomas with confirmed metastases to
   either lymph nodes or internal organs had greater MDSCs and Treg
   infiltration than benign mammary tumors or malignant mammary tumors for
   which metastases had not been detected. Similarly, expression of p-STAT3
   and VEGF-C was the highest in tumors with confirmed metastases. This
   research shows changes occurring in the blood (n = 30 patients) and
   tumor tissue of patients (n = 100) during canine mammary tumor
   development. The findings should be considered preliminary because of
   the small number of samples. Nonetheless, the findings suggest that a
   high level of Tregs and MDSCs as well as high expression of p-STAT3 and
   VEGF-C may significantly contribute to mammary tumor progression and
   metastasis in dogs.},

Abstract = {We sequenced coding portions (1.6 kb) of the mtDNA in 170 loggerhead
   (Caretta caretta) turtles sampled in the central Mediterranean. The
   sequences spanned the entire ND1 and ND3 genes, the tRNAGly and tRNAArg,
   plus the 30 and 50 termini of COXIII and ND4L genes, respectively. Based
   on our sequencing results and published complete mitogenomes, we
   constructed a maximum parsimony phylogeny of C. caretta matrilines that
   sheds new light on the evolutionary relationships within the collection
   of lineages found in the Mediterranean and so far recognized by D-loop
   haplotypes only. We show that the new variants are useful to understand
   the ancestry of extant haplotypes, to improve genetically based studies
   on the philopatry and migratory behavior of the species, and for
   conservation purposes. In order to better understand the biological
   significance of the observed variation, we addressed intraspecific
   nonsynonymous substitutions in the context of the three-dimensional
   modeled structures of ND1 and ND3. The positions of variant amino acids
   within the folded subunits are consistent with a coadaptation with the
   restructuring of membrane thickness, fluidity, and lipid composition, a
   well-known response mechanism to thermal conditions. The pattern of
   amino acid substitutions departs from neutrality, suggesting local
   adaptation and/or polymorphism-based local selection.},

Abstract = {One of the most widely European farmed mollusc, the mussel Mytilus sp.,
   has been subjected to massive mortalities located in Charente-Maritime
   (France) in spring 2014. The national surveillance network for mollusc
   health has reported a systematic detection of V. splendidus in all dying
   batches. V. splendidus is the type species of a clade composed of almost
   20 known strains with variable pathogenicity on bivalves. In our study,
   we first developed a Multi Locus Sequence Analysis (MLSA), specific to
   V. splendidus group, based on fragments of 5 housekeeping genes: atpA,
   ftsZ, mreB, rpoD and topA. This toolwas validated on reference strains
   and compared with individual gene analyses. It allowed a useful and
   reliable classification of V. splendidus closely-related strains. Thanks
   to MLSA, we then tried to classify genetically 23 strains isolated from
   healthy or dying mussels. 21 were classified within the Splendidus
   clade: in splendidus cluster (38\%), in tasmaniensis cluster (24\%), in
   artabrorum cluster (24\%) and on distinct branches (14\%). All of them
   were tested by injection to healthy adult mussels to identify possible
   pathogenic strains. Experimental trials revealed the presence of a
   strain called M3H, allied with the splendidus cluster and able to induce
   mortality in mussels with rates up to 80\%. The M3H virulence was
   demonstrated by the recovery of the injected strain in dying animals,
   resulting from repeated experimental infections. Further work should be
   now conducted to explore the pathogenicity of the M3H strain towards
   different mussel batches and under various conditions.
   Statement of relevance: Our MLSA is useful to identify related V.

Abstract = {Ehrlichiosis and Q fever caused by the intracellular bacteria Ehrlichia
   canis and Coxiella burnetii, respectively, are tick-borne diseases with
   zoonotic potential and widespread geographical distribution. This study
   investigated the prevalence of both infections in wild mammals in
   southern Italy. Tissue samples obtained from the red fox (Vulpes
   vulpes), European badger (Meles meles), gray wolf (Canis lupus), beech
   marten (Martes foina), and crested porcupine (Hystrix cristata) were
   processed for molecular detection of both pathogens. E. canis was
   detected in 55 out of 105 (52 \%) red foxes and three out of six gray
   wolves. Four sequence types were identified, three of which were found
   in the spleen and liver samples of red foxes and wolves, and one in the
   kidney of a red fox. None of the examined mammals was positive to C.
   burnetii type. This represents the first report of E. canis in
   free-ranging wolves worldwide, as well as the first evidence of this
   pathogen in red foxes in the peninsular Italy. Our results suggest that
   E. canis infection is common in free-ranging canids in southern Italy
   and that a sylvatic life cycle of this pathogen may occur.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: to assess concentration levels of dioxins, PCBs, and
   chemical elements in sheep milk produced in areas close to the Italian
   contaminated site (CS) located in the North-West of Sardinia (Southern
   Italy), named ``Aree industriali di Porto Torres e discarica di
   Calancoi{''} (i.e., industrial areas of Porto Torres and landfill of
   Calancoi).
   DESIGN: monitoring plan of environmental contaminants on zootechnical
   productions based on analysis of dioxins, PCBs, heavy metals (Cd, Hg,
   Pb), and other elements (As, Be, Cr, Ni, Tl, Zn) in sheep bulk milk.
   SETING AND PARTICIPANTS: 60 samples of sheep bulk milk were collected in
   rural farms where animals were fed mainly with forage and feed produced
   in the CS: 30 samples from farms located near the industrial area of
   Porto Torres and 30 taken from farms spread out the landfill area of
   Calancoi, a former waste dump in the East of Sassari city.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: the concentration levels of target substances
   were determined and compared to legal thresholds fixed on EU
   regulations.
   RESULTS: concentrations of target substances in all samples were below
   the maximum limits set by EU regulations. Dioxins and DL-PCBs (expressed
   as the sum) were in the range 0.20-1.30 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat, NDL-PCB (sum
   of the six marker congeners) were in the range 0.50-7.50 ng/g, while
   concentrations of all heavy metals were not detectable or were near the
   limit of quantitation of the method. Undetectable concentrations were
   also observed for the toxic elements beryllium and thallium.
   CONCLUSIONS: concentration levels of micro-pollutants in milk samples
   were significantly lower than the legal thresholds. Concentrations and
   congener profiles showed no relevant differences compared to milk
   samples from areas with low environmental impact, therefore consumption
   of milk from the studied area do not produce a higher intake of
   contaminants respect to the regional milk. The results of this study do
   not make the resident population safe from health risks caused by
   critical issue of the CS, but provide information limited to the safety
   of the milk from these areas, without showing peculiar contamination and
   hazard for food from local sheep farms.},

Abstract = {The illegal use of pharmacologically active compounds for growth
   promotion in food-producing species poses risks for consumer health and
   animal welfare. Surveillance relies on the quantification of drug
   residues in animal fluids or tissues, but the efficacy can be negatively
   affected due to undetectable residual concentrations in biological
   matrices. Consequently, techniques focusing on the indirect biological
   effects of exogenous compound administration have been proposed as more
   sensitive detection methods. The purpose of the present study is to
   develop a tandem mass spectrometry analytical method based on low-energy
   collision-induced dissociation (CID-MS/MS) using multiple reaction
   monitoring (MRM) for the quantification of 12 potential protein markers
   of skeletal muscle to detect anabolic treatments with dexamethasone.
   Protein markers identified in a previous study applying a 2D-DIGE
   proteomics approach have been quantified using the signature peptide
   method. A group of proteins were confirmed as reliable markers.
   Quantitative results enabled a predictive model to be defined based on
   logistic regression for the detection of treated animals. The developed
   model was finally cross-validated in an independent animal set.},

Abstract = {ObjectivesThe osseointegration process replaces the surgically damaged
   bone with newly formed bone in contact to the implant surface. This
   involves some loss of primary stability, which will continue until new
   bone is formed providing a new stability, known as secondary stability.
   A direct measurement of secondary implant stability appears fundamental
   to determine the period and modalities for implant loading. The aim of
   this study was to validate the measurement of the implant micromotion to
   test secondary implant stability.
   Materials and MethodsTwenty-four 3.8x11.5mm implants (Dynamix, Cortex,
   Shlomi, Israel) were inserted in sheep iliac crests. The animals were
   sacrificed after 2months, and the freshly retrieved bone blocks were
   immediately fixed on a customized device to calculate the value of
   actual micromotion (VAM) according to a previously described technique.
   Implant stability quotient (ISQ) values, reverse torque value (RTV),
   \%bone-to-implant contact (\%BIC), bone volume percentage (\%BV) and
   crestal bone loss (CBL) were also calculated for each implant.
   Statistical correlations between VAM and the other parameters were
   calculated.
   ResultsData correlation analysis between the examined parameters showed
   that VAM significantly correlates (P<0.05) to RTV, \%BIC, ISQ and CBL.
   ConclusionsAs VAM showed to be statistical correlated to the other
   parameters of osseointegration, it may be used to clinically check the
   amount of implant osseointegration, secondary stability and CBL. Future
   studies are needed to confirm these results moreover. An instrument to
   measure VAM in the oral cavity still needs to be developed.},

Title = {Isolation of a Defective Prion Mutant from Natural Scrapie},
Journal = {PLOS PATHOGENS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {It is widely known that prion strains can mutate in response to
   modification of the replication environment and we have recently
   reported that prion mutations can occur in vitro during amplification of
   vole-adapted prions by Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification on bank
   vole substrate (bvPMCA). Here we exploited the high efficiency of prion
   replication by bvPMCA to study the in vitro propagation of natural
   scrapie isolates. Although in vitro vole-adapted PrPSc conformers were
   usually similar to the sheep counterpart, we repeatedly isolated a PrPSc
   mutant exclusively when starting from extremely diluted seeds of a
   single sheep isolate. The mutant and faithful PrPSc conformers showed to
   be efficiently autocatalytic in vitro and were characterized by
   different PrP protease resistant cores, spanning aa similar to 155-231
   and similar to 80-231 respectively, and by different conformational
   stabilities. The two conformers could thus be seen as different bona
   fide PrPSc types, putatively accounting for prion populations with
   different biological properties. Indeed, once inoculated in bank vole
   the faithful conformer was competent for in vivo replication while the
   mutant was unable to infect voles, de facto behaving like a defective
   prion mutant. Overall, our findings confirm that prions can adapt and
   evolve in the new replication environments and that the starting
   population size can affect their evolutionary landscape, at least in
   vitro. Furthermore, we report the first example of ``authentic{''}
   defective prion mutant, composed of brain-derived PrPC and originating
   from a natural scrapie isolate. Our results clearly indicate that the
   defective mutant lacks of some structural characteristics, that
   presumably involve the central region similar to 90-155, critical for
   infectivity but not for in vitro replication. Finally, we propose a
   molecular mechanism able to account for the discordant in vitro and in
   vivo behavior, suggesting possible new paths for investigating the
   molecular bases of prion infectivity.},

Title = {Aflatoxin B-1 contamination in feed from Puglia and Basilicata regions

Journal = {MYCOTOXIN RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {32},
Number = {4},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {During a 5-year period from 2010 to 2014, n = 919 samples of feed and
   raw materials were analyzed for aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) contamination
   using accredited ELISA screening methods. Only 0.76 \% of these samples
   were non-compliant with maximum levels set by the European Union
   Regulation 32/2002. Non-compliant samples were mainly from the province
   of Bari (n = 3 samples, mean AFB(1) value 7.03 mu g/kg), although the
   highest AFB(1) levels were found in two samples from the provinces of
   Foggia and Brindisi, at 32.6 +/- 3.6 mu g/kg and 31.0 +/- 4.0 mu g/kg,
   respectively. Mean AFB(1) levels in samples contaminated but compliant
   with the limits ranged from 1.4 to 2.2 mu g/kg. Considering the great
   importance of climate conditions in mycotoxins production, during crops
   production and during the critical phases of materials storage and/or
   transport, to better understand the variability in contamination levels,
   the analytical results were reviewed in term of temperature and relative
   environmental humidity in the sampling areas. Correlations between
   aflatoxin B-1 levels in feed and these climate factors might explain
   seasonal and annual variations in contamination levels. The data from
   the present study provide useful suggestions for the organization of
   targeted monitoring plans and the protection of consumers, as well as
   for improvement in the quality standards of zootechnological activities
   and feed industry.},

Title = {Development of a Droplet Digital Polymerase Chain Reaction for Rapid and
   Simultaneous Identification of Common Food borne Pathogens in Soft
   Cheese},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Month = {OCT 28},
Abstract = {Dairy products can harbor various microorganisms (e.g., Campylobacter
   spp., Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, verocytotoxin-producing
   Escherichia coli) arising from animal reservoirs, and which can become
   important sources of foodborne illness. Therefore, early detection of
   food pathogens is crucial to prevent diseases. We wished to develop an
   accurate quantitative protocol based on a droplet digital polymerase
   chain reaction (ddPCR) involving eight individual TaqMan (TM) reactions
   to detect simultaneously, without selective enrichment, Listeria spp.,
   L. monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., verocytotoxin-producing E. coli and
   Campylobacter spp. in cheese. ddPCR (a ``third-generation PCR{''})
   provides absolute quantification of target DNAs without requirement of a
   standard curve, which simplifies experimentation and data comparability.
   The accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of the developed ddPCR system
   were assessed using purified DNA from 50 reference pathogenic and
   non-pathogenic strains from international or Italian collections and
   analyzing soft cheese samples artificially contaminated with serial
   dilutions (from 4 x 10(6) to 4 x 10(1) CFU/g) of pure cultures from the
   American Type Culture Collection. Finally, the performance of our ddPCR
   system was compared by parallel testing with quantitative PCR: it gave
   higher sensitivity (10(2) CFU/g for the Listeria spp. assay) without the
   necessity of a standard curve. In conclusion, this is the first ddPCR
   system developed for simultaneous detection of common foodborne
   pathogens in cheese using a single set of amplification conditions. As
   such, it could become a useful strategy for high-throughput screening of
   microorganisms to evaluate the quality and safety of food products.},

   fish, humans and marine mammals. In this study, a Multilocus Sequence

   pnt, pyrC, and toxR) was developed to better understand the PDD
   population structure and used to type 73 PDD isolates from cetaceans,
   mainly striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) involved in mortality
   episodes, and from a few marine chelonians. Five reference ATCC strains
   were also included in the study. Typing allowed the discrimination of
   groups of PDD strains isolated from different host species, at different
   times and from different geographic areas, suggesting that a clonal PDD

Title = {Evaluation of three enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for sarcoptic
   mange diagnosis and assessment in the Iberian ibex, Capra pyrenaica},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Month = {OCT 21},
Abstract = {Background: Sarcoptic mange is a contagious skin disease caused by the
   mite Sarcoptes scabiei, affecting different mammalian species worldwide
   including the Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica), in which mortalities over
   90 \% of the population have been reported. No efficient diagnostic
   methods are available for this disease, particularly when there are low
   mite numbers and mild or no clinical signs. In this study, three
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) developed for dog (ELISA A),
   Cantabrian chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica parva) (ELISA B) and Alpine
   chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) (ELISA C), were evaluated to detect
   specific antibodies (IgG) to sarcoptic mange in Iberian ibex sera.
   Methods: Serum samples from 131 Iberian ibexes (86 healthy and 45
   scabietic) were collected from 2005 to 2012 in the Sierra Nevada Natural
   and National Parks (southern Spain). Based on visual inspection, ibexes
   were classified into one of three categories, namely healthy (without
   scabietic compatible lesions), mildly affected (skin lesions over less
   than 50 \% of the body surface) and severely affected (skin lesions over
   more than 50 \% of the body surface). The optimal cut-off point,
   specificity, sensitivity and the area under the curve (AUC) were
   calculated, and the agreement between tests was determined. Moreover,
   differences in the optical density (OD) related to scabies severity have
   been evaluated for the best test.
   Results: ELISA C showed better performance than the two other tests,
   reaching higher values of sensitivity (93.0 \%) and specificity (93.5
   \%) against the visual estimation of the percentage of affected skin,
   chosen as the gold standard. Significantly higher concentrations of
   specific antibodies were observed with this test in the mildly and
   severely infested ibexes than in healthy ones.
   Conclusions: Our results revealed that ELISA C was an optimal test to
   diagnose sarcoptic mange in the Iberian ibex. Further studies
   characterizing immune response during the course of the disease,
   including spontaneous or drug induced recovery, should follow in order
   to better understand sarcoptic mange in Iberian ibex populations.},

Title = {Effectiveness of Washing Procedures in Reducing Salmonella enterica and
   Listeria monocytogenes on a Raw Leafy Green Vegetable (Eruca vesicaria)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {Vegetables are an important source of nutrients, but they can host a
   large microbial population, particularly bacteria. Foodborne pathogens
   can contaminate raw vegetables at any stage of their production process
   with a potential for human infection. Appropriate washing can mitigate
   the risk of foodborne illness consequent to vegetable consumption by
   reducing pathogen levels, but few data are available to assess the
   efficacy of different practices. In the present work, six different
   washing methods, in the presence or absence of sanitisers (peracetic
   acid and percitric acid, sodium bicarbonate, sodium hypochlorite) and
   vinegar, were tested for their effectiveness in reducing Salmonella and
   Listeria counts after artificial contamination of raw rocket (Eruca
   vesicaria). Results showed that washing with sodium hypochlorite (200
   mg/L) was the only method able to produce a significant 2 Log reduction
   of Salmonella counts, but only in the case of high initial contamination
   (7 Log CFU/g), suggesting potential harmful effects for consumers could
   occur. In the case of Listeria rnonocytogenes, all the examined washing
   methods were effective, with 200 mg/L sodium hypochlorite solution and a
   solution of peracetic and percitric acids displaying the best
   performances (2 and 1.5 Log reductions, respectively). This highlights
   the importance of targeting consumers on fit for purpose and safe
   washing practices to circumvent vegetable contamination by foodborne
   pathogens.},

Title = {Resistance to Biocides in Listeria monocytogenes Collected in
   Meat-Processing Environments},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Month = {OCT 19},
Abstract = {The emergence of microorganisms exerting resistance to biocides is a
   challenge to meat-processing environments. Bacteria can be intrinsically
   resistant to biocides but resistance can also be acquired by adaptation
   to their sub-lethal concentrations. Moreover, the presence of biocide
   resistance determinants, which is closely linked to antibiotic
   resistance determinants, could lead to co-selection during disinfection
   practices along the food chain, and select cross-resistant foodborne
   pathogens. The purpose of this work was to test the resistance of wild
   strains of Listeria monocytogenes, isolated from pork meat processing
   plants, toward benzalkonium chloride (BC), used as proxy of quaternary
   ammonium compounds. Furthermore, the expression of two non-specific
   efflux pumps genes (Ide and mdrL) under biocide exposure was evaluated.
   L. monocytogenes were isolated from five processing plants located in
   the Veneto region (northeast of Italy) before and after cleaning and
   disinfection (C\&D) procedures. A total of 45 strains were collected: 36
   strains before and nine after the C\&D procedures. Collected strains
   were typed according to MLST and ERIC profiles. Strains sampled in the
   same site, isolated before, and after the C\&D procedures and displaying
   the same MLST and ERIC profiles were tested for their sensitivity to
   different concentrations of BC, in a time course assay. The expression
   of non-specific efflux pumps was evaluated at each time point by qPCR
   using tufA gene as housekeeping. A differential expression of the two
   investigated genes was observed: Ide was found to be more expressed by
   the strains isolated before C\&D procedures while its expression was
   dose-dependent in the case of the post C\&D procedures strain. On the
   contrary, the expression of mdrL was inhibited under low biocidal stress
   (10 ppm BC) and enhanced in the presence of high stress (100 ppm BC).
   These findings suggests a possible role for C\&D procedures to select L.
   monocytogenes persisters, pointing out the importance of dealing with
   the identification of risk factors in food plants sanification
   procedures that might select more tolerant strains.},

Abstract = {Yersiniosis is the third most common reported zoonoses in Europe, with
   Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis responsible for 98.66\% and
   0.94\% of the confirmed human cases in 2013. From June 2013 to October
   2014, 201 pigs at slaughter belonging to 67 batches were tested for Y.
   enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis in tonsils. Diaphragm muscle
   samples were tested for antibodies against Yersinia by a commercially
   available ELISA test. Y. enterocolitica 4/O:3 was detected in 55/201 pig
   tonsils (27.4\%; 95\% CI 23.1-37.1). The positive pigs came from 38/67
   batches (56.7\%) and were reared in 36/61 farms (59.0\%). There was no
   statistical difference between farrow-to-finish and finishing farms. The
   mean count of Y. enterocolitica was 3.56 +/- 0.85 log(10) CFU/g with a
   minimum of 2.0 log(10) CFU/g and a maximum of 4.78 log(10) CFU/g. Y.
   pseudotuberculosis was isolated from 4/201 pig tonsils (2.0\%; 95\% Cl
   0.0-4.5). Three isolates belonged to serotype O:3 and one to serotype
   O:1. The positive pigs belonged to 4/67 batches (6.0\%) and came from
   finishing farms only. Y. pseudotuberculosis could be enumerated in one
   sample only (4.27 log(10) CFU/g). The ELISA test demonstrated that
   56.1\% of the meat juice samples were positive for Yersinia antibodies.
   Serological positivity was found in 67.9\% (36/53) of the Y.
   enterocolitica- and 75.0\% (3/4) of the Y. pseudotuberculosis positive
   pigs. A significant association was found between serological results
   and the presence of Y. enterocolitica in tonsils (OR = 1.97, p = 0.044).
   All the Y. enterocolitica 4/O:3 isolates were susceptible to
   amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, gentamicin, ceftazidime, ertapenem and
   meropenem, 94.5\% to cefotaxime, 89.1\% to kanamycin and 78.2\% to
   tetracycline. The highest resistance rates were observed for ampicillin
   (100\%), sulphonamides (982\%) and streptomycin (782\%). Y. pseudo
   tuberculosis strains were sensitive to all the antimicrobials tested,
   i.e. amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, azithromycin,
   cephalothin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid,
   sulphonamide, tetracycline and ticarcillin.
   The study shows that Italian fattening pigs are frequently infected with
   human pathogenic Y. enterocolitica 4/O:3. Although the isolation rate is
   slightly lower than in other European countries, the serological test
   demonstrates that the infection is widespread among pig population. In
   fact, seroprevalence is similar to other EU countries. The detection of
   Y. pseudotuberculosis serotypes O:1 and O:3 in pig tonsils is of
   concern. Since tonsils may represent a contamination source for pig meat
   at slaughter, further studies regarding human infections by both
   microbial species are strongly recommended. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The concentrations of 14 essential and nonessential trace elements were
   determined in fish from Lake Tshangalele, Katanga province, Democratic
   Republic of Congo. This province has been a place of intensive mining
   activities for centuries, which have increased in recent years, due to
   the use of metals such as copper and cobalt for the industries of
   fast-growing countries.
   Lake Tshangalele, which receives effluents from metallurgical and mining
   plants in Likasi, is home to several fish species that are an important
   part of the diet of the local population, and, therefore, it constitutes
   a relevant site for documenting the human exposure to metals as a result
   of a fish diet.
   The highest concentrations (median levels, dry weight) of cobalt (7.25
   mg kg(-1)), copper (88.1 mg kg(-1)), iron (197.5 mg kg(-1)), manganese
   (65.35 mg kg(-1)), zinc (122.9 mg kg(-1)) and aluminum (135.4 mg kg(-1))
   were found in fish collected closest to the copper mining plant, with
   decreasing concentrations along the lake, up to the dam. In the most
   contaminated fish samples, values of up to 270.1 mg kg(-1) for Al, 173.1
   mg kg(-1) for Cu, 220.9 mg kg(-1) for Zn, 211.0 mg kg(-1) for Mn, 324.2
   mg kg(-1) for Fe, 15.1 mg kg(-1) for Co, 4.2 mg kg(-1) for Cr, 1.6 mg
   kg(-1) for Cd, 1.9 mg kg(-1) for Pb, and 1.8 mg kg(-1) for Ni were
   found.
   Metal contamination from mining activity resulted in being of great
   concern because of potential health risks to the local inhabitants due
   to the consumption of heavily contaminated fish.
   Capsule: High levels of metals, especially cobalt, aluminum, iron,
   manganese, zinc and cadmium were found in fish from Tshangalele water
   system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Avian influenza viruses affect both poultry production and public
   health. A subtype H5N8 (clade 2.3.4.4) virus, following an outbreak in
   poultry in South Korea in January 2014, rapidly spread worldwide in
   2014-2015. Our analysis of H5N8 viral sequences, epidemiological
   investigations, waterfowl migration, and poultry trade showed that
   long-distance migratory birds can play a major role in the global spread
   of avian influenza viruses. Further, we found that the hemagglutinin of
   clade 2.3.4.4 virus was remarkably promiscuous, creating reassortants
   with multiple neuraminidase subtypes. Improving our understanding of the
   circumpolar circulation of avian influenza viruses in migratory
   waterfowl will help to provide early warning of threats from avian
   influenza to poultry, and potentially human, health.},

Abstract = {Arboviruses cause acute diseases that increasingly affect global health.
   We used bluetongue virus (BTV) and its natural sheep host to reveal a
   previously uncharacterized mechanism used by an arbovirus to manipulate
   host immunity. Our study shows that BTV, similarly to other antigens
   delivered through the skin, is transported rapidly via the lymph to the
   peripheral lymph nodes. Here, BTV infects and disrupts follicular
   dendritic cells, hindering B-cell division in germinal centers, which
   results in a delayed production of high affinity and virus neutralizing
   antibodies. Moreover, the humoral immune response to a second antigen is
   also hampered in BTV-infected animals. Thus, an arbovirus can evade the
   host antiviral response by inducing an acute immunosuppression. Although
   transient, this immunosuppression occurs at the critical early stages of
   infection when a delayed host humoral immune response likely affects
   virus systemic dissemination and the clinical outcome of disease.},

Abstract = {Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of acute hepatitis worldwide.
   Genotypes 1 and 2 are restricted to humans, whereas genotypes 3 and 4
   also occur in animals and are recognized as zoonotic pathogens. In this
   study, by screening goat faecal samples collected from six small farms
   located in the province of Teramo (Abruzzo region, Italy), HEV RNA was
   found with an overall prevalence of 9.2\% (11/119). Upon sequence
   analysis of a 0.8 kb portion of the ORF2 gene, four strains were grouped
   with animal and human genotype 3 HEVs, subtype c, with the highest match
   (94.2-99.4\% nt identity) to a wild boar strain, WB/P6-15/ITA,
   identified in the same geographical area in which the six goat farms
   were located. Further investigations are needed in order to assess if
   goat may represent an additional active host for HEV. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {In 2012 a US multistate outbreak of listeriosis was linked to ricotta
   salata imported from Italy, made from pasteurized sheep's milk. Sampling
   activities were conducted in Italy to trace the source of Listeria
   monocytogenes contamination. The cheese that caused the outbreak was
   produced in a plant in Apulia that processed semi-finished cheeses
   supplied by five plants in Sardinia. During an `emergency sampling', 179
   (236\%) out of 758 end-products tested positive for L. monocytogenes,
   with concentrations from <10 c.f.u./g to 11 x 10(6) c.f.u./g. Positive
   processing environment samples were found in two out of four processing
   plants. A `follow-up sampling' was conducted 8 months later, when
   environmental samples from three out of six plants tested positive for
   L. monocytogenes and for Listeria spp. PFGE subtyping showed 100\%
   similarity between US clinical strains and isolates from ricotta salata,
   confirming the origin of the outbreak. The persistence of strains in
   environmental niches of processing plants was demonstrated, and is
   probably the cause of product contamination. Two PFGE profiles from
   clinical cases of listeriosis in Italy in 2011, stored in the MSS-TESSy
   database, were found to have 100\% similarity to one PFGE profile from a
   US clinical case associated with the consumption of ricotta salata,
   according to the US epidemiological investigation (sample C, pulsotype
   17). However, they had 87\% similarity to the only PFGE profile found
   both in the US clinical case and in 14 ricotta cheese samples collected
   during the emergency sampling (sample B, pulsotype 1). Sharing of
   molecular data and availability of common characterization protocols
   were key elements that connected the detection of the US outbreak to the
   investigation of the food source in Italy. Simultaneous surveillance
   systems at both food and human levels are a necessity for the efficient
   rapid discovery of the source of an outbreak of L. monocytogenes.},

Abstract = {The high complexity of glycome, the repertoire of glycans expressed in a
   cell or in an organism, is difficult to analyze and the use of new
   technologies has accelerated the progress of glycomics analysis. In the
   last decade, the microarray approaches, and in particular glycan and
   lectin microarrays, have provided new insights into evaluation of cell
   glycosylation status. Here we present a cell microarray method based on
   cell printing on microarray slides for the analysis of the glycosylation
   pattern of the cell glycocalyx. In order to demonstrate the reliability
   of the developed method, the glycome profiles of equine native
   uncultured mural granulosa cells (uGCs) and in vitro cultured mural
   granulosa cells (cGCs) were determined and compared. The method consists
   in the isolation of GCs, cell printing into arrays on microarray slide,
   incubation with a panel of biotinylated lectins, reaction with
   fluorescent streptavidin and signal intensity detection by a microarray
   scanner. Cell microarray technology revealed that glycocalyx of both
   uGCs and cGCs contains N-glycans, sialic acid terminating glycans,
   N-acetylglucosamine and O-glycans. The comparison of uGCs and cGCs
   glycan signals indicated an increase in the expression of sialic acids,
   Nacetylglucosamine, and N-glycans in cGCs. Glycan profiles determined by
   cell microarray agreed with those revealed by lectin histochemistry. The
   described cell microarray method represents a simple and sensitive
   procedure to analyze cell surface glycome in mammalian cells.},

Abstract = {Hepatic lipidosis is the most diffused hepatic disease in the lactating
   cow. A new methodology to estimate the degree of fatty infiltration of
   the liver in lactating cows by means of texture analysis of B-mode
   ultrasound images is proposed. B-mode ultrasonography of the liver was
   performed in 48 Holstein Friesian cows using standardized ultrasound
   parameters. Liver biopsies to determine the triacylglycerol content of
   the liver (TAG(qa)) were obtained from each animal. A large number of
   texture parameters were calculated on the ultrasound images by means of
   a free software. Based on the TAG content of the liver, 29 samples were
   classified as mild (TAG(qa) < 50 mg/g), 6 as moderate (50 mg/g < TAG(qa)
   > 100 mg/g) and 13 as severe (TAG > 100 mg/g) in steatosis. Stepwise
   linear regression analysis was performed to predict the TAG(qa) content
   of the liver (TAGpred) from the texture parameters calculated on the
   ultrasound images. A five-variable model was used to predict the TAG
   content from the ultrasound images. The regression model explained
   83.4\% of the variance. An area under the curve (AUC) of 0.949 was
   calculated for <50 mg/g vs >50 mg/g of TAG(qa); using an optimal cut-off
   value of 72 mg/g TAG(pred) had a sensitivity of 86.2\% and a specificity
   of 84.2\%. An AUC of 0.978 for <100 mg/g vs >100 mg/g of TAG(qa) was
   calculated; using an optimal cut-off value of 89 mg/g, TAG(pred)
   sensitivity was 92.3\% and specificity was 88.6\%. Texture analysis of B
   mode ultrasound images may therefore be used to accurately predict the
   TAG content of the liver in lactating cows. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {In August 2008, after 10 years of apparent silence, West Nile virus
   (WNV) infection re-emerged in northern Italy, spreading through the
   territories of three regions. In the following years, new cases occurred
   in the same area and additional foci of infection were observed in
   central and southern Italy, involving also Sicily and Sardinia islands.
   The Italian Ministry of Health ordered to test by RT-PCR all blood and
   organ donors from 15th June to 15th November of each year in the
   infected areas. The period at risk of WNV transmission was defined on
   the basis of literature data, but a more scientific estimation of the
   transmission season, under Italian circumstances, needs to be performed.
   A transitional model previously developed by other Authors was applied
   and adapted to Italian circumstances, to describe and quantify the WNV
   transmission cycle between birds and mosquitoes. Culex spp. was
   considered the main vector, and mosquito parameters were adapted to this
   genus. Magpies (Pica pica) were considered the main bird host. The model
   was partially validated through the results of the entomological surveys
   carried out in central Italy and in Po Valley. The results of the
   transitional model permitted to calculate the basic reproduction number
   (R-0) during 2010 for the whole Italian territory at 1 km of spatial
   resolution, estimating the risk of WNV transmission during the year and
   creating detailed risk maps for Italy. The mean values of R-0 for the
   whole Italy varied between 0.4 and 4.8, with values >1 from the end of
   May to the middle of September. The coastal and flat zones of Italy
   showed the highest R-0 values. Although partially validated, the model
   showed a substantial acceptable capacity of defining the period at major
   risk of WNV transmission in Italy, helping Public health authorities in
   the application of appropriate and timely control and preventive
   measures.},

Abstract = {Mycobacterium microti has recently been described as the causative agent
   of tuberculosis-like lesions in wild boar (Sus scrofa), a reservoir
   specie of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) in some European
   Mediterranean ecosystem. Through a five-year survey on tuberculosis in
   free-living wild boars, the epidemiological trend of M. microti
   infections and the host and population risk factors linked with its
   occurrence were described. Retropharyngeal and mandibular lymph nodes of
   3041 hunted wild boars from six different districts were macroscopically
   inspected. The sex and age of each animal were registered, as well as
   the animal abundance in each district. Lesions compatible with
   tuberculosis (190) were collected and analysed using a gyrB PCR-RFLP
   assay. M. microti was identified directly in 99 tissue samples (Prev =
   3.26\%; 95\% CI: 2.67-3.97\%), while neither Mycobacterium bovis, nor
   other members of the MTBC were detected. The probability of being M.
   microti positive showed spatio-temporal variability, with 26\% of
   increase of risk of being infected for each year. Moreover, a positive
   effect of wild boar abundance and age on the prevalence was detected.
   The generalized increase in the European wild boar population, coupled
   with its sensitivity to M. microti infection, poses a future concern for
   the identification and management of MTBC members in wild boar.},

Abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is the most important causative agent of
   subclinical mastitis in cattle resulting in reduced milk production and
   quality. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains has a clear
   zoonotic relevance, especially in the case of occupational exposure. The
   aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of S. aureus and MRSA in
   bulk tank milk (BTM) from dairy cattle herds in the Lombardy Region
   (Northern Italy) and to identify the main MRSA circulating genotypes.
   MRSA strains were characterized by susceptibility testing, multi-locus
   sequence typing (MLST), spa typing and SCCmec typing. A total 844 BTM
   samples were analysed and S. aureus and MRSA were detected in 47.2\% and
   3.8\% of dairy herds, respectively. MLST showed that the majority
   (28/32) of isolates belonged to the typical livestock-associated
   lineages: ST398, ST97 and ST1. Interestingly, in this study we report
   for the first time the new ST3211, a single locus variant of ST(CC) 22,
   with the newly described 462 aroE allele. Our study indicates high
   diffusion of S. aureus mastitis and low, but not negligible, prevalence
   of MRSA in the considered area, suggesting the need for planning
   specific control programmes for bovine mastitis caused by S. aureus,
   especially when MRSA is implicated.},

   ruminants virus (PPRV) vaccine. Three unvaccinated goats were kept as
   controls. After 36 days, the four goats were revaccinated. The immune
   response was monitored by virus neutralization test showing that two
   doses of the vaccine were able to stimulate strong immune response in
   all the vaccinated animals. The vaccinated goat and the controls were
   challenged with virulent PPRV intranasally. After PPRV challenge, the
   three control goats showed fever, viremia and virus excretion through
   mucosal surfaces, whereas the vaccinated goats were fully protected
   against PPRV infection and replication.},

Title = {Review: A review on classical and atypical scrapie in caprine: Prion
   protein gene polymorphisms and their role in the disease},
Journal = {ANIMAL},

Abstract = {Scrapie is a naturally occurring transmissible spongiform encephalopathy
   in sheep and goat. It has been known for similar to 250 years and is
   characterised by the accumulation of an abnormal isoform of a
   host-encoded prion protein that leads to progressive neurodegeneration
   and death. Scrapie is recognised in two forms, classical and atypical
   scrapie. The susceptibility to both types of scrapie is influenced by
   polymorphisms of the prion protein gene (PRNP). Sheep susceptibility or
   resistance to classical scrapie is strongly regulated by the
   polymorphisms at codons 136, 154 and 171 of the PRNP. The genetic role
   in atypical scrapie in sheep has been defined by polymorphisms at codons
   141, 154 and 171, which are associated with different degrees of risk in
   the occurrence of the ovine disease. Progress has been achieved in the
   prevention of scrapie in sheep due to efficient genetic breeding
   programmes based on eradication and control of the disease. In Europe,
   the success of these programmes has been verified by applying
   eradication and genetic selection plans. In general terms, the ovine
   selection plans aim to eliminate and reduce the susceptible allele and
   to enrich the resistant allele ARR. During outbreaks all susceptible
   animals are slaughtered, only ARR/ARR resistant rams and sheep and
   semi-resistant females are preserved. In the occurrence of scrapie
   positive goats a complete cull of the flock (stamping out) is performed
   with great economic loss and severe risk of extinction for the
   endangered breeds. The ability to select scrapie-resistant animals
   allows to define new breeding strategies aimed to boost genetic progress
   while reducing costs during scrapie outbreaks. Allelic variants of PRNP
   can be protective for caprine scrapie, and the knowledge of their
   distribution in goats has become very important. Over the past few
   years, the integration of genetic information on goat populations could
   be used to make selection decisions, commonly referred to as genetic
   selection. The objective of this review was to summarise the main
   findings of polymorphisms of the caprine prion protein (PrP) gene and to
   discuss the possible application of goat breeding schemes integrating
   genetic selection, with their relative advantages and limitations.},

Abstract = {The clinical features and economic impact of the infection caused by an
   emerging group of pestiviruses, namely HoBi-like pestivirus, in a cattle
   herd of southern Italy are reported. In 2011, the virus was first
   associated with respiratory disease, causing an abortion storm after 1
   year and apparently disappearing for the following 3 years after
   persistently infected calves were slaughtered. However, in 2014,
   reproductive failures and acute gastroenteritis were observed in the
   same herd, leading to a marked decrease of productivity. A HoBi-like
   strain closely related to that responsible for previous outbreaks was
   detected in several animals. Application of an intensive eradication
   programme, based on the detection and slaughtering of HoBi-like
   pestivirus persistently infected animals, resulted in a marked
   improvement of the productive performances.},

Abstract = {Hepatitis E virus (HEV) was detected in stools collected from wild boars
   in Italy, with an overall prevalence of 1.5 \% (3/196). The sequence of
   a similar to 3.0-kb portion at the 3' end of the genome of one such
   strain, HEV/WB/P6-15/ITA, was determined. In the full-length ORF2, which
   encodes the capsid protein, the virus was genetically closest to wild
   boar and human HEV strains currently classified as genotype 3 subtype c.
   Interestingly, the 3' end of ORF2 of the WB/P6-15/ITA matched the
   340-nucleotide (nt) sequence (94.0 \% nt identity) of the human strain
   PeGe, identified in 2015 from a patient with acute hepatitis E in Genoa,
   Italy, suggesting that similar HEV strains are circulating in the same
   geographical setting in humans and animals.},

Abstract = {Feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) is a widespread cat pathogen inducing
   rhinitis, conjunctivitis and corneal ulcers. To alleviate acute
   FHV-1-induced disease, antiviral agents are used often with antibiotics.
   But sometimes, these treatments, as well as conventional doses of
   cytokines have moderate efficacy and/or collateral effects. Herein we
   have investigated the effects of low dose interleukin (IL)-12 plus
   interferon (IFN)-gamma, prepared by Sequential Kinetic Activated (SKA),
   on the treatment of FHV-1 infection. Twenty-five, unvaccinated
   FHV-1-positive cats were recruited into a prospective, randomized,
   placebo controlled, double-blinded clinical trial. Fifteen cats were
   treated for 6 months with oral low doses of SKA IL-12 plus IFN-gamma and
   10 cats were treated with placebo. At 1, 6 and 12 months (follow-up)
   after the beginning of treatment, clinical assessment, PCR assay and
   blood count were carried out. At follow-up, in treated group, we
   observed significant (p < 0.05) improvements in clinical signs and PCR
   became negative in 12/15 cats (80\%). In placebo, 10/10 cats were
   PCR-positive, with improvements (30\%) or worsening (70\%) in clinical
   signs. Blood values were normal in both groups. Our results show that
   the low dose therapy, based on activated solutions of IL-12 plus
   IFN-gamma, represents a novel approach to treat FHV-1 infection in cats.

   Lactobacillus acidophilus, while the B group was fed the same diet
   supplemented with 0.05\% Bacillus subtilis. Data were recorded at the
   beginning (weeks 5 and 6: T1) and at the end (weeks 19 and 20: T2) of
   the experiment, and no differences in hen performance were recorded
   between dietary groups or sampling times. All of the investigated
   clinical chemistry parameters, except GGT, were affected by diet
   (p<0.05), with the best results recorded for the probiotic-treated
   groups. The immune-response values showed higher blood bactericidal
   activity in the B and L groups at T2 (p<0.05) and a lower lysozime
   concentration in the B group at T1. Higher antibody production against
   Newcastle disease virus was observed in the L group compared to the CTR
   (p=0.013). No differences in oxidative status were recorded, and no
   effects of diet on egg quality were observed. Among the physical egg
   characteristics, only the Roche scale colour was affected by diet
   (p<0.05): the egg yolk was paler in the L group. The age of the hen was
   the most relevant factor affecting physical egg characteristics. The
   chemical parameters of the egg were almost unaffected by supplementation
   with probiotics except for the lipid content, which decreased with the L
   diet (p<0.05). Both probiotic inclusions had beneficial effects on hen
   metabolism and welfare, and L.acidophilus induced the best immune
   response.},

Title = {Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat foods in Italy: Prevalence of

   products and cheese},

Abstract = {In the framework of a European Union (EU) Coordinated Monitoring
   Programme, different types of ready-to eat (RTE) products, including
   soft and semi-soft cheese (n = 398) and cooked meat products (n = 403),
   were collected at retail in Italy and tested for detection and
   enumeration of Listeria monocytogenes. An Integrative Survey of 2696
   samples, including soft and semi-soft cheese (n = 894) and cooked meat
   products (n = 1802) was carried out to have statistically representative
   results at the national level. Considering the results obtained both
   from the EU and the national Integrative Survey, prevalence of
   contamination of meat products was 1.66\% (95\% CL: 1.02-2.73\%) at the
   arrival of the samples at the laboratory and 1.92\% (95\% CL:
   1.31\%-2.82\%) at the end of shelf-life. Spalla cotta was the most
   frequently contaminated meat product. Prevalence of contamination in
   cheese was 2.13\% (95\% CL: 1.37\%-3.3\%) at the arrival at the
   laboratory and 1.01\% (95\% CL: 0.41\%-2.55\%) at the end of shelf-life.
   To get information about differences between cheese rinds and pastes,
   these two parts were separately analysed in the Integrative Survey
   samples. L. monocytogenes was detected in 4.02\% (95\% CL:
   2.60\%-6.19\%) of cheese rinds (n = 473), whereas only the 0.34\% (95\%
   CL: 0.12\%-0.98\%) of cheese pastes (n = 894) were contaminated. This
   difference was statistically significant (chi(2) = 10.026, P < 0.05).
   Gorgonzola and Taleggio were the most frequently contaminated cheeses.
   Non-compliance with EU official criteria (100 CFU/g) was reported in
   0.55\% of meat products at arrival at the laboratory, in 0.46\% at the
   end of shelf-life, and in 1.9\% of cheese rinds. PFGE showed that cheese
   rinds could have been the origin of the few pastes' contamination,
   highlighting genetic similarity between isolates found in these two
   cheese components. Genetic subtyping also showed the presence of
   different pulsotypes, usually belonging to different clusters, in
   isolates from different food types. The presence of some pulsotypes
   predominantly prevalent over the others, in products from the same
   manufacturer, could suggest environmental strains as the main source of
   contamination. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Foot-and-mouth disease viruses are often restricted to specific

   paper describes the characterization of field viruses collected from
   these cases and provides information about a new real-time RT-PCR assay
   that can be used to detect viruses from this lineage and discriminate
   them from other endemic FMD viruses that are co-circulating in North
   Africa and western Eurasia.},
