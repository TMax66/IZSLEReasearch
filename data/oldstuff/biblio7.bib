Abstract = {Notifiable avian influenza (NAI) is a listed disease of the World
   Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) that has become a disease of great
   importance both for animal and human health. Prior to 2000, vaccination
   against NAI was discouraged and used to aid control of only a limited
   number of outbreaks, without reaching the goal of eradication. Pivotal
   work on the application of a vaccination programme aimed at, and
   resulting in, eradication was carried out in Italy, and was followed by
   other research, e.g. in Hong Kong and the United States of America.
   Given the spread of Asian lineage highly pathogenic avian influenza
   (HPAI) H5N1 to three continents, vaccination is now being used on a wide
   scale under different conditions, which in most cases are not ideal.
   Although in some countries, a lack of infrastructure and resources can
   greatly limit the overall success of control programmes that encompass
   vaccination, it is imperative that international organisations set
   guidelines to `accredit' control strategies. These guidelines should
   include recommendations on seed strains to be used in vaccine
   preparations, the characteristics of the vaccine, the most appropriate
   field strategy to apply in the different phases of a control/eradication
   programme, and models of exit strategies. The availability of harmonised
   protocols would greatly facilitate the achievement of tangible results
   and would save time and avoid unnecessary wastage of resources.},

Abstract = {We developed a new recombinant enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   (rELISA) for serodiagnosis of contagious agalactia (CA), a disease
   caused by Mycoplasma agalactiae in sheep and goats. The assay is based
   on two M. agalactiae surface proteins, namely, P80 and P55.
   Identification of these immunodominant and common antigens was
   accomplished by examining the antibody response elicited in sheep during
   experimental infection and comparing it to the protein expression
   profiles of 75 M. agalactiae field strains. Our rELISA was tested with
   343 sera, collected from sheep with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of
   CA (n = 223) and from healthy animals (n = 120). All sera had previously
   been tested by Western blotting (WB) for reactivity against M.
   agalactiae. In addition, our rELISA was compared with a commercial
   routine ELISA based on inactivated antigens (CHEKiT). Among the 223
   samples that were WB positive for M. agalactiae, 209 (93.7\%) tested
   positive for rP80-P55 with our ELISA, whereas only 164 (73.8\%) tested
   positive with the CHEKiT ELISA. Among the 120 samples tested that were
   WB negative for M. agalactiae, 96.7\% were confirmed as negative with
   our rELISA, while only 75.8\% were confirmed as negative with the CHEKiT
   ELISA. A comparison of the results with receiver operating
   characteristic curves indicated that the differences observed between
   our rELISA and the CHEKiT ELISA are statistically significant. The use
   of recombinant peptides instead of inactivated antigens could
   significantly improve the discrimination of positive and negative
   animals, bringing significant advantages in controlling the
   import/export of live animals and helping in eradication of this
   economically detrimental disease.},

Abstract = {Thirty-six tortoises (Testudo hermanni) with naturally acquired oxyurids
   infections were used to assess the anthelmintic efficacy of oxfendazole
   (Dolthene (R); Merial) and fenbendazole (Panacur (R); Hoechst Roussel
   Vet). Animals were randomly assigned to three groups (A, B, and C) based
   on sex and weight. Animals in group A (seven males and six females) were
   orally treated with oxfendazole at dose rate of 66 mg/kg, group B
   animals (nine males and eight females) were orally treated with
   fenbendazole at dose rate of 100 mg/kg, and group C animals (three males
   and three females) were not treated and served as controls. All animals
   were individually stabled in plexiglas boxes under controlled conditions
   of temperature, humidity, and light beginning 7 days pretreatment and
   continuing for the duration of the trial. Individual tortoises feces
   were examined daily by the McMaster technique and drugs efficacy was
   assessed by the fecal eggs count reduction (FECR) test. Both drugs
   showed 100\% of FECR. However, oxfendazole reached this level 12 days
   after treatment, whereas 31 days after treatment were necessary to
   obtain the same stable result with fenbendazole. The two drugs were well
   tolerated by all the animals and no adverse reactions were observed
   after treatment.},

Abstract = {Bovine spongiform encephalopathy is a prion disease of ruminants that
   was first recognized in 1986 in the United Kingdom. Early in the
   epidemic, it became obvious that the presence of meat and bone meal in
   feed rations was a common factor in all bovine spongiform encephalopathy
   cases. The first ban of derived animal proteins in feed was enforced in
   Europe in 1994 and implemented by Regulation 999/2001 that prohibited
   the feeding of animal-derived protein to farm animals. The only official
   method currently accepted by the European Union Commission for test for
   the presence of animal-derived proteins in feedstuffs is feed
   microscopy. In Italy, monitoring of feedstuff safety is provided by both
   the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture. The quality of
   official control, usually assessed by verifying the reproducibility and
   the accuracy of the testing method, is of fundamental importance for all
   laboratories and institutions using these results for comparative
   purposes. The aims of this study were to assess the reproducibility of
   the official method over all the Italian surveillance network and to
   provide a model for evaluating the performance of the monitoring system.
   The accuracy of the identification of the animal class of derived
   protein detected (avian, mammalian, or aquatic organism) was assessed.
   The interlaboratory agreement within the overall network reached 0.97
   (95\% confidence interval of 0.95 to 0.98) for determining the presence
   or absence of animal-derived proteins (e.g., for mammalian, avian, or
   aquatic species), and specificity of the identification of the animal
   class indicated that fish proteins are more easily recognized than are
   avian or mammalian proteins.},

Abstract = {Until now, significant differences in the neurochemical pattern of
   enteric neurons have been demonstrated in all species studied; however,
   some strong similarities also occur across species, such as the
   occurrence of nitric oxide synthase immunoreactivity(NOS-IR) in
   inhibitory motor neurons to muscle. In consideration of the insufficient
   data regarding the enteric nervous system (ENS) of sheep, we
   investigated the myenteric plexus and submucosal plexus of the ovine
   ileum. Since the pivotal role of the ENS in the early pathogenesis of
   sheep scrapie, the ``prototype{''} of prion diseases, has been
   suggested, we have focused our observations also on the host's PrP
   genotype. We have studied the morphology and distribution of NCS-IR
   neurons and their relationships with the enteric glia in whole-mount
   preparations and in cryostat sections. NOS-IR neurons, always encircled
   by glial processes, were located in both plexuses. Many NOS-IR fibers
   were seen in the circular muscle layer, in the submucosa, and in the
   mucosa. In the submucosa they were close to the lymphoid tissue. No
   differences in the distribution and percentage of NOS-IR fibers and
   neurons were observed among sheep carrying different PrP genotype, thus
   making unlikely their contribution in the determinism of
   susceptibility/resistance to scrapie infection.},

Abstract = {Poultry vaccines are widely applied to prevent and control contagious
   poultry diseases. Their use in poultry production is aimed at avoiding
   or minimising the emergence of clinical disease at farm level, thus
   increasing production. Vaccines and vaccination programmes vary broadly
   in regard to several local factors (e.g. type of production, local
   pattern of disease, costs and potential losses) and are generally
   managed by the poultry industry. In the last decade,the financial losses
   caused by the major epidemic diseases of poultry (avian influenza and
   Newcastle disease) have been enormous for both the commercial and the
   public sectors. Thus, vaccination should also be applied in the
   framework of poultry disease eradication programmes at national or
   regional levels under the official supervision of public Veterinary
   Services. This paper provides insight on the use of vaccination for the
   control of poultry infections, with particular emphasis on the control
   of transboundary poultry diseases.},

Abstract = {A total of 13,066 first-lactation test-day records of 2,277 Valle del
   Belice ewes from 17 flocks were used to estimate genetic parameters for
   somatic cell scores (SCS) and milk production traits, using a
   repeatability test-day animal model. Heritability estimates were low and
   ranged from 0.09 to 0.14 for milk, fat, and protein yields, and
   contents. For SCS, the heritability of 0.14 was relatively high. The
   repeatabilities were moderate and ranged from 0.29 to 0.47 for milk
   production traits. The repeatability for SCS was 0.36. Flock-test-day
   explained a large proportion of the variation for milk production
   traits, but it did not have a big effect on SCS. The genetic
   correlations of fat and protein yields with fat and protein percentages
   were positive and high, indicating a strong association between these
   traits. The genetic correlations of milk production traits with SCS were
   positive and ranged from 0.16 to 0.31. The results showed that SCS is a
   heritable trait in Valle del Belice sheep and that single-trait
   selection for increased milk production will also increase SCS.},

Abstract = {A cross-sectional survey of Giardia duodenalis and Cryptosporidium
   parvum infection in the water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) was carried out
   in central Italy. A geographical information system (GIS) was
   constructed utilizing as data-layers the topographic base map and the
   digital aerial photographs of the study area, as well as the
   geo-referenced points of all the buffalo farms. The survey was conducted
   on a sample of 90 farms, selected using a grid approach followed by
   proportional allocation. For this purpose, a grid representing quadrants
   of 5x5 kin was overlaid on the study area within the GIS. As a result,
   the study area was divided in equal quadrants, and the number of farms
   sampled in each quadrant was proportional to the total number of study
   population in that quadrant. On each farm, faecal samples were collected
   per rectum from three to five asymptomatic buffalo calves, aged from I
   to 9 weeks. The total number of faecal samples collected was 347. Each
   faecal sample was tested for the presence of copro-antigens of G.
   duodenalis and of C parvum using two commercially available
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Out of the 90 farms, 27 (30.0\%)
   resulted positive for G. duodenalis and 22 (24.4\%) for C parvum.
   Co-infection was found in ten (11.1\%) farms. With respect to animals,
   out of the 347 faecal samples, 63 (18.1\%) were found to have antigens
   of G. duodenalis and 51 (14.7\%) of C. parvum. Co-infection was found in
   ten buffalo calves (2.9\%). The results of the logistic regression
   models showed a positive association between the positivity to G.
   duodenalis and the presence of sheep on farm and between the positivity
   to C parvum and the high number of buffaloes on farms. No significant
   co-infection between the two protozoa was found. In conclusion, the
   findings of the present study, derived from a systematic territorial
   survey planned with GIS, are noteworthy because they provided additional
   data on C. parvum and the first evidence of G. duodenalis infection in
   water buffaloes.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The betanodaviruses are the causative agent of the disease viral nervous
   necrosis in fishes. Betanodavirus genome consists of two single-stranded
   positive-sense RNA molecules (RNA1 and RNA2). RNA1 gene encodes the RNA
   polymerase, named also protein A, while RNA2 encodes the coat protein
   precursor, the CPp protein. We investigated the evolutionary
   relationships among betanodaviruses working on partial sequences of both
   RNA1 and RNA2. Phylogenetic analyses were performed by applying a
   maximum likelihood approach. The phylogenetic relationships among, the
   major betanodavirus clades SJNNV-IV, TPNNV-III, BFNNV-II and RGNNV-1
   were resolved differently in the trees obtained, respectively, from RNA1
   and RNA2 multiple alignments. The alternative topologies were
   corroborated by strong bootstrap values. The molecular evolution of
   proteins A and CPp was also investigated. Protein A appeared to have
   evolved under strong purifying selection while the CPp protein was
   subject to both purifying and neutral selection in different amino acid
   residues. Intragenic recombination in RNA 1 and RNA2 genes was
   investigated by applying several methods and was not detected.
   Conversely reassortment of RNA 1 and RNA2 genes was demonstrated in some
   isolates. Finally RNA 1 and RNA2 genes substitution rates do not follow
   a clock-like behavior thus impeding estimation of a possible origin time
   for Betanodavirus genus. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The efficacy of imidacloprid 10\% and permethrin 50\% (Advantix (R);
   Bayer AG, Germany) in a spot-on formulation was evaluated in the field
   as a control measure to prevent canine leishmaniasis (CanL) in dogs in
   an endemic area of southern Italy. In February 2005, out of 845 dogs
   initially tested for CanL, 631 dogs which tested negative (315 from a
   kennel in Bari (KB) and 316 from a kennel in Ginosa (KG)) in a
   serological and a parasitological examination were allocated to one of
   three groups: Group A-treated with imidacloprid 10\% and permethrin 50\%
   once a month; Group B-treated every 2 weeks; and Group C-untreated
   control animals. All the dogs were examined serologically and
   parasitologically for CanL prior to the start of the study, in November
   2005 (end of the sandfly season) and in March 2006 (end of the study).
   An initial CanL seroprevalence of 24.7\% (209 dogs) was detected in KB
   and KG. In KB Leishmania infection, inferred by positivity in at least
   one of the three tests performed at the interim or final follow-up, was
   found in one animal from Group A and in nine from Group C. No positive
   animals were detected in Group B, thus giving a final protection
   efficacy of 88.9\% in Group A and 100\% in Group B. In KG Leishmania
   infection was identified in one animal from Groups A and B,
   respectively, and I I from Group C (protection efficacy of 90.36\% in
   Group A and 90.73\% in Group B). The incidence density rates (IDRs) of
   infection in both Groups A and B at each kennel were statistically
   significantly lower than that registered in Group C (KB p < 0.05 and KG
   p < 0.01). The results clearly show that a combination of imidacloprid
   10\% and permethrin 50\%, by virtue of its repellent activity against
   sandflies, is effective under both application regimes in preventing
   CanL in the field in endemic areas. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The control of illegal use of clenbuterol and other beta(2)-agonist
   drugs as growth promoters in the European Union countries has led to
   outlaw practices for synthesizing new concept molecules,, showing
   similar biological activity but not detectable by test methods usually
   employed to perform the official monitoring programmes. The synthesis
   schemes of some beta(2)-agonist compounds, formally derived from
   clenbuterol, were found out by Italian detective authorities. These
   compounds were synthesised ex novo in our laboratories: then, both their
   molecular structures and biological activities were characterised. In
   this paper, we describe different strategies for purifying some
   beta(2)-agonist drugs of new concept, more hydrophobic than clenbuterol.
   A two-step clean up procedure, prior to gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry analysis, was developed for the multi-residue determination
   of these beta(2)-agonists from bovine hair and urine. The purification
   strategy we chose was based on adsorption solid phase extraction and,
   subsequently, on specific molecular recognition by affinity
   chromatography. The affinity columns were homemade by coupling bovine
   alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein, a plasmatic acceptor for basic drugs, to a
   chromatographic support; their effectiveness for purifying new
   beta(2)-agonists was discussed. The data about method recoveries and
   repeatability were also reported. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {In animal production, it is consolidated the synthesis and the illegal
   use of growth promoters of new generation, able to skip routine
   screening and confirmatory analysis. In this work it is reported the
   nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and the mass spectrometry
   identification of a probable new adrenergic drug found in a feed premix.
   The substance was selectively purified on alpha I acid glycoprotein
   affinity columns; then its structure was first achieved by recording the
   C-13 NMR spectrum that gave the total number of carbons of the molecule,
   successively sorted by DEPT experiments into quaternary, CH, CH2, and
   CH3 groups. However, the complete assignments of all resonances were
   derived from the bi-dimensional analysis and the crucial indications
   from the H-1-C-13 reverse experiments. Further characterisation was
   performed by atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation both in positive
   and negative ion mode, matching the molecular ion and the fragmentation
   pattern with those of most recently described new adrenergic agonists.
   After the loss of a ter-butylic group, the structure shows an internal
   symmetry along with the presence of Chlorine clusters. The proposed
   formula of the compound, the
   8,8'-diamino-9,9'-dichloro-1-terbutyl-1,1',4,4-tetrahydro-5H,5'H-2,2'-bi
   -1-benzazepine-5,5'-dione, partially resembles that of Zilpaterol for
   the presence of a heterocyclic ring; Further work is in progress to
   characterise the structure-activity relationship. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Dexamethasone (DXM) is often illegally used as a growth promoter. To
   identify indirect biomarkers of illicit treatments, the urinary ratio
   between 6beta-hydroxycortisol (6beta-OHF) and cortisol (F) was measured
   in urines obtained from bulls experimentally treated per os and
   intramuscularly (im) with different DXM dosages.
   Dexamethasone, given per os at low doses elicited an early and lasting
   significant reduction of 6beta-OHF/F. No significant variations were
   seen in urines from bulls given DXM intramuscularly.
   These results suggest 6beta-OHF/F as a rapid, non-invasive, screening
   test for oral, low-dose, long-term corticosteroid treatment in cattle.
   Further studies are required to go deep inside the biochemical and

Abstract = {The Commission Decision 2002/657/EC is a fundamental reference document
   for the UE laboratories involved in residue analysis although its
   implementation has caused some difficulties in the requirements
   interpretation. In this work a pragmatic validation approach of a
   quantitative confirmatory method for the detection of
   17-alpha-(alpha-NT) and 17-beta-19-nortestosterone (beta-NT) in bovine
   urine by gas chromatography mass spectrometry is proposed. The
   19-nortestosterone is a banned anabolic steroid for which no minimum
   required performance limit (MRPL) has been laid down, therefore the
   limit reported in Italian Residue Monitoring Plan (2 mu g L-1) has been
   considered the reference level to evaluate the method performances. The
   decision limit (CC alpha) and the detection capability (CC beta) were
   obtained by the calibration curve procedure. The minimum required
   performance level (mrpl), which represents the starting concentration of
   the calibration curves, was preliminary fixed estimating the results
   dispersion of blank urine samples fortified at 2 mu g L-1 for each
   isomer. The found CCa and CC beta were 1.5 and 1.9 mu g L-1 for alpha-NT
   and 1.2 and 1.4 mu g L-1 for beta-NT. The precision (repeatability and
   within-laboratory reproducibility) and recoveries were suitable for the
   investigated concentration range (1-3 mu g L-1). Finally, the method
   ruggedness (minor and major changes) has been also demonstrated. (c)

Abstract = {Natural occurrence or illegal treatment of boldenone (BOLD) presence in
   cattle urine is under debate within the European Union. Separation of
   conjugated and unconjugated forms of 17 alpha-boldenone (alpha-BOLD) and
   17 beta-boldenone (beta-BOLD) and presence of related molecules as
   androsta-1,4-diene-3,17-dione (ADD) appear critical points for the
   decision of an illegal use. The aim of this study is a new analytical
   approach of BOLD and ADD confirmation in cattle urine. The separation
   between conjugated and unconjugated forms of BOLD was obtained by a
   preliminary urine liquid-liquid extraction step with ethyl acetate. In
   this step the organic phase extracts only unconjugated BOLD and ADD,
   while BOLD in conjugated form remain in urine phase. Afterwards the
   urine phase, contains conjugated BOLD, was subjected to an enzymatic
   deconjugation. Solid-phase extraction (OASIS-HLB Waters) was used for
   the purification and concentration of analytes in organic and urine
   phases and liquid chromatography ion electrospray tandem mass
   spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) was applied for the confirmation of BOLD and
   ADD, using deuterium-labelled 17 beta-boldenone (BOLD-d3) as internal
   standard. The method was validated as a quantitative confirmatory method
   according to the Commission Decision 2002/657/CE. The results obtained
   demonstrate that the developed method show very high specificity,
   precision, trueness and ruggedness. Decision limits (CC alpha) smaller
   than 0.5 ng mL(-1) were obtained for each analyte. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {17 beta-Boldenone (17 beta-BOLD) and Boldione (ADD) are steroid
   compounds with androgenic activity, likely to be used as growth
   promoters in cattle. Different studies still on-going aiming to
   distinguish between ``natural{''} occurrence or illegal BOLD source had
   already indicated that their metabolism in cattle is of relevant
   significance. To identify metabolites as in vivo markers to support the
   thesis of exogenous administration, a further approach to the in vitro
   biotransformation of 17 beta-BOLD and ADD was performed using different
   subcellular fractions obtained from both liver and kidney of untreated
   cattle. Polar and non-polar metabolites obtained from incubated parent
   compounds were formerly separated by high performance liquid
   chromatography (HPLC) elution and successively identified by liquid
   chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) detection.
   The bovine liver was the target tissue of the main metabolic reaction
   transforming 17 beta-BOLD to ADD and vice versa. The presence of 6
   beta-hydroxy-17 beta-BOLD, produced from both compounds when NADPH was
   added as cofactors to liver post mitochondrial and microsomal fractions
   suggests that cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes could be involved in the
   biotransformation, as it occurs for 6 beta-hydroxylation of 17
   beta-testosterone. The results indicated that the urinary excretion
   profile in vivo of 6 beta-hydroxy-17 beta-BOLD and 16 alpha-hydroxy-17
   beta-BOLD could be studied together with 17 alpha- and 17 beta-BOLD as
   putative markers of BOLD treatment in cattle. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Incidence and circulation of different strains of hepatitis A and
   Norovirus in shellfish were studied on 235 samples (Tapes philippinarum,
   Mytilus galloprovincialis, Ostrea spp. and Chlamys spp.) obtained from
   different sites, representing the shellfish production areas of the
   northern Adriatic sea. Shellfish were harvested in the period of one
   year and, after deputation, were examined for bacterial (Escherichia
   coli and Salmonella) and viral (HAV and NoV) contamination. Viral
   contamination was present on average in 22\% of samples: specifically,
   6\%, of samples tested positive for HAV, 14\% for NoV and 2\% for both
   viruses. None of the samples revealed the presence of Salmonella, and in
   most of them (93\%) the number of E. coli was below the European
   legislation limit of 230 MPN/100 g. T philippinarum was the species most
   often contaminated, as well as being the only species in which the legal
   limit for E. coli was, in some cases, exceeded. Both HAV and NoV
   contamination were detected throughout the year; NoV detection was
   slightly more frequent during winter months, but positive samples were
   also present in summer. The sequencing of the PCR products showed the
   circulation of only one HAV genotype (IA) and four different NoV
   genotypes (Hawaii, Melksham, Lordsdale and GGIIb) with a prevalence of
   the GGIIb genotype in the second period of the monitoring. Published by

Volume = {27},

Abstract = {Interferon-alpha ( IFN-alpha) is thought of by most immunologists as a
   fundamental component of the antiviral innate immune response, with
   other, accessory properties. Several lines of evidence point to a
   fundamental reappraisal of this conceptual framework because it may
   neglect other crucial functions of this cytokine under both health and
   disease conditions. Among these, a regulatory role in the inflammatory
   response is probably of paramount importance, as shown by in vivo and in
   vitro studies on humans, pets, and farm and laboratory animals. This
   role would not conflict with the main functions of IFN-alpha in the
   innate immune system and would complement these in line with major,
   evolution-based needs of the host. A hinge role of IFN-alpha between
   innate and adaptive immunity was recognized in the past on the basis of
   compelling evidence. This concept should now be widened; not only does
   IFN-alpha act to trigger, amplify, and sustain the different phases of
   the immune response, but it could also promote a substantial balance
   between danger and inflammatory response when an infectious challenge is
   either declining or completely over.},

Abstract = {Atypical neuropathological and molecular phenotypes of bovine spongiform
   encephalopathy (BSE) have recently been identified in different
   countries. One of these phenotypes, named bovine ``amyloidotic''
   spongiform encephalopathy (BASE), differs from classical BSE for the
   occurrence of a distinct type of the disease-associated prion protein
   (PrP), termed PrPSc, and the presence of PrP amyloid plaques. Here, we
   show that the agents responsible for BSE and BASE possess different
   biological properties upon transmission to transgenic mice expressing
   bovine PrP and inbred lines of nontransgenic mice. Strikingly, serial
   passages of the BASE strain to nontransgenic mice induced a
   neuropathological and molecular disease phenotype indistinguishable from
   that of BSE- infected mice. The existence of more than one agent
   associated with prion disease in cattle and the ability of the BASE
   strain to convert into the BSE strain may have important implications
   with respect to the origin of BSE and spongiform encephalopathies in
   other species, including humans.},

Abstract = {Viruses belonging to the genus Astrovirus have been increasingly
   associated with enteritis in mammalian and avian species, including
   turkeys. More recently, astroviruses have also been detected in diseased
   guinea fowl. In turkeys, two genetically distinct types of astrovirus
   have been reported, namely turkey astrovirus 1 and 2 (TAstV1 and
   TAstV2). The prevalence and the pathogenesis of astrovirus infections in
   this species is currently unknown, with the exception of data generated
   in the USA. In the present report, we have demonstrated the
   co-circulation of distinct genetic lineages of astroviruses infecting
   turkeys and guinea fowl. The predominant lineage infecting turkeys is
   genetically related to the American TAstV2, but genetic variability
   within this lineage was demonstrated. Other isolates appeared to be
   either TastV1-related or unrelated to any other known isolate.
   Astroviruses infecting guinea fowl were more closely related to TAstV2,
   and interspecies transmissions between turkeys and guinea fowl is
   suggested as a possible mechanism by which these viruses may have
   evolved, based on the genetic data available. This investigation
   provides genetic and epidemiological information contributing to a
   better understanding of enteric viral infections in turkeys and guinea
   fowl.},

Abstract = {Background: Cyclophosphamide (CYP) and methotrexate (MTX) have been used
   as immunosuppressants in induction or maintenance protocols in a large
   variety of xenotransplantation models. Combining the use of transgenic
   porcine organs expressing human decay-accelerating factor (hDAF) with
   immunosuppressive therapy that included the use of CYP or MTX, survival
   of primate recipients of life-supporting renal xenografts has been
   prolonged. However, both drugs can cause significant systemic toxicity
   and, in particular, gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. To date only limited
   data have been reported on the histopathological features deriving from
   the use of such agents in non-human primates.
   Methods: Cyclophosphamide or MTX was used as part of the
   immunosuppressive regimen in 15 bilaterally nephrectomized non-human
   primate (Macaca fascicularis) recipients of a life-supporting hDAF
   porcine kidney. At post-mortem, a detailed analysis of the GI tract in
   animals receiving either CYP or MTX was performed. Paraffin-embedded
   sections of each portion of the GI tract were prepared and stained with
   hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E). In some animals, additional investigations
   by immunohistochemistry (CD3, C135, C1320, CD79 alpha cy, lambda, and
   kappa light chains) and by in situ hybridization for EBV encoded RNA
   (EBER) were undertaken.
   Results: The xenografted animals from the CYP group had a mean survival
   of 31 days (range: 0 to 90 days); animals from the MTX group survived a
   median of 14 days (range: 0 to 39 days). GI complications were the most
   frequent cause of euthanasia after renal failure. In CYP-treated animals
   GI-tract lesions were primarily characterized by diffuse, severe
   lymphoplasmocytic mucosal inflammatory infiltrate. Variable degrees of
   villi atrophy and fusion, gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and
   goblet cell hyperplasia were also observed. In MTX-treated primates,
   findings were consistent with severe villi atrophy associated with
   mild-to-moderate disseminated lymphoplasmocytic infiltration.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, GI tract lesions are an early and consistent
   finding when CYP or MTX are used as induction agents in this model. The
   two compounds induce different types of GI tract damage, however, in
   agreement with their different mechanisms of action. Whilst CYP
   primarily determines inflammatory lesions, MTX leads to a degenerative
   type of damage. This study indicates that immunosuppressive drugs can
   cause severe GI tract damage in primate recipients of renal xenografts
   and may be responsible for life-threatening lesions.},

Abstract = {A 10-year-old female cat was brought to Istituto Zooprofilattico
   Sperimentale belle Regioni Lazio e Toscana for post-mortem examination.
   The animal used to live, together with 26 other cats, in the big terrace
   of an apartment at the 8(th), floor in Rome, and was always fed with
   industrial pet food. Anamnesis referred balance troubles, vomit and
   convulsions, during a couple of days, followed by sudden death. At
   necropsy, the cat presented mucoid rhinitis, purulent tracheitis, small
   areas of pneumonia, dark spots in the liver, catarrhal-hemorrhagic
   gastritis, fibrinous enteritis and meningeal hyperemia. Thoracic and
   abdominal cavities were completely invaded by hundreds of larval stages
   of cestodes. The same parasites were also included in nodules in
   pancreatic, lung and kidney parenchyma. Microscopic examination of
   parasites allowed their identification as larval stages (metacestodes)
   of cestodes of the genus Mesocestoides. The molecular genotyping of the
   metacestodes indicates a close relationship with members of the genus
   Mesocestoides, although a significant variation was found with respect
   to the available sequences of other species of the genus.},

Title = {Candidate genes affecting sheep and goat milk quality},
Journal = {SMALL RUMINANT RESEARCH},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {68},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {179-192},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The candidate gene approach is now exploited in sheep and goats, aiming
   to identify the molecular mechanisms, which make milks of different
   quality. In this paper, the relevant literature on this topic is
   reviewed. The most intensively analysed genes are milk protein genes,
   where, up to now, major effects were assessed for the alpha(s1)-casein,
   in both sheep and goats. For the alpha(s2)-casein, only in goats it was
   possible to associate the detected alleles with different casein
   synthesis levels: normal, low or null. For the P-casein, several
   variants were detected in goats, some of which are associated with a
   very low casein content, but extensive studies on the frequency and the
   effect of such variants are still to be conducted. The k-casein was
   thoroughly analysed at the genomic level in many breeds of goats, and 16
   alleles were identified. However, no positive association of any allele
   with milk characteristics was so far reported. Conflicting results were
   obtained on the effect of P-lactoglobulin in sheep, while, in goats,
   variants were also extensively studied, but a positive association was
   found only with milk yield. Also the structure of the alpha-lactalbumin
   gene was partially investigated, but its possible effect on milk quality
   is still uncertain either in sheep or goats. Other candidate genes, that
   are being now extensively studied, are the genes encoding enzymes
   directly involved in fatty acid metabolism: ACACA in sheep; SCD in sheep
   and goats; LPL and DGAT1 in sheep, for which preliminary results of
   their effect on milk quality are given. The list of the studied
   candidate genes, that are being investigated according to their
   function, include FABP3, AMY, CGN, ACP6, ANAXA9, AMY2, gGH and
   Lactoferrin, although research on these genes is still at the beginning.
   It is expected, that new candidate genes will be identified by
   microarray analysis on total mRNA of the mammary gland, and that further
   field studies will be carried on, to demonstrate the association between
   genetic variants and milk quality. Nutritional and functional properties
   of milk still need to be more deeply investigated. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {An unusual clinical presentation of lymphoma with vertebral involvement
   in a dog is reported. A 20-month-old intact female Golden Retriever
   presented with progressive paraparesis and anorexia. Complete blood
   count and serum biochemistry profile demonstrated pancytopenia and
   hypercalcemia. Ventral fusion of the lumbar vertebrae by new bony tissue
   deposition was evident on X-ray and CT scan. Fine needle aspiration
   revealed neoplastic lymphoid cells in lymph nodes and bone marrow.
   Histologically, vertebral bone and osteophytes, liver, bone marrow,
   kidney, and lymph nodes were diffusely infiltrated by neoplastic,
   lymphoid cells, with scant cytoplasm and round hyperchromatic nuclei.
   Polyostotic and medullary T-cell lymphoma with spondylosis was
   diagnosed. Lymphoma mainly affecting bone is uncommon in the dog. The
   present case differs from previously described polyostotic lymphomas in
   clinical signs of the disease, mainly attributable to spondylarthrosis.
   In addition, lymphomatous proliferation was associated with

Abstract = {A survey was carried out to assess the occurrence of Coenurus cerebralis
   infection in Sardinian sheep. A prevalence of 0.35\% was observed when
   566 regularly slaughtered sheep were examined. However, in 120 sheep
   with suspected symptoms of coenurosis examined from November 2001 to
   October 2002, a total of 299 cerebral coenurosis lesions were observed
   with an incidence of 1\% per year. Lesions were classified as migratory,
   cystic and secondary. Most migratory lesions were found in sheep aged
   3-6 months. Cavitary lesions containing cysts in different developing
   stages were found with high incidence per year in sheep aged 7-12
   months. Secondary lesions due to the development of Coenurus were most
   frequent in sheep aged 19-36 months. Most sheep were found infected in
   spring and in early summer, between March and June. Most lesions were
   located in the cortex. The mean number of protoscolices per cyst was 149
   (range 10-370). (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Role of beta-endorphin on phospholipase production in Malassezia
   pachydermatis in dogs: new insights into the pathogenesis of this yeast},
Journal = {MEDICAL MYCOLOGY},

Abstract = {Malassezia spp. are lipophilic yeasts that are part of the normal
   cutaneous microflora and sometimes act as pathogens causing dermatitis.
   This study investigated the interactions occurring between
   beta-endorphin and phospholipase activity in isolates of M.
   pachydermatis in dogs presenting cutaneous lesions. Phospholipase
   production was evaluated and quantified on 144 isolates suspended in
   Dixon broth to which different beta-endorphin concentrations (from 600
   to 0.6 pM) were added. The isolates were divided into three groups:
   group A comprised isolates from lesional skin of dogs with dermatitis
   confined to one site, group B consisted of isolates from the healthy
   skin of the same dogs with localized lesions, and group C was made up of
   isolates from assorted skin sites of healthy dogs. A statistically
   higher phospholipase activity than that of the controls was recorded in
   group B at all tested beta-endorphin concentrations. In groups A (Pz
   =0.62) and C (Pz =0.62) phospholipase activity was statistically higher
   than the controls only at a concentration of 600 pM. This study suggests
   that beta-endorphin plays an important role in the production of
   phospholipase in M. pachydermatis isolates and provides evidence that
   beta-endorphin concentrations affect the number but not the Pz value of
   phospholipase-producing isolates. B-endorphin concentrations may play a
   relevant role in inducing M. pachydermatis cell differentiation towards
   the production or non-production of phospholipase.},

Abstract = {We tested 413 water buffalo cows (142 cases and 271 controls) for the
   presence of anti-Brucella abortus antibodies (by the skin test, the
   agglutination test, and the complement fixation test) and the Nramp1
   genotype (by capillary electrophoresis). Four alleles (Nramp1A, -B, -C,
   and -D) were detected in the 3' untranslated region of the Nramp1 gene.
   The BB genotype was represented among only controls, providing evidence
   that this genotype confers resistance to Brucella abortus. The monocytes
   from the BB (resistant) subjects displayed a higher basal level of
   Nramp1 mRNA and a lower number of viable intracellular bacteria than did
   the monocytes from AA (susceptible) subjects. The higher basal level of
   the antibacterial protein Nramp1 most probably provides the BB animals
   with the possibility of controlling bacteria immediately after their
   entry inside the cell.},

Abstract = {Bovine Somatotropin (bST) is a peptide hormone secreted by the anterior
   pituitary gland and its recombinant form (rbST) is used for artificially
   boosting milk yield in cows. Identification of rbST is difficult in that
   there is little difference from the pituitary bST (pbST). In this work,
   we further studied the possibility of immunologically discriminating
   between rbST and pbST. With this purpose, we produced mouse monoclonal
   antibodies using, as antigen, a peptide mimicking the N-terminus of rbST
   from Monsanto (rbST-M) conjugated to keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH)
   and polyclonal antibodies in rabbits immunized with the whole bST or
   rbST-M. Hence, we developed a sandwich ELISA with the obtained
   antibodies for detection and quantification of bST in serum and compared
   its performance on the two worldwide commercialized rbSTs: rbST-M and
   rbST from LG Life Science (rbST-LG). The lowest detection limit of the
   assay was 0.05 ng/ml for rbST-M, 0.10 ng/ml for rbST-LG and 0.15 ng/ml
   for pbST. Furthermore, the assay showed the capability to amplify the
   signal in the presence of rbSTs, recognizing more efficiently rbST-M and
   rbST-LG than pbST (ECn pbST/ECn rbST: 3 and 1.6 respectively). Its
   employment for measuring bST levels in sera from bovines administered
   with rbST LG allowed us to detect exceptional values due to the
   treatment itself and probably further increased as a consequence of the
   higher affinity for rbSTs of our monoclonal antibody.},

Abstract = {In order to evaluate the temporal occurrence of Cryptosporidium oocysts
   in Ruditapes philippinarum clams bred along the northeastern Italian
   Adriatic coast and molecularly characterize the isolates, 2,160
   specimens (180 clams per month) were collected from three clam farms
   from January to December 2004. Two farms (sites A and 13) were located
   in Venice (Chioggia, Veneto region) and one (site C) in the Marano
   Lagoons (Friuli Venezia Giulia region). Clams from 36 pools (i.e., one
   pool of 60 clams per month per site) were subjected to a
   high-sensitivity seminested PCR assay specific for a 360-bp diagnostic
   region internal to the Cryptosporidium spp. outer wall protein guene.
   Positive amplicons were sequenced and analyzed. Cryptosporidium DNA was
   found in clams from seven pools (sites A and B) during 1 month of
   sampling at site A and 6 months of sampling at site B, with
   Cryptosporidium hominis and Cryptosporidiunt parvum being detected. The
   expected infection rate of the clams was 0.36\%. Site B showed a
   significantly higher expected infection rate (1.15\%) than did the other
   sites (A = 0.14\% and C = 0\%). Given its high sensitivity and
   specificity, this seminested PCR assay can be considered a reliable tool
   for detecting and distinguishing species within the Coptosporidium
   genus. The seasonal pattern of contamination and the related public
   health risks are of particular concern.},

Abstract = {We describe the expression of pStat3-ser727 (signal transducer and
   activator of transcription 3 phosphorylated on serine 727) in normal,
   hyperplastic and neoplastic feline mammary gland tissue assessed by
   immunohistochemistry in 56 cats. The samples included 4 normal mammary
   non-lactating tissues, 13 hyperplastic lesions (9 lobular and 4
   fibroepithelial) and 39 tumours (6 benign and 33 carcinomas). For
   immunohistochemistry, tissue sections were incubated with
   anti-pStat3-ser727 monoclonal antibodies and visualized with
   EnVision-DAB polymer. pStat3-ser727 positivity was quantified in a
   semi-quantitative manner, differentiating cytoplasmic and nuclear
   localization. Intense anti-pStat3-ser727 immunoreactivity was detected
   in epithelial neoplastic cells and in the fibro-component in two
   fibroepithelial hyperplastic lesions. The immunostaining was dot-like in
   the cytoplasm and homogeneous in the nuclei in both benign and malignant
   lesions. Statistically significant relations were observed between
   nuclear expression of pStat3-ser727 and the pleomorphism score (p =
   0.006), mitotic activity (p < 0.0001), and histological grade (p <
   0.0001). In contrast, no significant correlations were observed for
   cytoplasmic pStat3-ser727. These findings add new and interesting
   information on the potential role of the phosphorylated form of Stat3 in
   malignant lesions.},

Title = {Seasonality of plasma testosterone in males of four Mediterranean goat

Abstract = {The aims of the present work were to evaluate if a seasonality of plasma
   testosterone concentrations exists in Mediterranean male goats and it
   may be affected by climatic conditions. Testosterone concentrations were
   determined throughout I year in blood samples collected weekly from 24
   males of 4 Mediterranean goat breeds (Ionica, Garganica, Maltese and Red
   Syrian), fed a constant diet, maintained without interactions with does
   and reared in 3 farms with different climates, in Italy. Plasma
   testosterone concentrations were affected by season (P < 0.0001), being
   higher during summer (8.33 +/- 0.35 ng/mL) than during autumn (6.81 +/-
   0.26 ng/mL), which were in turn higher than in winter (1.55 +/- 0.08
   ng/mL) and spring (2.04 +/- 0.15 ng/mL). An effect of breed was recorded
   (P < 0.001), lonica bucks having the highest plasma testosterone means,
   Red Syrian and Maltese the lowest. The onset of the reproductive season
   was similar among the breeds. lonica bucks had a later offset than Red
   Syrian and Maltese and a longer reproductive season than Maltese bucks
   (P < 0.05). No effect of farm nor interaction breed x farm was recorded.
   Single sporadic peaks of plasma testosterone were recorded in many
   bucks, outside the main reproductive season, especially during spring.
   In conclusion the bucks of all the four breeds displayed a clear
   seasonality of plasma testosterone, with very low levels from January to
   May and high levels from July to November; hormone levels and pattern of
   seasonality were affected by breed and not by climate. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {Anaplasma marginale is a tick-bome pathogen of cattle that causes the
   disease bovine anaplasmosis worldwide. Major surface proteins (MSPs) are
   involved in host-pathogen and tick-pathogen interactions and have been
   used as markers for the genetic characterization of A. marginale strains
   and phylogenetic studies. MSP1a is involved in the adhesion and
   transmission of A. marginale by ticks and varies among geographic
   strains in the number and sequence of amino-terminal tandem repeats. The
   aim of this study was to characterize the genetic diversity of A.
   marginale strains collected from countries in North and South America,
   Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia, inclusive of all continents. In this
   study, we characterized 131 strains of A. marginale using 79 MSP1a
   repeat sequences. These results corroborated the genetic heterogeneity
   of A. marginale strains in endemic regions worldwide. The phylogenetic
   analyses of MSP1a repeat sequences did not result in clusters according
   to the geographic origin of A. marginale strains but provided
   phylogeographic information. Seventy-eight percent of the MSP1a repeat
   sequences were present in strains from a single geographic region.
   Strong (>= 80\%) support was found for clusters containing sequences
   from Italian, Spanish, Chinese, Argentinean and South American strains.
   The phylogenetic analyses of MSP1a repeat sequences suggested
   tick-pathogen co-evolution and provided evidence of multiple
   introductions of A. marginale strains from various geographic locations
   worldwide. These results contribute to the understanding of the genetic
   diversity and evolution of A. marginale and tick-pathogen interactions.

Abstract = {We describe the development and preliminary characterization of a
   recombinant canarypox virus vectored vaccine for protective immunization
   of ruminants against bluetongue virus (BTV) infection. Sheep (n = 6)
   immunized with recombinant canarypox virus vector (BTV-CP) co-expressing
   synthetic genes encoding the two outer capsid proteins (VP2 and VP5) of
   BTV serotype 17 (BTV-17) developed high titers (40-160) of
   virus-specific neutralizing antibodies and were resistant to challenge
   with a field strain of BTV-17. In contrast, sheep (11 = 5) immunized
   with a commercial recombinant canarypox virus vector expressing the E
   and preM genes of West Nile virus were seronegative to BTV and developed
   pyrexia, lymphopenia, and extended, high-titered viremias following
   challenge exposure to the field strain of BTV-17. These data confirm
   that the BTV-CP vaccine may be useful for the protective immunization of
   ruminants against bluetongue, and it may avoid the problems inherent to
   live-attenuated (LA) BTV vaccines. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Scrapie in sheep is an infectious disease with genetic susceptibility
   playing an important role. The European Union applied genetics to
   control scrapie in the sheep population. In goats no clear association
   between PrP genotypes and resistance to scrapie has been demonstrated
   yet. Beside investigating this further, it is important to know the PrP
   genotype distribution in goat breeds. Actually, to estimate the
   frequency of interesting alleles in a population is a necessary
   preliminary step to understand how feasible it could be to select them.
   Aim of this work is to analyse the variability of the PrP gene in goat
   breeds from a Northern and a Southern Italian regions.
   Blood samples were collected from 300 goats of the four most common goat
   breeds reared in Piedmont region, belonging to 81 herds, and from 178
   goats of 7 breeds from Basilicata, belonging to 19 herds. PrP gene
   polymorphisms were detected by direct DNA sequencing on both strands of
   the PCR products.
   In total, thirteen point mutations were identified: G37V, T110P, G127S,
   M137I, I142M, I142T, H143R, R154H, P168Q, T194P, R211Q, Q222K and S240P
   (the substitutions 1142T and T194P are novel). This variability gave
   rise to 14 alleles. The allele with S127 mutation and the allele with
   Q211 mutation were found only in Northern goats while V37, I137, T142,
   R143 and P194 alleles were detected only in Southern goats.
   Regarding the alleles that were present in both groups, the M142 allele
   was statistically associated with Northern goats (chi(2)=39.84,
   p-value=<0.001) while K222 and H154 alleles were significantly
   associated with breeds from the South (chi(2)=54.75, p-value=<0.001;
   chi(2)=5.68, p-value=<0.05, respectively). The substitutions T11OP,
   M137I, I142T, P168Q, and T194P were found at a low rate in both Southern
   and Northern goats and no statistically significant differences were
   observed between the groups.
   The present study revealed a high variability in the caprine PrP gene
   and clear frequency differences between Northern and Southern breeds,
   with mutations exclusively or significantly associated with one group or
   the other. M142 and K222 are known to be related to protection against
   scrapie in goats. More case-control studies are necessary to confirm the
   protective role of these variants; in fact if this role is confirmed it
   will allow the introduction of breeding programme to select for
   resistance to TSEs also in goats.},

Abstract = {Zinc bacitracin is widely used in Italian rabbit farms to control both
   Epizootic Rabbit Enteropathy (ERE) and clostridiosis, and field results
   demonstrate useful activity. Nevertheless, data regarding the in vitro
   efficacy of zinc bacitracin against clostridia of rabbit origin are not
   available. In this study, the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs)
   of zinc bacitracin were evaluated in 123 C. perfringens strains isolated
   from rabbits in Italian fattening units. The agar dilution method was
   performed in Brucella Agar supplemented with laked sheep blood, haemin
   and vitamin K-1, as recommended in NCCLS document M11-A6. Most strains
   (94.3\%) had low MIC values (<= 0.5 mu g/ml), and a few strains (4\%)
   were inhibited by a concentration of 1 mu g/ml. Two isolates (1.6\%) had
   a MIC value of 16 mu g/ml. The MIC values of ATCC reference strains
   showed a good fit between each batch. MIC required to inhibit the 90\%
   of organisms was 0.5 mu g/ml and the presence of only two strains with
   MIC=16 mu g/ml revealed the susceptibility to zinc bacitracin of Italian
   isolates of C. perfringens from rabbit and the absence of acquired
   resistance.},

Title = {Binding of aflatoxins to the 20S proteasome: effects on enzyme

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {388},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Aflatoxins (AF) are contaminants of improperly stored foods; they are
   potent genotoxic and carcinogenic compounds, exerting their effects
   through damage to DNA. They can also induce mutations that increase
   oxidative damage. The goal of this study was to evaluate the possibility
   that a third mechanism could be involved in the carcinogenic action of
   aflatoxins, namely, direct binding to key enzymes involved in the
   regulatory pathways of the cell cycle, thereby modulating enzyme
   functionality. The 20S constitutive and immunoproteasome peptidase and
   proteolytic activities were assayed in the presence of aflatoxins B1, G1
   and M1. All three toxins activated multiple peptidase activities of the
   proteasome. Aflatoxin (AF) M1 was the most potent activator of
   proteasome activity, while the constitutive 20S proteasome was
   specifically stimulated by AFG1. Furthermore, the effects of AFB1 on
   cultured hepatoma cells were investigated and the various proteasomal
   activities determined with cell lysates were differently affected.
   Taking into account the key role of the proteasome in cellular defense
   against oxidative stress, the carbonyl group content and the activities
   of antioxidant enzymes in cell lysates were analyzed. The proapoptotic
   effect of AFB1 was also investigated by measuring caspase-3 activity and
   cellular levels of p27 and I kappa B alpha.},

Abstract = {The present study aimed to determinate beef meat shelf-life packaged in

   ageing), 2 types of packaging (with or without water absorbent pad) and
   3 different conservation times (3, 7 or 11 days). The analysis regarded:
   water loss, colour, TBArs and protein ossidation. Liquid loss showed
   higher value in packaged meat with absorbent pad than the other (10.38\%
   vs 2.42\% P < 0.001), while the evaporate liquid was highest in no
   absorbent pad samples. The positive effect of pad was found in
   metmyoglobin percentage (13.98 vs 15.10 \% respectively for its presence
   and absence) and protein oxidation (67.32 vs 79.26 nmol thiol/mg protein
   P < 0.05). TBArs increased with conservation times from 0.88 to 2.57
   mg/100g, while it didn't show differences between the two thesis and the
   two different packaging methods. In conclusion the use of absorbent pad
   improved meat nutritive quality despite produced more water loss.},

Abstract = {The internal Transcribed Spacer 1 (ITS-1) region from Marteilia spp.
   parasitizing Mediterranean mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) from

   coinfection with the two types was common. In addition, all the
   available molecular information on Marteilia spp. ITS-1 region in Europe
   was compared and summarized. All these molecular data, in addition to
   molecular data from other regions and ultrastructural evidence, support
   the synonymy of M. maurini, the parasite originally described from
   mussels, with M. refringens, which was originally described from oysters
   and has taxonomic priority. This emphasises the need for further

Abstract = {The use of feed additives with mycotoxin adsorption capacity is a common
   strategy for controlling negative effects of mycotoxins in swine
   production systems. However, adsorbents that may results very effective
   under experimental conditions, i.e. when feed contamination level is
   rather high, do not necessarily retain their efficacy when tested under
   field conditions feed with generally low mycotoxin contamination. In
   this study, the effects of diets artificially contaminated with
   aflatoxin B1 or ochratoxin A on fattening performance and serum
   chemistry of fattening pigs are investigated. Moreover, the ability of a
   commercial glucomannan polymer (Gm polimer) to reduce or eliminate the
   effects of the contaminated feeds is tested. Thirty heavy pigs (BW = 110
   +/- 10.6 kg) were fed 6 diets (n = 5 pigs/diet) for 4 weeks until
   slaughtering. Diets were: control without toxin added (C); added with
   0.02 ppm of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1); added with 0.05 ppm of ochratoxin A
   (OTA); other three diets as the previous but the addition of 2.0 g/kg of
   Gm polymer (C-GM, AFB1-GM, OTA-GM). Daily weight gain (ADG) and Feed
   efficiency ratio (FE) were measured every two weeks. Data were analyzed
   with a two-way ANOVA that included the fixed effect of diet, time and
   their interaction. After the first 2 weeks the ADG did not differ
   significantly between the diets, even if the ADG of AFB1 diet was about
   20\% lower than AFB1-Gm or C. In the last 2 weeks the ADG of AFB1 diet
   was significantly lover than the other diets (P<0.01) and was about
   one-half of the values reported for the same group in the first period.
   The contamination with ochratoxin A did not affect fattening performance
   of pigs during the whole experimental period. No damages were found in
   kidneys of all diets. Moreover, no evidence of association between
   observed liver damages and different diets was found. Finally, no
   differences between experimental diets were evidenced for the
   haematological parameters.},

Abstract = {The recent outbreaks of avian influenza (AI) worldwide have highlighted
   the difficulties in controlling this disease. Vaccination has become a
   recommended tool to support the eradication efforts and to limit the

   vaccine containing a heterologous neuraminidase to the field virus has
   been shown to be efficacious in reducing the viral shedding and clinical
   symptoms and in differentiating vaccinated from infected animals (2). To
   further develop this so called differentiating infected from vaccinated
   animal vaccination system, two reassortant avian influenza viruses of
   the H7N5 subtype have been generated. The aim of this study was to
   generate a prototype strain with a rare N subtype to avoid interference
   with the anti-N discriminatory test.},

Abstract = {Two dietary additions of nitrate (15 mg/kg or 150 mg/kg, supplied by

   The effect of challenge never interacted significantly with the dietary
   treatment. Feed intake, growth, body temperature, salivary excretion,
   and faecal excretion of ST and gastric function were not affected by the
   nitrate supplementation. With nitrate additions, total IgA in blood
   serum tended to be higher before and after the challenge (P < 0.10).
   Nitrite in saliva - but not nitrate - increased with the increasing
   supplementation at d 5, but not at d 19. The nitrate additions did not

Abstract = {Meat-type turkey farms in Verona province (Veneto, Italy) have been
   affected by three low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) epidemics
   between 2000 and 2004. Control measures implemented ranged from stamping
   Out to controlled marketing in conjunction with restocking bans and
   movement restriction on live poultry, vehicles, and personnel. These
   measures were complemented with two emergency vaccination programs
   (2000-01, 2002-03) started after the beginning of the epidemics, while
   2004 outbreaks occurred in vaccinated farms. The three epidemics
   differed in the number of outbreaks, duration, and economic impact. The
   aim of the investigation was to estimate the risk of infection and the
   effect of vaccination on the LPAI epidemics affecting turkey farms in
   Verona province. Farm probability to avoid infection (Ps) was calculated
   by Kaplan-Meier for each epidemic. The vaccination effect was evaluated
   for the 2000-01 and 2002-03 epidemics considering different risk before
   or after the emergency vaccination. The epidemics and vaccination
   entered as predictors in a Cox regression model and hazard ratios (HR)
   were calculated. Ps values at the end of the epidemics were as follows:
   2000-01 = 0.66, 2002-03 = 0.51, and 2004 = 0.91. Vaccination reduced
   dramatically the risk of infection. The measures implemented had
   different effects on the three epidemics. The lower probability of being
   infected during the 2004 epidemic was most likely related to the
   protection level of the vaccinated farms acquired before the beginning
   of the epidemic, which was also responsible for the reduced spread of
   infection.},

Abstract = {Italian poultry production was affected by several outbreaks of
   low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) between 2000 and 2005.
   Intervention measures (IM), such as stamping out of infected and
   suspected farms, controlled marketing, restocking bans, movement
   restriction, and emergency vaccination, were put into force in the most
   affected areas of Lombardia and Veneto regions. These two regions also
   showed differences in terms of measures applied and timeliness of
   application. In this study we describe the epidemics and discuss the
   effectiveness of the IM put into effect. The regional surveillance
   systems provided the data on the epidemics and the IM description. The
   IM effectiveness was compared between the different epidemics and the
   Lombardia and Veneto regions, considering the number of farms involved,
   the duration of the epidemics, and the extension of the area affected.
   With regard to the IM applied, reductions in the number of outbreaks
   (from 388 in 2002-03 to 15 in 2005), the duration of the outbreaks (from
   more than 1 yr to similar to 1 mo), and the spatial extension of the
   outbreaks (from 89 to 8 municipalities involved) were observed. The
   emergency vaccination, depopulation, and pre-emptive slaughtering
   reduced significantly the spread of the epidemic. Comparing the dynamics
   of the epidemics, more effective results were observed in the Veneto
   region, where the IM were applied to a greater extent. Emergency
   vaccination and depopulation were effective in the eradication of the
   disease during an epidemic, but vaccination and farm density reduction
   showed the most effective results in controlling the spread of LPAI.},

Abstract = {Vaccination against avian influenza is recommended as a too] to support
   control measures in countries affected by avian influenza. Vaccination
   is known to increase the resistance of susceptible birds to infection
   and also to reduce shedding; however, it does not always prevent
   infection. Vaccinated infected flocks can therefore be a source of
   infection and thus be responsible for the perpetuation of infection.
   To avoid the spread of infection in a vaccinated population,
   immunization strategies must allow differentiation of infected from
   vaccinated animals (DIVA), combined with an appropriate monitoring
   system. Vaccinated exposed flocks must be identified and managed by
   restriction policies that include controlled marketing and stamping-out.
   Several vaccines and diagnostic tests to detect infection in vaccinated
   populations are available, the tests having various properties and
   characteristics. In order to achieve eradication, the most appropriate
   DIVA vaccination strategy must be identified and an appropriate
   monitoring programme be designed, taking into account risk factors, the
   epidemiological situation and the socioeconomic implications of the
   policy.},

Abstract = {Avian influenza (AI) is an Office International des Epizooties listed
   disease that has become a disease of great importance both for animal
   and human health. The increased relevance of At in animal and human
   health has highlighted the lack of scientific information on several
   aspects of the disease, which has hampered the adequate management of
   some of the recent crises. Millions of animals have died, and there is
   growing concern over the loss of human lives and over the management of
   the pandemic potential.
   The present article reviews the currently available control methods for
   notifiable AI infections in poultry. The application of control
   policies, ranging from stamping out to emergency and prophylactic
   vaccination, is discussed on the basis of data generated in recent
   outbreaks and in light of new regulations, also in view of the
   maintenance of animal welfare.
   Poultry veterinarians working for the industry or for the public sector
   represent the first line of defense against the pandemic threat and for
   the prevention and control of this infection in poultry and in wild

Abstract = {Avian influenza (AI) is a complex infection of birds, of which the
   ecology and epidemiology have undergone substantial changes over the
   last decade. Avian influenza viruses infecting poultry can be divided
   into two groups. The very virulent viruses cause highly pathogenic avian
   influenza (HPAI), with flock mortality as high as 100\%. These viruses
   have been restricted to subtypes H5 and H7, although not all H5 and H7
   viruses cause HPAI. All other viruses cause a milder, primarily
   respiratory, disease (low pathogenic avian influenza, LPAI), unless
   exacerbated by other infections or environmental conditions. Until
   recently, HPAI viruses were rarely isolated from wild birds, but for
   LPAI viruses extremely high isolation rates have been recorded in
   surveillance studies, particularly in feral waterfowl. In recent years,
   there have been costly outbreaks of HPAI in poultry in Italy, the
   Netherlands and Canada and in each of these countries millions of birds
   were slaughtered to bring the outbreaks under control. However, these
   outbreaks tend to have been overshadowed by the H5N1 HPAI virus,
   initially isolated in China, that has now spread in poultry and/or wild
   birds throughout Asia and into Europe and Africa, resulting in the death
   or culling of hundreds of millions of poultry and posing a significant
   zoonosis threat. Since the 1990s, AI infections due to two subtypes,
   LPAI H9N2 and HPAI H5N1, have been widespread in poultry across large
   areas of the world, resulting in a modified eco-epidemiology and a
   zoonotic potential. An extraordinary effort is required to manage these
   epidemics from both the human and animal health perspectives.},

Abstract = {An epidemiological and molecular survey of cystic echinococcosis (CE)
   caused by Echinococcus granulosus in the water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis)
   of the Italian Mediterranean breed was carried out in the Campania
   region of southern Italy. Out of a total of 799 water buffaloes examined
   at slaughterhouses, 80 (10.0\%) were found infected. The molecular study
   was performed on 58 hydatid cysts in order to determine the E.
   granulosus strain(s) present in this host. A region of cytocrome c
   oxydase 1 gene (CO1) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and the
   PCR products were then purified and sequenced. DNA amplification of the
   partial CO1 gene gave a 446 bp fragment for all isolates examined. After
   sequencing, a region of 419 bp was identified for each sample.
   Thirty-two isolates were identified as the common sheep strain G1, 15 as
   the buffalo strain G3, 3 as the Tasmanian sheep strain G2, and 3 as the
   G1 c genotype (GenBank AF458873). In addition, 5 isolates presented 99\%
   identity with the G2 genotype (Tasmanian sheep strain).},

Abstract = {Following the avian influenza (AI) epidemics occurring in different
   areas of the world, a surveillance program funded by the Italian
   Ministry of Health was implemented. In the framework of this program, an
   investigation of wild birds was carried out to assess the circulation of
   AI viruses in their natural reservoir. More than 3000 samples, mainly
   cloacal swabs, were collected from migratory wild birds belonging to the
   orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes. Samples were screened by means
   of a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
   (RRT-PCR), then processed for attempted virus isolation in embryonated
   fowl's specific pathogen-free eggs. Approximately 5\% of the samples
   were positive for type A influenza viruses by RRT-PCR, and from 14 of
   those samples AI viruses were isolated and fully characterized. The
   isolates, belonging to 8 different avian influenza virus subtype
   combinations (H10N4, H1N1, H4N6, H7N7, H7N4, H5N1, H5N2, and H5N3), were
   obtained from migratory Anseriformes.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of age and diet at

   litters from 18 to 45 days of age comparing two weaning age (25 vs. 34

   different energy, fat and starch concentration (HF: DE=11.5 MJ/kg,
   EE=6.2\%, Starch=8.7\%; LF: DE=10.1 MJ/kg DM, EE=3.1\%, Starch=11.3\%).
   At 45 d, early weaning determined a significant reduction of growth
   (1219 vs 1282; P < 0.01), although the solid feed intake resulted
   significantly higher, from 25 to 34 days of age, in early weaned rabbits
   (50.0 vs 29.8 g/d; P < 0.001). The age at weaning did not modify caecal
   traits, with the exception of pH value, that was lower in rabbits early
   moved to the mothers (5.53 vs 5.83; P < 0,05).
   Independently by age of weaning, the administration of diet HF promoted
   growth performance in rabbits at 45 d (1280 vs 1222; P < 0.01).
   Diet composition did not influence mortality rate at 34 days of age,
   while early weaning determined values significantly higher than those
   found in rabbits weaned later.
   The data of microbial analysis, carried out on 10 animals per diet (at
   25 and 34 days of age), showed potential pathogenetic microflora
   development depended by the age of animal and was not affected by the
   composition of diets.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of
   enterovirulent Escherichia coli strains in cheese manufactured in the
   Italian Alpine Region. Cheese samples obtained from raw and pasteurised
   milk were collected from cheese-making plants. Enumeration of E. coli
   and the presence of verocytotoxigenic (VTEC), enteropathogenic (EPEC)
   and enterotoxic (ETEC) E. coli were carried out. A multiplex-PCR for the
   amplification of the sequences of VT1, VT2, eae, ehxA, ST, LT genes was
   used to identify pathogenic E. coli strains. The presence of E. coli
   O157 was investigated using an immunomagnetic separation technique. E.
   coli 0 157 was not recovered in cheese made from raw or pasteurised
   milk. The multiplex PCR approach detected at least one virulence
   determinant in only ten cheese samples, in four of them, a
   verotoxin-producing gene (VT2 and/or VT1) was detected and in the
   remaining six only the attaching and effacing lesion genes (eae) were
   found. No ETEC strains were detected. The statistical analyses of the
   results demonstrated significant associations between the use of raw
   milk in cheese production and the presence of detectable virulence genes
   in cheese. Moreover, high E. coli counts were also associated with the
   use of raw milk in fresh and ripened cheese production. The results
   revealed the survival and recovery of pathogenic strains even after a
   60-day ripening period, highlighting the importance of the hygienic and
   sanitary requirements for milk used in the production of both fresh and
   ripened cheese.},

   each farm, faecal samples were collected from three to five asymptomatic
   buffalo calves, aged from 1 to 9 weeks (total number = 347). Each sample
   was tested for the presence of copro-antigens of C. paruum using a
   commercially available ELISA. Out of the 90 farms, 22 (24.4\%) resulted
   positive. With respect to animals, out of the 347 faecal samples, 51
   (14.7\%) were found to have antigens of C. parvum. The results of the
   logistic regression model showed a positive association between the
   positivity to C. paruum and the high number of buffaloes on farms.},

Abstract = {After a consultancy mission funded by a nongovernmental organization
   (NGO), information was collected on the dynamics of avian influenza (AI)
   infection at the rural level in a Vietnamese province with several
   ongoing outbreaks. AI outbreaks are frequent at village level due to
   environmental, ecological, agroecological, physical, social, and
   cultural factors, the underlying factor being poor hygienic conditions.
   Viral circulation is facilitated by the interactions of the integrated
   aquaculture, animal raising, horticulture agroecosystem, which relies in
   the peculiar integration of aquaculture (ponding), animal activities,
   and horticulture and by the connections with the live-bird market
   system. The interactions of these factors determine the complex system
   in which wild birds interact with domestic birds and in which people are
   constantly exposed to sources of infection, leading to the association
   between poverty and AI infection in humans. This experience underlines
   that despite all efforts by the Vietnamese Government, international
   institutions, and the NGO sector, awareness of AI at the village level
   needs to be improved. In turn, the leading institutions and
   international donors funding projects of technical cooperation aimed at
   tackling AI in Vietnam should invest in a system based on a deep
   knowledge of the practical problems of village condition to address AI
   with an effective approach. On the basis of the data collected during
   the mission, particularly on rural and semi-intensive poultry rearing
   systems, proposals that encompass the application of an effective
   vaccination strategy including backyard flocks coupled with
   dissemination of relevant information on biosecurity measures have been
   developed for decision makers.},

Abstract = {Aims: Multicentre evaluation of biochemical and molecular methods for
   the identification of Vibrio parahaemolyticus.
   Methods and Results: For the biochemical identification methods, API 20E
   and API 20NE and Alsina's scheme were evaluated in intra- and
   interlaboratory tests in order to determine the accuracy and concordance
   of each method. Both in intra- and interlaboratory tests, the Alsina's
   scheme showed the highest sensitivity (86\% of correct identifications
   in the interlaboratory test). False-positive results were obtained by
   all methods (specificity was 95\% for API 20E, 73\% for API 20NE and
   84\% for Alsina's scheme) and concordance varied from 65\% of API 20NE
   to 84\% of API 20E. For the molecular identifications, polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) for the detection of toxR gene, tl gene and pR72H
   fragment were tested on 30 strains by two laboratories. The PCR for toxR
   showed the highest inclusivity (96\%), exclusivity (100\%) and
   concordance (97\%).
   Conclusions: Among the biochemical identification methods tested, the
   Alsina's scheme gave more reliable results; however, in order to avoid
   false-positive results, all the biochemical identifications should be
   confirmed by means of molecular methods.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: Availability of an efficient
   identification method of Vibrio parahaemolyticus to use in official
   control of fisheries products.},

Pages = {1096-1099},
Abstract = {Correlation coefficients were evaluated between the theoretical cheese
   yield (ThCY), the real yield at 4 (FCY) and 28 h (28CY), the curd dry
   matter (CDM) and the relationships with the percentage of proteins and
   milk characteristics. Milk samples were collected every 50 days from 60
   buffaloes (326 samples) that were half-sibs (through paternal or
   maternal lineage ascertained by DNA test), bred in two farms. Positive
   correlations were found between FCY and 28CY and the enzymatic phase of
   coagulation and with the milk content in DM, proteins, casein and
   lipids. Negative correlations were found with lactose and urea milk
   content. These yields increased when the percentage of DM, proteins and
   hash of the curd were lower and that of lipids was higher. The 28CY is
   correlated with ThCY (r = 0.762; P < 0.01) and with the CDM (r = 0.809;
   P < 0.01). A high 28CY was also characterized by a high 28CY/\% proteins
   ratio and CDM/\% proteins ratio. The CDM was higher when the DM of milk
   and its content in proteins, casein and lipids were higher and when the
   content in lactose was lower. A correlation (r = 0.501; P < 0.01) was
   observed between the CDM and the DM percentage of the curd. For the
   other components the correlations found were the same as for the 28CY.
   The 28CY/\% proteins enhanced at the increasing lipid content of the
   milk (r = 0.417; P < 0.01) and at decreasing content in urea (r = -
   0.317; P < 0.01) and freezing point (r = - 0.123; P < 0.01). The CDM/\%
   proteins was positively influences by fat (r = 0.596; P < 0.01) and
   lactose (r = - 0.341; P < 0.01). The ThCY/28CY was negatively influenced
   by ``R{''} and by the pH value and positively correlated with the lipid
   content of milk.},

   The use of the new interoperability system strongly contributes, to the
   overcoming of drawbacks characterizing the previous versions, i.e.,
   misalignments among the different distributed databases and the low
   quality of managed data. Indeed, it saves the peculiarities of single
   regional realities and assures, at the same time, a unique data
   validation system.
   In 2002, the system was one of the first Italian system based on the web
   services technology involving the whole national territory. Nowadays, it
   is commonly used by thousands of users. Hence, it can be considered as
   an example of successful interoperability system having to provide
   service to the entire nation and working under heavy work load
   conditions.},

Abstract = {In order to support eradication efforts of avian influenza (AI)
   infections in poultry, the implementation of ``differentiation of
   infected from vaccinated animals{''} (DIVA) vaccination strategies has
   been recommended by international organizations. These systems enable
   the detection of field exposure in vaccinated flocks, and through this
   detection, infected flocks may be properly managed, thus interrupting
   the perpetuation of the infectious cycle. A promising system, based on
   the detection of antibodies to the nonstructural 1 (NS1) protein of AI,
   has been deemed a good candidate. However, there are presently no data
   available, in support of this DIVA system, with regard to the kinetics
   of antibody production against the NS1 proteins in poultry following
   infection. The present investigation was undertaken to establish the
   dynamics of the appearance of anti-NS1 antibodies in a naive population.
   Following experimental infection of turkeys, antibodies to a peptide
   spanning the c-terminal of the NS1 protein were detected by
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) starting between day 3 and day
   5 postinfection. In contrast, no antibodies to the NS1 peptide could be
   detected in chickens over the test period. In addition, the turkeys and
   chickens reacted differently at a clinical level to the infection by the
   H9N2 challenge virus. Taken together, these findings indicate that there
   is a significant difference in the viral replication in turkeys and
   chickens, resulting in a variation in the production of antibodies to
   NS1, as detected by the peptide-based ELISA used. This fact must be
   taken into consideration when using a DIVA system based on the
   identification of antibodies to the NS1 protein.},

Abstract = {The production and supply of reference reagents for the diagnosis of
   avian influenza (AI) is one of the duties of the World Organization for
   Animal Health reference laboratories. The lyophilized reagents are
   routinely shipped on dry ice to both national and international clients.
   In order to determine the effect of different short-term storage
   temperatures on the activity of AI reference reagents, vials containing
   lyophilized avian influenza A antigens and antisera preparations were
   maintained at 4 C, 22 C, and 37 C over a 21-day period. At days 0, 3, 7,
   14, and 21 the reagents were titrated using the hemagglutination test,
   the hemagglutination inhibition test, or the agar gel immunodiffusion
   test (AGID). All of the AI antigens that were kept at 4 C and 22 C
   retained hemagglutinating activity for at least 21 days, but when they
   were stored at 37 C several lost their hemagglutinating activity. All of
   the reference antisera tested were still able to inhibit
   hemagglutination after 21 days, and the antigen used in AGID also gave
   clear results after 21 days even after incubation at 37 C. Our results
   therefore indicate that lyophilized avian influenza antigens maintain
   their hemagglutinating activity at temperatures between 4 C and 22 C for
   at least 21 days, and both antisera and antigens prepared for AGID
   remain stable for 21 days between 4 C and 37 C. This information will
   allow for alternative shipping temperatures than those presently
   recommended, in addition to the short-term storage of these reagents at
   nonrefrigerated temperatures.},

Volume = {6},

Pages = {253-263},
Abstract = {Globally, rotavirus infection is the most important cause of severe
   diarrhea in infants and animals. In this report, we review the results
   of pathogenesys studies, strain surveillance and characterization
   studies published and discuss new insights gained from these studies on
   the potential mechanisms of the evolution and spread of new rotavirus
   strains. Early epidemiological studies in Italian buffalo herds revealed
   the predominance of strains with G8 specificity and detected strains
   with the rare, RRV-like, VP4 P{[}3] genotype. In an our previous study
   125 fecal samples were collected from buffalo calves affected with
   diarrhoea, in seven dairy farms in Southern Italy. Rotaviruses were
   detected in 21 samples (16.8\%) by an immunochromatographic assay and by
   reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Analysis of the VP7 gene revealed
   that 57\% (12 of 21) of the isolates were G6, 23.8\% were G8 (5 of 21)
   and 19\% (4 of 21) were G10. Analysis of the VP4 revealed that 71.4\%
   (15 of 21) of the isolates were P{[}5] and that 28.6\% (6 of 21) were
   P{[}1]. The most common combination of G and P types was P{[}5],G6
   (57\%), followed by P{[}1],G10 (19\%), P{[}5],G8 (14\%) and P{[}1],G8
   (9.5\%). While P{[}5],G6 rotaviruses are very common in Italian bovine
   herds, the antigenic combination Pill,G10 is unusual and presumably
   derives from reassortment between P{[}1] and G10 strains, that appear to
   be more frequent in buffaloes and bovines, respectively. The presence of
   bovine-like G and P serotypes suggests that in Italy the epidemiology of
   buffalo rotaviruses overlaps the epidemiology of bovine rotaviruses,
   presumably because of the strict species affinity and/or of the
   intermingled distribution over the same geographical areas of the
   buffalo and bovine herds.},

Abstract = {Vaccination against avian influenza infection caused by H5 or H7 virus
   subtypes has been used on several occasions in recent years to control
   and in some cases eradicate the disease. In order to contain avian
   influenza infection effectively, immunization should be combined with a
   coordinated set of control and monitoring measures. The outcome of an
   immunization campaign depends on the territorial strategy; whereas the
   capacity of the veterinary services in developed countries permits
   enforcement of strategies aimed at eradicating avian influenza, many
   countries currently affected by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)
   H5N1 viruses have a limited veterinary infrastructure and a limited
   capacity to respond to such epidemics. In these countries, resources are
   still insufficient to conduct adequate surveillance for identification
   and reaction to avian influenza outbreaks when they occur. When properly
   applied in this scenario, immunization can reduce mortality and
   production losses. In the long term, immunization might also decrease
   the prevalence of infection to levels at which stamping-out and
   surveillance can be applied. Countries should adapt their immunization
   programmes to local conditions in order to guarantee their efficacy and
   sustainability. In the initial emergency phase, human resources can be
   mobilized, with reliance on personal responsibility and motivation, thus
   compensating for potential shortcomings in organization. A more
   appropriate allocation of resources must be pursued in the long term,
   remembering that biosecurity is the main component of an exit strategy
   and must always be improved.},

Abstract = {Emergency vaccination for avian influenza (AI) infections caused by
   viruses of the H5 or H7 subtypes has been used in several instances over
   the past years. It has been applied primarily in the chicken and turkey
   industry with the general objective of controlling, and in some
   instances eradicating, infection. The use of vaccination as a tool to
   eradicate AI requires the enforcement of a coordinated set of control
   and monitoring measures. In fact, only certain attempts at eradicating
   AI with the support of vaccination have been successful, and the outcome
   of the vaccination campaign has been shown to depend greatly on
   effective application of the field strategy that complemented the
   vaccination program. While it is taken for granted that the product and
   companion diagnostic test are suitable for that given situation, a
   monitoring system must be in place to promptly identify whether
   vaccinated birds have been field exposed, and the latter should be dealt
   with in an appropriate manner, avoiding the spread of infection to other
   premises. Prophylactic vaccination could also become a tool for AI
   management in the European Union, provided that its application is based
   on a systematic assessment of AI risk. The correct use of this tool can
   be a valuable support for the control of AI in poultry, with the added
   value of limiting the economic losses to the industry and to the
   taxpayer. Eventually, this will also reduce human exposure to
   potentially dangerous viruses.},

Abstract = {During 2003-2005, 399 abortion samples (315 fetuses and 84 placentae)
   were collected from 107 ovine and caprine farms in northern Sardinia.
   Tissues from aborted fetuses and placentae were examined by PCR assay to
   detect DNA from Coxiella burnetii, Chlamydophila abortus, Salmonella
   enterica Serovar abortusovis, Toxoplasma gondii, and Neospora caninum.
   The DNA from at least 1 of these 5 infectious agents was amplified in
   41\% of ovine fetuses, while only 17\% of the caprine fetuses yielded a
   positive amplification result for at least 1 of the 5 agents. Out of a
   total of 366 ovine aborted samples, T. gondii DNA was detected most
   frequently (18.1\% of fetuses and 13.1\% of placentae), followed by S.
   abortusovis (13\% of fetuses and 14.4\% of placentae), C. burnetii
   (10.9\% of fetuses, of 9.2\% placentae), C. abortus (2.4\% of fetuses,
   6.5\% of placentae), and N. caninum (2\% of placentae). In 33 fetuses
   and 9 placentae, the simultaneous presence of pathogens with different
   associations was detected. Out of a total of 31 caprine aborted samples,
   T. gondii was detected most frequently (13\% of fetuses and 25\% of
   placentae), followed by C. abortus (12.5\% of placentae), C. burnetii

Abstract = {During the 1990s, several outbreaks of avian influenza (AI), caused by
   viruses of the H9N2 subtype, were reported in poultry in various parts
   of the world. Currently, this infection seems to be endemic in poultry
   in the Middle and Far East, and the extensive circulation of H9N2 in
   poultry represents a risk factor for infection of humans, because
   viruses of this subtype have been sporadically introduced into the human
   population. Little is known about the gene constellation of the H9N2
   viruses that are currently circulating in the Middle East; thus, gene
   sequences of eight IA viruses of the H9N2 subtype isolated in Jordan in
   2003 from poultry were analyzed. The results of this investigation show
   that all eight Jordanian isolates are closely related to each other and
   to other H9N2 isolates from the Middle East. Seven of eight genes of the
   Jordanian strains show a percentage of homology not higher than 95\%
   with the genes of two H9N2 strains, A/HK/1073/99 and A/HK/1074/99,
   isolated from humans in Hong Kong. The M gene is more closely related to
   the corresponding gene of the two H9N2 human isolates from Hong Kong
   (97.7-98.2\% homology). This homology suggests that the M gene of the
   Jordanian and human Hong Kong strains could derive from a common
   ancestor.},

Abstract = {The fluorescence polarisation assay (FPA) was evaluated for the
   serological diagnosis of bovine brucellosis in buffalo (Bubalus Bubalis)
   in southern Italy. This assay uses O-polysaccharide prepared from
   Brucella Abortus lipopolysaccharide conjugated with fluorescein
   isothiocyanate as a tracer. It has many methodological advantages over
   older, more established tests and can be performed in short time. To
   measure the fluorescence polarization, a Tecan GENios Pro (Prionics)
   fluorescence-polarization analyzer was used with the procedure described
   by Nielsen et al. 1996. A cut-off value of 117 millipolarization (mP)
   units was used for testing 912 buffalo sera from Campania Region (526
   positive sera and 386 negative sera according to the complement fixation
   test; CFT). All samples were tested with the Rose Bengal plate (RB).
   Sensitivity and specificity (Sn) for RB were 84.0\% and 87.8\% and for
   FPA were 92.6\% and 88.9 percent. The FPA gave a kappa coefficient of
   agreement with respect to CFT of 0.755, while RB (relative to the CFT)
   gave coefficients of 0,715. Finally, ROC analysis suggested a cut-off
   value which did not agree with the one recommended in the test procedure
   for cow.},

Abstract = {The effects of lambs separation and manual milking, which are stressors
   usually associated with the productive cycle of dairy sheep farm, were
   investigated by comparing short-term (24 h) adaptive responses in
   strongly versus weakly lateralized dairy ewes. Functional lateralization
   was scored with a series of behavioural tests (direction of free
   turning, direction of obstacle turning, preferential leg use in front of
   an obstacle) followed by a daily period of hormonal, biochemical and
   clinical parameters assayed on two groups of 6 strongly (SLS) and two
   groups of 6 weakly (WLS) lateralized ewes divided for lamb presence or
   separation. Differences were observed for several parameters as a
   function of the degree of lateralization score and stressors
   application. The results suggest that behavioural lateralization
   parameters should be taken into consideration as a crucial variable to
   understand stress responses and their modulation in relation to animal
   welfare.},

Abstract = {The effect of proximity on infected premises was evaluated during the
   highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) epidemic that struck northern
   Italy in 1999-2000 by quantifying the spatial and temporal clustering of
   cases. The epidemic was caused by an H7N1 subtype of type A influenza
   virus that originated from a low-pathogenic AI virus that spread among
   poultry farms in northeastern Italy in 1999 and eventually became
   virulent by mutation. More than 90\% of 413 infected premises were
   located in Lombardy and Veneto regions; of 382 outbreaks, 60\% occurred
   in the Lombardy region and 40\% in the Veneto region. Global and local
   spatial statistics were used to estimate the location and degree of
   clustering of cases with respect to the population at risk. Outbreaks
   were spatially clustered primarily in Lombardy, with a large cluster in
   Brescia province and another in Mantua province, on the border of
   Veneto. Time series analysis was used to assess the temporal clustering
   of outbreaks. Temporal aggregation increased during the first 5 wk and
   decreased thereafter (probably as a result of eradication measures
   enforced in the Veneto region). Spatio-temporal clustering was assessed
   considering the Temporal Risk Window (TRW), the time period during which
   premises remain infectious and infection can spread to neighboring
   premises. The clustering pattern was similar to the one detected when
   considering spatial clustering (i.e., the larger clusters were
   identified in the Brescia and Mantua provinces of Lombardy). These
   results highlight the role of proximity in the spread of AI virus and,
   when considering the TRW, indicate the possible direction of virus
   spread.},

Abstract = {The percentages of dry matter (DM), protein, casein, fat, lactose,
   solids-not-fat and ash of milk and the characteristics of the curd (31
   components and/or characteristics) were evaluated on 326 milk samples
   collected from 60 buffaloes every 50 days. The animals were half sib
   (same father or same mother ascertained by DNA test) and were bred in
   two farms. Relationships between the values of components and/or
   characteristics were also calculated. Significant relationships were
   found among DM percentage of milk and its components, cheese yield, curd
   characteristics, ratio between the studied cheese yields and protein
   percentage. Protein, casein and fat showed positive relationships,
   whereas lactose presented negative relationships. The association among
   proteins and real cheese yield or the dry matter of the curd that
   derived from 1 litre of milk (CDM), was lower than that with calculated
   cheese yield. This difference strongly decreased if proteins percentage,
   corrected for urea value, was utilized in cheese yield calculation. No
   relationship was found between proteins and urea in milk, but a direct
   relation was present between proteins and proteins adjusted for urea.
   This relation affects a correct estimation of cheese yield, because the
   percentage of true proteins in milk, corrected per urea was 4.52 vs.
   4.64.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the coefficients of correlation
   between curd chemical composition and milk characteristics, theoretical
   and real cheese yield and ratios between cheese yield and protein
   percentage. The analysis were performed on 326 milk samples collected
   from 60 half sib buffaloes, ascertained by DNA test, every 50 days. The
   percentages of dry matter, proteins and fat of the curd were inversely
   correlated to the curd firmness (a30), a low enzymatic phase of
   coagulation and low pH value. Percentage of dry matter in the curd was
   positively correlated with proteins, casein and fat of the milk and
   negatively with lactose. Furthermore, dry matter and proteins
   percentages are also positively correlated with theoretical cheese yield
   and its ratio with real cheese yield, curd dry matter from 1 litre of
   milk and the ratio between curd dry matter and protein percentage.
   Negative correlations were found with real cheese yield at 28 hours (r =
   - 0.100; P < 0.01) and its ratio with protein percentage. An inverse
   relationship was highlighted between curd proteins percentage and fat of
   either milk and curd, while a direct association was present with
   lactose. A higher protein percentage in the curd was linked to a lower
   cheese yield and a lower ratio between cheese yield and proteins. Ash of
   the curd, finally, showed similar association to those described for
   proteins.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to screen for Brucella spp. buffalo embryos
   produced in- vitro, by using cumulus oocytes complexes (COCs) recovered
   from ovaries of slaughtered buffaloes naturally infected with Brucella
   spp. Ovaries were collected from 5 female pluriparous buffaloes
   slaughtered in a local abattoir. EDTA-blood samples and nasal swabs
   collected from each animal were used for Brucella spp. DNA detection by
   real-time PCR. Buffalo ovaries (n = 10) were transported to the
   laboratory and maintained strictly separated throughout laboratory
   processing. Recovered COCs were matured, fertilized and cultured in
   vitro until day 7. Some immature COCs, all uncleaved COCs, all blocked
   cleaved embryos (2 to 16 cells) and all transferable embryos (tight
   morulae and blastocysts) were separately analysed by real-time PCR
   assay. Brucella spp. DNA was detected in both blood and nasal mucus of
   all subjects, whereas no trace of DNA of Brucella spp. was found on
   either COCs or embryos. Currently, the infected or seropositive
   buffaloes have to be slaughtered for sanitary reasons. Interestingly,
   the results of this preliminary trial suggest a possible utilization of
   the COCs from the infected subjects of high genetic value to obtain safe
   embryos.},

Abstract = {Eleven cattle farms, 8 layer farms, 7 broiler farms and 30 broiler meat
   samples were investigated in southeastern Italy throughout 2003 to
   evaluate the prevalence, the molecular type and antimicrobial resistance
   of thermophilic Campylobacters. A total of 398 samples were analysed.
   One Campylobacter isolate for each positive faecal swab and three
   isolates per positive broiler meat sample were selected for further
   analysis. Multiplex PCR was performed for species-level identification
   and PCR-RFLP of the flagellin A gene for genotyping. Resistance to 14
   antimicrobials was studied in 188 Campylobacter isolates. Prevalence of
   campylobacters was high both on farms (100\%) and in food samples
   (73\%). On 4/11 cattle farms and on 10115 poultry farms more than one
   species was isolated. The presence of more than one genotype was found
   on 8/11 cattle farms, on 10/15 poultry farms and in 8/22
   Campylobacter-positive food samples. High rates of resistance to
   quinolone were observed: 9/31 (29\%) C. jejuni bovine isolates, 4/22
   (18\%) C jejuni poultry isolates, and 14/26 (54\%) C. coli poultry
   isolates. Resistance to sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim was also observed
   frequently: 18/26 (69\%) of the avian C. coli strains, 25/31 (80\%) of
   the C. jejuni strains isolated from poultry and 15/22 (68\%) of those
   isolated from cattle were resistant. There was a significant difference
   between the rate of resistance to macrolides of C. coli and C. jejuni
   isolated in poultry, which amounted to 23\% and 3\%, respectively. This
   study provided data on the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of
   thermophilic campylobacters in south-eastern Italy and confirmed that
   flaA-typing is an efficient tool to study the epidemiology of
   Campylobacter strains in short-term investigations.},

   components and/or characteristics of milk samples collected every 50
   days from 60 buffaloes (326 samples and 14,344 values). The animals were
   half sib (same father or same mother) and were bred in two farms.
   Significant associations but with a low values of coefficient of

Title = {Milk and curd characteristics depending on farm and production level},
Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2, 2},
Pages = {1104-1107},
Abstract = {Here reported are data relative to the chemical
   composition/characteristics of the milk, of milk samples collected every
   50 days from 60 buffaloes (326 samples) that were half-sibs (through
   paternal or maternal lineage, ascertained by DNA test), bred in two
   farms (S.A. and M respectively n. = 27 and n = 33). The subjects were
   divided in relation to the productive level (> vs. < 2601 kg/lactation).
   The production level did not influence the theoretical yield (ThCY), the
   yield at 4 h (FCY) and at 28 h (28CY), the curd dry matter (CDM) and the
   ratios between ThCY and real yields (FCY, 28CY and CDM). Compared to the
   less productive subjects, despite similar percentage of proteins, the
   more productive subjects had a higher percentage of casein (3.73 vs.
   3.64; P < 0.05), a greater incidence of the latter on total protein
   (80.52 vs. 79.60; P < 0.05), higher content in lactose (4.88 vs. 4.81; P
   < 0.01) and urea (42.44 vs. 40.48; P < 0.05) and a lower BCS value (6.79
   vs. 7.25; P < 0.05). These differences are not always confirmed in both
   farms. Regardless of the production level, subjects of farm S.A. had a
   lower production/lactation (2524 vs. 2817 kg; P < 0.01), higher values
   of R and k20 (P < 0.01), lower value of a30, a higher SH value and lower
   contents in urea and solid not fat. They also showed a lower ThCY yield
   and a lower ratio between ThCY and 28CY when proteins were corrected for
   the urea content, and a higher ratio between 28CY and the percentage of
   proteins, both when corrected or not for the urea content. It is
   difficult to explain the influence of the production level on the casein
   content whereas the greater lactose content in more productive buffaloes
   may be accounted for by the greater persistence of lactation curve. The
   higher urea content found in buffaloes with a greater galactopoietic
   attitude may be due to a greater DM intake caused by the inadequacy of
   the diet, hypothesis confirmed by the lower BCS observed in the more
   productive subjects.},

Abstract = {Little work has been carried out on management techniques to reduce
   stress of first machine milking in ewes. The aim of this work was to
   evaluate the effect of milking parlour training before weaning on sheep
   milk yield and milk protein fractions. One week before weaning, an
   experimental group (EG) was introduced into the machine milking parlour
   and hand-milked once a day, to adapt them to the new environment and
   noise of the milking machine, while a control group (CG) was hand-milked
   once a day in a traditional fold parlour until weaning. After weaning,
   both groups were machine milked, separately, twice a day in the milking
   parlour. Milk yield and nitrogen fractions were recorded for the first
   10 days of machine milking. Differences between samplings within group
   were observed for all parameters considered. Only on the first day of
   machine milking, differences between groups occurred for total nitrogen,
   total protein and casein. Higher content of nitrogen fractions in the
   milk of EG was due to its lower milk production. In fact, daily
   production of nitrogen fractions was higher in CG than in EG. High
   variability for most parameters was observed during the first 5 days of
   machine milking in both groups. A week of training to machine milking
   parlour was not enough to reduce the negative effects of weaning and
   machine milking stresses on primiparous ewes. (interaction?).},

Abstract = {The sensory characteristics of raw-milk cheeses are linked to the
   cheese-making process, to the environmental factors as animal feeding
   and to the biochemical and microbiological composition of the milk. In
   this report we temped to characterize the microflora in the typical
   Sicilian historical cheese as Vastedda della valle del Belice.
   Each cheese was previous subjected to microbial isolation on specific
   media (M17 and MRS). The colony obtained on the solid medium were
   subject to biochemical tests and DNA extraction. The microbial diversity
   occurring in the strains was evaluated by PCR, RFLP and sequencing
   targeted on 16S ribosomal DNA. A number of closest relatives species of
   lactic and contaminating bacteria were identified in a total of 18
   cheeses. The more represented genus were: Enterococcus, Streptococcus,
   Lactobacillus, Lactococcus and Pediococcus. Moreover it was found only
   one strain Lactococcus lactis for producing bacteriocines. The different
   bacteria species probably could play a key role in the maturation of the
   cheese. The preliminary obtained data show the optimized method is
   usefully to detect and characterize the bacteria having implications in
   the fermentation process as well as preservation of traditional
   products.},

Abstract = {A group of 147 shelter dogs were weighted and assigned a body condition
   score (BCS) using a 9 point scale system, in order to evaluate the
   prevalence of obesity in the kennel. More than 60\% of the animals
   showed a BCS :6 (overweight and obese) and this condition was mainly
   attributed to an excess of carbohydrates and fat in the diet. In 67/147
   dogs, a blood sample was drawn and the effects of BCS, age and time
   spent in the shelter were evaluated on biochemical parameters. Obese
   dogs showed significantly higher levels of triglycerides (P<0.01), while
   increasing BCS determined only an increasing non significant trend on
   cholesterol values. Age influenced creatinine (P<0.05) and the oldest
   dogs scoring BC >= 6 registered significant higher NEFA (P<0.05) and CK
   (P=0.01) levels. Time spent in the shelter did not affect any parameter.
   The dogs' metabolic condition reflects the need of taking more care of
   the quality of feed administered in the shelters to avoid the negative
   health effects caused by chronic obesity.},

Abstract = {Probiotic supplementation to animal feeds has become a standard practice
   in the feed industry especially since European Union banned the use of
   antibiotics as growth promoters. The aim of this study was to isolate
   and characterize mainly lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from calves, that can
   be used as feed additive. For this purpose, bacterial strains were
   recovered from calf faecal samples and characterized using
   MicroLog((TM)) system, 16s rRNA gene sequencing and Riboprinter (TM)
   system.
   Major representative strains were evaluated for their potential
   probiotic activity in vitro. Of 145 strains isolated, 3 clonal strains
   were selected for their potential probiotic activity, namely
   Lactobacillus animalis DUP5009, Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei
   DUP13077 and Bacillus coagulans RiboGroup 189-444-S-1. In light of this
   result these clonal strains can be considered for develop new probiotic
   products for calves.},

Abstract = {During an oestrus synchronization trial on heifer and mixed-parity
   Mediterranean Italian buffaloes, some analyses on health parameters were
   performed to correlate them to reproductive performances (pregnancy rate
   and birth rate). Serum sampling were performed every year for two years
   to be used in serological techniques for the diagnosis of Chlamydia spp.
   (ELISA), Neospora (ELISA), BHV1 (ELISA gE glycoprotein) and BVDV
   (ELISA). On the total number of 465 observed buffaloes, the
   seroprevalence obtained for each disease has respectively been: 24 \%,
   25 \%, 25 \% and 22 \%. Specific antibodies were not spread over the 13
   farms in an homogeneous manner, farm prevalence differences are
   evidenced by high standard deviations in the mean farm seroprevalence:
   42 +/- 27.8, 26 +/- 26.9, 20 +/- 13.8, 9.8 +/- 21.1. Among the buffaloes
   which resulted seropositive to Chlamydia, 33 \% were pregnant, 32 \%
   were those with Neospora, 32 \% those with BHV1 and finally 29 \% of the
   animals positive to BVDV resulted pregnant. Taking into account the
   animals that delivered normally, 41 \% were positive to Chlamydia, 18 \%
   to Neospora, 18 \% to BHV1 and 19 \% to BVDV.},

Abstract = {The hypothesis that a single allometric relationship relating carcass
   lean protein (CLP) to whole body protein (WBP) can allow accurate
   estimates of CLP on pigs of different populations, sex and nutritional
   history, was tested. Three datasets of different origins were used. Data
   were representative of 548 pigs, castrated males and females, of 8 pig
   populations, serially slaughtered over ample empty body weight (EBW)
   ranges (from 22 to 217 kg). WBP and CLP ranged, respectively, from 2 to
   28 and from 1 to 16 kg. The pooled data were run and the following
   relationship was found: CLP=0.497{*}WBP1.021 (CV=0.062; rsd=0.501 kg).
   The residuals were subjected to ANOVA to test the effects due to
   dataset, pig population within dataset and sex; significant differences
   between datasets mean residuals (+0.095, SE=0.041; -0.258, SE=0.094;
   -0.116, SE=0.055 kg, P < 0.001) were observed. No differences due to sex
   and pig populations were found. The average residuals were low and only
   in few cases they differed from zero. Conclusions: CLP can be accurately
   predicted from WBP; the coefficients of this function are mainly
   influenced by the procedures of slaughtering, dissection, sampling and
   analysis.},

Title = {Epidemiological situation of Herpesvirus infections in buffalo herds:
   Bubaline Herpesvirus1 or Bovine Herpesvirus1?},
Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2, 2},
Pages = {845-849},
Abstract = {Information on the distribution and related epidemiological
   characteristics of herpesvirus infections, and in particular referring
   to Bovine Herpesvirus 1 (BoHV1) and Bubaline Herpesvirus 1 (BuHV1) in
   buffaloes, have to date not been reported. Different studies based on
   serological surveys and viral isolation describe the circulation of both
   infections in this species. The specific etiological attribution of the
   infections in sero-surveys can be uncertain because of antigenic
   cross-reactivity of these ruminant alpha-herpesvirus and therefore
   depends on the diagnostic techniques employed. For this, we proceeded in
   verifying the diffusion of the two infections in a buffalo population of
   Central Italy. The sample size for the number of herds to test was
   defined considering an expected prevalence >= 20\% and the number of
   heads to be tested within each herd was established using an expected
   prevalence of >= 25\% (absolute precision of 5\%, with 95\% confidence
   level). The 155 herds to test were those with no IBR vaccination
   history. A maximum of 15 random blood samples were collected within the
   >= 3 year age category. The same sampling criteria was adopted when cows
   were present on buffalo farms to study the possible role of this
   species. Through the combined use of gB-gE Elisa tests, we assigned a
   specific infection status, for the BuHV1 infection status
   (gB-pos/gE-neg), as confirmed by an experimental infection conducted by
   us inoculating buffaloes with the BuHV1 ``strain Metzler{''}, and for
   the BoHV1 status (gB-pos/gE-pos) as that observed for the infection in
   bovines. Prevalence of infection, based on the Elisa status of each
   animal, were estimated for the whole sample and within each herd.
   Furthermore, the selected farms were investigated for their numeric
   consistency, presence of bovines, occurrence of typical clinical
   herpesvirus disorders occurring during the year prior to sampling. The
   association of these factors with the infection status was verified
   using logistic linear regression models. Prevalence for all infection
   status were observed at population level with no statistical difference
   between them, while the highest prevalence obtained at herd level was
   that for the co-existence of the two infections within the same herd.
   From the linear regression analysis, only the numeric consistency was
   associated with herds positive for BuHV1 and BoHV1 infection.
   Concomitance of the two herpesvirus infection in buffaloes as well as in
   bovine herds should be kept in focus both in their diagnosis as well as
   in their control.},

Abstract = {Following the avian influenza epidemics that occurred in Italy between
   1997 and 2003, the Italian Ministry of Health in collaboration with
   veterinary authorities promoted, funded and implemented a national
   surveillance programme. The main objectives of the surveillance effort
   were to identify avian influenza viruses circulating in wild birds and
   to investigate the role of backyard poultry flocks in the dynamics of
   infection in a densely populated poultry area. Over 2 years (2004 to
   2006), 164 backyard flocks and 4083 wild birds (mainly migratory
   Anseriformes and Charadriiformes) were sampled in three regions in the
   North of Italy. Samples collected were screened by means of real-time
   reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and the positive samples
   were processed for attempted virus isolation in embryonated fowl's
   specific pathogen free eggs. At the end of the study period, 27
   low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses had been isolated from backyard
   flocks and 49 strains obtained from wild birds. Of these, 26 belonged to
   the H5 or H7 subtype and were closely related to contemporary
   low-pathogenic strains of Eurasian lineage. The findings confirm that
   backyard free-range farming is at high risk for avian influenza virus
   introduction, and confirm the role of wild waterfowl in the introduction
   and perpetuation of low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses during the
   winter season in Southern Europe.},

Abstract = {The study examined the effect of recombinant somatotropin (r-bST) on

   treatment groups: r-bST (n=10), treated, starting at the eighth
   postpartum week by injections of r-bST every 14 days; control (n=10),
   untreated. Cows were milked twice a day, recording milk production. Body
   condition scores (BCS) were monthly determined for each cow. Blood
   samples were collected twice a week from jugular vein and assayed by
   IGF-1 immunoassay. At the fifth r-bST injection, an estrous cycle was
   synchronized by two intramuscular injections of 0,15 mg of PGF2 alpha
   analogue (dcloprostenol; Dalmazin, Fatro, Italy) given 11 days apart and
   ovaries were daily examined by ultrasonography. Follicles were
   classified as small, medium, large. Milk yield significantly increased
   after r-bST treatment (P <= 0.05), remaining higher than control group.
   At the fourth postpartum month, BCS significantly increased in control
   group and at the end of the trial it was 2.30 in r-bST and 2.52 in
   control group (P <= 0.05). Treated cows had more serum concentration of
   IGF-1 and more small and medium follicles vs control ones. The first
   wave dominant follicle growth was similar. The start of the second
   follicular wave was earlier in r-bST treated cows.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to characterize the observed prevalence
   of tick-borne pathogens (TBP) in domestic animals in Sicily, Italy
   during 2003-2005. Serological (competitive ELISA and indirect
   immunofluorescence antibody, n = 3299) and DNA tests (polymerase chain
   reaction and reverse line blot, n = 2565) were conducted on horse,
   donkey, cattle, sheep, goat, pig and dog samples. Pathogens analysed
   included Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, Rickettsia, Babesia and Theileria
   species, and Coxiella burnetii. The most prevalent TBP were Anaplasma
   and Babesia species. The results reported herein suggested that cattle
   could serve as the major reservoir for Babesia and Theileria spp. while
   for Anaplasma spp. cattle, dogs, sheep and goats may be the most
   important reservoir species. These results expanded our knowledge about
   the prevalence of TBP in Sicily and provided information to understand
   the epidemiology of tick-borne diseases and may help to implement
   measures to diagnose, treat and control transmission to humans and
   animals in this region.},

Abstract = {Species like sheep and beef cattle are commonly raised in large herds
   and often on pasture with multiple sires joining the females for
   unrecorded natural insemination. This leads to offspring with multiple

   can be from multiple sires as well. Pedigrees from such populations are
   often problematic and need proper verification. The Pedverif computer

   carried out on 127 farms (epidemiological units), selected using a grid
   approach within a Geographical Information System, followed by
   proportional allocation. In each farm 6 buffaloes were examined in order
   to detect the louse presence. Parasitological examinations were
   performed on each buffalo at predilection sites. A total of 762 water
   buffaloes were examined. H. tuberculatus was found in the 11.0\%
   (14/127) of the farms and in the 4.5\% (34/762) of the animals. The
   presence H. tuberculatus should be routinely considered because it is a
   cause of serious health, production and economic damages in intensive
   breeding buffaloes.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to verify the ratio between real cheese yield
   at 28 hours and proteins, after values correction according to the
   regression analysis. Milk characteristics of subjects characterized by a
   28CY/protein ratio lower (Group A; n=212) or higher (Group B; n=108)
   than 56 were analysed by ANOVA in order to evaluate differences between
   the following milk characteristics: the lactodinamographic parameters
   (Forma-graph, Foss, DN); the complete physic-chemical composition; fat
   (F), protein (P), casein, lactose, ash, urea, pH and SH; the somatic
   cells content (SCC) using (Milkoskan); the total aerobic mesophilic
   flora (TAMF) by the dilution method. Chemical composition of the curd
   was also determined (protein, fat and ash; ASPA, 1995). The milk protein
   content was adjusted for the non proteic N content determined in milk as
   urea (corrected P); the theoretic cheese yield (ThCY) was obtained by
   the following formula: cheese yield =milk x{[}-0.88 + 3.50 x P(\%)+1.23
   x F(\%)] x 100 (-1) (Altiero et al., 1989) and the ratio between
   ThCY/FCY and ThCY/28CY were calculated. Other calculated variables were:
   FCY/Corrected P, 28CY/Corrected P, CDM/Corrected P. Regression analysis
   was carried out between real cheese yield at 28 hours/proteins ratio and
   28CY vs. all the parameters resulted different between the two groups of
   buffaloes. Real cheese yield at 28 hours/proteins ratio and 28CY were
   corrected and ANOVA was repeated on corrected data, in order to verify
   the modifications of the values. These correction reduced but did not
   eliminate the differences.},

Abstract = {The factors responsible for the clinical progress of visceral
   leishmaniasis (VL) in dogs have not been yet established. The starting
   hypothesis was the possibility of associating the changing level of a
   specific type of cytokines with the evolution of the infection towards
   infection-manifested disease or resistant behaviour. For this purpose
   the authors have established a connection between Leishmania load,
   cytokine mRNA accumulation, and the progression of the disease in
   naturally infected asymptomatic dogs. We made use of real-time (RT) PCR
   system to detect the expression of cytokine mRNA levels during all the
   phases of the infection. In particular, we measured the amount of
   parasites in samples such as blood, lymph nodes and skin, and the
   expression levels of IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-18
   cytokines in the blood. We employed different targeted real-time PCR
   assay on 40 naturally infected dogs, initially asymptomatic; 20 of these
   progressed to overt disease, and the 20 remaining dogs remained
   asymptomatic throughout the period of study (2 years). Two other groups
   included: 20 naturally infected dogs with clinical signs of VL, and 20
   healthy dogs living in a non-endemic area. All these animals were
   employed as positive and negative controls, respectively. The overall
   results obtained demonstrate that the simultaneous evaluation of
   parasites and cytokine levels represents a reliable tool for predicting
   disease development, and thus for choosing the best treatment for the
   asymptomatic form of the disease. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Perkinsosis is an infection of marine molluscs caused by the protistan
   parasites of the genus Perkinsus, which has been classified by the OIE
   as a disease that warrants notification. In the present study, we have
   applied a molecular genetic approach to develop an optional method for
   the specific identification of Perkinsus species.
   A species-specific polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length
   polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay of the rRNA ITS region was developed to
   identify and distinguish among Perkinsus species. A taxonomic key was
   established that allows successful identification of Perkinsus species
   using a single restriction enzyme (Rsa I) to discriminate P. chesapeaki
   and P. marinus or by a combination of two endonucleases (Rsa I plus Hinf
   I) to discriminate P. olseni and P. mediterraneus. In order to validate
   the RFLP assay, the PCR products were cloned and sequenced, and its
   phylogenetic affinity was determined. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed
   the specific identification carried out by RFLPs. Herein is the first
   report of P. olseni in Manila clams from the NW Adriatic Sea (Italy),
   which we identified by employing this method. The PCR-RFLP assay herein
   described may be useful to provide accurate, rapid and inexpensive
   identification of Perkinsus species, and may aid in ongoing
   epizooetiological studies and diseases control programmes. (c) 2006

Abstract = {Bacteriologic cytological and histological examinations of the mare's
   uterus are routine aids to detect infections, and they and diagnostic
   tools in infertility cases.
   Our work, carried out on 59 mares during the breeding season 2002, shows
   that the interpretation of the results is not always easy and univocal.
   Uterine bacteriologic swabs were performed at oestrus: regarding
   cytology samples, two methods of collection were compared: guarded swabs
   and uterine flushing. In case of a history of infertility, biopsy
   specimens were also collected from cytological results, when cells were
   collected with a guarded swab, mainly because of the low quality of the
   samples. A higher agreement was found with cytology samples obtained by
   flushing, and with histology. Our results show the importance of
   performing and comparing all the three types of examination in order to
   be able to express a diagnosis, especially in old mares or in mares with
   an unknown history of infertility, or in mares suspected of having
   endometrial pathologies.},

Abstract = {The rationale for establishing trade `regions' and `zones' is based on
   principles of epidemiological science and risk analysis that assess and
   manage animal disease risks so that the safety of trade can be ensured.
   However, the boundaries of geographical regions and zones may readily be
   breached through numerous epidemiological pathways. The concept of a
   `compartment' extends the application of a `risk boundary' beyond that
   of a geographical interface and considers all epidemiological factors
   that can contribute to the creation of an effective boundary. The
   fundamental requirement for application of either concept (regions/zones
   or compartments) is that the population considered for trade is
   maintained within management or geographical boundaries which allow
   clear epidemiological differentiation to be made between those animals
   and surrounding populations of higher risk. Seven factors are presented
   that an exporting country might use to guide the identification and
   documentation of a compartment. Additionally, the steps that would be
   undertaken to implement trade based on the compartmentalisation concept
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {An outbreak of giardiasis was observed in a sheep farm in Central Italy.
   Infected lambs (30-90 days of age) showed a malabsorption syndrome,
   decreased weight gain and impairment in feed efficiency. The most
   relevant clinical sign was the excretion of malodorous and poorly formed
   faeces, whereas diarrhoea was rarely observed in the flock. Laboratory
   investigations revealed the presence of Giardia in affected animals,
   while no other significant viral, bacterial or parasitic pathogens were
   identified in faeces or tissue samples. A mild to severe infiltrative
   enteritis with eosinophils, lymphocytes and plasma cells was detected in
   histological sections of the gut. Giardia parasites collected from
   duodenal aspirates were typed as Giardia duodenalis Assemblage B, by PCR
   amplification and sequencing of the TPI gene. Treatment with
   fenbendazole at a dose of 10 mg/kg for 3 consecutive days, successfully
   cleared the infection. These results show that G. duodenalis can cause
   significant economic losses in sheep farming. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All

   sera came from naive, vaccinated, infected and vaccinated-and-infected
   animals; two-thirds from cattle, the remainder from sheep and pigs. The
   assays were covariant for sensitivity, but not necessarily for
   specificity. A commercial kit from Cedi-diagnostics and an in-house
   assay from IZS-Brescia were comparable to the NCPanaftosa-screening
   index method described in the Diagnostic Manual of the World Animal

Abstract = {Gastric habronemosis of horses caused by Habronema microstoma and
   Habronema muscae (Nematoda, Spirurida) is characterized by catarrhal
   gastritis, diarrhoea, progressive weight loss and ulcers. Despite its
   importance in the equine industry and in clinical practice, knowledge of
   the epidemiology of this infection is still incomplete as diagnosis in
   live animals is challenging. A two-step semi-nested PCR assay using
   ribosomal DNA (rDNA) markers has recently been used for the molecular
   diagnosis in vivo of gastric habronemosis based on the detection of H.
   microstoma and/or H. muscae DNA in equine faeces. To evaluate the field
   efficacy of this assay, a molecular epidemiological survey was carried
   out on equid gastric habronemosis in central Italy. One hundred and
   fifty-three individual faecal samples were collected from live native
   horses and subjected to both coprological examination and the two-step
   semi-nested PCR. When flotation procedures were performed no horse
   tested positive for Habronema spp. larvated eggs while 96 animals
   (61.2\%) were positive for other endoparasites (i.e. strongyles,
   oxyurids, ascarids). Two-step semi-nested PCR detected 86 samples
   (53.6\%) that were positive for H. microstoma and/or H. muscae DNA. H.
   microstoma prevalences showed statistically significant differences; the
   highest prevalence was observed in horses infected by other
   gastrointestinal parasites and concomitantly by H. muscae. No
   statistical differences were found between the prevalence of Habronema
   spp. infection and sex, age, breeding management, and antiparasitic
   treatments. This field survey provided further information on
   habronemosis and its epidemiology. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {In doubtful cases, the histopathological diagnosis of lesions induced by
   Maedi Visna virus (MVV), a chronic multisystemic lentiviral disease of
   sheep, needs to be confirmed by the demonstration of MVV in the tissues.
   The influence of fixatives and the duration of fixation on the detection
   of MVV by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and PCR in paraffin-embedded
   tissues was assessed in lung samples with lesions in different degree,
   from five sheep serologically positive. Samples were fixed in 10\%
   neutral buffered formalin (NBF), Bonin's solution (BS) and a zinc
   salts-based fixative (ZSF), for different periods of time between 24 h
   and 30 days. The three fixatives preserved the morphology of the
   tissues, although in ZSF-fixed samples an increase in the number of
   desquamated cells was seen in the alveoli. Tissues showed a similar
   degree of immunolabelling, irrespective of the duration of fixation
   using ZSF and NBF fixatives. MVV nucleic acids could be detected in
   samples fixed up to 14 days in NBF and 30 days in ZSF. However. in BS
   fixed tissues, immunostaining was weak and non-specific signals were
   observed after 4 days of fixation. Amplification of proviral DNA could
   not be obtained by PCR in these samples. IHC detected viral antigens in
   all sheep whereas one sheep with mild lesions was always negative by
   PCR. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A sensitive and specific method based on high-performance liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS), for the
   simultaneous determination of lincomycin and five macrolide antibiotics

   Tris buffer 0.1 M, pH 10.5, and cleaned-up by a single solid-phase
   extraction step on OASIS HLB column. The chromatographic separation of
   analytes was performed on a Synergi Hydro-RP reversed-phase column using
   a gradient programme of aqueous 0.01 M ammonium acetate, pH 3.5, and
   acetonitrile as the mobile phase, at a flow rate 0.25 ml min(-1). The
   detection of analytes was achieved by positive ionization electrospray
   in multiple reaction-monitoring mode. Two characteristic transitions
   were monitored for each substance. The following analytical parameters
   were validated according to the guidelines laid down by European
   Commission Decision 2002/657/EC (European Commission 2002): linearity,
   specificity, decision limit (CC alpha), detection capability (CC beta),
   repeatability, within-laboratory reproducibility, recovery and

Abstract = {IS900 Nested-PCR was applied to milk from asymptomatic sheep and goats
   known to have a history of Johne's disease in order to detect the
   presence of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP).
   Experimental animals were from two MAP seropositive flocks (90 heads) in
   Piedmont, North-western Italy. During a 6-month period, milk samples
   were collected from 29 lambing and kidding animals (20 sheep and 9
   goats, five milk collections per animal). MAP DNA was intermittently
   recovered in milk samples from 13 out of 29 animals (44.8\% prevalence).
   MAP was particularly found in 9 out of 15 seropositive animals, and in 4
   out of 14 seronegative. Sensitivity of Nested-PCR was assessed by
   analyzing a serial dilution of MAP DNA. Results suggest that sheep and
   goats' raw milk may represent a potential vehicle for transmitting MAP
   to off-springs. Control measures could be usefully applied to small
   ruminants as already used for cattle. Taking into account the possible
   link between MAP, Crohn's disease and consumption of raw milk products,
   it is suggested that there should be more careful collaboration in
   veterinary and public health services, livestock breeders and dairy
   producers, as well as improved diagnostic tools for routine tests. (c)

Abstract = {An intracellular bacterium with the unique ability to enter mitochondria
   exists in the European vector of Lyme disease, the hard tick Ixodes
   ricinus. Previous phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences
   suggested that the bacterium formed a divergent lineage within the
   Rickettsiales (Alphaproteobacteria). Here, we present additional
   phylogenetic evidence, based on the gyrB gene sequence, that confirms
   the phylogenetic position of the bacterium, Based on these data, as well
   as electron microscopy (EM), in situ hybridization and other
   observations, we propose the name `Candidatus Miclichloria mitochondrii'
   for this bacterium. The symbiont appears to be ubiquitous in females of
   L ricinus across the tick's distribution, while lower prevalence is
   observed in males (44\%). Based on EM and in situ hybridization studies,
   the presence of `Candidatus M. mitochondrii' in females appears to be
   restricted to ovarian cells. The bacterium was found to be localized
   both in the cytoplasm and in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria
   of ovarian cells. `Candidatus M. mitochondrii' is the first bacterium to
   be identified that resides within animal mitochondria.},

Abstract = {A study was conducted to investigate the effect of a feeding
   supplementation with starter concentrate on ``Capretto{''} meat
   production and its qualitative characteristics. To this end, 31
   Girgentana kids, slaughtered at 59 days of age from two feeding groups
   (concentrate group (CG) and milk group (MG)) were utilised. Carcass
   measurements (body components, carcass joints, pelvic limb tissue
   composition, meat fatty acid composition and M. longissimus dorsi (LD)
   physical characteristics), body weight at birth, and at slaughter, were
   evaluated. The effect of concentrate supplementation did not influence
   the slaughter weight, slaughter and dissection data, tissue composition
   and meat chemical composition of the pelvic limb, and no differences
   were found for theological characteristics of LD meat, except
   cohesiveness values, which were higher (P < 0.05) in the CG kids.
   The effect of concentrate supplementation determined a significant
   variation of saturated fatty acids, which resulted higher for MG kids
   (41.77\% versus 38.43\%; P <= 0.05). In fact, goat milk had an
   unsaturated fatty acids (UFA)/saturated fatty acids (SFA) ratio that was
   0.25 lower than the fatty acid composition of concentrate (0.84). Litter
   size (single or twin) influenced many of the parameters studied
   statistically, probably because of the greater body weight of the single
   kids. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We investigated 116 Staphylococcus aureus isolates from cows, goats and
   sheep with intramammary infections (IMI) in Italy to provide information
   about the spread of enterotoxigenic strains and to compare strains
   isolated from different ruminant species. The isolates were typed by
   restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the
   coagulase (coa) gene, by analysis of polymorphisms of the X region of
   protein A (spa) gene and by detection of genes encoding enterotoxins
   (sea, seb, sec, sed, see, seg, seh, sei, sej and sel). Seven different
   coa types and 12 different spa types were distinguished. On the basis of
   polymerase chain reaction-RFLP, 29 different coa subtypes were
   identified. Two different coa subtypes accounted for 49\% and 67\% of
   bovine and ovine isolates respectively. Only seven coa subtypes were
   observed in isolates from more than one host species and no coa subtype
   was present in isolates from all three ruminant species. Furthermore, 85
   of the isolates (73\%) harboured at least one enterotoxin gene (se) with
   a predominance of sea, sed and sej among isolates from bovine IMI, and
   sec and sel among isolates from caprine and ovine IMI. Comparing the S.
   aureus isolates on the basis of gene polymorphisms and presence of se
   genes, significant differences were found in distributions of genotypes
   among isolates from cows, goats and sheep.},

Abstract = {Five European reference laboratories participated in an exercise to
   evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of their routinely employed
   RT-PCR tests and cell cultures for the detection and isolation of
   foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus. Five identical sets of 20 coded
   samples were prepared from 10 vesicular epithelia, which were derived
   from submissions from suspect cases of FMD or swine vesicular disease
   (SVD). Sixteen samples were derived from six FMD virus positive
   epithelia representing four different serotypes (two each of types O and
   A and one each of types Asia 1 and SAT 2), two from samples which had
   been found to be negative by antigen ELISA and virus isolation (VI) in
   cell culture and two from SVD virus positive epithelia. Some of the FMD
   virus positive samples were prepared from 10-fold serial dilutions of
   three of the initial suspensions. Each laboratory tested the samples by
   one or more of its available RT-PCR procedures and inoculated cell
   cultures that it routinely uses for FMD diagnosis in attempts to isolate
   virus, the specificity of which was confirmed by antigen ELISA. The best
   of the RT-PCR assays used in each laboratory gave comparable results
   while the sensitivity of cell cultures was variable from high in one
   laboratory, moderate in two and low in two others. This prototype panel
   of samples would appear suitable for external quality assurance of these
   tests but would benefit from the inclusion of more negative samples and
   an extension in the serial dilution range of one or more of the FMD
   positive sample titration series. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   vaccination of cattle},
Journal = {VACCINE},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {24},

Month = {OCT 30},
Abstract = {There has been much debate about the use of the so-called
   ``vaccinate-to-live{''} policy for the control of foot-and-mouth disease
   (FMD) in Europe, according to which, spread of the FMD virus (FMDV) from
   future outbreaks could be controlled by a short period of
   ``emergency{''} vaccination of surrounding herds, reducing the need for
   large-scale pre-emptive culling of at-risk animals. Since vaccinated
   animals may become subclinically infected with FMDV following challenge
   exposure, it is necessary to either remove all vaccinates
   (vaccinate-to-kill) or to detect and remove vaccinates in which virus is
   circulating or has established persistent infections
   (vaccinate-to-live), in order to rapidly regain the most favoured
   trading status of FMD-free without vaccination. The latter approach can
   be supported by testing vaccinated animals for the presence of
   antibodies to certain non-structural proteins (NSP) of FMDV, which are
   induced by infection with the virus, but not by vaccination with
   purified FMD vaccines. Using test sensitivity and specificity data
   established at a recent workshop on NSP assays {[}Brocchi E, Bergmann I,
   Dekker A, Paton DJ, Sammin DJ, Greiner M, et al. Comparative performance
   of six ELISAs for antibodies to the non-structural proteins of
   foot-and-mouth disease. Vaccine, in press], this paper examines the ways
   in which serological testing with NSP ELISAs can be used and interpreted
   and the effect that this will have on the confidence with which freedom
   from infection can be demonstrated within guidelines specified by the
   World Animal Health Organisation and the European Commission. (c) 2006

Abstract = {Bimoclomol (BIM), is a stress proteins coinducer, that acts
   synergistically with a mild stressor to activate cytoprotective stress
   proteins. BIM has been successfully utilized in animal models for the
   treatment of various nervous, cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases.
   Mercuric chloride (HgCl2) induces acute renal failure in rats by a
   single dosage. The present in vivo study was conducted to assess the
   efficacy of BIM against acute HgCl2 nephrotoxicity. At different times
   after BIM and/or HgCl2 exposure we evaluated renal morphology and the
   localization/abundance of three stress proteins (HSP72, GRP75, HSP60) by
   electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. BIM
   delivery to rats 6 h before mercury, ameliorated damage to renal
   ultrastructure, with recovery of tubular and mitochondrial membranes 24
   h after mercury treatment. In rats pretreated with BIM prior to HgCl2
   exposure, HSP72 was significantly overexpressed in proximal tubules in a
   time-dependent manner. In contrast, the amounts of GRP75 and HSP60 after
   BIM pretreatment were comparable to the group treated with mercury
   alone, but these stress proteins had translocated to the nuclei at 14
   and 24 h, respectively.
   These novel findings suggest that BIM mitigates HgCl2 nephrotoxicity in
   rats through the early recruitment of stress proteins in midcortical
   proximal tubules that are the main renal mercury-targets. (c) 2006

   analysed using a L. monocytogenes PCR detection kit and an
   anti-listeriolysin O IgG immunoassay kit. The combined use of these
   commercial kits allowed a rapid and effective detection of L.
   monocytogenes infection in both the early stage, before seroconversion,
   and in a later phase, even after antibiotic therapy. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {Organisms of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (TBC) are
   responsible for tuberculosis, a chronic disease which represents a
   serious public health problem in the world. The most common means of
   contracting the disease are through inhalation of aerosols, drinking of
   unpasteurised milk from an infected cow and the sharing of common water
   or feed sources.
   In this study a rapid, sensitive and reliable PCR-based method for
   specific detection of the Mycobacterium TB complex directly from raw
   milk samples was developed. The DNA extraction method was effective and
   able to remove inhibitors and allowed the isolation of amplifiable DNA.
   The procedure demonstrated the presence of the TBC mpb70 gene in 36/50
   (72\%) of Albanian milk samples tested. The study highlights the need to
   screen extracommunitarian milk to define an epidemiological background
   and to guarantee the quality of the raw milk in countries lacking a
   suitable TB-infection control plan. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Intensified official veterinary controls on warehouses supplying Chinese
   retailers resulted in the seizure of smuggled poultry products. Frozen
   and vacuum-packed frozen raw duck and chicken carcasses, and anatomic
   parts ( legs) of these species, were collected and processed for
   laboratory investigations aiming at the detection of avian influenza
   virus. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (
   RRT-PCR) targeting the M gene, performed on the lung and trachea from
   duck and chicken carcasses, yielded positive results. Virus isolation
   attempts in specific pathogen free embryonated eggs yielded an H10N7
   virus from the duck carcass. The isolate had an intravenous
   pathogenicity index of 0.0, and phylogenetic analysis revealed a
   nucleotide homology of 97 and 96\% with virus A/duck/Zhejiang/52/2000 (
   H5N1) for the PB2 and NS genes, respectively. The results of this study
   indicate that low-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses may be
   introduced into a country through trade of carcasses regardless of the
   non-systemic nature of this disease. The export ban applied to countries
   affected by the H5N1 epidemic may result in increased smuggling of
   poultry products, which remains one of the means by which influenza
   viruses can cross-national boundaries. Increased surveillance at borders
   and at a national level is recommended.},

Journal = {VETERINARY DERMATOLOGY},
Year = {2006},

Abstract = {Microsporum canis has been frequently isolated from human cases of tinea
   capitis and tinea corporis. The infection may be acquired from infected
   animals with cutaneous lesions but also from asymptomatic carriers or
   from the environment. As asymptomatic M. canis carriers are considered
   to be a critical factor in the epidemiology of dermatophytosis in
   humans, this study investigated the relationship between the presence of
   dermatophytes on the hair coats of dogs and cats without cutaneous
   lesions and the occurrence of the disease in their respective owners. A
   total of 136 dogs and 248 cats were sampled from January 1999 to January
   2005. Seventy-eight animals (22 dogs and 56 cats) belonged to
   individuals affected by tinea corporis caused by M. canis and 306 (114
   dogs and 192 cats) to individuals without dermatophytosis. Age, sex,
   breed, habitat and season were recorded for each animal and examined as
   potential risk factors. Dermatophytes were isolated from 20.5\% of the
   dogs and 28.2\% of the cats. Microsporum canis was isolated from 36.4\%
   of dogs cohabiting with owners diagnosed with tinea corporis but it was
   never isolated from dogs whose owners had no lesions. By contrast, M.
   canis was isolated from 53.6\% of cats cohabiting with owners diagnosed
   with tinea corporis and from 14.6\% of cats whose owners had no signs of
   the disease. These results clearly indicate that both cats and dogs
   should be considered as a major source of pathogenic dermatophytes for
   humans even when they do not present clinical signs of dermatophytosis.},

Abstract = {The pathogenesis of natural scrapie in Sarda breed sheep was
   investigated in 1050 asymptomatic and 49 sick sheep from
   scrapie-affected flocks. Central and peripheral nervous system, along
   with lymphoreticular system (LRS) tissues, were subjected to
   immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western-blotting (WB) for detection of
   pathological isoform of the prion protein (PrPSc). A total of 69 of the
   1050 clinically healthy sheep were found to be infected with scrapie,
   with PrPSc being detected in both the central nervous system (CNS) and
   enteric nervous system (ENS) plexuses of 60 of the sheep, while IHC and
   WB yielded evidence of (PrPSc) deposition only in lymphoid tissues of
   the remaining 9 clinically healthy sheep. PrPSc was also detected in the
   CNS, as well as in ENS plexuses from all of the 49 clinically affected
   sheep. Nevertheless, 18 of the 69 clinically healthy animals (26\%, 17
   ARQ/ARQ and 1 ARQ/AHQ sheep), along with 3 ARQ/ARQ sheep (6\%) of the
   clinically affected group, showed no IHC or WB evidence of PrPSc in

   plexuses. The study demonstrates dual CNS and ENS PrPSc deposition in
   Sarda sheep with scrapie, in spite of an apparent lack of lymphoid

Title = {Rapid detection and quantitation of Bluetongue virus (BTV) using a

Journal = {JOURNAL OF VIROLOGICAL METHODS},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {137},
Number = {1},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Bluetongue virus (BTV) is the causative agent of Bluetongue (BT) disease
   in ruminant livestock and occurs almost worldwide between latitudes 35
   degrees S and 50 degrees N; 24 serotypes of BTV are known of which 8
   circulate periodically within parts of the Mediterranean Region. A fast
   (about 3.5 h) and versatile diagnostic procedure able to detect and
   quantify BTV-RNA, has been developed using a Molecular Beacon (MB)
   fluorescent probe; PCR primers were designed to target 91 bp within the
   NS3 conserved region of the viral RNA segment 10 (S 10) and bracketed
   the MB fluorescence probe hybridisation site. The MB fluorescent probe
   was used to develop two Bluetongue serogroup-specific assays: a
   quantitative real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
   (RT-PCR) and a traditional RT-PCR. These were tested using BTV-RNAs
   extracted from the blood and organs of BT-affected animals, and from
   virus isolate suspensions. The samples included ten serotypes
   (BTV-1-BTV-9 and BTV-16); of these, BTV serotypes -1, -2, -4, -9 and -16
   have since 1998 been involved in the extensive outbreaks of BT across
   the Mediterranean Region. To evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of
   the MB probe, all positive samples (and negative controls) were tested
   using the developed quantitative real time RT-PCR and traditional RT-PCR
   assays. The former test had a detection limit of 10(3) cDNA molecules
   per reaction with a log-linear quantification range of up to 10(11) (R-2
   = 0.98), while the latter test was able to detect 500 cDNA-BTV
   molecules/PCR. The results show that the MB fluorescent probe is both
   rapid and versatile for the laboratory diagnosis of Bluetongue and for
   quantifying levels of viraemia in BTV-affected animals. An ``in
   silico{''} comparison of the primers and MB fluorescent probe used in
   this study showed that it is possible to detect all 24 serotypes of BTV.

Abstract = {The efficacy of danofloxacin (Advocin (R) A180) was evaluated for the
   treatment of contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP) caused by
   Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae. Ten healthy Angora goats,
   confirmed free of CCPP, were exposed to clinically affected animals from
   a natural outbreak in Thrace, Turkey. After 14 days exposure, 8 goats
   showed pyrexia (>= 41 degrees C). Shortly after, the Angora goats were
   divided randomly into two groups. Five of these were injected with
   danofloxacin (6 mg/kg subcutaneously), which was repeated after 48 h;
   the five remaining animals received saline. Goats were monitored
   clinically and blood samples were collected for serology. Animals with
   severe disease were withdrawn from the trial. Goats completing the study
   were euthanized at day 42. Lung tissue and bronchial fluid were
   collected for mycoplasma isolation. All danofloxacin-treated goats
   showed resolution of clinical disease by the end of the trial. Two
   saline-treated goats failed to complete the study owing to CCPP.
   Danofloxacin-treated goats showed fewer lung lesions and had
   significantly lower combined clinical scores than saline controls (p <
   0.001). Danofloxacin was found to be highly effective in the treatment

Title = {Tubular stress proteins and nitric oxide synthase expression in rat

Abstract = {Stress proteins such as HSP70 members (HSP72 and GRP75) and
   metallothionein (MT) protect the kidney against oxidative damage and
   harmful metals, whereas inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) regulates
   tubular functions. A single dose of mercuric chloride (HgCl2) can cause
   acute renal failure in rats, its main target being the proximal tubule.
   Oxidative damage has been proposed as one of its pathogenic mechanisms.
   in this study we tested whether melatonin (MEL), a powerful antioxidant
   compound, is effective against HgCl2 nephrotoxicity. Rats were treated
   with saline, HgCl2 (3.5 mg/kg), MEL (5 mg/kg), and MEL + HgCl2 and
   examined after 24 hr for HSP72, GRP75, MT, and iNOS by
   immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Tubular effects of the
   treatment were then characterized by ultrastructure. In the HgCl2 group,
   all markers were overexpressed in convoluted proximal tubules and
   sometimes in distal tubules. In the MEL + HgCl2 group, GRP75 and iNOS
   decreased in convoluted and straight proximal tubules, whereas HSP72 and
   MT persisted more than the saline and MEL-only groups. Tubular damage
   and mitochondrial morphometry were improved by MEL pretreatment. In
   conclusion, the beneficial effect of MEL against HgCl2 nephrotoxicity
   was outlined morphologically and by the reduction of the tubular
   expression of stress proteins and iNOS. These markers could represent
   sensitive recovery index against mercury damage.},

Volume = {99},

Abstract = {Investigations were undertaken on Taenia multiceps to determine if
   genetic variation was present within the parasites of Sardinia (Italy).
   Forty samples were obtained from various locations of Sardinia and
   deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted. Polymerase chain reaction
   (PCR) was performed on NADH dehydrogenase I (ND1) and cytochrome c
   subunit 1 (CO1) mitochondrial genes and amplicons were then sequenced
   and aligned with Bioedit software. Pairwise comparison between the NDI
   sequences of the T multiceps isolates showed differences ranging from
   1.27 to 2.54\% using an isolate obtained from Wales as an outgroup,
   while COI sequences showed within the samples coming from Sardinia a
   lesser degree of variability, ranging from 0.22 to 0.67\%. Considering
   the two genes, it was possible to define at least three specific genetic
   variants in Sardinian samples, which we have termed Tm1, Tm2, and Tm3.
   This is the first description of genetic variability in T multiceps.
   Further investigations will be required to understand to what extent the
   genetic variability described in this paper would be reflected also in
   phenotypic differences.},

Abstract = {Thirteen orf virus isolates obtained during the time period between 1995
   and 2004 from crusted scab lesions of nine sheep and four goats from
   different geographical areas of Greece and Italy with suspected
   contagious ecthyma infection were analyzed. DNA of all isolates was
   successfully amplified by PCR with the primers 045F-0458 and identified
   them as parapox virus. Partial DNA sequence of orf virus interferon
   resistant (VIR) gene, phylogenetic analysis of the available isolates
   and amino acid comparison of the interferon resistance protein encoded
   by this genomic region was carried out. According to the results of the
   present report a precise characterisation of the genomic region studied
   might provide evidence for the genetic variation and movement of the
   circulating orf virus strains. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights

Abstract = {To protect public health from bovine spongiform encephalopathy, European
   Commission Regulation EC 1139/2003 on monitoring programs and specified
   risk material requires that as of 1 October 2003, each member state has
   in place a sampling plan with an appropriate laboratory test to detect
   central nervous system (CNS) tissue in bovine head meat harvested at
   slaughterhouses or cutting plants. With this study, we wanted to
   evaluate the accuracy and reliability of an enzyme immunoassay, the
   RIDASCREEN Risk Material 10/5, in targeting a CNS-specific marker, the
   glial fibrillary acidic protein. A receiver operating characteristics
   curve was plotted to identify the best cutoff of CNS concentration.
   Reliability was calculated by Cohen's kappa on data from two diagnostic
   sessions. Test performance showed high sensitivity and specificity (97.9
   and 97.4\%, respectively) for a cutoff value between positive and
   negative at a CNS concentration of 0.049\%; reliability of test
   precision was also very good. When these criteria are applied, the
   RIDASCREEN Risk Material 10/5 test appears to be a reliable tool for
   monitoring CNS tissue contamination in meat. This diagnostic procedure
   should therefore be recommended for national application in monitoring
   programs.},

Abstract = {Avian influenza, listed by the World Organization for Animal Health
   (OIE), has become a disease of great importance for animal and human
   health. Several aspects of the disease lack scientific information,
   which has hampered the management of some recent crises. Millions of
   animals have died, and concern is growing over the loss of human lives
   and management of the pandemic potential. On the basis of data generated
   in recent outbreaks and in light of new OIE regulations and maintenance

Abstract = {The incidence of dead on arrival (DOA) birds was surveyed over 33
   broiler, 11 turkey, and 19 spent hen abattoirs representing the majority
   (around 70\%) of the Italian poultry slaughter plants. Data were
   recorded monthly during a 4-yr period (August 2001 to July 2005),
   considering a total of 1,266 million chicken broilers, 118 million
   turkeys, and 54 million spent hens, which represent 67.7, 84.0, and
   28.4\% of the national production, respectively. The overall average
   incidence of DOA was found to be 0.35, 0.38, and 1.22\% in broilers,
   turkeys, and spent hens, respectively. The season significantly (P <=
   0.01) influenced the mortality of all considered poultry categories,
   with higher incidence being observed during the summer (0.47, 0.52, and
   1.62\% for broilers, turkeys, and spent layers, respectively). The
   incidence of DOA broilers was found to be lower in small slaughter
   plants compared with medium and large slaughter plants (0.28 vs. 0.38
   and 0.35\%, P <= 0.01). The data obtained in this study might be used
   for establishing limit values of DOA as a welfare indicator during the
   preslaughter time of birds, including catching, loading, transportation,
   and lairage.},

Abstract = {Trichinella sp. infection has been documented in both humans and animals
   in most Mediterranean countries, yet in the past 60 years no infections
   have been reported on the Mediterranean islands. We describe the first
   outbreak of Trichinella sp. infection to have been reported on the
   island of Sardinia. The outbreak occurred in two villages in 2005 and
   involved 11 persons who had eaten raw sausages made from the same
   free-ranging sow. All 11 persons developed signs and symptoms of
   trichinellosis and seroconverted within 48 days of consuming the
   infected meat. The etiological agent was Trichinella britovi. Sardinia,
   like all Mediterranean islands, had been considered to be
   Trichinella-free. The present report, together with a recent report of T
   britovi infection in animals on the nearby island of Corsica (France),
   raises questions as to the validity of the concept of Trichinella-free
   areas or regions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Genotyping of Salmonella strains is an important tool to discriminate
   among isolates and to improve epidemiological studies when an outbreak
   occurs. No phagetyping scheme is available for Salmonella enterica
   subsp. enterica serovar Abortusovis (SAO) and molecular methods
   previously used were not standardized and were time consuming. Among the
   DNA-based methods of genotyping, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
   is currently in use to subtype Salmonella isolates. In this study we
   evaluated the feasibility of genotyping of SAO by XbaI and BlnI
   restrictions. Separation of restricted fragments was performed by PFGE.
   To test the possibility to apply this methodology to epidemiological
   investigation, a collection of 38 SAO strains isolated in different
   regions of Italy were analyzed. Eighteen and 29 different PFGE profiles
   were defined for XbaI and BlnI digestions, respectively.
   The method demonstrated an adequate typing ability and an excellent
   discriminatory power. Results from this study show that PFGE may
   represent a powerful tool to discriminate within the SAO serovar, and
   provide useful information in support of traditional epidemiological
   investigations. In particular, this method could be used to identify the
   origin of infection during outbreaks within a single flock or in
   different herds. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {116},
Number = {1-3},

Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {In August 2000, bluetongue virus (BTV) appeared for the first time in
   Sardinia and, since then, the infection spread across Sicily and into
   the mainland of Italy involving at the beginning serotypes 2 and 9 and
   then, from 2002, 4 and 16. To reduce direct losses due to disease and
   indirect losses due to new serotype circulation, the 2004 Italian
   vaccination campaign included the modified-live vaccines against BTV-4
   and 16 produced by Onderstepoort Biological Product (OBP), South Africa.
   Few months after the end of the campaign, BTV-16 was reported broadly in
   the country and the need of differentiating field from the BTV-16
   vaccine isolate became crucial. In this study, the gene segments 2, 5, 6
   and 10 of both the Italian and vaccine BTV-16 strains were sequenced and
   their molecular relationship determined. As sequences of segment 5 were
   those showing the highest differences (17.3\%), it was possible to
   develop a new diagnostic tool able to distinguish the Italian BTV-16 NS1
   gene from that of the homologous vaccine strain. The procedure based on
   the use of a RT-PCR and the subsequent sequencing of the amplified
   product showed a high degree of sensitivity and specificity when samples
   from either BTV-16 vaccinated or infected sheep were tested. (c) 2006

Abstract = {Two groups of sheep were experimentally infected by intratracheal route
   with two small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) isolates belonging to
   different genotypes (It-561 genotype A3 and It-Pi1 genotype 132).
   Seroconversion was evaluated using recombinant homologous and
   heterologous matrix protein/capsid antigen fusion protein. Results
   clearly indicate that seroconversion against homologous antigen was
   detected well in advance as regards heterologous antigen in both groups,
   although the advantage of using homologous antigen was less evident in
   detecting seroconversion against the caprine arthritis encephalitis
   virus (CAEV)like strain, compared with the maedi-visna virus (MVV)-like
   infection. Commercially available ELISAs detect CAEV-like seroconversion
   earlier than MVV-Iike infection suggesting a closer relationship between
   CAEV-Iike isolate and the antigen used in the latter ELISA tests. Seven
   recombinant subunits developed from matrix protein and capsid antigen of
   strain K1514 (prototype A1) were used to better define the antibody
   response in sheep infected with It-561 isolate. Two animals clearly
   reacted against type specific epitopes in the early stage of infection.
   This study highlights the relative insensitivity of gag encoded
   cross-reacting epitopes during the early stage of infection and suggests
   the development of novel diagnostic tests based on both genotype
   specific antigens. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {LPS tolerance is characterized by a reduced sensitivity to subsequent
   challenge of LPS. In human and mouse models LPS tolerance is closely
   associated with marked unbalanced production of leukocyte-derived
   inflammatory mediators which, when overexpressed, led to septic syndrome
   and shock. Here we characterized the in vitro induction of LPS tolerance
   in porcine CD14+ spleen cells in order to give insights into LPS
   tolerance in pigs. Following LPS stimulation, TNF-alpha and, to a minor
   extent, IL-8 production showed a significant reduction in CD14+ spleen
   monocytes that were pretreated with LPS in comparison to naive cells,
   while IL-1 beta production was slightly influenced by LPS stimulation
   and it was not affected by subsequent LPS challenge. Our findings showed
   that porcine CD14+ cells undergo a process, which resembles LPS
   tolerance, providing evidence that swine represent a valuable and useful
   model to perform experiments to study LPS tolerance and its biological
   significance. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Between 2001 and 2004, 229 foxes, 36 stone martens and 48 badgers from
   the western Italian Alps were examined for sarcoptic mange and for
   gastrointestinal helminths to investigate their prevalence and
   geographical distribution and to point out the existence of potential
   interactions among them. Sarcoptic mange was observed in 25.3 +/- 2.8\%
   SE of foxes and in 5.6 +/- 3.8\% SE of stone martens, while no badger
   was found infected. Helminths belonged to Cestoidea Cyclophillidea (3.0
   +/- 1.1\% SE), Nematoda Trichurida (Capillaria aerophila and Trichuris
   vulpis: 6.5 +/- 1.6\% SE; Trichinella britovi: 3.0 +/- 1.1\% SE),
   Ascaridida (12.2 +/- 2.2\% SE) and Strongylida (6.9 +/- 1.7\% SE).
   Sarcoptic mange infection and the presence of helminths proved to be
   associated, with mangy foxes showing significantly higher prevalence of
   both cestode and nematode (particularly Ascaridida) worms. Moreover,
   considering three clusters of parasites (S. scabiei, nematodes and
   cestodes), more foxes than expected hosted simultaneously 2 and 3 taxa.
   These evidences suggest the existence of some kind of interaction, whose
   modalities and implications are discussed in this paper.},

Abstract = {Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is the prototype of a postinfectious
   autoimmune neuropathy. Molecular mimicry between glycolipid antigens
   expressed by an infective antigen such as Campylobacter jejuni and the
   human peripheral nerve has been hypothesized to be the causative
   mechanism of GBS. However, only 1/1000 of C jejuni enteritis develops
   GBS. This emphasizes the importance of host-related factors in the
   development of the disease.
   HLA studies in GBS failed to show an association or gave conflicting
   results but MHC class I and 11 process and present peptides to T
   lymphocytes making unlikely that the HLA system plays a role in GBS with
   autoantibodies against self-gangliosides.
   CD1 molecules are MCH-like glycoproteins specialized in capturing and
   presenting a variety of glycolipid to antigen-specific T cells. There
   are five closely linked CD1 genes in humans located in chromosome I
   (named CD1A, B, C, D, and E) all showing limited polymorphism in exon 2
   which codifies for the alpha 1 domain of CD I molecules. The nucleotide
   substitutions in CD I B and CD I C are rare and reported to be silent.
   In 100 controls and 65 GBS patients (21 with a recent C jejuni infection
   and 35 with anti-glycolipid antibodies) we used direct sequencing by
   polymerase chain reaction to genotype exon 2 of CD1A, CD1D and CD1E
   genes.
   CD1D is monomorphic in both controls and patients whereas CD1A and CD1E
   are biallelic in exon 2. Subjects with CD1E{*}01/01 genotype are 2.5
   times more likely to develop GBS, whereas subjects with CD1A{*}01/02 or
   CD1E{*}01/02 have a reduced relative risk by 3.6 and 2.3 times
   respectively. The combination of CD1A{*}01/02 and CD1E{*}01/02 reduces
   by 5 times the risk of developing GBS.
   Although a correlation between CD1E{*}01/01 genotype and recent C.
   jejuni infection or presence of antiganglioside antibodies was not found
   the overall findings indicate that susceptibility to develop GBS is
   associated with polymorphisms of CD1E and CD1A genes. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) is the causative agent of ovine
   pulmonary adenocarcinoma (OPA). The expression of the JSRV envelope
   (Env) alone is sufficient to transform a variety of cell lines in vitro
   and induce lung cancer in immunodeficient mice. In order to determine
   the role of the JSRV Env in OPA tumorigenesis in sheep, we derived a
   JSRV replication-defective virus (JS-RD) which expresses env under the
   control of its own long terminal repeat (LTR). JS-RD was produced by
   transiently transfecting 293T cells with a two plasmid system, involving
   (i) a packaging plasmid, with the putative JSRV packaging signal
   deleted, expressing the structural and enzymatic proteins Gag, Pro, and
   Pol, and (ii) a plasmid which expresses env in trans for JS-RD particles
   and provides the genomes necessary to deliver JSRV env upon infection.
   During the optimization of the JS-RD system we determined that both R-U5
   (in the viral 5' LTR) and the env region are important for JSRV particle
   production. Two independent experimental transmission studies were
   carried out with newborn lambs. Four of five lambs inoculated with JS-RD
   showed OPA lesions in the lungs at various times between 4 and 12 months
   postinoculation. Abundant expression of JSRV Env was detected in tumor
   cells of JS-RD-infected animals and PCR assays confirmed the presence of
   the deleted JS-RD genome. These data strongly suggest that the JSRV Env
   functions as a dominant oncoprotein in the natural immunocompetent host
   and that JSRV can induce OPA in the absence of viral spread.},

Title = {Progressive truncation of the Non-Structural 1 gene of H7N1 avian
   influenza viruses following extensive circulation in poultry},
Journal = {VIRUS RESEARCH},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {119},
Number = {2},
Pages = {171-176},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In order to support eradication efforts of avian influenza (AI)
   infections in poultry, the implementation of ``DIVA:' vaccination
   strategies, enabling the Differentiation of Infected from Vaccinated
   Animals have been recommended by international organisations. A system,
   based on the detection of antibodies to the Non-Structural 1 (NS1)
   protein of AI has been proposed but the success of such a system lies in
   the conservation of the NS 1 protein among different Al isolates. With
   this in mind, the ns1 gene of 40 influenza A viruses isolated from a
   spectrum of avian species was sequenced and compared phylogenetically.
   The isolates included both low pathogenicity (LPAI) (n = 22) and highly
   pathogenic (HPAI) (n = 18) viruses of the H7 subtype and were
   representative of the avian influenza viruses that circulated in
   Northern Italy from 1999 to 2003. Size variation in the predicted
   an-lino acid sequence of each NS1 was revealed with two different levels
   of carboxy-terminal truncation being observed. Of the 40 isolates
   analysed. 16 had a full-length NS1 protein of 230 aa, 6 had a truncated
   protein of 220 aa and 18 had an intermediate truncation resulting in a
   protein of 224 aa. All of the H7N1 HPAI isolates possessed the
   intermediate carboxy-terminal truncation. In addition, all of the H7N1
   LPAI viruses circulating at the beginning of the epidemic had a full
   length NS1 while those circulating towards the end of the period had a
   truncated protein. To determine whether modifications to NS1 could be a
   result of laboratory manipulation, two strains (A/ty/Italy/977/99 and
   A/ck/Italy/1082/99) with a full length NS1 were inoculated into
   10-day-old embryonated chicken and 12-day-old embryonated turkey eggs
   via the allantoic route for 20 blind passages and sequenced at passages
   3, 10, and 20. No truncation was observed following these,serial
   passages. To determine whether the truncation involved an immunogenic
   region of the NS 1 protein a peptide spanning residues 219 aa to 230 aa
   was synthesized and tested in an indirect ELISA against sera obtained
   from turkeys experimentally infected with a virus strain known to have a
   full length NS I protein. The peptide proved to be immunogenic
   highlighting the fact that the variations of the NS1 protein presented
   in this work must to be taken into consideration when developing a
   diagnostic test based on the identification of antibodies to the NS1
   protein. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Two hundred and forty kennel and privately owned dogs were tested for a

   DNA was extracted from individual faecal samples. All the DNA extracts
   were analysed with a PCR assay specific for a similar to 400-bp fragment
   internal to the gene encoding for the Cryptosporidium oocyst wall
   protein. The prevalence was 3.3\% and it was higher in kennel dogs and
   in dogs with gastrointestinal symptoms. Cryptosporidium parvum was
   detected by sequencing analysis in six kennel dogs and one privately
   owned dog, and Cryptosporidium canis was detected in one kennel dog.
   This is the first investigation on the prevalence of Cryptosporidium in
   Italian dogs and has pointed to the existence of genotypes that may be

Abstract = {Red deer Cervus elaphus of the endangered populations from Sardinia and
   Mesola Wood, northern Italy, were analysed for genetic variation at 531
   bp of the mitochondrial control region and 12 polymorphic nuclear
   microsatellite loci. A phylogenetic analysis was conducted including
   additional data from the literature to gain insight into the
   phylogeographical origin of the Sardinian subspecies C. e. corsicanus.
   Microsatellite variation was low in both populations but Sardinia showed
   comparatively high variability at the control region. Management
   recommendations are discussed. In particular, the Mesola red deer, the
   only remaining indigenous Italian population, ought to be managed to
   increase the effective population size and should be subdivided into two
   or more populations. As to the phylogeography of the Sardinian
   population, microsatellite data favoured mainland Italy as the place of
   origin in that Sardinia and Mesola showed the smallest distance values
   and were paired together in trees with high bootstrap support. However,
   the mitochondrial data only partially confirmed this conclusion but
   showed great similarity between Sardinian and Spanish red deer. Possible
   explanations for this discrepancy and general limits of mitochondrial
   sequences in resolving demographic and biogeographical processes of the
   recent past are discussed. (c) 2006 The Linnean Society of London,

Abstract = {A case of unilateral seminoma with visceral metastases in a Mallard duck
   (Anas platyrhynchos) is reported. The right testis was markedly
   enlarged. The liver surface showed multifocal to coalescent regular
   circular umbilicated greyish-white spots. In addition, multiple rough
   whitish nodules were evident on the pancreas and the visceral peritoneum
   lining the intestine. Histologically, the right testicular parenchyma
   was diffusely affected and replaced by neoplastic growth, consisting of
   sheets of large round to polyhedral cells with conspicuous vesicular
   nuclei having distinctly granular chromatin and prominent nucleoli.
   Sheets of cells with similar features were observed also in the other
   affected organs. Multiple lung metastases were detected on histology.
   This is the first known report of seminoma with hepatic, pancreatic,
   pulmonary and peritoneal metastases in a Mallard duck.},

Abstract = {Staphylococcal food poisoning (SFP) is a very common foodborne disease.
   Milk and dairy products are frequently contaminated with enterotoxigenic
   Staphylococcus aureus, which are often involved in SFP. These foods may
   become contaminated owing to subclinical staphylococcal mastitis or
   during handling, storage and trade. For sanitary purposes, an effective
   approach is to detect the staphylococcal enterotoxins directly in foods,
   rather than detect, count and type the isolated S. aureus strains,
   because the toxin is the causative agent of foodborne illness. This
   paper illustrates a cell-based bioassay that uses the PEB (bovine embryo
   lung cells) cell line to detect staphylococcal enterotoxin type A (SEA)
   directly from artificially contaminated ricotta cheese. The test was
   able to detect SEA in the contaminated samples after 24 and 48 h of
   incubation at 37C, while results were uncertain when the samples were

Abstract = {Samples of mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were collected from
   natural beds on the Adriatic Sea in front of Ancona Province (Marches,
   Central Italy) officially recognized for human consumption. The Mussels
   were analyzed to evaluate the prevalence of Aeromonas spp. pathogenic
   strains. Out of 144 samples, 32 Aeromonas strains were isolated and 12
   showed virulence and enterophatogenicity on mice. Isolates were also
   examined to check their sensitivity to different antimicrobial agents.
   All isolates were sensitive to imepenem, neomycin, ciprofloxacin,
   tetracycline, oxytetracycline, doxycicline, chloramphenicol, polymyxin
   B, and colistin sulfate, but resistant to penicillin, carbenicillin,
   cephalotin, sulfamethoxazole, lincomycin, novobiocin, and rifampicin.
   Multiple resistance to antimicrobial agents with different mechanism of
   action was observed. Owing to the high occurrence of pathogenic
   Aeromonas strains, the risk of developing human infections by eating raw
   or undercooked Mussels is envisaged. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Bovine Prion (PrP) and Doppel (Dpl) proteins expression after in vitro

Abstract = {It has been postulated that Doppel (DpI) and Prion (PrP) proteins have
   yet undetermined interactions, since DpI is overexpressed in transgenic
   PrP-deficient mice. In this study we investigated the expression levels
   of DpI and PrP on lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils (PMNs) isolated
   from bovine blood and incubated (2 and 18 h) with TNF alpha, IL-1, IL-2,
   IL-8, C5a, IFN gamma, anti-PrP, and anti-DpI antibodies by flow
   cytometry. The isolation procedures yielded cell populations with high
   purity, viability and recovery rates. After 2 h incubation, expression
   of PrP or DpI was altered only in PMNs. These cells overexpressed PrP
   when incubated with TNF alpha and IFN gamma, and both PrP and DpI when
   incubated with C5a; incubation with TNF alpha, IL-8 and IFN gamma led to
   down-regulation of DpI. Lymphocytes incubated for 18 h with IL-2 and
   with IFN gamma overexpressed DpI. Incubation with the anti-PrP antibody
   induced down-regulation of DpI in PMNs after 2 h and overexpression of
   DpI in lymphocytes after 18 h. The differences recorded after 2 h were
   likely due to redistribution of pre-existing PrP or DpI molecules, while
   those seen at 18 h were most probably due to increased protein
   synthesis. The variations seen using the different activators depend on
   different receptors and/or signaling pathways. These results demonstrate
   that is possible to alter the expression of DpI and PrP in blood cells
   in vitro by incubation with either cytokines or anti-PrP antibodies.
   This opens an interesting opportunity to study the biology of these
   proteins using in vitro systems.},

Abstract = {A Bayesian method was developed to handle QTL analyses of multiple
   experimental data of outbred populations with heterogeneity of variance
   between sexes for all random effects. The method employed a scaled
   reduced animal model with random polygenic and QTL allelic effects. A
   parsimonious model specification was applied by choosing assumptions
   regarding the covariance structure to limit the number of parameters to
   estimate. Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms were applied to obtain
   marginal posterior densities. Simulation demonstrated that joint
   analysis of multiple environments is more powerful than separate single
   trait analyses of each environment. Measurements on broiler BW obtained
   from 2 experiments concerning growth efficiency and carcass traits were
   used to illustrate the method. The population consisted of 10 full-sib
   families from a cross between 2 broiler lines. Microsatellite genotypes
   were determined on generations I and 2, and phenotypes were collected on
   groups of generation 3 animals. The model included a polygenic
   correlation, which had a posterior mean of 0.70 in the analyses. The
   reanalysis agreed on the presence of a QTL in marker bracket
   MCW0058-LEI0071 accounting for 34\% of the genetic variation in males
   and 24\% in females in the growth efficiency experiment. In the carcass
   experiment, this QTL accounted for 19\% of the genetic variation in
   males and 6\% in females.},

   was to assess the pathogenic potential of the strains the gulls carry
   and shed into the environment and to gain a better understanding of the
   microbial pollution of the area they live in. Only one E. coli strain
   was rhamnose - (Rh), (biotype 8). All the other strains were Rh + with a
   prevalence of biotypes 30 and 31. Overall, the antimicrobial
   susceptibility tests showed a low level of antibiotic resistance. The
   findings suggest that the gull population does not have a heavy impact
   on the microbial nature of the Bay of Gallipoli and that the area does
   not present a high level of microbiological pollution.},

Abstract = {C. jejuni and C. coli isolated on three layer farms during the

   typical restriction patterns were detected for C. coli (H, O, R), 5 for
   C. jejuni (I, P, Q, T, S) and 8 were common for both. The D profile was
   present in all three flocks. C fla-type was detected on farms A and B.
   The results of the study suggest that some genotypes tend to prevail and

Abstract = {Long-chain n - 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly
   docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been shown to be essential during
   peri-natal growth and development of mammals. The study was conducted to
   determine whether the inclusion of fish oil in dairy goats diet during
   late gestation and early lactation would increase the proportion of n -
   3 PUFAs in colostral and mature milk. From 3 weeks before kidding
   throughout 42 days of lactation, 14 dairy goats were fed either a
   control diet or a diet containing 1.1\% fish oil (FO). Dietary treatment
   did not affect main components of colostrum, but lowered percentages of
   fat and lactose in mature milk. In colostrum, FO supplementation lowered
   the proportions of C 18:0, C 18:2, C 18:3 and elevated those of C16:1
   and very long-chain n - 3 PUFAs, mainly EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and
   DHA. In mature milk, FO supplementation lowered the proportion of C 18:0
   and raised C 16:1 and n - 3 PUFAs (C 18:3, EPA and DHA). Estimated
   transfer efficiencies for EPA and DHA into mature milk were 14 and 7\%,
   respectively. Results suggest that goat's colostrum and milk can be
   enriched in n - 3 PUFAs by maternal dietary fish oil supplementation
   during late gestation and early lactation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Aims: To develop a rapid, cost-effective and selective Alexandrium DNA
   extraction procedure from environmental samples in order to provide
   good-quality template for the downstream PCR-based detection assay.
   Methods and Results: In this study, we tested a DNA extraction method
   based on silica-coated, superparamagnetic nanoparticles conjugated to a
   DNA-capture sequence (probe) complementary to a specific region of 5.8S
   rDNA of the genus Alexandrium. Cultured Alexandrium catenella cells were
   used as the harmful algal bloom species for the DNA extraction. Then, a
   PCR assay was performed with primers specific for the genus Alexandrium
   to assess the specificity and sensitivity of the nucleic acid extraction
   method. This method was applied to both cultured and field samples,
   reaching in both cases a detection limit of one A. catenella cell.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that the use of probe-conjugated
   paramagnetic nanoparticles could be effective for the specific
   purification of microalgal DNA in cultured or environmental samples,
   ensuring sensitivity and specificity of the subsequent PCR assays.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: The DNA extraction method
   optimized in this study represents a progress towards the rapid and
   efficient direct detection of Alexandrium cells in seawater monitoring.
   In fact, this method requires no other equipment than a magnet and a
   hybridization oven and, in principle, can be adapted to different toxic
   microalgal species and can be automated, allowing the processing of a
   high number of samples.},

Abstract = {The expression of Stat3 (signal transducer and activator of
   transcription 3) in normal and neoplastic feline mammary gland tissue
   was assessed by immunohistochemistry in 72 cats. The samples included 3
   normal nonlactating mammary tissues, 17 hyperplastic lesions (11 lobular
   and 6 fibroepithelial) and 52 neoplasms (5 benign and 47 malignant). For
   immunohistochemistry, tissue sections were incubated with anti-Stat3
   monoclonal antibody and visualized with EnVision-DAB polymer. Stat3
   positivity was assessed in a semiquantitative manner. Normal mammary
   tissue showed occasional cytoplasmic and nuclear positivity, although
   the number of positive cells was lower than in the hyperplastic
   specimens. In neoplastic tissue, high numbers of neoplastic cells with a
   moderate to intense cytoplasmic and nuclear positivity were observed.
   Selected variations in the staining pattern correlated with malignancy.
   Moreover, a positive association was seen between the histological grade
   and the Stat3 score (p < 0.0001; correlation coefficient 0.750). A
   linear regression model showed a positive association between mitotic
   count and Stat3 expression (p < 0.001). These results further support
   published data found in humans regarding to the relation between the

Abstract = {At the beginning of 2005, an outbreak of ceruminous otitis has been
   observed in a breeders flock belonging to the Robusta Lionata breed, a
   native chicken breed reared in a Centre for the valorisation and
   conservation of native poultry breeds. The disease caused a high
   morbidity rate (90\% of birds), whereas the mortality affected only 10\%
   of the birds. The death of the birds was preceded by clinical signs,
   such as worsening of the ceruminous otitis with abundant secretion of
   bad-smelling cerumen, lack of appetite and depression. The otitis
   externa, mainly bilateral, was the only evident finding at necropsy.
   Laboratory examinations showed only the presence of Mycoplasma synoviae,
   either by isolation on culture media or by PCR, on ear and choana
   samples. Aspergillus fumigatus was detected only in one bird. In this
   paper, the Authors report for the first time on an outbreak of
   ceruminous otitis in native chicken breeds and point out that the only
   pathogenic agent isolated from the birds has been Mycoplasma synoviae.},

Abstract = {A 9-year-old, male French Bulldog was examined for a subcutaneous mass
   located at the site of a microchip Implant. Cytologic examination of the
   mass was suggestive of a malignant mesenchymal neoplasm. Histologically,
   the mass was confirmed as a high-grade infiltrative fibrosarcoma, with
   multifocal necrosis and peripheral lymphoid aggregates. By
   immunohistochemistry, the sample was investigated for vimentin,
   smooth-muscle actin (SMA), CD3, CD79 alpha, and CD18. All the neoplastic
   cells were positive for vimentin. Scattered cells at the periphery of
   the lesion were also positive for SMA, highlighting a myofibroblastic
   phenotype. The lymphoid cells were positive for CD18 and CD3. No
   aluminum deposits were detected by the aurintricarboxylic acid method. A
   diagnosis of fibrosarcoma morphologically similar to feline
   postinjection sarcomas was made. Fibrosarcomas at the site of injections
   have been reported in dogs and ferrets. Furthermore, neoplastic growth
   at the site of microchip implant in dog and laboratory rodents has been
   described.},

Title = {In planta production of two peptides of the Classical Swine Fever Virus
   (CSFV) E2 glycoprotein fused to the coat protein of potato virus X},
Journal = {BMC BIOTECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUN 22},
Abstract = {Background: Classical Swine Fever (CSFV) is one of the most important
   viral infectious diseases affecting wild boars and domestic pigs. The
   etiological agent of the disease is the CSF virus, a single stranded RNA
   virus belonging to the family Flaviviridae.
   All preventive measures in domestic pigs have been focused in
   interrupting the chain of infection and in avoiding the spread of CSFV
   within wild boars as well as interrupting transmission from wild boars
   to domestic pigs. The use of plant based vaccine against CSFV would be
   advantageous as plant organs can be distributed without the need of
   particular treatments such as refrigeration and therefore large areas,
   populated by wild animals, could be easily covered.
   Results: We report the in planta production of peptides of the classical
   swine fever (CSF) E2 glycoprotein fused to the coat protein of potato
   virus X. RT-PCR studies demonstrated that the peptide encoding sequences
   are correctly retained in the PVX construct after three sequential
   passage in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Sequence analysis of RT-PCR
   products confirmed that the epitope coding sequences are replicated with
   high fidelity during PVX infection. Partially purified virions were able
   to induce an immune response in rabbits.
   Conclusion: Previous reports have demonstrated that E2 synthetic
   peptides can efficiently induce an immunoprotective response in
   immunogenized animals. In this work we have showed that E2 peptides can
   be expressed in planta by using a modified PVX vector. These results are
   particularly promising for designing strategies for disease containment
   in areas inhabited by wild boars.},

Abstract = {This article sets out the results of air quality biomonitoring along a
   transect bordering on the A32 Turin-Bardonecchia motorway (Italy). The
   results were obtained using aeroponic sampling units, an innovation
   insofar as the plants acting as monitor live and grow in these units
   above ground, assuring that atmospheric pollutants are absorbed only
   through the leaves. The accumulation of 15 polynuclear aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs) on the leaves of Brassica oleracea var. Acephala,
   used as biosampler, was determined on samples taken in the months of
   February, July and October 2002, in each case after two months'
   exposure. The results highlight: (i) the influence of the seasons on the
   accumulation of pollutants, (ii) that phenanthrene, fluoranthene, pyrene
   and chrysene generally account for more than 80\% of total PAHs, (iii)
   that the data may be considered representative of both volatile and
   non-volatile compounds. Comparison with other sampling methods are
   supplied and discussed.},

Title = {The challenge of avian influenza to the veterinary community},
Journal = {AVIAN PATHOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Pages = {189-205},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Avian influenza ( AI) is a listed disease of the World Organisation for
   Animal Health (OIE) that has become a disease of great importance both
   for animal and human health. The increased relevance of AI in the fields
   of animal and human health has highlighted the lack of scientific
   information on several aspects of the disease, which has hampered the
   adequate management of some of the recent crises. Millions of animals
   have died, and there is growing concern over the loss of human lives and
   over the management of the pandemic potential.
   The present paper aims to identify areas of knowledge of veterinary
   competence that need to be improved in order to generate information to
   support the global AI crisis, and highlights the major changes in AI
   legislation, including regulations related to trade. It also reviews the
   human health implications of AI, including the mechanisms by which a
   human pandemic virus may be generated, and the food safety issues
   related to this infection. The application of control policies, ranging
   from stamping out to emergency and prophylactic vaccination, are
   discussed on the basis of data generated in recent outbreaks, and in the
   light of new regulations, also in view of the maintenance of good animal
   welfare.
   Poultry veterinarians working for the industry or for the public sector
   represent the first line of defence against the pandemic threat and for
   the prevention and control of this infection in poultry and in wild
   birds. However, given the current situation, it is imperative that close
   collaboration is sought and achieved by health officials involved in the
   veterinary, agricultural and medical aspects of the disease. Only
   through the exchange of data, experiences, views and information will it
   be possible to combat this zoonosis, which represents a major threat to
   public health and animal well-being.},

Abstract = {Background: The increased sophistication of imaging techniques in
   veterinary medicine allows the detection of a wide variety of
   intracranial and intraspinal lesions; however, imaging often does not
   provide a definitive diagnosis for nervous system (NS) lesions. Cytology
   is emerging as a useful diagnostic tool for obtaining a fast and
   accurate assessment of NS lesions, but little information is available
   for dogs and cats. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to assess
   the accuracy of cytologic evaluation of squash samples from NS lesions
   in dogs and cats and to consider cytology-based diagnostic guidelines
   and sources of misdiagnosis. Methods: Cytologic specimens from masses
   localized in the central and peripheral NS taken during surgery or
   postmortem examination were classified into 3 groups according to the
   final histopathologic diagnosis: Group 1 = completely correct diagnosis,
   when the cytologic diagnosis and final histologic diagnosis were exactly
   correlated; Group 2 = partial correlation, when the cytologic diagnosis
   only partially correlated with the final histologic diagnosis, and Group
   3 = no correlation, when the cytologic diagnosis was incorrect and there
   was no correlation with the general histologic type of lesion. The
   diagnostic accuracy of cytopathology was calculated by considering the
   histopathologic diagnosis as the ``gold standard,{''} and calculating a
   95\% confidence interval (CI). Results: A total of 42 animals (33 dogs
   and 9 cats) were included in the study. The cytologic diagnoses were
   classified in Group 1 for 32 cases (76\%; 95\% CI 0.63-0.89), in Group 2
   for 6 cases (14\%; 95\% CI 0.04-0.25), and in Group 3 for 4 cases (10\%;
   95\% CI 0.006-0.18). Considering both complete and partial correlation
   as an adequate result, cytologic diagnosis was satisfactory in 90\% of
   biopsies. Conclusions: Although the current series of cases is
   relatively small, cytologic evaluation of squash preparations can be
   considered a fairly accurate and reliable tool in the diagnosis of NS
   lesions.},

Title = {Stability of stored canine plasma for hemostasis testing},
Journal = {VETERINARY CLINICAL PATHOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {35},

Abstract = {Background: A review of the literature revealed limited information
   about the stability of samples for coagulation testing in dogs.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the stability of
   individual coagulation factors, clotting times, and other parameters of
   hemostasis; in stored canine plasma. Methods: Citrated plasma samples
   were obtained from 21 dogs. Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial
   thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen concentration, and factor I, II,
   V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII activities were measured on an
   automated coagulation analyzer with commercially available reagents.
   Antithrombin (AT) activity and D-dimer concentration were measured on an
   automated chemistry analyzer using validated kits. Samples were analyzed
   within 1 hour after collection (initial analysis) and once daily for 2
   or 4 consecutive days following storage at room temperature (RT) or 4
   degrees C, respectively. Results: Storage time at either temperature did
   not have any effect on PT, factor 11, V, VII, X, or XII activities,
   D-dimer concentration, or AT activity. In contrast, aPTT was
   significantly prolonged after 72 and 96 hours at 4 degrees C; fibrinogen
   concentration was decreased after 48 hours at RT; the activities of
   factors VIII and IX were decreased after 48, 72, and 96 hours at 4
   degrees C; and factor XI activity was decreased after 72 hours at 4
   degrees C. Conclusions: Results suggest that storage of canine plasma
   for 2 days at RT does not have a significant effect on hemostasis test
   results with the exception of a slight decrease in fibrinogen
   concentration. In contrast, aPTT and factors VIII, IX, and XI were
   unstable in refrigerated plasma after 48 or 72 hours of storage.},

Abstract = {A real time quantitative PCR assay based on TaqMan (R) technology was
   developed for orf virus (ORFV) DNA quantification in clinical samples,
   infected cells and organotypic cultures. This method was based on the
   amplification of a 70 bp fragment from the ORFV B2L gene (orthologue of
   the Vaccinia virus Copenhagen F13L gene) that encodes the major envelope
   protein. Both intra- and inter-assay variability were well within +/-
   0.25 log10 S.D. showing the high efficiency and reproducibility of the
   assay. The TaqMan (R) PCR was subsequently used to determine the titre
   of several batches of the ORFV strain NZ-2, with it being possible to
   quantify virus solutions in the range of 1 x 10(1) to 1 x 10(6)
   TCID50/ml. A good correlation between the titre determined by the TaqMan
   (R) PCR and by conventional endpoint dilution was found. The PCR assay
   is reproducible and can be used for a rapid quantification of ORFV in
   vitro and ex vivo, being readily achievable within 1 h. (c) 2005

Abstract = {We describe a case of listeriosis in Italy associated with the
   consumption of cheese. Opened samples of two brands of gorgonzola
   (Italian blue-veined cheese; referred to as brands ``B{''} and ``C{''})
   were collected from the patient's refrigerator. Unopened samples of the
   brand suspected to be the source of infection (brand B) were taken from
   the store where the cheese had been purchased, other local stores, and
   the production plant. Listeria monocytogenes serotype 1/2b was isolated
   from the patient and from the opened and unopened cheese samples. The
   contamination level varied from <100 to 1,200 cfu g(-1). Molecular
   typing of the isolates, using both randomly amplified polymorphic DNA
   (RAPD) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), demonstrated that
   the isolates from the patient's refrigerator, food stores, and
   production-plant samples were indistinguishable from the clinical
   isolate. Molecular typing verified the peristence of closely related L.
   monocytogenes isolates in the production plant B for 5 months. The
   results stress the importance of developing a code of hygienic practice
   for preventing, limiting, and where possible, eliminating this pathogen
   in processed foods and of educating at-risk persons on foods likely to
   be contaminated.},

Title = {Phylogeny of the subgenus Culicoides and related species in Italy,

Abstract = {Biting midges of the genus Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) include
   vectors for the economically important animal diseases, bluetongue (BT)
   and African horse sickness (AHS). In the Mediterranean Basin, these
   diseases are transmitted by four species of Culicoides: the first three
   belong in the subgenus Avaritia Fox and are Culicoides imicola Kieffer,
   Culicoides obsoletus (Meigen) and Culicoides scoticus Downes and Kettle;
   the fourth is Culicoides pulicaris (Linnaeus) in the subgenus Culicoides
   Latreille. In the Palaearctic Region, this subgenus (usually referred to
   as the C. pulicaris group) now includes a loose miscellany of some 50
   taxa. The lack of clarity surrounding its taxonomy stimulated the
   present morphological and molecular study of I I species collected in
   Italy. Phylogenetic analysis of nuclear ribosomal DNA internal
   transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequence variation demonstrated a high
   degree of divergence. These results, combined with those from a parallel
   morphological study, disclosed: (1) that some previously described taxa,
   should be resurrected from synonymy; (2) that there are new species to
   be described; (3) that the subgenus Cidicoides (as currently employed)
   is a polyphyletic assemblage of four lineages the subgenus Culicoides
   sensu stricto, the subgenus Silvicola Mirzaeva and Isaev, the subgenus
   Hoffmania Fox and the hitherto unrecognized Fagineus species complex.
   Each is discussed briefly (but not defined) and its constituent
   Palaearctic taxa listed. Strong congruence between - morphological and
   molecular data holds promise for resolving many of the difficult
   taxonomic issues plaguing the accurate identification of vector
   Culicoides around the world.},

Abstract = {A new polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for rapid diagnosis of
   contagious ecthyma was designed and applied to 21 clinical samples from
   Greece. This assay, which detects a highly conserved gene from the
   parapox genome, was evaluated for its sensitivity and specificity in
   order to be considered as a useful diagnostic tool. A comparative study
   with two published PCR protocols one using primers PPP1-PPP3, PPP1-PPP4
   which targets putative virion envelope gene B2L and the other using
   VIR1-VIR2 primers which amplifies ORF virus interferon resistant (VIR)
   gene, as well as cell culture virus neutralization assay was carried
   out. All samples tested were amplified successfully with the PCR
   protocol established in the laboratory. The combination of primers
   PPP1-PPP3 and PPP1-PPP4 in a semi-nested PCR gave a positive result in
   20 of 21 samples while primers VIR1-VIR2 failed to amplify successfully
   7 of 21 samples. The diagnostic value of parapox viral DNA amplification
   was also compared with the results of virus isolation by cell culture
   and was positive in three samples that the virus isolation was obtained.

Abstract = {Anellovirus is a recently created, floating genus of viruses. Torque
   teno virus (TTV), the type species in the genus, was first discovered in
   a human patient with a post-transfusion hepatitis of unknown aetiology.
   Recently, TTV genetically related to but distinct from those discovered
   in humans have also been found in animals, including pigs. The aims of
   this study were to estimate the prevalence of swine TTV in Italian pig
   herds and some risk factors possibly associated with this infection.
   Serum samples from 179 healthy pigs from 10 farms located in
   north-central Italy were tested by polymerase chain reaction for the
   presence of swine TTV DNA. Viral DNA was found in the sera of 43 pigs
   (24.0\%), coming from eight of the 10 farms examined. Prevalence was
   significantly higher in finishing herds (40.1\%) than in
   farrow-to-finish herds (11.0\%) and did not depend on the size of the
   herd. Within the finishing herds the prevalence was significantly higher
   in weaners (57.4\%) than in fatteners (22.9\%), but this difference was
   not observed in farrow-to-finish herds. No relationship was observed
   between the prevalence of swine TTV and the implementation of some
   general hygiene practices and biosecurity procedures within the herds.},

Abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is the most common etiologic agent of mastitis in
   bovines and a major cause of economic losses in the dairy industry.
   Since adhesins, that anchor bacteria to the extracellular matrix (ECM),
   are among the most important S. aureus virulence factors, we used four
   adhesion factors (fibrinogen binding protein, fibronectin binding
   protein A, clumping factor A and collagen adhesin) as target in a DNA
   vaccine. Intranasal immunization with a pDNA mixture coding the four
   adhesins, triggered significant levels of specific serum and mucosal Ig
   that inhibited S. aureus adhesion to cow mammary gland epithelial cells
   in vitro. Splenocytes of immunized mice challenged in vitro with S.
   aureus extracts showed a strong proliferative response. Finally,
   immunized mice were significantly protected against intramammary
   challenge with S. aureus. Our data confirm the feasibility of a genetic
   mucosal vaccine targeting S. aureus adhesins and prompt further study to
   test the efficacy in preventing cow mastitis. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The continuous monitoring of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)
   cases is an integral component of European research and surveillance
   programmes, to ensure that any changes in the presentation of
   transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) in cattle can be
   detected and defined. Monitoring is generally limited to the brainstem
   at the level of the obex, for reasons of practicality, safety and cost.
   Demonstration of disease-specific prion protein (PrPd) by
   immunohistochemistry is currently the most widely used confirmatory tool
   for both active and passive surveillance. This study assessed PrPd
   immunostaining in the brainstems (obex) of cattle with BSE in the UK and
   Italy. Immunoreactivity `profiles' were created for each case based on
   the nature of the immunostaining, its relative intensity and precise
   neuroanatomical location. This study compares the obex immunostaining
   patterns of Italian cases (only active surveillance) and two UK groups
   (both active and passive surveillance). The neuroanatomical distribution
   and relative intensity of PrPd was highly reproducible in all cases. The
   overall staining intensity varied widely but was generally stronger in
   the active than in the passive surveillance populations. The conclusion
   to be drawn from this comparative study is that the pattern of
   immunopathology in these routine screening samples for BSE diagnosis and
   surveillance is the same in the UK and Italy, whether or not the animal
   was displaying typical, or indeed any, clinical signs at the time of
   sampling. This indicates that the current confirmatory diagnostic
   strategy remains appropriate for active surveillance applications.},

Abstract = {Deformed wing virus (DWV) of honeybees (Apis mellifera) is closely
   associated with characteristic wing deformities, abdominal bloating,
   paralysis, and rapid mortality of emerging adult bees. The virus was
   purified from diseased insects, and its genome was cloned and sequenced.
   The genomic RNA of DWV is 10,140 nucleotides in length and contains a
   single large open reading frame encoding a 328-kDa polyprotein. The
   coding sequence is flanked by a 1,144-nucleotide 5' nontranslated leader
   sequence and a 317-nucleotide 3' nontranslated region, followed by a
   poly(A) tail. The three major structural proteins, VP1 (44 kDa), VP2 (32
   kDa), and VP3 (28 kDa), were identified, and their genes were mapped to
   the N-terminal section of the polyprotein. The C-terminal part of the
   polyprotein contains sequence motifs typical of well-characterized
   picornavirus nonstructural proteins: an RNA helicase, a
   chymotrypsin-like 3C protease, and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The
   genome organization, capsid morphology, and sequence comparison data
   indicate that DWV is a member of the recently established genus
   Iflavirus.},

Abstract = {The extant taxa of central and northern Europe are commonly believed to
   derive from Pleistocene ancestors, who moved to the north from three
   separate glacial refugia: the Iberian and Italian peninsulae, as well as
   the southern Balkans. The issue of postglacial dispersal patterns was
   addressed through the investigation of population structure and
   phylogeography of the European roe deer, Capreolus capreolus. The
   genetic diversity in 376 individuals representing 14 allegedly native
   populations across their European range was assessed, using ten
   autosomal microsatellite loci and restriction fragment length
   polymorphisms of the mitochondrial D-loop and NADH dehydrogenase 1 gene
   segments. Our results suggest the existence of three major genetic
   lineages of roe deer in Europe. One comprises populations in the
   south-western limit of the species' distribution (i.e. Iberia), where an
   internal substructure splits a northern from a southern sublineage. A
   second lineage includes populations of southern and eastern Europe, as
   well as a separate sublineage sampled in central-southern Italy, where
   the existence of the subspecies Capreolus c. italicus was supported. In
   central-northern Europe, a third lineage is present, which appeared
   genetically rather homogeneous, although admixed, and equally divergent
   from both the eastern and western lineages. Current patterns of
   intraspecific genetic variation suggest that postglacial recolonization
   routes of this cervid to northern Europe could be due to range expansion
   from one or more refugia in central-eastern Europe, rather than
   proceeding from the Mediterranean areas.(c) 2006 The Linnean Society of

Abstract = {The association between PrP gene variations and scrapie susceptibility
   was studied in a single herd of lonica breed goats. The entire herd
   comprised 100 animals, 11 of which were clinically affected and showed
   pathological prion protein (PrPSc) deposition in both their central
   nervous system (CNS) and lymphoreticular system (LRS). Among
   asymptomatic goats, nine harboured PrPSc in both CNS and LRS, 19 showed
   PrPSc only at the LRS level and 61 animals had no PrPSc deposition.
   Genetic analysis of the PrP gene coding sequence revealed the presence
   of several polymorphisms, namely G37V, T110P, H143R, R154H, Q222K and
   P240S. Silent polymorphisms were also found at codons 42, 138, 219 and
   232. The effect of PrP polymorphism on scrapie susceptibility was
   assessed by comparing the genotype distribution at each locus among
   animals with different pathogenetic and clinical disease stages.
   Significant differences in the distribution of genotypes were observed
   for codons 154 and 222, with polymorphism at codon 154 modulating
   susceptibility to scrapie and lysine at codon 222 being associated with
   scrapie resistance. The allelic variant encoding lysine at position 222
   could be a valuable candidate to select in goats.},

Abstract = {A survey of cystic echinococcosis (CE) in the water buffalo (Bubalus
   bubalis) of the Italian Mediterranean breed was carried out in Campania,
   a region of southern Italy. In addition, a molecular study was performed
   on 48 hydatid cysts coming from 48 water buffaloes in order to determine
   the Echinococcus granulosus strain(s) present in this host. Out of a
   total of 722 water buffaloes examined for CE, 76 (10.5\%) were found
   infected. The average number of cysts per buffalo was 4.3 (minimum 1,
   maximum 45). Seventeen buffaloes had hydatid cysts only in the liver
   (with an average of 5 cysts/liver), 34 only in the lungs (with an
   average of 1.8 cysts/lungs), and 25 buffaloes had cysts both in the
   liver and in the lungs. Fertile cysts were found in 10 (13.2\%) out of
   the 76 positive buffaloes. The sequencing of the mitochondrial
   cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (CO1) gene of the 48 hydatid cysts
   produced sequences of 419 bp for each sample analysed. For 33 samples,
   alignment of the obtained sequences with those present in GenBank showed
   a total homology with the common domestic sheep strain G1; for 15
   samples, sequences obtained showed 100\% homology with buffalo strain
   G3. The findings of the present survey represent the first
   epidemiological and molecular comprehensive studies on CE in water
   buffalo from an endemic area for E. granulosus. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Genotyping of Bacillus anthracis strains based on automated capillary
   25-loci multiple locus variable-number tandem repeats analysis},
Journal = {BMC MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {6},
Month = {APR 6},
Abstract = {Background: The genome of Bacillus anthracis, the etiological agent of
   anthrax, is highly monomorphic which makes differentiation between
   strains difficult. A Multiple Locus Variable-number tandem repeats
   (VNTR) Analysis (MLVA) assay based on 20 markers was previously
   described. It has considerable discrimination power, reproducibility,
   and low cost, especially since the markers proposed can be typed by
   agarose-gel electrophoresis. However in an emergency situation, faster
   genotyping and access to representative databases is necessary.
   Results: Genotyping of B. anthracis reference strains and isolates from
   France and Italy was done using a 25 loci MLVA assay combining 21
   previously described loci and 4 new ones. DNA was amplified in 4
   multiplex PCR reactions and the length of the resulting 25 amplicons was
   estimated by automated capillary electrophoresis. The results were
   reproducible and the data were consistent with other gel based methods
   once differences in mobility patterns were taken into account. Some
   alleles previously unresolved by agarose gel electrophoresis could be
   resolved by capillary electrophoresis, thus further increasing the assay
   resolution. One particular locus, Bams30, is the result of a
   recombination between a 27 bp tandem repeat and a 9 bp tandem repeat.
   The analysis of the array illustrates the evolution process of tandem
   repeats.
   Conclusion: In a crisis situation of suspected bioterrorism,
   standardization, speed and accuracy, together with the availability of
   reference typing data are important issues, as illustrated by the 2001
   anthrax letters event. In this report we describe an upgrade of the
   previously published MLVA method for genotyping of B. anthracis and
   apply the method to the typing of French and Italian B. anthracis strain
   collections. The increased number of markers studied compared to reports
   using only 8 loci greatly improves the discrimination power of the
   technique. An Italian strain belonging to the B branch was described,
   and two new branches, D and E, are proposed. Owing to the upgrading
   achieved here, precise genotyping can now be produced either by
   automated capillary electrophoresis, or by the more accessible but
   slower and for some markers slightly less accurate agarose gel
   methodology.},

Abstract = {A study on the prevalence of the faecal carriage of Escherichia coli
   O157 in lambs was performed in the major slaughterhouse in Rome, central
   Italy, during 2002. A total of 643 animals, consisting of 378 weaned and
   265 suckling lambs, were assayed for the presence of E. coli O157. Five
   O157-agglutinating E. coli strains were isolated (0.8\%, 95\% CI
   0.3-1.9). Only one was positive to PCR specific for the eae gene and
   produced verocytotoxin VT2, with a VTEC O157 overall prevalence of 0.2\%
   (95\% CI 0.0-1.0), whereas one strain possessed the eae gene only. All
   the other isolates were negative for the presence of all the virulence
   genes considered. The animals were either from local farms or imported
   from Eastern Europe. The results suggest an age-specific difference
   since the microorganism was isolated only from 0.3\% (95\% CI 0.0-1.7)
   of weaned lambs, while all samples from suckling lambs tested negative.
   From this study, the overall risk of human exposure to pathogenic E.
   coli O157 from lamb meat consumption derived from the major
   slaughterhouse in Rome can be considered reasonably low, particularly
   when suckling lamb meat is considered.},

Abstract = {Brucellosis is a costly disease of water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis).
   Latent infections and prolonged incubation of the pathogen limit the
   efficacy of programs based on the eradication of infected animals. We
   exploited genetic selection for disease resistance as an approach to the
   control of water buffalo brucellosis. We tested 231 water buffalo cows
   for the presence of anti-Brucella abortus antibodies (by the
   agglutination and complement fixation tests) and the Nramp1 genotype (by
   PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis). When the 231 animals (58
   cases and 173 controls) were divided into infected (seropositive) and
   noninfected (seronegative) groups and the Nramp1 genotypes were
   compared, the seropositive subjects were 52 out of 167 (31\%) in the
   Nramp1A(+) (Nramp1AA or Nramp1AB) group and 6 out of 64 (9.4\%) in the
   Nramp1A(-) (Nramp1BB) group (odds ratio, 4.37; 95\% confidence limits,
   1.87 to 10.19; chi(2), 11.65 for 1 degree of freedom). Monocytes from
   Nramp1BB subjects displayed significantly (P < 0.01) higher levels of
   Nramp1 mRNA than Nramp1AA subjects and also a significantly (P < 0.01)
   higher ability in controlling the intracellular replication of several
   Brucella species in vitro. Thus, selection for the Nramp1BB genotype can
   become a valuable tool for the control of water buffalo brucellosis in
   the areas where the disease is endemic.},

Abstract = {Avian influenza ( AI) infections have become of growing importance both
   for animal and human health. Vaccination has become a recommended tool
   to support eradication efforts and limit the economic losses caused by
   this disease. The ``DIVA'' system, using a vaccine containing a
   heterologous neuraminidase to the field virus, has been shown to be an
   effective tool in increasing the resistance of birds to field challenge,
   preventing clinical signs and reducing viral shedding in the
   environment. The companion diagnostic test to the vaccine, however, has
   been only partially validated in the field against one subtype of
   neuraminidase ( N1). The present paper presents the results of a full
   laboratory and field validation of the diagnostic test developed to
   detect antibodies to the N3 subtype of AI in vaccinated and unvaccinated
   chickens and turkeys. Antibody kinetic studies conducted in the
   laboratory have shown that antibodies to the N protein may be detected
   earlier than antibodies to the haemagglutinin. The data derived from
   this extensive validation trial indicate the excellent capability of
   this assay in detecting the presence of active AI infection at an early
   stage in both unvaccinated and vaccinated birds and the lack of
   interference with vaccine-induced antibodies.},

Abstract = {This paper is aimed at reporting a full validation of a Cold Vapour
   Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (CVAAS) method for mercury determination
   in fishery products. Method precision, trueness, limit of detection and
   limit of quantification are evaluated. The uncertainty of measurement is
   estimated following the bottom-up approach in conjunction with the
   validation data as suggested for complex analysis.
   The precision is evaluated using a pooled relative standard deviation
   and the recovery is added to the measurement uncertainty budget.
   Uncertainties of weight of sample, dilution factor, calibration, work
   solution and analyte amount are also assessed.
   The most relevant uncertainty sources result those associated to amount
   of mercury determined in the final sample solution, to method precision
   and to recovery. The relative contributions have different weights
   according to the analyst decision regarding recovery correction of
   results. In conclusion, the adopted CVAAS method fully complies with EU
   requirements.},

Abstract = {Tissue and blood samples were collected from 152 wild boars (Sus scrofa)
   from the Maremma area (Grosseto district, Central Italy) between
   November 2002 and January 2003. The presence of pseudorabies virus (PRV)
   antibodies, antigen, and DNA were confirmed by an enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunohistochemistry, and polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR), respectively. Of 152 animals, 62 (41\%) were positive
   for viral antigen in tonsillar tissue. Of the 80 serum samples that were
   suitable for testing, 41 (51\%) were positive for PRV antibodies.
   Positive immunohistochemistry results were confirmed by PCR. A
   significantly higher prevalence of PRV antigen and seroprevalence was
   detected in older animals. No differences were detected between males
   and females or for animals coming from different areas sampled. Results
   confirm that PRV is endemic in this wild boar population with a high
   prevalence of infection. The results of immunohistochemistry
   investigations demonstrated that a large number of wild boars harbor PRV
   in tonsillar tissues and should be considered as an important reservoir
   of PRV.},

Title = {Stress evaluation in hares (Lepus europaeus Pallas) captured for

Abstract = {With the aim to evaluate the capturing techniques some haematic and
   physiological parameters were studied to discriminate stressed hares
   from non stressed hares.
   A total of 66 wild hares (experimental group) were sampled in 14
   different non-hunting areas, where hares are usually captured for later
   release in low-density areas. In the same season a total of 30 hares
   (about 1 year old), reared in cages and thus showing a reduced fear of
   man, were sampled (control group). In each area the hares were captured
   by coursing with 3-4 dogs (greyhounds or lurches). The dogs were
   released by the different hunter teams to find and drive into trammel
   nets any hare that was seen running. After capture, the hares remained
   inside darkened, wooden capture-boxes for a variable period of time
   before blood drawing. For blood sample collection all the hares were
   physically restrained and their eyes immediately covered. Blood, always
   collected within 1-2 minutes, was drawn from the auricular vein. Blood
   samples (plasma) were analysed for glucose, AST, ALT, CPK and cortisol
   concentrations. Body temperature, heart and respiratory rate, sex, and
   age were evaluated in each hare. The effect of origin, sex and age on
   haematic and physiological parameters was analysed by ANOVA. Every
   measured parameter of the hares bearing to the capture group or the
   control group (reared) was then subjected to stepwise and to
   discriminant analysis, in order to select the groups of stressed
   (discriminated by the controls) and non-stressed hares.
   CPK, AST and glucose were found to be the best parameters for
   distinguishing stressed from non-stressed hares. The intensive exercise
   suffered by the wild hares induced a depletion of energetic reserves, so
   that most of the captured hares showed lower glucose and higher CPK
   activity in the plasma, probably due to muscle damage (P < 0.05). After
   reclassifying the hares in the two groups of stressed and non stressed
   hares, the reference values (means SE) resulted as follows: estimated
   non-stressed hares, glucose 234 +/- 9.4 mg/dl, AST 112 +/- 22.2 U/I, CPK
   1334 734 U/I; estimated stressed hares, glucose 128 7 mg/dl, AST 164 13
   U/I, CPK 4658 +/- 454 U/I.
   fThese three cheap and quickly analysable analytes can be useful to the
   game manager in detecting stressed and non stressed hares, in order to
   improve the capturing techniques by the evaluation of the following
   relationship: (number of stressed hares + number of the dead hares
   during the capture)/number of total captured hares.},

Abstract = {A commercially available competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   (cELISA, VMRD (R)) was validated for the detection of Neospora caninum
   antibodies in the serum of dogs, using as a reference test an indirect
   fluorescent antibody test (IFAT, Fuller (R)). A partial verification
   approach Was used. A total of 618 dogs were screened with cELISA and a
   subset of positive and negative sera (n = 237) were then tested with
   IFAT. Naive relative sensitivity (SE,) and naive relative specificity
   (SPnv) of cELISA were calculated and then corrected (SEcorr SPcorr) for
   studies with partial validation. Results showed a SEnv of 72\% and a
   SPnv of 89.3\%; corrected estimates showed a SEcorr of 47\% and a SPcorr
   of 96\%. ROC analysis showed that the cutoff recommended by the
   Manufacturer (30\%) corresponded to the highest naive sensitivity (72\%)
   combined with a good naive specificity (90\%) of cELISA. Corrected
   estimates of SE and SP for partial verification method revealed that SE
   of the cELISA is lower and SP is higher than naive estimates. The
   results Suggest to use this test for confirmation of a clinical
   suspicion of neosporosis, and to use some techniques for adjustment of
   misclassification in prevalence and risk-factor studies. (c) 2005

Title = {Analysis of the 1999-2000 highly pathogenic avian influenza (H7N1)
   epidemic in the main poultry-production area in northern Italy},

Abstract = {We evaluated the effects of risk factors and control policies following
   the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) epidemic that struck
   northern Italy's Poultry industry in the winter of 1999-2000. The
   epidemic was caused by a type-A influenza virus of the H7N1 subtype,
   that originated from a low-pathogenic AI virus which spread among
   Poultry farms in northeastern Italy in 1999 and eventually became
   virulent by mutation. Most infected premises (IP) were located in the
   regions of Lombardy and Veneto (382 out of 413, 92.5\%), and the
   eradication measures provided for in the European legislation were
   enforced. In Veneto, where flock density was highest, infection-control
   was also accomplished by means of depopulation of susceptible flocks
   through a ban on restocking and pre-emptive slaughter of flocks that
   were in the vicinities of or that had dangerous contacts with IPs. In
   Lombardy, such control measures were applied to a lesser extent.
   Infection incidence rate (IR) was 2.6 cases per 1000 flocks per day in
   Lombardy and 1.1 in Veneto. After the implementation of
   infection-control measures, the at-risk population, the percentage of
   flocks <= 1.5 km from IPs, and the HPAI-IR underwent a greater reduction
   in Veneto than in Lombardy. Although the proximity (<= 1.5 km) to IN in
   the temporal risk window (TRW) was a major risk factor for HPAI at the
   individual flock level, its effect at the population level
   (population-attributable fraction) did not exceed 31.3\%. Viral
   transmission therefore also occurred among relatively distant flocks.
   Turkey flocks were characterised by grerater IR of HPAI compared with
   other bird Species Such as layer hens, broilers, gamebirds, and
   waterfowl, even when located at distances > 1.5 km from IPs. In
   Lombardy, IR for species other than turkeys was also relatively high.

Abstract = {Rotavirus genome segment 4, encoding the spike outer capsid VP4 protein,
   of a porcine rotavirus (PoRV) strain, 134/04-15, identified in Italy was
   sequenced, and the predicted amino acid (aa) sequence was compared to
   those of all known VP4 (P) genotypes. The aa sequence of the full-length
   VP4 protein of the PoRV strain 134/04-15 showed aa identity values
   ranging from 59.7\% (bovine strain KK3, P8{[}11]) to 86.09\% (porcine
   strain A46, P{[}13]) with those of the remaining 25 P genotypes.
   Moreover, aa sequence analysis of the corresponding VP8{*} trypsin
   cleavage fragment revealed that the PoRV strain 134/04-15 shared low
   identity, ranging from 37.52\% (bovine strain 993/83, P{[}17]) to 73.6\%
   (porcine strain MDR-13, P{[}13]), with those of the remaining 25 P
   genotypes. Phylogenetic relationships showed that the VP4 of the PoRV
   strain 134/04-15 shares a common evolutionary origin with porcine
   P{[}13] and lapine P{[}22] rotavirus strains. Additional sequence
   analyses of the VP7, VP6, and NSP4 genes of the PoRV strain 134/04-15
   revealed the highest VP7 aa identity (95.9\%) to G5 porcine strains, a
   porcine-like VP6 within VP6 genogroup I. and a Wa-like (genotype B)
   NSP4, respectively. Altogether, these results indicate that the PoRV
   strain 134/04-15 should be considered as prototype of a new VP4
   genotype, P{[}26], and provide further evidence for the vast genetic and
   antigenic diversity of group A rotaviruses. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {Background: Artifactual changes in blood may occur as a consequence of
   delayed analysis and may complicate interpretation of CBC data.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to characterize artifactual changes
   in canine blood, due to storage, using the ADVIA 120 hematology
   analyzer. Methods: Blood samples were collected into EDTA from 5
   clinically healthy dogs. Within 1 hour after blood sample collection and
   at 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours after storage of the samples at either 4
   degrees C or room temperature (-24 degrees C), a CBC was done using the
   ADVIA 120 and multispecies software. A linear mixed model was used to
   statistically evaluate significant differences in values over time,
   compared with initial values. Results: The HCT and MCV were increased
   significantly after 12 hours of collection at both 4 degrees C and 24
   degrees C, and continued to increase through 48 hours. The MCHC
   initially decreased significantly at 12-24 hours and then continued to
   decrease through 48 hours at both temperatures. Changes in HCT, MCV, and
   MCHC were greater at 24 degrees C than at 4 degrees C at all time
   points. A significant increase in MPV and a decrease in mean platelet
   component concentration were observed at all time points at 24 degrees
   C. Samples stored at 24 degrees C for 48 hours had significantly higher
   percentages of normocytic-hypochromic RBCs, and macrocytic-normochromic
   RBCs, and lower platelet and total WBC counts. Conclusions: Delayed
   analysis of canine blood samples produces artifactual changes in CBC
   results, mainly in RBC morphology and platelet parameters, that are
   readily detected using the ADVIA 120. Refrigeration of specimens, even
   after 24 hours of storage at room temperature, is recommended to improve
   the accuracy of CBC results for canine blood samples.},

Abstract = {A 6-year-old intact female corn snake (Elaphe guttata guttata) was
   presented with a 3-week history of anorexia. Coelomic radiographs
   revealed a 9 X 4 cm soft tissue opacity suggestive of a right ovarian
   enlargement. The mass (9 X 5 X 4 cm) was surgically removed, and
   multiple smears from tissue sections were stained with Diff-Quik.
   Multiple tissue samples from the mass were collected and fixed in
   formalin. Cytologic specimens were moderately cellular and contained
   light pink amorphous background material. The cells were primarily
   spindle-shaped with moderate to marked anisocytosis and anisokaryosis.
   Cells sometimes were round to polygonal, and rarely were arranged in
   small clusters. Macrophages occasionally were observed. Histologic
   specimens consisted of a highly cellular mass composed of pleomorphic,
   spindle-shaped cells and, occasionally, round to polygonal cells
   arranged in irregular fascicles. The neoplastic cells were
   immunoreactive for cytokera tin (AE1/AE3), smooth muscle actin, and
   skeletal muscle actin, but did not stain for vimentin or desmin. On the
   basis of the morphologic and immunohistochemical results, a diagnosis of
   ovarian undifferentiated carcinoma was made. In this report, we describe
   the challenges of using immunohistochemistry to diagnose this uncommon
   type of tumor in reptiles.},

   and in some cases by PCR on frozen-thawed or paraffin-embedded tissue
   samples. The main clinical signs were hindleg ataxia and paresis, but
   blindness or nystagmus were also observed. Thirty-three of the affected
   sheep (46.5 per cent) were two years old or younger. The affected sheep
   showed variable degrees of a non-suppurative meningoencephalitis, and
   immunohistochemistry identified positive cells in all cases, with no

Abstract = {Feline immunodeficiency virus sustains an AIDS-like syndrome in cats,
   which is considered a relevant model for human AIDS. Under precise
   enrolment requirements, 30 naturally infected cats showing overt disease
   were included in a trial of low-dose, oral human interferon-alpha
   treatment. Twenty-four of them received 10 IU/Kg of human
   interferon-alpha and 6 placebo only on a daily basis under veterinary
   supervision. The low-dose human interferon-alpha treatment significantly
   prolonged the survival of virus-infected cats (p < 0.01) and brought to
   a rapid improvement of disease conditions in the infected hosts.
   Amelioration of clinical conditions was neither correlated with plasma
   viremia, nor with proviral load in leukocytes. A good survival of CD4+ T
   cells and a slow increase of CD8+ T cells were also observed in human
   interferon-alpha-treated cats. Interestingly, the improvement of the
   total leukocyte counts showed a much stronger correlation with the
   recovery from serious opportunistic infections. As shown in other models
   of low-dose interferon-alpha treatment, there was a rapid regression of
   overt immunopathological conditions in virus-infected cats. This hints
   at a major role of interferon-alpha in the control circuits of
   inflammatory cytokines, which was probably the very foundation of the
   improved clinical score and survival despite the unabated persistence of
   virus and virus-infected cells. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Aims: A rapid and sensitive method for Listeria monocytogenes direct
   detection from milk was developed. It is based on a magnetic capture
   hybridization procedure for selective DNA purification, followed by PCR
   identification. A comparison with two similar commercial systems from
   Dynal (Dynabeads) was carried out.
   Methods and Results: The technique used previously developed
   nanoparticles modified with a 21-mer oligonucleotide. This sequence,
   sharing homology with all the L. monocytogenes strains, was selected on
   hlyA gene and located outside the desired specific PCR site to avoid
   cross-contaminations. Capture probe properties, in term of spacer length
   and purification, were determined to obtain the highest hybridization
   efficiency. Its specificity was tested in hybridization experiments with
   nontarget bacterial species. Any inhibitory effect of the nanoparticles
   on PCR was also examined. The amplification performed with the purified
   DNA could reliably identify a 10 CFU ml(-1) contamination rate.
   Conclusions: The optimized purification method showed a high specificity
   and sensitivity, with a detection level one log more sensitive than PCR
   carried out with nucleic acids obtained using commercial nanoparticles.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: The method, avoiding
   pre-enrichment, provides a rapid alternative to conventional
   microbiological detection methods. Furthermore, it is suitable for
   automation and can be proposed for the screening of a large number of
   samples.},

Abstract = {Aluminium (Al) is the third most widespread metal in the environment. It
   is toxic for the brain, bone and haematological system but unfortunately
   very little data exist for other organs. Stress proteins are induced or
   enhanced against metal toxicity with an essential role in the recovery
   of organules and other cellular proteins. This immunohistochemical study
   was performed to analyze the distribution of three stress proteins
   (HSP25, HSP72, GRP75) in rat kidney and liver orally exposed to Al
   sulphate daily for 3 and 6 months. Al-induced alterations were further
   studied by histopathology (H\&E, PAS, Perl's, Masson) and
   ultrastructural morphometry. In the kidney: HSP25 was enhanced in
   proximal tubules after 6 months Al-exposure when abnormal brush borders
   were observed; HSP72 was induced in proximal tubules only after long
   Al-treatment; GRP75 was raised in midcortical area sometimes within
   nuclei. Furthermore, lysosomal and lipofuscins densities increased in
   the juxtamedullary tubules after 3 months Al exposure with respect to
   controls. In the liver: Perl's-positive deposits and fibrosis became
   evident after Al treatment. HSP25 was very weak; HSP72 focal in
   pericentral hepatocytes at 3 months and induced also in Kupffer cells at
   6 months; GRP75 diffuse in periportal hepatocytes and non parenchymal
   cells at 6 months. Prolonged Al exposure stimulated stress proteins
   strictly organ-dependently in the rat. Their distribution in kidney and
   liver seems related to cumulative sublethal effects induced by metal and
   could be a sensitive index of Al susceptibility of these organs.},

Abstract = {Neospora caninum is a heteroxenous cyst-forming coccidian closely
   related to Toxoplasma gondii and is considered one of the major causes
   of abortions in cattle worldwide. The present work aims to update the
   epidemiological trend of N. caninum of dairy cattle in Sardinia island,
   Western Mediterranean (Italy). For this reason, we used the newest
   enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) methodology that exploits
   immune-stimulating complexes (iscoms) principle and allows us to point
   out the infection in the tank bulk milk too, besides the individual
   cattle. A total of 624 herds were sampled and tank bulk milk was
   submitted to iscom ELISA test. The analysis of the tank bulk milk
   samples revealed a total farm prevalence of 55\% for N. caninum in
   Sardinia. In the provinces of Oristano and Cagliari the prevalences (64
   and 65\%, respectively) were significantly higher (p < 0.01) than in
   Sassari and Nuoro (41 and 40\%, respectively). The iscom Elisa test
   applied on tank bulk milk seems to be helpful and cost-effective for
   large epidemiological surveys, for monitoring control strategy plans for
   N. caninum, and for increasing the bio-safety level in dairy cattle
   farms.},

Abstract = {Porcine rotavinis strains (PoRVs) bearing human-like VP4 P{[}6] gene
   alleles were identified. Genetic characterization with either PCR
   genotyping or sequence analysis allowed to determine the VP7 specificity
   of the PoRVs as G3, G4, G5 and G9, and the VP6 as genogroup I, that is
   predictive of a subgroup I specificity. Sequence analysis of the VP8{*}
   trypsin-cleavage product of VP4 allowed PoRVs to be characterized
   further into genetic lineages within the P{[}6] genotype. Unexpectedly,
   the strains displayed significantly higher similarity (up to 94.6\% and
   92.5\% at an and nt level, respectively) to human M37-like P{[}6]
   strains (lineage 1), serologically classifiable as P2A, or to the
   atypical Hungarian P{[}61 human strains (HRVs), designated as lineage V
   (up to 97.0\% an and 96.1\% nt), than to the porcine P{[}6] strain
   Gottfried, lineage II (<85.1\% aa and 82.2 nt), which is serologically
   classified as P2B. Interestingly, no P{[}6] PoRV resembling the original
   prototype porcine strain, Gottfried, was detected, while Japanase P{[}6]
   PoRV clustered with the atypical Japanase G I human strain AU19. By
   analysis of the 10th and 11th genome segments, all the strains revealed
   a NSP4B genogroup (Wa-like) and a NSP5/6 gene of porcine origin. These
   findings strongly suggest interspecies transmission of rotavirus strains
   and/or genes, and may indicate the occurrence of at least 3 separate
   rotavirus transmission events between pigs and humans, providing
   convincing evidence that evolution of human rotaviruses is tightly
   intermingled with the evolution of animal rotaviruses. (C) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {Of 771 regularly slaughtered Sardinian breed sheep, 580 (75\%) were
   found infected with Echinococcus granulosus hydatid cysts. Seventy-nine
   sheep (10.3\%) had at least 1 fertile cyst. The prevalence of sheep
   infected with purulent/caseous cysts, calcified cysts and sterile cysts
   was 13, 59 and 28\%, respectively. The age of sheep was positively
   associated with the probability of infection that increased 1.15 fold
   for each further year of age. Fertile cysts were found in the lungs of
   46 sheep (6\%) and in the liver of 13 sheep (1.7\%), and in the lung and
   the liver of 20 sheep (2.6\%). Most fertile cysts were found in the
   lungs (314) and most sheep were infected with less than 10 cysts. When
   analyzed by a mixed-effect logistic model, the probability to find
   fertile cysts in the lungs was three times higher compared to the liver
   and it increased with the age of the sheep (p = 0.70, p < 0.001). Of
   4072 collected cysts, 532 were fertile, 178 purulent/caseous, 2339
   calcified and 1023 sterile. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The nasal route is used both for local therapies and, more recently, for
   the systemic administration of drugs, as well as for the delivery of
   peptides and vaccines. In this study the nasal administration of
   Carbamazepine (CBZ) has been studied using microspheres constituted by
   chitosan hydrochloride (CH) or chitosan glutamate (CG). Blank
   microspheres were also prepared as a comparison. The microspheres were
   produced using a spray-drying technique and characterized in terms of
   morphology (scanning electron microscopy, SEM), drug content,
   particle-size (laser diffraction method) and thermal behaviour
   (differential scanning calorimetry, DSC). In vitro drug release studies
   were performed in phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). In vivo tests were carried
   out in sheep using the microparticles containing chitosan glutamate,
   chosen on the basis of the results of in vitro studies. The results were
   compared to those obtained after the nasal administration of CBZ (raw
   material) alone. For the evaluation of in vivo data statistical analysis
   was carried out using the unpaired t-test.
   Spray-drying was a good technique of preparation of CBZ-loaded
   microspheres. The loading of the drug into the polymeric network always
   led to an increase in the dissolution rate compared to CBZ raw material.
   The microspheres obtained using chitosan glutamate had the best
   behaviour both in vitro and in vivo. They increased the drug
   concentration in the serum when compared to the nasal administration of
   the pure drug (C,, 800 and 25 ng/ml for microspheres and pure drug,
   respectively). The results obtained indicate that the loading of CBZ in
   chitosan glutamate microspheres increases the amount of the drug
   absorbed through the nose. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {An unusually high incidence of infectious keratoconjunctivitis followed
   by pneumonia and arthritis was observed in beef calves of a managed
   herd. No Moraxella spp. or bacteria other than Mycoplasma spp. were
   obtained from conjunctival and nasal swabs. A strategy was designed for
   characterization of bovine mycoplasmas at species and strain level oil
   the basis of a combination of molecular tools and the immunoblotting
   method. The strategy made it possible to rapidly assign the bacterium
   responsible for this outbreak to one of the phylogenetic clusters of
   bovine mycoplasmas delineated in this study and then to identify it as
   Mycoplasma bovis. The strain, designated Sar 1, showed a 100\% 16S rDNA
   sequence identity with two European strains (120/81 and MC3386) isolated
   in Germany and Ireland, respectively, and hosts a vsp gene analog to the
   vsp(A), vsp(422-4), and vsp(422-8) genes of the M. bovis reference
   strain PG45(T) and of the field strain 422. The use of a cross-reactive
   rabbit serum developed against the Mycoplasma agalactiae immunodominant
   antigen P48 confirmed the molecular findings. The immunological response
   of calves against M. bovis was also investigated. This is the first
   report on the occurrence of M. bovis on the Island of Sardinia (Italy).},

Abstract = {The applicability of some assays to evaluate the effectiveness of the
   immune function, as previously used in other animal species (pigs, cows
   and sheep), was tested in an alpaca (Lama pacos) herd affected by
   Caseous Lymphadenitis (Corynebacterium pseudotubercolosis) and subject
   to a vaccination programme against the causative agent. The vaccination
   programme was initiated following failure of controlling the outbreak by
   isolation and treatment of the initially affected animals. An homotypic,
   autogenous inactivated and adjuvated (aluminium hydroxide) vaccine,
   administered subcutaneously at day 0 (A) and after 21 days (B) was used.
   Blood samples were collected by venipuncture of the jugular vein on days
   0, 21 and 42 (C). Samples in EDTA, collected on day A and C, were
   analysed for standard haematological parameters. Serum obtained from
   whole blood with no anticoagulant on days A, B and C was tested for:
   Lysozyme serum titration (expressed in mu g/m), serum Bactericidal assay
   (expressed in \%), semiquantitative complement titration (expressed in
   CH50) and immunoglobuline (by electrophoresis) and IgGs concentrations
   (by Radial Immunodiffusion tests).},

Title = {Prion diseases - Current understanding of epidemiology and pathogenesis,
   and therapeutic advances},
Journal = {CNS DRUGS},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {15-28},
Abstract = {The bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) epidemic, along with the
   related threat to human health posed by the transmission of the BSE
   agent to humans, has highlighted the importance of prion diseases. These
   fatal neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by spongiform changes
   in the CNS, and comprise a wide spectrum of clinicopathological entities
   in humans and animals, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and its
   emerging new variant (vCJD) in humans, and BSE and scrapie in animals.
   This article reviews the geographical distribution and the temporal
   trends of CJD and vCJD; the major events in the pathogenesis of prion
   diseases; the risk factors for sporadic CJD and vCJD; and the possible
   strategies for treating them.
   Worldwide statistics indicate that sporadic CJD has a stable incidence
   of one case per million people per year; in contrast, the incidence of
   vCJD appears to have increased exponentially from its characterisation
   in 1994 to a peak in 2000. As of December 2005, 183 definite or probable
   cases of vCJD had been reported worldwide.
   The crucial event in the pathogenesis of prion diseases is the
   conversion of the normally occurring cellular prion protein (PrPc) into
   a pathogenic form, called protease-resistant PrP (PrPres) or scrapie PrP
   (PrPsc). Pathogenetic studies in rodent models have shown that PrPsc is
   found in the enteric nervous system and in the gut-associated lymphoid
   tissue following oral scrapie ingestion. The role of the lymphoreticular
   system in the pathogenesis of TSE seems to be related to the strains of
   agents and the host genotype.
   Therapeutic approaches to vCJD are mainly based on the inhibition or
   prevention of the pathological change that creates PrPsc. Derivatives of
   acridine (such as mepacrine {[}quinacrine]) and the phenothiazine
   psychotropics have been proposed as possible therapies because of their
   activity in cellular models; however, neither class was able to affect
   the protease resistance of preexisting PrP fibrils. More encouragingly,
   in animal models of prion disease. tetracyclines were found to reduce
   prion infectivity by direct inactivation of PrPsc. While these findings
   are promising, the suitability of these compounds for clinical use is
   still limited by their low efficacy once symptoms are apparent.
   Treatments based on the vaccination approach have also produced positive
   results, but further investigations are necessary to establish their
   clinical application.},

Abstract = {GMO detection and quantification methods in the EU are mainly based on
   real-time PCR. The analytical methods in use must be validated, first on
   an intra-laboratory scale and through a collaborative trial thereafter.
   Since a consensual protocol for intra-laboratory validation of real-time
   PCR methods is lacking, we provide a practical approach for the in-house
   validation of quantitative real-time PCR methods, establishing
   acceptability criteria and quality controls for PCR runs. Parameters
   such as limit of detection, limit of quantification, precision,
   trueness, linear dynamic range, PCR efficiency, robustness and
   specificity are considered. The protocol is sufficiently detailed to be
   directly applicable, increases the reliability of results and their
   harmonization among different laboratories, and represents a necessary
   preliminary step before proceeding to a time-consuming and costly full
   validation study.},

Abstract = {Assignment tests based on multilocus genotypes are becoming increasingly
   important to certify quality and origin of livestock products and assure
   food safety and authenticity. The purpose of this study was to determine
   the potential of microsatellites (STR) for determining the breed origin
   of beef products among cattle breeds present in the market. We typed 19
   STR in 269 animals from 4 cattle breeds. Based on Wright's F-statistics,
   4 loci were discarded, and the remaining 15 loci (F-IT = 0.101, F-ST =
   0.089, and F-IS = 0.013) were used to compute the likelihood that each
   multilocus genotype of the total sample was drawn from its true breed
   instead of another breed. To avoid occurrence of zero likelihood when
   one or more alleles were missing from a tested breed, sample allele
   frequencies were estimated assuming uniform prior distributions.
   Log-likelihood ratio {[}log(LR)] distributions of the individual
   assignments were determined for all possible breed contrasts, and their
   means and SD were used to infer the true-positive and false-positive
   rates at several values of the log(LR). The posterior probability that
   the animals of a presumed breed were actually drawn from that breed
   instead of any another breed was then calculated. Given an observed
   value of log(LR) > 0 and assuming equal priors, these probabilities were
   > 99.5\% in 10 of 12 possible breed contrasts. For the 2 most closely
   related breeds (F-ST = 0.041), this probability was 96.3\%, and the
   probability of excluding the origin of an animal from an alleged breed
   when it was actually derived from another breed was similar.},

Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Pages = {397-408},
Abstract = {An assessment of the microbiological quality of retail fresh pork meat
   was conducted with two microbial isolation methods (swab, disruptive) on
   108 samples from two muscle types (Longissimus thoracis and masseter),
   collected from 18 outlets of two retail types (supermarkets and
   butcher's shops) in three provinces of the Latium region (central
   Italy). Counts ranged from 2.2 to 5.4 log cfu/g for total mesophilic
   bacteria, from 0.09 to 5.6 log cfu/g for thermophilic bacteria, and from
   1.3 to 4.3 log cfu/g for coliforms. On the average, the disruptive
   method gave higher colony counts by a factor of 2.4. Residual
   variability was mostly due to muscle type and only to a limited extent,
   to the retail outlet or sampling visit. The frequency of positive
   samples detected with the disruptive method was 19\% for E. coli, 16\%
   for Staphylococcus spp., 19\% for Salmonella spp., 29\% for
   Campylobacter spp., 11\% for B. thermosphacta and 20\% for lactic acid
   bacteria; in general the method was two to five times more efficient
   than the swab method. Method agreement was quite low for both analytical
   determinations and overall quality assessment. Compared with EU
   reference values, the swab method was stricter in assessing
   microbiological quality, signalling over one-tenth of the samples as
   unacceptable on mesophilic counts and about two thirds on coliforms
   counts, while 6\% on coliform counts and 19\% on Salmonella tests were
   rated as unacceptable according to the Italian Zooprophylactic Service
   reference based on the disruptive method.},

   levels in samples from Southern Italy},
Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {251-259},
Abstract = {Aflatoxin M-1 in milk and dairy products represents a concern for food
   safety, and laboratories involved in its determination have to use
   reliable and robust test methods. To this purpose, both method
   validation and participation in proficiency studies are mandatory
   requirements for demonstrating adequate technical competence. In this
   work, the validation of a HPLC method for determination of aflatoxin M-1
   (AFM(1)) in milk, through both proficiency testing and intra-laboratory
   study, according to the UNI CEI EN ISO/IEC 17025 standard is described.
   A survey about AFM(1) levels in both raw and heat-treated milk from
   Southern Italy over the years 2002-2005 is also reported. A total of 552
   samples from cows, buffaloes, sheep and goats were analysed; AFM(I) was
   detected in 248 samples (44.9\%), from all the species. Most of these
   samples contained AFM(1) concentrations that were well below the legal
   maximum residue limit (MRL); only 33 samples were non-compliant (6.0\%);
   bovine milk was the most contaminated. Moreover, the first long-term
   survey regarding contamination of raw buffalo milk is described and
   discussed. The highest contamination levels were detected in 2003 and
   2005.},

Journal = {VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {37},

Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {The pathogenesis of encephalomyocarditis (EMC) due to the EMC virus (
   EMCV) was studied in 24 piglets oro-nasally infected with the field
   isolate B279/95. Two pigs were kept as negative controls and were
   euthanised at hour 0. The remaining 24 were euthanised every 6 h up to
   78-h post infection (hpi). Virus isolation, histological examination and
   EMCV immunodetection were performed on the spleen, intestine, pancreas,
   liver, kidneys, heart, lungs, lymph nodes, tonsils and brain. EMCV was
   isolated at 6-hpi from the intestine and lymph nodes and at 12-hpi from
   the heart. From 6 to 12-hpi, scattered degenerate myocardiocytes were
   immunolabelled. Subsequently, myocarditis developed and progressively
   worsened. Immunopositive reaction in tonsil macrophages, observed in the
   early stage of infection (6-hpi), suggests that tonsils are the portal
   of entry, and by mean of wandering macrophages the EMC virus is then
   distributed through the body. Afterwards, EMCV-B279/95 replicates
   intensively in the cytoplasm of myocardiocytes and the acute myocarditis
   is strictly related to the tropism of these cells. Four pigs died
   spontaneously. In three animals no post mortem lesions or virus were
   isolated/detected, although all of them showed mild myocarditis. The
   experimental infection with EMCV B279/95 indicates: (i) the experimental
   protocol mimics the individual variability observed in natural disease,
   (ii) tonsils are the portal of entry of infection and the heart is the
   target organ, (iii) EMCV provides a valuable animal model for
   comparative studies on progressive viral myocarditis.},

Abstract = {A real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
   assay was developed for the detection of bluetongue virus (BTV) in blood
   samples. A combination of primers specific for a highly conserved region
   in RNA segment 5 (based on Mediterranean BTV sequences) and a DNA probe
   bound to 5'-Taq nuclease-3' minor groove binder (TaqMan(C) MGB) was used
   to detect a range of isolates. This real-time RT-PCR assay could detect
   5.4 X 10(-3) tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50) of virus per
   milliliter of sample, which was comparable to our current BTV diagnostic
   nested RT-PCR assay. The assay detected all recent Mediterranean
   isolates (including serotypes 2, 4, and 16). BTV vaccine strains for
   serotypes 2 and 4, and 15 out of the 24 BTV reference strains available
   (all serotypes), but did not detect the related orbiviruses epizootic
   hemorrhagic disease and African horse sickness viruses. Following assay
   evaluation, the ability of this assay to identify BTV in recent isolates
   (2003, 2004) from ovine and bovine samples from an epizootic outbreak in
   Spain was also tested. Minor nucleotide changes (detected by sequencing
   viral genomes) within the probe-binding region were found to have a
   profound effect on virus detection. This assay has the benefits of
   being, fast and simple, and the 96-well format enables large-scale
   epidemiological screening for BTV, especially when combined with a
   high-throughput nucleic acid extraction method.},

Abstract = {Ixodes ricinus (I. ricinus) is one of the vectors of Anaplasma
   phagocytophilum (A. phagocytophilum) in Europe, in which rates of
   infection range from 1.9\% to 34\%. In 1998, human granulocytic
   ehrilichiosis-like (HGE-like) Ehrlichia DNA was detected in Italy, by
   PCR technique in one I. ricinus nymph out of 55 ticks that were
   examined. In 1996, 6.3\% of 310 human sera in high-risk subjects from
   Italy were found positive for antibodies to Ehrlichia phagocytophila (E.
   phagocytophila). In the same year, the authors reported the first case
   of equine granulocytic ehrlichiosis. In 1997, only 2 out of 563 equine
   blood samples examined were found positive for antibodies to E.
   phagocytophila in the Latium region. In 1998, serological positivity was
   not observed in 14 symptomatic race horses. In 2002, a symptomatic horse
   living in Rome was found positive for Ehrlichia equi (E. equi)
   antibodies, as confirmed by PCR. E. equi was also demonstrated in horses
   by detection of specific antibodies from two asymptomatic ponies. We
   tested 128 sera from sheep in different flocks, and antibodies to E.
   phagocytophila were detected in 17 sera (13.3\%) of these sheep. From
   2000 to 2004, 147 dog sera were tested for antibodies against A.
   phagocytophilum, and 7 of these sera were positive (4.8\%). These data
   confirm the presence of the infection in human, domestic animals, and
   pets in Italy. Studies are under way to correlate the distributions of
   the disease and tick vector, L ricinus.},

Abstract = {Since 1997, north-eastern Italy has been repeatedly challenged by avian
   influenza (AI) infections caused by viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes.
   The penetration of such infections in the industrial circuit in densely
   populated poultry areas (DPPAs) resulted in massive spread, and early
   attempts to control Al only by stamping-out and restriction policies
   resulted in death or culling of millions of birds. The re-emergence or
   the introduction of Al viruses in the same DPPA resulted in the
   development of an emergency vaccination programme based on the use of
   heterologous vaccination and a companion discriminatory test. By
   enabling the detection of field exposure in vaccinated animals, the
   application of this system, in conjunction with a monitoring programme
   and a well-defined territorial strategy has resulted in the eradication
   of H7N1 and H7N3 epidemics that occurred between 2000 and 2004.
   Retrospective analysis of the Al outbreaks in north-eastern Italy
   coupled with surveillance programmes in wild birds and in hobby flocks
   indicating that certain areas are at continuous high risk of infection,
   was the rationale for developing and implementing a bivalent H5/H7 pilot
   vaccination programme in a restricted area of the DPPA. Laboratory and
   field evidence indicate that vaccinated animals are more resistant to
   challenge and shed lower amounts of virus, thus acting as a tool for
   both prevention and control, thus limiting the impact of Al infections.},

Abstract = {In this work we report the first two cases of human granulocytic
   ehrlichiosis (HGE) in Sardinia. In early September 2004, a 69-year-old
   woman (patient 1) was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Institute of
   Sassari for rickettsiosis like-syndrome: high fever (39.5-40 degrees C),
   dyspnea, reduced consciousness, vomiting, and cutaneous rash. In late
   September 2004, a 30-year-old man (patient 2) with high fever was
   admitted for an evident palmar and oral erythema, edema of the labium,
   very intense arthralgia, myalgia, and dyspnea. In these two hospitalized
   patients, the diagnosis was made through indirect IgM and IgG
   immunofluorescent technique and confirmed by the presence of the
   specific DNA in the leukocytes. The two patients were A.
   phagocytophilum-PCR positive.},

Abstract = {An inactivated vaccine against rabies virus was prepared from the
   attenuated ATCC PV-12 viral rabbit Pasteur strain. The virus was grown
   on Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK21) cells, and the supernatant was purified
   by filtration and inactivated with beta-propriolactone. The inactivated
   product was checked according to the NHI and European Pharmacopoeia
   methods.
   Part of the product was then Iyophilised and the other part was
   adjuvanted with Al(OH)(3). Both parts were used to vaccinate and boost
   groups of horses, cattle and sheep at different intervals. Their
   immunogenicity was compared with a similar commercial product.
   Blood samples were collected on a regular basis and the antibody titre
   was determined by the Fluorescence Antibody Virus Neutralisation (FAVN)
   test.
   No significant differences were found between species after both
   inoculations even though the immune response increased in intensity and
   duration after the booster dose in all the animals tested and was
   stronger and lasted longer with the adjuvanted aliquot.},

Abstract = {The genus Anaplasma (Rickettsiales: Anaplasmataceae) includes several
   pathogens such as A. marginale and A. phagocytophilum that have an
   impact on veterinary and human health. In this study, we characterized
   A. marginale and A. phagocytophilum infections in humans, wild and
   domestic animals, and ticks in southern Europe (particularly in
   south-central Spain and in Sicily) by means of serologic study, PCR, and
   sequence analysis of major surface proteins (msp) 1 alpha and 4 and 16S
   rDNA. The results suggest that A. marginale infections in this region
   are maintained in cattle and deer, with ticks and tabanids serving as
   biological and mechanical vectors of the pathogen, respectively.
   Infections with A. phagocytophilum may occur in humans and are
   maintained in cattle, donkeys, deer, and birds and are most likely
   transmitted by several tick species with as yet an unknown role as
   reservoir hosts for other wild and domesticated mammals. The presence of
   concurrent infections in cattle and deer suggests that these pathogens
   may multiply in the same reservoir host and illustrates the complexity
   of the epidemiology of bovine and human anaplasmosis in this region.},

Abstract = {The origin and evolution of the type O foot-and-mouth disease viruses (
   FMDV) that caused the outbreak occurrence in Italy in 1993, the first
   episode of the disease in the EU after adoption of a non-vaccination
   policy in 1991, have been studied by the analysis of sequences encoding
   three main antigenic sites on the viral capsid proteins. The
   phylogenetic tree derived from sequences spanning the carboxyterminal
   end of VP1 showed that these Italian viruses were grouped in the ME-SA
   topotype, closely related to viruses that circulated previously in the
   Middle East. The analysis of the nucleotide sequences in VP1, VP2 and
   VP3 showed a co-circulation during the epizootic of genetic variants,
   including viruses with amino acid replacements in VP3. For some of the
   isolates analyzed, values of fixation of nucleotide substitutions per
   year were observed in the three regions analyzed, ranging from 1.5 to
   5.1 x 10(-2). The use of a panel of new monoclonal antibodies raised
   against an isolate from this outbreak, as well as monoclonal antibodies
   to FMDV O1-Switzerland 1965, showed differences in the reactivity
   pattern among some of the Italian isolates analyzed, which were
   consistent with the co-circulation of antigenic variants. These results
   support the potential for FMDV diversification in a limited period of
   time and under epidemiological conditions in which no vaccination
   campaigns were being implemented.},

Title = {Cell mediated immunity to meet the avian influenza A (H5N1) challenge},
Journal = {MEDICAL HYPOTHESES},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {67},
Number = {3},
Pages = {601-608},
Abstract = {Avian influenza A subtype H5N1 virus with its recombination potential
   with the human influenza viruses presents a threat of producing a
   pandemic. The consensus is that the occurrence of such a pandemic is
   only a matter of time. This is of great concern, since no effective
   vaccine is available or can be made before the occurrence of the event.
   We present arguments for the use of cell mediated immunity for the
   prevention of the infection as well as for the treatment of infected
   patients.
   Transfer factor (TF), an immunomodulator of tow molecular weight capable
   of transferring antigen-specific cell mediated immune information to
   T-lymphocytes, has been used successfully over the past quarter of a
   century for treating viral, parasitic, and fungal infections, as well as
   immunodeficiencies, neoplasias, allergies and autoimmune diseases.
   Moreover, several observations suggest that it can be utitised for
   prevention, transferring immunity prior to infection. Because it is
   derived from lymphocytes of immune donors, it has the potential to
   answer the challenge of unknown or ill-defined pathogens. Indeed, it is
   possible to obtain an antigen-specific TF preparation to a new pathogen
   before its identification. Thus, a specific TF to a new influenza virus
   can be made swiftly and used for prevention as well as for the treatment
   of infected patients. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   the various devices. The project also aims to enable not only querying
   of information but also the execution of entries and updates in the BDN.
   The various active multi-channel modes make system access independent of

Abstract = {Cellular prion protein PrPc), the normal isoform of the pathogenic
   peptide (PrPsc) responsible of the transmissible spongiform
   encephalopaties (TSEs), is present in many neural tissues, including
   neuromuscular junctions (NMJ).
   To analyze if this protein could influence the synaptic transmission, we
   performed an electrophysiological approach to Study the effect of
   cellular prion protein on a mammalian neuromuscular junction.
   The loose patch clamp (LPC) technique enables the study of the whole
   preparation including the pre- and the post-synaptic domains. In a mouse
   phrenic-diaphragm preparation, nanomolar concentrations of cellular
   prion protein were able to induce a very striking potentiation of the
   acetylcholine (ACh) release.
   The effect was mainly pre-synaptic with an increase of the amplitude of
   the miniature end-plate currents, probably calcium dependent, Moreover,
   an apparent facilitation of the synaptic transmission was noted. The
   results clearly indicate that cellular prion protein may play a key role
   in the function of the neuromuscular junction. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Chimerism, defined as the co-existence of cells of different origin
   within the same organism, has received much attention in hematopoietic
   cell and organ transplantation because of the strict relationship
   between its establishment and the induction of specific tolerance.
   Traditional methods applied for chimerism detection, such as
   immunohistochemistry, cytogenetics, fluorescent-activated cell sorter
   analysis, and serological and biochemical testing, are limited by their
   sensitivity. We have established a highly sensitive molecular approach
   based on the amplification of the mitochondrial cytochrome B gene and
   tested its specificity and sensitivity level in six different mammalian
   species, including human, pig, mouse, rat, sheep and rabbit. Increased
   sensitivity of detection of specific amplification products was obtained
   by the non-radioactive Southern blot technique. This novel approach
   allows the detection of one cell against the background of 1 to 4 x
   10(6) xenogenec cells and will be helpful for high-sensitivity analysis
   of donor cell engraftment after xenotransplantation procedures in these
   animal models.},

Abstract = {Our study is based on the collection of blood and ticks from sheep in
   Iran and Italy. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was performed to
   target the 18S rRNA gene and RLB was performed using previously
   published probes. In Italy and Iran 78.7\% and 76.0\% of the sheep were
   PCR positive, which after sequencing and RLB showed that they were
   Theiteria ovis and Theileria lestoquardi, respectively. Phylogenetic
   analysis was performed using the Clustal W multiple sequence alignment
   program and our sequences were compared with more than 50 others already
   published in the EMBL database. Our T lestoquardi sequences linked with
   other T lestoquardi sequences from Iran, Tanzania, and Sudan and
   Theileria annulata showed the importance of having species-specific
   probes between these two species. However, distinctive clades were found
   between T lestoquardi ticks and those found in sheep blood. Italian T
   ovis seemed to be closer to Theileria spp. from Namibia and Iran than
   with other T ovis from Spain, Turkey, Tanzania, and Sudan adding some
   information to the controversy about this species. However, some
   confusion was found on the existing database where the location of
   pathogens, years, and species names was inaccurate and when available
   sequences were not always appropriately used. This article will discuss
   our results and some comparisons with other phylogenetic approaches.},

Abstract = {The results of a 2-year survey on ticks infesting livestock on farms in
   Western Sicily, Italy, are reported. Several dogs living in the same
   area were also examined for ticks. Moreover, free-living ticks from one
   cattle farm were caught by CO2 traps and flagging. A total of 6208
   specimens was collected belonging to 9 species: Rhipicephalus bursa
   (32.4\%), Rhipicephalus turanicus (22.7\%), Rhipicephalus sanguineus
   (19.3\%), Hyalomma lusitanicum (12.0\%), Haemaphysalis punctata (7.8\%),
   Hyalomma marginatum (3.5\%), Dermacentor marginatus (1.4\%), Ixodes
   ricinus (0.8\%) and Ixodes hexagonus (0.1\%). The species belonging to
   the genus Rhipicephalus were present on all hosts and habitats
   monitored, R. bursa was found to be abundant on cattle (46.3\%) and
   sheep (62.0\%), R. sanguineus was prevalent on dogs (50.4\%), and R.
   turanicus on donkeys (41.0\%) and as free-living species (48.5\%).},

Abstract = {The European Union has regulated the use of non-steroidal
   anti-inflammatory drugs Phi NSAIDs) in animal production and requires
   its member states to detect their residues in different matrices. In
   this work, a detailed MS and MS/MS study by ion-trap mass spectrometry
   of fourteen NSAIDs is described. Two multi-residue reversed-phase
   LC/ESI-MS/MS methods were developed, one for the determination of
   salicylic acid, naproxen, carprofen, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, niflumic
   acid and meclofenamic acid in the negative ion mode, and the other for
   the determination of ketoprofen, suxibutazone, diclofenac, mefenamic
   acid, tolfenamic acid, phenylbutazone and its metabolite oxyphenbutazone
   in the positive ion mode. It was thus possible to confirm up to 14
   different NSAID residues in serum and plasma samples of farmed animals,
   after chromatographic separation by a linear gradient. These substances
   were chosen as representative of different chemical subclasses of
   NSAIDs. The two methods were also validated in-house at three
   contamination levels, evaluating specificity and calculating mean
   recoveries, repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility. The
   MS/MS product ion spectra were successfully used for the qualitative
   identification of all the drugs tested. All the NSAIDs, apart from
   salicylic acid, were recovered in high amounts, ranging between 71.6\%
   and 100.9\%. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

   for citizens, enterprises and/or other public administrations. The
   project's main goal is to provide citizens with a tool which describes
   the services offered by Public Administrations, guiding them in their
   enquiries/choices and representing these services as a whole. The entire
   system is in fact designed with a service-based rather than
   organization-based main access. Service quality is ensured through the
   system's continuous update, performed directly by providers.
   The added value of this system is the unified electronic management of
   procedures involving several administrations or different units of the
   same organization. It therefore helps streamline administrative
   activities and so saves the money and time of citizens and enterprises.},

   goldfish (Carassius auratus) juveniles exposed to 17-beta estradiol and

Abstract = {Many synthetic chemicals, termed xenoestrogens, have been shown to
   interact as agonists with the estrogen receptor (ER) to elicit
   biological responses similar to those of natural hormones. To date, the
   regulation of vitellogenesis in oviparous vertebrates has been widely
   used for evaluation of estrogenic effects. Therefore, Carassius auratus
   juveniles were chosen as a fish model for studying the effects of
   estradiol-17 beta and different concentrations (10(-6) and 10(-7) M) of
   4-nonylphenol (4-NP) on the expression of liver ER beta-1 subtype;
   plasma vitellogenin and sex steroids (androgens and estradiol-17 beta)
   were also evaluated together with the bioaccumulation process, through
   mass-spectrometry. C. auratus is a species widespread in the aquatic
   environment and, on the toxicological point of view, can be considered a
   good ``sentinel{''} species. Juveniles of goldfish were maintained in
   tanks with only tap water or water with different concentrations (10(-6)
   and 10(-7) M) of 4-nonylphenol (4-NP), or 10(-7) M of estradiol-17 beta.
   After 3 weeks of treatment, animals were anesthetized within 5 min after
   capture, and blood was immediately collected into heparinized syringes
   by cardiac puncture and stored at -70 degrees C; the gonads were fixed,
   then frozen and stored at -70 degrees C; the whole fish, liver, and
   muscle tissues were harvested and immediately stored at -70 degrees C
   for molecular biology experiments and bioaccumulation measurements. The
   estrogenic effects of 4-NP were evidenced by the presence of plasma
   vitellogenin in juveniles exposed both to estradiol-17 beta and the two
   doses of 4-NP; moreover, exposure to 4-NP also increased aromatization
   of androgens, as suggested by decreasing androgens and increasing
   estradiol-17 beta plasma levels. The changes of these parameters were in
   agreement with the increasing transcriptional rate of ER beta-1 mRNA in
   the liver, demonstrating that both estradiol-17 beta and 4-NP modulate
   the vitellogenin rate through interaction with the ER beta-1 subtype.
   The present study also suggests that 4-NP at the concentration of 10(-6)
   M bioaccumulates in the liver. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   serological surveillance elements. The National Reference Centre for
   Veterinary Epidemiology-Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale
   dell'Abruzzo e del Molise `G. Caporale' - developed a Web-based National
   Information System (NIS) and a Geographical Information System (GIS) to
   collect and manage data from Veterinary Services across Italy. The
   system was designed to gather and spread information in order to support
   the management of control activities and to provide an early warning
   system. Surveillance data are displayed to the user in different ways:
   reports, tables and interactive maps.},

Abstract = {Organisms in the genus Anaplasma are obligate intracellular pathogens
   that multiply in both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. The type
   species, A. marginate, causes bovine anaplasmosis and only infects ticks
   and ruminants. A. phagocytophilum causes human and animal granulocytic
   anaplasmosis, and genetically closely related strains show a wide host
   range, including ticks, ruminants, rodents, equids, canids, birds, and
   humans. Recent reports demonstrated that A. marginate and A.
   phagocytophilum co-exist in geographic areas and that concurrent
   infections occur in ruminants and ticks. In this study, we characterized
   A. marginate and A. phagocytophilum infections in wild and domestic
   animals, and ticks collected in central Spain by serology, PCR, and
   sequence of 16S rRNA genotypes. Species tested included humans, cattle,
   dogs, rodents, Iberian red deer, European wild boar, birds, and ticks.
   Species of hematophagous Diptera were analyzed as potential mechanical
   vectors of Anaplasma spp. A. marginate was detected in tabanids, ticks,
   cattle, and deer, while A. phagocytophilum was detected in ticks, deer,
   cattle, and birds. Concurrent infections of the two Anaplasma were found
   in cattle and deer. These results illustrate the complexity of the
   epizootiology of A. marginate and A. phagocytophilum in regions where
   both pathogens co-exist and share common reservoir hosts and vectors.
   The increasing contact between wildlife, domestic animals, and human
   populations increases the risk of outbreaks of human and bovine
   anaplasmosis, and the difficulty of implementing surveillance and
   control measures.},

Abstract = {Two epidemics of avian influenza due to H5 and H7 highly pathogenic
   viruses occurred in poultry in Italy in 1997/98 and 1999/2000,
   respectively. The circulation of these serotypes in wild aquatic birds
   was investigated examining 638 cloacal swabs and 621 sera collected from
   150 gulls, 162 coots, and 326 ducks trapped in Italian wetlands from
   1998 to 2000. Seroprevalences against influenza A viruses, detected by a
   double-antibody sandwich-blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (
   ELISA), were 11\% in gulls, 16\% in coots, and 45\% in ducks. Among the
   Anatidae group, duck species wintering in Mediterranean areas showed
   significantly higher values than ducks wintering in South-Saharan areas
   of Africa. In order to detect H5 and H7 antibodies, the
   haemagglutination-inhibition assay and two competitive ELISA tests
   (H5-ELISA and H7-ELISA) using monoclonal antibodies specific for H5 and
   H7 subtypes were performed. None of the aquatic bird species were found
   seropositive for H7 subtype, whereas H5-positive sera were found by both
   the haemagglutination-inhibition and ELISA assays in ducks only. The
   highest H5 seroprevalences were detected by H5-ELISA; overall, 5\%
   (10/201) of duck species wintering in Mediterranean areas tested
   positive by this assay, with annual seroprevalences ranging from 2\%
   (2/123) to 12\% (6/51). In the present study, only five viruses
   belonging to H1N1, H11N6, and H2N3 subtypes were isolated from ducks.
   However, the H5 seroconversion observed in one mallard duck at the
   beginning of 1998 indicates that H5 virus circulation also occurred in
   the study area.},

Abstract = {Food habits of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) were studied in the Aosta
   Valley region (NW Italian Alps) and were related to the prevalence of
   Trichinella infection in the red fox itself and in two Mustelid species
   (the stone marten (Martes foina) and the badger (Meles meles)). The
   search of Trichinella by the automatic digestion of muscles samples led
   us to determine a prevalence of 3.5 +/- 1.2\% in red foxes, 7.9 +/-
   4.3\% in stone martens and 1.9 +/- 1.8\% in badgers, with no significant
   differences among the species. All larvae were identified as Trichinella
   britovi. The fox diet was assessed through the analysis of both faeces
   (n=180) and the stomach contents of road-killed animals (n=109). Our
   results confirmed the opportunistic feeding behaviour of the red fox,
   which is able to use various trophic resources, both of animal and
   vegetal origin: e.g. wild and cultivated fruits (F\%=47.1; V\%=67.3),
   rodents (F\%=22.8; V\%=64.8) and carrion (F\%=15.6; V\%=78.6) formed the
   bulk of the fox's diet. The frequency of occurrence of potential events
   of cannibalism was 1.0\%, even if the complete absence of undigested
   remains, other than hairs, suggested the possibility of confusing
   cannibalism with coat-cleaning. We suggest that intra-specific
   necrophagy could not represent the unique way of transmission of the
   nematode in natural conditions.},

Abstract = {We have measured the content of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, and
   polychlorinated dibenzofurans (together defined as ``dioxins{''}) in 269
   samples of food of animal origin collected through the regional
   veterinary services, covering the national territory. Quantification of
   the dioxins was accomplished by isotope dilution method, and toxic
   equivalents (TEQ) were calculated. The average daily food intake was
   obtained from two main sources: national data collected by the National
   Institute of Nutrition, and data from an ongoing cohort study on diet
   and cancer including 40,000 Italian subjects.
   The mean value of dioxins measured in food of animal origin was 0.144
   +/- 0.266 pg-TEQ/g (range: 0.003-1.655 pg-TEQ/g). Fish was the item with
   the highest content. The estimated intake of dioxins with main food
   items of animal origin is presented. The major contribution to dioxins
   intake with food comes from cow milk and fish consumption. These results
   are in agreement with what observed in studies conducted in other
   countries, such as Germany, Finland, Japan, Spain, and are below the
   limits set by the European legislation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Tortoises of the genus Testudo living in Italy are Testudo hermanni,
   Testudo graeca and Testudo marginata. Although a great deal of
   information has been acquired on the internal medicine and surgery on
   these animals, little is known of their parasitological fauna. A survey
   on the presence of gastro-intestinal parasitic nematodes in tortoises
   bred in Italy was carried out to acquire extensive epidemiological data.
   Stool samples of 62 tortoises (37 T. hermanni hermanni, 13 T. graeca, 6
   T. hermanni boettgeri and 6 T. marginata) were macroscopically examined
   and subjected to qualitative (flotation and Baermann techniques) and
   quantitative (McMaster technique) microscopic examinations. Adult
   nematodes were identified using morphological keys. Eggs of oxyurids
   (species indistinguishable) and adults of Alaeuris numidica, Mehdiella
   microstoma, Mehdiella uncinata, Tachygonetria longicollis, Tachygonetria
   conica and Tachygonetria palearcticus (Oxyurida, Pharyngodonidae);
   larvae and adults of Atractis dactyluris (Ascaridida, Atractidae); and
   eggs and adults of Angusticaecum holopterum (Ascaridida, Ascarididae)
   were identified in all animals >1 year, whereas all tortoises <1 year of
   age were parasite-free. Moreover, this study reports for the first time
   A. numidica and M. microstoma in T. marginata. This work shows that
   nematodes affecting tortoises are diffused in Italy and highlights the
   need to investigate their epidemiology more in depth.},

Abstract = {An epidemiological survey was carried out to investigate the
   distribution of the VP7 and VP4 specificities of lapine rotaviruses
   (LRVs) in rabbitries from different geographical regions of Italy.
   Almost all the strains were characterized as P{[}22],G3, confirming the
   presence of the newly-recognized rotavirus P{[}22] VP4 allele in Italian
   rabbits. Only one P{[}14],G3 LRV strain was identified and two samples
   contained a mixed (P{[}14] + {[}22],G3) rotavirus infection. All the LRV
   strains analyzed exhibited a genogroup I VP6 specificity and a long
   dsRNA electropherotype. However, one of the P{[} 14],G3 strains
   possessed a super-short pattern. Altogether, these data highlight the
   epidemiological relevance of the P{[}221 LRVs in Italian rabbitries. (C)

Abstract = {A foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) polymerase (3D) with amino acid
   replacements G118D, V239M and G373D (triple DMD mutant) was obtained
   from a molecular clone derived from a virus population treated with
   ribavirin, in the transition to error catastrophe (virus extinction
   through lethal mutagenesis). DMD 3D was expressed in Escherichia coli,
   purified, and its activity compared with that of wild-type enzyme and
   mutant enzymes with either replacement G118D, G118A or D338A (the latter
   affecting the catalytic motif YGDD), generated by site-directed
   mutagenesis. No differences among the enzymes were noted in their
   interaction with monoclonal antibodies specific for the FMDV polymerase.
   Mutant enzymes with G118D or G118A showed a 100-fold decrease in
   polymerization activity relative to wild-type 3D, using
   poly(A)/oligo(dT)(15) and poly(A)/VPg as template-primers, under several
   reaction conditions. As expected, the activity of 3D with D338A was
   undetectable (< 0.01 times the value for wild-type 3D). DMD and the G118
   mutants showed impaired binding to template-primer RNA whereas the D338A
   mutant showed a binding similar to wild-type 3D. Transfection of cells
   with FMDV RNA encoding DMD 3D resulted in selection of revertant viruses
   that maintained only substitutions V239M and G373D. Consistently, when
   infectious transcripts encoded 3D with either G118D, G118A or D338A,
   viruses with reversions to the wild-type sequence were isolated. The
   implication of G118 in template-primer binding is supported by the
   location of this residue in the template-binding groove of the FMDV
   polymerase. In addition to identifying an amino acid residue that is
   critical for the binding of polymerase to RNA, the results document the
   presence of defective genomes in the transition of virus to error
   catastrophe. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this work, gold based quartz crystals were modified with synthetic
   oligopeptides, designed as biomimetic traps using computational
   approach, to obtain piezoelectric sensors selective to the dioxins.
   After the optimisation of the methodology using standard solutions, as a
   practical analytical application, three food matrices (poultry, eggs and
   milk) spiked at three different dioxin levels were analysed. The
   cross-reactivity of the system was also quantified spiking the samples
   with commercial polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and a mixture of PCBs
   and dioxins. The response of the sensors was not influenced by any of
   matrices tested either before or after the cleanup steps. The negligible
   rnatrix-effect could lead to a simplification of the extraction
   procedure. Basing on this screening method a rapid assignment of the
   samples to different degrees of toxicity could be possible reducing the
   use of high-resolution gas chromatography and high-resolution mass
   spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS). (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Although Anaplasma marginale was known to be endemic in Italy, the
   diversity of Anaplasma spp. from this area have not been characterized.
   In this study, the prevalence of Anaplasma spp. antibodies in randomly
   selected farm animals collected on the island of Sicily was determined
   by use of a MSP5 cELISA for Anaplasma spp. and an immunofluorescence
   test specific for Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Genetic variation among
   strains of Anaplasma spp. from animals and ticks was characterized using
   the A. marginale msg1 alpha and the Anaplasma spp. msp4 genes. Eight
   species of ticks were collected and tested by PCR. Seropositivity for
   Anaplasma spp. and A. phagocytophilum was detected in bovine and ovine
   samples. All the donkeys were seropositive for A. phagocytophilum but
   not for Anaplasma spp. FourA. marginale genotypes were identified by
   msp4 sequences from bovine and tick samples. Two new genotypes of
   Anaplasma ovis were characterized in sheep. The sequences of A.
   phagocytophilum from three donkeys proved to be identical to the
   sequence of the MRK equine isolate from California. Six A. marginale
   genotypes were found in cattle and one tick using the A. marginale msp1
   alpha sequences. All genotypes had four repeated sequences in the
   N-terminal portion of the MSP1a, except for one that had five repeats.
   The Italian strains of A. marginale contained three repeat sequences
   that were not reported previously. Definition of the diversity of
   Anaplasma spp. in Sicily reported, herein is fundamental to development
   of control strategies for A. marginale, A. ovis and A. phagocytophilum
   in Sicily. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Boldenone is an androgenic anabolic steroid (AAS) intensively used for
   growth promoting purposes in animals destined for meat production and as
   a performance enhancer in athletics. Therefore its use is officially
   banned either in animals intended for consumption or in humans. Because
   most anabolic steroids are completely metabolized and usually no parent
   steroid is excreted, metabolite identification is crucial to detect the
   illegal use of anabolic steroids either in humans or in livestock.
   The aim of this work is the investigation of 17 beta-boldenone and its
   main metabolites, 17 beta-sulphate, 17 beta-glucuronide, 5
   beta-androst-1-en-17 beta-ol-3-one and 17 alpha-boldenone, in human and
   bovine urine developing a multiresidue analysis.
   After solid phase extraction of urine samples, detection is carried out
   by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in
   multiple reaction monitoring. The average recovery for all the
   investigated compounds is above 70\%. The developed method is very easy,
   quick and highly specific. Linearity, precision, decision limit and
   detection capability were also evaluated. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) is a syndrome caused by the
   consumption of shellfish contaminated with neurotoxins produced by
   organisms of the marine dinoflagellate genus Alexandrium. A. minutum is
   the most widespread species responsible for PSP in the Western
   Mediterranean basin. The standard monitoring of shellfish farms for the
   presence of harmful algae and related toxins usually requires the
   microscopic examination of phytoplankton populations, bioassays and
   toxin determination by HPLC. These procedures are time-consuming and
   require remarkable experience, thus limiting the number of specimens
   that can be analyzed by a single laboratory unit. Molecular biology
   techniques may be helpful in the detection of target microorganisms in
   field samples. In this study, we developed a qualitative PCR assay for
   the rapid detection of all potentially toxic species belonging to the
   Alexandrium genus and specifically A. minutum, in contaminated mussels.
   Alexandrium genus-specific primers were designed to target the 5.8S rDNA
   region, while an A. minutum species-specific primer was designed to bind
   in the ITS1 region. The assay was validated using several fixed seawater
   samples from the Mediterranean basin, which were analyzed using PCR
   along with standard microscopy procedures. The assay provided a rapid
   method for monitoring the presence of Alexandrium spp. in mussel
   tissues, as well as in seawater samples. The results showed that PCR is
   a valid, rapid alternative procedure for the detection of target
   phytoplankton species either in seawater or directly in mussels, where
   microalgae can accumulate. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Ethotest: A new model to identify (shelter) dogs' skills as service

Abstract = {The paucity of dogs dedicated to animal-assisted therapy (AAT) for
   disabled people creates long waiting lists worldwide and compromises the
   health of the few certified animals by demanding too much work from them
   at times, thus jeopardizing their future as service dogs. In an attempt
   to obviate this situation, a mathematical model has been conceived to
   select animals endowed with a set of specific inborn skills from a
   population of sheltered dogs. The model is able to select dogs capable
   of creating a special bond with humans and able to work anywhere and
   with any human partner or team; it represents a rapid, inexpensive and
   coherent method and has been validated after I year of observation. The
   algorithm consists of three steps. Step A is a test assessing the
   aggressiveness and temperament of animals and selection occurs based on
   a binary criterion (yes or no). Step B is a test comprising three items
   and selects animals able to interact with humans; dogs have to fulfil
   two conditions to pass on to Step C. Step C is a test evaluating the
   animal's ability to respond appropriately to easy commands
   (trainability) given by different partners dogs have to fulfil two
   interrelated conditions judged more flexibly than in test B. The aims of
   the Ethotest are: (a) to prevent aggressive animals from entering
   animal-assisted activity and/or Therapy programmes, (b) to select dogs
   with the right aptitude and especially to restrict selection to dogs
   that offer consistent responses (c) to include both male and female
   purebreds or mix breeds older than 1 year of age, (d) to identify
   animals able to work with different partners. Moreover, the aim of this
   contribution is to share with the Scientific community an easy method to
   select shelter dogs as safe companion animals. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) based on soluble antigens
   derived from promastigote or amastigote-like stages of Leishmania
   infantum and on the recombinant rK39 antigen, each in combination with
   different conjugates {[}anti-immunoglobulin G1 {[}IgG1], anti-IgG2,
   anti-IgG(gamma), and anti-IgG heavy plus light chains], were compared to
   an immunofluorescent-antibody test (IFAT) and two commercially available
   rapid test systems (DiaMed-Vet-IT Leish and ID-PaGIA canine
   leishmaniasis antibody test) for the detection of specific
   anti-Leishmania antibodies in symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs with
   proven L. infantum infections. ELISAs based on soluble promastigote and
   amastigote antigens had very high sensitivities in symptomatic (n = 30;
   100\%) and asymptomatic dogs (n = 17; 94.1 to 100\%), except when
   combined with the anti-IgG1 conjugate (41.2 to 82.4\%). Specificities
   were high for all combinations (n = 50; 96 to 100\%). The rK39 ELISA
   detected fewer asymptomatic cases (sensitivities, 52.9 to 64.7\%) but
   was highly specific (96 to 100\%). The IFAT was 90\% sensitive in
   symptomatic dogs but was significantly less sensitive in asymptomatic
   cases (29.4\%). However, it had an excellent specificity (100\%). Test
   performances of the rapid tests based on the rK39 antigen were
   comparable to the ELISAs based on the same antigen. ELISAs based on
   soluble promastigote or amastigote antigens seem to be most suited for
   the serological diagnosis of canine Leishmania infections in both
   symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs. IFAT and the rK39 ELISA lack
   sensitivity in asymptomatic cases but are highly specific. Rapid tests
   like the rK39 dipstick test or the ID-PaGIA are helpful for confirming
   clinically suspected cases because of their high specificities in
   symptomatic animals.},

Abstract = {The complete nucleotide sequences of the VP2 segments of bluetongue
   virus (BTV) isolates recovered from Italy, Greece and Israel, from 1998
   to 2003, were determined. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences,
   those from related viruses and the South African vaccine strains, were
   used to determine the probable geographic origin of BTV incursions into
   Italy. Results indicated that viruses from each of the four serotypes
   isolated in Italy (2, 4, 9 and 16) possibly had a different origin.
   Analysis of the bluetongue virus serotype 2 (BTV-2) isolates gave
   evidence that this serotype probably moved from Tunisia. BTV-4 results
   showed probable incursion from the southwest and not from Greece or
   Israel. BTV-9 isolates clearly have an eastern origin (most probably
   Greece), whereas BTV-16 isolates are indistinguishable from the BTV-16
   live attenuated vaccine strain. The phylogenetic findings were supported
   by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis of the complete
   amplified genome of each isolate except for BTV-16 Italian field
   isolate, which showed a slightly different PAGE profile. A combination
   of the complete VP2 sequencing and PAGE analysis of complete genomes,
   allowed not only phylogenetic analysis, but also vaccine detection and
   assessment of reassortment events.},

Abstract = {Thirty-eight bacterial strains isolated from hazelnut (Corylus avellana)
   cv. Tonda Gentile delle Langhe showing a twig dieback in Piedmont and
   Sardinia, Italy, were studied by a polyphasic approach. All strains were
   assessed by fatty acids analysis and repetitive sequence-based
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fingerprinting using BOX and ERIC primer
   sets. Representative strains also were assessed by sequencing the 16S
   rDNA and hrpL genes, determining the presence of the syrB gene, testing
   their biochemical and nutritional characteristics, and determining their
   pathogenicity to hazelnut and other plants species or plant organs.
   Moreover, they were compared with reference strains of other
   phytopathogenic pseudomonads. The strains from hazelnut belong to
   Pseudomonas syringae (sensu latu), LOPAT group Ia. Both fatty acids and
   repetitive-sequence-based PCR clearly discriminate such strains from
   other Pseudomonas spp., including P. avellanae and other P. syringae
   pathovars as well as P. syringae pv. syringae strains from hazelnut.
   Also, the sequencing of 16S rDNA and hrpL genes differentiated them from
   P. avellanae and from P. syringae pv. syringae. They did not possess the
   syrB gene. Some nutritional tests also differentiated them from related
   R syringae pathovars. Upon artificial inoculation, these strains incited
   severe twig diebacks only on hazelnut. Our results justify the creation
   of a new pathovar because the strains from hazelnut constitute a
   homogeneous group and a discrete phenon. The name of R syringae pv.
   coryli is proposed and criteria for routine identification are
   presented.},

Abstract = {The authors studied the persistence of infection in 46 ewes
   experimentally infected with Brucella melitensis biovar 3 and monitored
   through three subsequent reproductive cycles. The entire experimental
   period lasted for 151 weeks. Infection of ewes and elimination of
   Brucella in milk, or its presence in vaginal discharges, persisted
   throughout the duration of the trial, as demonstrated by recurrent
   elimination of Brucella in milk and vaginal discharges. Brucella
   melitensis was recovered from the tissues of one ewe killed at the end
   of the trial. The strain was recovered from vaginal swabs and milk
   following parturition in the third reproductive cycle from an ewe that
   had aborted in the first cycle but was not pregnant in the second cycle.
   From a public health point of view, the periodical recovery of Brucella
   from the milk during the entire trial period illustrated that
   brucellosis in sheep remains a continuous occupational risk and a
   significant public health problem for consumers of fresh milk and milk
   products. That risk may persist for at least 3 years following the
   initial infection of the flock. Lamb antibody titres became negative in
   all lambs within 5 months after birth. This suggested that serological
   tests on lambs may have no practical diagnostic significance if
   performed during the first 5 months of life. Nevertheless, the birth of
   three infected lambs suggested that the phenomenon of latent carrier
   state may represent another way for B. melitensis to persist in a flock.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present work was to develop two new independent SYBR
   Green I-based real-time PCR assays for both detection and quantification
   of betanodavirus, an RNA virus that infects several species of marine
   teleost fish causing massive mortalities in larvae and juveniles. The
   assays utilized two pairs of primers targeting highly conserved regions
   of both the RNA molecules forming the betanodavirus genome: RNAI
   encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and RNA2 encoding the
   coat protein (CP). The specificity of amplifications was monitored by
   the melting analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis of the amplified
   products. The applicability of these assays was confirmed with 21
   betanodavirus strains, covering all the four main clades. In addition, a
   BLAST (NCBI) search with the primer sequences showed no genomic
   cross-reactivity with other viruses. The new assays were able to
   quantify concentrations of betanodavirus genes ranging from 10(1) to 108
   copies per reaction. The intra-assay coefficients of variation (CV) of
   threshold cycle (C-t) values of the assays were 1.5\% and 1.4\% for CP
   and RdRP RNAs, respectively. The inter-assay CVs of C-t values were
   2.3\% and 2.4\% for CP and RdRP RNAs, respectively. Moreover, regression
   analysis showed a significant correlation (R-2 > 0.97) between genome
   number, as determined by real-time PCR assays and the corresponding
   virus titer expressed as TCID(50/)ml of two different betanodavirus
   strains propagated in cell culture. The two assays were compared with a
   previously established one-step RT-PCR assay and with the classical
   virus isolation test and found to be more sensitive. In conclusion, the
   developed real-time RT-PCR assays are a reliable, specific and sensitive
   tool for the quantitative diagnosis of betanodavirus. (c) 2005 Elsevier

   having snared a wild boar (Sus scrofa) sow, knifed it to death. The
   animal was retrieved by conservation officers at the scene before the
   poacher could remove the carcass. Subsequently, the suspect denied the
   charges. During a search of his home, a bloodstained knife was
   confiscated. A method to identify the species from the DNA extracted
   from the stains revealed the blood to be that of the non-domestic form
   of Sus scrofa. Further DNA typing for individual identity using
   species-specific single tandem repeats or microsatellites (STRs) showed
   that the DNA on the knife matched that of the poached boar. Based upon
   the forensic evidence obtained, the suspect was convicted of poaching
   and of cruelty to animals. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Toxocara canis (T canis) is originally a parasite of canine bitches and
   their pups. The pathogenicity of T canis infection is enhanced during
   pregnancy and puppyhood. The aim of this study was to investigate if
   modification of IFN gamma and IL-10 secretion occurs during infection in
   pregnant dogs and puppies. Analysis of cytokines secreted could let us
   hypothesize a role for IL-10 and/or IFN gamma in T. canis infection. We
   tested T. canis-specific production of IFN gamma and IL-10 by
   lymphocytes of pregnant dogs and their puppies after in vitro
   re-exposure to purified excretory/secretory antigen (ESAg) from T canis.
   Blood mononuclear cells (BMC) isolated from pregnant dogs and their
   puppies were cultured in the presence of ESAg. Cultures' supernatants
   were tested for cytokine levels by ELISA. Results obtained showed that
   IL-10 concentrations increased during pregnancy in infected animals and
   in the meantime IFN gamma production decreased. In puppyhood, we
   observed that, IL-10 concentration decreased with the age of puppies
   mainly in infected animals while IFN gamma increased. In conclusion, our
   data suggests that BMC of infected dogs have a particular modification
   of IL-10 and IFN gamma synthesis. These data could be the basis to
   design immunotherapeutic approaches. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {We evaluated the potential for avian-to-human transmission of low
   pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) and highly pathogenic avian influenza
   ( HPAI) H7N1 and LPAI H7N3 viruses that were responsible for several
   outbreaks of influenza in poultry in Italy between 1999 and 2003. A
   serological survey of poultry workers was conducted by use of a
   combination of methods. Evidence of anti-H7 antibodies was observed in
   3.8\% of serum samples collected from poultry workers during the period
   in 2003 when LPAI H7N3 virus was circulating. These findings highlight
   the need for surveillance in people occupationally exposed to avian
   influenza viruses, so that they can be monitored for the risk of
   avian-to-human transmission during outbreaks of avian influenza caused
   by both LPAI and HPAI viruses.},

Abstract = {Horse gastrointestinal myiasis caused by larvae of Gasterophilus spp.
   (Diptera, Oestridae) flies has a worldwide distribution and, where
   present, it is primarily caused by larvae of Gasterophilus intestinalis
   and Gasterophilus nasalis. Other species, i.e., Gasterophilus inermis,
   Gasterophilus pecorum and Gasterophilus haemorrhoidalis, present in
   different or in the same regions of the gastrointestinal tract, were
   only occasionally reported in very limited areas of eastern European
   Countries and in central Italy. With the aim to contribute data on the
   species composition of Gasterophilus and on the seasonal variation of
   the infection pattern in southern Italy, 152 native horses were
   necropsied from January to December 2003 and Gasterophilus larvae were
   collected from the stomach, the small intestine and the rectum of each
   of them. On the whole, 125 (82.2\%) horses were infected by larvae of
   Gasterophilus spp. and 214 second stage larvae (L 2) and 13,342 third
   stage larvae (U) collected. Five species of Gasterophilus were
   identified with the following prevalence: G. intestinalis = 95.2\%, G.
   nasalis = 44.8\%, G. inermis = 15.2\%, G. pecorum = 2.6\% and G.
   haemorrhoidalis = 0.8\%. L3 were retrieved throughout the observation
   period with the highest mean burdens from January to August 2003 while
   the lowest mean was registered from September to November 2003. L2 were
   collected in February-March 2003 and from September to December 2003.
   The majority of the animals (n = 66, 43.4\%) were infected with a single
   Gasterophilus species, however, 45 animals (29.6\%) harboured 2 species,
   12 animals (7.9\%) 3 species and 2 animals (1.3\%) 4 species. The trend
   of abundance in the L3 of G. intestinalis and G. nasalis, the most
   represented species, was highly concordant (r = 0.5, p < 0.001). A
   retrospective comparison of our results and of other data from four
   seasons of observation (1983-1986) in central Italy showed that the
   number of G. inermis, G. pecorum and G. haemorrhoidalis have been
   decreasing relative to G. intestinalis and G. nasalis which may suggest
   tendency toward the extinction of the three former species of
   Gasterophilus. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Biting midges of the genus Culicoides include vector species for
   orbiviral diseases, such as bluetongue and African horse sickness.
   Although the Afro-Asiatic species C. imicola is the major vector of
   bluetongue in the Mediterranean basin, recent outbreaks in regions where
   C. imicola is absent has incriminated other Culicoides, including those
   belonging to the Obsoletus Complex of the subgenus Avaritia Fox, 1955.
   The classical taxonomy of this species complex is unclear and this
   stimulated the molecular analysis of twenty Culicoides populations
   sampled from eighteen localities across Italy. Ribosomal internal
   transcribed spacer 2 sequences were used to characterize the intra- and
   interspecific variation between Italian members of the Obsoletus Complex
   and related species, by means of an analysis of molecular variance and
   phylogenetic analyses. Although morphological differentiation is often
   extremely difficult, the molecular analysis clearly demonstrated a high
   degree of divergence between most species. The study showed that at
   least seven species of the subgenus Avaritia occur in Italy; these are
   C. obsoletus, C. scoticus, C. montanus, C. dewulfi, C. imicola and two
   species that could not be identified with certainty, but one of which is
   similar to C. chiopterus. Finally, a simple polymerase chain reaction
   assay was developed that rapidly discriminates between four members of
   the Obsoletus Complex in Italy, a prerequisite for vector
   identification.},

Abstract = {Mycobacterium caprae, a recently defined member of the Mycobacterium
   tuberculosis complex, causes tuberculosis among animals and, to a
   limited extent, in humans in several European countries. To characterize
   M. caprae in comparison with other Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex
   members and to evaluate genotyping methods for this species, we analyzed
   232 M. caprae isolates by mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit
   (MIRU) genotyping and by spoligotyping. The isolates originated from 128
   distinct epidemiological settings in 10 countries, spanning a period of
   25 years. We found 78 different MIRU patterns (53 unique types and 25
   clusters with group sizes from 2 to 9) but only 17 spoligotypes, giving
   Hunter-Gaston discriminatory indices of 0.941 (MIRU typing) and 0.665
   (spoligotyping). For a subset of 103 M. caprae isolates derived from
   outbreaks or endemic foci, MIRU genotyping and IS6110 restriction
   fragment length polymorphism were compared and shown to provide similar
   results. MIRU loci 4, 26, and 31 were most discriminant in M. caprae,
   followed by loci 10 and 16, a combination which is different than those
   reported to discriminate M. bovis best. M. caprae MIRU patterns together
   with published data were used for phylogenetic inference analysis
   employing the neighbor-joining method. M. caprae isolates were grouped
   together, closely related to the branches of classical M. bovis, M.
   pinnipedii, M. microti, and ancestral M. tuberculosis, but apart from
   modern M. tuberculosis. The analysis did not reflect geographic patterns
   indicative of origin or spread of M. caprae. Altogether, our data
   confirm M. caprae as a distinct phylogenetic lineage within the
   Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex.},

Abstract = {Helicobacter pylori (Hp) is an organism commonly present worldwide in
   the human population, sometimes causing serious illnesses such as
   duodenal and gastric ulcers, adenocarcinoma of the stomach, and
   low-grade B-cell mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma of the
   stomach. This article describes a multiplex-touchdown PCR method for the
   identification and genotyping (vacA-s1/m1, s1/m2, and s2/m2-and cagA
   genes) of Hp directly from sheep milk artificially contaminated with Hp
   strains from human gastric biopsies and with Hp ATCC 43504. The strains
   from humans carried s1/m2 cagA(+) and s2/m2 cagA(-) allelic
   combinations, while the ATCC strains carried an s1/m1 cagA(+) allelic
   combination. The technique showed a sensitivity of 15 CFU/ml for species
   identification and of 1,500 CFU/ml for the detection of genes encoding
   for VacA and CagA. It has proven to be specific and rapid, and the
   authors suggest that it be used as a rapid screening method to ensure
   that sheep milk is uncontaminated with this organism.},

Abstract = {Swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV) is a picornavirus closely related
   to the human pathogen coxsackievirus B5. In common with other
   picornaviruses, the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) of SVDV contains an
   internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) that plays an important role in
   cap-independent translation. The aim of this study was to use RT-PCR and
   sequencing to characterize a fragment of the 5' UTR encompassing the
   entire IRES. Sequence analysis demonstrated high nucleotide identities
   within the IRES between 33 representative SVDV isolates. These data
   support the choice of this region as a diagnostic target and provide
   information for the improvement of laboratory-based molecular assays to
   detect SVDV. In contrast to the relative conservation of the IRES
   element, there was considerable nucleotide variability in the spacer
   region located between the cryptic AUG at the 3' end of the IRES and the
   initiation codon of the polyprotein. Interestingly, 11 SVDV isolates had
   block deletions of between 6 and 125 nt in this region. Nine of these
   isolates were of recent European origin and were phylogenetically
   closely related. In vitro growth studies showed that selected isolates
   with these deletions had a significantly reduced plaque diameter and
   grew to a significantly lower titre relative to an isolate with a
   full-length 5' UTR. Further work is required to define the significance
   of these deletions and to assess whether they impact on the pathogenesis
   of SVD.},

Title = {Multivariate factor analysis of Girgentana goat milk composition},
Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4},
Pages = {403-410},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {The interpretation of the several variables that contribute to defining
   milk quality is difficult due to the high degree of correlation among
   them. In this case, one of the best methods of statistical processing is
   factor analysis, which belongs to the multivariate groups; for our study
   this particular statistical approach was employed.
   A total of 1485 individual goat milk samples from 117 Girgentana goats,
   were collected fortnightly from January to July, and analysed for
   physical and chemical composition, and clotting properties. Milk pH and
   tritable acidity were within the normal range for fresh goat milk.
   Morning milk yield resulted 704 +/- 323 g with 3.93 +/- 1.23\% and 3.48
   +/- 0.38\% for fat and protein percentages, respectively. The milk urea
   content was 43.70 +/- 8.28 mg/dl. The clotting ability of Girgentana
   milk was quite good, with a renneting time equal to 16.96 +/- 3.08
   minutes, a rate of curd formation of 2.01 +/- 1.63 minutes and a curd
   firmness of 25.08 +/- 7.67 millimetres.
   Factor analysis was performed by applying axis orthogonal rotation
   (rotation type VARIMAX); the analysis grouped the milk components into
   three latent or common factors. The first, which explained 51.2\% of the
   total covariance, was defined as ``slow milks{''}, because it was linked
   to r and pH. The second latent factor, which explained 36.2\% of the
   total covariance, was defined as ``milk yield{''}, because it is
   positively correlated to the morning milk yield and to the urea content,
   whilst negatively correlated to the fat percentage. The third latent
   factor, which explained 12.6\% of the total covariance, was defined as
   ``curd firmness,{''} because it is linked to protein percentage, a30 and
   titatrable acidity. With the aim of evaluating the influence of
   environmental effects (stage of kidding, parity and type of kidding),
   factor scores were analysed with the mixed linear model. Results showed
   significant effects of the season of kidding and parity on common
   factors, while no differences were found between goats with one or more
   kids. The multivariate factor analysis technique was effective in
   describing the quality of Girgentana milk with a low number of new
   latent variables. These new variables have been useful in the study of
   the effect of some technical factors such as parity and season of
   kidding on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of milk production
   in this goat breed.},

Abstract = {The application of a selective culling programme in two scrapie affected
   flocks of Massese breed sheep is described. The genetic susceptibility
   of this breed and the sensitivity of different diagnostic methods in the
   pre-clinical diagnosis of scrapie were also investigated. Overall, 2,068
   clinically healthy sheep underwent PrP genotyping, providing the basis
   for selective culling. The prevalence of scrapie infection was
   investigated in susceptible sheep by two independent diagnostic methods.
   All the sheep older than 18 months (n = 620) were tested by Prionics(R)
   Check Western rapid test on the obex, with a prevalence of infection of
   3.9\%. Furthermore, 385 sheep underwent immunohistochemistry (IHC) on
   retropharyngeal lymph node (RPLN), with a prevalence of infection of
   5.2\%. Overall, 32 sheep were diagnosed with pre-clinical scrapie. Of
   these, 31 were positive by Western blot on the spleen, 29 by IHC on the
   RPLN and tonsil, 28 by IHC on the obex, 24 by rapid test, and only 18 by
   IHC on the third eyelid. All the scrapie positive sheep were of the
   ARQ/ARQ, ARQ/AHQ or ARQ/VRQ genotypes. No significant differences in
   scrapie prevalence were observed among these genotypes. The estimated
   risk of the three targeted alleles was also similar, suggesting that in
   this breed the VRQ allele was not at higher risk for scrapie, compared
   to the ARQ and AHQ alleles.},

Abstract = {An experiment was carried out using dairy ewes to study the transfer of
   aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) from feed to milk and from milk to cheese. The
   effects of AFB1 on liver function and hematological parameters were also
   investigated. Fifteen ewes were assigned to treatments in replicated 3 x
   3 Latin squares. The experimental groups received 32, 64, or 128 mu g/d
   of pure AFB1 for 7 d followed by 5 d of clearance. On the sixth day of
   the first period, the total daily milk produced by each ewe was
   collected separately and processed into cheese. The results indicate
   that the level of AFB1 used did not adversely affect animal health and
   milk production traits. The aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) concentrations in milk
   approached a steady-state condition in all treated groups between 2 and
   7 d after the start of treatment. The mean AFM1 concentrations of
   treated groups in steady-state condition (184.4, 324.7, and 596.9 ng/kg
   in ewes fed 32, 64, or 128 mu g of AFB1, respectively) were
   significantly affected by the AFB1 doses. The AFM1 concentration was
   linearly related to the AFB1 intake/ kg of BW. The carry-over values of
   AFB1 from feed into AFM1 in milk (0.26 to 0.33\%) were not influenced by
   the AFB1 doses. The AFM1 concentrations in curd and whey were linearly
   related to the AFM1 concentrations in the unprocessed milk.},

Abstract = {Several circulating Bacillus anthracis strains isolated in Italy and
   belonging to the A1.a cluster, genotype 3 (A1.a-3) are genotypically
   indistinguishable from Carbosap, a live attenuated vaccine strain,
   containing both pXO1 and pXO2 plasmids. The genotype was assessed by
   using eight-locus multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis. We
   describe here the use of a ninth locus able to explore variability among
   strains that have the same genotype. It is important to be able to
   genotype the wild isolate of B. anthracis strains from outbreaks of
   anthrax in areas where Carbosap vaccination of cattle and sheep is
   common practice. A total of 27 representative field strains isolated in
   Italy and four vaccinal strains, namely, Carbosap, Sterne, Pasteur 1,
   and Pasteur 11, were characterized by a ninth marker, called pXO2-A.
   Twenty-three field strains were genotype 3 and therefore identical to
   Carbosap. The marker was in the pXO2 plasmid and is based on the
   polymorphism of the already-known VX2-3 locus. Detection was obtained by
   PCR with fluorescence-labeled forward primers in order to produce
   appropriate fragments for capillary electrophoresis with an ABI 310
   genetic analyzer. Genetic relationships showed heterogeneity in all of
   the examined samples. Interestingly, with respect to genotype 3, samples
   grouped into eight different subtypes, A to H, and the subtype G, had
   only two samples indistinguishable from Carbosap. The results of the
   present study confirm the validity of a hierarchical progressive
   protocol for discrimination among closely related isolates.},

Abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes strains, isolated from various sources (food,
   environment, and animals), were used to test different PCR-based methods
   to investigate their capability to define the strain origin. RA-PD-PCR
   with three primers and the SAU-PCR method, in which the DNA was first
   digested with the Sau3A restriction endonuclease and then amplified with
   a primer designed on the restriction site, were carried out, and the
   profiles obtained were used to perform cluster analysis. Based on the
   cluster analysis of Listeria spp. strains, obtained from international
   collections, the coefficient of similarity was selected. The results
   obtained showed that the methods tested in the study gave different
   levels of differentiation between the strains tested. The RAPD protocol
   using the P1254 primer and the SAU-PCR gave appreciable results only for
   strains isolated from animals and from a food processing plant in two
   different periods of the year 2003. Better differentiation was observed
   using the RAPD-PCR with primer D8635. As a matter of fact, it was able
   to distinguish L. monocytogenes obtained from different species of
   animals, different food samples and strains from the same production
   plant isolated in different periods of the year. Also primer M 13 gave
   positive results, but the coefficient of similarity to use had to be
   increased to 80\%. On the basis of the results observed, RAPD-PCR with
   primers D863 5 and M 13 should be considered reliable tools for
   epidemiological investigations focusing on L. monocytogenes. (c) 2005

Abstract = {A mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) strain was isolated from a pup with
   fatal diarrhea, which had a concurrent infection by canine parvovirus
   type 2. The reovirus isolate showed an atypical hemagglutination pattern
   and a retarded electrophoretic mobility of the S1 segment, which is
   characteristic of MRV type 3 (MRV-3). Assignment of the isolated virus
   to MRV-3 was confirmed by type-specific RT-PCR assays, targeting the S1
   gene, and by subsequent sequence analysis of the PCR product. By
   phylogeny based on the S1 gene of several MRVs, the isolate fell into
   lineage E, along with the murine strain T3C9/61 and the bovine strains
   T3C18/61 and T3C31/59. Conversely, L1 sequences were found to segregate
   regardless of the viral type. A total of 110 fecal samples, 56 nasal and
   31 ocular swabs from dogs with diarrhea or nasal/ocular discharge were
   tested by a nested-PCR assay specific for reoviruses, and no sample was
   found to contain MRV RNA, a finding that is apparently in contrast with
   the seroprevalence (25.77\%) observed in dogs. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

   malate and a-ketoglutarate (1 mM). All strains oxidised organic acid
   L-lactate, 2-oxobutyrate and pyruvate and demonstrated the ability to
   oxidise alcohols, particularly isopropanol, which was oxidised at a high
   rate and high affinity (0.5 mol/mol isopropanol). Its oxidation was
   consistent with acetone formation, which may be of important in relation
   to pathogenicity. All strains oxidised similar substrates, however
   differences were observed between strains in terms of the relative rates

Abstract = {Isolates of the rumen fluke Calicophoron daubneyi (Digenea:
   Paramphistomidae) from various hosts and three locations in southern
   Italy were characterized genetically. The second internal transcribed
   spacer (ITS-2) of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) plus flanking 5.8S and 28S
   sequence (ITS-2+) was amplified from individual rumen flukes by PCR.
   PCR-linked restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis
   was performed using four different restriction endonucleases, and PCR
   products were sequenced. The PCR analyses from all the C daubneyi
   specimens produced identical fragments, and the PCR-RFLP analyses did
   not show, with respect to any of the four restriction endonucleases, any
   differences between the C. daubneyi specimens. The sequence analyses of
   the ITS-2+ from each of the C daubneyi specimens showed them all to be
   428 bp, and composed of the entire ITS-2 sequence (282 bp) plus the two
   partial flanking conserved sequences, 5.8S (99 bp) and 28S (47 bp). No
   intra-specific variation was observed in the nucleotide composition of
   the 1TS-2+ (homology = 100\%). There was, however, an observable
   interspecific variation between the ITS-2+ of C daubneyi and the ITS-2+
   of both Calicophoron calicophorum (homology = 97.2\%) and Calicophoron
   microbothrioides (homology = 97.4\%), both previously deposited in the
   GenBank (TM). The finding of the present study shows that, as has
   already demonstrated for other parasitic helminths, ITS-2 can serve as
   an effective genetic marker for the molecular identification of
   pararaphistornes, and as a useful tool for developing molecular
   epidemiological techniques for the study of C daubneyi transmission
   patterns and prevalence in definitive and intermediate hosts. (c) 2005

Abstract = {The present survey collected and analyzed the results of routine testing
   for Salmonella enterica and Listeria monocytogenes on foods of animal
   origin submitted for official controls in Italy during 2001 to 2002.
   Salmonella was detected in 2.2\% of 71,643 food samples examined, and
   the isolation rates ranged from 9.9\% for raw poultry meat to less than
   0.1\% for dairy products. Isolation rates were also high in raw pork
   (4.9\%) and processed meats (5.3\%), which often involved pork. Low
   rates were observed in seafood (0.5\%) and in ready-to-eat foods, such
   as grocery products (0.7\%) and ice creams (0.1\%). Serotyping showed
   that approximately 50\% of the isolates belonged to the serotypes most
   commonly isolated from humans in Italy, thus confirming that most cases
   of human salmonellosis have a foodborne origin. Levels of L.
   monocytogenes were higher than what is accepted by the current
   regulation in 2.4\% of 42,300 food samples. The positivity rates ranged
   from 10.3\% in raw pork to none in eggs and egg products. Contamination
   rates were higher in other meat products (between 2 and 5\%) and fish
   (6.5\%) than in cheeses (1.1\%) and other dairy products (0.6\%).
   Routine control activities on the microbial contamination of foods can
   generate data with statistical and epidemiological value. Such data can
   be used as a basis for estimating the exposure of consumers to foodborne
   pathogens, following the trends of contamination over time, and
   evaluating the effects of control measures on the contamination of food.},

Abstract = {Effective implementation and enforcement of legislation is essential to
   ensure animal welfare, In the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)
   European Region the well-established body of national and European Union
   laws in existence is growing continuously. The growth is due to various
   factors, such as new technology in animal farming and experimentation,
   exploitation of wildlife, new understanding of animal needs, and
   increasing public awareness and concern. The latter, in particular,
   determines the need for new animal welfare legislation to regulate and
   discipline the `use' of animals for different purposes, such as food
   production, companionship, work and leisure.
   This paper intends to provide an overview of the more relevant
   activities carried out by the Council of Europe and the European Union
   in the field of animal welfare. The authors identify eLearning as a tool
   to harmonise the interpretation and the implementation of animal welfare

   Centre, besides its institutional tasks as one of the laboratories of
   the Italian National Health System, collects and analyses data and
   results of the national official control of GMOs; carries out scientific
   research aimed at developing, improving, validating and harmonising
   detection and quantification methods, in cooperation with other
   scientific institutions, the Community Reference Laboratory and within
   the European Network of GMOs laboratories (ENGL); collaborates with the
   Ministry of Health in the definition of control programmes and promotes

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) strategy with respect to sheep and goat
   brucellosis aims to eradicate the infection and achieve officially
   brucellosis-free (OBF) status in all EU holdings and territories.
   Council Directive 91/68/EEC of 28 January 1991 states that to maintain
   OBF status of ovine or caprine holdings located outside an OBF
   territory, only a representative number of animals need to be tested
   annually. However, depending on the number of animals in a holding, this
   testing method risks non-detection of the infection, thereby reducing
   the efficacy of the brucellosis control plan. The recommended sampling
   procedure has a low sensitivity for detecting infection in medium-sized
   flocks; furthermore, the risk of not detecting re-infection in OBF
   flocks, particularly in territories that have not yet gained OBF status,
   is also not acceptable. Moreover, in large-sized flocks, the Directive
   sampling procedure entails taking an excessive number of samples, which
   can be very expensive. The authors evaluated, by using statistical
   analyses and a simulation model based on field data, the possible
   consequences of the current EU strategy. It is suggested that the
   sampling criteria for the maintenance of OBF status in the EU should be
   modified and that a statistically based sampling method should be
   applied instead of the fixed percentage method that is currently in use.},

Abstract = {Consequent upon the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) crisis, the
   European Union (EU) Commission enacted various decisions, which demanded
   that all bovine animals over 30 months of age should be examined by one
   of the approved rapid tests when slaughtered for human consumption. All
   cattle over 24 months of age subject to `special emergency slaughtering'
   or died on the farm or in transit or suspect of BSE infection should
   also be examined by one of the approved rapid tests. According to a
   specific commission decision, Sweden and Finland were to test only a
   sample of bovine animals over 30 months of age subject to normal
   slaughter. Testing commenced on 1 January 2001. The authors evaluate the
   results of more than 5 million tests performed in the second semester
   2001 from across the EU. The prevalence of BSE in the risk categories
   considered (emergency slaughter, fallen stock and healthy slaughtered),
   and the probability distribution of true-positive, false-positive and
   false-negative results are estimated by second-order Bayesian analysis.
   The results of the validation of tests performed in the EU are also
   considered by estimation of the probability distribution of their
   sensitivity and specificity. The prevalence of infection estimated in
   the cattle population of each EU country is compared against the
   criteria given in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code and is also
   used to evaluate the consistency of the results of EU Geographical BSE
   Risk with the actual infection levels in the countries. Finally, the
   capability of the two current approaches to BSE surveillance (i.e. the
   testing of all slaughtered and dead cattle as applied in the EU and a
   surveillance system targeted at animals in risk categories only) to
   detect the infection in a given population are discussed.},

Abstract = {Bone-marrow samples were collected from 48 CAEV-seropositive,
   symptomless goats (30 kids, IS adults). The samples were formalin-fixed
   and processed for histological examination. In addition, all samples
   were examined immunohistochemically with a monoclonal antibody (1A7)
   against the p27 capsid protein of maedi-visna virus, an antibody which
   cross-reacts with the Ca-p27 of CAEV. Samples from 16 goats (10/30 kids,
   6/18 adults) showed positive immunolabelling of bone-marrow stromal
   cells (fibrocytes, endothelial cells and adipocytes) and of scattered
   macrophages, whereas haematopoietic cells were negative. The detection
   of viral Ca-p27 protein in bone-marrow fibrocytes was consistent with
   previous in-vitro studies which indicated that such cells are
   semi-permissive for CAEV infection. It is speculated that bone-marrow
   stromal cells represent a viral reservoir in symptomless animals. (c)

Abstract = {In this trial we assessed the effect of soluble alginates on murine
   cells. Mouse peritoneal monocytes were stimulated in vitro with a
   solution of alginate. The production of TNF-alpha and nitric oxide (NO),
   the expression of surface molecules CD80 and CD86, and the ability of
   monocytes to phagocyte bacteria were assessed, in order to evaluate the
   effect of alginate on cell functionality. We showed that mouse
   peritoneal monocytes stimulated with alginate produce NO and TNF-alpha.
   In addition, alginate is able also to increase their phagocytic activity
   and to a lesser extent also to increase the expression of CD80. Even
   with different degrees, it implies that alginates per se act directly on
   immune response, being able to effectively stimulate proinflammatory
   activity. These findings corroborate the idea that alginates can
   represent interesting adjuvants to use to increase the efficacy of
   antigenic stimulation.},

Volume = {157},

Month = {JUL 30},
Abstract = {Between July and September 2002 there were outbreaks of bluetongue on
   three sheep holdings in the communities of San Gregorio Magno (Salerno,
   Campania), Laviano (Salerno, Campania) and Carpino (Foggia, Puglia), and
   the involvement of bluetongue virus (BTV) was confirmed serologically
   and virologically. The mortality rate was at least 11 per cent and
   involved BTV serotype 2 (BTV-2) and serotype 9 (BTV-9). These holdings
   were also surveyed for the Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae)
   vectors; approximately 10,000 midges belonging to 15 species were
   captured, but they did not include a single specimen of the classical
   Afro-Asiatic bluetongue vector, Culicoides imicola. Species belonging to
   the obsoletus complex dominated the light-trap collections, and
   Culicoides obsoletus Meigen, Culicoides scoticus Downes and Kettle and
   Culicoides dewulfi Goetghebuer constituted 90 per cent of all the
   Culicoides species captured. Fifty-six pools of the Obsoletus complex
   (excluding C dewuffi), each containing 100 individual midges and
   containing only parous and gravid females, were assayed for virus. BTV-2
   was isolated from three pools from San Gregorio Magno and Carpino, and
   BTV-9 was isolated from one pool from Laviano. These results indicate
   that a species other than C imicola is involved in the current
   re-emergence of bluetongue in the Mediterranean Basin, but whether it is
   C obsoletus sensu stricto or C scoticus, or both, is uncertain.},

Abstract = {Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) is the causative agent of ovine
   pulmonary adenocarcinoma (OPA). In this study, we followed over a
   31-month period the natural transmission of JSRV in adult sheep and in
   their offspring. We established groups derived from flocks with either a
   high or low incidence of OPA and monitored virus transmission, clinical
   disease and macroscopic/microscopic lung lesions at necropsy. Results
   obtained show that (i) JSRV infection can occur perinatally or in the
   first few months of life in lambs and in adult sheep; (ii) only a
   minority of JSRV-infected animals develop clinical disease during their
   commercial lifespan; and (iii) JSRV is more readily detectable in
   peripheral blood leucocytes and lymphoid organs than in the lungs. These
   data support a model of opportunistic JSRV infection and tumorigenic
   conversion of type II pneumocytes/Clara cells in the lungs, while
   lymphoreticular cells serve as the principal virus reservoir. (C) 2005

   (Abruzzo region) and genetically characterize the oocysts isolated from
   the clams. From March to July 2003, 960 specimens of clams (Chainelea
   gallina) present in nature were collected at 500 m from the Tordino,
   Tronto, Vibrata and Vomano river mouths on the Adriatic sea. The
   haemolymph and tissues were extracted from the specimens (240 per river
   mouth) after the specimens had been identified, measured and weighed
   (live weight). Immunofluorescence tests (IFA) were performed on pools (n
   = 32) of samples and oocysts of Cryptosporidium spp. were detected in 23
   pools of C. gallina. To identify the Cryptosporidium, species, all the
   pools IFA-positive were tested by a PCR assay specific for the
   Cryptosporidium outer wall protein (COWP) gene. Positive amplicons then
   were sequenced and analysed. Two pools of clams were positive for
   Coptosporidium parvum Genotype 2 (the ``bovine{''} i.e. zoonotic
   genotype). This is the first time that C. parvum was found in clams from
   the Adriatic sea in Italy and the case might be of public health
   importance. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) continues to be an important pathogen of
   poultry, causing significant production losses in many parts of the
   world. Eradication is the preferred method of control but it could
   result impractical after the organism has been introduced in an area
   with high density of poultry farms. TS-11 (R), a temperature-sensitive
   live attenuated MG vaccine, is currently utilized in several countries
   for the control of MG infections in commercial layers and broiler
   breeders. In the present field trial, conducted in an industrial
   meat-turkey farm (belonging to an integrated company), previously
   affected by severe MG infections, the ability of TS-11 (R) in
   effectively colonizing the upper respiratory tract in a turkey flock was
   evaluated ({''}TS-11 (R){''} flock). A second flock grown in an adjacent
   pen of the same farm was vaccinated with an inactivated MG vaccine
   (''Inactivated{''} flock). Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Random
   Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis were applied for the detection
   and differentiation of TS-11 (R) from other MG strains possibly present
   in the same flocks, such as the field strains and the 6/85 live vaccine
   strain currently utilized in commercial layers in Italy. PCR-RAPD
   results achieved in the ``TS-11 (R){''} flock were compared with those
   of a flock of turkey grown in the same farm but vaccinated with an
   inactivated MG vaccine. Encouraging results were achieved by means of
   PCR-RAPD detection of TS-11 (R) from all of the samples up to eight
   weeks post vaccination, whereas it was never detected in the
   ``Inactivated{''} flock. Moreover, the field strain was never detected
   in the ``TS-11 (R){''} flock but in the ``Inactivated{''} one it was
   detected either 5 and 8 weeks after the vaccination. The aggregate
   production data of the two flocks resulted significantly improved when
   compared to the performance of the previous flocks grown in the same
   farm and similar to the production standard of the integrated company.},

Abstract = {The inducible gene vgf and its peptide products are relevant to the
   neuroendocrine regulation of homeostasis and reproduction in rodents. We
   show here that in the anterior pituitary of female sheep the
   somatotrope, gonadotrope, and lactotrope/thyrotrope cell populations
   each expressed vgf nRNA, but displayed a distinct profile of VGF
   immunoreactive peptides. ProVGF C-terminus and VGF(443-588)
   immunoreactivities were found in lactotropes and thyrotropes, often in a
   subcellular location restricted to the Golgi area and suggestive of
   rapid peptide (or proVGF) release upon biosyntliesis, while high
   molecular weight bands consistent with proVGF were shown in pituitary
   extracts. Distinct seasonal changes were revealed, proVGF C-terminus
   immunoreactive cells being largely identified as lactotropes during the
   summer (83(.)7 +/- 2(.)1\% (mean +/- S.E.M.) versus 27(.)0 +/- 1(.)9\%
   during the winter), as opposed to thyrotropes during the winter (73(.)0
   +/- 1(.)9\% versus 16(.)3 +/- 2(.)1\% during the summer). Conversely,
   antisera to peptides adjacent to the VGF(553-555) `Arg-Pro-Arg' cleavage
   site, and to the N-terminus of the proVGF-derived peptide V, selectively
   labeled gonadotropes, indicating processing to small peptides not
   retaining the proVGF C-terminus in such cells. Finally, a peptide
   related to the VGF(4-240) region was immunostained in somatotropes,
   shown in a Western blot as a band of relative molecular mass of
   approximately 16 000. In conclusion, a complex, endocrine
   cell-type-specific processing of proVGF was revealed. Further to the
   known inducibility of vgf mRNA upon a range of stimuli, discreet,
   selective modulations of VGF-peptide profile/s are suggested, possibly
   involved in specific neuro/endocrine or modulatory mechanisms.},

Abstract = {Following the avian influenza (AI) epidemics which occurred in Italy
   between 1997 and 2003, a surveillance program, funded by the Italian
   Ministry of Health was implemented. Among the tasks of this surveillance
   program was an investigation on wild and domestic birds to asses
   circulation of avian influenza viruses in their natural reservoirs. In
   this study we collected samples from migratory wild birds (Anseriformes
   and Charadriiformes), from national and importated game fowls, and from
   7 backyard farms of geese and ducks. Cloacal swabs were screened by
   means of real-time RT-PCR (RRT-PCR) and/or directly processed for
   attempted virus isolation in embryonated fowl's SPF eggs and blood
   samples for presence of antibodies against avian influenza viruses.
   Avian influenza viruses were only obtained from migratory waterfowls
   belonging to the family Anseriformes, and not from domestic waterfowls
   or game birds. This study confirms that the risk of introduction of
   novel influenza viruses in densely populated areas of poultry farms in
   Veneto is linked to migratory wild birds and in particular from birds
   belonging to the family Anseriformes.},

Abstract = {In the literature, the reports on the effects of a genetically modified
   (GM) diet are scanty and heterogeneous; in particular, no direct
   evidence has so far been reported that GM food may affect human or
   animal health.
   Hepatocytes represent a suitable model for monitoring the effects of a
   GM diet, the liver potentially being a primary target. In a previous
   study, we demonstrated that some modifications occur in hepatocyte
   nuclei of mice fed on GM soybean. In order to elucidate whether such
   modifications can be reversed, in the present study, 3 months old mice
   fed on GM soybean since their weaning were submitted to a diet
   containing wild type soybean, for one month. In parallel, to investigate
   the influence of GM soybean on adult individuals, mice fed on wild type
   soybean were changed to a GM diet, for the same time. Using
   immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrated that a one-month diet
   reversion can influence some nuclear features in adult mice, restoring
   typical characteristics of controls in GM-fed animals, and inducing in
   control mice modifications similar to those observed in animals fed on
   GM soybean from weaning. This suggests that the modifications related to
   GM soybean are potentially reversible, but also that some modifications
   are inducible in adult organisms in a short time.},

Abstract = {The ability of the influenza Orthomixovirus to undergo to continually
   antigenically changes that can affect its pathogenicity and its
   diffusion, explains the growing seriousness of this disease and the
   recent epizoozies in various parts of the world. There have been 15 HA
   and 9 NA type A sub-types of the influenza virus identified all of which
   are present in birds. Until now the very virulent avian influenza
   viruses identified were all included to the H5 and H7 sub-types. We here
   show that is possible to identify the H5 and H7 sub-types with reverse
   transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) by using a set of
   specific primers for each HA sub-type. The RT-PCR is a quick and
   sensitive method of identifying the HA sub-types of the influenza virus
   directly from homogenised organs.},

Abstract = {This report describes an experimental infection with porcine circovirus
   type 2 (PCV2) in combination with porcine parvovirus (PPV) in 3-week-old
   conventional colostrum-fed pigs with maternal antibodies to both
   viruses. Two groups of four pigs each were inoculated with PCV2 and PPV.
   One of the groups received also a commercial inactivated vaccine against
   porcine pleuropneumoma to evaluate possible effects of the stimulation
   of the immune system of pigs on the infection. Another group of four
   pigs was kept as uninfected control. Clinical signs, rectal temperatures
   and body weights were recorded. Serum antibody titers to PCV2 and PPV
   were determined at weekly intervals. Pigs were killed 42 days after
   inoculation and tissue samples were examined for the presence of gross
   and microscopic lesions. Tissues were also analyzed for the presence of
   PCV2 and PPV DNA by PCR, and for the presence of PCV2 antigen by
   immunohistochemistry (IHC). All the pigs had serum antibodies to PCV2
   and PPV at the beginning of the trial. None of them developed clinical
   symptoms or pathological lesions typical of post-weaning multisystemic
   wasting syndrome (PMWS), a disease associated to PCV2 infection.
   However, IHC and/or PCR analyses showed that clinically silent PCV2
   infection developed in five of the eight inoculated pigs, regardless of
   the administration of the vaccine. In particular, PCV2 DNA and/or
   antigen were detected in most of the tissues examined in the two pigs
   with the lowest titer of maternal PCV2 antibodies at the beginning of
   the trial. PPV DNA was not detected in any of the samples examined. The
   five pigs with PCR and/or IHC evidence of PCV2 infection had a mean
   weight gain during the experiment lower than that of the inoculated
   PCR-negative pigs considered together and that of the control pigs. In
   conclusion, it would appear that passive immunity against PCV2 can play
   a role in preventing the development of PMWS, but is not able to prevent
   the establishing of clinically silent PCV2 infections. The dissemination
   and persistence of the virus in the tissues may depend on the level of
   PCV2 antibodies at the time of inoculation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Preventing tick bites is a fundamental step towards reducing the impact
   of tick-borne protozoal, bacterial and viral diseases (TBDs) in humans
   and animals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a
   combination of imidacloprid 10\%/permethrin 50\% and of fipronil
   10\%/S-methoprene 12\% against ticks in naturally infected dogs and to
   assess methodological parameters to calculate drug efficacy on tick
   immature stages.
   From July to August 2004, 45 privately owned dogs of various sexes,
   ages, breeds, coat length and habits were enrolled in a trial carried
   out in an area (radius approximately 50 km) in Southern Italy. Three
   homogeneous groups (both for dog population and tick population) were
   formed: 15 dogs treated with imidacloprid 10\% and permethrin 50\%
   spot-on (group A), 15 dogs treated with fipronil 10\% and methoprene
   12\% spot-on (group B) and 15 untreated dogs (group C). The dogs in each
   group were then sub-grouped according to their age and weight. Two
   different treatments were administered (time 0 and +28 days) to groups A
   and B, and the dogs were checked weekly for tick infestation until day
   +56 post-treatment (p.t.). Twenty-four areas distributed on the whole
   body surface were examined for ticks at each follow-up, while only at
   time 0 and at day +56 p.t., ticks were collected from the dogs and
   identified.
   For the immature stages a semi-quantitative method was adopted and the
   load of immature stages was evaluated and grouped into four classes up
   to day +56 p.t. when the mean number of immature ticks (MIT) for each
   infection class was evaluated.
   All the adult ticks collected were identified as brown dog ticks
   (Rhipicephalus sanguineus). Immature stages were first compared at day
   +28 p.t.. The efficacy of both products used in groups A and B on adult
   ticks was high and generally very similar. Conversely, the efficacy of
   imidacloprid 10\% and permethrin 50\% against immatures was higher than
   that of fipronil 10\% and methoprene 12\% throughout the observation
   period with statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) at day +28
   p.t. (i.e. group A = 98.52\%, group B = 72.40\%). imidacloprid 10\% and
   permethrin 50\% was more effective than fipronil 10\% and methoprene
   12\%, with the differences being statistically significant at day +28
   p.t. (group A = 98.43\%, group B = 77.56\%). (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {A rapid and very effective analytical procedure for the simultaneous
   HPLC determination of two anthelmintics, Flubendazole (FLUB) and
   Febantel (FEBA), in swine and poultry feeds was developed and tested.
   The ground feed samples were extracted using dimethyl form ami de. The
   extracts were directly analyzed, without any purification, on a
   reversed-phase ODS column (150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 mu m) with
   acetonitrile-phosphate buffer (pH 3; 0.017 M) as mobile phase.
   Ultraviolet detection of FLUB and FEBA was carried out at 300 nm.
   The method was validated for specificity, linearity, accuracy,
   repeatability, limit of detection and limit of quantification. The
   limits of detection (LOD) of FLUB and FEBA in feeds, based on a detector
   signal-to-noise ratio of 3, were 3 mg kg(-1) and the lowest levels
   tested in feeds by this procedure (limit of quantification, LOQ) were 10
   mg kg(-1).
   The mean recovery of FLUB and FEBA from spiked samples, in a
   concentration range of 10-200 mg kg(-1), was 98\% with a CV\% of 4\% and
   99\% with a CV\% of 2\%, respectively. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Fish pasteurellosis is an infectious disease that affects several
   teleost species living in temperate marine waters. The pathogen
   responsible, Photobacterium damselae subspecies piscicida, shows high
   genetic similarity with P. damselae subsp. damselae, making subspecies
   discrimination extremely laborious. Here we report for the first time a
   PCR-RFLP method for the identification of P. damselae subsp. piscicida
   without prior isolation in pure culture. Genomic sequence information
   was obtained through cloning and sequencing of RAPD products. Two P.
   damselae-specific primer pairs were developed and tested on 17 strains
   of P. damselae subsp. piscicida, 10 strains of P. damselae subsp.
   damselae, and 6 closely related control species. High sensitivity was
   achieved in PCR amplification on serially diluted samples (< 180 fg of
   pure bacterial DNA or < 10 fg, depending on the amplified fragment).
   Restriction analysis of PCR products showed a unique digestion profile
   for all P. damselae subsp. piscicida strains. The same PCR-RFLP method
   was implemented on total DNA samples extracted from experimentally
   infected sea bream and sea bass. Positive results were obtained on fish
   with clear signs of the disease as well as on challenged, but
   asymptomatic, fish. The method presented here might provide a useful
   tool for both prevention and rapid diagnosis of fish pasteurellosis.},

Abstract = {Bovine hypodermosis is a myiasis caused by Hypoderma bovis and Hypoderma
   lineatum (Diptera, Oestridae) larvae, which has a severe economic impact
   on the livestock industry. Though myiasis is widespread throughout
   Italy, no nationwide eradication program has ever been planned, unlike
   in other European Countries. With a view to setting up a national
   control program, a pilot study was carried out in Southern Italy on 9939
   cattle bred in an area with a, high prevalence of cattle hypodermosis,
   using moxidectin 0.5\% pour-on (Cydectin((R)), Fort Dodge) and 1\%
   injectable (Cydectin((R)), Fort Dodge) formulations. At the recommended
   dosage, moxidectin displayed efficacy levels of 99.9\% in the pour-on
   and 100\% in the injectable formulation, whereas the microdose (1 mg per
   head regardless of body weight) was less effective (65.7\%). This trial
   contributed to a significant reduction in infestation rates in the study
   area and represented the first step through which a national program for
   eradicating warble fly infestation in Italy. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The effect of intramuscular injection of 40 mg/2 ml aluminium hydroxide
   in the neck of pigs was examined in a number of ways. The investigation
   followed repeated slaughterhouse reports, according to which 64.8\% of
   pigs from one particular farm were found at slaughter to have one or
   more nodules in the muscles of the neck (group slaughtered). The pigs
   had been injected with a vaccine containing 40 mg/2 ml dose of aluminium
   hydroxide as adjuvant. Research consisted of two phases: first, an
   epidemiological study was carried out, aimed at determining the risk
   factors for the granulomas. The results indicated that the vaccine was
   to be held responsible for the formation of granulomas. A clinical trial
   was then performed to further substantiate the initial hypothesis, by
   comparing pigs, which were aseptically inoculated twice with either the
   original vaccine or the adjuvant alone (groups vaccine and adjuvant) to
   pigs inoculated twice with apyrogenic bi-distilled water (group water)
   and to pigs inoculated once with the adjuvant and once with apyrogenic
   bi-distilled water (group adjuvant/water). Both studies agreed in their
   conclusions, which indicate that the high amount of aluminium hydroxide
   was the cause of the granulomas. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Cattle from Northern Portugal, many with pulmonary lesions typical of

   Mycoplasma mycoides subspecies mycoides small colony (MmmSC), which is

   ELISA that included a Culture enrichment stage, and 2 different PCR
   diagnostic systems were used to detect MmmSC in lung and mediastinal
   lymph node tissues from these animals. The comparison of typical CBPP
   pathology with the results of detection revealed that no single one of
   these methods provided a perfect match to the pathological data. Best
   performing tests were the PCR with laser induced fluorescence and PCR
   with pleuroTRAP kit (Chemicon, Australia), which are diagnostic systems
   based on amplification of genomic MmmSC DNA Followed by sensitive
   detection of the amplified products. These were followed by the
   broth-enriched sandwich ELISA, Which uses a monoclonal antibody specific
   to the M. mycoides cluster, to capture the antigen. (c) 2004 Elsevier

Abstract = {Currently, the genus Pestivirus comprises four approved species, namely
   bovine viral diarrhoea viruses 1 and 2 (BVDV-1, BVDV-2), classical swine
   fever virus and border disease virus (BDV). Recently, three major
   genotypes have been identified within the species BDV and termed as
   subgroups BDV-1, BDV-2 and BDV-3. Here, an isolate from animals in a
   herd showing BD-like syndromes, which occurred in central Italy was
   analysed. A reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was
   performed using primers that specifically amplify a fragment of the
   5'-non-coding region (5'-NCR) from BDV. Both the 5'-NCR fragment and the
   entire N-pro gene were sequenced and used for genetic typing. The 5'-NCR
   sequence revealed that the newly isolated Pestivirus could be allocated
   to the BDV species. Interestingly, the N-pro sequence of this virus
   isolate significantly differed from all the ovine pestiviruses
   previously described, providing evidence for the presence of an
   additional subgroup within the species BDV.},

Abstract = {The membrane-protein 81 gene (mb-mp81) of Mycoplasma bovis was cloned,
   sequenced and compared to membrane-protein 81 gene (ma-mp81) of
   Mycoplasma agalactine. After alignment of both sequences, specific
   primers pairs were designed from variable or unchanging nucleotide
   segments. In this study, we describe the development and optimization of
   a multiplex-PCR (MPCR) for the rapid detection of M. agalactiae and M.
   bovis strains. In addition, a simple and rapid PCR-restriction fragment
   length polymorphism (RFLP) assay, using the restriction enzymes AluI.
   DraI, RsaI and XbaI, is described to distinguish between both species.
   The results suggest that MPCR and PCR-RFLP assays could be used as an
   alternative method in routine diagnosis for rapid and specific
   simultaneous detection of M. agalactiae and M. bovis. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {The Apennine chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata) is a highly endangered
   mountain ungulate. About 800 individuals still survive in central
   Apennines, Italy. Current conservation projects involve genetic
   identification of single animals, paternity tests, and assessment of
   relatedness. A suite of 60 microsatellite primer pairs from domestic
   bovids and cervids revealed polymorphisms for 10 loci, providing
   evidence for a low level of genetic variability, which might be a
   consequence of severe population bottlenecks and prolonged permanence at
   low numbers.},

Abstract = {The occurrence of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) among domestic pigs
   and wild boar in several European countries is described and discussed.
   From 1990 to 2001 clinical outbreaks were analysed and serum samples,
   partly from existing screening programmes, were tested for antibodies
   against EMCV. Most clinical EMCV outbreaks were reported in Belgium
   (320), followed by Italy (110), Greece (15) and Cyprus (6). The
   outbreaks appeared to be clustered in,endemic areas' with an increase in
   outbreaks during the autumn and winter months. The within-herd
   seroprevalence measured in clinically affected pig farms varied
   considerably among farms (2.87\%), with age (0.84\%) and by country.
   Data from farms with no clinical disease showed that subclinical
   infection with EMCV was found both within (seroprevalence 6.62\%) and
   outside (up to 17\%) the endemic areas of the clinically affected
   countries as well as in the non-clinically affected countries Austria
   and France (3-5.4\%). Among wild boar, the seroprevalence varied between
   0.6 and 10.8\%, and a study in Belgium found a prevalence of virus
   infection of 3.3\%.},

Abstract = {Seawater fishes are affected by a pathology commonly called
   `myxobacteriosis', caused by Tenacibaculum maritimum (formerly
   Flexibacter maritimus). The disease is characterized by fin erosion and
   necrotic ulcers of skin and muscle, and by low but constant mortality in
   cultured marine fish; in Italy is one of the most important and widely
   spread diseases affecting sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax, gilthead
   seabream Sparus aurata, sharp-snouted bream Diplodus puntazzo, white
   bream Diplodus sargus, and six-tooted bream Dentex dentex. In order to
   obtain an effective vaccine against the disease, formalin killed cells
   (FKC), extracellular products (ECPs) and crude lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
   preparations were obtained from the T maritimum strain SPVId and
   injected intraperitoneally twice into the sea bass. The fish immune
   response to the preparations was studied: agglutinating antibody titer
   and in vitro phagocytosis were determined after the first and second
   injection in order to evaluate whether the preparations are immunogenic
   or not and if the booster effect took place. The results show that FKC
   and LPS preparations increased the antibody titer after the first
   injection when compared to the control sea bass. Moreover, all the
   preparations stimulated a secondary (booster) response. In vitro
   phagocytosis of the total blood was significantly higher for all the
   preparations when compared to the controls, but the crude LPS immunized
   sea bass showed the highest activity.},

Abstract = {Several seroconversions occurring in 2002 among sentinel cattle during
   the bluetongue-vaccination campaign in Lazio and Tuscany (central Italy)
   led to the suspicion of vaccine-virus circulation. Therefore in 2003, 17
   seroconverting sentinel herds were investigated for the characteristics
   of the virus involved. From these farms, 91 unvaccinated animals and 57
   Culicoides pools were tested for the presence of the bluetongue vaccine
   virus (serotype-2) or other strains. The presence of vaccine virus
   serotype-2 was confirmed by PCR followed by restriction analysis in the
   whole blood of 17 unvaccinated sentinel cattle and 12 pools of
   Culicoides imicola or C. obsoletus. Of the 17 herds, five were positive
   only for vaccine virus serotype-2, four were positive for other strains
   and two for both the vaccine and other strains; the remaining premises
   were virologicaly negative. The vaccine virus serotype-2 also was
   detected in areas not included in the vaccination campaign. (c) 2004

Abstract = {A fast and ultrasensitive chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay for
   aflatoxin M, in milk samples has been developed and validated. The
   method is an indirect competitive type format involving the
   immobilization of an aflatoxin M-1-bovine serum albumin conjugate on 384
   well black polystyrene microliter plates and the use of a secondary
   antibody labeled with horseradish peroxidase detected with a
   luminol-based substrate. Aflatoxin M, standard solutions were prepared
   in milk-based buffer, and milk samples were analyzed without any cleanup
   procedure. The limit of quantification was 1 ppt, the coefficient of
   variation was below 9\% for both intra- and interassay precision, and
   the recovery ranged from 96 to 122\%. The method is specific, and other
   aflatoxins do not significantly cross-react with the antibody.
   Twenty-four milk samples were analyzed, and a good correlation was
   observed (y = 0.98x + 1.71, r(2) = 0.98, n = 24) when the data were
   compared with a reference high-performance liquid chromatography method
   with a fluorescent detector. The developed method is suitable for an
   accurate, sensitive, and high-throughput screening of aflatoxin M, in
   milk samples with a reduction of costs and increased detectability, as
   compared with previously developed immunoassays.},

   transport between laboratories. In recent years, to simplify
   identification and enumeration, the use of DNA or RNA probes coupled
   with the PCR assay has progressed and now represents a routine procedure
   for screening cultured and field samples. However, the phytoplankton
   cells have often still to be treated as fixed samples.
   The extraction of genomic DNA from fixed cultures of Alexandrium minutum
   cultures was compared using two new methods based on Magnetisable Solid
   Phase Support (MSPS) techniques with that using three commercial kits.
   Genomic DNA recovery and PCR amplification were observed and the results
   obtained from culture samples were validated using field samples. Among
   the DNA extraction techniques considered, the MSPS methods provided the
   best results.},

Title = {Development of recombinant chimeric antigen expressing immunodominant B
   Epitopes of Leishmania infantum for serodiagnosis of visceral

Abstract = {Wild canids and domestic dogs are the main reservoir of zoonotic
   visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by Leishmania infantum (syn.:
   Leishmania chagasi). Serological diagnosis of VL is therefore important
   in both human and dog leishmaniasis from a clinical and epidemiological
   point of view. Routine diagnosis of VL is traditionally carried out by
   immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT), which is laborious and difficult
   to standardize and to interpret. In the last decade, however, several
   specific antigens of Leishmania infantum have been characterized,
   allowing the development of a recombinant-based immunoassay. Among them,
   the whole open reading frame encoding K9 antigen, the gene fragment
   encoding the repetitive sequence of K26, and the 3'-terminal gene
   fragment of the kinesin-related protein (K39sub) were previously
   evaluated as diagnostic markers for canine leishmaniasis and proved to
   be independent in their antibody reactivity. Since sensitivity of
   serological test is usually higher in multiple-epitope format, in this
   study the relevant epitopes of K9, K26, and K39 antigens were joined by
   PCR strategy to produce the chimeric recombinant protein. The resulting
   mosaic antigen was found highly expressed in Escherichia coli and
   efficiently purified by affinity chromatography. Antigenic properties of
   this recombinant antigen were evaluated by indirect enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a panel of human and dog sera
   previously characterized by parasitological and/or serological
   techniques. Chimeric ELISA showed 99\% specificity in both human (n =
   180) and canine (n = 343) control groups, while sensitivity was higher
   in canine VL (96\%, n = 213) than in human VL (82\%, n = 185).
   Accordingly, concordance between IFAT and canine chimeric ELISA (k =
   0.95, 95\% confidence interval = 0.93 to 0.98) was higher than between
   IFAT and human chimeric ELISA (k = 0.81, 95\% confidence interval = 0.76
   to 0.87). Results suggest the potential use of this new antigen for
   routine serodiagnosis of VL in both human and canine hosts.},

Abstract = {The aim was to determine the factors that contribute to embryonic
   mortality in buffaloes mated by AI during a period of increasing day
   length which corresponds to a natural decline in reproductive activity.
   Italian Mediterranean buffalo cows (n = 243) showing regular estrous
   cycles were synchronized using the Ovsynch-TAI program and mated by AI
   at 16 and 40 h after the second injection of GnRH. Blood samples were
   collected on Days 10 and 20 after the first AI and assayed for
   progesterone (P-4). Pregnancy diagnosis was undertaken on Days 26 and 40
   after the first AI using rectal ultrasonography. Buffaloes with a
   conceptus on Day 26 but not on Day 40 were judged to have undergone
   embryonic mortality and for these animals uterine fluid was recovered by
   flushing and analysed for common infectious agents. Estrus
   synchronization was achieved in 86\% of buffaloes and the pregnancy rate
   on Day 40 was 34\%. Embryonic mortality between Days 26 and 40 occurred
   in 45\% of buffaloes and was associated with the presence of significant
   infectious agents in only 10 buffaloes (8\%). Concentrations of P-4 on
   Day 10 after AI were higher (P < 0.05) in buffaloes that established a
   pregnancy than in buffaloes that showed embryonic mortality that was not
   associated with infectious agents. Similarly, on Day 20 after AI P-4
   concentrations were higher (P < 0.01) in pregnant buffaloes compared
   with non-pregnant buffaloes and buffaloes that had embryonic mortality.
   It is concluded that a reduced capacity for P-4 secretion can explain
   around 50\% of embryonic mortalities in buffaloes synchronised and mated
   by AI during a period of low reproductive activity and that other as yet
   unidentified factors also have a significant effect on embryonic
   survival. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Poplar prosaic virus (PopMV) is widespread in all countries where poplar
   is grown, and causes severe economic losses in terms of quantity and
   quality of wood production. Control is based on indexing, aimed at the
   production of healthy propagation material. The currently used
   diagnostic method is double antibody sandwich (DAS) ELISA with
   polyclonal antibodies, which is relatively simple and inexpensive and
   more reliable than visual inspection of symptoms in the nurseries.
   However, this method also has disadvantages, mainly low sensitivity in
   relation to low concentration and irregular distribution of the virus in
   the plant. In this study, a new diagnostic method for PopMV based on
   production and use of a monoclonal antibody (Mab) in a triple antibody
   sandwich (TAS) ELISA, is presented. The TAS-ELISA with monoclonal
   antibodies was optimised by testing a range of reagent combinations and
   concentrations. PopMV was detected by the optimised TAS-ELISA with
   sensitivity more than 100 times higher than by DAS-ELISA with polyclonal
   antibodies. Six PopMV isolates from four European countries were
   detected with the same efficiency, indicating that no limitations to the
   practical use of the TAS-ELISA arise due to excessive
   epitope-specificity of the monoclonal antibody employed. (c) 2005

Volume = {58},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This study was carried out in order to determine the effects, after
   feeding propylene glycol to Valle del Belice ewes 30 days prepartum and
   30 days postpartum, on metabolic profiles, body-condition score, milk
   yield, milk composition, milk clotting ability and the performance of
   suckling lambs. Ewes were blocked by parity, body-condition score and
   previous milk production, and assigned randomly to either a control diet
   or a diet containing propylene glycol fed at the rate of 80 g/ewe/day
   (low PG) or 160 g/ewe/day (high PG).
   Feeding propylene glycol prepartum decreased the concentration of BHBA
   and NEFA and increased the concentration of glucose in the ewes' plasma.
   Milk yield from ewes fed the diet containing the higher and lower levels
   of propylene glycol, was 25 and 16\% greater respectively than milk
   yield from ewes fed the control diet (P < 0.01). Feeding propylene
   glycol increased the milk fat and milk protein yield, and the milk
   cheese-making capacity compared with the control.
   Lambs of ewes fed the low and high propylene glycol diets, weighed 580
   and 370 g more, respectively, at birth, than lambs of ewes fed the
   control diet (P < 0.01). Lambs of ewes fed the high propylene glycol
   diet gained 26 g/day more and weighed 1.15 kg more at 30 days compared
   to the lambs of ewes fed the control diet.
   In conclusion, feeding propylene glycol to ewes from 30 days prepartum
   up to 30 days postpartum decreased BHBA and NEFA concentrations in
   plasma, increased glucose concentration in plasma and milk yield, and
   improved the growth of nursing lambs. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   main aim of controlling the possible circulation of low-virulence
   classical swine fever viral strains. The repetition of a serological
   monitoring programme over several years, with constantly negative
   results, can prove the absence of the infection while increasing the
   degree of confidence. In our case, in 2003, after eight repetitions of
   the surveillance plan, the probability that there was at least one
   infected farm reached 0.006\%. Therefore, on the basis of the results of
   the sampling carried out from 1995 to 2003, we may state that there is
   no endemic infection, even because of a low virulence virus, in

   lactating ewes from 17 flocks collected from 1994 through 2003. The
   traits investigated were daily milk yield, fat and protein percentage,
   and daily yield of fat-plus-protein. The pedigree file consisted of 5306
   animals; in addition to the 4428 animals with records, 188 male and 690
   female ancestors were included. Heat stress was modeled by using data
   from a weather station. Apart from the effects of the weather conditions
   of the milk recording test-day, the effects of the preceding 1, 2, and 3
   d were determined. Because longer periods of heat stress might have a
   more severe effect than shorter periods, 2-, 3-, and 4-d periods were
   also considered, by averaging the weather data measurements. Fixed
   regression analyses were based on models that included effects of flock
   nested within year of test-day, DIM (days in milk) class x parity class,
   and several types of weather indicators. The preferred model using the
   temperature-humidity index (THI) gave a smoother pattern than did the
   model with temperature x humidity interaction. Both daily milk and
   fat-plus-protein yield appeared to decrease at THI >= 23, in all periods
   considered. Based on the 4-d period, yield decreased for each unit
   increase of THI above 23 {[}-62.8 g/unit (-4.2\%) for daily milk yield
   and -8.9 g/unit (-4.9\%) for daily fat-plus-protein yield]. Fat and
   protein percentages appeared to be unaffected by heat stress. A test-day
   repeatability model was applied for estimation of genetic parameters.
   The genetic correlations between the general additive effect and the
   additive effect of heat tolerance were negative (approximately -0.8) for
   both daily milk and fat-plus-protein yields in all periods considered.
   Therefore, milk yield is antagonistic with heat tolerance, and selection
   only for increased milk production will reduce heat tolerance.},

Abstract = {A total of 156 goats from 2 commercial dairy goat farms were monitored
   for intramammary infections during an entire lactation. Most of the
   infections (80.7\%) observed were due to coagulase-negative
   staphylococci (CNS) species. In herd 1, nearly all of the infections
   (96\%) were due to CNS species, with Staphylococcus caprae ( SCAP) being
   the most common specific pathogen observed, accounting for about 43\% of
   the infections. In herd 2, the proportion of the infections due to CNS
   was 67\% and Staphylococcus epidermidis (SEPI) was the most common
   pathogen (48\% of infections) and SCAP was not present. Linear somatic
   cell scores (SCS) were greater in milk from infected udder halves, with
   an average difference of 0.78 SCS. The SCS for infected udder halves was
   greater than noninfected for all CNS species, although differences among
   species were observed. The ranking across CNS species was SCAP > other
   CNS > SEPI > no infection. However, infections by SEPI tended to be more
   persistent. Increased SCS was associated with a statistically
   significant decrease in milk yield, but no effect was observed for
   intramammary infections (IMI). Ninety-seven isolates of CNS ( 53 SCAP
   and 44 SEPI) were investigated for in vitro susceptibility to several
   antimicrobial agents. Benzylpenicillin was the most effective
   antimicrobial agent against SCAP and SEPI. A concentration of 0.05 mu
   g/mL was sufficient to inhibit growth of 90\% of SCAP colonies, and 0.10
   mu g/mL yielded a similar effectiveness for SEPI. Amoxicillin and the
   combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid were only slightly less
   effective. Tetracycline (62.5 mu g/mL) and tilmicosin ( 500 mu g/mL)
   were the least effective treatments for SEPI and SCAP, respectively.},

Abstract = {Effective therapy for prion diseases is currently unavailable. Recently,
   vaccination was shown to be effective in mouse models of a particular
   neurodegenerative conditions: Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we report
   that vaccination with synthetic oligopeptides homologous to the hamster
   (Mesocricetus auratus) prion protein augments survival time in animals
   infected intraperitoneally with 263K scrapie agent. For each hamster
   included in the study, prion-specific serum antibodies as well as
   deposition of pathological prion protein (PrPres), glial fibrillary
   acidic protein (GFAP), and mRNA expression for cytokines (TNF alpha,
   IL-1 beta, IL-10) in brain tissues were evaluated. In immunized animals,
   increased survival after challenge was associated with a reduction of
   cerebral lesion, PrP deposition and GFAP expression; in these animals,
   anti-prion protein peptide antibody levels were increased, and the
   expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF alpha and IL-1 beta) was
   reduced. Vaccination could be an effective therapeutic approach to
   postpone disease onset. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test has been
   applied for the qualitative screening analysis of chloramphenicol (CAP)
   in food of animal origin (muscle, eggs, milk and honey) at level
   corresponding to the European Union (EU) minimum required performance
   limit (MRPL) set for CAP analysis. Different analytical protocols were
   developed for the extraction and purification of CAP from the matrices
   under investigation. The ELISA kit validation study was performed
   according to the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC criteria established
   for qualitative screening methods. In this regard, the following
   parameters were determined: detection capability (CC beta),
   specificity/selectivity, applicability/ruggedness/stability. ne CC beta
   value resulted below the MRPL (0.3 mu g kg(-1)) for all the examined
   matrices. No relevant interferences from matrix effects or structurally
   related substances (florfenicol (FF) and thiamphenicol (THP)) were
   observed. Slight variations of some critical factors in the sample
   pre-treatment and clean up for muscle were deliberately introduced for
   ruggedness evaluation and they did not result in any negative effect on
   the CAP detection. In addition, the recovery rates and precision at
   three concentration levels (0.30-0.45-0.60 mu g kg(-1)) were evaluated
   for all matrices under investigation. The proposed method is suitable
   for qualitative screening analysis of CAP in the above-mentioned food in
   conformity with the current EU performance requirements. (c) 2004

Abstract = {A 9-year-old female, domestic short hair cat was presented with sudden

   ulcerated and nonulcerated nodules located all over the trunk. Clinical
   evaluation revealed hypothermia and respiratory distress. Cytology from
   both skin nodules and bronchoalveolar lavage showed macrophages and

   or similar organisms. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline
   leukaemia virus (FeLV) serology results were negative. The cat was
   seropositive for Toxoplasma (IgG 1 : 640) and Neospora (1 : 80)
   infections. The cat died soon after referral. Necropsy revealed
   pyothorax, necrotic/purulent pneumonia, haemorrhagic spots on kidneys
   and mesentery. Histopathology from skin nodules showed diffuse, deep
   necrotic dermatitis/panniculitis, vasculitis and disseminated free and
   grouped protozoa. The parasites were found in lungs, spleen, kidneys and
   liver. Immunohistochemistry on skin tissue with anti-Toxoplasma gondii
   and Neospora caninum antibodies gave positive results with both.
   Electron microscopy showed single and grouped tachyzoites with
   morphological features of T. gondii, often within macrophages. Samples
   of cutaneous nodules and bronchoalveolar fluid were examined by a
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for detecting apicomplexa
   coccidia. PCR results were consistent only with T. gondii infection.
   Therefore, immunohistochemistry positivity for N. caninum was considered
   a cross-reaction and a diagnosis of cutaneous and visceral toxoplasmosis
   was made.},

Abstract = {Because low-dose interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) treatment had proved
   effective in several models of chronic inflammation and autoimmune
   disease, a possible role of IFN-alpha in modulating the response of
   swine leukocytes to bacterial endotoxin was investigated in this study.
   Exposure of swine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to low
   concentrations of human IFN-alpha caused a strong, dose-dependent
   decrease in CD14 expression, the lowest level being observed at 5 U/ml
   IFN-alpha. This result was confirmed if PBMC were later exposed to
   purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A 10-fold lower IFN-alpha
   concentration (0.5 U/ml) caused the largest reduction of tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) accumulation in the medium of pulmonary
   alveolar macrophages ( PAM), stimulated with bacterial LPS. At 0.5 U/ml,
   the expression of the TNF-alpha gene in PAM was also strongly reduced,
   as opposed to cells pretreated with 50 U/ml IFN-alpha. In contrast,
   expression of the interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) gene was stimulated and
   that of the IL-6 gene was not significantly affected at both IFN-alpha
   concentrations. Results point to an important role of IFN-alpha in
   control of the inflammatory response to bacterial endotoxin in pigs.},

Abstract = {A blocking ELISA that differentiated foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV)
   infected animals from vaccinated animals was developed which uses
   baculovirus expressed FMDV 3ABC non-structural protein as antigen and
   monoclonal antibody against FMDV 3ABC non-structural protein as capture
   and detector antibody. Sera from naive, vaccinated and infected cattle,
   sheep and pigs were examined. The specificity of the test was high.
   Non-specific reactions observed in particular in sera of cattle and
   sheep could be removed by filtration and inactivation. Positive
   reactions were obtained for sera from cattle infected with all seven
   serotypes of FMDV. The test detected antibodies from days 7 or 9
   following experimental infection of non-vaccinated cattle and sheep, and
   in cattle strong positive reactions persisted for up to 395 days after
   infection. In vaccinated cattle that became carriers after challenge
   with homologous FMDV, positive reactions were obtained in all but one
   case. In some of these cattle the antibody response was detected late in
   comparison to the non-vaccinated infected cattle. The test gave results
   that compared favourably with two commercial ELISA's when used to test
   sera from cattle, pigs and sheep collected after experimental or natural
   infection. The blocking ELISA based on recombinant FMDV 3ABC antigen and
   a monoclonal antibody to 3ABC is a promising tool for FMD control and
   eradication campaigns, where vaccination has been carried out.},

Abstract = {A cross-sectional serological survey was conducted on cattle pasturing
   in an area of the southern Italian Apennines to evaluate the
   seroprevalence to Neospora caninum, and to investigate the climatic,
   environmental, farm management, and individual animal factors that
   influence the distribution of this protozoan. Blood samples were
   collected from 864 pastured cattle raised on 81 farms. Serum samples
   were tested for antibodies to N. caninum using an ELISA assay
   (HerdCheck((R)), IDEXX). A geographical information system (GIs) for the
   study area was constructed using the following remote sensing (RS) and
   landscape feature data: autumn-winter, spring and summer normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI), land cover, elevation, slope,
   aspect, mean rainfall and minimum, mean, and maximum temperature in
   spring, summer, autumn and winter. Data on each of these features were
   then extracted for ``buffer zones{''} consisting of the area included in
   a circle of 3 km diameter centered on the 81 geo-referenced centroids of
   the main cattle pastures. Climatic and environmental data obtained from
   RS and GIs and individual animal characteristics and farm management
   data obtained from a questionnaire were analyzed in relation to N.
   caninum seropositivity and antibody titres both by linear and logistic
   regression models. Out of the 81 farms sampled, 63 (77.8\%) had at least
   one tested animal positive for N. caninum. Out of the 864 bovine sera
   samples, 266 (30.8\%) were found to have antibodies to N. caninum. The
   results of the logistic regression model show that significantly high
   seroprevalence to N. caninum was found in heifers/steers and adults, in
   cattle raised on farms having a large number of dogs, and in cattle
   raised in buffer zones having high minimum temperatures in the spring,
   and a narrow extension of summer NDVI. In addition, positive linear
   correlations were found between N. caninum antibody titres and the
   number of dogs on farm, and the minimum temperature in spring.
   All the above determined risk factors for N. caninum seroprevalence
   indicate that horizontal infection resulting from the ingestion of
   oocysts shed by dogs is the most probable route of N. caninum infection
   in pastured cattle of the southern Italian Apennines. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to monitor ovarian function in
   postpartum primiparous and pluriparous Mediterranean Italian buffaloes
   (Bubalus bubalis) during months of increasing day-length. Ovarian
   ultrasound monitoring was carried out for a total of 60 days from
   calving in 10 primiparous and 10 pluriparous buffaloes. Progesterone was
   determined from calving until a week after first postpartum ovulation.
   The study was undertaken during months of increasing day length. Time
   required for complete postpartum uterine involution was 31 +/- 1.0 and
   33 +/- 1.3 days in primiparous and pluriparous buffaloes respectively (P
   = 0.1). The first postpartum ovulation was recorded on 4 primiparous and
   8 pluriparous buffaloes (P = 0.16). Time for first postpartum ovulation
   to occur was 25.5 +/- 6.9 and 15.5 +/- 1.3 days in primiparous and
   pluriparous buffaloes, respectively (P = 0.07). Overall, 8 of the 12
   first postpartum ovulations (66.6\%) occurred in the ovary contralateral
   to the one bearing the gravidic CL, one out of 4 in primiparous and 3
   out of 8 in pluriparous buffaloes (P = 1.0). Following a first
   postpartum ovulation, 3 primiparous and 4 pluriparous buffaloes
   displayed a complete wave of follicular development leading to a new
   ovulation. Ovulation following parturition was not recorded in 6
   primiparous and two pluriparous buffaloes for the 60 days of ultrasound
   monitoring. Growth rate (mm/d) and largest size (nun) of first
   postpartum ovulating follicle was 0.95 +/- 0.18 and 1.07 +/- 0.07 (P =
   0.4), and 13.5 +/- 0.8 and 14.1 +/- 0.4 (P = 0.4) in primiparous and
   pluriparous buffaloes, respectively. Following calving, the total number
   of available antral follicles (>= 2 mm) declined gradually towards the
   end of the study period. Follicles greater or equal to 3 rum in diameter
   on the contrary showed a prominent increase in the first 2 weeks from
   calving. The number of follicles greater or equal to 3 mm in diameter
   was significantly higher in the ovary contra-lateral to the one bearing
   the gravidic CL. A balance in the number of such follicles was reached
   toward the end of the first month. In conclusion, although some
   follicular activity was recorded in the ovaries of all buffaloes, true
   postpartum resumption of cyclicity in the months of increasing daylight
   hours was delayed in the majority of animals. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {Twenty-seven dogs infected naturally with Leishmania infantum were used
   in a randomised controlled trial to compare the clinical and
   parasitological efficacy of an oral treatment with a combination of
   metronidazole and spiramycin (13 dogs) with the efficacy of conventional
   treatment with meglumine antimonate and allopurinol (14 dogs) as
   controls. In the test group one dog had to be withdrawn from the
   treatment because it developed pemphigus foliaceus; 10 of the dogs were
   clinically responsive but none was cured parasitologically. in the
   control group four dogs were withdrawn from the treatment because of
   side effects; eight of the dogs were clinically responsive but none was
   cured parasitologically. The control group showed signs of improvement
   after an average of 30 days, whereas the test group did not show signs
   of improvement until after an average of 45 days.},

Abstract = {In 2001 and 2002, 235 outbreaks of bluetongue were observed in the Lazio
   and Tuscany regions of central Italy. During entomological surveillance
   Culicoides imicola, the main vector of bluetongue virus in the
   Mediterranean region, was detected in only 14 of 28 municipalities
   affected by outbreaks; Culicoides obsoletus was the most abundant
   species, contributing 83 per cent of individuals in catches, whereas C
   imicola contributed only 2 per cent. in affected municipalities the
   maximum catch of C obsoletus was 18,000 specimens, compared with 54 of C
   imicola. in October 2002 bluetongue virus serotype 2 was isolated from a
   single pool of wild-caught, non-blood-engorged parous C obsoletus
   inoculated on to BHK-21 cells. its identity was confirmed by reverse

Abstract = {Diagnostic differentiation between the ruminant pathogens Mycoplasma
   agalactiae and Mycoplasma bovis is known to be problematic when only
   conventional serological and biochemical tests are used. The main reason
   for this is that both agents share a considerable number of related
   proteins and common epitopes. DNA-based detection methods offer
   advantages in terms of specificity and sensitivity. However, there is an
   urgent need to compare currently used PCR assays because they target
   different genomic regions and, therefore, may perform differently. In
   the present work, five laboratories, which use PCR routinely, evaluated
   the specificity of four different PCR systems for M. agalactiae and
   three systems for M. bovis on a total of 41 strains of the two
   Mycoplasina species including six previously unidentified strains. As
   the vast majority of PCR examinations (97.1\% of all tests) correctly
   identified the strains the specificity of all seven detection systems
   appears to be high. In four cases, incorrect identification by
   conventional diagnostic methods was rectified by PCR. Isolates from
   non-typical hosts, i.e. three M. bovis strains from small ruminants and
   two M. agalactiae strains from cattle, were characterised by sequencing
   the 16S and part of the 23S ribosomal RNA genes. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

   Sample extraction was performed with acetonitrile/water mixtures.
   Mycosep((c)) columns were used for a fast and effective clean-up
   procedure. The analytes were separated by HPLC with a RP C18 column by
   means of a gradient elution and detected in an ESI-interfaced single
   quadrupole mass spectrometer. Type B and type A trichothecenes were
   monitored in the negative and in the positive ion mode, respectively.
   The method performance is reported in terms of linearity (r(2) = 0.999),
   specificity, accuracy (recoveries from 70-120\%) and precision (CV\%
   =5), the LOQs are in the range 10-20 mu g/Kg.},

Abstract = {The causative agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis was recently
   reclassified as Anaplasma phagoeytophilum, unifying previously described
   bacteria that cause disease in humans, horses, dogs, and ruminants. For
   the characterization of genetic heterogeneity in this species, the
   homologue of Anaplasma marginale major surface protein 4 gene (msp4) was
   identified, and the coding region was PCR amplified and sequenced from a
   variety of sources, including 50 samples from the United States,
   Germany, Poland, Norway, Italy, and Switzerland and 4 samples of A.
   phagocytophilum-like organisms obtained from white-tailed deer in the
   United States. Sequence variation between strains of A. phagocytophilum
   (90 to 100 \% identity at the nucleotide level and 92 to 100 \%
   similarity at the protein level) was higher than in A. marginale.
   Phylogenetic analyses of msp4 sequences did not provide phylogeographic
   information but did differentiate strains of A. phagocytophilum obtained
   from ruminants from those obtained from humans, dogs, and horses. The
   sequence analysis of the recently discovered A. phagocytophilum msp2
   gene corroborated these results. The results reported here suggest that
   although A. phagocytophilum-like organisms from white-tailed deer may be
   closely related to A. phagoeytophilum, they could be more diverse. These
   results suggest that A. phagocytophilum strains from ruminants could
   share some common characteristics, including reservoirs and
   pathogenicity, which may be different from strains that infect humans.},

Abstract = {An epidemiological survey was performed to detect the presence of
   Chlamydophila (C.) abortus and other members of the order Chlamydiales
   in ovine and caprine flocks with a history of abortion in southern
   Italy. Four pairs of primers were compared to evaluate their ability to
   detect Chlamydiales using purified DNA preparations and tissue samples
   from aborted foetuses with suspected chlamydial infections. As expected,
   amplification of DNA of the reference strain C abortus using primer
   pairs U23F/23Sigr, 16SF2/23R, CTU/CTL and CpsiA/CpsiB produced fragments
   of about 600 bp, 585 bp, 1000 bp and 300 bp, respectively. The detection
   limits of the four PCR tests performed on serial DNA dilutions of the C.
   abortus reference strain were of 10 pg, 0.1 pg, 0.1 pg and 1 fg of DNA,
   respectively. The most sensitive amplification of DNA extracted from the
   organ tissues was obtained with primer pairs CpsiA/CpsiB, which detected
   Chlamydophila spp. DNA in all infected tissue samples. Only C. abortus
   was identified during the survey. The presence of this agent was
   confirmed in 3 out of 27 ovine and caprine flocks included in the survey
   suggesting that abortion due to C abortus is uncommon in southern Italy.},

Abstract = {Between 1999-2003, 14321 sera and 646 abortion samples (498 foetuses and
   148 placentae) were analysed from 807 sheep and goat farms distributed
   all over the island of Sardinia. After notification of abortion in a
   flock, sera collected at random from adult animals were examined to
   detect antibodies specific to Chlamydophila (C) abortus by ELISA,
   whereas foetuses and placenta were analysed by PCR assay. Specific IgG
   antibodies were detected in 611 (4.8\%) sheep and 106 (5.8\%) goats.
   From a total of 2050 ovine and 151 caprine fetal samples including
   muscle, liver, abomasum, spleen, brain and placenta, 29 (1.4\%) ovine
   and 1 (0.6\%) caprine samples were C abortus PCR-positive. Placenta was
   the tissue with the highest detection rate. These results indicate that
   the seroprevalence of C abortus infection in sheep and goats is very low
   in Sardinia, and PCR results demonstrate that C abortus has no
   significant role in abortion, especially in goats.},

Abstract = {Five areas populated by Apodemus sylvaticus in South of Italy have been

   nematodes (Trichuris muris, Aonchotheca muris-sylvatici, A. sp.,
   Mastophorus muris, Rictularia proni, Heligmosomoides polygyrus, Syphacia
   stroma, S. frederici and Aspiculuris tetraptera) were found. Mean
   intensities of intestinal helminths were higher in adults and males. The
   number of parasite species found in Calabria was lower compared to
   helminth communities of the northern part of the European peninsulas and
   of other continental areas. The specific richness was similar to that
   observed in vertebrate taxa: in a peninsula, the number of species
   decreases due to habitat barriers that progressively reduce the
   possibility of colonization.},

Abstract = {Oral vaccination of foxes (OVF) is a powerful tool to combat rabies in
   wildlife, and large parts of western Europe have been freed from rabies
   using this tool. Nevertheless, the success of OVF. given with the number
   of campaigns needed to eliminate the disease, depends on many factors.
   This article for the first time focuses on and assesses difference in
   OVF with respect to the spatial setting of vaccinated areas with time.
   The size of the areas vaccinated with time and the size of the
   overlapping area of consecutively vaccinated areas are particularly
   considered. In order to integrate these two aspects into one single
   figure, an Area Index is proposed ranging between 0 and 1. A statistical
   analysis indicates that the number of campaigns needed for rabies
   elimination significantly decreases on condition that the total rabies
   endemic area is consecutively treated right from the beginning of oral
   vaccination, Hence, from an economical and environmental point of view,
   vaccination areas should be selected the way that guarantees an Area
   Index close to 1, The concept of an Area Index, as described here, is a
   useful tool not only in the context of OVF, but it could also be used
   for other control schemes against infectious diseases in wildlife.},

Abstract = {A Russian jumper horse presented because of an ocular perilimbal
   conjunctival mass and, on clinical examination, two bilateral
   conjunctival masses were found, of different size and conformation.
   Attempts at complete excision of the left eye mass and excisional biopsy
   of the right eye mass were performed. The left eye mass recurred
   rapidly, but resolved completely after topical corticosteroid therapy.
   The two lesions had similar histopathologic features, characterized by
   focal, chronic, primarily lymphocytic conjunctivitis with follicular
   lymphoid hyperplasia. Special histopathologic staining techniques
   (Gomori methenamine silver and acid fast stains) and
   immunohistochemistry (for CD3, BLA36 and lysozyme) failed to reveal any
   etiologic agents and indicated an inflammatory lesion composed of a
   heterogeneous population of lymphocytes and macrophages (nodular
   lymphocytic conjunctivitis). The lesions were indistinguishable,
   clinically and behaviorally, from what has been reported as
   `conjunctival pseudotumor' in the horse. Equine conjunctival
   pseudotumor/nodular lymphocytic conjunctivitis has been reported to be
   unilateral and have a good prognosis after partial or complete surgical
   excision. This is the first reported case of bilateral nodular
   lymphocytic conjunctivitis in a horse and for which surgical excision
   alone was not curative.},

Abstract = {In the European Union the serological diagnosis of brucellosis caused by
   Brucella melitensis is performed using the heterologous antigen of B.
   abortus S99. The possible higher sensitivity or ability of an early
   detection of antibodies by a homologous antigen may prove very useful in
   the final phases of an eradication programme. Results obtained in sheep
   experimentally infected by B. melitensis biovar 3 were compared using B.
   abortus S99, B. melitensis M1, M2 and M3 antigens in the Rose Bengal
   plate test (RBPT), the complement fixation test (CFT) and an
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. Forty-six sheep from an
   officially brucellosis-free flock were experimentally infected
   intraconjunctivally with B. melitensis biovar 3. Prior to infection, all
   animals were tested first against Brucella antibodies, weekly for 2
   months post-infection (PI) and then monthly for a further 71/2 months.
   All sera were tested against the antigens listed above using RBPT, CFT
   and ELISA. Using a Bayesian approach, test sensitivities were estimated
   and compared. Their ability for the early detection of antibodies was
   evaluated through a regression model based on a logit response model,
   using the number of days PI as the independent variable and the logit of
   the fraction of positive animals as the dependent variable. No
   significant differences were detected among the various antigens used,
   either in terms of sensitivity or in terms of antibody kinetics;
   however, the CFT was significantly less sensitive than the RBPT and
   ELISA and it also showed a lower rate of increase of percentage positive
   animals (beta-coefficient of regression analysis).},

Abstract = {Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are a class of sporadic,
   genetic and transmissible neurodegenerative diseases that affect both
   humans and animals. Propagation of these diseases is thought to be due
   to the misfolding of a neuronal glyco-protein, PrP(c), into a
   pathological insoluble conformer, PrP(Sc). In earlier works, some serum
   components were identified as exclusive PrP(Sc)-interacting proteins
   (Fisher et al., Nature 2000;408:479), and thus those macromolecules were
   thought to represent a potential diagnostic endogenous factor
   discriminating between normal and pathological prion proteins. In
   contrast, in agreement with a recent work (Kornblatt et al., Biochem
   Biophys Res Commun 2003;305:518), in this paper we present a detailed
   thermodynamic and kinetic characterization of the interaction between
   recombinant bovine PrP(c 25-242) and the human serum component
   plasminogen, measured using a resonant mirror technique: our results
   reveal a high-affinity interaction between the two binding partners. For
   comparison, the complex obtained from the purified full-length PrP(c)
   and human plasminogen was also studied: both prion proteins (the
   recombinant bovine Prp(c) (25-242) and the purified full-length PrP(c))
   are able to bind human plasminogen. Both kinetic and thermodynamic
   parameters are affected by the modulation exerted by the H(+) ions in
   solution. Moreover, the analysis of binding, according to canonical
   linkage relationships, suggests the involvement of a His residue,
   consistent with the interaction between other serine (pro)enzymes and
   their ligands. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Common fragile sites have been involved in neoplastic transformation,
   although their molecular basis is still poorly understood. Here, we
   demonstrate that inhibition of the SMC1 by RNAi is sufficient to induce
   fragile site expression. By investigating normal, ATM- and ATR-deficient
   cell lines, we provide evidence that the contribution of SMC1 in
   preventing the collapse of stalled replication fork is an Atr-dependent
   pathway. Using a fluorescent antibody specific for gamma-H2AX, we show
   that very rare discrete nuclear foci appear 1 and 2 h after exposure to
   aphidicolin and/or RNAi-SMC1, but became more numerous and distinct
   after longer treatment times. In this context, fragile sites might be
   viewed as an in vitro phenomenon originating from double-strand breaks
   formed because of a stalled DNA replication that lasted too long to be
   managed by physiological rescue acting through the Atr/Smc1 axis. We
   propose that in vivo, following an extreme replication block, rare cells
   could escape checkpoint mechanisms and enter mitosis with a defect in
   genome assembly, eventually leading to neoplastic transformation.},

Abstract = {Immunosuppression, myeloablation, and the use of immunologically
   immature tissue can overcome major histocompatibility complex barriers
   by inducing tolerance. With the goal of inducing tolerance to
   BALB/c-derived murine hybridoma cells producing the 4C6 monoclonal
   antibody (mAb), we transplanted BALB/c fetal tissue into neonatal pigs
   during a regimen of low-dose conditioning with busulfan and
   cyclophosphamide. After the tolerance induction phase, animals received
   intraperitoneal injections of 4C6 mAb hybridoma cells. Evidence of
   persistence of injected cells over time was sought by molecular analysis
   of peripheral blood for the presence of mouse genomic sequences and
   circulating 4C6 mAb. Persistence of donor polymerase chain reaction
   signal during the entire duration of the study, detectable mAb titer for
   6 weeks, and a twofold increase of mAb concentration after a boost
   hybridoma infusion was observed in one animal receiving six consecutive
   administrations of the conditioning regimen. Our model has the
   distinctive advantage of allowing functional monitoring of engrafted
   cells for studying tolerance induction strategies. In addition, this
   model could be the basis for approaches aimed at producing mAbs in
   tolerized large animals.},

Abstract = {We report a case of dirofilariasis of the breast occurring in a 6-yr-old
   Bernese female dog living in central Italy presenting with a breast
   lump, diagnosed on cytological examination of nipple secretion fluid
   smears. The direct smears of nipple discharge revealed clusters of
   glandular cells characterized by mild pleomorphic appearance and the
   presence of some nematodes of about 350 Am in length in the background.
   The smears also contained several inflammatory cells, including
   eosinophils. Both the Knott and the antigen tests were negative for
   Dirofilaria immitis. The morphological features of this round worm is
   compatible with that of Dirofilaria repens. The case describes an
   unusual finding of dirofilariasis presenting as a breast lump,
   simulating an inflammatory breast carcinoma. (C) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {The continuous turn over of beta-agonists molecules, may affect the
   reliability of screening tests. To overcome possible false negative
   results, a bioassay is under development to detect the presence of new
   beta-agonists in feeds and biological matrices and so to provide a valid
   tool for a multi-analyte screening method. Preliminary study were
   focused on the pharmacological characterisation of new beta-agonists,
   with the aim to combine both the screening results with a toxicological
   evaluation about the potential health risk for consumers. The
   interaction of G4, G5, G6, G8 adrenergic drugs with human beta(1) - and
   beta(2)-adrenergic receptors expressed separately in membranes of human
   embryonic kidney cells in culture (HEK-293-Hubeta(1) and
   HEK-293-Hubeta(2)), Were studied by a receptor binding assay and results
   compared with those from a well-known P-adrenergic agonist
   (clenbuterol). The specificity of the test was assured by the use of a
   specific radiolabel tracer ligand ({[}I-125]iodopindolol) as competitor.
   For compounds G4, G5 and G6 the affinity (IC50) for beta(1)-adrenergic
   binding sites was of the same magnitude of that from clenbuterol. By
   contrast, G8 showed a 100-fold higher affinity. On beta(2)-adrenergic
   receptors the binding affinity was similar for G4 and G6, but about
   10-fold higher for G5 and G8 with respect to that from clenbuterol. (C)

Abstract = {It is impossible to determine whether an analytical procedure is
   suitable to the purposes without some knowledge of its uncertainty.
   Several approaches for its estimation have already been proposed in the
   past years. Discussion on the estimation of uncertainty of chemical
   measurement has also influenced the ISO 17025 which explicitly refers to
   the bottom-up approach.
   On the other hand, the European Commission Decision 2002/657/EC
   concerning the performance of methods and the interpretation of results
   in the official control of residues in products of animal origin imposes
   the determination of some new parameters, such as decision limit
   (CCalpha) which represents an index of results dispersion. This decision
   also indicates that official laboratories must be accredited according
   to ISO 17025.
   In this work, the bottom-up approach together with in-house validation
   data is applied for the evaluation of measurement uncertainty associated
   with residue determination of 10 sulfonamides in muscle and, at the same
   time, the decision limit was calculated following the 2002/657/EC
   criteria. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A 6-month calf was treated with 1 mg kg(-1) wet weight of
   17-beta-boldenone undecanoate and urine and faeces were collected for a
   period of 30 days after the treatment to follow the depletion of the
   different substances related to boldenone. Hair was collected for just a
   few days. Multiresidue extraction and purification methods were
   developed for the different matrices. Separation was carried on a RP-C
   18 LC column and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
   detection was performed using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped
   with electrospray source for urine and with atmospheric pressure
   chemical ionisation for faeces. The concentration found for the
   different analytes was discussed compared to a control animal. (C) 2004

Abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is a very common organism capable of producing
   several enterotoxins (SEs) that cause intoxication symptoms of varying
   intensity in humans when ingested through contaminated food. This paper
   reports the results of an investigation on the presence of
   Coagulase-Positive Staphylococci (CPS) and S. aureus in several food
   products marketed in Italy and on food contact surface swabs sampled
   from the food industry. A total of 11,384 samples were examined and 1971
   of them (17.3\%) were found to contain CPS. The assays performed on 541
   CPS strains led to the identification of 537 S. aureus strains on which
   characterization of type A, B, C and D staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEA,
   SEB, SEC and SED) was performed. A total of 298 S. aureus strains
   (55.5\%) produced one or more SEs: 33.9\% of the strains produced SEC,
   26.5\% SEA, 20.5\% SEA + SED, 13.4\% SED, 2.7\% SEB, 1.7\% SEA + SEB,
   0.7\% SEC + SED and 0.3\% produced SEA + SEC and SEB + SEC.
   The investigation highlighted that these organisms are very common and
   constitute a potential risk for consumers' health. (c) 2004 Elsevier

Title = {Isotope dilution determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in

Abstract = {A gas chromatographic (GC) method with mass spectrometry detection (MS)
   for the determination of eight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
   in olive pomace oil has been developed. The oil was diluted with
   n-pentane and extracted by liquid-liquid partition with dimethyl
   sulphoxide (DMSO). After water addition and back-extraction with
   cyclohexane, a thin-layer chromatography on silica gel was performed as
   a further purification step. The PAHs spot was scraped off from the
   plate and the final extract was concentrated and analysed by GC-MS in
   full scan mode. The eight PAHs under investigation were determined in
   the presence of the corresponding labelled compounds added as internal
   standards to the sample at the beginning of the analytical process. The
   identified PAHs were then quantified by the isotope dilution methodology
   assuring the compensation of the concentration of each analyte for any
   variation in the sample preparation. The method precision was
   satisfactory with relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) values in the
   range 3.6-12.7\% for all PAHs. The average recovery rates ranged from
   69.0 to 97.5\%. Accuracy was also calculated for benzo{[}k]fluoranthene,
   benzo{[}a]pyrene, indeno{[}1,2,3-cd]pyrene and benzo{[}ghi]perylene by
   analysing a certified reference material (CRM 458, coconut oil) with
   adequate results. All response curves exhibited a linear fit from 0.1 to
   10 mug ml(-1) and the determination coefficients R 2 were better than
   0.9942. The limits of detection (0.1-0.4 mug kg(-1)) were acceptable
   when compared with the maximum permitted limit of 2 mug kg(-1) for each
   of the eight considered PAHs and 5 mug kg(-1) for the sum of the eight
   PAHs established by the Italian legislation. Measurement uncertainty was
   finally calculated identifying and quantifying the uncertainty
   components of the analytical process. The relative expanded
   uncertainties (U-c), expressed as percent values were in the range
   8.5-11.4\% thus appropriate for residues quantification in the range of
   concentrations considered in the present study. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Malassezia yeasts are commensal organisms of human and animal skin that
   occasionally act as pathogens; lipid-dependent species are associated
   with human skin disorders. The aim of this work was to evaluate the
   occurrence, risk factors and population size of different species of
   Malassezia in the external ear canal of dogs and cats with and without
   otitis externa. Between 2001 and 2003, 107 healthy animals (25 cats and
   82 dogs) and 123 animals with chronic otitis exteirna (48 cats and 75
   dogs) were clinically examined. Sterile cotton swabs were used to
   collect specimens from the external ear canal and culture tests and
   cytological examinations were performed to detect the presence and
   population size of Malassezia yeasts. Malassezia yeasts were isolated
   from 72.9\% and 40\% of the cats and from 57.3\% and 28.0\% of the dogs,
   with and without otitis externa, respectively. Malassezia was frequently
   isolated from animals under 5 years of age. The highest prevalence of
   positive samples was reported in winter for cats and in autumn for dogs.
   Dogs with pendulous ears showed a higher incidence of infection than
   dogs with erect ears. More Malassezia yeasts were recovered from animals
   with otitis (i.e. 59.6 colony forming units - CFUs - for cats and 66.0
   CFUs for dogs) than healthy animals. Out of the 413 isolates obtained
   from animals with and without otitis, 403 (97.6\%) were identified as M.
   pachydermatis and 10 (2.4\%) as M. globosa. A statistical evaluation of
   the occurrence of Malassezia yeasts in dogs and cats revealed that
   predisposing factors for Malassezia infections are sampling period for
   cats, and type of ear for dogs. The largest population of Malassezia
   yeasts was detected in animals with otitis, suggesting a role in the
   occurrence of lesions.},

Title = {Effects of two different prepartum diets on some metabolic traits and
   productive response in multiparous Holstein cows in early lactation},
Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {127-137},
Abstract = {Twenty-six multiparous Italian Holstein cows were used to compare two
   feeding strategies for the prepartum period. Cows were allocated to two
   dietary treatments on the basis of their parity (3.1 +/- 1.1) and mature
   equivalent production (11473 +/- 1449 kg). From 20 +/- 7 d precalving to
   the calving day, one group of 13 cows (parity = 3.1 +/- 1.0; mature
   equivalent production = 11473 1606 kg) was fed a Control diet made by
   mixing a 50:50 as fed combination of the far off dry ration and the
   lactation diet fed postpartum. The remaining cows (parity = 3.1 1.1;
   mature equivalent production = 11473 1338 kg) were fed a prepartum diet
   (Anionic) obtained by supplementing the far off dry ration with energy
   and protein sources plus calcium chloride. This diet had a lower dietary
   cation-anion difference than the Control diet (7.35 vs 26.66 meq/100 g
   DM; P<0.05) and it induced a significant decrease in the cows' urine pH
   (7.58 vs 7.95; P<0.01). Cows fed the Anionic diet had the lowest DM
   intake during the prepartum (12.0 vs 13.4 kg/d; P<0.01), but at
   parturition they showed a limited drop in plasma Ca reducing the
   incidence of subclinical hypocalcaemia in comparison with the Control
   group (8 vs 62\%; P<0.01). No differences due to the prepartum diet were
   observed for the plasma levels of several indicators of hepatic function
   (aspartate-amino transferase, Y-glutamil transferase, creatin-kinase and
   bilirubine). After calving, all the cows were co-mingled and fed the
   same lactation ration and those that had received the Anionic diet
   during the prepartum showed a significant increase in milk yield with no
   changes in milk quality. Average production at the peak of lactation was
   43.8 kg/d for Control cows while it raised up to 47.8 kg/d (P<0.05) for
   the animals fed the Anionic diet during the prepartum. This positive
   result was obtained with a lower loss in cows' body condition score
   measured at 30 and 60 days in milk and without any effect on the uterine
   involution process. The use of the Anionic diet has proven to be an
   effective alternative to the common practice of feeding close-up diets
   made by a partial replacement of the far off dry ration with the diet
   fed to the lactating cows. This strategy should be particularly
   recommended for dairy herds in which there is a great incidence of
   metabolic and health problems related to clinical or subclinical
   hypocalcaemia in the early postpartum.},

Title = {Fine-needle biopsy of external ear canal masses in the cat: cytologic
   results and histologic correlations in 27 cases},
Journal = {VETERINARY CLINICAL PATHOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {34},
Number = {2},
Pages = {100-105},
Abstract = {Background: The cytologic diagnosis of ear canal tumors is difficult or
   impossible by swab alone because cell exfoliation may be poor and
   neoplastic cells may be masked by associated inflammation. Fine-needle
   biopsy (FNB) can be used to obtain a higher yield of cells for
   diagnosis.
   Objectives: The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and
   diagnostic value of FNB and cytologic examination in providing an
   accurate diagnosis of masses growing in the external ear canal of cats.
   Methods: Cytologic specimens from masses in the external ear canal,
   taken under inhaled, general anesthesia, were classified into 4 groups:
   1) ceruminous gland hyperplasia or adenoma, 2) ceruminous gland
   adenocarcinoma, 3) inflammatory polyps, and 4) other neoplastic and
   nonneoplastic masses. Cytopathologic diagnoses were compared with the
   final histopathologic diagnoses, and indices of diagnostic test accuracy
   (sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, diagnostic-odds ratios)
   were calculated.
   Results: Twenty-seven masses (from 25 cats, including 2 cats affected
   bilaterally) were included in the study. The results showed good
   correspondence between cytologic and histologic diagnoses with an
   overall agreement index W of .74, a diagnostic odds ratio of 22, and
   100\% (27/27) agreement in the diagnosis of inflammatory polyps versus
   neoplasia (both benign and malignant).
   Conclusions: FNB cytopathology of external ear masses in the cat was
   sufficiently accurate for distinguishing inflammatory polyps from
   neoplasia. For differentiation of benign proliferation and malignant
   neoplasia, however, histopathologic confirmation is recommended. (c)

Abstract = {A multiplex PCR assay using three collagenase-targeted primer pairs for
   the species- specific detection of Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio

   highlight the species specificity of the three primer sets designed.
   Because of the increasing importance of Vibrio spp. in human foodborne
   diseases, molecular approaches for routine microbial screening and
   monitoring of clinical, environmental, and food samples also have become
   more important. The results of this study indicate that the gene coding
   for collagenase should be used as an alternative molecular target to
   discriminate among, the three Vibrio species.},

Abstract = {Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and selected biochemical

   II were measured in carp liver of both sexes collected from Lake
   Trasimeno during the spawning and postspawning periods. The most
   abundant congeners found were PCB-138, PCB-153 and PCB-180, even if all
   PCB congeners investigated were recorded in low amounts. No significant
   variations in congener concentrations in relation to sex and sampling
   periods were observed in carp liver. Among the biochemical parameters
   investigated, total glutathione, glutathione S-transferase, glyoxalase
   II and catalase, showed differences according to sex, and thus the
   variations in antioxidant response of carp seem to be linked more to
   biological status, than to the presence of PCBs congeners in liver of
   the same specimens.},

   chloramphenicol (CAP) in bovine and buffalo raw milk. CAP is extracted
   in acetonitrile and purified by affinity chromatography on an
   alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) column, then is identified and
   determined by ion-trap liquid chromatography/electrospray ionisation
   tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS) analysis in the negative ion
   mode. CAP was identified at the minimum required performance limit
   (MRPL) of 0.30 ppb, by monitoring the {[}M-H](-) ion and at least two
   product ions, meeting the qualitative and quantitative criteria set by
   the European Commission in Decision 2002/657/EC for confirmation of
   prohibited veterinary drugs. The trueness and within-day and between-day
   repeatability data are also reported. Moreover, the loading capacity of
   affinity columns towards CAP was tested. This method, based on the
   molecular recognition between drug and AAG during the purification step
   to improve sample cleanup, represents a quantitative and repeatable
   procedure for confirmatory analysis, and fits the requirements for the
   routine official control of CAP residues in raw milk. Copyright (C) 2005

Abstract = {The aim of this study was the development of a veterinary dosage form
   constituted by injectable biodegradable microspheres designed for the
   subcutaneous release of carboplatin, a chemotherapeutic drug. Poly( D,
   L-lactide) (PDLLA) microspheres were prepared by an emulsification/
   spray-drying method, using the drug-to-polymer weight ratios 1: 9 and 1:
   5; blank microspheres (1\% w/v) were prepared as a comparison.
   Microparticles were characterized in terms of morphology, encapsulation
   efficiency, and in vitro drug release behavior. In vivo tests were
   conducted on rats by subcutaneous injection of microsphere aqueous
   suspensions. Levels of carboplatin were evaluated both in the skin and
   in serum. The microparticles obtained had a spherical shape; particle
   size ranged from 5 to 7 mm, dependent on drug loading. Microspheres were
   able to control the in vitro release of the drug: approximately 90\% to
   100\% of the carboplatin was released over 30 days. In vivo results
   showed that the microspheres were able to release high drug amounts
   locally, and sustained serum levels of drug were also achieved. Based on
   these results, carboplatin-loaded PDLLA microspheres may be useful for
   local delivery of the antineoplastic drug to the tumor, avoiding tumor
   recurrence in small animals, and may decrease the formation of distant
   metastases.},

Journal = {MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {70},

Abstract = {Native red deer of Mesola Wood, northern Italy, were compared with the
   Sardinian subspecies and with some populations from the Italian Alps and
   Austria using the analysis of restriction fragment Length polymorphism
   (RELP) of mitochondrial (mt) DNA segments. The results highlight the
   existence of four main genetic Lineages, and provide evidence for a
   structuring of populations according to their geographic occurrence. Two
   mitochondrial lineages, although highly distantly related, are shared
   between the populations from the centre-eastern Alps of Italy and
   Austria, white the other two lineages characterize the Sardinian and
   Mesola red deer, respectively. The exclusive haplotype found in the
   Mesola population appears as being an offshot of one of the two main
   Alpine lineages, suggesting a presumed origin of these deer from a
   panmictic population which dwelt in mid-southern Europe, prior to the
   fragmentation of populations caused by human activities and
   manipulations. Considering their distinctiveness in morphologic and
   genetic traits, as well as their historical background and
   biogeographical value, these native deer should be regarded as a
   national conservation priority. The Sardinian red deer is highly
   divergent from both Mesola and Alpine populations. However, the
   controversial question of the phylogeographic origin of this subspecies
   remains unresolved. The utility of RELP analyses of mtDNA segments as a
   toot to discriminate among red deer populations as well as to develop
   effective strategies for their conservation and management. (c) 2005

Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {The data were recorded during a Rabbit haemorrhagic disease outbreak
   that occurred in France in 2001 in a wild population of rabbits that we
   have been monitoring since 2000. These data suggested the existence of
   non-protective antibodies due to a putative RHDV-like virus. Twenty-one
   blood and 22 liver samples were taken from the 26 corpses of recently
   dead rabbits that were found. RHDV was found in all liver samples. A
   first screening for RHD antibodies, carried out using an ELISA based on
   the detection of VP60-RHDV antigen, showed that 20 of the rabbits were
   seropositive. Moreover, we determined antibody titres for 13 of these 20
   seropositive samples. All were greater than or equal to 1/400. Such
   titres normally indicate antibody levels sufficient to confer protection
   to all known RHDV or RHDV-like strains. For 16 samples, we determined
   whether these rabbits had died of a chronic or an acute form of the
   disease, by employing monoclonal antibody (Mabs)-based differential
   ELISA. All had died of an acute form of RHD. Because the antibodies
   detected by this VP60-ELISA test are known to appear 5-6 days after
   infection and since acute RHD generally kills the rabbits 2-3 days after
   infection, we assumed that the detected antibodies must have been
   present before the exposure to the virus that killed these rabbits. A
   second detection of antibodies was made with Mabs that are specific for
   RHDV. The results were negative, showing that the antibodies detected
   with the VP60 ELISA test were not specific for RHDV. We sequenced a
   portion of the VP60 gene of viruses isolated in 17 rabbits. All RHDV
   isolates were very similar to the RHDV strains commonly isolated in
   France during this period, suggesting that this viral strain was not a
   putative variant that is not neutralised by antibodies. Therefore we
   conclude that the detected antibodies were probably due to a RHDV-like
   virus that induces the production of detectable but non-protective
   antibodies.},

Abstract = {From December 2000 to January 2002, 109 specimens of sharpsnout seabream
   Diplodus puntazzo from a sea cage in the Gulf of Olbia (Sardinia,
   western Mediterranean) were examined for parasites. A total of five
   species were found: the myxosporeans Ceratomyxa diplodae and Enteromyxum
   leei, the monogeneans Lamellodiscus ignoratus and Atrispinum salpae and
   the crustacean Lernanthropus brevis. During the sampling two mortality
   outbreaks were recorded. The first was in winter 2001, with daily
   mortalities of 0.19\%-0.22\% (11.5\% cumulative), associated with high
   prevalence and intensity of A. salpae. The second took place during the
   summer-autumn period 2001, with daily mortalities of 0.25\%-0.34\% (25\%
   cumulative), associated with E. leei infections. The results showed that
   the success of netpen rearing of sharpsnout seabream is partly related
   to the absence of parasitic infections, particularly considering the
   pathogenicity of species such as E. leei and A. salpae, their direct

Abstract = {In order to find the antigen, which could induce the highest immune
   response in fish, different antigens were obtained from Lactococcus
   garvieae (also named Enterococcus seriolicida). Formalin-Killed Cells
   (FKC), Whole Membrane Extracts (WME) and Protein M-like (PM)
   preparations were obtained from the strain YT-3 (ATCC 49156) and
   injected i.p. three times into gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata L.).
   Twenty-two days after each injection, the agglutinating antibody titers
   and in vitro total blood phagocytosis of immunized and control fish were
   recorded.
   The results showed that FKC and PM preparations increased both antibody
   titers and phagocytosis in comparison to controls, while WME preparation
   was toxic to fish. Particularly, in PM-immunized fish, antibody titer
   and Phagocytosis Index rose in time. Moreover, the results suggested
   that in the cell wall matrix of L. garvieae is located a good immunogen
   and that Protein M could be suitable for a biotechnological sub-unit
   vaccine application. However, further studies are necessary before PM
   vaccine against lactococcosis/enterococcosis can be recommended in
   marine fish.},

Journal = {ANIMAL REPRODUCTION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Several Mycoplasma species may adversely affect bovine spermatozoa
   viability and embryo development. Mycoplasma mycoides ssp. mycoides
   large-colony (LC) has been isolated from naturally aborted bovine
   fetuses and from bull semen. The objective of this study was to evaluate
   whether M. mycoides ssp. mycoides LC contaminated bovine ejaculates
   could (i) impair in vitro fertilizing ability of bull spermatozoa, (ii)
   impair embryo development, and (iii) evaluate potential spread by
   reproductive technologies. In the present study, spermatozoa of 10
   fertile bulls were contaminated with M. mycoides ssp. mycoides LC, at a
   final concentration of 1.5 million CFU/ml and incubated for 60 min
   before evaluating spermatozoa motility and acrosome reaction
   inducibility with calcium ionophore. In addition, in vitro contaminated
   semen of a bull previously shown to have a good in vitro fertilizing
   ability, was used in an IVF procedure. Embryo development stage on Day-7
   of culture was evaluated. Spermatozoa and embryos at morula and
   blastocyst stages were routinely processed for transmission electron
   microscopy observation. Both mean total and progressive motility
   decreased (P < 0.01) upon spermatozoa incubation with Mycoplasma.
   One-hour incubation with calcium ionophore increased the percentage of
   acrosome-reacted spermatozoa, although Mycoplasma contamination reduced
   calcium ionophore treatment efficacy (P < 0.05). Ultrastructurally,
   Mycoplasma microorganisms appeared as moderately electron-dense
   sphere-shaped particles, adhering to cell membranes. Sperm mid-piece
   sections showed numeric aberrations of the central singlets such as nine
   + zero or nine + one of the axonemal complex. Further morphological
   abnormalities included partial or total absence of dinein arms and
   radial fibers, with lack of the bridge and the central ring in 35.00 +/-
   4.20\% of contaminated cells, whereas these abnormalities were not
   observed in uninfected ones. The IVF trials showed that two-four cell
   blocks were higher (P < 0.05) in the infected group. Ultrastructure of
   Day-7 contaminated embryos showed Mycoplasma particles adhering and
   infiltrating the outer layer of the zona pellucida. Our investigations
   suggest that M. mycoides ssp. mycoides LC contaminating the bovine
   ejaculate induced adverse effects on in vitro spermatozoa-fertilizing
   ability and embryonic development. Some satisfactory quality
   transferable embryos could be produced in contaminated IVF systems. This
   could imply a potential transmission of this microorganism through
   reproductive technologies. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A case of conjunctival lymphoma in a 4-year-old Siberian husky is
   reported. A large red mass protruding from the conjunctiva of the upper
   eyelid of the right eye was present. Irritation, blepharospasm and
   epiphora were revealed on initial ophthalmic examination. After
   anti-inflammatory treatment, surgery was performed. Histologically, the
   mass consisted of large polygonal cells with a high nucleus to cytoplasm
   ratio, moderate amounts of slightly eosinophilic cytoplasm, pleomorphic
   nuclei with vesicular chromatin and prominent multiple nucleoli. Mitotic
   figures were frequent. Approximately 70\% of the neoplastic cells were
   CD3 positive and CD79alpha negative. On the basis of histologic and
   immunohistochemical findings, a diagnosis of intermediate-grade, diffuse
   large-cell lymphoma with T-cell immunophenotype was made. The surgical
   area healed uneventfully and, although chemotherapy was not received,
   after 12 months the dog exhibited no recurrence. To the authors'
   knowledge, this is the first report of unicentric extranodal
   conjunctival lymphoma in a dog.},

Abstract = {In this work we present an in-house validation study for the
   confirmatory analysis of chloramphenicol (CAP) in muscle according to
   the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC requirements. CAP is extracted in
   acetonitrile and after liquid-liquid partitioning with n-hexane is
   identified and quantitatively determined by ion trap liquid
   chromatography/electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry
   (LC/ESI-MS/MS) analysis in the negative ion mode. CAP was identified
   using the precursor ion and at least two product ions, meeting the
   qualitative and quantitative criteria set by the European Commission in
   the Decision 2002/657/EC for confirmation of prohibited veterinary drug
   residues. We calculated mean drug recoveries, CC alpha and CC beta of
   the method, and reported data on specificity, ruggedness and
   within-laboratory reproducibility. Finally, we point out and discuss
   some problems and questions arising from controversy about the
   application of Decision 2002/657/ EC. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \&

   (serotype 4b, ATCC 19115) growth on vacuum-packaged horsemeat at
   refrigeration temperature, fourteen horsemeat surface/volume homogeneous
   150 g weight pieces were superficially inoculated with serotype 4b L.
   monocytogenes and vacuum packaged. The samples were stored at 4 +/- 1
   degreesC. Two pieces (one for pH determination and one for L.
   monocytogenes counts) were examined at days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42.
   Surface pH did not show significant variations during the experiment.
   The average L. monocytogenes initial contamination level was 1.77
   log(10) CFU/g. A lag phase of 7 days was recorded. The exponential
   growth rate between day 7 to day 35 was 0.125 log(10) CFU/day,
   corresponding to 3.51 log(10) CFU/g in 28 days. At the end of the

Abstract = {The present paper reports the clinical and neuropathological findings in
   two cats with a neuropathologically confirmed diagnosis of necrosis of
   the hippocampus and piriform lobe. The cats were presented because of
   acute onset of behavioural changes and complex partial seizures. The
   neurological examination suggested a forebrain lesion. The results of
   blood examination were within the normal range, and the cerebrospinal
   fluid (CSF) analysis and computed tomography (CT) scan in one cat did
   not show any abnormality. Despite therapy with diazepam (Valium(R);
   Roche) there was deterioration of the clinical signs and the cats were
   euthanased. The neuropathological examination revealed hippocampal
   necrosis that included the piriform lobe. (C) 2004 ESFM and AAFP.

Abstract = {The likelihood that milk and milk products may act as a vehicle for
   antibiotic-resistant bacterial genes has become a concern to the food
   industry and a public health issue, and the demand for rapid tests has
   increased. The purity of DNA extracted from food samples is a key issue
   in the sensitivity and usefulness of biological analyses, such as PCR
   for pathogens and nonpathogens. A rapid, phenol-chloroform free method
   based on a modification of a sodium iodide DNA extraction, followed by a
   two-step PCR was developed for direct detection of the tet(M) gene in
   milk samples within a single working day. This study compares the
   proposed method with a traditional phenol solvent extraction method and
   with a commercial kit (QIAamp DNA blood mini kit, Qiagen). The three DNA
   extraction methods were used to ensure access to the tet(M) gene from 1
   ml of raw milk, inoculated with a strain of Enterococcus faecalis, which
   carries the tet(M) gene. The proposed method, followed by a two-step PCR
   with nested primers specific for the tet(M) gene, was able to reach a
   detection limit below 10 CFU/ml in less than 4 h, including the two
   amplification cycles, thus outperforming in sensitivity and rapidity
   both the traditional and the commercial method.},

Abstract = {Deletion of megakaryocytic-specific regulatory sequences of GATA-1
   (Gata1(tm2Sho) or GATA-1(low) mutation) results in severe
   thrombocytopenia, because of defective thrombocytopoiesis, and
   myelofibrosis. As documented here, the GATA-1(low) mutation blocks
   megakaryocytic maturation between stage I and II, resulting in
   accumulation of defective megakaryocytes (MKS) in the tissues of
   GATA-1(low) mice. The block in maturation includes failure to properly
   organize a granules because von Willebrand factor is barely detectable
   in mutant MKS, and P-selectin, although normally expressed, is found
   frequently associated with the demarcation membrane system (DMS) instead
   of within granules. Conversely, both von Willebrand factor and
   P-selectin are barely detectable in GATA-1(low) platelets. Mutant MKS
   are surrounded by numerous myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils, some of
   which appear in the process to establish contact with MKS by fusing
   their membrane with those of the DMS. As a result, 16\% (in spleen) to
   34\% (in marrow) of GATA-1(low) MKS contain 1 to 3 neutrophils embedded
   in a vacuolated cytoplasm. The neutrophil-embedded GATA-1(low) MKS have
   morphologic features (high electron density and negativity to TUNEL
   staining) compatible with those of cells dying from para-apoptosis. We
   suggest that such an increased and pathologic neutrophil emperipolesis
   may represent one of the mechanisms leading to myelofibrosis by
   releasing fibrogenic MK cytokines and neutrophil proteases in the
   microenvironment. (C) 2004 by The American Society of Hematology.},

   and 22 mg fumonisin B1/kg, the calculated claim intake of fumonisin 131
   was similar to50 mug/kg bw before the first blood sampling and similar
   to500 mug/kg bw before the second blood sampling and slaughter. No
   hernatological changes were observed, while moderate adverse effects on
   liver function (ALT and cholesterol) and hepatocyte integrity were
   found. No histopathological alterations nor fumonisin residues were
   detected (LOD 5 mug/kg) in the kidneys. The levels of contamination had
   slight but observed effects on swine health. The lack of fumonisin 131
   carry-over to edible swine tissues was confirmed and under the studied

Title = {Changes during growth in the nutritive value of components of berseem
   clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.) under different cutting treatments in
   a Mediterranean region},
Journal = {GRASS AND FORAGE SCIENCE},

Volume = {59},

Abstract = {The nutritive value of berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.) may be
   influenced by changes in the nutrient concentrations of morphological
   fractions as a consequence of cutting treatment. The aim of this study
   was to evaluate the effects of different cutting treatments on the
   nutritive value of herbage and leaf and stem components in two
   Mediterranean berseem genotypes during growth in order to develop
   management approaches for harvesting forage with a high nutritive value.
   Spring growth of genotypes of Egyptian (cv. Giza 10) and Italian (cv.
   Sacromonte) origins was harvested in each of 2 years beginning 196 days
   after sowing and thereafter every 6 days (twelve harvests in total) to
   measure dry matter (DM) yield and nutritive value. Cutting treatments
   were initiated at sixth internode elongation (A) and early flowering (B)
   and there was an uncut control treatment (C). In vitro digestibility of
   organic matter (IVOMD) and crude protein (CP) concentration were
   determined for leaf, stem and total forage of each cultivar at each
   harvest. For both cultivars, in the uncut treatment (C), DM yield
   increased linearly to a maximum of 14 800 kg ha(-1), on average, by 250
   days after planting, the same time at which stem DM accumulation peaked,
   whereas the nutritive value, in terms of IVOMD and CP concentration,
   declined with age, coinciding with a reduction in leaf:stem ratio (LSR)
   from 1.00 to 0.30. Plant parts differed (P < 0.01) in nutritive value
   with stems being of lower nutritive value than leaves, in the two
   cutting treatments. There were strong positive correlations between LSR
   and herbage IVOMD and CP concentration, in both cutting treatments,
   indicating that, during growth, part of the changes in IVOMD and CP
   concentration of berseem clover plants was due primarily to the changes
   in the LSR. Defoliation induced a considerable reduction in DM yield,
   but an increase in the LSR and a small increase in nutritive value.
   Plants cut at the sixth internode elongation (A) showed a small
   proportional decrease (0.19) in total DM yield, but higher LSR values
   and similar or higher IVOMD and CP concentration than initiating cutting
   at early flower (B). Delaying defoliation to the early flowering stage
   (B) increased the proportion of stems and, therefore, decreased
   nutritive value. Therefore, harvest management in which cuts are applied
   at the stage of sixth internode elongation appears to be the most
   favourable for obtaining relatively high yields of forage with high
   nutritive value in berseem clover grown in Mediterranean regions.},

Abstract = {The affiliation. assessment and management of risks is a traditional
   part of veterinary medicine. In the past, veterinary services involved
   in this type of activity usually assessed risks qualitatively. However,
   since the 1990s, quantitative methods have become increasingly
   important. The establishment of the World Trade Organization in 1994,
   and the promulgation of its Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and
   Phytosanitary Measures (the ``SPS Agreement{''}) led to an increased
   application of import risk analysis and to significant improvements in
   the methodology of risk analysis as applied to international trade
   policy for animals and animal products. However, there was very little
   development of risk analysis in veterinary fields other than
   international trade and management of health risks to consumers of
   animal products and little has been published on its use in the choice
   and definition of control or prophylaxis strategies for animal diseases.
   This article describes a quantitative risk assessment, which was
   undertaken in Italy to help choose an appropriate national response
   strategy following an incursion of bluetongue, an infectious disease of
   sheep and goats. The results obtained in this study support the use of
   risk analysis as a tool to assist in choosing an appropriate animal
   disease management strategy. The use of risk analysis in the evaluation
   of disease management strategies also offers advantages in international
   trade. It makes easier the comparison of different strategies applied in
   the various countries, and thus facilitates the assessment of
   equivalence of the guarantees provided by different strategies.},

Abstract = {The current outbreaks of bluetongue (BT) disease in sheep in the central
   parts of the Mediterranean basin are being combated by extensive
   vaccination to control further spread of the virus and to suppress its
   long-term maintenance in the field. To be able to monitor the success of
   this campaign, and to be able to identify new foci of the disease, it is
   necessary to harness diagnostic methods, both rapid and sensitive, for
   differentiating reliably field from vaccine strains of bluetongue virus
   (BTV). A new method is described for their differentiation using
   fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) probes with real-time PCR.
   The method is based on the principle that the melting temperature of a
   DNA duplex gives information about the sequence, and allows even
   double-base alterations in the amplicon to be identified. The RT-PCR,
   the generation of melting curves, and fluorescence detection were all
   performed using the LightCycler system (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim,
   Germany). (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A study on the effect of rearing system on tissue composition of
   principal joints and chemical-physical traits of meat and subcutaneous
   fat, was carried out on a local pig breed. A total of 78 Nero Siciliano
   pigs was used; 41 pigs were reared in woods, 37 pigs were reared in pens
   and fed a commercial diet. Weight at slaughter was 101.9 and 88.2 kg for
   indoor and outdoor pigs, respectively. Means were estimated at 77 kg of
   live weight. At ham dissection outdoor-pigs showed higher percentages of
   lean (58\% vs. 55\%) and lower subcutaneous fat (31\% vs. 34\%). In
   Longissimus lumborum outdoor-pigs showed a higher intramuscular fat
   percentage (4.3\% vs. 3.3\%), a lower protein content (22.2\% vs.
   23.4\%), and higher free water (9.6 vs. 7.9 cm(2)). Outdoor pigs
   produced more light (L{*} = 50 vs. 46.7) and more yellow (b{*} = 5.84
   vs. 4.88) meat. Subcutaneous fat of outdoor pigs showed higher
   percentages of MUFA (53.3\% vs. 47.2\%) and lower percentages of PUFA
   (10.85\% vs. 14.45\%), no differences were found for n - 3 PUFA.
   Outdoor-pigs had lower atherogenicity (0.48 vs. 0.53) and
   thrombogenicity (1.03 vs. 1.21) indices. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Background. Fetal membranes are tissues of particular interest for
   several reasons, including their role in preventing rejection of the
   fetus and their early embryologic origin. which may entail progenitor
   potential. The immunologic reactivity and the transplantation potential
   of amnion and chorion cells, however, remain to be elucidated.
   Methods. Amnion and chorion cells were isolated from human term placenta
   and characterized by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometric analysis, and
   expression profile of relevant genes. The immunomodulatory
   characteristics of these cells were studied in allogeneic and xenogeneic
   mixed lymphocyte reactions and their engraftment potential analyzed by
   transplantation into neonatal swine and rats. Posttransplant chimerism
   was determined by polymerase chain reaction analysis with probes
   specific for human DNA.
   Results. Phenotypic and gene expression studies indicated mesenchymal
   stem cell-like profiles in both amnion and chorion cells that were
   positive for neuronal, pulmonary, adhesion, and migration markers. In
   addition, cells isolated both from amnion and chorion did not induce
   allogeneic nor xenogeneic lymphocyte proliferation responses and were
   able to actively suppress lymphocyte responsiveness. Transplantation in
   neonatal swine and rats resulted in human microchimerism in various
   organs and tissues.
   Conclusions. Human amnion and chorion cells from term placenta can
   successfully engraft neonatal swine and rats. These results may be
   explained by the peculiar immunologic characteristics and mesenchymal
   stem cell-like phenotype of these cells. These findings suggest that
   amnion and chorion cells may represent an advantageous source of
   progenitor cells with potential applications in a variety of cell
   therapy and transplantation procedures.},

Abstract = {An analytical procedure for the determination of natural steroids and

   Fifteen compounds (free and conjugated) after extraction by solid-phase
   were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
   (LC-MS-MS) in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). Free and conjugated
   steroids were detected all together in the same chromatographic analysis
   respectively in positive and negative ionization. This procedure reveals
   to be time-saving, because it overcomes the need of further sample
   pre-treatment steps, such as enzymatic hydrolysis and derivatisation.
   The recovery for each compound was around 80\%. Limit of detection of
   each steroid free or conjugated has been evaluated. (C) 2004 Elsevier

Abstract = {In this study, different types of tissue sampling for PCR-based
   diagnosis and follow-up of canine visceral leishmaniosis were compared.
   Skin, whole blood and lymph node samples were collected from 95
   naturally infected dogs living in South Italy, where the disease is
   endemic. Twenty-nine of these 95 dogs, treated with meglumine
   administered concurrently with allopurinol for 30 days, and then with
   allopurinol alone, were monitored during a period of 2 years. The DNA
   extracted from the clinical specimens was amplified by PCR using as
   target DNA a 116-bp fragment in the constant region of the kinetoplast
   DNA minicircle. PCR analysis was more sensitive than indirect
   immunofluorescence antibody test in detecting Leishmania infection in
   symptomatic dogs: 99\% of lymph node samples resulted positive, whereas
   94\% of blood samples and 95\% of skin samples gave a positive result.
   PCR analysis of samples from dogs followed up 2 years showed that: (1)
   all subjects resulted positive in at least one of the three types of
   samples; (2) all time the dogs had a relapse, PCR resulted positive in
   all three types of samples; (3) when dogs were apparently healthy, PCR
   analysis was positive on skin and lymph node samples, but not always on
   blood samples. Since lymph node sampling is invasive and sometimes
   difficult in healthy asymptomatic dogs, our results suggest that,
   independently from the presence or not of cutaneous lesions, skin biopsy
   represents a good substratum for PCR-based diagnosis and follow-up of
   canine visceral leishmaniosis. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Vascular amyloidosis in the brain is a pathological feature of ovine
   scrapie. Its occurrence varies between sheep, but whether this variation
   reflects differences in the host or the infecting scrapie strain (or
   both) is not clear. To investigate whether amyloidosis, like vacuolation
   and PrPsc distribution, is associated with genotype, the brains from 131
   sheep representing a range of genotypes commonly associated with scrapie
   were examined histologically and immunohistochemically. Vascular
   amyloidosis was absent in 66 sheep, 59 of which were of the ARQ/ARQ
   genotype and seven the ARQ/AHQ genotype. In contrast, it was found in
   four of 39 ARQ/VRQ sheep (10.2\%) and in 10 of 26 VRQ/VRQ sheep
   (38.4\%). The distribution of amyloid was highly variable, but the most
   severely affected areas were the lateral geniculate nuclei (five cases)
   and the ventral thalamic nuclei (four cases). No amyloidosis was found
   in the medulla or in the basal nuclei. From this preliminary study it
   was concluded that amyloidosis is relatively rare in sheep with scrapie.
   Moreover, its occurrence appeared to depend on the presence of at least
   one valine at codon 136. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Three commercially available assays, designed to specifically detect the
   presence of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) in fecal
   samples by IS900-PCR, were compared with a conventional culture method.
   Fecal samples from 100 dairy cows were tested. Fifty-four (67.5\%) of 80
   culture-positive samples were positive for an assay that detects MAP DNA
   by dot spot hybridization of polymerase chain reaction products (kit A),
   48 (60\%) were positive by an assay using ethidium bromide staining for
   agar gel visualization of amplification products (kit B), and 49
   (61.3\%) were positive by an assay in which amplified products are
   detected by a colorimetric detection system (kit C). Relative
   sensitivity of all tests increased in proportion to the presence of MAP

Abstract = {Silymarin, the standardized extract of Silybum marianum, is used as a
   hepatoprotector in man, and is a potent antihepatotoxic agent. This
   study focused on the effects of a silymarin-phospholipid complex in
   reducing the toxic effects of aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) in broiler
   chickens. Twenty-one 14-d-old male commercial broilers were randomly
   allotted to 3 groups and treated as follows: basal diet alone {[}Group C
   (Control)]; AFB(1) at 0.8 mg/kg of feed {[}Group 131]; AFB(1) at 0.8
   mg/kg of feed plus silymarin phytosome, a silymarin complexed form with
   phospholipids from soy, at 600 mg/kg of BW {[}Group B-1+Sil].
   Considering the whole growth cycle, BW gain and feed intake were lower
   in AFB(1)-treated birds with respect to controls (P < 0.05). In the
   B-1+Sil group, BW gain and feed intake were higher with respect to birds
   receiving AFB(1) alone (P < 0.05), and not different from the control
   birds. Serum biochemistry showed no difference among groups, except for
   a decrease of alanine amino transferase (ALT) in chicks treated only
   with AFB(1). Alanine amino transferase activity in AFB(1) plus silymarin
   phytosome treated birds was not different from the controls. No
   treatment differences were noted on liver weight. In conclusion, our
   results suggest that silymarin phytosome can provide protection against
   the negative effects of AFB1 on performance of broiler chicks.},

Abstract = {Capreomycin (CS) is an antitubercular drug active against several
   Mycobacterium strains, in particular, against M. Avium. In spite of its
   activity, it is considered a second line drug because it can induce
   severe renal and hepatic damages when administered as free drug.
   However, it is possible to employ drug delivery systems, such as
   liposomes, to reduce the toxicity of the peptide without loss of its
   biological activity. For this purpose, appropriately validated time and
   money saving analytical methods are needed for a careful capreomycin
   dosage.
   In the present paper, UV spectroscopy and a reverse-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC)
   were investigated as alternative methods for capreomycin quantitative
   analysis. These techniques were validated against the USP XXVI
   microbiological turbidimetric assay and the normal-phase HPLC (NP-HPLC)
   method reported in the British Pharmacopoeia 2003. The results obtained
   showed that either UV spectrophotometry or RP-HPLC are techniques having
   higher accuracy and reproducibility with respect to the microbiological
   assay. Moreover, the RP-HPLC method provided improved performances if
   compared to NP-HPLC. In fact, RP-HPLC showed: (i) enhanced sensitivity
   and (ii) increased resolution. Thus we propose RP-HPLC and UV as valid
   alternative methods to the conventional procedures for capreomycin
   quantitative analysis. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The precision and robustness of published protocols for disc diffusion

Month = {OCT 27},
Abstract = {The precision of the disc diffusion protocols previously published by
   Alderman and Smith (Aquaculture 196 (2002) 211) was analysed in a
   seven-laboratory trial using Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 as the test
   strain. Discs containing seven antimicrobial agents were employed and
   2899 zone size measurements were generated. The total data generated in
   the trial was used to quantify the intra- and inter-laboratory
   precisions. The study design also facilitated the investigation of the
   influence of the source of media and the source of discs on zone sizes.
   A smaller two-laboratory trial was employed to investigate the influence
   of incubation time of zone size.
   The intra-laboratory precision was relatively high with the mean of the
   coefficients of variation calculated for each laboratory and each agent
   being 4.7\%. In contrast, the inter-laboratory precision was very much
   lower with the mean of the values for each agent being 11.1\%.
   Significant influences on zone size were detected for all three
   parameters of the protocol. Media source effects were particularly
   notable with respect to oxytetracycline and oxolinic acid discs, disc
   source effects with respect to ampicillin and
   sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim discs and incubation times with the
   ampicillin and amoxycillin discs. ANOVA analysis of the total data set
   confirmed that inter-laboratory variation was the major factor
   influencing the low precision of the protocol.
   The overall precision of the protocols used here was found to be
   significantly lower than that implied by the control limits associated
   with the same bacterium in other validated disc diffusion protocols. The
   implications of these results, for the further development of the
   protocols under investigation, are discussed. (C) 2004 Published by

Abstract = {The tetracycline resistance (tet) gene patterns of 52 tetracycline
   resistant Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica (S.) serovar Typhimurium
   isolates collected from animals, food of animal origin, and humans in
   Italy, were investigated to evaluate whether the ter gene patterns could
   be used for strain differentiation in addition to phage typing and
   ribotyping. The detection of tet genes was performed by specific PCR
   assays. Ribotyping was performed automatically using PvuII as
   restriction enzyme. Ten different ribotyping patterns were detected. All
   isolates were positive for at least one of the tet genes studied and six
   different tet gene patterns were observed. Ribotyping and tet gene
   patterns showed discriminatory indices of 0.741 and 0.812, respectively.
   Multiple tet genes were commonly found among tetracycline resistant S.
   typhimurium isolates from various sources. The resulting tet gene
   patterns allowed further discrimination of strains which were otherwise
   indistinguishable by their phage type, ribotype and origin. Thus, the
   analysis of tet gene patterns might represent an additional tool for the
   differentiation of S. typhimurium isolates. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Frequencies of polymorphisms at codons 136, 154 and 171 of the prion
   protein (PrP) gene were studied in 1207 pure-bred and cross-bred Italian
   Biellese rams, a small ovine breed of about 65 000 head in Italy. Aside
   from the five most common alleles (VRQ, ARQ, ARR, AHQ and ARH), the rare
   ARK allele was also found, with the highest frequency reported so far in
   an ovine breed (2(.)5\%). ARK/--- genotypes had a total frequency of
   4(.)9\%. The resistance-associated ARR allele was seen at a low
   frequency (8(.)3\%). Only 1(.)4\% of animals examined had a resistant
   ARR/ARR PrP genotype. Semi-resistant (ARR/ARQ, ARR/ARH and ARR/AHQ) PrP
   genotypes had a total frequency of 12(.)6\% and PrP genotypes that are
   associated with high scrapie susceptibility (e.g. VRQ/VRQ and ARQ/ARQ)
   had a total frequency of 81(.)1\%. Statistical analysis comparing PrP
   allele frequencies between pure-bred and cross-bred animals showed that
   the ARR allele occurred at a significantly lower frequency in pure-bred
   rams. Furthermore, comparison of PrP allele frequencies between
   pure-bred rams over 18 months of age and those below 18 months of age
   showed a significant decrease in the ARR allele in breeding rams over 18
   months of age. Based on these results, breeding for scrapie resistance
   in the Biellese breed will have to take into account the low frequency
   of the ARR allele, which also seems to be subject to negative selection
   by farmers. Further investigation is required to understand whether the
   ARK allele is also associated with resistance to transmissible
   spongiform encephalopathies.},

Abstract = {Two nucleic acid-based methods for rapid and sensitive detection of the
   foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes in milk were developed in this
   study. These methods rely on paramagnetic nanoparticle-based isolation
   of bacterial DNA directly from milk and subsequent PCR with selective
   primers for the listeriolysin O (hlyA) gene. The hlyA specific product
   was reproducibly detected and showed a sensitivity of 10 cfu ml(-1). The
   magnetic-based system had a sensitivity 10-fold higher than that of
   commercially available column devices. The detection limit of both
   methods is sufficient for direct detection of L. monocytogenes DNA in
   milk avoiding the enrichment culturing step, reducing the time necessary
   to obtain results from samples to 7 h rather than the 5-day minimum
   required for the standard procedure. The methods developed are suitable
   for automation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The systematic search by tandem mass spectrometry of human saliva from
   four different subjects, of 136 possible fragments originated from
   histatin 3, allowed the detection of 24 different peptides. They
   include, with the exception of histatin 4, all the known histatin 3
   fragments, namely histatins 5-12 and the peptides corresponding to
   15-24, 26-32, 29-32 residues, and 13 new fragments corresponding to
   1-11, 1-12, 1-13, 5-13, 6-11, 6-13, 7-11, 7-12, 7-13, 14-24, 14-25,
   15-25, and 28-32 residues of histatin 3. On the contrary, none of 119
   possible fragments of histatin 1, including histatin 2, was detected.
   The results suggest that the genesis of histatin 3-related peptides,
   being under the principal action of trypsin-like activities, is probably
   not a random process but rather follows a sequential fragmentation
   pathway. Lack of detection of C-terminal fragments, with the exception
   of 26-32, 28-32, and 29-32 fragments, suggested that arginine 25 should
   be the first cleavage site, generating histatin 6 and 26-32 fragments.
   The genesis of 28-32 and 29-32 fragments and histatin 5 should implicate
   a subsequent exo-protease action. Similarly, lack of detection of
   fragments having Lys-5 and Arg-6 at the N terminus and Arg-25 at the C
   terminus strongly suggested that sequences KRKF (11-14 residues) and AKR
   (4-6 residues) should be the second and the third cleavage sites,
   respectively. Lys-17 and Arg-22 are not cleaved at all.},

Abstract = {A total of 3879 samples of foodstuffs were examined for the presence of
   Verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli O157 (VTEC O157). The survey
   was conducted by 9 of the 10 Italian Veterinary Public Health
   Laboratories. Samples were collected between May 2000 and September 2001
   in 14 regions and comprised 931 minced beef specimens and 2948 dairy
   products (DP) with less than 60 days of ripening. The DP included 657
   pasteurised and 811 unpasteurised bovine DP, 477 pasteurised and 502
   unpasteurised ovine DP, and 501 water-buffalo's milk mozzarella cheese.
   Samples were collected at retail level, from plants processing minced
   beef and dairy plants and from farms directly manufacturing cheeses. All
   the samples were tested using a sensitive procedure based on ISO/DIS
   16654:1999 (later ISO 16654:2001), which includes an immunomagnetic
   separation step. A preliminary inter-laboratory trial was organised with
   artificially contaminated samples to assess the ability of all the
   participating laboratories to isolate E. coli O157 by the established
   procedure.
   VTEC O157 was isolated from four (0.43\%) of the minced beef samples,
   collected in four different regions and during different months, but was
   not detected in any of the dairy products. E. coli O157 VT(-)eae(+) was
   isolated from one raw cow's milk cheese. This survey provided national
   data on the presence of VTEC O157 in foodstuffs, demonstrating a low
   prevalence of the organism. The survey also encouraged updating of
   knowledge and procedures on VTEC O157 in laboratories with official
   responsibility for microbiological testing of foods of animal origin.

Abstract = {A survey was conducted of Vibrio spp., Escherichia coli, fecal
   coliforms, and Salmonella in 644 molluscan shellfish samples marketed in
   the Apulia region of southern Italy. Vibrios were found in 278 samples
   (43\%), and levels of E. coli and fecal coliforms were above the Italian
   legal limit in 27 and 34 samples (4 and 5\%), respectively. Salmonella
   was not detected in any of the samples. Because the majority of the
   vibrio isolates were found in samples that were compliant with Italian
   regulations, there appears to be no relationship between the presence of
   microorganisms of fecal origin and the presence of vibrios potentially
   harmful to human health.},

Abstract = {Mercuric chloride (HgCl2) induces acute renal failure associated to
   tubular impairment in experimental animals and humans. Stress proteins
   are a superfamily of proteins, comprising heat-shock proteins (HSP) and
   glucose-regulated proteins (GRP), enhanced or induced in the kidney in
   response to stress. They act as molecular chaperones that protect
   organelles and repair essential proteins which have been denatured
   during adverse conditions. The involvement of stress proteins in
   mercury-nephrotoxicity has not yet been well clarified. This study was
   undertaken to detect the tubular distribution of four stress proteins
   (HSP25, HSP60, GRP75, HSP72) in the rat kidney injected with HgCl2 and
   to quantify lysosomal and mitochondrial changes in straight proximal
   tubules, the main mercury target. Sprague-Dawley rats were administered
   i.p. with progressive sublethal doses of HgCl2 (0.25 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 1
   mg/kg and 3.5 mg/kg) or saline (as controls) and sacrificed after 24 h.
   In dosages over 0.50 mg/kg, stress proteins increased and changed
   localization in a dose-dependent manner. HSP25 was focally expressed in
   altered proximal tubules at I mg/kg but in the macula densa it was at
   3.5 mg/kg. HSP60 and GRP75 were intense in the nucleus and cytoplasm of
   proximal tubules but moderate in distal tubules. HSP72 was induced in
   distal tubules after low exposures but in proximal tubules it happened
   at the highest dose. Moreover, a significant increase in lysosomal and
   total mitochondria (normal and with broken cristae) area and density
   were progressively found after HgCl2 treatments. Stress proteins could
   represent sensitive biomarkers that strongly correlate with the degree
   of oxidative injury induced by HgCl2 in the rat proximal tubules.},

Abstract = {A new formulation for topical administration of drugs in the oral cavity
   has been developed using several film-forming and mucoadhesive polymers.
   The films have been evaluated in terms of swelling, mucoadhesion and
   organoleptic characteristics. The best film, containing
   polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as film-forming polymer and
   carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt (NaCMC) as mucoadhesive polymer, was
   loaded with ibuprofen as a model compound and in vitro and in vivo
   release studies were performed. Statistical investigation of in vitro
   release revealed that the diffusion process was the main drug release
   mechanism and the Higuchi's model provided the best fit. In vivo studies
   showed the presence of ibuprofen in saliva (range 70-210 mug/ml) for 5 h
   and no irritation was observed. These mucoadhesive formulations offer
   many advantages in comparison to traditional treatments and can be
   proposed as a new therapeutic tool against dental and buccal diseases
   and disturbs. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is still a zoonotic problem in the world.
   Despite the fact that eradication programs for bovine TB are being
   implemented in many countries, it remains a public health problem. These
   programs are mainly based on a single intradermal tuberculin test using
   bovine tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD), isolation, and
   slaughtering of infected animals. The aim of this study was to assess
   the specificity of the gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) test in TB-free
   cattle herds, by using not only Australian tuberculins but also
   tuberculins produced at our institute, and to correlate the response
   with the type of production (beef cattle, dairy cattle, and a
   dual-purpose breed), the housing system, and the age of the animals. We
   studied 800 animals selected from 20 TB- and paratuberculosis-free
   herds. The animals were tested in parallel, after stimulation with
   Australian tuberculins and tuberculins produced at our institute, by
   using the skin test and two IFN-gamma assays. The results of this trial
   showed that the specificity of the IFN-gamma test is higher than that of
   the skin test (96.8\%) and ranges from 97.3\% (using only Australian
   tuberculins) to 98.6\% (using tuberculins produced at our institute). We
   found that different categories of cattle could influence the
   specificity of the skin test but that these differences tended to be
   reduced in the IFN-gamma assay, especially when Italian PPDs were used.},

Title = {The use of bovine serum albumin as a ligand in affinity chromatographic
   clean-up of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs from bovine plasma},
Journal = {CHROMATOGRAPHIA},

Volume = {60},
Number = {5-6},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The European Union regulates the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
   drugs (NSAID) in animal production and official national analytical
   monitoring programmes have been set up in each member state to detect
   residues of the drugs in bovine plasma. In this work, we describe the
   development and application of affinity chromatography for molecular
   recognition of NSAID in bovine plasma. Bovine serum albumin (BSA), the
   plasma protein which binds such drugs, was covalently bound to a
   polymeric support via its glycosyl moieties. Loading capacities and
   specificity were tested both on standard solutions and on spiked bovine
   plasma for nine drugs-ketoprofen, naproxen, phenylbutazone,
   oxyphenylbutazone, acetylsalicylic acid, salicylic acid, tolfenamic
   acid, diclofenac, and nimesulide-chosen as being the most representative
   of the different chemical sub-classes of NSAID. The BSA columns could
   bind up to 150 x 10(-6) g total of a mixture of these nine NSAID, with
   mean recoveries ranging from 74.0\% (tolfenamic acid) to 96.0\%
   (nimesulide). HPLC separation on an RP C-18 column with a linear
   gradient enabled resolution of the drugs; identification was achieved by
   coupling with photodiode array detection (DAD) operated at 240 and 280
   nm. Results showed that all the compounds except acetylsalicylic acid
   were bound effectively by the BSA affinity columns. When plasma samples
   were spiked at 2.5 mug mL(-1) with a mixture of the NSAID the
   chromatographic profile and UV spectra recorded (in the range 220-350
   nm) indicated the procedure was sufficiently selective for
   identification of the drugs at the concentrations expected according to
   their pharmacokinetics. No memory effects and matrix interferences were
   observed.},

Abstract = {Forty-eight Simmental young bulls (initial body weight = 321.2 +/- 34.1
   kg) were assigned to eight balanced groups reared in separate pens with
   a space allowance of 3 m(2) per head. Two different manger spaces (60
   vs. 80 cm per head) were tested in factorial arrangement with the type
   of floor of the pen (slatted vs. straw bedded). All the animals received
   the same diet provided ad libitum. No significant interaction was found
   between the two main factors considered in the study. Manger space did
   not affect bulls' daily gain, feed intake and feed efficiency. Health
   status of the animals was satisfactory and the neutrophil/ lympocite
   ratio, blood indicator of chronic stress, was not modified by the
   different manger space. Behavioural observations showed no differences
   due to manger space. Regardless of the manger space, the ad libitum
   feeding promoted a high turnover of the bulls in the feeding area
   limiting the number of animals eating at same time. Bulls were
   slaughtered at 614.6 +/- 14.7 kg and carcass traits and meat quality
   were not affected by manger space. Regardless of the type of floor, a
   space at the manger of 60 cm per head should be sufficient for beef
   cattle fed ad libitum under intensive rearing system. (C) 2004 Elsevier

Abstract = {The influence of litter size and sex on meat quality traits was
   investigated using 40 Nebrodi kids slaughtered at 47 days of age.
   Carcass measurements (body components, carcass joints, pelvic limb
   tissue composition, meat fatty acid composition and M. longissimus dorsi
   (LD) colour), body weight at birth and at slaughter were evaluated.
   Nebrodi kids had a low body weight at birth, with significant
   differences between male and female (4.1 kg versus 3.9 kg) and between
   single and twin (4.2 kg versus 3.8 kg). Male kids were heavier at birth
   and at slaughter, however, females had a higher percentage of kidney and
   pelvic fat (2.1\% versus 1.5\% of the right side; P < 0.01). Both males
   and females, on the contrary, were similar in fat percentage for pelvic
   limb (11.4\% versus 11.6\%) and chemical composition of meat (5.1\%
   versus 4.9\%). The fatty acid composition of fat in the pelvic limb was
   not influenced by the animals' sex, but single kids presented higher
   polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) than twin kids (5.7 g versus 5.4
   g/100 g of meat fat; P < 0.05). Physical characteristics and
   colorimetric parameters of longissimus dorsi muscle were not influenced
   by sex and litter size. Female kids showed a significantly higher
   cooking loss (16.5\% versus 14.9\%) and lower pH than male kids (5.5
   versus 5.69); twin kids showed light coloured meat than single kids
   (51.8 versus 49.3; P < 0.01). The meat of Nebrodi kids has desirable
   qualitative characteristics and, on the basis of this it is possible to
   consider it to be of high quality. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {A method for the simultaneous LC-fluorescence detection (FLD)
   determination of eight trichothecenes A and B by pre-column
   derivatization with coumarin-3-carbonyl chloride, a highly fluorescent
   fluorophore, has been developed. The reaction conditions (temperature,
   reaction time, reactant ratios) were optimized to give a reproducible
   quantitative conversion. All derivatives were characterized by LC-MS.
   The chromatographic parameters were optimized (column, eluent) to give a
   very good separation of three type A (diacetoxyscirpenol, T-2 toxin,
   HT-2 toxin) and five type B trichothecenes {[}deoxynivalenol (DON),
   nivalenol, fusarenon-X, 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol,
   15-acetyldeoxynivalenol]. The best conditions were obtained on a
   narrow-bore C-18 column with a water-methanol gradient. The detection
   limits (S/N = 3:1) in grain samples, with an injected volume of 5 mul,
   were 0.2-1 ng/g for all trichothecenes. These values are more than one
   order of magnitude lower than those of other LC-FLD and LC-MS methods
   and are similar to those obtained by GC-MS. The calibration curves were
   linear between 100 and 2500 ng/g. The method was successfully applied to
   the analysis of a certified wheat reference material, after solvent
   extraction and clean-up on a Mycosep column, obtaining a good recovery
   (89\% for DON) and a high accuracy (z-score value: 0.67). (C) 2004

Abstract = {A liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric (HPLC-MS/MS) method
   is proposed for the identification and quantification of tylosin in
   honey. Sample treatment involves an extraction in a Tris buffer at pH
   10.5, followed by a solid-phase clean up step on an Oasis HLB column.
   Roxithromycin was used as the internal standard. Chromatographic
   separation of tylosin and roxithromycin was performed on an XTerra MS
   C-18 column (100 mm x 2.1 mm i.d., 5 mum) using a gradient of aqueous
   0.01 M ammonium acetate pH 3.5 and acetonitrile as the mobile phase, at
   a flow rate of 0.25 ml min(-1). The method was validated according to
   the guidelines laid down by the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. Tylosin
   residues were confirmed by MS/MS experiments considering the appropriate
   identification points. All validation parameters such as Ccalpha (lower
   than 3 ng g(-1)), Ccbeta (lower than 5 ng g(-1)), recovery and precision
   were assessed on the basis of the ``critical ion{''} (less intense ion
   permitting unambiguous identification of the analyte). (C) 2004 Elsevier

Abstract = {We evaluated the efficacy of enrofloxacin, alone or combined with
   metronidazole, against Leishmania infantum. The in vitro activity of
   this fluoroquinolone was assessed using two different methods: a direct
   test aimed at assessing the drug activity on the parasite, and an
   indirect test aimed at evaluating the drug effect on macrophage killing,
   lymphomonocyte activation and nitric oxide production. An in vivo test
   was also performed on 36 dogs with leishmaniasis, subdivided into three
   groups, one treated with enrofloxacin, another with enrofloxacin plus
   metronidazole, and a control group with meglumine antimoniate. The
   direct test did not show any action of enrofloxacin on the parasite,
   while the indirect testing showed an enhancement of macrophage killing
   and an increase in nitric oxide production. These findings show that
   enrofloxacin does not exert a direct anti-leishmanial activity in vitro.
   However, on the basis of the positive immunostimulation results shown in
   vitro and the clinical improvement, particularly of the cutaneous
   lesions, obtained in several dogs in the in vivo trial, the use of
   enrofloxacin in association with a specific anti-leishmanial drug can be
   proposed in the therapeutic protocol of canine leishmaniasis.},

Abstract = {This paper reviews the worldwide situation regarding avian influenza
   infections in poultry from 1997 to March 2004. The increase in the
   number of primary introductions and the scientific data available on the
   molecular basis of pathogenicity have generated concerns particularly
   for legislative purposes and for international trade. This has led to a
   new proposed definition of `avian influenza' to extend all infections
   caused by H5 and H7 viruses regardless of their virulence as notifiable
   diseases, although this has encountered some difficulties in being
   approved.
   The paper also reviews the major outbreaks caused by viruses of the H5
   or H7 subtype and the control measures applied. The zoonotic aspects of
   avian influenza, which until 1997 were considered to be of limited
   relevance in human medicine, are also discussed. The human health
   implications have now gained importance, both for illness and fatalities
   that have occurred following natural infection with avian viruses, and
   for the potential of generating a reassortant virus that could give rise
   to the next human influenza pandemic.},

Abstract = {The present paper reports of the comparison between three rapid virus
   detection systems and virus isolation (VI) from pooled tracheal swabs
   collected from naturally and experimentally infected birds with a low
   pathogenicity avian influenza virus of the H7N3 subtype. The relative
   sensitivity, specificity and agreement (K value) were calculated for a
   commercial antigen capture enzyme immunoassay (AC-EIA) and for two
   nucleic acid detection tests, a one-step reverse
   transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and a real-time RT-PCR
   (RRT-PCR), both targeting the M gene. The results indicate that in
   experimentally infected turkeys VI was positive from the pooled tracheal
   swabs collected from day 3 to day 10. One-step RT-PCR was able to detect
   influenza RNA from samples collected from day 3 to day 12, while RRT-PCR
   amplified influenza RNA in swabs collected from day 3 to day 15. The
   AC-EIA test yielded positive results between day 5 and day 10
   post-infection. On field samples, the K value between the AC-EIA and VI
   tests was 0.82. Compared with VI, the relative sensitivity of this test
   was 88.9\% (CI95 = 85.2-92.6) and the relative specificity was 95.7\%
   (CI95 = 93.7- 97.7). The K value between the RT-PCR and VI tests was
   0.88. Compared with virus isolation, the relative sensitivity of the
   one-step RT-PCR was 95.6\% (CI95 = 93.1-98.0) and the relative
   specificity was 96.3\% (CI95 = 94.4-98.1). The K value between the
   RRT-PCR and VI tests was 0.92. Compared with virus isolation, the
   relative sensitivity and specificity of RRT-PCR was 93.3\% (CI95 =
   90.4-96.3) and 98.4\% (CI95 = 97.2-99.6), respectively. Generally
   speaking, comparison between virus isolation, the AC-EIA test and the
   two nucleic acid detection methods indicated excellent agreement. Data
   obtained from both experimental and field study suggest a higher
   sensitivity of the PCR-based methods compared with the AC-EIA. The
   economical and practical implications of using one of the rapid tests as
   an alternative to VI during an avian influenza epidemic are discussed.},

Abstract = {In the 1990s EEC countries drafted several directives concerning the
   aquaculture sector, including Directive 91/67/EEC of 28.01.1991
   (accepted into Italy by DPR n. 555 on 10.12.1992) and Directive 95/70/EC
   from 22.12.1995 (accepted into Italy by DPR n. 395 on 20.10.1998). DPR
   555 includes among its provisions a list of the diseases that are so
   serious for production that they must be eradicated from the EEC
   territory (Annex A, List I), as well as a list of other diseases that
   also affect production (Annex A, List II).
   Annex A, List II of DPR 555, includes two mollusc diseases, namely
   Bonamiosis and Marteiliosis for flat oysters (Ostrea edulis). DPR 395
   includes among its provisions that farm owners register their farm with
   the National Health Service and possess a loading and unloading register
   of the material introduced from or destined for another farm for
   reintroduction.
   When the National Health Service finds a case of unusual death in the
   wild or in farms, it will apply a sanitary monitoring programme to
   ascertain or exclude the presence of the diseases included in Annex A to
   91/67/EEC or Annex D to 95/70/EC as the cause of death. On February 5th
   2003 the EU Commission modified Annex D (2003/83/EC).},

Abstract = {The aim of this work was to investigate the secretion of
   dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone
   (DHT) and oestradiol (E) as biological markers in response to illegal
   administration of testosterone, 19-nortestosterone (N) and oestradiol,
   either alone or in combination. Twenty male Friesian calves (age 13-14
   months) were allotted to a control group (n=5), and five experimental
   groups (n=3) each. Each experimental animal was repeatedly injected with
   one of the following hormonal treatments: E, T, N, T+E and N+E.
   Circulating DHEA, T, DHT and E were determined by radioimmunoassay. The
   administration of T alone did not induce any variation in plasma DHEA,
   T, DHT and E, which were similar to those in the control group. In
   contrast, DHEA, T and DHT were on average significantly lower in the T+E
   and N-treated groups (p<0.01), whereas the administration of N+E
   resulted in the reduction of plasma T and DHT without any modification
   of plasma DHEA. The administration of E alone or in combination
   increased circulating levels of E but did not affect androgen plasma
   profiles. The results indicate that plasma levels of T do not permit
   detection of illegal treatments because plasma androgens always remained
   within the physiological range. Illegal E treatment could be detected in
   blood samples when they were collected at least every 20 days.},

Abstract = {In order to investigate the genotypes of Giardia duodenalis from
   domestic and farm animals in Italy, 21 Giardia isolates, 17 from dogs, 1
   from cat and 3 from dairy calves, were genetically characterised by
   SSU-rRNA gene sequencing. Among dogs, 76.5\% of isolates showed the
   dog-specific genotypes (Assemblages C, D and C/D mixed Assemblage) and
   23.5\% exhibit potential zoonotic genotypes (Assemblage A and A/C mixed
   Assemblages). The cat isolate belonged to assemblage A, whereas the
   sequences among the isolates from calves were found to correspond to
   hoofed-livestock genotype, namely Assemblage E. These findings suggest
   that infection of humans by zoonotic genotypes from domestic animals
   could be of low epidemiological significance, although possible. The
   present study represents the first contribute to the knowledge of G.
   duodenalis genotypes in domestic and farm animals from Italy. (C) 2004

Abstract = {Recent devastating outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Europe
   have reopened the discussion about the adequacy of the non-vaccination
   strategy implemented by the EU in 1991. Here we describe the evaluation
   of a new commercially available test kit for the discrimination between
   vaccination and infection. The test is based on the detection of
   antibodies against the recombinant non-structural (NS) protein 3ABC. In
   contrast to immunization with vaccines free of 3ABC, these antibodies
   are elicited as a consequence of infection. Testing more than 3600
   negative sera from several countries revealed a specificity of >99\% for
   bovine, ovine, and porcine samples. Antibodies specific for 3ABC can be
   detected as soon as 10 days post-infection. As compared with the
   occurrence of antibodies against structural proteins of FMDV, anti-3ABC
   antibodies can be detected 5-10 days later, depending on the species. No
   anti-3ABC antibodies were detected in sera from vaccination experiments
   or in field sera from vaccinated animals. However, anti-3ABC antibodies
   can be detected in vaccinated animals upon challenge. These results
   provide evidence that this test can facilitate the use of vaccines in
   new strategies against FMD. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The horizontal transfer and acquisition of virulence genes via mobile
   genetic elements have been a major driving force in the evolution of
   Salmonella pathogenicity. Serovars of Salmonella enterica carry variable
   assortments of phage-encoded virulence genes, suggesting that temperate
   phages play a pivotal role in this process. Epidemic isolates of S.
   enterica serovar Typhimurium are consistently lysogenic for two lambdoid
   phages, Gifsy-1 and Gifsy-2, carrying known virulence genes. Other
   serovars of S. enterica, including serovars Dublin, Gallinarum,
   Enteritidis, and Hadar, carry distinct prophages with similarity to the
   Gifsy phages. In this study, we analyzed Gifsy-related loci from S.
   enterica serovar Abortusovis, a pathogen associated exclusively with
   ovine infection. A cryptic prophage, closely related to serovar
   Typhimurium phage Gifsy-2, was identified. This element, named
   Gifsy-2AO, was shown to contribute to serovar Abortusovis systemic
   infection in lambs. Sequence analysis of the prophage b region showed a
   large deletion which covers genes encoding phage tail fiber proteins and
   putative virulence factors, including type III secreted effector protein
   SseI (GtgB, SrfH). This deletion was identified in most of the serovar
   Abortusovis isolates tested and might be dependent on the replicative
   transposition of an adjacent insertion sequence, IS1414, previously
   identified in pathogenic Escherichia coli strains. IS1414 encodes
   heat-stable toxin EAST1 (astA) and showed multiple genomic copies in
   isolates of serovar Abortusovis. To our knowledge, this is the first
   evidence of intergeneric transfer of virulence genes via insertion
   sequence elements in Salmonella. The acquisition of IS1414 (EAST1) and
   its frequent transposition within the chromosome might improve the
   fitness of serovar Abortusovis within its narrow ecological niche.},

Abstract = {Between September 2001 to June 2002, 145 samples of bovine caecal
   content were collected at slaughter for verocytotoxin-producing
   Escherichia coli (VTEC) serogroups O157 and non-O157 detection. For E.
   coli O157 the immunomagnetic-separation technique was performed. The
   entero-haemolytic phenotype was the target for non-O157 VTEC
   identification. The vero cell assay (VCA) as performed for toxic
   activity detection. The genomic sequence for VT1, VT2 and intimin (vt1,
   vt2, eae genes) were identified by PCR analysis.
   Eight VTEC O157 and eight non-O157 VTEC isolates were detected. VTEC
   O157, eae-positive strains were shed by 9.7\% of feedlot cattle and by
   2.5\% of dairy cows. Non-O157 VTEC, eae-negative isolates were detected
   in the intestinal content of 12.5\% dairy cows and of 2.1\% feedlot lot
   cattle. VTEC-shedding cattle came front 18.1\% of the farms included in
   the study. From cattle faeces, VTEC O91:H- (VT2-positive, eae-negative),
   responsible of human diarrhoeal disease in Europe, was recovered. Other
   VTEC serogroups identified in the present study were O74, O109, O110,
   O116, and O117.},

Abstract = {A model interlaboratory testing scheme was developed by the Italian
   National Reference Laboratory for Brucellosis. This scheme was planned
   for both qualitative (Rose Bengal Plate Test; RBPT) and quantitative
   (Complement Fixation Test; CFT) serological tests and involved a total
   of 42 laboratories. In the preparation of this scheme, reference was
   made to general protocols and guidelines and to methods reported in the
   literature, which were applicable to analytical chemistry laboratories.
   Six field sera from naturally infected animals, one positive serum at a
   titer below the European Union (EU) positivity threshold, and 5 sera
   positive at titers between 20 and 851 International Units of Complement
   Fixation Test (IUCFT)/mL plus one negative serum were used to produce a
   panel of test sera. To evaluate laboratory performances in the
   quantitative test for each tested sample examined, z-scores based on
   robust summary statistics (the median and normalized interquartile
   range) were used. To evaluate overall laboratory performance, 2 types of
   combined z-scores were used: Rescaled Sum of Scores and Sum of Squared
   Scores. In the case of the qualitative test (RBPT), results were
   analyzed by a Bayesian approach. A Beta distribution, based on the
   result of each laboratory, was calculated and used to estimate the
   probability of each laboratory giving a correct result and its
   uncertainty.},

Abstract = {Silymarin, a natural acknowledged hepatoprotector used in humans to
   treat liver diseases, has been tested in dairy cows during peripartum, a
   period during which animals are subject to subclinical fatty liver. Ten
   grams of silymarin (76\% pure extract consisting in flavonolignans,
   taxifolin, and other trace compounds) per day, was administered as a
   water suspension by an oral drench to 15 cows from d 10 before expected
   calving to 15 d after calving. Milk production was measured, and
   colostrum, milk, and blood samples were analyzed during the experimental
   period. Treated animals showed the peak of milk production at 55 +/-
   1.85 d after calving, 1 wk before the control group (62 +/- 3.27d); the
   average peak production was 41.6 +/- 1.05 kg for the treated group vs.
   39.1 +/- 1.44 kg for the control; the treated animals maintained a
   greater milk production than control cows throughout lactation (9922.1
   +/- 215.7 vs. 9597.8 +/- 225.4 kg). Milk composition was unaffected by
   treatment. No silymarin residues were detected in colostrum and all milk
   samples. After calving, body condition score (BCS) decrease was greater
   for control compared with treated cows. Glucose, urea, triglycerides
   (TG), total cholesterol, beta-hydroxibutyrate (BHBA), and gamma-glutamyl
   transferase (GGT) in plasma were unaffected by treatment. Plasma
   nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) on d-7 were higher in treated cows
   compared with the control group (741 vs. 181 mumol/L). From this
   evidence, it is possible to conclude that silymarin beneficially
   affected lactation performances and body condition of treated animals.
   Blood and milk parameters do not indicate any adverse effects of feeding
   this natural compound.},

Abstract = {Two species of Rhinoestrus (i.e. Rhinoestrus purpureus (Brauer) and
   Rhinoestrus usbekistanicus Gan) cause nasal myiasis in horses, donkeys
   and zebras. In the past 15 years myiasis caused by R. purpureus has been
   reported in Egypt and by R. usbekistanicus in Senegal and Niger, both in
   horses and in donkeys. With the aim to investigate the presence of this
   myiasis in antochthonous horses and donkeys from southern Italy and to
   study the seasonal trend of larval infection, 212 native horses were
   necropsied in two slaughterhouses in the Apulia region (site A) from
   January to November 2003, and 120 native horses and two donkeys in one
   slaughterhouse in Sicily (site B) from January to October 2003. Thirteen
   of 212 and 5 of 120 horses examined from sites A and B, respectively,
   were infected by nasal bot fly larvae. Both donkeys examined were
   positive. Two hundred and thirteen larvae, representing all stages, were
   collected from the throat region, the turbinates and beyond the lamina
   cribrosa of the ethmoid bone, in the cerebral cavity. Third larval
   stages were retrieved from April to September with the highest mean
   burden in site A in May and in July in site B. The simultaneous presence
   all three larval stages at site B suggests the existence of two or more
   overlapping generations.
   Larvae were identified on the basis of peritreme structures and
   arrangement of the spines on the dorsal surface of the third segment.
   Some L3 collected from sites A and B presented morphological
   characteristics of both R. usbekistanicus and R. purpureus. The presence
   of mixed features on the L3 of Rhinoestrus collected from the same
   animals may be explained by the existence of a single species of
   Rhinoestrus presenting different morphotypes or of two species of
   Rhinoestrus which are both present in southern Italy since this area is
   midway between eastern and African countries where these two species
   have been reported. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {It is well known that the immune response in sheep against Brucella
   melitensis is subject to individual variation, depending on diverse
   factors. It bears asking whether these factors (e.g. clinical disease,
   active infection, state of previous immunity), when affecting a group,
   can cause variation in the performance of different diagnostic tests. To
   clarify some of the circumstances in which this immune response can
   vary, we examine the immune-response profile of sheep protected against
   the clinical disease by prior vaccination with strain Rev. 1 in
   comparison with the profile of unprotected females showing the classical
   brucellosis symptoms. An experimental infection was provoked at
   midpregnancy under controlled conditions of both non-vaccinated (n = 7)
   and previously Rev. 1-vaccinated ewes (n = 5). Their immune response was
   monitored from 7 to 9 weeks before abortion or normal birth to 30 weeks
   afterwards. Antibody response was assessed by classical tests (Rose
   Bengal test, complement fixation test (CFT)) in comparison with other
   diagnostic tests (indirect ELISA (iELISA), competitive ELISA (cELISA),
   fluorescence polarization assay (FPA), immunocapture test (ICT)). In
   addition, the cell-mediated immune response was indirectly evaluated by
   the in vitro antigen-specific release of gamma-interferon. The antibody
   levels and antigen-specific gamma-IFN profile of the non-vaccinated ewes
   having the disease and excreting the pathogen was notably high and
   differed significantly (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) from those of vaccinated
   ewes that neither contracted brucellosis nor excreted the pathogen. In
   general, all the tests detect the infection in the non-vaccinated ewes
   with substantial effectiveness. It can be concluded that the high levels
   of circulating antibodies and of antigen-specific gamma-IFN are related
   to active Brucella infection. Similarly, the state of protection against
   the disease, but not necessarily against infection, due to a previous
   immunization with the Rev. 1 vaccination, appears to be responsible for
   a low level of detectable immune response. Nevertheless, the design of
   the study limits conclusions to pregnant ewes and cannot be extrapolated
   to non-pregnant ewes or rams. Likewise, the study provides no
   information on animals which are carriers of B. melitensis. (C) 2004

Abstract = {We investigated whether spray-dried plasma (SDP) improved growth and
   health of piglets challenged with enterotoxigenic Escherichia colt K88
   (ETEC). Forty-eight pigs weaned at 21 d (BW = 4.88 +/- 0.43 kg) received
   one of four diets containing 6\% SDP or fish proteins (as-fed basis)
   either nonmedicated (SDP-NM and FP-NM diets) or medicated with 0 or 250
   mg/kg of colistine + 500 mg/kg of amoxycycline (SDPM and FP-M diets),
   for 15 d. On d 4, pigs were orally challenged with ETEC. On d 15, eight
   pigs per dietary group were killed, blood and saliva were collected for
   analysis of K88 fimbriae-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)-A, and jejunum was
   removed for villi preparation, histological analysis, and cytokine
   expression. The presence or absence of K88 receptors (K88(+) and K88(-)
   pigs respectively) was determined by villous adhesion assay. Effects of
   protein source on ADG (P = 0.04) and ADFI (P < 0.01), as well of
   medication on ADFI (P < 0.02), of all pigs were observed. In sacrified
   pigs, there was an effect of protein source on ADG (P = 0.03) and ADFI
   (P < 0.001), as well an interaction between medication and presence of
   K88 receptor (P = 0.02) for feed:gain ratio. Plasma K88 specific IgA
   were low in all K88(-) pigs and higher in K88(+) pigs fed FP-NM compared
   with all the other groups (P < 0.05), except SDP-M. An interaction was
   found among protein source, medication, and presence of K88 receptors (P
   = 0.04). Saliva IgA concentrations were high in all pigs fed FP-NM and
   low in all other pigs. Jejunum of pigs fed FP-NM showed some
   ulcerations, edema, and mild inflammatory cell infiltration (ICI). In
   pigs fed FP-M, edema was reduced. Conversely, only a mild ICI was
   observed in pigs fed SDP-NM and SDP-M. Crypt depth was increased in
   K88(+) pigs fed SDP-NM and an interaction between protein source and
   presence of K88 receptors was observed (P < 0.05). Expressions of tumor
   necrosis factor-a and interleukin (IL)-8 were lower in pigs fed SDP-NM
   and SDP-M than in those fed FP-NM and FP-M, either K88(-) or K88(+) (P <
   0.01). In pigs fed FP diets, expression of IL-8 tended to increase (P =
   0.08) in K88(+) compared with K88(-) subjects. Expression of
   interferon-gamma increased in K88(-) and K88(+) pigs fed FP-M as
   compared with other pigs (P < 0.01). These results indicate that feeding
   with SDP improved growth performance and protected against E.
   coli-induced inflammatory status, and suggest that use of SDP-NM can be
   considered a valid antibiotic alternative.},

Abstract = {Two approaches for simultaneous identification of both Foot-and-mouth
   disease virus (FMDV) and Swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV) are
   described: (1) a single-step reverse transcription-PCR with three
   primers and (2) a PCR-ELISA assay with two universal primers for genome
   amplification and two virus-specific probes for identification. These
   methods are based on the use of 3D gene universal PCR primers, the
   structure of which was optimized and refined due to the close
   relationship between the two viruses belonging to different genera of
   the Picornaviridae family. In procedure (1), a three-primer PCR
   containing one universal antisense primer and two virus-specific primers
   was shown to differentiate between FMDV and SVDV in one reaction, due to
   the different length of the amplified DNA fragments (600 and 340 base
   pairs, respectively). In procedure (2), the two viruses were identified
   by PCR-ELISA, i.e. PCR for the 3D gene followed by two parallel
   hybridizations with FMDV and SVDV-specific probes in microplate wells
   and ELISA detection. The application of universal primers could halve
   the number of PCR experiments in both cases, as compared to the usual
   virus-specific PCR procedures. Also, we investigated the 3D gene
   structure of several SVDV strains isolated at different times. No
   essential changes were detected in the regions coding for conserved
   motifs of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase recognized by our universal
   primers. The multi-primer PCR was successfully tested on 38 FMDV and 15
   SVDV strains, and the PCR-ELISA on 32 FMDV and 16 SVDV strains including
   clinical material from disease cases.},

Title = {Modelling the distributions of Culicoides bluetongue virus vectors in

Journal = {MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Surveillance data from 268 sites in Sicily are used to develop climatic
   models for prediction of the distribution of the main European
   bluetongue virus (BTV) vector Culicoides imicola Kieffer (Diptera:
   Ceratopogonidae) and of potential novel vectors, Culicoides pulicaris
   Linnaeus, Culicoides obsoletus group Meigen and Culicoides newsteadi
   Austen. The models containing the `best' climatic predictors of
   distribution for each species, were selected from combinations of 40
   temporally Fourier-processed remotely sensed variables and altitude at a
   1 km spatial resolution using discriminant analysis. Kappa values of
   around 0.6 for all species models indicated substantial levels of
   agreement between model predictions and observed data. Whilst the
   distributions of C. obsoletus group and C. newsteadi were predicted by
   temperature variables, those of C. pulicaris and C. imicola were
   determined mainly by normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), a
   variable correlated with soil moisture and vegetation biomass and
   productivity. These models were used to predict species presence in
   unsampled pixels across Italy and for C. imicola across Europe and North
   Africa. The predicted continuous presence of C. pulicaris along the
   appenine mountains, from north to south Italy, suggests BTV transmission
   may be possible in a large proportion of this region and that seasonal
   transhumance (seasonal movement of livestock between upland and lowland
   pastures) even in C. imicola-free areas should not generally be
   considered safe. The predicted distribution of C. imicola distribution
   shows substantial agreement with observed surveillance data from Greece
   and Iberia (including the Balearics) and parts of mainland Italy (Lazio,
   Tuscany and areas of the Ionian coast) but is generally much more
   restricted than the observed distribution (in Sardinia, Corsica and
   Morocco). The low number of presence sites for C. imicola in Sicily
   meant that only a restricted range of potential C. imicola habitats were
   included in the training set and that predictions could only be made
   within this range. Future modelling exercises will use abundance data
   collected according to a standardized protocol across the Mediterranean
   and, for Sicily in particular, should include non-climatic environmental
   variables that may influence breeding site suitability such as soil
   type.},

Abstract = {During the recent Mediterranean epizootic of bluetongue, an extensive
   programme of serological and vector (Culicoides biting midges (Diptera:
   Ceratopogonidae)) surveillance was carried out across Sicily. This paper
   presents the analysis of 911 light trap catches collected at the times
   of peak Culicoides abundance (summer to autumn 2000-2002) in 269 sites,
   in order to produce detailed maps of the spatial distribution of the
   main European vector, Culicoides imicola Kieffer and that of potential
   novel vectors. Whereas C. imicola was found at only 12\% of sites,
   potential novel vectors, Culicoides obsoletus group Meigen, Culicoides
   pulicaris Linnaeus and Culicoides newsteadi Austen were present at over
   50\% of sites. However, the spatial distribution of C. imicola showed
   the closest correspondence to that of the 2000 and 2001 bluetongue (BT)
   outbreaks and its presence and abundance were significant predictors of
   the probability of an outbreak, suggesting that it was the main vector
   during these years. Although C. imicola may have played a role in
   transmission in several sites near Paterno, it was absent from the
   majority of sites at which outbreaks occurred in 2002 and from all sites
   in the province of Messina. All three potential novel vectors were
   widespread across sites at which outbreaks occurred during 2002. Of
   these, C. newsteadi was an unlikely candidate, as it was significantly
   less prevalent in outbreak vs. non-outbreak sites in Messina. It is
   hypothesized that the yearly distribution and intensity of outbreaks is
   directly attributable to the distribution and abundance of the vectors
   involved in transmission during each year. When C. imicola operated as
   the main vector in 2000 and 2001, outbreaks were few in number and were
   restricted to coastal regions due to low abundance and prevalence of
   this species. In 2002, it is hypothesized that BTV transmission was
   handed over to more prevalent and abundant novel vector species, leading
   to numerous and widespread outbreaks and probably to overwintering of

Abstract = {Since the ``bird flu{''} incident in Hong Kong SAR in 1997, several
   studies have highlighted the substantial role of domestic birds, such as
   turkeys and chickens, in the ecology of influenza A viruses. Even if
   recent evidence suggests that chickens can maintain several influenza
   serotypes, avian influenza viruses (AIVs) circulating in domestic
   species are believed to be introduced each time from the wild bird
   reservoir. However, so far the direct precursor of influenza viruses
   from domestic birds has never been identified. In this report, we
   describe the antigenic and genetic characterization of the surface
   proteins of H7N3 viruses isolated from wild ducks in Italy in 2001 in
   comparison to H7N3 strains that circulated in Italian turkeys in
   2002-2003. The wild and domestic avian strains appeared strictly related
   at both phenotypic and genetic level: homology percentages in seven of
   their genes were comprised between 99.8\% (for PB2) and 99.1\% (for M),
   and their NA genes differed mainly because of a 23-aminoacid deletion in
   the NA stalk. Outside this region of the molecule, the NAs of the two
   virus groups showed 99\% similarity. These findings indicate that turkey
   H7N3 viruses were derived ``in toto{''} from avian influenza strains
   circulating in wild waterfowl I year earlier, and represent an important
   step towards the comprehension of the mechanisms leading to interspecies
   transmission and emergence of potentially pandemic influenza viruses.

Title = {Non-invasive genotyping of the endangered Apennine brown bear: a case

Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {199-209},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Individual identification was assessed for 30 brown bears (Ursus arctos)
   from the endangered Apennine population in central Italy, mostly through
   non-invasive sampling. Shed hairs were used as a source of DNA to obtain
   single genotype profiling at 12 microsatellite loci. Average expected
   heterozygosity (0.438) and mean number of alleles per locus (2.2) showed
   that the level of genetic diversity was one of the lowest recorded for
   brown bear populations across their European and North American ranges.
   A large portion of the original genetic variation may have been lost
   through random genetic drift during the recent period of isolation. The
   level of genetic variability proved sufficient to identify the bears
   individually by using nine microsatellite loci. The probability that two
   animals shared by chance the same multilocus genotype was estimated to
   be 1 in 100. Despite the recent history of small population size, the
   average relatedness indicated that the majority of individuals are not
   first-order relatives. Simulated paternity tests showed that a 12-loci
   genotype may be necessary to assign paternity with an 80-95\% confidence
   level. Lack of genetic diversity, as well as the maintenance of an
   adequately effective number, may seriously jeopardise the long-term
   survival of this population. Furthermore, high mortality rates, poaching
   and encroachment by human activities represent immediate, urgent
   concerns. A population increase through enforced protection and habitat
   restoration is recommended. Presently, restocking with bears from other
   source populations should be discouraged to avoid genetic extinction.
   Non-invasive sampling provided reliable population and individual
   genetic data. Microsatellite genotyping proved a valuable genetic
   tagging method and a feasible alternative to conventional field counts
   for the brown bear in central Italy.},

Abstract = {Between 1999 and 2002, 9349 sera and 517 aborted samples (422 foetuses
   and 95 placenta) were analysed from 675 sheep and 82 goat farms
   distributed all over the island of Sardinia. After abortion
   notification, sera collected at random from adult animals were examined
   to detect antibodies specific to Coxiella burnetii by ELISA, whereas
   foetuses and placenta were analysed by PCR assay. Specific IgG
   antibodies were detected in 255 (38\%) sheep farms and in 39 (47\%) goat
   herds whereas 40 ovine (10\%) and 3 (6\%) caprine foetuses were C
   burnetii PCR-positive. Although C. burnetii DNA was amplified from
   different types of tissues, placenta was the tissue with the highest
   detection rate. Seroprevalence analysis indicates that C. burnetii
   distribution in sheep and goats is very high, but PCR results
   demonstrate that C. burnetii has a relatively low role in abortion,
   especially in goats. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Exposure of human alimentation-destined animals to toxic substances can
   bean important risk factor for human health. Mutagenicity tests
   represent a good method for genotoxic effect evaluation of environmental
   pollutants. The micronucleus frequency in peripheral blood and bone
   marrow erythrocytes has been evaluated in four domestic Ungulate species
   (ox, sheep, swine and horse). For each species two or three groups of
   animals coming from Italy and other European countries were analysed and
   the results indicate a relatively low mean frequency of micronucleated
   erythrocytes (ME), both in peripheral blood and bone marrow. The
   comparison between these two frequencies in the four species studied
   shows that the ME frequency in sheep and horse is significantly higher
   in peripheral blood than in bone marrow, whereas in bovines it is higher
   in the bone marrow, and in swine the difference is not significant.
   These results could indicate that in ox and swine the spleen is involved
   in ME removal from the peripheral circulation, as is known for other
   species including man. Nevertheless, it cannot be excluded that the same
   occurs in the other two species, since they exhibit a relatively low
   peripheral blood ME frequency as well. Further studies on domestic
   mammals are needed to clarify the spleen function and verify the use of
   the peripheral blood micronucleus test for genotoxic biomonitoring. At
   present, the application of the micronucleus test to the bone marrow
   seems a more suitable method, but, being invasive, it can be used only
   as a control system of animal hygiene and health, in addition to the
   routine tests, rather than for biomonitoring. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The secreted pore-forming toxin listeriolysin O (LLO) is an essential
   virulence factor that allows the food-borne bacterial pathogen Listeria
   monocytogenes to escape from the phagocytic vacuole and reach the host
   cytosol. This protein belongs to the group of cholesterol-binding
   sulfhydryl-activated toxins, expressed by a large number of
   Gram-positive bacteria. A protocol for large-scale expression and
   purification of recombinant LLO was previously optimized. By a simple
   two-step purification method, we achieved a high-level LLO synthesis
   (4.5 mg 1(-1) of cell culture) in a hemolytically active form (1.2 x
   10(6) HU mg(-1) of protein). This procedure can solve the problem of LLO
   isolation from L. monocytogenes cultures which is a difficult task,
   mainly owing to the low levels of toxin released in the culture media.
   Here we report the characterization of toxin properties and its
   preliminary application in an ELISA diagnostic test for listeriosis. (C)

Abstract = {Some biogenic amines, such as putrescine, cadaverine, spermidine and
   histamine, have been found to be useful as quality indices for the
   decomposition of fish, so research on the simultaneous analysis of
   various biogenic amines in food is of interest and importance. The
   intake of histamine may cause an allergic intoxication known as
   ``scombroid poisoning{''} while secondary biogenic amines can potentiate
   the toxicity of histamine and in addition can react with nitrite to form
   carcinogenic nitrosamines. A new method for the simultaneous
   determination of underivatized biogenic amines based on ion-exchange
   chromatography with conductivity detector has been developed. The
   proposed method offers a number of advantages over previous pulsed
   amperometric detection and integrated pulsed amperometric detection
   methods such as simpler extraction procedure and sharp peaks.
   Separations were performed on a new low hydrophobic weak cation-exchange
   analytical column. This technique is simple, rapid and useful for
   routine checks in repetitive analyses. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Histamine is a degradation product of the bacterial decarboxylation of
   the amino acid histidine, which is present in large amounts in fish
   tissues of the Clupeidae and Scombridae families and its presence is an
   indicator of good manufacturing practices and of the state of
   preservation of some food. A capillary electrophoresis and
   high-performance liquid chromatography method with diode arrays
   detection (HPLC-DAD) were compared and validated: no laborious
   pre-treatment, no clean up and no derivatization was necessary. In both
   techniques the correlation coefficient exceeded 0.999 for all the
   analyses carried out during validation. The limit of detection and the
   limit of quantitation are 1 and 2 mg/kg, respectively, for
   high-performance liquid chromatography and 0.5 and 1 mg/kg,
   respectively, for capillary electrophoresis. Good recoveries were
   observed for the histamine under investigation at all spiking levels and
   average recoveries were higher than 92\% with the relative standard
   deviation less than 4\% for high-performance liquid chromatography and

Abstract = {Ochratoxin A (OTA), a mycotoxin frequently present in food and
   feedstuffs, produces a wide range of toxic effects, including cell death
   via lipid peroxidation. In one human and four animal cell lines we
   determined the half lethal concentration (LC50) of OTA, its effect on
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and its ability to induce
   cytochrome p450 activity. We also examined the protective effect of
   alpha-tocopherol and all-trans-retinol in the most sensitive cell lines
   (i.e. bovine mammary epithelia, for which LC50 was 0.8 mug/ml (24 h),
   and Madin Darby canine kidney, for which LC50 was 4.3 mug/ml (48 h)).
   Pre-incubation for 3 h with either antioxidant significantly (P< 0.05)
   ameliorated the OTA-induced reduction in cell viability and
   significantly decreased (P<0.05) ROS production. These findings indicate
   that oxidative stress is an important factor in OTA cytotoxicity.
   Supplementation with antioxidant molecules may counteract the short-term
   toxicity of this mycotoxin.},

Abstract = {The antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates of Salmonella enterica
   serotypes Typhimurium, Enteritidis, and Infantis isolated from humans,
   foodstuffs and farm animals in Italy between 1999 and 2001 was examined.
   All the isolates were susceptible to cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin, but
   high rates of resistance were observed for several other drugs,
   especially for S. Typhimurium. The rates of resistance and
   multiresistance were generally higher among animal and food isolates
   than in human strains; conversely, no significant difference was
   observed between animal and food isolates. Among S. Typhimurium,
   multiresistance was more common in bovine, poultry and rabbit strains
   than in swine isolates, and was rare in strains from pigeon. Resistance
   to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole was mainly found in isolates of swine
   and human origin. This study confirms the role of livestock as a
   reservoir of drug-resistant Salmonella spp. and underlines the need for
   integrated surveillance systems of antibiotic resistance that consider
   isolates not only from human disease but also from the animal reservoirs
   and the food vehicles.},

Abstract = {A trial was performed to establish whether turkeys vaccinated against
   avian influenza with a vaccine containing a strain with a heterologous
   neuraminidase to the challenge virus required a higher infectious dose
   to develop infection than naive birds. Birds were vaccinated with a
   commercially available, inactivated oil emulsion product containing the
   strain A/ty/Italy/99/(H7N1) and challenged with different dilutions of a
   LPAI isolate A/ty/Italy/8000/02(H7N3) obtained during the 2002 to 2003
   Italian epidemic. Groups of 10 vaccinated and 10 unvaccinated birds.
   were infected experimentally with a virus suspension containing 10(2,)
   10(4) and 10(6) median embryo infective dose (EID50)/0.1 ml. Infected
   birds were observed daily with tracheal and cloacal swabs collected at
   regular intervals for antigen detection, virus isolation and real-time
   reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Pre-infection and
   post-infection serology was also performed. The results of the
   experiment indicate that infection is achieved in naive birds with 10(4)
   EID50, while vaccinated birds are resistant at this challenge dose.
   Vaccinated and unvaccinated birds were susceptible to infection with
   10(6) EID50, although the duration and/or the number of birds shedding
   was reduced in the vaccinated group. The data presented indicate that
   heterologous vaccination in the framework of a `Differentiating Infected
   from Vaccinated Animals' strategy can be a valid tool to support
   eradication measures in areas with high densities of susceptible
   animals.},

Abstract = {The hepatitis A virus (HAV) is the most common cause of viral infection
   linked to shellfish consumption. The lack of correlation between the
   fecal coliform indicators and the presence of enteric viruses in

   methods to detect viruses. We compared two RT-PCR based techniques
   currently available for the detection of the hepatitis A virus (HAV) in
   shellfish. Both approaches involve extraction of viral particles by
   glycine buffer and concentration of virus particles by one or two PEG
   precipitation steps. One procedure involves as RNA extraction method the
   use of oligo (dT) cellulose to select poly (A) RNA, and the other uses a
   system in which total RNA is bound on silica membrane. Comparison of the
   two RT-PCR based methods highlighted the efficiency of the first
   approach whick is less time-consuming and technically demanding than the

Abstract = {Biological markers of lead exposure were measured in 20 dogs from five
   different habitats chosen on the basis of the degree of anthropogenic
   influence. None of the dogs had clinical signs of lead poisoning.
   Compared to controls, blood lead concentrations were significantly
   higher in dogs from industrial areas, confirming the role of lead
   emissions in environmental pollution and the possible role of dogs as
   biomonitors of lead exposure in these areas. Whole blood lead
   concentrations were similar in dogs living in urban and rural areas,
   probably due to ``indirect{''} lead sources and due to decreased urban
   lead contamination. As in humans, individual variability was detected.
   No significant correlation between clinico-pathological changes
   (hematology, clinical chemistry, delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase
   activity and other intra-erythrocytic metabolic parameters) and lead
   concentration were observed. Our findings suggest dogs can be useful as
   sentinels of environmental lead exposure.},

Abstract = {We report the results of a 6-year serological and virological monitoring
   performed in ducks and coots in Italy, in order to assess the degree of
   influenza A virus circulation in these birds during wintering. A total
   of 1039 sera collected from 1992 to 1998 was screened by a double
   antibody sandwich blocking ELISA (NP-ELISA): seroprevalence of
   antibodies to influenza A viruses was significantly higher in ducks
   compared to coots (52.2\% vs. 7.1\%, respectively). The
   hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assay, performed on NP-ELISA positive
   sera, showed that 16.9\% of these duck sera and 33.3\% of these coot
   sera had antibodies to at least one influenza virus HA subtype: ducks
   showed HI antibodies against most of the HA subtypes, except for the H3,
   H4, H7, and H12; coots were seropositive to the H3 and HI 0 subtypes,
   only. From 1993 to 1998, 22 virus strains were obtained from 802 cloacal
   swabs, with an overall virus isolation frequency of 2.7\%. Viruses
   belonging to the H1N1 subtype were by far the most commonly circulating
   strains (18/22) and were isolated mainly from ducks (17/18). The
   remaining viruses were representative of the H10N8, H5N2 and H3N8
   subtypes. Our data indicate some differences between influenza A virus
   circulation in sympatric ducks and coots and a significant antigervic
   diversity between some reference strains and viruses recently isolated
   in Italy. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A study was carried out on four adult cattle to assess the pathogenicity
   of Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC strain T1/44, currently used
   as a vaccine for the control of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP)
   in Namibia. Post mortem examination 9 weeks after endobronchial
   inoculation of the vaccine strain to three of the four animals revealed
   unilateral pleuropneumonic lesions, pleuritis and well-developed
   sequesters in two of the three inoculated animals and several small
   sequesters surrounded by pleuropneumonic lesions in the diaphragmatic
   and apical lobes in one animal. The fourth animal, which was not
   directly inoculated but was in close contact with the inoculated
   animals, revealed only an adhesion area of the lung to the ribcage.
   Serological examination carried out using the complement fixation test
   (CFT) detected positive titres in all three intubated animals and the
   indirect CBPP-LppQ-ELISA was positive for two of the three inoculated
   animals. The contact animal showed no seroconversion. M. mycoides subsp.
   mycoides SC was isolated from the sequesters of two of the inoculated
   animals. Isolation of mycoplasmas was not possible from the third
   inoculated animal due to heavy contamination of the samples by other
   bacteria, but the presence of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC could be
   evidenced by PCR from clinical samples. The identity of the T1/44
   vaccine strain isolated from the sequesters of two animals was confirmed
   by T1/44-specific PCR analysis and by IS1296 typing using Southern blot.
   These results clearly show that inoculation of TI/44 vaccine via the
   endobronchial route can lead to CBPP. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), or prion diseases, are
   mammalian neurodegenerative disorders characterized by a
   posttranslational conversion and brain accumulation of an insoluble,
   protease-resistant isoform (PrPSc) of the host-encoded cellular prion
   protein (PrPC). Human and animal TSE agents exist as different
   phenotypes that can be biochemically differentiated on the basis of the
   molecular mass of the protease-resistant PrPSc fragments and the degree
   of glycosylation. Epidemiological, molecular, and transmission studies
   strongly suggest that the single strain of agent responsible for bovine
   spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) has infected humans, causing variant
   Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The unprecedented biological properties of
   the BSE agent, which circumvents the so-called ``species barrier{''}
   between cattle and humans and adapts to different mammalian species, has
   raised considerable concern for human health. To date, it is unknown
   whether more than one strain might be responsible for cattle TSE or
   whether the BSE agent undergoes phenotypic variation after natural
   transmission. Here we provide evidence of a second cattle TSE. The
   disorder was pathologically characterized by the presence of
   PrP-immunopositive amyloid plaques, as opposed to the lack of amyloid
   deposition in typical BSE cases, and by a different pattern of regional
   distribution and topology of brain PrPSc accumulation. In addition,
   Western blot analysis showed a PrPSc type with predominance of the low
   molecular mass glycoform and a protease-resistant fragment of lower
   molecular mass than BSE-PrPSc. Strikingly, the molecular signature of
   this previously undescribed bovine PrPSc was similar to that encountered
   in a distinct subtype of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.},

Abstract = {A survey to estimate the frequency and the level of contamination of the
   most commonly consumed pork products, with particular reference to fresh
   sausages, and a risk assessment were carried out in order to evaluate
   the risk of Salmonella spp. infection to consumers in the Abruzzi region
   (Italy). Results of the risk assessment show that fresh sausages may be
   an important source of Salmonella spp. infection in humans in Abruzzi.
   Model previsions are confirmed by results of a subsequent research on
   the risk for consumers due to Salmonella spp. in eggs (unpublished
   data), that Suggest an yearly incidence of family outbreaks of diarrhea
   due to Salmonella spp. between 3\% and 8.4\% in Abruzzi. (C) 2003

Abstract = {Fifty-eight multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica strains of 20
   serotypes, isolated from animal sources in Italy, were analyzed for
   tet(A) and strA-strB, conferring tetracycline and streptomycin
   resistance, respectively. The strA and strB genes were highly prevalent
   in Salmonella strains of our collection, being detected in 84\% of the
   streptomycin-resistant strains. In many strains, the strA and strB genes
   were linked to a particular Tn5393-derivative transposon characterized
   by the presence of the insertion sequence IS1133, previously identified
   only in the plant pathogen Erwinia amylovora. Sixty-eight percent of the
   tetracycline-resistant strains were tet(A) positive, indicating that
   this gene is widely diffused in Salmonella strains circulating in
   animals in Italy. Most of the tet(A) genes were localized within a
   deleted Tn1721 transposon variant. Two prevalent repN and repI1
   resistance plasmids were identified in Salmonella isolates of our
   collection.},

Abstract = {Two healthy buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) in a herd which had not been
   vaccinated against infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), were
   selected for their seropositivity for anti-bovine herpesvirus type 1
   (BoHV-1) glycoprotein E antibodies, and injected intramuscularly daily
   with dexamethasone for five consecutive days (day 1 to day 5) to
   reactivate any latent herpesvirus. Blood samples and nasal and vaginal
   swabs were collected daily from day 5 to day 15 from each buffalo for
   virological examination. All the vaginal swabs and blood samples were
   negative, but 13 of the 22 nasal swabs were positive; a cytopathic
   effect was observed in primary cultures of bovine fetal lung cells, and
   the viral isolates were identified as a herpesvirus by PCR. The viral
   strains were characterised by the sequence analysis of the genes coding
   for glycoproteins D and B, and the gene sequences were then used for
   phylogenetic analysis. The isolates from both buffaloes appeared
   identical at the level of the two genes, and were more closely related
   to bovine herpesvirus type 5 than to BoHV-1.},

Title = {Development of a real-time PCR assay for rapid detection and
   quantification of Alexandrium minutum (a dinoflagellate)},
Journal = {APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {70},

Abstract = {The marine dinoflagellate genus Alexandrium includes a number of species
   which produce neurotoxins responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning
   (PSP), which in humans may cause muscular paralysis, neurological
   symptoms, and, in extreme cases, death. A. minutum is the most
   widespread toxic PSP species in the western Mediterranean basin. The
   monitoring of coastal waters for the presence of harmful algae also
   normally involves microscopic examinations of phytoplankton populations.
   These procedures are time consuming and require a great deal of
   taxonomic experience, thus limiting the number of specimens that can be
   analyzed. Because of the genetic diversity of different genera and
   species, molecular tools may also help to detect the presence of target
   microorganisms in marine field samples. In this study, we developed a
   real-time PCR-based assay for rapid detection of all toxic species of
   the Alexandrium genus in both fixative-preserved environmental samples
   and cultures. Moreover, we developed a real-time quantitative PCR assay
   for the quantification of A. minutum cells in seawater samples.
   Alexandrium genus-specific primers were designed on the 5.8S rDNA
   region. Primer specificity was confirmed by using BLAST and by
   amplification of a representative sample of the DNA of other
   dinoflagellates and diatoms. Using a standard curve constructed with a
   plasmid containing the ITS1.5.8S-ITS2 A. minutum sequence and cultured
   A. minutum cells, we determined the absolute number of 5.8S rDNA copies
   per cell. Consequently, after quantification of 5.8S rDNA copies in
   samples containing A. minutum cells, we were also able to estimate the
   number of cells. Several fixed A. minutum bloom sea samples from Arenys
   Harbor (Catalan Coast, Spain) were analyzed using this method, and
   quantification results were compared with standard microscopy counting
   methods. The two methods gave comparable results, confirming that
   real-time PCR could be a valid, fast alternative procedure for the
   detection and quantification of target phytoplankton species during
   coastal water monitoring.},

   environmental, meteorological and climatic features were surveyed to
   evaluate areas where Culicoides could be present. A risk map was
   developed and five zones with different risk levels were defined. Data
   from Culicoides trapping were surveyed to evaluate the capability of the
   risk map to predict presence/absence of vectors. Finally, data from 2002
   BT surveillance (outbreaks and serologically Positive sentinels {[}SPS])
   were compared to the map. Captures of Culicoides, SPS and BT in areas
   the map indicated as a medium/high risk level, seem to confirm
   reliability of the produced map. However, very few C imicola were
   captured in these medium/high risk areas.},

Abstract = {The eastern focus of the current outbreak of bluetongue (BT) in the
   Mediterranean Basin commenced in late 1998, infecting Turkey and some of
   the eastern islands of Greece. In the summer of 1999 it moved to
   continental Greece and for the first time to Bulgaria. By the late
   summer of 2000, BT spread progressively through Greece and to the Balkan
   states. The BT virus (BTV) serotypes involved were BTNT-4, BTAT-9 and
   BTV-16. The west-central focus of the outbreak, involving BTV-2,
   appeared in Tunisia in December 1999 and the following summer also in
   Algeria. In August 2000, BTV-2 was reported for the first time in Italy
   (in Sardinia) and soon thereafter in France (Corsica) and in Spain (the
   Balearic Isles). In the autumn of 2000, a second serotype (BTV-9)
   emerged In southern peninsular Italy. Eventually this incursion of virus
   into the central Mediterranean region resulted in the largest epidemic
   of BT ever to affect Europe. Some features of this epidemic differ
   significantly from those observed previously, namely:
   a) its deep penetration northwards (reaching 44 degrees N both in Italy
   and in the Balkans)
   b) its persistence across four seasons in various zones of Italy and the
   Balkans, implying that BT could become endemic over a wide geographic
   area
   c) its successful invasion of areas separated from previously infected
   ones by fairly large distances (Sardinia, Sicily Calabria, and the
   Balearic islands).
   The pattern of the spread of BT across Italy, before the introduction of
   vaccination, is described. The possible role of climate, sod and insect
   vectors on the incidence of the disease, and the overwintering of the
   virus, are discussed. Some hypotheses on the possible origins and modes
   of introduction of BTV into Italy are postulated.},

Abstract = {Since August 2000, Italy has lost almost 500 000 sheep to the largest
   incursion of bluetongue (BT) yet to affect Europe. The national BT
   surveillance system includes serological and entomological programmes.
   The main objective of the serological programme is the early detection
   of BT virus (BT) circulation by periodical testing of more than 30 000
   sentinel cattle distributed across Italy. The sentinel network has been
   in force since October 2001 and since its inception has provided
   accurate and timely detection of viral circulation. However, the
   repeated testing of such a large number of animals required significant
   effort from the Veterinary Services and was costly for farmers.
   Consequently, a Montecarlo simulation model was developed to simulate
   different sentinel system scenarios and the results from each were
   compared. The model was validated using data derived from the
   serological surveillance activities in Sardinia from October 2001 to
   December 2002.},

Abstract = {During influenza surveillance activities carried out from 1999 to 2001
   in wild ducks, 311 cloacal swabs were collected in Central Italy. A
   total of 20 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) were isolated, that belonged
   to eight different subtypes. Five of these subtypes had never been
   isolated before in the area under study, including two H7N3 viruses
   obtained from mallards in Autumn 2001. One year after, outbreaks of AI
   caused by H7N3 LP viruses occurred and rapidly spread among commercial
   poultry farms in Northern Italy. We compared the H7N3 duck strains with
   the first two H7N3 turkey isolate, and a high level of similarity
   between the two viruses was found in all genes, except for the NA. The
   N3 genes of domestic poultry strains showed a 23-amino acid deletion in
   the stalk region, indicating an initial adaptation of wild waterfowl
   viruses to terrestrial bird species. Phylogenctic data are also
   discussed. This is the first report in which a domestic poultry AIV and
   its direct wild bird counterpart are described. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {The incursion of bluetongue (BT) in Italy, in August 2000, caused heavy
   economic losses, partly due to the direct effect of the disease on the
   animals, but mostly due to indirect losses due to ruminant movement
   restrictions conducive to heavy losses to the cattle and sheep industry.
   To limit losses due to both disease and virus circulation, which was the
   cause of movement restrictions, the Italian Ministry of Health in May
   2001 ordered the vaccination of animals of all domestic ruminant species
   in infected and << at risk >> areas. The vaccination strategy derived
   from a risk assessment that suggested that the vaccination of all
   domestic ruminants could reduce both direct losses and virus circulation
   significantly.
   The different levels of vaccination coverage, achieved in the various
   regions of Italy, had clear consequences on the spread of both disease
   and infection. In regions where more than 80\% of the target populations
   were vaccinated properly, the disease disappeared almost completely and
   virus circulation was significantly reduced, as documented by the
   serological surveillance system, after a single vaccination cycle. This
   led to a significant decrease in the areas subject to movement
   restrictions. Data generated by both field and controlled experiments
   contributed to modify the EU approach to BT and to some of the
   conclusions of the Third OIE International Symposium on Bluetongue that
   will probably lead to a modification of the Office International des
   Epizooties (OIE) standard.},

Abstract = {The present paper reports on the development, validation and field
   application of a control strategy for avian influenza infections in
   poultry. The ``DIVA{''} (Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated
   Animals) strategy is based on the use of an inactivated oil emulsion
   vaccine containing the same haemagglutinin (H) subtype as the challenge
   virus, but a different neuraminidase (N). The possibility of using the
   heterologous N subtype, to differentiate between vaccinated and
   naturally infected birds, was investigated through the development of an
   ``ad hoc{''} serological test based on the detection of specific anti-N
   antibodies. This test is based on an indirect fluorescent antibody
   assay, using as an antigen a baculovirus expressing recombinant N
   proteins.
   The vaccination strategy has been tested in the laboratory and shown to
   be efficacious both against challenge with highly pathogenic Al viruses
   and with low pathogenicity Al viruses, ensuring clinical protection,
   reduction of duration and titre of shedding. In addition, vaccination
   resulted in an increased resistance to infection.
   The companion diagnostic tests directed to the detection of anti-N1 and
   anti-N3 antibodies have been validated in the laboratory and using field
   samples. The serological assay showed an ``almost perfect agreement{''}
   (Kappa value) with the HI test, with relative sensitivity and
   specificity values of 98.1 and 95.7, respectively. The results of the
   present investigation suggest that the ``DIVA{''} control strategy may
   represent a tool to support the eradication of avian influenza
   infections in poultry.},

Abstract = {Among avian influenza viruses and avian paramyxoviruses are the
   aetiological agents of two of the most devastating diseases of the
   animal kingdom: (i) the highly pathogenic form of avian influenza,
   caused by some viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes, and (ii) Newcastle
   disease, caused by virulent strains of APMV type 1. Mortality rates due
   to these agents can exceed 50\% in naive bird populations, and, for some
   strains of AI, nearly 100\%. These viruses may also be responsible for
   clinical conditions in humans. The virus responsible for Newcastle
   disease has been known to cause conjunctivitis in humans since the
   1940s. The conjunctivitis is self-limiting and does not have any
   permanent consequences. Until 1997, reports of human infection with
   avian influenza viruses were sporadic and frequently associated with
   conjunctivitis. Recently, however, avian influenza virus infections have
   been associated with fatalities in human beings. These casualties have
   highlighted the potential risk that this type of infection poses to
   public health. In particular, the pathogenetic mechanisms of highly
   pathogenic avian influenza viruses in birds and the possibility of
   reassortment between avian and human viruses in the human host represent
   serious threats to human health. For this reason, any suspected case
   should be investigated thoroughly.},

Abstract = {The present paper reviews the worldwide situation regarding avian
   influenza (AI) infections caused by viruses of the H5 and H7 subtype in
   poultry from 1999 to date. The increase in the number of primary
   introductions and the scientific data available on the molecular basis
   of pathogenicity have generated concerns particularly for legislative
   purposes, for international trade and on novel control strategies,
   including vaccination. This has led to a new proposed definition of
   ``avian influenza{''} to extend to all infections caused by H5 and H7
   viruses regardless of their virulence as notifiable diseases, although
   this has encountered some difficulties in being approved. Reference is
   also made to the zoonotic aspects of avian influenza which until 1997
   were considered to be of limited relevance in human medicine, and have
   now gained importance, both for illness and fatalities which have
   occurred following natural infection with avian viruses, and for the
   potential of generating a reassortant virus which could give rise to the
   next human influenza pandemic. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   epidemiological surveillance programme, based on sentinel animals
   distributed over the entire region, are also given.
   In Sicily, the incidence of the disease is relatively low compared to
   some other areas in the Mediterranean Basin. Seventy-five outbreaks of
   the disease were recorded in the first three epidemics (October 2000 to
   May 2003). Overall morbidity was 13.25\%, mortality 536 and the case
   fatality rate 41.49\%. The Province of Catania seems to have been the
   worst affected; the incidence rate in August 2002 was 0.8\%. The monthly
   incidence rate was calculated for sentinel animals of which the
   estimated total was 3 654, distributed in 63 areas. It is important to
   underline that in the period under consideration, a total of 2 382
   animals was examined. During the surveillance period, which extended
   from September 2001 to May 2003, the incidence of BT peaked in September
   2002, at 5.91\% +/- 0.979. The cumulative incidence rate from September
   2001. to August 2002 and September 2002 to March 2003 was 4.53\% +/-
   0.76 and 20.03\% +/- 1.85, respectively. The circulation of BT virus

   the presence of C. imicola in the Basilicata and Sicily regions, it
   still over-predicted its presence in the Puglia region. This could be
   due to the occurrence of calcareous soils which dominate the Puglia
   landscape. The present SPM is an additive model that assigns an equal
   weight to each variable. However, the results suggest the existence of
   hitherto unconsidered variables that significantly influence the
   prevalence of C. imicola. To reflect their importance, these variables
   should be assigned a higher weighting in future models. However, the
   decision in regard to precisely what this weighting should be depends on
   a very thorough knowledge of the ecology of C. imicola.},

Abstract = {The detection of nucleotide sequences specific for genetically modified
   organisms (GMOs) in raw and processed food is based on different
   technological strategies, such as the extraction of DNA and the
   amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which allow to obtain
   qualitative and quantitative information. We developed a multiplex
   PCR-based DNA assay for simultaneously detecting multiple target
   sequences in genetically modified (GM) soybean (Roundup Ready(TM)).
   Internal control target (lectin gene) was included both to assess the
   efficiency of all reactions and eliminating any false negatives. The
   post-PCR analysis was carried out by 2.5\% agarose gel electrophoresis
   followed by ethidium bromide staining and densitometric analysis. The
   multiplex PCR method, showing high sensitivity and specificity, was
   tested on DNA extracted from certified reference samples containing GM
   soybean, and from food samples (feeds, food supplements, etc.).
   Comparison of this method with a quantitative evaluation, carried out by
   real-time PCR, suggests a possible utilization of the multiplex approach
   for semi-quantitative determinations. The method reported in this work
   can considerably reduce the time and the costs of the GM soybean
   detection, especially in the screening of a large number of food
   samples.},

Abstract = {Bartonella henselae is the major etiological agent of cat scratch
   disease in humans. Cats act as the natural reservoir of B. henselae and
   can transmit the infection to humans by a bite or scratch. The
   prevalence of B. henselae in cat populations was evaluated by
   serological and bacteriological tests. A total of 769 stray cats from
   three urban and three rural areas in northern Italy were sampled between
   January 1999 and December 2000. The positive and the negative predictive
   values of serological tests with respect to bacteremic status were
   evaluated. Tests of a total of 140 cats (18\%) resulted in detection of
   bacteremia. A total of 540 cats were tested by serollogy; 207 (38\%)
   were seropositive. Of the 531 cats tested by both methods, the results
   for 65 (12.2\%) showed both bacteremia detection and seropositivity. The
   molecular typing of the isolates showed that 20.6\% of bacteremic cats
   were infected with B. henselae type I strain, 61.1\% were infected with
   B. henselae type 11, and 18.3\% were coinfected with both. A
   statistically significant difference in antibody and bacteremia
   prevalences among geographical areas was detected. Statistical analysis
   showed no association between characteristics such as
   seroprevalence-bacteremic status, sex, general health status, and the
   presence of ectoparasites. The negative predictive value of serological
   test was 84.7\%, and the positive predictive value was 31.8\%. Receiving
   operator characteristic analysis of the data showed that serological
   tests had a low predictive value in relation to the bacteremic status of
   a cat; in surveys aimed at assessing the real risk of B. henselae
   infection in a human population, therefore, we suggest the use of blood
   culture as the reference test. Nevertheless, both blood culture assays
   and serological tests for Bartonella infection should be performed for a
   complete evaluation of the health status of cats.},

Abstract = {The occurrence of bluetongue virus (BTV) in areas in which intensive
   animal production is practised and where there is extensive movement of
   animals may have a substantial impact on both animal trade and
   husbandry. This situation occurred in Italy after the detection of
   bluetongue (131) in August 2000. In such situations, surveillance can be
   used to delineate with precision those areas in which the vitus is
   circulating and, consequently, to enforce the appropriate animal
   movement restrictions. Furthermore, surveillance can provide the data
   required to assess the risk associated with animal movement and trade. A
   structured surveillance system for the detection of BTV has been in
   place in Italy since August 2001. The system is based on the periodical
   testing of unvaccinated sentinel cattle that are uniformly scattered
   throughtout Italy in a grid of 400 km(2) cells. The initial number of
   sentinel. sites and sentinel animals, together with the width of the
   restricted area generated by the finding of a single seroconversion in a
   sentinel animal, were based on conservative criteria. Animal movement
   was restricted in a 20 km radius buffer zone around any positive
   serological result. This buffer area extends about 1257 km(2),
   equivalent to the area of three grid cells. After the commencement of
   the BT vaccination campaign in Italy, the sentinel surveillance system
   was the only way in which the effectiveness of vaccination and the
   incidence of infection in the non-immunised strata of ruminant animals
   could be estimated. Data collected over two years was used to assess the
   risks posed by the adoption of less conservative criteria for the
   delineation of infected areas and by the progressive relaxation of
   movement restrictions of vaccinated animals. In regard to the
   delineation of restricted areas, a new approach was tested and validated
   in the field, based on a Bayesian analysis of the positive and negative
   results obtained by the testing of sentinel animals from defined
   regions. For the risks related to animal movement, the surveillance data
   was used in risk assessment analyses to address the movement of
   slaughter and breeding animals from vaccinated/infected and surrounding
   areas to free areas. These risk assessments led to an amendment of the
   relevant European Union legislation. Finally a Montecarlo simulation
   model was developed to simulate different sentinel system scenarios and
   to decrease the total number of sentinel animals and sites required by
   the surveillance system. The sentinel surveillance system was
   complemented by an entomological surveillance system based on the use of
   a number of permanent blacklight traps run weekly year-round and a
   number of mobile blacklight traps moved through the grid cells during
   the summer and autumn of each year. The aim of entomological
   surveillance was to define the maximum distribution of vectors and their
   seasonal population dynamics. Furthermore, the permanent trap system
   provides an early warning of the start of new epidemics. The data from
   the entomological surveillance system were also analysed to generate
   probability maps of the presence of the principal BTV vector (Culicoides
   imicola) and to define the geographical risk of BT on a nationwide
   basis, and to predict the geographical distribution and the short-term
   spread of C imicola in Sardinia, using spatio-temporal data.
   The detection, since 2001, of BT outbreaks in the absence of C imicola
   and the recent identification of BTV in midges of the Obsoletus Complex
   also stimulated investigations on other vector Culicoides, includng C.
   obsoletus and C. pulicaris.},

Abstract = {In summer 2000, bluetongue (BT) infection was reported in Italy and
   caused a widespread epidemic involving a total of ten southern and
   central regions and is still in progress after three years. From the
   date of the first case (18 August 2000) to 14 May 2001, when the
   lowpoint in the first epidemic curve was reached, a total of 310 234
   animals in 6 869 flocks of three regions had been involved. From 15 May
   2001 to 14 April 2002, when a second epidemic wave swept through central
   and southern Italy, a total of 323 635 animals in 6 807 flocks in seven
   regions were involved. During 2000 and 2001 virtually no susceptible
   ruminants were vaccinated. On 11 May 2001, the Italian Ministry of
   Health ordered the vaccination of all susceptible domestic ruminant
   species (i.e. sheep, goats, cattle and water buffalo) in the infected
   and surrounding areas. The vaccination strategy stemmed from a risk
   assessment that demonstrated the possibility of such a strategy
   preventing most of the direct economic losses and decreasing the level
   of virus circulation. Vaccination of the target populations commenced in
   January 2002. In July 2002, when the new, epidemic peak was reached, the
   percentage of vaccinated populations varied between the regions with
   direct consequences on the spread of BT. The relationship between
   vaccination coverage of the target populations and animal losses due to
   disease and virus circulation, and as detected by the sentinel
   surveillance system, was analysed. The effectiveness of the vaccination
   campaign in limiting vir-us circulation and consequently indirect losses
   due to animal movement restrictions was analysed and evaluated. At the
   end of 2002, a second risk assessment led to the authorisation of the
   movement of vaccinated animals from infected areas (where at least 80\%
   of the susceptible population was vaccinated) directly to slaughter in
   unvaccinated areas free from infection. This risk assessment also
   generated new criteria to define zones where animal movement
   restrictions should be applied. Following the second vaccination
   campaign (January to May 2003), a third risk assessment was performed
   and the results from vaccination trials performed in controlled and in
   field conditions studied. These studies indicated that procedures to
   move vaccinated breeding animals from zones where infection exists to
   unvaccinated infection free zones could be contemplated.},

Abstract = {To elucidate the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases that can affect
   livestock in the Mediterranean Basin and elsewhere, it is essential to
   obtain a clear understanding of the fife-cycle and habits of the vector
   insects involved. One purpose of such investigations is to provide data
   for an epidemiological surveillance system. As this depends heavily upon
   the collection of specimens in the field, it is necessary to establish
   the kinds of information required, and how it can be obtained. This
   requires, in turn, that the method (and instrument) of capture be
   standardised, so that an data are as complete as possible, are
   comparable, and are informative at many levels. Within the surveillance
   system for bluetongue (BT) in Italy, the National Reference Centre for
   Exotic Diseases (CESME: Centro Studi Malattie Esotiche) is leading an
   intensive and countrywide survey for Culicoides (Diptera:
   Ceratopogonidae) using standardised methods and protocols developed in
   collaboration with the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute in South
   Africa. These methods have now also been implemented outside Italy in
   Malta, Croatia, Albania and Romania. This system includes the field
   protocols developed for the collection of Culicoides, the laboratory
   protocols developed around the insect analyses and the computer-based
   recording of all field data. Finally, the authors provide an `Easy key'
   for the rapid identification of the principal BT vector C. imicola and
   for grouping species that belong to the Obsoletus and Pulicaris vector
   complexes, and to the Nubeculosus and Schultzei potential vector
   complexes.},

Abstract = {Between 2000 and 2003, thousands of fight-trap collections for
   Culicoides were made throughout Italy and a detailed distribution map of
   the primary vector of bluetongue (BT) virus (BTV) C. imicola compiled.
   In some areas, however, where clinical BT occurred and C imicola could
   not be captured, the virus was isolated from biting midges belonging to
   the Obsoletus and/or the Pulicaris Complexes. Thus, the distribution and
   abundance of these two species complexes in Italy, as determined from
   about 3 000 collections, are reported here also and compared to that of
   C. imicola from about 24 000 collections). The probable spread of the
   main vector of BT, C. imicola, into the northern third of Italy, and the
   widespread prevalence of additional vectors of the Obsoletus and
   Pulicaris Complexes, indicate nearly all regions of Italy to be at some
   risk to incursions of BTV. However, these complexes comprise at least
   six and twelve species, respectively, so precisely which species are
   able to transmit BTV remains incompletely known.},

Abstract = {In late summer 2002, Eve wild-caught midges of the Obsoletus Complex
   were collected using blacklight traps placed at a horse stable in Teramo
   (Abruzzo, Italy). For the survival study under laboratory conditions, 1
   500 Obsoletus Complex midges were kept at 17 degrees C-25 degrees C and
   provided only with a sucrose solution. Of these, 150 (10\%) survived for
   at least 40 days and 3 midges were so alive after 92 days. In addition,
   10 midges survived 10 days at 4 degrees C. For the feeding trials, 40
   blood-meals (9 440 midges) were administered, 27 of which were
   successful (67.5\%); the feeding rate ranged from 0.3\% to 16.7\%, with
   a total of 592 engorged midges. Similar feeding rates (U Mann-Whitney
   test=129.5 p > 0.05) were obtained when natural (day-old chicken skin)
   and artificial (stretched parafilm) membranes were used. To infect the
   insects, a field strain of bluetongue (BT) virus (BTV) serotype 2
   isolated from the spleen of a sheep during the 2000 Italian outbreak was
   I P added to the blood-meal. Two different vital solutions, with titres
   of 10(6)TCID(50)/ml and 10(7)TCID(50)/ml, were prepared. Uninfected
   blood was significantly more appetising (U Mann-Whitney test=88.5 p <
   0.05) than the infected meal and the midges preferred (U Mann-Whitney
   test=48 p < 0.05) to feed on blood containing BTV-2 at a lower titre. A
   total of 251 midges were fed on BTV-2 infected blood and were then
   incubated at 23 degrees C-25 degrees C and fed with a sucrose solution
   for 10 days. During the incubation period, the dead insects were
   collected daily and analysed for evidence of virus infection. Of the 251
   engorged midges, 54 (21.5\%) died in the feeding chambers or during
   sorting on the chill table, 136 died within the first 10 days and 61
   survived longer. BTV was isolated only from those which died just after
   feeding (52.6\%; 10/19) or 24 h later (47.8\%; 11/23). Considering the
   small number of midges tested after 10 days of incubation, the
   prevalence of infection detected in this study (95\% probability) would
   have been higher than 4.74\%. These preliminary results appear very
   promising as this is the first time that midges of the Obsoletus Complex
   have been successfully fed under laboratory conditions.},

Abstract = {From 1997 to 2003, Italy has been affected by two epidemics of highly
   pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and by several outbreaks of low
   pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI). In 1999-2000 a severe HPAI epidemic
   affected the country, causing 413 outbreaks: a total of about 16 million
   birds died or were stamped out. From August 2000 to March 2001, a H7N1
   LPAI strain infected 78 poultry farms. The last affected flock was
   stamped out on the 2611 of March 2001. In October 2002, another LPAI
   virus of the H7N3 subtype emerged and infected a total of 388 poultry
   holdings. Eradication measures were based on stamping out or controlled
   marketing of slaughtered birds on infected farms and on the prohibition
   of restocking. Restriction measures on the movement of live poultry,
   vehicles and staff were also imposed. To supplement these disease
   control measures, two emergency vaccination programmes, based on the
   ``DIVA{''} (Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals) strategy
   were implemented. The two vaccination campaigns (2000-2002 and
   2002-2003) both resulted in the eradication of infection. However, the
   first campaign appeared to be more successful that the second and
   possible explanations are discussed.},

Abstract = {The thirty species of Culicoides biting midges that play a greater or
   lesser role in the transmission of bluetongue (BT) disease in the
   pantropical regions of the world are listed. Where known, each species
   is assigned to its correct subgenus and species complex. In the
   Mediterranean region there are four species of Culicoides involved in
   the transmission of BT and belong in the subgenera Avartitia Fox, 1955
   (three species) and Culicoides Latreille, 1809 (one species). Using both
   morphological and molecular second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2)
   sequence data, the authors reappraise the taxonomy of these four species
   and their congeners. A total of 56 populations of Culicoides collected
   from across Italy and representing 17 species (18 including the outgroup
   taxon C imicola Kieffer, 1913) were analysed. The findings revealed the
   following:
   - C. imicola is the only species of the Imicola Complex (subgenus
   Avaritia) to occur in the Mediterranean region
   - in Europe the subgenera Avaritia and Culicoides (usually, but not
   quite correctly, equated with the C. obsoletus and C. pulicaris groups,
   respectively) are both polyphyletic, each comprising three or more
   species complexes (including a hitherto unknown complex)
   - about half the species studied could not be identified with
   certainty,; furthermore, the results indicate that at least three
   previously described species of Palaearctic Culicoides should be
   resurrected from synonymy
   - finally, a high level of taxonomic congruence occurred between the
   morphological and the molecular data.
   One of the `new' vector species, C. pulicaris, was described by, the
   father of taxonomy, Carl Linnaeus, in 1758, but today, almost 250 years
   later, no monograph has appeared that treats the Culicoides fauna of the
   northern hemisphere as a whole. At a time when such economically
   important livestock diseases as BT are affecting ever larger areas of
   Europe, it would seem appropriate to commence the production of such a
   monograph to aid in the field identification of vector Culicoides. This
   `unfinished business' might best be achieved through a collaborative
   network embracing all ceratopogonid specialists currently active in both
   the Palaearctic and Nearctic faunal realms.},

Abstract = {Blacklight traps were used to collect Culicoides biting midges weekly
   between September 1996 and August 1998 at 40 sites distributed
   equidistantly across South Africa. The seasonal and geographic 9
   prevalences of 86 species of Culicoides were elucidated simultaneously,
   and included C. imicola Kieffer and C. bolitinos Meiswinkel the
   principal vectors of bluetongue (BT) and African horse sickness (AHS) in
   the region. These two species were amongst the most prevalent Culicoides
   to be found and, together, comprised > 50\% of the more than three
   million biting midges captured. The data are presented as coloured
   matrices, and are transformed also into inverse distance weighting (IDW)
   interpolative maps. The data reveal that the prevalence of each vector
   is somewhat fractured and it posited that this is (in part) due to
   signifcant differences in their respective breeding habitats. The
   results illustrate also that the presence of multiple vectors (in any
   region of the world) will complicate both the epidemiology of the
   orbiviral diseases they transmit and the formulation of rational
   livestock movement and disease control strategies. This is especially
   true for southern Europe where the recent devastating cycle of BT has
   been shown to involve at least three vectors. Finally, the influence
   that man has on the development of large foci of vector Culicoides
   around livestock may be less important than previously suggested but
   must be investigated further.},

Abstract = {The biting midge, Culicoides paolae Boorman, described from specimens
   collected in the extreme south of Italy in 1996, belongs in the subgenus
   Dryodesmyia. This subgenus was erected by Vargas in 1960 for the
   so-called Coplosus species group, an assemblage of 22 species endemic to
   the tropical regions of the New World and, where known, breed in
   vegetative materials including the decaying leaves (cladodes) and fruits
   of Central American cacti. The Mexican peoples have utilised these cacti
   for over 9 000 years; one of these, Opuntia ficus-indica Linnaeus, was
   brought to Europe by Christopher Columbus following his voyages of
   discovery. As a taxon C paolae is very similar to the Central American
   C. jamaicensis Edwards, 1922 raising the possibility that it (or a
   closely related species of Drymodesmyia) was introduced into the
   Mediterranean Region at the time of Columbus, but was (perplexingly)
   discovered only 500 years later and named C. paolae. The comparison of
   Sardinian specimens of C paolae with Panamanian material of C.
   jamaicensis (housed in the Natural History Museum in London) confirmed
   the two species to be very similar but unusual differences were noted
   around the precise distribution of the sensilla, coeloconica on the
   female flagellum. Until it is understood whether these differences
   represent either intra- or interspecific variation, the question of the
   possible synonymy of C paolae must be held in abeyance.},

Abstract = {Thirty-six subgenera comprise the biting midge genus Culicoides
   Latreille, 1809. One of these, the relatively small subgenus Avaritia
   Fox, 1955, is die most important as it contains nearly half of the 30
   world species of Culicoides known to play a greater or lesser role in
   the transmission of orbiviral diseases to livestock pantropically. These
   diseases include bluetongue (BT), African horse sickness (AHS) and
   epizootic haemorrhagic disease of deer (EHD). The subgenus Avaritia is
   distributed globally and the 70 species described have been subdivided
   into seven species groups and four subgroups. These 11 informal
   categories, variously labelled as either `subgroups', groups' or
   `complexes', are reduced here to seven in number (six species complexes
   and one subgroup) and although they appear natural, they are nearly all
   poorly defined. In this study two of these, namely the Imicola and
   Orientalis species complexes, are re-evaluated to determine which
   morphological characters define them more precisely, and so may help to
   establish their monophyly in the future. The two complexes are separable
   on eight discrete adult characters (two in the female, six in the male);
   these characters, and three secondary ones, are discussed and
   illustrated. The Imicola and Orientalis Complexes together embrace 23
   species; these species are assigned to their respective complexes and
   according to recent nomenclatural adjustments. The taxonomy of vector
   Culicoides worldwide remains superficial; to improve the situation it is
   recommended that the `traditional' morphological method be integrated
   with the `modern' molecular approach.},

Abstract = {We investigated tilmicosin (TIM) metabolism, at 25, 50 or 100 muM, in
   cultures of primary hepatocytes from rabbits bred commercially for food
   and in liver microsomes prepared from both untreated and rifampicin
   (RIF)-treated rabbits. RIF is a well-known cytochrome P4503A (CYP 3A)
   inducer in rabbits and most macrolides are known to be substrates of CYP
   3A.
   No peaks in addition to those of the cis and tracts forms of TIM were
   observed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in extracts of
   microsomes from untreated rabbits. When TIM was incubated with induced
   microsomes, at least two peaks were found by HPLC and an additional
   peak, eluting at shorter retention time was isolated from hepatocytes
   incubated for 24 h with the macrolide.
   The structures of the metabolites were then estimated by liquid
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in concentrated extracts from
   induced microsomes. Five metabolites were separated and putatively
   identified: cis and trans demethylated tilmicosin, tilmicosin N-oxide
   and cis and trans tilmicosin epoxide. The overall amount of metabolites
   produced in vitro using livers of untreated and RIF treated rabbits was
   very low, has also been observed in vivo and in vitro in cattle,
   chickens and pigs. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   epidemic character, and the new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
   (vCJD) in man, possibly related to BSE prion, through the intake of

   been tested: some of them, among which is Congo Red (CAS 573-58-0, CR),
   delayed the onset of symptoms in scrapie-infected rodents, and some CR
   derivatives proved to be effective in vitro.
   The capacity of a synthesized CR derivative (CR-A) and of the aromatic
   central benzidine rings of CR (CR-B) to abrogate scrapie-induced disease
   in experimentally infected hamsters was assayed. CR, used as reference
   substance, administered i.c. after pre-incubation with the scrapie
   inoculum, was strongly effective in slowing the progression of the
   infection, while both CR-A and CR-B, administered alone or
   together,,were not effective. Both CR-A and CR, when administered by
   subcutaneous route in i.c. scrapie-infected animals, prolonged the
   survival time in comparison to controls; CR-B was not effective.
   Moreover, both CR and CR-A were very effective in prolonging the
   survival time of i.p. scrapie-infected hamsters.
   The hypothesis of possible different mechanisms of interaction between
   CR or CR-A and the scrapie agent related to the chemical structures of
   the molecules is discussed.},

Abstract = {Bluetongue (131) first affected Sardinia in August 2000, spreading
   rapidly across the island causing more than 6 000 outbreaks and
   significant economic damage. Culicoides imicola Kieffer (Diptera:
   Ceratopogoilidae) was the main vector of the disease and was also found
   to be the most abundant Culicoides species on Sardirna. During 2002, a
   field trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of an insecticide on
   local Culicoides populations in north-western Sardinia. A synthetic
   pyrethroid derivative (Mycrocip, ICF, Cremona, Italy) was used on two
   farms where outbreaks of BT had been reported; a third farm was used as
   control. The same treatment was repeated after 15 days. For the
   collection of Culicoides, two blacklight traps were placed on each farm
   and operated every second day for two weeks before and after insecticide
   treatment. Insect collections and data analyses were performed in
   accordance with the protocols of the Italian National Reference Centre
   for Exotic Diseases (CESME: Centro Studi Malattie Esoticbe). For each
   collection, the total number of insects, Culicoides spp. and C imicola
   was determined. A slight decrease in the number of Culicoides collected
   on treated farms was recorded for only a few days after treatment.
   Mycrocip played a secondary role in suppressing insect numbers, but did
   not reduce the number of Culicoides. Indeed, periodic variations of
   Culicoides population sizes correlated with significant changes in
   weather conditions that prevailed, including oscillating temperatures,
   winds and relative humidity.},

Abstract = {Between July and September 2002, bluetongue (BT) virus (BTV) serotypes 2
   and 9 caused mortalities amongst sheep in the communities of San
   Gregorio Magno (Salerno, Campania), Laviano (Salerno, Campania) and
   Carpino (Foggia, Puglia), central Italy. On three of the affected farms,
   approximately 10 000 specimens of Culicoides were captured, representing
   fifteen species. Not a single specimen of the classical Afro-Asiatic BT
   vector, C. imicola Kieffer, was found; species of the Obsoletus Complex
   dominated the light-trap collections (90\%) and included C. obsoletus
   (Meigen), C. scoticus Downes and Kettle and C. dewulfi Goetghebuer.
   Fifty-eight pools of the Obsoletus Complex (excluding C. dewulfi), each
   numbering 100 individuals per pool, and containing only parous and
   gravid females, were assayed for virus. BTV serotype 2 (BTV-2) was
   isolated from three pools (San Gregorio and Carpino) and BTV-9 from one
   (Laviano). These results indicate clearly that a species other than C.
   imicola is involved in the current re-emergence of BT in the
   Mediterranean Basin, but whether this is only C. obsoletus sensu
   stricto, or only C. scoticus, or both together, has vet to be
   established.},

Abstract = {During the epidemic of bluetonge (BT) in Lazio and Tuscany between 2001
   and 2003, the distribution pattern of Culicoides imicola did not always
   correspond either geographically or seasonally, with virus circulation.
   Culicoides obsoletus was observed to be abundant, ubiquitous and active
   throughout the year. The geographical and seasonal distribution of BT
   virus (BTV), C. imicola and C. obsoletus was compared. The territory of
   the two regions was divided into 30 cells each measuring 1 600 km(2).
   The presence of C obsoletus was recorded in every cell, while C. imicola
   was detected in 18 of the 30 cells, but was absent in 6 of the 21 cells
   that indicated the presence of BTV. The Occurrence of seroconversions
   appeared to be positively correlated with maximum C. olsoletus catches.
   Seroconversions were recorded throughout the year, even when C. imicola
   was not active, whereas C. obsoletus was detected during the entire
   period. The occurrence of BTV circulation in areas and periods where C.
   imicola was absent, and the abundant and constant presence of adult C.
   obsoletus in all the cells, suggest the active role of the latter
   species in BTV circulation in central Italy.},

Abstract = {Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae is a malacosporean parasite causing
   Proliferative Kidney Disease (PKD) of salmonids, which develops in a
   sac-shaped phase producing infective spores in freshwater bryozoans.
   From 2001-2003, several samples of bryozoans were collected along the
   Sile River (Treviso Province, northern Italy) from sites which are in
   close communication with two trout farms where PKD is enzootic. All the
   colonies found were observed under a stereomicroscope in search of T
   bryosalmonae and to isolate statoblasts. The bryozoans were classified
   by studying the superficial microarchitecture of the statoblasts using a
   scanning electron microscope (SEM). The following species were
   identified: Cristatella mucedo, Fredericella sultana, Plumatella
   casmiana, P. emarginata, P. fungosa, P. repens, P. reticulata, R rugosa,
   and F similirepens. Developmental stages of T bryosalmonae were never
   found in the colonies. In 11 out of 40 R fungosa floatoblasts, treated
   with KOH for SEM study, vermiform structures of 0.5-8 mm in length were
   observed. The possibility that these structures could represent the
   vermiform phase of T bryosalmonae with a developmental stage similar to
   those described for Buddenbrockia plumatellae is discussed.},

Abstract = {Parasitic gastroenteritis is one of the major causes of productivity
   loss in sheep and goats. This report records two studies of the helminth
   fauna from post-mortem examination. The first study, performed on the
   digestive tract of 72 sheep from a central part of Sicily in a high hill
   village (1,360 meters above sea level), between April 1996 and March
   1997, showed an infection rate of 78\%. The second study targeted goats
   from the western part of Sicily and showed an infection rate of 90\%.
   For sheep, a total of 23 species of helminths were identified belonging
   to the family of Trichostrongyloidea, with the genera Haemonchus,
   Ostertagia (Teladorsagia), Trichostrongylus, Cooperia, and Nematodirus;
   Strongilolidea with the genera Oesophagostomum and Chabertia:
   Ancylostomidea with Bunostomum; and Tricuridea with Tricuris.
   Teladorsagia circumcincta was the most common in the sheep abomasum,
   Bunostomum trigonocephalum and Trichostrongylus spp. in the small
   intestine, and Chabertia ovina and Trichuris ovis in the large
   intestine. For goats, a total of 12 species were isolated in the
   abomasum with Teladorsagia circumcincta and Trichostrongylus axei the
   most common species. In the small intestine, five species were isolated
   and Trichostrongylus capricola was the dominant species. T ovis and O.
   venulosum were dominant in large intestine and in the cecum. We also
   found species belonging to other ruminants such as O. ostertagi (in
   cattle) and S. kolchida and O. leptospicularis (in wild ruminants).},

Abstract = {Parasitic egg production was studied in sheep and goats affected by
   parasitic gastroenteritis. The herds studied were located at different
   altitudes and in different climatic conditions. Samples were taken every
   month and the number of eggs per grams of feces was calculated.
   Observation of preliminary data shows that the maximum peak of egg
   production was during the winter period, whereas in other countries
   winter is a period of hypobiosis. This study shows that understanding
   peak time of infection related to different climatic and environmental
   conditions will help improve anthelminthic treatments and animal health
   strategies.},

Abstract = {Leishmaniasis is a typical example of a worldwide diffused zoonosis.
   Geographic distribution depends on the presence of sand fly vectors and
   animal reservoirs. In Southern Europe, canines are considered the main
   reservoir of infection, and the phlebotomines are the vectors. In
   Sicily, as in all Mediterranean areas, sand flies are present almost all
   year around because the climate permits an uninterrupted lifecycle for
   the vectors. Visceral leishmaniasis is becoming a real public health
   concern especially in endemic areas; in fact, it is an opportunistic
   infection in immunocompromised patients and in HIV-positive subjects. In
   Italy, the visceral form of the disease is due exclusively to Leishmania
   infantum ZMON1, and its prevalence is growing. We have developed a
   highly accurate, reproducible, and sensible real-time polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) assay. In a procedure that used a specific couple of
   primers, a 117-bp fragment was amplified from minicircle kinetoplast DNA
   (kDNA). The assay was able to detect even a single parasite (200 fg of
   DNA). In fact, a single parasite contains hundreds of kinetoplast
   minicircles for each class. We applied a rapid extraction method coupled
   with the real-time PCR assay. It was not only as sensitive as a
   conventional PCR assay for detection of Leishmania kDNA, but also more
   rapid. The assay is useful for the diagnosis of leishmaniasis in dogs
   and humans, and it facilitates the monitoring of parasite levels during
   pharmacological treatment.},

Abstract = {The biting midge Culicoides imicola Kieffer (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae)
   is the most important Old World vector of African horse sickness (AHS)
   and bluetongue (BT). Recent increases of BT incidence in the
   Mediterranean basin are attributed to its increased abundance and
   distribution. The phylogenetic status and genetic structure of C.
   imicola in this region are unknown, despite the importance of these
   aspects for BT epidemiology in the North American BT vector. In this
   study, analyses of partial mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I
   gene (COI) sequences were used to infer phylogenetic relationships among
   50 C. imicola from Portugal, Rhodes, Israel, and South Africa and four
   other species of the Imicola Complex from southern Africa, and to
   estimate levels of matrilineal subdivision in C. imicola between
   Portugal and Israel. Eleven haplotypes were detected in C. imicola, and
   these formed one well-supported clade in maximum likelihood and Bayesian
   trees implying that the C. imicola samples comprise one phylogenetic
   species. Molecular variance was distributed mainly between Portugal and
   Israel, with no haplotypes shared between these countries, suggesting
   that female-mediated gene flow at this scale has been either limited or
   non-existent. Our results provide phylogenetic evidence that C. imicola
   in the study areas are potentially competent AHS and BT vectors. The
   geographical structure of the C. imicola COI haplotypes was concordant
   with that of BT virus serotypes in recent BT outbreaks in the
   Mediterranean basin, suggesting that population subdivision in its
   vector can impose spatial constraints on BT virus transmission.},

Abstract = {Following the first incursion of bluetongue virus (BTV) into Italy, the
   geographical and seasonal distribution of the biting midge Culicoides
   imicola Kieffer (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae), the main vector of BTV and
   African horse sickness virus, was investigated in two regions of central
   Italy (Lazio and Tuscany). Surveillance of Culicoides was carried out
   between July 2001 and December 2002 using light traps: 1917 collections
   were made in 381 trap sites, well distributed across both regions.
   During the survey, bluetongue outbreaks were recorded in both regions.
   Culicoides imicola was found in 89 (23\%) trap sites, distributed fairly
   continuously along the whole western coastline, between 41.2697degrees N
   and 44.05724degrees N. It was found only occasionally inland and usually
   in low abundance, with catches of more than 1000 specimens per night
   found in only two sample sites and 74\% of catches numbering fewer than
   10 specimens. Adults were caught from March to mid December, with peaks
   ranging from the end of August to mid November. The coastal distribution
   and the presence of only few sites with year-round records of adult
   vectors suggests that colonization may have occurred recently, by
   passive wind-dispersal from external source areas (Sardinia and
   Corsica). Alternatively, the species may occur in established,
   previously undetected, autochthonous populations that are limited from
   extension inland and northern-ward within Lazio and Tuscany by cool
   winter temperatures.},

Abstract = {In the last twenty years there has been an increase in the interest by
   equine ophthalmologists concerning keratomycosis in horses, even though
   today it is still considered a high risk sight threatening disease. The
   abovementioned pathology, widely described by American and British
   authors, is well known in countries characterized by a warm-humid
   climate. Nevertheless in our country there are no bibliographic
   references available in regard to this pathology. In this article 13
   clinical cases of keratomycosis collected from field experiences between
   1998 and 2002 are described with particular attention to pathogenesis,
   clinical presentation diagnosis, laboratory findings medical and
   surgical management and visual function outcome.},

Abstract = {A serological survey of respiratory virus infections was carried out
   from 1998 to 2001 in Lecco province, Italy, as part of a health
   monitoring programme in a population of alpine chamois, many of which
   died of pneumonia in autumn and winter 2000 to 2001; 194 carcases of all
   age classes were found over a short period and in a small area. Eighteen
   of them, which were examined postmortem, consistently showed signs of
   severe fibrinous lobar pneumonia or catarrhal bronchopneumonia. Samples
   of serum from 145 chamois collected from hunted animals and carcases
   were tested by a virus neutralisation test against bovine respiratory
   syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine viral diarrhoea virus, bovine herpesvirus
   type 1 and parainfluenzavirus type 3. Positive results were detected
   only for BRSV. The area was divided into two subunits on the basis of
   the distribution of deaths; in the areas where fatalities were observed
   there was a significant increase Of BRSV titres at the beginning of the
   outbreak. Furthermore, during the 2000 and 2001 hunting seasons antibody
   titres to BRSV were significantly higher in the areas where mortality
   occurred. The roe deer living in the same area were not affected by
   pneumonia and had a low prevalence of titres to BRSV which did not vary
   during the period of the study.},

Abstract = {Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is known to be associated with
   post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), a recently described
   disease of young pigs. Since no PCV2 vaccine was available so far, we
   have developed a specific PCV2 vaccine candidate. The Orf1-encoded
   replication protein and Orf2-encoded capsid protein of PCV2 were
   expressed and detected in either mammalian or insect expression systems.
   In a first trial, Orf2 protein was found to be a major immunogen,
   inducing protection in a prime-boost protocol; the piglets received a
   first injection with plasmids directing Orf2 protein and
   granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) expression,
   followed by a second injection, a fortnight later, associated with
   baculovirus-expressed Orf2 protein. As evaluated by growth parameters,
   clinical signs (fever), seroconversion, the pigs were protected against
   a PCV2 challenge after vaccination. In a second trial, protection
   induced by a subunit vaccine was even better than the one induced by DNA
   vaccine, since PCV2 replication was completely inhibited. (C) 2003

Abstract = {During the period 1999-2002, we have analyzed 9639 serum samples and 815
   aborted samples (670 fetuses and 145 placenta) from 964 ovine and
   caprine farms distributed over all Sardinia island. After abortion
   notification, sera collected at random from adult animals were examined
   to detect simultaneously IgG and IgM antibodies specific to Toxoplasma
   gondii by indirect immunofluorescence assay, whereas fetuses and
   placenta were analyzed by a single tube nested PCR assay. Specific IgG
   antibodies were detected in 2048 (28.4\%) sheep and 302 (12.3\%) goats,
   specific IgM antibodies were found in 652 (9\%) sheep and 139 (5.6\%)
   goats. From a total of 2471 ovine and 362 caprine fetal samples
   including muscle, liver, abomasum, spleen, brain and placenta, 271
   (11.1\%) ovine and 23 (6.4\%) caprine samples were T gondii
   PCR-positive. Although T gondii DNA was amplified from different types
   of tissues, placenta was the tissue with the highest detection rate. On
   the one hand, these results indicate that the seroprevalence of T gondii
   infection in sheep and goats is relatively high, on the other PCR
   results demonstrate that T gondii has a significant role in ovine and
   caprine abortion. Adequate management might be useful and essential to
   control the toxoplasmosis in the sheep and goats herds of Sardinia. (C)

Abstract = {The aims of the study were to monitor sheep iodine intake in different
   sheep breeding farms in Abruzzo and to evaluate the effects of iodine
   supplementation on ovine fertility. The urinary iodine concentrations
   (UIC) in animals of 8 out of the 11 breeding farms analyzed were
   borderline (UIC 100-150 mug/l) or very low (UIC < 50 mug/l). Only
   animals bred in 3 farms showed an adequate iodine intake with a mean UIC
   greater than or equal to 300 mug/l. Animals with very low iodine intake
   had lower T-4 and T-3 (P < 0.01) serum levels, compared to those with
   adequate iodine intake. To investigate the effects of iodine
   supplementation on ovine fertility, 32 ewes and 20 rams, characterized
   by low UIC, were randomly divided into 2 groups. One group (116 ewes and
   10 rams) received a sc injection of 1 ml of Lipiodol, containing 480 mg
   of iodine, while the remaining animals were employed as control. This
   treatment was able to maintain UIC above 300 mug/1 for 3 months and to
   increase T-4 and T-3 serum levels (p < 0.01). After 9 months, the
   fertility of control and treated animals was assessed by monitoring the
   rate of successful matings by ultrasonography.
   The results showed that 100\% of treated ewes mated with treated rams
   were pregnant vs 37\% of the control ewes mated with control rams (p =
   0.007). The iodine content was 4-fold higher in milk from treated ewes
   (2393 +/- 453 mug/l), compared to controls (675 +/- 154 mug/l). The
   results demonstrated that iodine supplementation restores fertility of
   sheep living in iodine deficient areas and may represent a means to
   achieve a silent iodine prophylaxis of local populations. (C) 2003,

Abstract = {Three recombinant antigens of Leishmania chagasi (= L. infantum) were
   expressed in prokaryotic systems and evaluated (using a panel of dog
   sera characterized by parasitological and serological immunofluorescent
   antibody test {[}IFAT] techniques) as diagnostic markers of infection.
   The whole open reading frame encoding K9, the gene fragment encoding the
   repetitive sequence of K26, and the 3'-terminal gene fragment encoding a
   single 39-amino-acid subunit of the kinesin-related protein K39 (K39sub)
   were amplified from L. infantum DNA and cloned into a pGEX-2T expression
   vector in frame with glutathione S-transferase (GST). The sensitivity
   and specificity of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) using K26
   as an antigen (evaluated with sera from 20 parasitologically positive
   and 20 parasitologically negative dogs) were both 100\% (95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] = 83.2 to 100). When K9 and K39sub were used,
   sensitivity was 95\% (95\% CI = 75.1 to 99.9) and specificity was 100\%
   (95\% CI = 83.2 to 100). Using 182 field sera, a good agreement was
   found between the recombinant K26 ELISA and IFAT (K = 0.92; 95\% CI =
   0.86 to 0.98) results and between the K9 and K39sub ELISA (used in
   parallel) and IFAT (K = 0.87; 95\% CI = 0.80 to 0.95) results. The
   results demonstrate that each antigen carries immunodominant epitopes
   and that their combination may further increase the sensitivity of
   currently available serological tests.},

Abstract = {Sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma is an uncommon tumour in human beings,
   and osteogenic differentiation is a rare feature. This report describes
   such a case in a male dog aged 8 years. The tumour, which showed
   extensive osseous metaplasia and a few necrotic areas, protruded into
   the renal pelvis, disrupting the renal capsule. Light microscopical and
   immunohistochemical examination revealed the epithelial nature of the
   tumour. Abnormal liver biochemistry, mild hepatocyte degeneration and
   the absence of histological evidence of metastasis suggested a
   paraneoplastic hepatopathy. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {27},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {A non-cytopathic strain of BVDV-2 was isolated from a batch of live
   infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) vaccine, and inoculated
   intranasally into four 3-month-old calves. Severe signs of disease
   developed by days 4 and 6 in three of the calves, free of BVDV and
   antibodies to BVDV, that had been exposed to the virus. These calves
   survived the acute phase of the infection and progressively recovered.
   BVDV was consistently isolated, or the respective viral RNA was
   detected, in the huffy coats from blood samples collected starting from
   days 2 or 4 up to days 11 or 14 after the experimental infection. Viral
   RNA was also detected in sera from these infected calves until the
   presence in the serum of virus neutralizing antibodies was demonstrated.
   By contrast, the only calf having pre-existing neutralizing antibodies
   to BVDV at the start of the study was protected from the disease. No
   virus was detected at any time after experimental inoculation of this
   calf. Genomic characterization of the BVDV-2 isolated in cell cultures,
   or detected in sera from the experimentally infected animals, revealed
   100\% homology in the nucleotide sequence with the BVDV-2 detected as a
   contaminant of the live IBR virus vaccine. These findings provided
   evidence of the infective nature of the contaminant BVDV 2 and of its
   potential to generate disease outbreaks when inoculated into susceptible
   animals.},

Abstract = {A total of 78 female and male Nero Siciliano pigs were used. Forty-one
   pigs were reared following the traditional management system, 37 pigs
   were reared in pens with a small outdoor paddock and fed to appetite
   using commercial rations according to the growing period. Both male and
   female pigs were castrated. All pigs were weighed and measured
   periodically. Body measurements included height at withers, chest girth,
   body length, width at shoulders and at rump. Age and body weight at
   slaughter ranged respectively from 371 to 572 days and from 79 to 113
   kg. The carcasses were weighed and dissected into lean, fat and bone
   cuts. In the early and final stages indoor-pigs grew faster than those
   reared outdoors. Trends in body length were similar for the two rearing
   systems, for width at shoulders and rump, chest girth and height at
   withers, indoor pigs showed higher values than the outdoor ones.
   Carcasses of similar weight were longer in outdoor than in indoor pigs
   but the latter showed greater subcutaneous fat thickness. Outdoor pigs
   had the lowest dressing percentage and the highest percentage of lean
   cuts, such as shoulder and ham, but not of neck and loin. Sex did not
   significantly affect the analysed characteristics. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {The genotype of the host plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of
   transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). In this respect, the
   most important factor is represented by the gene of the prion protein
   (PrP). The present work summarizes the currently available knowledge on
   the genetic basis of TSEs focusing, in particular, on sheep scrapie.
   Interest in this disease has grown markedly following the discovery of
   bovine spongiform encephalopathy, both for scientific and health
   reasons. In Italy, specific research grants from the Ministry of Health
   and the National Research Council (CNR), together with cooperation
   between the Istituto Superiore di Sanit and the Istituti Zooprofilattici
   Sperimentali, have allowed us to study the PrP genotype and to
   investigate the genetic susceptibility to scrapie in the most important
   Italian sheep breeds, with special reference to Sarda, Comisana and
   Massese. The PrP genotype in relation to scrapie susceptibility was also
   studied in goats of lonica breed.},

Abstract = {Many media have been developed to enumerate Clostridium perfringens from
   foods. In this study, six media {[}iron sulfite (IS) agar, tryptose
   sulfite cycloserine (TSC) agar, Shahidi Ferguson perfringens (SFP) agar,
   sulfite cycloserine azide (SCA), differential clostridial agar (DCA),
   and oleandomycin polymyxin sulfadiazine perfringens (OPSP) agar] were
   compared in a prestudy, of which four (IS, TSC, SCA, and DCA) were
   selected for an international collaborative trial. Recovery of 15 pure
   strains was tested in the prestudy and recovery of one strain from
   foodstuffs was tested in the collaborative trial. Results from the
   prestudy did reveal statistical difference of the media but recoveries
   on all media were within the microbiological limits (+/- 30\%) of IS,
   which was set as a reference medium. Recoveries on the media tested in
   the collaborative trial were statistically different as well, but these
   differences were of no microbiological-analytical relevance. Food
   matrices did not affect the recovery of C perfringens in general. DCA
   and SCA, in particular, are labor-intensive to prepare and DCA
   frequently failed to produce black colonies; gray colonies were quite
   common. Since IS medium is nonselective, it was concluded that TSC was
   the most favorable medium for the enumeration of C. perfringens from
   foods. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Infectious diseases represent a limiting factor for the further
   development of Italian aquaculture. The recent introduction and
   spreading of new pathogens, along with the global climatic change, has
   contributed to a considerable decrease in trout production. Emerging
   pathologies in rainbow trout culture include viral diseases, e.g.
   infectious haematopoietic necrosis (IHN), bacteria] diseases, such as
   lactococcosis and visceral flavobacteriosis, and parasitical diseases,
   e.g. proliferative kidney disease (PKD). Higher mortality rates in trout
   fry and fingerlings are generally induced by visceral flavobacteriosis
   and IHN, while the main losses in large trout during the warm season are
   due to lactococcosis and PKD. Mariculture has at present a better
   sanitary status compared to trout culture, but a rapid dissemination of
   pathogens, including zoonosis agents, is envisaged also for scabass and
   seabream. Emerging pathologies in sea bass include VNN,
   pseudotuberculosis, streptococcosis and tuberculosis. Seabream is much
   more resistant and is mainly affected by novel Vibrio infections and
   enteromyxidiosis. A good sanitary management of fish farms is essential
   for avoiding or limiting losses caused by emerging pathologies.
   Transmission of zoonosis agents to man, through the consumption of
   cultured fish, is very remote in Italy. On the contrary, transmission of
   Streptococcus iniae, Vibrio vulnificus and Mycobacterium marinum by
   means of improper manipulation of infected fish, could represent a
   potential hazard for fish farmers and fish processors, as well as for
   people preparing fish meals.},

Abstract = {Concerns have been raised about the possibility that the bovine
   spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) agent could have been transmitted to
   sheep populations via contaminated feedstuffs. The objective of our
   study was to investigate the suitability of molecular strain typing
   methods as a surveillance tool for studying scrapie strain variations
   and for differentiating PrPSc from sheep scrapie, BSE, and sheep BSE. We
   studied 38 Italian sheep scrapie cases from 13 outbreaks, along with a
   British scrapie case, an experimental ovine BSE, and 3 BSE cases, by
   analyzing the glycoform patterns and the apparent molecular masses of
   the nonglycosylated forms of semipurified, proteinase-treated PrPSc.
   Both criteria were able to clearly differentiate sheep scrapie from BSE
   and ovine experimental BSE. PrPSc from BSE and sheep BSE showed a higher
   glycoform ratio and a lower molecular mass of the nonglycosylated form
   compared to scrapie PrPSc. Scrapie cases displayed homogeneous PrPSc
   features regardless of breed, Hock, and geographic origin. The glycoform
   patterns observed varied with the antibody used, but either a monoclonal
   antibody (MAb) (F99/97.6.1) or a polyclonal antibody (P7-7) was able to
   distinguish scrapie from BSE PrPSc. While more extensive surveys are
   needed to further corroborate these findings, our results suggest that
   large-scale molecular screening of sheep populations for BSE
   surveillance may be eventually possible.},

Title = {Phylogenetic and evolutionary relationship among torovirus field
   variants: Evidence for multiple intertypic recombination events},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {77},
Number = {17},
Pages = {9567-9577},

Abstract = {Toroviruses (family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales) are enveloped,
   positive-stranded RNA viruses that have been implicated in enteric
   disease in cattle and possibly in humans. Despite their potential
   veterinary and clinical relevance, little is known about torovirus
   epidemiology and molecular genetics. Here, we present the first study
   into the diversity among toroviruses currently present in European swine
   and cattle herds. Comparative sequence analysis was performed focusing
   on the genes for the structural proteins S, M, HE, and N, with fecal
   specimens serving as sources of viral RNA. Sequence data published for
   animal and human torovirus variants were included. Four genotypes,
   displaying 30 to 40\% divergence, were readily distinguished,
   exemplified by bovine torovirus (BToV) Breda, porcine torovirus (PToV)
   Markelo, equine torovirus Berne, and the putative human torovirus. The
   ungulate toroviruses apparently display host species preference. In
   phylogenetic analyses, all PToV variants clustered, while the recent
   European BToVs mostly resembled the New World BToV variant Breda,
   identified 19 years ago. However, we found ample evidence for recurring
   intertypic recombination. All newly characterized BToV variants seem to
   have arisen from a genetic exchange, during which the 3' end of the HE
   gene, the N gene, and the 3' nontranslated region of a Breda virus-like
   parent had been swapped for those of PToV. Moreover, some PToV and BToV
   variants carried chimeric HE genes, which apparently resulted from
   recombination events involving hitherto unknown toroviruses. From these
   observations, the existence of two additional torovirus genotypes can be
   inferred. Toroviruses may be even more promiscuous than their closest
   relatives, the coronaviruses and arteriviruses.},

Abstract = {From December 1999 to December 2000, 150 pigs were randomly selected in
   two large abattoirs of northern Italy. Caecal material and carcass swabs
   were collected and examined for Salmonella, Yersinia enterocolitica, and
   Escherichia coli O157. Tonsils were examined for Salmonella and Y
   enterocolitica. Salmonella was isolated from the intestinal content of
   55 (36.7\%) specimens, from 8 (5.3\%) tonsils, and from 9 (6.0\%)
   carcasses. Ten different serotypes were detected; the more common were
   Salmonella derby (37.8\%), Salmonella bredeney (21.6\%), and Salmonella
   typhimurium (14.8\%). S. typhimurium isolates that belonged to
   phage-types DT104 and DT208 were 45\% and 27.3\%, respectively; 18.2\%
   belonged to U302 and 9.1\% were nontypeable. Y enterocolitica was
   detected in the intestinal matter of 6 (4.0\%) slaughtered pigs and in
   22 (14.7\%) tonsils; however, this pathogen was not found on carcasses.
   The majority of Y enterocolitica isolates (82.1\%) belonged to serotype
   0:3 biotype 4, one (3.6\%) belonged to serotype 0:9, and 13\% did not
   belong to any known biotype. Verocytotoxin-producing E. coli (VTEC) O157
   was isolated from the intestinal content of one (0.7\%) slaughtered pig
   and from one (0.7\%) carcass; four (2.7\%) faecal samples contained E.
   coli O157 strains negative for the presence of both eae and VT genes.

   in vitro with a range of MIC values from 0.125 to 0.500 mug/ml and an
   MIC50 of 0.203 and MIC90 of 0.365 mug/ml. Using the MIC50 and MIC90
   values the remaining four antimicrobials are ranked in order of in vitro
   effectiveness as follows: tylosin (MIC50 0.292; MIC50 0.525 mug/ml) was
   slightly more effective than tetracycline (MIC50 0.296; MIC90 0.533

Abstract = {Treating the crude chromatin fraction of wheat seed (Triticum aestivum
   L.) with alkali and methanol solubilizes several small phosphorylated
   peptides and a protein fraction, which is almost pure in native and
   SDS-PAGE analysis. The protein material is composed of two polypeptides,
   which can be easily separated in PAGE in the presence of 8 M urea, 1 mM
   2-mercaptoethanol, 5\% (v/v) acetic acid (pH 4.5) and 0.1 (\%) v/v
   Triton X-100. N-terminal sequence analysis revealed that the two
   polypeptides have sequences that are identical to that of the secreted
   form of the so-called wheat seed CM2 and CM3 proteins, respectively,
   belonging to the alpha-amylase inhibitor superfamily. Their inhibitory
   activity has been determined in vitro using human salivary amylase and
   bovine pancreatic trypsin. Immumoblotting experiments, carried out with
   an antiserum raised in rabbit and which recognizes both CM2 and CM3
   proteins, indicate that the protein is mainly expressed in seeds rather
   than in roots and coleoptiles. In addition, western blotting analysis of
   protein extracted from highly purified wheat seed chromatin preparation
   revealed immumoreactivity at the level of the CM2/CM3 protein bands. The
   possible function of these proteins at the chromatin level has been
   investigated using gel shift assay and the effect on RNA transcription
   in vitro. The results indicate that the CM2/CM3 protein binds DNA and
   inhibits in vitro RNA transcription, suggesting that the protein has a
   role in the control of the chromatin activity. (C) 2003 Editions

Abstract = {A 1999 study heightened long-standing concerns over persistent organic
   pollutant contamination in the Aral Sea area, detecting elevated levels
   in breast milk and cord blood of women in Karakalpakstan (western
   Uzbekistan). These findings prompted a collaborative research study
   aimed at linking such human findings with evidence of food chain
   contamination in the area. An international team carried out analyses of
   organochlorine and organophosphate pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls
   (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), and polychlorinated
   dibenzofurans (PCDFs) on samples of 12 foods commonly produced and
   consumed in Karakalpakstan. Analysis consistently detected long-lasting
   organochlorine pesticides and their metabolites in all foods of animal
   origin and in some vegetables such as onions and carrots-two low-cost
   components of many traditional dishes. Levels of PCBs were relatively
   low in all samples except fish. Analyses revealed high levels of PCDDs
   and PCDFs (together often termed ``dioxins{''}) in sheep fat, dairy
   cream, eggs, and edible cottonseed oil, among other foodstuffs. These
   findings indicate that food traditionally grown, sold, and consumed in
   Karakalpakstan is a major route of human exposure to several persistent
   toxic contaminants, including the most toxic of dioxins,
   2,3,7,8-tefrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD). Intake estimations
   demonstrate that consumption of even small amounts of locally grown food
   may expose consumers to dioxin levels that considerably exceed the
   monthly tolerable dioxin intake levels set by the World Health
   Organization. Data presented in this study allow a first assessment of
   the risk associated with the consumption of ` certain food products in
   Karakalpakstan and highlight a critical public health situation.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was the investigation of hormonal and ovarian
   follicular dynamics in prepuberal buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) bred in
   Italy. Eleven 5-9-month old buffalo calves ranging in weight from 122 to
   270 kg, maintained under controlled nutritional and environmental
   conditions, underwent 50 days of ultrasonographic ovarian follicular
   monitoring in the months of October-December. Blood sampling for E-2 and
   FSH determination and ultrasonographic monitoring using a 7.5 MHz linear
   probe and an wALOKA SSD-500 monitor were performed daily. No differences
   in any of the parameters under study were highlighted when calves were
   divided into two weight categories (<200 and >200 kg) and thus data were
   pooled. In this study, values are reported as mean +/- S.D. A range of
   two-six regular follicular waves was reported among calves with an
   average of 4 +/- 1.1. Overall interval (days) between wave emergence was
   9.9 +/- 2.8 and largest diameters (mm) of dominant and first subordinate
   follicles were 8.4 +/- 1.2 and 4.8 +/- 0.6, respectively (P < 0.05).
   With the exception of one calf, some minor follicular waves (short waves
   or SWs; 1.6 +/- 1), lasting <10 days (6.1 +/- 1.2) were reported. They
   were monitored contemporaneously on the ovary contralateral (n = 7) or
   ipsilateral (n = 3) to the main follicular wave. Growth rate (mm per
   day) of dominant follicles (DF) was significantly faster than for
   corresponding subordinate follicles (SF) and follicles of SWs (1.08 +/-
   0.2 versus 0.79 +/- 0.1 and 0.83 +/- 0.1, respectively, P < 0.05). The
   static phase (days) lasted longer in DF compared to SF and SW (5.4 +/-
   1.8 versus 2.4 +/- 1.2 and 2.6 +/- 1, respectively, P < 0.05). The
   regressing phase (mm per day) was similar among DF, SF and SW (0.86 +/-
   0.2, 0.94 +/- 0.2 and 0.84 +/- 0. 1, respectively, P = 0.09). Episodic
   spikes of E-2 and FSH were reported, corresponding to wave development
   throughout the course of investigation. In conclusion, the majority of
   buffalo calves displayed a typical pattern of regular follicular
   development in conjunction with a dynamic trend of ovarian and
   hypophyseal hormones. Some minor follicle turnover was reported with
   parallel main follicular waves. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All

Abstract = {Fifteen fibrosarcomas, surgically excised from presumed sites of
   injection in dogs, and 10 canine fibrosarcomas excised from sites not
   used for injection were histologically and immuno-histochemically
   compared with 20 feline post-vaccinal fibrosarcomas. Canine
   fibrosarcomas from presumed injection sites were of grade 1 (3), of
   grade 11 (4) and grade 111 (8). Two fibrosarcomas from non-injection
   sites were of grade I, four of grade II and four of grade III. Feline
   samples were classified as grade 1 (2), grade 11 (4) and grade 111 (14).
   All fibrosarcomas from presumed injection sites of both species showed
   lymphocytic inflammatory infiltration located at the tumour periphery,
   while two canine fibrosarcomas from non-injection sites showed
   perivascular inflammatory infiltration within the neoplasm. All samples
   were immunohistochemically examined for vimentin, smooth muscle actin,
   muscle specific actin and desmin expression. All tumours were positive
   for vimentin. Ten canine fibrosarcomas from presumed injection sites and
   all feline samples contained cells consistent with a myofibroblastic
   immunophenotype. Aluminium deposits were detected in eight canine
   fibrosarcomas from presumed injection sites and 11 feline post-vaccinal
   fibrosarcomas by the aurintricarboxylic acid method. The present study
   identifies distinct similarities between canine fibrosarcomas from
   presumed injection sites and feline post-vaccinal fibrosarcomas,
   suggesting the possibility of the development of post-injection sarcomas
   not only in cats, but also in dogs.},

Abstract = {A geographic information system and K-function analysis were used to
   evaluate the spatial association of canine serological results for
   Rickettsia conorii, the causative agent of Mediterranean spotted fever
   (MSF), and clinical cases of MSF in humans in Piemonte, northwest Italy.
   The residences of dog owners were clustered in two rural villages in the
   province of Cuneo, where two human cases of MSF occurred in 1997 and
   1998. Eighteen out of 116 dogs examined were positive by indirect
   immunofluorescent assay (IFA+, titre greater than or equal to 1:160) for
   MSF. K-functions were compared for IFA+ dogs and for all dogs sampled.
   Monte Carlo and bootstrap simulations demonstrated that clustering of
   IFA+ dogs was significantly greater than clustering of all dogs, at
   distances of less than 0.6 km from human cases of MSF. Logistic
   regression analysis indicated that the risk of being IFA+ was highest
   for dogs residing within the first quartile of distance (0.7 km) from
   human cases of the disease, and for dogs that were not confined.
   However, year and season of blood collection were not associated with
   IFA status. It was concluded that a relatively high dog population
   density along with a rural or semi-rural environment favours the
   occurrence of emergent foci of MSF in the province of Cuneo. (C) 2003

Abstract = {The vectors of bluetongue virus are certain species of Culicoides biting
   midges, and in the Mediterranean area Culicoides imicola has long been
   considered to be the only field vector. in Sicily an entomological and
   serological surveillance programme has been in operation since the
   autumn of 2000, which has shown that the prevalence and abundance of C
   imicola is lower than in many other Italian regions. Moreover, in 2002,
   there were outbreaks of bluetongue in the absence of C imicola, and in
   these regions bluetongue viral RNA was detected by means of a nested
   reverse-transcriptase PCR in wild-caught, non-blood-engorged, parous
   Culicoides pulicaris. Furthermore, bluetongue virus serotype 2 was
   isolated on five occasions from extracts of non-blood-engorged parous C
   pulicaris by using-embryonated hens eggs and SHK-21 cells as assay
   systems. These findings suggest that in parts of Italy and possibly in
   other areas of Europe, where C imicola is absent or rare, C pulicaris
   may act as a fully competent vector of bluetongue virus.},

Title = {Systemic herpes-like virus in catfish Ictalurus melas (Italy) differs

Abstract = {A herpesvirus was isolated during 2 occurrences of mass mortality among
   adult catfish Ictalurus melas raised in different farms in northern
   Italy. The agent replicated in the channel catfish ovary (CCO) cell line
   from channel catfish I. punctatus, inducing a cytopathic effect similar
   to that caused by Ictalurid herpesvirus 1 (also referred to as channel
   catfish herpesvirus, CCV). The new herpesvirus, designated I. melas
   herpesvirus (IcmHV) did not react with polyclonal rabbit or monoclonal
   antibodies directed to CCV in either neutralization or indirect
   immunofluorescence assays. The virions of IcmHV possessed a hexagonal
   nucleocapsid of 107 nm in diameter surrounded by an envelope with a
   diameter of 227 nm (n = 20) typical for members of the family
   Herpesviridae. Virions of IcmHV purified from infected CCO cells
   contained 17 polypeptides ranging in size from 17.5 to 175 kDa and most
   differed in molecular weight from those found for CCV. The IcmHV was
   also distinct from CCV when compared by restriction fragment length
   polymorphisms (RFLP) of genomic DNA following digestions with the
   endonucleases Kpn I and Sac I. Lastly, the virulence of IcmHV for
   channel catfish fry and juveniles, respectively, was demonstrated by
   experimental infections induced by bath exposure or intraperitoneal
   injection that resulted in 78 to 96\% cumulative mortality in groups of
   exposed fish. Preventing the introduction of this agent into geographic
   regions where significant channel catfish production occurs should be a
   high priority.},

Year = {2003},
Volume = {94},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Mycobacterium bovis isolation on bacteriological media from suspected
   cases of bovine tuberculosis (TB) demands laborious and time-consuming
   procedures. Even polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and radiometric
   analyses are secondary procedures and not alternatives to
   bacteriological procedures. Therefore, there is a need to develop new
   techniques aimed at rapid M. bovis detection in diagnostic samples. The
   human macrophage cell line THP-1 was thus investigated in experiments of
   M. bovis propagation and isolation from reference lymph node
   suspensions. THP-1 cells were shown to support a high-titered
   propagation within 48 h of minute amounts of both M. bovis BCG and fully
   pathogenic M. bovis strain 503. A semi-nested PCR for TB-complex-
   specific insertion sequence IS6110 revealed M. bovis infection in THP-1
   cells. The same was true of a flow cytometry (FC) assay for expression
   of M. bovis chaperonin 10 in infected cells. The reduced time for
   isolation and identification of M. bovis (48-72 h) and the consistency
   of the test results make the use of macrophage cell cultures attractive
   and cost-effective for veterinary laboratories involved in TB
   surveillance. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Mercuric chloride (HgCl2) produces an acute renal failure in
   experimental animal models. Since the mechanism of tubular injury has
   not completely been clarified, this morpho-quantitative study was
   undertaken to better understand the effects of 2 sublethal doses (T1 = 1
   mg/kg and T3.5 = 3.5 mg/kg) of HgCl2 in rat proximal tubules.
   Morphometrical analysis was performed to quantify both cytoplasmic and
   nuclear changes found in treated in respect to saline-injected proximal
   tubules. In the controls, single-cell damage was occasional and
   nucleolar changes were absent. HgCl2 induced progressively severe
   proximal tubule atrophy. In the T1 group, necrosis was limited to pars
   recta cells and nucleolar segregation was often partial. In the T3.5
   group, atrophy was extensive in both convoluted and straight tracts, the
   nucleolus was completely segregated and coiled body-like inclusions were
   detached from it. Ultrastructural analysis confirmed dose-dependent
   changes within straight proximal tubules, i.e., necrosis, apoptosis,
   nucleolar segregation, swollen mitochondria, vacuolization, and
   disrupted brush border. In conclusion, in the rat kidney HgCl2 induced
   dose-dependent alterations not only in the cytoplasm but also in the
   nucleus of proximal tubule cells. These findings will be useful for
   better understanding of the pathogenesis of mercury nephrotoxicity and
   its genotoxic effect.},

Abstract = {A simple and rapid enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect
   rabies antibodies in field fox sera has been standardised and

   and reference serum neutralisation techniques (fluorescent antibody
   virus neutralisation (FAVN) test and rapid fluorescent focus inhibition
   test (RFFIT)). This indirect ELISA technique is highly correlated with
   conventional seroneutralisation test on cell culture. Results obtained
   with this ELISA test provide an almost perfect agreement between
   laboratories while the agreement of FAVN test and RFFIT results is
   substantial and very satisfactory. In view of this study, this simple
   and rapid ELISA test is a suitable tool for evaluating the
   sero-conversion rate in fox populations following oral rabies
   vaccination campaigns in European countries. (C) 2003 Published by

Abstract = {A procedure for the simultaneous determination of the residues of seven

   after centrifugation and filtration. The beta-lactams were separated
   using reversed-phase liquid chromatography. A triple quadrupole mass
   spectrometer was used in positive-ion mode as a detector via a Turbo
   Ionspray interface for electrospray ionization (ESI). The limits of
   detection and quantitation of the method were below the legal
   tolerances, except for ampicillin. The method was used to confirm 53
   samples found positive by a microbial method (Delvotest SP(R)) at the
   Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale per la Lombardia e l'Emilia
   Romagna of Brescia during 2001. Penicillin G was found in 26 samples at
   concentrations ranging from less than 4 to 6240 +/- 550 mug l(-1).
   Amoxicillin was found in three samples at concentrations ranging from
   8.5 +/- 0.1 to 53.7 +/- 2.3 mug l(-1). Cephapirin was found in two

Abstract = {We investigated wolf Canis lupus Linnaeus, 1758 food habits in central

   Road accident and illegal kills were main causes of the wolves' death.
   Ungulates represented the bulk of the diet (55\% in frequency), and
   among them wild boar was the most important prey, followed by domestic
   Caprinae. Food items of domestic origin accounted for about 1/3 of all
   the diet. Diet composition did not vary between stomachs and intestines
   in spite of the higher degree of digestion of the intestines' contents.
   The frequent detection of numerous larvae of Diptera and/or necrophagous
   Coleoptera, let suppose the consumption of already dead animals, and
   suggests a general underestimate of the wolf's scavenging behaviour in
   previous studies based on scat analyses.},

   investigate the occurrence of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter
   coli in animals, cattle, pigs, and broilers, and raw meat, beef, pork,
   and chicken. Campylobacter spp. were detected in 53.9\% of the cattle,
   63.5\% of the pigs, and 82.9\% of the broilers examined. Chicken meat
   was frequently contaminated (81.3\%), while lower rates were found in
   pork meat (10.3\%) and beef (1.3\%). The resistance to antibiotics of
   the strains was also investigated, and compared to that of human
   clinical isolates. C. coli was generally more resistant than C. jejuni.
   Resistance to quinolones was frequently observed in C coli isolated in
   chicken meat (78.6\%); slightly lower rates were found in C. jejuni
   isolated in broilers (42.2\%), chicken meat (52.8\%), and humans
   (38.2\%). C. coli was also frequently resistant to tetracycline in all
   sources, while resistance to streptomycin was most frequently observed
   in pig isolates (89.4\%). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Trypanosoma equiperdum and Trypanosoma evansi were purified by three or
   four cycles of low-speed centrifugation and final filtration through
   DEAE cellulose. The purified trypanosomes were used in comparative
   biochemical and immunological studies. Comparative polypeptide pattern
   anaylsis revealed that T. equiperdum showed 21 polypeptide bands, whose
   M-r ranged from >200 to 14.8 kDa. T. evansi showed 25 polypeptide bands
   in the M-r range 97-14.8 kDa. The main differences were associated with
   the presence of secondary bands, relative intensity and the number of
   bands. Both species gave seven glycoprotein bands; those of 97 and 68
   kDa were present in T. equiperdum but absent in T. evansi. Bands of 61
   and 28 kDa were present in T. evansi but not in T. equiperdum. Anti-T.
   equiperdum sera recognized four homologous antigens and cross-reacted
   with three antigens of T. evansi. Anti-T. evansi sera recognized three
   homologous antigens and cross-reacted with four T. equiperdum antigens.
   Four identical proteolytic protease bands were present for both species,
   while only one surface protein was detected for each species: 66 kDa for
   T. equiperdum and 62 kDa for T. evansi.},

Abstract = {The salmonid macrophage-like cell line RTS-11 and purified trout
   pronephros phagocytes were used to analyze in vitro entry and survival
   of two Streptococcus iniae serotypes. Efficient invasion by S. iniae
   occurred in both cells, but only the type II strain persisted in
   pronephros phagocytes for at least 48 h. Ex vivo models of
   opsonin-dependent phagocytosis by pronephros phagocytes demonstrated
   increased phagocytosis efficacy. Analysis of phagocytes collected from
   diseased fish demonstrated that similar to70\% of the bacteria contained
   in the blood during the septic phase of the disease were located within
   phagocytes, suggesting an in vivo intracellullar lifestyle. In addition
   to the augmented levels of bacteremia and enhanced survival within
   phagocytes, S. iniae type II induces considerable apoptosis of
   phagocytes. These variabilities in intramacrophage lifestyle might
   explain differences in the outcomes of infections caused by different
   serotypes. The generalized septic disease associated with serotype II
   strains is linked not only to the ability to enter and multiply within
   macrophages but also to the ability to cause considerable death of
   macrophages via apoptotic processes, leading to a highly virulent
   infection. We assume that the phenomenon of survival within phagocytes
   coupled to their apoptosis plays a crucial role in S. iniae infection.
   In addition, it may provide the pathogen an efficient mechanism of
   translocation into the central nervous system.},

Abstract = {In humans, the use of estrogen-based contraceptives is positively
   related to oxidative stress, via the formation of 2-3,4-quinone
   metabolites as free radicals by an E2-4-hydroxylase. These compounds are
   directly genotoxic and can undergo redox cycling to form toxic reactive
   oxygen metabolites (ROMs). This prompted us to investigate oxidative
   stress in terms of ROMs and of the anti-oxidant power (AOP) in sera of
   veal calves exposed to 17beta-estradiol (17betaE). ROMs and AOP were
   measured by two colorimetric methods the former based on the Fenton
   reaction, the latter performed as a neutralization assay of a titred
   HOCl solution. 17betaE Levels were screened by radio immuno assay (RIA)
   and confirmed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass
   spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and related for significance to the established
   threshold (40 ng l(-1)) in sera. Basal levels were measured in different
   groups of veal calves: mother suckling (MS; n = 102), free grazing (FG;
   n = 108), intensively farmed fed on soia and corn silage (IF-; n = 104).
   In calves with 17betaE above the threshold in sera (IF+; n = 16), we
   recorded the highest ROMs level (3.15 mM H2O2), with a negative
   correlation with AOP values. IF+ data significantly differed even from
   those of MS calves (2.61 mM H2O2) naturally exposed to colostrum
   hormones. The absolute ROMs value combined with an impairment of the AOP
   adaptive response can be considered an epidemiological bio-marker for
   xenobiotic estrogen treatments. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {A rapid analytical procedure for the routine identification and

   (AMPI), in feeds by liquid chromatography (LC) was developed and tested.
   AMOX and AMPI are normally the only penicillins added to medicated feeds
   because of their good resistance to gastric juice. The ground feed
   samples were extracted using water-acetonitrile (75:25, v/v) and
   derivatized, without any clean-up, with a formaldehyde solution in
   acidic medium at 100 degreesC for 30 min. The fluorescent derivatives
   were analysed by reversed-phase on an ODS column (150 mm x 4.6 mm; 5
   mum) with a gradient between acetonitrile, methanol and phosphate buffer
   containing thiosulfate as mobile phase. Fluorescence detection was
   carried out at excitation and emission wavelengths of 358 and 440 nm,
   respectively. The recoveries of both penicillins from spiked samples
   were, in a concentration range of 200-500 mg kg(-1), >80\% with
   repeatabilities below 15\% R.S.D. The limits of detection of AMOX and
   AMPI in feed, based on a detector signal-to-noise ratio of 3, were 5 mg
   kg(-1). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A method for the determination of seven corticosteroids (triamcinolone,
   prednisolone, prednisone, dexamethasone, betamethasone, flumethasone,

   was separated by LC on C-18 cartridges and the corticosteroids were
   determined using tandem mass spectrometric analysis with an atmospheric
   pressure chemical ionisation (APCI) interface in single reaction
   monitoring neutral loss mode. For confirmatory use the samples are
   analysed in multiple reaction ion mode using the typical fragmentation
   in positive mode for each compound. Data on precision and accuracy for
   each compound are presented. Neutral loss mode is suitable for the
   detection of all the corticosteroids that form an adduct with
   acetonitrile using the APCI interface thus allowing their simultaneous
   determination with a limit of detection of I mug kg(-1) and with no need
   of extensive purification of the sample. The method fully meets the EU

Abstract = {In 1997, outbreaks of classical swine fever occurred in wild boar and
   domestic pigs in the Italian province of Varese (Lombardy region).
   Statutory animal health measures were imposed, and a control plan aimed
   at preventing the virus from spreading outside the infected hunting zone
   of 108 km(2) was implemented. However, in 1998, virologically positive
   wild boar were found outside this zone, including within Swiss
   territory. The infected zone was then enlarged to include the three
   other hunting areas of the northern province of Varese and the
   neighbouring Swiss territory. Italian and Swiss veterinary services
   initiated a joint policy to control the disease by hunting young wild
   boar and conserving older, immune animals. The percentage of
   virologically positive animals gradually decreased, the last being found
   in July 2000. The seroprevalence initially increased, but in 2000 and
   2001 it decreased from 42.2 per cent to 8.8 per cent, indicating that
   the wild boar population had had no further contact with the virus.},

Abstract = {Zilpaterol, (+/-)-trans-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-7-hydroxy-6-(isopropylamino)
   imidazo {[}4,5,1-jk]-{[}1]benzazepin-2(1H-one, is an adrenergic agonist
   drug licensed in Mexico and South Africa as feed additive for cattle at
   slaughter age. In contrast, the EU legislative framework prohibits the
   use of beta-agonists as growth promoters to produce lean meat. In this
   study, the compound was quantified as its TMS derivative both by gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with a quadrupole detector
   (QUADR) and by GC-MS/MS with an ion trap detector (ITD), in Electron
   Impact (El) ionization. Subsequently, an extraction and clean-up
   procedure for the identification of Zilpaterol in commercial feeds was
   set up. Different extraction solvents and matrices were considered for
   their influence on Zilpaterol yield. The analytical method led to good
   recoveries and limits of detection and quantification in feeds well
   below the 5-20 mug/g dose proposed for animal nutrition.},

Abstract = {In August 2000 bluetongue (BT) disease appeared amongst sheep on the
   island of Sardinia spreading later to Sicily and to mainland Italy. The
   majority of areas affected by BT were surveyed for Culicoides imicola ,
   the only proven vector of the disease known to occur in the
   Mediterranean region. The data from 1456 light-trap collections, made in
   months with a mean temperature of 12.5degreesC, were used to test the
   accuracy of current models predicting the prevalence and abundance of C.
   imicola across the region. For Italy, the distribution of C. imicola was
   found to be very irregular and did not fit the modelled predictions. The
   possible reasons for this are discussed, and suggestions made as to
   which variables may improve this fit in the development of future risk
   models. In Italy, past surveys failed to reveal the presence of C.
   imicola , and so could be construed as evidence of its recent invasion,
   and thus rampant spread northwards. Although equivocal, historical
   records indicate that C. imicola was overlooked in the past. Six
   recommendations are made as to the possible future course of Culicoides
   research in southern Europe.},

Abstract = {A model was developed to classify the Italian territories in relation to
   their suitability to harbour populations of Culicoides imicola and, as a
   consequence, also able to sustain a bluetongue (BT) epidemic. Italy was
   subdivided into 3507 10 x 10 km cells. In 546 cells at least one
   collection was made. The cell was considered the unit for all subsequent
   analyses. Culicoides were collected using Onderstepoort-type blacklight
   traps. Some traps were operated weekly at chosen sites; the remainder
   were moved almost daily to new sites. Only the results obtained during
   the peak August-November period were used, to exclude bias caused by the
   seasonality of C. imicola . Climate data for the period 1999-2001 were
   obtained from 80 weather stations. Multiple logistic regression was
   performed using the presence or absence of C. imicola in a specific cell
   as the dependent variable. Annual means of daily values for minimum
   temperature and minimum relative humidity, and the mean altitude above
   sea level, were the independent variables. The probability of occurrence
   of C. imicola in each grid cell was used to create a prediction map for
   Italy. The model was able to correctly classify 77.5\% of the 546 grid
   cells in which at least one collection had been made. Culicoides imicola
   was found frequently through much of Sardinia, in parts of southern
   Italy, and further north along the Tyrrhenian coast, but was absent from
   along most of the Adriatic coast, and the internal mainland, and from
   most of Sicily. Six detailed maps are provided. Also mapped are areas
   where the probability of the occurrence of C. imicola is lower than 5\%.
   This identification of possible mountainous C. imicola -free areas in
   central Italy could facilitate safer animal trade and transhumance, even
   if BT infections in traded animals or moving stock, were to go
   undetected. Needless to say this depends upon no cool-adapted species of
   Culicoides being involved in the transmission of BT disease.},

Abstract = {In this work, a disposable electrochemical immunosensor, based on a
   competitive assay scheme, was applied to detect polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs) in food. For this purpose, antibodies against PCBs were
   directly immobilized onto the carbon surface of a disposable
   screen-printed electrode. A competition between the PCBs present in the
   sample and a fixed concentration of an enzyme-labeled PCB was realized
   and evaluated by electrochemical detection. Alkaline phosphatase was
   used as the enzyme label, coupled with differential pulse voltammetry
   (DPV) as the electrochemical technique. The immunosensor was tested on
   aroclor mixture detection (1242 and 1248) and then on some typologies of
   food samples to evaluate the possible application for real sample
   analysis. Samples analyzed were from different matrixes, such as sheep
   milk, bovine adipose tissue, and bovine muscle. Results obtained were
   compared with the accredited results according to ISO 17025 methods for
   PCB detection (HRGC-LRMS) as a confirmatory analysis. Preliminary
   results show the possibility to use this device as a screening method in
   food sample analysis. The negligible matrix effect observed may lead to
   a simplified extraction procedure, and considerable time and consumable
   savings are the immediate benefits given by the proposed method.},

Abstract = {Listeriolysin O (LLO) is a cholesterol-binding sulfhydryl-activated
   hemolysin encoded by Listeria monocytogenes hlyA gene. After analyzing
   the nucleotide coding sequence of this gene from the ATCC 9525 L.
   monocytogenes strain, we cloned it in a pET vector for expression in
   Escherichia coli. Thanks to the optimization of the induction protocol,
   we achieved a high-level LLO synthesis (about 10\% of total cell
   proteins) in hemolytically active form. The expressed hemolysin was then
   purified to homogeneity, as revealed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot
   analysis, by a hydroxyapatite adsorption chromatography, followed by an
   SP Sepharose ion-exchange chromatography. The recombinant protein showed
   the same properties determined for LLO purified from L. monocytogenes
   cultures and the characteristics of the sulfhydryl-activated toxins such
   as inactivation by oxidation and by reaction with cholesterol. By a
   combination of the pET expression system and the simple purification
   method, we obtained a significant amount of toxin (4.5 mg/litre cell
   culture) in a hemolytically active form (1.25 x 10(6) HU/mg protein).
   This procedure can solve the problem of LLO isolation from L.
   monocytogenes cultures, which is a difficult task, mainly owing to the
   low levels of toxin released in the culture media. The recombinant
   hemolysin, purified in sufficient quantities, could be very useful for
   structural studies and for diagnostic and pharmaceutical applications.

Abstract = {Two extrachromosomal double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) elements occur in
   Cryptosporidium parvum. A heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA) was
   developed for the rapid characterization of sequence diversity in a
   173-bp fragment of the small dsRNA element of Cryptosporidium with
   either a natural sequence from Cryptosporidium meleagridis or a
   synthetic sequence as reference DNA. The 173-bp fragment was generated
   from 265 samples of whole feces (242 from humans and 18 from livestock
   with C. parvum genotype 1 or 2, 4 from humans with Cryptosporidium
   fells, and 1 from a human with C. meleagridis). The HMA method
   identified 21 patterns in C. parvum (8 in genotype 1, 12 in genotype 2,
   and a type common to both genotypes), 4 patterns in C. fells, and 1
   pattern in C. meleagridis. All patterns were confirmed as distinct by
   DNA sequencing. For genotype 1, a single HMA type was found in 89\% of
   samples: 64 of 65 cases from three waterborne outbreaks, all 16 cases
   from eight intrafamilial outbreaks, and 17 of 28 sporadic cases. Among
   the remaining 11 sporadic cases due to genotype 1, seven other HMA types
   were detected. For genotype 2, a single HMA type was found in 72\% of
   samples: 36 of 43 cases from three waterborne outbreaks, 11 of 15 cases
   from seven intrafamilial outbreaks, 44 of 75 sporadic cases, and all 18
   samples from livestock. Within the intrafamilial outbreaks, two other
   HMA types were identified: the same HMA type was detected in samples
   from cases within the same outbreak. Among the sporadic cases due to
   genotype 2, 10 additional HMA types were detected.},

Abstract = {We have tested amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technology,
   in comparison with isoenzyme analysis, for the simultaneous detection of
   inter- and intraspecific cell line cross-contaminations (CCCs) in the
   cell line collection held at the Istituto Zooprofilattico della
   Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna. Isoenzyme analysis identified four
   cases of interspecific CCCs. In a single,experiment, AFLP was able to
   identify the species of origin of all cell lines for which a reference
   genomic deoxyribonucleic acid was available and to detect five
   interspecific contaminations. Four CCCs confirmed data on isoenzymes,
   whereas the fifth CCC was detected in a species for which isoenzyme
   analysis was noninformative. In addition, AFLP was able to identify the
   putative source of the contaminations detected. The utility of the
   technology in the detection of intraspecific cell line contaminations
   depends on them number of cell lines that have to be distinguished in a
   specific species and on the availability of highly informative
   fingerprinting systems. In mice, a single AFLP primer pair produced 16
   polymorphisms and distinguished all the 15 strains of mouse cell lines
   analysed. In humans, 18 AFLPs identified 83 different profiles in the
   159 cell lines analyzed. Amplified fragment length polymorphism can
   conveniently be applied for cell line fingerprinting in species for
   which hypervariable markers are not available. In species for which a
   highly informative multiplex of microsatellite markers is available,
   AFLP can still provide a useful and cheap tool for simultaneously
   testing inter- and intraspecific contaminations.},

Abstract = {We developed a competitive chemiluminescent (CL) enzyme immunoassay for
   rapid, sensitive analysis of 19-nortestosterone (19-NT) in bovine urine.
   Anti-19-NT polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits using a
   19-NT-hemisuccinate derivative conjugated with ovalbumin; the derivative
   was also conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as a label.
   Antibodies were immobilized on 384-well black polystyrene microtitre
   plates and HRP-labelled 19-NT activity was measured using an efficient
   chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal(R) ELISA Femto) after 3 min
   incubation. Emitted light was recorded using a conventional,
   photomultiplier-tube-based microtitre plate reader or a sensitive
   back-illuminated, cooled CCD camera. The developed method fulfils all
   the requirements of precision (intra- and inter-assay CV < 10\%) and
   accuracy (mean recovery 94-112\%), with a detection limit of 0.03 ppb
   (1.1 x 10(-9) mol/L) in a urine matrix. Chemiluminescence enhances
   detectability of the HRP-labelled tracer (thus lowering the limit of
   detection with respect to colorimetry) and reduces analysis time. The
   384-well microtitre plate cuts the sample/reagent volume (20 \&mu;L), a
   five-fold reduction with respect to the conventional 96-well microtitre
   plate. The developed method is suitable for high-throughput screening of
   19-NT in urine samples, with reduced costs as compared with conventional
   colorimetric enzyme immunoassays. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley \& Sons,

Journal = {VIRUS GENES},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {26},

Abstract = {The matrix protein gene was cloned and sequenced for several recent
   isolates of avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1). Specifically, isolates
   from pigeons and doves, members of the Columbidae family were examined.
   APMV-1 is the causative agent of Newcastle disease and the virus is
   associated with disease among a diverse number of avian species.
   Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolates from pigeons have also been
   classified as pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1). Matrix protein gene
   sequences for PPMV-1 isolates clustered together as a group relative to
   isolates from other species phylogenetically. However, there were also
   isolates from pigeons or doves that grouped with APMV-1 isolates from
   other species. This indicates that PPMV-1 may be circulating among
   Columbidae members as a distinct lineage, but that these avian species
   may also harbor other NDV strains as well. Of particular interest was a
   dove isolate from Europe that had an aberrant fusion protein cleavage
   site and was an outlying member phylogenetically between the two major
   groups of APMV-1 isolates.},

Abstract = {A high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection method
   (HPLC-DAD) combined with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was
   developed for the determination of enrofloxacin and its metabolite
   ciprofloxacin in goat milk. The HPLC-DAD method validation was compliant
   with the ``DG SANCO 1805/2000{''} European regulation. The residues were
   extracted from milk with phosphate buffer, purified on a C-18 Speedisk
   cartridge SPE (Baker) and then analysed using HPLC-DAD set at 277 nm.
   The decision limit (CCalpha) calculated by spiking samples at 100 mug/kg
   with both analytes, taking into account the maximum residue limit (MRL)
   of 100 mug/kg established by the European Union for the sum of
   enrofloxacin and its metabolite ciprofloxacin in milk, was 105.3 mug/kg
   for enrofloxacin and 105.5 mug/kg for ciprofloxacin. The detection
   capability (CCbeta) was 110.7 and 110.9 mug/kg for enrofloxacin and
   ciprofloxacin, respectively. The mean recoveries of the method,
   calculated by spiking samples at 50, 100 and 150 mug/kg were 84\% for
   enrofloxacin and 88\% for ciprofloxacin. The limit of quantification was
   20 mug/kg for both analytes. The HPLC-DAD validated method was
   successfully applied for the-first time in goats milk, and proved to be
   suitable for the sensitive and accurate quantification and confirmation
   analysis of enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin for regulatory purposes. (C)

Abstract = {The present paper reports of the development and validation of a control
   strategy for avian influenza infections in poultry. The ``DIVA{''}
   (Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals) strategy is based on
   the use of an inactivated oil emulsion vaccine containing the same
   haemagglutinin (H) subtype as the challenge virus, but a different
   neuraminidase (N). The possibility of using the heterologous N subtype,
   to differentiate between vaccinated and naturally infected birds, was
   investigated through the development of an ``ad hoc{''} serological test
   based on the detection of specific anti-N1 antibodies. This was achieved
   using a baculovirus expressing a recombinant N1 protein. The
   A/ck/Pakistan/H7N3 virus was used as a vaccine and birds were challenged
   with the HPAI A/ty/Italy/4580/V99/H7N1 strain. The homologous H group
   ensured a clinical protection of 93\% regardless of the vaccination
   scheme used, and was able to prevent viraemia and muscle colonization in
   the clinically healthy challenged birds. However, it was not able to
   prevent viral shedding. The ``ad hoc{''} serological assay was developed
   as an indirect immunofluorescence test, and was validated using 608
   field sera, and showed an ``almost perfect agreement{''} (Kappa value)
   with the HI test, with relative sensitivity and specificity values of
   98.1 and 95.7, respectively. The results of the present investigation
   suggest that the ``DIVA{''} control strategy may represent a tool for
   the control of avian influenza infections in poultry.},

Abstract = {Two pig cell lines derived from kidney and trachea tissues and referred
   to as newborn swine kidney (NSK) and newborn pig trachea (NPTr) were
   established following serial culture of primary cells. They were
   characterized by an epithelial-like morphology, high capacity to
   replicate and stability of the cell monolayer for several days after
   seeding. Their modal chromosome number was modified in comparison to
   that of primary swine cells and they both displayed a transforming
   potential in vitro and displayed oncogenicity in nude mice. Infection
   with pig endogenous retroviruses was detected. Almost all the swine
   viruses tested, i.e., pseudorabies virus, pig parvovirus, hog cholera
   virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine,
   encephalomyocarditis virus, swine vesicular disease virus and the
   enteroviruses, except pig reproductive respiratory syndrome virus, were
   capable of replicating in the new cell lines with titres similar to the
   ones detected in the reference culture systems. Furthermore, all the
   selected influenza virus sub-types isolated from human, swine and avian
   species replicated with cytopathic effect in NSK and NPTr cells,
   whereas, of all the equine influenza viruses tested only the Miami and
   Suffolk sub-types replicated. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Eurasian collared doves (Streptopelia decaocto) are thought to originate
   from India and they have colonized, throughout the centuries, the Middle
   East and, more recently, Mediterranean countries such as Italy and
   Spain. In the present paper we report of the isolation and
   characterization of Newcastle disease viruses (NDV) obtained from
   Eurasian collared doves during 2000-2001, and compare them to isolates
   obtained from feral pigeons (Columba livia) during the same period. All
   isolates could be classified as avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV1) and
   belonged to the pigeon variant group (PPMV1), as their haemagglutinating
   activity was inhibited by mAb 161/617 which is specific for PPMV1. The
   intracerebral pathogenicity indices ranged from 0.68 to 1.38 and all
   isolates contained multiple basic amino acids at the deduced cleavage
   site of the fusion protein, which is a typical feature of virulent
   viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the isolates indicate that 18/20 of
   these form a separate cluster from the isolates obtained from pigeons in
   the same period. These findings suggest that different lineages are
   circulating in feral pigeon populations, and that a separate lineage
   affects Eurasian collared doves.},

Abstract = {A liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS-MS) method has
   been developed for the determination of trenbolone in bovine urine and
   serum. The aim was a control of the misuse of trenbolone in
   food-producing animals. The procedure involved, in both cases, a
   preliminary solid-phase clean-up followed by a liquid-liquid extraction
   for urine samples after a preliminary enzymatic hydrolysis. The extracts
   have been directly analysed by reversed-phase LC-MS-MS in selected
   reaction monitoring (SRM), acquiring two diagnostic product ions from
   the chosen precursor {[}M+H](+). The procedures were validated across
   the concentration range of 1-1500 ng/ml. The linearity, the inter- and
   intra-day accuracy and precision have been determined. The procedure was
   specific and the accuracy values were better than 20\% at the limit of
   quantitation of spiked samples. The limit of quantification (LOQ) and
   the limit of detection (LOD) were, respectively, I ng/ml and 350 pg/ml
   for urine and serum. According to the draft, SANCO/1805/2000, we
   determined the decision limit CCalpha and the detection capability
   CCbeta. The recovery values for urine ranged from 87 to 128\%, and for
   plasma the recovery was 70+/-4\%. The procedure proved to be simple and
   suitable for routine and confirmatory purposes such as those developed
   for residue studies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Zilpaterol is an adrenergic drug currently licensed in Mexico and South

   an analytical method to detect zilpaterol in commercial feeds was set
   up. The influence of extraction solvent and matrix was evaluated. The
   drug as a trimethylsilyl derivative was characterized by GC-MS, on a
   quadrupole detector, in the electron impact mode. Acidic extraction,
   solid-phase extraction C-18 non-endcapped clean-up and mass
   characterization on ions m/z 308, 291, 405, 390 provided zilpaterol
   recoveries >75.3\% and repeatability <3.3\% in feeds spiked in the range
   30.0-120.0 ng/g. The limits of detection and quantification were 7.5 and
   25.0 ng/g, respectively. Such limits are well below the dose of 5.0-20.0

Abstract = {Tests based on the PCR technique have the advantage to be rapid and
   highly specific but, when applied on fecal samples, they lack
   sensitivity. This is probably due to different kinds of problems:
   difficulty in lysing the cell wall, presence of inhibitory substances,
   conditions of the PCR reaction not suitable. We have taken into
   consideration the three kinds of problems, obtaining good results on
   artificially spiked fecal samples by the use of physical methods of
   lysis, in combination with a commercial kit for extraction (QIAamp stool
   mini-Kit, Qiagen) and by the optimisation of the reaction conditions.
   Furthermore, we have compared two kinds of extraction and PCR methods
   (home-made and Adiavet Paratub, Adiagene) on naturally infected feces.
   The results of fecal culture and PCR showed 100 \% accordance to feces
   collected from ``high and medium shedders{''}, while PCR did not reach
   the same sensitivity as fecal cultures on ``low shedder{''} feces.},

Abstract = {In an environmental pollution research some wild animals, deceased due
   to accidental causes, were collected from all over Sardinia. In order to
   detect the possible residues of unknown pollutants the isolated livers
   of these animals, previously lyophilized, were analyzed. First, by a
   GC-MS method, we identified the p,p(1)-DDE and some PCBs belonging to 5,
   6, 7, 8 series PCBs.
   Later we set up a method for quantification of these compounds, using
   chicken liver as a model, by GC-ECD. The spiked chicken liver, free from
   p,p(1)-DDE and PCBs, was lyophilized and extracted by supercritical
   fluid extraction (SFE), subsequently the solutions obtained were
   subjected to cleanup by solid phase extraction (SPE). Finally, this
   method was employed to quantify p,p(1)-DDE and PCBs in the samples of
   the specimens collected.},

   high-pathogenicity avian influenza. The first epidemic was caused by a
   virus of the H5N2 subtype and was limited to eight premises in backyard
   and semi-intensive flocks. The prompt identification of the disease was
   followed by the implementation of European Union (EU) directive
   92/40/EEC and resulted in the eradication of infection without serious
   consequences to the poultry industry. The 1999-00 epidemic was caused by
   a virus of the H7N1 subtype that originated from the mutation of a low
   pathogenic virus and resulted instead in a devastating epidemic that
   affected industrially reared poultry, culminating in the infection of
   413 flocks. The description of the epidemics and the result of the
   control policies are reported.},

Abstract = {Recent epidemics of highly contagious animal diseases included in list A
   of the Office International des Epizooties, such as foot-and-mouth
   disease, classical swine fever and avian influenza (AI), have led to the
   implementation of stamping-out policies resulting in the depopulation of
   millions of animals. The enforcement of a control strategy based on
   culling animals that are infected, suspected of being infected or
   suspected of being contaminated, which is based only on the application
   of sanitary restrictions on farms, may not be sufficient to avoid the
   spread of infection, particularly in areas that have high animal
   densities, thus resulting in mass depopulation. In the European Union,
   the directive that imposes the enforcement of a stamping-out policy
   (92/40/EC) for AI was adopted in 1992 but was drafted in the 1980s. The
   poultry industry has undergone substantial changes in the past 20 years,
   mainly resulting in shorter production cycles and in higher animal
   densities per territorial unit. Due to these organizational changes,
   infectious diseases are significantly more difficult to control because
   of the greater number of susceptible animals reared per given unit of
   time and due to the difficulties in applying adequate biosecurity
   measures. The slaughter and destruction of great numbers of animals is
   also questionable from an ethical point of view, particularly when human
   health implications are negligible. For this reason, mass depopulation
   has raised serious concerns for the general public and has recently led
   to very high costs and economic losses for national and federal
   governments, stakeholders and, ultimately, for consumers. In the past,
   the use of vaccines in such emergencies has been limited by the
   impossibility of differentiating vaccinated/infected from
   vaccinated/non-infected animals. The major concern was that through
   trade or movement of apparently uninfected animals or products, the
   disease could spread further or might be exported to other countries.
   For this reason, export bans have been imposed on countries enforcing a
   vaccination policy. This review considers the possible strategies for
   the control of avian influenza infections, bearing in mind the new
   proposed definition of AI, including the advantages and disadvantages of
   using conventional inactivated (homologous and heterologous) vaccines
   and recombinant vaccines. Reference is made to the different control
   strategies, including the restriction measures to be applied in case of
   the enforcement of a vaccination policy. In addition, the implications
   of a vaccination policy on trade are discussed. It is concluded that if
   vaccination is accepted as an option for the control of AI, vaccine
   banks, including companion diagnostic tests, must be established and
   made available for immediate use.},

Abstract = {Ehrlichiosis and rickettsiosis are very common, widespread diseases.
   These diseases are present in Sardinia year round because its temperate
   weather permits the survival of many kinds of tick vectors. A thousand
   dogs were subjected to physical, hematological, biochemical examinations
   and serological tests. All 1,000 sera were analyzed by indirect
   immunofluorescence antibody test to detect antibodies against E. canis
   and R. rickettsii. A high seroprevalence (about 50\%) was detected for
   both etiological agents, without differences in relation to sex, breed,
   or usage. A high seroprevalence, corresponding to 62.5\% for
   ehrlichiosis and 64\% for rickettsiosis, was observed in the age group
   of 13-60 months. The mortality was greatest in the males in the age
   group, which manifested the disease in the chronic phase.},

   One hypothesis is that they continue to circulate in waterfowl

   in Italy during six winter seasons (1993-99), using virus isolations and
   serological analyses. It was apparent that influenza A viruses were
   constantly circulating in wild birds during all the seasons considered.
   Moreover, seroconversion rates (obtained from ducks recaptured during
   the same season) suggest a frequency of influenza infections higher than
   expected on the basis of the virus isolation rates.},

Abstract = {The risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy propagation was drastically
   reduced after the European Union (EU) Health Authorities adopted
   restrictions involving a ban on animal-derived proteins in the diet of
   farm animals. Currently, the EU's officially recommended method for
   controlling meat and bone meal (MBM) in animal feed is the microscopic
   method, which involves the identification of bone fragments on the basis
   of their morphological characteristics. Recently, we demonstrated that a
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay can be used for the
   detection of taxon-specific DNA in MBM and animal feeds. To ensure the
   safe rendering of animal by-products, the EU Council requires that this
   material be treated at 133degreesC at 300 kPa for 20 min. Here we
   investigate the relationship between DNA degradation, PCR amplification,
   and MBM heat treatment. With a competitive PCR-based approach, we
   compare the amplification efficiency of bovine mitochondrial DNA target
   sequences of different lengths in several heat-treated MBM samples. For
   our method, a synthetic competitive DNA is used as an internal control
   for both DNA extraction and PCR reaction. A correlation between an
   increase in treatment temperature and a reduction in the size of the
   target sequences suitable for amplification was observed, suggesting
   progressive DNA fragmentation due to the temperature. We show that short
   amplicons (147 bp) can be used to detect the presence of bovine mtDNA in
   MBM samples treated according to the current European regulations. The
   use of such a competitive approach to compare amplification efficiency
   levels of targets of different lengths might represent a useful tool for
   the determination of both the amount of MBM in animal feeds and its
   proper heat treatment.},

Title = {Welfare and meat quality of beef cattle housed on two types of floors
   with the same space allowance},
Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {2},
Number = {4},
Pages = {243-253},
Abstract = {Growth performance, behaviour, cleanliness, carcass traits and meat
   quality of 48 Simmental young bulls housed on slatted floor or on straw
   bedding with the same space allowance were compared in the study, which
   lasted 250 days. The animals (initial body weight = 321.2 +/- 34.1 kg)
   were assigned to 8 balanced groups, according to their initial body
   weight. All the groups were reared in separate pens with a space
   allowance of 3 m(2)/head. Four pens had a concrete floor covered with a
   straw bedding while the other pens had a fully slatted floor made of
   concrete slats. All the animals received the same diet provided ad
   libitum.
   Type of floor did not affect the bulls' daily gain, feed intake and feed
   efficiency. Health status of the animals was satisfactory throughout the
   trial and several blood indicators of chronic stress were not modified
   by the treatment. Behavioural observations carried out at d 10, 80, 180
   and 240 showed differences only on some behaviours due to the type of
   floor. In particular, the straw bedding increased eating behaviour and
   it encouraged the simultaneous presence of more bulls at the manger.
   Regardless of the type of floor, the progress of the trial showed a
   linear increase of animals' inactivity (P < 0.05) while linear decrease
   of bulls' lying (P < 0.01), eating (P < 0.001) and ruminating (P < 0.01)
   was observed. These results can be referred to the growth of the animal
   body frame, which made the space allowance progressively limiting. In
   the straw bedded pens, clean straw was added weekly and fully renewed
   every 3 weeks, but this bedding management did not allow a satisfactory
   cleanliness of the animals in comparison with the slatted floor.
   However, the worse cleanliness of the bulls on the straw did not promote
   their grooming activity. Young bulls were slaughtered at a final weight
   of 614.6 +/- 14.7 kg and their carcass traits and meat quality were not
   affected by the treatment.
   The straw bedded system cannot always be considered the cleanest
   solution for the housing of beef cattle and its frequent renewal must be
   carried out, particularly when animals are kept with a minimum space
   allowance. The minimal differences observed for all the parameters
   measured in the study between the two types of floors must be related to
   the adoption of the same space allowance/animal and this factor has
   shown to be the most critical housing parameter affecting beef cattle
   welfare during the fattening period.},

Abstract = {Paratuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease of ruminants caused by
   Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map). For water buffaloes,
   bred in the Latium region only, little is known about the spread of
   paratuberculosis. Studies usually are carried out almost only on Bubalus
   bubalis, which is genetically different from buffalo species present in
   our region and is also another productive target. Breeding of water
   buffaloes is a noteworthy zootechnic reality in the Latium region owing
   to the international level of their Denomination of origin (DOP)
   products ``inozzarella di bufala campana{''}. First sanitary programme
   were established in 1998 and are now carried out for 21 buffalo herds in
   the Latium region. There is a need for a rapid and reliable diagnostic
   test for paratuberculosis that can be used in a control programme. For
   this Purpose at our laboratory different PCR diagnostic approaches have
   been examined in a comparative study with conventional culture (golden
   standard) for their qualification.
   Fecal specimens were obtained from animals originating from herds held
   on intensive farms with animals living in semi-free breeding systems
   with access to outside paddocks. Conventional culture tests were carried
   out by double incubation on Herrold's Egg Yolk Medium agar (HEYM). After
   3-12 weeks Map specific colonies appeared and were verified by
   Ziehl-Nielsen staining. Genomic DNA was extracted from the samples using
   the Qiagen DNA Tissue Extraction Kit and then submitted to PCR analyses.
   Two different PCR approaches were applied :(5) a home-made nested PCR
   based on primers P90/P91 and P25/P26 designed to detect a 229 bp
   fragment of the Map specific IS900 sequence and (7) the commercial kit
   Adiavet((R)) Paratub from Adiagene also employing a pair of IS900
   specific primers. The prevalence of positive animals was significantly
   higher with the home made PCR (13.3 \%) than with the commercial PCR kit
   (6.6 \%) or the conventional culture (4 \%) respectively. Three positive
   culture samples also were confirmed by both PCR approaches; whereas of
   seven samples positive with the home-made PCR, only two were positive
   with the Adiagene Kit. The internal fragment obtained by nested PCR was
   analysed only of 5 samples. All serological tests were negative for all
   samples carried out. Therefore, further evaluations of procedures is
   needed and it could be possible that some of the ``false positive{''}
   samples will prove not as such, mainly related to the home-made PCR.},

Abstract = {Current population structure patterns of roe deer Capreolus capreolus in
   Spain were assessed through the analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear
   DNA. Restriction fragment length polymorphism was detected in the D-loop
   and NADH-dehydrogenase ND1 segments of mitochondrial DNA. Nuclear
   variation was investigated using 12 microsatellite loci. A total of 126
   roe deer were analysed from fourteen sampling sites across the Iberian
   peninsula. including the Andalusian population from Sierra de Cadiz.
   which represents the southwestern limit of the distribution of C.
   capreolus. Results from both mitochondrial and microsatellite variation
   revealed a considerable level of structuring for roe deer populations
   throughout the Spanish range. In particular, evidence was provided from
   mtDNA of a genetic differentiation of roe deer populations in northern
   Spain from those occurring in southern areas, with a particular
   distinctiveness of the Andalusian roe deer. Concordant results were
   obtained from classical clustering analysis based on microsatellite
   loci. Furthermore, a Bayesian approach to microsatellite data proved
   more efficiently that northern roe deer are in turn genetically
   heterogenous, comprising at least three subpopulations. The
   phylogeographic pattern suggests a history of long-term isolation of the
   two main groups of roe deer populations: possibly as a consequence of
   the climatic changes in the Late Pleistocene. The occurrence of two
   genetic lineages calls for different strategies of conservation and
   management of this species in the Iberian Peninsula, according to the
   geographic distribution of populations.},

Abstract = {In 1999-2000, Italy was affected by the most severe avian influenza (AI)
   epidemic that has ever occurred in Europe. The epidemic was caused by a
   type A influenza virus of the H7N1 subtype, which originated from the
   mutation of a low-pathogenicity (LP) AI virus of the same subtype. From
   August to November 2000, 4 months after the eradication of the highly
   pathogenic (HP) AI virus, the LPAI strain re-emerged and infected 55
   poultry farms mainly located in the southern area of Verona province
   (Veneto region). To supplement disease control measures already in
   force, an emergency vaccination program against the disease was
   implemented in the area. Vaccination was carried out using an
   inactivated heterologous vaccine (A/chicken/Pakistan/1995-H7N3). In
   order to establish whether LPAI infection was circulating in the area,
   regular serological testing of sentinel birds in vaccinated flocks and a
   discriminatory test able to distinguish the different types of
   antineuraminidase antibodies (anti-N1 and anti-N3) were performed.
   Shortly after the beginning of the vaccination campaign (December 2000
   to March 2001), the H7N1 LPAI virus emerged again, infecting 23 farms.
   Among these, only one vaccinated flock was affected, and infection did
   not spread further to other vaccinated farms. The data reported in the
   present paper indicate that the combination of biosecurity measures,
   official control, and vaccination can be considered successful for the
   control of LPAI infections in densely populated poultry areas.},

Abstract = {From the end of March to the beginning of December 1999, an epidemic of
   low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI), caused by a H7N1 type A
   influenza virus, affected the intensively reared poultry population of
   Northeastern Italy. A total of 199 flocks were diagnosed with influenza
   infection. The highest number affected flocks were in meat turkeys
   (164), with only a limited number of turkey breeder, chicken (breeders,
   broilers, and table egg layers), and guinea fowl flocks infected.
   Following the circulation of the LPAI virus in a susceptible population
   for several months, a high-pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) virus
   emerged. Over 13 million birds on 413 different premises were affected
   by the HPAI virus, including turkey, chicken, guinea fowl, pheasant,
   Japanese quail, ostrich, and waterfowl flocks. In the present paper we
   report on the clinical, gross, histopathological, and
   immunohistochemical investigations performed on different avian species
   naturally infected by the LPAI virus and the HPAI virus.},

Abstract = {An immunohistochemical investigation was performed to assess tissue
   tropism and viral replication of Italian H7N1 isolates belonging to
   different lineages in developing chicken, turkey, Muscovy duck, and
   mallard duck embryos. Low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) isolates
   were selected on the basis of the location in the phylogenetic tree; a
   progenitor strain, A/turkey/ Italy/977/V99 (exhibiting no additional
   glycosylation sites, nAGS), strain A/turkey/Italy/2379/ V99 (AGS in
   position 123), and strain A/turkey/Italy/3675/V99 (AGS in position 149)
   were selected. The latter two strains belonged to distinct lineages
   originating from the pool of progenitor strains. The highly pathogenic
   avian influenza (HPAI) isolate A/turkey/Italy/4580/V99 was also included
   in the test. All the embryos tested supported the growth of HPAI. The
   LPAI isolates replicated readily in the allantoic layer of the
   chorioallantoic membrane of all the species tested and did not replicate
   to detectable levels in the developing chicken, turkey, and Muscovy duck
   embryos. In contrast, they replicated to different extents in the
   respiratory tract of the developing mallard embryo. The findings
   indicate that the pathogenesis of LPAI infections in mallard embryos is
   different to that observed in other species and should be investigated
   further.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {95},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1277-1284},
Abstract = {Aims: We report a biochemical method for the isolation and
   identification of the current species of vibrios using just one
   operative protocol.
   Methods and Results: The method involves an enrichment phase with
   incubation at 30degreesC for 8-24 h in alkaline peptone water and an
   isolation phase on thiosulphate-citrate-salt sucrose agar plates
   incubating at 30 C for 24 h. Four biochemical tests and Alsina's scheme
   were performed for genus and species identification, respectively. All
   biochemical tests were optimized as regards conditions of temperature,
   time of incubation and media composition. The whole standardized
   protocol was always able to give a correct identification when applied
   to 25 reference strains of Vibrio and 134 field isolates.
   Conclusions: The data demonstrated that the assay method allows an
   efficient recovery, isolation and identification of current species of
   Vibrio in seafood obtaining results within 2-7 days. S
   ignificance and Impact of the Study: This method based on biochemical
   tests could be applicable even in basic microbiology laboratories, and
   can be used simultaneously to isolate and discriminate all clinically
   relevant species of Vibrio.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY},

Volume = {18},

Pages = {157-160},
Abstract = {While much research effort has been targeted at the
   verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) serotype O157:H7, it is
   becoming more evident that other VTEC serotypes can also be associated
   with human foodborne disease. An increasing number of these non-O157
   serotypes have been isolated from food sources and from humans suffering
   from haemolytic-uraemic syndrome and diarrhoea. The aim of our work was
   to investigate the prevalence of VTEC O157 and non-O157 in foodstuffs of
   animal origin using two rapid enzymatic procedures. Various types of
   food samples, 352 in total, were tested: 233 with the Premier EHEC, a
   screening test which directly detects the presence of verocytotoxin,
   regardless of serotype, while 119 of these with the Vidas ECO, which is
   a specific screening test for E. coli O157: H7, together with the
   Premier EHEC. Two samples were positive for VTEC, one of serogroup O126
   and the other was non-serotypable. Another sample was positive in the
   test specific for E. coli O157: H7, but was not confirmed by culture.
   This study suggests that VTEC strains are not prevalent in Italy, and
   that the isolation of serogroup O157 is relatively infrequent. This
   leads us to conclude that there is little chance of exposure to pathogen
   for the average consumer in Italy.},

Abstract = {From November 2000 to December 2001 a serological monitoring programme
   for paratuberculosis was carried out in 419 dairy farms in the Veneto
   Region. Blood samples were tested using a commercially available ELISA
   (Herdcheck, IDEXX). The sensitivity and specificity values of the test
   were respectively 45 \% and 99 \%. Out of 27135 tested animals 3,50 \%
   (CI 95 \% = 3,28-3,72) reacted positively. If all farms with at least
   one positive animal were considered as positive, a high (65 \%) apparent
   farm prevalence would be obtained. However, the probability of false
   positive reactions, which could increase with farm size, should be taken
   into account. These false positive results could determine a
   misclassification of some non-infected herds.
   Data obtained in the present study suggest that the apparent farm
   prevalence should be corrected and reduced in order to get near to the
   true value. It appears reasonable to define for each farm, a cut-off
   value (number of positive animals) to classify the farm as positive, so
   that herd-level specificity does not drop below 95 \%. If the latter key
   were applied, the farm prevalence would be reduced from 65 \% to 27 \%.
   However, the hypothesis that this approach gives a more accurate
   measurement of the presence of the infection should be confirmed by a
   specific study coupling serological and bacteriological examinations.},

Abstract = {The authors review equine granulocytic ehrlichiosis (EGE) in Italy from
   1996 to 2002. In 1996, the first case of EGE has been observed in a
   horse affected with specific symptomatology (fever, lethargy, anorexia,
   limb edema, thrombocytopenia, and petechiae). In 1997, a
   seroepidemiological survey was performed in the province of Rome on 563
   animals using IFAT. The authors describe the last case, which occurred
   on 2002 in a 15-year-old male, bay, half-breed, tick-infested horse.
   Clinical features included fever, lethargy, limb edema, icterus,
   leukocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Laboratory tests were positive for
   ELISA and IFAT and several morulae were seen in the cytoplasm of
   neutrophils in buffy coat smears. The authors think that in Italy the
   prevalence of EGE is underestimated because of the nonpathognomonic
   clinical symptoms, the diffusion of specific infected vector, and the
   nonroutine nature of specific laboratory tests.},

Abstract = {The isolation of four new variants or serotypes of avian infectious
   bronchitis virus in Italy is reported. The antigenic characteristics of
   these strains were investigated by cross-neutralization tests with the
   new isolates, Fa 6881/97, AZ 27/98, AZ 20/97, and BS 216/01; two of the
   most common European serorypes, AZ 23/74 and CR 88121 (79313); and the
   classic Massachusetts M41 serotype in association with a panel of 17
   specific antisera. On the basis of the results obtained, the new
   isolates show relevant serologic differences. In fact, the four isolates
   were not neutralized by antisera against the most common European and
   American serotypes; the AZ 20/97 isolate was partially neutralized by FA
   6881/97 antiserum but not reciprocally.
   The closely related Fa 6881/97 and AZ 27/98 isolates can be considered
   rather diffused in our country because they have been isolated over 20
   times in the last 3 yr in different parts of Italy. On the contrary, the
   AZ 20/97 and BS 216/01 isolates were reported only once so far.
   The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that Fa
   6881/97 isolate is related to 793B isolate, whereas AZ 27/98 and BS
   216/01 isolates appeared not to be related to the most common European
   and Massachusetts serorypes.},

Abstract = {During the late summer of 1998, veterinary authorities in Tuscany,
   Italy, received reports of cases of neurologic disease among horses
   residing in a large wetland area located in the provinces of Florence
   and Pistoia. West Nile virus was isolated from two of the six horses
   that died or were euthanized. A retrospective epidemiologic study
   identified 14 clinical neurologic cases that occurred from August 20 to
   October 6 (attack rate of 2.8\%). A serologic survey conducted over a
   700-km(2) area in stables with and without apparent clinical cases
   confirmed a wider spread of the infection, with an overall
   seroprevalence rate of 38\% in the affected area. No significant
   differences in age-specific prevalence. were observed, suggesting that
   the horses residing in the area had not been exposed previously to West
   Nile virus and supporting the hypothesis of its introduction in the
   wetland area during the first half of 1998.},

Abstract = {A novel approach to the determination of 17beta-estradiol in bovine
   plasma is presented. The observed enhanced sensitivity is gained by the
   application of tandem mass spectrometry (MS) fragmentation to a stable,
   well characterized negative ion produced by chemical ionization (methane
   as reagent gas). A specific derivatizing reactant is employed
   (pentafluorobenzyl bromide), combined with
   bistrimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide, to favor the formation of a
   diagnostic precursor negative ion. Plasma samples are purified through a
   C18 solid phase extraction column and derivatized before gas
   chromatography-MS analysis. The accuracy and the precision of the
   method, tested over a set of spiked samples, were satisfactory. The
   limit of detection was found to be 5 pg ml(-1) and the limit of
   quantification was fixed at 20 pg ml-1. The fragmentation pattern is
   fully explained and the method is applicable for the official analysis
   of bovine plasma for the detection of 17beta-estradiol according to the
   European criteria 256/93 and to the draft SANCO/1805/2000 rev. 3. The
   quantification of incurred positive samples was performed according to
   the proposed procedure and compared with the results obtained by
   standardized radio immuno assay; the estimated concentrations were
   significantly similar. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {We studied the interactions of tetracycline (TC) antibiotic molecules
   with phospholipid monolayers with the two-fold aim of elucidating the
   mechanism of action and providing a first step for the realization of
   bio-mimetic sensors for such drugs by means of the Langmuir-Blodgett
   technique.
   We examined spreading monolayers of three phospholipids in the presence
   of tetracycline in the subphase by means of surface pressure-area and
   surface potential-area isotherms as a function of bulk pH.
   We selected phospholipids with hydrophobic chains of the same length but
   polar head groups differing either in dimensions and protonation
   equilibria, i.e. dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC),
   dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE) and dipalmitoylphosphatidic
   acid (DPPA).
   The interaction of tetracycline with the three phospholipids was found
   to be highly dependent on the electric charge of the antibiotic and on
   the ionization state of the lipid. Significant interactions are
   established between the negatively charged form of
   dipalmitoylphosphatidic acid and the zwitterionic form of tetracycline.
   The drug was found to migrate at the interface where it is adsorbed
   underneath or/and among the head groups, depending on the surface
   pressure of the film, whereas penetration through the hydrophobic layer
   was excluded for all the three phospholipids. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {A case of hemangiosarcoma of the third eyelid in a 15-year-old Domestic
   Short-haired cat is reported. A small red mass protruding from the
   anterior surface of the third eyelid in the left eye was present. Only
   mild bilateral conjunctivitis and nuclear sclerosis were revealed on
   initial ophthalmic examination. After anti-inflammatory treatment,
   surgery and cryotherapy were performed. On histopathologic examination
   the mass was located just beneath the conjunctival epithelium,
   suggesting that the conjunctiva was the tissue of origin. The tumor
   showed high cellularity and was composed of pleomorphic spindle and
   polygonal cells arranged in interlacing bundles and solid sheets. The
   presence of slit-like spaces between tumor cells containing erythrocytes
   demonstrated the vascular differentiation. Mitotic activity was
   moderate, but atypical mitoses were detected. The surgical area healed
   uneventfully and after 7 months there was no recurrence. To the authors'
   knowledge, this is the first report of conjunctival hemangiosarcoma of
   the third eyelid in a cat.},

Abstract = {Wild boars play a role as Trichinella reservoir in the sylvatic cycle
   and may pose a risk for the consumer. Therefore, all wild boars intended
   for human consumption must be examined for Trichinella muscle larvae
   according to EU legislation. Apart from prescribed meat inspection
   epidemiological studies are performed for identification of Trichinella
   isolates in this omnivorous species and for its interaction to other
   sylvatic and domestic animals. In this paper, we describe the first
   report of Trichinella (T) britovi infection in the wild boar of Aosta
   valley.},

Abstract = {A new immunocapture technique has been applied to the diagnosis of ovine
   brucellosis under experimental conditions. The tests were made on a
   serum bank derived from both young and adult ewes vaccinated
   conjunctivally with the Rev I strain at a dose of 108 to 10(9)
   colony-forming units. Adult ewes were infected experimentally
   two-and-a-half years after they had been vaccinated and the results were
   compared with an unvaccinated control group. The condition of each
   animal in terms of infection with Brucella melitensis was determined by
   clinical and bacteriological investigations. The development of the
   immune response was compared by the rose bengal test, the complement
   fixation test, the Coombs' test and the immunocapture technique for 180
   days after the vaccination and for 410 days after the experimental
   infection, that is, the two following gestations. The results suggest
   that the new technique is more specific in animals vaccinated
   conjunctivally, regardless of their age when they were vaccinated. After
   the experimental infection, significantly (P<0.05) fewer of the
   vaccinated sheep which were free of clinical signs and were not
   excreting B melitensis reacted positively to the test},

Abstract = {No direct evidence that genetically modified (GM) food may represent a

   no structural modification occurs in pancreatic acinar cells of mice fed
   on GM soybean, quantitative changes of some cellular constituents take
   place in comparison to control animals. In particular, a diet containing
   significant amount of GM food seems to influence the zymogen synthesis

   were clearly defined circular, whitish areas, affecting the superficial
   exoskeleton; the wider lesions had irregular borders and contained
   necrotic material. The histo-pathological findings were similar to those
   described for shell disease of other crustaceans. Pseudomonas spp. were
   isolated from all lesions; in one case they were associated with
   Enterobacter agglomerans. Finally, the potential hygienic-sanitary
   implications related to the described pathology were discussed.},

Abstract = {Ruminal bacterial counts and in vivo digestibility were determined on
   four Mediterranean buffalo bulls and four Friesian bulls, all fistulated
   at the rumen, and given at maintenance level (50 g/kg M-0.75 per day of
   dry matter)four different diets with the same crude protein content (N x
   6.25 = 140 g/kg dry matter) and with forage: concentrate ratios as
   follows : diet D12.5 = 0.875 : 0.125; diet D25.0 = 0.75 : 0.25; diet
   D37.5 = 0.625 : 0.375; diet D50.0 = 0.5 : 0.5. All the animals received
   the diets during four consecutive periods in a Latin-square design.
   Buffaloes had higher total microbial counts (10.78 v. 10.08 log(10)
   cells per g dry rumen content, P < 0.01) as compared with cattle;
   differences in total ruminal bacterial counts among the diets were only
   observed within the buffalo species (diet D12.5 v. diets D25.0, D37.5,

   0.01) and D50.0: 11.17 v. 9.76 (P < 0.01) log(10) cells per g dry rumen

   organic matter (0,696 v. 0.676, P < 0.05), neutral-detergent fibre (NDF;
   0.548 v. 0.511, P < 0.05) and cellulose (0.621 v. 0.509, P < 0.01),
   while the crude protein digestibility (CPD) values were similar (0.667
   and 0.671). Comparing the two species for each diet, cattle showed
   significantly higher digestibility values for organic matter in diet
   D50.0 only (0.714 v. 0.688, P < 0.01),for NDF in diet D12.5 only (0.578

   protein structure demonstrating a conservation of the secondary
   structure. Western blot analysis and immunogold electron microscopy
   showed that all orf virus strains were antigenically identical. The
   results of our study confirmed the immunogenicity of the FIL protein;
   furthermore, our data suggest a possible involvement of the protein in

   majority of the DT104 strains. Two DT104 strains, showing resistance to
   streptomycin-spectinomycin and sulfonamides, carried a partially deleted
   SGI1 lacking the flo(st), tetR, and tetA genes, conferring
   chloramphenicol-florfenicol and tetracycline resistance, and the
   integron harboring the pse-1 gene cassette, conferring ampicillin
   resistance. The presence of SGI1 was also observed in serovar

Title = {The provision of drinking water to veal calves for welfare purposes},

Abstract = {Growth performance, behavior, physiology, forestomach development,
   abomasal lesions, and meat quality of veal calves fed a milk-replacer
   diet (No Water) were compared to those obtained from calves fed the same
   diet and provided with increasing amounts of drinking water (Water). Two
   groups of 69 Polish Friesian calves, balanced according to initial BW,
   were assigned to two water treatmenst in a 3 x 2 x 2 factorial
   arrangement that provided solid feed in addition to the milk-replacer
   diet (No solid feed, 250 g-calf(-1).d(-1) of wheat straw or the same
   amount of beet pulp), and the adoption of two housing systems
   (individual stall vs group pen), The fattening trial lasted 160 d, and
   calves received drinking water starting from the 2nd wk of the study.
   The amount of drinking water was progressively increased from 3 to 8
   L.calf(-1).d(-1). Although not dehydrated, as shown by hematocrit and
   Na, K, and total protein hemoconcentration, calves consumed almost all
   the offered amount of water throughout the fattening period. Therefore,
   the water provided by the milk replacer alone, which ranged between 6 to
   16 L.calf.d(-1), was not sufficient to satisfy the need of the animal.
   Drinking water did not affect the calves' growth performance but it
   reduced nonnutritive oral behavior throughout the fattening period.
   Based on these results, drinking water did not cover a shortage in the
   calves' water requirement but it played a role in environmental
   enrichment. Health status was similar between treatments, although water
   provision reduced the episodes of feed refusal. The measurement of
   chronic stress by ACTH challenge showed that the administration of
   drinking water would be advisable when calves are fed with small amounts
   of solid feed for well-being. Feces consistency and animal cleanliness
   were not affected by drinking water. At slaughter, forestomach
   development was similar between treatments, and drinking water did not
   affect the number of calves showing rumen hairballs and abomasal
   lesions. No differences in color and other meat quality traits were
   observed between Water and No Water calves. Despite the lack of direct
   effects on productive traits, when water was available, the calves drank
   it, and positive effects were noticed on their nonnutritive oral
   behaviors and chronic stress indicators.},

Title = {Comparison of Sulla-hay and Sulla-silage in the lactating ewes and their

Journal = {SMALL RUMINANT RESEARCH},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {45},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Two methods of storage of Sulla- and oat-grass (silage or hay) were
   compared. Forty-six homogeneous lactating ewes, housed indoors, were
   divided into two groups and after 35 days of diet adjustment, were fed
   ad libitum twice a day, either Sulla- (Hedysarum coronarium L.) and
   oat-hay (control group) or Sulla- and oat-silage in partial substitution
   of hay (silage group). Both groups were fed with 0.5 kg of commercial
   concentrate. The dietary treatment started 60 days post-lambing and
   lasted for 58 days.
   Every day, the feeding intake for each group was recorded. Individual
   milk yield was measured weekly and at the same time, milk samples were
   collected and analysed by Milko-Scan 605. Every week, the milk yield of
   each group, collected for 48 h before and frozen at 5 degreesC, for a
   total of eight replications, was analysed for fat, protein, casein,
   whey-protein, non-protein nitrogen, urea, lactose percentages, pH, and
   microbiological contamination. The cheese were made according to the
   traditional cheese making process of Sicilian Pecorino cheese.
   On the basis of Flieg (82) and Vanbelle (60) points, the silage turned
   out to be very good, with a good nutrient value (0.60 milk FU/kg). The
   dry matter (DM) intake did not differ between feeding groups (1585
   versus 1639g per day of DM, respectively). The silage level of
   substitution with regard to hay was equal to 27\%. The silage group ewes
   did not show significant differences as regards daily milk yield (0.59
   kg per day versus 0.60 kg per day), fat percentage (8.12\% versus
   8.03\%), and protein percentage (5.53\% versus 5.40\%), but increased
   their body weight (+3.82 kg versus +2.08 kg, P < 0.05). Cheese yield and
   microbiological analysis did not show significant differences among the
   mature cheese of both groups. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Prion diseases are transmissible neurodegenerative disorders of humans
   and animals for which no effective treatment is available.
   Conformationally altered, protease-resistant forms of the prion protein
   (PrP) termed PrPSc are critical for disease transmissibility and
   pathogenesis, thus representing a primary target for therapeutic
   strategies. Based on previous findings that tetracyclines revert
   abnormal physicochemical properties and abolish neurotoxicity of PrP
   peptides in vitro, we tested the ability of these compounds to interact
   with PrPSc from patients with the new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
   disease (vCJD) and cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
   The incubation with tetracycline hydrochloride or doxycycline hyclate at
   concentrations ranging from 10 muM to 1 mM resulted in a dose-dependent
   decrease in protease resistance of PrPSc. This finding prompted us to
   investigate whether tetracyclines affect prion infectivity by using an
   animal model of disease. Syrian hamsters were injected intracerebrally
   with 263K scrapie-infected brain homogenate that was coincubated with 1
   mM tetracycline hydrochloride, 1 mM doxycycline hyclate, or vehicle
   solution before inoculation. Hamsters injected with tetracycline-treated
   inoculum showed a significant delay in the onset of clinical signs of
   disease and prolonged survival time. These effects were paralleled by a
   delay in the appearance of magnetic-resonance abnormalities in the
   thalamus, neuropathological changes, and PrPSc accumulation. When
   tetracycline was preincubated with highly diluted scrapie-infected
   inoculum, one third of hamsters did not develop disease. Our data
   suggest that these well characterized antibiotics reduce prion
   infectivity through a direct interaction with PrPSc and are potentially
   useful for inactivation of BSE- or vCJD-contaminated products and
   prevention strategies.},

Abstract = {Classical swine fever (CSF) is of increasing concern in Europe where
   wild boar appear to play an important epidemiological role. In most
   parts of the continent, demographic trends are on the increase, due to
   improvement in game management. As a result of higher densities,
   populations become more susceptible to various infectious diseases,
   among which CSF is cause for particular concern. Wild boar do not appear
   to be a classic reservoir in most cases, but nevertheless may perpetuate
   foci of infection over the long term, constituting a real threat for the
   pig farming industry. Since the infection does not appear to spread
   easily in natural populations of free-ranging wild boars, control of the
   disease may be feasible. However, most of the appropriate measures, such
   as banning hunting, are not considered acceptable. Consequently, the
   expertise of wildlife disease specialists is required to help solve the
   problem when it occurs.},

Abstract = {In the present paper we report of the results of an immunohistochemical
   investigation to assess tissue tropism and viral replication in
   developing chicken, turkey, Muscovy duck and mallard duck embryos, of
   Italian H7N1 isolates belonging to different genetic lineages. LPAI
   isolates were chosen on the basis of the location in the phylogenetic
   tree: a progenitor strain, A/ty/Italy/977/V99, (exhibiting no additional
   glycosylation site, nAGS), strain A/ty/Italy/2379/V99 (AGS in position
   123) and strain A/ty/Italy/3675/V99 (AGS in position 149) were selected.
   The latter two strains belonged to distinct lineages originating from
   the pool of progenitor strains. HPAI isolate A/ty/Italy/4580/V99 was
   also included in the study. All the embryos tested supported the growth
   of HPAI. The LPAI isolates replicated readily in the allantoic layer of
   the CAM of all the species tested, and did not grow in the developing
   chicken, turkey and Muscovy duck embryos. In contrast, they replicated
   to different extents in the respiratory tract of the developing mallard
   embryo, which also presented lower mortality rates than the other

Abstract = {No direct evidence that genetically modified (GM) food may represent a
   possible danger for health has been reported so far; however, the
   scientific literature in this field is still quite poor. Therefore, we
   carried out an ultrastructural morphometrical and immunocytochemical
   study on hepatocytes from mice fed on GM soybean, in order to
   investigate eventual modifications of nuclear components of these cells
   involved in multiple metabolic pathways related to food processing. Our
   observations demonstrate significant modifications of some nuclear
   features in GM-fed mice. In particular, GM fed-mice show irregularly
   shaped nuclei, which generally represents an index of high metabolic
   rate, and a higher number of nuclear pores, suggestive of intense
   molecular trafficking. Moreover, the roundish nucleoli of control
   animals change in more irregular nucleoli with numerous small fibrillar
   centres and abundant dense fibrillar component in GM-fed mice,
   modifications typical of increased metabolic rate. Accordingly,
   nucleoplasmic (snRNPs and SC-35) and nucleolar (fibrillarin) splicing
   factors are more abundant in hepatocyte nuclei of GM-fed than in control
   mice. In conclusion, our data suggest that GM soybean intake can
   influence hepatocyte nuclear features in young and adult mice; however,
   the mechanisms responsible for such alterations remain unknown.},

   carrying the resistance genes, some molecular features were also
   investigated within isolates resistant to three or more antibiotics. A
   high proportion of isolates, 52.2 \% and 37.7 \%, respectively,
   belonging to both Typhimurium and other serotypes of animal origin,
   proved to be multidrug resistant. The DT104 complex specific multidrug
   pattern of resistance was quite infrequent among isolates other than
   Typhimurium, but resistances to nalidixic acid and kanamycin were more
   frequent within these last ones (36.9 \% vs. 11.4 \% and 56.5 \% vs. 2.2
   respectively). Class I integrons were detected in isolates of
   Typhimurium and seven different serotypes. The relevance of food animal

Abstract = {Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a
   recently emerged pathogen. Two PRRSV genotypes exist, North American and
   European, which are only 55-70\% identical at the nucleotide level.
   Previous studies have shown high nucleotide diversity in the North
   American genotype and low nucleotide diversity in the European genotype.
   Here, we analyzed the ORF5 and ORF7 genes for a large number of new
   European type PRRSV isolates in conjunction with existing database
   sequences. This new analysis showed that contrary to previous
   assumptions, genetic diversity is at least as high in the European
   genotype as in the North American genotype. Furthermore, we showed that
   genetic diversity of European type PRRSV has a marked geographical
   pattern, with exceptionally high genetic diversity among Italian
   sequences. The geographical pattern of diversity in relation to the
   epidemiology of PRRSV in Europe is discussed. Discrepancies between
   ORF5- and ORF7-based genealogies were observed, and further analysis of
   the data set confirmed the presence of recombination. We were therefore
   able to report the first observation of recombination in wild-type
   isolates of European genotype PRRSV (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

Abstract = {A seroprevalence survey and risk analysis of Neospora caninum and
   Leishmania infantum was conducted in dogs from an area of the Campania
   region of southern Italy, in order to investigate the co-infection of
   these two protozoa.
   Blood samples were collected from 1058 asymptomatic dogs over a 18
   months period. Serum samples were tested for antibodies to N. caninum
   and to L. infantum using the indirect fluorescent antibody test.
   Epidemiological data (breed, age, sex, and utilization) were collected
   and statistically analysed in relation to N. caninum and to L. infantum
   seropositivity and antibody titres.
   Out of the 1058 sera samples tested, 68 (6.4\%) were found to have
   antibodies to N. caninum, and 222 (21.0\%) to have antibodies to L.
   infantum. The co-presence of antibodies to N. caninum and to L infantum
   was found in 46 (4.3\%) dogs. Thus, 67.6\% of the dogs positive for N.
   caninum also had antibodies to L. infantum.
   The major risk factor for N. caninum seropositivity was the presence of
   antibodies to L. infantum, and the major risk factor for L. infantum
   seropositivity was the presence of antibodies to N. caninum. In
   addition, high N. caninum seroprevalence was closely correlated to Boxer
   breed, and high L. infantum seroprevatence was correlated to masculine
   gender and Setter and Pit bull breeds. Low L. infantum seroprevalence
   was closely correlated to Yorkshire breed.
   The findings of this survey indicate that in the Campania region of
   southern Italy the co-presence of antibodies to N. caninum and to L
   infantum is very common in dogs, and that infection by one protozoan
   seems to enhance the susceptibility to the other one. This is probably
   due to the immunological status of the tested dogs. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Natural infections with influenza A viruses have been reported in a
   variety of animal species including humans, pigs, horses, sea mammals,
   mustelids and birds. Occasionally devastating pandemics occur in humans.
   Although viruses of relatively few HA and NA subtype combinations have
   been isolated from mammalian species, all 15 HA subtypes and all 9 NA
   subtypes, in most combinations, have been isolated from birds.
   In the 20th century the sudden emergence of antigenically different
   strains transmissible in humans, termed antigenic shift, has occurred on
   four occasions, 1918 (H1N1), 1957 (H2N2), 1968 (H3N2) and 1977 (H1N1),
   each time resulting in a pandemic. Genetic analysis of the isolates
   demonstrated that `new' strains most certainly emerged after
   reassortment of genes of viruses of avian and human origin in a
   permissive host. The leading theory is that the pig represents the
   `mixing vessel' where this genetic reassortment may occur.
   In 1996, an H7N7 influenza virus of avian origin was isolated from a
   woman with a self-limiting conjunctivitis. During 1997 in Hong Kong, an
   H5N1 avian influenza virus was recognised as the cause of death of 6 of
   18 infected patients. Genetic analysis revealed these human isolates of
   H5N1 subtype to be indistinguishable from a highly pathogenic avian
   influenza virus that was endemic in the local poultry population. More
   recently, in March 1999, two independent isolations of influenza virus
   subtype H9N2 were made from girls aged one to four who recovered from
   flu-like illnesses in Hong Kong. Subsequently, five isolations of H9N2
   virus from humans on mainland China in August 1998 were reported. H9N2
   viruses were known to be widespread in poultry in China and other Asian
   countries.
   In all these cases there was no evidence of human to human spread except
   with the H5N1 infections where there was evidence of very limited
   spread. This is in keeping with the finding that all these viruses
   possessed all eight genes of avian origin. It may well be that infection
   of humans with avian influenza viruses occurs much more frequently than
   originally assumed, but due to their limited effect go unrecognised.
   For the human population as a whole the main danger of direct infection
   with avian influenza viruses appears to be if people infected with an
   `avian' virus are infected simultaneously with a `human' influenza
   virus. In such circumstances reassortment could occur with the potential
   emergence of a virus fully capable of spread in the human population,
   but with antigenic characteristics for which the human population was
   immunologically naive. Presumably this represents a very rare
   coincidence, but one which could result in a true influenza pandemic.

Abstract = {From the end of March to the beginning of December 1999, 199 outbreaks
   of low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) were diagnosed in the Veneto
   and Lombardia regions, which are located in the northern part of Italy.
   The virus responsible for the epidemic was characterized as a type A
   influenza virus of the H7N1 subtype of low pathogenicity. On the 17th of
   December, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was diagnosed in a
   meat turkey flock in which 100\% mortality was observed in 72 It. The
   infection spread to the industrial poultry population of northern Italy
   including chickens, guinea-fowl, quail, pheasants, ducks and ostriches
   for a total of 413 outbreaks. Over 13 million birds were affected by the
   epidemic, which caused dramatic economic losses to the Italian poultry
   industry with severe social and economic implications. The possibility
   of H7 virus transmission to humans in close contact with the outbreaks
   was evaluated through a serological survey. Seven hundred and fifty nine
   sera were collected and tested for the detection of anti-H7 antibodies
   by means of the micro-neutralization (MN) and single radial haemolysis
   (SRH) tests. All samples resulted negative. A limited number of clinical
   samples were also collected for attempted virus isolation with negative
   results. Current European legislation considers LPAI and HPAI as two
   completely distinct diseases, not contemplating any compulsory
   eradication policy for LPAI and requiring eradication for HPAI. Evidence
   collected during the Italian 1999-2000 epidemic indicates that LPAI due
   to viruses of the H7 subtype may mutate to HPAI, and, therefore, LPAI
   caused by viruses of the H5 or H7 subtypes must be controlled to avoid
   the emergence of HPAI. A reconsideration of the current definition of
   avian influenza adopted by the EU, could possibly be an aid to avoiding
   devastating epidemics for the poultry industry in Member States. (C)

Abstract = {Bartonella henselae has been identified and characterized for the first
   time in Italy. A strain, designed Pavia-1, was isolated from the blood
   of a cat whose owner developed cat scratch disease (CSD). Pavia-1 and
   two American B. henselae strains (Houston-1, ATCC 49882, type I and
   strain 269608, UC Davis, type 11) were compared by whole-cell fatty
   analysis (CFA), sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
   electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) for protein profiles, Western immunoblotting
   (WB) for reactivity with polyclonal antibodies, polymerase chain
   reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP),
   type-specific 16S rRNA PCRs, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
   (PFGE). Bartonella clarridgeiae (ATCC 51734) was also included for
   comparison. Pavia-1 was identified as a B. henselae type I. PFGE allowed
   differentiation between B. clarridgeiae and B. henselae and furthermore,
   between all the B. henselae strains. The fingerprints of PFGE observed
   for Pavia-1 were distinct from those of B. henselae type 11 and also of
   Houston-1, suggesting that the two type I strains derived from two
   different clones. These results show the capability of B. henselae to
   develop genotypic variability between genetically related strains. (C)

Abstract = {The pol and gag gene fragments of small ruminant lentivirus field
   isolates collected in the last decade in Italy were amplified,
   sequenced, and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the
   majority of ovine isolates form a distinct cluster more similar to
   caprine lentivirus prototypes than to the visna virus prototype. These
   findings confirm and extend those reported by Leroux et al. (Arch.
   Virol., 142:1125-1137, 1997). Moreover, we observed that a variable
   region of Gag, included in the fragment analyzed, corresponded to one of
   the three major capsid antigen epitopes, which suggests that the
   antibody response to this epitope may be type specific. To test this
   hypothesis, two recombinant peptides, derived from the Icelandic
   prototype K1514 and this novel genotype, were expressed and used in an
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to screen a panel of ovine and caprine
   sera collected from different geographical locations in Italy. Several
   sera reacted in a type-specific manner, indicating that in a diagnostic
   setting the combination of at least these two type-specific peptides is
   necessary to cover a wide range of infections. Additionally, these
   results support the hypothesis of cross-species transmission based on
   the phylogenetic analysis described above. This has implications for the
   control and eradication of small ruminant lentivirus infections.},

Title = {Distinction of scrapie phenotypes in sheep by lesion profiling},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PATHOLOGY},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {127},
Number = {1},
Pages = {45-57},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Major determinants of the pathological phenotype of natural scrapie are
   considered to be the agent strain and host prion protein (PrP) genotype,
   but the relationship between these is far from clear. Little is known
   about the strains that produce natural scrapie. A method of brain
   vacuolation profiling was developed which enables this aspect of disease
   phenotype to be characterized in detail. This method distinguished at
   least two distinct pathological phenotypes in sheep of a single genotype
   (ARQ/ARQ) from different flocks in the UK. Great similarity was also
   demonstrated between one of these phenotypes and the phenotype of sheep
   from a flock in Sardinia. The profile of four sheep of the same ARQ/ARQ
   genotype experimentally infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy
   (BSE) was determined for comparison. It would appear from these
   preliminary observations that the application of lesion profiling
   techniques to ovine transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) may
   contribute to the definition of a particular scrapie phenotype within a
   flock. It may, therefore, have potential for improving our understanding
   of current TSE phenotypes in sheep, with regard to the possibility of
   identifying those of bovine origin. Crown Copyright (C) 2002 Published

Abstract = {The antigenic linear map of swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV) has
   been studied using a repertoire of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised
   against a recombinant SVDV polyprotein, P1. Peptide-scanning analyses,
   cross-reactivity studies with homologous and heterologous viruses and
   predicted location on a computer-generated three-dimensional model of
   the capsid proteins have allowed the identification of five main linear
   sites. Two sites, the N terminus of VP3 and amino acids 51-60 on VP1,
   correspond to internal areas, conserved not only between SVDV isolates
   but also in the related enterovirus coxsackievirus B5. In contrast,
   three other regions, amino acids 142-161 of VP2, 61-70 of VP3 and the C
   terminus of VP1, are exposed on the external face of the capsid and
   subjected to antigenic variation, even among different SVDV isolates.
   Further minor sites that were antigenically conserved were identified on
   VP4. In contrast with conformational sites described previously, none of
   the linear epitopes identified in this work is involved in
   neutralization of virus infectivity and post-infection swine sera did
   not inhibit the binding of mAbs with the relevant epitopes. Both of
   these observations suggest that linear epitopes are poorly immunogenic
   in pigs. The characterization of linear sites has contributed to a
   better understanding of the antigenic structure of SVDV and mAbs used to
   this purpose may provide a useful tool for the improvement of diagnostic
   methods, such as antigen detection systems, and analyses of the
   antigenic profile of SVDV isolates.},

Abstract = {Among the consequences of the epidemic of highly pathogenic avian
   influenza which affected Italy between 1999 and 2000 was an epidemic of
   Newcastle disease in northern and central Italy. It affected
   industrially reared poultry, dealer flocks and backyard flocks, with a
   total of 254 outbreaks notified up to December 31, 2000. Virological
   investigations yielded virulent isolates of Newcastle disease virus,
   which produced intracerebral pathogenicity indices ranging from 1.6 to
   2.0 and which, on the basis of their monoclonal antibody binding
   patterns, could be classified as belonging to group C1. The clinical,
   gross and microscopical findings were typical of Newcastle disease, and
   different avian species were susceptible to different degrees. Chickens
   and guinea fowl appeared to be the most susceptible, followed by
   pheasants, turkeys and ostriches. The epidemiological inquiry
   highlighted the crucial role of a broiler hatchery in initiating the
   epidemic, and of dealers in perpetuating it. The control measures
   imposed by Directive 92/66/EEC are discussed with reference to the
   outbreaks in backyard flocks.},

Abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) in cattle remains a major zoonotic and economic
   problem in many countries. Since the standard diagnostic assay, the
   intradermal test (IDT) with bovine PPD tuberculin, has less than optimal
   accuracy in all situations, other diagnostic methods such as serological
   assays have been investigated. Because of fundamental concerns for the
   low sensitivity and specificity of previous ELISA protocols, a profiling
   ELISA with nine purified. recombinant proteins of TB; complex
   mycobacteria, was employed on samples front four groups of cattle: (a)
   naturally Mycobacterium avium-exposed and experimentally Mycobacterium
   bovis-infected, (b) officially-certified TB-free herds, (c) exposed to
   M. bovis in two field TB outbreaks and scored as bovine reactors in the
   gamma-IFN assay for bovine TB, (d) paratuberculosis (para TB)-infected.
   The described ELISA proved to be highly specific. In fact, the antibody
   (Ab) response could be consistently detected in 3 out of 3
   endotracheally-infected calves and in I out of 3 contact-infected
   calves. There was also a very low prevalence of low-titered,
   non-specific Ab responses in paraTB-infected animals. As for the animals
   exposed to field TB outbreaks, 16 out of 28 gamma-IFN positive cattle
   were also Ab-positive: importantly, 7 out of 12 gamma-IFN positive,
   IDT-negative cattle showed Ab responses to TB proteins, In general, the
   profile of the Ab response varied among animals the reaction to single
   recombinant antigens was sometimes transient and fluctuating, whereas
   the panel of antigens on the whole was indeed more effective in Ab
   detection. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Canine infections with Leishmania infantum are important as a cause of
   serious disease in the dog and as a reservoir for human visceral
   leishmaniasis (VL). Accurate diagnosis of canine infections is essential
   to the veterinary community and for VL surveillance programs. A
   standardized ELISA using a purified recombinant antigen (rK39) specific
   to VL was compared to the immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) as the
   standard. The ELISA was developed, optimized and evaluated using sera
   from 6368 dogs. The standardized ELISA and IFAT results were highly
   concordant. The timing and pattern of ELISA and IFAT seroconversion in
   dogs followed prospectively after natural infections were very similar.
   Antibodies reacting with rK39 were more common in asymptomatic canine
   infections than reported for subclinical human VL. The rK39 ELISA is a
   relatively simple and rapid assay for assessing the infection status of
   dogs, and is an alternative to IFAT, especially when screening large
   numbers of samples. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Three subtypes of influenza A viruses, H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2, co-evolve in
   pigs in Europe. H1N2 viruses isolated from pigs in France and Italy
   since 1997 were closely related to the H1N2 viruses which emerged in the
   UK in 1994. In particular, the close relationship of the neuraminidases
   (NAs) of these viruses to the NA of a previous UK H3N2 swine virus
   indicated that they had not acquired the NA from H3N2 swine viruses
   circulating in continental Europe. Moreover, antigenic and genetic
   heterogeneity among the H1N2 viruses appeared to be due in part to
   multiple introductions of viruses from the UK. On the other hand,
   comparisons of internal gene sequences indicated genetic exchange
   between the H1N2 viruses and co-circulating H1N1 and/or H3N2 subtypes.
   Most genes of the earlier (1997-1998) H1N2 isolates were more closely
   related to those of a contemporary French H1N1 isolate, whereas the
   genes of later (1999-2000) isolates, including the HAs of some H1N2
   viruses, were closely related to those of a distinct H1N1 antigenic
   variant which emerged in France in 1999. In contrast, an H3N2 virus
   isolated in France in 1999 was closely related antigenically and
   genetically to contemporary human A/Sydney/5/97-like viruses. These
   studies reveal interesting parallels between genetic and antigenic drift
   of H1N1 viruses in pig and human populations, and provide further
   examples of the contribution of genetic reassortment to the antigenic
   and genetic diversity of swine influenza viruses and the importance of
   the complement of internal genes in the evolution of epizootic strains.},

   origin for human consumption, According to the proposed procedure, 10 g
   of homogenised sample were extracted with acetonitrile in ultrasonic
   bath, the organic layer was evaporated to dryness and the residue
   dissolved in HCl 0.005M. After an initial washing with hexane to remove
   fats, the aqueous layer was purified on SPE C-2 column and the analytes
   were eluted with methanol, evaporated to dryness and reconstituted with
   phosphate buffer/acetonitrile (50150). The solution obtained was
   analysed by HPLC with diode array detector (DAD); this detector provides
   useful information about the peaks present in routine samples, because
   it gains not only retention times of analytes, as well as their
   UV-spectra. Benzthiazuron was used as internal standard and the method
   was validated in the range 10-100 ppb, as requested by the imposed
   limits. The mean recoveries in spiked samples ranged between 70\% and
   95\%, for 10 and 100 ppb respectively. The developed method resulted
   sensitive, simple and fast. It is particularly suitable for laboratories
   that execute screening analysis on a great number of samples, observing

Abstract = {Two hundred and forty-five dogs were examined serologically for the
   presence of antibodies against different serovars of Leptospira
   interrogans. The dogs belonged to five different groups: group 1 was
   composed of clinically healthy pet dogs referred for a regular
   veterinary check-up visit or for vaccination; group 2 was composed of
   stray dogs; and groups 3, 4 and 5 were composed of dogs maintained in
   three different kennels which had varying standards of hygiene.
   Seventy-two out of the 245 dogs examined were seropositive for
   leptospirosis. In group 1, there were 3.4 per cent seropositive dogs; in
   group 2, 30.3 per cent; in group 3, 13.8 per cent; in group 4, 38.6 per
   cent; and in group 5, 49.2 per cent. This study demonstrates that
   leptospiral infection is common in dogs housed in kennels, despite most
   of them being vaccinated, and that crowding of animals into unsanitary
   quarters is associated with a high prevalence of infection. The most
   common infecting serovars found were bratislava, and grippotyphosa,
   confirming recent observations that demonstrate a significant change in
   the epidemiology of canine leptospirosis.},

Abstract = {To study variations in the carcass characteristics of Girgentana kids
   slaughtered at 25 or 35 days of age and litter size (single or twin), 27
   male kids were slaughtered and body components, carcass joints, pelvic
   limb tissue composition, meat fatty acid composition and M. longissimus
   dorsi (LD) colour were evaluated. Girgentana kids slaughtered at 35 days
   had greater live weights (6.4 kg versus 5.0 kg; P less than or equal to
   0.01), carcass weights (4.5 kg versus 3.6 kg; P less than or equal to
   0.01), muscle contents (57.6\% versus 54.9\%; P less than or equal to
   0.01) but similar dressing percentages (70.1\% versus 70.6\%) as
   compared to kids slaughtered at 25 days. Twin kids had a higher muscle
   percentage (57.3\% versus 55.2\%; P less than or equal to 0.05) and
   similar fat percentage (5.5\% versus 6.0\%) but a higher
   unsaturated/saturated fatty acid ratio (1.17 versus 1.01; P less than or
   equal to 0.05). Meat colour was not influenced by any factors
   considered. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Because of the frequent exposure of cattle to mycobacteria of the
   avium/intracellulare group, an investigation was carried out into the
   possible repercussions thereof on the diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis.
   Three calves from a bovine tuberculosis-free herd, scored avian reactors
   in the gamma-interferon assay for bovine tuberculosis, were sedated and
   inoculated endotracheally with a virulent Mycobacterium bovis strain.
   Then, three other avian reactors were housed with the above donor
   calves. Mycobacterium bovis was isolated from the nasal swabs of the
   three endotracheally infected, donor calves. On these samples, TB
   complex-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for IS6110 were
   also positive, albeit with a different time kinetics. The three
   contact-infected calves showed clear immunological signs of infection;
   however, their nasal swabs were always PCR-negative and only
   Mycobacterium avium was isolated. In the endotracheally infected donor
   calves there was a rise of the gamma-interferon responses to avian and
   bovine purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculins. which reached the
   same stable plateau levels over the whole experiment. The above effect
   was also observed in the contact-infected calves, even though the
   response to avian PPD tuberculin always remained at a higher level. By
   using conventional bovine and avian PPD tuberculins, the comparative
   intradermal test was generally positive in endotracheally infected, as
   opposed to contact-infected calves; a positive intradermal test for M.
   bovis was obtained in two contact-infected calves by different bovine
   PPD tuberculins based on M. bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)
   secreted or somatic antigens. It was concluded that If. bovis infection
   may be concealed for some time in cattle sensitized by mycobacteria of
   the avium/intracellulare group and that different diagnostic procedures
   should be adopted for such animals.},

Abstract = {The African trypanosomes T. equiperdum and T. evansi are two pathogenic
   species in horses with a wide distribution in countries in tropical and
   subtropical areas of Africa, Asia and part of Europe in the first case
   and in Africa, Asia and America for the second. These species are the
   etiological agents of Dourine and Surra or Derrengadera respectively,
   both are morphologically and antigenically related. It is only possible
   to differentiate both species by the clinical symptoms and the mechanism
   of transmission of the infection, which is through coitus for T.
   equiperdum and by insect bites by hematophagous files for T. evansi.
   Secreting hybrids of monoclonal antibodies were prepared against T.
   equiperdum and T. evansi. They were used a total hydrolyzed antigens for
   both species and injected in female Balb/c mice intraperitoneally
   without adjuvant. The hybridomas were cloned and subcloned and seven
   positive hybridomas were obtained for each trypanosome species. The
   monoclonal antibodies for both species proved to have relatively low
   titles (1:80); to be of the IgM class and to have a high cross
   reactivity with antigens of both species. They were unable to react
   against separated antigens in western blotting. They reacted
   appropriately against antigens in ELISA. Our results demonstrate that
   both species are antigenically very similar, probably due to the
   structure of the glycosidic moiety of the VSG. These monoclonal
   antibodies can be useful as tools for the identification and detection
   of these Trypanosoma species where they do not occur in mixed infections
   (East Europe and America).},

Abstract = {Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the only effective therapeutic
   modality in severe acute hepatic failure (AHF). The scarcity of organs
   for transplantation leads to an urgent necessity for temporary liver
   support treatments in AHF patients. A hepatocyte-based bioartificial
   liver (BAL) is under investigation with the main purpose to serve as
   bridging treatment until a liver becomes available for OLT or to promote
   spontaneous liver regeneration. We developed a novel radial-flow
   bioreactor (RFB) for three-dimensional, high-density hepatocyte culture
   and an integrated pumping apparatus in which, after plasmapheresis, the
   patient's plasma is recirculated through the hepatocyte-filled RFB. Two
   hundred thirty grams of freshly isolated porcine hepatocytes were loaded
   into the RFB for clinical liver support treatment. The BAL system was
   used 8 times in supporting 7 AHF patients in grade III-IV coma, all
   waiting for an urgent OLT Three patients with no history of previous
   liver diseases were affected by fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) due to
   hepatitis B virus, 3 by primary non-function (PNF) of the transplanted
   liver, and one by AHF due to previous abdominal trauma and liver
   surgery. Six out of 7 patients underwent OLT following BAL treatment(s),
   which lasted 6-24 hours. All patients tolerated the procedures well, as
   shown by an improvement in the level of encephalopathy, a decrease in
   serum ammonia, transaminases and an amelioration of the prothrombin
   time, with full neurological recovery after OLT Our initial clinical
   experience confirms the safety of this BAL configuration and suggests
   its clinical efficacy as a temporary liver support system in AHF
   patients.},

Abstract = {The effect of melatonin on experimental prolonged cyclosporine A (CsA)
   nephrotoxicity was analyzed by electron microscopy and morphometry.
   Twenty female Wistar rats were divided into groups that received (1) CsA
   at a therapeutic dose (15 mg/kg/day) sc for 40 days; (2) olive oil, CsA
   vehicle, as controls; (3) CsA plus melaton (1 mg/kg) ip for the same
   time; (4) melatonin alone, as additional controls. All controls had
   normal renal ultrastructure. However, in CsA group, both tubular and
   glomerular alterations were observed. The authors found apoptotic and
   necrotic proximal tubules with disrupted brush border, swollen
   mitochondria, abundant lysosomes; in the glomerulus, amorphous basement
   membrane, and abnormal mesangial matrix. CsA plus melatonin
   administration partly prevented these changes. Nevertheless, fibrillar
   deposits in podocytes and basolateral membrane dilatations in proximal
   tubules were observed. Histopathological analysis on semithin sections
   and ultrastructural morphometry were also performed. CsA induced
   interstitial fibrosis, atrophy, and PAS positive inclusions in the
   proximal tubules. Moreover, CsA reduced glomerular and mesangial volume
   but enhanced mesangial matrix volume and basement membrane thickness.
   After CsA plus melatonin, these parameters were reduced in the proximal
   tubules and restored in the glomerulus. In conclusion, melatonin
   attenuated morpho-quantitative alterations induced by CsA in the rat
   kidney.},

Abstract = {Genetic and antigenic properties of 62 field isolates of canine
   parvovirus (CPV-2) collected from 1994 to 2001 in Italy were
   investigated. Antigenic characterisation was conducted using specific
   monoclonal antibodies (Mabs). The VP1\textbackslash{}VP2 gene was
   amplified by PCR and characterised with restriction endonucleases to
   detect the 297 and 265 variant. The VP2 gene of 16 isolates was
   sequenced and molecular genetic analysis was conducted. The antigenic
   type prevalent among our isolates is type 2a as well as the 297 variant,
   which is also prevalent in the rest of Europe. Only the 9.7\% of the
   isolates have the T265P mutation. The VP2 sequences of CPV-2 isolates
   were very similar to recent Asian isolates. In the threefold spike of
   CPV-699 a coding change was detected in the 440 residue where threonine
   was substituted by alanine: the same mutation has been found in two
   Asian CPV-2 isolates from leopard cats {[}Virology 278 (2000) 13].
   Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Italian CPV-2 strains followed
   the same evolution as observed in other countries and they gave no
   indication of a separate lineage. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Title = {H3N2 influenza viruses from domestic chickens in Italy: an increasing

Abstract = {In Italy, multiple H3N2 influenza viruses were isolated from chickens
   with mild respiratory disease and were shown to replicate in the
   respiratory tracts of experimentally infected chickens; this finding is
   the first to show that H3N2 influenza viruses can replicate and cause
   disease in chickens. H3N2 influenza viruses in pigs on nearby farms
   seemed a likely source of the virus; however, antigenic and molecular
   analyses revealed that the gene segments of the viruses in chickens were
   mainly of Eurasian avian origin and were distinguishable from those
   isolated from pigs and wild aquatic birds in Italy. Thus, several
   different H3 influenza viruses were circulating in Italy, but we failed
   to identify the source of the chicken H3N2 influenza viruses that have
   disappeared subsequently from Italian poultry. Until recently, the
   transmission of influenza viruses (other than the H5 and H7 subtypes)
   from their reservoir in aquatic birds to chickens was rarely detected
   and highly pathogenic and non-pathogenic viruses were considered to be
   restricted to poultry species. However, the recent reports of the
   transmission of H9N2 and H5N1 influenza viruses to chickens in Hong Kong
   and, subsequently, to humans and our findings of the transmission of
   H3N2 influenza viruses to domestic chickens in Italy suggest an
   increased role for chickens as an intermediate host in the ecology of
   influenza.},

Title = {Sequence analysis of the genes encoding for the major virulence factors

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2002},

Abstract = {Aims: This study was performed to analyse the molecular characteristics
   of genes encoding for the major virulence factors in Bacillus anthracis
   vaccine strain `Carbosap' compared with the wild B. anthracis strain, to
   evaluate the basis of attenuation.
   Methods and Results: The molecular characteristics of the B. anthracis
   `Carbosap' vaccine strain, used as vaccine in Italy, were analysed in
   comparison with a B. anthracis virulent strain. Despite the presence of
   the two virulence plasmids pXO1 and pXO2, the `Carbosap' strain proved
   to be protective for cattle. The presence of the regulatory genes atxA
   and pagR and the gerX operon, known to be involved in the virulence, was
   verified. In addition, all genes were sequenced. The results showed that
   no molecular differences between `Carbosap' and the virulent strain were
   evident.
   Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that the attenuation of
   the `Carbosap' vaccine strain is not due to the lack of virulence genes
   or to modifications occurring on the sequence of these genes. Therefore,
   other virulence factors, still unknown, could be involved in the
   pathogenic mechanisms.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: This paper adds new information
   regarding the molecular characteristics of the vaccine strain `Carbosap'
   and highlights the need to better understand the virulence factors
   involved in the pathogenicity of B. anthracis strains.},

Title = {Characterization of neutralization sites on the circulating variant of
   swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV): a new site is shared by SVDV and
   the related coxsackie B5 virus},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY},
Year = {2002},

Abstract = {Using a panel of new monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), five neutralizing,
   conformation-dependent sites have been identified on the antigenic
   variant of swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV) circulating currently.
   In studies on the antigenic conservation of these sites, the four
   antigenic/ genetic groups of SVDV described showed distinguishable
   patterns, confirming this classification. By sequencing mAb-resistant
   mutants, the five sites have been mapped precisely and localized on a
   three-dimensional model of the SVDV capsid. All were found to be
   orientated, to a different extent, towards the external surface of the
   capsid. Three of the five sites, located in VP1, VP2 and VP3, correspond
   to epitopes identified previously in historic isolates as sites 1, 2a
   and 3b, respectively. Another site, site IV, which maps to position 2 58
   of VP1, corresponds to an epitope reported recently and is described in
   this study to be specific for isolates of the most recent antigenic
   group of SVDV. A fifth site is described for the first time and
   corresponds to the unique neutralizing site that is common to both SVDV
   and coxsackie B5 virus; it maps to positions 95 and 9S of VP1, but may
   also include positions nearby that belong to site 1 on the BC-loop of
   VP1, suggesting the classification of site Ia. These results may have
   useful diagnostic and epidemiological applications, since mAbs to the
   new conserved site Ia provide universal reagents for SVDV detection
   systems, while the specificity of mAbs to site IV make them unique
   markers for the most recent strains of SVIDV.},

Title = {Response to oxidative stress as a welfare parameter in swine},
Journal = {REDOX REPORT},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {159-163},
Abstract = {In pigs, the genetic selection for lean, large muscle blocks and fast
   growth has been linked to an increased prevalence of metabolic diseases
   such as porcine stress syndrome and mulberry heart disease. These
   diseases are associated with cardiovascular inadequacy, which may lead
   to oxidative stress. In the present study, reactive oxygen metabolites
   (ROMs) and the anti-oxidant power (OXY) in sera of different swine
   groups were investigated. The following groups were selected (each
   around 80 kg body weight): wild boars (WB), Cinta Senese (CS), and
   Landrace x Large White (LxLW), the latter as both specific pathogen-free
   (SPF) and intensively farmed animals. In addition, a group of LxLW
   agonic sows (AS) was also investigated; this group is known to be under
   oxidative stress. Two colorimetric micromethods were used to measure
   ROMs and OXY, ROMs were expressed as MM H2O2 and OXY as muM HOCl
   neutralised. Between groups, average ROM and OXY values were found to be
   significantly different by one-way ANOVA (P < 0.001). ROM levels were
   lower in WB (13.41 +/- 1.85) and CS (19.27 +/- 1.68), and highest in
   LxLW (42.00 +/- 1.36). OXY values ranged from 260.10 +/- 22.13 (WB) to
   396.90 +/- 9.83 (LxLW). Only one swine group (the CS group) showed a
   significant, positive correlation between ROM and OXY values. The AS
   group even showed a negative correlation between ROM and OXY values.
   These results imply satisfactory environmental coping occurred only
   within the CS group. Results are discussed in the light of animal
   welfare legislation, food safety and consumers' protection.},

Title = {Wild rats as monitors of environmental lead contamination in the urban

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {117},
Number = {2},
Pages = {255-259},
Abstract = {Twenty-one wild brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) were collected from four
   areas of Milan (Italy). Main organs were harvested from each rat, fixed
   in 10\% neutral buffer formalin, and embedded in paraffin. Organ
   sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, kidney sections were
   also stained with the Ziehl-Neelsen method. Graphite furnace atomic
   absorption spectrophotometry was performed on all kidney samples. The
   presence of inclusion bodies and karyocytomegaly was scored. Six adult
   rats out of 21 (28.6\%) showed kariocytomegaly and intranuclear
   inclusion bodies of the renal proximal tubules, characteristic of lead
   toxicity. The nuclear inclusion bodies were always Ziehl-Neelsen
   positive. The six rats which showed the characteristic histological
   alterations ascribed to lead, had lead concentrations statistically
   higher than the three control rats (4 mug/g wet wt. versus 0.09 mug/g
   wet wt., P < 0.001) and than the captured wild rats. Intranuclear
   inclusion bodies were found in rats with kidney lead concentrations
   greater than 0.6 mug/g wet weight. There were significant differences
   between the four areas of capture. The incidence of intranuclear
   inclusion bodies and karyocytomegaly in proximal tubular cells was
   higher in rats with high lead levels detected by spectrophotometry. The
   present results indicate a renal lead concentration of 0.6 mug/g wet
   weight as a threshold to detect histologic kidney changes due to lead
   absorption. Results demonstrate that the examination of adult
   free-living rats may be considered an appropriate method to obtain a
   rapid, sensitive, easy, cost effective estimate of lead contamination in
   urban areas. Animal models allow us to evaluate potential human health
   risk associated with environmental contamination. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Title = {Growth performance, behaviour, forestomach development and meat quality
   of veal calves provided with barley grain or ground wheat straw for
   welfare purpose},

Abstract = {Two different feeding plans for veal calves were compared in the study:
   a traditional liquid diet supplemented with 250 g/calf/d of barley grain
   or with 250 g/calf/d of ground wheat straw. The two solid feeds had
   different chemical composition but a similar particle size obtained by
   grinding the straw in a mill with an 8-mm mesh screen. Twenty-four
   Polish Friesian male calves were used in the study and they were housed
   in individual wooden stalls (0.83 x 1.80 m). The health status of all
   the calves was satisfactory for the entire fattening period and no
   specific medical treatment was required during the trial. Calves fed
   wheat straw showed a greater intake of solid feed (196 vs. 139 g/d;
   P<0.01) and a higher average daily gain (1288 vs. 1203 g/d; P<0.05) than
   those receiving barley grain. The consumption of milk replacer was not
   affected by the type of solid feed and no milk refusal episodes were
   detected. The haemoglobin concentration was similar in calves receiving
   the two feeding treatments despite the higher iron intake provided by
   the wheat straw throughout the fattening period (2.12 vs. 1.15 g;
   P<0.001). It is likely that the iron in wheat straw was less available
   for the calves' metabolism. Feeding behaviour was affected by the
   provision of solid feeds. Eating and chewing were prolonged in calves
   receiving ground wheat straw and the same solid feed reduced the
   frequency of oral stereotypies at the end of the fattening period. At
   the slaughterhouse, no differences were observed between the feeding
   treatments as regards carcass weight and dressing percentage. The calves
   fed ground wheat straw had a heavier weight of the empty omasum (518 vs.
   341 g; P<0.01) whereas the empty weight of the reticulorumen and
   abomasum were similar to those of calves fed barley grain. The incidence
   of abomasal erosions, ulcers and scars was similar in both treatments;
   however the index of abomasal damage, which considers the number and the
   seriousness of different type of lesions, was higher in calves receiving
   barley grain. Therefore, the grinding of straw particles, as opposed to
   barley grain, can reduce the abrasiveness of roughage at the abomasum
   level. Visual evaluation of the carcass colour and instrumental
   measurement of meat colour did not show significant differences between
   diets. The study confirmed that in the veal calf, carcass and meat
   colour are not strictly correlated with the iron intake from solid
   feeds.},

   management implications},
Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {69},
Number = {4},
Pages = {367-379},
Abstract = {Genetic diversity and differentiation were assessed in 12 populations of
   roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, from Italy, through examination of
   restriction fragment length polymorphism of two segments in the
   mitochondrial genome, the D-loop and NADH dehydrogenase 1, and analysis
   of 13 microsatellite loci. Both methods yielded concordant results and
   provided evidence for the existence of two genetically distinct lineages
   of roe deer in the Italian peninsula. One lineage occurs in populations
   of the Alpine arc, whilst the other is found in those of
   central-southern Italy, where the existence of subspecies C. c. italicus
   had been previously proposed. This southern lineage could have a more
   ancient origin or, alternatively, diverged as a consequence of movements
   of populations southwards during the Late Pleistocene. The unexpected
   rediscovery of dense populations of C. c. italicus in southern Tuscany
   marks them as the most suitable source of roe deer for reintroductions
   into southern Italy, a very large area where presently the Italian roe
   deer is nearly extinct. A Bayesian approach to microsatellite data
   allowed a finer resolution of population structure, indicating that some
   populations in central Italy, as well as in the western Alps, are
   admixed, and share ancestry partly in non Italian gene pools, suggesting
   that human manipulation has greatly affected the natural genetic
   structure of populations. A palaeontological perspective of the former
   presence of roe deer in Italy and implications for the management and
   conservation of C c. italicus are provided.},

Abstract = {The objective of the study was to determine for Australian wild rabbits
   the specificity of a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   (cELISA) developed in Italy for detecting antibodies to RHDV. Analysis
   of 657 sera collected before the arrival of RHDV (pre-RHD) indicated
   that between 17 and 38\% appeared to give false positive results
   depending on the cut-off criteria used. The finding of pre-RHD sera
   reacting positively in the cELISA prompted the testing of sera in a
   cELISA using as antigen smooth forms of RHDV (cELISA-sf) and a
   solid-phase ELISA (spELISA), both of which detect reactivity to an
   epitope shared by the lagomorph caliciviruses. Testing of a subset of
   the pre-RHD sera in the cELISA-sf and the spELISA revealed that 86 and
   91\%, respectively, were positive. Similar results were obtained for a
   set of sera collected pre-RHD in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT).
   Sera collected from wild-stock rabbits born and raised in isolation in
   an animal house in the ACT were all negative in the cELISA, 6\% were
   positive in the cELISA-sf and 13\% in the spELISA. It was concluded that
   a calicivirus related to RHDV and European brown hare syndrome virus
   (EBHSV) was present in the rabbit population before the arrival of RHDV,
   and may still be present. The potential consequences of these findings
   for epidemiological studies on RHD in Australia are discussed.},

Title = {Statistical models for the effect of age and maternal antibodies on the
   development of rabbit haemorrhagic disease in Australian wild rabbits},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {29},
Number = {6},
Pages = {663-671},
Abstract = {Statistical models have been developed to explain the influence of age
   and maternal antibody on the outcome of rabbit haemorrhagic disease
   virus (RHDV) infection of Australian wild rabbit kittens in terms of
   survival, survival time in those that failed to survive, and pyrexia
   (temperature response, or fever). Similar models describing survival and
   survival time were derived by substituting mass for age, owing to their
   high correlation. The models were developed from data obtained following
   the inoculation of 78 kittens 5-11 weeks old born to does with varying
   levels of alpha-RHDV immunoglobulin (IgG) antibody as measured by
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A significant correlation was
   found between survival and doe titre but not between survival and kitten
   titre. It was deduced that maternal antibody in kittens can fall below
   the level of detection in the ELISA but still be protective. The model
   describing the influence of age and doe titre had the form
   logit(SURVIVAL) = 5.98 - 0.944(AGE) + 0.000473(DOE TITRE), and showed,
   for example, that kittens born to seronegative does had a 50\%
   probability of survival at about 6 weeks old and, with a doe titre of 10
   240, a 50\% probability of survival at about 11 weeks old. There was a
   significant influence of kitten titre on pyrexia, and the model
   developed had the form logit(TEMPERATURE RESPONSE) = 1.436 -
   0.0531(KITTEN TITRE). The influence of age and maternal antibody on
   survival time was fitted using Cox proportional hazard models. A
   parametric regression gave rise to a final model of the form S(t
   \textbackslash{} AGE, DOE TITRE) = exp{[}-(t/eta(AGE))(1.7979)], where.
   AGE = exp{[}7.1838 - 0.2976(AGE) + 0.000227(DOE TITRE)]. The model
   showed that survival time decreased with age, but for each age category
   there was an increase in survival time with increasing doe titre. Kitten
   titre had only a marginally significant effect on seroconversion; there
   was no effect of kitten age or mass, or of doe titre. No kitten with a
   titre of 60 or more seroconverted.},

Abstract = {The effect of succynil-beta -cyclodextrin (beta -CD-Su), dimethyl-beta
   -cyclodextrin (DIMEB) and beta -cyclodextrin (beta -CD) on the
   fluorescence of aflatoxins B-1, B-2, G(1), G(2) and M-1 (AFB(1), AFB(2),
   AFG(1), AFG(2) and AFM(1)) was studied: beta -CD-Su promoted the largest
   fluorescence enhancement for AFB(1) and AFM(1) while DIMEB showed better
   results for AFG(1). On the basis of the fluorescence enhancement, a new
   RP-HPLC method for detecting aflatoxins B-1, B-2, G(1), G(2) and M-1 was
   developed using cyclodextrins directly dissolved in the LC eluent.
   Aflatoxins B-1, B-2, G(1) and G(2) were resolved using a MICRA NPS ODS-1
   column using methanol-water as mobile phase to which 6x10(-3) M beta
   -CD-Su or beta -CD were added. Chromatographic responses of AFB(1) and
   AFG(1) achieved using beta -CD dissolved in the mobile phase were
   enhanced, respectively, 8 and 12 times, and 10 and 15 times with beta

Abstract = {The influence of three types of farm management on the occurrence of Q
   fever in cattle was investigated by means of a serological study carried
   out in Irpinia in southern Italy. Twenty-one herds were permanently
   housed, 26 were housed in winter and turned out to graze, in the spring,
   and six herds were kept outdoors throughout the year. Blood samples were
   taken from 1188 cattle and tested by an indirect immunofluorescence
   assay. The overall seroprevalence of Q fever was 14.4 per cent. The
   herds which were housed in winter and turned out in the spring had the
   highest seroprevalence of 19.6 per cent, followed by the permanently
   housed animals with a seroprevalence of 13.2 per cent and the unhoused
   cattle had a much lower seroprevalence of 1.9 per cent.},

Abstract = {Dogs are the domestic reservoir of Leishmania infantum Nicolle
   (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae). the agent of zoonotic human visceral
   leishmaniasis. In southern Europe. where canine leishmaniasis (CanL) is
   widespread due to L. infantum, killing seropositive dogs is considered
   unacceptable and drug treatment has low efficacy in preventing
   transmission. We made a field evaluation of the efficacy of deltamethrin
   dog collars in a CanL focus of southern Italy, Mount Vesuvius area of
   Campania region. where the vector is Phlebotomus perniciosus Newstead
   (Diptera: Psychodidae). by assessing their impact on the incidence of
   CanL in an intervention town. compared to that in dogs of control towns
   where no collars were fitted. During two consecutive transmission
   seasons, collars were fitted to 350 (1998) and 354 (1999) dogs from San
   Sebastiano al Vesuvio (70\% of the canine population). Control dogs (371
   and 264 in the 2 years, respectively) were from four towns of the same
   area. Before each transmission season, the CanL seroprevalence in the
   intervention and control towns was evaluated by cross-sectional surveys
   and found to be similar (about 15\% in 1998 and 10\% in 1999,
   respectively). After each transmission period, incidence rates of
   seroconversions,Acre determined in adult dogs that were serologically
   negative before the season under evaluation. and in puppies. After the
   1998 season. 2.7\% of the dogs in the intervention town seroconverted
   compared to 5.4\% in the control towns (50\% protection. P=0.15). After
   the 1999 season, 3.5\% of collared dogs seroconverted compared to 25.8\%
   of control dogs (86\% protection, P<0.001). The increase in
   seroconversion rates recorded in control dogs suggests an increase in
   the Leishmania force of infection in the canine reservoir during the
   1999 sandfly season. as supported by the concomitant increase of human
   cases in control towns and in the whole Campania region. Our results
   suggest that the impact of mass use of deltamethrin-impregnated dog
   collars on the incidence of CanL may be negligible during low
   transmission seasons, or probably in low endemic foci, but can be very
   strong when the force of transmission is high.},

Abstract = {The oxidative metabolism of monensin, an ionophore antibiotic
   extensively used in veterinary practice as a coccidiostat and a growth
   promoter, was studied in hepatic microsomal preparations from horses,
   pigs, broiler chicks, cattle and rats. As assayed by the measurement of
   the amount of the released formaldehyde, the rate of monensin
   O-demethylation was nearly of the same order of magnitude in all
   species, but total monensin metabolism, which was estimated by measuring
   the rate of substrate disappearance by a high-performance liquid
   chromatography (HPLC) method, was highest in cattle, intermediate in
   rats, chicks and pigs, and lowest in horses. When expressed as turnover
   number (nmol of metabolized monensin/min nmol cytochrome P450(-1)), the
   catalytic efficiency (chick >> cattle > pig approximate to rat > horse)
   was found to correlate inversely with the well known interspecies
   differences in the susceptibility to the toxic effects of the ionophore,
   which is characterized by an oral LD50 of 2-3 mg/kg bodyweight (bw) in
   horses, 50-80 mg/kg bw in cattle and 200 mg/kg bw in chicks. Chick and
   cattle microsomes also displayed both the highest catalytic efficiency
   toward two P450 3A dependent substrates (erythromycin and
   triacetyloleandomycin) and the highest immunodetectable levels of
   proteins cross-reacting with anti rat P450 3A1/2. Further studies are
   required to define the role played by this isoenzyme in the oxidative
   biotransformation of the drug in food producing species.},

Abstract = {To gain an insight into the molecular epidemiology of classical swine
   fever (CSF) in Italy, virus isolates originating from outbreaks that
   occurred between 1985 and 2000 in wild boar or in domestic pigs in
   mainland Italy and in Sardinia were analysed by genetic typing. For
   this, a fragment (190 nucleotides) of the E2 glycoprotein gene was
   sequenced and phylogenetic analyses were performed, including older
   Italian isolates and isolates from recent outbreaks in Europe for
   comparison. The results show that in mainland Italy, several independent
   epidemiological events occurred in the last decade. In the north of the
   country, viruses of genotype 2.2 have persisted in wild boar, causing
   sporadic outbreaks in domestic pigs. In contrast, viruses of subgroups
   2.1 and 2.3 appeared only intermittently in different regions of the
   mainland. In 1997, classical swine fever virus (CSFV) isolates belonging
   to the subgroup 2.1 and genetically and epidemiologically related to the
   Dutch isolate in Venhorst, affected domestic pigs exclusively. The
   isolates of subgroup 2.3, derived from wild boar as well as from
   domestic pigs were closely related to isolates from Germany and Poland.
   In Sardinia, CSF is an endemic in wild boar and affects domestic pigs
   also. Genetic typing showed that viruses of subgroups 1.1 and 2.3 have
   been present, the last ones being unrelated to the mainland viruses of
   the same subgroup. Due to the large quantities of pig and wild boar meat
   imported in some parts of Italy, it cannot be established if these
   viruses were always present in either the mainland or Sardinia, or if
   they represent recent introductions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {Two commercial marker vaccines against classical swine fever virus
   (CSFV) and companion diagnostic tests were examined in 160 conventional
   pigs. To test the vaccines in a ``worst case scenario{''}, group of 10
   weaners were vaccinated using a single dose of an E2 (gp55) based
   vaccine at days -21, -14, -10 or -7, and subsequently challenged at day
   0. The challenge virus was CSFV 277, originating from a recent outbreak
   of classical swine fever (CSF) in Germany. In all groups, only 5 out of
   10 pigs were challenged; the remaining 5 pigs served as vaccinated
   contact controls. Also, three control groups, each consisting of 10
   non-vaccinated pigs, were challenged in parallel to the vaccinated
   animals.
   CSFV could be isolated from all non-vaccinated pigs, Among these pigs
   40\% displayed a chronic course of the infection (virus positive for
   more than 10 days). Pigs vaccinated 21 or 14 days before challenge
   displayed no clinical signs of CSFV after challenge. However, they were
   still able to replicate CSFV when challenged, as measured by reisolation
   of CSFV from leukocytes of the directly challenged pigs. CSFV could be
   isolated from the leucocytes of 25\% of the pigs vaccinated 21 days
   before challenge and 50\% of the pigs vaccinated 14 days before
   challenge. Chronic infection was not observed, but transmission to one
   vaccinated contact pig occurred.
   From all pigs vaccinated 10 or 7 days before challenge, CSFV could be
   reisolated. We observed a chronic course of infection in 5\% of pigs
   vaccinated 10 days before challenge and in 30\% of pigs vaccinated 7
   days before challenge. The mortality rate was 20\% in the pigs
   vaccinated 10 days before challenge, and varied between 20 and 80\% in
   pigs vaccinated 7 days prior to challenge. The contact animals had lower
   mortality (0-20\%) than directly challenged pigs, probably mirroring the
   delayed time point of infection. There was thus some protection against
   clinical illness by both marker vaccines, but not a solid protection
   against infection and virus shedding. The efficacy of the vaccine was
   best if used 3 weeks before challenge and a clear correlation between
   time inter-Val from vaccination to challenge and the level of virus
   shedding was observed. Each vaccine had its own accompanying
   discriminatory ELISA, but 18\% of the virus positive pigs never
   scroconverted in these tests. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The circular, single-stranded DNA genome of a novel circovirus of
   canaries, tentatively named canary circovirus (CaCV), was cloned and
   sequenced. Sequence analysis indicated that the genome was 1952
   nucleotides (nt) in size and had the potential to encode three viral
   proteins, including the putative capsid and replication-associated (Rep)
   proteins. The CaCV genome shared greatest sequence similarity (58.3\% nt
   identity) with the newly characterized columbid circovirus (CoCV) and
   was more distantly related to the two porcine circovirus strains, PCV1
   and PCV2, beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) and a recently isolated
   goose circovirus (GCV) isolate (46.8-50.9\% nt identity). In common with
   other members of the Circovirus genus, several nt structures and amino
   acid motifs thought to be implicated in virus replication were
   identified on the putative viral strand. Phylogenetic analysis of both
   the capsid and Rep protein-coding regions provided further evidence that
   CaCV is more closely related to CoCV and BFDV and more distantly related
   to GCV, PCV1 and PCV2.},

Abstract = {The superficial inguinal lymph nodes of 10 piglets which had died
   spontaneously of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), in
   which the porcine circovirus type II (PCV-II) genome was revealed by
   PCR, were submitted to immunohistochemical investigation for CD4, CD8,
   IgM, MAC387, S-100 protein, vimentin and F-VIII-RA and compared with
   three normal cases. The lymph node reaction was graded as initial,
   intermediate and end stage according to histological criteria. In the
   initial and intermediate stages, absence of follicles and depletion of
   lymphocytes were evident. Associated with this was a reduction in
   numbers of interfollicular dendritic cells and interdigitating cells and
   a reduction/absence of B cells and mainly CD4+ T lymphocytes. In the end
   stage the reduced expression of high endothelial venules and the
   prevalence of the stromal component of the lymph node was prominent, as
   well as the above changes. It is concluded that more than one mechanism
   is involved in the immunosuppressive ability of PCV-II: reduction of the
   antigen presenting ability and reduction of B cells and CD4+ T cell
   function. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Thirty-two Newcastle disease virus isolates from the 2000 Italian
   epidemic were characterized by monoclonal antibody binding pattern and
   nucleotide sequencing of approximately 400 base pairs of the fusion
   gene. In addition, the pathogenicity of six of these isolates was
   assessed by means of the intracerebral pathogenicity test ( ICPI). The
   strains tested exhibited an ICPI ranging from 1.6 to 2.0. On the basis
   of the monoclonal antibody binding pattern, all isolates could be
   classified as belonging to group C1. Both monoclonal antibody and
   genomic analysis revealed a very high degree of homology, indicating a
   common source of infection. On the basis of the phylogenetic analysis,
   it appears that the Italian isolates are closely related to the recent
   isolates from the UK, Scandinavia and South East Europe, thus suggesting
   the circulation of this viral strain in Europe during the past 5 years.},

Abstract = {The study was divided into two experiments. In the first experiment, the
   efficacy of in ovo intermediate vaccine against infectious bursal
   disease virus (IBDV) was determined by challenge at 21 days of age with
   virulent IBDV in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) and commercial chickens.
   This vaccine was able to induce active immunity and to protect SPF
   chickens to challenge; protection was not complete in commercial
   chickens, as testified by bursal lesions, bursal index after challenge,
   and vaccine immunoresponse. In order to detect field and vaccinal
   viruses, immunoperoxidase staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay,
   capture, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
   were tested; the RT-PCR was more effective at detecting both kind of
   viruses.
   In the second experiment, the immunosuppressive effect of in ova
   vaccination was determined by evaluating the immunoresponse against
   Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccination effected at 10 days in both
   SPF and commercial chickens vaccinated in ovo, The in ovo vaccine causes
   a reduction of NDV immunoresponse, as testified by lowest geometric mean
   titer in group I (SPF chickens vaccinated against IBDV in ovo and
   against NDV at I I days). In commercial chickens, immunoresponse to NDV
   vaccination was not influenced by in ovo vaccination.},

Abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) production by the inducible NO synthase (iNOS or NOS2)
   represents one of the main microbicidal mechanisms of murine
   macrophages, but its role in other animal models is poorly investigated.
   Therefore, the aim of this work was to evaluate NOS2 expression in dog
   macrophages infected with Leishmania infantum. Macrophages obtained from
   peripheral blood of healthy dogs were activated with recombinant human
   interferon (rhIFN)-gamma and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and then
   infected with L. infantum promastigotes, zymodeme MON1. For the
   immunofluorescence assay fixed macrophages were incubated with
   polyclonal rabbit anti-NOS2 and then with rhodamine F(ab `)(2) goat
   anti-rabbit IgG. For immunoblotting, cell lysates were submitted to
   SDS-PAGE and blots were incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-NOS2 and
   then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG.
   Results demonstrated that L. infantum-infected cells, after stimulation
   with rhIFN-gamma and LPS, displayed high levels of fluorescence for the
   NOS2 in their cytoplasm, unlike unstimulated uninfected macrophages. In
   western blotting, polyclonal anti-NOS2 reacted specifically with a
   protein band corresponding to 130 kDa. The signal produced in
   Leishmania-infected cells stimulated with rhIFN-gamma and LPS was higher
   than that produced in Leishmania-infected unstimulated cells. No band
   was detected in cellular lysates from uninfected unstimulated cells.
   These results indicate that dog macrophages can express NOS2, and
   suggest a role for IFN-gamma and LPS in NOS2 induction also in this
   animal model. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   and 3' untranslated regions (UTR) were analyzed to identify
   transcription regulatory sequences and compared with those from the PRND
   and PRNP sequences published for other species. Three polymorphisms
   (R50H, N110H, and R132Q) were revealed in the cattle coding region; two
   synonymous substitutions (I12I, A26A) were found in sheep. None of the
   polymorphisms was significantly associated with either Bovine

Abstract = {Pasteurised and ultra high temperature (UHT)-treated milk were tested
   over the period November 1997-February 1998 in order to evaluate the
   applicability of an hypodermosis ELISA test on commercial milk samples.
   Milk samples from six dairy companies were analysed and the development
   of anti-Hypoderma antibodies recorded for the period from September 1998
   to June 1999. For one dairy (no. 3) bulk milk samples were also obtained
   from the tankers, transporting milk away from the farms, and analysed;
   the results were compared to the parasitological status of the cows
   whose milk had been collected on the farms.
   Out of 32 pasteurised samples tested, 23 were positive, exceeding the
   cut-off (22\%), while 9 samples were negative. UHT milk was always
   negative. The antibody levels in milk samples from four of the six
   companies were highest during January and decreased gradually during
   February to May 1999. The bulk milk samples also had high antibody
   levels and 47.2\% of milk producing cows had lesions of hypodermosis.
   It was concluded that testing commercial milk for antibodies is an
   efficient way of detecting the presence of hypodermosis in cattle,
   especially in those countries for which no data on this disease are
   available. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Mycoplasma agalactiae, the causative agent of contagious agalactia in
   small ruminants, produces a protein, named P80, that is detectable in
   all wild-type isolates examined to date and that appears expressed
   during the early phase of infection. We describe here the
   identification, cloning and expression of the gene encoding P80
   (ma-mp81). The deduced amino acid sequence is consistent with a
   hydrophobic and basic protein that possesses a lipoprotein signal
   peptide. Sequence analysis of gene ma-mp81 suggests that P80 is a
   membrane lipoprotein that shows significant homology with other putative
   lipoproteins of M. pneumoniae. An internal 1-kb fragment of ma-mp81 was
   expressed in Escherichia coli as a 6XHis-tagged protein. The purified
   recombinant protein greatly reacted with polyclonal anti-P80 sera raised
   in lamb. (C) 2001 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

Abstract = {A total of 96 piglets were weaned at 19 and 13 days in Esp. 1 and 2,
   respectively, and allotted to one of four diets: three with different
   spray dried plasmas (SPs) and one with hydrolysed casein (IIC). SPs were
   from pigs (SPP), mixed origin (SMP), and mixed origin with standardized
   level of immunoglobulins (SMPIG). All the diets contained 1.7\% total
   lysine, 25\% of the test protein source, 45\% com starch. 15\% lactose,
   2\% sucrose, 7\% soybean oil. At d 4 and d 2 in Esp. I and 2.
   respectively. piglets were perorally challenged with 10(10) CFU E. coli
   K88. Growth performance. immunity, and health condition were measured
   for 15 days and 14 days in Exp. 1 and 2. respectively. To investigate
   apparent ileal digestibility and nutrient deposition, all piglets were
   sacrificed at d 14 in Exp. 2. In Exp. 1.3 piglets died in HC diet and 1
   in SPP diet. HC dirt showed higher mortality (p <0.01) than other diets.
   In Exp. 2, no clinical sign of infection was detected, no difference for
   the content of E coli K88 was found in feces at 4 and 6 days after the
   infection, and no E coli K88 was found in the jejunum at the end of
   experiment. In both experiments, feed intake was lower for IIC diet and
   ADG was 96, 106, 122 and 155 for HC, SPP SMP and SMPIG diet,
   respectively (HC vs others, p <0.05: SMPIG vs other SI: p <0.01). Ileal
   apparent digestibility of nitrogen in sacrificed piglets was higher for
   HC diet (p <0.05). After the challenge, K88-specific IgA titers in
   saliva (Exp. 1) and in plasma (Exp. 2) were reduced in SMP and SMPIG.
   The piglets positive to the adhesion of the used 6 coli strain to the
   intestinal brush borders had a significantly reduced growth (p <0.01)
   and a higher K88-specific IgA titer in plasma, in comparison with
   negative ones. This effect was independent of the diet. The data show
   the relevance of spray dried plasma sources and particularly of SP with
   standardized level of immunoglobulins for the feeding of early-weaned
   pigs at the risk of infection by enterotoxigenic bacteria.},

   induce murine peritoneal cells to express different proinflammatory

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {The recognition of a pathogen or a vaccine antigen formulation by cells
   in the innate immune system leads to production of proinflammatory
   cytokines, which will determine the ensuing acquired immune response
   quantitatively and qualitatively. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha,
   interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 are the first set of cytokines produced upon
   such an encounter, which have roles both in protective immunity and
   immunopathogenesis evident with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). RSV
   antigens in different physical adjuvant-vaccine formulations were
   analysed for their capacity to provoke cultured murine peritoneal cells
   to produce these three proinflammatory cytokines. RSV immunostimulating
   complex (ISCOM), i.e. both antigen and adjuvant are incorporated in the
   same particle, induced high levels of 11-1 alpha being of the same
   magnitude or higher than those of live. RSV and lipopolysaccharide
   (LPS). Live virus and LPS induced higher levels of IL-6 and TNF-a than
   ISCOM and so did non-adjuvanted UV-inactivated RSV but only at high
   doses. ISCOM-Matrix, i.e. ISCOM without antigens, admixed as a separate
   entity to inactivated RSV, downregulated or blocked the cytokine
   response to the inactivated RSV in contrast to ISCOM. Kinetic studies
   showed that ISCOM induced cytokine production first detected at hours 1,
   2, 4 for TNF-alpha, 11-6 and IL-1 alpha respectively, which was earlier
   than for the other antigen formulations containing corresponding doses
   of antigen and/or Quillaja adjuvant. Peak values for production of
   TNF-alpha and IL-6 were at 8 h and for 11-1 alpha at 72 h following
   stimulation with ISCOM. The delayed appearance of IL-1 alpha may reflect
   the cell-bound nature of this cytokine. (C) 2001 Federation of European

Abstract = {Susceptibility patterns to 27 antimicrobial agents and beta -lactamase
   production were investigated in potentially pathogenic halophilic
   vibrios from seafood. The effect of salinity on the response to the
   drugs in vitro was also studied. All isolates were uniformly sensitive

   were highly sensitive to oxolinic acid, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole,
   doxycycline, flumequine, cefotaxime, nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin.
   Some strains of V. harveyi, V. alginolyticus and V. parahaemolyticus
   apparently had mechanisms of resistance to several beta -lactam
   antibiotics other than by the production of beta -lactamases. Sixty-nine
   strains produced penicillinase but a low correlation between beta
   -lactamase activity and resistance to beta -lactam antibiotics was
   noted. The salt concentration affected the in vitro susceptibility of
   halophilic vibrios and the effect of salinity depended on both the
   individual strains and the antimicrobial tested. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {Circovirus-like, spherical particles measuring 16 to 18 nm in diameter
   were detected in organ homogenates from adult canaries that had died
   after a short illness characterized by dullness, anorexia, lethargy and
   feather disorder. A polymerase chain reaction method, based on
   degenerate primers specific to conserved amino acid sequences in the
   circovirus replication-associated protein, was used to amplify DNA
   specific to a novel circovirus, tentatively named canary circovirus
   (CCV). Sequence analysis of a 510 nucleotide genomic fragment indicated
   that CCV exhibited 67.4, 64.9, 53.7 and 53.9\% nucleotide identities and
   70.0, 61.8, 40.4 and 40.1\% amino acid identities with columbid (pigeon)
   circovirus (CoCV), beak and feather disease virus (BFDV), porcine
   circovirus type 1 and porcine circovirus type 2, respectively. CCV
   therefore represents a new avian virus of the genus Circovirus of the
   family Circoviridae, and is more closely related to CoCV than BFDV. The
   availability of nucleotide sequence data will facilitate the development
   of DNA-detecting diagnostics with which the prevalence of CCV infections
   can be assessed.},

   chemitherapic treatment of beehives and other widely used agricultural
   insecticides, were extracted using a polydimethylsiloxane fiber of 100

   detection limits of the method are discussed. Considering the rapidity
   and simplicity of this technique and, on the other hand, the
   difficulties arising from its application to a very complex matrix, SPME
   can certainly be considered a useful tool for the rapid screening of

Abstract = {In Italy, an attenuated Bacillus anthracis strain, named `Carbosap', is
   used for immunization against ovine and bovine anthrax. Analysis on
   `Carbosap', Sterne vaccine strain F34 and Pasteur vaccine strain SS104,
   were performed using primers specific for the sequences, encoding the
   toxic factors, located on plasmids pXO1 and pXO2 and primers specific
   for the chromosome. The results obtained from polymerase chain reaction
   (PCR) assay revealed the presence of both plasmids pXO1 and pXO2 in
   `Carbosap' strain. This study showed that the `Carbosap' vaccine strain
   has a different plasmid pattern in comparison to Pasteur vaccine strain
   SS104 and Sterne vaccine strain F34. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {The VP2 genes of Italian canine parvovirus (CPV) type 2 strains isolated
   from dogs and wolves were sequenced and a three-dimensional model of the
   VP2 capsid protein was constructed. Two mutations were detected in the
   VP2 sequences of the Italian strains: one at residue 297 and one at
   residue 265. Variant 297 is the predominant CPV isolate in Europe,
   whereas variant 265 has never been detected before. The mutation at
   residue 265 causes a disruption in a G strand of the beta -barrel in the
   VP2 protein. Data on strains isolated from wolves demonstrated that the
   same strain of CPV can circulate among domestic and wild canids;
   therefore, this result leads us to exclude the possibility that a
   separate parvovirus pool exists in wild populations.},

   glial nodules, neutrophils, and occasional neuronophagia. Perivascular
   hemorrhages, also noted macroscopically in two animals, were observed in
   50\% of the horses. In the four American horses, lesions extended from
   the basal nuclei through the brain stem and to the sacral spinal cord
   and were more severe than the lesions observed in the six Italian
   horses, which had moderate to severe lesions mainly in the thoracolumbar
   spinal cord and mild rhombencephalic lesions. WNV antigen was scant and
   was identified within the cytoplasm of a few neurons, fibers, glial
   cells, and macrophages. WNV infection in horses is characterized by
   lesions with little associated antigen when compared with WNV infection
   in birds and some fatal human infections and with other important viral

Abstract = {Aims: The metabolic characterization and pathogenicity of vibrios
   isolated from seafood were studied.
   Methods and Results: Strains of halophilic vibrios, grown in the
   presence of 0.5\% glucose, induced high medium acidification and were
   non-culturable after 24 h, while moderately acidifying strains were
   culturable, produced cytotoxins, and remained lethal when inoculated
   intraperitoneally in mice. Highly acidifying strains failed to elicit
   pathogenicity in vivo and in vitro.
   Conclusions: The high acidification of the medium and the self-killing
   activity of NCVs might be considered a significant phenotypic marker of
   virulence and/or cytotoxicity.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: We suggest the medium
   acidification test as possible screening method for pathogenic NCVs in
   food microbiology.},

Abstract = {Human visceral leishmaniosis is endemic in Southern Italy. where the dog
   is the main reservoir of viscerotropic strains of Leishmania infantum.
   The release of nitric oxide (NO) by interferon (IFN)-gamma -activated
   macrophages is an important leishmanicidal mechanism in several animal
   species. In this work NO production, phagocytosis and killing capacity
   of monocyte-derived dog macrophages were evaluated in vitro before and
   after administration of a vaccine composed of killed Leishmania infantum
   promastigotes. Moreover, IFN-gamma content was measured in concanavalin
   A-activated dog peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) supernatants
   employed for macrophage stimulation. Phagocytosis, killing capacity and
   NO production by canine macrophages increased significantly 1 month
   after vaccine administration, and the increase also persisted 5 months
   later. In addition, the amount of IFN-gamma in PBMC supernatants was
   significantly higher after vaccination. Overall, our results suggest the
   usefulness of evaluating the in vivo protective role of this
   promastigote preparation in dogs. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {Experimental results of a new solid phase fluorescence immunoassay
   (SPFIA) for beta-lactam antibiotics (Parallux) have been reported by the
   Authors. The study has been split in two different steps. First of all,
   test detection limits and cross-reaction were evaluated for the
   following drugs: ampicillin, amoxicillin, cloxacillin, nafcillin,
   ceftiofur and cephapirin. High specificity has been showed by the test
   in order to distinguish among the different beta-lactam drugs, while
   some problems were given by the detection limits. Some drugs like
   cloxacillin and ceftiofur were detected also below the maximum residue
   level (MRL) fixed by EU regulations, while ampicillin and cephapirin
   residues were found at concentrations that were almost the double of
   their MRLs.
   SPFIA sensitivity has been evaluated versus the official method (EU
   decision 91/180) in the second part of the study. At this purpose 46
   bulk tank milk samples, suspected to be contamined by beta-lactam
   residues, were tested with SPFIA and reference method. SPFIA sensitivity
   obtained by the comparison was 91\%.},

Abstract = {We have studied the effects of treatment with recombinant human (rh)IL-6
   on clinical, histological and immunological parameters of protracted
   relapsing (PR) experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in DA rats.
   rhIL-6 (50 mug/rat subcutaneously/day) was given under three different
   regimens, as early prophylaxis, from 1 day prior to 14 days after
   immunization, in late prophylaxis, from day +7 until day 21
   post-immunization (p.i.) and therapeutically to rats with clinical signs
   of EAE from day 14 to day 28 p.i. Although rhIL-6 failed to modulate the
   course of PR-EAE when administered as the early prophylactic regimen, it
   exerted clear-cut favourable effects on the course of the disease if was
   administered either as later prophylactic or as therapeutic treatment.
   Under these conditions, rhIL-6 accelerated recovery from EAE attacks and
   reduced/milded subsequent EAE episodes as compared to either PBS- or
   heat-inactivated rhIL-6-treated control rats. In agreement with this
   clinical effect, relative to PBS-treated rats, the animals injected with
   rhIL-6 exhibited lower numbers of MHC class II+ and CD4(+) cells in
   their spinal cords. rhIL-6-treatment also profoundly modulated the
   endogenous cytokine network, the treated rats displaying increased
   numbers of spleen cells expressing mRNA transcripts of the
   anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-beta along with simultaneously
   reduced numbers of mRNAs for TNF-alpha. In addition, upon ex vivo
   exposure to either myelin basic protein peptide 63-88 (MBP63-88) or to
   phytoaemagglutinin A, the numbers of IFN-gamma secreting splenocytes was
   also significantly reduced (ELISPOT analysis) in rhIL-6-treated rats as
   compared to PBS-treated controls. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {In the present work the biological behaviour of T, spiralis and T.
   pseudospiralis in ostriches is reported. Oral infections were performed
   in eight ostriches with two infective doses (10,000 and 80,000 larvae)
   for each species of Trichinella. On day 0, 30 and 60 p.i. blood samples
   were collected to assay the serum changes concerning specific muscle
   enzyme activities and total proteins. The immunological study, to
   determine specific IgG in sera, was conducted employing a monoclonal
   blocking ELISA. From the carcasses of sacrificed animals, samples of
   various muscle tissues were examined by the digestion method and by
   standard histopathologic procedures. The study showed a low
   susceptibility of the ostriches to T. pseudospiralis; preferential sites
   of larval distribution were muscle tissues of the legs. T. spiralis
   could be found in muscle tissues only when a high number of larvae were
   inoculated. Immunological reactivity was found only in animals infected
   with higher doses of T, pseudospiralis.},

   horse meat in the last years. In this context, the present study has
   been undertaken to verify, through an experimental infection, the
   susceptibility, together with other biological parameters, of
   follow-deer to Trichinella infection. The four animals, 8-9 months of
   age and 18-25 Kg body weight, were orally infected with low doses of
   Trichinella britovi and T. pseudospiralis (2,000 larvae/animal). After
   day 30 p.i., the animals were necropsied and, using artificial digestion
   methods, larval burden of Trichinella in muscle tissues was determined.
   Histopathological, serological (IgG monoclonal blocking ELISA) and
   biochemical data were assessed during the experiment. The results showed
   the susceptibility of follow-deer to T. britovi and T. pseudospiralis
   infection; under the same inoculum size, the number of larvae/g was
   higher in group infected with T. britovi. The animals showed a higher
   immunological response to T. pseudospiralis infection. The results are

Abstract = {Fourteen of 22 (68\%) Mycobacterium bovis strains isolated from cattle
   in Sardinia were found to be resistant to rifampin and isoniazid,
   Analysis of the rpoB and the katG, oxyR-ahpC, and inhA gene regions of
   these strains was performed in order to investigate the molecular basis
   of rifampin and isoniazid resistance, respectively. The most frequent
   mutation, encountered in 6 of 10 strains (60\%), was in the rpoB gene;
   it occurred, at codon position 521 and resulted in leucine changed to
   proline, This suggests that codon 521 may be important for the
   development of rifampin resistance in M, bovis. Resistance to isoniazid
   is associated in Mycobacterium tuberculosis with a variety of mutations
   affecting one or more genes. Our results confirm the difficulty of
   interpreting the sequence variations observed in clinical strains of M,
   bovis. M. bovis strains isolated from the same geographic area showed
   similar mutations within the genes responsible for rifampin and
   isoniazid resistance. Our results represent the first study to elucidate
   the molecular genetic basis of drug resistance in M. bovis isolated from
   cattle.},

Abstract = {A field survey was performed in a heifer raising operation in Northern
   Italy to study the introduction, maintenance and dissemination of
   Escherichia toll O157 in the herd and to identify possible control
   measures at the farm level. Rectal swabs from two different groups of
   animals (surveys 1 and 2) were tested for E. coli O157 by an
   immunomagnetic separation technique. In survey 1, a group of female
   calves (341 animals initially) introduced from 30 dairy herds during
   April 1996 to March 1997 were tested for E. coli O157 on arrival from
   the original herd when housed in individual hutches. 2-3 days after
   completion of weaning (which was associated with grouping) and 2 months
   after weaning. No statistically significant difference between excretion
   rates (3.8\%, 4.2\%, 4.4\%, respectively) was found. Calves from which
   E. coli O157 was isolated on arrival came from 6 of the 30 dairy herds.
   Strains isolated during survey 1 belonged to seven different pulsed
   field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles. In survey 2, a group of young
   animals aged. at the beginning of the study. between 2 1/2 and 7 1/2
   months (median = 124 days) was rested monthly for E. coli O157 for 11-15
   months from May 1996 to July 1997. The group included 92 animals for 11
   months and then gradually decreased to 59 animals. overall, E. coli
   O157, belonging to six different PFGE profiles. were isolated from 138
   (10.7\%) of 1293 rectal swabs. Monthly excretion rates ranged from 2.7\%
   to 23.7\%. with summer peaks in both years. Fifty-nine (64.1\%) of the
   92 heifers were positive at least once: of these 59 animals, 21,
   (37.3\%) were positive on only one occasion, 23 (39\%) were positive on
   two occasions and 14 (23.7\%) were positive on three or mon occasions.
   From two heifers positive on 9 out of the 15 sampling visits, strains
   with the same PFGE profile were isolated, respectively, on seven and
   eight occasions while strains with only one band difference were
   isolated on the remaining occasions. E. coli O157 was also isolated from
   6 of 16 samples of bedding, two of two samples of slurry and one of five
   samples from water troughs collected during survey. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {Corticosteroids can be illegally administered to cattle as growth
   promoting agents to improve meat production. We developed a liquid
   chromatography-atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometry-mass
   spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) method able to identify and quantify
   flumethasone, one of the most potent fluorinated synthetic
   corticosteroid, in serum and urine from treated calves. The analyte was
   purified from urine (conjugated and free, following enzymatic
   hydrolysis) and from serum by C-18 solid-phase and liquid-liquid
   extractions, then analyzed by LC-MS-MS monitoring the product ions of an
   abundant precursor (SRM in negative ionization mode). Results on
   flumethasone residues in biological fluids in three calves treated at
   different levels are presented. This method allowed the detection of
   flumethasone in bovine urine and serum at the 30-pg/ml level. (C) 2001

Abstract = {The colonization of intestinal and systemic tissues by Salmonella
   enterica sero,tars with different host specificities was determined 7
   days after inoculation of 1 to 2-month-old lambs. Following oral
   inoculation, S, enterica serovars. Abortusovis, Dublin, and Gallinarum
   were recovered in comparable numbers from the intestinal mucosa, but
   serovar Gallinarum was recovered in lower numbers than the other
   serovars from systemic sites. The pattern of bacterial recovery from
   systemic sites following intravenous inoculation was similar, The
   magnitude of intestinal invasion was evaluated in bovine ligated ileal
   loops in vivo. Serovars Dublin and Gallinarum and the broad-host-range
   Salmonella serovar Typhimurium were recovered in comparable numbers from
   ileal mucosa 3 h after loop inoculation, whereas the recovery of serovar
   Abortusovis was approximately 10-fold lower. Microscopic analysis of
   intestinal mucosae infected with serovars Typhimurium and Dublin showed
   dramatic morphological changes and infiltration of inflammatory cells,
   whereas mucosae infected with serovars Abortusovis and Gallinarum were
   indistinguishable from uninfected mucosae, Together these data suggest
   that Salmonella serovar specificity in sheep correlates with bacterial
   persistence at systemic sites, Intestinal invasion and avoidance of the
   host's intestinal inflammatory response may contribute to but do not
   determine the specificity of serovar Abortosovis for sheep. Intestinal
   invasion by serovar Abortusovis was significantly reduced after mutation
   of invH but was not reduced following airing of the virulence plasmid,
   suggesting that the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 influences but the
   virulence plasmid genes do not influence the ability of serovar
   Abortusovis to invade the intestinal mucosa in sheep.},

Abstract = {An accidental infection from a vaccine was suggested as the explanation
   for the sudden increase in outbreaks of scrapie in Italy in 1997 and
   1998. This paper describes a recent outbreak of scrapie in sheep and
   goats which were exposed to the same vaccine. Ho ewes or goats had been
   imported into the herd since 1992, but a vaccine against Mycoplasma
   agalactiae had been administered twice, in 1995 and 1997. High rates of
   crude mortality and scrapie incidence were experienced by both species,
   all birth cohorts were involved and a large proportion of aged animals
   was affected. A pattern of brain lesions was observed, with slight
   differences between the sheep and goats, which was very similar to the
   pattern observed in animals previously exposed to the same vaccine but
   clearly different from that observed in the brains of sheep with scrapie
   in a flock not exposed to the vaccine. Regardless of their exposure
   status, genotype analysis of the sheep showed the presence of
   polymorphism only at codon 171. The patterns of both incidence and brain
   lesions provide evidence that the epidemic of scrapie was due to the use
   of the vaccine.},

   were submitted to the laboratory for bacteriological, virological,
   histological and immunohistochemical investigations. Routine
   bacteriological tests resulted negative, while a HPAI virus of the H7N1
   subtype was isolated from the geese. Pancreatic damage was observed in
   both the geese and the ducks, and the pancreas was also positive by
   immunohistochemistry for avian influenza in the geese. Histopathological
   lesions were observed in the central nervous system of both species, and
   this result was supported by positive immunohistochemical findings for
   the presence of the virus.},

Abstract = {in 1999 an accidental contamination of feed occurred in Belgium. This

   analysed. The Quantitation of PCB was made from the sum of 7 congeners
   obtained by gas chromatography with an electron capture detector.
   Confirmatory analysis was performed by gas chromatography/mass
   spectrometry. The PCBs in the majority of samples were close to the
   method limit of detection and only a few samples had PCB concentrations
   > the limit of quantitation. In those tissues the average concentration
   of PCBs was 0.035 mg/kg. The legal limit of 0.200 mg PCB/kg established
   by the European Union was exceeded by only 1 sample, a smoked ham from
   Belgium. This sample showed the presence of all selected congeners. We
   report the profile of the PCB congeners in this sample.},

Abstract = {Thirty-six representative velogenic strains of Newcastle disease virus
   isolated in Italy since 1960 were characterized by restriction site and
   partial sequence analyses of the fusion protein gene. Viruses belonging
   to the six known genotypes of Lomniczi et al. were found. Genotype IV,
   which was most probably the main epizootic group in Europe before the
   war, was responsible for outbreaks in the 1960s and persisted until the
   late 1980s in Italy. An epizootic peak in 1972 to 1974 coincided with
   the appearance of genotype V viruses that were present for more than a
   decade. Outbreaks in 1992 were caused by genotype VIIa viruses and were
   part of a contemporaneous epizootic of Far East origin that affected
   Western European countries. The Newcastle disease epizootic that
   commenced in Italy in May 2000 was due to a genotype VIIb virus that is
   indistinguishable from those causing sporadic outbreaks in Great Britain
   and Northern Europe in the late 1990s. Isolated cases yielded a variant
   of genotype VI (reference epizootic: Middle East in the late 1960s) and
   a group VIII virus (enzootic in South Africa).},

   composed of an (AC) repeat, that showed a hism of three alleles: 205,
   207 and 229 base pairs. Association of marker polymorphism to beef
   conformation measures was tested with a linear mixed model which
   included the fixed effect of the marker genotype separated according to
   the origin of the allele: whether inherited from Piemontese or from
   Chianina and random additive genetic effect of the animals. Carriers of
   allele 205, when inherited from Chainina, were larger than carriers of
   207 and showed a globally better body structure. No significant
   association was found in the animals that had inherited the alleles from
   Piemontese. It would be interesting to verify, in the chromosome

   Italy. A nonpathogenic H5N9 influenza virus was also isolated during the
   outbreaks as a result of virological and epidemiological surveillance to
   control the spread of avian influenza to neighbouring regions. Antigenic
   analysis showed that the Italian H5N2 isolates were antigenically
   similar to, although distinguishable from, A/HK/156/97, a human
   influenza H5N1 virus isolated ire Hong Kong in 1997, Phylogenetic
   analysis of the haemagglutinin (HA) genes showed that the highly
   pathogenic Italian viruses clustered with the Hong Kong strains, whereas
   the nonpathogenic H5N9 virus, despite its epidemiological association
   with the highly pathogenic Italian isolates, was most closely related to
   the highly pathogenic A/Turkey/England/91 (H5N1) strain. Like the HA
   phylogenetic tree, the nonstructural (NS) phylogenetic tree showed that
   the H5N2 Italian virus genes are clearly separate from those of the H5N9
   strain. In contrast, results of the phylogenetic analysis of
   nucleoprotein (NF) genes indicated a closer genetic relationship between
   the two Italian virus groups, a finding suggesting a common progenitor.
   Comparison of the HA, MS and NP genes of the Italian H5 strains with
   those of the H5N1 viruses simultaneously circulating in Hong Kong
   revealed that the two groups of viruses do not share a recent common
   ancestor. No virological and: serological evidence of bird-to-human
   transmission of the Italian H5N2 influenza viruses was found.},

Abstract = {A HPLC method for the determination of fumonisin in milk was modified.
   In comparison with the original method, semiautomatic equipment have
   been used in the purification step by means of immunoaffinity columns,
   and in the derivatization and LC injection steps. The use of these
   equipments provided good repeatability, short process time, and in
   particular the analysis of several samples in the same time could be
   carried out.
   The accuracy of the modified method resulted to be acceptable within the
   considered concentration range.
   The detector response resulted to be linear in the range 0.001-0.010
   mug. The detection limit was 0.010 mug mL(-1). The recovery of fumonisin
   from milk samples at fortification levels of 0.025, 0.05 and 0.1 mug
   mL(-1) resulted to be 83.1, 79.7 and 73.5\% respectively.},

Abstract = {Aims. To determine whether individuals from two rural communities with
   heavy exposure to the Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV) developed
   antibodies to this virus.
   Methods. Sera were assayed using competition ELISA (cELISA) and solid
   phase ELISA (spELISA). Exposure estimates were based on answers to an
   interviewer administered questionnaire.
   Results. Of the 104 participants, 79 were considered to have experienced
   high or medium exposure, many of whom described specific exposures.
   There were 58 people who reported contact with RHDV infected bait, organ
   homogenate mixtures or rabbit body fluids. A one-way analysis of
   variance (Kruskal Wallis) found that human cELISA results were
   differently distributed from both strongly RHDV positive rabbits (chi
   (2)(1) = 27.37, p<0.001) and weakly RHDV positive rabbits (<chi>(2)(1) =
   27.35, p<0.001). The distribution of assay results in each exposure
   group did not differ in either cELISA (<chi>(2)(2) = 2.49, p = 0.29) or
   spELISA (chi (2)(2) = 1.70, p = 0.43). Relatively fewer results were
   categorised as reactive (two `barely' positive and two doubtful) than in
   a previous survey of 493 unexposed people. None of the five positive
   results categorised by the less specific spELISA occurred in people
   described as `barely' positive or doubtful by cELISA.
   Conclusions. No serological evidence of infection with RHDV was found in
   a cohort including many heavily exposed individuals.},

   cross-react with 63 mycoplasma strains from six species affecting
   turkeys other than M. meleagridis. The five Mabs used to analyse the

   not expressed in all strains. Moreover, other epitopes were located on
   proteins which differed according to number or molecular mass from
   strain to strain. The five Mabs therefore. recognised variable surface
   proteins, among which two were amphiphilic membrane proteins.
   Three of the selected Mabs recognised 29 or 30 of the 30 tasted strains.

Abstract = {Following the first official report of a clinically severe outbreak of
   bovine viral diarrhoea disease occurring in a farm in northern Italy,
   which had originated from the use of a live vaccine contaminated with a
   strain of BVD genotype II virus, a retrospective study on the prevalence
   of BVDV genotypes in Italy became highly relevant. For this purpose, the
   genotype of 78 BVDV-positive specimens, obtained in 1998-1999 from dairy
   cattle in an area near to where the outbreak occurred, was characterized
   by PCR technology. Two sets of primers, spanning the 5' UTR of BVDV
   genome, were used sequentially in a first round of RT-PCR, performed on
   viral RNA extracted directly from 15 clinical samples and 63
   BVDV-infected cell-culture fluids; a second PCR assay followed to
   selectively amplify only BVDV genotype II. All the viruses under study
   were characterized as BVDV genotype I. As well as contributing to a
   better understanding of the prevalence of BVDV genotypes in the field,
   the results of the present study illustrate the possibility that novel
   BVDV strains can emerge in susceptible animals through the use of
   contaminated immunobiological products for bovine use.},

Abstract = {Between 1990 and 1993, 61 outbreaks of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia
   (CBPP) were reported in Lombardy, Northern Italy. In this study, gross
   pathological examination was carried out on 3129 slaughtered cattle, 716
   of which (22.9\%) showed typical CBPP Pulmonary lesions. Single or
   multiple renal infarets at different stages of development were observed
   in 88 (12.2\%) of these 716 cattle. The kidneys of 77 cattle whose lungs
   showed typical CBPP lesions and were bacteriologically and
   immunohistochemically mic positive for the small colony type of
   Mycoplasma mycoides subspecies mycoides (M. m. mycoides SC) were
   selected and submitted to histological, immunohistochemical and
   bacteriological examination. Histologically, in chronic CBPP cases,
   infarets were characterized by fibrosis, calcification of cortical
   tubules and tubular atrophy, accompanied by the presence of interstitial
   inflammatory infiltrates composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells and
   histiocytes. M.m mycoides SC antigen was detected immunohistochemically
   in 65 (84.4\%) of the 77 kidneys examined. The antigen was detected in
   the lumen of blood vessels and in glomerular cells. Immunolabelled
   interstitial cells and tubular epithelial cells were seen in chronic
   cases only. M. ni. mycoides SC was isolated from the kidneys of 12
   animals(15.6\%) and more frequently in cases with renal infarcts. This
   study confirms previous observations that demonstrated a renal
   involvement ill cases of CBPP. Moreover, the immunohistochemical results
   indicated that M. m. mycoides SC antigen was frequently detectable in
   different renal structures and cells in spontaneous cases of CBPP. (C)

   of the HA for two separate lineages, and at position 123 for all HPAI
   and some low pathogenicity viruses. Other viruses had no additional
   glycosylation sites. All viruses examined from the Italian outbreaks had
   a 22 amino acid deletion in the NA stalk that is not present in the N1
   genes of the wild bird viruses examined. We conclude that the Italian
   HPAI viruses arose from low pathogenicity strains, and that a deletion
   in the NA stalk followed by the acquisition of additional glycosylation
   near the receptor binding site of HA1 may be an adaptation of H7 viruses
   to a new host species i.e. domestic poultry.},

   relationship either with the reference method and with the Bactoscan
   8000, and the effect of the number of somatic cells on the bacterial
   counts, described in the first part, results of other tests are
   presented. In particular tests for the following parameters were carried
   out: stability of the instrument using the standard BCS supplied by the
   manufacturer and another lyophilised standard commercially available
   (SAITL Technologies, NZ); deterioration with time of the Standard BCS
   after its reconstitution; repeatability: it was more than satisfactory,
   with a final mean value of RD95\% = 22.8 \%-.; carry-over: mean result
   0.15\%. The only drawback observed during the course of this test,
   relative to the wash system in the incubation unit, was resolved by the
   manufacturer with the required modifications; linearity: optimum results
   with bacterial counts up to 10,400 impulses/mul, and remained acceptable
   for counts upto 70,000 impulses/mul, therefore definitely superior to
   results normally obtained with bulk-tank milk samples. When possible,
   the tests were conducted in a way that the results could be directly
   compared with those of previous studies.},

Abstract = {We have amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction

   the coat protein gene of fish nodaviruses infecting European sea bass,
   Dicentrarchus labrax (n = 24), and shi drum, Umbrina cirrosa (n = 2), in
   the Mediterranean basin.
   Nine new isolates were identified and their sequences were combined with
   sequences in the literature to produce three different data sets. The
   first set, based on amino acid sequences, was used to verify the
   monophyly of fish nodaviruses. The second and third data sets, based on
   nucleic acids, were used to resolve the phylogenetic relationships
   between closely related fish nodaviruses. Phylogenetic analyses were
   performed according to the maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining
   methods. Our results support the monophyly of fish nodaviruses.
   Moreover, they confirm the subdivision of fish nodaviruses into four
   main clusters, in agreement with the previously suggested phylogeny of
   the genus Piscinodavirus, that was based on a smaller number of
   sequences and an alternative phylogenetic approach {[}14]. All the
   Mediterranean isolates were clustered in the group of the red-spotted
   grouper nervous necrosis virus and appear to have a restricted
   geographic distribution, except for one sequence-type (10 samples) that
   is widespread throughout the basin.},

Abstract = {Avermectins and Milbemycin belong to a parasiticidal family of drugs
   highly efficacious against external and internal parasites. his family
   consists of some molecules Ivermectin, Doramectin, Abamectin and
   Moxidectin - that can be used only in meat-producing animals and of
   Eprinomectin that is also available for the treatment of lactating dairy
   animals. A multiresidual analytical procedure was needed in order to
   analyze by only one method all these antiparasitic drugs. In this way it
   could be possible to discover treatments with forbidden drugs for
   lactating dairy animals and, at the same time, to verify that the
   residues of approved drugs are lower than the maximun residue limit
   (MRL). A multiresidual LC method with fluorimetric detection for the
   simultaneous determination in milk of the five above-mentioned molecules
   was developed and tested. The drugs were extracted with an organic
   solvent and the extract was cleaned up, before the derivatization step,
   on an SPE C18 column. After the derivatization the extract was cleaned
   up on an SPE Silica and then analyzed using HPLC with fluorescence
   :detector. The limit of detection (LOD) was below 1 mug/kg and
   recoveries above 70\%, with CV below 13\%, were achieved for all five
   compounds in a concentration range of 5-60 mug/kg.},

   The quantitation of PCBs was made from the sum of seven toxic congeners,
   obtained by high resolution gas chromatography with an electron capture
   detector. Confirmatory analysis was performed by gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry.
   The results obtained confirm the presence of PCB residues in various

Abstract = {Background: Human brucellosis cases are still reported each year in
   Sweden despite eradication of the disease in animals. Epidemiological
   investigation has never been conducted to trace back the source of human
   infection in the country. The purpose of the study was to identify the
   source of infection for 16 human brucellosis cases that occurred in
   Sweden, during the period 2008-2012.
   Results: The isolates were identified as Brucella melitensis and MLVA-16
   genotyping revealed 14 different genotypes of East Mediterranean and
   Africa lineages. We also reported one case of laboratory -acquired
   brucellosis (LAB) that was shown to be epidemiological linked to one of
   the cases in the current study.
   Conclusions: Brucella melitensis was the only species diagnosed,
   confirming its highest zoonotic potential in the genus Brucella, and
   MLVA-16 results demonstrated that the cases of brucellosis in Sweden
   herein investigated, are imported and linked to travel in the Middle
   East and Africa. Due to its zoonotic concerns, any acute febrile illness
   linked to recent travel within those regions should be investigated for
   brucellosis and samples should be processed according to biosafety level
   3 regulations.},

Abstract = {Tropical fish importation from countries outside the European Union or
   `third countries' principally in Asia, presents a potential risk of
   introducing both human and fish pathogens. There has been concern that
   present an animal disease risk, particularly since there have been
   several major outbreaks of this may re epidemic cholera in South-East
   Asia and South America. Thus, since 1990, the Ministry of Health in
   Italy has supported research on the possible presence of Vibrio cholerae
   and Salmonella spp. in the aquarium water of fish imported from third
   countries.
   During 1997 to 1998, the authors examined 420 filtered water samples,
   using selective media. All the suspected strains isolated were
   biochemically and serologically identified. Serological identification
   was conducted using polyvalent and monovalent sera. As a result, 34
   samples (8.09\%),gave positive results for the presence of non-01 Vibrio
   cholerae, also called non-agglutinating (NAG) Vibrio. Although these
   bacteria do not cause epidemic cholera, their enterotoxins could be
   responsible for gastro-enteritis in human beings. This is considered as
   a potential risk for aquarium operators and tropical fish hobbyists, as
   well as being potentially responsible for some disease outbreaks in
   fish. In addition, 10 samples (2.38\%) showed positive results for the
   presence of Salmonella spp. (2 samples of S. Enteritidis, 2 of S.
   Typhimurium, 2 of S. Blockley, 2 of S. Newport, 1 of S. Hadar and 1 of
   S. Derby). This seems to increase the potential risk for human and
   aquatic animal health.
   This study provides on an example of certain pathogenic adverse
   consequences. There are other additional bacterial pathogens (i.e. V.
   vulnificus and Mycobacterium marinum) which could also cause severe
   disease in humans and animals. To assist in obtaining an accurate risk
   analysis for disease control measures, a two-year research project on
   bacterial and parasitic diseases of tropical fish imported from third
   countries is currently in progress, with the collaboration of the
   Italian National Health Service and tropical fish importers.
   The authors emphasise the importance of involving other research centres
   in a monitoring programme to deal with import risk analysis of aquatic
   organisms.},

Abstract = {Several PrP gene polymorphisms modulate sheep scrapie susceptibility.
   Recently, an increase of scrapie outbreaks has been reported in Italy. A
   vaccine containing sheep brain homogenate was used in most of the
   outbreaks. We investigated PrP gene polymorphisms in scrapie-affected
   and clinically healthy Sarda breed sheep from a flock exposed to the
   aforementioned vaccine, and in affected Sarda sheep from unexposed
   flocks. All affected animals were (Gln/Gln)(171) homozygous. Moreover,
   we observed no variation for Ala(136) and a new polymorphism (Lys to
   Asn) at codon 176. Our findings confirm the correlation between scrapie
   and (Gln/Gln)(171) in breeds with no variation for Ala(136).},

Abstract = {From the end of March to the beginning of December 1999, an epidemic of
   low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) affected the industrial poultry
   population of northern Italy. The virus responsible for the epidemic was
   subtyped as H7N1 with an intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) of 0.0,
   and a deduced amino acid sequence of the region coding for the cleavage
   site of the haemagglutinin molecule typical of low pathogenicity
   viruses. The circulation of the virus in a susceptible population for
   several months caused the emergence of a highly pathogenic virus with an
   IVPI of 3.0 and the presence of multiple basic amino acids in the
   deduced amino acid sequence for the cleavage site of the haemagglutinin
   molecule. Over 13 million birds were affected by the epidemic and, in
   the present paper, we report the results of the clinical, virological
   and histopathological investigations performed on affected chickens and
   turkeys. Clinical, gross and microscopic lesions caused by LPAI were
   more severe in turkeys than in chickens, while highly pathogenicity
   avian influenza (HPAI) caused similar mortality rates in both species.
   Current European legislation considers LPAI and HPAI as two completely
   distinct diseases, not requiring any compulsory eradication policy for
   LPAI but enforcing eradication for HPAI. In the Italian 1999 to 2000
   epidemic, LPAI mutated to HPAI in a densely populated area, causing
   great economic losses. A reconsideration of the current European Union
   legislation on avian influenza, including LPAI of the H5 and H7
   subtypes, could possibly be an aid to avoiding devastating epidemics for
   the poultry industry.},

   inoculation)-intramuscular (second inoculation) routes; group 2 was
   treated by the intranasal (first inoculation)-intramuscular (second
   inoculation) routes. The third group was left untreated as the control.
   All of the pigs were challenged intranasally with a virulent PRV strain
   and they were subsequently injected with dexamethasone. Two pigs in each
   group were necropsied on days 5 and 15 after dexamethasone inoculation.
   The challenge exposure resulted in mild clinical signs, increase in
   growth and a shorter period of virus shedding in vaccinated pigs,
   whereas the control group showed severe signs of Aujeszky's disease. No
   difference in the titre of the virulent virus which was excreted by pigs
   of all three groups, was observed and all animals seroconverted. Both
   the mutant strain and the wild-type virus established a latent infection
   although only the latter was reactivated and shed. Slight lesions were
   observed in target tissues of the vaccinated animals and no significant
   differences were detected between the two inoculation schedules.},

Abstract = {In October 1990, an outbreak of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP)
   was reported in Italy after an absence of approximately one century.
   Since October 1990, ninety-four outbreaks have occurred in Italy, of
   which forty-seven were concentrated in th ree areas of north ern Italy
   (Lombardy region). The disease was eradicated in September 1993.
   The data used for the analysis were obtained from the epidemiological
   investigations undertaken during the outbreaks of 1990-1993. The unit of
   interest for the analysis is the farm. Spatial segregation of infected
   and uninfected farms within the study area was determined through the
   Pielou index of segregation. Data from herds within the same set of
   outbreaks were analysed through logistic regression to identify factors
   which could be used to discriminate between infected and uninfected
   herds.
   The study indicated a clear spatial segregation between infected and
   uninfected herds. The results of the analysis do not indicate the mode
   of disease spread. However, the study demonstrated that both aerosol and
   indirect transmission of the infection could have occurred, as
   previously documented in Africa. The possibility that indirect
   transmission played a prominent role in the spread of CBPP in the region
   of Lombardy is a completely new suggestion. Further studies are required
   to understand the epidemiology of CBPP in regions with intensive farming
   and a relatively cold climate. In particular three aspects require
   consideration; firstly, animal movement among neighbouring herds could
   produce a pattern of disease similar to the one produced by indirect
   transmission (this possibility was excluded in the epidemiological
   outbreak investigations conducted by field veterinarians). Secondly the
   methods of spatial analysis used in this study have not been previously
   used in the field of veterinary epidemiology. Further validation of the
   efficacy of these methods is thus required. Thirdly, the epidemiology of
   CBPP under conditions of high animal density and a relatively cool
   climate, as encountered in Lombardy, requires further investigation.},

Abstract = {A big epidemic of classical swine fever (CSF) occurred in the European
   Community in 1997. The first case was reported at the beginning of
   January 1997 from Germany. The disease presumably spread to the
   Netherlands, and from there to Italy, Spain and eventually to Belgium.
   About 30 isolates from these outbreaks were analysed by comparison of
   the nucleotide sequence data generated from fragments of both the E2
   glycoprotein gene (190 nucleotides) and from the 5'-nontranslated region
   (5'-NTR; 150 nucleotides). By combining epidemiological data with
   genetic typing, it was found that the outbreaks were related and caused
   by a virus belonging to the genetic subgroup 2.1. As this type of virus
   had been reported infrequently in Europe and not at all since 1993, we
   postulate that it was newly introduced into the European Union (EW). (C)

Abstract = {The Salmonella spp. represent one of the main causes of food poisoning
   in the man and, among food of alimentary origin, the eggs and their
   derived products are often mentioned.
   It's however fairly difficult to isolate Salmonella spp, from these
   products, either because of the low percentage of eggs contaminated by
   the irregular excretion of Salmonella spp. from animals that are
   casual-carriers, or because of not sufficient size of samples.
   This work points out how the Salmonella spp. matter is still present and
   hard to solve. The monitoring of health-sanitary conditions of the
   production processes represents a means of repression against the
   diffusion of this microorganism among the animals and from these to the
   man.},

Abstract = {We studied the responses to hypertonicity of cultured endothelial cells
   from swine pulmonary arteries. In 0.5 osmol/kgH(2)O medium, initial cell
   shrinkage was followed by a regulatory volume increase (RVI), complete
   after 1 h, concomitant with an increase in cellular K+ content. Then the
   activity of amino acid transport System A increased, accompanied by an
   accumulation of ninhydrin-positive solutes (NPS), reaching a peak at
   similar to6 h. The subsequent decline in System A activity was
   paralleled by an induction of the betaine-GABA transporter (BGT-1),
   detected as increases of BGT-1 mRNA and of transport activity, which
   peaked at similar to 24 h. Inhibitors of transcription or translation
   prevented induction of both transport activities. The increased
   expression of BGT-1, which involved activation of ``tonicity-responsive
   enhancer,{''} was inhibited by 5 mM extracellular betaine. Cellular K+
   concentration gradually declined after the accumulation of NPS and
   during the induction of BGT-1. This very effective adaptation to
   hypertonicity suggests it has a physiological role.},

Title = {The beta-tubulin gene of Babesia and Theileria parasites is an

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {30},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1181-1185},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {A fragment of the beta -tubulin gene was polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
   amplified from genomic DNAs of Babesia bovis, Babesia bigemina, Babesia
   divergens, Babesia major, Babesia caballi, Babesia equi, Babesia
   microti, Theileria annulata and Theileria sergenti, Single amplification
   products were obtained for each of these species, but the size of the
   amplicons varied from 310 to 460 bp, Sequence analysis revealed that
   this variation is due to the presence of a single intron, which ranged
   from 20 to 170 bp. The extensive genetic variability at the beta
   -tubulin locus has been exploited to develop two types of species
   identification assays. The first assay can be used on samples containing
   mostly parasite DNA, like those prepared from infected erythrocytes.
   Following PCR amplification, the species identification is obtained
   directly from the size of the products (for Babesia species infecting
   human or horse) or using a simple PCR-restriction fragment length
   polymorphism (RFLP) protocol (for Babesia species infecting cattle). The
   second assay can be used on samples prepared from whole blood, that
   contain both parasite and host DNAs. In this case, due to the strong
   conservation of the beta -tubulin gene, co-amplification of a gene
   fragment from the host DNA was observed. A nested PCR assay was
   developed for the specific amplification of parasite DNA, using a primer
   designed to span the exon-intron boundary. Direct identification of
   Babesia species infecting human and horse is again obtained after the
   electrophoretic separation of the amplification products, while for
   Babesia and Theileria species infecting cattle, differentiation is based
   on a nested PCR-RFLP protocol. These methods may be used for the
   simultaneous identification of horses and cattle carrying multiple
   parasites by means of a single PCR or using the PCR-RFLP protocol. (C)

Abstract = {A survey for oestrosis was carried out in the slaughterhouse at Messine
   (Sicily) from May 1996 to April 1998. The heads of sheep from local
   flocks were collected each month. A total of 841 heads were examined
   according to a validated procedure. 469 (55.8\%) were infested by
   (Estrus ovis larvae. 4423 larva were harvested: 1829 first instar larvae
   or L1 (41.4\%), 1286 second instar larvae or L2 (29.1\%) and 1308 third
   instar larvae or L3 (29.6\%). The mean larval burden for infected sheep
   was 9.4 larva with an average of 3.9 L1, 2.7 L2 and 2.8 L3. No period of
   hypobiosis was recorded. The proportions of larva in each of the
   different larval stages was similar from January to September, however,
   from October to December the percentage of L1 was higher, indicating a
   period of slowed development. In order to lower the overall prevalence
   of this disease, it would be necessary to use a parasiticide effective
   against O. ovis, for all routine parasite control treatments. (C) 2000

Abstract = {We studied the ribotypes, patterns of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
   (PFGE) and interspersed repeated sequences (IRS)-PCR of 30 strains of
   Yersinia ruckeri O1 and 20 strains of Photobacterium damsela subsp.
   piscicida isolated from apparently unrelated epizootic outbreaks
   occurring on Italian fish farms between 1993 and 1999. All of the Y.
   ruckeri O1 strains had similar profiles, as demonstrated by all three
   typing methods, thus confirming the clonal structure of this species.
   The strains of P. damsela subsp. piscicida showed similar profiles when
   tested with ribotyping and PFGE; however, two slightly different
   profiles were distinguished by IRS-PCR using the primer ERIC2. The two
   profiles appeared to be related to the geographic origin of the strains,
   since each of them was specific to isolates from a certain area (i.e.
   northern or southern Italy). This result suggests that PCR
   fingerprinting may be a valuable tool in typing fish bacterial
   pathogens, which often present a great degree of genetic homogeneity.

   Microbiology 141:2131-2138, 1995). In the present study, 30 ill, bovis
   isolates from Sardinian cattle were examined for the presence of this
   500-bp fragment; I of the 30 isolates lacked the fragment. This result
   indicates that identification of M. bovis strains by amplification of
   the 500-bp sequence may lead to false-negative results.},

Abstract = {The possibility of using automated equipment for solid phase extraction
   of isoniazid from milk has been investigated. This equipment provides
   two noteworthy advantages : it shortens the time of analysis and avoids
   SPE column plugging, stabilizing flow rates. After setting the correct
   programme on software controlling the equipment, some validation
   parameters have been determined to obtain recovery and repeatability
   data. The mean recovery for spiked samples resulted in the range 75-95
   \%, the standard error ranged from 5\% to 20\% while the RSD varied from
   2 to 22 \%. Therefore the method can be considered reliable and fast.},

Abstract = {During 1999, northern Italy has been affected by an epidemic of low
   pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) caused by a virus of the H7N1
   subtype. Due to the characteristics of the poultry industry in the area
   and to the absence of specific legislative tools to eradicate infection,
   the virus continued to circulate for several months until a highly
   pathogenic virus of the same subtype emerged. The highly pathogenic
   virus had caused death, at the time of writing, of over 13 million birds
   in 3 months. The consequences of the highly pathogenic avian influenza
   (HPAI) epidemic appear to be devastating for the poultry industry and
   the social community.
   Several conditions generated the current situation, including the high
   density of susceptible animals and the structure of the poultry industry
   in the infected area. In addition, the circulation of LPAI virus for a
   number of months inevitably delayed the prompt identification of HPAI
   and complicated the interpretation of diagnostic results. A
   reconsideration of current European legislation and a reorganization of
   the poultry industry are suggested to prevent the occurrence of similar
   situations in countries of the European Union.},

Abstract = {In the course of two experiments, an examination was made of the
   virulence and neuroinvasiveness for pigs of two pseudorabies virus
   mutants (strain 6C2TK(-), with a defect in thymidine kinase (TK)
   function; and strain 6C2TK(-), gI(-)/gE(-), with defects in TK and
   glycoproteins I and E) and of the wild-type parent strain (86/27V). At
   various times after intranasal inoculation, pigs were killed and samples
   of tonsil, lung and different levels of the trigeminal and olfactory
   nervous pathways were examined by methods that included viral isolation,
   polymerase chain reaction assay and immunohistochemistry. Both mutant
   viruses were of reduced virulence, as indicated by no more than moderate
   clinical signs and lesions, and only sporadic isolation of virus;
   moreover, unlike the wild-type parent strain, the mutant viruses were
   not reactivated from the latent state by corticosteroid treatment. In
   addition, migration of the mutant strains to the central nervous system
   (olfactory and trigeminal nervous pathways) was reduced as compared with
   that of the wild-type strain. Thus, mutations in the genes encoding the
   TK enzyme and the gI/gE complex were associated with reduced virulence,
   reduced replication in peripheral target tissues, and reduced migration
   to the olfactory and trigeminal pathways. (C) 2000 Harcourt Publishers

Abstract = {A study was carried on 1377 water buffalo serum samples from 50 farms in
   southern Italy to test the presence of Neospora caninum antibodies by
   indirect fluorescence antibody test (IFAT). Rabbit anti-buffalo
   immunoglobulins conjugated to fluorescein were used in the test.
   Fluorescence in sera dilutions above 1:200 was considered as indicative
   of the presence of N. caninum antibodies. The overall prevalence of
   infection in the animals was 34.6\%. The prevalence increased in
   relation to the age of subjects and most of the herds examined (82\%)
   were found infected. In two farms abortions and neurological signs were
   reported. No suppurative inflammatory lesions were seen, but few
   protozoan-like cysts were observed on foetal tissues by histology. (C)

Abstract = {Three filamentous phage random peptide display libraries were used in
   biopanning experiments with purified IgG from the serum of a gnotobiotic
   foal infected with equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) to enrich for epitopes
   binding to anti-EHV-1 antibodies. The sequences of the amino acids
   displayed were aligned with protein sequences of EHV-1, thereby
   identifying a number of potential antibody binding regions. Presumptive
   epitopes were identified within the proteins encoded by genes 7 (DNA
   helicase/primase complex protein), 11 (tegument protein), 16
   (glycoprotein C), 41 (integral membrane protein), 70 (glycoprotein G),
   71 (envelope glycoprotein gp300), and 74 (glycoprotein E). Two groups of
   sequences, which aligned with either glycoprotein C (gC) or glycoprotein
   E (gE), identified type-specific epitopes which could be used to
   distinguish between sera from horses infected with either EHV-1 or EHV-4
   in an ELISA using either the phage displaying the peptide or synthetic
   peptides as antigen. The gC epitope had been previously identified as an
   immunogenic region by conventional monoclonal antibody screening whereas
   the gE antibody binding region had not been previously identified. This
   demonstrates that screening of phage display peptide libraries with
   post-infection polyclonal sera is a suitable method for identifying
   diagnostic antigens for viral infections such as EHV-1. (C) 2000

Abstract = {Three experiments have been carried out to verify the effectiveness of
   an immunomodulator. Baypamun (Bayer AG) in limiting the spread of Bovine
   herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), the causal agent of infectious bovine
   rhinotracheitis (IBR).
   In the first experiment, four calves infected with BHV-1 developed
   severe disease whereas four calves given Baypamun simultaneously with
   the virus had less severe disease. Four other calves in contact with the
   infected calves became severely ill but another four given Baypamun were
   only mildly affected.
   In the second experiment three calves infected with BHV-1, which reacted
   with typical disease, were allowed to remain in contact with six calves.
   All six calves were given Baypamun at various times following the
   exposure to BHV-1 infection and all showed a much reduced reaction with
   two treated for 4 days developing no clinical disease.
   Finally, in the third experiment one calf vaccinated one month before
   the start of the experiment did not develop any signs of disease when
   housed together with a calf experimentally infected with BHV-1. Of four
   other calves, vaccinated when the infected calf showed the first signs
   of disease, only the two given Baypamun in addition to the vaccine, were
   protected from clinical disease whereas the two given vaccine only
   developed classical signs of IBR.
   In the three experiments the virus shedding by the Baypamun-treated
   calves resulted to be significantly reduced. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Title = {Using a panel of monoclonal antibodies to detect Maedi virus (MV) in
   chronic pulmonary distress of sheep},

Volume = {88},

Abstract = {A selected panel of six monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against Maedi-Visna
   virus (MVV), recognising the core proteins (p27 and p15) and the
   envelope protein (gp105) of MVV, was tested using different unmasking
   techniques on paraffin embedded lung samples of a seropositive sheep.
   Only three mAbs were chosen, according to their strong reactivity. mAbs
   1A7, 1B6 and 4B3 were employed in an immunohistochemical trial focused
   on the diagnosis of the lungs of 26 sheep with progressive pulmonary
   distress. These mAbs demonstrated MVV in 21 out of 26 cases including
   lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP) and pulmonary adenomatosis. In
   only nine cases did all three mAbs react positively with the same
   sample. The sensitivity of immunohistochemical diagnosis of Maedi
   pneumonia can be increased by using mAbs 1A7, 4B3 and 1B6 together; that
   is a panel of mAbs direct against the envelope (gp105) and capsid (p27)
   viral proteins. The positive signal was focal and confined to the
   cytoplasm of bronchoalveolar epithelial cells and alveolar-interstitial
   macrophages. The results suggest that this panel of mAbs is useful to
   confirm severe LIP lesions such as Maedi pneumonia, to demonstrate Maedi
   infections in mild LIP, to demonstrate MVV in mixed pulmonary changes,
   and to investigate the pathogenesis of Maedi-Visna. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Journal = {VETERINARY JOURNAL},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {160},
Number = {1},
Pages = {17-24},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {We investigated the specificity of the gamma-interferon test for bovine
   tuberculosis (TB) in 1557 cattle in 30 paratuberculosis-free and
   officially certified TB-free dairy herds, located in three provinces of
   the Lombardy Region in Northern Italy. The TB-free status of the herds
   under examination was further confirmed by the tuberculin skin test, by
   an antibody assay and by Post mortem examination of animals culled from
   the herds during the study period. The specificity of the
   gamma-interferon tests after a single test and a double sampling scheme
   were 88.8\% and 95.4\%, respectively. After a single test, 11.7\% of
   dubious reactors were also detected, while most cattle (47.4\%) were
   shown to be avian reactors, probably due to contamination from infected
   birds and/or forage. There was strong evidence that the specificity of
   the test could be related to the animals' interaction with environmental
   mycobacteria and/or ageing. To reduce the percentage of nonspecific
   bovine reactors under alleged TB-free conditions, test procedures might
   involve the use of more specific antigens and/or different reaction
   thresholds. (C) 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.},

Title = {Protein and protein-free dry matter rumen degradability in buffalo,

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The in sacco protein and protein-free dry matter rumen degradability of
   three feeds, concentrate, alfalfa hay and maize silage, was determined
   simultaneously in three animal species: four Mediterranean buffalo
   (Bubalus bubalis) bulls, four Friesian hulls and four Delle Langhe rams,
   which received four diets differing in forage:concentrate ratio (1 =
   87.5:12.5; 2 = 75.0:25.0; 3 = 62.5:37.5; 4 = 50.0:50.0) at the level of
   50 g DM/kg(0.75) per day. The three feeds, which composed the four
   diets, were incubated in the rumen for 0, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48 and 72 (120
   only for hay) hours. The solids passage rate values k(1), utilized to
   compute the effective degradability of the three feeds, were: 2.80,
   2.42, 2.39 and 2.24 g/100 g h(-1) for buffalo; 3.57, 2.82, 2.86 and 2.67
   g/100 g h(-1) for cattle; 3.07, 2.88, 2.84 and 2.57 g/100 g h(-1) for
   sheep, obtained with the four diets. Significant differences were found
   among the three species with regard to crude protein and protein-free
   dry matter rumen degradability for the three feeds, with the exception
   of alfalfa hay for the last parameter. The lowest values were recorded
   in cattle and sheep compared to buffalo (crude protein rumen
   degradability: 58.8 and 62.8 vs. 64.8 g/100 g concentrate, 57.0 and 56.4
   vs. 62.7 g/100 g hay, 58.7 and 60.7 vs. 68.6 g/100 g maize silage;
   protein-free dry matter rumen degradability: 64.1 and 69.0 vs. 70.0
   g/100 g concentrate, 48.2 and 48.5 vs. 49.2 g/100 g hay; 56.0 and 58.6
   vs. 64.8 g/100 g maize silage). The effective rumen degradability has
   also been calculated utilizing the theoretical passage rate constants
   (k(t) = 3 g/100 g h(-1) for forages and k(1) = 6 g/100 g h(-1) for
   concentrate); the estimation of differences among species was not
   affected by the use of experimental or theoretical k(1) for both
   effective crude protein rumen degradability of utilized forages and
   effective protein-free dry matter rumen degradability of maize silage.
   Two correlations were considered: between degradation rate constant
   ``c{''} and passage rate constant ``k(1){''} of solid or fluid values as
   well as between the degradable fraction degraded per unit of time
   ``(b/100){''}c{''} and passage rate constant ``k(1){''} of solid and
   fluid values. The largest number of significant values for crude protein
   was recorded in sheep and buffalo while largest numbers were recorded in
   cattle for protein-free dry matter. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Volume = {188},

Abstract = {Following oral inoculation of BALB/c mice, Salmonella abortusovis strain
   SS44 was recovered in lower numbers from the Peyer's patches and
   mesenteric lymph nodes compared with S. typhimurium strain SL1344,
   whereas splenic infections were equivalent between the two serovars.
   SS44 was cured of its virulence plasmid or subjected to mutagenesis of
   the spv genes, and the Spv(-) derivatives were tested for virulence in
   mice. Plasmid-cured S. abortusovis SU40 retained virulence in BALB/c
   mice when inoculated intraperitoneally. On the other hand, mice infected
   orally with SU40 had greatly reduced splenic infection compared to those
   infected with wild-type SS44. Similar results were obtained after Tn5
   insertion mutagenesis of the spvR gene or deletion of the sppABCD locus.
   These results suggest that in the gut-associated lymphoid tissues S.
   abortusovis may replicate less than S. typhimurium and that the S.
   abortusovis virulence plasmid primarily affects systemic infection after
   oral inoculation but not after intraperitoneal administration in the
   mouse model. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. on behalf of

Abstract = {A fast and sensitive chemiluminescent (CL) enzyme immunoassay for
   clenbuterol (CLB) analysis in bovine urine has been developed.
   Clenbuterol (CLB) specific polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbit
   using a CLB azo derivative conjugated with ovalbumin. Horseradish
   peroxidase (HRP) was used as label and conjugated with the same
   derivative. In the developed competitive method, antibodies were
   immobilized on 384-wells black polystyrene microtiter plates; the sample
   volume was 20 mu l and HRP-labeled CLB activity was immediately
   measured, using different CL substrates, after 10 min incubation time.
   Emitted light was recorded using a sensitive back-illuminated, cooled
   CCD camera or a conventional, photomultiplier-based micrtotiter plate
   reader. The developed method fulfills all the requirements of precision
   (CV below 10\%) and accuracy (mean recovery from 96 to 110\%) with a
   detection limit of 0.08 ppb in urine matrix. The use of 384-wells
   microtiter plate allows a 5-fold reduction in reagent quantity and the
   CL detection improves the detectability of the HRP-labeled tracer, thus
   reducing analysis time. The developed method is therefore suitable for
   high-throughput screening of CLB in urine samples, with reduced costs as
   compared with conventional colorimetric enzyme immunoassays, thanks to
   the possibility to optimize the system in non-equilibrium immunological
   conditions and with a very fast chemiluminescence detection of the
   HRP-label activity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A rapid and very effective analytical procedure for the simultaneous
   liquid chromatographic determination of two coccidiostats, clopidol
   (CLOP) and nicarbazin (NICA), in poultry feeds was developed and tested.
   The ground feed samples were extracted using aqueous dimethylformamide
   after moistening with water. Go-extracted feed constituents were removed
   with a solid-phase extraction alumina-basic column and the eluates were
   directly analyzed on an ODS column (250x4.6 mm, 5 mu m) with
   acetonitrile-0.01 M acetate buffer (pH 4.6) as eluent. UV detection of
   CLOP and the 4,4'-dinitrocarbanilide portion of NICA was carried out at
   265 and 345 nm, respectively. The mean recovery from NICA spiked samples
   was 95\% with a RSD of 4\% in a concentration range of 2-150 mg/kg while
   for CLOP it was 98\% with a RSD of 58 in a concentration range of 5-150
   mg/kg. The limits of detection of NICA and CLOP in feed, based on a
   detector signal-to-noise ratio of 3, were estimated to be 1 mg/kg and
   2.5 mg/kg, respectively, and the lowest levels tested in feeds by this
   procedure were 2 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Title = {Experimental induction of fluconazole resistance in Candida tropicalis
   ATCC 750},
Journal = {ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {44},
Number = {6},

Abstract = {Candida tropicalis is less commonly isolated from clinical specimens
   than Candida albicans. Unlike C. albicans, which can be occasionally
   found as a commensal, C. tropicalis is almost always associated with the
   development of fungal infections. In addition, C. tropicalis has been
   reported to be resistant to fluconazole (FLC). To analyze the
   development of FLC resistance in C. tropicalis, an FLC-susceptible
   strain (ATCC 750) (MIC = 1.0 mu g/ml) was cultured in liquid medium
   containing increasing FLC concentrations from 8.0 to 128 mu g/ml. The
   strain developed variable degrees of FLC resistance which paralleled the
   concentrations of FLC used in the medium. The highest MICs of FLC were
   16, 256, and 512 mu g/ml for strains grown in medium with 8.0, 32, and
   128 mu g of FLC per mi, respectively. Development of resistance was
   rapid and could be observed already after a single subculture in
   azole-containing medium. The resistant strains were cross-resistant to
   itraconazole (MIC > 1.0 mu g/ml) and terbinafine (MIC > 512 mu g/ml) but
   not to amphotericin B. Isolates grown in FLC at concentrations of 8.0
   and 32 mu g/ml reverted to low MICs (1.0 mu g/ml) after 12 and II
   passages in FI,C-free medium, respectively. The MIC for one isolate
   grown in FLC (128 mu g/ml) (128 R) reverted to 16 mu g/ml but remained
   stable over 60 passages in FLC-fi-ee medium. Azole-resistant isolates
   revealed upregulation of two different multidrug efflux transporter
   genes: the major facilitators gene MDR1 and the ATP-binding cassette
   transporter CDR1. The development of FLC resistance in vitro correlated
   well with the results obtained in an experimental model of disseminated
   candidiasis. While FLC given at 10 mg/kg of body weight/day was
   effective in reducing the fungal burden of mice infected with the parent
   strain, the same dosing regimen was ineffective in mice infected with
   strain 128 R. Finally, the acquisition of in vitro PLC resistance in
   strain 128 R was related to a loss of virulence. The results of our
   study elucidate important characteristics and potential mechanisms of
   FLC resistance in C. tropicalis.},

Abstract = {ELISA techniques developed for the veterinary diagnosis of Rabbit
   Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD) in domestic rabbits were used for studying
   the epidemiology of RHD in Australian wild rabbits. The combination of
   ELISA techniques that distinguished IEA, IgG and IgM antibody responses
   and a longitudinal data set, mainly based on capture-mark-recapture of
   rabbits, provided a reliable basis for interpreting serology and set the
   criteria used to classify rabbits' immunological status. Importantly,
   young with maternal antibodies, immune rabbits and rabbits apparently
   re-exposed to RHD were readily separated. Three outbreaks of RHD
   occurred ill 1996-7. The timing of RHD outbreaks was mainly driven by
   recruitment of young rabbits that generally contracted RHD after they
   lost their maternally derived immunity. Young that lost maternal
   antibodies in summer were not immediately infected, apparently because
   transmission of RHDV slows at that time, but contracted RHD in the
   autumn when conditions were again suitable for disease spread.},

Abstract = {During final phases of eradication programmes, strains of Mycobacterium
   sp. not belonging to the tuberculosis complex increase their relative
   frequency and are responsible for positive skin test reactions.
   Moreover, the specificity of any indirect diagnostic test, such as the
   skin test, is never completely accurate, therefore even when
   tuberculosis infection is completely eradicated, a number of false
   positive reactions are to be expected. The dim of this paper is to
   evaluate the performances of traditional isolation/typing techniques,
   automatic isolation/typing techniques based on fluorimetric detection of
   bacterial growth (Bactec), skin tests and the -interferon test. Samples
   examined for the evaluation of test sensitivities originated from 154
   infected animals belonging to 32 infected herds. Samples used as
   negative controls in the evaluation of test specificities originated
   from 86 animals of nine officially infection-free herds. The automatic
   isolation/typing technique based on fluorimetric detection of bacterial
   growth showed higher sensitivity than the traditional isolation typing
   technique. Moreover, it allowed a safer processing of bacterial
   cultures, decreasing the risk for laboratory workers. The observed
   performance of the gamma-interferon test was considered beneficial in
   that it increased the sensitivity of individual diagnosis within an
   infected herd, especially in `problem herds', but its poor specificity
   did not improve detection of infected herds compared to the skin test.},

Abstract = {Six laboratories participated in an exercise to compare the sensitivity
   and specificity of RT-PCR tests for the detection of classical swine
   fever virus (CSFV). Two sets of coded samples were prepared by serial
   dilution of positive samples and then distributed to each of the
   laboratories. One set comprised 34 samples of random primed cDNA. These
   had been synthesised from viral RNA representative of seven different
   genetic subtypes of CSFV. The other set comprised 40 clinical samples
   containing tonsil, spleen, whole blood or serum from a pig that had been
   experimentally infected with CSFV. Each laboratory tested the samples
   using one or more PCR/RT-PCR tests that they were accustomed to using.
   The methods and results of the laboratories were compared with one
   another. The RT-PCR results obtained from testing the clinical samples
   were also compared with those obtained by virus isolation and antigen
   ELISA.
   The cDNA from three CSFV isolates was detected poorly or not at all by
   some of the PCR tests. For clinical samples, the order of sensitivity
   was RT-nested PCR>RT-PCR>virus isolation>ELISA. Both RT-PCR and
   RT-nested PCR appeared to give some false positive results. Several of
   the PCR tests appear suitable in terms of specificity and sensitivity.
   Further trials are necessary to compare results when the same test is
   performed by different laboratories, and to show that improved control
   procedures can eliminate problems due to false positive reactions.
   A limited comparison of extraction and reverse transcription procedures
   showed similar results in each of three participating laboratories, even
   though the methods were not standardised. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {Long-acting beta adrenergic agonists, such as clenbuterol accumulate in
   the liver, but not meat of treated farm animals, and result in epidemic
   poisonings in consumers. We describe an outbreak of poisoning in 15
   people following the consumption of meat. Clinical symptoms (distal
   tremors, palpitations, headache, tachipnoea-dyspnoea, and also moderate
   hyperglycaemia, hypokalemia and leucocytosis) were seen in nine
   hospitalised patients, starting about 0.5-3 h after poisoning, and
   disappearing within 3-5 days later. Clenbuterol was found in the urine
   of all the symptomatic patients, at higher levels than pharmacokinetic
   computing (mean level 28 ng/ml, 36 h after ingestion), based on the
   levels found in the meat (1140-1480 ng/g edible tissue). Thus, epidemic
   poisoning can be produced following the consumption of contaminated
   meat. The need for a better definition of pharmaco- and toxico-kinetics,
   not only for drugs ingested as parent drug, but also when ingested as
   residues with animal tissues, is recommended. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {An adult male mountain hare (Lepus timidus), shot during the hunting
   season on the slopes of hit. Civetta (eastern Alps, Veneto, northeastern
   Italy), was eviscerated and diffuse nodular lesions of verminous
   pneumonia were observed. Adult helminths were collected and male
   specimens were identified as Protostrongylus pulmonalis. Histologically,
   a non-purulent interstitial pneumonia and a desquamative bronchiolitis
   and alveolitis, along with thickening of alveolar septa, were apparent
   in the nodules. In several enlarged alveoli, a large number of eggs and
   lan ae of nematodes were found. This is the first recorded case of
   protostrongyliasis in mountain hares from Italy and from an alpine
   population.},

   healthy with no clinical sign suggestive of leptospirosis. The observed
   seroprevalence in sheep was 6.1\%, whereas the seropositivity rate for
   goat serum samples was 2.1\%. The highest serological prevalence in
   sheep was recorded for serovar castellonis, followed by poi, sejroe,
   hardjo subtype hardjobovis, copenhageni, and cynopteri. Titres to poi
   were the only ones found in goats. These findings, which are proof of
   Leptospira infection in Alto Adige-South Tyrol, indicate that loci of

Abstract = {Serological surveys are the most-used way to study diseases in
   foe-ranging wild animals. However, the difficulty in obtaining a
   sufficient number of suitable serum samples is a major problem. To
   resolve this problem, we investigated the possibility of using
   lung-tissue extract in place of blood serum for searching for antibodies
   against Brucella abortus.
   Antibodies titres against B. abortus was tested from blood serum and
   lung-tissue extract from 112 chamois and 99 cattle. Although in
   complement-fixation-test, lung-tissue extract titres usually were one-to
   three-fold lower than serum titres, there was a good agreement between
   serum and lung-tissue extract positivity both in chamois and in cattle.
   The lung-tissue extract appears a suitable resource in monitoring
   brucellosis in chamois. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {A parasitological survey of the bivalve Chamelea gallina was carried out
   from natural beds of the Adriatic Sea, where anomalous mortalities were
   observed during the last years (1997-1999). The occurrence of protozoans
   belonging to the families Porosporidae, Hemispeiridae and Trichodinidae
   was recorded. Porosporidae of the genus Nematopsis, present with 4
   species, showed a prevalence of 100\%, irrespective of sampling
   localities, season or bivalve size, but differences were found when
   percentage of infection was calculated per organ. As for the genus
   Porospora this is the first record in C. gallina. Among Hemispeiridae,
   the genera Ancistrum and Boveria were found in the gills. The results
   suggest that severe infections of protozoans of the genus Nematopsis
   could cause a not negligible respiratory sufferance, with a possible
   role in the decline of the natural banks.},

Abstract = {In order to evaluate the use of the Bactoscan FC in comparison to the
   Bactoscan 8000 and its relationship to the standard plate count (FIL n
   degrees 100B/1991), some tests have been carried out. The Bactoscan FC
   and the reference method are related by a linear regression (y = 1,0317
   x - 0,9822) as is the BFC to the B8000 with a linear regression, similar
   to the one furnished by Fosselectric, allowing the results of the 2
   instruments to be equilibrated. In our experience it is possible to
   conclude that the BFC counts approximately 5\% more than the B8000.
   Considering the use of cytometric flow cell technology and the presence
   of a dye such as Etidium Bromide, the effect of somatic cells on
   bacterial count has been investigated. The results were statistically
   significant but with little relevance. In our experience, the BFC
   results could be conditioned only by very high cell values (2 million
   cell/ml) which are seldom observed in bulk milk samples. The relevance
   of this effect could be neglected if evaluated with respect to other
   typical variation factors involved in the bacterial contamination in raw
   milk.
   Where possible, data are evaluated in a similar way to other authors to
   allow confrontation with their results.},

Abstract = {12 Large-White-Landrace piglets were subdivided in four groups of 3 and
   housed in separate units. The: piglets of three groups were inoculated
   with the 86/27V 6C2 thymidine kinase negative (TK-) mutant of
   pseudorabies virus (PRV), by different routes. A second inoculation with
   the same mutant was given to the pigs 21 days later. The animals of a
   fourth group were left as uninoculated controls. 21 days following the
   second inoculation with the TK- mutant all pigs were challenge infected
   with the virulent PRV. On post challenge day (PCD) 30 all pigs were
   killed and samples for virus detection and histology were taken from
   several organs.
   The inoculated TK- mutant of PRV did not induce any ill effects in the
   pigs except a transient febrile reaction in some animals. Virus was
   recovered from nasal swabbings from one pig 2 days after the first
   inoculation of the mutant.
   After challenge exposure with virulent PRV, the TK- mutant-inoculated
   pigs were apparently protected, whereas the control pigs all were
   severely affected and recovered very slowly over 3 weeks. Virus was
   isolated from the nasal swabbings from the TK- mutant-inoculated pigs on
   PCDs 2 and 4, whereas the nasal swabbings from the control piglets were
   all positive for virus from PCD 2 through PCD 10. PNA analysis of the
   virus recovered showed a pattern identical to that of the virulent PRV.
   Histologic lesions were found in the respiratory and the central nervous
   systems, however, the lesions in the TK- mutant-inoculated pigs were
   much milder compared to those registered for the control pigs.
   Virus was not isolated from any of the tissue samples that were tested,
   hut viral DNA with sequences typical of PRV genome was detected by PCR
   in all. samples of trigeminal ganglia from either the TK-
   mutant-inoculated pies or from the controls. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

   reactions in the serum dilution of 1:10. On retesting, these sera and
   additional 30 sera collected repeatedly in both farms gave negative
   results. In isolation attempts, 953 lung samples collected from
   slaughtered cattle at the same abattoirs, and 326 nasal swabs collected
   from 11 herds proved to be negative for the presence of MmmSC, but M.
   bovis was isolated frequently. In the small farms 23.95\% of the animals
   had pleurisy and/or pneumonia while in the large herds 34.69\% had
   lesions. DNA extracted from 50 nasal swabs and 430 lung samples was
   examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using M. mycoides

Abstract = {The authors propose a contribution to the possible revision of Chapters
   1.4.1. and 1.4.2. of the International Animal Health Code (Code) of the
   Office International des Epizooties (OIE). In particular, data are
   presented to illustrate some of the inadequacies of both the rationale
   and the results of the method for risk assessment reported in the Code.
   The method suggested by the Code for risk assessment is based on the
   calculation of the `probability of the occurrence of at least one
   outbreak' of a given disease following the importation of a given
   quantity of either live animals or animal products (unrestricted risk
   estimate). This is usually undertaken when dealing with rare events.
   For a country such as Italy, this method may not be particularly useful
   as the frequency of disease outbreaks is what should be estimated, so as
   to provide decision makers with appropriate and relevant information.
   Practical use of risk information generated by the use of the OIE risk
   assessment method for swine vesicular disease (SVD) would have
   encouraged the Chief Veterinary Officer of Ita ly to pro hi bit all im
   ports of swine from the Netherlands a nd Belgium for at least two years
   in the early 1990s, with the consequential heavy economic losses for
   both Italy and the exporting countries. On the contrary, the number of
   actual outbreaks of the disease due to direct imports of swine from
   Member States of the European Union (EU), which occurred in Italy in
   1992, 1993 and 1994 was very low (two to five outbreaks due to direct
   imports of swine from the Netherlands and one to two from Belgium).
   An example of a method for assessing the risks associated with high
   volumes of trade in commodities is also described. This method is based
   on the Monte Carlo simulation and provides the information required to
   evaluate the costs of the strategies compared. The method can be used to
   predict the number of outbreaks which are likely to occur following
   importation and enables a comparison to be made of alternative
   safeguards. This would lead to the selection of the most cost-effective
   one. The comparison is conducted using risk curves and allows a
   quantitative evaluation and comparison to be made of various scenarios,
   varying from an absence of safeguards to combinations of various
   safeguards.},

Abstract = {Determination of the G and P serotypes of group A bovine rotaviruses
   from 149 samples of feces or intestinal contents collected from calves
   showing clinical signs of neonatal diarrhea was performed by a nested
   reverse transcription-PCR typing assay. The G6 serotype was the most
   prevalent, accounting for viruses in 55.7\% of the samples; viruses of
   the G10 and G8 serotypes were found in 34.9 and 4.7\% of the samples,
   respectively, The virus in one sample (0.7\%) was not classified due to
   concomitant infection with G6 and G8 strains, whereas viruses in six
   samples (4.0\%) could not be characterized with any of the three G
   serotype-specific primers selected for the present study. When examined
   for their P-serotype specificities, viruses in 55 and 42.3\% of the
   samples were characterized as P{[}11] and P{[}5], respectively, no
   P{[}1] serotype was identified, and viruses in 2.7\% of the samples
   could not be classified due to multiple reactivity with both P{[}5]- and
   P{[}11]-specific primers. Various combinations of G and P serotypes were
   observed, the most frequent being G6,P{[}5] (38.3\%), G10,P{[}11]
   (31.5\%), and G6,P{[}ll] (15.4\%). The results of the present study,
   while contributing to a better understanding of the epidemiology of
   bovine rotaviruses in Italy, address the relevance of serotype
   specificity with regard to the constancy of the quality of bovine
   rotavirus vaccines under different field conditions.},

Abstract = {The results of a serological survey for bovine herpes virus (BHV1)
   antibodies in the breeding cattle population of the Veneto region are
   presented. The data do not support the hypothesis of an high prevalence
   of BHV1; on farms where vaccination was not carried out most animals
   were seronegative, and seropositive animals were generally older.
   Therefore, when drawing up the guidelines for a control programme,
   systematic immunization with glycoprotein E-deleted vaccines) should be
   restricted only to farms with a high prevalence of BHV1 antibodies
   and/or with a high risk of BHV1 occurrence; in most unvaccinated farms a
   `test and removal' policy appears to be more appropriate in order to
   rapidly eradicate BHV1 from the entire stock.},

   animals are not exported. In order to assess the reliability of the
   serological results, three randomised batches of samples (653 sera),
   corresponding to an equivalent number of shipments (October and December
   1994 and March 1995) were counterchecked. Control RBTs were carried out
   by expatriate veterinarians working on behalf of international
   non-governmental organisations and by the Istituto Zooprofilattico
   Sperimentale of Padua, Italy, which also performed the complement
   fixation test (CFT). A fourth batch (n = 100), including a group of sera

Abstract = {A significant percentage of rabbit does fail to become pregnant after
   AI. We hypothesized that uterine infections induced by the insemination
   procedure are related to delayed luteolysis and high progesterone
   concentrations noted to present at the time of AI. The rabbits, randomly
   assigned to 4 groups (3 animals/group), were given 0.8 mu g GnRH
   analogue (Day 0) just prior to infusing the uterus with sterile extender
   (control group) or with extender inoculated with 0.5, 1, and 2 x 10(6)
   Pasteurella multocida (treated groups). The effects of treatments on
   functional lifespan of CL were assessed by evaluating plasma
   progesterone from Day 0 to Day 23 of pseudopregnancy. In treated
   rabbits, the progesterone profiles closely overlapped those found in
   controls until approximately Day 14. Thereafter, they varied greatly
   between animals, but luteolysis was delayed by at least 5-6 d and
   developed less rapidly than in controls. On Day 21, progesterone
   concentrations were higher than normal in 4 treated does. In a field
   survey, vaginal swabs were collected at the time of the second AI from 1
   14 non-pregnant rabbits and those positive to bacteriological culture,
   were killed humanely 16 d later to collect uterine swabs. Positive
   uterine swabs were found only in 19 of the 34 does having a positive
   vaginal swabs and all of them were not pregnant. The most frequent
   pathogen isolated was S. aureus (50\%), followed by E. coli (37.5 \%)
   and P. multocida (12.5\%). We demonstrated that uterine infection
   increases the life-span of CL in non-pregnant does and that infections
   of the genital tract system are quite common among does on breeding
   farms, probably related to using AI. (C) 1999 by Elsevier Science Inc.},

Abstract = {A study has been carried out in the centre-east area of Corsica
   (altitude 850 m a. s. l.) in three goat herds (Corsican local breed)
   browsing a Mediterranean shrubland without any additional feed supply.
   The practical usefulness of BCS and metabolic profile in order to assess
   the nutritional conditions of goats during the milking period (80 to 120
   days of lactation) was investigated on a sample of 18 goats selected in
   each herd. BCS, metabolic profile, and milk yield/quality were
   individually measured. A negative overall correlation was found between
   the mean BCS and milk yield (r = -0.24, P < 0.05), due to the opposite
   trend of milk production and fat deposition. In the herd with highest
   average milk yield, lower blood urea (P < 0.05), in early and mid
   lactation, and higher milk protein content (NS, P > 0.05) were found.
   Blood P and Mg values indicate a sufficient intake of these minerals.
   Our results indicate that, under the specific conditions of this study,
   goats browsing a Mediterranean shrubland can produce a fairly good
   quantity of milk with good composition, without a significant depletion
   of fat reserves or marked metabolic imbalances. Under extensive
   husbandry conditions, BCS and to a lesser extent blood parameters, can
   help in explaining the differences in milk yield between goat herds. (C)

   connections between several outbreaks and emphasized the well-known risk
   factors for avian influenza such as bird movement, rearing of mixed
   populations and contact with migratory waterfowl. Control measures
   listed in European Union directive 92/40/EEC were implemented promptly
   and spread of the infection to intensively-reared domestic poultry was

Abstract = {Viral encephalopathy and retinopathy, otherwise known as fish
   encephalitis or viral nervous necrosis (VNN), is an emerging problem in
   several farmed marine fish species in various geographic areas all over
   the world. Since summer 1995, heavy losses affecting mainly juvenile and
   adult sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) have been observed in several
   on-growing facilities in Italy. Dying fish show abnormal swimming
   behaviour and, at temperatures higher than 20-22 degrees C, mortality
   rates range between 15 and 50\%. Neither significant external nor
   internal gross pathological signs, except frequent abnormal swim bladder
   hyperinflation, were detected. Histological investigations reveal
   vacuolations in the grey matter of the brain and spinal cord and in the
   granular layers of the retina. Serial tissue sections examined by an
   immunohistochemical method carried out with antisera against fish
   nodaviruses showed a positive reaction. Additionally, spherical
   virus-like particles 22-25 nm in diameter were detected by electron
   microscopy in negative stained preparations of brain tissues, and the
   same samples gave a positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain
   reaction (RT-PCR) for the T4 region of the fish nodavirus gene. These
   results indicate that both juvenile and adult sea bass subject to mass
   mortality in Italy since summer 1995 are infected with a fish nodavirus
   and strongly suggest that the identified virus is the cause of the
   observed mortality. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All

Title = {Oxidative metabolism of monensin in rat liver microsomes and

Abstract = {Monensin (MON) is an ionophore antibiotic widely used in veterinary
   practice as a coccidiostatic or a growth promoter. The aims of this
   study were to characterize the P-450 isoenzyme(s) involved in the
   biotransformation of the ionophore and to investigate how this process
   may be affected by tiamulin and other chemotherapeutic agents known to
   produce toxic interactions with MON when administered concurrently in
   vivo. In liver microsomes from untreated rats (UT) or from rats
   pretreated, respectively, with ethanol (ETOH), beta-naphthoflavone (beta
   NAF), phenobarbital (PB), pregnenolone 16 alpha-carbonitrile (PCN), or
   dexamethasone (DEX), the rate of MON O-demethylation was the following:
   DEX > PCN > PB >> UT = ETOH > beta NAF; similar results were obtained by
   measuring total MON metabolism. In addition, the extent of
   triacetyloleandomycinmediated P-450 complexes was greatly reduced by the
   prior addition of 100 mu M MON. In DEX-treated microsomes, MON
   O-demethylation was found to fit monophasic Michaelis-Menten kinetics
   (K-M = 67.6 +/- 0.01 mu M; V-max = 4.75 +/- 0.76 nmol/min/mg protein).
   Tiamulin markedly inhibited this activity in an apparent competitive
   manner, with a calculated K-i (Dixon plot) of 8.2 mu M and an IC50 of
   about 25 mu M. At the latter concentration, only ketoconazole or
   metyrapone, which can bind P-450 3A, inhibited MON O-demethylase to a
   greater extent than tiamulin, whereas alpha-naphthoflavone,
   chloramphenicol, or sulphametasine was less effective. These results
   suggest that P-450 3A plays an important role in the oxidative
   metabolism of MON and that compounds capable of binding or inhibiting
   this isoenzyme could be expected to give rise to toxic interactions with
   the ionophore.},

Abstract = {A total of 120 muscle tissues from three horses naturally infected with
   Trichinella spiralis were examined. The head was the most infected site.
   In particular, the muscles harbouring the highest number of larvae were:
   musculus buccinator (12, 411 and 1183 larvae g(-1)), the tongue (11, 615
   and 1749 larvae g(-1)), m. levator labii maxillaris (17, 582 and 1676
   larvae g(-1)), and the masseter (4.9, 289 and 821 larvae g(-1)).
   Compared with the diaphragm, the number of larvae per gram was from 3.5
   to 6.8 times higher in the tongue, from 3.5 to 6.5 higher in m. levator
   labii maxillaris, and from 2.5 to 4.6 higher in m, buccinator. Of the
   examined muscles, the diaphragm had from the 6th to the 15th highest
   level of infection (3.1, 166 and 256 larvae g(-1)). published data from
   experimentally infected horses confirm these results, suggesting that
   efforts to detect predilection sites should focus on the head muscles.},

Abstract = {Female water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) calves (n = 28) aged 7 to 10 d
   were divided into four; groups of seven animals each to examine the
   effects of space allowance (Group A: 2.6 indoor m(2) + 2.0 outdoor
   m(2)/calf; Group B: 2.6 indoor m(2)/calf; Group C: 1.5 indoor m(2)/calf;
   Group D: 1.0 indoor m(2)/calf) on behavioral, endocrine, and immune
   variables for a period of 60 d. Animals were offered 7 L/d of a
   commercial acidified milk substitute. The calves averaged 45.9 kg
   initially and 92.4 kg finally. The behavior observations were conducted
   7 d after grouping and fortnightly thereafter. At wk 4 and 8, the
   phytohemagglutinin (PHA) skin test was performed to induce aspecific
   delayed hypersensitivity. At wk 1 and 3, calves were injected i.m. with
   keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Antibody titers were determined at weekly
   intervals for 7 wk. Calves in pens with greater space allowance (Groups
   A and B) were less active than Groups C and D (P < .001). The latter
   groups were also observed feeding more often at wk 7 (P < .01). Calves
   provided with an outdoor paddock spent less time standing than Groups C
   and D (P < .01), and lay with a greater number of outstretched legs (P <
   .001). Groups C and D showed a lower reaction to PHA in both skin tests
   than did Groups A and B (P <.001 and P < .05, respectively). Group A
   showed an antibody response consistently higher than groups B, C, and D
   (P < .01, P < .05, and P < .05, respectively). At the end of the
   experimental period, the calves were subjected to an isolation test
   lasting 10 min. Group D showed a longer duration of movement with
   respect to Groups A and B (P < .01); animals from Group C walked more
   than did Group A (P < .05). Cortisol concentration evaluated 0, 10, 45,
   90, 150, and 225 min after separation from the group was higher in
   Groups C and D than in Groups A and B (P < .01). For all animals, the
   highest cortisol level was observed immediately after the isolation test
   (P < .001). Space restriction resulted in evidence of stress in the
   animals as shown by alterations in a number of physiological responses.
   However, the use of small groups of only seven animals per pen may have
   affected their reactions to space restriction. It is possible that using
   larger groups could change these conclusions.},

   keratinocyte growth. The morphological and morphometrical analyses of
   submerged human fibroblast cultures and human epidermis reconstructed in
   vitro shelved that the compound 5 behaves similarly to all-trans
   retinoic acid: it induces a decrease in all the cell parameters of
   submerged fibroblast cultures, and modulates the differentiation of
   keratinocytes in in vitro reconstructed epidermis. Compound 5 induces
   thickening of epidermis in vivo, one of the most remarkable
   pharmacological effects of retinoids on skin, but compared to all-trans
   retinoic acid, it induces a weaker irritation on guinea-pig skin in
   terms of both erythema and scaling. Compound 5 could then represent a

Abstract = {Five sets of vaccines were prepared using Mycoplasma agalactine washed
   cultures inactivated with phenol (1), formalin (2), heat-treatment (3),
   sodium hypochlorite (4) and saponin (5). All sets, except for
   saponin-vaccine, were adjuvated with aluminium hydroxide. Five groups of
   six sar ewes were inoculated twice before pregnancy, once during
   pregnancy and challenged during the lactation period. Monthly blood
   samples were taken from the vaccinated sheep and from 12 controls: sera
   were assayed by immunoblotting, ELISA and growth inhibition tests. Four
   control sheep were infected by intracanalicular route with pooled
   mycoplasmas at concentrations of 10(4), 10(5), 10(6) and 10(7) CCU. The
   challenge involved using infested milk to contaminate the remaining
   sheep. All the controls and some ewes from groups 2, 3 and 4 developed
   contagious agalactia. Ewes vaccinated with phenol- and
   saponin-inactivated mycoplasmas resisted experimental challenge. These
   results suggest that these two vaccines are effective and that their use
   could limit the diffusion of M. agalactiae infection. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Title = {Molecular detection of Babesia equi and Babesia caballi in horse blood
   by PCR amplification of part of the 16S rRNA gene},
Journal = {VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {84},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {75-83},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Babesia equi and Babesia caballi are tick-borne haemoparasites that may
   cause babesiosis of Equidae. In southern Europe B. equi is enzootic and
   infections may occur asymptomatically and more frequently than those due
   to B, caballi. Complement fixation test (CFT) is the official
   serological test for the diagnosis of equine babesiosis, but it has low
   sensitivity during early and latent stages of the disease. With the aim
   of developing more sensitive and rapid direct diagnostic alternatives,
   PCR systems that amplified DNA targets of 664 or 659 bp regions of the
   16S rRNA genes were designed and demonstrated to specifically detect the
   genomes of B, equi and B. caballi, respectively. An approximated
   parasitaemia of 0.000083\% was detected by the PCR system for B. equi
   compared with reported limits of 0.001\% for microscopic examination of
   stained blood smears, and up to 0.00025\% for DNA probes. Although the
   sensitivity of the PCR system for B. caballi could not be estimated,
   samples with microscopically undetectable parasitaemia as well as those
   with 0.017\% parasitised red blood cells were detected, DNA extracts of
   blood collected with EDTA as an anticoagulant from 23 horses from
   Portugal were tested with both PCR systems. Of these samples, 22 were
   positive for B. equi and 8 were positive for B. caballi with PCR tests
   and intraerythrocytic parasites were seen in all samples. Antibodies
   against both parasites were not detected by CFT in several cases, but in
   these cases the presence of either or both parasites was apparent by PCR
   tests. The PCR systems may be useful in the diagnosis of equine
   babesiosis covering a wider range of clinical disease, as useful
   adjuncts to serological, microscopic, and cultural methods, especially
   for the import and export testing of horses. (C)1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was
   used to detect Equine Arteritis Virus (EAV) in the semen of 88 horses
   and 2 donkeys, with neutralising antibodies against EAV, on the basis of
   the amplification of a 279 bp long fragment located in the viral
   polymerase gene.
   The RT-PCR assay revealed the virus at 4 TCID50/ml in cell culture and
   showed a greater sensitivity (54.4\%) than cell culture isolation
   (33.3\%).
   Moreover, the two samples of donkey semen were found positive.
   The cDNAs obtained from 14 samples of horse and 2 of donkey semen were
   sequenced. Comparing the sequence of reference strain Bucyrus, the
   analysed samples were 78-100\% identical and showed a 84-97\% nucleotide
   identity with Bucyrus isolate.
   The results demonstrate high levels of genomic heterogeneity among the
   extracted RNAs, but inside the fragment amplified a well-preserved
   region of 24 bp was found with only three mismatches in some samples,
   suggesting that this could be ideal as a probe for RT-PCR-ELISA.
   The RT-PCR-ELISA assay using the EAV 7 and 8 primer set, has proved to
   be sensitive, specific and above all directly applicable to semen.
   Additionally, the short time needed for the overall procedure makes this
   method suitable for diagnostic purposes. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {Cattle arriving for slaughter at a large abattoir in northern Italy
   between April 1997 and January 1998 were examined for intestinal
   carriage of Verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) O157 using
   an immunomagnetic separation technique. Sixty sorbitol non-fermenting
   VTEC O157 strains were isolated from 59 (13.1\%) of the 450 cattle
   examined. In particular, VTEC O157 was found in 37 (16.6\%) of 223
   feedlot cattle and in 22 (16.1\%) of 137 dairy cull cows, but not in the
   90 veal calves sampled. The isolation rate was higher during warm
   weather (17.5\%), falling to an average of 2.9\% during the winter
   months. VT-negative, O157 latex-agglutinating E. coli strains were
   isolated from 23 (5.1\%) of the 450 animals. PCR analysis showed that
   all 60 VTEC O157 strains carried the VT2 gene and that 25 strains also
   carried the VT1 gene. In addition, four of the VT-negative, O157
   latex-agglutinating E. coli strains carried the VT2 gene. Atypical
   biochemical features were observed in some VTEC O157: two strains
   (3.3\%) showed beta-glucuronidase activity, and seven (11.7\%) produced
   urease. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A variable region of the gene encoding the major glycoprotein (E2) of
   Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV) was sequenced from 12 Sardinian
   isolates which had been obtained from three geographically distinct
   regions of the Island. Phylogenetic analysis of these viruses and others
   characterized in previous studies {[}1, 2] indicated that (a) the
   Sardinian viruses were all members of the common European subgroup 2 3
   and were clearly distinct from live vaccines recently used in this area;
   (b) they could be resolved into four distinct groups in accordance with
   the region or date of isolation; (c) in at least two regions wild
   boar/domestic swine contact was implicated in virus spread; (d) the
   oldest isolate (1983) and some of the recent isolates were possibly
   introduced from mainland Italy. In addition, this study has wider
   implications for the interpretation of CSFV variation. We have been able
   to demonstrate that small variations within this region of the virus
   genome (possibly less than 2.7\% or five nucleotide substitutions) can
   be used to separate isolates into groups that precisely fit their
   geographical distribution. This finding is especially important for
   deducing the epidemiological relationships between multiple outbreaks
   caused by similar viruses that occur in close proximity.},

Abstract = {Maedi visna (MV) and caprine arthritis-encephalitis (CAE) are two
   retroviral infections distributed world wide. Antigenic cross reactions
   between the viruses have been demonstrated in gag and enu encoded
   structural proteins. Antigens from ovine lentiviruses are easier to
   produce in cell culture systems and therefore have been used in the
   development of diagnostic tests for both infections. Antigenically
   relevant epitopes have been characterised in the transmembrane protein,
   but little information is available on the immunodominant and cross
   reacting epitopes in the major capsid antigen (p25). In this study four
   different recombinant subunits of ovine lentivirus p25 were tested
   against sera from infected goats and a detailed characterisation of the
   immunodominant subunit was carried out. Highest ELISA absorbances were
   obtained with a 29 amino acid subunit located in the N'-terminal half of
   p25. Through the analysis of overlapping peptides spanning this region
   we identified a 17 amino acid sequence that can be used in the
   development of a highly standardized synthetic peptide-based assay. (C)

Abstract = {The fish pathogen Vibrio anguillarum causes a lethal infection in farmed
   fish characterized by hemorrhagic septicemia. There are no reports of
   experimental laboratory infections in warm-blooded animals. We
   investigated the effects of an intraperitoneal infection with different
   doses of a V. anguillarum suspension in mice and guinea pigs. The
   infection caused a 95-100\% of mortality in 24-48 h. Hemorrhagic
   septicemia was observed at necropsy and confirmed by histological and
   hematological examination. Immunohistochemically positive bacterial
   clumps were detected exclusively in vessel lumen in all examined organs,
   including brain, and V. anguillarum was reisolated in pure culture from
   all organs, particularly from the kidney. Blood analysis showed
   erythropenia and leukopenia with granulocytosis in mice, platelet
   reduction and leukopenia with lymphocytosis in guinea pigs.},

Abstract = {We used the duplicate portion method to measure the daily dietary intake
   of total and congener-specific polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and to
   assess their potential toxicity in a group of 20 subjects consuming a
   typical Italian diet.
   The mean+/-SD intake of total PCB, measured by GC-MS, was 3.72+/-1.51 mu
   g/person/day, comparable to values reported in similar studies
   world-wide, with individual intakes varying within one order of
   magnitude, from 0.97 to 10.59 mu g/person/day. The di-ortho congeners
   153, 18 and 138 were the PCB found in the highest concentrations
   (respectively 13.8\%, 11.4\% and 10.9\% of the total) while the
   non-ortho coplanar congeners (77, 126 and 169) amounted to 0.5\% of the
   total.
   The corresponding levels of toxicity (TCDD-like TEQ values ascribable to
   PCB) ranged from 4.6 up to 119 pg/person/day of TCDD-equivalents in 18
   subjects, i.e. presumed no-risk levels, but with peaks of 2109 and 4553
   pg/person/day in two subjects with significant intakes of the congener
   126.
   wprincipal components analysis and redundancy analysis showed dairy
   products, meat and fish were the principal sources of PCB, and
   vegetables those with the highest toxicity index in the Italian diet.

Abstract = {The Eighth Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade fed to
   the creation of the World Trade Organization and to the adoption of the
   Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement, thus considerably changing
   the rules of international trade in animals and animal products. Animal
   health measures may result in trade restrictions, but governments accept
   that these restrictions may sometimes be necessary and appropriate to
   ensure food safety and animal health protection. The SPS Agreement
   acknowledges the rights of governments to adopt measures to protect
   human, animal and plant health.
   To ensure effective animal health protection, without unjustifiable
   discrimination, the operational procedures of Veterinary Services must
   be standardised, especially those concerning disease notification,
   epidemiological information, certification for international trade and
   management of animal health emergencies. Veterinary Services must be
   further supported by a proper legislative framework and adequate

Volume = {124},

Abstract = {This study assessed the accuracy of 16 commercial and three
   self-produced kits and drew the basis for using an external quality
   control (EQC) system. The commercial kits were mainly developed for
   blood sex steroid determination in humans but also have been used in
   cattle. Parallelism, recovery and precision tests were performed for
   progesterone (P-4), testosterone (T) and oestradiol (E-2) assays.
   Moreover, anonymous QC samples were sent to be analysed to some Italian
   laboratories, All kits showed a fair degree of parallelism (P < 0.01),
   even though 2/7 kits for T and 1/6 kits for E-2 determination showed a
   regression coefficient (r(2)) lower than 0.98. For Pq, an acceptable
   range of accuracy was achieved in the recovery test only by 1/6 kits;
   two kits showed fair or great overestimation and two kits considerable
   underestimation. For T, an acceptable range of accuracy was achieved
   only by 1/7 kits. For E-2, 4/6 kits presented a variable degree of
   underestimation and two kits showed great overestimation. Ln the
   intra-assay precision test quite good repeatability was achieved only
   using samples with high hormone concentrations. While assaying samples
   with low concentrations we found a number of RSD > 10\%. Moreover, the
   laboratories participating in the EQC produced statistically different
   (P < 0.05) results, particularly for high and medium concentrations. In
   conclusion, the use of commercial kits for screening naturally occurring
   sex steroid concentrations in cattle blood, in the case of suspected
   illegal treatments, requires preventive validation procedures and the
   development of an opportune EQC system.},

Abstract = {Equine arteritis viruses (EAV) from Europe and America were compared by
   phylogenetic analysis of 43 isolates obtained over four decades. An
   additional 22 virus sequences were retrieved from GenBank. Fragments of
   the glycoprotein G(L) and the replicase genes were amplified by RT-PCR,
   prior to sequencing and construction of phylogenetic trees. The trees
   revealed many distinctive lineages, consistent with prolonged
   diversification within geographically separated host populations. Two
   large groups and five subgroups were distinguished. Group I consisted
   mainly of viruses from North America, whilst group II consisted mainly
   of European isolates. In most instances, where the geographic origin of
   the viruses appeared to be at variance with the phylogenetically
   predicted relationships, the horses from which the viruses were
   recovered had been transported between Europe and America or vice versa,
   Analysis of the replicase gene revealed similar phylogenetic
   relationships although not all of the groups were as clearly defined.
   Virus strains CH 1 (Switzerland, 1964) and S1 (Sweden, 1989) represented
   separate `outgroups' based on analysis of both genomic regions. The
   results of this study confirm the value of the G(L) gene of EAV for
   estimating virus genetic diversity and as a useful tool for tracing
   routes by which EAV is spread. In addition, computer-assisted
   predictions of antigenic sites on the G(L) protein revealed considerable
   variability among the isolates, especially with respect to regions
   associated with neutralization domains.},

Abstract = {A colorimetric polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for the detection of
   Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC (MmmSC), the cause of contagious
   bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), was used to lest clinical samples from
   suspect and known cases of the disease. A commercially available
   detection kit, pleuroTRAP from AMRAD, Australia, which captures
   amplified double stranded DNA in the wells of a microtitre plate was
   used. Tissues tested from animals ranging from a variety of anatomical
   locations included lung, lymph node, kidney, spleen, pleural fluid and
   nasal swabs. Polymerase chain reaction was conducted on DNA extracted
   from tissues as well as on culture-derived mycoplasmas. Positive results
   could be seen by the development of a yellow colour in microtitre wells
   after the enzymatic detection procedure indicating the presence of
   specifically amplified products. Spectrophotometric values of OD450 for
   positive samples ranged from 0.211 to 1.409 compared to negative values
   of around 0.020 which reduced the subjectivity in the interpretation of
   results. MmmSC was successfully identified from cultures of reference
   and field strains, nasal swabs and excised tissue by amplification with
   primers supplied in the kit. The system is suitable for automation and
   may be a cost effective alternative to gel electrophoresis for the
   screening of moderately large sample numbers as is the case in
   surveillance programmes. (C) 1999 Academic Press.},

Abstract = {An epidemiological survey was carried out on the distribution of canine
   leishmaniosis in Western Liguria (Northern Italy). Blood sera from 21146
   dogs collected from 1990 to 1996 were subjected to the indirect
   immunofluorescence test (IFAT). From 1990 to 1994 (16690 dogs), only
   monthly seroprevalences were calculated (min 14\%-max 60.5\%). Dog sera
   sampled from October 1994 to May 1996 (4456 dogs) were divided into two
   subgroups (I: October 1994-May 1995; II: October 1995-May 1996).
   Seroprevalence was 30.3\% and 22.1\% in these two groups, respectively.
   Data analysis by log-linear models revealed that serological positivity
   to Leishmania sp. was significantly associated with a dog's outdoor
   lifestyle, with a rural environment and with the male sex. Of the 218
   dogs which were tested twice seroconversion rates were also higher in
   outdoor, rural and male dogs while negativization rates were lower in
   the same groups. Basic reproductive numbers (R-0) were 1.53 (subgroup I)
   and 1.28 (subgroup II). (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Chaperonin 10 of M. tuberculosis conferred partial or total protection
   against generalized foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in guinea-pigs
   challenged with O-1 Lausanne FMD virus. Chaperonin 10-immunized animals
   mounted an antibody response to the protein, one epitope of which was
   found in the C-terminal half. A similar recognition pattern was observed
   in FMD-convalescent guineapigs, swine and cattle. Anti-chaperonin 10
   sera showed antiviral activity against FMDV-infected BHK-21 cells. There
   was strong evidence that early after infection these cells actively
   secrete their histones and that antisera to the chaperonin recognize
   them. The same antisera reacted with purified histones in
   immunoblotting. Most important, exogenously added histones abrogated the
   anti-viral activity of the antiserum and an anti-histone monoclonal
   antibody had strong antiviral activity against FMDV-infected BHK-21
   cells. These results are consistent with previous reports on
   displacement of histones from the nuclear compartment and immune
   recognition of self-histones after viral infections. On the whole, they
   indicate that M. tuberculosis chaperonin 10 enables the immune system to
   react against early abnormalities of virus-infected cells; this is
   accomplished by antibody cross-reacting with histones released during
   virus infection.},

Abstract = {To investigate its pathogenicity, a strain of S. haemolyticus from field
   cases was inoculated into the mammary gland of 10 lactating ewes. The
   experiment lasted from the day of infection to the third month after the
   subsequent lambing. Milk samples were periodically taken from all the
   ewes to ascertain the somatic cell count, the rate of fat, proteins and
   lactose. The same samples were cultured. The ewes were clinically
   examined and the quantity of milk produced was measured. Tissue samples
   were obtained to study the sequential histopathological features of the
   infection. All the infected mammary glands showed clear evidence of
   clinical mastitis 16 hours after inoculation and there were significant
   changes in the rates of fat, proteins and lactose when compared with the
   controls. The inoculated mammary glands produced less milk than did the
   controls. S. haemolyticus in pure culture was isolated from the mammary
   glands of all inoculated animals. Bacteria was not found in the milk
   samples taken from 2 ewes during pre-lambing lactation and in 2 others
   after lambing, although 3 ewes continued to discharge S. haemolyticus
   throughout the entire experiment. Histologically, in the tissue samples
   obtained from the ewes slaughtered at 3 and 9 days after inoculation,
   there was evidence of intra-alveolar neutrophilic infiltration. In the
   mammary gland of the ewe slaughtered 16 days after inoculation, a mild
   proliferation of fibrous tissue and focal lymphocitic aggregation were
   observed. Chronic inflammatory features dominated in the mammary glands
   of the S. haemolyticus infected ewes. No lesions were found in the S.
   haemolyticus negative ewes.},

Abstract = {A BVD control programme based on the identification and removal of
   persistently infected (PI) animals is being undertaken in an area in the
   Pome province, where BVD outbreaks had been previously detected. It
   involves 174 mainly dairy herds, from which blood samples of all bovines
   older than 1 year are obtained through the national brucellosis and
   leukosis eradication programme. Samples sufficient to detect the
   presence of seropositive animals at a prevalence of 5\% or more are
   initially screened for antibodies against BVD virus (BVDV) using an
   immunoenzymatic assay. Upon identification of seroreagents additional
   blood samples are tested from the 6-12-month age category not included
   in the initial samples. Animals are considered immunotolerant if BVDV is
   demonstrated twice at a minimum 30-day interval. When no seropositive
   animals are detected during the first serological screening the herd is
   declared BVD-free if a second testing, preferably carried on the same
   animals previously tested, confirms the seronegative status of the herd.
   At present 147 farms have been tested, of which 63 (42.9\%) are negative
   with respect to antibodies against BVDV. Of the 84 remaining herds in
   which one or more seropositives are detected, 13 an classified as
   recently infected. In eight of these recently infected herds, 22 PI
   animals have been identified. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   change in the viable population of three EHEC strains for up to 14 d.
   The remaining four strains showed an increase in population from < 2 log
   to 3 log cfu ml(-1) in a time period of between 9 and 17 d. The results
   indicate good survival or even multiplication of E. coli O157:H7 in ram

Abstract = {The aim of this study was the antigenic analysis of Polish SVDV isolates
   from 1972-73. Experiments were performed with three panels of monoclonal
   antibodies (Mabs) raised against Italian SVDV It 73, It 91 and It 92 in
   a trapping ELISA. The results obtained were compared with the reactivity
   patterns of the four Italian viruses used as representatives of each of
   the four antigenic groups (Brocchi et al., Epidemiol. Infect. 118, 51,
   1997). It was found that the Polish SVDV isolates belong to antigenic
   group 2 (viruses present in Europe and Japan between 1972-1981)
   recognised by antibodies of the first panel (Mabs against It 72). It
   suggest the close relation and common origin of Polish isolates and the
   other European ones from the 1970s. The weak reactivity of Mab 1B3 (both
   of panel It 92) confirmed the antigenic differenties of Polish SVDV from
   viruses isolated from outbreaks of SVD occured in Italy in 1991-1992.
   These results can be useful for the epidemiological studies of SVD in
   Europe.},

Abstract = {Concanavalin A (Con A) which binds to glycoproteins in whey and serum of

   anti-trypsin activity. Milk samples were collected from healthy cows and
   from cows with clinical mastitis. Bacteriological testing was done on
   all samples. The Con A test results were statistically correlated with
   anti-trypsin activity in whey and somatic cell count which is considered
   the gold standard to ascertain the health status of the mammary gland.
   Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Escherichia coli
   were isolated from milk samples will a somatic cell count greater than
   or equal to 2,000,000, The Con A test gave negative results in milk
   collected from healthy udders, Con A binding was also determined in sera
   since glycoproteins might have migrated to the milli and given similar
   results on both serum and whey samples.},

   were the complement fixation test (CFT) and bacteriological isolation
   and typing. A total of 33,856 serum samples collected from herds in
   CBPP-free regions were used to define CFT specificity, while samples
   from 595 animals from infected herds were employed to define the
   sensitivity. Ninety-nine animals from three infected herds were used to
   estimate the sensitivity of the isolation technique. Results showed the
   specificity of CFT (threshold +1:10) to be 98\% and sensitivity to be
   63.79\%. The sensitivity of the test did not change significantly,
   regardless of whether the lesions were caused by acute or chronic
   infection. The sensitivity of the isolation technique was 54.1\%.},

Abstract = {alpha(1)-Acid glycoproteins (AAGs) have a structure resembling
   beta-adrenergic receptors and bind several basic drugs in plasma.
   Chromatographic columns were prepared by linking epsilon-NH2 groups of
   AAG lysines to a Sepharose 4B support, in order to purify by affinity
   chromatography adrenergic drugs of possible use in animal production.
   Loading capacities, binding efficiency, memory effects and matrix
   interferences from urine samples were studied. The method developed
   involves sample application in buffered media (pH 7.4), washing with 5
   mi of PBS, and elution with 4 ml of 1\% v/v acetic acid. Under these
   conditions no memory effect was observed. Loading capacity is correlated
   with the physiological plasma binding rate (PB) of the drug. For
   clenbuterol (PB 50\%) and anilino-like related drugs, 5 mg of FLAG were
   able to bind about 15 x 10(-6) g of drug, with a 100\% recovery from the
   column. Repeatability and reproducibility, expressed as RSD, were 4.2
   and 5.4\%, respectively. The calculated AAG:drug molar ratio was 4.5:1,
   indicating 22\% of the AAG bound to the column retained drug affinity.
   Among phenolic-like agonists, salbutamol (PB 5\%), fenoterol and
   isoxsuprine hardly interacted, whereas nylidrin, ritodrine and bamethan
   showed more effective binding. We also checked binding of other drugs of
   possible use in veterinary medicine. Application of the AAG column to
   spiked bovine urine revealed a mean recovery of 97.8\%; no matrix
   interferences were observed.},

Abstract = {We report herein on the first serological detection of antibodies to
   bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) in Italy. According to criteria of a
   stratified-random sampling of dairy cattle reared in the Parma area (a
   province in the Po Valley, Northern Italy), sera from 3166 cows
   belonging to 272 herds were collected. In addition, sera of 138 bulls
   from eight artificial-insemination (AI) centres were sampled.
   Seventy-eight cows (2.5\%) from 16 herds (5.8\%) and seven bulls (5.1\%)
   from two AI centres were positive for BIV-R29 antibodies in the
   IFA-test. IFA-positive, sera assayed by Western blot had reaction to
   different viral proteins: 81 out of 85 sera showed antibody to p26
   (considered the BIV major internal core protein); four sera reacted to
   other viral proteins but not to p26. Peripheral blood leukocytes of 60
   seropositive and 60 seronegative animals, belonging to eight
   BIV-infected herds, were enumerated to assess any effect of BIV
   infection on white-blood cells. No significant differences were detected
   between the two groups. These data indicate that BIV infection is
   present in Italian dairy cattle - but the role of BIV in inducing
   disease remains unclear. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Title = {Dexamethasone and clenbuterol detection by enzyme immunoassay in bovine

Abstract = {A fast and simple extraction procedure was developed for simultaneous
   determination in bovine liver of two veterinary dress, widely used as
   growth promoters in meat production: dexamethasone (a synthetic
   corticosteroid drug) and clenbuterol (a beta(2)-adrenergic agonist
   drug). Liver samples were extracted by acetonitrile, without any
   clean-up step. Two different ELISAs, specific for the two classes of
   drugs, were used to determine the residue concentration in the extracts.
   The intra- and inter-extraction variability was determined at different
   concentrations: the intra-extraction coefficients of variation (CT's)
   were between 2.5 and 17.7\% for dexamethasone and between 0.9 and 9.8\%
   for clenbuterol; the inter-extraction CVs were between 2.0 and 16.8\%
   for dexamethasone and between 0.5 and 10.8\% for clenbuterol. Recovery
   ranged from 92 to 154\% for dexamethasone and from 78 to 105\% for
   clenbuterol. The limit of detection was 1.43 ng g(-1) and 0.43 ng g(-1)
   respectively. The limit of quantification for dexamethasone was 2.09 ng
   g(-1) and for clenbuterol was 0.72 ng g(-1). The combination of the new
   extraction procedure with an ELISA detection permitted the rapid semi
   quantitative determination of both dexamethasone at its maximum residue
   level (MRL: 2.5 ng g(-1) in liver tissue), and clenbuterol at low
   concentration level.},

Abstract = {Streptococcosis caused by Lactococcus garvieae is currently the
   bacterial disease causing the highest mortality in Italian rainbow trout
   farming. Since 1991, when it first appeared, the disease continued to
   spread, mainly in the northern regions. In the worst cases, mortality
   reached nearly 50\%; the outbreaks occur during the summer, when the
   water temperatures are higher than 15 degrees C. Chances to effectively
   control the disease are very limited because of the lack of useful and
   legally approved drugs. Fish suffering the disease are usually close to
   market size and farmers are unable to treat the disease unless they risk
   considerably delaying marketing in order to comply with withdrawal
   periods. Therefore, it becomes increasingly important to develop
   vaccination programmes. In the present study, two normally reared groups
   of rainbow trout were vaccinated by intraperitoneal injection with a
   formalin-killed vaccine. The first trial was conducted between May and
   October with fish weighing at mean 1.360 kg. The mortality in the
   vaccinated group was reduced to 16.7\% compared with 40.4\% in the
   control group. Moreover, the unvaccinated group had to be treated five
   times with antibiotics. The second trial was carried out between April
   and September with fish weighing on average 6.370 kg. A certain degree
   of resistance against the disease was noticed in the vaccinated group
   (mortality 18.6\%).},

Abstract = {The metabolic fate of 19-nortestosterone laurate in cattle was
   investigated to evaluate target analyte(s) appropriate to surveillance
   for illicit use as a growth promoting agent. Bovine hepatocytes were
   incubated with either {[}H-3] 19-nortestosterone laurate (19-NTL;
   4-estren-17 beta-laurate-3-one) or {[}H-3] 19-nortestosterone (19-NT;
   4-estren-17 beta-ol-3-one; nandrolone). Hepatocyte medium was extracted
   with solid phase Clx media and analysed by narrow bore radio-HPLC-MSn
   (LCQ, Finnigan) to evaluate the structure of metabolites of 19-NTL and
   19-NT. Radio-HPLC of hepatocyte medium extracts following incubation
   with {[}3H]19-NTL confirmed that the first step of biotransformation in
   liver was hydrolysis of the fatty acid ester to release {[}3H]19-NT,
   which, in turn, was converted into a range of metabolites of diverse
   polarity. Hydrolysis of hepatocyte medium extracts with P-glucuronidase
   (Helix pomatia) indicated that some of these metabolites were
   glucuronide or sulfate conjugates. Structural analysis of unconjugated
   metabolities by positive-ion atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation
   MS2 and comparison with available reference preparations indicated
   biotransformation of 19-NT to 4-estren-17 alpha-ol-3-one,
   4-estren-3,17-dione (major metabolite after 1 h), n-hydroxy-4-estren-3,
   17-dione, n-hydroxy-4-estren-17-ol-3-one, beta-estran-3 alpha-ol-17-one
   (noretiocholanolone) and 5 beta-estran-3 alpha,17 beta-ol(major
   metabolite after 4 h). Conjugated metabolites were analysed by
   electrospray ionization, which revealed the presence of glucuronide
   conjugates of alpha-(trace) and P-epimers of 19-NT,
   n-hydroxy-4-estren-3, 17-dione, n-hydroxy-4-estren-17-ol-3-one and 5
   beta-estran-3 alpha,17 beta-diol. These studies provide a clear
   indication of the route of hepatic metabolism in the bovine, which may
   now be readily substantiated by reference to samples, such as urine or
   bile, derived from animals treated with unlabelled 19-NTL.},

Abstract = {During in vitro cultivation of bacteria, the pathogenetic factors may
   change in amount and quality. Knowledge of this variability is important
   in vaccine production. The pathogenic variability of Pasteurella
   piscicida broth culture (BC), extracellular products (ECPs) and whole
   cells (WC) was investigated in sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) 2-3 g wet
   weight, inoculated intraperitoneally. Ten Pasteurella piscicida field
   strains isolated from fish affected by different outbreaks which
   occurred in Italian fish farms were used. When BC and ECPs were
   intraperitoneally injected, no variability in virulence was observed
   between strains of different geographical origin and no attenuation was
   registered between strains of different in vitro passages. The
   electrophoretic (SDS-PAGE) analysis of ECP showed evidence of only
   quantitative differences inside the panel of strains and between the
   same strain collected at different in vitro cultivation times. ECPs
   produced from a BC incubated for 18-60 h were highly toxic. This ability
   was heat labile and not active when ECPs were administered by immersion.
   No toxic capacity was observed with WC where infection was greater with
   a 18-60 h incubation broth culture. Results seems to indicate that the
   toxic activity of Pasteurella piscicida is mostly due to ECP and not
   bounded to the cell.},

Abstract = {The broad-host range of conjugal transfer and the chromosomal location
   make conjugative transposons (CT) attractive candidates as tools for
   genetic manipulation of a large variety of bacteria. In this paper we
   describe insertion vectors capable of integrating into Tn916, the
   prototype of CT in Gram-positive bacteria. The integration of vectors
   into a single chromosomal copy of Tn916 was studied both after natural
   transformation of Bacillus subtilis, and after electroporation in
   Enterococcus faecalis. Integration occurred either by double or by
   single crossover, and the integrated DNA segment was shown to be highly
   stable. All recombinant CT (rCT) were still able to excise from the
   chromosome to form circular intermediates, the first step of both
   transposition and conjugal transfer. All classes of rCT generated by
   insertion vector pSMB47 were capable of conjugal transfer, while using
   pVMB11 it was possible to generate non-conjugative rCT. (C) 1998

Abstract = {Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is a noncultivable calicivirus
   that infects rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and causes epidemics of an
   acute fatal hepatitis. In 1997 we identified two RHDV isolates from
   geographically distant Italian regions, which differed antigenically
   from the reference strain RHDV.Bs89. In fact, they were not reactive
   with mAb 1H8, that is able to protect rabbits from RHD and showed a low
   reactivity with the rabbit convalescent serum raised against RHDV.Bs89.
   Experimental infection of rabbits with either RHDV isolates confirmed
   their high pathogenicity and their peculiar antigenic profile;
   nevertheless, rabbits vaccinated with the current vaccine were protected
   against challenge infection with these isolates. Sequence comparison
   definitely demonstrated that the two isolates originated from the same
   RHDV variant and that the similarity of their structural protein (VP60)
   sequences with the RHDV.Bs89 is equal to 93\%. This variant was named
   RHDVa since shows consistent genetic and antigenic differences from the
   wild-type RHDV. In particular, 44\% of amino acid substitutions in RHDVa
   VP60 were located between amino acids 344 and 370, where the similarity
   with RHDV.Bs89 drops to 70\%, suggesting that this region probably
   contains the epitope recognized by mAb 1H8. In addition: this paper
   presents preliminary data concerning the amino acids of VP60 involved in
   the hemagglutination site of the virus. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {1. Clenbuterol (CBL) and bromobuterol (BBL) were both extensively
   metabolized by hepatic microsomes of swine to only one polar metabolite
   which was separated by hplc and purified to perform mass analysis.
   2. LC-MS analysis by direct infusion into an ion trap system and after
   reverse-phase chromatograpy into a triple quadrupole system showed that
   the metabolites were the hydroxylamine-derivatives of CBL and BBL. GC-MS
   analysis by the CI and EI modes confirmed that the hydroxyl group was
   bound to the aniline nitrogen. The chemical instability of those
   metabolites probably as a consequence of spontaneous oxidation and
   reduction gave rise during the analysis to the corresponding nitroso and
   nitro derivatives, together with the original compound.
   3. Thermal inactivation and CO complex formation were used selectively
   to inactivate Ravin monooxygenase and cytochrome P450, respectively.
   Both inactivation procedures significantly reduced the formation of the
   hydroxyl metabolite.},

Abstract = {Sixteen 20 day old pigs, devoid of neutralizing antibody to pseudorabies
   virus (PRV), were divided into two groups of eight, and the animals of
   each group were housed in a separate unit. In each group 6 pigs were
   inoculated intranasally with the thymidine kinase (TK-) mutant (Group 1)
   or the field strain of PRV (Group 2), each pig receiving an inoculum of
   4 ml, The remaining 2 pigs in each group served as uninoculated
   controls, The only clinical sign observed in the pigs of Group 1 was a
   transient febrile reaction, in the case of six pigs inoculated with the
   TK- mutant of PRV, whereas no signs of disease were seen in the
   uninoculated controls. The virus was isolated from the 6 infected pigs
   of the group only on post infection day (PID) 2, whereas it was never
   isolated from the controls. By contrast, the pigs of Group 2, had a
   severe clinical response and one, among those that were inoculated with
   the held strain of the PRV, died on PID 9, Virus was consistently
   isolated from all pigs of Group 2, inoculated and control. On PID 30 all
   pigs, i,e. the 8 of Group 1 and 7 of the Group 2 which survived to the
   infection, were subjected to dexamethasone (DMS) treatment. After DMS
   treatment virus was never isolated from the nasal swabbings obtained
   from the pigs of Group 1, whereas it was consistently isolated from pigs
   of Group 2, After 30 d from the start of DMS treatment the pigs were
   killed and several tissues were collected from each pig for virus
   detection, by isolation in tissue culture and by PCR analysis. At
   necropsy no lesions were found in pigs of Group i, whereas acute
   pneumonia and gliosis in the trigeminal ganglia were observed in pigs of
   Group 2, Virus was never isolated from any of the tissues taken from
   pigs of both, Group 1 and Group 2, nevertheless sequences of PRV were
   detected by PCR analysis in the trigeminal ganglia of the pigs of both
   Groups. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The present work deals with the discovery of a distinctive morphology in
   the male reproductive apparatus of the red swamp crayfish, Procambarus
   clarkii (Girard, 1852), from two Italian lakes (where it was introduced
   a few years ago from different foreign countries). Anatomy and histology
   of the male reproductive apparatus were investigated in a large sample
   of the crayfish populations. Males were characterized by the presence of
   a tri-lobate testis and, as a rule, of a single sperm duct ton the right
   body side). Furthermore, a comparison of the same anatomical structures
   was made taking into consideration two other crayfish secies: Astacus
   leptodactylus and Orconectes limosus. Observations on these crustaceans
   showed a bi-lobate testis and no morphological differences between the
   normally developed left and right vasa deferentia. The presence of a
   single sperm duct and of three testicular lobes in P. clarkii might be
   related to its burrowing-reproductive habit. One single vas deferens may
   be an adaptation to burrow environments where copulation is not affected
   by water flow, while three testicular lobes may act as a mechanism to
   make the spermatogenetic process active all year round, thus enhancing
   the probabilities of success in reproduction.},

   analyze foods is based on colture isolation and identification of the
   microorganism.
   However, in the last years, some methods based on polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) have been developed to amplify specific DNA Fragments
   from pathogenic microorganisms. Herein, we report a comparative study
   between a PCR based method and the microbiological official procedure
   For detection of Salmonella spp. in meat products; we carried out a

   1996, 9 susceptible young ostriches were infected subcutaneously with
   the virus in order to study the nature of the infection which they
   undergo. The ostriches developed viraemia which was demonstrable on days
   1-4 following infection, with a maximum intensity of 4.0 log(10) mouse
   intracerebral LD50/ml being recorded on day 2 in 1 of the birds. Virus
   was detectable in visceral organs such as spleen, liver and kidney up to
   day 5 post-inoculation, 1 day after it could no longer be found in
   blood. No infective virus was detected in samples of muscle, but viral
   nucleic acid was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain
   reaction in muscle from a bird sacrificed on day 3 following infection.
   It was concluded that the occurrence of infection in ostriches at
   abattoirs could be prevented by keeping the birds free of ticks for 14
   days before slaughter.},

Abstract = {A total of 208 strains of Aeromonas were isolated by monthly sampling
   from two estuaries (one provided with, and the other devoid of a
   waste-water treatment system) on the Italian coast of the Adriatic sea
   between September 1994 and August 1995. Biotyping at the species level
   allowed the identification of 96 strains (46\%) as Aer. caviae, 46
   (22\%) as Aer. sobria, 33 (16\%) as Aer. hydrophila and 25 (12\%) as
   Aer. veronii. Eight strains (4\%) were regarded as unnamed aeromonads.
   Aeromonas caviae was the most prevalent species in water with a high
   degree of pollution, while Aer. hydrophila strains were more commonly
   isolated from cleaner water. Aeromonas sobria and Aer. veronii were
   equally distributed in both estuaries. There was no correlation between
   temperature and numbers of aeromonads in either estuary. Using a
   biochemical fingerprinting method, strains were divided into similarity
   groups (PhP-types) based on their biochemical phenotypes. Several
   different PhP-types were found in each estuary, yielding a high
   diversity for these strains. However, some identical PhP-types were also
   found in both estuaries and at different times of the year, indicating
   that certain Aeromonas strains can survive more widely varying
   physico-chemical conditions. The production of toxins capable of causing
   cytoskeletal-dependent changes in the morphology of Chinese hamster
   ovary (CHO) cells was detected in 14 strains and appeared to be
   dependent on the season.},

Abstract = {Partial nucleotide sequences of encephalomyocarditis (EMC) viruses
   isolated from five, apparently independent, outbreaks of fatal
   myocarditis in pigs in Italy were compared with three EMC viruses
   isolated from wild rodents from a different geographic region in the
   same country. These viruses were also compared with EMC viruses isolated
   from pigs in other European countries and three historical strains. All
   the Italian EMC viruses were closely related ( > 94.6\% nucleotide
   identity), but were distinct from viruses occurring in Belgium in 1991
   (< 80.5\% nucleotide identity), Greece in 1990 (< 83.3\% nucleotide
   identity) and the three older viruses (< 82.9\% nucleotide identity). An
   EMC virus isolated from pigs in the Netherlands in 1988, was closely
   related to the Italian Viruses (95.3-99.3\% nucleotide identity). It is
   suggested that pigs may play a role in the movement of EMC viruses
   between different geographic regions. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {Wide heterogeneity was shown among different batches of bovine protein
   purified derivative (PPD) tuberculin, as regards protein content and
   antigenic profile. These features were also investigated in pilot
   preparations of Mycobacterium bovis secreted antigens and PPD
   tuberculins. Under controlled conditions, widely different compositions
   were revealed as a function of the M. bovis strain and also of the time
   in culture, due to the transient expression of seemingly important
   clusters of antigens. Furthermore, these parameters could dramatically
   affect the efficacy of the above preparations in in vitro assays of
   cell-mediated immunity on M, bovis-infected cattle. The field exposure
   to mycobacteria of the avium/intracellular group could also influence
   the readout or such assays, results being in agreement with a bystander
   suppression model of the response to M. bovis antigens. Due to the
   above, practical suggestions are put forward to improve the composition
   of bovine PPD tuberculins and the relevant control procedures. (C) 1998

Journal = {VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {1998},

Abstract = {The protein and antigen profiles of 60 isolates, strains and the type
   strain PG1 of Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC were compared by
   sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
   immunoblot analysis. Analysis using contagious bovine pleuropneumonia
   antisera and hyperimmune rabbit sera against several representative
   strains revealed some differences in protein profiles and variability in
   antigens among strains from different geographic regions. The most
   common antigenic bands had the molecular masses of 110, 95, 80, 69, 62,
   60, 48, 44, 39 and 38 kDa. There were differences among European
   strains, where a larger group coming from Italy lacked the p98 antigen,
   thus, with one exception, distinguishing the Italian strains from
   Portuguese, French and Spanish strains. African, Australian and PG1
   strains showed heterogenic profiles, with quantitative differences and
   in a few strains some antigenic bands were absent. The group
   constituting African, Australian and PG1 strains was characterised by
   the presence of 71.5/ 70 kDa antigens, which were not detected in
   European strains. Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC membrane
   proteins were characterised by Triton X-114 partitioning and p110, p98,
   p95, p62/60 and p48 were identified as immunogenic antigens. The
   simultaneous presence of these five antigens was common to all the sera
   examined and, therefore, indicates the diagnostic potential of
   immunoblotting. Most immunodominant antigens are surface-exposed
   proteins as determined by the trypsin treatment. Crown Copyright (C)

   was performed directly on the DNA extracted from epidermal swabs. The
   PCR primers were chosen to match the 16S rDNA sequence fragments which
   differ most from the other Corynebacterium spp. The test was shown to be
   both sensitive and specific for C. bovis Detection of as few as three

Abstract = {A fatal pneumonia due to Legionella pneumophila was diagnosed in a young
   calf reared in a daily herd located in northern Italy. Clinical symptoms
   consisted of watery diarrhea, hyperthermia, anorexia, and severe
   dyspnea, The pathological and histological findings were very similar to
   those observed in human legionellosis, Legionella pneumophila serogroup
   1 (SG1) and SG10 were isolated from the calfs lung, and L. pneumophila
   SG1 was isolated from the calfs liver. L. pneumophila SG1 was also
   demonstrated in the lung tissue by immunofluorescence and
   immunohistochemical examinations, Nine of 10 L. pneumophila SG1 isolates
   belonged to the Olda subtype, and 1 belonged to the Camperdown subtype.
   A very low prevalence of antibodies to Legionella was detected in cows
   and calves reared in the same herd. Cultures of aqueous sediment of an
   old electric water heater which supplied hot water for the feeding of
   the calves yielded L. pneumophila SG1, Four of the colonies tested
   belonged to the Olda subtype. Ten clinical and four environmental
   isolates were examined for the presence of plasmids, Nine of them were
   also examined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis assay, and the same
   patterns were found for L. pneumophila SG1 Olda strains isolated from
   the calf and from the electric heater. This is the first report of a
   documented case of a naturally occurring Legionella pneumonia in an
   animal. Cattle probably act as accidental hosts for legionellae, much
   the same as humans.},

Abstract = {A method for distinguishing fresh from thawed frozen samples of porcine
   and bovine meat is proposed.Crude soluble extracts from fresh (stored at
   +4 degrees C for 0-3 days) or deep frozen (at -80 degrees C) meat
   samples from pork and beef, were assayed by blocking ELISA to estimate
   m-MDH (mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase) titres. As a rule, a separate
   aliquot of each test sample was placed at -20 degrees C until frozen and
   subsequently thawed for the preparation of the extract whose analysis
   gave the `self reference' m-MDH titre. For a given meat sample
   calculation of the tau index, `tau', was proposed as the ratio between
   the self reference value and the original m-MDH titre. The 95\%
   tolerance for tau for fresh and thawed meat, suggests that the method is
   suitable for this kind of analysis. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {Hyperkeratosis-associated coryneform (HAC) is a coryneform bacterium,
   with a biochemical profile similar to Corynebacterium bovis, that causes
   hyperkeratotic dermatitis in athymic nude mice. In the present study 28
   severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice coming from six different
   animal facilities were submitted for bacteriological and pathological
   examination. HAC was isolated from 10 SCID mice belonging to two of
   these facilities. Two of the MAC-infected mice showed macroscopical
   lesions consisting in large alopecic areas, with small white flakes,
   involving the dorsum, flanks, neck and cheeks. Histologically, the skin
   of these animals was characterized by diffuse acanthosis and
   hyperkeratosis. In the other eight MAC-infected SCID mice no
   macroscopical lesions were observed but focal areas of minimal to mild
   acanthosis were histologically detected in five cases. These results
   suggest that HAC can infect SCID mice inducing skin lesions similar,
   although generally less severe, to those observed in nude mice with
   hyperkeratotic dermatitis. Our results pointed out that SCID mice may
   play an important role in the epidemiology of hyperkeratotic dermatitis
   of athymic nude mice.},

Abstract = {Temporal patterns and spatial distribution of African swine fever (ASF)
   were studied through the analysis of routinely collected data in the
   ASF-endemic area of the Province of Nuoro, Sardinia. During 1993-1996,
   ASF outbreaks were reported from 45 out of the 82 municipalities of the
   study area. Overall farm-level incidence rate (IR) was 1.3 outbreaks per
   100 farms-year. ASF peaked in 1995 (IR=1.8) and declined in 1996
   (IR=0.82). Significant (P<0.05) spring peaks of ASF outbreaks and
   affected municipalities were detected using statistical methods for
   circular distributions. Spatial clustering of ASF-affected
   municipalities, as evaluated by join-count statistics, was significant
   in 1993 (Z(jc) = -3.0, P<0.01) and 1994 (Z(jc) = -3.2, P<0.01) but not
   in 1995 (Z(jc) = -0.6, P=0.55) and 1996 (Z(jc) = -1.2, P=0.23).
   Extensive pig farming and ASF were spatially co-distributed (kappa =
   0.51, 95\% CI=0.33-0.70). (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Abstract = {An in-situ hybridisation (ISH) technique for the detection of rabbit
   haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) was developed. Thirteen seronegative
   adult rabbits were infected ore-nasally using the BS89 RHDV strain.
   Liver and spleen samples were collected from 4 h post infection (p.i.)
   and repeated every 4 h till 44 h p.i. Each sample was tested
   immunohistochemically, by sandwich ELISA and by ISH. A 2.482-kb RNA
   probe, matching the genomic fragment coding for the VP60 structural
   protein of RHDV, was arranged. Two RNA probes (sense and antisense) were
   transcribed in vitro and UTP-digoxigenin-labelled. The antisense probe
   clearly detected positivity in the cytoplasm of the hepatocytes at 8 h
   p.i. Labelled hepatocytes were scattered throughout the sections until
   24 h p.i. followed by a more diffuse perilobular positive reaction. A
   much weaker signal of similar distribution was detected up to 24 h p.i.
   using the sense RNA probe. All spleen samples tested negative for both
   probes. Liver samples were positive at 32 h p.i. using both ELISA and
   the immunoperoxidase test. Spleen samples were positive using only the
   ELISA at 32 h p,i. This study showed that RHDV replication occurred
   almost immediately after inoculation and that the liver appears to be
   the main site of replication. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {A comparative study between selective agar media now employed for
   Listeria monocytogenes detection and a new culture agar medium, ALOA,
   which is differential for the pathogenic species, has been conducted on
   164 samples of animal origin food.
   The high performance of this medium has been demonstrated by a +14.7\%
   of positive samples found, compared to the results obtained with Oxford,
   due to the characteristic morphology of Listeria monocytogenes colonies
   in ALOA. The presence of an opaque halo surrounding the colonies
   (phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C production) allows to
   individuate presumed Listeria monocytogenes colonies also in a mixed
   population. No case of False positive identification for Listeria
   monocytogenes has been found by the biochemical identification of the
   colonies surrounded by an opaque halo; the only case of False positive
   reported is due by Enterococcus faecalis for Listeria spp. (colonies
   without halo). The use of the arilamidase test in paper disks
   (Monocytogenes ID Discs) instead of miniaturised multitest kits, has
   demonstrated to be valid enough to confirm Listeria monocytogenes
   presence from the other species, in a simple and quicker way.},

Abstract = {beta(2)-adrenergic agonists, particularly clenbuterol, are illegally
   used as growth promoters to obtain lean in meat. Their administration in
   feedlots can constitute a severe risk for animal welfare and exposes
   consumers to involuntary drug consumption at pharmacological active
   concentrations. Reported poisoning episodes have been associated with
   the consumption of beef liver where clenbuterol residues concentrate. In
   August 1996, 62 persons asked for medical help at the emergency rooms of
   2 hospitals near the city of Caserta (Italy). Their clinical profile was
   characteristic of previously occurring clenbuterol intoxication, which
   reported superventricular extrasystoles and atrial fibrillation. All
   patients had non-liver beef meat consumption 10-30 min to 2-3 h before
   symptoms developed. An ELISA screening test specific for clenbuterol
   confirmed the drug's presence. Definitive confirmation of clenbuterol
   and determination of the drug content in meat samples were obtained by
   GC-MS, using 2 different derivatization. Concentrations in the meats
   ranged from 0.8 to 7.4 mg/kg. These analytical data provided evidence of
   the seriousness of the poisoning and helped the National Health System
   identify other possible misinterpreted cases. This case demonstrates
   that clenbuterol poisoning can also occur after consumption of beef meat
   other than liver.},

   immunoassays measuring antibodies to non-structural proteins of FMDV to
   differentiate infection from vaccination.
   Of the three non-structural proteins 2C, 3C and 3ABC evaluated in this
   study, the polypeptide 3ABC was the most immunogenic, Three ELISAs for
   the detection of antibodies to 3ABC were developed. Two assays rely on
   the competition of test sera against either a anti-3A Mab or against
   antisera to 3ABC raised in rabbits and guinea-pigs, The third, 3ABC
   Mat-ELISA, based on the direct binding of antibodies to the 3ABC trapped
   by a specific Mab, provided the best combination of specificity and
   sensitivity. The 3ABC Mat-ELISA was extensively validated for cattle,
   either in experimental and in field conditions, showing specificity of
   99\% in vaccinated and in naive cattle and the capacity to detect silent
   infections in FMD-vaccinated populations,
   The test showed similar specificity and sensitivity in experimentally
   vaccinated and infected sheep.},

Abstract = {The results of an investigation carried out over a period of two years
   (1996- 1997) in order to detect Salmonella bacteria in Food of animal
   origin are here reported. In all, 1,534 food samples were examined: 790
   fresh pork sausage samples, 252 samples of cattle, pork, sheep and
   chicken chopped meat, 145 minced cattle meat samples, 21 hamburger
   samples, 101 egg samples, and, finally, 225 mozzarella cheese samples.
   Salmonella bacteria were detected in 67 samples (4.3\%); the most
   frequently contaminated foods were the following: Fresh pork sausages
   (6.8\%), minced cattle meat (4.1\%), chopped meat (1.5\%), eggs (0.9\%),
   and, finally, mozzarella cheese (0.4\%).
   In the present study, 67 Salmonella strains have been isolated and 57 of
   them were also identified. In decreasing order, the most: frequently
   detected serotypes are: S. typhimurium (20.6\%), S. livingstone and S.
   derby(l2\%), S. london (6.8\%), S. bredeney and S. mensten (5.1\%), and,
   finally, S. infantis, anatum, virchow and bovis-morbificans (3.4\%). In
   general, over the whole period of investigation, there were no
   significant variations in the frequency of isolation, except for a
   considerable increase during the months of November and December.},

Abstract = {Detailed parasitological investigations were carried out on the stomach
   and the intestine of a young male Balaenoptera physalus found stranded
   along the east coast of the northern Tyrrhenian Sea. Thousands of
   digeneans were found in both the caecum and the colon. Morphological and
   morphometric studies were carried out on these parasites, which were
   identified as Ogmogaster antarcticus Johnston, 1931. In contrast to the
   other species of the genus, O. antarcticus has a large geographical
   distribution and it is not specific to its definitive hosts. This is the
   first record of O. antarcticus from B. physalus in the Mediterranean
   Sea, a finding which helps confirm the world-wide distribution of this
   parasite.},

Abstract = {The association of bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1) with oocytes and in
   vitro fertilized (IVF) embryos after treatment with a mixture of three
   BHV-1 monoclonal antibodies (AB) and guinea pig complement (GPC) was
   investigated in a series of three experiments. Exposure of
   cumulus-oocyte complexes (COC) to BHV-1 (10(5) TCID50/ml) in the
   maturation medium for 22 h followed by treatment with the AB alone or
   with a mixture of AB and GPC prior to fertilization, yielded a total of
   15\% of resulting embryos free of the virus. When the cumulus-free
   oocytes/zygotes were treated with a mixture of AB and GPC after
   fertilization and then co-cultured in the medium containing bovine
   oviductal epithelial cells (BOEC), 88\% of samples containing embryos (n
   = 70) were free of the virus. Application of the same treatment or GPC
   alone followed by the culture of zygotes in the medium without BOEC
   yielded all 40 samples containing 123 embryos free of the infectious
   virus. In addition, the Day-7 embryos exposed to BHV-1 and then treated
   with a mixture of AB and GPC were tested negative. In conclusion, these
   experiments suggest that BHV-1 contamination of zygotes and Day-7 IVF
   embryos may be neutralized by treatment with a mixture of AB and GPC or
   GPC alone. The results also show that it is advantageous to use the IVF
   embryo culture system free of supporting cells in order to increase the
   number of embryos free from the infectious virus.},
