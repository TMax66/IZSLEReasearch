Abstract = {Rabies is a fatal zoonosis caused by a nonsegmented negative-strand RNA
   virus, namely, rabies virus (RABV). Apart from RABV, at least 10
   additional species are known as rabies-related lyssaviruses (RRVs), and
   some of them are responsible for occasional spillovers into humans. More
   lyssaviruses have also been detected recently in different bat
   ecosystems, thanks to the application of molecular diagnostic methods.
   Due to the variety of the members of the genus Lyssavirus, there is the
   necessity to develop a reliable molecular assay for rabies diagnosis
   able to detect and differentiate among the existing rabies and
   rabies-related viruses. In the present study, a pyrosequencing protocol
   targeting the 3' terminus of the nucleoprotein (N) gene was applied for
   the rapid characterization of lyssaviruses. Correct identification of
   species was achieved for each sample tested. Results from the
   pyrosequencing assay were also confirmed by those obtained using the
   Sanger sequencing method. A pan-lyssavirus one-step reverse
   transcription (RT)-PCR was developed within the framework of the
   pyrosequencing procedure. The sensitivity (Se) of the one-step RT-PCR
   assay was determined by using in vitro-transcribed RNA and serial
   dilutions of titrated viruses. The assay demonstrated high analytical
   and relative specificity (Sp) (98.94\%) and sensitivity (99.71\%). To
   date, this is the first case in which pyrosequencing has been applied
   for lyssavirus identification using a cheaper diagnostic approach than
   the one for all the other protocols for rapid typing that we are
   acquainted with. Results from this study indicate that this procedure is
   suitable for lyssavirus detection in samples of both human and animal
   origin.},

Title = {Studies on the presence of natural and synthetic corticosteroids in

Journal = {STEROIDS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {76},
Number = {6},
Pages = {616-625},

Abstract = {Natural and synthetic corticosteroids are widely used in veterinary
   medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties, but are also illegally
   used in animal breeding as growth-promoting agents: this latter
   application in livestock production has been banned within the European
   Union due to health concerns for the consumer.
   In this work urine samples collected from bovines experimentally treated
   with dexamethasone (0.4 mg of dexamethasone 21-disodium phosphate per
   capita/day for 20 consecutive days) and bovines bred under strictly
   controlled conditions were investigated for the presence of natural and
   synthetic corticosteroids, using a simple multi-residue liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method, developed and validated
   in accordance with the criteria of the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC.
   The aim of this work is to investigate the effect of a low dosage and
   long term dexamethasone treatment on the levels of endogenous
   corticosteroids in cattle and to evaluate the possible presence of
   prednisolone residues in bovines bred under strictly controlled
   conditions. Our findings confirm the high and rapid rate of
   dexamethasone urinary excretion. Dexamethasone treatment elicited an
   early reduction of hydrocortisone and cortisone, suggesting the
   disappearance of these two hormones as an indirect indicator of
   corticosteroid treatment in cattle. Prednisolone residues were found
   (concentration interval 0.4-1.4 ng mL(-1)) in urine samples collected
   from control bovines especially at the slaughterhouse, together with
   high levels of hydrocortisone and cortisone. Further studies are
   necessary to find out the reason of unexplained excretion of this
   hormone in urine samples of untreated bovines. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {This paper illustrates and discusses the key issues of the geographical

   Epidemiology of the Veneto region (CREV), defined according to user
   needs, spatial data (availability, accessibility and applicability),
   development, technical aspects, inter-institutional relationships,
   constraints and policies. GeoCREV, the support system for
   decision-making, was designed to integrate geographic information and
   veterinary laboratory data with the main aim to develop a sub-national,
   spatial data infrastructure (SDI) for the veterinary services of the
   Veneto region in north-eastern Italy. Its implementation required (i)
   collection of data and information; (ii) building a geodatabase; and
   (iii) development of a WebGIS application. Tools for the management,
   collection, validation and dissemination of the results (public access
   and limited access) were developed. The modular concept facilitates the
   updating and development of the system according to user needs and data
   availability. The GIS management practices that were followed to develop
   the system are outlined, followed by a detailed discussion of the key
   elements of the GIS implementation process (data model, technical
   aspects, inter-institutional relationship, user dimension and
   institutional framework). Problems encountered in organising the
   non-spatial data and the future work directions are also described.},

Abstract = {Ischemia is the most important factor that affects organ survival during
   harvesting. The two-layer method (TLM) is one of several cold storage
   solutions that seeks to preserve organs and cells avoiding in vivo and
   in vitro ischemia. We compared the retrieval of beta-like elements from
   exocrine pancreatic cells using TLM versus University of Wisconsin (UW)
   solutions. For this purpose pancreata laparoscopically harvested from 20
   female pigs were preserved in UW solution or TLM before digestion. The
   resulting exocrine cells were divided into 2 groups: the first was
   cultured in a designed medium to allow differentiation into beta-like
   cells and the second was cryopreserved before the differentiation
   process at -196 degrees C for 8 weeks before culture in the same medium.
   The results revealed that TLM was better than UW as a preservation
   solution in terms of beta-cell viability and insulin secretion. We
   suggest that the use of TLM solution allows one to obtain less damaged
   cells for research purposes.},

Abstract = {The full-length genome sequence of a feline G3P{[}9] rotavirus (RV)
   strain, BA222, identified from the intestinal content of an adult cat,
   was determined. Strain BA222 possessed a
   G3-P{[}9]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A3-N1-T3-E2-H3 genomic constellation, differing
   substantially from other feline RVs. Phylogenetic analyses of each
   genome segment revealed common origins with selected animal and zoonotic
   human RVs, notably with rare multi-reassortant human G3P{[}9] RVs
   (Ita/PA158/96 and Ita/PAH136/96). Altogether, the findings suggest that

Abstract = {Emergency oral fox vaccination campaigns, targeting a recent rabies
   epidemic in wild foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in north-eastern Italy, were
   implemented twice, first in the winter of 2009 and then in the spring of
   2010. Following on an unsuccessful manual bait distribution campaign,
   vaccine baits were aerially distributed by helicopters using a
   satellite-navigated, computer-supported, automatic bait drop system. The
   flight paths were traced with distance of 500-1,000 m from one another
   to optimise helicopter missions and guarantee homogeneous coverage of
   the vaccination area. The vaccine distribution was evaluated by
   superimposing a 1 km-step grid and weighing the number of baits per
   cell. The implementation of a geographical information system for the
   management of vaccine distribution proved to be useful, both for the
   planning and execution phases, of the campaigns. It supported effective
   management of the flights and allowed near real-time monitoring of the
   campaigns. In addition, it facilitated the identification of areas with
   suboptimal bait density that would require additional flights or
   supplementary, manual distribution.},

Abstract = {The increasing demand for avian influenza diagnostic reagents worldwide,
   has included requests for significant supplies of product to developing
   countries. Difficulties in dispatching to remote areas and tropical
   countries are a major concern to suppliers, international organisations
   and donors as delays in forwarding parcels often result in storage at
   non-optimal or inadequate temperatures results in loss in titre and thus
   wastage of resources.
   In this study we demonstrate that the heat stability of avian influenza
   haemagglutination inhibition antigens of the H5, H7 and H9 subtype
   following 14 days of exposure to 37 degrees C and 45 degrees C is
   significantly increased by adding D-(+)-Trehalose to the freshly
   prepared antigen. Increased stability was detected both for freeze-dried
   antigens over an extended period of 6 months and also in heat exposed
   antigens that were then stored at +4 C for up to 35 days post
   reconstitution. (C) 2011 The International Alliance for Biologicals.

Abstract = {Usutu virus (USUV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus belonging to the
   Japanese encephalitis serocomplex, recently related to neurological
   disease in immunosuppressed patients. In the same area of Northern Italy
   where USUV human cases occurred in 2009, a regional West Nile virus
   (WNV) surveillance program based on mosquito monitoring and wild birds
   screening has been implemented since 2008. Mosquito pools and wild birds
   were tested using three different polymerase chain reactions
   (Flavivirus, WNV, and USUV). During summer 2009, 56 pools (54 consisting
   of Culex pipiens and 2 of Aedes albopictus) and 27 pools (Cx. pipiens)
   out of 1789 mosquito pools were, respectively, USUV and WNV positive.
   Moreover, out of 1218 wild birds tested, 44 were WNV positive, whereas
   only 11 birds were USUV positive by polymerase chain reaction. Data
   collected during 2009 prove a cocirculation of USUV and WNV in Northern
   Italy, but these two viruses show different incidence values in both
   mosquitoes and birds, suggesting involvement of different animals (other
   bird species or mammals) in their natural cycles. The cocirculation of
   WNV and USUV poses a new potential threat to human health in this area.
   The extent of WNV surveillance to other Flaviviruses will require new
   diagnostic procedures able to process a large number of samples in a
   limited period of time and highlights the importance of developing more
   specific serological tests that could be used in field.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to assess a protocol of study
   of carotid atherosclerosis coupling vascular wall imaging and luminal
   imaging in the same examination and to evaluate the accuracy of
   high-resolution MRI with a neurovascular coil in carotid plaque
   characterization.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Thirty-two consecutive patients with 34 carotid
   artery stenoses were prospectively enrolled. MRI was performed on a
   1.5-T unit. Plaque assessment was performed starting with a
   diffusion-weighted sequence and followed by a fat-suppressed T1-weighted
   sequence; after contrast-enhanced MR angiography (CE-MRA), all patients
   were evaluated with a T1-weighted 3D high-resolution sequence. Carotid
   plaques were classified as type A, having a large lipid-necrotic core;
   type B, being a complex fibrotic-calcified plaque with soft content
   (mixed plaque); or type C, being a fibrotic-calcified plaque (hard).
   Additional features indicative of vulnerable plaque such as intraplaque
   hemorrhage (IPH), ulceration, and severe stenosis were registered. MR
   findings were compared with surgical specimens.
   RESULTS. MRI correctly identified 11 of 13 type A, eight of 11 type B,
   and eight of 10 type C plaques (sensitivity, 84.6\%, 72.7\%, and 80\%,
   respectively). In the identification of lipid-necrotic core plaque, MRI
   showed a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and
   negative predictive value (NPV) of 84.6\%, 100\%, 100\%, and 91.3\%,
   respectively (kappa = 0.87). For reordering all plaques in two groups
   (i.e., soft vs nonsoft) in the identification of soft plaques, MRI had a
   sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 83.3\%, 80\%, 90.9\%, and
   66.7\%, respectively (kappa = 0.59). IPH, ulcers, and severe stenosis
   were detected in eight of eight, 11 of 13, and 25 of 25 cases,
   respectively.
   CONCLUSION. In patients with carotid atherosclerosis, ongoing CE-MRA
   with a neurovascular coil for the simultaneous detection of unstable
   plaques is feasible. Our MR protocol accurately identifies the major
   features of vulnerable plaque.},

Abstract = {Longitudinal studies evaluating the evolution of clinical,
   haematological, biochemical findings in young dogs exposed for the first
   time to multiple vector-borne pathogens have not been reported. With the
   objective of assessing the evolution of clinical, haematological and
   biochemical findings, these parameters were serially monitored in
   naturally infected dogs throughout a 1-year follow-up period. Young
   dogs, infected by vector-borne pathogens based on cytology or polymerase
   chain reaction, were examined clinically and blood samples were obtained
   at seven different follow-up time points. Dogs were randomized to group
   A (17 dogs treated with a spot-on formulation of imidacloprid 10\% and
   permethrin 50\%) or to group B (17 dogs untreated). In addition, 10
   4-month-old beagles were enrolled in each group and used as sentinel
   dogs. At baseline, Anaplasma platys was the most frequently detected
   pathogen, followed by Babesia vogeli, Bartonella spp., Ehrlichia canis
   and Hepatozoon cants. Co-infections with A. platys and B. vogeli,
   followed by E. canis and B. vogeli, A. platys and H. cants and A. platys
   and Bartonella spp. were also diagnosed. In dogs from group B. abnormal
   clinical signs were recorded at different time points throughout the
   study. No abnormal clinical signs were recorded in group A dogs.
   Thrombocytopenia was the most frequent haematological alteration
   recorded in A. platys-infected dogs, B. vogeli-infected dogs and in dogs
   co-infected with A. platys and B. vogeli or A. platys and Bartonella
   spp. Lymphocytosis was frequently detected among dogs infected with B.
   vogeli or co-infected with A. platys and B. vogeli. Beagles were often
   infected with a single pathogen rather than with multiple canine
   vector-borne pathogens. There was a significant association (p < 0.01)
   between tick infestation and A. platys or B. vogeli, as single
   infections, and A. platys and B. vogeli or A. platys and Bartonella spp.
   co-infections. This study emphasizes the clinical difficulties
   associated with assigning a specific clinical sign or haematological
   abnormality to a particular canine vector-borne disease. (C) 2010

Abstract = {A total of 47 stool samples were collected at the same stud farm from
   young foals with rotavirus diarrhoea and from their stud mares. Illness
   involved foals during three consecutive winter seasons. Infection in the
   farm appeared firstly in January-February 2008. After vanishing in the
   warm seasons, cases reappeared in March 2009 and 2010. Determination of
   the rotavirus G- and P-types was carried out using nested RT-PCR in
   samples collected in 2009 and 2010. A total of 19 of 47 samples resulted
   positive for rotavirus. The G type was determined in 19/47 samples,
   whereas the P genotype was determined in 17/47 samples. All equine
   strains presented a G14 VP7 in combination with a P{[}12]VP4, suggesting
   persistence of the same viral strain in the stud farm, during at least
   two consecutive winter periods. Sequence analysis of the genes encoding
   the outer capsid rotavirus proteins VP7 and VP4 revealed that the virus
   had a close relationship between strains recently isolated in the rest
   of Europe. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Opisthorchiasis is a fish borne parasitic infection caused by helminths
   of the genus Opisthorchis (Digenea, Opisthorchiidae), affecting humans
   and other fish-eating mammals. Despite Opisthorchis felineus was first
   described in Italy in 1884, no cases of human opisthorchiasis were
   reported in this country until 2004; from then on, 4 outbreaks due to
   this species have been recorded in Central Italy. Following the more
   relevant of these outbreaks, involving 34 people in August 2007, snails,
   fishes and fecal samples collected from the Bolsena and Bracciano lakes
   (Central Italy) were analyzed in order to define the cycle of O.
   felineus in the area and investigate its prevalence in the different
   hosts. Pools of 20-40 snails each (4983 specimens altogether) of the
   genus Bithynia were analyzed by PCR for parasite DNA detection. Eight
   hundred and ninety-four fish belonging to 12 species were collected from
   the two lakes and tested for metacercariae both by muscle compression
   and digestion techniques. Eighty-seven fecal samples of 5 putative
   definitive host species were collected very close to the two lakes and
   tested for parasite eggs detection by formalin-ethyl acetate
   concentration technique. Identification at the species level of
   metacercariae and eggs, respectively, from fish and stool was confirmed
   by PCR analysis and sequencing. O. felineus DNA was detected in 0.08\%
   (overall minimum infection rate) of snails of the genus Bithynia from
   the two lakes. The tench, Tinca tinca, was the only fish found infested
   in both lakes (prevalence 88.5\%). O. felineus eggs were found only in
   cat feces (prevalence 46.4\%). The tench represents the only threat for
   the human consumption in the study area while Coregonus sp., the most
   economically important species for the local fishery and frequently
   consumed raw marinated, resulted to be not infected. The high prevalence
   recorded both in fish and in definitive host suggests a widespread and
   massive presence of the parasite in the area. Further studies are needed
   to better investigate the possible role of some cyprinids species as
   intermediate hosts, in order to check their safety for human
   consumption. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Diagnosis of Hepatozoon canis in young dogs by cytology and PCR},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {4},
Month = {APR 13},
Abstract = {Background: Hepatozoon canis is a widespread tick-borne protozoan
   affecting dogs. The diagnosis of H. canis infection is usually performed
   by cytology of blood or buffy coat smears, but this method may not be
   sensitive. Our study aimed to evaluate the best method to achieve a
   parasitological diagnosis of H. canis infection in a population of
   receptive young dogs, previously negative by cytology and exposed to
   tick infestation for one summer season.
   Results: A total of 73 mongrel dogs and ten beagles younger than 18
   months of age, living in an animal shelter in southern Italy where dogs
   are highly infested by Rhipicephalus sanguineus, were included in this
   study. In March-April 2009 and in October 2009, blood and bone marrow
   were sampled from each dog. Blood, buffy coat and bone marrow were
   examined by cytology only (at the first sampling) and also by PCR for H.
   canis (second sampling). In March-April 2009, only one dog was positive
   for H. canis by cytological examination, whereas in October 2009 (after
   the summer season), the overall incidence of H. canis infection by
   cytological examinations was 43.9\%. Molecular tests carried out on
   samples taken in October 2009 showed a considerably higher number of
   dogs positive by PCR (from 27.7\% up to 51.2\% on skin and buffy coat
   tissues, respectively), with an overall positivity of 57.8\%. All
   animals, but one, which were positive by cytology were also
   PCR-positive. PCR on blood or buffy coat detected the highest number of
   H. canis-positive dogs displaying a sensitivity of 85.7\% for both
   tissues that increased up to 98\% when used in parallel. Twenty-six
   (74.8\%) out of the 28 H. canis-positive dogs presented hematological
   abnormalities, eosinophilia being the commonest alteration observed.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that PCR on buffy coat and blood is the
   best diagnostic assay for detecting H. canis infection in dogs, although
   when PCR is not available, cytology on buffy coat should be preferred to
   blood smear evaluation. This study has also demonstrated that H. canis
   infection can spread among young dogs infested by R. sanguineus and be
   present in the majority of the exposed population within 6 months.},

Abstract = {In April 2010, the sampling of juvenile Pacific cupped oysters
   originating from France was undertaken from a farm located off the coast
   of the Marche region in Italy. Samples were sent to the national
   reference laboratory for mollusc diseases for bacteriological,
   histological, electron microscopical and molecular analysis. Classical
   and Real-Time PCR indicated the presence of the microvariant (OsHV-1 mu
   var) of Type 1 Ostreid Herpes virus (OsHV-1) despite the absence of
   clinical and pathological signs normally associated with the presence of
   this variant. Further molecular and sequencing analysis revealed the
   presence of OsHV-1 par and OsHV-1 DNA in one oyster indicating that
   simultaneous detection of both viruses is possible. This is the first
   report of the presence of OsHV-1 mu var in Italy and also the first time
   that evidence of possible co-infection of OsHV-1 and OsHV-1 mu var has
   been provided. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The extensive circulation of the H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza
   (HPAI) virus in animals and the human health implications which it poses
   have led to extensive research in unexplored fields and thus a
   re-assessment of our understanding of this infection. Moreover,
   widespread infection of poultry has raised concerns about the food
   safety and trade implications of this infection, necessitating revised
   international trade regulations.
   The role of wild birds has been much debated and resources have been
   invested to clarify the role that they may play in the spread of
   infection. It is now clear that wild birds may be responsible for
   primary introduction in a previously free area. To date it is still
   unclear whether HPAI infection may be maintained in wild bird
   populations for extended periods of time. This paper reviews existing
   knowledge on the transboundary spread of HPAI through poultry and
   poultry commodities and summarises evidence of spread through wild
   birds.},

Title = {The conservation of the chamois Rupicapra spp.},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2},
Pages = {163-174},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Despite it being the most abundant mountain dwelling ungulate of Europe
   and the Near East, the taxonomy, systematics and biology of the chamois
   are still imperfectly known. Although neither species of chamois is at
   risk, several subspecies are threatened (Rupicapra rupicapra cartusiana,
   Rupicapra rupicapra tatrica and Rupicapra rupicapra balcanica; Rupicapra
   pyrenaica ornata. Rupicapra rupicapra asiatica is data-deficient but
   probably threatened).
   A life history with apparently contradictory relationships between
   survival, sexual dimorphism and mating system suggests a unique survival
   strategy not yet fully understood. Over the last century, morphologic,
   biometric, behavioural and genetic features have been studied to shed
   light on the phylogeography and monophyly or polyphyly of the chamois as
   well as on the number of existing species and subspecies of the genus
   Rupicapra.
   The dispersal hypothesis, according to which R. rupicapra migrated
   westward from eastern Europe in the Quaternary, confining R. pyrenaica
   to the southernmost regions of Europe, has been recently called into
   question by some molecular analyses that yielded contradictory results.
   In spite of subtleties relevant to each method of analysis, an overall
   evaluation of differences between the R. rupicapra and the R. pyrenaica
   groups strongly supports the functional separation of the taxa into two
   species.
   Further studies on the ecology of chamois, as well as on the
   epidemiology of severe diseases, e.g. sarcoptic mange, are needed to
   improve the management of viable populations.
   Before translocations and reintroductions are carried out, the risk of
   hybridization leading to genetic extinction should be evaluated.},

Abstract = {An investigation was conducted to evaluate Staphylococcus attreus
   contamination in various types of food of animal origin. Of the 350
   samples examined, 14.0\% were found to be contaminated with S. aureus.
   Prevalence rates varied according to type, namely: 19.3\% for fresh meat
   products, 13.3\% for fresh cheeses, 3.6\% for bakery products and 7.7\%
   for deli products. The isolated S. aureus strains then underwent 16S
   rDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by reverse latex
   agglutination tests to identify enterotoxigenic strains. The results
   were compared with data obtained by subjecting the same strains to tests
   for the genes coding for the S. aureus enterotoxins (SEs) sea, seb, sec,
   sed, see, sag, sch, sei and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1).
   Reversed passive latex agglutination (RPLA) testing revealed that 16.3\%
   of strains (8/49) produced enterotoxins, while on PCR, 48.97\% (24/49)
   were found to carry one or more genes for the production of SEs, and
   were therefore potentially enterotoxigenic.},

Journal = {RESEARCH IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate the time-course of the immune
   response to a field Porcine Respiratory and Reproductive Syndrome virus
   (PRRSV) strain in PRRS-naive, untreated pigs, as well as in four groups
   of age and breed-matched pigs injected with a live attenuated PRRS
   vaccine, its adjuvant, an inactivated PRRS vaccine and an irrelevant,
   inactivated Porcine Circovirus type 2 (PCV2) vaccine, respectively.
   PRRSV infection was confirmed in all groups by PCR and antibody assays.
   The antibody response measured by ELISA took place earlier in pigs
   injected with the live attenuated vaccine, which also developed a much
   stronger serum-neutralizing antibody response to the vaccine strain.
   Yet, no clear protection was evidenced in terms of viremia against the
   field virus strain, which showed 11.1\% nucleotide divergence in ORF7
   from the vaccine strain. In vitro, the interferon (IFN)-gamma response
   to PRRSV was almost absent on PVD 60 in all groups under study, whereas
   the prevalence of interleukin (IL)-10 responses to PRRSV was fairly high
   in PCV2-vaccinated animals, only. Results indicate that distinct
   patterns of immune response to a field PRRSV strain can be recognized in
   PRRS-vaccinated and nave pigs, which probably underlies fundamental
   differences in the development and differentiation of PRRSV-specific
   immune effector cells. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   examination, the mare showed profound depression, pale mucous membranes,
   enlarged lymph nodes, febrile temperature, hind limbs edema, and
   swelling of the right carpus. Anemia and thrombocytopenia were also
   observed. Because of worsening of clinical signs, treatment with
   oxytetracycline (6 mg/kg) was started. An improvement of clinical
   conditions was observed within 12 hours, with a full recovery in 2
   weeks. Two months after the first hospitalization, new serological tests
   showed seroconversion to Anaplasma phagocytophilum. In conclusion, the
   severity of clinical signs was attributed to the concomitant infections,
   usually subclinical in Sicily. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) is a severe, fatal disease of cattle and
   other domestic and wild ruminants and exhibited a long incubation
   period. Aetiological agents of MCF belong to subfamily
   gamma-Herpesvirinae, gen. Rhadinovirus and are represented by AIHV-1
   (Alcelaphine herpes virus type 1) e OvHV-2 (Ovine herpesvirus type 2);
   in Europe the disease is frequently associated with the transmission of
   a gamma-herpesvirus, the ovine herpesvirus type 2 (OvHV-2).
   MCF usually appears sporadically and affects few animals; infection
   occur through via oronasal and it is characterized by accumulation of
   lymphocytes in various tissues. However, the pathogenic basis of the
   disease is still an enigma.
   The present study describes three outbreaks of MCF in cattle reared in
   Piedmont.
   During Spring - Summer 2010, post-mortem examination on five animals
   with clinical signs ascribed to MCF was conducted. A full necropsy was
   performed and brain and tissue samples from all organs were
   systematically collected for histology. Bacteriological and virological
   examinations were also carried out.
   Results obtained by anatomo-histopathological investigation and
   laboratory findings confirmed the clinical suspect of MCF in all the
   examined animals.
   This study highlights the importance of the combination of clinical
   signs, histopathology, neuropathology and detection of virus in tissue
   samples in order to diagnose MCF.},

Title = {Steroidogenic enzyme gene expression profiles in the testis of cattle
   treated with illicit growth promoters},
Journal = {STEROIDS},
Year = {2011},

Abstract = {Recently, the effect of illicit growth promoters (GPs) upon the cattle
   transcriptome has drawn the increasing attention of the scientific
   community. In the present study, the pre-transcriptional effects of
   three different illicit protocols on a set of target genes, including
   steroidogenic enzymes and three related transcription factors, were
   estimated in cattle testis.
   Beef cattle were administered with dexamethasone (DEX) orally (group
   D-1) or intramuscularly in experiment 1 (group DIM). In experiment 2,
   DEX was orally administered alone (group D-2) or with 17 beta-estradiol
   (group DE), and in experiment 3, dehydroepiandrosterone and boldione
   were orally administered alone (group DHEA and group ADD) or in
   combination (group DHAD). The GP effects were measured by quantitative
   real time RT-PCR.
   The results of our study were significant but not univocal. A
   GP-dependent effect on target gene mRNA levels was noticed for 3
   beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD3 beta 1, p < 0.05 and p <
   0.01 for the D-2, DE and DHAD groups, respectively), the cytochrome P450
   side chain cleavage (DHAD, p < 0.05), the cytochrome P450 17A1 (DIM and
   D-2, p < 0.05), HSD17 beta 3 (DE, p < 0.05), aromatase (DHEA, p < 0.05),
   the androgen receptor (DHAD, p < 0.05) and the mineralocorticoid
   receptor-like (DIM, p < 0.05).
   Our present results suggest that different GP schedules are likely to
   affect genes involved in steroid synthesis and regulation in cattle
   testis. Thus, this tissue might be considered a potential surrogate
   tissue that warrants further study into its usefulness in the screening
   of GP abuse. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A new real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
   assay for a simple and rapid diagnosis of African Horse Sickness (AHS)
   was developed. Primers and FAM-labeled TaqMan-MGB probes specific for
   African horse sickness virus (AHSV) were selected from the consensus
   sequence of the segment 8 of all 9 serotypes of AHSV reference strains.
   For the determination of the analytical sensitivity, an in vitro
   transcript (AHS\_n52 17) of the target region was constructed and
   tested. Furthermore, the AHS\_ns2 17 transcript was used either as
   positive control or as a standard for quantifying target copies. A
   commercial heterologous Armored RNA was used as an internal positive
   control (IPC) for both RNA isolation and RT-PCR steps. The qRT-PCR
   AHS\_ns2 was able to amplify the target sequence up to 0.71
   copies/reaction. Its flexibility allowed to amplify a wide dynamic range
   of RNA copies from 1.5 to 0.001 fg. Within this range, the Ct values
   varied from 18 to 38 cycles with SD values always lower than 0.5
   confirming their strong and constant linear correlation with the RNA
   target. Furthermore the newly designed duplex real-time RT-PCR proved to
   be strictly AHSV-specific as it did not amplify close related viruses.

Abstract = {International trade in bees and bee products is a complex issue,
   affected by their different origins and uses. The trade in bees, which
   poses the main risk for disease dissemination, is very active and not
   all transactions may be officially registered by the competent
   authorities. Globally, bee health continues to deteriorate as pathogens,
   pests, parasites and diseases are spread internationally through
   legitimate trade, smuggling and well-intentioned but ill-advised bee
   introductions by professionals. International trade rules strengthen the
   ability of many countries to protect bee health while trading but also
   carry obligations. Countries that are Members of the World Trade
   Organization (WTO) should only restrict imports to protect against
   identifiable health risks. If imports are safe, trade should be
   permitted. The trading rules of the WTO have given greater importance to
   the international standards applicable to bee health, developed by the
   World Organisation for Animal Health, which aims to prevent the spread
   of animal diseases while facilitating international trade in animals and
   animal products.},

   `diarrhetic' and `normal' faeces and two batches of commercial
   dehydrated dog food were cultured for pathogenic bacteria. The results
   of 25, out of a total of 41 dogs (60.9\%) revealed at least one faecal
   sample as being positive for Salmonella; incidence per sampling ranged
   from 12.5\% to 34\%. Nine of 10 samples of dehydrated food were
   positive. Ten totally different serotypes were isolated from dry food
   and faeces: the results of the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis referred
   to similarity between the Salmonella Montevideo, Muenster and
   Worthington isolates recovered from both the food and canine faecal
   samples.},

Abstract = {The objective was to determine effects of partially replacing Zn. Cu and
   Mn in sulphate form with organic trace minerals (OTM) during the dry
   period and lactation on dairy cow productive performance, fertility and
   health status, while supplying Zn and Cu to meet National Research
   Council (NRC: 2001) guidelines for lactating Holstein dairy cows in
   mid-lactation and Mn above NRC guidelines. At the beginning of the dry
   period, 296 pregnant Holstein cows were randomized to one of two
   experimental groups. During the dry phase, cows were fed a diet where
   Cu, Mn, and Zn were supplied as sulphates (control group) or a diet in
   which 500 g/kg of Cu, Mn, and Zn was supplied as sulphates and 500 g/kg
   as OTM (KeyShure (TM)). During lactation, cows that had been previously
   assigned to the control group were fed, for 240 d, a diet where Cu, Mn,
   and Zn were supplied as sulphates (control group) while cows which had
   received OTM during the dry phase were fed a diet in which 250 g/kg of
   sulphates were replaced with similar amounts of organic Cu. Mn, and Zn
   (OTM). Cows were housed in a free stall barn with four pens (two pens
   per treatment). Colostrum from cows fed OTM contained more
   immunoglobulins (+19\%; P < 0.01) whereas OTM supplementation had no
   effect on the concentration of trace minerals in colostrum. During the
   first 150 d, OTM increased milk fat content by 4.4\% (P < 0.05) while
   milk yield, protein content and somatic cell count were not influenced
   by treatment. Because more cows from the OTM group became pregnant
   between 150 and 240 d, a higher number of services per conception (2.01
   versus 2.61 for control and OTM, respectively; P < 0.01) occurred in
   cows fed OTM. Calf mortality at calving was lower in multiparous cows
   fed OTM (15.6 versus 5.6\% for control and OTM, respectively; P < 0.05)
   whereas there were no differences in other pathologic events and claw
   disorders. This study produced evidence that partial substitution of Zn,
   Cu and Mn sulphates with OTM during the dry phase and lactation resulted
   in higher colostrum immunoglobulins and milk fat, as well as lower calf
   mortality at calving. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {High throughput MLVA-16 typing for Brucella based on the microfluidics
   technology},
Journal = {BMC MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAR 24},
Abstract = {Background: Brucellosis, a zoonosis caused by the genus Brucella, has
   been eradicated in Northern Europe, Australia, the USA and Canada, but
   remains endemic in most areas of the world. The strain and biovar typing
   of Brucella field samples isolated in outbreaks is useful for tracing
   back source of infection and may be crucial for discriminating naturally
   occurring outbreaks versus bioterrorist events, being Brucella a
   potential biological warfare agent. In the last years MLVA-16 has been
   described for Brucella spp. genotyping. The MLVA band profiles may be
   resolved by different techniques i.e. the manual agarose gels, the
   capillary electrophoresis sequencing systems or the microfluidic
   Lab-on-Chip electrophoresis. In this paper we described a high
   throughput system of MLVA-16 typing for Brucella spp. by using of the
   microfluidics technology.
   Results: The Caliper LabChip 90 equipment was evaluated for MLVA-16
   typing of sixty-three Brucella samples. Furthermore, in order to
   validate the system, DNA samples previously resolved by sequencing
   system and Agilent technology, were de novo genotyped. The comparison of
   the MLVA typing data obtained by the Caliper equipment and those
   previously obtained by the other analysis methods showed a good
   correlation. However the outputs were not accurate as the Caliper DNA
   fragment sizes showed discrepancies compared with real data and a
   conversion table from observed to expected data was created.
   Conclusion: In this paper we described the MLVA-16 using a rapid,
   sophisticated microfluidics technology for detection of amplification
   product sizes. The comparison of the MLVA typing data produced by
   Caliper LabChip 90 system with the data obtained by different techniques
   showed a general concordance of the results. Furthermore this platform
   represents a significant improvement in terms of handling, data
   acquiring, computational efficiency and rapidity, allowing to perform
   the strain genotyping in a time equal to one sixth respect to other
   microfluidics systems as e.g. the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer.
   Finally, this platform can be considered a valid alternative to standard
   genotyping techniques, particularly useful dealing with a large number
   of samples in short time. These data confirmed that this technology
   represents a significative advancement in high-throughput accurate
   Brucella genotyping.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to determine the situation of equine arteritis
   virus (EAV) infections in hucul horses. A total of 176 horses (154 mares
   and 22 stallions) from the biggest hucul horse stud in Poland were
   tested. Antibodies against EAV were detected in 97 (55.1\%) horses. The
   EAV seroprevalence among mares was 53.2\% while in stallions - 68.2\%.
   The percentage of positive mares increased with their age, thus amongst
   the mares of less than 2 years of age the percentage was 32.5\%, while
   in the group of 3-5 years old increased to 59.4\% and in the mares in
   the age of 6-10 years and older than 10 years 89.5\% and 95\% were
   seropositive, respectively. Among 11 seropositive stallions five were
   supposed to be shedders of EAV with their semen. It is likely that those
   persistently infected stallions were the reservoirs of the virus in the
   stud. Genetic studies using of ORF5 gene showed high homology between
   the viruses detected in the semen of those stallions what suggested

Title = {Localization of Helicobacter spp. in the fundic mucosa of laboratory
   Beagle dogs: an ultrastructural study},
Journal = {VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {42},
Month = {MAR 2},
Abstract = {In dogs Helicobacter spp. are found in all gastric regions usually
   localized in the surface mucus, gastric glands and parietal cells. The
   aim of this study was to detail the distribution of Helicobacter spp. in
   the fundic mucosa of asymptomatic Beagle dogs and their intracellular
   localization within parietal cells, in order to evaluate
   species-specific pathogenetic effects on gastric cells. The presence of
   Helicobacter spp. was investigated by immunohistochemistry, TEM, and PCR
   in the fundic mucosa of six Beagle dogs. Helicobacter spp. were found in
   all dogs examined, and H. bizzozeronii and H. felis were identified by
   PCR and confirmed by TEM. In the lumen of the fundic glands,
   co-localization was common. H. bizzozeronii was present in larger
   numbers than H. felis in both intraluminal and intraparietal
   localization. The amounts of H. bizzozeronii were similar in superficial
   and basal portions of the glands. H. felis was predominantly localized
   in the superficial portions of gastric glands but almost absent from the
   base. Within parietal cells, most Helicobacter organisms were
   intracanalicular, but intact and degenerate Helicobacter organisms were
   also visualized free in the cytoplasm or in secondary lysosomes. No
   specific degenerative lesions were found in infected parietal cells.
   Helicobacter organisms were also observed within macrophages in the
   lamina propria. In conclusion, there is a differential distribution of
   H. bizzozeronii and H. felis in the fundic mucosa of Beagle dogs, and
   their intracellular localization in parietal cells and macrophages
   suggests novel pathogenic scenarios for the development of immune
   response and maintenance of chronic gastritis in dogs.},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) are pathogens of global concern, but
   there has been little previous research on avian influenza in southern
   Africa and almost nothing is known about the dynamics of AIVs in the
   region. We counted, captured and sampled birds regularly at five sites,
   two in South Africa (Barberspan and Strandfontein) and one in each of
   Botswana (Lake Ngami), Mozambique (Lake Chuali) and Zimbabwe (Lakes
   Manyame and Chivero) between March 2007 and May 2009. The South African
   and Zimbabwean sites were visited every 2 months and the sites in
   Botswana and Mozambique every 4 months. During each visit we undertook
   5-7 days of standardised bird counts followed by 5-10 days of capturing
   and sampling water-associated birds. We sampled 4,977 birds of 165
   different species and completed 2,503 half-hour point counts. We found
   125 positive rRT-PCR cases of avian influenza across all sites. Two
   viruses (H1N8 and H3N8) were isolated and additional H5, H6 and H7
   strains were identified. We did not positively identify any highly
   pathogenic H5N1. Overall viral prevalence (2.51\%) was similar to the
   lower range of European values, considerable spatial and temporal
   variation occurred in viral prevalence, and there was no detectable
   influence of the annual influx of Palearctic migrants. Although
   waterbirds appear to be the primary viral carriers, passerines may link
   wild birds and poultry. While influenza cycles are probably driven by
   the bird movements that result from rainfall patterns, the epidemiology
   of avian influenza in wild birds in the subregion is complex and there
   appears to be the possibility for viral transmission throughout the
   year.},

   swine influenza viruses (SIVs) in Belgium, UK, Italy, France and Spain
   from 2006 to 2008. Our major aims were to clarify the occurrence of the
   three SIV subtypes - H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2 - at regional levels, to
   identify novel reassortant viruses and to antigenically compare SIVs
   with human H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses. Lung tissue and/or nasal
   swabs from outbreaks of acute respiratory disease in pigs were
   investigated by virus isolation. The hemagglutinin (HA) and
   neuraminidase (NA) subtypes were determined using standard methods. Of
   the total 169 viruses, 81 were classified as `avian-like' H1N1, 36 as
   human-like H3N2 and 47 as human-like H1N2. Only five novel reassortant
   viruses were identified: two H1N1 viruses had a human-like HA and three
   H1N2 viruses an avian-like HA. All three SIV subtypes were detected in
   Belgium, Italy and Spain, while only H1N1 and H1N2 viruses were found in
   UK and Northwestern France. Cross-hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests
   with hyperimmune sera against selected older and recent human influenza
   viruses showed a strong antigenic relationship between human H1N1 and
   H3N2 viruses from the 1980s and H1N2 and H3N2 human-like SIVs,
   confirming their common origin. However, antisera against human viruses
   isolated during the last decade did not react with currently circulating
   H1 or H3 SIVs, suggesting that especially young people may be, to some
   degree, susceptible to SIV infections.},

Abstract = {An adult female red-crowned parakeet (Cyanoramphus novaezelandieae) was
   presented for necropsy and histopathologic evaluation. The bird had died
   after exhibiting lameness, weight loss, respiratory signs, and
   hemoptysis. Postmortem radiographs revealed lesions in the diaphysis of
   the left femur and soft-tissue opacities in the lungs. At necropsy, the
   muscles of the left femur were pale and swollen, white-yellow small
   nodules were visible in lungs and air sacs, and the liver and other
   coelomic organs appeared pale. On histologic examination, areas of
   necrosis in the lungs were extensively infiltrated with acid-fast
   positive bacilli surrounded by macrophages, epithelioid cells, and giant
   cells. Acid-fast bacilli were also present in the left leg muscle and in
   granulomas in the liver, kidneys, and intestine. Fungal hyphae
   associated with a Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon were visible in the left
   leg muscle. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was confirmed by polymerase chain
   reaction testing performed on muscle samples. Results were indicative of
   infection with M tuberculosis complicated by mycotic myositis. The
   disease in avian species is of zoonotic importance, and infected birds
   may be a useful sentinel for human infection.},

Title = {Lung Adenocarcinoma Originates from Retrovirus Infection of

Journal = {PLOS PATHOGENS},

Abstract = {Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) is a unique oncogenic virus with
   distinctive biological properties. JSRV is the only virus causing a
   naturally occurring lung cancer (ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma, OPA)
   and possessing a major structural protein that functions as a dominant
   oncoprotein. Lung cancer is the major cause of death among cancer
   patients. OPA can be an extremely useful animal model in order to
   identify the cells originating lung adenocarcinoma and to study the
   early events of pulmonary carcinogenesis. In this study, we demonstrated
   that lung adenocarcinoma in sheep originates from infection and
   transformation of proliferating type 2 pneumocytes (termed here lung
   alveolar proliferating cells, LAPCs). We excluded that OPA originates
   from a bronchioalveolar stem cell, or from mature post-mitotic type 2
   pneumocytes or from either proliferating or non-proliferating Clara
   cells. We show that young animals possess abundant LAPCs and are highly
   susceptible to JSRV infection and transformation. On the contrary,
   healthy adult sheep, which are normally resistant to experimental OPA
   induction, exhibit a relatively low number of LAPCs and are resistant to
   JSRV infection of the respiratory epithelium. Importantly, induction of
   lung injury increased dramatically the number of LAPCs in adult sheep
   and rendered these animals fully susceptible to JSRV infection and
   transformation. Furthermore, we show that JSRV preferentially infects
   actively dividing cell in vitro. Overall, our study provides unique
   insights into pulmonary biology and carcinogenesis and suggests that
   JSRV and its host have reached an evolutionary equilibrium in which
   productive infection (and transformation) can occur only in cells that
   are scarce for most of the lifespan of the sheep. Our data also indicate
   that, at least in this model, inflammation can predispose to retroviral
   infection and cancer.},

Abstract = {Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are self-renewable multipotent stromal
   cells, exhibiting an extensive proliferative potential.
   Numerous studies have demonstrated that they have immunomodulatory
   effects and inhibit T cell alloreactivity in vitro.
   A bank of cryopreserved equine adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells
   (AdMSCs) was set up in our laboratory with the aim to evaluate the
   maintenance of several sternness features after freezing, including
   their efficacy in the treatment of teno-desmic lesions of sport horses.
   Cryopreservation gives the opportunity to store a high number of cells
   that are ready to use and that have been previously characterized
   concerning their biologic features.
   The results obtained by in vitro and in vivo tests carried out in this
   study demonstrated that the main properties of equine AdMSCs are
   preserved after cryoconservation.
   Our findings encourage the use of these cells as a safety and effective
   therapeutic tool in allogenic transplantation procedures.},

Abstract = {A 7-year-old male German Shepherd dog in poor body condition had a
   3-month history of intermittent hematuria. Nonregenerative anemia, mild
   leukocytosis, marked hypoalbuminemia, and hematuria were observed.
   Subsequently, marked neutrophilia and moderate monocytosis were noted;
   anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and hematuria persisted; and the dog developed
   disseminated intravascular coagulation. Ultrasonographic examination of
   the abdomen revealed the presence of an enlarged and irregularly shaped
   right kidney with a large area of cavitation, and a nephrectomy was
   performed 30 days after initial examination. Cytologic examination of
   fine-needle aspirates and imprints of the right kidney revealed a
   neoplastic cell population suggestive of renal carcinoma. The
   histopathologic diagnosis was chromophobic cystic-papillary renal
   carcinoma. The tumor cells expressed
   granulocytic/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), detected by
   immunohistochemical staining, and elaboration of GM-CSF by the tumor may
   have mediated the leukocytosis in this dog. Following excision of the
   tumor, neutrophil and monocyte counts were only mildly increased. The
   dog died 135 days after initial presentation, and a necropsy was not
   permitted. Paraneoplastic neutrophilic leukocytosis is an uncommon
   finding and may be caused by elaboration of CSF by neoplastic cells.},

Abstract = {We aim to predict the population density of Salmonella spp. through the
   pork supply chain under dynamic environmental conditions (pH, a(w) and
   temperature) that fluctuate from growth to survival/slow inactivation.
   To do this, the dependence of the probability of growth, and of the
   growth and inactivation rate on the temperature, pH and a(w) were
   modelled. Probabilistic and kinetic measurements, i.e. growth and
   survival curves, were collected from the ComBase database
   (www.combase.cc). Conditions at which selected data used to fit the
   models were generated covered wide ranges that are relevant to the pork
   supply chain. Probabilistic and kinetic models were combined to give
   predictions on the concentration of Salmonella spp. at any stage of the
   pork supply chain under fluctuating pH, a(w) and/or temperature. Models
   were implemented in a user-friendly computing tool freely available from
   http://www.ifr.ac.uk/safety/SalmonellaPredictions/. This program
   provides estimates on the population dynamics of Salmonella spp. at any
   stage of the pork supply chain and its predictive performance has been
   validated in several pork products. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is the etiologic agent
   of paratuberculosis, a chronic granulomatous enteric disease of
   ruminants. MAP detection by faecal culture provides the definitive
   diagnosis of the infection. Automated liquid systems for MAP culture are
   more sensitive and rapid than culture on solid media. but they are
   expensive and require specialised equipment. In this study, a
   non-automated culture method using a modified Middlebrook 7H9 liquid
   medium (7H9+) was compared with Herrold's solid medium (HEYM) and direct
   real-time PCR on dairy cattle faeces. MAP growth in 7H9+ was monitored
   weekly by real-time PCR until the 12th week post-inoculation. The
   analytical sensitivity of the three methods was evaluated using faecal
   samples from a healthy cow spiked with ten-fold dilutions of MAP
   organisms (10(4)-10(-1)) and naturally MAP-infected faeces serially
   diluted 1 to 10 in negative faecal samples. The limits of detection of
   the solid culture and direct real-time PCR were 10(2) and 10(3) MAP/g,
   respectively. In comparison, the 7H9+ culture revealed as few as 1
   MAP/g. A marked reduction in time to detection of the pathogen, compared
   with HEYM culture, was obtained. In addition, the three methods were
   applied to environmental faecal samples collected from a high- and a
   low-prevalence herd. The culture in 7H9+ showed to be the most sensitive
   test in the low-prevalence herd and provided faster results than HEYM.
   In the high-prevalence herd the three methods showed the same
   sensitivity and the real-time PCR had the shortest turnaround time. In
   conclusion, the use of 7H9+ for MAP-detection from cattle faeces
   maximizes diagnostic sensitivity and reduces turnaround time and,
   therefore, could replace culture in solid medium. Hence, we propose a
   two-step protocol for the assessment of MAP faecal excretion based on:
   1) direct real-time PCR on all samples: and 2) inoculation of negative
   samples into 7H9+ and analysis after 3 and, if necessary, 6 weeks by
   real-time PCR. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Intramammary infections are a serious problem for dairy sheep farms, and
   Staphylococcus epidermidis is one of the main etiological agents of
   ovine mastitis. In this work, 131 S. epidermidis isolates, collected
   from 2201 dairy Sarda sheep belonging to 14 flocks with high somatic
   cell count scores, were studied. The flocks were located in diverse
   geographical areas of Sardinia, Italy. The aim of study was to assess
   the susceptibility of isolates to 13 antimicrobial agents, many of which
   are frequently used in mastitis therapy. Oxacillin was used for
   detecting methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) by disk diffusion
   test. Thirty-eight percent of the isolates (n = 50) were resistant to
   penicillin, 7.6\% (n = 10) were resistant to tetracycline, and 2.3\% (n
   = 3) were resistant to both penicillin and tetracycline (PTRSE). Two
   isolates were resistant to five antimicrobials including methicillin.
   Analysis of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) elements
   showed that both MRSE isolates harbored SCCmec type IVa. Based on
   pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing by Smal macrorestriction,
   S. epidermidis isolates were grouped into four clusters at 75\%
   similarity level. The two multi-drug resistant MRSE isolates displayed
   distinct PFGE patters. This study indicates that S. epidermidis isolates
   from sheep milk samples may accumulate resistance markers for different
   antimicrobial agents. Furthermore, the occurrence of VERSE and MRSE
   suggests to adopt adequate hygienic measures when handling animals with
   intramammary infections, in order to prevent spreading VERSE and MRSE
   strains to humans through direct contact and/or consumption of
   contaminated food. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We have identified a clonal complex of Mycobacterium bovis isolated at
   high frequency from cattle in Uganda, Burundi, Tanzania, and Ethiopia.
   We have named this related group of M. bovis strains the African 2 (Af2)
   clonal complex of M. bovis. Af2 strains are defined by a specific
   chromosomal deletion (RDAf2) and can be identified by the absence of
   spacers 3 to 7 in their spoligotype patterns. Deletion analysis of M.
   bovis isolates from Algeria, Mali, Chad, Nigeria, Cameroon, South
   Africa, and Mozambique did not identify any strains of the Af2 clonal
   complex, suggesting that this clonal complex of M. bovis is localized in
   East Africa. The specific spoligotype pattern of the Af2 clonal complex
   was rarely identified among isolates from outside Africa, and the few
   isolates that were found and tested were intact at the RDAf2 locus. We
   conclude that the Af2 clonal complex is localized to cattle in East
   Africa. We found that strains of the Af2 clonal complex of M. bovis
   have, in general, four or more copies of the insertion sequence IS6110,
   in contrast to the majority of M. bovis strains isolated from cattle,
   which are thought to carry only one or a few copies.},

Abstract = {An observational study was designed to assess the bioaccumulation of
   polychlorodibenzodioxins (PCDD) and polychlorodibenzofurans (PCDF),
   polychlorobiphenyls (DL-PCB), and 13 selected polybromodiphenylethers
   (PBDE) in autochthonous pigs reared in the Nebrodi Park of Sicily
   (Italy). Perirenal fat and liver samples were drawn from animals
   representative of three different outdoor farming systems and from wild
   pigs and then analyzed for the chemicals mentioned previously. The
   highest concentrations of PCDD + PCDF and DL-PCB were detected in the
   fat (0.45 and 0.35 pg World Health Organization toxicity equivalents
   {[}WHO-TE] per g of fat base {[}FB], respectively) and livers (12.7 and
   3.28 pg WHO-TE per g FB) of the wild group, whereas the free-ranging
   group showed the lowest levels (0.05 and 0.03 pg WHO-TE per g FB in fat
   and 0.78 and 0.27 pg WHO-TE per g FB in livers). The sum of PBDE
   congeners was highest in wild pigs (0.52 ng/g FB in fat and 5.64 ng/g FB
   in livers) and lowest in the farmed group (0.14 ng/g FB in fat and 0.28
   ng/g FB in livers). The contamination levels in fat and livers of
   outdoor pigs had mean concentration values lower than those levels
   reported for intensively indoor-farmed animals. In wild pigs,
   bioaccumulation was associated with their free grazing in areas
   characterized by bush fires. The results of this study aid to emphasize
   the quality of the environment as a factor to guarantee food safety in
   typical processed pig meat products, specifically from outdoor and
   extensive Nebrodi farming systems.},

Abstract = {TB infection in goats has a virtually worldwide distribution, with
   reports in several countries, including Italy, Bulgaria, France, Spain,
   Great Britain, Germany, USA, Africa, India, Australia, New Zealand, and
   Argentina. According to the latest research, the goat is a highly
   susceptible host for Mycobacterium bovis and, in rarer cases, for M.
   caprae, M. tuberculosis and M. avium. The clinical manifestations of
   infection are quite vague and consist mostly in progressive wasting,
   shaggy appearance of the coat, decreased milk production, anorexia and
   intermittent cough. Despite the apparent kindness of symptoms, the
   pathological lesions are quite severe, with a tendency to generalization
   and development of open forms, with the possibility of spread of
   bacteria through saliva, faeces and aerosol. In order to provide a
   further contribution to knowledge on tuberculosis of the goats, in this
   paper the Authors describe a case of infection by Mycobacterium bovis
   within a farm in Valle d'Aosta, consisting of 185 goats and 20 cattle;
   about the diagnostic investigations carried out during the management of
   the outbreak, special attention is reserved to the pathological and
   histological pictures observed in 145 animals necropsied at the local
   slaughterhouses and the Aosta Section of the Istituto Zooprofilattico
   Sperimentale.},

Abstract = {In the present study, a Taqman allelic discrimination assay based on
   three SNPs of the TPI gene is described. It was used as a differential
   diagnostic tool to detect blackleg and malignant edema. Sudden deaths of
   grazing ruminants, such as cattle, sheep and goats, which show clinical
   signs related to hyperacute infective processes, encouraged the
   development of a rapid and precise diagnostic molecular method. Specific
   primers and probes for Clostridium septicum and Clostridium chauvoei
   were designed on the basis of the TPI gene sequence. The multiplex PCR
   was tested on the DNA of a total of 57 strains, including 24 Clostridium
   chauvoei. 20 Clostridium septicum, 1 Bacillus anthracis and 12 other
   Clostridium spp. The DNA samples from Clostridium chauvoei and
   Clostridium septicum strains were amplified. Amplification of other DNA
   samples was not observed, with the exception of Clostridium tertium,
   which showed a weak positive signal. To avoid misdiagnosis, a
   confirmatory assay based on a Sybr green real time PCR was proposed. The
   authors confirmed the efficacy and the specificity of the test used in
   this study, which proved to be a useful tool for the diagnosis of
   clostridiosis that are often diagnosed using only traditional tools. (C)

Abstract = {Modern adjuvants should induce strong and balanced immune responses, and
   it is often desirable to induce specific types of immunity. As an
   example, efficient Th1-immunity-inducing adjuvants are highly in demand.
   Such adjuvants promote good cell-mediated immunity against subunit
   vaccines that have low immunogenicity themselves. The development of
   such adjuvants may take advantage of the increased knowledge of the
   molecular mechanisms and factors controlling these responses. However,
   knowledge of such molecular details of immune mechanisms is relatively
   scarce for species other than humans and laboratory rodents, and in
   addition, there are special considerations pertaining to the use of
   adjuvants in veterinary animals, such as production and companion
   animals. With a focus on veterinary animals, this review highlights a
   number of approaches being pursued, including cytokines, CpG
   oligonucleotides, microparticles and liposomes.},

Abstract = {The study was carried out in cattle kept at 11 livestock experiment
   stations of Punjab by using single comparative cervical intradermal
   tuberculin (SCCIT) test. Sahiwal was the main breed kept at these farms.
   Sixty three percent of animals were between four and 10 years of age.
   Seventy-six percent of animals weighed between 300 and 400 kg and 66\%
   produced 5-101 of milk/day. Animals other than cattle were present at
   about 64\% of these farms. The positive SCCIT test was recorded in 7.6\%
   of animals at the 11 farms. However, the prevalence of tuberculosis
   varied from 2.0\% to 19.3\% at these farms. Bivariate frequency analysis
   showed that the chances of a positive SCCIT test were higher in older
   animals, in cattle with higher number of calving and those produced up
   to 18001 of milk. However, the chances of positive SCCIT test decreases
   with further increase in milk production. Results of bivariate and/or
   multivariate logistic regression analysis after controlling for the farm
   showed a significant association of age of cattle, numbers of calving,
   total milk produced, per day milk, lactation length, presence of sheep
   at the farm and total numbers of animals at the farm with a positive
   SCCIT test. It can be concluded from the study that herd prevalence of
   tuberculosis was 100\%, while animal prevalence was about 8\% at these
   farms. The stronger risk factors identified by logistic analysis were
   the age of cattle, numbers of calving, total milk produced and lactation
   length, while the presence of sheep at the farm has protective effect.

Abstract = {In small ruminant livestock, ocular diseases cause severe economical
   losses due to costs of therapies and difficulties to manage blind
   animals to pasture. In Italy, in the last years, among ocular pathogens,
   a recently classified mycoplasma species, Mycoplasma conjunctivae, is
   responsible of several outbreaks of infectious keratoconjunctivitis
   (IKC). The disease infects only ocular tissues causing very severe
   symptoms ( and death for starvation) in wild ruminants; in domestic
   livestock it occurs in lactating and weakening animals and is normally
   characterised by benign course and complete recovering of the vision in
   few weeks. Laboratory confirmation is mainly based on bio-molecular
   methods (PCR, DGGE) which reduce the time needed for diagnosis and
   overcome all difficulties relate to isolation procedures. Prophylaxis
   concerns a quarantine period for all new introduced animals and it seems
   to be the only measure applicable against the spreading of the disease.
   Control is normally performed by utilization of eye drops with
   antibiotic or ointments are helpful to resolve the clinical
   conjunctivitis.},

Abstract = {A new method for the calculation of a centrality measure (Disease Flow
   Centrality, DFC), which takes into account temporal dynamics of
   livestock movement networks, is proposed. The method is based on a
   network traversal algorithm which represents an epidemic process more
   realistically compared with traditional graph traversal algorithms used
   in the calculation of centrality measures on static networks. The new
   approach was tested on networks generated from all the registered
   movements of cattle in Italy in the years 2007, 2008 and 2009 and the
   results were compared to those obtained by classical centrality
   measures. The results show that DFC values often differ substantially
   from those of other centrality measures and that these DFC values tend
   to be more unstable in time. The DFC offers several advantages for
   assessing risk and vulnerability of specific holdings and of an entire
   network, using recent movement data from national livestock databases.
   Some examples also indicate how the basic approach in the DFC
   calculation could be expanded into a more complex epidemic model by
   incorporating weights and how it could be combined with a geo-spatial
   perspective. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Several studies carried out in the last years have demonstrated the
   presence of a wide range of contaminants in some areas of the Venice
   Lagoon. Many of these contaminants are able to drive free radical
   reactions, which lead to oxidative stress and can potentially affect
   fish health. In the present study, oxidative stress biomarkers were
   examined in three different sites (Porto Marghera, Val di Brenta and
   Caroman) of the Venice Lagoon and their levels monitored in
   Zosterisessor ophiocephalus, one of the most common fish species present
   in the lagoon. Schmorl's staining revealed the presence of
   melanomacrophage centres in spleen and head kidney, and the highest
   number of melanomacrophage centres was observed in the animals sampled
   at the Porto Marghera (Porto Marghera vs Val di brenta and Caroman: p <
   0.01). The cellular localization of HNE and NT, investigated through an
   immunohistochemical approach, showed that immunopositivity was mainly
   localized in melanomacrophage centres of spleen and kidney. It is
   relevant that the animals of the detoxified control group did not
   exhibit any immunoreactivity.
   By Western blot, the antibodies against HNE and NT recognized in the
   liver polypeptides damaged by oxidative stress with molecular weights
   under 66 kDa. Comparing the relative densities, animals from the Val di
   Brenta site exhibited the lowest levels of HNE adducts (p < 0.05).
   whereas animals from the Porto Marghera site exhibited the highest
   levels of NT adducts (p < 0.05). MDA levels, measured
   spectrophotometrically by TBARS assay did not exhibit any statistical
   difference among sites. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Characterization of the Interferon-alpha Response of Pigs to the Weaning

Abstract = {The interferon (IFN)-alpha response of pigs to the stressing event of
   early weaning was investigated in a field trial. All the animals under
   study remained healthy and tested negative for common viral infections.
   However, a low-titered IFN-alpha response was detected in many sera by a
   bioassay on Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells on day +6 after
   weaning. Porcine IFN-alpha was unambiguously identified by a
   neutralization assay on a pool of IFN-alpha-positive sera. By gel
   filtration chromatography, the antiviral activity of sera on MDBK cells
   could be traced back to 3 components of apparent molecular mass 27/18/ <
   14 kDa. Additional components of apparent molecular mass 58 and 41 kDa
   were revealed by ELISA in Nonidet P-40 lysates of peripheral blood
   mononuclear cells (PBMC). Also, many pigs tested positive in flow
   cytometry assays on PBMC for intracellular IFN-alpha. The expression of
   porcine IFN-alpha genes was investigated by reverse transcriptase (RT)
   real-time polymerase chain reaction at days -1, +6, and +12 with regard
   to weaning in PBMC of 9 piglets. On days -1 and +12, IFN A5, A6, A12, as
   well as (in fewer pigs) A1, A7, A11, and A2 genes were shown to be
   expressed. On the contrary, none of the above genes was expressed on day
   +6, when plenty of pig sera were IFN-alpha-positive. Our results
   indicate that weaning causes the release of IFN-alpha and the transient
   shut-off of the corresponding gene transcriptions in PBMC.
   Interestingly, only IFN A9 gene transcription was shown in vitro to be
   virus induction-dependent.},

   Snail1 transcription factor is a critical mediator of hepatic stellate
   cell activation following hepatic injury. Am J Physiol Gastrointest
   Liver Physiol 300: G316-G326, 2011. First published November 18, 2010;
   doi:10.1152/ajpgi.00141.2010.-Following liver injury, the wound-healing
   process is characterized by hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation from
   the quiescent fat-storing phenotype to a highly proliferative
   myofibroblast-like phenotype. Snail1 is a transcription factor best
   known for its ability to trigger epithelial-mesenchymal transition, to
   influence mesoderm formation during embryonic development, and to favor
   cell survival. In this study, we evaluated the expression of Snail1 in
   experimental and human liver fibrosis and analyzed its role in the HSC
   transdifferentiation process. Liver samples from patients with liver
   fibrosis and from mice treated by either carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) or
   thioacetamide (TAA) were evaluated for mRNA expression of Snail1. The
   transcription factor expression was investigated by immunostaining and
   real-time quantitative RTPCR (qRT-PCR) on in vitro and in vivo activated
   murine HSC. Snail1 knockdown studies on cultured HSC and on CCl4-treated
   mice were performed by adenoviral delivery of short-hairpin RNA;
   activation-related genes were quantitated by real-time qRT-PCR and
   Western blotting. Snail1 mRNA expression resulted upregulated in murine
   experimental models of liver injury and in human hepatic fibrosis. In
   vitro studies showed that Snail1 is expressed by HSC and that its
   transcription is augmented in in vitro and in vivo activated HSC
   compared with quiescent HSC. At the protein level, we could observe the
   nuclear translocation of Snail1 in activated HSC. Snail1 knockdown
   resulted in the downregulation of activation-related genes both in vitro
   and in vivo. Our data support a role for Snail1 transcription factor in
   the hepatic wound-healing response and its involvement in the HSC
   transdifferentiation process.},

Abstract = {A survey was performed on ornamental fish imported into the EU to detect
   viral agents belonging to the genus Ranavirus. The objective was to gain
   knowledge of the potential for these systemic iridoviruses to gain entry
   into the EU via international trade in ornamental fish. A total of 208
   pooled samples, representing 753 individual fish, were tested. The
   samples included 13 orders and 37 families, originating from different
   countries and continents. Tissues from fish that died during or just
   after transport were collected and examined by standard virological
   techniques in epithelioma papulosum cyprini cells, by transmission
   electron microscopy and by PCR for the detection of the major capsid
   protein and DNA polymerase gene sequences of ranaviruses. Virus was
   isolated from nine fish species but ranavirus was not identified in
   those samples. The results suggest that ranaviruses are not highly
   prevalent in ornamental fish imported into the EU.},

Abstract = {Increasingly effective vaccination strategies are needed to counteract
   the high incidence of contagious diseases associated with intensive
   swine breeding. Recombinant viral vaccines are a promising new avenue in
   this direction. Key features of viral vectors suitable for
   immunoprophylaxis are safety, ease of manipulation and the ability to
   replicate in a variety of hosts. Most of the above requirements are met
   by bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4), a non-pathogenic dsDNA virus capable
   of infecting a broad range of cell types in vitro. Here we report the
   results of an exploratory study using an engineered BoHV-4 virus
   (eBoHV-4) expressing two unrelated glycoprotein antigens from bovine
   viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), to assess
   the potential of recombinant BoHV-4 as a self-adjuvanted immunogen in
   pigs. Free eBoHV-4 virions and virions preloaded into homologous swine
   adipose-derived stromal cells (SADSC) were tested. Neither virus
   formulation elicited neutralizing anti-BoHV-4 antibodies, nor any
   disease symptom, yet both induced specific immune responses against the
   heterologous antigens. However, a much earlier (18 vs 28 days
   post-infection) and more robust neutralizing response against BVDV and

Abstract = {Border disease virus belongs to the Pestivirus genus, within the family
   Flaviviridae. Genetic analysis of pestiviruses isolated from sheep in
   continental Europe have led to the proposal that BDV isolates are
   segregated into at least seven clusters. In 2005 the molecular analysis
   of an Italian caprine BDV strain provided evidence for the presence of
   an atypical pestivirus, which may represent the first member of a
   putative novel pestivirus sub-group. To further build on this study,
   ovine pestivirus strains were isolated from small ruminant flocks and
   characterized both genetically and antigenically. A defined section of
   the 5'UTR and the complete N-pro coding region were amplified and used
   for phylogenetic analysis. This revealed that these pestiviruses belong
   to the BDV species but differed significantly from all previously
   described ovine pestiviruses providing evidence for the presence of a
   novel genetic group.
   Four of the five isolates were also typed antigenically with a panel of
   pestivirus specific mAbs directed against NS2/3, E-rns and E2 proteins.
   The four isolates reacted with a distinct set of mAbs, in particular
   against the BDV-E2 and the BDV-E-rns epitopes. The isolates were greatly
   reactive for E-rns and NS2/3 mAbs, which are otherwise typical for
   BVDV-2, and one E2 mAb that typically stains BVDV-1.
   The Italian pestiviruses analysed in this study, according to their
   antigenic and genetic properties, clustered into a novel phylogenetic
   group, that we propose to term BDV-7. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Quantitative assessment of the probability of bluetongue virus
   overwintering by horizontal transmission: application to Germany},
Journal = {VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {42},
Month = {JAN 11},
Abstract = {Even though bluetongue virus (BTV) transmission is apparently
   interrupted during winter, bluetongue outbreaks often reappear in the
   next season (overwintering). Several mechanisms for BTV overwintering
   have been proposed, but to date, their relative importance remain
   unclear. In order to assess the probability of BTV overwintering by
   persistence in adult vectors, ruminants (through prolonged viraemia) or
   a combination of both, a quantitative risk assessment model was
   developed. Furthermore, the model allowed the role played by the
   residual number of vectors present during winter to be examined, and the
   effect of a proportion of Culicoides living inside buildings (endophilic
   behaviour) to be explored. The model was then applied to a real
   scenario: overwintering in Germany between 2006 and 2007. The results
   showed that the limited number of vectors active during winter seemed to
   allow the transmission of BTV during this period, and that while
   transmission was favoured by the endophilic behaviour of some
   Culicoides, its effect was limited. Even though transmission was
   possible, the likelihood of BTV overwintering by the mechanisms studied
   seemed too low to explain the observed re-emergence of the disease.
   Therefore, other overwintering mechanisms not considered in the model
   are likely to have played a significant role in BTV overwintering in
   Germany between 2006 and 2007.},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {175},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {109-112},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {Seven farms, two in Central Italy and five in Southern Italy, were
   visited for the presence of larvae-infested wounds. Ninety-six (3\%) out
   of 3129 sheep examined had a traumatic myiasis with a very high
   percentage of infested animals found only in a farm (10.5\%). Wounds
   were mainly localized on the vulva and prepuce. Infested animals were
   restless, anxious, and reluctant to graze. None of the 10 goats in one
   infested flock had wounds, whereas a shepherd dog from another flock
   presented a wound on the ear. All the larvae and adults reared from them
   in the laboratory were identified as Wohlfahrtia magnifica (Schiner,
   1862) (Diptera, Sarcophagidae). The cases presented here are the first
   clinical cases of wohlfahrtiosis in sheep and dogs reported in Italy,
   and indicate that this myiasis is endemic in this country. A wider
   epidemiological investigation on the prevalence, incidence and
   seasonality of W. magnifica infestation of Italian W. magnifica
   population/s would be useful to understand its geographical provenience
   and the likely risk for its spreading throughout Italy and other
   non-endemic areas. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The origin of the outbreaks of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP)
   in Italy between 1990 and 1993 were never successfully traced mainly due
   to the close similarity of the strains of the causative mycoplasma,
   Mycoplasma mycoides subspecies mycoides small colony (MmmSC) and the
   limitations of the typing tools available at the time. In this report we
   examined a selection of strains isolated in the Veneto and Friuli
   Venezia Giulia regions of Italy by the highly discriminatory variable
   number tandem repeat (VNTR) procedure. Results were analysed for the
   first time by a capillary sequencer-based method. It was shown that all
   the MmmSC strains were genetically very similar and all belonged to the
   same profiles for both VNTR 4 and 5. This suggests that the outbreaks in
   Northern Eastern Italy, which eventually spread to other parts of the
   country, originated from a single source. Crown Copyright (C) 2010

Abstract = {Species ranked within the genus Baylisascaris (Ascaridida, Ascarididae)
   have been implicated in clinical and subclinical intestinal diseases in
   their natural hosts (e.g., raccoons and bears) as well as in
   life-threatening larva migrans syndromes in a number of incidental
   hosts, including humans. Following the diagnosis of Baylisascaris
   transfuga infestation in two captive polar bears, living in the zoo park
   of Pistoia (Tuscany, Italy), nematodes (n = 300; both sexes) have been
   characterized by morphological and molecular methods by sequencing and
   analysing ribosomal (large ribosomal DNA (28S) and internal transcribed
   spacer region 1 and 2 (ITSs)) and mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase
   subunit 1 (cox1) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2 (cox2)) target
   regions. In addition, seven faecal samples were collected from the
   animal enclosure and submitted to copromicroscopic and molecular
   examination. All nematodes were morphologically identified as B.
   transfuga and their main distinctive features are here presented. No
   variation in size and nucleotide polymorphisms was detected within each
   target sequence among all samples analysed. These data contribute to
   facilitate an accurate diagnosis of this little known nematode
   infestation in order to apply appropriate anthelmintic strategies. (C)

Abstract = {The distribution of virulence properties in 142 strains of Aeromonas
   isolated from diarrhoeic patients, food and surface water in Italy and
   identified by biochemical and molecular methods was investigated. The
   virulence properties studied were the presence of genes for the
   aerolysin (aerA). heat-stable cytotonic enterotoxin (ay.). heat-labile
   cytotonic enterotoxin (alt), cytotoxic enterotoxin (act); and
   cytotoxicity for Vero cells and adhesion on Hep-2 cells. A. hydrophila
   and A. caviae were the species most commonly isolated from clinical and
   environmental samples (9/30; 30.0\% and 5/27; 18.5\%, respectively)
   while mesophilic A. salmonicida was most common in food samples (19/80;
   23.7\%). Out of 142 strains, 86 (60.6\%) were positive for at least one
   of the virulence properties. All the toxin genes were present in 4/18
   (22.3\%) of clinical strains. Most of the food isolates (54/55; 98.2\%)
   were cytotoxic and most of the environmental strains (12/13; 92.3\%)
   were adhesive. The aerA gene was present in most toxigenic strains
   (72/86; 83.7\%), irrespective of their origin. The growth temperature
   affected the expression of cytotoxicity and adhesivity. Aeromonas
   strains from food and surface water frequently had toxin gene patterns
   similar to those of clinical strains and expressed virulence properties
   at human body temperature. These findings indicate that aeromonads have
   the potential to cause human illness and confirm the role of food and
   water as vehicles for Aeromonas diseases. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {A total of 47 Listeria monocytogenes strains isolated in a survey of
   cheeses sampled from retail outlets were characterised. Five cheeses
   (Gorgonzola, Taleggio, Asiago, Crescenza and Brie) were chosen from the
   most popular soft and semi-soft cheeses consumed in Italy and most
   commonly contaminated with L. monocytogenes. The serotype and antibiotic
   resistance pattern were determined for each strain and their
   macrorestriction profile was analysed with pulsed-field gel
   electrophoresis (PFGE). The main serotypes detected were 1/2a (76.6\%)
   and 1/2c (21.3\%). Serotype 1/2b was found in only one sample. A total
   of 97.9\% of strains were resistant to oxacillin (OX), 80.9\% to
   lincomycin (L) and 78.7\% to clindamycin (CC). Of these strains, 17\%
   were found to be resistant to two antibiotics (OX-CC or OX-L) while
   70.2\% were resistant to three antibiotics (OX-CC-L). No strains were
   susceptible to all the compounds tested. A combined analysis of the
   macrorestriction profiles AscI and ApaI identified eleven pulsotypes
   divided into three clusters. Two pulsotypes predominated, accounting for
   57.4\% and 21.3\% of the isolated strains. Analysis of the PFGE profiles
   did not reveal any correlation between pulsotype and type of cheese,
   producer or retail outlet. A temporal analysis revealed that one
   pulsotype was persistent throughout the study period, with the exception
   of August and September, in which time a different pulsotype was
   detected. This variability suggests the influence of factors affecting
   the dynamics of the contamination of these products. Large-scale studies
   could help clarify this phenomenon.},

Abstract = {The aim of the current study was to evaluate total serum protein
   concentration measured by the biuret reaction as well as albumin and
   globulin protein fractions determined by agarose gel electrophoresis.
   These data were used to establish reference intervals in dairy cows of
   different ages. Blood was collected from 111 clinically healthy Modicana
   dairy cows by means of jugular venipuncture. Reference intervals (mean
   standard deviation) were determined for total protein (67.54 +/- 11.53
   g/l), albumin (31.86 +/- 4.60 g/l), alpha(1)-globulin (5.77 +/- 2.20
   g/l), alpha(2)-globulin (5.84 1.90 g/l), beta-globulin (7.46 +/- 1.94
   g/l), and gamma-globulin (16.73 +/- 4.54 g/l) concentrations as well as
   for albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio (0.88 +/- 0.43). Values from 2-, 3-,
   4-, 5-, and 6-year-old cows were compared statistically. One-way
   analysis of variance showed age-related differences for alpha-globulin
   and beta-globulin fractions only. The results of the current study
   provide reference intervals for total protein concentration as well as
   albumin and globulin protein fractions in 2- to 6-year-old dairy cows.},

Abstract = {Atypical scrapie is an ubiquitous but rare disease that seems not to be
   contagious under natural conditions. Currently only genetic
   susceptibility is recognised as an important risk factor. However the
   application of different diagnostic tests and the different intensity of
   the surveillance applied may influence the occurrence of the disease.
   The objective of this study is to evaluate if the differences in the
   intensity levels of surveillance can partially explain the differences
   in the occurrence of the disease. We described the distribution by
   province of the incidence rate observed by means of active surveillance,
   the percentage of farms tested by a diagnostic test able to identify
   atypical scrapie and the percentage of animals with the allele AHQ used
   as a proxy of high susceptibility. All these three variables are
   characterized by a geographical heterogeneity. In some cases, provinces
   with a high disease incidence rate coincided with provinces where the
   highest number of farms was tested with the most sensitive test. The
   sensitivity of the surveillance system in detecting the disease played
   an important role to explain the geographical distribution of the
   Italian atypical scrapie. This study indicates that the evaluation of
   the surveillance distribution and of the diagnostic detection capability
   is necessary to describe the real presence of the atypical forms and the
   knowledge of their descriptive epidemiology deserves some re-assessment.},

Abstract = {Prevalence and incidence data obtained from active and passive
   surveillance for scrapie are the relevant information used to describe
   the real distribution of the disease in a country.
   The objective of this study is to compare the ovine classical scrapie
   incidence data at flock-level obtained by the two surveillance systems
   in Italy, in order to assess their relative efficacy.
   We considered the outbreaks of classical sheep scrapie identified in
   Italy by passive surveillance (1995-2008) and active surveillance
   (2002-2008) for each province and we calculated the relative annual
   incidence rate.
   Furthermore, we produced descriptive maps to illustrate, at province
   level, the distribution of the results.
   Data obtained by passive surveillance are characterized by lower values
   and a minor number of provinces involved in the distribution of the
   disease.
   Passive surveillance was able to capture the disease only partially and
   wasn't able to provide additional information in comparison with the
   active system. Moreover where the passive approach performs better this
   is likely attributable to a positive effect of a concomitant active
   surveillance.
   This study indicates that the active surveillance plays a key role in
   effectively detecting and describing the distribution of the disease. In
   order to asses control measures for scrapie, it is important to maintain
   the efficiency of this system and to interpret correctly (e.g. using
   standardized data) its results.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to design a protocol to evaluate sheep milk
   oxidation traits, both in the water soluble and the lipid soluble
   fractions, in order to assess such parameters in a simple and
   inexpensive way. Milk was fractioned as whole milk (WM), skim milk (SM),
   whey (W)) and deproteinated whey (DW). The antioxidant activity (TAC and
   AOP), available sulphydryls (SH), ascorbic acid (AA) and cholesterol
   content were determined, and the degree of antioxidant protection (DAP)
   of cholesterol was calculated. It was shown that current analytical
   methods should not be directly applied to milk, due to turbidity and
   peculiar pH behaviour of caseins. Therefore, samples may need some
   preparative steps before analysis. Proteins were found to account for
   most part of milk antioxidant capacity, with caseins playing the major
   role in milk antioxidant barrier. Such activity could not be attributed
   to available sulfhydryls (i.e. cysteine residues), suggesting a relevant
   contribution of other amino acids. The TAC method could be successfully
   applied for an overall estimation of both water and lipid soluble
   antioxidant activity of milk. However, peculiar classes of antioxidants,
   that are present at low concentrations, such as SH groups and AA may
   need more specific analytical techniques.},

Abstract = {The management of dog behavioural problems requires the expertise of
   professionals such as the veterinary behaviourist. Clinical assessment
   of behavioural disorders allows the veterinary behaviourist to formulate
   a diagnosis and prescribe a behavioural and/or pharmacological therapy.
   The objective of such therapy is to produce a stable change in the
   perception of a stimulus and the resulting emotion, leading to the
   correction of the behavioural problem. It may be crucial to evaluate the
   subject's pathological state in response to the observed symptoms in
   order to identify the functional impairment of the pivotal
   neurotransmitter systems involved in the disorder. This allows selecting
   a suitable pharmacological treatment. In order to implement behavioural
   therapy, the veterinary behaviourist collaborates, where necessary, with
   a team of qualified canine trainers.},

Abstract = {Scrapie is a rare, fatal neurological disease of sheep and goats,
   belonging to the group of Animal Transmissible Spongiform
   Encephalopathies (TSEs). In Italy the disease has been reported since
   1976 and in 1991 the scrapie mandatory reporting was enforced.
   The aim of this work is to study the incidence of scrapie within all the
   outbreaks come out after clinical reporting and affecting sarda sheep
   between 1995 and 2009.
   All farmers were interviewed, using a standardised questionnaire,
   including the number of sheep, classified into three age classes, and
   the number of animals showing scrapie-like symptoms observed during the
   last 12 months prior to confirmation of the disease in the flock. The
   association between scrapie and age class was quantified in terms of
   relative risk (RR). Moreover the year-specific age adjusted incidence
   was calculated to describe the secular trend.
   The mean crude within-flock incidence was 2.06 cases per 100
   animal-years (CI 95\% 1.95-2.18). As expected, in general most farms
   show low rates with the highest incidence affecting the 2 to 4 years old
   animals. The decreasing trend in the incidence deserves further studies:
   it may indicate a real phenomenon or rather may be a collateral effect
   of the improved awareness of farmers, leading to an anticipation of the
   recognition of the disease when the incidence is still very low. However
   the validity of our data, collected through oral interviews, may have
   been negatively influenced by the farmer's inability of recognising the
   disease and recalling the cases.},

Abstract = {Dexamethasone is one of a number of synthetic corticosteroids illegally
   used to promote growth in food-producing animals. Since these low-level
   drug cocktails evade detection by currently available chemical methods,
   simple biological indicators that can aid in laboratory analysis are
   needed. In an attempt to devise an accurate biological method that could
   detect illicit drug treatment in food-producing animals, we
   characterized microscopic morphologic alterations of the thymus in veal
   calves administered low-dose dexamethasone versus control animals. For
   this purpose, 122 male calves were farmed for 6 months in controlled
   condition: 81 animals were orally administered dexamethasone (0.4 mg
   day(-1)) for 20 days during the sixth month and the remaining 41 were
   kept as control. Urine samples were collected systematically during the
   treatment period, the suspension period and at the slaughterhouse. All
   animals were slaughtered 10 per day starting from 10 days after the last
   dexamethasone administration and the thymus was sampled for histological
   examination. The difference between the two animal groups was evaluated
   by means of a non-parametric test of hypothesis. No residues were
   detected in the urines collected since the third day after the last
   administration, whereas morphometric analysis of the thoracic thymus
   revealed a significant decrease in the cortex: medulla ratio in the
   treated animals (p<0.0005). We can conclude that this histological
   approach offers encouraging prospects as a screening method to overcome
   current limitations in controlling growth promoter abuse.},

Abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is thought to be an autoimmune T-cell-mediated
   disease directed at myelin antigens of the central nervous system.
   Besides myelin proteins, lipid components of CNS are supposed to play a
   role as antigens for T cells in MS. CD1 is a family of MHC-like
   glycoproteins specialized in capturing and presenting a variety of
   microbial and self lipids and glycolipids to antigen-specific T cells.
   CD1-restricted T cells specific for gangliosides and sulfatide have been
   isolated from subjects with MS and in mice with experimental allergic
   encephalopathy. We genotyped exon 2 of CD1A and CD1E in 205 MS patients
   and 223 unrelated healthy controls and determined their association with
   the presence of anti-ganglioside and anti-sulfatide antibodies. CD1E
   01-01 is associated with a reduced risk of MS (OR 0.54, p=0.001); CD1A
   02-02 (OR 1.99, p=0.012) or CD1E 02-02 (OR 2.45, p=0.000) with an
   increased risk. The combination of the genotypes CD1A 02-02 and CD1E
   02-02 is present in 90.7\% of patients but in only 9.4\% controls (OR
   94.16, p=0.000). CD1A and CD1E polymorphisms contribute to the polygenic
   susceptibility to MS. The functional effects of CD1 polymorphisms are
   unknown, however changes in CD1 alleles may affect numerous
   immunological functions.},

Abstract = {The involvement of protein oxidation in embryonic mortality (EM) has
   been poorly investigated in cows. Advanced oxidation protein products
   (AOPP) are markers of protein oxidation generated by activated
   neutrophils and involved in inflammation. The aim of this work was to
   study AOPP in cow plasma and their relationship with late EM. The
   outcomes of 158 artificial inseminations (AI) were examined in 72 cows,
   which were classified ex post on the basis of blood progesterone and
   pregnancy-associated glycoprotein concentrations and clinical
   confirmation of pregnancy into the following categories: (1) positive
   (AI+, resulted in pregnancy, n = 58), (2) negative (AI-, did not result
   in pregnancy, n 86) and (3) embryonic mortality (EM, n 14). Plasma
   protein fractions, malondialdehyde (MDA), total glutathione and AOPP
   were measured at AI (Day 0) and on Days 15, 28, 35, 45 and 60. MDA was
   significantly higher in EM than AI+ and AI- animals on Day 45, and than
   AI+ animals on Day 60 (P<0.05). Mean plasma AOPP concentrations were
   significantly higher in the EM group (P<0.01) and the ratio of AOPP :
   albumin was significantly higher in the EM group on Days 15, 28, 45 and
   60 (P<0.05). Based on the temporal pattern of the AOPP : albumin ratio,
   we propose that oxidative stress is implicated in and may possibly be a
   cause of EM.},

   consumers for game meat with high added value and favourable nutritional
   properties is noticeable (Hoffman and Wiklund, 2006). Nevertheless,
   targeted measures to assure game meat hygiene are still lacking in
   Italy, and much work is needed to convince hunters and consumers in
   general of the importance of this topic. This contribution summarises
   various complementary approaches to game meat hygiene, as initiated in
   the territory of the province Belluno, in the Italian Eastern Alps, i.e.
   the centre of the Dolomites, where red deer, roe deer, chamois, mouflon
   and wild boar are hunted.},

Abstract = {PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs levels exceeding the legislation limits were
   detected in bovine milk and meat samples collected in Piedmont region
   (Valsusa valley) between 2004 and 2007. Data coming from risk-based
   surveillance carried out between 2004 and 2007 and data from the
   national residue plan were used to design two different studies: a
   fingerprint study and a spatial study. The aim of this work was to
   assess whether the contamination in milk and meat was consistent with a
   common source or different sources.
   1. Fingerprints study. Seventy samples of milk and 68 samples of muscle
   were considered, of which respectively 45 and 23 coming from Valsusa
   whereas the remaining samples obtained through the national residue plan
   in other Italian regions. Cluster and principal component analyses was
   performed to identify chemical profiles based on congeners'
   distribution.
   2. Spatial study. Data of concentration values of PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs in
   the bulk milk from 27 herds, sampled in a 4-year period (2004-2007) were
   matched to each georeferenced land parcel used for fodder production.
   The cluster analysis applied to values in milk showed two main clusters
   by geographical location; a similar pattern was obtained for meat
   samples and also when carrying out the analysis on DL-PCBs data.
   Choropleth maps obtained through the spatial interpolation technique
   applied to either PCDD/Fs or DL-PCBs indicated the highest level of
   pollution geographically juxtaposed to the steel plant location
   The results of both the studies support the hypothesis of a common
   source contamination.},

Abstract = {Objective: Partial genome sequences were determined and subjected to
   comparative analyses from two fish herpesviruses (HVs). Acipenserid
   (Aci) HV-2, originating from the white sturgeon (Acipenser
   transmontanus), and ictalurid (Ic) HV-2, isolated from the black
   bullhead (Ameiurus melas), are recently approved species of the genus
   Ictalurivirus of the family Alloherpesviridae. Methods: An almost
   8,000-base-pair fragment, spanning between the genes of the DNA
   polymerase and the ATPase subunit of the terminase, was sequenced from
   each virus. Results: The size, position and orientation of 2 partial and
   3 full open reading frames, contained in the studied genome fragment,
   proved to be similar to their counterparts in IcHV-1, the type species
   of the genus Ictalurivirus. Thus, a well-conserved genus-specific gene
   block was identified. In the members of two other genera (Cyprinivirus
   and Batrachovirus) of the family Alloherpesviridae, no such gene block
   could be found; the location and orientation of the homologous genes
   showed significant divergence. Conclusion: The results of phylogenetic
   calculations were in good agreement with the genome arrangements
   inasmuch as AciHV-2, IcHV-1 and -2 are monophyletic and separated from
   the lineages of the other two genera. The new sequence enabled the
   inclusion of a hitherto unassigned HV, that of the Australian pilchard,
   into a phylogenetic calculation. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {In managing risks associated with the human consumption of honey, all
   sectors of the production chain must be considered, including the
   primary production phase. Although the introduction of the Hazard
   Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) system has not been made
   compulsory for purposes of quality and safety control in farming
   operations, European legislation makes many references to the key role
   of primary production in food safety management and the HACCP system has
   been indicated as the preferred tool to ensure that consumers are
   provided with safe foods. This article describes a systematic
   HACCP-based approach to identifying, preventing and controlling food
   safety hazards occurring in primary apicultural production. This
   approach serves as a useful tool for beekeepers, food business
   operators, veterinary advisors, and for Food and Veterinary Official
   Control Bodies in their planning and conducting of audits and for
   establishing priorities for the evaluation of training programmes in the
   apicultural sector.},

Abstract = {Benzoic acid and its salts are commonly used additives in the food
   industry. Their use is not allowed in dairy products even though they
   can be found naturally. In this work, 100 cheese samples were tested to
   establish the maximum concentration that can be considered as
   ``natural{''} and, therefore, permitted in cheeses. Analyses were
   carried out by a validated ion chromatography method and ``positive{''}
   samples were confirmed by two other HPLC methods. Benzoic acid
   concentrations higher than the method LOQ (8.8 mg kg(-1)) were found in
   18 samples, ranging from 11.3 to 28.7 mg kg(-1), with a mean value of
   20.5mg kg(-1). Taking into account the distribution of benzoic acid
   concentrations observed in ``positive{''} samples, it is plausible to
   estimate a maximum admissible limit of 40.0 mg kg(-1) for benzoic acid
   in cheese. Below this value, samples can be considered ``compliant{''}.},

Abstract = {The efficiency of management of public health emergencies is improved by
   quick, exaustive and standardized information flow of data on disease
   outbreaks. The efficiency of surveillance systems and disease control or
   eradication programmes is increased by using specific software for data
   analysis and collection.
   In this context, the National Information System for the Notification of
   Outbreaks of Animal Diseases (SIMAN) was designed and developed to
   collect and share outbreaks notifications data in real time by using the
   World Wide Web. The system is part of the e-Government process that
   involves all public administrations of the European Union (EU) and
   refers to the use of information and communication technologies for the
   digital processing of documents in order to obtain simplification and
   interoperability of administrative procedures through the Internet.
   Epitrace is a useful web application based on the Social Network
   Analysis (SNA) and on network epidemiological models. This software has
   been integrated in the BDN and gives the possibility of assessing the
   risk associated to holdings on the basis of their trade patterns and to
   target better risk management measures in case of an outbreak.},

Abstract = {In Italy in the frame of active surveillance of Scrapie six different
   rapid tests have been used leading to the identification of both
   classical and atypical Scrapie cases. Despite all the 69 Italian
   atypical cases (found mostly in sheep) were identified by one rapid test
   (Biorad TESeE), the assumption that the different diagnostic kits used
   in surveillance of TSEs were equally able to identify the atypical form
   was investigated. In particular, we wanted to check whether the number
   of animals tested by some of the tests could have been so small as to be
   consistent with the lack of identified cases of the disease, assuming
   equal diagnostic sensitivity. Using regression models to compare each
   test with Biorad TESeE, only the small number of IDEXX tests carried out
   is consistent with the identification of zero AS cases.},

Abstract = {Prions are misfolded proteins that are infectious and naturally

   Prion shedding routes have been shown to be modified by inflammation in

   scrapie and lentiviral mastitis secrete prions into the milk and infect
   nearly 90\% of naive suckling lambs. Thus, lentiviruses may enhance
   prion transmission, conceivably sustaining prion infections in flocks
   for generations. This study also indicates a risk of prion spread to
   sheep and potentially to other animals through dietary exposure to
   pooled sheep milk or milk products.},

Volume = {80},

Pages = {331-336},
Abstract = {The aim of this study was to provide a description of the first epidemic
   of bluetongue and the first survey on midges of the genus Culicoides in
   Croatia. Clinical signs were firstly observed on November 2001 in sheep
   in Konavle, Dubrovnik - Neretva County. During this epizootic the
   overall sheep morbidity and mortality were 5.2\% (95\% confidence
   interval (c.i.), 4.1-6.6\%) and 2.29\% (95\% c.i., 1.6-3.3\%),
   respectively. After the outbreak, 3,318 scrum samples of ruminants from
   53 villages of the Dubrovnik - Neretva County were examined for
   bluetongue virus (BTV) antibodies by competitive enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (cELISA). In forty nine (92.45\%, 95\% c.i.,
   82.11-96.92\%) of the 53 villages, animals with antibodies against
   bluetongue virus were found. In particular, a total of 178 cattle
   (49.86\%, 95\% c.i., 44.7-55.0\%), 174 sheep (13.72\%, 95\% c.i.,
   11.9-15.7\%) and 270 goats (15.95\%, 95\% c.i., 14.3-17.8\%) were
   seropositive. Antibodies to bluetongue virus serotype 9 were detected in
   212 positive sera by serum neutralization test. The percentage of
   positive animals decreased (P > 0.05) from the east to the west
   suggesting a possible east westward spreading of BTV infection. Fourteen
   light-trap midge collections from seven different sites were examined.
   Of the 4872 Culicoides spp. collected, 4,492 (92\%, 95\% c.i.,
   91.4-92.9\%) of them belonged to the species of Obsoletus complex. This
   study showed for the first time that a pathogenic strain of BTV-9,
   probably from Montenegro, entered Croatia causing disease and death in
   local sheep and that C. obsoletus and C. scoticus were likely the major
   vectors of infection.},

   chromatographic method with fluorimetric detection and postcolumn
   o-phtalaldehyde derivatization was used for a monitoring of 100 samples
   (8 flours, 21 corn-meal, 16 snacks, 7 maize samples, 13 gluten-free
   products, and 35 corn-flakes) bought in local supermarkets during the
   years 2008 and 2009. The presence of both fumonisins B1 and B2, at a
   concentration higher than 15 mu g/kg, was observed in all samples of
   corn-meal and maize-flour, in 75\% of snacks, in 57\% of maize samples,
   in 54\% of gluten-free products, and in 29\% of corn-flakes. A total of
   7 samples including 4 corn-meals, 2 maize-flours, and 1 maize showed a
   value exceeding the maximum level fixed in the Regulation 1126/2007/EC;
   no positive sample was observed in corn-flakes, snacks, and gluten-free
   foods. Fumonisins contamination, on the whole range of maize-based food
   products analyzed, emphasizes the need of improve agricultural
   practices, and increase official control and monitoring studies.},

Abstract = {Verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) O26 is an emergent
   pathotype that has caused an increasing number of sporadic cases and
   outbreaks of gastroenteritis, hemorrhagic colitis, and hemolytic uremic
   syndrome in the United States and Europe. Many cases are associated with
   the consumption of milk and undercooked or fermented meats. The stx(2)
   strains of VTEC O26 seem to be more likely to cause human infections
   than isolates expressing only stx(1). The isolation and identification
   of VTEC O26 from foods is labor intensive and time-consuming. We
   developed a multiplex PCR (M-PCR) assay for the identification and
   characterization of E. coli O26 VTEC and its detection in raw milk and
   ground beef. The method is based on the amplification of the wzx,
   stx(1), and stx(2) genes for the simultaneous detection of the O26
   antigen and verocytotoxin types 1 and 2. This M-PCR assay had a
   sensitivity of 10(8) CFU/ml when applied to a bacterial suspension and
   of 10(6) CFU/ml or g when applied to both inoculated milk and minced
   beef samples. This M-PCR assay also was highly specific, and results
   were consistently negative for negative controls (nonpathogenic E. coli
   strains, uninoculated milk and beef samples, and samples inoculated with
   the nontarget microorganisms). This method could be used for the rapid
   detection of E. coli O26 VTEC from foods and for the rapid
   identification and characterization of clinical and environmental
   isolates.},

Abstract = {In this study, chemical composition, physicochemical properties and
   bioactivity of two essential oils of Rosmarinus officinalis extracted
   from plant material with different drying treatments against Apis
   mellifera, Varroa destructor and Paenibacillus larvae were assessed. The
   lethal concentration 50 (LC50) for mites and bees was estimated using a
   complete exposure method test. The broth microdilution method was
   followed in order to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations
   (MICs) of the essential oils against P. larvae. Physicochemical
   properties were similar in both the essential oils, but the percentage
   of components showed certain differences according to their drying
   treatment. beta-Myrcene and 1,8-cineole were the main constituents in
   the oils. The LC50 for complete exposure method at 24, 48 and 72 h was
   minor for mites exposed to R. officinalis essential oil dried in oven
   conditions. MIC values were 700-800 mu g mL(-1) and 1200 mu g mL(-1) for
   R. officinalis dried in air and oven conditions, respectively. The
   results reported in this research show that oil toxicity against V.
   destructor and P. larvae differed depending on the drying treatment of
   the plant material before the distillation of essential oil.},

Abstract = {Several zoonotic agents that infect wildlife may be transmitted to
   humans through contaminated game meat. Toxoplasma gondii and Trichinella
   spp. infect the muscular tissue at some stage of their biological cycle
   and consequently contaminate meat, while enteric bacteria (e.g.
   Salmonella spp., verocytotoxic Escherichia coli (VTEC), Yersinia
   enterocolitica) may contaminate the carcase after the animal's death
   when the intestine is ruptured by shot pellets or during evisceration.
   Gutting and skinning of carcases may lead to contamination of humans
   with Mycobacterium bovis, Brucella spp., and Francisella tularensis, the
   etiological agents of bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis and tularaemia,
   respectively. We report here the occurrence of the above mentioned
   organisms over a 5-year period in some species of wild mammals of
   Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna, northern Italy. Trichinellae were recovered
   in 0.15\% and 0.13\% of samples from red foxes and wild boars,
   respectively. Antibodies to T. gondii were detected in a percentage
   ranging from 23.3\% to 33.3\% of wild ruminants and wild boars, and the
   parasite was also directly detected in European hares. Several serotypes
   of Salmonella spp. were recovered from cervids, red foxes and wild boars
   with prevalences from 1.46\% to 18.7\%. Faecal samples from roe deer
   tested negative for VTEC, while Y. enterocolitica was detected in about
   8\% samples from roe deer and from a few wild boars. M. bovis was rarely
   recovered from red deer and red foxes, and occasionally from wild boar,
   where M. microti, another species belonging to the Mycobacterium
   tuberculosis complex, occurred much more frequently. Antibodies to
   Brucella spp. were very rarely detected only in European hares, while F.
   tularensis was detected by PCR in about 7\% European hares. This
   monitoring programme was conceived and implemented by the regional and
   local administrations in close collaboration with the official
   veterinary services and the hunters' associations.},

Title = {Longitudinal effects of environmental enrichment on behaviour and

Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {The aim of this paper was to provide a longitudinal evaluation of the
   effects of physical enrichments on the behaviour and physiology of
   intensive stock-farming pigs. Twenty-eight crossbred pigs of both sexes,
   were exposed to four types of enrichments (hemp ropes, steel chains,
   plastic balls, rubber hoses) over a period of eleven weeks. This
   investigation was based on specific abnormal behaviours and
   physiological indicators, including hematologic parameters. For
   behavioural score, focal sampling was used with recording of abnormal
   behaviours (body-, tail- and ear-biting), belly nosing, running, and
   interaction with objects (for Enriched pigs). The presence of skin
   injuries was also recorded. In general, the frequency of abnormal
   behaviours was significantly reduced in the Enriched group. A
   time-related profile appeared in the use of the enrichments. Males
   showed higher occurrence of skin injuries than females. Physiological
   measurements, such as levels of complement system, white blood cells and
   neutrophils, were lower in pigs from the Enriched group. Enriched pigs,
   as a whole, presented much lower levels of serum DHEA-S concentration
   over two weeks. The findings of this study show the successful provision
   of appropriate enrichments to encourage behaviours which may result in
   satisfactory animal oral interaction with the enriching objects,
   preventing them biting pen-mates. In this respect, the objects proposed
   were strongly effective in producing changes in behaviour which could
   mitigate inadequate conditions, such as the relationship between animal
   body weight and the available space allowance.},

Abstract = {The concept of animal health Strategy for the European Union (2007-2013)
   where ``Prevention is better than cure{''} covers not only the absence
   of disease in animals, but also the critical relationship between the
   health of animals and their welfare. It is also a pillar for the EU
   Commission's policy on public health and food safety. Partnership and
   communication to the public are the two key underlying principles of the
   AHS and in particular the spreading of the concept of `` Animals +
   Humans = One health{''}. In this framework EU Parliament aims at
   promoting the work of EU veterinarians and at explaining the importance
   of animal health within the context of the EU's AHS. The overall aim is
   to increase the public's interest in EU animal health and food safety
   matters. According to this strategy, the present work aims at applying
   the two principles of partnership and communication to the public,
   through the implementation of a public health education programme in
   secondary schools. Schools in fact can make a substantial contribution
   to a student's health and well being. Moreover, students represents
   future citizens and there is a developing understanding on the
   interlinked relationships between school education and health and
   behaviour. A range of strategies and programmes have been implemented in
   the last 10 years, sharing the connecting thread that all aspects of
   life are potentially important in the promotion of health. Moreover
   school programmes, that are integrated with public health topics and in
   which practical scientific experiences are applied, are more likely to
   produce better education outcomes, health, public awareness and
   confidence and holistic culture than those which are mainly
   information-based and implemented only in classrooms. According to these
   considerations, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie
   (IZSVe) aims at implementing an education programme in public health,
   structured by means of a `` blended learning model{''}, addressed to
   secondary schools of the Veneto Region (north eastern of Italy). This
   geographical area is characterized by an important agricultural and
   livestock production. The occurrence of several animal and food-borne
   emergencies have, in the last decade, caused drastic economic losses due
   to the policy measures applied and a reduction in consumer confidence
   hence negatively influencing consumption of food of animal origin. The
   objectives of this public health education programme are: promote a
   scientific and public health culture; increase public perception and
   understanding of the scientific methods applied in public health and
   research institutions like IZSVe, via the implementation of practical
   experiments supported by contextualized and theoretical explanations
   targeted to the school audience; increase public awareness and knowledge
   on sanitary risks related to the animal-human relationship and to
   consumption of food of animal origin; highlight the important role
   played by veterinary public health institutions and veterinarians in
   society.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine whether the partial
   replacement of roughage from forage with non-forage fiber sources, in a

   without modifying behaviour and milk production. Twelve Holstein cows
   were fed two TMR maize silage based diets in a cross-over experiment.

   formulated by replacing 8\% neutral detergent fibre (NDF) from straw and
   alfalfa hay with soybean hulls and wheat bran. E-diet had a lower
   physical effectiveness factor (pef) (0.37 vs 0.34; P<0.001) and physical
   effective NDF (peNDF) (15.5 vs 14.6\%; P<0.01). Feeding and sorting
   behaviour, ruminal activity, milk yield and composition and blood
   metabolites were measured. The results indicated that dry matter intake
   was not affected by diet. Cows fed the experimental TMR spent less time
   eating (192 vs 178 min/d; P<0.05) but showed the same number of meals
   per day. C-diet fed cows sorted against peNDF in a greater extent (98.3
   vs 100.9\%; P<0.05). Treatments did not affect cows time budget of
   general behaviours, with particular regard to ruminating activity.
   Despite different forage sources in TMR, no significant differences in
   milk yield and quality were detected.
   (NDF) requirement (NRC, 2001) is not met develop metabolic disorders
   that influence milk production and health status, leading to displaced
   abomasum, ruminal parakeratosis, laminitis, acidosis and fat cow
   syndrome (Keunen et al., 2002). Along with NDF content, adequate
   physical characteristics of fibre, such as particle size and density,
   are necessary for proper ruminal fermentation, utilisation, metabolism
   and milk fat production (Mertens, 1997). Reduced forage particle size
   and non-forage fibre sources have been shown to decrease chewing time
   and saliva production, which buffers the rumen. Thus, reduced forage
   particle size and non-forage fibre sources lead to a low ruminal pH
   (<5.8) (Dohme et al., 2007). However, when fibre is provided in total
   mixed ration (TMR), and the proportion of particles longer than 19 mm is
   high, cows are more likely to sort the ration and the diet that is
   actually consumed by them is very different than the one originally
   formulated (Leonardi and Armentano, 2007). If cows are allowed to sort
   their ration, ruminal pH may fluctuate and affect feed intake,
   fermentation and overall digestion (DeVries et al., 2008). To achieve
   optimal diet utilisation leading to maximal rumen functionality, health
   status and milk yield, adequate particle length/size of forage should be
   maintained (Lammers et al., 1996), and feed sorting by cows should be
   minimised. In spite of different ration compositions and particle size
   distributions, many authors found that dairy cows were able to sort out
   the fibrous component of the feed (Kononoff et al., 2003b; DeVries et
   al., 2007). Replacing a portion of high-roughage forage in the TMR and a
   portion of concentrates with short, readily digestible NDF-rich
   by-products may reduce sorting by animals. Moreover, dry matter (DM) and
   NDF intake may be more homogenous and improve milk yield through a
   simultaneous utilisation of energy and proteins by rumen bacteria
   (Halachmi et al., 2004).
   The objective of this study was to characterise feeding, sorting,
   ruminal function, behaviour, milk yield and quality of dairy cows fed a
   ration with a roughage component based on both forage and readily
   digestible NDF-rich by-products.},

Abstract = {The brown hare (Lepus europaeus) is widely distributed throughout Europe
   where it constitutes an important game species. However, there is
   concern about its conservation because the number of European hares has
   drastically declined in Europe since the 1960s and the species is now
   considered at low risk of extinction. During the last decades, several
   countries have carried out restocking programs with the introduction of
   allochtonous individuals. We analyzed 109 blood samples from two brown
   hare populations captured in two protected areas in northern Italy,
   where no animals have been released in the last 20 years, to assess
   genetic variability and inbreeding status for management and
   conservation purposes. For this study, eight microsatellite markers were
   selected from those described in the literature and two multiplex PCR
   reactions were optimised. The number of alleles per locus, allelic
   frequencies, observed and expected heterozygosity, and inbreeding
   coefficient were then calculated.
   Our results revealed good genetic variability in both populations.
   Analysis of brown hare populations in a larger number of protected areas
   would be useful for improving their management through wider genetic
   characterization of populations for restocking programs, more accurate
   measurement of their genetic distances, evaluation of the reduction in
   their genetic variability and gene flows among adjacent areas, and
   perhaps detection of the introduction of allochtonous animals.},

   humans, domestic animals and wild birds was documented from August 2008
   in areas around the Po river delta. This paper presents the results of
   surveillance activity carried out in 2008-2010 in the Veneto Region on
   equines, wild birds and mosquitoes. In the same period, the infected
   area also had human cases reported. Surveillance data and environmental
   variables were used to produce preliminary risk maps for the
   distribution of WNV in the Veneto region. The surveillance activities
   set up in 2010 enabled a rapid identification of viral circulation in a
   new area (i.e. surveillance area) and in previously affected areas and
   the co-circulation of USUTU virus (USUV).},

Abstract = {Bovine amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy (BASE) is one of the
   recently discovered atypical forms of BSE, which is transmissible to
   primates, and may be the bovine equivalent of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jacob
   disease (CJD) in humans. Although it is transmissible, it is unknown
   whether BASE is acquired through infection or arises spontaneously. In
   the present study, the gene expression of white blood cells (WBCs) from
   5 cattle at 1 yr after oral BASE challenge was compared with negative
   controls using a custom microarray containing 43,768 unique gene probes.
   In total, 56 genes were found to be differentially expressed between
   BASE and control animals with a log fold change of 2 or greater. Of
   these, 39 were upregulated in BASE animals, while 17 were downregulated.
   The majority of these genes are related to immune function. In
   particular, BASE animals appeared to have significantly modified
   expression of genes linked to T- and B-cell development and activation,
   and to inflammatory responses. The potential impacts of these gene
   expression changes are described.},

Abstract = {Taking into account the sanitary consequences of the food crisis which
   hit Europe in the `90s, well summarized by Bovine Spongiform
   Encephalopathy (BSE), the collection and exchange of data along all the
   steps of the food production chain ({''}from farm to fork{''}) is
   essential {[}4].
   The aim of this paper is to describe a practical use of the information
   system technologies applied to food safety and beef traceability in the
   Veneto Region (Northern Italy).
   Since 1994, the regional veterinary service has been developing a
   Regional Information System (RIS) with the aim of creating and
   maintaining an effective and structured communication network among all
   the stakeholders (health authorities, producers, consumers). The core of
   the RIS is the Regional Data Bank (RDB) which stores all data about
   farms and related industries and is linked to a geographical information
   system for spatial data management. The RDB also manages the regional
   register of individual bovine animals, containing information on cattle
   movements, slaughtering, births and deaths. The RDB is linked to the
   National Data Bank and provides it with the information required by the
   Italian and European legislations. An important node of the RIS is the
   Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie (IZSVe), a
   veterinary public health institute that conducts official laboratory
   controls and research activities in the areas of animal health and
   welfare, food safety, and environmental protection. The IZSVe
   headquarters also house the Regional Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology
   (CREV) which is responsible for the implementation and management of the
   RIS.
   The ongoing consolidation of RDB archives has recently allowed the
   development of a procedure (GESVET) for the management of the activities
   performed by the Veterinary Services of the 21 Local Public Health Units
   (LPHUs) operating in the region. Inter alia a specific module for the
   management of the veterinary activities at slaughterhouses has been
   implemented. The RIS is also integrated with the IZSVe laboratories
   (IZILAB) information system.},

Abstract = {Four DNA vaccines against BoHV-1 were evaluated for their efficacy in
   calves. Twelve animals were divided into four groups which were injected
   with four different DNA vaccines: pVAX-tgD (Vaccine A); pVAX-tgD
   co-immunised with pVAX-48CpG (Vaccine B); pVAX-UbiLacl-tgD-L (Vaccine
   C); pVAX-UbiLacl-tgD-L co-immunised with pVAX-48CpG (Vaccine D). Three
   additional calves were given the plasmid vector and served as controls.
   Ninety days after the first vaccination all calves were challenge
   infected with BoHV-1.
   All animals developed a severe form of infections bovine
   rhinotracheitis. Only the calves given the pVAX-tgD co-immunised with
   pVAX-48CpG (Vaccine B) developed humoral antibodies against BoHV-1
   between 56 and 90 days after the first vaccination, whereas in calves of
   other groups and in the controls, antibodies appeared only after the
   infection. In the calves vaccinated with either pVAX-tgD (Vaccine A) or
   pVAX-tgD combined with pVAX-48CpG (Vaccine B), BoHV-1-specific IFN-gamma
   secreting cells were detected in PBMCs 90 days after the first
   vaccination and their number increased after challenge exposure. In the
   other groups the IFN-gamma secreting cells were detected after virus
   infection and at low values. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   canine CD4+ FOXP3high T cells in both the peripheral blood (PB) and
   popliteal lymph node (LN). FOXP3+ cells in both PB and LN yielded
   positive staining with the newly developed anti-murine/human Helios
   antibody clone 22F6, consistent with the notion that they were naturally
   occurring Treg cells. Stimulation of mononuclear cells of LN origin with
   concanavalin A (Con A) in vitro yielded increased proportions and median
   fluorescence intensity of FOXP3 expression by both CD4+ and CD8+ T
   cells. Removal of the Con A and continued culture disclosed a CD4+
   FOXP3high population, distinct from the CD4+ FOXP3intermediate T cells;
   very few CD8+ FOXP3high T cells were observed, though CD8+
   FOXP3intermediate cells were present in equal abundance to CD4+
   FOXP3intermediate cells. The CD4+ FOXP3high T cells were thought to
   represent activated Treg cells, in contrast to the FOXP3intermediate
   cells, which were thought to be a more heterogeneous population
   comprising predominantly activated conventional T cells. Co-staining
   with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) supported this notion, because the
   FOXP3high T cells were almost exclusively IFN-gamma-, whereas the
   FOXP3intermediate cells expressed a more heterogeneous IFN-gamma
   phenotype. Following activation of mononuclear cells with Con A and
   interleukin-2, the 5\% of CD4+ T cells showing the highest CD25
   expression (CD4+ CD25high) were enriched in cells expressing FOXP3.
   These cells were anergic in vitro, in contrast to the 20\% of CD4+ T
   cells with the lowest CD25 expression (CD4+ CD25-), which proliferated
   readily. The CD4+ CD25high FOXP3high T cells were able to suppress the
   proliferation of responder CD4+ T cells in vitro, in contrast to the
   CD4+ CD25- cells, which showed no regulatory properties.},

Abstract = {After a two-year period of the frequent detection of
   prednisolone-positive bovine urine samples in the Italian region of
   Lombardy, studies were initiated to investigate the source. Because the
   majority of positive samples were detected at the slaughterhouse,
   researchers hypothesised that, together with increased cortisol and
   cortisone, a small quantity of prednisolone could be produced by the
   cows in stressful situations.
   In the present study, three dairy cows underwent intramuscular
   treatments with tetracosactide hexaacetate, a synthetic analogue of
   adrenocorticotropic hormone, to simulate stress. The animals were
   slaughtered at the end of the study. The results indicated that
   prednisolone could be detected occasionally in the non-stressful state,
   but was consistently found in the urine of stressed cows (concentrations
   ranged from 1.01 to 4.08 ng/mL). To confirm the stress condition,
   urinary cortisol and cortisone were also detected at high concentrations
   in the urine, typically at concentrations of hundreds of nanograms per
   millilitre.
   The results of this preliminary study did not reveal the metabolic
   pathway responsible for prednisolone but suggested that this
   corticosteroid could be produced endogenously. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {Molecular diagnostic tests are widely implemented in animal and human
   health microbiology. Efficient nucleic acid extraction methods are
   essential in diagnostic laboratories and automation is a valuable tool
   for those with high throughput activity. Nucleic acid extraction
   protocols present variable efficiency depending on the composition of
   the specimen and the chemical-physical characteristics of the target
   pathogen. In the present study, we compared the DNA extraction
   performances of four automated methods (kits I, M, P, Q) adapted on a
   Hamilton Robotics ``Microlab Starlet{''} extraction unit, and one manual
   method (kit R). Ten-fold dilutions of Mycobacterium avium subsp.
   paratuberculosis (MAP) were used to contaminate bovine central nervous
   system (CNS) and lung-spleen-liver pools (LSL). In consideration of its
   chemical-physical characteristics, MAP was selected as a template for
   pathogen DNA detection. Analytical performance and repeatability were
   assessed through downstream real-time PCR amplification, hands-on time
   (HOT), total turnaround time (TAT) and costs of all kits. MAP was
   detected differently depending on extraction kit and type of matrix
   analysed. Kits M and I showed the highest analytical performance on CNS
   (1 MAP/ml) and LSL (10 MAP/ml), respectively. Besides analytical
   results, kits I and M displayed high repeatability, the same HOT, very
   similar TAT, and were inexpensive. In conclusions, different
   standardized automated systems have been established with high
   throughput, sensitivity and repeatability for CNS and LSL. Our results
   also demonstrated that is necessary to assess the effectiveness of
   extraction kits in matrices not previously tested to avoid the risk of
   unreliable diagnostic outcomes.},

Abstract = {Control of emerging animal diseases depends on their early detection.
   However, designing surveillance programs for exotic and emerging
   diseases is very challenging because of knowledge gaps on the
   probability of incursion and mechanisms of spread. Bluetongue virus
   serotype 8 (BTV8) was detected in Northern Italy for the first time in
   January 2008 following the detection of BTV8 in Central Europe (Belgium,
   The Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany and France).
   In this work are reported the measures adopted in Piedmont region
   (North-western Italy) in order to assess the risk of BTV8 introduction
   by commercial trades as Piedmont borders France and has an intense
   livestock import activity with France. Measures in this step included
   serological survey and risk map based on entomological data. After the
   BT detection in the region to control BT spread.a massive vaccination
   plan was settled and a survey on wildlife susceptible ruminants was
   performed. Measures undertaken after BT introduction were satisfactory
   as between 2008 and 2009 only 25 outbreaks were detected on 16.000 herds
   and in 2010 just one purchase head in January.},

Title = {A rapid real-time PCR/DNA resolution melting method to identify
   Prototheca species},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2011},

Pages = {27-34},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Aim:
   The study describes the development of a simple and rapid tool to
   identify yeast-like microalgae belonging to the genus Prototheca.
   Methods and Results:
   The method, based on two-step Real Time PCR reaction followed by DNA
   Resolution Melting Analysis (qPCR/RMA), has been developed using
   reference strains belonging to both pathogenic (P. zopfii genotype 2, P.
   wickerhamii and P. blaschkeae) and non-pathogenic species (P. zopfii
   genotype 1, P. stagnora and P. ulmea). In order to validate the method,
   seventy recently isolated Prototheca strains were thus tested in
   parallel with both the first qPCR/RMA and the conventional
   genotype-specific PCR assay: they were classified as P. zopfii genotype
   1, P. zopfii genotype 2 and P. blaschkeae, with a perfect accordance
   between the two above methodologies. Furthermore, we used the second
   qPCR/RMA to identify the other species (P. stagnora, P. ulmea and P.
   wickerhamii), which cannot be discriminated by conventional PCR assay.
   Conclusions:
   The assay two-step Real Time PCR is accurate, robust, cost-effective and
   faster than auxonographical, biochemical or conventional molecular
   biology methods.
   Significance and Impact of the Study:
   the rapid and high throughout two-step qPCR/RMA tool can be usefully
   used for the identification of clinical and environmental Prototheca
   species into the framework of the diagnosis of animal (e.g. bovine
   mastitis) or human protothecosis.},

Abstract = {The overuse of antimicrobials can select resistant bacteria strains;
   staphylococci have the ability to become resistant to all beta-lactam
   antimicrobials and are a significant concern in human medicine and a
   growing issue for veterinary medicine. Because antimicrobials are
   sometimes incorrectly used in breeding kennels, the objective of the
   work was to assess the occurrence of methicillin-resistant
   coagulase-positive staphylococci in breeding dogs. The research was
   carried out in 13 kennels that were allotted to three categories
   according to the intensity of antimicrobial use. Vaginal and milk swabs
   were taken from 87 healthy bitches around parturition and also from
   multiple organs of 27 of their pups that died within the first 2 weeks.
   Standard bacteriological examinations were carried out and
   coagulase-positive staphylococci were identified. All the
   coagulase-positive Staphylococci resulted to be Staphylococcus
   pseudintermedius. Susceptibility to oxacillin and the presence of the
   mecA gene were tested. Nine out of 89 strains (six isolated from the
   bitches' milk and three from dead puppies, all belonging to kennels
   characterized by an excessive use of antimicrobials) were
   multidrug-resistant, methicillin-resistant and mecA positive.
   Our results confirm that excessive use of antimicrobials entails the
   risk of selecting resistant staphylococci strains. Our data also
   indicate that the bacterial flora of healthy dogs belonging to specific
   populations may act as a reservoir of resistance genes. (C) 2011

Abstract = {A total of 1485 adult ticks were collected from mammalian hosts in
   south-eastern Sardinia, Italy, during the years 2007-2008. Ticks were
   identified and tested by PCR analysis for presence of Rickettsia species
   of the spotted fever group, Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum,
   Coxiella burnetii, Bartonella species and Leishmania species. Among all
   tick species examined (Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Rhipicephalus
   turanicus, Rhipicephalus bursa, Rhipicephalus pusillus, Hyalomma
   marginatum marginatum, Haemaphysalis sulcata and Dermacentor
   marginatus), only Hyalomma marginatum marginatum produced negative
   results. A total of 22 pools belonging to the three tick species
   Rhipicephalus sanguineus (0.9 \%), Rhipicephalus turanicus (4.5 \%) and
   Rhipicephalus pusillus (100 \%) were positive for Rickettsia species,
   while a total of five pools belonging to Rhipicephalus sanguineus (0.09
   \%), Haemaphysalis sulcata (16.7 \%) and D. marginatus (7.8 \%) were
   positive for E. canis. Five pools of Rhipicephalus turanicus (1.8 \%)
   were positive for A. phagocytophilum. Positivity for C. burnetii was
   found in seven pools belonging to three tick species: Rhipicephalus
   sanguineus (0.5 \%), Rhipicephalus turanicus (0.3 \%) and Haemaphysalis
   sulcata (4.4 \%). Finally, four pools belonging to Rhipicephalus
   sanguineus (0.09 \%), Rhipicephalus turanicus (0.7 \%) and Rhipicephalus
   bursa (1.1 \%) were positive for Bartonella species. Leishmania species
   DNA was not detected in any of the tick pools examined. Data presented
   here increase our knowledge on tick-borne diseases in Sardinia, and
   provide a useful contribution to understanding their epidemiology.},

   sulfadimethoxine and doxycycline were administered for 10 days to
   chickens in poultry feed incurred at the contamination levels frequently
   found during national feed monitoring programmes (1-5mg kg(-1)).
   Sulfadimethoxine and doxycycline residual concentrations detected in
   muscle (<LOD and 31 mu g kg(-1), respectively), liver (13 and 56 mu g
   kg(-1), respectively) and kidney (56 and 115 mu g kg(-1), respectively)

Title = {Embryonic and foetal Islet-1 positive cells in human hearts are also

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HISTOCHEMISTRY},

Abstract = {During embryogenesis, the mammalian heart develops from a primitive
   heart tube originating from two bilateral primary heart fields located
   in the lateral plate mesoderm. Cells belongings to the pre-cardiac
   mesoderm will differentiate into early cardiac progenitors, which
   express early transcription factors which are also common to the Isl-1
   positive cardiac progenitor cells isolated from the developing
   pharyngeal mesoderm and the foetal and post-natal mice hearts. A second
   population of cardiac progenitor cells positive to c-Kit has been
   abundantly isolated from adult hearts. Until now, these two populations
   have been considered two different sets of progenitor cells present in
   the heart in different stages of an individual life. In the present
   study we collected embryonic, foetal and infant hearts, and we tested
   the hypotheses that c-Kit positive cells, usually isolated from the
   adult heart, are also present in the intra-uterine life and persist in
   the adult heart after birth, and that foetal Isl-1 positive cells are
   also positive to c-Kit. Using immunohistochemistry we studied the
   temporal distribution of Isl-1 positive and c-Kit/CD105 double positive
   cells, and by immunofluorescence and confocal analysis we studied the
   co-localization of c-Kit and Isl-1 positive cells. The results indicated
   that cardiomyocytes and interstitial cells were positive for c-Kit from
   the 9t(h) to the 19(h) gestational week, that cells positive for both
   c-Kit and CD105 appeared in the interstitium at the 17(h) gestational
   week and persisted in the postnatal age, and that the Isl-1 positive
   cells were a subset of the c-Kit positive population.},

Abstract = {The rapid translation of preclinical cell- based therapy to restore
   damaged myocardium has raised questions concerning the best cell type as
   well as the best delivery route, and the best time of cell injection
   into the myocardium. Intramyocardial injection of stem cells is by far
   the most- used delivery technique in preclinical studies. We have
   recently demonstrated that c- Kit positive cardiac progenitor cells are
   able to organize themselves into a tissue- like cell mass in three-
   dimensional cultures, and with the help of an OPLA scaffold, many cells
   can create an organized elementary myocardium. We assessed the reaction
   of the immune system to implanted synthetic scaffolds designed to
   deliver cardiac progenitor cells in the infarcted region of the heart.
   For the synthesis of PDLLA scaffolds, the Poly ( D, L lactic acid) (
   RESOMER 207, MW = 252 kDa) polymer were used ( 6.7\%) in Dicloromethane/
   Dimetilformamide ( DCM/ DMF) 70/ 30 ( v/ v). The three-dimensional
   structure was obtained by salt- leaching, using NaCl crystals as
   porosity agent ( NaCl< 224 mu mand < 150 mu m). For the synthesis of
   fibrinoin scaffolds, degummed silk fibres were dried and dissolved into
   9.3 m LiBr water solution ( 20\% w/ v) at 65. C for 3 h. Scaffolds with
   different porosities, pore size, and properties were made by freeze-
   drying and salt- leaching. Scaffolds embedded with collagen I and
   cardiac progenitor cells were implanted in the subcutaneous dorsal
   region of athymic Nude- Foxn1nu mice. PDLLA and Fibroin porous scaffolds
   produced by salt leaching were implanted in the subcutaneous region of
   nude mice, and after 45 days skin biopsies demonstrated that there was a
   foreign body reaction to all the implanted scaffold apart from the
   fibroin electrospun nets.},

Abstract = {A rapid and sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used
   for the qualitative screening analysis of neomycin in food of animal
   origin (muscle, liver, kidney, eggs and milk) at levels corresponding to
   the European Union maximum residue limit (MRL) set for this substance.
   The method validation was performed according to the criteria of
   Commission Decision 2002/657/EC established for qualitative screening
   methods. In this regard, the following parameters were determined:
   detection capability (CC beta), specificity, detection limit (LOD),
   quantification limit (LOQ), recovery, precision, linearity and
   ruggedness. LODs ranged from 5.7 mu g kg(-1) in kidney to 29.3 mu g
   kg(-1) in milk; LOQs ranged from 11.4 mu g kg(-1) in kidney to 59.7 mu g
   kg(-1) in eggs. The recoveries from spiked samples at the MRL, half the
   MRL and double the MRL levels ranged from 65.8\% to 122.8\%, with a
   coefficient of variation (CV) between 5.9\% and 28.6\%. The CC beta
   value was less than the MRL for all examined matrices. Moderate
   variations of some critical factors in the sample pretreatment for
   muscle, milk and eggs were deliberately introduced for ruggedness
   evaluation and had a slight but not statistically significant effect on
   method performance. The proposed method is suitable for qualitative
   screening analysis of neomycin in the above-mentioned food in conformity
   with current European Union performance requirements.},

Abstract = {After a case of Angiostrongylus vasorum (canine lungworm) was diagnosed
   in the province of Chieti (Italy) in early 2008, parasitological
   research was conducted to investigate the presence of the parasite in
   dogs in the area. A total of 178 dogs, 56 carcasses and 122 stool
   samples were examined between January and September 2008. The carcasses
   were examined for the presence of adult parasites in the right ventricle
   and pulmonary artery, and larval forms in the internal organ and brain
   tissues. The faeces were inspected for larval form L1 using three
   diagnostic methods that are currently used to test for endoparasites and
   larvae of bronchopulmonary strongyles. A total of 20 cases of canine
   angiostrongylosis were diagnosed (8.9\%), with adult parasites being
   identified in 5 dogs, and L1 larvae in another 15. The
   anatomo-pathological examination of the carcasses of the dogs infested
   with adult nematodes revealed pneumonia, pleurisy, reddish foam in the
   trachea, effusion of serohaemorrhagic fluid in the thoracic cavity and
   enlarged mediastinic and mesenteric lymph nodes. Histological
   examination of the tissues showed serious, similar syndromes with
   lesions caused by colonisation of the kidneys, lymph nodes and brain by
   the parasites. Given the large number of cases confirmed in relation to
   the period of study (9 months), it is essential to include

Abstract = {Risk-communication campaigns are important means of promoting food
   safety. Although foodborne diseases are a widespread public-health
   problem, in Italy few communication campaigns have focused on such
   diseases. In 2007, we launched a public risk-communication campaign on
   salmonellosis. The initiative, based on communication theory, included a
   formative research, aimed to outline key aspects for campaign's
   development, and an impact evaluation survey.
   The campaign was found effective in terms of target penetration and
   measurable learning outcomes. Results confirm that risk-communication
   campaigns on microbial infections can be successful when based on
   rigorous methodology, including a systematic evaluation process. (C)

Abstract = {An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was evaluated for
   the detection of Brucella antibodies in milk from water buffalo (Bubalus
   bubalis Linnaeus, 1758). The test accuracy was evaluated on milk samples
   from the Campania Region in Italy. A total of 100 negative samples were
   collected from 10 officially brucellosis-free herds in Salerno Province,
   while 30 positive samples were collected from 3 herds in Caserta
   Province, where animals gave positive results to the official tests and
   it was here that Brucella abortus biovar 1 had been isolated. Test
   sensitivity was 100\%, with a confidence interval (C:I) of 90.8\%-100\%,
   while specificity was 98\% (CI 93\%-99.4\%) on individual milk samples.
   To simulate bulk milk samples from herds infected at various levels of
   infection, dilutions from 1:10 to 1:100 of positive milk samples in
   negative milk were also used. The probability of detecting antibodies in
   positive milk samples was higher than 50\% up to a dilution of 1:50 in
   negative milk. Considering the average national water buffalo herd size,
   the probability of identifying infection in a water buffalo herd by bulk
   milk testing is 50\% (CI 33.1\%-66.9\%) in the worst case scenario of a
   single infected animal contributing to the bulk milk.},

Abstract = {For several years eel farms situated in NW Greece, kept reporting, lack
   of appetite and alarming losses among growing eels of various size
   classes. The problems usually occurred subsequent to handling, such as
   grading. During the recent years 2008-2010 these problems intensified.
   Necropsy, bacteriology and parasitology performed on diseased specimens
   often resulted in mixed findings, such as Aeromonas spp. infections or
   Dactylogyrus spp., Trichodina spp. and Myxidium spp. infestations, none
   of which was deemed sufficiently intense to explain the severity of
   symptoms and the persistence of losses. Antibiotic treatments and/or
   antiparasitic baths did not help. Common lesions comprised gill
   inflammation and often bleeding of the gills and red sore like dermal
   lesions around the head and opercular regions. The pectoral fins were
   frequently haemorrhagic. These lesions and the frequency and persistence
   of morbidity suggested the possibility of infection by Herpes Virus
   Anguillae (HVA). Frozen samples at -20 degrees C of diseased whole eels
   of three different batches from the same farm were collected in spring
   and summer of 2010 and sent to a virology laboratory. Virus isolations
   were performed on eel kidney (EK-1) and Bluegill fry (BF-2) cell lines,
   where cytopathic effects were observed. Both the IPNV and the HVA agents
   were isolated and identified by IFAT and the viral particles were
   observed by transmission electron microscopy. This is the first
   published report of HVA and IPN viruses infecting farmed eels in Greece.},

Abstract = {To investigate the molecular adaptation of influenza viruses during
   natural interspecies transmission, we performed a phenotypic and
   genotypic analysis of a low-pathogenic duck H7N3 influenza virus after
   experimental passages in turkey and quail. Results obtained showed
   differences in the HA receptor-binding and in NA enzyme activities in
   viruses recovered after passages in quail, compared to those obtained
   from passages in turkey. Sequencing of the HA. NA and genes of internal
   proteins of the viruses obtained from quail and turkey, identified
   several amino acid substitutions in comparison with the progenitor
   virus. Of note, in the quail-adapted viruses the emergence of a 23-amino
   acid deletion in the stalk of the NA and the introduction of a
   glycosylation site in the HA were a reminiscence of changes typically
   observed in nature confirming a potential role of the quail in the
   adaptation of wild birds viruses to domestic poultry. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Title = {Evidence of Simultaneous Circulation of West Nile and Usutu Viruses in
   Mosquitoes Sampled in Emilia-Romagna Region (Italy) in 2009},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {Background: In recent years human diseases due to mosquito-borne viruses
   were increasingly reported in Emilia-Romagna region (Italy), from the
   chikungunya virus in 2007 to the West Nile virus (WNV) in 2008. An
   extensive entomological survey was performed in 2009 to establish the
   presence and distribution of mosquito arboviruses in this region, with
   particular reference to flaviviruses.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: From May 6 to October 31, a total of
   190,516 mosquitoes were sampled in georeferenced stations, grouped in
   1,789 pools according date of collection, location, and species, and
   analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to
   detect the presence of RNA belong to Flavivirus genus. WNV was detected
   in 27 mosquito pools, producing sequences similar to those of birds and
   human strains obtained in 2008 outbreak, pointed out the probable virus
   overwintering. Isolation of WNV was achieved from one of these pools.
   Moreover 56 pools of mosquitoes tested positive for Usutu virus (USUV).
   Most PCR positive pools consisted of Culex pipiens, which also was the
   most analyzed mosquito species (81.4\% of specimens); interestingly,
   USUV RNA was also found in two Aedes albopictus mosquito pools.
   Simultaneous circulation of WNV and USUV in the survey area was
   highlighted by occurrence of 8 mosquito WNV-and USUV-positive pools and
   by the overlaying of the viruses ``hot spots{''}, obtained by kernel
   density estimation (KDE) analysis. Land use of sampled stations pointed
   out a higher proportion of WNV-positive Cx. pipiens pool in rural
   environments respect the provenience of total sampled pool, while the
   USUV-positive pools were uniformly captured in the different
   environments.
   Conclusions/Significance: Obtained data highlighting the possible role
   of Cx. pipiens mosquito as the main vector for WNV and USUV in Northern
   Italy, and the possible involvement of Ae. albopictus mosquito in USUV
   cycle. The described mosquito-based surveillance could constitute the
   foundation for a public health alert system targeting mosquito borne
   arboviruses.},

Abstract = {At the end of 2006, a recrudescence of swine vesicular disease (SVD) was
   recorded in Italy and the disease spread widely throughout the northern
   regions. Lombardy, a densely populated pig area, was most affected and
   the presence of the disease caused heavy economic losses to the entire
   pig industry. Although SVD is considered only moderately contagious, the
   epidemic in the north was characterised by a rapid spread of the
   condition. Numerous difficulties were encountered in eradicating it.
   Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the
   population of pigs in Lombardy, concentrated mainly in a few areas which
   were the most severely affected during the 2006 to 2007 SVD epidemic.
   Increases in both the pig population and animal movements, combined with
   weak biosecurity measures, increased the spread rate of the disease and
   hampered eradication activities.},

Abstract = {The bluetongue (BT) epidemic that has prevailed in Europe since 2000 is
   the first example of continental spread of the BT virus (BTV) in large
   naive populations of susceptible animals. Based on the results of
   intensive surveillance and research in countries of the southern
   Mediterranean that were affected by the infection early on in the
   epidemic, a new strategy for prevention and control of the disease was
   developed to limit direct losses and to reduce the consequences due to
   movement restrictions. The basic innovations that were introduced were
   the use of mass vaccination of all domestic ruminant species to limit
   the spread of BTV and the use of intensive active surveillance to limit,
   as far as possible, the zone where movement restrictions must be
   applied. The novel strategy that was adopted dramatically reduced the
   number of clinical outbreaks in southern Europe and the Mediterranean
   Basin and ensured safer animal trade. In 2006, the first BTV-8 epidemic
   occurred, this time in north-western Europe. During this epidemic,
   affected countries adopted a `wait and see' approach. No vaccination was
   implemented until 2008 and, in many instances, the movement of animals
   was authorised within restricted areas, thereby facilitating the spread
   of infection. The delay in administering vaccination was due to the
   decision to avoid the use of modified live virus vaccines, although this
   type of vaccine performed satisfactorily in the previous BT epidemics in
   southern Europe. Bluetongue has demonstrated that the infectious agents
   present in southern Africa can easily spread to the Mediterranean Basin,
   which should be considered a single entity as far as the epidemiology of
   animal diseases is concerned. Therefore, any effective strategy for the
   prevention and control of animal disease in Europe must take into
   account this reality and recognise the need for regional surveillance
   networks that include all the countries that border the Mediterranean.},

Abstract = {The relationship between mortality and stressful weather is not only a
   complex health social and environmental Issue but also becomes an
   economical problem when considering livestock Future-climate scenarios
   suggest that higher global mean temperatures could result in marked
   changes in the frequency of extreme temperatures The relationship
   between high temperature and mortality is well known in people living in
   urban areas but it has been poorly investigated in livestock such as
   dairy cows The aim of this study was to quantify the relationship
   between heat and mortality from all causes among dairy cows in Italy We
   studied 6697 adult (>24 months) dairy cows that died during the summer
   in the 5-year period 2002-2006 in three Italian districts (Brescia Cuneo
   Rome) which were selected because of the high livestock production and
   the availability of weather data for these geographical areas A
   case-crossover design was applied using the temperature-humidity index
   (THI) as exposure of interest Pooled odds ratio (OR) of mortality at
   high exposure values versus low exposure values was estimated An
   exposure over the THI cutoff increased the risk of mortality by 1 6
   times with a 4\% increase in mortality for each THI degree increase
   above the threshold We found no effect modification for age-class herd
   size or breed but a certain degree of geographical heterogeneity was
   identified The increased dairy cow mortality highlighted in this study
   should be considered when adopting animal welfare and farm management
   measures This phenomenon can be prevented by adopting appropriate
   interventions to mitigate environmental thermal challenges (C) 2010

   helminth infection was 98.60 \%. The following parasites were found:
   Brachylaima sp. (prevalence 8.39 \%) (Trematoda); Taenia taeniaeformis
   larvae (11.89 \%), Rodentolepis nana (13.29 \%), Hymenolepis diminuta
   (24.48 \%) (Cestoda); Gongylonema sp., (4.90 \%), Syphacia muris (8.39
   \%), Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (18.88 \%), Eucoleus gastricus (30.07
   \%), Mastophorus muris (30.77 \%), Capillaria hepatica (54.55 \%),
   Heterakis spumosa (82.52 \%) (Nematoda) and one acanthocephalan (0.70
   \%). The species found in males were also present in females, with the
   exception of the acanthocephalan. No significant differences were found
   between males and females in prevalence (P\%) or mean infection
   intensity (MI). However, a significant correlation between both P\% and
   MI, as well as host age, was observed in some helminth species. Hosts
   were infected by one to six helminth species (median = 3). This is the
   first report from Sicily of helminths in R. norvegicus.},

Abstract = {Between May 2007 and October 2008, 34 outbreaks of mild to moderate
   forms of infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) occurred in commercial
   broiler flocks in Italy. Affected birds showed watery eyes,
   conjunctivitis, nasal discharge, reduction of feed and water
   consumption, and gasping with expectoration of blood-stained mucus. The
   mortality rate was <10\%. Gross lesions consisted of conjunctivitis,
   excess of mucus, blood, or presence of diphtheritic membranes in
   trachea. A real-time PCR assay was performed to confirm the presence of
   ILT virus (ILTV) DNA in tracheal tissue homogenates. Twenty-three ILTV
   isolates were propagated on the chorion-allantoic membrane of
   embryonated chicken eggs showing typical plaques. PCR combined with
   restriction fragment length polymorphism and gene sequencing of isolates
   showed a high genetic correlation between field strains and chicken
   embryo origin vaccines.},

Abstract = {A rapid, high resolution liquid chromatography coupled with ElectroSpray
   Ionization Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (ESI/TOF/MS) method was
   developed for the determination of the toxin pattern in cultured cells
   of Ostreopsis cf. ovata from the Mediterranean Sea. The samples were
   separated on a Phenomenex Luna 3 mu HILIC 200A (150 x 2.00 mm) and
   analyzed by LC/TOF/MS with electrospray ionization (ESI) interface in
   positive ion mode. The method developed here provides the capability for
   a fully automated analysis, which requires relatively easy sample
   preparation and gives clean and simple chromatograms. The method was
   successfully applied to the determination of ovatoxin-a,
   mascarenotoxin-a and four new palytoxins in O. cf. ovata. Another new
   palytoxin was detected in the standard material from Palythoa
   tuberculosa provided by Wako Chemicals. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

   conducted using a pool of 26 microsatellite loci. A total of 209 animals
   were analyzed, representing six geographical populations from different
   location of the Southern slope of the Alps. Clear genetic differences
   have emerged between the sampled chamois groups. Some were consistent
   with an isolation-by-distance model. However, in parallel, other
   mechanisms intervened in areas that, in addition to being peripheral to
   the main alpine ridge, had suffered from recent bottlenecks. In such
   areas, genetic drift and a low rate of gene flow are likely explanations
   for the current genetic structure.},

Abstract = {Three different minor groove binder (MGB) probe assays have been
   developed for rapid and accurate identification of the species commonly
   used for production of canned tuna i e yellowfin (Thunnus albacares)
   bluefin (Thunnus thynnus) and albacore (Thunnus alalunga) tunas The
   assays targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene were able to
   discriminate efficiently between the three species contained in fresh or
   canned tunas and did not react with other Scombroidei that were tested A
   correct species prediction was obtained even from artificial mixtures
   prepared with different amounts of the reference tuna species and
   subjected to the sterilisation treatment Testing of 27 commercial canned
   tunas by PCR-RFLP MGB probe assays and sequence analysis showed a
   concordance of 100\% between the last two techniques whereas by using
   PCR-RFLP several samples were uncharacterised or mischaracterised
   These results make the established MGB probe assays an attractive tool
   for direct and rapid species identification in canned tuna (C) 2010

Abstract = {Nematodes of genus Anisakis spp. parasitize a wide range of marine hosts
   with marine mammals (mainly cetaceans) serving as definitive hosts,
   while fish, squid and other invertebrates serve as paratenic or
   intermediate hosts. Sea turtles can act as accidental or paratenic hosts
   for Anisakis spp. larvae, harbouring third-stage larvae unable to
   complete their life cycle in an ectothermic vertebrate. Post-mortem
   examination of 96 loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) stranded
   along the Italian coast of the Mediterranean Sea showed infection by
   Anisakis larvae Type I from 4 of 6 locations that were identified as
   belonging to Anisakis pegreffii by sequence analyses of the mtDNA cox2.
   Thirteen turtles (11 males and 2 females) were infected with A.
   pegreffii. Larvae were detected through gross necroscopy from 7 turtles,
   while in other 6 positive loggerhead sea turtles A. pegreffii larvae
   were revealed by histopathology. Pathological changes associated with A.
   pegreffii larvae in the stomach and intestine included necrosis and
   granulomatous response compatible with larvae migration. The role of the
   loggerhead sea turtle as an accidental host in the life cycle of this
   nematode is also discussed. This study is the first description of
   pathological changes associated with A. pegreffii in a sea turtle. (C)

Title = {Risk factors associated with the occurrence of undesired effects in

Abstract = {In the 2004, the Sardinian bluetongue (BT) vaccination campaign used the
   combination of monovalent BTV-2, BTV-4 and BTV-16 modified-live vaccines
   manufactured by the Onderstepoort Biological Products in South Africa.
   Following vaccination, some herds showed temperature, oedema, lameness,
   hyperaemia and decrease in milk production, and some others remained
   perfectly healthy. This study aimed to evaluate whether important
   factors present in the herd at the time of vaccination could be
   associated to the occurrence of undesired effects observed after
   immunisation with BTV modified-live vaccines. A sample of 17 sheep and 4
   goat flocks, for a total of 670 animals, were included in the study and
   risk factors such as presence of most important parasitic, bacterial and
   viral diseases as well as anomalies of biochemical and haematological
   parameters were associated to the presence or absence of side effects.
   For each factor the relative risk and 95\% confidence interval were
   calculated. Following vaccination, bluetongue-like symptoms were
   observed in 13 flocks. In these flocks, a higher (P < 0.05) proportion
   of animals had viraemia and showed higher titers to BTV-16 after
   immunisation. Positive association (RR = 2.50, 1.17-5.04) was also found
   between flocks in which undesired effect were observed and positive
   serology against Maedi-Visna virus. On the contrary, presence of BTV
   genome fractions in the blood of animals at the time of vaccination was
   found to be protective (RR = 0.7, 0.58-0.84) to the occurrence of
   undesired effect subsequent to BTV vaccination. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Seasonal changes and physiological factors related to sex, size and
   spawning period may alter polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity in
   crustacean decapods. Given the undesirable effects that the enzyme has
   on the marketability of shrimps, the cuticles of the valuable deep-water
   rose shrimp were examined. Monthly measurements of PPO activity in
   cuticles of juvenile and adult males and females were recorded for one
   year, along with sea-surface temperature (SST) and photoperiod. PPO
   activity was highest during late summer (August and September) and was
   lowest between February and March. The rate of enzyme activity in males
   was double that of females, when corrected for time period. juvenile
   shrimp had the highest enzyme activity. Under the conditions tested, our
   results support that PPO assessment should take into account the sex and
   size as factors that potentially biasing in tissue enzyme distributions.

Abstract = {During June and July of 2009, sudden deaths, tremulous movements and
   population declines of adult honey bees were reported by the beekeepers
   in the region of Peloponnesus (Mt. Mainalo), Greece. A preliminary study
   was carried out to investigate these unexplained phenomena in this
   region. In total, 37 bee samples, two brood frames containing honey bee
   brood of various ages, eight sugar samples and four sugar patties were
   collected from the affected colonies. The samples were tested for a
   range of pests, pathogens and pesticides. Symptomatic adult honey bees
   tested positive for Varroa destructor, Nosema ceranae, Chronic bee
   paralysis virus (CBPV), Acute paralysis virus (ABPV), Deformed wing
   virus (DWV), Sacbrood virus (SBV) and Black queen cell virus (BQCV), but
   negative for Acarapis woodi. American Foulbrood was absent from the
   brood samples. Chemical analysis revealed that amitraz, thiametoxan,
   clothianidin and acetamiprid were all absent from symptomatic adult
   bees, sugar and sugar patty samples. However, some bee samples, were
   contaminated with imidacloprid in concentrations between 14 ng/g and 39
   ng/g tissue. We present: the infection of Greek honey bees by multiple
   viruses: the presence of N. ceranae in Greek honey bees and the first
   record of imidacloprid (neonicotonoid) residues in Greek honey bee
   tissues. The presence of multiple pathogens and pesticides made it
   difficult to associate a single specific cause to the depopulation
   phenomena observed in Greece, although we believe that viruses and N.
   ceranae synergistically played the most important role. A follow up
   in-depth survey across all Greek regions is required to provide context
   to these preliminary findings. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {While dermatophytoses of several animal species have been extensively
   investigated, information on their occurrence and epidemiology in
   rabbits is limited. We carried out a study from October 2006 to February
   2007 of 23 rabbit farms in Apulia and Basilicata regions (southern
   Italy) in order to investigate the occurrence and risk factors
   associated with dermatophytoses in breeding rabbits. Dermatophytes were
   isolated from 86.9\% (20/23) of the farms and from 51.8\% (420/810) of
   the animals sampled. Trichophyton mentagrophytes (47.9\%) and
   Microsporum canis (3.2\%) were isolated from diseased (71.7\%) and
   healthy (48.4\%) animals as well from the surrounding environment
   (7.5\%). The occurrence of lesions, the age of rabbits, and farm
   management (e. g., temperature, humidity and methods and frequency of
   disinfection practices) were identified as the most significant risk
   factors (P < 0.05) for the occurrence of dermatophytes. Animals in
   fattening and finishing stages were the most frequently infected (i.e.,
   58.2 and 61.6\% respectively). Dermatophyte prevalence was significantly
   (P < 0.05) higher in areas with higher temperature (>20 degrees C) and
   relative humidity ranging from 62-65\%. The results of the present
   investigation suggest that zoonotic dermathophytes are present in rabbit
   farms and highlight the importance of correct management procedures for
   the control of the infections.},

Abstract = {Recently, Italy-particularly the Emilia-Romagna region-was the location
   of consecutive outbreaks of human diseases caused by the arboviruses
   chikungunya virus and West Nile virus. The two outbreaks, spread by
   different species of mosquitoes, were not related, but pointed out the
   lack of an arboviral surveillance program in this region. Beginning in
   2007 entomological surveillance was initiated in the Emilia-Romagna
   region, and in 2008 the program was improved and extended at Lombardia
   region. Using CO2-baited traps, 65,292 mosquitoes were collected; pooled
   by date of collection, location, and species; macerated manually; and
   tested by reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction for the
   presence of alphaviruses, orthobunyaviruses, and flaviviruses. Amplicons
   were sequenced and employed for identification of viral RNA by basic
   local alignment search tool search in GenBank. Results of these assays
   showed (1) the presence of West Nile virus in two pools of Culex pipiens
   mosquitoes, (2) the presence of RNA of two orthobunyaviruses, Tahyna
   virus in a pool of Ochlerotatus caspius mosquitoes and Batai virus in a
   pool of Anopheles maculipennis mosquitoes, and (3) the presence of
   flavivirus RNAs in pools of Oc. caspius, Aedes albopictus, and Aedes
   vexans mosquitoes; the sequences of these amplicons were most closely
   related to flaviviruses that have been detected only in mosquitoes and
   had no recognized vertebrate host (Aedes flavivirus, Culex flavivirus,
   and Kamiti River virus).},

   week before the expected calving, and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks after
   calving, body conditions score (BCS) was measured and blood samples were
   collected to separate plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells
   (PBMC). Concentrations of Hsp72 in PBMC and plasma increased sharply
   after calving. In the post-calving period, BCS and plasma glucose
   declined, whereas plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) and tumor
   necrosis factor-alpha increased. The proliferative responses of PBMC to
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS) declined progressively after calving. The
   percentage of PBMC expressing CD14 receptors and Toll-like receptors
   (TLR)-4 increased and decreased in the early postpartum period,
   respectively. Correlation analysis revealed significant positive
   relationships between Hsp72 and NEFA, and between PBMC proliferation in
   response to LPS and the percentage of PBMC expressing TLR-4. Conversely,
   significant negative relationships were found between LPS-triggered
   proliferation of PBMC and both intracellular and plasma Hsp72.
   Literature data and changes of metabolic and immunological parameters
   reported herein authorize a few interpretative hypotheses and encourage
   further studies aimed at assessing possible cause and effect
   relationships between changes of PBMC and circulating Hsp72, metabolic,
   and immune parameters in dairy cows.},

Abstract = {Since 2004, there have been several reports of Influenza A virus (FLUAV)
   infection in dogs Dogs have been infected with equine influenza H3N8,
   avian influenza H3N2 and H5N1, and the pandemic H1N1 virus Because of
   recent avian and equine influenza outbreaks in Italy, the objectives of
   the present study were to estimate the level of exposure of Italian dogs
   to influenza A viruses and to assess a diagnostic algorithm for
   detection of FLUAV exposure in dogs Sera collected from 6,858 dogs from
   2006 to 2008 were screened in a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent
   assay (cELISA) for antibodies to the highly conserved influenza A
   nucleoprotein Samples positive in the cELISA were confirmed by testing
   in hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and fluorescent antibody test (FAT)
   Two seropositive dogs had antibodies to H3 hemagglutinin proteins
   consistent with exposure to recent canine and equine subtype H3N8
   viruses Using a Bayesian model, the sensitivity and specificity of the
   cELISA were estimated as 93 98\% (probability intervals {[}PI] 81 67-99
   08\%) and 98 71\% (PI 98 43-98 96\%), respectively After accounting for
   the imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the cELISA, the Bayesian
   posterior prevalence of FLUAV exposure among tested Italian dogs was 0
   5\% (PI 0 1-1 4\%) The study results indicate that screening with a
   cELISA for influenza A nucleoprotein antibody followed by confirmatory
   testing with HI and/or FAT is a highly sensitive and highly specific
   approach for diagnosing FLUAV exposure in dogs},

Abstract = {This is the first report on the presence of Hepatozoon canis in Vulpes
   vulpes in Italy. During the years 2005 and 2006, a total of 119 foxes
   were collected and their spleen tissues were screened by microscopy,
   polymerase chain reaction, and sequencing. In the same area, 290 ticks
   were picked off from dogs or collected from the environment. Microscopy
   detected inclusion bodies regarded as belonging to the genus Hepatozoon
   in four samples, whereas molecular diagnostics evidenced 16 foxes
   (13.4\%) and 6 ticks (2.1\%) positive to H. canis. The H. canis isolates
   we found in foxes, compared with the strains we previously detected in
   dogs from the same area and with the strains found in foxes from other
   European countries, show a certain genetic heterogeneity. In fact, seven
   isolates cluster with the Italian dog strain and nine isolates cluster
   with the fox strain found in Spain and Slovakia; moreover, the dog's
   strain is closely related to one tick's isolate, and the strain found in
   three Rhipicephalus sanguineus and in one Ixodes ricinus collected from
   the environment cluster with the aforementioned Spanish and Slovak fox
   strains. Our findings confirm the importance of R. sanguineus as final
   host and suggest that I. ricinus might also be implicated in parasite
   transmission, explaining in that way the occurrence of hepatozoonosis in
   areas considered R. sanguineus-free. The peridomestic habits of V.
   vulpes and the increasing global temperature are expected to amplify the
   impact of this vector-borne disease and to enforce the transmission of
   Hepatozoon to domestic animals.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the
   rumenocentesis procedure on dairy cows by determining selected metabolic
   and physiological variables representing the health status Two groups of
   6 cows either underwent rumenocentesis (GA) or sham (GB) procedures
   Superficial skin temperature of the rumenocentesis area was measured
   using infrared thermography before the procedure (1 h) immediately after
   (0 h) and at 48 h 96 h and 20 days following rumenocentesis Blood
   samples were collected at all times except for immediately after the
   procedure (0 h) and selected immunologic response variables were
   determined Milk yield and rectal temperatures were measured daily
   Rumenocentesis did not influence the white blood cell count haptoglobin
   or total protein concentrations Electrophoretic protein fractions were
   not different between GA and GB treatments Milk yield and rectal
   temperature were not affected by rumenocentesis Skin temperature of the
   rumenocentesis region in GA group cows increased by 1 0 degrees C
   immediately after rumenocentesis and returned to baseline after 48 h
   where it remained constantly until the end of the study similar to
   observation in GB group cows Results of this study would suggest minimal
   adverse effects on cow health and production when performing
   rumenocentesis for the diagnosis of subacute ruminal acidosis Additional
   more intensive studies addressing animal welfare issues relative to the
   diagnostic techniques are needed},

Title = {Intracellular Distribution of NS1 Correlates with the Infectivity and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY},

Abstract = {Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of subtype H7N1 that emerged
   during an outbreak in 1999 and 2000 in Italy differ from their
   low-pathogenicity precursor viruses by changes in several genes,
   including three mutations in the NS1 protein. Two of them involve amino
   acid exchanges located within or closely adjacent to the nuclear export
   signal of NS1. The third mutation resulted in a new stop codon and
   thereby a C-terminal truncation of the NS1 protein of the highly
   pathogenic viruses. To find out whether these mutations contribute to
   the phenotypic differences between the highly pathogenic and low
   pathogenic viruses, we generated recombinants of the highly pathogenic
   A/ostrich/Italy/984/00 strain that contained the nuclear export signal
   and/or the extended C terminus of NS1 of a low pathogenic virus
   (A/chicken/Italy/1082/99). Using these recombinants we could demonstrate
   that replication rate and spread of infection in chicken fibroblast
   cultures, as well as infectivity for chicken embryos is reduced, whereas
   the mean death time for chicken embryos is increased, when the highly
   pathogenic virus acquires the NS1 motifs of the low pathogenic virus.
   Analysis of beta interferon transcription in chicken fibroblasts
   infected with the recombinants revealed that the mutations observed in
   the nuclear export signal of the highly pathogenic viruses were
   responsible for the enhanced interferon antagonism of these viruses.
   Cell fractionation and immunofluorescence studies in chicken fibroblasts
   showed that the nuclear export signal of the highly pathogenic viruses
   is responsible for cytoplasmic accumulation of NS1, whereas the
   C-terminal truncation promotes transport into the nucleoli. Comparative
   analysis in human A549 cells indicated that intracellular distribution
   of NS1 is host specific. Taken together, these observations support the
   concept that compartmentalization of NS1 within the cell contributes to
   the pathogenicity of avian influenza viruses.},

Abstract = {Pseudorabies virus (PrV) infections appear to be more widely distributed
   in the European wild boar (Sus scrofa) population than assumed. In
   Europe, attempts to isolate and characterize the causative agents have
   been limited so far. We therefore collected and examined a total of 35
   PrV isolates obtained from wild boar or hunting dogs in Germany, France,
   Spain, Italy, Slovakia and Hungary between 1993 and 2008. Restriction
   enzyme analysis of genomic DNA using BamHI showed that all isolates,
   except one, belonged to genogroup I but different subtypes were evident.
   For further investigations of the phylogenetic relationships, a 732-bp
   fragment of the glycoprotein C (gC) gene was amplified by PCR. Sequence
   analysis revealed about 40 variant positions within this fragment.
   Comparison of the nucleotide sequences supported the separation into a
   clade containing isolates from North-Rhine Westphalia,
   Rhineland-Palatinate (Germany), France and Spain (clade B) and an
   apparently more variable clade comprising isolates from Brandenburg,
   Baden-Wurttemberg, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt (Germany), Slovakia, Hungary,
   Italy and France (clade A).},

Abstract = {Hypoderma spp. larvae cause internal myiasis in domestic and wild
   animals characterized by subcutaneous warbles. Their differentiation is
   usually performed at species level based on the morphology of third
   stage larvae. The recent release of the whole mtDNA of Hypoderma
   lineatum and the retrieval of a 102 bp noncoding region occurring
   between tRNA(ser) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (nd1) genes
   represented the foundation for this study. The noncoding region and the
   two flanking mitochondrial genes (i.e., tRNA(ser) and nd1) of the most
   diffused Hypoderma spp. (i.e., Hypoderma actaeon, Hypoderma bovis,
   Hypoderma diana, H. lineatum, Hypoderma sinense and Hypoderma tarandi)
   were analysed. Interspecific variations in amplicon size (from 20 to 102
   bp in H. tarandi and H. lineatum, respectively) and nucleotide sequences
   allowed a genetic discrimination of the examined species providing
   information instrumental to a rapid molecular identification of
   Hypoderma spp. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Recently, a coronavirus strain (179/07-11) was isolated from water
   buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) and the virus which displayed a strict genetic
   and biological relatedness with bovine coronavirus (BCoV) was referred
   to as bubaline coronavirus (BuCoV). Here, we report the characterisation
   of four BuCoVs strains identified in the faeces or intestinal contents
   of water buffalo calves with acute gastroenteritis. Single BuCoV
   infections were detected in all but one cases from which two clostridia
   species were also isolated. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the 5'
   end of the spike-protein gene showed that three BuCoVs were closely
   related to the prototype strain 179/07-11, whereas the fourth isolate
   (339/08-C) displayed a higher genetic identity to recent BCoV reference
   strains. Three strains adapted to the in vitro grow on human rectal
   tumour cells were also evaluated for their ability to replicate in a
   bovine cell line (Madin Darby bovine kidney) and to cause
   haemagglutination of chicken erythrocytes and all displayed biological
   properties similar to those already described for the prototype BuCoV.
   The present report shows that albeit genetically heterogeneous, the
   different BuCoV strains possess a common biological pattern which is
   different from most BCoV and BCoV-like isolates. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Influence of Moraxella sp colonization on the kidney proteome of farmed
   gilthead sea breams (Sparus aurata, L.)},
Journal = {PROTEOME SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {8},
Month = {OCT 12},
Abstract = {Background: Currently, presence of Moraxella sp. in internal organs of
   fish is not considered detrimental for fish farming. However, bacterial
   colonization of internal organs can affect fish wellness and decrease
   growth rate, stress resistance, and immune response. Recently, there
   have been reports by farmers concerning slow growth, poor feed
   conversion, and low average weight increase of fish farmed in offshore
   floating sea cages, often associated with internal organ colonization by
   Moraxella sp. Therefore, presence of these opportunistic bacteria
   deserves further investigations for elucidating incidence and impact on
   fish metabolism.
   Results: A total of 960 gilthead sea breams (Sparus aurata, L.),
   collected along 17 months from four offshore sea cage plants and two
   natural lagoons in Sardinia, were subjected to routine microbiological
   examination of internal organs throughout the production cycle. Thirteen
   subjects (1.35\%) were found positive for Moraxella sp. in the kidney
   (7), brain (3), eye (1), spleen (1), and perivisceral fat (1). In order
   to investigate the influence of Moraxella sp. colonization, positive and
   negative kidney samples were subjected to a differential proteomics
   study by means of 2-D PAGE and mass spectrometry. Interestingly,
   Moraxella sp. infected kidneys displayed a concerted upregulation of
   several mitochondrial enzymes compared to negative tissues, reinforcing
   previous observations following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge in
   fish.
   Conclusions: Presence of Moraxella sp. in farmed sea bream kidney is
   able to induce proteome alterations similar to those described following
   LPS challenge in other fish species. This study revealed that Moraxella
   sp. might be causing metabolic alterations in fish, and provided
   indications on proteins that could be investigated as markers of
   infection by Gram-negative bacteria within farming plants.},

Abstract = {In a rabbit production facility health monitoring for enteropathies was
   performed in 15 production cycles for 20 mo For each cycle up to a
   hundred 35 d old rabbits weaned the same day were randomly selected
   reared in the same fattening unit but separately from the source batch
   and fed with the same feed except for antimicrobial supplementation
   Clinical symptoms and enteric lesions of the selected group were
   recorded using two checklists with binomial response (yes/no answer to a
   list of 54 clinical and enteric variables) The day after weaning one
   week later at the beginning of the enteric symptoms and 4-5 d after the
   start of the symptoms inocula from the small intestine and caecum of
   selected animals were subjected to microbiological C spiroforme Eimeria
   oocyst and rotavirus antigen detection tests Representative samples of E
   coli and C perfringens isolates were tested respectively for serotype
   biotype eae afr/2 genes and for alpha beta 1 beta 2 epsilon t and
   enterotoxin toxin genes The answers to the clinical pathological
   variables were subjected to statistical analysis with a cluster analysis
   programme in order to obtain homogeneous statistically significant
   groups of diseased animals (clusters) Then the clusters were
   statistically associated with the laboratory outcomes The cluster to
   which the enterotyphlitis lesions significantly contributed was
   associated with E coli detection E coli O103 serotype detection and C
   spiroforme (several elements variable) C spiroforme (rare elements
   variable) was significantly associated with a cluster characterised by a
   pathological profile consisting of bloating/iumbling noise and liquid
   content in stomach and caecum without enteric inflammation C perfringens
   was significantly associated with a cluster characterised by a
   pathological profile consisting of dilation/liquid content of small
   intestine caecal impaction and mucoid content in the colon Eighteen out
   of twenty five C perfringens strains examined for their toxin genotypes
   proved to be toxin type A while 7 out of 25 strains showed the a and 132
   toxin genes in combination The rotavirus antigen and Eimeria oocysts
   were detected from healthy rabbits (specimens of the day after weaning
   and one week later) in about 15\% of specimens examined but their
   presence in the sick animals was not significantly associated with any
   cluster},

Abstract = {Yersinia enterocolitica is recognized as an etiological agent of
   gastroenteritis, lymphadenitis, and chronic sequelae. During 2006 and
   2007, 205 samples (125 pork and 80 chicken meats) were collected in
   Italy and tested for detection and most-probable-number (MPN)
   enumeration of Y. enterocolitica organisms. The microorganism was
   isolated from 45 samples (21.9\%): 19 (15.2\%) pork samples and 26
   (32.5\%) chicken samples. Y. enterocolitica MPN contamination levels
   were low, ranging from 0.30 to 1.50/g. Most (94.4\%) Y. enterocolitica
   strains were biotype 1A (serotypes O:3; O:5; O:6,30; O:6,30-6,31;
   O:7,8-8-8,19; O:8; O:9; O:25,35; O:36; and O nontypeable), and 5.6\% of
   the isolates were bioserotype 2/O:9. All isolates were tested for yadA.
   ail. inv, ystA, and ystB virulence sequences. The yadA gene was detected
   in two strains (3.7\%) isolated from chicken samples: one Y.
   enterocolitica 2/O:9 yadA(+) ail(+) ystA(+), and one Y. enterocolitica
   1A/O:7,8-8-8,19 yadA(+) inv(+) ystB(+). Two (3.7\%) 2/O:9 strains,
   isolated from pork products, were ail(+) ystA(+). Most biotype 1A
   strains were,ystB(+) (84.3\%) and inv(+) (39.2\%). All strains were
   sensitive to cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid,
   streptomycin, sulfonamide, tetracycline, trimethoprim, and
   trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Resistance to gentamicin and aztreonam
   was observed in 1.9\% of the isolates. High levels of resistance were
   detected toward amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (27.8\%), ampicillin
   (75.9\%), and erythromycin (100\%). The authors hypothesize that Y.
   enterocolitica pathogenic biotypes are rather uncommon in foods when
   compared with their isolation rates from animal sources and that chicken
   meat could be contaminated as well as pig meat and its derived products.},

Abstract = {In 2007, three strains of Salmonella enterica serotype Rissen (S.
   Rissen) were isolated in the laboratory of diagnostic microbiology of
   the General Hospital of Prato, Tuscany, Italy, over a 1 month and half
   interval of time. The first isolate was recovered on January 26 from an
   outpatient with enteritis. Then, two strains were isolated on February
   16 and March 11 respectively, from central venous catheters of patients
   who were being hospitalized in two departments of the Hospital. An
   epidemiologically linked cluster of cases of salmonellosis was
   suspected. The three strains were submitted to single enzyme-amplified
   fragment length polymorphism (SE-AFLP) and XbaI macrorestriction and
   pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) that yielded undistinguishable
   profiles. Epidemiological investigations failed to identify a common
   source of infection within the Hospital. Moreover, the third patient had
   been exclusively total parenteral nutrition fed since his admission with
   a stomach cancer diagnosis. The first patient had a community-acquired
   infection, but the source of her illness was uncertain. Twenty-five
   further isolates identified in the years 2004-2007 in the same
   geographical area showed distinctly different PFGE and SE-AFLP patterns.
   The three patients seemed to represent a cluster of epidemiologically
   unrelated cases caused by a previously never recognized S. Rissen
   strain. Rapid subtyping of isolates is essential in the early
   investigation of potential outbreaks, but synthesis of conventional and
   molecular epidemiological investigation and availability of surveillance
   data is often critical to prevent the initiation of time-consuming,
   expensive and ineffective further investigations and control
   interventions.},

Abstract = {Macrophages are pivotal cells of the immune system and play a key role
   in the host defence mechanism against pathogens. To date, the importance
   of macrophages and the role of humoral response in eliciting macrophage
   activity against Myco plasma mycoides subsp. mycoides small colony
   (Mmm-SC), the causative agent of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia
   (CBPP), have only been marginally elucidated or are almost unknown. The
   present study was undertaken to investigate the changes in surface
   morphology of macrophages after in vitro infection with Mmm-SC in the
   presence of bovine immune serum. Morphological analysis was performed on
   macrophage cultures at 6 h post infection using the three-dimensional
   vision of scanning electron microscopy, Noninfected macrophages in the
   presence of negative or immune serum and macrophages infected with
   Mmm-SC in the absence of serum showed only minor cell surface changes.
   In contrast, clear surface modifications, broad veils, fine philopodia
   highlighting cell activation and small aggregates of mycoplasma closely
   attached to the macrophage membrane, were observed in infected
   macrophage cultures in the presence of immune serum. Our results suggest
   that specific humoral response to Mmm-SC may contribute and support
   phagocytic activity of macrophages.},

Abstract = {A questionnaire was distributed to the state veterinary services of all
   172 OIE countries to collect data on the different national approaches
   to dog population control. We used all 81 completed questionnaires with
   >= 80\% of the question answered to identify the different national
   approaches to the issue. The intensity of the free-roaming dog (FRD)
   problem was negatively correlated with the value of the UN's human
   development index recognized for each country. Dog bites/attacks and
   rabies were the main problems associated with FRDs, and these problems
   were reported disproportionately by less-developed countries.
   Dog-control programs (DCP) were more widely used among the
   more-developed countries. In less-developed countries, DCPs (when they
   existed at all) tended to employ killing methods (including poisoned
   baits), that are not recommended on animal-welfare grounds. (C) 2010

Abstract = {In terms of food safety in honey production, every phase of the food
   chain must be considered, farming stage included. The importance of
   primary production is emphasized in EU legislation; in detail, White
   Paper on Food Safety, Regulation EC/178/2002 and Regulation EC/852/2004
   provide many references to the key role of primary production in food
   safety management. In the above mentioned legislation, HACCP system is
   referred to as the required tool to ensure consumers safe foods,
   although its implementation is not compulsory in primary productions.
   Beekeeping, as any other farming practice, can be tackled in order to
   develop those programmes that could enable producers to place on the
   market safe products through the application of quality control
   according to the principles of HACCP.
   The present paper aims to provide a tool to identify, prevent and
   control hazards potentially occurring in the apiary practices that could
   affect honey safety, by the use of HACCP based principles.},

Abstract = {In 2005 a Mycoplasma species was isolated from ocular-conjunctival swabs
   from an adult male Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) from the Valle d'Aosta
   Region, Northern Italy. The animal suffered from bilateral ocular
   discharge with diffuse inflammation, severe corneal involvement of the
   left eye and mild corneal opacity of the right eye. Histologic
   examination revealed a keratoconjunctivitis characterized by lymphocytic
   and plasmacellular infiltration. Laboratory investigations of the
   isolate included culture, transmission electron microscopy, PCR, and
   denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, as well as DNA sequencing of
   the 16S rDNA gene. These tests identified the isolate as Mycoplasma
   mycoides subsp. capri large-colony serovar, an organism that has
   occasionally been associated with keratoconjunctivitis in goats. For a
   correct diagnosis, it is necessary to carry out laboratory
   investigations, as clinical cases of keratoconjunctivitis in wild
   ruminants are not always ascribable to Mycoplasma conjunctivae.},

Abstract = {Variability of pathological phenotypes within classical sheep scrapie
   cases has been reported for some time, but in many instances it has been
   attributed to differences in the PRNP genotype of the host. To address
   this issue we have examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western
   blotting (WB) for the disease-associated form of the prion protein
   (PrP(d)), the brains of 23 sheep from five European countries, all of
   which were of the same ARQ/ARQ genotype. As a result of IHC
   examinations, sheep were distributed into five groups with different
   phenotypes and the groups were the same regardless of the scoring method
   used, `long' or `short' PrP(d) profiling. The groups made did not
   respond to the geographical origin of the cases and did not correlate
   with the vacuolar lesion profiles, which showed a high individual
   variability Discriminatory IHC and WB methods coincided to detect a
   `CH1641-like' case but otherwise correlated poorly in the classification
   of disease phenotypes. No other polymorphisms of the PRNP gene were
   found that could account for the pathological differences, except
   perhaps for a sheep from Spain with a mutation at codon 103 and a unique
   pathological phenotype Preliminary evidence indicates that those
   different IHC phenotypes correlate with distinct biological properties
   on bioassay, suggesting that they are indicative of strain diversity We
   therefore conclude that natural scrapie strains exist and that they can
   be revealed by detailed pathological examinations, which can be
   harmonized between laboratories to produce comparable results},

Abstract = {1. In veterinary species, little information about extrahepatic drug
   metabolism is actually available.
   2. Therefore, the presence of foremost drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs)
   and related transcription factors mRNAs was initially investigated in
   cattle testis; then, their possible modulation following the in vivo
   exposure to illicit growth promoters (GPs), which represent a major
   issue in cattle farming, was explored.
   3. All target genes were expressed in cattle testis, albeit to a lower
   extent compared to liver ones; furthermore, illicit protocols containing
   dexamethasone and 17 beta-oestradiol significantly up-regulated
   cytochrome P450 1A1, 2E1, oestrogen receptor-a and peroxisome
   proliferator-activated receptor-a mRNA levels.
   4. Overall, the constitutive expression of foremost DMEs and related
   transcription factors was demonstrated for the first time in cattle
   testis and illicit GPs were shown to affect pre-transcriptionally some
   of them, with possible consequences upon testicular xenobiotic drug
   metabolism.},

Title = {The effect of rabbit population control programmes on the impact of
   rabbit haemorrhagic disease in south-eastern Australia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {P>1. The effect of rabbit population density on transmission of rabbit
   haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is a critical aspect of disease
   ecology for rabbit control and rabbit conservation. We examined the
   interaction between rabbit control and spread of RHDV and a
   non-pathogenic calicivirus (bCV) in Australian wild rabbit populations,
   and reviewed existing recommendations for control in this context.
   2. Rabbits were sampled at eight pairs of sites; from rabbit populations
   where densities had been reduced by conventional control and from
   matching uncontrolled populations. Sites chosen ranged from hot, arid
   areas where RHDV had greatly reduced rabbit numbers to cooler,
   higher-rainfall areas where rabbits remained more abundant. Virus
   activity was implied from antibody profiles in sera of surviving
   rabbits.
   3. Reducing population density by conventional control had a similar
   effect on disease transmission despite a seven-fold difference in
   initial density. Populations reduced by 70\% or more had lower RHDV
   antibody prevalence in juvenile rabbits but not in adult rabbits,
   indicating that reducing rabbit density slowed but did not stop RHDV
   transmission. We found no interactions between rabbit control, RHDV and
   bCV that could be exploited to improve rabbit management.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Delayed RHDV infection in rabbit control
   sites is likely to be offset by higher mortality in older rabbits, so
   that conventional rabbit control does not reduce the impact of RHDV on
   rabbit populations. Only minor changes to delay the timing of summer
   rabbit control programmes in cooler areas of Australia are necessary to
   take best advantage of RHDV-induced reduction in rabbit numbers. For
   conservation management of rabbits in Europe, these findings indicate
   that RHDV may continue to have a severe impact on rabbit populations
   that have been reduced to low population density, but also raise the
   possibility that bCVs might be introduced to rabbit populations to aid
   their recovery.},

Abstract = {Mesenchymal stem cells are a virtually ubiquitous population of adult
   stem cells, able to differentiate into various tissue lineages. As they
   are multipotent and easy to grow in culture, they are at present
   considered very attractive candidates for tissue repair and gene
   therapy. With the exception of a few reports, mesenchymal stem cell
   morphology has been widely disregarded in the past years. In this paper
   we discuss the establishment of mesenchymal stem cell cultures from
   equine adipose tissue and describe their fine structure by transmission
   electron microscopy. The cultured cells revealed a fibroblastoid
   appearance and were characterized by an eccentric nucleus with multiple
   nucleoli, dense cytoplasm rich in ribosomes, a rough endoplasmic
   reticulum with dilated cisternae, elongated mitochondria and
   heterogeneous vacuolar inclusions. In addition, they were often
   interconnected by adhesion structures located on the cell body and on
   cytoplasmic processes contacting other cells. The features observed are
   evocative of an undifferentiated cellular phenotype and of an intense
   synthetic and metabolic activity.},

Abstract = {Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) infection in ruminants
   is a significant problem due to the high prevalence of the infection and
   to recent research data strengthening the link between the pathogen and
   some human inflammatory bowel disease. Control through
   hygiene-management measures and test and culling of positive animals is
   the approach generally applied with certain success in western
   countries. Nonetheless, these measures are not systematically applied
   among territories and standardised protocols are still absent.
   Therefore, an increase of the prevalence of paratuberculosis have been
   observed in the recent years, and eradication is a challenge. For these
   reasons, the identification of new control methods is needed. On the
   light of recent studies, the application of vaccination plans in dairy
   cattle is reconsidered, since it provides benefits in terms of milk
   production, extension of the life of the animals and reduction of
   environmental contamination. These reflections have a positive impact on
   the farmers, but interferences with the diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis
   have been limiting the use of vaccination. A new and promising approach
   for paratuberculosis control, is based on the recent identification of
   specific genetic loci associated with susceptibility to the disease.
   Once determined in larger cohorts of animals, it would be possible to
   select the animals on the basis of the genetic resistance to the
   disease. In this article, the implementation of current control programs
   based on sanitary risks management in the farm with these new approaches
   is discussed.},

Abstract = {One hundred sixty-one Prototheca spp. strains isolated from composite
   milk and barn-surrounding environmental samples (bedding, feces,

   strains isolated from composite milk samples were characterized as
   Prototheca zopfii genotype 2, confirming its role as the main mastitis
   pathogen, whereas Prototheca blaschkeae was only sporadically isolated
   (2.8\%). Regarding environmental sampling, 84.9\% of isolates belonged
   to P. zopfii genotype 2, 13.2\% to P. blaschkeae, and 1.9\% to P. zopfii
   genotype 1. The data herein contradict previous hypotheses about the
   supposed exclusive role of P. zopfii, genotype 2 as the causative agent
   of protothecal mastitis and, on the contrary; confirm the hypothesis
   that such pathology could be caused by P. blaschkeae in a few instances.},

Abstract = {A method for determination of 11 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
   in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis), using HPLC coupled to a
   fluorescence detector, has been optimised and validated, according to
   European Community rules. Sample preparation involves alkaline digestion
   of mussel tissue, liquid-liquid extraction of organic compounds and
   solid phase clean-up. Accuracy and precision of the method were
   determined by a validation study, carried out to demonstrate that the
   method is useful for both screening purposes and confirmation.
   Commission Regulation (EC) No. 2007/333/EC stated the performance
   criteria for the analysis of the only benzo{[}a]pyrene (BaP) in food
   products of animal origin, since BaP is the most studied PAH. We
   extended the BaP analysis performance criteria to other 10 toxic PAHs
   (listed in Commission Recommendation (EC) No. 2005/108/EC) and the
   validation study was performed also in agreement with Commission
   Decision (EC) No. 2002/657/EC. The method was applied to investigate 27
   mussel samples from actively producing shellfish plants located in
   Campania (Italy) and variable levels of PAHs were detected ranging from
   <0.2 to 16 mu g/kg wet weight. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Anaplasma species are transmitted by ticks and cause diseases in humans
   and animals. These pathogens infect sheep, an economically important
   domestic animal worldwide. The current study was designed to
   characterize in 200 animals the infection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum
   and Anaplasma ovis and the genetic diversity of A. ovis strains
   collected from a naturally infected sheep flock with poor health
   condition. Sheep had 98\% seroprevalence to Anaplasma spp. antibodies.
   PCR results confirmed the presence of A. phagocytophilum and A. ovis DNA
   in 11.5\% and 37\% of the sheep, respectively. Concurrent infections
   were detected in 6.5\% of the sheep. Seventy-one adult ticks were
   collected from 45 sheep with infestations ranging from one to 15 ticks
   per animal. The analysis of A. ovis msp4 sequences demonstrated a
   previously unreported polymorphism for this pathogen with 17 different
   haplotypes in infected sheep. These results demonstrated that, although
   A. ovis msp4 haplotypes may be less variable when compared with
   Anaplasma marginale and A. phagocytophilum strains on a global scale,
   genetic polymorphisms occur in this locus in strains obtained from an
   infected sheep flock with poor health condition.},

Abstract = {The objectives of this study were to compare the effectiveness of
   different indicators of mammary inflammation in buffalo and to evaluate
   the association of the indicators with buffalo milk yield, composition,
   and rennet coagulation properties. This study was carried out at four
   buffalo farms in central Italy using a total of 50 lactating buffalo.
   Milk from each buffalo was tested at the beginning, middle, and end of
   lactation. To evaluate the relationship between mastitis markers and
   milk components, three classes were defined for each of the following
   markers: total somatic cell count (TSCC), differential somatic cell
   count (DSCC), and bacteriological results The regression coefficient for
   the reference method and the alternative method of determining TSCC was
   0.81, indicating that the method routinely used to analyze buffalo milk
   consistently underestimated actual TSCC. The milk samples positive for
   udder-specific bacteria also had higher TSCC values than the samples
   that were negative for bacteria (872 x 10(3)/ml vs. 191 x 10(3)/ml). In
   samples that were positive for udder-specific bacteria,
   polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) made up greater than 50\% of the
   cells. Moreover, only 1\% of the samples in the lowest TSCC class were
   positive for bacteria. The correlation between TSCC and PMN was stronger
   (0.70), and PMN values in buffalo milk increased significantly when the
   TSCC class changed from low (38\%) to medium and high (56\% and 64\%).
   Milk yield was negatively related to TSCC. Significant changes in
   lactose (4.87\%, 4.80\% and 4.64\%) and chloride content (0.650 mg/ml,
   0.862 mg/ml and 0.882 mg/ml) were also observed with increasing TSCC
   values. Higher TSCC was associated with impaired rennet coagulation
   properties: the clotting time increased, while the curd firming time (p
   <= 0.05) and firmness decreased. We concluded that in buffalo as in
   dairy cows, TSCC is a valid indicator of udder inflammation; we also
   confirmed that a value of 200 x 10(3) cells/ml should be used as the
   threshold value for early identification of an animal affected by
   subclinical mastitis. In addition to its association with significantly
   decreased milk yield, a TSCC value above this threshold value was
   associated with changes in milk composition and coagulating properties.},

Title = {The Posterior Approach in the Treatment of Popliteal Artery Aneurysm:
   Feasibility and Analysis of Outcome},
Journal = {ANNALS OF VASCULAR SURGERY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {24},

Abstract = {Background: This review evaluates the results of our 18-year experience
   with surgical treatment of popliteal artery aneurysms (PAAs), examining
   the effects of the variables of clinical presentations, surgical
   technique, graft material, and runoff on operative results in the
   management of popliteal aneurysms.
   Methods: We reviewed 49 PAAs consecutively repaired in 35 patients. We
   preferentially use, if possible, the posterior approach for repair of
   popliteal aneurysms. We repaired aneurysms passing above the Hunter
   canal using a medial approach to allow for adequate exposure of the
   proximal neck of the aneurysm. We separately analyzed the results of
   patients who underwent the posterior approach (group A) and those that
   underwent the medial approach (group B). Primary, primary assisted, and
   secondary patency were established using life-tables analysis.
   Results: In our experience, the posterior approach was used in 38
   repairs (77.6\%), followed by graft interposition (group A). PAAs were
   asymptomatic in 29 (59.2\%) of 49 cases. Among 20 symptomatic PAAs, nine
   (18.4\%) caused intermittent claudication, one (2.0\%) caused rest pain
   and trophic wound, and the remaining 10 limbs (20.4\%) presented with
   acute ischemia and limb threat. A total of 11 popliteal aneurysms
   (22.4\%) required repair with a medial approach (group B) because the
   extension of the aneurysm was proximal to the adductor hiatus. The
   primary patency rates at 6 and 8 years were 94.3 and 83.8\%,
   respectively, for group A and 100\% (p = .43) and 19.1\% (p = .001) for
   group B, the respective assisted primary patency rates were 97.3 and
   86.3\%, in group A and 100\% (p = .43) and 19.1\% (p = .001) for group
   B. The secondary patency rates at 6 months and 8 years were 97.3 and
   97.3\%, respectively, in group A and 90.9\% (p - .34) and 77.9\% (p -
   .05) in group B. Amputation occurred in two (4.1\%) of 49 limbs and
   30-day postoperative mortality was 2.0\% (1/49 patients). There was no
   statistical difference in amputation rate in symptomatic and
   asymptomatic limbs, and in group A and B.
   Conclusion: We believe that the posterior approach is the gold standard
   surgical therapy to treat PPAs not extending above the Hunter canal. In
   our experience, the posterior approach was possible in 77.6\% of cases.
   It has excellent patency and prevents further aneurysm expansion by
   completely interrupting the collateral circulation to the aneurysm sac.
   In contrast, the posterior approach had a slightly higher tibial nerve
   injury (p = .43), especially during the learning curve. The preoperative
   symptoms and the use of venous material for reconstruction affect
   significantly long-term patency.},

Abstract = {An outbreak of toxoplasmosis occurring in a typical farm of 524 ovines
   was monitored for 1 year after the occurrence of 31 abortions. Abortion
   events involved 7.2\% of 430 pregnant sheep. Presence of antibodies to
   Toxoplasma gondii in sheep sera was investigated by the indirect
   fluorescence antibody test (IFAT). A total of 422 ewes were bled four
   times during the year, and an epidemiological analysis was performed on
   all serology data collected in this subgroup. The prevalence of IgG
   positives ranged from 31.52\% (133/422) at the first sampling to 62.56\%
   (264/422) at the fourth sampling. Incidence of IgG antibodies was
   38.75\% at the second sampling, 14.92\% at the third and 29.28\% at the
   fourth sampling. At the beginning of the study, prevalence was 70.7\% in
   primiparous sheep and 20.9\% in sheep older than 5 years; at the third
   sampling, prevalence was stable at 70\% in pluriparous sheep. The mean
   prevalence of IgM antibodies was 14.87\%. A total of 147 out of all 524
   ovines of the flock tested positive for IgM in more than one sampling.
   After an initial positivity, 60 sheep tested negative for IgG at the
   following serological controls (4 between the first and the second
   sampling, 30 between the second and the third and 28 between the third
   and the fourth sampling). One stray cat was positive for IgG, with a
   titre of 1 : 320. Moreover, one of the farmers was also positive, with a
   titre of 1 : 160 for IgG. A positive PCR result for T. gondii DNA was
   also observed in aliquots of grain and pellets taken from feed stocks
   amassed inside the sheds without protection, suggesting that an adequate
   management of the farm might be useful, if not essential, for
   controlling T. gondii outbreaks in ovine flocks.},

Abstract = {Canine vector-borne diseases (CVBDs) are highly prevalent and increasing
   in distribution worldwide. A longitudinal study was conducted in
   southern Italy to determine the incidence of and protection against
   CVBD-causing pathogens in dogs treated with a combination of
   imidacloprid 10\% and permethrin 50\% (ImPer). One hundred eleven
   autochthonous young dogs were divided into group A (n = 63) and group B
   (n = 48), both groups containing dogs positive and negative for one or
   more CVBD-causing pathogens. Additionally, 10 naive male beagles were
   introduced in each group in May 2008. Group A was treated with ImPer on
   day 0 and every 21 2 days whereas group B was left untreated. Blood and
   skin samples were collected at baseline (March-April 2008) and at the
   first, second and third follow-up times (July and October 2008 and April
   2009). Bone marrow was sampled at baseline and at the third follow-up.
   Serological, cytological and molecular tests were performed to detect
   Anaplasma platys, Babesia spp., Bartonella spp., Dirofilaria immitis,
   Ehrlichia canis, Hepatozoon canis and Leishmania infantum. Ectoparasites
   (fleas, ticks, and sand flies) were monitored throughout the study. The
   baseline prevalence of CVBDs was 39.6\% with 44 dogs positive for at
   least one pathogen. A. platys (27.5\%) and Babesia spp. (15.6\%) were
   the most prevalent species and co-infections with up to two pathogens
   were detected in 16 (14.7\%) individuals. At the end of the evaluation
   period, there was a 90.7\% reduction in overall CVBD incidence density
   rate (IDR) in group A, as following: 100\% reduction in L infantum;
   94.6\% in E. canis; 94.4\% in Babesia spp.; and 81.8\% in A. platys.
   Initially positive treated dogs showed significantly lower pathogen
   prevalence at the third follow-up than untreated ones. At the end of the
   evaluation period, 8 of the 10 untreated beagles were infected with at
   least one pathogen whereas one of the treated beagles was A. platys
   positive at a single time point (second follow-up). Overall efficacy
   against ticks was 97.9\%. In October 2009, samples were collected from
   the remaining 83 dogs (44 from group A and 39 from group B) to
   investigate the annual incidence of CVBDs in the same, at this time
   untreated, dog population. A high year incidence for tick-borne diseases
   (78.1\%) and for L infantum (13.6\%) was detected in dogs from group A.
   seven months after the treatment had been withdrawn. The results
   demonstrate that ImPer preventive treatment against arthropods protects
   autochthonous and naive beagle dogs against CVBD-causing pathogens. (C)

Title = {Analysis of serum proteins in clinically healthy goats (Capra hircus)
   using agarose gel electrophoresis},
Journal = {VETERINARY CLINICAL PATHOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {39},
Number = {3},
Pages = {317-321},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background
   Electrophoretic patterns of serum proteins provide useful information on
   pathological conditions in ruminants. Their reference values, however,
   are dissimilar to those of other species. Reference values for goats
   using agarose gel as the supporting matrix have not been reported.
   Objective
   The aim of this study was to evaluate serum concentrations of total
   protein and protein fractions (albumin and globulins) by means of
   agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) in goats in order to establish
   electrophoretic reference intervals and to evaluate potential changes
   associated with aging.
   Methods
   Blood was collected from 105 clinically healthy Girgentana goats by
   means of jugular venipuncture. Serum protein concentrations were
   assessed by AGE. Three age groups were compared: 1-1.5 years, 2-4 years,
   and 5-12 years.
   Results
   Values (mean +/- SD) were determined for concentrations of total protein
   (72.26 +/- 6.40 g/L), albumin (31.80 +/- 4.00 g/L), alpha-globulins
   (6.40 +/- 1.23 g/L), beta(1)-globulins (10.50 +/- 2.58 g/L),
   beta(2)-globulins (5.18 +/- 1.60 g/L), and gamma-globulins (18.65 +/-
   5.90 g/L) and for albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio (0.82 +/- 0.20). One-way
   ANOVA showed statistically significant age-related differences for total
   protein and alpha-globulin concentrations and A/G ratios. Age influenced
   protein concentrations with the 5-12-year-old group having higher total
   protein and alpha-globulin concentrations and lower albumin
   concentration and A/G ratios than the 2-4-year-old group.
   Conclusions
   This study provides reference values for total protein concentrations
   and protein fractions obtained by AGE in goats. Some values vary with
   age. Age-specific reference intervals are reported in order to provide
   clinicians with an additional diagnostic aid.},

Abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes enters non-phagocytic cells by binding its
   surface proteins inlA (internalin) and inlB to the host's E-cadherin and
   Met, respectively. The two internalins play either separate or
   cooperative roles in the colonization of infected tissues. Here, we
   studied bacterial uptake into HeLa cells using an L. monocytogenes
   mutant strain (Delta inlA) carrying a deletion in the gene coding for
   inlA. The Delta inlA mutant strain showed the capability to invade HeLa
   cells. The monoclonal anti-beta(3)- and anti-beta(1)-integrin subunit
   antibodies prevented bacterial uptake into the cells, while the
   anti-beta(2)- and anti-beta(4)-integrin subunit antibodies failed to
   affect L. monocytogenes entry into HeLa cells. Three structurally
   distinct disintegrins (kistrin, echistatin and flavoridin) also
   inhibited bacterial uptake, showing different potencies correlated to
   their selective affinity for the beta(3)- and beta(1)-integrin subunits.
   In addition to inducing Met phosphorylation, infection of cells by the
   L. monocytogenes Delta inlA mutant strain promoted the tyrosine
   phosphorylation of the focal adhesion-associated proteins FAK and
   paxillin. Our findings provide the first evidence that beta(3)- and
   beta(1)-integrin receptors play a role in the inlB-dependent
   internalization of L. monocytogenes into host cells.},

Abstract = {The proportion of Campylobacter spp. isolates that are resistant to
   fluoroquinolones, the drugs of choice for campylobacteriosis, has been
   increasing worldwide. We developed an innovative method based on a
   Luminex xMAP (TM) DNA suspension array that allows the identification of
   Campylobacter species and, simultaneously, the detection of the most
   common point mutation in the gyrA gene (substitution from threonine 86
   to isoleucine 86) that is responsible for fluoroquinolone resistance.
   Ninety-six Campylobacter coli and Campylobacter jejuni isolates
   collected from turkeys were first investigated by microdilution test to
   characterize the antimicrobial resistance patterns. The isolates,
   amplified for the quinolone resistance determining region of the gyrA
   gene, were then tested using Luminex suspension array. The reliability
   of the method was demonstrated by the total concordance between the
   results obtained using Luminex and those of the sequencing of gyrA
   polymerase chain reaction products. The genotypic characterization of
   fluoroquinolone resistance using Luminex was also consistent with the
   data on phenotypical resistance obtained by microdilution test. The
   results of this study strongly support the potential of Luminex xMAP
   technology as an efficient molecular method for the rapid and accurate
   identification of C. coli and C. jejuni isolates and the
   characterization of the major determinant of fluoroquinolone resistance.},

Abstract = {A robust and dependable headspace HS-GC-MS method has been developed for
   the determination of carbon monoxide (CO) treated tuna fish.
   The performance of the method has been evaluated by analyzing spiked and
   blank samples.
   The proposed method uses a programmed temperature vaporizing (PTV)
   injector to implement the HS injection and overcome the negative effects
   on the column of water contained in the sample. The level of CO could be
   easily detected in the treated samples, its amount differing markedly
   from that detected in the untreated samples. Proper oven temperature
   programming prevented any deterioration of chromatographic performance
   caused by the accumulation of water, carbon dioxide and other low
   molecular weight hydrocarbons in the column during serial analyses. The
   introduction of PTV injection and the restoring of GC column, by oven
   temperature programming, were crucial for obtaining the required
   robustness. This procedure assures the run-to-run repeatability
   necessary for high throughput applications. The method affords linear
   calibration curves ranging from 50 to 2500 ng/g of CO content in tuna
   sample. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {Genetic variability of the ovine parasite Haemonchus contortus from the
   Alpine area was investigated using mitochondrial DNA (nd4 gene),

   (Capreolus capreolus), alpine ibex (Capra ibex ibex), domestic goat
   (Capra hircus) and sheep (Ovis aries) from different alpine areas. The
   data obtained show low host specificity and high genetic variation
   within H. contortus populations. The analyses indicate the presence of
   two mitochondrial haplotype clusters among host species and the absence
   of cryptic parasite species, confirming H. contortus as a generalist
   nematode and suggesting that parasite transmission between populations
   of domestic and wild ruminants normally occurs.},

Abstract = {A specific, sensitive and robust liquid chromatography tandem mass
   spectrometry method for determining oxytetracycline, tetracycline,
   chlortetracycline and doxycycline in royal jelly and honey samples is
   presented. Extraction of drug residues was performed by ammonium acetate
   buffer as extractant followed by a clean-up with metal chelate affinity
   chromatography and solid-phase extraction. Tetracycline analysis was
   performed using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation-tandem
   mass spectrometry. The presented method is the first validated for royal
   jelly and in accordance with the requirements set by Commission Decision
   2002/657/EC. Recoveries of the methods, calculated spiking the samples
   at 5.0, 10.0, 20.0 and 30.0 mu g kg(-1), were 79\% to 90\% for honey and
   77\% to 90\% for royal jelly. The intra-day precision (RSD) ranged
   between 8.1\% and 15.0\% for honey and from 9.1\% to 16.3\% for royal
   jelly, while inter-day precision values were from 10.2\% to 17.6\% and
   from 10.6\% to 18.4\% respectively for honey and royal jelly. Linearity
   for the four analytes was calculated from 5.0 to 50.0 mu g kg(-1). The
   decision limits (CC alpha) ranged from 6.2 to 6.4 mu g kg(-1) and from
   6.1 to 6.5 mu g kg(-1) for honey and royal jelly, respectively.
   Detection capabilities values (CC beta) ranged between 7.2 and 7.7 mu g
   kg(-1) and from 7.3 to 7.9 mu g kg(-1) respectively for honey and royal
   jelly. The developed method is currently in use for confirmation of the
   official control analysis of honey and royal jelly samples.},

Abstract = {The present study was undertaken to find out the association of certain
   risk factors with the positive SCCIT (single comparative cervical
   intradermal tuberculin) test in water buffaloes at Faisalabad and Okara,
   Pakistan. Seventy-six herds (697 buffaloes) at Faisalabad and 56 (395
   buffaloes) at Okara were included in the study. The buffaloes were
   screened through SCCIT Test. Positive reaction to SCCIT test was
   recorded in 14\% of herds and in 3\% of buffaloes. The herds positive
   for this test were 18\% when herds with less than 10 animals were
   excluded from the analysis and these were 19\% when herds with less than
   10 buffaloes were excluded. The results of logistic analysis (crude and
   adjusted) revealed the association of lactating status of buffaloes (OR
   = 1.8) and the presence of cattle at the farm (OR = 2-4) with positive
   SCCIT test. After controlling for the farm, the risk of a positive skin
   test was 1.5 times higher if we change the location of the animal.
   Similarly, the controlled analysis (for the farm, breed and other
   variables) revealed an increased risk (OR = 1.1) of a positive skin test
   with the increase in cattle at the farm. The breed controlled stratified
   analysis showed the association of a number of cattle at the farm with a
   positive skin test. It can be concluded from the study that the
   prevalence of tuberculosis on the basis of a positive skin test is
   higher at herd level and lower at animal level. Further the risk of a
   positive skin test is higher when cattle are present at the farm. (C)

   mixed-breed young dogs and 10 beagles were enrolled in the study. From
   March 2008 until March 2009, every 21 +/- 2 days, 11 body sites of each
   dog were checked for ticks. At each follow-up, the number of ticks,
   their developmental stage, sex and location on the dog's body were
   recorded. Adult ticks were found throughout the year, but immatures were
   absent in January and February. The adult tick population increased from
   July to August, whereas the load of immatures increased in early July
   and peaked in September, which suggests that R. sanguineus develops one
   generation per year in this area. The mean number of immature ticks per
   infested dog was higher than that of adults from March to October 2008.
   Ears, interdigital areas and armpits were the most frequent attachment
   sites of adult ticks. At the last follow-up, a total of 2266 ticks were
   collected and identified as R. sanguineus. The results suggest that R.
   sanguineus develops one generation per year in the study area, but that
   it infests dogs in all seasons. This information should be taken into
   account when planning control programmes against this tick species and
   the pathogens it transmits.},

Abstract = {The methicillin was introduced for the first time in human medicine in
   the 50s for the treatment of infections caused by
   penicillinase-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Resistance to methicillin
   is mediated by a protein, penicillin binding protein (PBP 2a) that has
   low affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics. The protein PBP 2a is encoded
   by the gene mecA. The aim of our study was to document the presence of
   strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS) isolates from nasal
   swabs bilateral horses and of personnel for the animals and to determine
   the genetic relationship between them. Nasal swabs from horses have been
   isolated total of 42 strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococci,
   including S. xylosus (47.6\%), S. sciuri (40.5\%), S. lentus (7.1\%), S.
   aureus (2.4\%) and S. capitis (2.4\%). All isolates contained the mecA
   gene as confirmed by the analysis of PCR. Our study is further evidence
   that horses can act as a reservoir of MRS and a source of infection and
   reinfection in humans.},

Abstract = {Canine vector-borne diseases (CVBDs) pose a diagnostic challenge,
   particularly when a dog is coinfected with more than one pathogen. The
   purpose of this study was to generate information about the diagnosis of
   CVBDs in young dogs following their first exposure to flea, tick, sand
   fly, louse, and mosquito vectors. From March 2008 to May 2009, 10
   purpose-bred young naive beagle dogs and a cohort of 48 mixed-breed dogs
   living in an area to which CVBD is endemic in southern Italy were
   monitored using different diagnostic tests (cytology, serology, and
   PCR). Overall, PCR detected the highest number of dogs infected with
   Anaplasma platys, Babesia vogeli, and Ehrlichia canis, whereas
   seroconversion was a more sensitive indicator of exposure to Leishmania
   infantum. For A. platys infection, combining blood and buffy coat
   cytology in parallel enhanced the relative sensitivity (SErel) (87.3\%).
   For B. vogeli, the best diagnostic combination was buffy coat cytology
   and serology used in parallel (SErel, 67.5\%), whereas serology and PCR
   used in parallel (SErel, 100\%) was the best combination for L.
   infantum. Overall, 12 (20.7\%) dogs were coinfected; however, the
   percentage of new coinfections decreased from baseline (50\%) to the
   first (33.3\%) and second (16.6\%) follow-up time points. Numbers of
   coinfections with A. platys and B. vogeli were significantly higher (P <
   0.05) than coinfections with other pathogen combinations. The data
   generated in this study provide insights on the incidence of certain
   pathogens infecting young dogs in southern Italy, highlight important
   diagnostic testing limitations, and support the use of multiple
   diagnostic modalities when attempting to confirm a tick-borne infection
   in an individual dog or in a canine population.},

Abstract = {Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses of the H5 and H7
   subtype pose a major public health threat due to their capacity to cross
   the species barrier and infect mammals, for example dogs, cats and
   humans. In the present study we tested the capacity of selected H7 and
   H5 HPAI viruses to infect and to be transmitted from infected BALB/c
   mice to contact sentinels. Previous experiments have shown that viruses
   belonging to both H5 and H7 subtypes replicate in the respiratory tract
   and central nervous system of experimentally infected mice. In this
   study we show that selected H7N1 and H5N1 HPAI viruses can be
   transmitted from mouse-to-mouse by direct contact, and that in
   experimentally infected animals they exhibit a different pattern of
   replication and transmission. Our results can be considered as a
   starting point for transmission experiments involving other influenza A
   viruses with alpha 2-3 receptor affinity in order to better understand
   the viral factors influencing transmissibility of these viruses in
   selected mammalian species.},

Abstract = {The placenta is important in the horizontal transmission of the
   aetiological agent in scrapie-affected sheep. It has been demonstrated
   that the placentas of fetuses carrying the dimorphism Q171R of the PRNP
   gene is resistant to pathological prion protein (PrPsc) accumulation in
   the placenta. To test whether other PRNP polymorphisms are associated
   with a lack of placental PrPsc deposition, we carried out a study on 26
   naturally and 11 experimentally scrapie-affected ewes with or without
   clinical signs. PrPsc was detected in the placenta of ARQ/ARQ(wild)
   (type) fetuses by Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis, but not
   in ARQN(176)/ARQK(176) or, as expected, ARQ/ARR samples. Furthermore,
   three of four AL(141)RQ/AF(141)RQ placentas were also PrPsc negative,
   suggesting that the dimorphism at codon 141 may also mediate placental
   deposition of PrPsc. This finding demonstrates for the first time that
   fetal PRNP polymorphisms, other than those at codon 171, are associated
   with the lack of placental deposition of PrPsc.},

Abstract = {In this study, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) responses in whole blood
   cultures stimulated with tuberculins from different sources were
   compared with regard to their diagnostic reliability in cattle
   experimentally and naturally infected with Mycobacterium bovis. The
   IFN-gamma responses to different concentrations of purified protein
   derivatives (PPDs) from M bovis and Mycobacterium avium were quantified.
   Significant differences (P<0.05) between sources and concentrations of
   PPDs used for stimulation were detected, indicating a need for
   standardisation of PPDs used in the IFN-gamma assay. Additionally, a
   tool named `relative potency 30' that allows rapid comparison of batches
   and sources of PPDs was defined.},

Title = {Identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from ovine
   milk samples by PCR-RFLP of 16S rRNA and gap genes},

Abstract = {The identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) causing
   ovine infections remains problematic, although these bacteria are
   considered the main etiologic agents of subclinical mastitis in sheep
   and goats. In this study, 226 CNS isolates were collected from 2201
   milking sarda sheep belonging to 15 flocks with high somatic cell count
   scores. All isolates were subjected to identification with the API Staph
   ID test, and then to the amplification of staphylococcal 16S rRNA and
   gap genes by PCR assays. The gap gene was subjected to restriction
   fragment length polymorphism analysis with the restriction endonuclease
   AluI, whereas the 16S rRNA gene was subjected to ribosomal
   fingerprinting with the restriction endonucleases RsaI, PstI and AluI.
   When PCR-RFLP patterns of CNS isolates were different from those of
   their reference strains, gap gene amplicons were sequenced for
   definitive identification. The API Staph ID test, in alternative to the
   genotypic identification method, produced considerably different results
   in terms of species identified within each group. Using the PCR-RFLP
   assay, most of the isolates clustered together with the Staphylococcus
   epidermidis type strain (131, corresponding to 57.9\%), followed by S.
   caprae (34, corresponding to 15\%) and S. chromogenes (30, corresponding
   to 13.2\%). In conclusion, the PCR-RFLP assay of 165 rRNA and gap genes
   is a more reliable and reproducible method than the API Staph ID test
   for the identification of CNS causing sheep mastitis. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Title = {Evaluation of the House Fly Musca domestica as a Mechanical Vector for
   an Anthrax},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 17},
Abstract = {Anthrax is a disease of human beings and animals caused by the
   encapsulated, spore-forming, Bacillus anthracis. The potential role of
   insects in the spread of B. anthracis to humans and domestic animals
   during an anthrax outbreak has been confirmed by many studies. Among
   insect vectors, the house fly Musca domestica is considered a potential
   agent for disease transmission. In this study, laboratory-bred specimens
   of Musca domestica were infected by feeding on anthrax-infected rabbit
   carcass or anthrax contaminated blood, and the presence of anthrax
   spores in their spots (faeces and vomitus) was microbiologically
   monitored. It was also evaluated if the anthrax spores were able to
   germinate and replicate in the gut content of insects. These results
   confirmed the role of insects in spreading anthrax infection. This role,
   although not major, given the huge size of fly populations often
   associated with anthrax epidemics in domestic animals, cannot be
   neglected from an epidemiological point of view and suggest that fly
   control should be considered as part of anthrax control programs.},

Abstract = {Comparative genomic analysis of a wild-type strain of the ovine pathogen

   temperature-sensitive and virulence-attenuated live vaccine derivative
   identified point mutations unique to the mutant (Burall et al. {[}1])
   Here, we evaluate the capacity of some of these mutations to either
   create or eliminate restriction sites using the wild-type strain C.
   abortus S26/3 as a reference Three of eight genomic sites with confirmed
   point mutations (CAB153, CAB636 and CAB648) were retained for analysis
   as each resulted in the loss of a restriction site in the genome
   sequence of the vaccine strain. PCR-restriction fragment length
   polymorphism analysis using restriction enzymes chosen to specifically
   target the three genomic sites was then applied to a large number of C.
   abortus field isolates and reference strains Our results indicate that
   the three mutations are uniquely present in the vaccine strain, and as
   such provide easy-to-use markers for the differential identification of
   the vaccine strain and wild-type Isolates (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The prevention and control of disease outbreaks is essential to protect
   and raise the health status and condition of food-producing animals in
   the EU. An important result can rise through the strengthening of the
   research activities in the European Animal Health sector such as the
   development of new monitoring strategies, diagnostics and therapies. In
   order to build up a communal research agenda and mutual research
   activities on this sector, the EMIDA (Emerging and Major Infectious
   Disease of Livestock) ERAnet (European Research Area network) project
   collected information on the European Animal Health landscape through a
   questionnaire and carried out a study to identify perceived needs of the
   EU Animal Health Area. The information, collected from 19 countries, was
   useful for the organization of a pilot trans-national call opened the 7
   (th) September 2009. The call makes available about 20 million Euros for
   research projects on the following topics: vector borne disease;
   zoonosis and antibiotic resistance; major infectious disease of
   livestock; aquaculture. The participation of Italian Research Institutes
   to the call has been copious and represents a great opportunity to
   develop a durable focused network with others European research
   organizations.},

Abstract = {Betanodaviruses are the causal agents of viral encephalo-retinopathy, an
   infectious disease affecting more than 40 marine fish species,
   characterized by high morbidity and mortality. Because of its severe
   impact, robust diagnostic tools are required. The aim of this work was
   to develop and validate a real-time TaqMan PCR assay to detect
   betanodaviruses in clinical specimens by amplifying a conserved region
   of the RNA2 strand. The method proved to be specific and sensitive,
   being capable of detecting as low as 10 TCID(50)/ml. For clinical
   validation, samples from 100 marine fish were collected during a natural
   outbreak of disease and tested by three distinct laboratory methods,
   namely real-time TaqMan PCR, RT-seminested PCR and virus isolation. The
   results indicated optimal agreement between tests. The assay that was
   developed is capable of detecting members of all of the betanodavirus
   genetic groups currently described and can be considered a valid
   alternative to the time-consuming and contamination-prone nested PCR.},

Abstract = {The study compared the performance of three screening serological tests:
   buffered plate antigen (BPA), Rose-Bengal produced with 1119-3 Brucella
   abortus strain (RB1119-3), and Rose-Bengal produced with 99 Brucella
   abortus strain (RB99). Sera from 696 adult female animals were submitted
   to BPA, RB1119-3, RB99, 2-mercaptoethanol test (ME), and complement
   fixation test (FC). The gold standard was the combination of CF and ME.
   The Kappa values for BPA, RB99, and RB1119-3 were 0.82, 0.74, and 0.70,
   respectively. The relative sensitivity and specificity for the same
   tests were 0.98 and 0.96, 0.92 and 0.94, and 0.95 and 0.92,

Abstract = {The highly divergent SRLV genotype E has recently been characterized in
   Italy as a low pathogenic caprine lentivirus in the Roccaverano breed.
   The availability of a genotype specific diagnostic test based on a
   comparative assay, using a combination of genotype specific recombinant
   antigens allows a wide serosurvey in other goat populations. The island
   of Sardinia still has the highest small ruminant population of any
   Italian region and crossbreeding has been limited to goats, mainly with
   the Maltese breed.
   A serological survey was carried out on sheep flocks and goat herds,
   using individual sera as well as a bulk milk-adapted procedure. Genotype
   E was identified in more than 50\% of goat herds and none of the sheep
   flocks thus supporting the idea that this genotype is specifically
   associated with the goat species. The full-length proviral sequence of a
   Sardinian isolate revealed and confirmed the deletion of dUTPase subunit
   and the absence of both vpr gene and the 71 bp repeat of the LTR.
   Genetic similarity of this isolate with the prototype strain Roccaverano
   was not more than 84\%, supporting the designation of two subtypes
   within genotype E. Nevertheless, in vitro properties of the Sardinian
   strain were different from those of the Roccaverano strain in terms of
   ability to infect synovial membrane and produce syncitia. Remarkable
   differences in the HV1 and HV2 of the env gene were recorded, with the
   Sardinian isolate displaying sequence motif more similar to arthritic
   strains. Data presented suggest diffusion of genotype E is wider than
   previously thought. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Myxoma virus is a poxvirus responsible for myxomatosis in European
   Rabbits (oryctolagus cuniculus). The entire genome of the myxoma virus
   has been sequenced, allowing a systemic survey of the functions of a
   large number of putative pathogenic factors that this virus expresses to
   subvert the immune and inflammatory pathways of infected rabbit hosts.
   In Italy, industrial rabbits are mostly vaccinated against myxomatosis
   using the attenuated myxoma virus strains Borghi or SG33. We have
   identified genetic markers specific for Borghi or SG33 vaccine strains
   and established a PCR-based assay that could be used to (a) rapidly
   diagnose the presence of myxoma virus in Infected organs, (b)
   discriminate between field strain-infected and vaccinated rabbits and
   (c) differentiate between Borghi or SG33 vaccine strain. (C) 2010

Abstract = {A multi-residue method for the determination of organochlorine
   pesticides in fish feed samples was developed and optimized. The method
   is based on a cleanup step of the extracted fat, carried out by
   liquid-liquid extraction on diatomaceous earth cartridge with
   n-hexane/acetonitrile (80/20, v/v) followed by solid phase extraction
   (SPE) with silica gel-SCX cartridge, before the identification and
   quantification of the residues by gas chromatography-triple quadrupole
   tandem spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). Performance characteristics, such as
   accuracy, precision, linear range, limits of detection (LOD) and
   quantification (LOQ), for each pesticide were determined. Instrumental
   LODs ranged from 0.01 to 0.11 mu g L-1, LOQs were in the range of
   0.02-0.35 mu g L-1, and calibration curves were linear (r(2) > 0.999) in
   the whole range of explored concentrations (5-100 mu g L-1).
   Repeatability values were in the range of 3-15\%, evaluated from the
   relative standard deviation of six samples spiked at 100 mu g kg(-1) of
   fat, and in compliance with that derived by the Horwitz's equation. No
   matrix effects or interfering substances were observed in fish feed
   analyses. The proposed method allowed high recoveries (92-116\%) of
   spiked extracted fat samples at 100 mu g kg(-1), and very low LODs
   (between 0.02 and 0.63 mu g kg(-1)) and LOQs (between 0.05 and 2.09 mu g
   kg(-1)) determined in fish feed samples. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Babesia EU1, a potentially important emerging zoonotic pathogen, already
   detected in ticks and wild ruminants of different European Countries,
   was found in three pools of Ixodes ricinus nymphs in three different

   ticks (60 pools) were collected from the environment during a
   surveillance activity in the year 2006. Babesia EU1 estimated individual
   tick prevalence in the area is 0.85\%. The finding that also in northern
   Italy the tick population is carrying Babesia EU1 suggests a wide
   geographical spreading of this zoonotic pathogen in Europe. (C) 2010

Abstract = {In late 2008, bluetongue virus (BTV) serotype 6 (BTV-6), which had never
   occurred in Europe before, was first detected in the Netherlands and
   Germany. While the origin of the virus remains unknown, the prevalence
   of infections in cattle was investigated in a virological (N=28,658) and
   serological (N=2075) field survey in Lower Saxony, where 45 cases
   confined to the district Grafschaft Bentheim were found. Blood from
   affected animals was used for the experimental infection of three cattle
   with different BTV antibody status, leading to sustained viraemia in one
   animal naive for BTV. Of two animals that had detectable antibodies
   against BTV serotype 8, one became transiently infected and
   seroconverted for BTV-6 while the other did not react. In conclusion,
   while only a very limited spread of BTV-6 could be observed in the
   field, experimental infection of cattle did not show substantial
   differences of the course of infection in comparison to other BTV
   serotypes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {An accurate and reliable analytical method, based on ion chromatography
   and suppressed conductivity detection, has been developed and validated
   for the quantitative determination of sulfites in fresh meats and
   shrimps. The chromatographic separation was accomplished by using an
   anion-exchange column eluted with sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide.
   The optimized step-change elution, followed by column re-equilibration
   at the initial mobile phase composition, guaranteed a good resolution
   even toward endogenous interfering peaks, and an excellent retention
   time repeatability (1.1\%, n = 6). Good results in terms of sample
   extract stability, recovery efficiency were achieved with an extraction
   solvent mixture based on sodium hydroxide, fructose and EDTA. The method
   validation, performed by an in-house model according to Decision
   657/2002/EC and Regulation 882/2004/EC, provided excellent results with
   respect to linearity (correlation coefficient up to 0.9998), limits of
   detection and quantification (2.7 and 8.2 mg kg(-1), respectively,
   expressed as SO2). expanded measurement uncertainty (below 10\%),
   recovery values (ranging from 85\% to 92\%) and repeatability (down to
   8\%), demonstrating the conformity of the proposed method with the
   European directives. Finally, by major changes ruggedness studies, the
   method applicability to the quantitative analysis of cow hamburger, pork
   and horse sausage, and shrimps was demonstrated. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative and infectious disorders for
   which effective pharmacological tools are not yet available. This unmet
   challenge and the recently proposed interplay between prion diseases and
   Alzheimer's have led to a more urgent demand for new antiprion agents.
   Herein, we report the identification of a novel bifunctional
   diketopiperazine (DKP) derivative 1 d, which exhibits activity in the
   low micromolar range against prion replication in ScGT1 cells, while
   showing low cytotoxicity. Supported by properly addressed molecular
   modeling studies, we hypothesized that a planar conformation is the
   major determinant for activity in this class of compounds. Moreover,
   studies aimed at assessing the mechanism-of-action at the molecular
   level showed that 1 d might interact directly with recombinant prion
   protein (recPrP) to prevent its conversion to the pathogenic misfolded
   prion protein (PrPSc)-like form. This investigation suggests that DKP
   based antiprion compounds can serve as a promising lead scaffold in
   developing new drugs to combat prion diseases.},

Abstract = {Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses show different disease
   dynamics between virus strains and host species, and therefore epidemic
   field data are very valuable. This study used field data of the HPAI
   H7N1 epidemic which affected Northern Italy in 1999-2000. Field
   mortality data was back-calculated into a S-I-format to estimate the
   transmission rate parameter beta, indicating the number of birds
   infected per infectious bird per time unit. The bird-infectious period
   was assumed to be 2 days, and all birds were assumed to die after this
   infectious period. The estimated beta for HPAI H7N1 virus transmission
   in turkeys was 1.43 (95\% CI: 1.17-1.74). Farm risk factors such as
   flock size and age of the turkeys did not influence the estimated
   transmission rate parameter. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {With the support of European Community funds, three submerged artificial
   reefs composed of concrete cubes, bell-shaped modules and natural rocks
   were deployed along the Adriatic coast of the Abruzzi Region to increase
   the fish population and to prevent illegal trawling. The Provincial
   governments of Teramo and Pescara requested the Istituto Zooprofilattico
   Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise `G. Caporale' to monitor
   nectobenthic populations. Three sampling operations were conducted each
   year for each artificial reef. The authors present the results of a
   study conducted between 2005 and 2007, comparing the catches from the
   artificial reefs with those from the control sites using several
   diversity indexes. Artificial reef areas revealed greater species
   diversity and richness than the control sites. This study demonstrates
   the value of artificial reefs in response to the problem of low income,
   non-commercial fisheries as well as to the issue of over-exploitation of
   halieutic resources. In addition, the authors suggest that artificial
   reefs may be capable of activating habitat diversification processes
   that will increase biodiversity.},

Abstract = {Ranaviruses are considered a serious threat to lower vertebrates,
   including fish, amphibians and reptiles. However, epidemiological data
   on these agents are lacking, and further investigations are needed to
   understand the role of carriers and to update the list of susceptible
   hosts. We carried out various experimental infections under controlled
   conditions to contribute to the current knowledge on the susceptibility
   of black bullhead Ameiurus melas to European catfish virus (ECV) and
   other ranaviruses. A panel of 7 ranavirus isolates was used to challenge
   duplicate groups of A. melas juveniles maintained in aquaria supplied
   with running dechlorinated tap water. The experiments were performed at
   15 and 25 degrees C. The results confirmed the high susceptibility of A.
   melas to ECV infection. Furthermore, a significant mortality associated
   with the typical signs of systemic viral infections was observed in
   groups challenged with Epizootic haematopoietic necrosis virus (EHNV) at
   25 degrees C, and to a lesser extent, at 15 degrees C. No significant
   mortality was recorded in fish challenged with European sheatfish virus
   (ESV), Frog virus 3 (FV3), Rana esculenta virus-like (REV-like), Bohle
   iridovirus (BIV) or short-finned eel virus (SERV).},

Title = {Evaluation of the risk of neighbourhood infection of H7N1 Highly
   Pathogenic Avian Influenza in Italy using Q statistic},
Journal = {PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {95},

Abstract = {Exposure to the risk of neighbourhood infection was estimated for the
   H7N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) epidemic that affected
   Northern Italy between 1999 and 2000. The two most affected regions
   (Lombardy and Veneto) were analyzed and the epidemic was divided into
   three phases. Q statistics were used to evaluate exposure to the risk of
   neighbourhood infection using two measures. First, a local Q statistic
   (Q(ikt)) assessed daily exposure for each farm as a function of the
   number of neighbouring infected farms that were in their infectious
   period, weighted by the distance between farms. This allowed us to
   identify the daily time course of risk for each farm and, at any given
   time, local groups of farms defined by high risk. Second, for each farm
   a summary statistic of exposure risk within each phase (Q(i)(ph)) was
   obtained by summing Q(ikt) over the duration of each phase. This allowed
   identification of farms defined by persistent, high exposure risk within
   each phase of the epidemic. Statistical significance was evaluated using
   conditional Monte Carlo simulation, and significant values of Q(i)(ph)
   were mapped to assess the variation of the risk of neighbourhood
   infection through the phases. Q(ikt) was larger for farms in Lombardy
   and the reduction of exposed farms was more marked for Veneto. Although
   the highest value of Q(i)(ph) was observed in Veneto, in each phase most
   of the significant values were in Lombardy. In the last phase of the
   epidemic, a large reduction in the number of farms significantly exposed
   to the risk of neighbourhood infection was observed in the Veneto
   region, along with generally low values of Q(i)(ph). This may be
   explained by differences in control measures in the two regions,
   including pre-emptive slaughtering of farms considered at high risk of
   infection. The Q statistic allowed us to quantify geographic,
   time-dynamic variations in exposure to neighbourhood infection, and to
   generate hypotheses on the efficacy of control measures. (C) 2010

   purchased from large retailers (53\%), followed by small retailers
   (25.2\%), direct purchase from producers (16\%), and local or itinerant
   markets (5.8\%). It was found that 69.9\% of households buy packaged
   eggs; 92\% of households store them in the refrigerator, although this
   percentage varies considerably, according to the type of presentation
   (packaged or loose) and the number of eggs bought. Italian households
   mainly eat eggs cooked (48.9\%), followed by partly cooked (35.0\%) and

Title = {Brain renin-angiotensin system modifies the blood pressure response to

Abstract = {In order to elucidate the involvement of the brain renin-angiotensin
   system (RAS) in cadmium intracerebroventricular (ICV) hypertension, we
   evaluated the effects of a pretreatment with different drugs: clonidine,
   an a(2) adrenergic agonist, enalapril and captopril, both ACE
   inhibitors, and saralasin, a competitive nonselective AT(1) and AT(2)
   receptor antagonist. We used a rat strain with low levels of kallikrein
   (LKR) that was more sensitive to ICV cadmium hypertension, compared with
   normal kallikrein rats (NKRs), the control strain. The interplay between
   the kallikrein-kinin system and the RAS in the LKR strain caused various
   hemodynannic alterations, which we believe were the result of elevated
   RAS activity in these animals. Moreover, we suggest that the defective
   kallikrein-kinin system in LKR may also cause an alteration in the
   activation of brain RAS in these animals. The LKR displayed elevated
   concentrations of plasma All, hypertrophy of the myocardium, and initial
   alterations in the renal glomerulotubular system. With the exception of
   clonidine, all of the other drugs showed greater antihypertensive
   effects of differing statistical significance in LKR, compared with NKR.
   Both ACE inhibitors were able to significantly reduce pressor response
   to cadmium ICV in LKR throughout the experiment, whereas in NKR, they
   were only able to reduce the hypertensive peak of cadmium. A significant
   protective effect was also observed in LKR pretreated with saralasin,
   while no effect was observed in NKR. These findings confirm the presence
   of brain RAS activation in LKR and its contribution to the central
   control of pressor response to cadmium ICV.},

Title = {Can Preening Contribute to Influenza A Virus Infection in Wild
   Waterbirds?},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 25},
Abstract = {Wild aquatic birds in the Orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes are
   the main reservoir hosts perpetuating the genetic pool of all influenza
   A viruses, including pandemic viruses. High viral loads in feces of
   infected birds permit a fecal-oral route of transmission. Numerous
   studies have reported the isolation of avian influenza viruses (AIVs)
   from surface water at aquatic bird habitats. These isolations indicate
   aquatic environments have an important role in the transmission of AIV
   among wild aquatic birds. However, the progressive dilution of
   infectious feces in water could decrease the likelihood of virus/host
   interactions. To evaluate whether alternate mechanisms facilitate AIV
   transmission in aquatic bird populations, we investigated whether the
   preen oil gland secretions by which all aquatic birds make their
   feathers waterproof could support a natural mechanism that concentrates
   AIVs from water onto birds' bodies, thus, representing a possible source
   of infection by preening activity. We consistently detected both viral
   RNA and infectious AIVs on swabs of preened feathers of 345 wild
   mallards by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
   (RT-PCR) and virus-isolation (VI) assays. Additionally, in two
   laboratory experiments using a quantitative real-time (qR) RT-PCR assay,
   we demonstrated that feather samples (n=5) and cotton swabs (n = 24)
   experimentally impregnated with preen oil, when soaked in
   AIV-contaminated waters, attracted and concentrated AIVs on their
   surfaces. The data presented herein provide information that expands our
   understanding of AIV ecology in the wild bird reservoir system.},

Abstract = {Ticks, collected in central and northern Italy from pets, livestock,
   wild animals and the environment (n = 2107), were identified by
   microscopy and processed by molecular diagnostics to determine the
   species that act as a reservoir for piroplasms. A total of 11 ixodid
   tick species were identified, with five of them proving to be piroplasm
   positive. Molecular diagnostics identified Theileria equi and eight
   Babesia species in 52 adult specimens, mostly (n = 50) removed from
   piroplasm-free vertebrate hosts. Ixodes ricinus hosted the highest
   number of species, although the highest infection rate was recorded in
   Hyalomma marginatum (9.1\%), followed by I. ricinus (5.1\%), Dermacentor
   marginatus (5\%), Rhipicephalus turanicus (3.1\%) and R. sanguineus
   (1.2\%). Novel tick/pathogen associations were detected, suggesting that
   certain tick species (such as Hy. marginatum, R. sanguineus and I.
   ricinus) are vector of more piroplasm species than previously thought.
   Trans-stadial maintenance of the piroplasms was observed in each
   positive tick species; vertical transmission of B. canis canis was
   demonstrated in R. sanguineus. Finally, the detection of Babesia sp., B.
   microti-like species and B. rodhaini, phylogenetically related to
   zoonotic species, suggests that the human population could be at risk of
   infection in the studied area. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Only limited information is available on the epidemiology and
   pathogenesis of Bovine Herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) in domestic buffalos. In
   this study, a virulent BoHV-1 field strain isolated from cattle was
   inoculated into buffaloes to evaluate their susceptibility to the virus
   and to investigate the establishment of viral latency through clinical,
   virological and serological investigations. Latency was also studied by
   attempting viral reactivation using pharmacological induction. Six of
   seven male, 5 months old buffaloes were intranasally inoculated with
   BoHV-1; the other animal was kept as negative control. The animals were
   clinically monitored during the post-infection (P.I.) and the
   post-pharmacological induction (P.P.) periods. During these periods,
   nasal and rectal swabs, and blood samples, with and without
   anticoagulant, were collected at 2-3 day intervals. On culling the
   animals, 206 days P.I., their trigeminal ganglia and tonsils were
   collected. No clinical signs referable to BoHV-1 were observed
   throughout the experimental period. However, seropositivity was detected
   in all infected animals within day 20 P.I., using BoHV-1 glycoprotein E
   and glycoprotein B competitive ELISAs (IDEXX) and virus neutralisation
   test. In real-time PCR (RT-PCR), five of these animals were positive, at
   least once, for nasal or rectal swabs, during the P.I. period. The sixth
   infected animal was found positive only in the trigeminal ganglia after
   culling. Ganglia were also positive for two other animals. Virus
   isolation in permissive cell-lines was successful for a part of the
   RT-PCR positive samples. The detected viruses were confirmed by genetic
   analysis as identical to the inoculated strain. No evidence of infection
   was observed in the negative control. This study represents the first
   experimental transmission of BoHV-1 in buffaloes, confirming their
   susceptibility to infection and their possible role as host/reservoirs
   of BoHV-1. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Genetic Loci Involved in Antibody Response to Mycobacterium avium ssp.
   paratuberculosis in Cattle},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Background: Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) causes
   chronic enteritis in a wide range of animal species. In cattle, MAP
   causes a chronic disease called Johne's disease, or paratuberculosis,
   that is not treatable and the efficacy of vaccine control is
   controversial. The clinical phase of the disease is characterised by
   diarrhoea, weight loss, drop in milk production and eventually death.
   Susceptibility to MAP infection is heritable with heritability estimates
   ranging from 0.06 to 0.10. There have been several studies over the last
   few years that have identified genetic loci putatively associated with
   MAP susceptibility, however, with the availability of genome-wide high
   density SNP maker panels it is now possible to carry out association
   studies that have higher precision.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: The objective of the current study was
   to localize genes having an impact on Johne's disease susceptibility
   using the latest bovine genome information and a high density SNP panel
   (Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip) to perform a case/control, genome-wide
   association analysis. Samples from MAP case and negative controls were
   selected from field samples collected in 2007 and 2008 in the province
   of Lombardy, Italy. Cases were defined as animals serologically positive
   for MAP by ELISA. In total 966 samples were genotyped: 483 MAP ELISA
   positive and 483 ELISA negative. Samples were selected randomly among
   those collected from 119 farms which had at least one positive animal.
   Conclusion/Significance: The analysis of the genotype data identified
   several chromosomal regions associated with disease status: a region on
   chromosome 12 with high significance (P<5x10(-6)), while regions on
   chromosome 9, 11, and 12 had moderate significance (P<5x10(-5)). These
   results provide evidence for genetic loci involved in the humoral
   response to MAP. Knowledge of genetic variations related to
   susceptibility will facilitate the incorporation of this information
   into breeding programmes for the improvement of health status.},

Abstract = {It has been difficult to replicate consistently the experimental model
   of axonal Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). We immunized rabbits with two
   lipo-oligosaccharides (LOS1 and LOS2) derived from the same C jejuni
   strain and purified in a slightly different way. LOS1 did not contain
   proteins whereas several proteins were present in LOS2. In spite of a
   robust anti-GM1 antibody response in all animals the neuropathy
   developed only in rabbits immunized with LOS1. To explain this
   discrepancy we investigated fine specificity, affinity and ability to
   activate the complement of anti-GM1 antibodies. Only rabbits immunized
   with LOS1 showed monospecific high-affinity antibodies which activated
   more effectively the complement.
   Although it is not well understood how monospecific high-affinity
   antibodies are induced these are crucial for the induction of
   experimental axonal neuropathy. Only a strict adherence to the protocols
   demonstrated to be successful may guarantee the reproducibility and
   increase the confidence in the animal model as a reliable tool for the
   study of the human axonal GBS. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Listeria rnonocytogenes can cause severe invasive disease in humans and
   has been isolated from a variety of foods. This study aimed to
   investigate type diversity and distribution across sources by subtyping
   via PFGE a set of 300 L. monocytogenes isolates collected in Italy from
   foods over a five year period (from 2003 to 2007). The most frequent
   serotypes were 1/2a (45\%), 1/2c (22\%), and 4b/4e (16\%); 5\% of the
   isolates were untypeable by conventional serotyping. Significant
   associations were observed between serotype 1/2a with dairy (O.R. =
   13.9) and 1/2c with meat (O.R. = 33.3). All isolates were typeable,
   generating 164 combined PFGE profiles. Of these, 121 were unique, being
   displayed by only one isolate. The other 43 profiles grouped the
   remaining isolates and were shared between two (N=22), three (N=10),
   four (N=3) and five isolates (N=4). The remaining 4 profiles were shared
   between 7, 14, 17 and 46 isolates, respectively. Some profiles (N=7)
   were retrieved in samples collected in different years, indicating
   persistency in foods and processing plants. This research may pose the
   ground for designing a broad typing database which could ease the
   understanding of L monocytogenes diversity and could be used for
   facilitating epidemiological investigations for the identification of
   listeriosis outbreaks. Data show how large subtype databases may
   facilitate the identification of common and source-specific types. More
   comprehensive databases may be needed to fully understand L.
   monocytogenes diversity and to provide useful data to be considered in
   epidemiological investigations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {P>This study provides data on the prevalence of potentially pathogenic
   Bacillus cereus in foods from catering kitchens by evaluating the
   occurrence of B. cereus and the presence of virulence-associated genes.
   B. cereus was detected in 72/250 (28.8\%) food samples. Specifically, B.
   cereus was highlighted in 34/74 (45.9\%) pastries, 16/40 (40\%) rice
   samples, 4/38 (10.5\%) potato meals, 6/54 (11.1\%) mozzarella samples
   and 12/44 (27.3\%) meat meals. PCRs aimed at the hbl (C, D, A, B), nhe
   (A, B, C), bceT and cytK genes demonstrated a widespread distribution of
   the toxin-encoding genes among B. cereus isolates. The results highlight
   the frequent failure of control measures in catering kitchens and the
   need for intensive and continuous monitoring in order to assess the
   human health risk, as proposed by Regulation (EC) no. 1441/2007 on

Abstract = {The aim of the present study is the evaluation of the performance of the
   histological method for the detection of microscopic lesions in sexual
   accessory glands of veal calves treated with 17 beta-estradiol for
   growth promoting purposes; our goal is to verify the possibility of its
   appliance as an official screening technique according to Decision
   2002/657/CE. Microscopic examination of target organs of veal calves
   treated with low-dose 17 beta-estradiol and of control animals was
   carried out in blind by two pathologists. Prostate and bulbo-urethral
   glands from the treated animals distinctly differed from the controls:
   significant differences in the lesion score were highlighted in both
   organs with regard to some specific parameters between the two groups.
   This study shows that histopathology could identify illicit treatment by
   17 beta-estradiol 15 days after the last drug administration, when the
   official test gave negative results. The preliminary evidence of the
   high specificity and sensitivity values of this analysis (up to Se =
   96,3\%, CI95\%, 81,03\%-99,91\%; Sp 86,4\%, CI95\%, 65,1\%-97,1\%)
   suggests to complete its validation according to Decision 2002/657/EC.
   When these performance will be confirmed histopathology could be adopted
   as an official screening method in the National residue monitoring plan
   for the detection of oestrogenic illicit treatments.},

Abstract = {Eggshell abnormalities were seen in the apex of eggs in two of three
   flocks of multi-age, Hy-Line layer chickens housed on a farm in Northern
   Italy. Approximately 1.3\% to 1.8\% of eggs in one flock were affected,
   amounting to 300-400 eggs per day; the abnormalities resulted in a great
   deal of breakage and spoilage of healthy eggs. The mean weight of eggs
   was also reduced. Egg abnormalities in a second flock were less severe.
   Mycoplasma synoviae was detected in birds from both of the affected
   flocks by serologic, cultural, and molecular techniques, but not in a
   third, adjacent flock where no eggshell abnormalities were seen.
   Treatment with tylosin, administered in the drinking water for 5 days,
   resulted in an immediate improvement of eggshell quality and egg weight.
   There was no evidence of infectious bronchitis virus in the flocks.},

Abstract = {Food irradiation is a preservation method that has been approved by the
   European Union for a limited number of foods or food products and within
   a limited range of doses. European Community legislation states that all
   foods or food ingredients treated in this manner and authorized for sale
   in the European Union must be clearly labeled, and that market-level
   inspections must be carried out to ensure compliance with this
   regulation. To improve detection of irradiated foods, we evaluated the
   efficacy of electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy for the
   identification of seafood that had been subjected to irradiation. Three
   fish species were tested: gilthead sea bream, cod, and swordfish. For
   each species, 18 samples of flesh-containing bone were analyzed after
   either irradiation at 0.5, 1, or 3 kGy or no irradiation (control).
   Induced radicals in irradiated samples produced distinct ESR signals
   that allowed differentiation from non-irradiated samples. Within the
   dose range tested, a linear dose-response relationship was observed
   (R(2)>0.94). The gilthead sea bream displayed the highest
   radiosensitivity. The analytical procedure was validated and
   successfully used for the routine monitoring of locally marketed
   seafood. The main aims of the study were to develop a reliable tool for
   the enforcement of the proper labeling of irradiated foods and to obtain
   preliminary data on compliance with current laws in the Italian market.},

Title = {Pathogenesis and Subsequent Cross-Protection of Influenza Virus
   Infection in Pigs Sustained by an H1N2 Strain},
Journal = {ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {57},
Number = {4},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {P>The H1N1, H3N2 and, more recently, H1N2 subtypes of influenza A virus
   are presently co-circulating in swine herds in several countries. The
   objectives of this study were to investigate the pathogenesis of
   Sw/Italy/1521/98 (H1N2) influenza virus, isolated from respiratory
   tissues of pigs from herds in Northern Italy, and to evaluate its
   potential cross-protection against the Sw/Fin/2899/82 (H1N1) strain. In
   the pathogenesis test, eight pigs were intranasally infected with H1N2
   virus; at pre-determined intervals, these animals were killed and
   necropsied, along with eight uninfected animals. In the cross-protection
   test, sixteen pigs were infected by intranasal (i.n.) and intratracheal
   (i.t.) routes with either H1N2 or H1N1 virus. Twenty days later, all
   pigs were challenged (by the same route), with either the homologous
   H1N2 or heterologous H1N1 virus strains. Control group was inoculated
   with culture medium alone. On post-challenge days (PCD) 1 and 3, two
   pigs from each infected group, along with one control pig, were killed.
   Clinical, virological, serological and histopathological investigations
   were performed in both the pathogenicity and cross-protection tests. In
   the pathogenicity test, mild clinical signs were observed in two pigs
   during 3 and 4 days, respectively. Virus was isolated from two pigs over
   6 days and from lung samples of pigs killed on post-infection days 2 and
   4. Seroconversion was detected in the two infected animals killed 15
   days after infection. In the cross-protection study, mild clinical
   respiratory signs were detected in all pigs infected with either the
   H1N2 or H1N1 virus. The virus was isolated from nasal swabs of almost
   all pigs till 6 days. After the challenge infection, the pigs remained
   clinically healthy and virus isolation from the nasal secretions or lung
   samples was sporadic. Antibody titres in H1N1 or H1N2 infected groups
   were similar, whereas the H1N2 sub-type induced less protection against
   re-infection by homologous and heterologous virus than H1N1 sub-type.
   The controls had no signs of the disease. In the H1N2 infected pigs, a
   reduced number of goblet cells in nasal and tracheal mucosa and small
   foci of lymphomononuclear cell infiltrates in the submucosa were
   detected. Furthermore, the goblet cell reduction was related to the time
   of infection. Diffuse mild interstitial pneumonia was also recorded in
   pigs infected with the H1N2 virus and challenged with either H1N1or H1N2
   pigs. These studies showed the moderate virulence of the H1N2 virus and
   a partial cross-protection against heterologous infection.},

   determinants and point mutations in DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV were
   characterized by PCR and DNA sequencing. Of the 49 E. coli isolates, 34
   were resistant to nalidixic acid, 4 to ciprofloxacin and 11 to nalidixic
   acid, ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin. Chromosomal point mutations were
   found in gyrA gene (Ser83Leu and Asp87Asn) and gyrB (Gln434His,
   Lys444Arg and Gly435Val). We also report the simultaneous presence of
   qnrS1 quinolone resistance determinant, dfrA1-aadA22 gene cassettes and

Title = {The feasibility of developing a risk assessment for the impact of
   climate change on the emergence of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever in
   livestock in Europe: a Review},

Abstract = {P>Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is one of the most
   widespread of all medically important arboviruses with ticks of the
   Hyalomma spp. serving as the main vectors. Infection of livestock by
   CCHFV serves as a route of exposure to humans, as a reservoir of disease
   and as a route of importation. This study discusses the pathways and
   data requirements for a qualitative risk assessment for the emergence of
   CCHFV in livestock in Europe. A risk map approach is proposed based on
   layers that include the potential routes of release (e.g. by migrating
   birds carrying infected ticks) together with the main components for
   exposure, namely the distributions of the tick vectors, the small
   vertebrate host reservoirs and the livestock. A layer on landscape
   fragmentation serves as a surrogate for proximity of livestock to the
   tick cycle. Although the impact of climate change on the emergence of
   CCHF is not clear, comparing the distribution of risk factors in each
   layer currently with those predicted in the 2080s with climate change
   can be used to speculate how potential high-risk areas may shift.
   According to the risk pathway, transstadial and/or transovarial
   transmission in the tick vector are crucial for CCHFV spread. Vector
   competence and tick vector switching, however, remain critical factors
   for CCHFV colonization of new regions in Europe. The species of
   migratory bird is also an important consideration in the release
   assessment with greater abundance and biodiversity of ground-dwelling
   birds in southern Europe than in northern Europe.},

Abstract = {Honey, produced by Apis mellifera from nectar or honeydew, contains a
   discrete quantity of water (about 17\%). The variability of water
   content influences the quality, the stability, the workability and the
   storage of honey. Moisture in honey is usually measured via
   determination of refractive index (111): from the value measured, the
   percentage is calculated by an empirical formula or by ``conversion{''}
   table. A possible alternative approach is the Karl Fischer Titration
   (KFT). The objective of this work was to find the optimal parameters for
   water determination in honey with KFT without any heat treatment of
   sample or working medium and the measurement of water content in more

Abstract = {Tilmicosin (TIM, Pulmotil (R)) was administered to eight rabbits by oral
   gavage at a dose of 12.5 mg/kg body weight for 2, 5, and 7 days, and its
   plasma kinetics and intrapulmonary disposition were investigated. TIM
   concentrations in plasma samples collected after days 1 and 6 of
   treatment were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with
   ultraviolet detection. The pharmacokinetic parameters, obtained by
   non-compartmental analysis of TIM plasma concentrations, did not show
   any significant variations between days 1 and 6. From the second day of
   treatment, TIM concentrations attained in lung tissue and pulmonary
   alveolar macrophages (PAM) exceeded those in plasma by 7- and 400-fold,
   respectively, and high levels were maintained in lung tissues during the
   entire treatment duration. After the first day of withdrawal, a fast
   decline in TIM levels in both plasma and lung tissue was observed, but
   in PAM, much higher concentrations were maintained after 3 days of TIM
   withdrawal.},

Abstract = {A case of neurofibroma is reported in a wild striped mullet Mugil
   cephalus. Macro- and microscopic features are described. The tumor arose
   on the head as a white-grayish, firm mass protruding outwards but
   covered by the epidermis. The neoplastic tissue showed well-defined
   borders and was encapsulated; it was predominantly composed of elongated
   cells with ellipsoid, hyperchromatic nuclei and pale cytoplasm. The
   cells were irregularly arranged; in the context of the neoplastic
   proliferation, these cells were usually densely packed, sometimes
   forming parallel arrays, but without distinctive nuclear palisades. The
   diagnosis of neurofibroma is also supported by the positive
   immunostaining for S-100 and vimentin as well as by the negative
   calretinin reaction.},

Abstract = {In this study we investigated the HEV prevalence in Italian pigs
   displaying different pathological lesions, possible risk factors related
   to the infection, and the possible relations occurring between HEV and
   other concomitant pig pathogens. Genetic characterization of some of the
   identified strains was also performed. Detection of HEV RNA was
   accomplished using a nested reverse-transcription polymerase chain
   reaction on bile samples from 137 pigs of 2-4 months of age submitted
   for diagnostic purposes. Forty-one of the 137 examined pigs (29.9\%)
   tested positive for HEV RNA. Animals of 80-120 days of age showed a
   higher prevalence of HEV infection (46.9\% against 20\% of younger
   animals). No statistically significant correlations between HEV
   positivity and the presence of other pathological conditions detected at
   necropsy, or concomitant coinfections with PCV2 and/or PRRSV were
   detected. All identified strains belonged to genotype 3, and were
   similar to other HEV subtypes 3e, 3f, 3c circulating in Europe. (C) 2009

Title = {Co-existence of classical scrapie and Nor98 in a sheep from an Italian
   outbreak},
Journal = {RESEARCH IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {88},
Number = {3},
Pages = {478-485},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Nor98 is an atypical scrapie strain characterized by a molecular pattern
   and brain distribution of the pathological prion protein (PrPsc)
   different from classical scrapie. In Italy, 69 atypical cases have been
   identified so far and all were characterized as Nor98 strain. In this
   paper we report an unusual case in a sheep which showed
   immunohistochemical and molecular features of PrPsc different from the
   other atypical cases. The sheep was from an outbreak where the index and
   the other four cases were affected by classical scrapie.
   Histopathological, immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses on the
   brain of the unusual case revealed the simultaneous presence of
   pathological features characteristic of Nor98 and classical scrapie.
   Interestingly, the prevalent disease phenotype in the brainstem was
   classical scrapie-like, while in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum the
   Nor98 phenotype was dominant. The sub-mandibular lymph node was positive
   and showed a PrPsc molecular pattern referable to classical scrapie. The
   PrP genotype was AL(141)RQ/AF(141)RQ. Taken together, the occurrence of
   classical scrapie in the outbreak, the PrP genotype, the involvement of
   different cellular targets in the brain and the pathological and
   molecular PrPsc features observed suggest that this unusual case may
   result from the co-existence of Nor98 and classical scrapie. (C) 2009

Abstract = {The effect of two doses of different sources of zinc, inorganic (zinc
   oxide) or chelated (zinc glutamate chelate), on morphology and turn-over
   of the small intestine was assessed in early-weaned pigs orally
   challenged with enterotoxigenic E. coli K88 (ETEC). Sixty pigs weaned at
   21 days were assigned to one of the following 5 diets: control (C);
   C+Zinc oxide (ZnO), either a 200 or a 2,500 mg Zn/kg dose; or C+zinc
   chelate with glutamic acid (Glu-Zn), either a 200 or a 2,500 mg Zn/kg
   dose. On d 2, the pigs were orally inoculated with 1.5 ml of a 10(10)
   CFU/ml E. coli K88ac 0148 suspension. Zinc supplements did not improve
   the performance of the pigs, but on d 5 faecal excretion of ETEC was
   reduced, and this was mainly due to high zinc doses (p<0.05). The
   villous height in the duodenum was improved by the zinc supplements
   (p<0.01) whatever the source and the level, whereas no effect was seen
   in the other two tracts of small intestine. The diet did not affect
   apoptosis and mitosis counts, while ETEC-susceptible pigs had more
   mitotic cells in the villi than non-susceptible pigs, particularly in
   the jejunum (p<0.01). The duodenum had fewer mitotic cells in the villi
   (p<0.05) and in the crypts (p<0.01) and more apoptotic cells in the
   villi. High dietary doses of ZnO or Zn-Glutamate improve villous height
   of the duodenum, but not of the jejunum and the ileum, and do not affect
   the epithelial proliferative activity and apoptotic index of intestinal
   mucosa of early-weaned pigs orally challenged with ETEC.},

Abstract = {Babesia caballi and Theileria equi are the causative agents of equine
   piroplasmosis. In this preliminary epidemiological study, 412 horses
   reared in central and northern Italy were sampled and three diagnostic
   methods compared, namely, the microscopy, the indirect fluorescent
   antibody test (IFAT) and a PCR. Possible risk factors (such as area,
   season, breed, activity, sex, age, and grazing) associated with
   serological positivity were evaluated.
   A seroprevalence of 68.4\% was found: 12.4\% of the animals had anti-T.
   equi antibodies, 17.9\% anti-B. caballi antibodies and 38.1\% had
   antibodies against both species. Of the seropositive samples, 3.1\% and
   9.4\% were positive to microscopy and PCR, respectively; 31.5\% of the
   horses were IFAT-negative but 1.4\% and 2.4\% of the corresponding blood
   samples were positive to microscopy and PCR, respectively. Molecular
   techniques revealed that the species present were closely related to T.
   equi, Theileria sergenti, Theileria buffeli and the Babesia microti-like
   piroplasm provisionally named Theileria annae. Grazing was found to be a
   pronounced risk factor for equine piroplasmosis. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {In recent years the control of low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI)
   viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes has increasingly become a concern. We
   evaluated the measures (stamping out, controlled marketing, emergency
   and preventive vaccination, farm density reduction and restocking in
   homogenous areas) implemented to control the LPAI epidemics that
   occurred in Italy between 2000 and 2005, using a combination of spatial
   and space time analyses and estimates of the basic reproduction ratio
   (R-0). Clustering of infected farms decreased over the years, indicating
   the effectiveness of the control strategies implemented. Controlled
   marketing {[}relative risk (RR) 0.46, 95\% confidence interval (Cl)
   0.27-0.80], emergency (RR 0.47, 95\% CI 0.39-0.57) and preventive
   vaccination (RR 0.19, 95\% CI 0.09-0.41) were the most effective
   measures, yet R-0<1 was only for preventive vaccination. Our results are
   useful for identifying the most effective measures for reducing the risk

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the phenotypic and genotypic
   resistance profiles of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
   pseudintermedius (MRSP) and to examine the clonal distribution in Europe
   and North America.
   A total of 103 MRSP isolates from dogs isolated from several countries
   in Europe, the USA and Canada were characterized. Isolates were
   identified by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP),
   antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by broth dilution or
   gradient diffusion, and antimicrobial resistance genes were detected
   using a microarray. Genetic diversity was assessed by multilocus
   sequence typing (MLST), PFGE and spa typing. Staphylococcal cassette
   chromosome mec (SCCmec) elements were characterized by multiplex PCR.
   Thirteen different sequence types (STs), 18 PFGE types and 8 spa types
   were detected. The hybrid SCCmec element II-III described in a MRSP
   isolate was present in 75 (72.8\%) isolates. The remaining isolates
   either had SCCmec type III (n = 2), IV (n = 6), V (n = 14) or VII-241 (n
   = 4) or were non-typeable (n = 2). The most common genotypes were
   ST71(MLST)-J(PFGE)-t02(spa)-II-III(SCCmec) (56.3\%) and ST68-C-t06-V
   (12.6\%). In addition to mecA-mediated beta-lactam resistance, isolates
   showed resistance to trimethoprim {[}dfr(G)] (90.3\%),
   gentamicin/kanamycin {[}aac(6')-Ie-aph(2')-Ia] (88.3\%), kanamycin
   {[}aph(3')-III] (90.3\%), streptomycin {[}ant(6')-Ia] (90.3\%),
   streptothricin (sat4) (90.3\%), macrolides and/or lincosamides
   {[}erm(B), lnu(A)] (89.3\%), fluoroquinolones (87.4\%), tetracycline
   {[}tet(M) and/or tet(K)] (69.9\%), chloramphenicol (cat(pC221)) (57.3\%)
   and rifampicin (1.9\%).
   Two major clonal MRSP lineages have disseminated in Europe
   (ST71-J-t02-II-III) and North America (ST68-C-t06-V). Regardless of
   their geographical or clonal origin, the isolates displayed resistance
   to the major classes of antibiotics used in veterinary medicine and thus
   infections caused by MRSP isolates represent a serious therapeutic
   challenge.},

Volume = {34},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Clinical chemistry parameters were investigated in piglets weaned at 22
   and 28 days. The effects of an oral, low-dose interferon (IFN)-alpha
   treatment at weaning were evaluated as well. The trial was carried out
   on 59 piglets from the same farm, allocated to three groups: the first
   and the second groups were weaned at 28 and 22 days of age,
   respectively; the third group was weaned at 22 days and orally treated
   at weaning with IFN-alpha at a low dose (1 IU human lymphoblastoid
   IFN-alpha /kg body weight in drinking water) for 10 consecutive days.
   The results of the field trial confirmed that weaning is one of the main
   stressing events for pigs at intensive farms. In particular, these
   findings are based on a dramatic increase in serum haptoglobin levels
   after weaning in the three groups under study. Results also indicated
   that early weaning at 22 days implies higher environmental adaptation.
   In such animals, an oral, low-dose IFN-alpha treatment gave rise to a
   peculiar, negative, acute-phase response (reduced levels of serum
   albumin) and to significantly lower a-globulin concentrations in sera.
   Taken together, IFN-alpha was shown to modulate inflammatory responses
   to early weaning stress.},

Volume = {89},

Pages = {1115-1121},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {In 1999, Italy experienced a devastating epidemic of high-pathogenicity
   avian influenza (HPAI) caused by an H7N1 virus subtype. After this
   epidemic, a ministerial decree was passed to implement control measures
   for low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) due to H5 and H7 subtypes.
   We investigated whether these control measures have decreased the public
   expenditure associated with epidemics of LPAI and HPAI by comparing the
   direct and consequential losses of the 1999 epidemic to the losses
   associated with successive epidemics. The estimated total economic
   burden of the epidemics was about (sic)650 million ((sic)217 million in
   direct losses and (sic)433 million in consequential losses). The 1999
   epidemic accounted for most of these losses ((sic)507 million: (sic)112
   million in direct losses and (sic)395 million in consequential losses),
   whereas the total economic burden for the 5 successive LPAI was (sic)143
   million ((sic)105 million in direct losses and (sic)38 million in
   consequential losses). These results demonstrate that the implementation
   of a coordinated set of disease-control measures, which included both
   emergency and prophylactic vaccination, was able to reduce the overall
   costs associated with avian influenza epidemics. The results also show
   that the application of adequate LPAI control measures may limit the
   risk of emergence of an HPAI virus in an area with a high poultry
   density, allowing the complete disruption of the poultry market and its
   huge associated costs to be avoided.},

Title = {Complete genome sequences of avian paramyxovirus serotype 6 prototype
   strain Hong Kong and a recent novel strain from Italy: Evidence for the

Abstract = {Complete genome sequences were determined for two strains of avian
   paramyxovirus serotype 6 (APMV-6): the prototype Hong Kong (HK) strain
   and a more recent isolate from Italy (IT4524-2). The genome length of
   strain HK is 16236 nucleotide (nt), which is the same as for the other
   two APMV-6 strains (FE and 7W) that have been reported to date, whereas
   that of strain IT4524-2 is 16230 nt. The length difference in strain
   IT4524-2 is due to a 6-nt deletion in the downstream untranslated region
   of the F gene. All of these viruses follow the ``rule of six{''}. Each
   genome consists of seven genes in the order of 3'N-P-M-F-SH-HN-L5',
   which differs from other APMV serotypes in containing an additional gene
   encoding the small hydrophobic (SH) protein. Sequence comparisons
   revealed that strain IT4524-2 shares an unexpectedly low level of genome
   nt sequence identity (70\%) and aggregate predicted amino acid (aa)
   sequence identity (79\%) with other three strains, which in contrast are
   more closely related to each other with nt sequence 94-98\% nt identity
   and 90-100\% aggregate aa identity. Sequence analysis of the F-SH-HN
   genome region of two other recent Italian isolates showed that they fall
   in the HK/FE/TW group. The predicted signal peptide of IT4524-2 F
   protein lacks the N-terminal first 10 aa that are present in the other
   five strains. Also, the F protein cleavage site of strain IT4524-2, (R)
   under bar EP (R) under bar down arrow L, has two dibasic aa (arginine,
   R) compared to the monobasic F protein cleavage site of PEP (R) under
   bar down arrow L. in the other strains. Reciprocal
   cross-hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays using post-infection
   chicken sera indicated that strain IT4524-2 is antigenically related to
   the other APMV-6 strains, but with 4- to 8-fold lower HI tiers for the
   test sera between strain IT4524-2 and the other APMV-6 strains. Taken
   together, our results indicated that the APMV-6 strains represents a
   single serotype with two subgroups that differ substantially based on nt
   and aa sequences and can be distinguished by HI assay. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {A survey for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in
   finishing pig holdings was carried out in Italy in 2008. MRSA isolates
   were characterised by spa-. SCCmec- and antimicrobial susceptibility
   typing. A prevalence of 38\% (45/118, 95\% CI 29.4-46.9\%) positive
   holdings was observed. Eleven different spa-types were found among 102
   MRSA isolates, clustering in lineages associated with farm animals
   (ST398, ST9, ST(CC)97 in 36 holdings) and humans (ST1, 7 holdings). Nine
   (7.6\%) holdings were positive for two, three or four different and
   unrelated spa-types in various combinations. ST398 was the most
   prevalent lineage (33 positive holdings). The most prevalent spa-type
   was t899 (ST398), detected in 22 positive holdings. Three novel
   spa-types (t4794 of ST9: t4795 of ST97; t4838 of ST398) were detected.
   Ten holdings were positive for spa-type 11730, that proved to be a new
   single-locus variant of ST97, within the CC97 (ST1476). The most
   prevalent SCCmec was Type V (79 isolates), while Type IVb was found in
   10 isolates. None of the isolates was positive for Panton-Valentine
   Leukocidin, while most of the t127 and t1730 isolates, one t4794, one
   t4795, and one t2922 were positive for LukE-LukD genes. All 64
   antimicrobial susceptibility tested isolates were resistant to
   tetracyclines, with high resistance rates to trimethoprim (68.8\%),
   erythromycin (60.9\%), and ciprofloxacin (35.4\%). All t127, ST1
   isolates were resistant to tetracycline-ciprofloxacin-erythromycin. This
   survey provides the first report of MRSA ST1 and ST(CC)97 among pigs and
   the first report of MRSA ST9 from pigs in Europe. The presence of
   human-associated CA-MRSA (t127, ST1, SCCmec type V) in 6\% holdings
   surveyed can represent an additional MRSA reservoir for infections in
   humans. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Newcastle disease (ND) is an OIE listed disease caused by virulent avian
   paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1) strains, which affect many species of
   birds and may cause severe economic losses in the poultry sector. The
   disease has been officially and unofficially reported in many African
   countries and still remains the main poultry disease in commercial and
   rural chickens of Africa. Unfortunately, virological and epidemiological
   information concerning ND strains circulating in the Western and Central
   regions of Africa is extremely scarce. In the present study, sequence
   analysis, pathotyping and detailed genetic characterization of virulent
   ND strains detected in rural poultry in West and Central Africa revealed
   the circulation of a new genetic lineage, distinguishable from the
   lineages described in the Eastern and Southern parts of the continent.
   Several mismatches were observed in the segment of the matrix gene
   targeted by the primers and probe designed for the molecular detection
   of APMV-1, which were responsible for the false negative results in the
   diagnostic test conducted. Furthermore, deduced amino acid sequences of
   the two major antigens eliciting a protective immune response (F and HN
   glycoprotein) revealed protein similarities <90\% if compared to some
   common vaccine strains. Distinct mutations located in the neutralizing
   epitopes were revealed, indicating the need for detailed assessment of
   the efficacy of the current vaccines and vaccination practices in
   Africa. The present investigation provides important information on the
   epidemiology, diagnosis and control of NDV in Africa and highlights the
   importance of supporting surveillance in developing countries for
   transboundary animal diseases. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {In the framework of a bluetongue surveillance program including
   clinical, serological, and entomological activities, Culicoides biting
   midges were light trapped weekly in two regions of central Italy, Lazio
   and Tuscany. In the period January 2002 through December 2005, 3,944
   collections were carried out in 189 trap sites distributed in all the
   provinces of the two regions. Abundance data of C. obsoletus group were
   analyzed in relation to trap site altitude, distance from the sea, land
   use, and number of farmed animals. Species seasonality and overall
   temporal trend were also described. C. obsoletus was distributed over
   the whole study area, almost in all trapping sites and with high
   abundances. The species group was dominant among all captured
   Culicoides, with higher abundances recorded inland and in areas where
   land cover was partially or completely natural-wooded. Adults on the
   wing were caught all year round, with peaks in May-June and middle
   October. The observed trend through years recorded a peak during autumn
   2002, in concomitance with a local epidemic of bluetongue.},

Abstract = {Specific humoral immune responses in a clinical trial on cattle for
   vaccines against contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) were
   investigated. The trial included a subunit vaccine consisting of five
   recombinant putative variable surface proteins of the infectious agent
   Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides small colony type (M. mycoides SC)
   compared to the currently approved attenuated vaccine strain T1/44 and
   untreated controls. Humoral immune responses to 65 individual
   recombinant surface proteins of M. mycoides SC were monitored by a
   recently developed bead-based array assay. Responses to the subunit
   vaccine components were found to be weak. Animals vaccinated with this
   vaccine were not protected and had CBPP lesions similar to those of the
   untreated controls. In correlating protein-specific humoral responses to
   T1/44-induced immunity, five proteins associated with a protective
   immune response were identified by statistical evaluation, namely,
   MSC\_1046 (LppQ), MSC\_0271, MSC\_0136, MSC\_0079, and MSC\_0431. These
   five proteins may be important candidates in the development of a novel
   subunit vaccine against CBPP.},

   in the ewe's thoracic and abdominal cavities, ranging from encapsulated,
   mineralized foci to extensive, son., caseous tissue. Lesions in the
   lungs, liver, and lymph nodes were consistent with mycobacterial
   infection. A histopathological examination detected granulomatous
   lesions in all tissue samples. The presence of Mycobacterium
   tuberculosis complex genome was confirmed through a polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) analysis of tissues, using 1S6110 primers, followed by a
   nucleotide sequence analysis of PCR products. Acid-fast bacteria,
   characterized as Mycobacterium bovis, were isolated from lesions
   following 38 days of incubation.},

Abstract = {Verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) are foodborne pathogens
   that cause Outbreaks linked to Consumption of meat and raw milk. In this
   note the authors report results obtained from a survey conducted on
   minced beef and raw bovine milk samples using a Multiplex PCR (M-PCR)
   for the detection of eae, stx(1), stx(2) and hlyA genes as a screening
   step followed by a colony blot hybridization (CBH) technique for the
   isolation of the VTEC. Of 100 minced beef and 123 raw milk samples, 13
   (13\%) and 7 (5.7\%) were positive in the M-PCR and among these 9 and 3
   strains were isolated using CBH, respectively. All isolates showed the
   presence of the stx(2) gene, Single or in association with the other
   investigated genes. None of the isolates belonged to the 0 157, 026,
   091, 0103, 0111 and 0145 serogroups. The Study showed that the use of
   M-PCR for the screening of samples Coupled with a sensitive and specific
   detection technique. Could improve the possibility of detection of VTEC
   strains in foods. Moreover, the presence of VTEC in minced beef and in
   raw milk confirms their important role as Putative vehicles of infection
   to humans. Stringent control of these foodstuffs is essential for food
   safety purposes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {HPLC with fluorescence detection is considered for confirmatory analysis
   of group B veterinary drugs by the European Union legislation. A
   procedure for confirming the presence of anti-inflammatory non-steroidal
   drug (NSAID) residues in bovine milk by reversed phase high-performance
   liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection is herein described.
   The native fluorescence of nine drugs belonging to different NSAID
   sub-classes, namely flurbiprofen, carprofen, naproxen, vedaprofen,
   5-hydroxy-flunixin, niflumic acid, mefenamic acid, meclofenamic acid and
   tolfenamic acid, allowed for detection in bovine milk down to 0.25-20.0
   mu g/kg. Confirmation of the nine NSAIDs is attained by fluorescence
   detection at characteristic excitation and emission wavelengths. The
   procedure described is simple and selective. Limits of quantification
   (LOQs) ranging between 0.25 and 20 mu g/kg were measured; satisfactory
   trueness and within-laboratory reproducibility data were calculated at
   LOQ spiking levels, apart from 5-hydroxy-flunixin. The procedure
   developed is used in our laboratory for confirmation of each one of the
   above mentioned NSAIDs in bovine milk, to support results after HPLC
   quantitative analysis with UV-vis detection. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Following a large West Nile virus (WNV) epidemic in north-eastern Italy
   in 2008, human and animal surveillance activities were implemented in
   Emilia Romagna. Human surveillance was performed by serology or genome
   detection on blood and cerebrospinal fluid for all suspected cases
   suffering from acute meningoencephalitis in the regional territory.
   Animal surveillance consisted of passive and active surveillance of
   horses and active surveillance of wild birds and mosquitoes. Between 15
   June and 31 October 2009, nine of 78 possible cases of West Nile
   neuroinvasive disease were confirmed (three fatal). From May to October,
   26 cases of neurological West Nile disease were confirmed among 46
   horses. The overall incidence of seroconversion among horses in 2009 was
   13\%. In 2009, 44 of 1,218 wild birds yielded positive PCR results for
   WNV infection. The planned veterinary and entomological surveillance
   actions detected WNV activity from the end of July 2009, about 2-3 weeks
   before the onset of the first human neurological case. Passive
   surveillance of horses seems to be an early and suitable tool for the
   detection of WNV activity, but it will be less sensitive in the future,
   because an intensive programme of horse vaccination started in June
   2009.},

Abstract = {This survey was conducted to investigate the presence of Dirofilaria
   immitis and Dirofilaria repens in native dogs and cats living in an area
   of Italy where animal and human dirofilarioses have been sporadically
   reported in the past few years. From May 2008 to March 2009 individual
   blood samples were collected from 300 native cats and 300 native dogs in
   the Abruzzo region of central Italy. All 600 samples were subjected to a
   Knott modified method, to a test for the detection of circulating D.
   immitis antigen and to two species-specific PCR-coupled sequencing
   protocols. Epidemiological data were collected and then correlated with
   the filarial prevalence by univariate and multivariate statistical
   analyses. Twenty-five dogs (8.3\%) and six cats (2\%) were positive for
   filariae in at least one diagnostic test, with an overall prevalence
   rate for D. immitis and D. repens of 2.3\% and 5.6\% in dogs and 0.3\%
   and 1.6\% in cats, respectively. Male and large sized dogs resulted more
   likely to be infected by Dirofilaria spp., possibly due to the fact that
   animals living outdoor and of large size are more exposed to mosquito
   bites. However these factors were not confirmed as convincing risk
   factors by multivariate analysis. The results are discussed, together
   with the origin of these new autochthonous foci in central Italy and the
   present expansion southward of canine and feline filariae in Italy. (C)

Title = {Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) from bovine milk
   samples},
Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {67-70},

Abstract = {Aim - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the
   most important hospital and community-acquired pathogen. MRSA are also
   reported in farm animal and more recently reported as cause of bovine
   mastitis in Belgium and Germany. The aim of this study was to asses the
   presence of MRSA in some herds of the Po Valley and provide further
   characterization of the isolates.
   Results - Between October 2008 and February 2010, 2875 strains of S.
   aureus were isolated from different herds. A sample of 425 strains,
   representative of different farms of origin, were tested for
   methicillin-resistance by oxacillin agar diffusion test and mecA gene
   PCR. 55 MRSA strains were isolated from 20 different dairy farms.
   Fourteen MRSA randomly selected, were genotyped for the presence of the
   main recognized virulence factors and characterized by spa-typing, MLST
   and SCCmec typing. The characterization of the MRSA strains showed
   higher frequency of ST398, t899 spa-typing, the typical profile of
   livestock-associated MRSA (LA-MRSA). A strain was belonging to genotype
   t355, ST152, associated with human infections. Four MRSA were
   enterotoxigenic.
   Conclusions - MRSA are present in several cattle herds in the Po Valley
   and may represent a reservoir of infection for humans, in particular for
   those involved in animal husbandry, and a food-borne risk through the
   contamination of the food chain. Management of contagious MRSA mastitis
   should consider strict control measures and eradication among effective
   options.},

   of naive animals. Six weeks after infection, some animals from both the
   infected and contact groups presented fever and nasal discharge,
   followed by severe respiratory signs and polyarthritis. Organs were
   taken from animals that died during the trial or those that were
   sacrificed at the end of the trial. The results of microbiological

Abstract = {Bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) causes disease in cattle and it is related
   to human T lymphotrofic viruses HTLV-1 and HTLV-2. The objective of this
   study was to express and purify deleted and stable forms of the gp51
   envelope glycoprotein of BLV using a baculovirus system. Two forms of
   the gp51 were synthesised: one comprised the gp51 N-terminal 174 amino
   acids and a single 6xHis tag (a dagger(175-268)gp51-His) and the second
   form contained the same amino acid sequence and a C-terminal Strep-tag
   II in addition to the 6xHis tag (a dagger(175-268)gp51-STH). The two
   proteins were expressed and purified by immobilized metal-affinity
   chromatography (IMAC) or by Strep-Tactin column. The Strep-Tactin
   technology was more efficient than IMAC method and achieved a high pure
   recombinant deleted gp51. In addition the a dagger(175-268)gp51-STH
   protein was further concentrated by IMAC. This purified antigen could be
   used for the isolation of immunoreactive molecules and to develop a
   competitive ELISA test.},

Abstract = {An extraordinary plan of official control was carried out in 2008 in
   Campania (Italy) with the aim to monitor polychlorinated
   dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and dioxin-like
   polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs) levels in buffalo milk and to detect
   the contaminated farms, most of which are located in Caserta province.
   For these companies has been ordered seizure and execution of additional
   analyses has been requested in farms falling in the nearness, within a
   distance of 3 km, for a total of 304 farms examined. Moreover, all
   non-compliant farms were subjected to a periodic sampling in order to
   monitor trends in the levels of contamination.
   In this paper the distribution and the concentrations of 17 PCDD/Fs and
   12 dioxin-like PCBs in 460 samples of buffalo milk collected in the
   province of Caserta (Italy) are presented.
   The range of WHO-TEQ values for the PCDD/Fs in milk was 0.17 pg TEQ
   g(-1) fat and 87.0 pg TEQ g(-1) fat with a mean value 3.63 pg TEQ g(-1)
   fat and medium value 2.25 pg TEQ g(-1) fat.
   The concentrations of dioxin-like PCBs in the analysed samples ranged
   from 0.21 pg TEQ g(-1) fat to 15.9 pg TEQ g(-1) fat and the WHO-TEQ
   values of sum of PCDDs, PCDFs and dl-PCBs ranged from 0.45 pg TEQ g(-1)
   fat to 103.0 pg TEQ g(-1) fat.
   The geo-referencing analysis allowed to individuate a restricted area of
   the region object of the present study where is located the majority of
   the non-compliant farms.
   The study of the congeners distribution has finally suggested that the
   likely cause of contamination is to be attributed to the illegal burning
   of waste. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Highly pathogenic A/H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI H5N1) viruses have
   seriously affected the Nigerian poultry industry since early 2006.
   Previous studies have identified multiple introductions of the virus
   into Nigeria and several reassortment events between cocirculating
   lineages. To determine the spatial, evolutionary, and population
   dynamics of the multiple H5N1 lineages cocirculating in Nigeria, we
   conducted a phylogenetic analysis of whole-genome sequences from 106
   HPAI H5N1 viruses isolated between 2006 and 2008 and representing all 25
   Nigerian states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) reporting
   outbreaks. We identified a major new subclade in Nigeria that is
   phylogenetically distinguishable from all previously identified
   sublineages, as well as two novel reassortment events. A detailed
   analysis of viral phylogeography identified two major source populations
   for the HPAI H5N1 virus in Nigeria, one in a major commercial poultry
   area (southwest region) and one in northern Nigeria, where contact
   between wild birds and backyard poultry is frequent. These findings
   suggested that migratory birds from Eastern Europe or Russia may serve
   an important role in the introduction of HPAI H5N1 viruses into Nigeria,
   although virus spread through the movement of poultry and poultry
   products cannot be excluded. Our study provides new insight into the
   genesis and evolution of H5N1 influenza viruses in Nigeria and has
   important implications for targeting surveillance efforts to rapidly
   identify the spread of the virus into and within Nigeria.},

Abstract = {Flavomycin complex is an antibiotic banned in the European Union as an
   additive in feed stuffs. As a consequence, the monitoring programmes for
   official control within the Community require analysis of feeds for
   possible illegal use of flavomycin. A method for unambiguous
   identification and quantification of moenomycin A, the main
   pharmacologically active component of flamomycin complex, in several
   feeds by liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ion trap mass
   spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS) is herein described for the first time. The
   method was developed to be used as a confirmative analytical tool for
   the network of Italian official control laboratories; both the singly
   and doubly charged molecular ions were observed as precursor ions, from
   which four product ions were selected for both quantitative analysis and
   unambiguous identification of moenomycin A. The method was in-house
   validated for feeds in the concentration range 0.50-30.0 mu g/g,
   according to the Regulation 882/2004/EC requirements. Mean recoveries
   ranging between 83.9-94.2\% and relative standard deviations <23\%
   account for method trueness and repeatability, respectively. Moreover,
   other analytical performance parameters, i.e. method specificity,
   ruggedness, the linearity of detector response, the limit of
   quantification (LOQ), the limit of detection (LOD), and measurement
   uncertainty were evaluated and reported. The ion trap LC/ESI-MS/MS
   method is highly selective and reliable; high drug recovery, good
   reproducibility and an LOQ down to 0.10 mu g/g guarantee its
   applicability for confirmatory purposes in the official control activity
   in Italy. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {P>Bluetongue (BT) is an orbiviral disease of wild and domestic
   ruminants, mainly sheep. In Sicily, the first Bluetongue outbreak
   occurred in October 2000; there have been 76 recorded outbreaks so far.
   The National Surveillance Plan, based on European Union Commission
   Decision 138/2001/CE, establishes serological and entomological surveys.
   This plan consists of controls of seronegative cattle, called `sentry'
   as indicators for the presence and circulation of virus in defined
   areas. To check the seroconversions, the regional territory has been
   subdivided in 400 km2 areas including 58 seronegative cattle,
   periodically checked by serological tests. All positive sera have been
   tested to detect the specific serotype by the National Reference Centre
   for Exotic Diseases (CESME) at the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale
   Abruzzo e Molise in Teramo (IZS Teramo). Moreover, entomological
   surveillance has been implemented in seropositive herds, to investigate
   the presence of insect vectors belonging to Culicoides genus. The goal
   of the present communication is to report on the different species of
   Culicoides found in the farms with Bluetongue virus and to investigate
   on the probable role of new competent vectors. This paper concerns data
   analysis of 581 light-trap catches collected in 321 farms from 2003 to
   2008. We observed that 82\% of checked farms were positive for
   Culicoides spp., and only 10\% of the farms were positive for Culicoides

Abstract = {Mussels live in diverse coastal environments experience various
   physical, chemical and biological conditions, which they counteract with
   functional adjustments and heritable adaptive changes. In order to
   investigate possible differences in immune system capabilities, we
   analyzed by qPCR the expression levels of 4 immune genes (defensin,
   mytilin B, myticin B, lysozyme) and HSP70 in the Mediterranean mussel,
   Mytilus galloprovincialis collected in 3 European farming areas
   \{Atlantic Ocean-Ria de Vigo-Spain (RV), French Mediterranean Gulf of
   Lion-Palavas-Prevost lagoon (PP) and Northern Adriatic Sea-Venice-Italy
   (VI)\} in response to one injection of one of the 3 bacterial species
   (Vibrio splendidus LGP32. Vibrio anguillarum, Micrococcus
   lysodeikticus), and to heat shock or cold stress. We confirmed that the
   5 genes are constitutively expressed in hemocytes, defensin being the
   less expressed, myticin B the highest. As suspected, the same gene
   resulted differently expressed according to mussel group, with the
   biggest difference being for HSP70 and lysozyme and lowest expression of
   all the 5 genes in mussels from RV. In addition, gene expression levels
   varied according to the challenge. Most frequent effect of bacterial
   injections was down-regulation, especially for mytilin B and myticin B.
   Heat shock enhanced transcript levels, particularly in mussels from RV,
   whereas cold stress had no effect. In situ hybridization of labelled
   probes on mussel hemocytes indicated that bacterial injections did not
   change the mRNA patterns of defensin and myticin B whereas mytilin B
   mRNA almost disappeared. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that
   constitutive level, nature and intensity of immune gene expression
   regulations strongly depended from mussel group, and support the concept
   of gene environment interactions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {A real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a green fluorescence
   dye, followed by a comparison of derivative melting curves in the
   post-amplification phase, was developed to distinguish species of
   Culicoides within the Obsoletus Complex. The selected target sequence
   was internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS 2) of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA).
   Using the newly developed method, 140 midges were morphologically
   classified in the Obsoletus Complex and were processed. The results were
   compared to those obtained by combining the morphological identification
   with the gel based reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. By analysing the
   species-specific pattern of the dissociation curves, it was possible to
   identify 52 midges as Culicoides scoticus, 82 midges as C. obsoletus
   sensu strictu and 6 as C. montanus. These results matched those obtained
   by the combination of gel-based PCR and morphological identification
   used on a routine basis. Given its diagnostic flexibility, rapid
   results, automation capability, high quality result performance and
   expression, the real-time ITS 2 rDNA PCR appears to be more functional

Abstract = {Honey bee and colony mortality have been reported for several years in
   many countries as well as in Italy. In the last years this phenomenon
   has become increasingly serious, and several hypotheses have been
   proposed to explain honey bee and colony losses. These hypotheses relate
   to pests and diseases, pesticides, apicultural practices, climate
   change, electromagnetic fields, GMO crops, etc. Honey bee colony losses
   are being surveyed in several European countries, but these surveys are
   not sufficiently structured. Based on beekeepers' reports, honey bee
   losses in Italy follow a clear seasonal pattern: a) during spring and
   summer colonies lose many foragers due to agrochemicals (bee losses); b)
   from late summer to winter, the impact of pests (including Varroa) and
   pathogens becomes more important (colony losses). To assess the extent
   and investigate the possible causes of honey bee and colony losses in
   Italy a national monitoring network needs to be established. Target
   apiaries will be distributed in selected sites (modules), ideally one
   per region, to cover the national territory. Each module, composed of
   five apiaries with ten non-migratory, colonies each, will be chosen
   based on environmental characteristics with a distance to the center a
   the module of bout 50 km. Colonies will be visually inspected four times
   a year (right after winter spring, Runnier and just before winter). In
   each inspection several parameters of each colony will be considered
   health and nutritional condition, number of bees and brood, and queen's
   age. The person in charge of each module will input the information
   obtained in a real-time database available on the Internet. In addition,
   dead and live bees, as well as several beehive matrices (brood, pollen,
   wax) will be collected during each inspection for chemical, pollen and
   disease analyses. The information collected through this honey-bee
   monitoring network will provide a broad database from which to explore
   patterns of disease, toxic exposure and management practices that may be
   linked to the occurrence of honey bee and colony losses. APENET aims at
   providing an accurate assessment of the overall health condition of
   honey bees at the national level.},

Abstract = {The Province of Pesaro-Urbino, situated in the Marche Region of central
   Italy, can be considered to be an area at risk for Lyme disease because
   of its ecological features. Field data are not yet available although
   the disease is known to be present in neighbouring areas. During a field
   study lasting twelve months, ticks were collected from the vegetation,
   from wild cervids and also from humans who reported a tick bite at the
   local hospital. All ticks were identified and Ixodes ricin us specimens
   were tested using three different polymerase chain reaction tests for
   the detection of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (sl). To identify the
   genospecies of B. burgdorferi sl, a fragment of the 5S-23S ribosomal
   rRNA intergenic spacer of the positive samples was amplified and then
   sequenced. Sequencing of the 5S-23S intergenic spacer led to the
   identification of two different genospecies, namely: B. burgdorferi
   sensu stricto and B. lusitaniae, both of which are involved in cases of
   human infection. Findings on the host-tick relationships and on the
   genospecies involved in the cycle of borreliosis confirm the suitable
   conditions for Lyme disease in the study area. The results concur with
   previous findings reported in the Mediterranean region.},

Abstract = {In the last two decades, the emergence and spread of
   antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, among them Salmonella, has become a
   serious health hazard worldwide, and specifically the high incidence of

   Salmonella enterica strains Typhimurium and Enteritidis isolated in
   Campania and Calabria region (Southern Italy) fromanimal and food of
   animal origin. The relationship of antibiotic resistance phenotype and
   the presence of some resistance genes has been also investigated. As
   espected, our results showes that resistance to ampicillin,
   chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulphonamides and tetracycline is common,
   although resistance to other antibiotics (i.e.: nalidixic acid) and
   other resistance patterns occur. The genetic resistant patterns have
   been partially described for this food-borne pathogen but efforts are
   needed to realize the complete characterization of antimicrobial
   resistance genes.},

Abstract = {The authors evaluated the prevalence of Listeria monocytogenes,
   Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp. and staphylococcal enterotoxin
   in 2 132 samples selected from six types of cheese on the basis of
   recorded consumption in Italy in 2004. In L. monocytogenes-positive
   samples the precise level of contamination was determined. To define the
   physical-chemical characteristics of the selected natural cheeses, the
   pH values, water activity and sodium chloride content were determined.
   The results suggest that blue and soft cheeses (Brie, Camembert,
   Gorgonzola and Taleggio) are more likely to be contaminated with L.
   monocytogenes. The mean prevalence of L. monocytogenes in the six types
   of cheese was 2.4\% (from 0.2\% in Asiago and Crescenza to 6.5\% in
   Taleggio), with contamination levels of up to 460 MPN/g. No presence of
   Salmonella spp. and E. coli O157 was found in any sample. Staphylococcal
   enterotoxin was found in 0.6\% of the samples examined. Physical and
   chemical parameter values confirmed that all types of cheese are
   considered capable of supporting the growth of L. monocytogenes. The
   study confirmed the need to apply effective control at production and
   sales levels to reduce the probability of contamination by L.
   monocytogenes. This micro-organism can attain high levels of
   contamination in food products, such as cheeses that have a long
   shelf-life when associated with difficulties of maintaining appropriate
   storage temperatures in both sales points and in the home.},

Abstract = {P>Different approaches are being developed to improve the
   differentiation of Leishmania genus using biochemical and molecular
   methods. In this study, 11 independent polymorphic microsatellites were
   used for the typing of strains of L. infantum isolated in Sicily.
   Polymerase chain reaction was employed to amplify the microsatellites
   contained in 12 DNA regions selected from among more investigated loci.
   A total of 51 isolates of L. infantum from dogs were tested by using the
   same locus panel. The products were successively analysed using an
   automatic sequence detector (ABI PRISM 3130 AB), to discover relevant
   microsatellite polymorphisms. It was possible to discriminate between
   MON-1 and non-MON-1 groups. Moreover, the method permitted to
   distinguish various genotypes of L. infantum isolates within each
   zymodema. Model- and distance-based analyses of the data set showed
   comparable results. The frequency of heterozygosity in the alleles
   analysed varied extremely between the different groups of isolates. As
   the method exhibits a high level of discrimination, it is suitable for
   characterization of closely related strains in epidemiological studies.},

Abstract = {P>The prevalence of Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, Rickettsia and
   Babesia/Theileria species was analysed in questing and feeding adult
   ticks in Sicily. A total of 678 ticks were collected and analysed in
   this study. Of these, 29 were questing ticks and 649 were collected from
   infested cattle, sheep, goats or dogs. Tick species analysed included
   Rhipicephalus bursa, R. turanicus, R. sanguineus, Hyalomma lusitanicum,
   H. marginatum, Dermacentor marginatus, Ixodes ricinus, R. (Boophilus)
   annulatus and Haemaphysalis punctata. With the exception of R. annulatus
   and H. punctata for which only eight and 15 ticks were analysed,
   respectively, all tick species were found to be infected. Most ticks
   were found to be infected with a single pathogen genus. Data obtained
   from questing ticks was analysed to test for differences between tick
   species in the prevalence of infection for different pathogens. These
   preliminary results suggested that the most important vectors of
   pathogens that may affect human and/or animal health in Sicily are R.
   turanicus for Anaplasma spp. and D. marginatus for Rickettsia spp. For
   Ehrlichia spp. and Babesia/Theileria spp., R. turanicus/D. marginatus
   and H. lusitanicum may be the most important vectors but additional
   studies are needed to confirm these results.},

Abstract = {P>Babesia bigemina is a parasite endemic in different parts of the
   world, including Europe and the Americas. One of the few genes
   characterized in this species codifies for the Apical Membrane Antigen 1
   (AMA-1), a trans-membrane antigen recently identified. In this research,
   we characterized the ama-1 gene from three Italian B. bigemina strains,
   two B. bigemina strains obtained from Ragusa, Sicily (ITA1 and ITA3) and
   a third one obtained from Benevento, Campania (ITA2). Italian sequences
   were compared with those of the Australian strain obtained from the
   Sanger Institute web site and to strains from different parts of the
   world. The results obtained confirmed that this newly described ama-1
   gene is highly conserved among Italian and foreign strains which has
   implications for vaccine development.},

Abstract = {A fatal Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection epidemic involving
   fifteen primates occurred between October 2006 and February 2007 at the
   Natura Viva Zoo. This large open-field zoo park located near Lake Garda
   in Northern Italy hosts one thousand animals belonging to one hundred
   and fifty different species, including various lemur species. This lemur
   collection is the most relevant and rich in Italy. A second outbreak
   between September and November 2008 involved three lemurs. In all cases,
   the clinical signs were sudden deaths generally without any evident
   symptoms or only with mild unspecific clinical signs. Gross pathologic
   changes were characterized by myocarditis (diffuse or focal pallor of
   the myocardium), pulmonary congestion, emphysema, oedema and thoracic
   fluid. The EMCV was isolated and recognized as the causative agent of
   both outbreaks. The first outbreak in particular was associated with a
   rodent plague, confirming that rats are an important risk factor for the
   occurrence of the EMCV infection.},

Abstract = {The nematode larvae of the Anisakis genus are one of the main health
   hazards for consumers of raw fish or similar, such as ``carpaccio{''},
   and cold smoked or marinated products.
   This study evaluated the efficacy of high hydrostatic pressure
   treatments on Anisakis larvae in mackerel (Scomber scombrus) from the
   North Sea. From the treatment parameters studied, a combination of 300
   MPa for 5 min resulted as being capable of inactivating 100\% of the
   larvae present in the tissues of the fish treated. Biomolecular
   examination confirmed their main belonging to the species Anisakis
   simplex sensu stricto.
   The use of this technology is for the treatment of other fatty fish such
   as sardines and anchovies prior to marinating. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {The ongoing animal and human health crises caused by influenza viruses
   of H5N1 subtype have focused the attention of international
   organizations and donors on the need for improved veterinary
   infrastructure in developing countries and the need for improved
   communication between the human and animal health sectors. The
   circulation and re-emergence of high-pathogenicity avian influenza
   viruses of H5N1 subtype are still major concerns because of potential
   effects on human health, on the profitability of poultry industries, and
   on the livelihood of the rural environment. Significant improvements
   toward the management of these outbreaks have occurred worldwide,
   including new legislative tools, intervention strategies, and
   investments in capacity building in both developed and developing
   countries. This has led to a greater understanding of certain aspects of
   this infection and of its pandemic potential, although we are still far
   from certainties and from resolving the situation. Given that genetic
   analysis of the viruses causing human pandemics since the beginning of
   the 20th century have indicated that at least the hemagglutinin gene was
   donated from an avian progenitor virus, it would seem reasonable to
   exploit the information we have from an animal health perspective to
   support public health policies. Possibly the biggest challenge we have
   is to find novel ways to maximize the use of the information that is
   generated as a result of the improved networking and diagnostic
   capacities. In the era of globalization, emerging and re-emerging
   diseases of public health relevance are a concern to developing and
   developed countries and are a real threat because of the interdependence
   of the global economy. Communication and analysis systems currently
   available should be tailored to meet global health priorities, and used
   to develop and constantly improve novel systems for the exploitation of
   information to generate knowledge. Another fundamental task the
   veterinary community needs to deliver on is that of bringing relevant
   information to international discussion tables at which international
   control and prevention are presented and optimized. The veterinary
   community has knowledge and areas of expertise that should undoubtedly
   be part of strategic decisions and are essential to manage the human and
   animal health implications of avian influenza infections.},

Abstract = {Since 1999, the Italian poultry production system has experienced
   several outbreaks of avian influenza (AI), mainly located in
   northeastern Italy. This paper describes the low pathogenicity (LP) AI
   outbreaks detected during the surveillance activities implemented in
   2007-08. From May to October 2007, ten rural and hobby poultry farms
   were infected by an LPAI virus of the H7N3 subtype. In August-October
   2007, the H7N3 LPAI virus was introduced into the industrial poultry
   sector with the involvement of six meat turkey farms. Phylogenetic
   analysis of the hemagglutinin gene indicated that all but one of the
   H7N3 virus strains had a high level of homology (98.7\%-99.8\%).
   Furthermore, in August 2007, an LPAI H5N2 virus was identified in a
   free-range geese and duck breeder flock. The hemagglutinin and
   neuraminidase genes showed a high level of homology (99.8\% and 99.9\%,
   respectively) with H5N2 LPAI viruses isolated from mallards in July 2007
   in the same area, suggesting a possible introduction from the wild
   reservoir. All the birds (in total 129:386) on the infected poultry
   farms were culled. The prompt implementation of AI control measures,
   including the enforcement of a targeted emergency vaccination plan,
   allowed the rapid eradication of infection. In 2008, three LPAI viruses
   (two H7N1 and one H5N1) were identified in dealer/rural farms. The
   surveillance activity implemented in this area allowed the prompt
   detection of LPAI viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes in the rural sector,
   which, as observed in the 2007 epidemic, might be the source of
   infection for industrial poultry.},

Abstract = {In order to investigate viral adaptation mechanisms to poultry, we
   performed serial in vivo passages of a wild bird low pathogenicity avian
   influenza isolate of the H7N3 subtype (A/mallard/Italy/33/01) in three
   different domestic species (chicken, turkey, and Japanese quail). The
   virus under study was administered via natural routes at the dose of 10
   egg infective dose(50)/ 0.1 ml to chickens, turkeys, and quails in order
   to investigate the clinical susceptibility and the shedding levels after
   infection. Multiple in vivo passages of the virus were performed by
   serially infecting groups of five nave birds of each species, with
   samples collected from a previously infected group. Quails and turkeys
   were susceptible to infection for 10 serial passages, whereas chickens
   were susceptible to two cycles of infection only. Infection of chicken
   with the quail- and turkey-adapted viruses showed an increased
   pathogenicity and/or shedding, causing more severe clinical signs and/or
   higher levels of viral excretion compared to the original strain. The
   data obtained herein suggest that infection of selected avian species
   may facilitate the adaptation of avian influenza viruses originating
   from the wild bird reservoir to chicken. This is the first time turkey
   has been shown to act as a species in which a virus from the wild
   reservoir can increase its replication activity in other domestic
   species.},

Abstract = {The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)/United Nations Food and
   Agriculture Organization (FAO) joint network of expertise on animal
   influenza (OFFLU) includes all ten OIE/FAO reference laboratories and
   collaborating centers for avian influenza, other diagnostic
   laboratories, research and academic institutions, and experts in the
   fields of virology, epidemiology, vaccinology, and molecular biology.
   OFFLU has made significant progress in improving its infrastructure, in
   identifying and addressing technical gaps, and in establishing
   associations among leading veterinary institutions. Interaction with the
   World Health Organization (WHO) Global Influenza Program is also
   critical, and mechanisms for permanent interaction are being developed.
   OFFLU played a key role in the WHO/OIE/FAO Joint Technical Consultation
   held in Verona (October 7-9, 2008), which provided an opportunity to
   highlight and share knowledge and identify potential gaps regarding
   issues at the human-animal interface for avian influenza. OFFLU experts
   also contributed to the working group for the Unified Nomenclature
   System for H5N1 influenza viruses based on hemagglutinin gene phylogeny
   (WHO/OIE/FAO, H5N1 Evolution Working Group, Towards a unified
   nomenclature system for highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1)
   in Emerging Infectious Diseases 14:e1, 2008). OFFLU technical
   activities, led by expert scientists from OIE/FAO reference institutions
   and coordinated by OIE and FAO focal points, have been prioritized to
   include commercial diagnostic kit evaluation, applied epidemiology,
   biosafety, vaccination, proficiency testing, development of standardized
   reference materials for sera and RNA, and issues at the human-animal
   interface. The progress to dare and future plans for these groups will
   be presented. OFFLU is also involved in two national projects
   implemented by FAO in Indonesia and Egypt that seek to establish
   sustainable mechanisms for monitoring virus circulation, including viral
   characterization, and for streamlining the process to update poultry
   vaccines for avian influenza.},

Abstract = {Spinocerebellar ataxia type15 (SCA15) is a pure ataxia characterized by
   very slow progression. Only seven families have been identified
   worldwide, in which partial deletions and a missense mutation of the
   inositol triphosphate receptor type I gene (ITPR1) have been reported.
   We examined a four-generation Italian family segregating an autosomal
   dominant cerebellar ataxia, in which linkage analysis was positive for
   the SCA15 locus. We performed a genomic real-time polymerase chain
   reaction to search for ITPR1 gene deletions in this family and in 60 SCA
   index cases negative for mutations in the SCA1-3, 6-8, 10, 12, and
   dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy genes. The deleted segments were
   characterized using a custom array comparative genomic hybridization
   analysis. We have identified two families with an ITPR1 gene deletion:
   in one, the deletion involved ITPR1 only, while in the other both
   sulfatase-modifying factor 1 and ITPR1. Clinical data of ten patients
   and brain MRI (available for six) showed that the phenotype
   substantially overlapped known SCA15 cases, but we also noted
   buccolingual dyskinesias, facial myokymias, and pyramidal signs never
   reported in SCA15. ITPR1 expression analysis of two deleted cases showed
   a half dose. Our results further support ITPR1 gene as causative of
   SCA15. The families reported show that SCA15 is present in Italy and has
   a greater variability in the age at onset and clinical features than
   previously reported. We propose that the search for ITPR1 deletions is
   mandatory in the clinical hypothesis of SCA15 and that ITPR1-reduced
   expression in blood may be a useful marker to identify SCA15 patients
   harboring genomic deletions and possibly point mutations causing
   reduction of mRNA level.},

Title = {Cerebral Toxoplasmosis in Striped Dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba)
   Stranded Along the Ligurian Sea Coast of Italy},

Abstract = {This article reports the results of necropsy, parasitologic,
   microbiologic, histopathologic, immunohistochemical, indirect
   immunofluorescence, biomolecular, and serologic investigations on 8
   striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) found stranded from August to
   December 2007 on the Ligurian Sea coast of Italy. Severe, nonsuppurative
   meningoencephalitis was found in 4 animals, as characterized by
   prominent perivascular mononuclear cell cuffing and macrophage
   accumulations in neuropil. These lesions were associated with mild
   lymphocytic plasmacytic infiltration of choroid plexuses in I dolphin.
   Toxoplasma gondii cysts and zoites, confirmed by immunohistochemical
   labeling, were scattered throughout the brain parenchyma of 2 of the 4
   dolphins. No viral inclusions were seen in the brain of any animal.
   Other findings included severe bronchointerstitial pneumonia and
   pulmonary atelectasis, consolidation, and emphysema. Parasites were
   identified in a variety of organs, including lung (Halocerchus
   lagenorhynchi). Microbiologic and serologic examinations for Brucella
   spp were negative on all 8 dolphins. The 4 animals with
   meningoencephalitis had serum antibodies against T gondii (titers
   ranging from 1:80 to 1:320) but not against morbillivirus. In contrast,
   the other 4 dolphins were seropositive for morbillivirus (with titers
   ranging from 1:10 to 1:40) but seronegative for T gondii. No
   morbillivirus antigen or nucleic acid was detected in the tissues of any
   dolphin. It is concluded that the severe lung and brain lesions were the
   cause of death and that T gondii was the likely etiologic agent of the
   cerebral lesions. Morbillivirus infection was not considered to have
   contributed to death of these animals.},

Volume = {2},

Abstract = {We analysed the between-farm transmission of the H7N1 highly pathogenic
   avian influenza virus that disrupted the Italian poultry production in
   the 1999-2000 epidemic with a SEIR model with a spatial transmission
   kernel, accounting for the containment measures actually undertaken. We
   found significant differences in susceptibility between species and a
   reduction in transmissibility after the first phase. We performed
   simulations to assess the effectiveness of the implemented and new
   control measures. The most effective measure was the ban on restocking.
   An earlier start of pre-emptive culling promotes eradication; restricted
   pre-emptive culling delays eradication but causes lower losses. (C) 2010

Abstract = {An outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus subtype
   H5N1 was first diagnosed in a ``backyard{''} flock of peafowl (Polio
   cristatus) raised on palace premises in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in
   December 3, 2007. The flock consisted of 40 peafowl, and their ages
   ranged from 3 to 5 years old. Affected birds suffered from depression,
   anorexia, and white diarrhea. Four dead birds were submitted for HPAI
   diagnosis at the Central Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Riyadh.
   Brain and liver tissues and tracheal and cloacal swabs were taken from
   the dead birds and processed for a real-time reverse transcriptase
   (RT)-PCR test and virus isolation in specific-pathogen-free embryonating
   chicken eggs. The H5N1 subtype of avian influenza virus was isolated
   from the four dead birds and identified by a real-time RT-PCR before and
   after egg inoculation. The virus isolates were characterized as HPAI
   H5N1 virus by sequencing analysis. Phylogenetic comparisons revealed
   that the H5N1 viruses isolated from peafowl belong to the genetic chide
   2.2 according to the World Health Organization nomenclature. The peafowl
   H5N1 virus falls into 2.2.2 sublineage II and clusters with the H5N1
   viruses isolated from poultry in Saudi Arabia in 2007-08.},

Abstract = {2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME), a metabolite deriving from 17-beta estradiol,
   is a well-established antiangiogenic, apoptotic and antiproliferative
   agent in cell cultures and animal models. 2ME may also exert its
   cytotoxic activity by interacting with tubulin and by causing an
   impairment of the microtubular system. The ann of this study was to
   investigate the relative effectiveness of 2ME on mouse neuroblastoma
   (CI300) and rat glioma (C6) cell lines in inducing morpho-functional
   changes and alteration of the microtubular system physiology Cells,
   cultured in a medium supplemented with increasing 2ME micromolar
   concentrations, were submitted to morphological investigations, MTT
   assay and western blot analysis. 2ME-exposed cell lines displayed in
   comparison with control cells, morpho-functional changes such as
   reduction in cell number, a globular/shrunken shape, retraction or
   absence of cytoplasmic processes. inhibition of cell growth and cell
   decreased viability Interestingly, all changes detected were more
   evident in CI300 cells than in C6 cells Western blot analysis showed
   that the total and the tyrosinated alpha-tubulin expression was reduced
   more intensely in the CI300 than in CO cells, whereas the acetylated
   alpha-tubulin expression did not significantly decrease in either cell
   lines Results demonstrate that 2ME is more effective in neural cells
   than in glial cells. The alteration of total and tyrosinated a-tubulin
   expression suggests that 2ME effectiveness could be strictly related to
   an impairment of microtubule system physiology resulting in
   morpho-functional changes, block of mitosis and cell death.},

Abstract = {A 6-year-old ferret (Mustela putorius furo) was presented with abdominal
   enlargement. Clinical examination revealed an intra-abdominal mass
   measuring approximately 5 cm in diameter. Abdominal survey radiographs
   revealed a sharply marginated mass with multifocal radiodense foci,
   suggestive of pathologic calcification. A complete blood cell count
   revealed a moderate, normocytic, normochromic, nonregenerative anemia.
   The mass was surgically removed en bloc, fixed in 10\% neutral buffered
   formalin solution, and routinely processed for histologic and
   immunohistochemical investigation. The neoplastic tissue consisted of a
   mixed neoplastic cell population, including osteosarcoma and
   librosarcoma components. Immunohistochemistry revealed that both
   neoplastic cell populations were positive for vimentin and negative for
   actin (smooth and striated), desmin, and myoglobin. Nonabsorbable suture
   material was admixed with the neoplastic tissue in the histologic
   section. This material was birefringent when viewed microscopically
   under polarized light.},

Abstract = {The success of emergency intervention to control contagious animal
   diseases is dependent on the preparedness of veterinary services. In the
   framework of avian influenza preparedness, the Italian Ministry of
   Health, in cooperation with the National Reference Centers for
   Epidemiology and Avian Influenza, implemented an electronic learning
   course using new web-based information and communication technologies.
   The course was designed to train veterinary officers involved in disease
   outbreak management, laboratory diagnosis, and policy making. The
   ``blended learning model' was applied, involving participants in
   tutor-supported self-learning, collaborative learning activities, and
   virtual classes. The course duration was 16 hr spread over a 4-wk
   period. Six editions were implemented for 705 participants. All
   participants completed the evaluation assignments, and the drop out rate
   was very low (only 4\%). This project increased the number of
   professionals receiving high-quality training on Al in Italy, while
   reducing expenditure and maximizing return on effort.},

Abstract = {Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are determinant events in
   the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Silybin has shown
   antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic effects in chronic
   liver disease. We aimed to study the effect of the silybin-phospholipid
   complex (SILIPHOS) on liver redox balance and mitochondrial function in
   a dietary model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. To accomplish this,
   glutathione oxidation, mitochondrial oxygen uptake, proton leak, ATP
   homeostasis, and H2O2 production rate were evaluated in isolated liver
   mitochondria from rats fed a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD)
   diet and the MCD diet plus SILIPHOS for 7 and 14 weeks. Oxidative
   proteins, hydroxynonenal (HNE)- and malondialdehyde (MDA)-protein
   adducts, and mitochondrial membrane lipid composition were also
   measured. Treatment with SILIPHOS limited glutathione depletion and
   mitochondrial H2O2 production. Moreover, SILIPHOS preserved
   mitochondrial bioenergetics and prevented mitochondrial proton leak and
   ATP reduction. Finally, SILIPHOS limited the formation of HNE- and
   MDA-protein adducts. In conclusion, SILIPHOS is effective in preventing
   severe oxidative stress and preserving hepatic mitochondrial
   bioenergetics in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis induced by the MCD diet.
   The modifications of mitochondrial membrane fatty acid composition
   induced by the MCD diet are partially prevented by SILIPHOS, conferring
   anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects. The increased vulnerability
   of lipid membranes to oxidative damage is limited by SILIPHOS through
   preserved mitochondrial function.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the results or the molecular and phylogenetic
   analysis of seven highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 strains
   isolated in 2006 (n = 5) and 2007 (n = 2) from wild birds and poultry in
   Poland. The whole genome sequence of these isolates was determined. All
   of the isolates possessed the hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site sequence
   PQGERRRKKR{*}GLE typical of El PAL molecular markers associated with
   increased adaptation and virulence in mammals, as well as susceptibility
   to neuraminidase inhibitors, were revealed in the HA, neuraminidase
   (NA), and PB2 proteins. Based on the sequencing results related to the
   HA and NA genomic segments. H5N1 viruses circulating in Poland all
   belong to lineage 2.2. However, isolates isolated in 2006 were
   genetically distinct from those isolated in 2007 and grouped in
   different sublineages. H5N1 viruses isolated from wild birds in 2006 are
   almost identical to each other (99.9\% HA; 99.6\%-100\% NA), and they
   are grouped within a cluster of viruses isolated in Germany from wild
   and domestic birds and mammals in 2006. Isolates from 2007 are also
   closely related to each other (nucleotide homologies 99.9\% and 100\%
   for HA and NA, respectively), and they are grouped together with
   isolates from wild and domestic birds collected in Eastern and Central
   Europe (Romania, Germany), and the Middle East (Kuwait, Saudi Arabia).
   Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences related to the internal proteins
   confirmed the results obtained for the HA and NA genes. Overall, the
   results indicate that HPAI H5N1 in Poland in 2006-07 was caused by at
   least two separate incursions of genetically distinct viruses.},

Abstract = {Two caliciviruses occur in Australian wild rabbits: rabbit calicivirus
   Australia I (RCV-A1) and rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), which
   is used in Australia as a biocontrol agent to reduce feral rabbit
   populations. There is concern that RCV-A1 acts as a natural vaccine and
   protects from lethal RHDV infection. To investigate this hypothesis,
   domestic rabbits were perorally infected with RCV-A1, monitored for 28
   days and subsequently challenged with RHDV. We show that RCV-A1 causes a
   non-pathogenic infection and is shed in faeces for up to 7 days
   post-infection. RCV-A1 was detected in the bile 2 months
   post-inoculation, indicating a prolonged or possible persistent
   infection. All animals infected with RCV-A1 developed antibodies
   cross-reacting to RHDV. When challenged with RDHV, half of the rabbits
   (n = 4) survived the infection. The results indicate that RCV-A1 is
   likely to persist in rabbit populations and can elicit partial
   cross-protection to lethal RHDV infection. (C) 2009 Published by

   promastigote soluble antigen (LSA) formulated with three different
   adjuvants (BCG, AdjuPrime (TM), MPL/TDM/CWS).
   A significant increase of the macrophage killing ability was observed in
   dogs vaccinated with LSA + MPL/TDM/CWS after 1 month from vaccination. A
   similar increase of macrophage parasitocidal ability was present only
   after 5 months in dogs vaccinated with LSA + BCG or LSA + AdjuPrime
   (TM). In all dogs the augmented killing percentage was still present
   after 12 months from vaccination. Therefore, in particular LSA +
   MPL/TDM/CWS vaccine seems promising for further studies in dogs. (C)

Title = {SNR analysis: molecular investigation of an anthrax epidemic},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {6},
Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {Background: In Italy, anthrax is endemic but occurs sporadically. During
   the summer of 2004, in the Pollino National Park, Basilicata, Southern
   Italy, an anthrax epidemic consisting of 41 outbreaks occurred; it
   claimed the lives of 124 animals belonging to different mammal species.
   This study is a retrospective molecular epidemiological investigation
   carried out on 53 isolates collected during the epidemic. A 25-loci
   Multiple Locus VNTR Analysis (MLVA) MLVA was initially performed to
   define genetic relationships, followed by an investigation of genetic
   diversity between epidemic strains through Single Nucleotide Repeat
   (SNR) analysis.
   Results: 53 Bacillus anthracis strains were isolated. The 25-loci MLVA
   analysis identified all of them as belonging to a single genotype, while
   the SNR analysis was able to detect the existence of five subgenotypes
   (SGTs), allowing a detailed epidemic investigation. SGT-1 was the most
   frequent (46/53); SGTs 2 (4/53), 3 (1/53) 4 (1/53) and 5 (1/53) were
   detected in the remaining seven isolates.
   Conclusions: The analysis revealed the prevalent spread, during this
   epidemic, of a single anthrax clone. SGT-1 widely distributed across the
   epidemic area and present throughout the period in question-may, thus,
   be the ancestral form. SGTs 2, 3 and 4 differed from SGT-1 at only one
   locus, suggesting that they could have evolved directly from the latter
   during the course of this epidemic. SGT-5 differed from the other SGTs
   at 2-3 loci. This isolate, thus, appears to be more distantly related to
   SGT-1 and may not be a direct descendant of the lineage responsible for
   the majority of cases in this epidemic. These data confirm the
   importance of molecular typing and subtyping methods for in-depth
   epidemiological analyses of anthrax epidemics.},

Abstract = {The fish pathogenic rhabdovirus infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus

   Phylogenetic analyses of the full G-gene sequences of 73 isolates

   Switzerland, 4; Germany, 42) enable determination of the evolution of
   the virus in Europe since the first detection, and identification of
   characteristic changes within the G-genes of European strains. Further,
   the database allows us to analyse the pathways of distribution in Europe
   over time. The results suggest that in most of the recent cases, spread
   of IHNV was related to trade of infected fish. The data further
   demonstrate that knowledge of the sequence is required to determine the

Title = {Avian influenza virus monitoring in wintering waterbirds in Iran,
   2003-2007},
Journal = {VIROLOGY JOURNAL},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {7},
Month = {FEB 19},
Abstract = {Background: Virological, molecular and serological studies were carried
   out to determine the status of infections with avian influenza viruses
   (AIV) in different species of wild waterbirds in Iran during 2003-2007.
   Samples were collected from 1146 birds representing 45 different species
   with the majority of samples originating from ducks, coots and
   shorebirds. Samples originated from 6 different provinces representative
   for the 15 most important wintering sites of migratory waterbirds in
   Iran.
   Results: Overall, AIV were detected in approximately 3.4\% of the
   samples. However, prevalence was higher (up to 8.3\%) at selected
   locations and for certain species. No highly pathogenic avian influenza,
   including H5N1 was detected. A total of 35 AIVs were detected from
   cloacal or oropharyngeal swab samples. These positive samples originated
   mainly from Mallards and Common Teals. Of 711 serum samples tested for
   AIV antibodies, 345 (48.5\%) were positive by using a
   nucleoprotein-specific competitive ELISA (NP-C-ELISA). Ducks including
   Mallard, Common Teal, Common Pochard, Northern Shoveler and Eurasian
   Wigeon revealed the highest antibody prevalence ranging from 44 to 75\%.
   Conclusion: Results of these investigations provide important
   information about the prevalence of LPAIV in wild birds in Iran,
   especially wetlands around the Caspian Sea which represent an important
   wintering site for migratory water birds. Mallard and Common Teal
   exhibited the highest number of positives in virological and serological

   46\% serological positive reactions, respectively. These two species may
   play an important role in the ecology and perpetuation of influenza
   viruses in this region. In addition, it could be shown that both
   oropharyngeal and cloacal swab samples contribute to the detection of
   positive birds, and neither should be neglected.},

Title = {Subolesin expression in response to pathogen infection in ticks},
Journal = {BMC IMMUNOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {11},
Month = {FEB 19},
Abstract = {Background: Ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) are vectors of pathogens worldwide
   that cause diseases in humans and animals. Ticks and pathogens have
   co-evolved molecular mechanisms that contribute to their mutual
   development and survival. Subolesin was discovered as a tick protective
   antigen and was subsequently shown to be similar in structure and
   function to akirins, an evolutionarily conserved group of proteins in
   insects and vertebrates that controls NF-kB-dependent and independent
   expression of innate immune response genes. The objective of this study
   was to investigate subolesin expression in several tick species infected
   with a variety of pathogens and to determine the effect of subolesin
   gene knockdown on pathogen infection. In the first experiment, subolesin
   expression was characterized in ticks experimentally infected with the
   cattle pathogen, Anaplasma marginale. Subolesin expression was then
   characterized in questing or feeding adult ticks confirmed to be
   infected with Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, Rickettsia, Babesia or Theileria
   spp. Finally, the effect of subolesin knockdown by RNA interference
   (RNAi) on tick infection was analyzed in Dermacentor variabilis males
   exposed to various pathogens by capillary feeding (CF).
   Results: Subolesin expression increased with pathogen infection in the
   salivary glands but not in the guts of tick vector species infected with
   A. marginale. When analyzed in whole ticks, subolesin expression varied
   between tick species and in response to different pathogens. As reported
   previously, subolesin knockdown in D. variabilis infected with A.
   marginale and other tick-borne pathogens resulted in lower infection
   levels, while infection with Francisella tularensis increased in ticks
   after RNAi. When non-tick-borne pathogens were fed to ticks by CF,
   subolesin RNAi did not affect or resulted in lower infection levels in
   ticks. However, subolesin expression was upregulated in D. variabilis
   exposed to Escherichia coli, suggesting that although this pathogen may
   induce subolesin expression in ticks, silencing of this molecule reduced
   bacterial multiplication by a presently unknown mechanism.
   Conclusions: Subolesin expression in infected ticks suggested that
   subolesin may be functionally important for tick innate immunity to
   pathogens, as has been reported for the akirins. However, subolesin
   expression and consequently subolesin-mediated innate immunity varied
   with the pathogen and tick tissue. Subolesin may plays a role in tick
   innate immunity in the salivary glands by limiting pathogen infection
   levels, but activates innate immunity only for some pathogen in the guts
   and other tissues. In addition, these results provided additional
   support for the role of subolesin in other molecular pathways including
   those required for tissue development and function and for pathogen
   infection and multiplication in ticks. Consequently, RNAi experiments
   demonstrated that subolesin knockdown in ticks may affect pathogen
   infection directly by reducing tick innate immunity that results},

Abstract = {The declaration of the human influenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (H1N1/09)
   raised important questions, including origin and host range {[}1,2]. Two
   of the three pandemics in the last century resulted in the spread of
   virus to pigs (H1N1, 1918; H3N2, 1968) with subsequent independent
   establishment and evolution within swine worldwide {[}3]. A key public
   and veterinary health consideration in the context of the evolving
   pandemic is whether the H1N1/09 virus could become established in pig
   populations {[}4]. We performed an infection and transmission study in
   pigs with A/California/07/09. In combination, clinical, pathological,
   modified influenza A matrix gene real time RT-PCR and viral genomic
   analyses have shown that infection results in the induction of clinical
   signs, viral pathogenesis restricted to the respiratory tract, infection
   dynamics consistent with endemic strains of influenza A in pigs, virus
   transmissibility between pigs and virus-host adaptation events. Our
   results demonstrate that extant H1N1/09 is fully capable of becoming
   established in global pig populations. We also show the roles of viral
   receptor specificity in both transmission and tissue tropism.
   Remarkably, following direct inoculation of pigs with virus quasispecies
   differing by amino acid substitutions in the haemagglutinin
   receptor-binding site, only virus with aspartic acid at position 225
   (225D) was detected in nasal secretions of contact infected pigs. In
   contrast, in lower respiratory tract samples from directly inoculated
   pigs, with clearly demonstrable pulmonary pathology, there was apparent
   selection of a virus variant with glycine (225G). These findings provide
   potential clues to the existence and biological significance of viral
   receptor-binding variants with 225D and 225G during the 1918 pandemic
   {[}5].},

Abstract = {Interferon (IFN)-alpha and IFN-gamma positive cells were revealed by
   flow cytometry in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of Specific
   Pathogen Free (SPF) pigs. A low prevalence of IFN-gamma positive cells
   was also detected in PBMC of some Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory
   Syndrome virus-infected pigs and uninfected, control pigs. IFN-alpha
   positive cells showed phenotypes of both monocytes and plasmacytoid
   dendritic cells. The presence of IFN-alpha in PBMC was also confirmed by
   Western blotting. By immunoprecipitation, IFN-alpha was detected as 32
   and 55-57 kDa bands in PBMC of healthy SPF piglets. These samples were
   also IFN-gamma positive; the cytokine was revealed as 24, 37 and 54 kDa
   bands. The unusual molecular mass values of intracellular interferons
   were probably due to oligomerization, as previously described for human
   IFN-alpha. Swine intracellular IFN-alpha displayed the expected
   antiviral activity on bovine MDBK cells. The results indicate that
   interferons are constitutively expressed in swine leukocytes with
   peculiar molecular features. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The long-term protective immunity of an inactivated mineral-oil
   adjuvanted Mycoplasma agalactiae vaccine was evaluated in sheep. The
   antigen suspension was emulsified with a mixture of three mineral oils
   (Montanide ISA-563, Marcol-52, Montane-80 at the ratio of 30\%, 63\%,
   and 7\%, respectively). Twenty-two animals were divided in 2 groups (A
   and B) and immunised with two doses of the vaccine (group A, n = 14) or
   used as unvaccinated control (group B, n = 8). Five months after the
   second vaccination, seven animals of group A and four animals of group B
   were challenged by nasal route with M. agalactiae. The remaining seven
   vaccinated and four control animals were challenged intranasally eight
   months after vaccination. The vaccine was able to induce a
   full-protective immunity preventing the clinical signs of contagious
   agalactia and the infection by M. agalactiae in all groups of animals
   irrespective of the time of challenge after booster administration. (C)

Abstract = {This paper reports on the determination of toxin profile of mussels
   (Mytilus galloprovincialis) collected in November-December 2003 along
   the Emilia Romagna coasts (Italy) when a high concentration of
   Alexandrium ostenfeldii cells was detected in seawater. Detailed liquid
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analyses were performed on the
   crude extracts in both selected ion monitoring (SIM) and multiple
   reaction monitoring (MRM) modes. They revealed that M. galloprovincialis
   had accumulated the three major spirolides produced by the alga, namely
   13-desMethyl spirolide C, 13,19-didesMethyl spirolide C and
   27-hydroxy-13,19-didesMethyl spirolide C, which fully accounted for
   toxicity of lipophilic extracts shown in mouse bioassay. Interestingly,
   yessotoxin (YTX) and its analogues were still present in mussel polar
   extracts but YTX itself was not the major toxin contained in mussels.
   The presence of pectenotoxin-2 seco acid (PTX-2sa) and its putative
   epimer was also assessed. The presence of azaspiracids, never reported
   from the Adriatic sea, as well as of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning
   toxins (okadaic acid, dinophysistoxins and OA esters) and domoic acid,
   long known as contaminants of Adriatic mussels, was also investigated.

   The aim of this paper was to identify larger polymorphisms in goals and
   their potential applicability in a selection plan in Italy For this
   purpose. rile existing genetic data on modulating resistance to
   classical and atypical scrapie in goats in this country will be used as
   starting point
   Two Italian case-control studies concluded that the polymorphism at

   susceptibility of goats to classical scrapie Moreover, goats are
   Susceptible to all Unusual form of scrapie. named Nor98. and the H154
   mutation was shown to be statistically associated with this disease in
   goals in all Italian case-control study currently. a strategy based on
   killing goats carrying the H154 mutation is being applied to manage
   atypical scrape outbreaks in Italy
   The current Situation in Italy bodes well for the applicability of
   breeding plans based on the K222 mutation: data from independent Studies

Abstract = {Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is employed as a human vaccine
   vector for the high expression of heterologous genes and the lack of
   replication in mammalian cells. This study demonstrates that cells
   infected by recombinant viruses can be obtained by
   fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Recombinant viruses are generated
   by a swapping event between a red fluorescent protein gene in the
   acceptor virus and a plasmid cassette coding for both a green
   fluorescent marker and a transgene. To prevent the carry-over of
   parental virus, due to superinfection of the cells harbouring
   recombinant viruses, the sorting is performed on cells infected at low
   m.o.i. in the presence of a reversible inhibitor of viral particle
   release. Terminal dilution cloning is then used to isolate both green
   and marker-free recombinant viruses, which can be identified by
   whole-plate fluoroimaging. The differential visualization of all the
   viral types involved allows a stepwise monitoring of all recombinations
   and leads to a straightforward and efficient flow cytometry-based cell
   sorting purification protocol. As an example of the efficacy of this
   sorting procedure, the construction of rMVA's coding for the rat nuclear
   protein HMGB1 and H5N1 influenza A virus hemagglutinin is reported. The
   entire recombinant MVA production process is carried out in serum-free
   media employing primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF), which are
   certified for the preparation of human vaccines. This rMVA production
   method is faster, simpler and more reliable than any other available
   procedure for obtaining safe vaccine stocks for human use. (C) 2009

Abstract = {Recombinant canine coronaviruses, resembling the transmissible
   gastroenteritis virus of swine (TGEV) in a 5' fragment of the S
   glycoprotein, have been detected recently and showed to be present in
   canine populations. The 5'fragment of the S protein (S') of a TGEV-like
   canine coronavirus (MV), strain 174/06, was expressed in an Escherichia
   coli cell-free system. The purified recombinant polypeptide was employed
   to develop an ELISA test for the detection of TGEV-like CCoV-specific
   antibodies in dog sera. Four canine sera positive for TGEV-like CCoV,
   six sera positive to classical CCoV-II strains and 10 negative control
   sera were examined. The recombinant S' was not recognized by antibodies
   to classical CCoV-II, as only sera from dogs infected experimentally
   with TGEV-like CCoV reacted strongly with the recombinant S' polypeptide
   whereas dog sera with antibodies to classical CCoV-II did not react. As
   classical CCoV-II and TEGV-like CCoVs are related antigenically, the
   recombinant S' ELISA is a useful method to investigate serologically the
   prevalence of TGEV-like CCoVs in dogs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {A lateral flow device (LFD) for the detection of foot-and-mouth disease
   virus (FMDV) of the SAT2 serotype was developed using a monoclonal
   antibody (Mab 2H6). The performance of the LFD was evaluated in the
   laboratory on suspensions of vesicular epithelia: 305 positive for FMDV
   type SAT 2 from suspected cases of vesicular disease collected from 30
   countries and 1002 samples shown to be negative for FMDV type SAT 2
   collected from 67 countries between 1968 and 2008. The diagnostic
   sensitivity of the LFD for FMDV type SAT 2 was higher at 88\% compared
   to 79\% obtained by the reference method of antigen ELISA, and the
   diagnostic specificity of the LFD was approximately 99\% compared to
   100\% for the ELISA. The device recognized FMDV strains of wide
   diversity within the FMDV SAT 2 serotype and gave a superior performance
   for their detection compared to the 1F10 LFD which had been developed
   previously and shown to perform less well for the detection of FMDVs of
   this particular serotype. Reactions in the SAT 2 2H6 LFD with the
   viruses of other FMDV serotypes and swine vesicular disease (which
   produces a clinically indistinguishable syndrome in pigs), did not
   occur. These data illustrate the potential for the LFD to be employed to
   complement the 1F10 device next to the animal in the pen-side diagnosis
   of FMD, for providing rapid and objective support to veterinarians in
   their clinical judgment of the disease and for specific confirmation of
   a FMDV type SAT 2 infection. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   Staphylococcus epidermidis (16 2\% of positives and 8\% of total), and
   Staphylococcus aureus (13 5\% of positives and 67\% of total) Upon
   investigation of correlations existing among clinical signs and
   bacterial species responsible for the outbreak. S uberis showed a
   statistically significant correlation with serous appearance of milk,
   presence of clots in secretions, and reactivity of supramammary lymph
   nodes (p < 005). S epidermidis showed a statistically significant
   correlation with presence Of pustules and ulcers (p < 0.05); and S
   aureus showed a statistically significant correlation with clinical
   signs of chronic mastitis nodules. abscesses, and atrophy (p < 0 05\%)
   Manual milking techniques were more associated to Udder infections than
   mechanical milking However. an interesting correlation emerged between
   presence of S uberis and mechanical milking with small portable devices
   In conclusion, this study revealed interesting and unprecedented
   correlations among clinical signs, bacterial species isolated from
   infected milk. and farm management techniques The results reported here
   emphasize the primary role played by clinical practice in managing
   infectious ovine mastitis Outbreaks, and strengthen its relevance for
   recovery of affected flocks (C) 2009 Elsevier B V All rights reserved},

Abstract = {The cyanobacterial toxin cylindrospermopsin is rapidly spreading in the
   European temperate Countries. Cylindrospermopsin was detected for the
   first time in Italy in 2004; in this study, the presence of this toxin
   in Albano Lake (Central Italy) has been correlated to the cyanobacterial
   species Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and Aphanizomenon ovalisporum and
   their population dynamics. In 2004, these two species succeeded in the
   lake during spring, summer, and early autumn without overlapping,
   causing superficial blooms. Cylindrospermopsin was detected in lake
   samples by LC-MS/MS and ELISA immunoassay, showing extracellular
   superficial values ranging from 2.6 to 126 mu g/L, and water column
   values ranging from 0.41 to 18.4 mu g/L. Twenty-six of 30 positive water
   samples (86\%) exceeded the recommended limit of 1 mu g/L. Intracellular
   values up to 42.3 mu g/g were measured. Moreover, cylindrospermopsin was
   detected in tissues from two Salmo trutta trouts (up to 2.7 ng/g) and in
   a well for drinking water supply (1.6 mu g/L). For the first time, two
   cyanobacterial species producing cylindrospermopsin were detected in the
   same lake in Italy. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Environ Toxicol 2 :

Abstract = {The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence of total and
   pathogenic Vibrio parahaemolyticus strains in Italian mussels from
   different geographical areas of the Adriatic Sea and to determine their
   serotypes, toxigenic profiles and pandemic potential. Out of 559 samples
   analysed during 2007, 65 (11.6\%) were positive for V. parahaemolyticus.
   None of the isolates had the genes for thermostable direct haemolysin
   (tdh) and pandemic marker (toxRS), while five strains (7.7\%) had that
   for TDH-related haemolysin (trh). Regarding geographical location of the
   toxigenic strains, three were from the Adriatic coast of Puglia, one
   from Veneto, and one from the Marches. The trh-positive V.
   parahaemolyticus isolates from Puglia belonged to O1:KUT (2/3) and
   O1:K37(1/3) serotypes, the trh-positive isolate from the Marches to
   OUT(O untypeable):KUT serotype, and that from Veneto to O3:KUT. The
   prevalence of trh-positive V. parahaemolyticus obtained from mussels in
   this study was higher respect to that reported in previous studies from
   other European and Extraeuropean countries. The Health Authorities
   should be more aware of the epidemiological role of environmental V.
   parahaemolyticus in local foodborne diseases, and increase the microbial
   surveillance on these microorganisms isolated from shellfish.},

Abstract = {Standardized tools for typing Listeria monocytogenes isolates are
   required in epidemiological surveys investigating food-borne disease
   outbreaks and in the food-processing environment to identify the sources
   of contamination and routes by which the organisms are spread. In this
   survey Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) and Multi-Locus
   Sequence Typing (MLST) have been used to study 103 L monocytogenes
   isolates from food and environmental sources. A total of 62 AFLP types
   and 66 MLST Sequence Types were identified. AFLP and MLST produced
   similar results in terms of discriminating power. The Discrimination
   Index calculated for the two techniques was 0.976 for AFLP and 0.972 for
   MLST. These values were appreciably higher compared to serotyping
   (0.739). A good congruence was observed between AFLP and MLST. The
   present study demonstrated that AFLP and MLST subtyping are suitable
   tools for studying the epidemiology of L monocytogenes. The great
   advantage of MLST over AFLP and other molecular typing methods based on
   fragment fingerprinting lies in the unambiguity of sequence data while
   AFLP is less costly and highly processive. In conclusion the two methods
   can be perfectly integrated for high-resolution genotyping of L
   monocytogenes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {P>Fourteen case-control studies evaluating the importance of different
   risk factors for infection of humans with Toxoplasma gondii were
   identified. Surprisingly, up to two-thirds of infections could not be
   explained by risk factors such as consuming raw or undercooked meat or
   poor kitchen hygiene. Few studies reported population attributable risk,
   and when reported, it was low. Protocols including questionnaires used
   for collecting data, age and socio-economic groups studied, and sample
   sizes varied among studies. There is a need for carefully planned,
   case-control studies to identify sources of infection with T. gondii in
   humans. New risk factors, such as the manufacture of organic meat, and
   possible ways to sterilize meat to inactivate T. gondii tissue cysts are
   discussed.},

Title = {Olfactory system involvement in natural scrapie disease},
Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {21-32},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The olfactory system (OS) involvement in transmissible spongiform
   encephalopathies has lately been acknowledged in experimental studies:
   prion spread to the nasal mucosa is known to occur in hamsters after
   intracerebral challenge, and olfactory neurons have been assessed as a
   route for prion neuroinvasion too.
   This study investigated whether the OS is involved in naturally
   occurring prion diseases. Samples of nasal mucosa taken at the level of
   medial nasal concha, ventral nasal concha and nasal septum from 24
   natural scrapie affected sheep were examined by immunohistochemistry
   (IHC), immunofluorescence (IF), PET blot and Western Blot (WB) for
   scrapie prion protein (PrPSc). OS related brain areas of the selected
   sheep (olfactory bulb, olfactory tract, frontal cortex, pyriform lobe
   and hippocampus) were analyzed too.
   Prion spread was assessed both in peripheral and central OS of the
   examined sheep. Twenty one samples of olfactory mucosa were positive by
   WB; IHC confirmed WB positive results in 14 cases. PrPSc was mainly
   localized in the medial nasal concha at the level of the olfactory nerve
   perineurium, and it was also disclosed in the nasal associated lymphoid
   tissue. It was never detected in olfactory neurons and fibers. In the
   brain PrPSc staining intensity was higher in olfactory bulb and frontal
   cortex, where it appeared as submeningeal, subependymal and perivascular
   patterns.
   The finding of PrPSc both in the brain areas directly in contact to the
   cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in the olfactory nerve perineurium
   bounding the subdural space extension that surrounds nerve rootlets
   might be consistent with the recently discovered PrPSc presence in CSF.},

Abstract = {Naive sea bass juveniles (38.4 +/- 4.5 g) were intramuscularly infected
   with a sublethal dose of betanodavirus isolate 378/103, followed after
   43 days by a similar boosting. This infection resulted in an overall
   mortality of 7.6\%. At various intervals, sampling of fish tissues was
   performed to investigate: i) B and T lymphocyte content in organs and
   tissues; ii), proliferation of leucocytes re-stimulated in vitro with
   inactivated virus; iii) presence of serum antibody specific for
   betanodavirus; iv) expression of genes coding for the following
   immunoregulatory molecules involved in innate and acquired responses:
   type I IFN, Mx, IL-1, Cox-2; IL-10, TGF-beta, TCR beta, CD4, CD8 alpha,
   IgM, by using a quantitative PCR array system developed for sea bass.
   The obtained results showed a detectable increase of T cells and B cells
   in PBL during betanodavirus infection. Furthermore, leucocytes obtained
   from blood, head kidney, and gills showed a detectable ``in vitro{''}
   increase in viability upon addition of inactivated viral particles, as
   determined by measuring intracellular ATP concentration. ELISA analysis
   of sera showed that exposure to nodavirus induced a low, but specific
   antibody titer measured 43 days after infection, despite the presence of
   measurable levels of natural antibody. Finally, a strong upregulation of
   genes coding for type I IFN, Mx, and IgM was identified after both
   infection and boosting. interestingly, an upregulation of Cox-2 until
   boosting, and of TGF-beta and IL-10 after boosting was also observed,
   while the other tested genes did not show any significant variations
   with respect to mock-treated fish. Overall, our work represents a first
   comprehensive analysis of cellular and molecular immune parameters in a
   fish species exposed to a pathogenic virus. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) is a contagious enteric disease of pigs
   caused by a coronavirus. A double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) based on the use of monoclonal
   antibodies was developed for the detection of porcine epidemic diarrhoea
   virus (PEDV). The DAS-ELISA was compared with RT-PCR in the examination
   of 506 specimens collected during 2006-2007 from pigs originating from
   different farms located in the Po valley. Both faecal samples obtained
   directly from the rectum of live animals showing clinical signs and
   intestinal samples collected from the caecum of deceased pigs were
   included in the study. The correlation between the two methods was
   higher when testing faecal samples (K=0.97, 95\% CI: 0.94-1.00) than
   testing intestinal samples (K=0.62, 95\% CI: 0.35-0.89). The use of
   ELISA technology provided an efficient and effective mean of evaluating
   the presence of coronavirus PED antigen in field samples and indicates
   that this procedure is a very useful tool in epidemiological studies.

Abstract = {Anthrax is a non-contagious disease, known since ancient times. However,
   it became a matter of global public interest after the bioterrorist
   attacks in the U.S.A. during the autumn of 2001. The concern of
   politicians and civil authorities everywhere towards this emergency
   necessitated a significant research effort and the prevention of new
   bioterrorist acts. Anthrax is primarily a disease that affects livestock
   and wildlife; its distribution is worldwide; and it can represent a
   danger to humans but especially more so when it occurs in areas
   considered to be free and in atypical seasons and climatic conditions.
   The atypicality of the phenomenon may lead health workers to misdiagnose
   and, consequently, an inappropriately manage of affected carcasses with
   a consequent and inevitable increase in the risk of human infection.
   This article emphasises the importance of paying increasing attention to
   this zoonosis. The biggest risk is its underestimation. (C) 2009

Abstract = {In cattle fattening, the illicit use of growth promoters (GPs)
   represents a major problem. The synthetic corticosteroid dexamethasone
   (DEX) is the GP mostly used, alone or in combination with other steroids
   or beta-agonists. Recently, GPs were shown to disrupt some cattle
   cytochromes P450 (CYPs) at the post-transcriptional level; therefore,
   the effects of two illicit protocols containing DEX (alone or together
   with 17 beta-estradiol, 17 beta E) upon main cattle liver drug
   metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) mRNAs and related transcription factors were
   investigated by quantitative real time RTPCR. Eleven genes, out of the
   18 considered, were significantly modulated by GPs.
   Corticosteroid-responsive genes did not respond univocally, whereas
   retinoic X receptor alpha (RXR alpha) and estrogen receptor alpha (ER
   alpha) were upregulated depending on the illicit protocol used.
   Nowadays, an increasing interest has been noticed toward the detection
   of biomarkers of response (BMRs) to be used in the screening of GPs
   misuse in cattle farming. In the present study, CYP2B6-like, CYP2E1,
   glutathione S-transferase A1- and sulfatransferase A1-like (GSTA1- and
   SULT1A1-like) mRNAs were significantly modulated regardless of the GP,
   the illicit protocol, and the animal breed, representing promising BMRs.
   The usefulness of,these BMRs needs to be characterized more in depth.},

Abstract = {The prevalence of Salmonella associated mortality at hatching was
   investigated in three hatcheries in Jos, central Nigeria. Their
   susceptibility to antimicrobial agents was also evaluated. S. Kentucky
   and S. Hadar were isolated. While half of the isolates were from
   internal organs, 26.7\% came from meconial swabs of dead-in-shell
   embryos, 17.8\% from intestinal samples and 4.4\% from egg shells. S.
   Hadar is known to colonise only the gut and is classified as
   non-invasive, but in this study 82\% were obtained from internal organs
   which suggests that infections with this serotype may also cause
   invasive disease. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed a high
   prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in the study area with complete
   resistance to gentamycin, enrofloxacin, nalidixic acid, tetracycline and
   streptomycin and substantial resistance to triple sulphur and
   ciprofloxacin. Six multiple resistance profiles were recorded with a
   high level of multiple resistance to quinolones. Quinolone resistance
   has implications for veterinary and human therapy as their misuse in
   poultry could lead to the emergence of resistant animal and zoonotic
   pathogens. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Volume = {88},

Abstract = {Scrapie is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy affecting the
   central nervous system in sheep. The key event in such neurodegeneration
   is the conversion of the normal prion protein (PrPC) into the
   pathological isoform (PrPSc). Misfolded prion proteins are normally
   degraded by the proteasome. This work, analyzing models of scrapie
   disease, describes the in vivo relationship between the proteasome and
   prions. We report that the disease is associated with an increase of
   proteasome functionality, most likely as a means of counteracting the
   increased levels of oxidative stress. Here, we show that prions
   coprecipitate with the 20S proteasome and that they colocalize within
   the same neuron, thus raising the possibility that PrP interacts with
   the proteasome in both normal and diseased brain, affecting substrate
   trafficking and proteasome functionality. This interaction, inducing
   proteasome activation, leads to different neuronal alterations and
   triggers apoptosis. Furthermore, testing the effects of isolated PrPC on
   purified 20S proteasomes, we obtain a concentration- and proteasome
   composition-dependent decrease in the complex activity. (C) 2009

Abstract = {The study was designed to evaluate the effects of solids in suspension
   in seawater on clams (Chamelea gallina). The aim was to investigate the
   possible correlation between the widespread deaths of clams in the
   coastal waters of the central and northern Adriatic in the last five
   years and increased concentrations of solids in suspension. The research
   involved conducting 96-hour tests on clams farmed in aquariums
   containing filtered seawater. The tests were preceded by a 7-day
   adaptation stage to allow the molluscs to acclimatise. During this
   period, the clams were fed on unicellular seaweed (Dunaliella
   tertiolecta). The molluscs were exposed to particles of solids in
   suspension consisting of pools of silica gel (SiO2) granules of various
   sizes, similar to those constituting silt, whose presence and suspension
   in the sea considerably increase after heavy rain and heavy seas. The
   study established that the number of deaths caused by solids suspended
   in seawater at the concentrations used in the tests was not
   statistically significant.},

Abstract = {A polymerase chain reaction protocol consisting of a multiplex to
   identify the cpa, cpb1, cpetx, cpi genes and a duplex to identify the
   cpe and cpb2 genes encoding for alpha, beta 1, epsilon, iota,
   enterotoxin and beta 2 toxins, respectively, was applied to DNA
   extracted from two collections of Clostridium perfringens strains. The
   first collection involved 19 isolates from rabbits. The second
   collection of 41 isolates came from routine necropsies. The cpa gene
   alone, or in association with the cpb2 gene, was detected in all DNA
   samples examined. The cpa gene, together with cpb2 gene, were detected
   in seven of the rabbit C. perfringens strains (36.8\%) and in nine
   isolates from necropsies (21.9\%). The cpa gene was found in 63.2\% of
   rabbit strains and 76.9\% of strains from other animal species. In
   rabbits, the pathological lesions associated with C. perfringens
   detection were predominantly forms of non-inflammatory enteropathies. In
   other species, C. perfringens was mainly associated with
   congestive-haemorrhagic enteropathy, but also with fatal traumatic
   lesions, degenerative diseases and organs with post-mortem autolysis. No
   clear correlation was observed between detection of beta 2 toxin gene
   and species-specific pathological features.},

Title = {A proof-of-principle study to identify suitable vaccine seed candidates
   to combat introductions of Eurasian lineage H5 and H7 subtype avian
   influenza viruses},
Journal = {AVIAN PATHOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {39},

Pages = {375-382},
Abstract = {Vaccination against avian influenza (AI) is now included amongst the
   prevention and control measures recommended by international animal
   health organizations to combat the disease in poultry. For optimal
   control of human influenza infections, the antigenic variability within
   subtypes requires the annual update of seed strains for inclusion in
   vaccines. The decisions taken are based on serological cross-reactivity
   of viral strains measured by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests.
   The reason for this is to ensure that the vaccine contains strains that
   are related antigenically to the current circulating field strain as
   field viruses evolve or are substituted by variants of distinct
   antigenicity. Such an annual approach is not viable economically for the
   poultry industry. In the current study, we have applied a similar
   HI-based approach to demonstrate, as proof of principle, that
   cross-reactive strains can be identified. Applying the same approach
   used by the World Health Organization to investigate antigenic
   differences among human influenza viruses, we assessed the serological
   cross-reactivity of a selection of natural H5 and H7 subtype viruses.
   Analysing HI data, we have identified strains that are cross-reactive
   and may have the potential to act as seed viruses for future vaccine
   development. This study should be considered a starting point for a more
   informed approach to the selection of seed strains for the development
   of avian influenza vaccines against field infections caused by viruses
   of H5 and H7 subtypes.},

Abstract = {The result of a 12 months project for a unified conversion line of

   (15) applied both, the reference method (ISO 4833:2003) and Bactoscan FC
   analysis on almost 100 cow's raw milk samples. After a first evaluation
   of the results of each laboratory for an individual conversion line, we
   chose a Linear Mixed Effects Model, for the statistical evaluation of
   1474 ``valid samples{''} (statistical selection of samples concerned
   repeatability of Bactoscan, dilution factor, maximum and minimum number
   of colonies on the plates). The regression line we obtained is: Log(10)
   ( UFC/mL) = Log(10) (IBC/mu L) x 0.911 + 2,599 with (Sy/x) = 0.279.
   During 2010 some Italian laboratories will start to use the unified
   conversion line. With a progressive increase of the number of
   laboratories using the unified conversion line, we hope to improve (not
   to solve ... ) the problem of reproducibility of the instrumental method

Abstract = {Infectious Hematopoietic Necrosis (IHN) and Viral Haemorrhagic
   Septicaemia (VHS) are two systemic infections affecting several species
   of salmonid fish; Reporting of these diseases is mandatory in accordance
   with Directive 67/1991 EC. In order to obtain and preserve the free
   status at farm level, the Italian legislation (D.L.vo 148/2008) adopted
   a surveillance program for all freshwater farms of salmonid fish used
   for repopulation in public water.
   This study was designed to provide data on the descriptive epidemiology
   of IHN and VHS in the Piedmont region when the surveillance program was
   extended to all fish farms.
   The progress of the diseases was described year by year, by geographical
   area and by species. Moreover unvariate and multivariate analysis were
   used to test the potential role of a number of farm characteristics.
   Rainbow trout was the only salmonid fish species found infected; IHN and
   VHS are present with a very low overall prevalence, less than 10\%. The
   study of the main potential risk factors did not allow the
   identification of any statistical association.
   These results are a starting point for future investigations on risk

Title = {Monoclonal antibodies against human CD34 antigens do not cross-react
   with ovine umbilical cord blood cells},
Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {26-28},
Abstract = {CD34 is a cell surface glycoprotein expressed by hematopoietic
   progenitors and endothelial cells. It is widely used in the clinic for
   isolation of human hematopoietic stem cells. In recent years large
   animals are gaining increasing importance in biomedical research for the
   study and therapy of human diseases. Sheep has proved to be an useful
   experimental model for preclinical trials in transplantation procedures.
   Unfortunately, the lack of specie-specific monoclonal antibodies (MABS)
   recognizing hemopoietic progenitor cells hampers the use of this animal
   in experimental hematology. The aim of this paper was to determine
   whether commercial monoclonal antibodies specific for human CD34
   molecule could cross-react with hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC)
   present in sheep umbilical cord blood (UCB). Six antihuman CD34 MABS,
   recognizing the three different epitope classes, were tested in flow
   cytometry on purified mononuclear cells (MNC) isolated from cord blood
   of both species. None of the MABS used in this trial seemed to be able
   to identify HPC from sheep UCB. These data suggest that the panel of
   monoclonal antibodies used for cross reactivity detection has to be
   expanded with recently produced reagents. Further studies should be
   directed towards the production of ovine specific anti CD34 MABS.},

Abstract = {Approximately 250 000 water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) live in the
   Campania region of southern Italy where the breeding of this species is
   very popular. Of these animals, almost 150 000 are concentrated in the
   Caserta province where the prevalence of Brucella abortus in this
   species represents approximately 20\% at herd level. The Italian
   brucellosis eradication programme provides a slaughter and vaccination
   strategy for this province. B. abortus strain RB51 (RB51) has become the
   official vaccine for the prevention of brucellosis in cattle in several
   countries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of RB51 in
   water buffalo compared to the B. abortus S19 vaccine (S19). The study
   was performed in accordance with a protocol described in mice. Female
   buffalo aged five months were inoculated. Five received a RB51 dosage on
   two occasions that was three times greater than that approved for use in
   cattle and a booster after one month, five received B. abortus S19
   vaccine at the standard dosage and three controls received a phosphate
   buffer solution. Buffalo were then challenged with a virulent B. abortus
   strain 544 thirty days post vaccination. Antibodies that developed in
   the five animals vaccinated with RB51 were not detected by the Rose
   Bengal test or complement fixation test (CFT) and were also tested by
   CFT prepared with RB51 antigen. After culling, B. abortus was cultured
   from the spleen, retropharyngeal and supra-mammary lymph nodes. A
   statistical evaluation was performed to assess the immunogenicity values
   obtained in buffalo vaccinated with 519, compared to those obtained in
   buffalo vaccinated with the RB51 vaccine and in the unvaccinated control
   group.},

Abstract = {Influenza A virus isolation is undertaken routinely in embryonated
   chicken eggs, but to improve virus detection various cell lines can be
   used. The CACO-2 cell line was compared to the MDCK cell line and
   embryonated chicken eggs for the isolation of H1N1, H1N2, H3N2 swine
   influenza A virus subtypes from clinical specimens.
   From 2006 to 2008, 104 influenza A samples found positive by PCR from 42
   respiratory outbreaks in Italian swine farms were examined by virus
   isolation. Sixty swine influenza A viruses were isolated (16 H1N1, 28
   H1N2 and 16 H3N2) and their growth behaviour on the different substrates
   was examined. 16/16 H1N1, 28/28 H1N2 and 8/16 of H3N2 viruses were
   isolated from the CACO-2 cell line, while 7/16 H1N1, 3/28 H1N2 and 16/16
   H3N2 viruses were isolated using embryonated chicken eggs. Only 9/16
   H1N1, 1/28 H1N2 and 6/16 H3N2 viruses replicated in MDCK cells. A link
   was found between viral hemagglutinin and the isolation rate on the
   various substrates. The CACO-2 line was statistically more sensitive
   (Fisher's exact test, p < 0.01) compared to the MDCK cells and
   embryonated chicken eggs for the isolation of H1N1 and H1N2 subtypes. In
   contrast influenza A H3N2 virus was isolated more readily in embryonated
   chicken eggs than in cultured cells (Fisher's exact test, p < 0.01). (C)

Abstract = {Two young dogs belonging to the same kennel placed nearby Treviso
   (north-eastern Italy) died at the end of 2008 with clinical signs of
   renal failure. They were subjected to necropsy and were evaluated for
   histopathological and toxicological changes. Both the animals had same
   clinical signs and laboratory evidence of uremia. Post mortem
   investigations revealed severe nephrotoxicosis, associated with uroliths
   deposition within renal tubules and pelvis. The predominant crystal type
   was identical to those observed in the kidneys of animals involved in
   the 2004 and 2007 melamine-associated renal failure epidemic in Asia and
   US, providing evidence that they share the same causative agent. High
   doses of melamine were detected in the pet food administered to the
   dogs, likewise melamine was identified in renal tissue from one dead dog
   and in urine samples from both the animals. Therefore, a diagnosis of
   melamine-related nephrotoxicosis was made. To the author's knowledge
   this is the first report about melamine contamination of pet food from
   EU.},

Abstract = {The alpha s2 casein, encoded by the CSN1S2 gene, is one of the three
   Calcium sensitive caseins present in the milk of ruminants of
   zootechnical interest and in the milk of Equidae species (horse and
   donkey). In the present study, we cloned, sequenced and analysed two
   different donkey CSN1S2 cDNAs that we called CSN1S2 I and CSN1S2 II. The
   first, which spans over a fragment of 1016 nt, is constituted by 19
   exons and encodes for a predicted protein (called alpha s2-I) of 221
   aminoacids; the second, of which we determined the entire sequence (16
   exons), encodes for a predicted peptide (called alpha s2-II) of 168
   aminoacids. Alternative splicing and genetic markers are reported for
   both genes.},

Abstract = {Methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS) were isolated from nasal swabs
   of 56 of 159 (35.2\%; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 27.9-43.2\%)
   healthy horses. Two nasal swabs were collected from each horse; 43 of
   159 (27\%; 95\% CI: 20.5-34.8\%) of the cohort were colonized by MRS
   strains in 1 nostril, while in the remaining 13 of 159 (8.2\%; 95\% CI:
   4.6-13.9\%), different or identical MRS strains were isolated in both
   nostrils. Of the 29 humans in close contact with the horses tested, 4
   (13.8\%; 95\% CI: 4.5-32.6\%) were found to be carriers of MRS. All
   isolates were coagulase negative with the exception of 2
   coagulase-positive MRS strains, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus
   pseudintermedius, both isolated from horses. To assay the methicillin
   resistance, a susceptibility test to oxacillin with standardized disk
   diffusion method, a PBP-2a latex agglutination test, and a methicillin
   resistance gene (mecA) polymerase chain reaction assay were performed.
   Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns of isolates from horses and
   humans in close contact with the horses revealed similarity. The results
   suggest evidence of transmission between animals, from animals to
   humans, and vice versa.},

Abstract = {In 2008, after the crisis of buffalo dairy fields in Campania, Italy, an
   assessment of the contamination of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and
   polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and dioxin-like polychlorinated
   biphenyls (dl-PCBs) was also necessary for other animal species bred in
   the region. The contents of PCDDs, polychlorinated dibenzofurans
   (PCDFs), and dl-PCBs were determined by high-resolution gas
   chromatography/mass spectrometry (HR-GC/MS) (according to USEPA method
   1613) in 69 sheep and goat milk samples from 63 farms. In eleven samples
   from six sheep farms, the PCDD/Fs levels exceeded the maximum limit of
   3.0 pg g(-1) fat established by the European Commission, in particular
   the concentrations ranged between 3.89 and 12.90 pg g(-1) fat.
   Statistical treatment of the results for the congener profiles of the
   non-compliant and compliant samples has been used to identify the
   sources of contamination.},

Abstract = {Anthrax is a disease of humans and animals caused by the encapsulated,
   spore-forming Bacillus anthracis. In Italy, anthrax is normally a
   sporadic disease. During the summer 2004, anthrax broke out in the
   Basilicata, in southern Italy a region with a low prevalence of anthrax
   in which vaccination had been suspended since 1998. The disease involved
   several animals in few weeks and in a large area. Over 41 days, 81
   cattle died, as well as 15 sheep, 9 goats, I I horses and 8 deer. The
   Multiple-locus Variable-Number Tandem Repeats Analysis (MLVA) showed
   that all the 53 isolates belonged to the Cluster A I a, genotype 1. The
   results of the Single Nucleotide Repeats (SNRs) Analysis showed that
   48/53 B.anthacis strains belonged to a single clonal lineage, the
   sub-genotype sgt - eB. Two sporadic mutants, sgt - eB,m1 and sgt -
   eB,m2, were isolated, only one managing to infect other herds. Factors
   that could have contributed to the spread of infection, such as the
   transmission of spores by insect vectors and the favourable weather
   conditions were evaluated.},

Abstract = {A study on the influence of gastrointestinal trichostrongyles on ram
   fertility was performed. Two groups of semen donor rams (Sarda breed)
   were utilized; one was experimentally infected with Haemonchus
   contortus, Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Teladorsagia circumcincta
   and the other was used as a control group. In all animals, coprological,
   haematological and reproductive parameters were studied. The results
   suggest that the parasites had a limited effect with some changes in
   phosphorus, cholesterol and chlorine levels. In our experience the
   parasitic burden produced no significant change on ram fertility.},

Abstract = {To investigate the percentage reactor animals to SCCIT in sheep and goat
   the present study was carried out by using bovine and avian PPDs at 7
   Livestock Experiment Stations of Punjab and villages around two cities.
   The overall percentage of reactor animals to SCCIT at farms in sheep and
   goat was 0.9\% and 2.4\%, while it was 0.4\% and 0.0\% around two
   cities, respectively. Hundred percent of goat and 86\% of sheep farms
   under study had positive reactor animals. The reactor animals to SCCIT
   around two cities were 0\% in goat and 0.4\% in sheep. Goats (P<0.05)
   and sheep (P<0.001) kept with large ruminants at farms had higher
   percentage of reactor animals. Age showed significant (P<0.01)
   association with tuberculosis in sheep and goat. in goats of more than 6
   years of age, the reactor animals to SCCIT were 5, 8 and 11 times higher
   than goats of 4.1-6, 3-4 and <3 years of age. The reactor animals were
   significantly (P<0.05) higher in goats of <30 kg (3.5\%) and >40 kg
   (3.5\%) body weights, while these were less in goats weighing between 30
   and 40 kg (1.5\%). Sheep and goat breeds showed significant (P<0.001;
   P<0.05) difference in percentage of reactor animals to SCCIT. Beetal
   (3.9\%) and Teddy breeds (2.9\%) had 3.3 and 2.4 times higher
   percentages of reactor animals to SCCIT as compared to Pak-Angora
   (1.2\%) breed. However, no animal of Nachhi and Dera Din Pinah breeds
   showed positive reaction to PPDs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The diagnostic accuracy of tuberculosis can be enhanced by new tests
   like gamma interferon used in conjunction with tuberculin test but these
   tests are quite expensive to be conducted on all animals in resource
   poor countries. The present study was conducted to clarify the
   usefulness of haematological parameters and changes in serum proteins
   along with tuberculin test in different animal species. In buffaloes,
   significantly lower RBC count, WBC count, Hb concentration, neutrophils
   and eosinophils while significantly higher monocytes percentage along
   with serum total proteins, albumin and globulins were observed in
   tuberculin positive reactors. In cattle, significantly lower RBC count,
   PCV, neutrophils and serum albumin, while lymphocyte percentage was
   significantly higher in positive reactor animals. In sheep, PCV was
   lower in positive reactors. In goats, basophils percentage was
   significantly higher (P = 0.002) in positive reactors. A significant
   positive correlation of Hb with RBC and PCV in positive reactor
   buffaloes, goats and sheep was observed. The correlation statistics for
   differential leukocyte percentage did not differ between positive and
   negative reactor animals of these species. In cattle and goats, albumin
   showed significant positive correlation with globulins in negatively
   reacting animals, while this correlation was non-significant in positive
   reactor animals. In buffaloes, albumin showed a significant positive
   correlation with globulins and this correlation was non-significant in
   negative reactor buffaloes. It was concluded that tuberculosis caused
   decrease in erythrocyte parameters including RBC count, PCV and Hb
   concentration, while it caused an increase in monocytes, eosinophils and
   lymphocytes. (C) 2010 PVJ. All rights reserved},

Abstract = {A new approach to define education tools for public health communication
   was set up by the Veneto Region since 2008, in collaboration with the
   Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie, in order to
   implement a network of expertise and knowledge that could be useful for
   the citizens. Actions were planned in order to increase people's
   knowledge adults and school-aged children of food risks and nutritional
   aspects of products, to promote correct food practices, and to encourage
   healthy lifestyle, through effective messages to consumers. Training
   programmes and information interventions in which safety food and
   nutrition topics were aptly illustrated also with practical labs, were
   performed by public health operators and nutritionists, for adult
   consumers by means of public seminars held in all the Provinces of the
   Veneto Region. Primary and middle schools were involved in workshops in
   which teachers and students designed media products on food safety and
   nutrition. Workshops were conducted by the staff of the Department of
   Education Sciences of University of Padua. Finally, a website -
   www.alimentinsalute.it - was created for the complete availability of
   the information and to gather all the experiences. This website was
   intended as a meeting place for consumers to interact to each other, as
   well as a trust-building place to strengthen the public health
   information policies for consumers. Actions and training programmes made
   participants either more aware of food safety and more responsive to
   alimentary behaviours, through an enduring strategy tailored to the
   consumer and his needs. The project will continue through 2011.},

   mg L-1 of Chlor, respectively. Pot cultivation was performed outdoor
   (Oxy in the range 62.5-1000 ng g(-1) dry soil) and plants harvested
   after 45 days. Tetracyclines analyses on soils and on field plants
   (roots, stalks, and leaves) did not determine the appreciable presence
   of tetracyclines. Residues were found in the 45-day pot corn only, in
   the range of 1-50 ng g(-1) for Oxy in roots, accounting for a 5\%
   carry-over rate, on average. Although no detectable residues in plants
   from on land cultivations, both experimental batches showed the same
   biphasic growth form corresponding to a dose/response hormetic curve.

Abstract = {Helminth parasites of woodmouse Apodemus sylvaticus were studied from
   May 1993 through to June 1994 on the River Avena (Calabria, southern
   Italy), which, as other Mediterranenan rivers, is dry for most of the
   year. Trapping sites were located in three different habitats of the
   river: slopes, shores and the riverbed. A total of 106 animals was
   captured and screened for the presence of helminths. Five endoparasitic
   species were detected: Corrigia villa, Rictularia proni, Heligmosomoides
   polygyrus, Syphacia stroma and S. frederici. Four helminth species were
   recorded from the riverbed and shore sections, whereas only H. polygyrus
   and S. frederici were found on the slopes. Syphacia frederici occurred
   at every trapping site. The total prevalence was 25.5\% and total mean
   intensity was 27.2 parasites/mouse. No statistical significant
   difference was found for both the prevalence and mean intensity of
   infection between either habitats or sexes, suggesting that, from the
   point of view of the helminth community, the study area should be

Abstract = {Proliferative and necrotizing pneumonia (PNP) is a form of interstitial
   pneumonia that occurs in weaning and post-weaning pigs. PNP is
   characterized by hypertrophy and hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes and
   coagulative necrosis and granular debris within alveolar spaces.
   Canadian and European studies suggest that the porcine reproductive and
   respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2)
   are the main causes of the disease, but Aujezsky's disease virus (ADV)
   and swine influenza virus (SIV) have also been considered as potential
   aetiological agents. An immunohistochemical study was carried out on the
   lungs of 28 Italian pigs with PNP in order to evaluate the role of
   PRRSV, PCV2 and ADV in PNP lesions. PRRSV infection was identified in
   the lungs of 11 pigs, PCV2 in the lungs of four pigs and coinfection
   with both viruses in the lungs of eight pigs. Neither virus was detected
   in the lungs of the remaining five pigs. ADV antigen was not detected in
   any sample. The principle aetiological agent of PNP in Italy therefore
   appears to be PRRSV. Coinfection with PRRSV and PCV2 is characterized by
   more severe microscopical changes in affected lungs. (C) 2009 Published

Title = {Does a benign calicivirus reduce the effectiveness of rabbit
   haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) in Australia? Experimental evidence
   from field releases of RHDV on bait},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {37},
Number = {4},
Pages = {311-319},
Abstract = {Context. European rabbits are serious environmental and agricultural
   pests throughout their range in Australia. Rabbit haemorrhagic disease
   virus (RHDV) greatly reduced rabbit numbers in arid central Australia
   but had less impact in cooler, higher-rainfall areas. RHDV-like benign
   caliciviruses (bCVs) have been implicated in limiting the impact of RHDV
   in the higher-rainfall regions of Australia and also in Europe.
   Aims. Experimental releases of RHDV on bait were tested as a means of
   initiating disease outbreaks. Serological evidence of antibodies to bCVs
   was examined to determine whether they reduce mortality rates and/or
   spread of the released RHDV, and how that might influence the
   effectiveness of future RHDV releases for rabbit management.
   Methods. Four experimental releases were conducted in high-rainfall and
   coastal regions of southern Australia. Virus activity was implied from
   recapture rates and serological changes in marked rabbits, and genetic
   sequencing of virus recovered from dead rabbits. Changes in rabbit
   abundance were estimated from spotlight transect counts.
   Key results. Release of RHDV on bait produced disease outbreaks that
   challenged almost all animals within the general release area and spread
   up to 4 km beyond the release sites. Recapture rates were high in marked
   rabbits that possessed antibodies from previous exposure to RHDV and
   extremely low amongst rabbits that lacked any detectable antibodies.
   Rabbits carrying antibodies classified as being due to previous
   infection with bCVs had recapture rates that were dependent on
   circulating antibody titre and were similar to 55\% of recapture rates
   in rabbits with clear antibodies to RHDV.
   Conclusions. This is the first quantified evidence that antibodies
   produced against bCVs provide significant protection against RHD
   outbreaks in field populations of rabbits.
   Implications. bCVs can greatly reduce the impact of RHDV on wild-rabbit
   populations in Australia and presumably elsewhere. RHDV can be
   effectively released on bait although further releases are likely to be
   of minor or inconsistent benefit for controlling rabbit numbers where
   bCVs are common.},

Abstract = {In this study, 19 chickens were experimentally infected by Leishmania
   infantum and tissue samples, collected at different times, were cultured
   and subjected to conventional PCR and/or real time PCR (qPCR) to assess
   their susceptibility to infection. In addition, 121 serum samples from
   rural chickens (n = 73) and backyard birds (n = 48) were tested for
   anti-L. infantum antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence test. All the
   19 animals showed to be molecularly positive at least at one tissue
   sample. In particular, 26 tissue samples from the experimentally
   infected chickens were positive on conventional PCR and/or qPCR but no
   clinical signs or seroconversion were detected and all tissue cultures
   were negative. Accordingly, all serum samples from rural chickens were
   negative whereas four (8.4\%) from game birds (three Anser anser and one
   Phasianus colchicus) were positive. These results indicate that chickens
   are not suitable hosts for L. infantum under experimental condition. The
   occurrence of anti-L. infantum antibodies in domestic gooses (A. onset)
   and in a pheasant (P. colchicus) points out their possible role in the
   epidemiology of visceral leishmaniasis. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Common sole (Solea solea) is one of the most interesting species for
   diversification of aquaculture production in the Mediterranean area, but
   production of sole on an industrial scale has not yet begun. In the
   present study, larval rearing was performed in 1 cubic meter tanks with
   a re-circulating system, using the ``green water{''} technique. After an
   initial mortality occurred during the first 10 days of larval rearing,
   no particular mortality was registered during weaning period until 69
   dph (day post hatching). On 66 dph, because of technical problems, fish
   were transferred in a new tank with open system where temperature
   control was not possible and water temperature increased from 19 degrees
   C to 24 degrees C in three days. Four days later and for the following
   ten days we registered a mortality rate of 84.5\%. Microbiological
   analysis revealed the absence of Betanodavirus and the presence of
   Vibrio anguillarum O2 and of Tenacibaculum maritimum; the former
   represents the first isolation on common sole in Italy. Histology
   revealed necrotic-haemorrhagic lesions in brain, kidney and gut, and
   severe skin erosions, the latter especially on fish collected at the end
   of the outbreak. Moreover the pathogens have been detected by
   immunohistochemistry (IHC). This severe mortality could be interpreted
   as a multi-factorial event where post-weaning weakness, manipulation,
   higher temperature and pathogens could have had a synergic effect. The
   extreme stress susceptibility of S. solea, pointed out in this and
   previous papers is discussed.},

   species},
Journal = {AVIAN PATHOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {39},
Number = {5},
Pages = {391-398},
Abstract = {A rapid fowl adenovirus (FAdV) classification method based on a 30-bp
   sequence of the hexon loop (L1) was developed using the pyrosequencing
   technique. FAdV identification is relevant for epidemiological studies
   and for the adoption of a correct strategy where vaccination is to be
   used for the control of the disease. FAdV typing is usually performed
   using polymerase chain reaction coupled with either conventional DNA
   sequencing or restriction enzyme analysis; however, both methods can be
   time consuming and/or very expensive to be used as a routine tool. In
   the present study, polymerase chain reaction and subsequent pyrosequence
   analysis of the variable hexon L1 region were assessed in order to
   rapidly differentiate FAdV species. Forty-nine FAdV samples (22
   reference strains and 27 field isolates) were tested and the results
   were compared with those obtained by conventional DNA sequencing. The

Abstract = {Implementation of the Gibbs sampler for estimating the accuracy of
   multiple binary diagnostic tests in one population has been
   investigated. This method, proposed by Joseph, Gyorkos and Coupal, makes
   use of a Bayesian approach and is used in the absence of a gold standard
   to estimate the prevalence, the sensitivity and specificity of medical
   diagnostic tests. The expressions that allow this method to be
   implemented for an arbitrary number of tests are given. By using the
   convergence diagnostics procedure of Raftery and Lewis, the relation
   between the number of iterations of Gibbs sampling and the precision of
   the estimated quantiles of the posterior distributions is derived. An
   example concerning a data set of gastro-esophageal reflux disease
   patients collected to evaluate the accuracy of the water siphon test
   compared with 24h pH-monitoring, endoscopy and histology tests is
   presented. The main message that emerges from our analysis is that
   implementation of the Gibbs sampler to estimate the parameters of
   multiple binary diagnostic tests can be critical and convergence
   diagnostic is advised for this method. The factors which affect the
   convergence of the chains to the posterior distributions and those that
   influence the precision of their quantiles are analyzed.},

Abstract = {Mycobacterium marinum is the causative agent of mycobacteriosis in wild
   and cultured fish and of atypical infection in humans. For the diagnosis
   of M. marinum, cultural and traditional polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
   methods are currently used. However, these protocols, although able to
   discriminate within Mycobacterium spp., have proved to be time-consuming
   or difficult to carry out. For this reason, the aim of this study was to
   obtain a rapid and specific diagnostic tool to quantify fish
   Mycobacterium spp. or to discriminate M. marinum from other
   mycobacteria. A primary PCR amplification with SYBR Green had a
   detection limit (dl) of 102Mycobacterium DNA copies with a log-linear
   quantification range up to 104 (R2 = 0.99). The second PCR using FRET
   probes, flanking a region containing species specific nucleotide
   variations, was designed and validated with synthetic erp gene fragments
   corresponding to different mycobacterial species, different whole
   mycobacteria suspensions, experimentally infected fish tissues, tissues
   from experimentally infected fish, and samples of cultured fish. The
   results show that the FRET probes demonstrate a high specificity as the
   melting curve analysis allowed efficient discrimination of M. marinum
   from Mycobacterium chelonae, Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium
   pseudoshottsii, Mycobacterium shottsii and Mycobacterium ulcerans. The
   kidney is the organ with the strongest detection signal and using fish
   tissues the method has a mean sensitivity of 50 DNA copies/PCR.},

Pages = {433-438},
Abstract = {With the goal of discovering new anti-infective agents active against
   microbial biofilms, this investigation focused on some natural
   pyrrolomycins, a family of halogenated pyrrole antibiotics. In this
   study the antistaphylococcal biofilm activity of pyrrolomycins C, D, F1,
   F2a, F2b, F3 and of the synthesized related compounds I, II, III were
   investigated. The susceptibility of six staphylococcal biofilms was
   determined by methyltiazotetrazolium staining. Most of the compounds
   were active at concentrations of 1.5 mu g ml(-1) with significant
   inhibition percentages. A few of the compounds were active at the lowest
   screening concentration of 0.045 mg ml(-1). The population log reduction
   of activity against the two best biofilm forming Staphylococcus aureus
   strains as determined by viable plate counts is also reported. In order
   to adequately assess the utility of these compounds, their toxicity
   against human cells was evaluated. It is concluded that pyrrolomycins
   and synthetic derivatives are promising compounds for developing novel
   effective chemical countermeasures against staphylococcal biofilms.},

Abstract = {The marine environment represents a part of the ecosystem vulnerable to
   chemical pollutant contaminations because of the extended and prolonged
   release of these contaminants from urban, industrial and agro-livestock
   wastewaters. Filter feeders, such as mussels (Mytilus
   galloprovincialis), can bio-accumulate heavy metals and persistent
   chemicals, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), but there are just a few data about
   their presence in shellfish farms located in Campania (Italy), in which
   the mussels breeding is one of the most important commercial activities.
   A survey on the classified sea farms in Campania was conducted, and it
   allowed us to identify and monitor the main areas of breeding. The
   results of the monitoring plan showed a heterogeneous distribution of
   these contaminants depending on areas with a general major contamination
   at shores located near strongly urbanized and industrial areas, in some
   cases abandoned. The heavy metal (lead, cadmium, chromium and mercury)
   levels were always below the maximum limits assessed by the EC, and all
   samples were compliants also for the 11 PAHs studied, although a maximum
   level was assessed by EC for the only benzo{[}a]pyrene. Finally, an
   evaluation of non-compliances for non dioxin-like PCB (ndl-PCB) levels
   was not possible because of the missing of a specific regulation,
   although only low levels were found.},

Abstract = {Since 2006 Egypt has been facing an extensive epidemic of H5N1 highly
   pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) with a huge number of outbreaks both
   in rural and intensively reared poultry areas. The use of efficacious
   vaccines in this country has been, and still remains, essential for the
   control and possible eradication of HPAI. The present study was
   performed to establish whether the administration of inactivated
   vaccines containing an H5 virus belonging to a different lineage to the
   Eurasian H5N1 HPAI viruses guarantees protection from clinical signs,
   provides significant immune response and is able to achieve a reduction
   of viral shedding in the face of a challenge with a contemporary H5N1
   virus isolated in Egypt. Despite the genetic and antigenic differences
   between the vaccine strain (H5N2/Mexico) and the challenge strain
   (H5N1/Egypt), confirmed by molecular and serological (haemagglutination
   inhibition) tests, it was established that the immune response induced
   by these conventional vaccines is sufficient to prevent infection in the
   majority of birds challenged with a contemporary H5N1 Egyptian strain.
   The data reported in this study also indicate that there may be a low
   degree of correlation between haemagglutination inhibition titres,
   clinical protection and reduction of shedding.},

   including pre-treatment of sera with 10\% chicken red blood cells, as
   the gold standard. Detectable specific antibodies appeared on day 7
   post-infection and persisted until the termination of the experiment.
   The relative sensitivity and specificity of the tests under evaluation

Abstract = {The prophylactic use of vaccines against exotic viral infections in
   production animals is undertaken exclusively in regions where the
   disease concerned is endemic. In such areas, the infection pressure is
   very high and so, to assure optimal protection, the most efficient
   vaccines are used. However, in areas considered to be free from these
   diseases and in which there is the possibility of only limited
   outbreaks, the use of Differentiation of infected from Vaccinated
   Animals (DIVA) or marker vaccines allows for vaccination while still
   retaining the possibility of serological surveillance for the presence
   of infection. This literature review describes the current knowledge on
   the use of DIVA diagnostic strategies for three important transboundary
   animal diseases: foot-and-mouth disease in cloven-hoofed animals,
   classical swine fever in pigs and avian influenza in poultry.},

Abstract = {A multi-scale object-based classification was carried out using data
   from three different sensors to map classes of interest in the framework
   of the EPISTIS project. This project aims to highlight the
   spatio-temporal patterns that underlie the epidemiology of certain
   diseases and more particularly of bluetongue in this case-study. A SPOT5
   10m XS image of Sardinia taken in the springtime was segmented and the
   land-cover/land-use classes that are the most easily discriminated were
   mapped using a thresholding approach. Subsequently, a DEM was used as
   ancillary data to map the riparian vegetation. The remaining vegetation
   classes were then mapped using a nearest-neighbour algorithm. ASTER
   features, notably derived from the SWIR bands, were used in addition to
   SPOT in the feature space to improve vegetation discrimination. Images
   taken in the springtime allow for a good discrimination between
   semi-natural vegetation and arable land, which was the initial
   objective. However, project developments implied further discrimination
   within the arable land. Due to their spectral similarity at this
   resolution in a patchy Mediterranean landscape, a number of classes
   could not be sufficiently well classified even using additional textural
   and contextual features. Therefore, data derived from MODIS vegetation
   indices time series were included in the classification process so as to
   account for the vegetation dynamics and improve the classification
   results.},

Abstract = {Fish pasteurellosis is an infectious disease that affects several fish
   species living in marine temperate waters. Its causative agent is the
   Gram-negative bacterium Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp).
   Fish pasteurellosis represents a serious health problem for the majority
   of intensive sea bream hatcheries, with 90-100\% mortality during
   disease outbreaks. Larvae and juveniles are the most susceptible stages.
   A potential strategy to prevent fish pasteurellosis is to select for
   animals that are genetically resistant to it. The aim of this work was
   to evaluate the genetic variation of disease resistance and growth in
   the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata L.). An experimental population,
   approximately 3500 animals originating from mass spawning of four
   broodstocks, was experimentally infected with a highly virulent strain
   of Phdp. Mortality was monitored daily for 19 days. Upon completion of
   the challenge experiment, genetic profiles at nine microsatellite loci
   were obtained for 1753 animals and for all (256) broodstock fish, for
   parentage assignment. A subset of families defined by means of genetic
   analysis was used to calculate heritability for survival to infection.
   For body length (measured post-mortem), heritability was 0.38 +/- 0.07.
   The heritability for disease resistance varied depending on how
   resistance was defined. Heritability was 0.12 +/- 0.04 for days of
   survival post challenge, defined as a continuous trait. while it ranged
   from 0.45 +/- 0.04 to 0.18 +/- 0.08 for the binary trait dead/alive at a
   specific day. The genetic correlation between body length and survival
   was positive and significant (r = 0.61 +/- 0.16). These results confirm
   the existence of genetic variation for growth and resistance against
   Phpd and highlight also the potential for selective breeding programs to
   improve these traits. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Background: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a protozoan diseases caused
   in Europe by Leishmania (L.) infantum. Asymptomatic Leishmania infection
   is more frequent than clinically apparent disease. Among HIV infected
   patients the risk of clinical VL is increased due to immunosuppression,
   which can reactivate a latent infection. The aims of our study were to
   assess the prevalence of asymptomatic L. infantum infection in HIV
   infected patients and to study a possible correlation between Leishmania
   parasitemia and HIV infection markers.
   Methods: One hundred and forty-five HIV infected patients were screened
   for the presence of anti-Leishmania antibodies and L. infantum DNA in
   peripheral blood. Statistical analysis was carried out by using a
   univariate regression analysis.
   Results: Antibodies to L. infantum were detected in 1.4\% of patients.
   L. infantum DNA was detected in 16.5\% of patients. Significant
   association for PCR-Leishmania levels with plasma viral load was
   documented (p = 0.0001).
   Conclusion: In our area a considerable proportion of HIV infected
   patients are asymptomatic carriers of L. infantum infection. A
   relationship between high HIV viral load and high parasitemic burden,
   possibly related to a higher risk of developing symptomatic disease, is
   suggested. PCR could be used for periodic screening of HIV patients to
   individuate those with higher risk of reactivation of L. infantum
   infection.},

Abstract = {The comparison of five real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods
   targeted at maize (Zea mays) endogenous sequences is reported. PCR
   targets were the alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) gene for three methods and
   high-mobility group (hmg) gene for the other two. The five real-time PCR
   methods have been checked under repeatability conditions at several
   dilution levels on both pooled DNA template from several genetically
   modified (GM) maize certified reference materials (CRMs) and single CRM
   DNA extracts. Slopes and R-2 coefficients of all of the curves obtained
   from the adopted regression model were compared within the same method
   and among all of the five methods, and the limit of detection and limit
   of quantitation were analyzed for each PCR system. Furthermore, method
   equivalency was evaluated on the basis of the ability to estimate the
   target haploid genome copy number at each concentration level. Results
   indicated that, among the five methods tested, one of the hmg-targeted
   PCR systems can be considered equivalent to the others but shows the
   best regression parameters and a higher repeteability along the dilution
   range. Thereby, it is proposed as a valid module to be coupled to
   different event-specific real-time PCR for maize genetically modified
   organism (GMO) quantitation. The resulting practicability improvement on
   the analytical control of GMOs is discussed.},

Abstract = {West Nile virus (WNV) has a history of irregular but recurrent
   epizootics in countries of Mediterranean and of Central and Eastern
   Europe. We have investigated the temporal enzootic activity of WNV in
   free-ranging birds over a 3-year period in an area with sporadic
   occurrences of WNV outbreaks in Southern France. We conducted an
   intensive serologic survey on several wild bird populations (>4000 serum
   samples collected from 3300 birds) selected as potential indicators of
   the WNV circulation. WNV antibodies were detected by seroneutralization
   and/or plaque reduction neutralization in house sparrows, black-billed
   magpies, and scops owls, but these species appeared to be insufficient
   indicators of WNV circulation. Overall seroprevalence was low (<1\%),
   including in birds that had been potentially exposed to the virus during
   recent outbreaks. However, the detection of a seroconversion in one
   bird, as well as the detection of seropositive birds in all years of our
   monitoring, including juveniles, indicate a constant annual circulation
   of WNV at a low level, including in years without any detectable
   emergence of WN fever in horses or humans.},

Abstract = {Salmonellosis is an important infection both in animals and in human
   beings. About the spreading of Salmonellosis in Italian cattle herds,
   the available data are poor and sporadic if we compared them with ones
   obtained in other countries. If we consider that there aren't any
   structured national prevalence studies in Italy, a valid contribution
   for estimating the presence of the infection in bovine was offered by
   the activity of the Istituti Zooprofilattici Sperimentali network.
   In this context, it was interesting to describe clinical symptoms, gross
   lesions and further laboratory results observed in reported outbreaks
   from 2002 and 2009 in Piedmont Region, in order to show how Salmonella
   infection is an emerging disease in bovine and to remark that a correct
   diagnostic approach in abortions, neonatal diarrhoea and sudden death in
   adult animals must include the detection of this pathogen. Thanks to the
   simultaneous application of general and specific cultural test for
   Salmonella spp., infection was observed in 12 herds, totally 16 strains,
   respectively belonging to four different serovars (typhimurium,
   veneziana, dublin, derby).
   Salmonella detection in 11 calves and 3 fetus confirms the correct
   diagnostic approach in order to control the presence and the diffusion
   of Salmonellosis in cattle farms.},

Title = {Eight years of entomological surveillance in Italy show no evidence of
   Culicoides imicola geographical range expansion},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {46},

Abstract = {P>1. Assessing changes in species range is based on identifying new
   occurrences in areas where absence has been inferred due to lack of
   previous records. This technique depends on creating a consistent
   observational dataset, based on comparable detection methods.
   2. In Mediterranean countries, the midge Culicoides imicola is the
   principal vector of bluetongue virus (BTV) that causes an infectious
   disease of domestic and wild ruminants. Over the last 10 years, BTV has
   invaded Mediterranean countries (1998) and much of Northern Europe
   (2006); this unprecedented spread is reported to be a possible
   consequence of climate change. In southern Europe, based on recent
   observations found in northern latitudes, BTV spread has been attributed
   in part to changes in C. imicola distribution. However, current sampling
   of Culicoides spp. is far more intensive and targeted than that
   undertaken before the first BTV epidemics; this obviously results in new
   information from areas in which collections would have had little chance
   of positive identification in the past.
   3. Since 2001, a national surveillance programme based on permanent
   traps was established in Italy to follow C. imicola population dynamics
   in space and time. Based on data from 2000 to 2001 cross-sectional
   studies, Italy was divided into three zones (I: endemicity; II:
   transition; III: absence) in which longitudinal data on C. imicola
   presence and abundance were analysed as a function of time between 2002
   and 2007 through linear and quantile regressions.
   4. The results from the surveillance programme demonstrate no detectable
   range expansion of the C. imicola population in Italy between 2002 and
   2007.
   5.Synthesis and applications. This study provides strong evidence that
   there has been no measurable range expansion between 2002 and 2007 in a
   species previously described as moving northwards as a result of climate
   change. For any reliable conclusions to be drawn on the range
   distribution of C. imicola or other similar vector species in Southern
   Europe, the Culicoides surveillance system across all European countries
   should be designed to provide comparable data based on a constant
   detection probability over time.},

   genus. The specific primers were designed aligning the rpoA gene
   sequences available in GenBank of all Vibrio species. The specificity of
   the primers was tested against 35 Vibrio species. In addition, 12
   species phylogenetically related to the Vibrio genus were used as
   negative control. Moreover, in order to eliminate any false-negative
   results, bacterium-specific primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene were
   introduced in the test as a noncompetitive internal amplification
   control. The rpoA primers correctly amplified all the Vibrio species
   considered. No cross-reaction was observed when tested against closely
   related species. To estimate the applicability of this method, 336
   Vibrio wildtype strains isolated from Italian aquaculture products and
   from imported seafoods were tested. The sensitivity, tested using serial
   dilutions of different pure cultures of certified strains, resulted to
   10(3) colony-forming units per milliliter. The assay proved to be
   specific, rapid, and reliable. It can be proposed as a routine screening
   technique for the confirmation of Vibrio genus in isolated colonies.},

Title = {Differential cell counts in canine cytocentrifuged bronchoalveolar
   lavage fluid: a study on reliable enumeration of each cell type},
Journal = {VETERINARY CLINICAL PATHOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {38},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background
   Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) allows cell recovery from the lower
   respiratory tract; differential cell counts of BAL fluid gives important
   information in the assessment of various bronchial and pulmonary
   diseases. To the best of our knowledge no study has investigated the
   relation between the number of cells counted and the reproducibility of
   BAL fluid differential cell counts.
   Objective
   The purpose of this study was to investigate using statistical methods
   how many cells should be counted in cytocentrifuged BAL fluid
   preparations in order to obtain a reliable enumeration of each cell
   type.
   Methods
   BAL fluid samples from dogs with suspected bronchopulmonary disease were
   obtained during fiberoptic bronchoscopy with a standardized protocol.
   Differential cell counts were performed on May-Grunwald-Giemsa-stained
   cytocentrifuged preparations by 2 independent observers. Reproducibility
   for the enumeration of each cell type was expressed as the intraclass
   correlation coefficient. We considered a threshold level of >= 0.90 to
   be high and a threshold level of >= 0.85 to be adequate.
   Results
   Forty BAL fluid samples were included in the study. For neutrophils,
   alveolar macrophages, and eosinophils high reproducibility was reached
   by counting 200 cells; adequate reproducibility was reached for
   lymphocytes and bronchial epithelial cells by counting 500 cells.
   Conclusions
   A 500-cell differential count is required for all types of cells to be
   quantified with adequate reproducibility in canine cytocentrifuged BAL
   fluid samples.},

   additional dimorphisms had lower risk of becoming scrapie affected when
   compared with those with ARQ/ARQ(wildtype) genotype. ARQ/ARQ genotypes
   that were detected with heterozygous or homozygous p.Asn176Lys and
   p.Met137Thr dimorphisms were associated with the lowest susceptibility
   to the disease. A significant lower risk was also associated with the
   p.Arg154His dimorphism, while p.Leu141Phe had a protective effect that

Abstract = {Visceral leishmaniosis is a life-threatening disease of medical, social
   and economic importance in endemic areas It is an opportunistic
   infection in immunocompromised patients, including human
   immunodeficiency virus-positive subjects Dogs are the main reservoir of
   Leishmania infantum The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy
   of miltefosine and allopurinol for the control of human leishmaniosis
   using the dog as a model. The study included 28 sick dogs treated with
   miltefosine (2 mg/kg/day PO) administered concurrently with allopurinol
   (10 mg/kg/day. PO) for 30 days. and then with allopurinol alone, at the
   same dosage, for I year Eight dogs (four of which relapsed) received a
   second cycle of miltefosine within 6 months of the first cycle Efficacy
   was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction assay oil whole
   blood samples and lymph node aspirates, collected at baseline and every
   3 months for 12 months
   Of the total number of animals (28). two showed renal insufficiency and
   died after the start of therapy with miltefosine. Two other dogs
   presented some side effects to treatment, such as nausea, vomiting and
   reduction in white and red blood cell counts, and these animals were
   excluded from the follow-up The results showed that the first cycle of
   therapy with miltefosine and allopurinol induced a drastic and
   progressive reduction of L. infantum load in lymph node aspirates but
   the second cycle did nor eliminate the parasite. (C) 2008 Published by

Abstract = {The present study was designed to examine, whether rabbits fed a diet
   containing High Fat (HF) could develop obesity and be predisposed to
   developing metabolic syndrome (Mets). The results have shown an
   increased adipose accumulation with a significant weight gain and an
   increase in abdominal circumference, periscapolar fat and liver weight
   in rabbits fed HF diets compared to rabbits fed a Low Fat (LFC) diet,
   associated with higher levels of plasma glucose, insulin and lower
   levels of High-Density-Lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in the rabbits fed
   the HF diets than the rabbits fed the LFC diet. An Oral Glucose
   Tolerance Test (OGTT) has been performed to evaluate glucose metabolism;
   the plasma glucose levels in the rabbits fed the HF diets were
   constantly higher (statistically significant at 0, 60, 90, 120 and 240
   min) than in the rabbits fed the LFC diet. The association between the
   HF diets and oxidative stress, indicated by the presence of Reactive
   Oxygen Species (ROS) in plasma, has also been investigated; the rabbits
   fed the HF diets had higher ROS values than the rabbits fed the LFC
   diet. In addition, the protective effect of Spirulina platensis (SP),
   antioxidant of vegetable origin, has also been investigated. The SP
   supplementation (10 g kg(-1) of the diet) did not have any effect on the
   morphological data or some parameters in plasma, while SP was able to
   reduce the ROS value in rabbits fed the high fat diet probably due to
   beneficial effect of the gamma-linolenic acid content in the SP.},

Abstract = {Livestock movement data represent a valuable source of information to
   understand the pattern of contacts between premises which may determine
   the spread of diseases.
   Social network analysis techniques have been used to analyse the
   movement patterns of cattle in Italy in 2007. A description of the
   structure of the Italian cattle industry is presented and the main trade
   flows and the relations between premises in relation to the potential
   spread of cattle diseases are investigated.
   Epidemic simulations have been carried out on the network build out of
   movement data using a network-based meta-population model. The
   simulations show the influence of the network structure on the dynamics
   and size of a hypothetic epidemic and give useful indications on the
   effects of targeted removal of nodes based on the centrality of premises
   within the network of animal movements. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Assessment of human herpesvirus-6 infection in mesenchymal stromal cells

Abstract = {P>Infection or reactivation of human herpesvirus (HHV)-6 represents a
   potentially serious complication (often involving the central nervous
   system) in patients receiving either solid organ or hematopoietic stem
   cell transplantation. The objective of this study was to assess the risk
   of HHV-6 infection/reactivation in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs).
   MSCs are multipotent cells displaying immunomodulatory properties that
   have been already successfully used in the clinical setting to enhance
   hematopoietic stem cell engraftment and to treat steroid-refractory
   acute graft-versus-host disease. We analyzed 20 samples of ex vivo
   expanded MSCs, at different passages of culture, isolated both from bone
   marrow and from umbilical cord blood. Through Western blotting and
   immunocytochemistry techniques, we investigated the presence of the
   HHV-6 receptor (CD46) on cell surface, whereas the presence of HHV-6 DNA
   was evaluated by nested polymerase chain reaction assay. All of the MSC
   samples tested were positive for the virus receptor (CD46), suggesting
   their potential susceptibility to HHV-6. However, none of the MSC
   samples derived from cultures, performed in the perspective of clinical
   use, was found to harbor HHV-6. This preliminary observation on a
   consistent number of MSC samples, some of them tested at late in vitro
   passages, indicates a good safety profile of the product in terms of
   HHV-6 contamination. Nevertheless, it remains important to set up in
   vitro experimental models to study MSCs' susceptibility to HHV-6 (and
   HHV-7) infection, to verify their capacity to integrate the virus into
   cellular DNA, and to investigate which experimental conditions are able
   to induce virus reactivation.},

Title = {Investigation on the occurrence of Echinococcus multilocularis in
   Central Italy},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {5},
Month = {NOV 26},
Abstract = {Background: Recent studies on geographic distribution of Echinococcus
   multilocularis in Europe show that it has a wider range than previously
   thought. It is unclear, however, if the wider distribution is due to its
   recent spreading or to a lack of previous data from the new areas.
   Italy, previously considered E. multilocularis-free, is now part of
   these new areas: infected foxes (the main definitive host of the
   tapeworm) have been observed in a Northern Alpine territory. Thus, more
   surveys need to be done in other Italian regions in order to monitor the
   spreading of E. multilocularis. The aim of the present study was to look
   for this parasite in 283 foxes collected in an Apennine area of Central
   Italy by different diagnostic methods.
   Results: The foxes were heavily parasitized by 11 helminthic genera, but
   none of the animals was infected by E. multilocularis neither by E.
   granulosus (harboured adult worms or their DNA). Low specificity was
   observed in commercially available ELISA kits for the detection of E.
   multilocularis antigens in the faeces. Molecular diagnostics were
   sensitive and specific for the detection and identification of tapeworm
   eggs in faeces, but less sensitive, although specific, to adult
   tapeworms in the intestinal content.
   Conclusion: Preliminarily, we can say that no E. multilocularis could be
   found in the study area. These data will enable us to follow temporal
   changes of the spatial distribution of the parasite in the study area of
   the Central Apennines. Due to its low specificity the ELISA kit for E.
   multilocularis coproantigens is not suitable for epidemiological
   surveys, whereas molecular diagnostics applied to faecal samples give
   useful results. Finally, absence of E. granulosus in foxes living in the
   endemic areas studied confirms the thought that this tapeworm prefers a
   different definitive host.},

   7.5 and 10 ng mL(-1)) was less than 16\%, respectively. The advantage of
   the method is that low ng mL(-1) levels can be detected and
   quantitatively confirmed rapidly in milk and that 3 batches of samples
   can be analysed within a single day using RRLC-MS/MS with a runtime of
   6.5 min. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A rapid and simple multi-residue procedure is described for assaying
   eleven quinolones (cinoxacin, ciprofloxacin, danofloxacin, difloxacin,
   enrofloxacin, flumequine, marbofloxacin, nalidixic acid, norfloxacin,
   oxolinic acid and sarafloxacin) in feeds at sub-additive levels (1-5 mg
   kg(-1)). Five grams of sample were extracted by a metaphosphoric
   acid/acetonitrile mixture (70/30, v/v) and purified onto OASIS HLB
   cartridges. The determination was achieved by liquid chromatography (LC)
   using a GEMINI 08 analytical column both with fluorescence detection
   (FD) and photodiode-array (DAD). Limits of detection for each drug were
   in the range 0.04-0.8 mg kg(-1). Above the limit of quantification
   (LOQ), in poultry feed the recoveries were from 69 to 98\% with relative
   standard deviations less than or equal 10\%. Finally the measurement
   uncertainty was estimated using the bottom-up approach. (C) 2009

Abstract = {A confirmatory method for the simultaneous determination of nandrolone
   (alpha and beta) and trenbolone (alpha and beta) in urine samples by
   liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) was
   developed. After an enzymatic deconjugation, the urine was subjected to
   a one-step cleanup on a commercially available immunoaffinity
   chromatography cartridge. The analytes were detected by liquid
   chromatography-positive ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry using
   deuterium labelled internal standards. The analytical procedure was
   applicable to bovine and swine urine samples. The procedure was
   validated as a quantitative confirmatory method according to the
   Commission Decision 2002/657/EC criteria. The results obtained showed
   that the method was suitable for statutory residues testing regarding
   the following performance characteristics: instrumental linearity,
   specificity, precision (repeatability and intra-laboratory
   reproducibility), recovery, decision limit (CC alpha), detection
   capability (CC beta) and ruggedness. The decision limits (CC alpha)
   obtained, were between 0.54 and 0.60 mu g L(-1); the recovery was above
   64\% for all the analytes. Repeatability was between 1.6\% and 5.7\% and
   within-laboratory reproducibility between 1.6\% and 6.0\% for all the
   steroids. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   receptors (SSTR1-5) mediate antiproliferative effects. In C6 rat glioma
   cells, somatostatin is cytostatic in vitro via phosphotyrosine
   phosphatase-dependent inhibition of ERK1/2 activity mediated by SSTR1,
   -2, and -5. Here we analyzed the effects of SSTR activation on C6 glioma
   growth in vivo and the intracellular mechanisms involved, comparing
   somatostatin effects with selective agonists for SSTR1, -2, and -5
   (BIM-23745, BIM-23120, BIM-23206) or receptor biselective compounds
   (SSTR1 and -2, BIM-23704; and SSTR2 and -5, BIM-23190). Nude mice
   subcutaneously xenografted with C6 cells were treated with somatostatin,
   SSTR agonists (50 mu g, twice/day), or vehicle. Tumor growth was
   evaluated every 3 days for 19 days. The intracellular pathways
   responsible of SSTR effects in vivo were evaluated measuring Ki-67,
   phospho-ERK1/2, and p27(kip1) expression by immunohistochemistry in
   sections from explanted tumors. Somatostatin and SSTR1, -2, and -5
   agonists strongly inhibited in vivo C6 tumor growth, intratumoral
   neovessel formation, Ki-67 expression, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and
   induced upregulation of p27(Kip1), whereas only a modest activation of
   caspase-3 was observed. Somatostatin (acting on SSTR1, -2, and -5)
   displayed the highest efficacy; SSTR5 selective agonist showed a
   stronger effect than SSTR1 agonist, and SSTR2 agonist was less
   effective. On the other hand, SSTR1 and -2 agonists maximally reduced
   tumor neovascularization. The combined activation of SSTR1 and -2 showed
   a synergistic activity, reaching a higher efficacy than BIM-23206,
   whereas the simultaneous activation of SSTR2 and -5 resulted in a
   response resembling SSTR5 effects. Thus the simultaneous activation of
   different SSTRs inhibits glioma cell proliferation in vivo through both
   direct cytotostatic and antiangiogenic effects.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: The cell cycle regulators P21(WAF1), P27(KIP1),
   P57(KIP2), P130, RASSF1A, and FOXO1 are down-regulated during
   hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) pathogenesis. We investigated the role of
   the ubiquitin ligase subunits CKS1 and SKP2, which regulate proteasome
   degradation of cell cycle regulators, in HCC progression. METHODS: Human
   HCC tissues from patients with better (HCCB, >3 years survival) and
   poorer prognosis (HCCP, <3 years survival) and HCC cell lines were
   analyzed. RESULTS: The promoters of p21(WAF1), P27(KIP1), and P57(KIP2)
   were more frequently hypermethylated in HCCP than HCCB. Messenger RNA
   levels of these genes were up-regulated in samples in which these genes
   were not methylated; protein levels increased only in HCCB because of
   CKS1- and SKP2-dependent ubiquitination of these proteins in HCCP. The
   level of SKP2 expression correlated with rate of HCC cell proliferation
   and level of microvascularization of samples and was inversely
   correlated with apoptosis and survival. In HCCB, SKP2 activity was
   balanced by degradation by the ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting
   complex/cyclosome (APC/C)-CDH1 and Lip-regulation of SKP2 suppressor
   histidine triad nucleotide binding protein I (HINT1). In HCCP, however,
   SKP2 was not degraded because of down-regulation of the phosphatase
   CDC14B, CDK2-dependent serine phosphorylation (which inhibits
   interaction between CDH1 and SKP2), and HINT1. inactivation. In HCC
   cells, small interfering RNA knockdown of SKP2 reduced proliferation and
   ubiquitination of the cell cycle regulators, whereas SKP2 increased
   proliferation and reduced expression of cell cycle regulators.
   CONCLUSIONS: Ubiquitination and proteasome degradation of P21WAF1,
   P27KIP1, P57KIP2, P130, RASSF1A, and FOXO1 and mechanisms that prevent
   degradation of SKP2 by APC/C-CDH1 contribute to HCC progression.
   CKS1-SKP2 ligase might be developed as a therapeutic target or
   diagnostic marker.},

Abstract = {Chlamydophila abortus (C. abortus) infection is related to reproductive
   failure in domestic ruminants. Although it has not been well
   characterized worldwide, this pathogen has already been identified in
   some European countries and in the USA. In Brazil, preliminary studies
   have shown serological evidence of C. abortus infection in herds with
   low antibody prevalence. Until now, the identification of C. abortus in
   biological samples from females presenting reproductive failures has not
   been described in Brazilian herds of domestic ruminants. The aim of this
   study was to evaluate the presence of the C. abortus in a collection of
   abortions from cattle (n=85), sheep (n=12), and goats (n=8), in samples
   of vaginal mucus from cows (n=13), sheep (n=90), and goats (n=20), and
   in semen from sheep (n=10) and goats (n=5). The specimens (n=243) were
   evaluated using a PCR assay developed to amplify the 16S-23S rRNA
   intergenic space of C. abortus. A PCR assay with an internal control,
   which amplifies a fragment from the ND5 gene of bovine mitochondrial
   DNA, was used in order to evaluate the efficiency of the DNA extraction
   and of the PCR reaction. All biological samples (n=243) included in this
   study were negative for C. abortus in the PCR assay. The internal
   control enabled the amplification of a product from the bovine
   mitochondrial ND5 gene in all cattle abortion samples (n=85). Given the
   serological evidence indicating the presence of C. abortus infection in
   Brazilian herds of domestic ruminants, and considering the wide sampling
   evaluated, the failure to identify C. abortus in this survey suggests
   that the frequency of clinical signs in infected animals may be low or
   even absent.},

Abstract = {Between 2002 and 2007, more than 1000 chickens from commercial farms,
   live bird markets and backyard farms in Nigeria and Niger were tested
   for the presence of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) genome.
   Phylogenetic analysis of full-length sequences of the spike 1 (S1) gene
   revealed a new genotype of IBV that we refer to as `IBADAN'. The minimum
   genetic distance to the closest `non-IBADAN' strains (UK/7/93 at the
   nucleotide level; H120 and M41 at the amino acid level) reached 24 and
   32\% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. The full
   genome of the IBADAN reference strain (NGA/A116E7/2006) had a genetic
   distance of 9.7-16.4\% at the nucleotide level with all available fully
   sequenced strains. As IBV S1 plays a major role in antigenicity, the
   antigenic relatedness of NGA/A116E7/2006 was compared with strains of
   other serotypes. NGA/A116E7/2006 did not cross-react with antisera
   against IT02, M41, D274, Connecticut or 793/B strains in virus
   neutralization assays. NGA/A116E7/2006 cross-reacted with the OX-like
   strain ITA/90254/2005 but only to a low level (antigenic relatedness of
   33 suggesting that IBADAN also represents a new serotype. A comparison
   of S1 sequences identified several amino acids that may play a role in
   IBV antigenicity. Despite the absence of obvious clinical signs in
   poultry infected by IBADAN strains, it is important to test the
   cross-protection of current vaccine strains.},

Abstract = {Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans
   (PCDFs) and certain dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs) are
   a family of chemically-related lipophilic compounds characterized by
   similar toxicity. Due to their properties they are universally
   distributed in the environment and classified as persistent organic
   pollutants (POPs). From most of studies carried out to evaluate human
   dietary intake, milk and dairy products result as a major contributors
   of PCDD/Fs uptake. Of course the main source of milk contamination is
   animal feeds. Lactating ruminants, cows included, transfer these
   compounds to the food chain by ingestion of contaminated vegetables or
   soil. Their resistance to degradation and a high lipophilicity means
   that PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs may be accumulated into fat tissues from which
   they are transferred to milk during lactation period.
   Seventy-nine cows milk samples, collected in the monitoring plan 2008,
   were analyzed for PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs. Eleven milk samples were
   non-compliant corresponding to five breeding livestock located in
   Caserta province. The distribution of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs congeners in
   these samples was examined in order to determine the likely sources of
   dioxins. The results show that the congener profile is characterized by
   a prevalence of PCDFs in respect of PCDDs, that represents the typical
   pattern of thermal origin contamination. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {6},

Pages = {658-669},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular bacteria that grow in eukaryotic
   cells and cause a wide spectrum of diseases. They can establish
   persistent infections, are mitogenic in vitro, promote polyclonal cell
   proliferation in vivo and induce resistance to apoptosis in infected
   cells-properties that might contribute to tumorigenesis. In fact,
   Chlamydophila psittaci (Cp) has been linked to the development and
   maintenance of ocular adnexal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (OAMZL). In
   this indolent malignancy, Cp is transported by monocytes and macrophages
   and causes both local and systemic infection. Cp elementary bodies are
   viable and infectious in the conjunctiva and peripheral blood of
   patients with OAMZL. Bacterial eradication with antibiotic therapy is
   often followed by lymphoma regression. Despite recent advances in the
   understanding of this bacterium-lymphoma association, several questions
   remain unanswered. For instance, prevalence variations among different
   geographical areas and related diagnostic and therapeutic implications
   remain a major investigational issue. We will focus on clinical and
   therapeutic implications of chlamydial infections in patients with
   lymphomas and summarize the current knowledge on the association between
   Cp infection and OAMZL. Available data on the epidemiology, biology and
   pathogenesis of this association are analyzed and new investigative and
   clinical approaches are discussed.},

Title = {Use of serum amyloid A and milk amyloid A in the diagnosis of

Volume = {76},

Abstract = {Mastitis is the most frequent and costly disease in dairy herds, as it
   negatively affects yield and milk quality. The presence of clinical
   mastitis is quite easy to asses, whereas the diagnosis of the
   subclinical form can be more difficult and requires laboratory assays.
   Somatic cell count (SCC) is widely used as a rapid and low-cost
   indicator of mastitis, even if is not useful in discriminating between
   the clinical and subclinical form. As amyloid A has been investigated as
   a marker of mastitis, the aim of this study was to assess the potential
   value of measuring amyloid A in serum and milk and the correlation with
   SCC in the diagnosis of subclinical mastitis. The reliability of two
   different ELISA kits for the measurement of amyloid A in milk was also
   tested. During a 1-month trial period, 21 cows were assigned to three
   experimental groups according to their health status: 6 cows with
   clinical mastitis (CM), 10 cows with subclinical mastitis (SM) and 5
   healthy cows (HE). Amyloid A was measured both in serum (SAA) and in
   quarter milk samples (mAA) with a serum ELISA kit, and in quarter milk
   samples (MAA) with a milk ELISA kit. SCC, total microbial count (TMC)
   and bacterial examination of the milk were also carried out. After a log
   transformation, the data were submitted to ANOVA and linear regression.
   TMC was significantly higher in cows with clinical mastitis, while no
   differences were observed between the other two experimental groups. SCC
   and MAA levels were significantly different among the three groups. mAA
   concentrations were similar between cows with subclinical and clinical
   mastitis, and SAA was not affected by mastitis. A significant
   correlation between SCC and MAA or mAA was detected, while no
   correlation was recorded between SAA and mAA. A close relationship
   between MAA and mAA was noticeable even at low concentrations,
   suggesting MAA as a potential physiological marker of subclinical
   mastitis.},

Abstract = {It is known that Caprine Herpesvirus 1 (CpHV-1) causes apoptosis in
   mitogen-stimulated as well as not stimulated caprine peripheral blood
   mononuclear cells (PBMC). Initial experiments in Madin Darby bovine
   kidney (MDBK) cells revealed that CpHV-1 infection induced apoptotic
   features like chromatin condensation and DNA laddering. Thus, to
   characterize in more detail this apoptotic process, activation of
   caspase-8, -9 and -3 in MDBK cells CpHV-1 infected was investigated and
   demonstrated. In addition, CpHV-1 infection resulted in disruption of
   mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release and alterations
   in the pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins of Bcl-2 family. Proteolytic
   cleavage of poly(ADPribose) polymerases (PARP), confirming the
   activation of downstream caspases, was also observed. Our data indicated
   that a ``cross-talk{''} between the death-receptor (extrinsic) pathway
   and the mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway occurred in CpHV-1-induced
   apoptosis in vitro. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   results obtained with this method have been compared with the expanded
   uncertainty calculated from data obtained during the years 2002-2007 by
   participation in Fapas proficiency testing.},

Abstract = {A 1-year-old, intact, male dwarf rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) was
   vaccinated against myxomatosis and rabbit viral hemorrhagic disease in
   February 1999, and a localized reaction appeared in the same anatomic
   site within a few days. No regression was observed after subcutaneous
   antibiotic treatment. The rabbit was kept under observation, and the
   swelling apparently disappeared in 3 months. The owner then decided to
   avoid any further subcutaneous drug administration. The referring
   veterinarian examined the animal on July 2006 for the sudden appearance
   of a nodular, 4.5 cm x 3.5 cm x 2.0 cm, subcutaneous mass located over
   the interscapular space. Fine-needle aspiration was performed, and a
   population of neoplastic spindle cells, rare pleomorphic multinucleated
   cells, and rare leukocytes were observed. The mass was surgically
   removed, fixed in 10\% neutral buffered formalin, and routinely
   processed for histologic, histochemical, and immunohistochemical
   diagnostic investigation. The neoplastic tissue exhibited fascicles
   composed of malignant spindle-shaped cells with elongated to oval
   hyperchromatic nuclei and scant cytoplasm. Occasional multinucleated
   cells were also observed. The neoplastic cells were immunoreactive for
   vimentin but did not stain for smooth muscle actin, desmin, myoglobin,
   and cytokeratins (AE1/AE3). Moreover, the histochemical stain for
   aluminum was positive. The diagnosis was fibrosarcoma based on
   morphologic and immunohistochemical results. The histologic features of
   this neoplasm were remarkably similar to feline injection-site sarcoma.},

Abstract = {Giardia duodenalis is a protozoan parasite of animals that is zoonotic.
   Given the capacity of this organism to spread via the faecal-oral route,
   animals held in overcrowded and unhygienic conditions are at high risk
   of infection. Faecal samples from dogs in three kennels in Rome were
   examined by microscopy and PCR for G. duodenalis, and the prevalence
   data generated were correlated with variables such as kennel identity,
   age of dog, length of time the dog had been kennelled and clinical
   signs.
   The overall prevalence of the parasite in the faecal samples was 20.5\%
   and was higher in samples from the largest kennel, which had the
   greatest turnover of dogs, and in faecal samples from younger animals.
   Giardia cysts were found more frequently in diarrhoeic animals but were
   also found in dogs with no clinical signs. Although the finding that the
   majority of isolates were dog-specific rather than zoonotic genotypes
   suggests that the zoonotic risk from this pathogen is less than
   previously thought, the higher prevalence of infection in younger dogs
   may pose a specific public health issue as such animals are more
   frequently re-homed with families. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Mercury represents an ubiquitous environmental toxic metal. Heat shock
   proteins (HSP) and metallothioneins (MTs) help to protect cells against
   metal toxicity. Schisandrin B (Sch B), a lignoid from Schisandra
   chinensis, has been successfully used to treat hepatitis, but its effect
   against mercury hepatotoxicity remains unknown. We analyzed whether Sch
   B could protect rat liver against mercuric chloride (HgCl2) intake by
   analyzing stress proteins and histopathological changes.
   Wistar rats were administered Sch B (110 mg/kg/day by gavage) or vehicle
   (olive oil) for 10 days. A subset of each group also received low-dose
   HgCl2 (0.1 mg/kg/day) for 3 days on days 8-10. Another group received
   Sch B for 10 days with a single high dose of HgCl2 (1 mg/kg
   intraperitoneally) on day 10.
   In rats treated with Sch B and HgCl2, HSP72, HSP25 and MTs were
   overexpressed in liver zones 1 and 3 irrespective of HgCl2 dosing
   schedules. Furthermore Sch B alone induced perinuclear rough endoplasmic
   reticulum alignment and if associated to HgCl2, increased mitochondrial
   density and dense bodies, all signs of intense detoxification machinery.
   Taking together these data suggest that dietary Sch B counteracts
   Hgcl(2) hepatotoxicity in the rat by stimulating chaperones responsible
   for anabolic activity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A close link between stress protein up-regulation and oxidative damage
   may provide a novel therapeutic tool to counteract nephrotoxicity
   induced by toxic metals in the human population, mainly in children, of
   industrialized countries. Here we analysed the time course of the
   expression of several heat shock proteins, glucose-regulated proteins
   and metallothioneins in a rat proximal tubular cell line (NRK-52E)
   exposed to subcytotoxic doses of inorganic mercury and lead.
   Concomitantly, we used morphological and biochemical methods to evaluate
   metal-induced cytotoxicity and oxidative damage. In particular, as
   biochemical indicators of oxidative stress we detected reactive oxygen
   species (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS), total glutathione (GSH) and
   glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity. Our results clearly
   demonstrated that mercury increases ROS and RNS levels and the
   expressions of Hsp25 and inducible Hsp72. These findings are
   corroborated by evident mitochondrial damage, apoptosis or necrosis. By
   contrast, lead is unable to up-regulate Hsp72 but enhances Grp78 and
   activates nuclear Hsp25 translocation. Furthermore, lead causes
   endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, vacuolation and nucleolar
   segregation. Lastly, both metals stimulate the over-expression of MTs,
   but with a different time course. In conclusion, in NRK-52E cell line
   the stress response is an early and metal-induced event that correlates
   well with the direct oxidative damage induced by mercury. Indeed,
   different chaperones are involved in the specific nephrotoxic mechanism
   of these environmental pollutants and work together for cell survival.

Title = {Canine piroplasmosis in Italy: epidemiological aspects in vertebrate and

Abstract = {In Italy, canine piroplasmosis is believed to be widespread, but few
   data are available on its presence in most areas. In 2005 and 2006,
   vertebrate and invertebrate hosts were investigated in Central and
   Northern Regions of the Country. Microscopy on blood smears, molecular
   tools and serological tests were applied to 420 blood samples collected
   from dogs, in order to evaluate the presence of these protozoa and to
   identify possible risk factors. Moreover, ticks were analyzed by
   molecular techniques.
   Microscopy identified as positive 2.8\% of the animals, all from Central
   Italy, and PCR detected `piroplasm' DNA in 6.0\%. Serology evidenced a
   mean prevalence of 34.0\% with a decreasing trend from Central to
   Northern areas. The 507 collected ticks were identified as belonging to
   8 species, mostly represented by Rhipicephalus sanguineus (n = 376) and
   Ixodes ricinus (n = 58). Molecular analyses evidenced the presence of
   babesial parasites (Babesia canis canis, B. canis vogeli, B.
   microti-like) in 25 (4.9\%) of them; in Rh. sanguineus there was also
   demonstration of the vertical transmission of B. canis canis.
   Statistical analysis identified `kennel' as risk factor for Babesia
   infection.
   Our findings evidenced that different species of piroplasms potentially
   infectious for dogs are circulating in Italy, and that epidemiological
   aspects of these infections are more complex than expected. Vector
   importance of both Rh. sanguineus and L ricinus is hypothesized, but
   further investigation is needed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {RNA helicase-like receptors MDA-5 but not RIG-I has been shown to be
   essential for triggering innate immune responses against picornaviruses.
   However, virus-host co-evolution has selected for viruses capable of
   replicating despite host cells antiviral defences. In this report, we
   demonstrate that RIG-I is degraded during encephalomyocarditis virus
   (EMCV) infection. This effect is mediated by both the viral-encoded 3C
   protease and caspase proteinase. In addition, we show that RIG-I
   overexpression confers IFN-beta promoter activation during EMCV
   infection, in MDA-5 knockout (MDA-5(-/-)) mouse embryo fibroblasts. This
   induction is followed by a strong inhibition reflecting the ability of
   EMCV to disrupt RIG-I signalling. Taken together, our data strongly
   suggest that during evolution RIG-I has been involved for triggering
   innate immune response to picornavirus infections. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Title = {Interlaboratory trial on TSE rapid tests for the control of the Italian

Abstract = {Scrapie, a neurodegenerative disease of sheep and goats and one of
   several transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) has been
   subject to mandatory active surveillance in EU through rapid testing
   since 2002. Regulation EC/999/2001 on TSE surveillance requires that
   each Member State's National Reference Laboratory for TSE periodically
   verifies diagnostic standards and methods by comparative testing. In
   2007 the Italian Reference Centre carried out the first ring trial for
   classical scrapie on a set of 21 negative and 9 positive homogenated
   brainstems, the latter consisting of three replicates of an ARQ/ARQ
   scrapie positive sample diluted 1: 10, 1:20 and 1:50. The purpose of the
   study was to verify the interlaboratory agreement in term of Cohen's
   kappa (k) of the rapid systems currently used by the 25 national rapid
   test laboratories (RTLs) {[}laboratories: Biorad TeSeE (17
   laboratories), Enfer TSE version 2.0 (4 laboratories), Idexx Herd chek
   BSE-scrapie antigen kit (3 laboratories) and Prionics check LIA SR (1
   laboratory)].
   Our results show that the agreement among the laboratories using the
   same rapid test varied between 0.84 and 1, while the estimated overall
   agreement among the 25 laboratories was very good (k-combined = 0.87,
   95\% confidence interval 0.85-0.89). Nevertheless, as regards
   differences in analytical sensitivity among the rapid tests in use,
   under-recognition of pre-clinical scrapie cases by lower performing
   systems must be expected. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Astroviruses have been described in several animals species frequently
   associated with diarrhoea, especially in young animals. In dogs,
   astrovirus-like particles have been observed sporadically and very
   little is known about their epidemiology and characteristics. In this
   paper, we describe the detection of astrovirus-like particles in
   symptomatic puppies. Furthermore, for the first time in this species,
   the presumptive identification made by electron microscopy was confirmed
   by genetic analysis of the viral RNA conducted directly on the clinical
   specimens. Genetic sequences of ORF2 (2443 nt), encoding for the capsid
   protein, and partial sequence of ORF1b (346 nt), encoding for the viral
   polymerase, identified the viruses as member of the family Astroviridae.
   The phylogenetic analysis clearly clustered canine astroviruses in the
   genus Mamastrovirus. Relative closest similarities were revealed with a
   cluster comprising human, porcine and feline astroviruses, based on the
   ORF2 sequences available. Based on the species definition for
   astroviruses and on the data obtained in this study, we suggest a new
   species of astrovirus - canine astrovirus, CaAstV - to be included in
   the genus Mamastrovirus. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Animal tumour registry of two provinces in northern Italy: incidence of
   spontaneous tumours in dogs and cats},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {5},
Month = {OCT 13},
Abstract = {Background: Cancer is a major cause of death in domestic animals.
   Furthermore, many forms of pet neoplasm resemble that of their human
   counterparts in biologic behaviour, pathologic expression, and
   recognised risk factors. In April 2005, a pilot project was activated so
   as to establish a dog and cat tumour registry living in the Venice and
   Vicenza provinces (Veneto Region, north-eastern Italy), with the aim of
   estimating the incidence of spontaneous tumours.
   Results: Through a telephone survey, the estimates of canine and feline
   populations of the catchment area turned out to be of 296,318 (CI +/-
   30,201) and 214,683 (CI +/- 21,755) subjects, respectively. During the
   first three years, overall 2,509 canine and 494 feline cases of
   neoplasia were diagnosed. In dogs, the estimated annual incidence rate
   (IR) per 100,000 dogs for all tumours was 282 in all the catchment area,
   whereas in cats the IR was much lower (IR = 77). Malignant and benign
   tumours were equally distributed in male and female dogs, whereas cats
   had a 4.6-fold higher incidence of malignant tumours than benign. In
   both dogs and cats, purebreds had an almost 2-fold higher incidence of
   malignant tumours than mixed breeds. Tumour incidence increased with age
   in both dog and cat populations.
   Conclusion: This study has provided estimates of incidence of
   spontaneous neoplasm in companion animals. Further attempts will be made
   to increase the accuracy in the population size assessment and to
   ascertain the real gap with the official regional canine demographic
   registry. Veterinary practitioners may also benefit from the tumour
   registry insofar they may obtain data for specific breeds, age groups or
   geographical areas.},

Abstract = {Resistance to fluoroquinolones was evaluated in 17 nalidixic
   acid-resistant Escherichia coli strains isolated from animal faeces.
   Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), restriction fragment length
   polymorphism (RFLP), hybridisation and sequencing were used to reveal
   point mutations in DNA gyrase subunits A and B and the presence of the
   qnr gene as evidence of plasmid resistance. Chromosomal resistance and
   class 1 integrons were found in 10 of the 17 E. coli strains examined,
   while the qnr gene was not found in any of these. Mutation Ser83-Leu was
   found in six strains and in one strain mutation Ser83-Ala was found in
   gyrA. Mutations in gyrA Asp87 codons and in gyrB Asp426 or Lys 447
   codons were not identified. Sequencing of the E. coli strain ATCC 25922
   subjected to resistance induction revealed a gyrB mutation of the Lys
   447 residue which had been replaced by arginine.},

Abstract = {Ulcerative enteritis or ``quail disease{''} is an acute clostridial
   infection of young birds reported in many avian species, chicken and
   turkey included. Clostridium colinum is the causative agent of
   ulcerative enteritis and because of the difficulties bound to the
   isolation and identification of this bacterium by means of classic
   bacteriological techniques, its detection appears very hard and the
   prevalence of this disease could be underestimated. To investigate the
   diffusion of C. colinum in enteric disease of birds, a recently
   developed PCR protocol was applied to 42 cultural broths previously
   inoculated with organs and intestinal samples collected from diseased
   subjects. PCR-positive broths were cultivated to attempt the isolation
   of C. colinum. Samples collected from positive birds were subjected to
   histological examinations. 4 birds (3 broilers chickens and 1 pigeon)
   resulted PCR-positive and, in one case, C. colinum was isolated. Gross
   and histological lesions of positive birds were compatible with those
   described in other ulcerative enteritis outbreaks. These preliminary
   results demonstrates that C. colinum is sporadically implicated in
   enteric diseases of broiler chickens (14.2\%). In addition, the PCR
   assay proved to be an useful and reliable instrument to support the
   diagnosis of ulcerative enteritis and to facilitate the isolation of C.

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to develop and apply protocols for the
   microbiological depuration of bivalve molluscs (Chamelea gallina and
   Mitylus galloprovincialis). The study was divided into the following
   phases: preparation of two closed-circuit tanks fitted with mechanical,
   chemical and biological filtration systems for the depuration of bivalve
   molluscs, mollusc contamination and depuration, analyses of molluscs and
   depuration waters (biometric and microbiological tests) and statistical
   processing of the experimental data. The Escherichia coli challenge
   revealed the high efficacy of the depuration system and thus the
   possibility of preparing the molluscs for sale in a relatively short
   period of time. Depuration tests against Salmonella Typhimurium were
   effective only after 72 h to 84 h. Results for Vibrio parahaemolyticus
   revealed only a small reduction in the bacterial load during the entire
   observation period. However, depuration times were shorter in trials
   with mussels: V. parahaemolyticus was no longer detected after 36 h to
   48 h.},

Abstract = {In Italy pig industry is one of the most important sector in livestock
   husbandry, also as a consequence of the economic value of by-product
   production. Pig farming is mainly concentrated in Northern Regions
   where, over the past decade a significant increase in pig population has
   occurred. In the remaining Regions pig farming is less specialized and
   it is characterized by small-scale holdings mainly for self-consumption
   or for small-scale trade. The presence of different pig farming systems
   determine the coexistence of different: management systems, production
   scales, health and bio-security standards, market requirements and
   production costs; all these factors are considered relevant for diseases
   spreading. Theoretically the application of rigorous prevention measures
   (bio-security) may modulate the risk of disease diffusion but, data
   emerged during the surveillance and eradication campaigns, indicate that
   the bio-security measures applied are too weak to guarantee the status
   of the entire system. This inconvenience could be overcome throughout
   the assignment of different levels of risk, to be established throughout
   the collection of objective parameters on the holding. Trade between
   farms of the same level of risk and same health standard could guarantee
   the status of the entire sector and safeguard the economic and market
   requirements of the different production systems.},

Abstract = {Dermatophytes are fungi that can be contagious and cause infections in
   the keratinized skin of mammals, including humans. The etiological
   diagnosis of dermatophytosis relies on a combination of in vitro-culture
   and microscopic methods. Effective molecular tools could overcome the
   limitations of conventional methods of identification. In the present
   study, following phenetic identification as M. canis, M. fulvum, M.
   gypseum, T mentagrophytes and T terrestre, we genetically characterized
   key dermatophytes, employing the sequences of the first and second
   internal transcribed spacers of nuclear ribosomal DNA as well as part of
   the chitin synthase-1 gene, and assessed the utility of these DNA
   regions (based on levels of nucleotide variation within and among
   species/taxa) as markers for the classification of species and
   genotypes. Employing partial chitin synthase-1 gene as the marker, we
   also established a PCR-coupled SSCP approach as a diagnostic/analytical
   mutation-scanning tool. This tool should facilitate fundamental
   investigations of the ecology, epidemiology and population genetics of
   dermatophytes and, importantly, should assist in allowing a more rapid
   diagnosis of dermatophytoses in humans and other animals, thus
   overcoming the significant delays in targeted chemotherapy following
   diagnosis using conventional methods. (Nucleotide sequence data reported

Abstract = {There is evidence that in the acute axonal motor neuropathy (AMAN)
   subtype of Guillain-Barre syndrome antibodies to gangliosides, produced
   through molecular mimicry by antecedent Campylobacter jejuni (C jejuni)
   infection, attack gangliosides expressed in human peripheral nerve
   axolemma, inducing a primary axonal damage. The aim of this study is to
   investigate whether the T cell response has a role in AMAN pathogenesis.
   We isolated monocytes from 4 healthy subjects and 5 AMAN patients with
   antecedent C jejuni infection and antibodies to GM1 and/or GD1a
   gangliosides. Immature dendritic cells expressing CD1 molecules cultured
   with autologous T cells were stimulated with 2 lipopolysaccharides
   (LPSs) extracted from C jejuni strains containing GM1 and GDla-like
   structures and with GM1 and GD1a. The T cell response to LPSs and to
   gangliosides was determined by measuring the release of IFN-gamma and
   TNF-alpha. We observed a T cell response to both LPSs in controls and
   AMAN patients, whereas only AMAN patients showed T cell reactivity to
   gangliosides GM1 and GD1a with a tight correlation between T cell
   reactivity to the ganglioside and individual antibody responses to the
   same ganglioside. T cells responding to gangliosides were
   CD1c-restricted CD8 positive and CD27 negative. These findings indicate
   a contribution of cellular immunity in the pathogenesis of AMAN. A
   possible role for ganglioside-reactive T cells might be to facilitate
   the production of antibodies against gangliosides.},

Abstract = {50 Escherichia coli (APEC-Avian Pathogenic Escherichia coli) strains and
   15 E. coli (AFEC-Avian Faecal Escherichia coli) from turkeys affected by
   colibacillosis and from healthy turkeys were tested for the presence of
   eight different virulence-associated genes. Besides, APEC were
   serotyped. 078 has been the most detected serotyped. The presence of the
   tested virulence genes was prevalently related to the APEC isolates.
   With reference to serogroup, all the tested 078 resulted iss and irp2
   positive. Besides, tsh e cva/cvi were respectively present in 88.9 and
   83.3\% of O78. Nevertheless, the finding of a not typeable strains
   equipped with all the eight tested virulence genes among the APEC
   isolates suggest the importance of a careful and complete
   characterisation of the isolate to evaluate the real potential
   pathogenic attitude of the bacterium.},

   in the field of operations concerning official inspections of Lombardia
   animal origin and by a few private companies for self-inspection. The
   TMC was consistently low and in line with reports in the literature, as
   was the case with coliforms, E. coli, S. aureus, sulphate-reducing
   Clostrides and B. cereus. In the case of Salmonella spp., only 5 samples
   tested positive: one for S. typhimurium and one for S. enteritidis
   (chicken); only one sample from turkey tested positive for S. blokley,
   and two out of five samples analysed from quail tested positive result
   for S. typhimurium. About 3\% of the samples analyzed tested positive
   for Listeria monocitogenes, but they were within the legal limits.
   Research on Campylobacter thermophiles has involved only 50 samples, of

Abstract = {For over 30 years alpha toxin was considered the key virulence factor
   responsible for the appearance of necrotic enteritis (NE) in chickens
   but, recently, a new toxin related to the occurrence of NE, called NetB,
   has been described. The aim of this work was to evaluate the CP
   toxin-type and the NetB gene presence in strains collected from chickens
   affected or not by enteric diseases. 107 strains were tested: 30
   isolated from chickens affected by NE, 54 from subjects affected by
   other enteric pathologies and 22 from healthy animals. All strains
   resulted toxin-type A and 26.17\% of these was positive also for beta 2
   toxin gene. No strains were positive for cpe gene. 27\% (29/107) of CP
   was NetB positive and 93\% (27/29) of these was isolated from birds
   affected by intestinal disorders. 16 NetB positive strains were obtained
   from chickens affected by NE (16/30), 9 from animals affected by other
   intestinal disorders (9/54) and 4 from healthy animals (4/22). A
   significant difference between the number of NetB positive strains
   isolated from animals affected by NE and healthy chickens has been
   observed (P=0.014). However, the finding that the 17.4\% of strains
   isolated from healthy chickens was also positive for NetB, confirm that
   other virulence factors could play an important role on NE appearance.},

Abstract = {Cylindrospermopsin (CYN) is a toxic alkaloid-like compound produced by
   some strains of cyanobacteria, procariotic organisms occurring in water
   blooms, observed worldwide in eutrophic lakes and drinking water
   reservoirs. Methods for determination of CYN in freshwater and fish
   muscle by liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ion trap mass
   spectrometry are herein described. The performances of both methods are
   reported; ion trap LC/ESI-MS/MS resulted highly selective and reliable
   in unambiguous identification of CYN, based on monitoring the precursor
   ion and three product ions. The methods developed showed satisfactory
   mean recoveries (higher than 63.6\%) and relative standard deviations,
   ranging from 5.8 to 9.8\%. The limits of quantification at 0.10 ng/mL in
   freshwaters and 1.0 ng/g in fish muscle, respectively, allow for
   determination of CYN also in early contamination stages. Ion trap
   LC/ESI-MS/MS was successfully applied to the identification and
   quantification of CYN in water and cyanobacteria extracts from Lake
   Averno, near Naples, representing the first case of contamination
   described in southern Italy. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {The aim of this investigation was to compare different indices for
   evaluating nutritional conditions of red deer (Cervus elaphus) in an
   alpine environment during the autumn in order to detect the most
   convenient ones for management purposes in our specific situation. Body
   conditions of 274 red deer were evaluated using kidney fat index, back
   fat index and body condition scores. Body Condition Scores was the
   easiest but the least reliable method. Both kidney fat index and back
   fat index were significantly affected by age and sex class (always lower
   in younger animals) and, in females, also by lactation status. In stags,
   a negative regression effect of culling date on both kidney fat index
   and back fat index was observed. A significant positive correlation
   between kidney fat index and back fat index was recorded. Both kidney
   fat index and back fat index were objective indicators of nutritional
   status and sensitive to changes in physical conditions, but back fat
   index was both quicker and easier to be measured. As a direct
   implication, we suggest that back fat index can be a practical and
   reliable indicator for monitoring red deer conditions in alpine areas
   during the autumn, provided that the effects of sex, age and date of
   culling are taken into account.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate by PCR analyses the presence of
   Coxiella burnetii infection in fetuses of water buffalo (Bubalus
   bubalis) in the Campania region (Southern Italy). Samples were collected
   only from aborted fetuses and C. burnetii presence was evaluated by
   one-tube nested PCR amplification of the IS111 repetitive element. Of
   the 164 fetuses examined 14 (17.5\%) were positive after DNA
   amplification, showing that C burnetii occurs in this population of
   water buffaloes. However, more extensive prevalence studies need to be
   carried out to define the role of buffaloes as reservoirs for this
   pathogen and also the role of C. burnetii as an abortive agent in this
   animal. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The lesions observed in 16 wild boars, hunted in central Italy, led to
   the suspect that could be related to the infection by porcine circovirus
   type 2 (PCV2). The animals had macroscopic and histological lesions in
   the lungs, tonsils, and bronchial lymph nodes. PCV2 was detected in
   tissue samples by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
   immunohistochemistry and it was isolated in newborn swine kidney cell
   cultures. From the infected cell culture supernatant, the presence of
   PCV2 DNA was confirmed by real-time PCR whereas virus particles were
   observed by electron microscopy. These diagnostic data indicate that
   PCV2 can infect and cause disease in Sus scrofa subspecies other than
   domestic swine and it is present in the wild boar population in central
   Italy.},

Abstract = {In the present work mites previously identified as Dermanyssus gallinae
   De Geer (Acari, Mesostigmata) using morphological keys were investigated
   by molecular tools. The complete internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1),
   5.8S ribosomal DNA, and ITS2 region of the ribosomal DNA from mites were
   amplified and sequenced to examine the level of sequence variations and
   to explore the feasibility of using this region in the identification of
   this mite. Conserved primers located at the 3'end of 18S and at the
   5'start of 28S rRNA genes were used first, and amplified fragments were
   sequenced. Sequence analyses showed no variation in 5.8S and ITS2 region
   while slight intraspecific variations involving substitutions as well as
   deletions concentrated in the ITS1 region. Based on the sequence
   analyses a nested PCR of the ITS2 region followed by RFLP analyses has
   been set up in the attempt to provide a rapid molecular diagnostic tool
   of D. gallinae.},

   on typing of Clostridium spp. isolated from samples of jejunum and ileum
   of 82 birds out of 17 turkeys flocks. The birds were 6-day to 104-day
   old, both male and female, with enteric disorders. The presence of toxin
   NetB was investigated. Multiplex PCR to detect cpa, cpb1, cpetx, cp1,
   cpb2 and cpe toxin genes were used for Clostridium typing. No lesions of
   necrotic enteritis were observed. Clostridium perfringens type A was
   isolated from 25 enteric samples, Clostridium difficile was found in 4
   cases and Clostridium sordelli in one case. Clostridium perfringens was
   present from 6 to 104 days of age indicating its possible role in the
   enteric disorders of commercial turkeys. NetB toxin was found in no
   sample. 3 out of 4 isolates of Clostridium difficile were characterized

Abstract = {Noroviruses are the most common viral agents of acute gastroenteritis in
   humans and are often associated with the consumption of either fresh or
   undercooked live bivalve molluscs. The aim of the study was to evaluate
   the efficacy of the water depuration systems in the presence of
   Norovirus contamination A total of 96 shellfish samples was examined by
   reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, as follows: 58 mussel
   samples (Mytilus galloprovincialis), 35 Manila clam samples (Tapes
   decussatus) and 3 Pacific oyster samples (Crassostrea gigas). Of these,
   67 were collected before and 29 following depuration. Viral RNA was
   detected in one of the 67 non-depurated samples examined (1.5\%; 95\%
   confidence interval: 0.36-7.92\%) and in one of the 29 depurated samples
   (3.4\%; 95\% confidence interval: 0.82-17.22\%). There were no
   statistically significant differences between depurated and
   non-depurated samples which indicated that the purifying systems in
   place were not able to remove Norovirus contamination from the live
   bivalve molluscs.},

Abstract = {Two different batches of meagre Argyrosomus regius were stocked in the
   same floating cage located in north-eastern Sardinia (western
   Mediterranean Sea). After 4 mo, the fish started showing non-specific
   disease signs, such as lethargy, emaciation, gill anaemia and mortality.
   In total 65 specimens of meagre of both stocks were sampled for
   parasitological and microbiological analysis, and only 1 species of
   parasite, the microcotylid monogenean Sciaenacotyle panceri, was found
   on the gills of caged meagre. No protozoan or other metazoan parasites
   were found and no bacteria or viruses were isolated. After the outbreak,
   a total mortality rate of 5 to 10\% was estimated for the older fish
   stock, while no noteworthy mortality was recorded in younger fish
   (<2\%). This is the first account of S. panceri on the gills of cultured
   meagre as causative agent of disease and mortality. The effects of the
   presence of this parasite emphasise the need for disease control
   strategies of cultured meagre, and investigating the transfer of
   microcotylids from wild to caged fish.},

Title = {Novel swine influenza virus subtype H3N1 in Italy},

Year = {2009},
Volume = {138},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {361-367},

Abstract = {To date, three subtypes of swine influenza viruses, H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2
   have been isolated in Italy. In 2006, a novel swine influenza virus
   subtype (H3N1) was isolated from coughing pigs. RT-PCR performed on lung
   tissues, experimental infection in pigs with the novel isolate, and
   cloning the virus by plaque assay confirmed this unique H and N
   combination. The novel isolate was also antigenically and genetically
   characterized. Genetic and phylogenetic analysis showed that the
   complete HA gene of the H3N1 strain has the highest nucleotide identity
   to three Italian H3N2 strains, one isolated in 2001 and two in 2004,
   whereas the full length NA sequence is closely related to three H1N1
   subtype viruses isolated in Italy in 2004. The remaining genes are also
   closely related to respective genes found in H1N1 and H3N2 SIVs
   currently circulating in Italy. This suggests that the novel SIV could
   be a reassortant between the H3N2 and H1N1 SIVs circulating in Italy.

Title = {Biological risks associated with consumption of reptile products},

Abstract = {The consumption of a wide variety of species of reptiles caught from the
   wild has been an important source of protein for humans world-wide for
   millennia. Terrapins. snakes, lizards, crocodiles and iguanas are now
   farmed and the consumption and trade of their meat and other edible
   products have recently increased in some areas of the world. Biological
   risks associated with the consumption of products from both farmed and
   wild reptile meat and eggs include infections caused by bacteria
   (Salmonella spp., Vibrio spp.). parasites (Spirometra, Trichinella,
   Gnathostoma, pentastomids), as well as intoxications by biotoxins. For
   crocodiles, Salmonella spp. constitute a significant public health risk
   due to the high intestinal carrier rate which is reflected in an equally
   high contamination rate in their fresh and frozen meat. There is a lack
   of information about the presence of Salmonella spp. in meat from other
   edible reptilians, though captive reptiles used as pets (lizards or
   turtles) are frequently carriers of these bacteria in Europe.
   Parasitic protozoa in reptiles represent a negligible risk for public
   health compared to parasitic metazoans, of which trichinellosis,
   pentastomiasis, gnathostomiasis and sparganosis can be acquired through
   consumption of contaminated crocodile, monitor lizard, turtle and snake
   meat. respectively. Other reptiles. although found to harbour the above
   parasites. have not been implicated with their transmission to humans.
   Freezing treatment inactivates Spirometra and Trichinella in crocodile
   meat, while the effectiveness of freezing of other reptilian meat is
   unknown. Biotoxins that accumulate in the flesh of sea turtles may cause
   chelonitoxism, a type of food poisoning with a high mortality rate in
   humans. Infections by fungi. including yeasts, and viruses widely occur
   in reptiles but have not been linked to a human health risk through the
   contamination of their meat. Currently there are no indications that
   natural transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) occur in
   reptilians. The feeding of farmed reptiles with non-processed and
   recycled animal products is likely to increase the occurrence of
   biological hazards in reptile meat. Application of GHP, GMP and HACCP
   procedures, respectively at farm and slaughterhouse level, is crucial
   for controlling the hazards. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Metabolic changes in dairy cows induced by oral, low-dose

Abstract = {Many apparently healthy cows show marked inflammatory conditions around
   calving, associated with endocrine and metabolic changes. To prevent the
   above conditions, a low-dose, oral interferon-a (IFN-alpha) treatment
   was carried out on periparturient, multiparous dairy cows. In the first
   trial, 10 cows received 10 IU of IFN-alpha/kg of BW daily during the
   last 2 wk of pregnancy. In a second trial, 4 cows received 0.5 IU of
   IFN-alpha/kg of BW daily until d 5 of lactation. In both trials, a
   homogenous group of untreated dairy cows was used as control. All cows
   were monitored, during the month before and after calving, for health
   status, BCS, milk yield, and inflammatory, metabolic, immune, and
   hematological variables. Compared with control cows, IFN-alpha-treated
   animals showed in both trials a larger decrease of BCS along with
   decreased milk yield (P < 0.05), increased haptoglobin (P < 0.05) and
   ceruloplasmin, and a slower increase of negative acute phase proteins
   (albumin, cholesterol, paraoxonase, vitamin A) after calving.
   Interferon-alpha-treated animals also showed a larger decrease of plasma
   glucose and greater values of NEFA, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and reactive
   oxygen metabolites. There also was evidence of IL-6 and tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha responses in both groups before calving with a quick
   decrease thereafter. The IL-6 response appeared in some animals
   regardless of the IFN-alpha treatment. Results indicate that low-dose
   IFN-alpha can sustain an inflammatory response in dairy cows and cause
   notable metabolic changes. This outcome might be explained by the
   repeated and extended interaction of IFN-alpha at low doses with the
   oral lymphoid tissues during rumination, as suggested by the observed
   stability of the cytokine in the rumen milieu; the final inflammatory
   effect could thus be as large as that of high doses. In addition, the
   antiflogistic signal of IFN-alpha might be counteracted and inverted by
   lymphocytes detected in the rumen liquor.},

Abstract = {Scrapie is a fatal, neurodegenerative disease of sheep and goats. It is
   also the earliest known member in the family of diseases classified as
   transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) or prion diseases, which
   includes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, bovine spongiform
   encephalopathy (BSE), and chronic wasting disease in cervids. The recent
   revelation of naturally occurring BSE in a goat has brought the issue of
   TSE in goats to the attention of the public. In contrast to scrapie, BSE
   presents a proven risk to humans. The risk of goat BSE, however, is
   difficult to evaluate, as our knowledge of TSE in goats is limited.
   Natural caprine scrapie has been discovered throughout Europe, with
   reported cases generally being greatest in countries with the highest
   goat populations. As with sheep scrapie, susceptibility and incubation
   period duration of goat scrapie are most likely controlled by the prion
   protein (PrP) gene (PRNP). Like the PRNP of sheep, the caprine PRNP
   shows significantly greater variability than that of cattle and humans.
   Although PRNP variability in goats differs from that observed in sheep,
   the two species share several identical alleles. Moreover, while the ARR
   allele associated with enhancing resistance in sheep is not present in
   the goat PRNP, there is evidence for the existence of other PrP variants
   related to resistance. This review presents the current knowledge of the
   epidemiology of caprine scrapie within the major European goat
   populations, and compiles the current data on genetic variability of
   PRNP.},

Abstract = {A low-dose treatment based on interleukin-2 (IL-2) was investigated for
   preventing mastitis in dairy cows. The treatment consisted of a single
   dose of IL-2 injected into the skin region drained by the supramammary
   lymph node 3-5 days after calving. The study included 45 cows (23
   treated and 22 controls) from three commercial dairy herds. The results
   showed that the treatment had no side effects. The treatment with IL-2
   induced the significant increase of several milk markers related to
   leukocyte and epithelial cell functions, i.e. SCC (somatic cell counts),
   serum amyloid A (SAA), lactoferrin and NAGase. The increased
   concentration of milk markers suggested also an activity of IL-2 on
   epithelial cells, resulting in a higher resistance to invading
   pathogens. Indeed, the increased efficiency of cells in the udder is
   supported by the higher frequency of healthy quarters observed in the
   treated group until day 17-19 after calving, in comparison with the
   control one. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Cyclosporine (CsA) is a universally used immunosuppressive drug which
   induces adverse side effects in several organs, but its impact on the
   heart is still controversial.
   Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs), such as HSP25 and alpha B-crystallin,
   are cytoprotective stress proteins exceptionally represented in the
   heart. They act as myofibrillar chaperones that help actin and desmin to
   maintain their optimum configuration and stability, thereby antagonizing
   oxidative damage. The present study examined: (1) the cardiac
   distribution and abundance of HSP25 and alpha B-crystallin in rats
   receiving CsA at a therapeutic dosage (15 mg/kg/day) for 42 days and 63
   days; (2) the presence of myofibrillar proteins, such as actin,
   alpha-actinin and desmin following the CsA treatments; (3) the
   subcellular effects of prolonged CsA exposure on the cardiomyocytes by
   histopathology and transmission electron microscopy. After 63 days CsA
   intake, sHSPs translocated from a regular sarcomeric pattern to
   peripheral sarcolemma and intercalated discs, together with actin and
   desmin. In contrast, the sarcomeric alpha-actinin pattern did not change
   in all experimental groups. The abundance of actin and HSP25 was
   unchanged in every time point of treatment while after 63 days CsA,
   alpha B-crystallin and desmin levels significantly decreased.
   Furthermore CsA induced fibrosis, irregular sarcomeric alignment and
   damaged desmosomes. These findings indicate that following prolonged CsA
   exposure, the cardiac muscle network was affected. In particular, the
   translocation of sHSPs to intercalated discs merits special
   consideration as a direct compensatory mechanism to limit CsA
   cardiotoxicity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Streptococcus suis, a major porcine pathogen, is emerging as a zoonotic
   agent capable of causing severe invasive disease in humans exposed to
   pigs or pork products. S. suis infection is rare in industrialised
   countries and usually arises as sporadic cases, with meningitis the most
   common clinical presentation in humans. Recent reports of two cases of
   meningitis in Sardinia and northeastern Italy prompted this first
   characterisation of Italian S. suis isolates. Fifty-nine S. suis
   strains, the two recent human strains and 57 swine clinical isolates
   collected between 2003 and 2007 from different Italian herds and
   regions, were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, PCR-screened for
   virulence and antibiotic resistance genes, and subjected to molecular
   typing. Phenotypic and genotypic analysis demonstrated an overall high
   genetic diversity among isolates, the majority of which were resistant
   to macrolides (78\%) and tetracyclines (90\%). The erm(B), tet(O),
   mosaic tet(O/W/32/O), tet(W), and tet(M) genes were detected. The
   tet(O/W/32/O) gene, the most frequent tet gene after tet(O), had never
   been described in the genus Streptococcus before. In addition, a
   virulent cps2, erm(B) tet(O) clone, belonging to sequence type 1 (ST1)
   of the ST1 complex, was found to be prevalent and persistent in Italian
   swine herds. Finally, the two human isolates (both ST1) carrying cps2,
   erm(B) and tet(W) were seen to be closely related to each other.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was the development and the evaluation of
   competitive ELISA assays based on monoclonal antibodies for the
   detection of antibodies specific for neuraminidase type 1 (N1), 2 (N2)
   and 3 (N3) in avian sera. A total of 1450 sera from different avian
   species (854 negative, 185 positive to NI, 136 positive to N2,219
   positive to N3 and 56 positive to other N subtypes sera) were analysed
   in parallel by the three ELISAs. ROC analyses were performed to enable
   the selection of best cut-off values and estimation of diagnostic
   specificity and sensitivity. In addition, the correlation between the
   new developed ELISAs and the neuraminidase inhibition test was evaluated
   on a limited number of sera. The validation process of the three ELISAs
   proved excellent diagnostic performances, with very high specificity and
   sensitivity, ranging from 99.4 to 99.8\% and from 97.6 to 100\%,
   respectively in the three assays. The discriminating potential between
   antibodies elicited against homologous and heterologous N validates the
   test for use in ``DIVA{''} assays, to distinguish between vaccinated and
   infected birds. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Specific antibodies are essential tools for studying proteins as well as
   for diagnostic research in biomedicine. The egg yolk of immunized
   chicken is an inexpensive source of high-quality polyclonal antibodies.
   The 12-kDa Parietaria judaica 2 allergen was expressed as a fusion
   protein and was used to immunize Leghorn chickens. In this paper, we
   show, using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting, that
   chicken antibodies raised against a recombinant allergen can be used to
   recognize similar proteins from a pollen raw extract. Allergen identity
   was confirmed by nanoLC-nanospray-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Our
   data demonstrate for the first time that a synergistic combination of
   molecular biology, 2-dimensional PAGE, and use of nonmammalian
   antibodies represents a powerful tool for reliable identification of
   allergens.},

Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {147-152},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Salmonella is an important pathogen in domestic livestock, for the
   severity of the disease mid the risk of transmission to humans. Signs of
   clinical salmonellosis in cattle can include septicaemia, diarrhoea and
   abortion. Salmonellosis can affect cattle of every age, although the
   clinical disease is more common in calves. Laboratory diagnosis can be
   performed with bacteriological culture, PCR or serology. The main risk
   for introduction of Salmonella infection in a farm is the purchasing of
   asymptomatic shedders, consequently all the new cattle introduced in the
   farm should be isolated for 3 weeks and tested with a bacteriological
   culture. Another important risk factor, associated with Salmonella
   entrance in dairy farm, is the environmental contamination by
   synanthropic animals. The control measures to be applied include
   minimizing the possibility of contacts between all these animals and the
   cattle, and the use of rodent proof and bird proof feed storage, to
   avoid faecal contamination of feed. When the infection is recognized in
   a farm, several control measures should be adopted, but they can be
   summarized in the following points: test all the cattle of the farm,
   clean and sanitize all the barns and the equipment, improve housing and
   management of cattle, initiate control programs for rodents, flies, and
   feral cats. These measures, that should be adopted during an outbreak,
   follow two paths: to apply the risk analysis to all the steps of farm
   activity, and to control the risk, changing the housing systems and the
   management activities that can increase the risk of wide spreading and
   persistence of Salmonella in the farm.},

Title = {Total reflection of x-ray fluorescence (TXRF): a mature technique for
   environmental chemical nanoscale metrology},
Journal = {MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2009},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Total reflection x-ray fluorescence (TXRF) is a technique well
   established for chemical analysis of samples deposited as a thin layer.
   Nowadays it is mainly employed for electronic industry quality control.
   Recently, very compact and economic TXRF instrumentation was proposed.
   Combining this with the capability to analyze liquid samples, this
   technique is suitable to be employed in many different applications,
   comprising the very critical field of environmental analysis.
   Comparisons with the standard atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS)
   technique show that TXRF is a practical, accurate, and reliable
   technique. Indeed, round-robin activities have already been started.
   Despite the efficiency and economy of the developed portable TXRF
   instrumentation, this is not widely employed for chemical laboratory
   analysis probably because TXRF is not an officially recognized
   technique, i.e. it is not yet normative-subjected. This fact could also
   be due to the long background of analytical applications developed for
   AAS, ICPS or inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) up to
   now. In this paper, we present a work of environmental monitoring of an
   industrial site, performed by means of bioindicators (lichens). The
   analysis of trace elements concentration in lichen was usually conducted
   with spectrophotometric techniques, such as AAS and ICP-MS, which were
   accepted by common regulations and normative-subjected. In this study,
   we accomplished a comparative lichen analysis by AAS and TXRF. The
   reproducibility of the obtained results showed the high correspondence
   between the two techniques. This comparison highlighted the versatility
   of the TXRF apparatus that allowed more rapid and simultaneous element
   detection. The obtained results suggested that this portable TXRF system
   could be suitable for regulation to produce certificated analysis upto
   ppb concentrations for some elements.},

Title = {Risk factors for highly pathogenic H7N1 avian influenza virus infection

Abstract = {In 1999-2000, Italian poultry production was disrupted by an H7N1 virus
   subtype epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). The
   objectives of the present study were to identify risk factors for
   infection on poultry farms located in regions that had the highest
   number of outbreaks (Veneto and Lombardia) and the impact of pre-emptive
   culling as a complementary measure for eradicating infection. A Cox
   regression model that included spatial factors, such as the G index, was
   used. The results confirmed the relationship between risk of infection
   and poultry species, production type and size of farms. The
   effectiveness of pre-emptive culling was confirmed. An increased risk of
   infection was observed for poultry farms located near an infected farm
   and those at altitudes less than 150 in above sea level. The measures
   for the control and eradication of AI virus infection need to consider
   species differences in susceptibility, the types of production and the
   density of poultry farms in the affected areas. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {On the alterations in serum concentration of somatotropin and

   a little studied recombinant bovine somatotropin},
Journal = {RESEARCH IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {A study was performed to delineate bST and IGF-1 variation, over a whole
   lactation, in cows treated with a nowadays widely commercialised but
   little studied sustained release formulation of recombinant bST. Total
   bST levels were found to be exceptionally high in the first days after
   administration, but decreased rapidly in the second week after
   injection. The increase in the IGF-1 serum concentration was significant
   for almost the entire biweekly cycle. Based on this study, the peaks of
   ST (often above 100 ng/ml) are considered particularly unlikely to be
   found in non-treated bovines, even under pathological conditions,
   especially when detected in a number of animals within a herd.
   Notwithstanding the great heterogeneity of results on this topic, these
   data suggest that tests against fraud involving the use of rbST in dairy
   products may be regarded as a feasible possibility. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {Goats were infected experimentally with a mycoplasma (the ``Irbid{''}
   strain) isolated previously from a goat with contagious agalactia in
   northern Jordan. The strain was unusual in that, although it had been
   identified by molecular methods as Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides
   LC/Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri, it showed no inhibition of growth
   by any of the hyperimmune rabbit antisera conventionally used to
   speciate members of the Mycoplasma mycoides cluster. Animals were
   infected either intratracheally or by aerosol and placed
   ``in-contact{''} with other goats. After 2 weeks, those infected
   intratracheally became febrile, showing a nasal discharge and slight
   conjunctivitis, followed a week later by respiratory distress and
   polyarthritis; lesions seen at necropsy included coagulative necrotic
   pneumonia, fibrinous pleurisy with pleural exudate, and inflammatory
   exudates, necrosis and fibrosis in the joints. Animals infected by
   aerosol showed much milder clinical signs, including nasal discharge and
   occasional swollen joints. In the ``in-contact{''} goats, seroconversion
   was first seen after 7 weeks, accompanied by coughing and laboured
   respiration; lesions in this group consisted of fibrinous pneumonia with
   focal areas of necrosis and abundant pleural exudate. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {The aim of this work was to develop and characterize new nanoparticle
   systems based on Eudragit RS 100 and cyclodextrins (CDs) for the
   transmucosal administration of glutathione (GSH). For this purpose,
   nano-particles (NPs) with the mucoadhesive properties of Eudragit RS 100
   and the penetration enhancing and peptide protective properties of CDs
   were prepared and evaluated. The quasi-emulsion solvent diffusion
   technique Was used to prepare the NPs with natural and chemically
   modified (HP-beta-CD and Me-beta-CD) CDs. The NPs prepared showed
   homogeneous size distribution, mean diameters between 99 and 156 rim, a
   positive net charge and spherical morphology. Solid state FT-IR, thermal
   analysis (DSC), and X-ray diffraction Studies Suggest that the
   nanoencapsuiation process produces a marked decrease in crystallinity of
   GSH. The encapsulation efficiency of the peptide was found to be between
   14.8\% and 24\%. The results indicate that mean diameters, surface
   charges and drug-loaded NPs were not markedly affected by the CD,
   whereas the presence of the latter influences drug release and to some
   extent peptide stability and absorption. Finally, it has been shown that

Abstract = {Escherichia coli 026 is known as a verocytotoxin-producing E. coli
   (VTEC) organism that causes severe foodborne diseases such as
   hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome. Although cattle are
   the most important reservoir of VTEC, only a few reports on the role of
   water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) as a reservoir of VTEC and on the
   presence of these organisms in their milk are available. However, in
   Southern Italy, where water buffalo are intensively reared, an outbreak
   of hemolytic uremic syndrome due to E. coli 026 has recently been
   reported, in which the consumption of typical dairy products was
   considered to be a common risk factor. The aims of this work were to
   assess the prevalence of E. coli 026 in raw water buffalo milk, to
   characterize the virulence gene profiles of the isolates, and to
   evaluate their phenotypic antimicrobial resistance pattern. Of 160
   analyzed samples, 1 (0.6\%) tested positive for E. coli O26, and the
   isolate showed the stx(1) (+)/stx(2)(+)/eae-/hlyA(+) genotypic profile.
   The strain showed resistance against glycopeptides, macrolides, and
   penicillins. The presence of VTEC organisms in raw water buffalo milk
   could be considered to be a potential threat to consumers; however, the
   strict adherence to the processes used in the preparation of the most
   common buffalo dairy products could strongly mitigate the foodborne
   risk. To our knowledge, this article reports the first isolation and
   characterization of E. coli 026 VTEC in raw water buffalo milk.},

   the time of diagnosis.
   Our results indicate that a higher quantity of Leishmania DNA was found

   for sampling Culicoides midges in bluetongue disease surveillance were
   used in phlebotomine monitoring. A total of 5698 sand flies were

Title = {Defining output-based standards to achieve and maintain tuberculosis
   freedom in farmed deer, with reference to member states of the European

Abstract = {Within the European Union (EU), detailed legislation has been developed
   for cattle, but not deer, to minimise disease risks associated with
   trade in animals and animal products. This legislation is expressed as
   input-based standards, providing a detailed outline of the activity
   required (for example, testing of animals and application of defined
   control measures), on the expectation that an adequate output (for
   example, confidence in freedom) will be achieved. Input-based standards
   are at odds with the increasing shift towards output-based standards,
   particularly in OIE rules governing international trade. In this paper,
   we define output-based standards to achieve and maintain freedom from
   tuberculosis (TB) in farmed deer, with reference to EU member states.
   After considering the probability of freedom achieved for cattle under
   existing EU legislation, we defined a `free farmed deer holding' as one
   with a probability of freedom from infection of at least 99\%. We then
   developed an epidemiological model of TB surveillance systems for deer
   holdings, incorporating different surveillance strategies, including
   combinations of diagnostic tests, and a variety of different scenarios
   relating to the potential for introduction of infection. A range of
   surveillance strategies were identified to achieve and maintain a free
   farmed deer holding, and worked examples are presented. The surveillance
   system sensitivity for varying combinations of screening and
   confirmatory tests in live animals, animals at slaughter and on-farm
   deaths is also presented. Using a single test at a single point in time,
   none of the TB tests routinely used in farmed deer is able to achieve an
   acceptable probability of TB freedom. If repeat testing were undertaken,
   an acceptable probability of TB freedom could be achieved, with
   differing combinations of the surveillance system sensitivity, frequency
   of testing and risk of introduction. The probability of introduction of
   infection through the importation of infected deer was influenced by the
   use of a pre-movement test (assumed 90\% test sensitivity and negative
   test results), the TB prevalence in the source herd and the number of
   animals imported. A surveillance system sensitivity of at least 81\% was
   achieved with different combinations of annual live animal surveillance
   and surveillance of animals at slaughter or on-farm deaths. This
   methodology has broad applicability and could also be extended to other
   diseases in both deer and other species with relevance to trade in
   animals and animal products. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by

   positive to L. interrogans serovar Hardjo (serogroup Sejroe) with a
   titre of 1:400. After serological confirmation an official Outbreak was
   declared and restrictions measures were put in place (D.P.R. 320/54,
   O.M. 4 settembre 1985). The active control of the outbreak included
   direct prophylaxis measures, serological monitoring, molecular and
   microbiological diagnosis on urine samples collected from serologically
   positive animals. Antibiotic therapy was administered to positive
   animals. Based on this acquired experience, our study suggests ail
   alternative approach for reducing the period of sanitary and restriction
   measures.},

Abstract = {The pathological isoform of the prion protein (PrPres) can serve as a
   marker for prion diseases, but more practical tests are needed for
   preclinical diagnosis and sensitive detection of many prion infections.
   Previously we showed that the quaking-induced conversion (QuIC) assay
   can detect sub-femtogram levels of PrPres in scrapie-infected hamster
   brain tissue and distinguish cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) samples from
   normal and scrapie-infected hamsters. We now report the adaptation of
   the QuIC reaction to prion diseases of medical and agricultural
   interest: human variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) and sheep
   scrapie. PrPres-positive and -negative brain homogenates from humans and
   sheep were discriminated within 1-2 days with a sensitivity of 10-100 fg
   PrPres. More importantly, in as little as 22 h we were able to
   distinguish CSF samples from scrapie-infected and uninfected sheep.
   These results suggest the presence of prions in CSF from
   scrapie-infected sheep. This new method enables the relatively rapid and
   sensitive detection of human CJD and sheep scrapie PrPres and may
   facilitate the development of practical preclinical diagnostic and
   high-throughput interference tests.},

Title = {Seasonal pattern of mortality and relationships between mortality and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {92},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The 2 studies described investigated seasonal variations of mortality
   and temperature-humidity index (THI)-mortality relationships in dairy
   cows. Mortality data were extracted from the Italian Bovine Spongiform
   Encephalopathy databases, which contain records on cows older than 24 mo
   that died on a farm from all causes (98\% of total records), were
   slaughtered in an emergency state, or were sent for normal slaughter but
   were sick in the preslaughter inspection (2\% of total records). Both
   studies evaluated mortality data during a 6-yr period ( 2002 to 2007).
   The seasonal pattern study was conducted throughout Italy and was based
   on 320,120 deaths. An association between season and deaths was found
   for all 6 yr. Summer and spring were the seasons with the highest and
   lowest frequency of deaths ( 15,773.3 +/- 2,861 and 11,619.3 +/- 792.3),
   respectively, and within summer months, the number of deaths in July and
   August ( 5,435 +/- 284 and 5,756 +/- 676.2, respectively) was higher
   than in June ( 4,839 +/- 344.8). The THI-mortality relationships study
   was carried out only for deaths ( 51,240) reported for the Lombardia and
   Emilia Romagna regions. For this study, the mortality databases were
   integrated with THI data, which were calculated by using data from 73
   weather stations. Each farm where deaths were recorded was assigned the
   THI values ( maximum and minimum) calculated at the closest weather
   station for each day the events ( deaths) were reported. Analysis of
   data indicated that approximate THI values of 80 and 70 were the maximum
   and minimum THI, respectively, above which the number of deaths in dairy
   farms starts to increase. Maximum and minimum THI values of 87 and 77
   were the upper critical THI above which the risk of death for dairy cows
   becomes maximum. This study defined quantitative relationships between
   mortality risk and THI in dairy cows and may help to provide emergency
   interventions and mitigation measures, which may ensure survival of
   dairy cows and reduce replacement costs associated with heat
   stress-related mortality.},

Abstract = {Topical administration of the antibacterial metronidazole (MET)
   represents the most common therapy in the treatment of bacterial
   vaginosis (BV). The formulations generally available for BV therapy are
   creams. gels, vaginal lavages and vaginal suppositories. In this study,
   a new dosage form, containing MET, was developed with the aim to realize
   vaginal mucoadhesive tablets by including bioadhesive polymers as
   chitosan (FG90C), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVPK90) and polycarbophil
   (PCPAA1), blended in different ratios. All formulations were
   characterized by studies of DSC, friability, hardness, hydration,
   mucoadhesion, in vitro release and antibacterial activity.
   All polymer mixtures employed were used to prepare tablets with the
   compactness and hardness so as allow the application on vaginal mucosa.
   FG90C performances improved in particular when mixed to PVPK90 (1:1
   ratio). This kind of delivery system is suitable for formulating MET for
   topical application representing a good alternative to traditional
   dosage forms for vaginal topical administration. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Palatine tonsils (PTs), together with ileal Peyer's patches, rank among
   the first colonization sites for infectious prions. After replicating in
   these lymphoid tissues, prions undertake the process of
   ``neuroinvasion,{''} which is likely mediated by the peripheral nerves
   connecting lymphoid tissues to the central nervous system (CNS). To
   study the connections between the tonsils and the CNS, we injected
   fluorescent tracers into the PTs of lambs; the highest number of Fast
   Blue (FB)-labeled neurons was found in cranial cervical ganglia (CCG),
   whereas a progressively decreasing number of cells were detected in
   proximal glossopharyngeal, proximal vagal, trigeminal, pterygopalatine,
   and cervicothoracic ganglia. Immunohistochemistry was carried out on
   tonsil and ganglia cryosections. Immunoreactivity (IR) for tyrosine
   hydroxylase (TH), dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH), neuronal nitric oxide
   synthase (nNOS), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P
   (SP), and calcium-binding protein S100 (S100), was observed in the
   fibers around and within PT lymphoid nodules. In the trigeminal,
   proximal glossopharyngeal and vagal ganglia the retrogradely-labeled
   neurons showed nNOS-, SP- and CGRP-IR. In all ganglia some
   retrogradely-labeled neurons showed nNOS-, SP- and CGRP-IR
   colocalization. It is worth noting that only 66 +/- 19\% and 75 +/- 13\%
   of retrogradely-labeled neurons in CCG showed TH- and DBH-IR,
   respectively. The present results allow us to attribute PT innervation
   mainly to the sympathetic component and to the glossopharyngeal, vagal
   and trigeminal cranial nerves. Furthermore, these data also provide a
   plausible anatomic route through which infectious agents, such as
   prions, may access the CNS, i.e. by traveling along several cranial and
   sympathetic nerves, as well as by migration via glial cells. (C) 2009

Abstract = {This study described the first report of BTV-16 in Croatia. Serological
   evidence occurred in cattle at the end of September and continued during
   October and November 2004. All positive animals were in the
   Dubrovnik-Neretva County, a region located in the southernmost part of
   Croatia. BTV-16 infection was also detected in goats and sheep. Apart
   from few cases reported in Greece between 1999 and 2000, BTV-16 has
   never been reported in the Balkanic peninsula before. The BTV strain was
   isolated from cattle blood samples and typed as BTV-16. When the S5 was
   sequenced, it showed 100\% homology with the BTV-16 vaccine isolate
   produced by Ondersterpoort Biological Product (SA) and used in Italy
   during the 2004 BT vaccination campaign. On the other hand no complete
   homology was found when the same RNA segment sequence was compared with
   that of the homologous Italian field isolate. As no evidence of
   livestock movements from Italy was demonstrated, an eolic transmission
   of the infection through infected Culicoides was hypothesised. According
   to the local meteostations, in several occasions, during the 2004 summer
   months, the west-east breeze blew with a speed above 50 km/h from Italy
   towards the Dubrovnik County. It is concluded that the BTV-16 which
   infected Croatian livestock was similar to the homologous OBP vaccine
   isolate and it is likely that it was introduced from Italy into the
   Southern regions of Croatia through infected Culicoides carried by the
   wind. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Food safety can be improved using ionizing radiation to reduce food
   spoilage and to extend its shelf life. The gas chromatography/mass
   spectrometry (GC/MS) has been validated by the European Community as a
   powerful method to identify irradiated food containing fat. The
   preliminary goals of our research were: (i) to set up this method, based
   on the detection of radiation induced 2-dodecylcyclobutanones (2-DCB) in
   pork muscle samples and (ii) to check the microbiological efficacy of
   the treatment. The main objective was to render the GC/MS a quantitative
   technique for dose estimation, through the measurement of the 2-DCB
   concentration in the irradiated sample. Our results show that the
   reduction of the microbial population is substantially reduced even at 2
   kGy, and that a clear identification of irradiated samples can be
   achieved also one month after irradiation at 2 kGy in frozen-stored
   samples. The 2-DCB concentration showed a linear dependence on dose in
   the range 1-10 kGy, no matter the origin of the sample; a unique
   calibration function was obtained, that allowed dose estimation in
   irradiated pork samples. A retrospective evaluation on the quality of
   the treatment could be carried out this way. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {To help identify an epidemiological link between the consumption of
   buffalo mozzarella prepared with raw milk (not heat-treated) and cases
   of human brucellosis, 80 samples of raw buffalo milk and 315 samples of
   mozzarella were tested for the presence of Brucella spp. Samples
   originated from Caserta, the province with the highest number of
   Brucella-positive buffalo herds in Campania, the region in which 96.02\%
   of all cases of human brucellosis reported in 2000-2005 were recorded.
   To take into account possible seasonal variations, between February 2006
   and March 2007, samples were purchased directly from 72 dairy outlets
   that were representative of the province. Samples were tested for
   Brucella spp. using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and bacterial
   isolation. Samples tested negative for Brucella using both methods.
   Spiked samples were then prepared and tested by PCR and bacterial
   isolation and the sensitivity, specificity, repeatability,
   reproducibility and limit of detection were determined. The PCR limit of
   detection was below 1 colony-forming unit (cfu)/g. The repeatability and
   reproducibility of the method were 100\%, (p = 0.95), the sensitivity
   was 96.7\% (p = 0.95) and the specificity was 100\% (p = 0.95).},

Abstract = {The present study describes the comparison between a modified
   agglutination test (MAT) and the indirect fluorescent antibody test
   (IFAT) for the detection of Toxoplasma specific IgG antibodies in dog
   and cat sera. MAT showed an ``almost perfect{''} agreement with IFAT in
   detecting positive and negative results in cat sera, where as only a
   ``substantial{''} agreement was observed in dog sera due to false
   negative results. Differences relative to sample dilution were recorded
   and serological titres obtained by MAT and IFAT are not directly
   comparable in cat and dog sera.},

Abstract = {A parasitologic study on 129 red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) from Tuscany
   (central Italy) was carried out in 2004-2006. Five intestinal species

   Mesocestoides lineatus (45.4\%), Uncinaria stenocephala (39.1\%),
   Toxocara canis (9.1\%), and Toxascaris leonina (5.4\%). Other parasites
   not associated with the intestine included Crenosoma vulpis (14.7\%),
   Capillaria aerophila (7.0\%), Angiostrongylus vasorum (7.0\%), and
   filarial parasites (17.8\%). Coprologic tests were less sensitive and
   less specific in identifying parasites than direct examinations at
   necropsy. Trichinella larvae were not found in muscles submitted to
   artificial digestion. By immunologic assay, antigens of Echinococcus
   spp. were detected in fecal samples of 20 foxes, but results could not
   be confirmed by fecal examination or molecular tests.},

Abstract = {Irradiation of chestnuts has recently been considered as an alternative
   treatment to fumigation to reduce the considerable amount of the product
   normally lost during post-harvest period. The treatment is allowed in
   countries such as Korea and, in view of a possible extension to European
   countries, to permit the legal controls as required by the directive
   1999/2/EC {[}European Parliament and Council Directive, 1999/2/EC, on
   the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning foods and
   food ingredients treated with ionising radiation. Official journal of
   the European Communities. L 66/16 of 13.3.1999] and meet consumer
   consensus, reliable methods for detecting irradiated chestnuts have to
   be proposed. The aim of the present work was to test the efficacy of the
   European Standard EN 13751, EN 1788, EN 1787 and EN 13708 in detecting
   irradiated chestnuts. For this purpose, six sets of ``Montella{''}
   chestnuts, a typical Italian variety recognized as a PGI (protected
   geographical indication), non-irradiated and irradiated at different
   doses in the 0.1-1 kGy range, were analysed by thermoluminescence (TL),
   photo-stimulated luminescence (PSL) (screening and calibrated PSL) and
   ESR techniques. PSL and TL analysis results revealed the low
   luminescence sensitivity of the chestnuts. Nevertheless, PSL screening
   data were in the intermediate band above the negative threshold (at all
   doses except at the lowest one) and TL analysis led to correct positive
   classifications even at the lowest dose tested (0.15 Gy). On the
   contrary, no radio-induced ESR signal could be registered with the
   irradiated samples of chestnut shell or pulp. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Effect of unsaturated fatty acid supplementation on performance and milk
   fatty acid profile in dairy cows fed a high fibre diet},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {The influence of unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) supplement on productive
   performance, physiochemical properties and fatty acid (FA) profile of
   milk, was investigated in lactating dairy cows fed with high fibre
   diets. According to a cross-over design, twelve cows were assigned to
   two experimental settings characterized by different FA profiles. Cows
   received a high fibre diet (similar to 42\% NDF on DM basis)
   supplemented with soybean based mixtures with these FA compositions:
   92.0\% of saturated FA (SFA), 2.8\% of monounsaturated FA (MUFA) and
   5.2\% of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) in the control diet (C-diet); 19.1\%
   of SFA, 20.9\% of MUFA and 60.0\% of PUFA in the experimental diet
   (E-diet).
   The E-diet did not affect dry matter intake nor milk yield. Milk
   composition and coagulation traits resulted similar between treatments,
   except for the lactose level, which was lower in the E-diet (5.0 vs
   4.8\%; P<0.05) and the freezing point (-0.546 vs -0.535 degrees C;
   P<0.05). As respects the milk FA profile, the E-diet significantly
   increased the percentage of UFA because of their greater amount in the
   ration; however the ``transfer{''} of UFA in milk was limited by the
   high level of FA biohydrogenation (BH) at the ruminal level. UFA showed
   low values of carry over in milk (67.5 vs 39.7\%; P<0.001) due to the
   saturation process; on the contrary SFA had a threefold increment (124
   vs 323\%; P<0.001), mostly due to a peak in the production of stearic
   acid. In this study, the percentage of CLA in milk (0.50 vs 0.62\%;
   P<0.05) was quite low for both diets, if compared with other studies,
   and this was probably due to a low vaccenic acid supply at duodenal
   level.},

Abstract = {The present study was aimed at developing a SYBR Green (TM)-based
   real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for a rapid
   differentiation of the genotype G1 from the cluster of genotypes G2/G3
   of Echinococcus granulosus, using as marker the 12S mtDNA gene. Eleven
   hydatid cysts from water buffaloes and 19 from cattle were used.
   Fourteen samples (identified as G1 using sequencing) showed a mean
   melting temperature (T (m)) of 76.4A degrees C and 16 samples
   (identified as G2/G3 using sequencing) showed a mean T (m) of 77.0A
   degrees C. The detected mean difference of the T (m) of 0.6A degrees C
   between G1 and G2/G3 genotypes might allow a fast and simple
   discrimination of these genotypes. In conclusion, the real-time PCR
   developed in the present study provides a powerful tool for molecular
   studies on E. granulosus with possibilities for extension to other
   genotypes using different molecular targets.},

Abstract = {A total of 1020 crossbreed rabbits were individually examined to

   behaviourally from the application of the current to death. The stunning
   system was incorrectly applied one hundred and ten times (10.8\%). Three
   rabbits failed to be stunned and were still conscious at sticking.
   Eighteen rabbits recovered before the onset of death, as shown by their
   corneal reflex and in a few cases, vocalization (n=3) and head movement
   (n=1) were observed. Corneal reflex seemed to be the best indicator of

Abstract = {Samples of conventional (n = 11) and organic (n = 81) milk, both raw and
   heat-treated, were analysed for the presence of synthetic antioxidants
   (butylated hydroxytoluene, butylated hydroxyanisole, dodecyl gallate,
   propyl gallate and octyl gallate) to verify whether those labelled as
   ``organic{''} corresponded to EU Regulations on the use of additives in
   such products. The analysis detected only the antioxidant BHT and its
   aldehyde BHT-CHO in all 11 conventional milk and in 18 of 81 organic
   milk Samples. The investigation highlights the importance of strict
   control of organic dairy production, since synthetic antioxidants added
   to feedstuff to prevent rancidity can be transferred to milk. (C) 2008

Abstract = {Toroviruses are emergent viruses, belonging to the Nidovirales order,
   that remain mostly ignored, despite they are able to infect different
   species of domestic animals and humans, causing enteric diseases and
   diarrhea. Thus far, only five variants of porcine torovirus (PToV) have
   been identified. In this report we describe the identification and
   partial characterization of a new strain of porcine torovirus
   (PToV-BRES) that was detected by RT-PCR in a swine faecal specimen from
   a farm in Brescia (Italy). The complete genes coding for the
   nucleocapsid (N), hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) and membrane (M) proteins
   were amplified, and sequence analysis showed that PToV-BRES is a new
   PToV strain that, based on the HE gene sequence, is phylogenetically
   related to P4 strain, that was up to now the only member of a distinct
   PToV lineage. The nucleocapsid protein from PToV-BRES was expressed in
   insect cells as a his-tagged protein, purified by affinity
   chromatography and used to develop an ELISA method to detect antibodies
   against PToV. This assay was evaluated using a serum collection
   including 45 samples from three commercial farms from Spain. High
   antibody prevalence against PToV was observed in the three farms, both
   in adult animals and in piglets, which could suggest that PToV might be
   endemic in Spanish porcine population. The ELISA method developed in
   this work could be useful in future epidemiological surveys about
   toroviruses. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Papillomas and fibropapillomas may occur in the skin and in different
   organs in animals. Ten different genotypes of bovine papillomavirus
   (BPV) have been identified. BPV-1 through BPV-10 are all strictly
   species-specific, but BPV-1/2 may also infect other species such as
   equids, inducing fibroblastic tumors. BPV-1 and BPV-2 are associated
   with fibropapillomas in cattle; these tumors are formed by excessive
   proliferation of virus-infected dermal fibroblasts and epidermal
   keratinocytes. Nine water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) were examined for
   the presence of multiple cutaneous and perivulvar tumors. Cutaneous and
   perivulvar fibropapillomatosis were confirmed histologically.
   Negative-stain transmission electron microscopic examination revealed
   papillomavirus-like particles in the fibropapillomas, and papillomaviral
   DNA was also detected by the polymerase chain reaction. The amplified
   long control region (LCR) DNA sequence was identical to that of BPV-1.
   The BPV-1 E5 oncoprotein was strongly expressed in the tumor cells thus
   confirming a causal role of the virus. This article represents the first
   report of cutaneous, perivulvar, and vulvar fibropapilloma associated
   with BPV-1 infection in the water buffalo and describes another example
   of cross-species infection by BPV-1.},

Abstract = {Synthetic peptides were generated, corresponding to SU5 domain of
   envelope glycoprotein of Italian SRLV isolates It-561 and It-Pi1,
   belonging respectively to MVV- and CAEV-Iike genotypes. The peptides,
   encompassing an N-terminal variable and a C-terminal conserved
   antibody-binding site, were used in an ELISA assay to analyse the sera
   of two groups of sheep experimentally infected with these isolates. The
   kinetics and specificity of the humoral response to the homologous and
   heterologous antigen and the affinity maturation of the sera were
   evaluated. Seroconversion occurred between week 3 and 8. The response to
   SU5 antigen was mostly type-specific. The few broadly reacting sera may
   reflect the production of antibodies directed to the SU5 constant
   antibody-binding site. All sera underwent with time avidity maturation,
   resulting in the appearance of high affinity antibodies. This study
   suggests constant monitoring of the circulating viral variants to
   develop a panel of diagnostic peptides representative of local
   genotypes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Chlamydophila (C.) abortus is the causative agent of ovine enzootic
   abortion with zoonotic potential whose epidemiology has been held back
   because of the obligate intracellular habitat of the bacterium. In the
   present study, we report on a molecular typing method termed multiple
   loci variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) Analysis (MLVA) for
   exploring the diversity of C abortus. An initial analysis performed with
   34 selected genetic loci on 34 ruminant strains including the variant
   Greek strains LLG and POS resulted in the identification of five
   polymorphic loci, confirming the widely held notion that C. abortus is a
   very homogeneous species. Analysis of additional 111 samples with the
   selected five loci resulted in the classification of all strains into
   six genotypes with distinct molecular patterns termed genotypes {[}1]
   through {[}6]. Interestingly. the classification of the isolates in the
   six genotypes was partly related to their geographical origin. Direct
   examination of clinical samples proved the MLVA to be suitable for
   direct typing. Analysis of the genomic sequences in six C. abortus
   prototypes of amplicons generated with each of the five selected VNTR
   primers revealed that variation between genotypes was caused by the
   presence or absence of coding tandem repeats in three loci.
   Amplification of Chlamydophila psittaci reference strains with the five
   selected VNTR primers and of the six C abortus prototype strains with
   the eight VNTR primers established for the typing of C psittaci

   Chlamydophila psittaci by multilocus VNTR analysis (MLVA). Infect.
   Genet. Evol. 8(2),171-181] showed that both MLVA typing systems were
   species-specific when all respective VNTR primer sets were used.
   In conclusion, the newly developed MLVA system provides a highly
   sensitive, high-resolution and easy-to-perform tool for the
   differentiation of C abortus isolates of different origin, which is
   suitable for molecular epidemiological studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

   South America where bovids harbour no theilerids. The second technique,
   which is suitable for the diagnosis of both babesiosis and theileriosis
   worldwide, involves fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)
   probes. In FRET assays, Babesia bovis, B. divergens, Babesia sp. (B.
   major or B. bigemina), Theileria annae and Theileria sp. were all
   identifiable based on the melting temperatures of their amplified
   fragments. Both techniques provided linear calibration curves over the
   0.1 fg/mu l to 0.01 ng/mu l DNA range. The assays showed good
   sensitivity and specificity. To assess their performance, both
   procedures were compared in two separate studies: the first was intended
   to monitor the experimental infection of calves with B. bovis and the
   second was a survey where 200 bovid/equine DNA samples from different
   countries were screened for piroplasmids. Comparative studies showed
   that duplex TaqMan qPCR was more sensitive than FRET qPCR in the
   detection of babesids. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {When outbreaks of avian influenza (AI) occur in poultry populations, the
   main goal to achieve is the control and eradication of the infection.
   However, quantitative information on risk factors for AI spread and
   efficacy of AI control measures such as vaccination in the field is
   limited. From 2000 to 2005, H5 and H7 low pathogenicity (LP) AI viruses
   caused four epidemics in poultry in northeastern Italy. Italian
   veterinary authorities implemented emergency vaccination in the
   2000-2001 and 2002-2003 LPAI epidemics and prophylactic vaccination from
   July 2004.
   The aim of this study is to quantitatively evaluate the efficacy of AI
   vaccination in the field, taking into account the different strategies
   (emergency and prophylactic) implemented, Moreover, risk factors for
   LPAI spread in domestic poultry were studied.
   By survival analysis, we observed a two-fold increase in survival
   probability for vaccinated poultry farms compared to unvaccinated ones.
   In meat turkeys, vaccination protocols changed in the different
   epidemics, and a relationship between protection and the number of
   vaccinations was observed; two or three vaccine administrations
   protected flocks from LPAI, whilst four administrations did not
   significantly reduce the risk of infection.
   In meat turkeys the risk of AI infection increased also with the
   increase in both farm size and proximity to an infected farm. In
   general, we observed a lower number of outbreaks and a faster
   eradication of the infection when LPAI viruses introduced in a
   preventively vaccinated poultry population.
   This study provides insights on LPAI vaccination efficacy and on risk
   factors involved in LPAI infection at farm level. To our knowledge, this
   is the first study which quantitatively evaluates AI vaccination
   efficacy and compares different vaccination strategies and protocols
   using field data. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {To investigate the male genetic legacy of the Arab rule in southern
   Europe during medieval times, we focused on specific Northwest African
   haplogroups and identified evolutionary close STR-defined haplotypes in
   Iberia, Sicily and the Italian peninsula. Our results point to a higher
   recent Northwest African contribution in Iberia and Sicily in agreement
   with historical data. southern Italian regions known to have experienced
   long-term Arab presence also show an enrichment of Northwest African
   types. The forensic and genomic implications of these findings are

Abstract = {A 1-year study on the animal-level prevalence and concentration of
   Escherichia coli O157 in adult sheep at slaughter was performed, to
   collect qualitative and quantitative information on the diffusion of the
   pathogen in adult sheep from Italy. A total 533 samples were collected,
   with a similar distribution in the four seasons. For prevalence
   estimates, a simple random sampling technique was used. An
   immuno-magnetic separation technique was used for sample screening, with
   enumeration of the pathogen in positive samples, along with molecular
   and serological identification of isolates. An overall prevalence of
   7.1\% (38/533, 95\% CI 4.9-9.3\%) was observed for fully virulent E.
   coli O157. A wide interval of VTEC O157 per gram was observed (< 100 to
   6 x 10(5) CFU g(-1)), with 28.9\% (11/38) of positive samples >= 1 x
   10(3) CFU g(-1), set as the threshold for those animals defined `active
   shedders' for the purpose of the study. Eight per cent (3/38) of animals
   shed > 1 x 10(4) g(-1) VTEC O157, which represents > 96\% of the total
   VTEC O157 bacteria cultured from all animals tested. The prevalence
   estimate of active shedders was therefore 2.1\% (95\% CI 0.9-3.3\%).
   Most (34/38, 89.5\%) of the positive animals were found in summer
   (July-September). Prevalence and concentrations of virulent VTEC O157
   obtained in this study contribute to the demonstration that adult sheep
   represent a relevant source of environmental contamination from virulent
   VTEC O157, as well as a source of VTEC O157 contamination for food of
   ovine origin (meat and dairy products), especially during warm months.},

Abstract = {The prevalence of intra-mammary infections in dairy herds was studied in
   Hamdallaye, Niger. A total of 956 milk samples were collected in 2007
   from 239 lactating cows of four local breeds in eight traditional herds;
   the first sampling was undertaken in the dry season at morning milking,
   and the second in the rainy season at evening milking. Staphylococcus
   aureus, Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci (CNS) and environmental
   microorganisms were detected in significantly (p < 0.05) more samples in
   the rainy season, 55.2\%, than in the dry season, 27.1\%. Statistically
   significant (P < 0.05) differences in prevalence were observed among
   herds and according to lactation number. Infections were assigned to
   four classes, according to the major pathogen, and the respective mean
   somatic cell counts during the dry season were: S. aureus, 775 x 10(3)
   cells/ml; CNS, 447 x 10(3) cells/ml; environmental microorganisms, 407 x
   10(3) cells/ml; and non-infected, 262 x 10(3) cells/ml. Most of the
   tested strains were sensitive to antibiotics, and selected strains of S.
   aureus (n = 15) were negative to the multiplex PCR tests for production
   of enterotoxins.},

Abstract = {Red mite field populations from seven naturally infested Italian caged
   laying poultry farms were investigated for their susceptibility to
   acaricide formulations available on the market, containing amitraz,
   carbaryl and permethrin. A minimum of 3,000 mites of all stages were
   collected from each farm and were tested with five acaricide
   concentrations (5, 10, 20, 50, 100\%) plus an untreated control (0\%).
   Field red mite populations were found to be tolerant even with the
   highest concentrations with carbaryl and permethrin for six (86\%) and
   three (42\%) of the investigated farms, respectively (P < 0.05).
   Furthermore, six (86\%) of the investigated farms showed a red mite
   population susceptible to amitraz at any concentration. Out of the seven
   field populations tested with amitraz, one population is becoming less
   tolerant whereas another was the most tolerant to carbaryl and
   permethrin at any concentration. Data show that the lack of
   effectiveness of some acaricides is spreading in Europe and call for the
   adoption of alternative management strategies to avoid development of
   resistance.},

Abstract = {Seafood and clinical samples collected in Italy during 2006 were
   analyzed to evaluate prevalence. serological and virulence properties of
   non-O1 non-O139 Vibrio cholerae (NCV) isolates. Biochemical and
   serological characterization of the strains was performed by
   standardized procedures while virulence properties of NCVs were assayed
   by molecular, in vivo and in vitro toxicological methods. Of the 300
   seafood samples examined, including mussel, cod, mackerel, anchovy,
   clam, prawn and cuttle-fish, 5.6\% were positive for NCVs: 4.7\% and
   8.5\% from local and imported seafood, respectively. The prevalence of
   NCVs was highest in prawn (16.6\%) and mussel (7.7\%). Of 58
   hospitalized patients that presented acute diarrhea, 3.4\% eliminated
   NCVs in stools 2448 h after consumption of seafood. All NCVs had TOR and
   hlyAET genes but lacked ctxA, zot. and tcpA genes. One isolate from
   prawn had stn/sto gene. All strains were hemolytic, cytotoxic, and able
   to induce intestinal and extraintestinal effects on the suckling mouse
   model. Our results confirm that non-toxigenic NCVs that express the gene
   encoding El Tor-like hemolysin can be isolated from patients suffering a
   cholera-like syndrome after consumption of seafood. This evidence along
   with the virulence and enteropathogenicity of all the ctxA(-) tcpA(-)
   zot(-) stn/sto(-) hlyAET(+) NCV isolates in the experimental model,
   suggest that El Tor-like hemolysin may play an important role in human
   pathogenesis. Moreover, the isolates from seafood showed molecular,
   biological and enzymatic patterns similar to those isolated from
   clinical samples, underlining that environmental NCVs; are potentially
   able to induce human infections and confirming the important role of
   seafood as a vehicle of V cholerae diseases. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The genetics of the prion protein gene (PRNP) play a crucial role in
   determining the relative susceptibility to transmissible spongiform
   encephalopathies (TSEs) in several mammalian species. To determine the
   PRNP gene variability in European red deer (Cervus elaphus), roe deer
   (Capreolus capreolus) and chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra), the PRNP open
   reading frame from 715 samples was analysed to reveal a total of ten
   single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In red deer, SNPs were found in
   codons; 15, 21, 59, 78, 79, 98, 136, 168 and 226. These polymorphisms
   give rise to 12 haplotypes, and one of which is identical to the PRNP of
   American wapiti (Rocky Mountain elk, Cervus elaphus nelsoni). One silent
   mutation at codon 119 was detected in chamois and no SNPs were found in
   roe deer. This analysis confirmed that European wild ruminants have a
   PRNP genetic background that is compatible with TSE susceptibility,
   including chronic wasting disease.},

   workloads in Standardbred horses. Ten clinically healthy horses were
   divided into two equal groups, taking part in an official trot race at

   from each horse at rest, after warm up, 0, 30 and 60 min after the end
   of the race. Serum concentrations of albumin, globulins, total proteins,
   total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, hydroxybutyrate, urea,
   creatinine, creatine kinase (CK), glutamate pyruvate transaminases (GPT)
   and glutamate oxalacetate transaminases (GOT) were assessed. Exercise
   increased triglyceride, glucose, creatinine and CK and decreased GOT
   which tended to reach rest level 60 min after exercise. Globulins were
   affected by exercise but there was no set pattern.},

Abstract = {Currently, hepatitis A virus (HAV) detection is not yet included in the
   regulation provided for food safety controls. However, the 2073/2005/EC
   regulation on microbiological criteria applied to food takes into
   account the sanitary issue as to viral contamination of food but
   postpones the definition of specific criteria for pathogenetic virus
   detection until reliable analytical methods are available. In this
   study, a PCR-based method for detection of HAV was subjected to a
   validation process in order to describe its performance and to check its
   reliability for shellfish monitoring. Shellfish were processed for virus
   recovery through PEG8000-mediated sedimentation. Viral RNA extraction
   was carried out with a commercial kit and extracted RNA was then
   subjected to a reverse transcriptase heminested PCR (rt-heminested PCR).
   Foetal rhesus monkey kidney (FRhK4) cell culture infected with HAV
   worked as positive control in the assay: so, also supernatant from
   infected FRhK4 cells was subjected to a parallel validation process,
   starting to RNA extraction. The validation process was carried out by
   establishing qualitative and semi-quantitative parameters concerning
   accuracy, precision, analytical specificity and sensitivity (limit of
   detection, LOD), robustness and stability. The HAV detection method for
   shellfish and supernatant from infected FRhK4 cells showed 100\%
   accuracy and precision. It has proved robust and stable; the LOD of
   rt-heminested PCR was estimated as nine genomic copies of DNA target.
   The validation process has objectively demonstrated that the HAV
   detection method on shellfish has good performance, so it might be
   applied with enough reliability in food safety official controls.},

Abstract = {Recent surveys and sample collection have confirmed the endemicity of
   Dermanyssus gallinae in poultry farming worldwide. The reduction in
   number and efficacy of many acaricide products has accentuated the
   prevalence rates of this poultry ectoparasite observed more often in non
   intensive systems such as free-range, barns or backyards and more often
   in laying hens than in broiler birds. The lack of knowledge from
   producers and the utilisation of inadequate, ineffective or illegal
   chemicals in many countries have been responsible for the increase in
   infestation rates due to the spread of acaricide resistance. The costs
   for control methods and treatment are showing the tremendous economic
   impact of this ectoparasite on poultry meat and egg industries. This
   paper reviews the prevalence rates of this poultry pest in different
   countries and for different farming systems and the production
   parameters which could be linked to this pest proliferation.},

Abstract = {The Mesola red deer Cervus elaphus in the Po delta are the only native
   red deer population on the Italiall mainland and have been the focus of
   conservationists and wildlife biologists for some time. In our study. we
   present a genetic analysis of 25 Mesola red deer on the basis of 20
   polymorphic microsatellite loci, aiming at estimating the population's
   genetic diversity and at providing information for a future genetic
   screening. In addition. we carried Out a population viability analysis
   (PVA) with demographic and life-history data available from a long-term
   population survey, simulating different management scenarios. Genetic
   diversity was very low compared to the rest of Europe (observed and
   expected heterozygosity 0.50 and 0.61, respectively), and all overall
   excess of homozygosity was indicative of inbreeding. Calculations of the
   probability of identity and genotype mismatch frequencies suggested that
   between five and seven highly informative loci were sufficient to
   resolve individuals With reasonable certainly. The PVA yielded a
   gencrally poor Outlook, but at the same time, it showed that management
   measures already taken significantly increased population viability. A
   sensitivity analysis revealed that inbreeding depression and possible
   catastrophes had a huge impact on the population's prospects. However,
   the establishment of two subpopulations and successful attempts at
   re(reducing the consequences of catastrophic events were able to
   significantly mitigate the harmful effects of both inbreeding and
   environmental stochasticity. These results, in particular the splitting
   of population, may be of general interest to conservationists dealing
   with unique threatened populations},

Title = {Prion protein genotypes of Italian sheep breeds with lysine-171 and

Journal = {VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {137},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {18-23},
Month = {MAY 28},
Abstract = {Amino acid polymorphisms of the prion protein gene influence sheep
   susceptibility to classical and atypical scrapie. Substitutions at
   codons 136, 154 and 171 play an important role in classical scrapie.
   Codon 141 leucine to phenylalanine mutation (AFRQ) has been recognized
   as an increased risk factor for atypical scrapie. In addition a rare
   allele with lysine at codon 171 (ARK) has been detected in Mediterranean
   sheep breeds. The presence of ARK poses two problems: the determination
   of its frequency and its possible interference with genotyping output of
   routine methods lacking specific detection capacity for ARK. The aim of
   our work was the development of a routine genotyping method with the
   capacity to identify ARK and AFRQ in addition to the normally detected
   alleles and to determine the frequencies of all these alleles in 5 main
   Italian breeds: Sarda (n=2494), Bergamasca (n=2686), Appenninica
   (n=297), Comisana (n=361) and Massese (n = 402). A multiplex primer
   extension assay targeting the six single nucleotide polymorphisms of
   interest was developed. Allele frequencies revealed a very low level of
   ARR in Bergamasca (6.91\%) as opposed to the other breeds, very diverse
   levels of AFRQ ranging from absence in Comisana to 10.70\% in Massese
   and a restricted presence of ARK. This allele has only been detected in
   Bargamasca with a significant 3.67\% and marginally in Appenninica
   (0.34\%). These results underline the need for adequate routine methods
   for genotyping of breeds with alleles that can interfere with typing of
   important codons such as the case of ARK for codon 171. (C) 2008

Abstract = {The aim of this research was to study the biodiversity of lactic acid
   bacteria (LAB) in marinated seafood salad (pH 5.0) and their interaction
   on the growth of Listeria monocytogenes. LAB were highly present in the
   samples considered in this study, reaching values of 8.0 log cfu/g at
   the end of product's shelf-life. A high biodiversity in terms of LAB
   species and strains was detected by means of RAPD-PCR within the 171
   bacterial isolates collected. Among them Lactobacillus curvatus,
   Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and Enterococcus were present in all the
   salad batches considered. Three challenge tests against L. monocytogenes
   were carried out in order to assess the growth of this pathogen in the
   presence of dominant populations of LAB. L. monocytogenes tended to
   decrease in time, suggesting that a stable concentration of LAB inhibits
   the development of this pathogenic micro-organism. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {Malignant mixed Mullerian tumor (MMMT) is a rare neoplasm of the female
   genital tract. We report a case of bilateral ovarian MMMT in a
   10-year-old female dog. Ovaries were only moderately enlarged with a
   papillary surface and firm nodules. Multiple metastases were observed in
   the abdominal cavity and pulmonary parenchyma. Histologically, both
   ovaries had intermingled carcinomatous and sarcomatous components with
   cartilage and bone. Metastatic lesions were not mixed. The peritoneal
   metastases were carcinomatous; pulmonary metastases were sarcomatous.
   Carcinomatous elements of the MMMT were immunohistochemically positive
   for cytokeratin (CK) AE1/AE3, CK7, and vimentin and estrogen receptors.
   Conversely, the sarcomatous cells were positive for vimentin, but
   negative for CKs. Chondrocytes also expressed S-100 protein. On the
   basis of similarities to human ovarian MMMT, the diagnosis was
   heterologous malignant mixed Mullerian tumor of the ovary.},

Abstract = {Laboratory analyses represent a key element in veterinary medicine
   diagnosis providing objective information about the health status of a
   patient. Analytic data are interpreted by comparing them with a specific
   reference intervals previously determined on a reference Population of
   healthy animals. The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry
   recommends the use of nonparametric methods and, as a consequence, a
   reference sample of at least 120 healthy subjects, to obtain reliable
   reference intervals. Such order of magnitude for the reference sample is
   not always feasible especially if the laboratory variable under study is
   affected by several sources of variation, e.g., environmental
   conditions, physiological status of the animal, age, or gender. A
   convenient method to estimate reference intervals should be able to
   avoid assumptions on the probability distribution of the considered
   variable and produce robust results even with a limited sample size.
   This study presents a new statistical approach, based on data bootstrap,
   to estimate reference intervals for 12 blood biochemical variables in
   Sarda dairy sheep. The method was applied to real and simulated data
   from 120 to 40 animals. The reference intervals calculated with the new
   method remained quite constant as sample size decreased from 120 down to
   60 animals, and became wider with fewer individuals. So, a minimum
   threshold of 60 animals Could be considered a good limit to obtain
   reliable reference intervals for blood biochemical variables in Sarda
   dairy sheep. Moreover, comparisons between results from real and
   simulated data suggested that the method could be also applied to other
   laboratory variables. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A 2-year, cross-sectional study was conducted to identify risk factors
   for Cryptosporidium sp. infection in bovine farms in central Italy.
   Faecal samples were collected on 248 farms, from 2024 calves and
   analysed using ELISA and immunofluorescent assay (IFA) commercial kits.
   In all 101 samples confirmed to be positive with IFA, the aetiological
   agent was identified as Cryptosporidium parvumand a large genetic
   variability was detected by subtype analysis. The prevalence of farm
   infection ranged from 3.4\% to 35.6\%. Univariate analysis showed a
   number of putative risk factors, including the type of farm, stalling of
   calves, late supply of colostrum, number of heads and contact between
   calves and adults. However, multivariate analysis confirmed that the
   higher risk for calves was associated with housing calves separately
   from their dams, a characteristic practice of dairy herd, whereas calves
   being nursed by their dams, a characteristic of cow-calf herd resulted
   as a protective factor.},

Abstract = {Cyanobacteria, also called blue-green algae, occur worldwide within
   water blooms in eutrophic lakes and drinking water reservoirs, producing
   several biotoxins (cyanotoxins). Among these, microcystins (MCs) are a
   group of cyclic heptapeptides showing potent hepatotoxicity and activity
   as tumour promoters. So far, at least 89 MCs from different
   cyanobacteria genera have been characterised. Herein, ion trap,
   matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight (MALDI-ToF)
   and quadruple time-of-flight (Q-ToF) mass spectrometry (MS)-based
   methods were tested and compared for analysing MCs in freshwaters.
   Method performances in terms of limit of detection, limit of
   quantification, mean recoveries, repeatability, and specificity were
   evaluated. In particular, a liquid chromatography/electrospray
   ionisation (LC/ESI)-Q-ToF-MS/MS method was firstly described to analyse
   MCs in freshwaters; this technique is highly selective and sensitive,
   and allowed us to characterise the molecular structure of an unknown
   compound. Indeed, the full structural characterisation of a novel
   microcystin variant from a bloom of Planktothrix rubescens in the Lake
   Averno, near Naples, was attained by the study of the fragmentation
   pattern. The new cyanotoxin was identified as the 9-acetyl-Adda variant
   of microcystin-RR. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {The Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) of the European Food
   Safety Authority provides scientific and technical advice to the risk
   managers, mainly the European Commission, in all matters related to food
   safety and foodborne diseases, including foodborne zoonoses and
   transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, microbiology, food hygiene
   and associated waste management. The scope of this review is to present
   an overview of the scientific opinions issued by the BIOHAZ Panel on
   foodborne zoonoses during its first mandate (2003-2006). Zoonoses are
   diseases or infections that are transmissible from animals to humans
   either directly or through ingestion of contaminated foodstuffs. The
   most frequently reported zoonotic diseases in humans in the EU are
   salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis. During the past decades
   trichinellosis has been described as an emerging and/or re-emerging
   disease. In order to improve public health and to prevent these diseases
   from occurring, it is important to identify which animals and foodstuffs
   are the main sources of the infections and which intervention strategies
   would be most effective. The European Commission follows a scientific
   evidence-based approach to managing the risks of zoonotic agents
   throughout the food chain based on the risk assessments produced from
   the BIOHAZ Panel. This leads to the development and enforcement of
   legislation and/or other measures on zoonoses and zoonotic agents.},

Abstract = {Effective surveillance of bovine tuberculosis (BTB) in developing
   countries where reliable data on disease prevalence is scarce or absent
   is a precondition for considering potential control options. We
   conducted a Slaughterhouse survey to assess for the first time the
   burden of BTB in Southern Chad. Altogether, 954 slaughter animals were
   consecutively sampled and tested using the single intra-dermal
   comparative cervical tuberculin (SICCT) test, a recently developed
   fluorescence polarization assay (FPA) and routine abattoir meat
   inspection after Slaughter. Gross visible lesions were detected in
   11.3\% (CI: 9.4-13.5\%) of the animals examined and they were mostly
   located in the lymph nodes and the lung. Significantly more Mbororo
   zebus (15.0\%) were affected by lesions than Arab zebus (9.9\%; OR =
   2.20, CI: 1.41-3.41\%; p < 0.001). Of all animals tested, 7.7\% (CI:
   6.2-9.6\%) reacted positively to SICCT if OIE guidelines were applied.
   However, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis using
   Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) infected animals as the
   positive population and lesion negative animals as the negative
   population, revealed a better SICCT performance if the cut-off value was
   decreased to >2 mm. SICCT reactor prevalence rose to 15.5\% (CI:
   13.3-18.0\%) and FPA did not perform better than SICCT, when this
   setting adapted cut-off was applied. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   analysis were Used to plan the sampling, procedures, to display the
   results as maps and to detect Spatial clusters of helminths ill the
   study area. The survey Was conducted OF) 127 water buffalo farms, which
   were selected ill the study area using a grid sampling approach,
   followed by proportional allocation. Faecal samples (n. = 1,883)
   collected from the 127 farms were examined using the Flotac dual
   technique. Gastrointestinal strongyles were the most frequent helminths
   (33.1\%) oil the tested farms, followed by the liver fluke Fasciola
   hepatica (7.1\%), the rumen fluke Calicophoron daubneyi (7.1\%,), the
   nematode Strongyloides spp. (3.1\%), the lencet liver fluke Dicrocoelium
   dendriticum (2.4\%) and the tapeworm Moniezia spp. (2.4\%). ill order to
   display the Spatial distribution Of the various helminths detected oil
   the water buffalo farms (used as epidemiological unit ill our study),
   point maps were drawn within the GIS. In addition, for each helminth,
   clustering of test-positive farms were investigated based oil location
   determined by exact coordinates. Using spatial Scan statistic, spatial
   clusters were found for the flukes F. hepatica and C. daubneyi and the
   cestode Moniezia spp.; these findings are consistent with the life cycle
   of these parasites, which have strong environmental determinants. In
   conclusion, the present study demonstrated that, with the appropriate
   survey-based data at hand, GIS is a useful tool to study epidemiological
   patterns of infections ill veterinary health, in particular ill water

Title = {Protective effect of the AT(137)RQ and ARQK(176) PrP alleles against

Abstract = {The susceptibility of sheep to scrapie is under the control of the
   host's prion protein (PrP) gene and is also influenced by the strain of
   the agent. PrP polymorphisms at codons 136 (A/V), 154 (R/H) and 171
   (Q/R/H) are the main determinants of susceptibility/resistance of sheep
   to classical scrapie. They are combined in four main variants of the
   wild-type ARQ allele: VRQ, AHQ, ARH and ARR. Breeding programmes have
   been undertaken on this basis in the European Union and the USA to
   increase the frequency of the resistant ARR allele in sheep populations.
   Herein, we report the results of a multi-flock study showing the
   protective effect of polymorphisms other than those at codons 136, 154
   and 171 in Sarda breed sheep. All ARQ/ARQ affected sheep (n = 154) and
   378 negative ARQ/ARQ controls from four scrapie outbreaks were submitted
   to sequencing of the PrP gene. The distribution of variations other than
   those at the standard three codons, between scrapie cases and negative
   controls, was statistically different in all flocks. In particular, the
   AT(137)RQ and ARQK(176) alleles showed a clear protective effect. This
   is the first study demonstrating a protective influence of alleles other
   than ARR under field conditions. If further investigations in other
   sheep breeds and with other scrapie sources confirm these findings, the
   availability of various protective alleles in breeding programmes of
   sheep for scrapie resistance could be useful in breeds with a low
   frequency of the ARR allele and would allow maintaining a wider
   variability of the PrP gene.},

Abstract = {Samples of superficial inguinal and bronchial lymph nodes, ileum, tonsil
   and lung were taken from three to five pigs on each of 61 farms with a
   clinical history of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS).
   The samples were examined histologically and by immunohistochemistry for
   porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2). PMWS was diagnosed in two stages:
   first, an evaluation of the haematoxylin and eosinstained sections that
   identified the cases in which the characteristic PCV-2 cytoplasmic
   inclusion bodies were apparent, and secondly, a conclusive step in which
   immunohistochemistry was applied to confirm PMWS in the cases in which
   there were positive immunohistochemical results that coincided with
   lesions indicative of PMWS in at least one of the lymphoid and/or lung
   tissues. The location of PCV-2 in specific lesions (cell depletion in
   lymphoid organs and interstitial pneumonia) confirmed PMWS in 45 of the
   61 farms, 31 of which were also infected with porcine reproductive and
   respiratory syndrome virus. The lymphoid tissues were more reliable than
   the lungs for the diagnosis of PMWS, both in individual pigs and in
   groups of pigs, and farm diagnoses based on a group of pigs were more
   reliable than diagnoses based on single pigs.},

Abstract = {The olfactory system (OS) is involved in many infectious and
   neurodegenerative diseases, both human and animal, and it has recently
   been investigated in regard to transmissible spongiform
   encephalopathies. Previous assessments of nasal mucosa infection by
   prions following intracerebral challenge suggested a potential
   centrifugal spread along the olfactory nerve fibers of the pathological
   prion protein ( PrPSc). Whether the nasal cavity may be a route for
   centripetal prion infection to the brain has also been experimentally
   studied. With the present study, we wanted to determine whether prion
   deposition in the OS occurs also under field conditions and what type of
   anatomical localization PrPSc might display there. We report here on
   detection by different techniques of PrPSc in the nasal mucosa and in
   the OS-related brain areas of sheep affected by natural scrapie. PrPSc
   was detected in the perineurium of the olfactory nerve bundles in the
   medial nasal concha and in nasal-associated lymphoid tissue. Olfactory
   receptor neurons did not show PrPSc immunostaining. PrPSc deposition was
   found in the brain areas of olfactory fiber projection, chiefly in the
   olfactory bulb and the olfactory cortex. The prevalent PrPSc deposition
   patterns were subependymal, perivascular, and submeningeal. This
   finding, together with the discovery of an intense PrPSc immunostaining
   in the meningeal layer of the olfactory nerve perineurium, at the border
   with the subdural space extension surrounding the nerve rootlets,
   strongly suggests a probable role of cerebrospinal fluid in conveying
   prion infectivity to the nasal submucosa.},

Abstract = {Background. Previous studies have suggested that
   fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of Escherichia coli that infect humans
   probably emerged as a consequence of using fluoroquinolones in poultry.
   This study aims to provide further insight into the possible avian
   origin of fluoroquinolone-resistant extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli
   (ExPEC) strains that infect humans.
   Methods. We compared the phylogenetic backgrounds, virulence gene
   profiles, and genetic relatedness of 125 ExPEC strains recovered from
   humans (61 were ciprofloxacin susceptible and 64 were ciprofloxacin
   resistant) and 113 E. coli strains recovered from poultry (47 were
   ciprofloxacin susceptible and 66 were ciprofloxacin resistant).
   Results. Ciprofloxacin-resistant strains of both human and avian origin
   harbored fewer virulence genes than did ciprofloxacin-susceptible
   strains, but ciprofloxacin-resistant strains from humans were found to
   be clearly distinct from ciprofloxacin-resistant avian strains, based on
   their phylogenetic backgrounds and virulence gene profiles. The
   phylogenetic background of ciprofloxacin-susceptible and
   ciprofloxacin-resistant strains of human origin was not different, and
   no shift from the phylogenetic group B2 toward other groups was detected
   in association with ciprofloxacin resistance. No genetic relatedness was
   observed among human and avian strains that belonged to the major
   virulence profile (traT-iucD-iutA).
   Conclusions. Our results did not support the hypothesis of an avian
   origin for the ciprofloxacin-resistant human ExPEC strains analyzed.
   Nevertheless, prudent use of fluoroquinolones in both human and
   veterinary medicine is recommended.},

Abstract = {Rabbit meat breeding may be heavily affected by enterotoxaemia due to
   Clostridium spiroforme. Data on its antimicrobial susceptibility are
   insufficient, presumably because of difficulties in cultivating and
   identifying the pathogen. Our aim is therefore to provide this
   information to veterinary practitioners by focusing on a panel of
   therapeutics used in intensive rabbit units. Lincomycin was also checked
   in order to investigate the origin of resistance to macrolides. Minimal
   inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined with the agar dilution
   method according to the CLSI M11-A7 protocol (2007). MIC(50) and MIC(90)
   were, respectively, 64 and 64 mu g/ml for tiamulin, 32 and 32 mu g/ml
   for norfloxacin, 0.063 and 0.125 mu g/ml for amoxicillin, and 8 and 16
   mu g/ml for doxycycline. MIC(50) and MIC(90) were 256 mu g/ml for
   sulphadimethoxine, spiramycin and lincomycin. Our results have shown
   that intrinsic or acquired antimicrobial resistances are diffuse in the
   C spiroforme population and suggest focusing on prevention rather than
   on treatment of clostridial overgrowth, by reducing risk factors and
   using antimicrobials prudently. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Risk factors for toxoplasmosis in pigs bred in Sicily, Southern Italy},

Volume = {161},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to determine the seroprevalence of Toxoplasma
   gondii infection in pigs raised and slaughtered in Sicily, Southern
   Italy, and to evaluate the risk factors associated with the infection.
   Samples were collected in seven slaughterhouses and onsite on 274
   raising farms across Sicily, in the period from January 2006 until March
   2007. For each sampled pig born and raised in Sicily, information was
   obtained on gender, age, origin, final destination of meat and farm
   management. Data on the farm included: farming type, presence of cats
   and dogs, rodent control by rodenticides, cleaning methods, water
   supply, altitude and herd size.T. gondii-specific antibodies were
   detected using a commercial Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (Institut
   Pourquier, France).Antibodies against T. gondii were found in 16.3\% of
   Sicilian pigs. The lowest seroprevalence, 7\%, was found in the age
   group 5-7 months (market pig) and the highest, 19\%, in the age group
   >24 months. Risk factors for seropositivity were: age 11-24 months
   compared to younger (OR 5.62; CI 1.52-20.8); farrow-to-finish farming
   type (OR 6.85; CI 1.87-25.01) compared to finishing and farrow-to-breed
   type; less than 50 pigs on the farm (OR 6.8; CI 1.76-26.2): no use of
   rodenticides (OR 2.71: Cl 1.10-6.64), use of water coming from private
   sources (especially wells; OR 2.8; CI 1.03-7.72).Pigs raised in Sicily
   shows a high prevalence of antibodies against T. gondii. Pre-harvesting
   interventions to lower the risk of locally produced meat consumption for
   consumers should point as soon as possible to increase hygienic
   condition on the farm, by carefully removing waste with automatic
   cleaning and reducing biohazard by rodent control. Consumers must
   receive information on the correct handling and cooking locally produced
   pork meat derivatives. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Year = {2009},
Volume = {29},

Abstract = {Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) at low concentrations had been previously
   shown to control the expression of inflammatory cytokine genes in swine
   pulmonary alveolar macrophages. In the first part of this study,
   cultured swine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were
   supplemented with IFN-alpha at low/moderate concentrations, and then
   stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The expression of IFN-alpha,
   IFN-gamma, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 genes was determined by
   real-time PCR. IFN-alpha at low/moderate concentrations did not
   significantly reduce the expression of any cytokine gene under study,
   with clear trends though to a concentration-dependent reduction of IL-1
   beta gene expression and to a concentration-dependent increase of
   IFN-gamma gene expression. In vivo, orally administered IFN-alpha was
   shown instead to modulate the inflammatory response to early weaning in
   uncultured PBMCs of specific pathogen-free piglets. As opposed to the in
   vitro model, the oral IFN-alpha treatment reduced after weaning the
   expression of the IFN-gamma gene (P < 0.08) and increased that of the
   IL-1 beta gene (P < 0.05). There was also a trend to a reduced
   expression of both IL-6 and TNF-alpha. The above modulation of cytokine
   genes expression and the greater daily mean weight gain of treated
   piglets highlight important regulatory properties of oral IFN-alpha in
   the response to the weaning stress.},

Abstract = {The study was intended to evaluate the depletion of chloramphenicol
   (CAP) in rainbow trout (about 300-550 g body weight), after 10 days
   treatment with fish feedstuff containing chloramphenicol.
   A total of 60 animals were separated in two groups: one was fed with CAP
   containing feedstuff in order to have a dosage of about 80 mg kg(-1)
   day(-1), while a second group of fishes was fed with feedstuff not
   containing any CAP formulation (negative controls).
   The treatment was maintained for 10 days. After this period, groups of
   2-5 animals were sacrificed at different withdrawal times up to a
   maximum of 31 days.
   Muscle tissues of each group of animals were then analysed for
   quantitative residual CAP determination both by enzyme linked
   immunoassay (ELISA) and liquid chromatography coupled to mass
   spectrometry (HPLC/MSMS).
   The methods applied were in house validated according to the guidelines
   laid down by the European Decision 657/2002/EC.

Abstract = {Whole gene duplication of the lamin B1 gene (LMNB1), encoding for a
   protein of the nuclear lamina, causes an adult-onset autosomal dominant
   leukodystrophy (ADLD). Clinical features of ADLD (onset in adult life,
   dysautonomic symptoms, followed by pyramidal and cerebellar
   dysfunctions) partially resemble those of multiple sclerosis (MS),
   particularly the primary-progressive form. Our aim was to test whether
   LMNB1 gene mutations were present amongst patients with a diagnosis of
   MS.
   One hundred eighty-two MS patients were screened for copy number
   variations of the LMNB1 gene using a qPCR assay. Point mutations in the
   LMNB1 gene were searched by denaturing high-performance liquid
   chromatography and direct sequencing in a subgroup of 16 patients with
   familial MS.
   No duplication/deletion of the lamin B1 gene was found amongst MS
   patients, and no point mutation was identified in the familial cases.
   Our work indicates that lamin B1 defects are probably not responsible
   for signs and symptoms resembling multiple sclerosis.},

Abstract = {The Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise `G.
   Caporale' (IZS A\&M) has been engaged for many years in research and
   studies designed to increase knowledge and expertise when dealing with
   `exotic diseases' namely, those diseases which are not present in a
   country. To achieve these objectives, it is important to create
   cooperation networks with laboratories and research organisations at
   national and international levels. The relationship between the IZS A\&M
   with Namibia in particular and, more recently with Botswana, are proving
   to be very valuable to mutual technical/scientific growth. In 2005, the
   National Reference Centre for the Study of Exotic Diseases set up its
   own Virology Laboratory at the Windhoek Central Veterinary Laboratory
   where the Namibian and IZS A\&M personnel, working towards common goals,
   share diagnostic responsibilities and scientific research. The authors
   describe the activities involved in this joint project.},

Abstract = {Influenza A viruses infecting poultry can be divided into 2 groups. The
   extremely virulent viruses cause highly pathogenic avian influenza
   (HPAI), with flock mortality as great as 100\%. These viruses have been
   restricted to subtypes H5 and H7, although not all H5 and H7 viruses
   cause HPAI. All other viruses cause a milder, primarily respiratory,
   disease (LPAI) unless exacerbated. Until recently, HPAI viruses were
   rarely isolated from wild birds, but for LPAI viruses, extremely great
   isolation rates have been recorded in surveillance studies. Influenza
   viruses may infect all types of domestic or captive birds in all areas
   of the world, with the frequency with which primary infections occur in
   any type of bird usually depending on the degree of contact of the bird
   with feral birds. Secondary spread is usually associated with human
   involvement, either by bird or bird product movement, or by transferring
   infective feces from infected to susceptible birds, but potentially wild
   birds could be involved. In recent years, the frequency of HPAI
   outbreaks appears to have increased, and there have been particularly
   costly outbreaks of HPAI in densely populated poultry areas in Italy,
   the Netherlands, and Canada. In each, millions of birds were slaughtered
   to bring the outbreaks under control. Since the 1990s, avian influenza
   infections attributable to 2 subtypes have been widespread in poultry
   across a large area of the world. The LPAI H9N2 virus appears to have
   spread across the whole of Asia in that time and has become endemic in
   poultry in many of the affected countries. However, these outbreaks have
   tended to be overshadowed by the H5N1 HPAI virus, which, although
   initially isolated in China, has now spread in poultry, wild birds, or
   both throughout Asia and into Europe and Africa, resulting in the death
   or culling of hundreds of millions of poultry and posing a significant
   zoonotic threat. To date, control methods seem to have been unsuccessful
   on the larger scale, and HPAI H5N1 outbreaks continue to be reported.},

Title = {Vaccination as a tool to combat introductions of notifiable avian

Abstract = {In late 2000, Italy was the first country of the European Union (EU) to
   implement an emergency vaccination programme against notifiable avian
   influenza. Vaccination with a conventional vaccine containing a seed
   strain with a different neuraminidase subtype from that of the field
   virus was used to complement biosecurity and restriction measures as
   part of an overall eradication strategy. This vaccination technique, in
   line with the Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals system
   (DIVA), was applied several times until March 2008. This strategy
   enabled the identification of field exposed flocks and ultimately the
   eradication of low pathogenic H7N1, H7N3 and H5N2 infections. Italy was
   also the first country to implement a bivalent H5/H7 prophylactic
   vaccination programme of defined poultry populations, which was
   discontinued in December 2006.
   Following the incursion of highly pathogenic H5N1 into Europe, in 2005
   and 2006, two other EU Member States, namely France and the Netherlands,
   implemented preventive vaccination programmes in 2006 but they targeted
   selected poultry populations different from those targeted in Italy and
   were implemented for short periods of time.
   Data generated during six years of experience with vaccination against
   avian influenza in Italy indicate that it is a useful tool to limit
   secondary spread and possibly prevent the introduction of low pathogenic
   avian influenza viruses in a susceptible population. The experience of
   France and the Netherlands provides data on vaccination of ducks and
   hobby poultry respectively and monitoring programmes associated with
   vaccination and difficulties related to their application. The
   advantages and disadvantages of vaccination need to be considered in the
   decision-making process, including the financial aspects of vaccination.},

Abstract = {In 1998 an atypical form of scrapie was first detected in sheep in
   Norway and nowadays it is described all over Europe; atypical scrapie in
   goats was instead reported only in France, Spain, Switzerland and Italy.
   PRNP polymorphisms, already known for their association to
   susceptibility/resistance to classical scrapie in sheep, are also
   involved in atypical scrapie. In particular the two alleles AHQ and
   AF(141) RQ represent risk factors for atypical scrapie in sheep. The AHQ
   allele was already described in atypical scrapie affected goats but
   statistical analysis of the association between Nor98 and goat PRNP
   polymorphisms has not been reported previously. The aim of this study
   was to fill this gap carrying out a case-control study on 8 affected
   goats and 246 negative goats belonging to 8 Italian atypical scrapie
   Nor98 outbreaks. Results obtained applying chi-square test showed a
   significant association between AHQ allele and the disease
   (p-value=0,002).
   In light of the data reported in this study, the strategy based on the
   selective culling of susceptible goats could be an effective measure to
   decrease the risk of atypical scrapie Nor98 inside the outbreaks.},

Abstract = {Using high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection
   (HPLC-DAD) technique, a confirmatory method for the determination of
   trace levels of tetracyclines (oxytetracycline, tetracycline,
   chlortetracycline and doxycycline) and their 4-epimers
   (4-epioxytetracycline, 4-epitetracycline and 4-epichlortetracycline) in
   animal tissues (muscle) was developed.
   The samples are extracted with a mixture of succinic acid 0.1 M (pH 4)
   and methanol after the addition of metacycline as internal standard. The
   clean-up is carried out by metal chelate affinity chromatography with a
   following concentration step on an OASIS HLB polymeric reversed phase
   column. The chromatographic separation of the seven analytes is achieved
   in 10 min on a short monolithic column (50 mm x 4.6 mm i.d.) using a
   gradient elution.
   The method was validated in bovine muscle following the Commission
   Decision 2002/657/EC criteria: samples spiked at four concentration
   levels (0.25, 0.5, 1 and 1.5 times the maximum residue limit) were
   analysed. Method trueness and precision (repeatability and
   intra-laboratory reproducibility) as well as decision limits (CC alpha)
   and detection capabilities (CC beta) are reported. (c) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {The presence of zeranol (alpha-zearalanol) in urine samples due to
   natural contamination or illegal treatment is under debate within the
   European Union. The simultaneous determination of zeranol, its epimer
   taleranol (beta-zearalanol), zearalanone and the structurally related
   mycotoxin zearalenone with the corresponding alpha- and beta-zearalenol
   metabolites appears to be critical in deciding whether an illegal use
   has occurred. The aim of this study is to develop and validate a simple
   analytical procedure applicable to bovine and swine urine samples for
   the determination of all six resorcylic acid lactones. After an
   enzymatic deconjugation, the urine was Subjected to a one-step cleanup
   on a commercially available immunoaffinity chromatography cartridge. The
   analytes were detected by liquid chromatography-negative-ion
   electrospray tandem mass spectrometry using deuterium-labelled internal
   standards. The method was validated as a quantitative confirmatory
   method according to European Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. The
   evaluated parameters were: linearity, specificity, precision
   (repeatability and intra-laboratory reproducibility), recovery, decision
   limit, detection capability and ruggedness. The decision limits (CC
   alpha) obtained, were between 0.56 and 0.68 mu g L(-1); recovery above
   66\% for all the analytes. Repeatability was between 1.4 and 5.3\% and
   within-laboratory reproducibility between 1.9 and 16.1\% for the six

Abstract = {West Nile virus (WNV) is a flavivirus that is maintained in a
   bird-mosquito transmission cycle. Humans, horses and other non-avian
   vertebrates are usually incidental hosts. However, WNV is a neurotropic
   virus, which requires an efficient humoral response for the control of a
   neuroinvasive infection. The WNV genome encodes three structural
   (capsid, premembrane/membrane and envelope) and seven nonstructural
   proteins. Bioinformatic analysis performed on the WNV genomes detected a
   conserved alternative open reading frame restricted to the lineage I
   virus. To quickly verify the existence of this putative protein,
   entitled West Nile Alternative Reading Frame 4 (WARF4), we produced a
   prokaryotic recombinant source of WARF4 and verified its immunogenicity
   in vivo by analyzing 43 horse serum samples, of which 15 were positive
   for antibodies to WNV premembrane and envelope (prM-E) proteins.
   Specific antibodies to WARF4 were significantly detected in 5 out of the
   15 serum samples testing positive for antibodies to prM-E WNV proteins.
   Our findings provide evidence of a significant antibody response to the
   WARF4 protein in the serum of the horse testing positive for antibodies
   to prM-E proteins, thus indicating that this antigen might be a
   potential tool for further characterization of the immune response of
   WNV infections in humans as well.},

Abstract = {A precise and reliable method for the determination of 10 sulphonamide
   antibiotics (sulfadiazine, sulfathiazole, sulfamerazine, sulfamethazine,
   sulfamethoxypyridazine, sulfachloropyridazine, sulfamethoxazole,
   sulfamonomethoxine, sulfadimethoxine and sulfaquinoxaline) in egg by
   liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has been
   developed.
   Drugs were extracted using a mixture of dichloromethane/acetone (50:50,
   v/v), acidified with acetic acid and then cleaned-up on a
   cation-exchange solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridge. The
   chromatographic separation was performed by gradient on a C-18 column
   with a mobile phase of methanol-water containing 0.1\% formic acid and 5
   mM ammonium acetate, then sulphonamides were detected in a
   triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer operated in positive electrospray
   ionization mode (ESI+).
   The method was validated at 15,30 and 45 mu g kg(-1). These levels were
   much lower than the corresponding maximum residue limit of 100 mu g
   kg(-1) set for sulphonamides in several matrices but not in eggs, where
   the presence of such residues is not permitted.
   Results were quantitated against the selected internal standard

Abstract = {A simple and rapid multiresidue method for the determination of seven
   sulphonamides residues (sulfadiazine, sulfapyridine, sulfamerazine,
   sulfamethazine, sulfamonomethoxine, sulfadimethoxine and
   sulfaquinoxaline) in milk samples was developed and validated. The drugs
   were extracted with a mixture chloroform/acetone and simply cleaned up
   on a cation exchange solid phase extraction column. The analytes
   determination was carried out using liquid chromatography with diode
   array detection (DAD). The procedure has validated as a quantitative
   confirmatory method according to the European Union (EU) Decision
   2002/657/EC. The developed method shows good linearity, specificity,
   precision (repeatability and intra-laboratory reproducibility),
   ruggedness and is able to confirm each sulphonamide residue above 30 mu
   g kg(-1). Decision limits (CC alpha) around 110 alpha g kg(-1) and
   recovery above 56\% were obtained for all the analytes. The results of
   the validation process demonstrate that the method is suitable for
   application, as confirmatory method, in European Union statutory
   veterinary drug residue surveillance programmes. in addition, a
   hypothetical situation of sample judgement (compliance or not) in the
   case in which, at the same time, two different sulphonamides are found,
   is discussed. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Salmonella is one of the most common causes of human gastroenteritis
   often associated with pork consumption. The aims of this cross-sectional
   study were to collect preliminary data on the presence of Salmonella
   enterica in pigs in Piedmont (Italy), through sampling on farm and at
   slaughter and to gather pilot data on serotypes and phagetypes present
   in the sampled area and distribution of anti-microbial resistance among
   isolated strains. Salmonella was detected through culture and identified
   with Salmonella spp. and Salmonella Typhimurium PCR; positive samples
   were serotyped, phagetyped and tested for antibiotic susceptibility.
   Positive samples (from 9\% of faeces up to 29\% of tonsils) were found
   in 64\% of the herds. Salmonella spp. was retrieved also from scalding
   water. Most of the isolates were Salmonella Derby, Salmonella
   Typhimurium and Salmonella 4,5,12:i:-. The results of Salmonella
   Typhimurium specific PCR suggested that Salmonella 4,5,12:i:- might be
   unrecognized by serotyping. Anti-microbial resistance was recorded in
   75-100\% of the isolates. Phagetyping allowed the identification of
   DT104B and DT46A strains. These results set the bases for further
   research studies that would aim to estimate the real herd prevalence in
   Piedmont and the diffusion of serotypes and anti-microbial resistant
   strains within the same region.},

Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {51-54},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {INTRODUCTION - The contamination of bulk milk from pathogenic
   microorganisms such as C. jejuni is assuming more importance as a
   consequence of the increasing consumption of raw milk. We describe two
   cases of dairy farms located in the Po Valley, characterised by repeated
   detection of C jejuni in bulk milk. In both cases the source of
   contamination of bulk milk (and consequently of raw milk) was due to a
   cased of mammary infection in a cow. CASES - In both cases just one
   infected quarter of a single cow was able to contaminate the bulk milk
   of respectively 270 and 180 lactating cows. The persistent infection of
   the quarter was documented for at least 90 days in one herd and for
   30-40 days in the other herd. Antibiotic treatment of the infected cow
   in the first farm was effective in the cure of mammary infection.
   DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS - Although C. jejuni was also detected in the
   faeces of some animals, the segregation of the subject with mammary
   infection was effective in eliminating the primary source of
   contamination, with the result of an undetectable level of the
   microrganism in bulk milk. The analysis of pooled milk samples by
   culture and PCR, followed by individual testing, prooved to be efficient
   tools for the identification of infected subjects. These data
   demonstrate the importance to consider the possibility of udder
   infection of even a single cow, as a source of bulk milk contamination,
   when C. jejuni is repeatedly detected.},

Title = {PMWS/PCVAD diagnosis and subclinical PCV-2 infection evaluation in pig:

Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {55-60},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A field study was conducted to investigate the use of a diagnostic
   approach, based on lymph-nodal cytology and sera and lymph-nodal Real
   time PCR on pigs belonging to two herds. The first herd showed severe
   PCVAD/PMWS with herd losses approximately of 12-13\%. The second herd
   showed prevalently a sub-clinical PCV-2 infection with herd losses of
   about 67\%. In the latter, the study was performed before and after the
   vaccination against PCV-2 on three weeks-old piglets.
   This diagnostic approach, using lymph nodal cytology and Real time PCR
   on lymph nodes could be appropriate for herds with clinical PMWS/PCVAD
   (Post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome/Porcine Circovirus
   Associated Disease).
   On the contrary in herds in which a sub-clinical PCV-2 infection is
   present, Real time PCR on sera seems to represent the better approach to
   understand the disease development and the sub-clinical PCV-2 infection
   severity.
   Two, nine and sixteen weeks after the vaccination, pigs showed no
   viremia, as well as a significant improvement of productivity
   performances with a consequent reduction of herd losses (34\%). The
   results of Real time PCR after vaccination need to be further
   investigated and must not be used to evaluate the vaccination efficacy.},

Abstract = {To evaluate further the reactivity of prion-specific monoclonal

   polypeptides, immunoprecipitations were performed on brain extracts from
   Italian bovines, sheep and goats with transmissible spongiform
   encephalopathies. No binding of IgG 89-112 or IgG 136-158 to PrP in
   normal brain extracts was detected. Conversely, both reagents
   immunoprecipitated PrP from bovine and bovine amyloidotic spongiform
   encephalopathies, and from typical and atypical scrapie brain extracts.
   The immunoprecipitated PrP bands mirrored the Western blot (WB) profile
   of the different prion strains, indicating universal affinity of two
   independent PrP regions for disease-associated PrP conformers regardless
   of species source and strain properties. Immunoprecipitation with
   motif-grafted antibodies increased the sensitivity of conventional
   detection methods based on centrifugation followed by WB, which was
   confirmed by assay of diluted samples using both methods. These reagents

Abstract = {In the Schwann cells and neuronal plasma membranes the gangliosides are
   organized in clusters forming complexes of gangliosides in the
   microdomains termed lipid rafts. We investigated frequency, clinical
   correlates, fine specificity and pro-inflammatory properties of
   antibodies to ganglioside complexes (GSCs) in a Guillain Barr syndrome
   (GBS) population. In 63 patients with different GBS variants we
   performed an ELISA for antibodies to Campylobacter Jejuni (C. jejuni),
   gangliosides and GSCs. We studied the fine specificity of antibodies to
   GSCs by immunoabsorption study and performed a complement activation
   assay. Twenty-seven percent of patients had antibodies to GSCs and 71\%
   had antibodies either to single gangliosides or to GSCs. Patients with
   antibodies to GSCs had more frequent involvement of cranial nerves but
   did not present more frequent antecedent respiratory, gastrointestinal
   or C. jejuni infection, did not have a preferential demyelinating or
   primary axonal GBS variant and did not develop greater disability at six
   months. The absorption study showed in 2 sera that antibodies to the
   complex GD1a/GD1b did not react with the gangliosides forming the
   complex or other single gangliosides, suggesting that antibodies to GSCs
   are targeted to new conformational glycoepitopes different from the ones
   displayed by the single gangliosides. Antibody anti-GSCs activated the
   complement more frequently than antibodies to single gangliosides.
   Complement activation indicates that antibodies to GSCs have high
   avidity, pro-inflammatory properties and may exert a pathogenic role in
   GBS.},

Abstract = {Pseudomonas has been identified as an animals pathogen in particular it
   is reported occasionally as cause of bovine/ovine mastitis. Infections
   by this opportunistic pathogen are the leading cause of morbidity and
   mortality in dairy subjects. These bacteria are ubiquitous in soil and
   water, and on surfaces in contact with soil or water. Pseudomonas spp.
   has very simple nutritional requirements, in fact it is often observed
   growing in distilled water, which is evidence of its minimal nutritional
   needs. In veterinary field Pseudomonas mammary infection (in particular
   R aeruginosa) may be peracute and severe due to endotoxin production, or
   it may be subacute or chronic, it's tendency to colonize surfaces in a
   biofilm form makes the cells impervious to therapeutic concentrations
   antibiotics and biocides. In this work, we describe a novel and fast
   molecular approach for detect the initial pathogen biofilm core in dairy
   farms due at P. aeruginosa, R fluorescens and R putida. This strategy is
   based on early detection of the subsequent rate: Psudomonas vs total
   bacteria in biofilm specimens. This procedure is based on particular
   bi-functional FRET oligonucleotide probes named DUA-L-FRET.},

Abstract = {Our objective was to characterize epithelial cells lining the epididymal
   duct (caput, corpus, cauda) of the alpaca using AE1/AE3 cytokeratin
   antibodies and a battery of different lectins: Con-A, UEA-I, LTA WGA,
   GSA-II, GSA-IB4, SBA, PNA, ECA, DBA, MAL-II and SNA. Sialidase digestion
   and deglycosylation pre-treatments were also employed. The principal
   cells (PCs) along the epididymis showed differences in immunostaining
   patterns toward keratin antibodies. Lectin histochemistry demonstrated
   variations in the content and distribution of glycosidic residues of
   glycoconjugates in different epididymal regions. In particular, staining
   of the Golgi zone in the epithelial PCs was interpreted as evidence for
   synthesis and secretion of O- and N-linked oligosaccharides. In the
   caput, the apical mitochondria-rich cells contained mainly beta-GalNAc,
   subterminal alpha-GalNAc, alpha-Gal and Neu5Ac alpha 2,3Gal residues.
   Conversely, in the corpus they were particularly rich in alpha-GalNac
   and beta-Gal-(1-3)-d-GalNAc linked to sialic acid moieties. Basal cells
   mainly expressed beta-GalNAc and alpha-Gal in the caput, alpha-Gal in
   the corpus and alpha-Fuc and beta-GalNAc in the cauda. The differences
   in immunostaining patterns and in lectin histochemistry in the alpaca
   epididymis reported in this investigation seem to be related to regional
   differences in function.},

Abstract = {Amino-acid polymorphisms of the ovine prion protein have been known to
   influence susceptibility to scrapie for many years. Recently, a role in
   both classical and atypical scrapie was assigned to new mutations,
   increasing the overall number of polymorphisms of interest for breeding
   plans. Besides, the high number and density of polymorphisms in the
   prion protein gene (PrP) and the presence of unusual mutations in some
   breeds hampers genotyping methods, making multiplexing difficult and
   sometimes compromising analytical results. We developed a multiplex
   genotyping method for the ovine PrP that overcomes the limitations posed
   by the high number and density of the polymorphisms to interrogate. Nine
   primers were designed to be compatible in a single primer-extension
   reaction developed for routine genotyping, with the capacity to identify
   the following polymorphisms: A136V, M137T, L141F, I142K, R154H, Q171R,
   Q171H, Q171K and N176K. Site-specific mutations were inserted in primer
   sequences in order to prevent extension of reciprocally complementary
   primers. Complete accuracy and repeatability of the assay was assessed
   with reference to 97 sequenced samples.
   The presented method constitutes an improved tool for ovine PrP
   genotyping and a general strategy for the use of primer extension in a
   genetic context of high density of polymorphisms. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Quinolones are a group of chemotherapeutic agents with an excellent
   efficiency against poultry pathogens. Two commercial enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests have been applied in parallel for the
   qualitative screening analysis of several quinolones in eggs, poultry
   muscle and feeds at the required levels. During the validation study,
   carried out according to the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC criteria,
   two different sample treatments were compared in foods: the simple and
   fast procedure suggested by the kit producer (Euro-Diagnostica) and a
   more complex solid-phase extraction (SPE) sample preparation. The
   results demonstrated that the method based on SPE clean up exhibited
   better characteristic performances, particularly in eggs for which lower
   detection levels are required. Despite the fact that screening methods
   should be rapid and cheap, the use of non-chromatographic techniques
   such as ELISA for multiresidual detection of a class of substances
   involves some additional attention to sample preparation. (C) 2008

Abstract = {The burden of rabies in Africa is estimated at 24000 human deaths
   year(-1), almost all of which result from infection with dog rabies
   viruses (RABV). To investigate the evolutionary dynamics of RABV in
   western and central Africa, 92 isolates sampled from 27 African
   countries over 29 years were collected and sequenced. This revealed that
   RABV currently circulating in dogs in this region fell into a single
   lineage designated `Africa 2'. A detailed analysis of the
   phylogeographical structure of this Africa 2 lineage revealed strong
   population subdivision at the country level, with only limited movement
   of virus among localities, including a possible east-to-west spread
   across Africa. In addition, Bayesian coalescent analysis suggested that
   the Africa 2 lineage was introduced into this region of Africa only
   recently (probably <200 years ago), in accordance with the timescale of
   expanding European colonial influence and urbanization, and then spread
   relatively slowly, perhaps occupying the entire region in a 100 year
   period.},

Abstract = {The results of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) implemented
   for the detection of gamma interferon (gamma-interferon) production in
   cattle vaccinated with Brucella abortus strain RB51 are presented. A
   purified protein fraction derived from RB51 (RB51 brucellin) has been
   used as antigenic stimulus for whole blood. The test was evaluated for
   300 days in ten heifers vaccinated at calfhood with 10 x 10(9)
   colony-forming units of RB51 and in five control heifers. All animals
   came from officially brucellosis-free herds. Vaccinated animals started
   to give positive results from day 17 post vaccination (pv) until day 239
   pv. All vaccinated animals gave a positive reaction at least once (with
   a stimulation index exceeding 2.5). Nevertheless, if sampling on day 20
   pv is excluded (90\% of vaccinated animals gave positive results), the
   sensitivity of the test varies from 20\% to 70\%, with a 40\% average. A
   stimulation index over 2.5 was also recorded in three control animals.
   The results suggest that the gamma-interferon test is not suitable for
   the detection of cattle vaccinated with RB51, either at the individual
   or at the herd level.},

Abstract = {Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus is one of the most important
   flaviviruses associated with neurological disease in Europe.
   Cross-reactive antibodies elicited by different flaviviruses can make
   difficult the interpretation of ELISA and hemagglutination-inhibition
   (HI) tests for the diagnosis of TBE. Neutralization tests, which are
   more specific, are not in common use because they are difficult to
   perform and standardize. A plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT),
   optimized previously in vaccinated children, was evaluated in sera from
   acute cases of TBE, collected for diagnostic purposes, and from healthy
   human population and wild ruminants, collected for serosurvey purposes.
   The PRNT results were compared with the results of ELISA and HI tests.
   In acute TBE disease, most sera were positive for IgM antibodies by
   ELISA and with high HI antibody titers; neutralizing antibodies were
   detected in 71.4\% of patients, at a very low titer (1: 10 NT50) in
   almost all cases. Seroprevalences of 8\% and 6.5\% for anti-TBE ELISA
   antibodies were found in healthy subjects and wild ruminants,
   respectively, Among anti TBE positive healthy subjects, a very low 1:10
   NT50 titer was detected in 17.4\% of cases, while NT80 titers ranging
   from 1:10 to 1:80 were detected in 65.2\% of cases. Among wild
   ruminants, 90.9\% of ELISA and HI positive samples showed a positive, >=
   1:10 NT80 titer. In conclusion, neutralization assays can be useful for
   the diagnosis and serosurveys of TBE. J. Med Virol 81:665-671, 2009. (C)

Abstract = {Arboviruses are arthropod-borne viruses, which include West Nile fever
   virus (WNFV), a mosquito-borne virus, Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a
   mosquito-borne virus, and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus
   (CCHFV), a tick-borne virus. These arthropod-borne viruses can cause
   disease in different domestic and wild animals and in humans, posing a
   threat to public health because of their epidemic and zoonotic
   potential. In recent decades, the geographical distribution of these
   diseases has expanded. Outbreaks of WNF have already occurred in Europe,
   especially in the Mediterranean basin. Moreover, CCHF is endemic in many
   European countries and serious outbreaks have occurred, particularly in
   the Balkans, Turkey and Southern Federal Districts of Russia. In 2000,
   RVF was reported for the first time outside the African continent, with
   cases being confirmed in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. This spread was
   probably caused by ruminant trade and highlights that there is a threat
   of expansion of the virus into other parts of Asia and Europe. In the
   light of global warming and globalisation of trade and travel, public
   interest in emerging zoonotic diseases has increased. This is especially
   evident regarding the geographical spread of vector-borne diseases. A
   multi-disciplinary approach is now imperative, and groups need to
   collaborate in an integrated manner that includes vector control,
   vaccination programmes, improved therapy strategies, diagnostic tools
   and surveillance, public awareness, capacity building and improvement of
   infrastructure in endemic regions.},

Abstract = {Leishmaniasis from Leishmania infantum is a parasitary zoonotic disease
   and a serious problem to public health. Guidelines from Italian Health
   Authority (Istituto Superiore di Sanita) suggest to control the zoonotic
   visceral leishmaniasis canine reservoir in endemic areas using an
   association of preventive and therapeutic tools. Moreover, in literature
   there are no studies about the long term effects on the disease
   seroprevalence and incidence in relation to this ``holistic{''}
   approach. Past research has considered the effects of the alternative
   employment of preventive or therapeutic treatment, usually for limited
   periods. In this retrospective study the patterns of seroprevalence and
   incidence of leishmaniasis in a dog shelter sited in an endemic area of
   Central Italy are described throughout a 4-year period. Both preventive
   spot-on tools (imidacloprid/permetrin) and therapeutic protocols based
   on antimonials and allopurinol were administered. The results showed a
   progressive reduction of prevalence and incidence of serological
   reactivity to L infantum, corroborating the effectiveness of the
   treatment administered to the animals. Significant improvements from the
   beginning to the end of the 4-year period were reported, considering
   both prevalence and incidence. A very low rate of relapses (8\% in a
   pool of 67 subjects positive since 2004; 10.2\% among all subjects
   enrolled in the study) was achieved. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   to early 2008, 11 African countries experienced A/H5N1 outbreaks in
   poultry and human cases were also reported in three of these countries.
   At present, little is known of the epidemiology and molecular evolution
   of A/H5N1 viruses in Africa. We have generated 494 full gene sequences
   from 67 African isolates and applied molecular analysis tools to a total
   of 1,152 A/H5N1 sequences obtained from viruses isolated in Africa,
   Europe and the Middle East between 2006 and early 2008. Detailed
   phylogenetic analyses of the 8 gene viral segments confirmed that 3
   distinct sublineages were introduced, which have persisted and spread
   across the continent over this 2-year period. Additionally, our
   molecular epidemiological studies highlighted the association between
   genetic clustering and area of origin in a majority of cases. Molecular
   signatures unique to strains isolated in selected areas also gave us a
   clearer picture of the spread of A/H5N1 viruses across the continent.
   Mutations described as typical of human influenza viruses in the genes
   coding for internal proteins or associated with host adaptation and
   increased resistance to antiviral drugs have also been detected in the
   genes coding for transmembrane proteins. These findings raise concern
   for the possible human health risk presented by viruses with these
   genetic properties and highlight the need for increased efforts to
   monitor the evolution of A/H5N1 viruses across the African continent.
   They further stress how imperative it is to implement sustainable
   control strategies to improve animal and public health at a global
   level.},

Abstract = {Specific antibodies to plasmid-encoded protein pgp3 are known to be
   encountered in human Chlamydia; (C.) trachomatis infections. in order to
   verify whether antibodies to this protein could be developed in animals
   infected with plasmid-carrying chlamydial strains, 454 animal sera were
   examined using a home-made pgp3 protein ELISA and Western blots (WB) of
   recombinant pgp3 protein from Chlamydophila (Cp.) psittaci. Likewise, 50
   human sera were tested by ELISA and WB of recombinant pgp3 from C.
   trachomatis. The reactivity against pgp3 protein was compared to the
   reactivity against chlamydial elementary bodies (EBs) detected by
   microimmunofluorescence (MIF) test. The presence of pgp3-specific
   antibodies was demonstrated in most ducks and pigeons with Cp. psittaci
   infection detected by MIF, as well as in the majority of symptomatic
   cats and pigs infected with Cp. felis and C. suis, respectively, which
   reacted at high titres to Cp. felis and C suis EBs by MIF. Moreover,
   most of the sera collected from patients with C. trachomatis
   culture-confirmed infection and seropositive to C. trachomatis by MIF,
   presented antibodies specific to C. trachomatis pgp3 recombinant
   protein. Therefore, pgp3 protein could be a useful marker of chlamydial
   infections in animals, as well as in humans. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Chlamydial infections in feral pigeons in Europe: Review of data and
   focus on public health implications},

Abstract = {Feral pigeons (Columba livia domestica), which thrive in most European
   towns and cities, are commonly infected with the zoonotic bacterium
   Chlamydophila psittaci, the agent of psittacosis (also known as
   ornithosis) in humans. A number of surveys carried out over the last
   thirty years across Europe have detected high seropositivity values and
   high percentages of infection in feral pigeon populations. Overall, when
   considering data from 11 European countries, seropositivity values to C.
   psittaci in the sampled populations ranged from 19.4\% to 95.6\%. In
   most surveys, the complement fixation test was used, and antibodies were
   detected in 19.4-66.3\% of the samples, with a median of 46.1\%.
   Indirect immunofluorescence and ELISA tests were employed less
   frequently, but led to the detection of higher percentages of
   seropositivity (23.7-67.7\% and 35.9-95.6\%, respectively). Attempts to
   grow C. psittaci in cell culture or embryonated chicken eggs were
   successful in 2-42.3\% and 0-57.1\% of samples, respectively, antigen
   detection methods were positive in 2.3-40\% of samples, while
   conventional PCR and real-time PCR using different genomic targets
   detected the organism in 3.4-50\% of samples. Twenty-five C psittaci
   isolates from pigeons were typed as ompA genotype B (n = 14), E (n = 10)
   and E/B (n = 1).
   The huge increase of feral pigeon populations in Europe is a major cause
   of concern for the detrimental effect of pigeon droppings on
   environmental hygiene, in addition to the extensive damage due to the
   fouling of buildings and monuments. The most important pathogenic
   organism transmissible from feral pigeons to humans is C. psittaci, with
   101 cases of disease reported in the literature. Exposure to C.
   psittaci-contaminated dust, direct contact with pigeons through handling
   and, to a lesser extent, through pigeon feeding have been identified as
   hazardous exposures in more than half of the human cases, while loose or
   transient contacts with feral pigeons have been mentioned in about 40\%
   of the cases.
   Education initiatives as to the communication of a health risk resulting
   from contact with pigeons and pigeon excreta should primarily be
   targeted at individuals who may be exposed to C. psittaci-contaminated
   dust, such as demolition/construction workers. Recommendations to this
   category of workers include wearing protective clothes with hoods,
   boots, gloves and air filter face masks when removing pigeon faeces from
   roofs, garrets and buildings, especially if working indoors. Monitoring
   for C. psittaci infections in these workers over time should also be
   considered. Children should be warned not to handle sick or dead
   pigeons, and immunocompromised individuals should be advised to
   carefully limit their contact to feral pigeons.
   Culling of pigeons by shooting or poisoning is both unethical and
   ineffective as the place of the killed birds in the population is
   quickly filled by new juveniles or immigrating birds from neighbouring
   areas. Pigeon-deterring systems, such as nets and plastic or metal
   spikes applied to buildings and monuments will prevent their fouling,
   and the administration of contraceptive drugs may allow size regulation
   of the pigeon populations. Nevertheless, the measure that will
   ultimately lead to permanent reduction and will establish healthy
   sustainable populations is the restriction of indiscriminate feeding by
   pigeon lovers. The erection of dovecotes and artificial breeding
   facilities should be considered for providing shelter and a balanced
   diet to the birds, as well as a chance of interaction for pigeon lovers
   in a hygienically controlled environment. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The avian and human pathogen Chlamydophila (C) psittaci represents a
   genetically heterogeneous species. To facilitate epidemiological
   surveys, more rapid yet highly specific molecular tests are needed.
   Currently used typing methods, i.e. serotyping and PCR-RFLP, have only
   limited sensitivity and are incapable of covering the wide spectrum of
   naturally occurring types of C psittaci strains. In the present study, a
   new DNA microarray assay based on the ArrayTube(R) (AT) technology was
   used to genotype C. psittaci in 98 isolates and 23 clinical tissue
   samples. The present array carries 35 oligonucleotide probes derived
   from variable domains 2 and 4 of the ompA gene. The assay proved highly
   sensitive, allowing correct genotyping of DNA from 2 inclusion-forming
   units.
   The results of DNA microarray genotyping of cultured strains proved
   highly concordant with the data from PCR-RFLP typing and serotyping.
   Sequencing of the ompA gene served as the reference test to verify the
   accuracy of AT genotyping results. In 15 instances (15.3\%), strains
   were successfully typed by the AT assay, while serotyping and/or
   PCR-RFLP genotyping failed to produce unambiguous results. Eleven of
   these samples were ompA sequenced to confirm the AT findings. In
   addition to the currently accepted nine ompA genotypes, the microarray
   test was shown to recognise new provisional genotypes, such as Mat116
   and YP84. In conclusion, the new AT assay proved to be suitable for
   rapid, sensitive and reproducible genotyping of C psittaci strains and
   can be recommended for routine diagnosis. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Spoligotyping and exact tandem repeat (ETR) analysis of Mycobacterium
   bovis and M. caprae isolated strains has been routinely carried out in
   Italy since 2000 to obtain a database of genetic profiles and support
   traditional epidemiological investigations. In this study, we
   characterized 1,503 M. bovis and 57 M. caprae isolates obtained from
   2000 to 2006 in 747 cattle herds mainly located in northern Italy. We
   identified 81 spoligotypes and 113 ETR profiles, while the combination
   of spoligotyping/ETR analysis differentiated 228 genotypes, with
   genotypic diversity indices of 0.70 (spoligotyping), 0.94 (ETR-A to -E
   typing), and 0.97 (spoligotyping/ETR-A to -E typing), respectively.
   Despite the high degree of resolution obtained, the spoligotyping/ ETR
   methods were not discriminative enough in the case of genotypes
   characterized by the combination of SB0120, the predominant spoligotype
   in Italy, with the most common ETR profiles. To obtain a more
   informative subset of typing loci, 24 mycobacterial interspersed
   repetitive unit-variable-number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) markers were
   evaluated by analyzing a panel of 100 epidemiologically unrelated SB0120
   isolates. The panel was differentiated into 89 profiles with an overall
   genotypic diversity of 0.987 that could be also achieved by using a
   minimal group of 13 loci: ETR-A, -B, and -E; MIRU 26 and 40; and VNTR
   2163a, 2163b, 3155, 1612, 4052, 1895, 3232, and 3336. The allelic
   diversity index and the stability of single loci was evaluated to
   provide the most discriminative genotyping method for locally prevalent
   strains.},

Abstract = {The sequence of the full-length gene encoding for the main capsid
   protein VP2 of 58 canine parvovirus (CPV) type 2c strains, along with
   recent CPV-2a/2b strains, was determined and analysed in comparison with
   reference CPV isolates. The CPV-2c strains displayed a low genetic
   variability and shared amino acid changes already detected in recent
   CPV-2a/2b isolates, with a phylogenetic Clustering accounting for their
   geographical distribution. Analysis of the selection pressure driving
   CPV evolution confirmed that the VP2 gene is under purifying selection.
   The emergence and global spread of the new CPV variant provides an
   interesting model to better understand virus evolution. (c) 2009

Abstract = {The interferon (IFN) system is a major effector of the innate immunity
   that allows time for the subsequent establishment of an adaptive immune
   response against a wide-range of pathogens. Their diverse biological
   actions are thought to be mediated by the products of specific but
   usually overlapping sets of cellular genes induced in the target cells.
   Ubiquitin ligase members of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family
   have emerged as IFN-incluced proteins involved in both innate and
   adaptive immunity. In this report, we provide evidence that TRIM22 is a
   functional E3 ubiquitin ligase that is also ubiquitinated itself. We
   demonstrate that TRIM22 expression leads to a viral protection of HeLa
   cells against encephalomyocarditis virus infections. This effect is
   dependent upon its E3 ubiquitinating activity, since no antiviral effect
   was observed in cells expressing a TRIM22-deletion mutant defective in
   ubiquitinating activity. Consistent with this, TRIM22 interacts with the
   viral 3C protease (3C(PRO)) and mediates its ubiquitination. Altogether,
   our findings demonstrate that TRIM22 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity
   represents a new antiviral pathway induced by IFN against
   picornaviruses.},

Abstract = {Teratomas are histologically complex tumors arising from germ cells of

   detected, loosely connected to the parietal wall in the retroperitoneal
   region cranial to the kidney. Histologically, the neoplasm contained
   tissues from ectodermal, endodermal and mesodermal germ layers: nerves
   and neurons simulating ganglia, cysts lined by squamous epithelium
   containing keratin and hair, skin adnexa; respiratory glandular
   epithelium, serous and salivary glands; collagenous connective tissue,
   muscle fibers, mature cartilage and bone, bone marrow, teeth and fat. To

Abstract = {The most frequently used diagnostic methods were compared in a
   longitudinal survey with Leishmania infantum-infected asymptomatic dogs
   from an area of Italy where leishmaniasis is endemic. In February and
   March 2005, 845 asymptomatic dogs were tested by an immunofluorescence
   antibody test (IFAT), a dipstick assay (DS), and an enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for L. infantum and by IFAT for Ehrlichia
   canis. Dogs seronegative for L. infantum were further parasitologically
   evaluated by microscopic examination of lymph node tissues and PCR of
   skin samples. A total of 204 animals both serologically and
   parasitologically negative for L. infantum at the first sampling were
   enrolled in the trial and were further examined for canine leishmaniasis
   (CanL) and canine monocytic ehrlichiosis in November 2005 (i.e., the end
   of the first sandfly season) and March 2006 and 2007 (1- and 2-year
   follow-ups, respectively). At the initial screening, the overall rates
   of L. infantum seroprevalence were 9.5\% by IFAT, 17.1\% by ELISA, and
   9.8\% by DS and the overall rate of E. canis seroprevalence was 15\%.
   The rates of concordance between the results of IFAT and DS were almost
   equal, whereas the rate of concordance between the results of IFAT and
   DS and those of the ELISA was lower. The results of the annual incidence
   of Leishmania infection were variable, depending on the test employed,
   with the highest values registered for PCR (i.e., 5.7\% and 11.4\% at
   the 1- and 2-year follow-ups, respectively), followed by ELISA, IFAT,
   and DS. Over the 2 years of observation, 55 animals (i.e., 26.9\%)
   became positive for L. infantum by one or more diagnostic tests at
   different follow-up times, with 12.7\% showing clinical signs related to
   CanL, while the remaining 87.3\% were asymptomatic. A diagnostic scheme
   for assessment of the L. infantum infection status in asymptomatic dogs
   is suggested.},

   from the skin, fins, eyes and gills of juvenile Spar-us aurata L.
   (gilthead seabream) following two outbreaks of gyrodactylosis amongst
   stocks held in inshore floating cages on the Adriatic coast of Albania

   G. orecchiae which reportedly resulted in similar to 2-10\% mortality

   orecchiae most closely resemble those of Gyrodactylus arcuatus
   Bychowsky, 1933 in the approximate shape of the ventral bar with its
   pronounced ventral bar processes and marginal hook sickles which possess
   a square line to the inner edge of the sickle blade and large rounded
   heels. The marginal hooks are also morphologically similar to those of

   be readily discriminated from all three species by the characteristic
   infolding of the hamuli roots and the shape of the marginal hook sickle.
   Molecular sequencing of the ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2 regions (513+157+404 bp,
   respectively) of G. orecchiae and alignment with other gyrodactylids for
   which these same genomic regions have been determined, suggests that
   this is a new species. No similarities were found when the ITS1 region
   of G. orecchiae was compared with 84 species of Gyrodactylus available
   on GenBank.},

Abstract = {An outbreak of clinical mastitis was observed in dairy goats due to the
   zoonotic pathogen Streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus. Affected goats
   were culled to prevent transmission of infection to other animals or
   humans. The objective of the study was to determine whether horses on
   the same farm were the source of the pathogen. Streptococcus equi ssp.
   zooepidemicus was obtained from milk of 10\% of goats in the herd and
   from feces of 3 of 7 healthy horses that shared pasture and housing with
   the goats. Isolates of caprine and equine origin had identical
   biochemical profiles, including the ability to ferment sorbitol and
   lactose, which distinguishes S. equi ssp. zooepidemicus from S. equi
   ssp. equi. Sequencing of the 16S-23S intergenic spacer region and
   results from sodA-seeI multiplex PCR supported identification of
   isolates as S. equi ssp. zooepidemicus. Based on random amplified
   polymorphic DNA typing and rpoB and sodA sequencing, caprine isolates
   were indistinguishable from each other, but distinct from equine
   isolates. Further analysis of equine fecal samples showed that multiple
   strains of S. equi ssp. zooepidemicus can be present in a single sample
   or in sequential samples obtained from a single horse. Failure to detect
   the mastitis-causing strain in equine feces may indicate that horses
   were not the source of the mastitis outbreak in goats. Alternatively,
   the outbreak may be due to presence of multiple S. equi ssp.
   zooepidemicus strains in equine feces and a failure to detect all
   strains when analyzing a limited number of isolates per sample.},

   Sons A/S.
   Carbon monoxide (CO) interferes with inflammatory and apoptotic
   processes associated with ischemia-reperfusion injury and graft
   rejection. Here, the in vitro effects of carbon monoxide releasing
   molecule-3 (CORM-3), a novel water-soluble carbonyl CO carrier, have
   been investigated on porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAEC) and primate
   peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Furthermore, the
   pharmacodynamics and pharmacotolerance of CORM-3 after administration of
   single and multiple doses in the primate have been assessed in view of
   its potential application in pig-to-primate xenotransplantation models.
   For in vitro studies, PAEC and primate PBMC were exposed for 24, 48 and
   72 h to CORM-3 (20 to 1000 mu m) and viability was measured using an MTS
   assay. PAEC and primate PBMC proliferation after exposure to CORM-3 was
   assessed by CFSE labelling. Proliferation of primate PBMC against
   irradiated pig lymphocytes was also assessed. Tumor necrosis factor
   alpha (TNF-alpha) production and Caspase-3 and -7 activity in
   Concanavalin A (conA)-stimulated primate PBMC were measured following
   treatment with CORM-3. In vivo, CORM-3 was administered i.v. to
   cynomolgus monkeys at 4 mg/kg, as single or multiple doses for up to 30
   days. The effect of CORM-3 was evaluated by the assessment of production
   of TNF-alpha and interleukin 1 beta following PBMC stimulation with LPS
   by species-specific ELISA. Complete hematologic and biochemical analyses
   were routinely performed in treated primates.
   At concentrations < 500 mu m, CORM-3 did not alter the viability of PAEC
   or primate PBMC cultures in vitro, nor did it induce significant levels
   of apoptosis or necrosis. Interestingly, at concentrations of 300 and
   500 mu m, significant PAEC proliferation was observed, whilst
   concentrations >= 50 mu m inhibited conA-activated primate lymphocyte
   proliferation (IC50 of 345.8 +/- 51.9 mu m) and the primate xenogeneic
   response against pig PBMC. Such responses were demonstrated to be
   CO-dependent. In addition, CORM-3 significantly inhibited caspase-3 and
   -7 activity at concentrations between 200 and 500 mu m and caused a
   significant reduction in TNF-alpha production (IC50 332.8 +/- 33.9 mu
   m). In vivo, following the administration of multiple doses, TNF-alpha
   production was significantly reduced in comparison to pre-treatment
   responses, with decreased levels maintained throughout the study.
   Moreover, a slight and transient increase in transaminases and bilirubin
   was observed in animals exposed to multiple doses of CORM-3.
   These studies suggest that CORM-3 has anti-inflammatory and
   immunomodulatory properties in primates that may result in clinical
   benefit to allo- and xenografted organs.},

Abstract = {Dexamethasone is a potent synthetic corticosteroid widely employed as a
   therapeutic agent in cattle. Besides this legal use, corticosteroids are
   also administered at low dosages as growth-promoters either alone or in
   combination with other steroids or with beta-agonists. For this reason,
   appropriate control plans are established to survey corticosteroid
   misuse, using liver or urine as biological matrices. Since few data are
   available about the kinetics of dexamethasone excretion in meat cattle,
   an experimental study was designed to assess the drug residue levels in
   urines following either a therapeutic (60 mu g of dexamethasone sodium
   phosphate/kg b.w., for three consecutive days) or a growth-promoting
   schedule (0.7 or 1.4 mg of dexamethasone sodium phosphate per capita/day
   for 60 days). The urinary elimination of dexamethasone, which was
   predominantly excreted in the unmodified form, was determined by
   high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry at
   different time intervals, i.e. during the treatments and after
   appropriate withdrawal times. Our findings confirm the high and rapid
   rate of dexamethasone urinary excretion irrespective of the nature of
   the treatment, and provide useful reference values that can be
   conveniently employed for forensic purposes.},

Abstract = {For 60 years, the islands of the Mediterranean basin were considered to
   be Trichinella-free. In April 2005, an outbreak of human trichinellosis
   due to the consumption of infected pork involved 11 persons in the
   villages of Orgosolo and Lanusei (Nuoro province) on the island of
   Sardinia (Italy). We conducted an investigation to identify free-range
   and backyard pigs and other humans with Trichinella infection in the
   area of the 2005 outbreak. We also tested wild animals from various
   parts of Sardinia. In December 2005. eight persons were found to have
   been infected, and in May 2007 there was a single case of infection. The
   sources of all infections were domestic pigs. Artificial digestion of
   muscle samples from 681 pigs (325 free-range and 356 backyard pigs)
   revealed Trichinella sp. larvae in four sows (1.2\%). All larvae,
   including those from the consumed pork products, were identified as
   Trichinella britovi. All infected pigs originated from the Orgosolo
   municipality. None of the 6188 wild boars (Sus scrofa) or 13 red foxes
   (Vulpes vulpes) examined were positive for Trichinella sp., suggesting
   that this parasite is restricted to free-range pigs. The origin of
   infected animals on Sardinia remains to be determined, although it could
   be related to the presence of T. britovi-infected animals on the island
   of Corsica (France). (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {DNA vaccines encoding the glycoprotein genes of the salmonid
   rhabdoviruses VHSV and IHNV are very efficient in eliciting protective
   immune responses against their respective diseases in rainbow trout
   (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The early anti-viral response (EAVR) provides
   Protection by 4 days post vaccination and is non-specific and transient
   while the specific anti-viral response (SAVR) is long lasting and highly
   specific. Since both VHSV and IHNV are endemic in rainbow trout in
   several geographical regions of Europe and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)
   on the Pacific coast of North America, co-vaccination against the two
   diseases would be a preferable option. In the present study we
   demonstrated that a single injection of mixed DNA vaccines induced
   long-lasting protection against both individual and a simultaneous virus
   challenge 80 days post vaccination. Transfected muscle cells at the
   injection site expressed both G proteins. This study confirms the
   applied potential Of using a combined DNA vaccination for protection of
   fish against two different rhabdoviral diseases. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {A rapid method has been developed to analyse for firocoxib (FIRO)
   residue in bovine milk. Milk samples were extracted with acetonitrile
   and sample extracts were purified on Evolute (TM) ABN solid phase
   extraction cartridges. Aliquots were analysed by rapid resolution liquid
   chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (RRLC-MS/MS). The method was
   validated in bovine milk, according to the criteria defined in
   Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. The decision limit (CC alpha) was 1.18
   ng/mL and for the detection capability a (CC beta) value of 2.02 ng/mL
   was obtained. The measurement uncertainty of the method was 27\%.
   Fortifying bovine milk samples (n = 18) in three separate assays, show
   the accuracy of the method to be between 96 and 105\%. The precision of
   the method, expressed as RSD values for the within-lab reproducibility
   at the three levels of fortification (5, 7.5 and 10 ng/mL) was less than
   11\% respectively. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {MytiBase: a knowledgebase of mussel (M. galloprovincialis) transcribed

Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {10},
Month = {FEB 9},
Abstract = {Background: Although Bivalves are among the most studied marine
   organisms due to their ecological role, economic importance and use in
   pollution biomonitoring, very little information is available on the
   genome sequences of mussels. This study reports the functional analysis
   of a large-scale Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) sequencing from different
   tissues of Mytilus galloprovincialis (the Mediterranean mussel)
   challenged with toxic pollutants, temperature and potentially pathogenic
   bacteria.
   Results: We have constructed and sequenced seventeen cDNA libraries from
   different Mediterranean mussel tissues: gills, digestive gland, foot,
   anterior and posterior adductor muscle, mantle and haemocytes. A total
   of 24,939 clones were sequenced from these libraries generating 18,788
   high-quality ESTs which were assembled into 2,446 overlapping clusters
   and 4,666 singletons resulting in a total of 7,112 non-redundant
   sequences. In particular, a high-quality normalized cDNA library (Nor01)
   was constructed as determined by the high rate of gene discovery
   (65.6\%). Bioinformatic screening of the non-redundant M.
   galloprovincialis sequences identified 159 microsatellite-containing
   ESTs. Clusters, consensuses, related similarities and gene ontology
   searches have been organized in a dedicated, searchable database
   http://mussel.cribi.unipd.it.
   Conclusion: We defined the first species-specific catalogue of M.
   galloprovincialis ESTs including 7,112 unique transcribed sequences.
   Putative microsatellite markers were identified. This annotated
   catalogue represents a valuable platform for expression studies, marker
   validation and genetic linkage analysis for investigations in the
   biology of Mediterranean mussels.},

Title = {A novel family with Lamin B1 duplication associated with adult-onset

Abstract = {Background and aim: Duplication of the lamin B1 gene (LMNB1) has
   recently been described in a rare form of autosomal dominant adult-onset
   leucoencephalopathy. The aim of the study was to evaluate the presence
   of LMNB1 gene defects in a series of eight patients with diffuse
   adult-onset hereditary leucoencephalopathy.
   Methods: Clinical features of tested patients included a variable
   combination of pyramidal, cerebellar, cognitive and autonomic
   dysfunction. Neuroradiological data (MRI) showed symmetrical and diffuse
   white-matter lesions in six cases, and multifocal confluent lesions in
   two. LMNB1 full gene deletion/duplication and point mutations were
   searched using a TaqMan real-time PCR assay and direct sequencing of all
   coding exons.
   Results: One patient carried a 140-190 kb duplication involving the
   entire LMNB1 gene, the AX748201 transcript and the 39 end of the MARCH3
   gene. Clinical and neuroimaging data of this proband and an affected
   relative overlapped with the features already described in patients with
   LMNB1 duplication. Lamin B1 expression was found increased in
   lymphoblasts. No LMNB1 gene defect was identified in the remaining seven
   probands.
   Conclusions: LMNB1 gene duplication appears characteristic of a subset
   of adult-onset autosomal dominant leucoencephalopathies, sharing
   autonomic dysfunction at onset, diffuse T2-hyperintensity of supra- and
   infratentorial white matter, sparing of U-fibres and optic radiations.
   The variable phenotypes in the remaining cases lacking LMNB1 defects
   (five with autosomal dominant transmission) suggest that adult-onset
   leucoencephalopathies are genetically heterogeneous.},

Abstract = {The Virology Laboratory of the Central Laboratory of Animal Diseases in
   Ivory Coast at Bingerville received samples of wild and domestic avian
   species between February and December 2006. An RT-PCR technique was used
   to test for avian influenza (AI) and highly pathogenic AI subtype
   viruses. Among 2125 samples, 16 were type A positive; of which, 12 were
   later confirmed to be H5N1. Fifteen of these 16 type A positive samples
   were inoculated into the chorioallantoic cavity of 11-day-old
   embryonated hens' eggs for virus isolation. Eight produced virus with
   hemagglutination titres from 1/64 to 1/512. The 4/16 M-RT-PCR positive
   samples, which were H5N1 negative, were shown to be H7 subtype negative.
   The diagnostic efficiency of the laboratory for the surveillance of H5N1
   in Ivory Coast was demonstrated. The positive cases of H5N1 were from a
   sparrowhawk (Accipter nisus); live market poultry and in free-range
   poultry, where the mortality rate was approximately 20\% (2/10) and
   96.7\% (29/30) respectively. Currently, investigations into intensive
   poultry farms have proved negative for H5N1. No human cases have been
   reported this time.},

Abstract = {Four canine coronavirus type II (CCoV-II) strains were identified in the
   guts and internal organs of pups which had died of acute
   gastroenteritis. The CCoV-II strains were strictly related to porcine
   transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in the N-terminal domain of
   the spike protein, whereas in the other parts of the genome, a higher
   genetic relatedness to recent CCoV-II isolates was observed.
   Experimental infection of dogs with a TGEV-like isolate induced mild
   gastroenteritis without any systemic involvement. By virus
   neutralization tests, antigenic differences between reference and
   TGEV-like CCoVs were found. Our data support the potential recombinant
   origin of the TGEV-like CCoVs.},

Abstract = {The use of growth hormones, such as native and recombinant
   somatotropins, is forbidden in the European Union (EU), but is legal in
   the USA. The misuse of recombinant bovine somatotropin in Italy is
   suspected for enhancing milk production, thanks to its availability on
   the illegal market. A synthetic bioactive peptide of 27 amino acids
   derived from bovine somatotropin was successfully tested in France and
   in southern Italy for scientific purposes, to stimulate milk production,
   both in cows and buffaloes. This somatotropin-like peptide (PEP-ST),
   suspected for illegal use in southern Italy, was synthesized by linking
   the 104-113 sequence of bovine somatotropin to the 323-339 sequence of
   ovalbumin. Herein, a method for detection and identification of the
   PEP-ST in buffalo serum is described; our strategy was based on the
   production of IgG anti-PEP-ST, used to synthesize an immuno-affinity
   column for peptide purification from buffalo serum, prior to analysis by
   ion trap liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass
   spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS). The immuno-affinity column was successfully
   used to purify in a single step the bioactive PEP-ST from buffalo serum
   samples spiked at 20,50 and 200 mu g/mL for confirmatory analysis. Ion
   trap LC/ESI-MS/MS identification was based on detection of a
   multi-charged molecular ion and its characteristic fragmentation
   pattern. No significant matrix interference was observed, accounting for
   method specificity. We consider this strategy to be a basic approach
   that could be improved in the perspective of the official control of
   illegal use of somatotropin and somatotropin-like compounds in buffalo
   breeding. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {We carried out a survey in order to detect Coxiella burnetii, the agent
   of Q fever, in cows' bulk tank milk (BTM) sampled in 2007-2008 in 400
   dairy herds of three provinces of Northern Italy (Cremona, Mantova,
   Pavia). With this aim, we employed a PCR assay targeting a segment of
   the transposon-like genomic region. Overall, 161 BTM samples out of 400
   (i.e. 40\%) tested positive. We then collected a further BTM sample from
   several C. burnetii positive herds as well as from C. burnetii-negative
   herds, for confirming or excluding the result of the first assay. The
   second sample tested positive and negative, respectively, in about 62\%
   of positive herds and in about 70\% of negative herds. The detection of
   C. burnetii in cows' milk has been already documented in the past. The
   occurrence of the organism in BTM depends on the number of infected
   lactating cows and on the presence of C. burnetii super-shedders in the
   herd. An increase or decrease in the number of milk-shedder cows will
   accordingly affect the result of the BTM testing. The effects of the
   infection on the fertility of cows, as well as the implications for the
   health of professionally and accidentally exposed humans should be
   investigated.},

Abstract = {Equine rhinitis A and B viruses (ERAV and ERBV) are respiratory viruses
   of horses belonging to the family Picornaviridae. Although these viruses
   are considered to cause respiratory disease in horses and are
   potentially infectious for humans, little is known about their
   prevalence and pathogenesis. Virus isolation is often unsuccessful due
   to their inefficient growth and lack of cytopathic effect in cell
   cultures, Therefore, molecular assays should be considered as the method
   of choice to detect infection in symptomatic or apparently healthy
   horses. In the present study, a novel real-time duplex PCR was developed
   for the detection and differentiation of both ERAV and ERBV. The method
   was evaluated for its ability to detect viral RNA in cell culture
   supernatants and nasal swabs, and lung and urine spiked with known
   quantities of virus. The assay demonstrated high analytical specificity,
   sensitivity and good reproducibility, with coefficients of variation
   (CV\%) ranging from 1\% to 7.4\% and from 1.2\% to 12\% for intra- and
   inter-assay variability respectively. The assay detected ERBV in 14 of
   86 nasal swabs collected from horses with respiratory disease. The
   real-time duplex PCR is a useful new diagnostic method for the rapid
   detection and differentiation of ERAV and ERBV. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Pulmonary inflammation often results in expression of the class II major
   histocompatibility complex (MHCII) by both professional
   antigen-presenting cells (APCs; histiocytes and lymphocytes) and
   non-professional APCs (respiratory epithelium and endothelium). In this
   study lesions from 17 cases of bovine chronic pneumonia, associated with
   Mycoplasma bovis infection, were examined immunohistochemically for M.
   bovis antigen and MHCII expression. Ten cases of chronic
   necrosuppurative bronchopneumonia (NBP) were shown to be characterized
   by abundant perinecrotic M. bovis antigen associated with scant MHCII
   expression by degenerate leucocytes. Seven cases of chronic catarrhal
   bronchointerstitial pneumonia (CBP) showed prominent MHCII expression by
   both professional APCs and respiratory epithelium, in the absence of
   intralesional M. bovis immunolabelling. The results suggest that
   prominent MHCII expression by both professional and non-professional
   APCs plays a role in the pathogenesis of M. bovis-induced CBP.
   Conversely, the role of MHCII expression in necrosuppurative foci
   typical of M. bovis-associated NBP can be considered negligible. (C)

   and the epidemiological data as independent variables. Twenty-eight
   (17.3\%) and 12 (18.5\%) cats were positive for A. obstrusus in site A
   and B, respectively, both using the Baermann and flotation with zinc
   sulfate solution methods. Six (site A) and three (site B) of the
   infected cats were negative for A. abstrusus when faeces were subjected
   to the sugar solution flotation. Stray and free-ranging, young cats and
   the presence of respiratory symptoms were statistically correlated to
   the infection. This study suggest that A. abstrusus is spread in Italy
   and that the infection should be included in the differential diagnosis
   of feline respiratory diseases.},

Abstract = {Few studies describe the parasites of pigs bred in the wild state,
   although pigs are a known reservoir of trematode infestation. This
   article reports the results of a retrospective Study carried Out from
   January 2003 to June 2007 on 3021 Nebrodi Black male and female pigs,
   regularly slaughtered, aged between 8 months and 4 years. Fasciola
   hepatica and Dicrocoelium dendriticum flukes were detected in 143
   (4.37\%) of 3021 livers. The predominant histological features were
   multifocal to diffuse chronic hepatitis, with fibrosis and severely
   thickened walls of the bile ducts and chronic parietal, Sometimes
   nodular inflammation. F. hepatica infestation was frequently associated
   with marked hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the submucosal glands. The
   Study results confirm the important role swine play in the transmission
   of trematode infestations, indicate the prevalence of these parasites in
   the Nebrodi Park area, and draw attention to the need for a prophylaxis
   plan to prevent the spread of infestation to ruminants and humans living
   in the area. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {L monocytogenes represents a primary concern in the production of
   Gorgonzola, a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) Italian blue-veined
   cheese produced only in the Piedmont and Lombardy regions. L
   monocytogenes isolates (N=95) obtained from Gorgonzola rinds, paste, and
   production/ripening environments were serotyped and then genotyped using
   Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). The goal of this study was to
   investigate the variability of L monocytogenes PFGE-types across
   different PDO Gorgonzola manufacturers (N=22).
   The majority of the strains (88\%) were serotyped as 1/2a. PFGE
   identified 2 major pulse-types grouping 62 strains, detected from
   different plants and years, suggesting the presence of persistent and
   niche-adapted L monocytogenes. In 9 plants, environmental strains shared
   the same pulse-types with strains from rinds or paste, suggesting a
   possible transmission pathway. Encouragingly, L monocytogenes was
   retrieved from only 1 paste, indicating that production processes were
   under control in 21 plants. In the remaining plant, uneffective
   pasteurization or cross-contamination during production processes could
   be the cause of the contamination. Consequently, it is imperative that
   producers operate under the total respect of the Good Manufacturing
   Practices and following the principles of the Hazard Analysis Critical
   Control Point plans, in order to contain contamination throughout the
   whole processing. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Immune system response to stress factors},
Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {287-299},
Abstract = {This review highlights fundamental mechanisms of the stress response and
   important findings as to how the immune system is affected and affects,
   in turn, such a response. The crucial link between stress response and
   energy metabolism is dealt with as well. The effector mechanisms in the
   stress response are remarkably similar for both infectious and
   non-infectious stimuli, albeit differently modulated. ``Psycho-sensitive
   stimuli/behavioural response{''} and ``Antigenic stimuli/immune
   response{''} are indeed two subsystems of a unitary, integrated complex
   aimed at providing optimal conditions for the host's survival and
   adaptation.
   The interaction between the immune system and the stress/inflammation
   complex has led to the development of a diversified network of cytokines
   and chemokines in vertebrate animals. The cytokine response can be
   mounted in different forms and extent by the host after exposure to both
   infectious and non-infectious stimuli. In this conceptual framework,
   microbial infections are just one category of stressing agents, which
   modulate the cytokine response for a better performance of the innate
   and adaptive immune responses.
   The response to infectious and non-infectious stress leads to a
   metabolic shift that enhances energy, amino acids and micronutrients
   consumption. The influence of each nutrient on different aspects of
   immune function is not easy to define, but it is becoming clear that
   many nutrients have defined roles in the immune response and,
   accordingly, their requirements are changed to support optimal immune
   function. Therefore, impairment of immune functions may arise from
   intakes of nutrients below or above these modified ranges of
   requirements.},

Abstract = {Sixteen Italian dairy water buffaloes were used to demonstrate a
   relationship between teat anatomy and vacuum needed to open the teat
   canal (VO) and to investigate the amount and composition of cisternal
   and alveolar milk. Teat length, teat canal length, teat cistern
   diameter, and teat wall thickness were similar in front and rear teats
   except for the teat diameter which was greater in rear than in front
   teats. VO was measured on a wetted teat canal without liner and
   pulsation. Only twelve quarters out of 30 showed milk flow at a vacuum
   up to 45 kPa. In these quarters VO correlated with the teat canal
   length, the teat wall thickness and the cisternal diameter (r=0.82,
   r=0.62, r=-0.65, respectively, P < 0.01). It remains however unclear
   which anatomical characteristics prevent milk flow at a vacuum up to 45
   kPa in the majority of quarters investigated. Somatic cell count (SCC),
   milk yield, fat, lactose, protein and dry matter were measured in the
   cisternal and alveolar fractions. SCC, fat and dry matter remained
   similar while lactose and protein were significantly higher in the
   alveolar than cisternal fraction.},

Title = {Residues of antibacterial drugs in honey from the Italian market},
Journal = {FOOD ADDITIVES \& CONTAMINANTS PART B-SURVEILLANCE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Pages = {52-58},
Abstract = {Antibacterial drugs are used worldwide for the control of American and,
   less often, European foulbrood. Their administration is mostly
   uncontrolled and applied without approved protocols and instructions for
   use as well as precautionary recommendations. Consequently, this
   practice is responsible for the contamination of beehive products and
   contributes to the problem of food safety. According to this situation,
   4672 analyses were carried out on 5303 honeys collected from 2001 to
   2007. These samples were investigated for antibacterial residues of
   tetracyclines, sulphonamides, streptomycin, chloramphenicol and tylosin.
   Honeys were classified according to their origin: imported honey and
   honey from the Italian market. In the last group (only for samples
   collected from 2001 to 2004), another type of honey was distinguished:
   that of local honey. A total of 6.3\% of all samples were positive for
   the antibacterial drugs analysed; in particular, 6.8\% of imported
   honeys and 6.1\% of honeys on the Italian market. Only 1.7\% of local
   honey had antibacterial residues. These results are indicative of a
   rather frequent presence of antibacterial drug residues in both Italian
   and imported honeys. Furthermore, the data showed that among the active
   substances analysed, sulphonamides are the most used antibacterial
   substance followed by tetracyclines, streptomycin, tylosin, and
   chloramphenicol. Finally, a continuous monitoring programme is needed,
   accompanied by an education programme to beekeepers on proper hive
   management.},

Pages = {193-200},
Abstract = {The extensive circulation of the H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza
   virus, and the human health threat that it poses, has raised concerns
   over the food safety implications of this virus infecting poultry. In
   addition, among the most important risk factors for the possible
   emergence of avian influenza in the European Union and the United
   States, the European and Food Safety Agency and the US Department of
   Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, respectively,
   have identified legal and illegal importations of infected poultry
   commodities. The present paper reviews existing knowledge on the
   presence of viable avian influenza viruses in poultry commodities.},

   for active surveillance plans on TSEs of sheep and goats in the EU
   Member States. To reach the sampling rate required by the European
   Commission, the Italian Ministry of Health adopted in April 2005 a
   program that provides for the systematic testing of all animals found
   dead. Even in Italy, the prevalence data by risk category (healthy
   slaughtered vs. animals found dead) confirmed that the chances of
   detection of the disease were much higher in rendering plants than in
   slaughterhouses. Our work was designed to check whether the geographic
   distribution of animals tested in rendering plants may be used to
   evaluate the efficacy of the monitoring system for scrapie. It was also
   designed to determine whether the level of surveillance in the various
   regions had been homogeneous over the years.},

Volume = {2},

Note = {4th Symposium on Canine Vector-Borne Diseases, Seville, SPAIN, MAR
   25-28, 2009},
Abstract = {Rickettsia felis is an obligate intracellular bacterium belonging to the
   spotted fever group, suspected to cause a murine typhus-like illness in
   humans, with a cosmopolitan distribution. This study was designed to
   estimate presence and occurrence of this pathogen in fleas collected
   from dogs and cats in different areas of Italy. Two species of fleas
   were identified, Ctenocephalides felis (80.3\%) and Ctenocephalides
   canis (19.7\%).
   Overall, 320 fleas (257 C. felis and 63 C. canis) collected from 117
   animals (73 dogs and 44 cats) were tested. Thirty-eight (11.9\%) C.
   felis fleas, 13 from cats (17.6\%) and 25 from dogs (10.2\%) were
   positive for R. felis. No C. canis was positive. Fleas from cats showed
   a tendency to be more positive than fleas from dogs. Prevalence of R.
   felis among areas and within provinces of the same area was extremely
   variable, ranging from 0 to 35.3\%. Overall, prevalence in north-eastern
   Italy (23.2\%) was significantly higher than in south-western Italy
   (7.1\%). This study confirmed the occurrence of R. felis in cat and dog
   fleas (C. felis) from Italy, similar to other European countries. The
   results also suggest that R. felis should be considered in the human
   differential diagnosis of any spotted-like fever in Italy, especially if
   the patient is known to have been exposed to flea bites.},

Title = {Transplantation of Allogeneic and Xenogeneic Placenta-Derived Cells
   Reduces Bleomycin-Induced Lung Fibrosis},
Journal = {CELL TRANSPLANTATION},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Pages = {405-422},
Abstract = {Fetal membranes (amnion and chorion) have recently raised significant
   attention as potential sources of stem cells. We have recently
   demonstrated that cells derived from human term placenta show stem cell
   phenotype, high plasticity, and display low immunogenicity both in vitro
   and in vivo. Moreover, placenta-derived cells, after
   xenotransplantation, are able to engraft in solid organs including the
   lung. On these bases, we studied the effects of fetal membrane-derived
   cells on a mouse model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Fetal
   membrane-derived cells were infused 15 min after intratracheal bleomycin
   instillation. Different delivery routes were used: intraperitoneal or
   intratracheal for both xenogeneic and allogeneic cells. and intravenous
   for allogeneic cells. The effects of the transplanted cells on
   bleomycin-induced inflammatory and fibrotic processes were then scored
   and compared between transplanted and control animals at different time
   points. By PCR and immunohistochemistry analyses, we demonstrated the
   presence of transplanted cells 3, 7, 9, and 14 days after
   transplantation. Concomitantly, we observed a clear decrease in
   neutrophil infiltration and a significant reduction in the severity of
   bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice treated with placenta-derived
   cells, irrespective of the source (allogeneic or xenogeneic) or delivery
   route. Our findings constitute further evidence in support of the
   hypothesis that placenta-derived cells could be useful for clinical
   application, and warrant further studies toward the use of these cells
   for the repair of tissue damage associated with inflammatory and
   fibrotic degeneration.},

   30 BCoV-antibody negative 2-3-month-old calves. At 30 days
   post-vaccination, all vaccinated calves displayed high antibody titres

Abstract = {During a 6 week trial in summer, 3 homogeneous groups, each consisting
   of 5 Comisana ewes and 5 Rossa Mediterranea goats, grazed watered forage
   resources during day (D) or night (N), or were housed indoor and
   supplied with mowed herbage (H). Maximum THI peaked at 94 at the end of
   July, and was almost constantly higher of 80. Milk yield was higher in N
   than in D and H goats, whereas N ewes produced more milk than H group,
   but their milk yield was higher than D ewes only in the period with the
   highest THI values. The lower urea in N goat milk, and the higher casein
   in N ewe milk, seem to indicate a better efficiency in dietary nitrogen
   utilization of night grazing animals. N ewes showed lower SCC in milk,
   and higher incidence of clotting milk samples, in comparison to other
   ewes. N goats and ewes showed lower rectal temperature and pulse rate in
   the afternoon and, among metabolic parameters, higher hematic level of
   sodium. Night grazing was confirmed to be a management practice for
   increasing heat tolerance, to which goats appeared to be more sensitive
   in terms of milk yield.},

Title = {Osteocyte lacunae features in different chicken bones},
Journal = {BIOTECHNOLOGIE AGRONOMIE SOCIETE ET ENVIRONNEMENT},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {29-32},
Abstract = {Directive 2003/126/EC defines the method for the determination of
   constituents of animal origin for official control of feedingstuffs. One
   of the hardest problems for microscopist is the differentiation between
   mammalian and poultry bones oil the basis of some characteristics as
   colour and borders of the fragments, shape and density of osteocyte
   lacunae. The shape of osteocyte lacuna in poultry and mammals is often
   described in different way, elliptic or roundish according with the
   Author(s). The aim of this study was to analyze the characteristics of
   lacunae in chicken bones of different type. For this purpose, smashed
   fragments and histological sections of the same bone were compared in
   order to evaluate the microscopic aspect of lacunae in different
   breaking and trimming planes. According to the observations carried out,
   it was possible to infer that chicken osteocyte has a biconvex lens
   shape; however the different arrangement and some size variation of the
   osteocytes in the several bone segments influence the microscopic
   features of corresponding lacunae. Chicken bone is made of a
   parallel-fibered tissue, without osteons. This structure probably
   determines the plane fracture of the bone and consequently the different
   aspect of lacunae (from spindle-shaped to elliptic-roundish) we call see
   in chicken derived PAP (processed animal protein). For example, in the
   fragments obtained from smashed diaphysis, the prevalence of
   spindle-shaped lacunae is depending oil the preferential breaking of the
   bone along longitudinal plane. Likewise, for the epiphysis, being made
   mostly by bone trabeculae with strange directions, the breaking happens
   along different planes, creating lacunae of various shape. Performing
   the official check of animal feedingstuffs, the presence of bone
   fragments with roundish or elliptic osteocyte lacunae induces the
   analyst to thinking that the meat and bone meal conics respectively from
   mammals and poultry or vice versa depending to the reference Author(s);
   apart from the final evaluation (also based on some other features of
   the fragments), it is important to consider that the chicken bones could
   show lacunae of different shapes (spindle, elliptic and roundish), in
   accordance with the type and the breaking of the involved skeleton
   segments.},

Title = {Development and laboratory validation of a lateral flow device for the

Abstract = {A lateral flow device (LFD) for the detection of all seven serotypes of
   foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) was developed Using a monoclonal
   antibody (Mab 1F10) shown to be pan-reactive to FMDV strains of each
   serotype by ELISA. The performance of the LFD was evaluated in the
   laboratory on suspensions of vesicular epithelia (304 positive and 1003
   negative samples) from suspected cases of vesicular disease collected
   from 86 countries between 1965 and 2008 and negative samples collected
   from healthy animals. The diagnostic sensitivity of the LFD for FMDV was
   similar at 84\% compared to 85\% obtained by the reference method of
   antigen ELISA, and the diagnostic specificity of the LFD was
   approximately 99\% compared to 99.9\% for the ELISA. The device
   recognized FMDV strains of wide diversity of all seven serotypes but
   weaker reactions were often evident with those of type SAT 2, several
   viruses of which were not detected. Reactions with the viruses of swine
   vesicular disease and vesicular stomatitis that produce clinically
   indistinguishable syndromes in pigs and cattle, did not occur. The test
   procedure was simple and rapid, and typically provided a result within
   1-10 min of sample addition. Simple homogenizers that could be used in
   field conditions for preparing epithelial suspensions were demonstrated
   to be effective for LFD application. These data illustrate the potential
   for the LFD to be used next to the animal in the pen-side diagnosis of
   FMD and for providing rapid and objective support to veterinarians in
   their clinical judgment of the disease. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Absence of TARDBP Gene Mutations in an Italian Series of Patients with

Abstract = {Background/Aim: Recent studies showed that TAR DNA-binding protein 43
   (TDP-43), encoded by the TARDBP gene, is a major pathological protein in
   both sporadic and familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). The
   aim of this study was to search for mutations of the TARDBP gene in the
   disease. Methods: We sequenced the TARDBP gene in 172 unrelated FTLD
   patients recruited from 2 Italian memory clinics. Results: We identified
   3 different variants of the TARDBP gene in 12 FTLD patients. Three
   patients showed a silent variant, Ala66Ala (c.332T -> C) in exon 2. A
   novel heterozygous mutation was found in intron 4 (c. 543 + 51A -> G) in
   1 patient, which is not located at the splicing site. Finally, a c. 208C
   -> T variant in the 3' untranslated region was detected in 8 probands.
   None of the aforementioned variants were predicted to affect TDP-43.
   Hence, pathogenic mutations were not identified in any of the FTLD
   cases. Conclusion: Our study, in accord with previous studies in
   different populations, found no evidence for a major genetic role of the
   TARDBP gene in FTLD. Copyright (C) 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {In human neurology, patients with Alzheimer's disease show seizures and
   signs of motor deficits, such as movement disorders (i.e., restlessness,
   slowness, impaired gait, and, rarely, resting tremors). Because canine
   Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome (CDS) is considered an Alzheimer-like
   disease in dogs, it might be possible to document concurrent behavioral
   and neurologic signs in aging canine patients as well. Twenty-one dogs
   (14 dogs with CDS-related signs, 7 normal (logs) greater than 7 years of
   age were studied. Owners completed a behavioral questionnaire and the
   dogs underwent a neurologic evaluation. Dogs with CDS were twice as
   likely to show neurologic deficits as dogs without CDS. However, based
   on this pilot Study, it sample of 187 dogs affected with CDS are
   required to show statistically significant differences between the
   proportions of dogs with CDS and with neurologic signs and the
   proportions of control clogs without any of these disorders, (c) 2009

Abstract = {Background Infections of wild birds with highly pathogenic avian
   influenza (AI) subtype H5N1 virus were reported for the first time in
   the European Union in 2006.
   Objectives To capture epidemiological information on H5N1 HPAI in wild
   bird populations through large-scale surveillance and extensive data
   collection.
   Methods Records were analysed at bird level to explore the epidemiology
   of AI with regard to species of wild birds involved, timing and location
   of infections as well as the applicability of different surveillance
   types for the detection of infections.
   Results In total, 120,706 records of birds were sent to the Community
   Reference Laboratory for analysis. Incidents of H5N1 HPAI in wild birds
   were detected in 14 EU Member States during 2006. All of these incidents
   occurred between February and May, with the exception of two single
   cases during the summer months in Germany and Spain.
   Conclusions For the detection of H5N1 HPAI virus, passive surveillance
   of dead or diseased birds appeared the most effective approach, whilst
   active surveillance offered better detection of low pathogenic avian
   influenza (LPAI) viruses. No carrier species for H5N1 HPAI virus could
   be identified and almost all birds infected with H5N1 HPAI virus were
   either dead or showed clinical signs. A very large number of Mallards
   (Anas platyrhynchos) were tested in 2006 and while a high proportion of
   LPAI infections were found in this species, H5N1 HPAI virus was rarely
   identified in these birds. Orders of species that appeared to be very
   clinically susceptible to H5N1 HPAI virus were swans, diving ducks,
   mergansers and grebes, supporting experimental evidence. Surveillance
   results indicate that H5N1 HPAI virus did not establish itself
   successfully in the EU wild bird population in 2006.},

Title = {Isolation and identification of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1

Abstract = {Highly pathogenic influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 has caused mortality and
   morbidity in many species of domestic and wild bird. The Houbara bustard
   (Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii) is a solitary bird that inhabits
   semi-desert regions. It is known to be susceptible to avianpox, avian
   paramyxovirus type 1, and low-pathogenicity avian influenza H9N2. We
   report an outbreak of H5N1 HPAIV in Houbara bustards, which were
   introduced into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for falconry purposes.
   Ninety-three per cent mortality (38 out of 41 birds) in the infected
   Houbara bustard flock and about 62.5\% mortality (10 out of 16 birds) in
   falcons that came in contact with these birds were observed. Pooled
   cloacal and tracheal swabs from Houbara bustards as well as visceral
   organ homogenates collected in Houbara bustards and falcons were tested
   by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and virus
   isolation was attempted in specific pathogen free hens' eggs. The
   viruses isolated were characterized as HPAIV H5N1. Phylogenetic analysis
   of the haemagglutinating and Neuraminidase (NA) genes revealed that the
   viruses isolated from Houbara bustards and falcons were closely related
   to each other and to Kuwaiti H5N1 strains isolated in 2007.
   Interestingly, they were genetically distinguishable from the
   co-circulating A/H5N1 viruses in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia causing
   outbreaks in domestic birds. This case emphasizes the need for
   surveillance of this endangered species in its natural habitat.},

   needed to evaluate the role played by fox populations as reservoirs of
   infection and the probability of its spreading to domestic dogs.},

Abstract = {The research was carried out on Asiago d'Allevo cheese samples produced
   in a single farm located in the Altopiano dei Sette Comuni (above 1000m
   a.s.l.). After 6-12-18 and 36 months of ripening, samples were analyzed
   for quality traits, in order to evaluate the effect of ripening on
   colour and gross composition. As expected crude protein and fat
   significantly increased through the considered period. Ripening led to a
   significant decrease of L{*}, a{*} and b{*} values. Lightness showed a
   negative relationship with crude protein, meanwhile a{*} and b{*} were
   both negatively related to fat content. Concerning L{*}, the trend could
   be explained by water loss and N-soluble compounds concentration, which
   could alter protein matrix. a{*} and b{*} reduction was probably related
   to degradation processes such as lipolysis, which seemed to be extensive
   in hard and long ripened cheese. Ripening affected significantly the
   light reflectance at all lambda with green cheese having the higher
   values.},

Abstract = {Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is an important pathogen that
   primarily infects ruminants, leading to several clinical problems
   including abortion. BVDV-specific antibodies were reported in it wide
   range of hosts within domestic and wildlife animal populations, and
   serological studies also indicated BVDV infection in buffaloes. The
   purpose of this study was to analyze the presence of BVDV in 2 water
   buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) herds with it history of abortion. Virus
   isolation from aborted fetuses and from maternal buffy coat and the
   molecular characterization of the isolates confirmed the presence of
   BVDV in these animals. The sequence analysis based on the 5' UTR and
   N-pro coding regions of the Pestivirus genome revealed that the isolates
   belong to subgenotype 1b of BVDV. The findings of this study also
   suggest a possible role of BVDV in causing congenital infection in water
   buffalo. Its presence in fetal tissues as well as in maternal blood
   raises questions about the possible development of clinical disease or
   its influence in abortions in water buffalo.},

Title = {Antibody status and survival of Australian wild rabbits challenged with
   rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {36},
Number = {5},
Pages = {447-456},
Abstract = {In Australia, the epidemiology of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus
   (RHDV) is complicated by nonpathogenic forms of calicivirus (bCV)
   co-circulating with RHDV and providing variable protection from RHDV.
   Currently no bCV virus-specific antibody tests exist; however, a series
   of four ELISAs used to detect antibodies to RHDV provided an indirect
   means to detect antibodies to bCV, enabling antibody categories of
   seronegative, maternal RHDV, RHDV or bCV to be determined. Rabbits (188)
   from four locations were challenged with RHDV and logistic regression
   models determined that, for rabbits <15 months old, survival was
   dependent on antibody titres alone and the relationship did not vary
   with age, capture site, gender, liveweight or reproductive status. All
   rabbits survived challenge after reaching 15 months of age, irrespective
   of their antibody titres. Where bCV antibodies were prevalent in young
   rabbits, the bCV category did not adequately summarise all information
   about rabbit survival that can be obtained from antibody titres. Within
   antibody categories, 95\% of rabbits with RHDV, 33\% with bCV, 40\% with
   maternal RHDV and 22\% with seronegative antibodies survived. The high
   survival rate of adults implies that natural outbreaks or controlled
   releases of RHDV will have little impact on adult breeding rabbits.
   Therefore, where RHDV and bCV are endemic, conventional rabbit-control
   programs targeting the immune breeding populations should provide the
   most predictable outcome for long-term maintenance of low rabbit
   populations.},

Abstract = {A sensitive and selective analytical method for the simultaneous
   separation and quantitative determination of aflatoxins B1, B2, G1 and
   G2 in foodstuffs and materials for feed has been validated. The method
   is based on high performance liquid chromatography with on-line
   post-column photochemical derivatization and fluorescence detection. The
   chromatographic separation of aflatoxins was accomplished using a C18
   column eluted with an isocratic mobile phase consisting of water,
   methanol and acetonitrile. The sample preparation required a simple
   extraction of aflatoxins with MeOH/H2O (80:20, v/v) and a purification
   step by immunoaffinity column cleanup. The total analysis time,
   including sample preparation and chromatographic separation, did not
   exceed 40 min with a run time of 10 min. The on-line photochemical
   derivatization ensures better results in terms of simplicity,
   sensitivity and reproducibility with respect to chemical derivatization
   techniques, and provides an increase of the peak resolution and an
   extent of automation in comparison with the electrochemical ones. The
   procedure for the determination of aflatoxins in food samples and
   cereals for animal consumption was extensively validated following
   Regulation (EC) No. 882/2004. Detection limits in wheat bran samples of
   0.08 mu g kg-1 for AFB1, 0.02 mu g kg-1 for AFB2, 0.16 mu g kg-1 for
   AFG1 and 0.04 mu g kg-1 for AFG2 were attained. The method allows high
   recovery with mean values ranging from 72 to 94\% and it satisfies the
   necessary requirements for sensitivity, linearity, selectivity,
   precision and ruggedness, demonstrating the conformity of the method
   with provisions of Regulation (EC) No. 401/2006.},

Abstract = {Ecological and climatic changes, human and animal population dynamics
   are among the several factors that have favoured the spread or the (re)
   introduction and establishment of ``novel{''} vector species and
   pathogens they transmit in previously disease-free geographical areas.
   As key examples of the changing pattern of distribution of canine vector
   borne diseases (CVBDs), the current distribution of canine leishmaniosis
   (CanL) by Leishmania infantum and dirofilariosis by Dirofilaria immitis
   causing heart worm disease (HW) in Italy is discussed on the basis of
   retrospective historical reports until the 90's and later on until 2009.
   For long time, D. immitis has been considered mainly present along the
   Po River Valley and northward areas, while L. infantum in south-central
   Italy and Sicily and Sardinia. Comparison of current available and
   historical data (up to 1989) confirms that HW and CanL, although with
   different prevalence rates, have been changing their distribution
   patterns in Italy as a result of many biological and ecological factors,
   including those related to vector distribution and introduction of new
   species (e. g. the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus, a competent
   vector of D. immitis). New autochthonous foci of HW in southern Italy
   (i.e. Apulia and Calabria regions) have recently been reported.
   Although analysing retrospective data may represent a difficult task,
   the ``paradigm{''} about the dual distribution of HW and CanL in
   northern and southern Italy cannot yet be considered valid. The research
   needs for managing HW and CanL in previously uninfected areas are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {The authors studied the course of serum proteins during the first week
   and the first month of life in the calf in order to obtain useful
   information for neonatal care. Eight Limousine calves, four males and
   four females, clinically healthy, were used. From all animals blood
   samples were collected from the externa jugular vein from the day after
   the birth every day for one week and every five days for thirty days.
   Blood samples were taken at the same hour (09:00), and the serum
   concentrations of albumin, globulins (alpha 1-globulins, (alpha
   2-globulins, beta-globulins, gamma-globulins) and total proteins were
   determined by means of automated multiparametric agarose gel
   electrophoresis system. One-way repeated measures analysis of variance
   (ANOVA), followed by the Bonferroni's test, was used to determine
   significant differences. Data analysis of variance showed a significant
   effect of days of life, with p < 0.05, only on albumin, alpha
   1-globulins and alpha 2-globulins during the first month of life. These
   results confirm that despite the fact that newborns must adapt to
   various environmental factors after birth, including nutrition that can
   influence the serum protein profile during neonatal period, the
   evaluation of electrophoretic's parameters during the first months of
   life results useful for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal
   diseases.},

Abstract = {The notion of knowledge object is central to the modern company due to
   the increasing awareness of the need of properly managing knowledge.
   Still, there is no clear idea on how to understand this notion, let
   alone characterize it. Information technology (IT) is of little help on
   this issue. It has been focussing almost exclusively toward the
   regulation of data types, data flows and their management; the complex
   interaction between information and the human agents, one of the
   characteristics of knowledge, is unfortunately disregarded. If we aim to
   develop systems for intellectual capital and knowledge management, we
   need to study notions like knowledge object, knowledge transfer and
   knowledge measurement. Here we make a first step in this direction by
   setting the basis for an analysis of (a class of) knowledge objects with
   which we highlight some interesting behaviour and dependences. The
   approach we follow is based on the ontological perspective and is driven
   by questions like: what is a knowledge object, what composes a knowledge
   object, how do knowledge objects change? These topics are complex for a
   variety of reasons and we make some simplifying assumptions by working
   in a standardized environment where the relationship between data and
   knowledge is fairly intuitive. Clearly, the general framework that we
   want to develop has to do justice of a series of elements (from
   activities to data, from physical entities to agents' role) that cannot
   be introduced in a single paper. We limit our presentation to just a few
   basic notions designed for a generic domain and take advantage of our
   guiding scenario to show how these can be exploited in specific
   contexts. The case study is given by the Istituto Zooprofilattico
   Sperimentale delle Venezie (IZSVE), a veterinary public health institute
   that conducts laboratory controls and research activities in three main
   areas: animal health and welfare, food safety, and environmental
   protection. Ideally, the IZSVE receives samples of material with some
   accompanying information (date, owner, typology etc.) and decides to run
   analyses to establish properties of the material or to detect infectious
   agents. In our theoretical perspective, the IZSVE receives a complex
   object in the form of a pair (M,D) constituted by a piece of material
   (M) and relative data (D), and exercises its knowledge with the goal of
   extracting new data. The process relies in manipulations of M and of D
   causing a variety of changes in M (from reduction in size to biochemical
   alteration to complete destruction) while data D evolve. Calling (M',D')
   the material and relative information we have at the end of an activity,
   our aim is to understand and describe the relationship between (M,D) and
   (M',D') in the perspective of organization IZSVE. Thus, we view
   knowledge objects as triples (M,D,O), where O is an agent, e.g. IZSVE, a
   department or a technician, and focus on the relationship between the
   first two components in the perspective of the third.

Abstract = {Fifty Polish Friesian veal calves were administrated high amounts of two
   different solid feeds (maize grain and a mix diet containing 10\% of
   straw and 8\% of soy) in addition to the traditional milk replacer diet.
   Compared to the mix diet, maize grain had a lower content of iron,
   copper and zinc and a minor fibre level. Effects of the two diets on
   calves' blood haemoglobin, iron, iron metabolism parameters, copper and
   zinc concentrations were studied. Haemoglobin concentration resulted
   higher at the end of the fattening for calves fed the mix diet, as
   expected. Values remained, however, within ranges that allowed
   acceptable carcass paleness. Haematic iron, unsaturated iron binding
   capacity (UIBC) and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) levels were not
   significantly different between the two solid feeds. Lower copper and
   zinc blood concentrations resulted for calves fed the mix diet were
   likely due to the feed fibre interfering with the bioavailability of the
   two minerals, according to what happens for iron.},

   area was greatest at 7 days from lambing, it diminished on day 30 and 60
   of lactation and it increased thereafter on day 150 of lactation and on
   day 7 of involution. The evolution of mammary tissues shows a clear
   decrease in stromal mass from prepartum until 60 DIM. Structural changes
   of mammary tissues during late pregnancy, lactation and dry off, can be
   used as a basis to estimate the evolution of the number of secretory

Abstract = {The chamois provides an excellent model for exploring the effect of
   historical and evolutionary events on diversification. We investigate
   cytochrome b (cytb) sequences in the 10 recognized subspecies of
   Rupicapra classified within 2 species: Rupicapra pyrenaica, with the
   subspecies parva, pyrenaica, and ornata, and Rupicapra rupicapra, with
   cartusiana, rupicapra, tatrica, carpatica, balcanica, asiatica, and
   caucasica. A fragment of 349 bp of the cytb was sequenced in 189
   individuals. We identified 3 cytb lineages: Clade West in Iberia and
   Western Alps; Clade Central in the Apennines and the Massif of
   Chartreuse; and Clade East present in populations to the east of the
   Alps. The 2 proposed species were polyphyletic; the clades West and
   Central are represented in both, whereas the Clade East is restricted to
   R. rupicapra. In contrast to the current systematic, cytb phylogenies
   suggest the classification of the 10 subspecies of chamois into a single
   species, R. rupicapra. Phylogeny and geographical distribution of the 3
   lineages show the effects of limited latitudinal range expansions,
   contractions, and hybridizations among highly divergent lineages, along
   with a major role of the glacial ice sheets of the Alps and the Pyrenees
   as barriers to gene flow, on the diversification of extant taxa.},

   16 animals each. One group was vaccinated subcutaneously (s/c) With two
   injections Of bivalent inactivated vaccine at a 28-day interval, and the
   second group was left unvaccinated and used as control. Sixty-five days
   after first vaccination. 8 vaccinated and 8 unvaccinated calves were s/c
   challenged with 1 mL of 6.2 Log 10 TCID50/mL of an Italian field isolate
   of BTV serotype 2. while the remaining 8 vaccinated and 8 unvaccinated
   animals were challenged by 1 mL of 6.2 Log 10 TCID50/mL of an Italian
   field isolate of BTV serotype 4. Three additional calves were included
   in the study and used as sentinels to confirm that no BTV was
   circulating locally. At the little of The challenge, only one vaccinated
   animal did not have neutralizing antibodies against BTV-4. while the
   remaining 15 showed lures of at least 1:10 for either BTV-2 or BTV-4.
   However. The BTV-2 component of the inactivated vaccine elicited a
   stronger immune response in terms of both the number of virus
   neutralization (VN) positive animals and antibody titres. After
   challenge, no animal showed signs of disease. Similarly, none of the
   vaccinated animals developed detectable viraemia While bluetongue Virus
   serotype 2 and 4 titres were detected in the circulating blood of all
   unvaccinated animals, commencing oil day 3 post-challenge and lasting 16
   days. It is concluded that administration of the bivalent BTV-2 and
   BTV-4 inactivated vaccine resulted in a complete prevention of
   detectable viraemia in all calves when challenged with high doses of
   BTV-2 or BTV-4. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Egg quality traits and some blood parameters of Bianca di Saluzzo hen
   (BSh) were compared to Isa Brown hen (IBh). Birds were reared in free
   range conditions. Weight of the whole egg was higher (P <= 0.01) for
   IBh, due to its higher amount of albumen (P <= 0.01) whereas BSh egg
   showed the highest weight and relative percentage of yolk (P <= 0.01).
   IBh and BSh egg chemical composition was similar. Total red cells did
   not show statistical differences between groups, while total leucocytes
   were lower (P <= 0.05) for BSh hens. Heterophyl/Lymphocyte (H/L) ratio
   of BSh was lower (P <= 0.01) than IBh (0.33 vs. 0.82). IBh alpha-1 acid
   glycoprotein (AGP) mean concentrations were affected by time: the values
   registered after 15 d (T1) and 2 months (T2) of observation were similar
   (345 +/- 132 and 279 +/- 58 mu g/ml respectively), while AGP value
   registered after 4 months (T3) were significantly higher (700 +/- 487 mu
   g/ml); BSh did not display any AGP statistical variation over time. IBh
   albumin mean concentration(1.62 g/dL) was statistically lower than BSh
   values (1.89 g/dL); in both groups no effect of time of sampling was
   recorded. Acute phase protein (APP) values of BSh suggested a more
   adaptive attitude to free range conditions and appeared more constant
   over time. The present findings suggest genetic or adaptive differences
   affecting egg quality, physiological and immunological parameters.},

Abstract = {To investigate the phylogeographical patterns of red deer (Cervus
   elaphus) in Europe, and to disentangle the influence of ancient (e.g.
   Pleistocene ice ages) from more recent processes (e.g. human
   translocations).
   Europe.
   In this study we provide by far the most extensive analysis of genetic
   structure in European red deer, based on analyses of variation at two
   mitochondrial markers (cyt b and D-loop) in a large number of
   individuals from 39 locations. Relationships of mitochondrial DNA
   haplotypes were determined using minimum spanning networks and
   phylogenetic analyses. Population structure was examined by analyses of
   molecular variance. Historical processes shaping the present patterns
   were inferred from nested clade analysis and nucleotide diversity
   statistics.
   Within Europe, we detected three deeply divergent mitochondrial DNA
   lineages. The three lineages displayed a phylogeographical pattern
   dividing individuals into western European, eastern European and
   Mediterranean (Sardinia, Spain and Africa) groups, suggesting
   contraction into three separate refugia during the last glaciation. Few
   haplotypes were shared among these three groups, a finding also
   confirmed by F-ST values. Calculations of divergence times suggest that
   the groups probably split during the Pleistocene.
   The observed pattern is interpreted to result from isolation in
   different refugia during the last glaciation. The western and eastern
   European lineages could be linked to an Iberian and Balkan refugium,
   respectively. The third lineage might originate from a Sardinian or
   African refugium. We link local phylogeographical patterns observed in
   Europe to the post-glacial recolonization process, shaped by the
   geographical localization of refugia and barriers to gene flow.
   Regardless of the importance of red deer as a game species and the
   tradition of translocating red deer in Europe, we detected few
   individuals that did not match the trichotomous pattern, suggesting that
   translocations have occurred mainly at smaller spatial scales.},

   ewes, with an intermediate level for HA ewes. HM ewes showed to prefer
   M. leaves to hay, but their need to balance the high protein and low NDF
   contents of M. leaves by eating hay also emerged. Milk yield increased
   as the dietary content of M. leaves increased- In addition, the use of
   HM and MU diets led to higher milk fat and urea content in comparison
   with the HA diet. The results confirmed that M. leaves are a suitable
   fresh feeding source for sheep, and suggested to use them in association

Abstract = {Changes in the microbial flora of ``Caprino dei Nebrodi{''}, a raw
   goat's milk cheese produced in Sicily, were studied during ripening.
   From 2 batches of cheese, 4 samples were taken at day 0, 2, 15, and 30
   of ripening. Also, samples of curd and milk used in the manufacturing
   process were analyzed. By the end of the ripening process (day 30), high
   log(10) cfu/g were found for Lactobacilli (7.20), Lattococci (7.10), and
   Enterococci (7.00), whereas counts of Enterobacteriaceae (3.91),
   Escherichia coli (3.30), and Staphylococcus (3.89) were found to be
   lower. The study provides useful information on the microbiological
   properties of ``Caprino dei Nebrodi{''} cheese, and the results obtained
   suggest that in order to increase the quality of this artisanal product,
   it is necessary to improve the sanitary conditions of milking and
   cheese-making. The study was intended as a preliminary step towards the
   isolation and identification of bacterial species found in this type of
   goat's cheese.},

Abstract = {As a consequence of the finding of veterinarian drugs in food European
   Community banned several compounds like coccidiostats as amprolium
   (APL). This antibiotic has been used as a preventive and clinical
   anticoccidial drug in chicken. The 2005/187/CE, 20051925/EC
   Recommendations ban the use of amprolium as additive in chicken feed.
   For this reason a rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography-mass
   spectrometry (LC-MS) method was developed to detect amprolium in chicken
   feed following the European community proposed technique (1999/27/EC)
   for sample preparation. Cause the validation is required for the
   analytical methods used in feed official control, this method was
   validated according to 2004/882/EC Regulation. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Campylobacteriosis is the most frequently reported zoonotic disease in
   humans within the European Union. The consumption of contaminated
   chicken meat is considered one of the main sources of human infection.
   Although there are no official data on the incidence of Campylobacter
   infection in Italy, the available studies suggest that this infection is
   a major problem also in Italy. The authors developed a simulation model
   to quantitatively estimate the expected annual number of human cases of
   campylobacteriosis in the Italian regions of Abruzzo and Molise, due to
   the cross-contamination during the handling of Campylobacter jejuni
   contaminated chicken meat in domestic kitchen. The authors considered
   two different models for the dose-response relationship, given their
   crucial effects on the model's outputs. The expected percentage of human
   population. experiencing Campylobacter gastroenteritis episodes every
   year in Abruzzo e Molise regions, varied between 0.8\% and 1.8\%,
   according to the dose-response model. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Influenza A viruses that infect poultry can be divided into two groups.
   Very virulent viruses cause highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI),
   with flock mortality as high as 100\%. These viruses have been
   restricted to subtypes H5 and H7, although not all H5 and H7 viruses
   cause HPAI. All other viruses cause a milder, primarily respiratory,
   disease (LPAI), unless exacerbated. Until recently, HPAI viruses were
   rarely isolated from wild birds, but for LPAI viruses extremely high
   isolation rates have been recorded in surveillance studies. Influenza
   viruses may infect all types of domestic or captive birds in all areas
   of the world. The frequency with which primary infections occur in any
   type of bird usually depends on the degree of contact there is with
   feral birds. Secondary spread is typically associated with human
   involvement, either by birds or bird product movement or by transferring
   infective faeces from infected to susceptible birds, but potentially
   wild birds can be involved. In recent years the frequency of HPAI
   outbreaks appears to have increased and there have been particularly
   costly outbreaks of HPAI in densely populated poultry areas in Italy,
   The Netherlands and Canada. In each outbreak millions of birds were
   slaughtered to bring the outbreaks under control. Since the 1990s, AI
   infections due to two subtypes have been widespread in poultry across a
   large area of the World. LPAI H9N2 appears to have spread across the
   whole of Asia in that time and has become endemic in poultry in many of
   the affected countries. However, these outbreaks have been overshadowed
   by the H5N1 HPAI virus, initially isolated in China that has now spread
   in poultry and/or wild birds throughout Asia and into Europe and Africa,
   resulting in the death or culling of hundreds of millions of poultry and
   posing a significant zoonosis threat. To date control methods seem to
   have been unsuccessful on the larger scale and HPAI H5N1 outbreaks
   continue to be reported.},

Abstract = {From 2006 to date, serious epidemic waves of a Blue tongue virus
   serotype 8 (BTV-8) have occurred in Central-Northern
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   Europe. In 2007, more than 12,000 outbreaks were recorded in Belgium,
   the Netherlands, France, Luxembourg and Germany. Every year, Italy,
   particularly the Veneto Region, imports several hundred thousands cattle
   for the restocking of feed-lots from these countries. In particular, in
   2007 the Veneto Region imported about 420,000 cattle from France. From
   26 October 2007 to 26 February 2008, 33 of these animals, introduced to
   15 different meat-cattle holdings in the Region, were found to be
   seropositive to BTV-8 (26 of these bovines were also PCR positive).
   This new epidemiological situation has focussed the attention on
   strengthening the BT surveillance system in this Region. in order to
   early detect any introduction of BTV-8 and put proper sanitary measures
   into place to limit the possible spread of infection. In order to
   identify the areas exposed to a higher risk of BT introduction, an
   Explorative Spatial Data Analysis was carried out using an MCM (Multiple
   Criteria Method) system taking into consideration BT risk factors such
   as importation of cattle from areas at risk where active BTV circulation
   was detected, and areas with a high density of dairy and beef cattle.
   The analysis also included the presence of vectors.
   Three areas identified at higher risk of BT introduction were subjected
   to additional targeted surveillance. On 13(th) march, during these
   additional controls, the first. Italian outbreak of BTV-8 has been
   detected in Isola della Scala municipality (Verona Province). Monitoring
   activity on tank milk had permitted to reveal the presence of nine
   positive samples of which only four were confirmed by the National
   Reference Centre. These findings have led the Authorities to establish a
   restriction zone which has been updated based on the epidemiological
   situation and to implement a vaccination campaign in susceptible animals
   of Verona and Mantoya Provinces.},

Abstract = {Aflatoxins are extremely toxic metabolites from Asperollus species that
   can adulterate a wide range of human foodstuff. Herein, we propose a
   novel assay designed as an analytical test for aflatoxin B, and G,
   (AFB(1) and AFG(1), respectively) that could represent an alternative
   screening technique for this class of mycotoxins. The approach for the
   determination of these toxins is based on surface plasmon resonance
   using neutrophil porcine elastase as a ``bait{''} for these aflatoxins.
   The selection and optimization of the analytical procedure involved a
   preliminary investigation on the type of inhibition by AFB(1): the level
   of the protease inhibition exerted by AFB(1) depended upon the
   incubation time and the concentration of the binding partners, showing
   the competitiveness and the reversibility of the inhibition. A
   posteriori, the nature of the interaction granted a rapid analysis, a
   single detection test requiring only a few minutes. For the development
   of the assay, the experimental conditions were evaluated and optimized
   with both calibration solution and aflatoxin-spiked samples. To apply
   this method to aflatoxin-contaminated maize, a rapid solid-phase
   extraction treatment was developed. The proposed assay for AFB(1) and
   AFG, was validated by comparison with both a chromatographic reference
   method and a standard enzyme linked immunosorbent assay procedure. This
   enzyme-based biosensor represents a new approach for the detection of
   aflatoxins based on the reversible interaction between a blocked
   macromolecule and a soluble ligand, having the major advantages in the
   relative rapidity, the reusability of the capturing surface, and low
   cost per single test.},

Abstract = {Chlamydophila pecorum is an obligate intracellular bacterium associated
   with different pathological conditions in ruminants, swine and koala,
   which is also found in the intestine of asymptomatic animals. A
   multi-virulence locus sequence typing (MVLST) system was developed using
   19 C pecorum strains (8 pathogenic and 11 non-pathogenic intestinal
   strains) isolated from ruminants of different geographical origins. To
   evaluate the ability of MVLST to distinguish the pathogenic from the
   non-pathogenic strains of C pecorum, the sequences of 12 genes were
   analysed: 6 potential virulence genes (ompA, incA, incB, incC, mip and
   copN), 5 housekeeping genes (recA, hemD, aroC, efp, gap), and the ORF663
   gene encoding a hypothetical protein (HP) that includes a variant
   15-nucleotides coding tandem repeat (CTR). MVLST provided high
   discriminatory power(100\%) in allowing to distinguish 6 of 8 pathogenic
   strains in a single group, and overall more discriminatory than MLST
   targeting housekeeping genes. ompA was the most polymorphic gene and the
   phylogenetic tree based only on its sequence differentiated 4 groups
   with high bootstrap values. The number of CTRs (rich in serine, proline
   and lysine) in ORF663 detected in the pathogenic strains was generally
   lower than that found in the intestinal strains. MVLST appears to be a
   promising method for the differential identification of virulent C
   pecorum strains, and the ompA, incA and ORF663 genes appear to be good
   molecular markers for further epidemiological investigation of C.

Abstract = {A randomised clinical study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of
   Tulathromycin in time prevention of bovine respiratory disease (BRD), in
   typical Italian breeding conditions. For the enrolment in the study 214
   male cattle. weighing 357 to 546 kg, were imported from France. At
   arrival, all the animals were vaccinated, dewormed and managed as per
   normal farm practices. In the first days following the arrival of the
   animals to the farm, the BRD outbreak was confirmed by clinical and
   microbiological assessments (presence of P multocida, El. somni e M.
   bovis) on 18 animals with respiratory signs, then, all the animals were
   treated with Tulathromycin (G1 = 96) or Tilmicosin (G2 = 97) in
   commercial formulations and following the label instructions. In the two
   weeks following the treatment, Tulathromycin showed an high efficacy in
   BRD prevention (97,8\%). significantly higher than Tilmicosin (89.1\%, p
   = 0,0326). The comparison of daily weight gain of the two groups showed
   an overall improvement of production performance of the animals treated
   with Tulathromycin (average body weight = 537 kg, IPG = 1,69 kg/day)
   when compared to those treated with Tilmicosin (average body weight =
   530 kg, IPG = 1,57 kg/day). The lack of statistical significance of this
   data suggest further investigations by increasing the sample size.},

Abstract = {Anaplasma species are tick-transmitted pathogens that impact veterinary
   and human health. Sicily is one of the locations where these pathogens
   are endemic. Sicily represents a typical Mediterranean ecosystem to
   study Anaplasma infection and tick habitat suitability. The aims of this
   study were (i) to characterize by 16S rRNA and species-specific msp4
   gene PCR the prevalence and genotypes of A. marginale, A.
   phagocytophilum, and A. ovis in the most abundant host species in
   Sicilian provinces and (ii) to correlate differences between hosts and
   between western and eastern Sicily with the habitat suitability for
   ticks in these regions. Differences were found in the prevalence of
   Anaplasma spp. between different hosts and between western and eastern
   provinces. The differences in Anaplasma prevalence between different
   hosts may be explained by pathogen host tropism. The differences between
   western and eastern provinces correlated with the tick habitat
   suitability in these regions. The analysis of Anaplasma genotypes
   suggested a higher host and regional specificity for A. phagocytophilum
   than for A. marginale and A. ovis strains, a finding probably associated
   with the broader host range of A. phagocytophilum. The presence of
   identical A. marginale genotypes in the two regions may reflect cattle
   movement. The results for A. ovis suggested the possibility of some
   genotypes being host specific. These results provide information
   potentially useful for the management of tick-borne diseases caused by
   Anaplasma spp. in Sicily and other Mediterranean regions and may
   contribute to the development of models to predict the risks for these
   tick-borne pathogens.},

Abstract = {Transport can be a stressful experience for animals, and that means
   ethical and economic consequences. OIE guidelines and the EU new
   regulation aim at preventing inadequate conditions of transport. making
   operators fully responsible of animal welfare and requiring specific
   certificates of competence. In comparison with other farmed species,
   relatively few papers have been published on sheep transport. This could
   be due to lower economic significance and to apparently minor impact of
   poor transport on sheep meat quality. However, in the last decades
   several researches were produced on this subject, pointing a number of
   welfare parameters of be clinic. physiopathologic. environmental and
   inspective nature. In this review different potential stressor agents
   have been evaluated: animal handling (particularly loading and
   unloading), stocking density, travel duration, rest times, environmental
   conditions and personnel skills. Further studies could be useful to
   improve knowledge about basic welfare parameters regarding this species,
   such as rnicroclimate conditions on transport means (mostly about
   different standards for shorn or unshorn sheep) and actual effects on
   meat quality.},

Abstract = {Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes acute hepatitis in humans, and infects
   several animal species, mostly asymptomatically. Swine and human HEV
   strains are genetically related suggesting both a zoonotic and a
   possible foodborne transmission. The prevalence of swine HEV was
   investigated in 274 randomly selected pigs from six different swine
   farms of Northern Italy, testing viral RNA in stools by nested
   reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction. HEV genome was detected
   in 115 stools (42\%). All farms resulted positive for HEV, with a
   prevalence ranging between 12.8\% and 72.5\%. HEV-positive pigs were
   detected in all age groups and production stages tested, although
   infection was more prevalent in weaners than in the older fatteners
   (42.2\% vs. 27.0\%). Genetic characterization of swine strains
   identified was performed by sequencing and database alignment.
   Phylogenetic analysis on the nucleotide sequences from 16 positive PCR
   products indicated that all strains belonged to genotype 3. In
   particular, one group of seven Italian strains clustered close
   (91.6-96.2\% identity) to human and swine European HEV strains. (C) 2008

Abstract = {Preparing an effective Food Safety Strategy is considered to be a
   precondition for the improvement of food safety systems, especially in
   countries that are integrating within the EU single market that requires
   the same approach to food safety and the same level of consumer
   protection. Croatia has been challenged in recent years in enforcing its
   institutional and legislative food safety framework, especially through
   EU pre-accession activities and various international projects. This
   paper discusses the procedures that Croatian authorities have been
   carrying out to prepare the national Food Safety Strategy based on the
   modern FAO/WHO food safety approach that incorporates a risk analysis
   framework. The Croatian model for the preparation of the Strategy
   presented in this paper could serve as a help to other developing
   countries on their way to carrying out this complex and
   multi-institutional task. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) is a fatal, systemic disease of cattle
   and other domestic and wild ruminants that, in Europe, is caused by
   Ovine herpesvirus 2 (OvHV-2). American bison (Bison bison) are highly
   susceptible to the disease. An adult American bison, housed in a zoo in
   Southern Italy in close cohabitation with a group of domestic sheep
   (Ovis aries aries) displayed clinical signs that resembled the acute
   form of MCF. By real-time polymerase chain reaction, OvHV-2 DNA was
   detected intravitam in blood, in nasal and ocular swabs, and postmortem
   in tissue samples of the bison. By indirect fluorescent antibody test,
   high MCF antibody titers were found in the bison serum. Ovine
   herpesvirus 2 DNA and antibodies were also found in blood samples from
   the domestic sheep, thus suggesting a potential role of these animals as
   a source of the infection. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first
   MCF case in captive ruminants in Italy and the second confirmed case in
   captive bison of European zoos.},

Abstract = {In an attempt to standardise the determination of biological reference
   values, the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) has
   published a series of recommendations on developing reference intervals.
   The IFCC recommends the use of an a priori sampling of at least 120
   healthy individuals. However, such a high number of samples and
   laboratory analysis is expensive, time-consuming and not always
   feasible, especially in veterinary medicine. In this paper, an
   alternative (a posteriori) method is described and is used to determine
   reference intervals for biochemical parameters of farm animals using an
   existing laboratory data set. The method used was based on the detection
   and removal of outliers to obtain a large sample of animals likely to be
   healthy from the existing data set. This allowed the estimation of
   reliable reference intervals for biochemical parameters in Sarda dairy
   sheep. This method may also be useful for the determination of reference
   intervals for different species, ages and gender. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {One of the most important steps when preparing a live attenuated vaccine
   is the assessment of the level of attenuation in target animals. It is
   costly and time consuming as it requires, on each occasion, a large
   number of susceptible animals and contained accommodation. This study
   assessed the consistency of the bovine foetal aorta endothelial (BFA)
   cell line and newborn mice for evaluating the attenuation level of BTV4,
   BTV`9 and BTV16 Italian field isolates. Following serial passages in
   BHK21c13 or Vero cell cultures, BTV attenuated clones demonstrated a
   reduced replication capability in the BFA cells compared to the
   homologous virulent strains. Similarly, following intracerebral
   inoculation, the attenuated clones were completely innocuous to newborn
   mice contrary to the homologous virulent strains which killed all
   animals within 10 days. Vaccines produced with the BTV9 or BTV4
   attenuated clones were safe, immunogenic and capable of preventing
   clinical symptoms and viraemia in sheep following challenge with
   homologous virulent virus. The two assays may be valuable indicators of
   the gradual changes occurring in the BTV population leading to virus
   attenuation, they can predict the safety of a BTV attenuated vaccine
   and, in turn, reduce the number of sheep and cattle required to assess
   the level of attenuation attained. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is an economically important pathogen
   of cattle. Two approved species are recognized, namely BVDV-1 and
   BVDV-2. To date, only 4 subgenotypes of BVDV-2 are known, and at least I
   I distinct subgenotypes have been detected for BVDV-1. In a previous
   study, the genetic characteristics of 38 field isolates of BVDV from
   northern Italy were investigated, and all 38 isolates were classified as
   BVDV-1 and could be assigned to 5 different subgenotypes, namely
   BVDV-1b, BVDV-1d, BVDV-1e, BVDV-1h, and BVDV-1f. However, the
   circulation of BVDV-2 has been reported in Italy as well. The aim of the
   current study was to type 88 BVD viruses found throughout Italy. Genetic
   study was based oil the 5'-UTR, supported by select comparison within
   the N-pro coding region. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 5 isolates
   could be typed as BVDV-2a. The remaining 83 isolates were typed as
   BVDV-1 and were found to belong to 7 distinct subgenotypes, namely
   BVDV-1a (n = 8), BVDV-1b (n = 37), BVDV-1d (n = 3), BVDV-1e (n = 22),
   BVDV-If (n = 4), BVDV-1g (n = 4), and BVDV-1h (n = 5). The majority of
   cattle farms in the current study were predominately infected by BVDV-1b
   and BVDV-1e isolates, whereas the other BVDV subgenotypes occurred only
   sporadically. The results also provided evidence for circulation of
   additional subgenotypes BVDV-la and BVDV-1g. The occurrence of BVDV-2
   was also reconfirmed.},

Abstract = {In this study, we searched for a connection between Leishmania load and
   cytokine expression levels in the tissues of Leishmania infantum
   naturally infected dogs and the efficacy of treatment with miltefosine
   and allopurinol. To this purpose, we exploited a real-time PCR system to
   detect Leishmania load and the expression levels of IFN-gamma and IL-4
   mRNAs at the time of diagnosis and during the follow up post-treatment.
   In particular, we measured the amount of parasites in blood and lymph
   node samples, while the expression levels of IFN-gamma and IL-4
   cytokines were assessed in the blood of the animals. We employed
   different targeted real-time PCR assays on 20 naturally infected dogs
   with clinical signs. Three healthy dogs living in a non-endemic area
   were selected as negative controls. The overall results obtained
   demonstrate that the simultaneous evaluation of parasites and cytokine
   levels in different kinds of tissue might represent a reliable tool to
   evaluate the immune response, the efficacy of the therapy and to predict
   the relapses during the treatment. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Since early 2007, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has experienced
   several highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreaks in the
   falconry and poultry sectors. The public health threat associated with
   peculiar husbandry systems, requiring close contact between humans and
   birds of prey, highlights the need of an improved understanding of the
   epidemiology and of the viral characteristics of H5N1 viruses
   circulating in the region. Here we report molecular and phylogenetic
   analyses of H5N1 viruses isolated in the KSA in 2007 in distinct
   compartments of avian husbandry. From the results of our investigation
   it appears that two separate introductions into the different sectors
   occurred. The identification of specific amino acid mutations, which are
   described as genetic signatures of human influenza A viruses or known to
   confer resistance to antiviral drugs, raises concerns for the possible
   human health implications of the KSA H5N1 viruses.},

Abstract = {The present study evaluated the molecular detection and identification
   of Rickettsia species in 83 ticks collected in Sardinia, Italy. Fifteen
   ticks were PCR-positive using gltA-specific and ompA-specific primers,
   leading to the identification of Rickettsia aeschlimannii in Hyalomma
   marginatum marginatum, R. massiliae in Rhipicephalus turanicus and in
   Rhipicephalus sanguineus, and a new rickettsia, previously referred to
   as PoTiRb169 in Portugal, in four Rhipicephalus turanicus. This new
   species was further characterized by amplification and sequencing of
   three additional genes (ompB, sca4 and rrs). Using the current criteria
   to name a rickettsia, this uncultivated rickettsia can be given a
   Candidatus status, and we propose to call it `Candidatus Rickettsia
   barbariae'. The detection of three tick-borne rickettsiae in Sardinia
   raises the possibility that many cases of spotted fever considered by
   clinicians and health authorities as Mediterranean spotted fever due to
   R. conorii could, in fact, be due to other rickettsiae, including those
   found in this study. Analysing skin biopsies of inoculation eschars in
   patients with spotted fever would be, together with continuing
   entomological surveys, the best way to increase our knowledge of
   tick-borne rickettsioses in Sardinia and more generally in the
   Mediterranean basin.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to establish the influence of shearing in
   dairy sheep during summer season. Several physiological and
   haematological parameters, which are closely related to thermoregulatory
   potential, have been investigated with the purpose to assess shearing
   influence on thermoregulation. Forty dairy sheep, clinically healthy and
   well-fed, were used. They were divided into two groups of 20 subjects
   each. Twenty sheep were let unshorn as a control group (Group A), and
   twenty sheep were shorn (Group B). On each subject of group A and Group
   B, rectal temperature, respiration and heart rates were recorded and
   blood samples were collected in order to asses the following parameters:
   red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, haematocrit and
   haemoglobin. All measurements taken on day 0 (before shearing), were
   repeated after 1, 15, 30, 45 and 60 days after shearing. The statistical
   analysis, the ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni's test, showed
   statistical differences between two groups for rectal temperature
   (F((1,90)) = 5.57, p < 0.0001), respiratory rate (F((1,90)) = 18.40, p <
   0.0001) and white blood cells (F((1,90)) = 7.61, p < 0.0001). These
   results suggest that the shearing induce adaptative responses in the
   organism.},

Abstract = {Filter-feeding bivalve molluscs are often contaminated by algal toxins.
   We have probed whether proteomic analysis of extracts from the digestive
   gland (DG) of mussels could be employed to identify biomarkers of
   contamination due to okadaic acid-group toxins. The protein extracts
   were obtained from 18 separate mussel samples and were analyzed by
   two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. When samples were divided into four
   different classes based on the content of OA-group toxins in the
   starting material, we found that two proteins varied as a function of OA
   contamination. By BLAST analysis, the two proteins were identified as a
   component of photosystem II and a subunit of NADH dehydrogenase. The
   analysis of peptide homologies showed that the peptide of photosystem II
   we detected in extracts from the DG of mussels contaminated by OA-group
   toxins is identical to its counterpart in Dinophysis algae, which are
   the producers of this group of toxins. We concluded that proteomic
   analysis can be used for the detection and identification of biomarkers
   of biotoxin contamination in shellfish, including both proteins
   expressed by the toxin producers and components that participate to the
   tissue response to the exogenous bioactive contaminant. (c) 2008

Abstract = {Aims: To investigate the presence of enteric viruses {[}hepatitis A
   (HAV) and norovirus (NoV)] in shellfish harvested from the deltaic area
   of the Po river in relation to environmental factors.
   Methods and Results: Fortnightly sampling of shellfish was carried out
   in two lagoon areas (category B production areas) and one sea area
   (category A). Environmental parameters in the lagoon and hydrometric
   level of the tributary river were monitored throughout the sampling
   period. Samples (n = 120) were analysed for bacterial (E. coli and
   Salmonella) and viral (HAV and NoV) contamination; samples from category
   B areas were analysed before and after purification treatment. All the
   samples were negative for HAV whereas 10 samples (8.3\%), all harvested
   in the lagoon areas, were positive for NoV. Sequencing identified the
   strains as genotypes II.4 and II.b. None of the samples was found to be
   contaminated after depuration.
   Conclusions: The monitoring showed a low frequency of NoV presence;
   viral contamination, detected exclusively in shellfish collected from
   the deltaic area (category B), could be influenced by the flow of the
   tributary river.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: The data collected are useful for
   the design of targeted prevention strategies and for the modulation of
   control plans after meteorological events.},

Abstract = {In this study, the efficacy of two experimental vaccines against
   Bacillus anthracis toxinaemia was evaluated in the rabbit model. A
   recombinant Protective Antigen (rPA) mutant and a trivalent vaccine (TV)
   composed by the rPA, a inactive mutant of Lethal Factor (mLF-Y728A;
   E735A) and a inactive mutant of Edema Factor (mEF-K346R), both
   emulsified with mineral oils, were evaluated for their immunogenicity
   and protective activity in New Zealand white rabbits. Rabbits vaccinated
   subcutaneously with rPA and TV rapidly produced high level of anti-PA,
   anti-LF and anti-EF antibodies, which were still present 6 months later.
   In the efficacy test, these vaccines protected 100\% of rabbits
   challenged with B. anthracis virulent strain 0843 one week after the
   vaccination. Moreover, all animals vaccinated twice with rPA and TV,
   resisted B. anthracis infection 6 months later. Our data indicate that
   rPA and TV could be good vaccine candidates for inducing protection
   against B. anthracis infection in target animal host. They could
   successfully be used in an emergency with simultaneous long-acting
   antibiotics to halt incubating infections or during an anthrax epidemic.

Abstract = {In this paper, we have reported an immunoassay with time-resolved
   revelation system for ampicillin in raw milk samples. Immunological
   methods appear to be a promising approach in the analysis of P-lactam
   compounds, because they do not need previous sample pre-treatments. In
   fact, P-lactam ring is not very stable in extensive sample pre-treatment
   procedures requested in conventional analytical techniques. Specimens
   were collected from lactating cows bred in various conditions and
   assayed for the fat contents. Ampicillin was assayed in samples with
   different fat concentrations. The assay was performed using
   ampicillin-specific polyclonal antibody raised in rabbit; the immunogen
   was synthesized using bovine thyroglobulin conjugated to ampicillin by
   glutaraldehyde reaction; as fluorescent marker we used goat anti-rabbit
   IgG conjugated with a chelating molecule complexed with Eu3+. Bovine
   serum albumin (BSA) conjugated with ampicillin was synthesized and used
   to prepare a solid phase on polystyrene microtiter plates. The use of a
   lanthanide chelate as label allowed to achieve 1 ng mL(-1) sensitivity,
   which is four times more sensitive than limits requested from European
   Community. Fat contents did not affect the assay performance. (C) 2008

Title = {Development of PCR protocols for specific identification of Clostridium

Abstract = {Rabbit diarrhoea caused by toxigenic Clostridium spiroforme is
   responsible for significant losses in commercial rabbitries but the
   accurate identification of this micro-organism is difficult due to the
   absence of both a commercial biochemical panel and biomolecular methods.
   The aim of this study was therefore to develop PCR protocols for
   specific detection of C. spiroforme and its binary toxin encoding genes.
   The C. spiroforme specie-specific primers were designed based on its 16S
   rDNA published sequences and the specificity of these primers was tested
   with DNA extracted from closely related Clostridium species. The
   sa/bs\_F and sa/bs\_R C. spiroforme binary toxin specific primers were
   designed to be complementary, respectively, to a sequence of 21 bases on
   the 3' and of sas gene and on the 5' of the sbs gene. The detection
   limits of in house developed PCR protocols were 25 CFU/ml of bacterial
   suspension and 1.38 x 10(4) CFU/g of caecal content for specie-specific
   primers and 80 CFU/ml of bacterial suspension and 2.8 x 10(4) CFU/g of
   caecal content in case of sa/bs primers. These results indicated that
   the described PCR assays enable specific identification of C. spiroforme
   and its binary toxin genes and can therefore be considered a rapid,
   reliable tool for the diagnosis of C. spiroforme-related enterotoxaemia.

Abstract = {A novel method was developed and implemented during the recent outbreak
   of bluetongue (BT) in sheep and cattle in The Netherlands to obtain
   rapidly a `snapshot' of Culicoides vector densities at the national
   level. The country was divided into 110rastercells, each measuring 20
   kin x 20 km; within 106 of these cells, a farm was selected with a
   minimum Of 10 cattle and sampled for Culicoides for one night only using
   the Onderstepoort-type blacklight trap. Prior to deployment of the light
   traps in the field, local veterinarians were trained in their use and in
   the preservation of captured Culicoides. The collections were despatched
   daily by courier to afield laboratory where the Culicoides were counted
   and identified. The `snapshot' commenced on 12 September 2006 and was
   completed on 28 September coinciding with the 5-7 weeks of BT virus
   (BTV) activity in The Netherlands and when the number of weekly cases of
   disease was on the rise. Analysis of the 106 collections was completed
   on 5 October. The number of grid cells in which a taxon occurred is
   represented by the index 20(2) gFR (=20 km x 20 km grid Frequency Rate)
   this index essentially reflects the percentage of examined raster cells
   found to contain the potential vector in question. The `snapshot'
   results can be summarised as follows:
   A total of >35,000 Culicoides were captured (mu = 333 midges/light trap)
   representing 16 species;
   Not a single specimen of C. imicola. the principal Afro-Asiatic vector
   of BTV in southern Europe. was captured;
   The three European species of Culicoides implicated previously as
   potential vectors in the Mediterranean region and the Balkans also occur
   in The Netherlands;
   The Obsoletus Complex (represented by both potential vectors Culicoides
   obsoletus and Culicoides scolicus) was the most prevalent taxon (20(2)
   gFR: 93.4\%) followed by the Pulicaris Complex (76.4\%);
   The Pulicaris Complex comprised at least six species. One of these.
   Culicoides pulicaris sensu stricto (ss), a potential vector in southern
   Europe, had a low 20(2) gFR of 17.9\% indicating it played no role in
   the transmission of BTV;
   The next most prevalent taxa were Culicoides dewulfi (70.8\%) and
   Culicoides chiopterus (67.0\%) both of which breed in cattle dung. This
   close association with livestock raises their potential as vectors of
   BTV;
   Culicoides achrayi, Culicoides circumscriptus, C. dewulfi, Culicoides
   halophilus, Culicoides lupicaris and Culicoides stigma are new species
   records for The Netherlands and demonstrates that the extant knowledge
   on the Culicoides fauna of northern Europe is incomplete;
   Cooling trends in the weather induced a >50-fold decrease in overall
   Culicoides numbers but with Subsequent warming these Would rebound
   rapidly indicating that more intense cold is required before heightened
   mortalities are induced amongst adult biting midges.
   The northward advance of BT in Europe compels the competent authorities
   in affected and in neighbouring territories to acquire rapidly baseline
   information around which to plan Sound vector surveillance and livestock
   movement strategies. The Culicoides `snapshot' is a tool well suited to
   this purpose. It is stressed that a vector surveillance program must be
   built upon a firm taxonomic base because misidentifications will flaw
   the mapped seasonal and geographic distribution patterns upon which
   veterinary authorities depend. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Endophily in Culicoides associated with BTV-infected cattle in the
   province of Limburg, South-Eastern Netherlands, 2006},

Abstract = {Culicoides were captured at a BTV-infected dairy near Gulpen in the
   province of Limburg (south-cast Netherlands) between 14 September and 4
   October 2006. Onderstepoort-type blacklight traps were used to sample
   Culicoides both inside and outside a partially open shed housing 11
   cattle. A total of 28 light trap collections were made at the shed and
   yielded:
   9371 Culicoides representing 11 species; >90\% comprised five potential
   vectors of BTV and in order of abundance were Culicoides obsoletus and
   Culicoides scoticus (of the Obsoletus Complex), Culicoides dewulfi,
   Culicoides pulicaris and Culicoides chiopterus, Culicoides imicola, the
   principal Mediterranean (and African) vector of BTV was absent.
   2339 Culicoides representing seven species were captured inside
   (endophily) the cattle shed: >95\% comprised the Obsoletus Complex and
   C. dewulfi. Conversely, the Pulicaris Complex, represented by five
   species and including C. pulicaris, showed strong exophily with >97\%
   captured outside the shed.
   7032 Culicoides were captured outside the shed, approximately threefold
   more than inside. This trend was reversed on an overcast day, when
   eightfold more Culicoides were captured inside: this indicates that when
   the light intensity outdoors is low Culicoides will attack (i) earlier
   in the day while cattle are still at pasture, and (ii) might follow
   cattle into the sheds in the late afternoon leading to elevated numbers
   of biting midges being trapped inside the shed during the subsequent
   hours of darkness.
   Culicoides were captured inside the shed on all 14 sampling nights. On
   occasion up to 33\% were freshly blood fed indicating they had avidly
   attacked the cattle inside (endophagy); because half the cattle had
   seroconverted to BTV, and because no cattle were left outdoors at night,
   the data indicate that (i) the housing of animals in partially open
   buildings does not interrupt the transmission of BTV, and/or (ii) BTV is
   being transmitted while cattle are grazing outdoors during the day.
   The capture of partially engorged midges inside the shed shows they are
   being disturbed while feeding; this may lead to cattle being attacked
   repeatedly, and if these attacks include older parous BTV-infected
   Culicoides, may enhance virus dissemination (particularly in sheds where
   cattle stand close together).
   Endo- and exophagy by potential vector Culicoides - coupled to increased
   adult longevity and multiple feeding events in single (potentially)
   infected midges - would ensure an R-0 of >1, resulting in the continued
   maintenance and spread of BTV within local vertebrate populations.
   Four light trap collections made additionally in a mature deciduous
   forest 70 m from the shed yielded a high proportion (48\%) of gravid
   females amongst which 10\% had incompletely digested blackened blood
   meals in their abdomens; the absence of this age category in Culicoides
   captured at the sheds indicates that all Culicoides, after engorgement,
   exit the buildings to undergo oogenesis elsewhere.
   In Europe, the blacklight trap is used widely for the nocturnal
   monitoring of Culicoides; a drawback to this approach is that this trap
   cannot be used to sample midges that are active during the day. Because
   diurnal biting in vector Culicoides may constitute a significant and
   underestimated component of BTV transmission a novel capture methodology
   will be required in future and is discussed briefly. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Title = {THE TUNISIAN TRADITIONAL RABBIT BREEDING SYSTEM VERSUS THE COMMERCIAL
   SYSTEM: AN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE},
Journal = {WORLD RABBIT SCIENCE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {Rabbit breeding is practiced in many hot climate countries and
   contributes in terms of agricultural activities to rural development. In
   Tunisia two different rabbit breeding systems can be identified - the
   ``traditional{''} (an integrated free range and underground system) and
   the ``commercial{''} (employing sheds and wire net cages) practice. 24
   Tunisian rabbitries (10 traditional and 14 commercial) were included in
   an epidemiological study aimed at comparing the prevalence of pathogenic
   bacteria responsible for upper respiratory and digestive diseases in the
   two breeding systems. A total of 128 adult rabbits (mean age of 9.4
   months) were tested using deep nasal and rectal swabs. Symptoms of nasal
   discharge and/or diarrhea were recorded. 281 bacterial strains were
   isolated in total, 138 in commercial and 143 in traditional farms. The
   bacteria most frequently isolated (61.2\%) were Gram-positive strains,
   which included Streptococcus sp. (22.8\%), coagulase negative
   Staphylococcus sp. (17.8\%) and coagulase-positive Staphylococcus
   (17.4\%) strains. Among the Gram-negative isolated bacteria, Escherichia
   coli was the most frequent (12.5\%), followed by Proteus sp. (5.7\%).
   The two Salmonella strains isolated were Salmonella bongori (found in
   the commercial system), and Salmonella typhimurium definitive phage-type
   (DT) 104 (found in the traditional farming system). The absence of
   Pasteurella multocida in the list of isolated bacteria may be directly
   correlated to the method of conserving the samples (storage at freezing
   temperature). The coagulase-positive Staphylococcus strains were
   frequently isolated (73.5\%) from healthy rabbits, but seldom from
   rabbits with rhinitis (18.4\%) or diarrhea (8.2\%). Staphylococcus
   aureus strains were recovered at a higher rate in commercial farms
   (21\%) in comparison with traditional (11.9\%) farms. However, this
   difference was not statistically significant. Four Staphylococcus aureus
   strains, all belonging to commercial farms, proved positive when tested
   for enterotoxin production. The antimicrobial susceptibility of isolated
   Staphylococcus aureus strains was also investigated. Most of the
   antibiotics tested were very effective: the highest level of
   susceptibility was observed with enrofloxacin (100\%). The low
   performance of Tunisian traditional rabbit rearing has been linked to
   the high mortality rate, which may possibly be due to the increased
   presence of pathogens at the rabbit flock level. However, this was not
   confirmed by the results of our study due to the fact that the bacterial
   contamination seems to be comparable in both the traditional and the
   commercial breeding systems.},

Abstract = {An ovine rotavirus (OVR) strain, 762, was isolated from a 30-day-old
   lamb affected with severe gastroenteritis, in Zaragoza, Spain, and the
   VP4, VP7, VP6, NSP4, and NSP5/NSP6 genes were subsequently characterized
   molecularly. Strain OVR762 was classified as a P{[}14] rotavirus, as the
   VP4 and VP8{*} trypsin-cleavage product of the VP4 protein revealed the
   highest amino acid (aa) identity (94\% and 97\%, respectively) with that
   of the P11{[}14] human rotavirus (HRV) strain PA169, isolated in Italy.
   Analysis of the VP7 gene product revealed that OVR762 possessed G8
   serotype specificity, a type common in ruminants, with the highest
   degree of aa identity (95-98\%) shared with serotype G8 HRV, bovine
   rotavirus, and guanaco (Lama guanicoe) rotavirus strains. Moreover,
   strain OVR762 displayed a bovine-like NSP4 (genotype E2) and NSP5/NSP6
   (genotype H3), and a VP6 genotype I2, as well as a long electropherotype
   pattern. This is the first report of a lamb rotavirus with P{[}14] and
   G8 specificities, providing additional evidence for the wide genetic and
   antigenic diversity of group A rotaviruses.},

Title = {An alternative method to isoenzyme profile for cell line identification
   and interspecies cross-contaminations: cytochrome b PCR-RLFP analysis},

Abstract = {One of the major risks in cell culture laboratories is the
   misidentification and cross-contamination of cell lines. Several methods
   have been used to authenticate cell lines, including isoenzyme
   profiling, the test suggested by European Farmacopeia, which is
   performed at the Tissue Culture Centre in Brescia. However, this method
   displays several disadvantages, such as high variability and low
   reproducibility, and it is time consuming and requires high cell
   concentrations to be performed. Therefore, an alternative method has
   been developed to confirm the specie of origin of 27 different animal
   cell cultures. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment
   length polymorphism (RFLP) assay was optimized, based on the use of a
   pair of primers that anneal to a portion of the cytochrome b gene in all
   the species. The amplification product was digested with a panel of six
   restriction enzymes, and the pattern derived was resolved on 3\%
   high-resolution agarose gel. For 23 species, this protocol produced a
   unique restriction pattern, and the origin of these animal cells
   resulted to be confirmed by this analysis. Furthermore, results indicate
   that cytochrome b PCR-RFLP was able to amplify target sequences using
   very low amounts of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Its sensitivity in
   detecting interspecies, cross-contamination was comparable to that of
   isoenzyme analysis (contaminating DNA should represent at least 10\% of
   the total DNA). For 4 of the 27 species (sheep, dog, Guinea pig, and
   Rhesus monkey) the observed pattern, even if highly reproducible, showed
   additional bands; for these species, specific PCR was also performed.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to investigate the contamination
   sources and the transmission of Salmonella within a pig finishing herd
   in Italy. Nine sets of samples were collected during the fattening
   period from cleaned and disinfected pens, animals at different ages (4
   days after arrival, 90, 150, 170 and 240 days of age) and at slaughter.
   Salmonella was isolated from cleaned pens, individual faecal samples,
   the truck used to transport the pigs to the abattoir and after slaughter
   (cecal contents, mesenteric lymph nodes and carcasses). Several serovars
   were isolated: Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella derby on farm;
   Salmonella bovismorbificans, Salmonella bredeney, Salmonella blockley,
   Salmonella hadar and Salmonella corvallis from the truck; S. derby, S.
   hadar, S. bredeney, S. bovismorbificans and Salmonella infantis at
   slaughter. Antibiotic resistance of the strains was tested and PFGE was
   carried out to investigate the on-farm epidemiology of Salmonella. The
   results showed that the environmental contamination may have represented
   a major source of infection for the pigs both on farm and during
   transport to the abattoir. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Brucellosis is a highly infectious disease affecting both animals and
   humans. The current standard tools for the diagnosis of this bacterial
   infection are serological and microbiological. In this study, we
   evaluated the feasibility of molecular assays as diagnostic tools for
   the detection of Brucella spp. in water buffalo milk. For this purpose,
   we first compared different DNA extraction protocols and PCR methods on
   artificially spiked milk samples. The most sensitive methods were then
   used to examine milk from serologically positive and negative water
   buffaloes. Molecular results were compared with serological and
   bacteriological test results. Milk samples from 53 Brucella seropositive
   buffaloes (by either rose Bengal or complement fixation test) were
   positive by ELISA, 37 were positive by culture, 33 were positive by PCR,
   and 35 were positive by real-time PCR. Of the 37 culture-positive
   samples, a total of 25 and 26 were positive by PCR and real-time PCR,
   respectively. Of the 16 culture-negative samples, 8 were positive by PCR
   and 9 by real-time PCR. Thus, although culture showed greater
   sensitivity than PCR, some animals found positive by serological methods
   and PCR tested negative by milk culture. The combined use of
   bacteriological and molecular tools increased the number of positive
   samples to 46. In conclusion, these results suggest that the
   simultaneous application of these 2 direct detection methods (culture
   and PCR) could be more useful than one test alone for the diagnosis of
   Brucella spp. in buffalo milk.},

Year = {2008},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {The evaluation of animal welfare through innate immunity (Serum
   Bactericidal Activity - SBA, Hemolytic Complement Assay - HCA, lysozyme)
   and the antioxiclant status of the body (Reactive Oxygen Substances -
   ROS and Antioxiclant Power of plasma, AP) offers a reliable prognostic
   and diagnostic tool. The aim of the present study was to investigate
   trends and correlations between some traits of innate immunity and the
   oxidative status of fattening rabbits at different ages. Blood samples
   from 120 New Zealand White fattening rabbits at 45, 55, 65, and 75 d of
   age were collected and analyzed. The results showed that SBA did not
   have a normal distribution because of numerous 0 values. Data
   distribution was normal when only SBA > 0 values were considered.
   Lysozyme (mean value 27.19 mu g/mL) and HCA (mean value 50.84 CH50\%)
   had stable trends at different ages and showed a tendency that was
   comparable to that obtained in other animal species. On the contrary,
   SBA (mean value 42.15\%) showed an unexpected positive correlation with
   lysozyme (P<0.001) and a negative correlation with HCA (P<0.001). Oxygen
   free-radicals are involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases and
   oxidative stress alters immune competence. In this experiment, ROS and
   AP showed mean values of 0.60 mmol H2O2 and 421.67 mu mol HClO,
   respectively. In this context positive correlation coefficients between
   oxidative status traits and immune traits (P<0.001) were found, although
   at a very low level; and surprisingly, only ROS and SBA did not show any
   significant correlation. In this study it emerged that, even in the
   absence of evident pathologies, the immune and oxidative traits of
   fattening rabbits could be affected by environmental stress (weaning,
   cage, neighbors).},

Abstract = {Mycoplasma bovis is an important cause of calf pneumonia worldwide. In
   this study, we examined 140 cattle at slaughter comprising 70 veal
   calves and 70 beef cattle; 115 animals with pneumonic lesions and 25
   without. Lung samples were submitted for bacteriological, histological,
   and M. bovis-immunohistochemical analyses. Serology for M. bovis was
   positive in 76\% of beef cattle and 100\% of veal calves. M. bovis was
   isolated only from veal calves in 16 out of 64 pneumonic cases. M. bovis
   was detected by immunohistochemistry in seven bacteriologically positive
   cases. M. bovis antigen was associated with bronchogenic
   necrosuppurative or fibrinonecrotizing lesions. Bacteriologically
   positive and immunohistochemical negative cases were associated with
   catarrhal bronchointerstitial pneumonia. Results suggest that M. bovis
   infection may develop into a severe necrosuppurative bronchopneumonia or
   fibrinonecrotizing pneumonia when associated with a high number of
   intralesional organisms or, conversely, into a mild catarrhal
   bronchointerstitial pneumonia when associated with a low number of

Abstract = {The aims of this study were firstly to evaluate the pathogenicity of an
   Italian isolate of the QX strain of infectious bronchitis (IB) virus
   using 1-day-old female specific pathogen free chicks (layer type) and
   1-day-old female commercial broiler type chickens, and secondly to
   assess the level of protection induced in these birds by a vaccination
   programme including the IB Massachusetts and 4/91 serotype live
   attenuated vaccines. Unvaccinated birds showed clinical signs of varying
   severity, predominantly affecting the upper respiratory tract.
   Vaccinated birds appeared healthy, with the exception of a very mild
   conjunctivitis affecting a limited number of the broilers. Vaccination
   fully protected specific pathogen free birds, since no histopathological
   lesions were observed, nor was virus detected following challenge. In
   broilers, replication of the challenge virus was not prevented but was
   significantly reduced. This study confirms that vaccination at 1 day old
   and at 14 days of age using the Ma5 and 4/91 IB vaccines may be
   instrumental in reducing the economic impact of QX IB virus infections
   in layer and broiler farms.},

Abstract = {We demonstrate that blockade of the MEK/ERK signaling module, using the
   small-molecule inhibitors PD184352 or PD325901 (PD), strikingly enhances
   arsenic trioxide (ATO)-induced cytotoxicity in human myeloma cell lines
   (HMCLs) and in tumor cells from patients with multiple myeloma (MM)
   through a caspase-dependent mechanism. In HMCLs retaining a functional
   p53, PD treatment greatly enhances the ATO-induced p53 accumulation and
   p73, a p53 paralog, cooperates with p53 in caspase activation and
   apoptosis induction. In HMCLs carrying a nonfunctional p53, co-treatment
   with PD strikingly elevates the (DR4 + DR5)/(DcR1 + DcR2) tumor necrosis
   factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors ratio
   and caspase-8 activation of ATO-treated cells. In MM cells, irrespective
   of p53 status, the combined PD/ATO treatment increases the level of the
   proapoptotic protein Bim (PD-mediated) and decreases antiapoptotic
   protein Mcl-1 (ATO-mediated). Moreover, Bim physically interacts with
   both DR4 and DR5 TRAIL receptors in PD/ATO-treated cells, and loss of
   Bim interferes with the activation of both extrinsic and intrinsic
   apoptotic pathways in response to PD/ATO. Finally, PD/ATO treatment
   induces tumor regression, prolongs survival, and is well tolerated in
   vivo in a human plasmacytoma xenograft model. These preclinical studies
   provide the framework for testing PD325901 and ATO combination therapy
   in clinical trials aimed to improve patient outcome in MM.},

Abstract = {The fluorescence polarization assay (FPA) was evaluated for the
   serological diagnosis of brucellosis in water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis)
   in southern Italy. This assay uses O-polysaccharide prepared from
   Brucella abortus lipopolysaccharide conjugated with fluorescein
   isothiocyanate as a tracer. It has many methodological advantages over
   older, more established tests and can be performed in a fraction of the
   time.
   Sera from 890 buffalos from the Campania Region - 526 positive sera and
   364 negative sera according to the complement fixation test (CFT)-were
   evaluated in this study. All samples were tested with the Rose Bengal
   test (RBT), CFT, and FPA in parallel and in blind fashion. Sensitivities
   (Sn) were 84.5\% and 92.6\%, and specificities (Sp) were 93.1\% and
   91.2\% for RBT and FPA, respectively, relative to CFT.
   Finally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis suggested a
   cut-off value of 117 millipolarization (mP) units.
   On the whole, these results suggested that FPA might replace RBT in the
   diagnosis of buffalo brucellosis for its better performance relative to
   CFT, its adjustable cut-off useful in different epidemiological
   situations, its reliability, ease of performance, and for its potential
   application in field and high-throughput laboratories. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Pages = {5794-5800},

Abstract = {Purpose: Chlamydia psittaci (Cp) has been associated to ocular adnexal
   lymphomas (OAL) with variable geographic distribution. Herein, we used
   multiple Chlamdia detection tools to identify Cp elementary
   bodies-containing cell and to assess Cp prevalence in both nodal and
   extranodal lymphomas.
   Experimental Design: TETR-PCR, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence,
   electron microscopy, and laser-capture microdissection were done in 35
   OALs to define their effect in Chlamydia detection and, moreover, to
   identify the Cp cellular carrier. Cp prevalence was screened by TETR-PCR
   in 205 extraorbital lymphomas and 135 nonneoplastic controls.
   Results: Twenty-six (74\%) OALs were associated with Cp infection:
   immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and laser-capture
   microdissection-assisted PCR showed that monocytes/macrophages were the
   Cp carriers; electron microscopy showed the presence of intact CP
   elementary bodies into these cells. Immunohistochemistry and TETR-PCR
   showed a 70\% concordance rate (P = 0.001). Cp DNA was equally prevalent
   in non-OAL, nodal, and extranodal lymphomas: among the latter, it was
   more common in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas of the skin (P = 0.03) and
   Waldeyer's ring.
   Conclusions: This multiparametric approach shows, for the first time,
   that monocytes/macrophages are the carriers of Cp, Cp seems
   preferentially associated with lymphomas arising in organs primarily
   exposed to antigens. The clinical implications of these findings deserve
   to be prospectively investigated.},

Journal = {VACCINE},

Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {D70-D73},
Month = {SEP 12},
Abstract = {Although the use of vaccines against avian influenza viruses in birds
   has been discouraged over the years, the unprecedented occurrence of
   outbreaks caused by avian influenza (AI) viruses in recent times has
   required review of this policy. A variety of products are now available
   on the market, ranging from inactivated conventional to live recombinant
   products. The general consensus on the use of vaccination is that if
   complying to GMP standards and properly administered, birds will be more
   resistant to field challenge and will exhibit reduced shedding levels in
   case of infection. However, viral circulation may still occur in a
   clinically healthy vaccinated population. This may result in an endemic
   situation and in the emergence of antigenic variants. In order to limit
   these risks, monitoring programmes enabling the detection of field
   exposure in vaccinated populations are recommended by international
   organisations and are essential to allow the continuation of
   international trade. Adequate management of a vaccination campaign,
   including monitoring, improved biosecurity and restriction is essential
   for the success of any control program for AI. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Background: The aim of this study was to compare the tissue distribution
   and pathogenicity of three virulence variants of classical swine fever
   virus (CSFV) and to investigate the applicability of various
   conventional diagnostic procedures.
   Methods: 64 pigs were divided into three groups and infected with the
   highly virulent isolate ISS/60, the moderately virulent isolate
   Wingene'93 and the live attenuated vaccine strain Riems, respectively.
   Clinical signs, gross and histopathological changes were compared in
   relation to time elapsed post infection. Virus spread in various organs
   was followed by virus isolation, by immunohistochemistry, applying
   monoclonal antibodies in a two-step method and by in situ hybridisation
   using a digoxigenin-labelled riboprobe.
   Results: The tissue distribution data are discussed in details,
   analyzing the results of the various diagnostic approaches. The
   comparative studies revealed remarkable differences in the onset of
   clinical signs as well as in the development of the macro- and
   microscopical changes, and in the tissue distribution of CSFV in the
   three experimental groups.
   Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that in the case of highly
   and moderately virulent virus variants the virulence does not affect the
   pattern of the viral spread, however, it influences the outcome, the
   duration and the intensity of the disease. Immunohistochemistry has the
   advantage to allow the rapid detection and localisation of the virus,
   especially in cases of early infection, when clinical signs are still
   absent. Compared to virus isolation, the advantage of this method is
   that no cell culture facilities are required. Thus, immunohistochemistry
   provides simple and sensitive tools for the prompt detection of newly
   emerging variants of CSFV, including the viruses of very mild virulence.},

Title = {Somatostatin receptors 1, 2, and 5 cooperate in the somatostatin

Abstract = {Somatostatin inhibits cell proliferation through the activation of five
   receptors (SSTR1-5) expressed in normal and cancer cells. We analyzed
   the role of individual SSTRs in the antiproliferative activity of
   somatostatin in C6 rat glioma cells. Somatostatin dose-dependently
   inhibited C6 proliferation, an effect mimicked, with different efficacy
   or potency, by BIM-23745, BIM-23120, BIM-23206 (agonists for SSTR1, -2,
   and -5) and octreotide. The activation of SSTR3 was ineffective,
   although all SSTRs are functionally active, as demonstrated by the
   inhibition of cAMP production. All SSTRs induced cytostatic effects
   through the activation of the phosphotyrosine phosphatase PTP eta and
   the inhibition of ERK1/2. For possible synergism between SSTR subtypes,
   we tested the effects of the combined treatment with two agonists (SSTR1
   + 2 or SSTR2 + 5) or bifunctional compounds. The simultaneous activation
   of SSTR1 and SSTR2 slightly increased the efficacy of the individual
   compounds with an IC50 in between the single receptor activation. SSTR2
   + 5 activation displayed a pattern of response superimposable to that of
   the SSTR5 agonist alone (low potency and higher efficacy, as compared
   with BIM-23120). The simultaneous activation of SSTR1, -2, and -5
   resulted in a response similar to somatostatin. In conclusion, the
   cytostatic effects of somatostatin in C6 cells are mediated by the
   SSTR1, -2, and -5 through the same intracellular pathway: activation of
   PTP eta and inhibition of ERK1/2 activity. Somatostatin is more
   effective than the individual agonists. The combined activation of SSTR1
   and -2 shows a partial synergism as far as antiproliferative activity,
   whereas SSTR2 and -5 activation results in a response resembling the
   SSTR5 effects.},

   made based on histomorphological features and immunohistochemical
   results. Chondroid chordoma has been previously reported in humans,

Abstract = {Thirty-nine parvovirus strains contained in faecal samples collected in
   Italy (n=34) and UK (n=5) from cats with feline panleukopenia were
   characterized at the molecular level. All viruses were proven to be true
   feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV) strains by a minor groove binder probe
   assay, which is able to discriminate between FPLV and the closely
   related canine parvovirus type 2. By using sequence analysis of the VP2
   gene, it was found that the FPLV strains detected in Italy and UK were
   highly related to each other, with a nucleotide identity of 99.1-100 and
   99.4-99.8\% among Italian and British strains, respectively, whereas the
   similarities between all the sequences analysed were 98.6-100\%.
   Eighty-eight variable positions were detected in the VP2 gene of the
   field and reference FPLV strains, most of which were singletons.
   Synonymous substitutions (n=57) predominated over non-synonymous
   substitutions (n=31), and the ratio between synonymous and
   non-synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) was 0.10, thus confirming that
   evolution of FPLV is driven by random genetic drift rather than by
   positive selection pressure. Some amino acid mutations in the VP2
   protein affected sites that are thought to be responsible for antigenic
   and biological properties of the virus, but no clear patterns of
   segregation and genetic markers, were identified, confirming that FPLV
   is in evolutionary stasis.},

Abstract = {The study analyses the intestinal helminth communities found in 645 red
   foxes of alpine populations from five areas of Northern Italy. In
   particular, the aim was to evaluate the contribution of both
   environmental variability and the structure of fox population (extrinsic
   and intrinsic factors, respectively) in shaping the structure and
   composition of the intestinal helminth communities. To identify the
   influence of the characteristics of the host (i.e. age and sex) together
   with extrinsic factors (year, site, season, and altitude of collection)
   on number of species, total load per fox, prevalence and abundance of
   each parasite species, general linear models were performed. Fifteen
   helminth species have been detected in the intestine of 545 infected
   animals (84.5\%) with a total of 17,144 parasites collected. The
   analysis of factors influencing both prevalence and abundance of
   infection of the parasite species revealed the preponderance of
   extrinsic factors on intrinsic ones. In particular, geographical areas
   influenced prevalence and abundance of every parasite species, showing
   high spatial variability. The lower influence of host factors may
   suggest that, in this case, host dynamics play a trivial role with
   respect to spatial variability in determining parasite abundance. These
   results pointed out high prevalence of intestinal helminth infections in
   the Italian Alpine fox, confirmed the typical composition of parasite
   fauna within fox populations, underlined local differences in the
   structure and composition of the helminth communities. Moreover, this
   study highlights the major role of extrinsic factors vs intrinsic ones.},

Abstract = {Ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma (OAML) is linked to Chlamydophila psittaci
   (Cp) infection. Viability and infectivity of Cp, demonstrated by growth
   in culture, has not been yet investigated in these patients. We
   conducted a single-center prospective case-control study to assess the
   prevalence, viability and infectivity of Cp in 20 OAML patients and 42
   blood donors registered in a 6-month period. The presence of Cp in
   conjunctival swabs and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of
   patients and donors was assessed by TETR-PCR and in vitro cultures. From
   an epidemiological point of view, OAML patients often resided in rural
   areas, and reported a history of chronic conjunctivitis and prolonged
   contact with household animals (85\% vs. 38\% of donors; p = 0.00001).
   Cp was detected in lymphoma tissue in 15 (75\%) patients. Cp DNA was
   detected in conjunctival swabs and/or PBMC from 10 (50\%) patients and
   in PBMC from 1 (2\%) donor (p = 0.01). Viability and infectivity of Cp,
   demonstrated by growth in culture, were confirmed in conjunctival swabs
   and/or PBMC from 5 (25\%) patients, but not in donors (p = 0.002). This
   prospective study demonstrates, for the first time, that Cp present in
   the conjunctiva and PBMC of OAML patients is capable to grow and be
   isolated in cell cultures. Cp infection is common in OAML patients and
   exceptional in blood donors. Epidemiological data of OAML patients
   (prolonged contact with household animals and chronic conjunctivitis)
   are consistent with Cp exposure risk. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Feline spongiform encephalopathy (FSE) is a transmissible spongiform
   encephalopathy associated with the Consumption of feedstuffs
   contaminated with tissue from bovine spongiform encephalopathy-affected
   cattle and characterized by the accumulation in the central nervous
   system of an abnormal isoform of the prion protein (PrPSC). Clinically,
   it presents as a progressive fatal neurologic syndrome that is not
   easily distinguished from other feline neurologic conditions. Most cases
   of FSE have been reported in England, where It was first detected in
   1990, but a few cases have been reported from other European countries.
   To identify possible cases of FSE in Italy, the Italian Ministry of
   Health funded a 2-year surveillance project during which the brains from
   110 domestic cats with neurologic signs were evaluated histologically
   for spongiform encephalopathy and immunohistochemically to detect PrPSC.
   Although no cases of FSE were found, the Study proved useful in
   monitoring the Italian cat population for other neurologic diseases:
   neoplasia (21.8\%), toxic-metabolic encephalopathy (18.2\%),
   granulomatous encephalitis (15.5\%), suppurative encephalitis (4.6\%),
   trauma (3.6\%), circulatory disorders (3.6\%), degeneration (2.7\%),
   nonsuppurative encephalitis (2.7\%), and neuromuscular diseases (1.8\%).
   No histologic lesions were Found in 20\% of the brains, and samples from
   5.5\% of the cats were rejected as unsuitable.},

Abstract = {In the recent years, USUTU virus (USUV), a flavivirus of the Japanese
   encephalitis virus complex, has been reported in Central Europe. As part
   of a systematic surveillance programme to monitor possible entrance
   and/or circulation of vector-borne viruses, since 2001, sentinel-chicken
   flocks were placed throughout the Italian territory nearby areas
   considered at risk of virus introduction. They have been periodically
   checked for the presence of antibodies against flaviviruses by indirect
   ELISA, plaque reduction neutralization test for USUTU, West Nile and
   tick-borne encephalitis viruses. In July 2007, a sentinel chicken in a
   flock of 20 animals located within the Ravenna province seroconverted to
   USUV reaching neutralizing titres up to 1 : 5120. A second chicken
   seroconverted to the same virus 2 months later. Although no virus was
   rescued from these animals and from wild or farm birds sampled in the
   area, these results still provided evidence of the circulation of USUV
   in north-eastern Italy.},

Abstract = {DNA extracted from 363 ticks collected in Ethiopia and 9 ticks collected
   in Chad, Africa were screened by PCR to detect DNA from spotted fever
   group rickettsiae. Fifteen ticks (4.1\%) collected in Ethiopia and one
   tick (11\%) collected in Chad tested positive when PCR targeting the
   gltA and ompA rickettsial genes was performed. PCR-positive products of
   the gltA and ompA genes were used for DNA sequencing. Rickettsia africae
   was detected in 12/118 Amblyomma lepidum and in 1/2 A. variegatum. Also,
   2/12 Hyalommo marginatum rufipes collected in Ethiopia and one H.
   marginatum rufipes collected in Chad were positive for R. aeschlimannii.
   Our results confirm the previously reported presence of R. africae in
   Ethiopia and also show the first evidence of R. aeschlimannii in ticks

   product were aseptically collected from 2 Italian dairy herds from
   February to November of 2006. Prototheca zopfii was isolated from 11.9\%
   of milk samples, 15\% of feces, and 33.3\% of bedding samples. No viable
   cells of P. zopfii were observed in water before washing procedures,
   whereas 25 to 28.6\% of samples from water used for washing both
   refrigeration tanks and milking equipment were contaminated with this
   yeast-like microalga. Analogously, the presence of P. zopfii was
   detected only on swabs collected from the liners after milking.
   Interestingly, in 1 of the 2 herds, water from the drinking trough was
   contaminated by viable cells of both P. zopfii and the related
   environmental species Prototheca stagnora. No viable cells were observed
   in cow feed. On the basis of the results presented herein, P. zopfii
   seemed to be widespread throughout the environments of dairy herds where
   outbreaks of bovine mastitis had occurred.},

Abstract = {This study investigated two foodborne outbreaks of gastroenteritis that
   occurred 10 days apart among individuals who had meals at the restaurant
   of a farm holiday resort. Mild gastrointestinal symptoms were reported
   and none of the patients needed hospitalization. Mean incubation times
   were 45 and 33 h, and the overall attack rates were 43.5 and 58.3 \%,
   respectively. Stool sample examination was negative for common enteric
   pathogens in both outbreaks. Specimens from 13 people involved in the
   second outbreak and 3 restaurant staff were examined for diarrhoeagenic
   Escherichia coli. An enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) strain of serotype
   O92 : H33 was isolated from six participants and one member of staff. In
   particular, the EAEC strain was isolated from five of the six cases of
   diarrhoea examined. The strain showed an aggregative pattern of
   adherence to HEp-2 cells, did not produce a biofilm and possessed the
   virulence-related genes aat, aggR, aap and set1A, but not the astA gene.
   A retrospective cohort study indicated a pecorino cheese made with
   unpasteurized sheep milk as the possible source (P<0.001). Samples of
   the cheese had E. coli counts higher than 10(6) c.f.u. g(-1), but the
   outbreak EAEC strain was not isolated. This report confirms that EAEC
   infections are probably underdiagnosed because of the limited
   availability of laboratories capable of identifying this group of
   pathogenic E. coli.},

Abstract = {A sensitive and selective analytical method was developed for the
   quantitative determination of fumonisins B-1 and B-2 in maize-based
   foods for direct human Consumption. The method, based on
   high-performance liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection,
   presents a rapid and automated on-line post-column derivatization,
   performed with o-phtalaldehyde and N,N-dimethyl-2-mercaptoethylamine
   Several factors affecting the separation and detection of fumonisins
   were investigated, including mobile phase Composition, column features,
   derivatization agent flow-rate and both the excitation and the emission
   wavelengths. Optimal fluorescence detection was obtained by using
   lambda(exc) of 343 nm and lambda(em) of 445 nm. Under the optimized
   experimental conditions, a complete separation of fumonisins was
   obtained in less than 13 min by using a C-18 column and a gradient
   elution at 0.8 mL/min with methanol and 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH
   3.15. The limits of detection for FB1 and FB2 were 4 and 5 mu g/L
   corresponding to 5 and 6 mu g/kg in matrix. Each fumonisin was
   determined in the range 40-320 mu g/L that correspond to 50-400 mu g/kg
   in matrix. The necessary requirements for accuracy, reproducibility and
   sensitivity were fulfilled and recovery values ranged from 87 to 94\%
   for FB1 and from 70 to 75\% for FB2 in cornflake samples at three
   fortification levels in the range 100-300 mu g/kg. The potential of this
   method, combined with a simple clean-up procedure, was assessed by the
   measurements of FBI and FB2 in maize-based products, Such as maize
   flour, ``polenta{''}, tortillas and cookies. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {In this study, the isolation of 52 mycobactin-independent fast growing
   mycobacteria from 631 bulk milk samples (8.2\%), is reported. These
   strains, isolated during a bulk milk survey for Mycobacterium avium
   subsp. paratuberculosis (Map), strongly affected Map detection both by
   PCR and by culture, as they gave a positive IS900 PCR signal and
   resulted to totally inhibit the growth of Map when spotted on HEYM
   slants already inoculated with 200 mu 1 of 10-fold dilutions containing
   from 5 x 10 to 5 x 10(3) Map cells/ml. 16S rRNA gene sequencing, using
   the MicroSeq 500 16S rDNA Bacterial Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems),
   was performed on a subset of six strains, identifying Mycobacterium
   porcinum with 100\% homology in all six cases. The 52 strains were
   characterized by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)
   analysis of the hsp65 gene, which confirmed the identification of M.
   porcinum for all the isolates. Using specific primers designed on the
   Map-IS900 sequence and on the M. porcinum sequence determined in this
   study, a 1385 bp sequence from the M. porcinum genome was characterized.
   This IS900-like sequence showed 82\% homology with Map IS900. From our
   findings the following results emerged: (a) any culture showing one or
   more M. porcinum colonies represents a potential ``false negative{''}
   result and should therefore be considered as contaminated; (b)
   IS900-like elements could be more widespread than was previously
   thought; (c) IS900 PCR positive results should be interpreted
   cautiously, as confirmed by the evidence that the primer pair used in
   this study resulted not to be specific (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Atypical BSE (BASE) Transmitted from Asymptomatic Aging Cattle to a
   Primate},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {3},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {Background: Human variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) results from
   foodborne transmission of prions from slaughtered cattle with classical
   Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (cBSE). Atypical forms of BSE, which
   remain mostly asymptomatic in aging cattle, were recently identified at
   slaughterhouses throughout Europe and North America, raising a question
   about human susceptibility to these new prion strains.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Brain homogenates from cattle with
   classical BSE and atypical (BASE) infections were inoculated
   intracerebrally into cynomolgus monkeys (Macacca fascicularis), a
   non-human primate model previously demonstrated to be susceptible to the
   original strain of cBSE. The resulting diseases were compared in terms
   of clinical signs, histology and biochemistry of the abnormal prion
   protein (PrPres). The single monkey infected with BASE had a shorter
   survival, and a different clinical evolution, histopathology, and prion
   protein (PrPres) pattern than was observed for either classical BSE or
   vCJD-inoculated animals. Also, the biochemical signature of PrPres in
   the BASE-inoculated animal was found to have a higher proteinase K
   sensitivity of the octa-repeat region. We found the same biochemical
   signature in three of four human patients with sporadic CJD and an MM
   type 2 PrP genotype who lived in the same country as the infected
   bovine.
   Conclusion/Significance: Our results point to a possibly higher degree
   of pathogenicity of BASE than classical BSE in primates and also raise a
   question about a possible link to one uncommon subset of cases of
   apparently sporadic CJD. Thus, despite the waning epidemic of classical
   BSE, the occurrence of atypical strains should temper the urge to relax
   measures currently in place to protect public health from accidental
   contamination by BSE-contaminated products.},

Abstract = {The sensitivity and specificity of six ELISA tests for foot-and-mouth
   disease (FMD) to discriminate between sero-converted (for non-structural
   FMD virus proteins) and non-sero-converted cattle were evaluated for
   vaccinated and unvaccinated cattle. Since none of the tests could be
   considered as a proper reference test and for about half of the tested
   sera the true status (sero-converted or not for non-structural proteins,
   i.e. presence of antibodies) of the animals was unknown, a Bayesian
   analysis employing a latent class model was used that did not rely on
   the use of a reference test or gold standard. Prior information about
   prevalence for subsets of the data and specificity of the tests was
   incorporated into the analysis.
   The specificity of the six tests for vaccinated and non-vaccinated
   cattle ranged from 96 to 99\%. For vaccinated cattle, one test stood out
   with an estimated sensitivity of 94\% (95\% CI from 89.8 to 98.1 \%).
   Second best for vaccinated cattle were two tests with estimated
   sensitivities of 85\% (95\% CI from 78.9 to 89.7\%) and 92\% (95\% CI
   from 86.2 to 95.6\%). For non-vaccinated cattle, the sensitivities of
   these three tests were around 97\%. The remaining three tests showed
   lowerestimated sensitivity for vaccinated cattle, ranging from 57 to
   79\%. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   different avian species from 1988 through 2003, were tested in vivo and
   found to replicate in ferrets. However these viruses achieved mild peak
   viral titers in nasal washes when compared to those observed with a
   human H3N2 virus. Two of these H9N2 viruses transmitted to direct
   contact ferrets, however no aerosol transmission was detected in the
   virus displaying the most efficient direct contact transmission. A
   leucine (Leu) residue at amino acid position 226 in the hemagglutinin (
   HA) receptor-binding site (RBS), responsible for human virus-like
   receptor specificity, was found to be important for the transmission of
   the H9N2 viruses in ferrets. In addition, an H9N2 avian-human
   reassortant virus, which contains the surface glycoprotein genes from an
   H9N2 virus and the six internal genes of a human H3N2 virus, showed
   enhanced replication and efficient transmission to direct contacts.
   Although no aerosol transmission was observed, the virus replicated in
   multiple respiratory tissues and induced clinical signs similar to those
   observed with the parental human H3N2 virus. Our results suggest that
   the establishment and prevalence of H9N2 viruses in poultry pose a
   significant threat for humans.},

Abstract = {The histological status of the thymus, blood cortisol concentration and
   circulating neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio were evaluated in 349
   slaughtered beef cattle, to assess the potential of these parameters as
   indirect biomarkers of the illegal use of corticosteroids in meat
   production. The livers of 20 of the animals were analysed chemically for
   residues of corticosteroids. The morphology of the thymus was examined
   for adipose tissue infiltration, cortical atrophy and `starry sky'
   appearance, and on the basis of these characteristics, the animals were
   considered to be negative, suspected or positive for illegal
   corticosteroid treatment. The animals considered to be negative had a
   mean cortisol concentration that was significantly higher (29 ng/ml)
   than that of the animals suspected for corticosteroid treatment (22
   ng/ml). Using the chemical analysis as the gold standard for identifying
   illegally treated animals, the histological examination of the thymus
   had a sensitivity of 100 per cent and a specificity of 85 per cent. The
   samples that were positive by chemical analysis had cortisol
   concentrations of less than 2.0 ng/ml, whereas the mean cortisol
   concentration of the negative samples was 10.3 ng/ml.},

Title = {PCDD and PCDF depletion in milk from dairy cows according to the herd
   metabolic scenario},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {73},
Number = {1, S, SI},
Pages = {S216-S219},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {High level of PCDD + PCDF contamination in bulk milk (9.7 pgWHO-TE g(-1)
   fat) from 1604 Holstein Fresian lactacting cows was observed just four
   weeks after the beginning of their exposure to a feed supplement
   contaminated at 10.4 ngWHO-TE kg(-1) dry matter. In-farm produced hay
   and silage showed levels not exceeding 0.2 ng WHO-TE kg(-1) dry matter.
   After the supplement withdrawal, it was possible to monitor the
   depletion phase for a following 75-day period in milk, until the levels
   dropped well below 3.0 pgWHC-TE g(-1) fat, the EU regulatory Maximum
   Residue Level for PCDD + PCDF. During this phase, the half-life was
   calculated as 17 +/- 3 days, on WHO-TEQ basis. The full availability of
   farm data on both cow nutrition and milk production allowed the
   calculation of the carry-over rate (COR) (PCDD + PCDF milk excretion vs.
   feed), which was 46\% at the end of the exposure. This CDR value is
   justified from the main TE contribution of Penta-CDD and -CDF congeners
   (63\%), and the half-life is among the shortest of all those described
   in the literature both for experimental and naturally-exposed dairy
   cows. A fugacity-based model predicts a bulk milk contamination of 5
   pgWHO-TE g(-1) fat, compared to the 10 pgWHO-TE g-1 fat level observed.
   Such findings are discussed in light of the lactation and metabolic
   status of the herd for which the transition period, characterised by a
   negative metabolic energy balance and a consequent adipose tissue
   mobilization, could play a relevant role. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Evidence of infection by H5N2 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses
   in healthy wild waterfowl},
Journal = {PLOS PATHOGENS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {4},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The potential existence of a wild bird reservoir for highly pathogenic
   avian influenza (HPAI) has been recently questioned by the spread and
   the persisting circulation of H5N1 HPAI viruses, responsible for
   concurrent outbreaks in migratory and domestic birds over Asia, Europe,
   and Africa. During a large-scale surveillance programme over Eastern
   Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, we detected avian influenza viruses
   of H5N2 subtype with a highly pathogenic (HP) viral genotype in healthy
   birds of two wild waterfowl species sampled in Nigeria. We monitored the
   survival and regional movements of one of the infected birds through
   satellite telemetry, providing a rare evidence of a non-lethal natural
   infection by an HP viral genotype in wild birds. Phylogenetic analysis
   of the H5N2 viruses revealed close genetic relationships with H5 viruses
   of low pathogenicity circulating in Eurasian wild and domestic ducks. In
   addition, genetic analysis did not reveal known gallinaceous poultry
   adaptive mutations, suggesting that the emergence of HP strains could
   have taken place in either wild or domestic ducks or in non-gallinaceous
   species. The presence of coexisting but genetically distinguishable
   avian influenza viruses with an HP viral genotype in two cohabiting
   species of wild waterfowl, with evidence of non-lethal infection at
   least in one species and without evidence of prior extensive circulation
   of the virus in domestic poultry, suggest that some strains with a
   potential high pathogenicity for poultry could be maintained in a
   community of wild waterfowl.},

Title = {Single laboratory validation data and uncertainty estimation of a liquid

Journal = {WORLD MYCOTOXIN JOURNAL},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {1},
Number = {3},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In the present work we have validated an analytical method for the
   determination of aflatoxin B-1 in dairy compound feeds and peanut meal.
   The method is based on a preliminary extraction with a mixture of
   methanol and water followed by a clean-up step with immunoaffinity
   column. The content of aflatoxin B-1 is then established using
   reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with
   fluorescence detection. The method is fully validated by using Certified
   Reference Materials. Limit of detection is found to be 0.5x10(-3) mg/kg.
   The Bartlett test has shown that the method is affected by a systematic
   error and as a consequence the results must be corrected for the
   recovery. The precision is found in all cases lower than those
   calculated by Horwitz equation. Uncertainty estimation has been
   performed taking into account the bottom-up approach as stated in the
   Eurachem/Citac guide. With this method the uncertainty is calculated by
   the addition of variances for a measurand M when the equation for the
   calculation of M is based only on multiplications and divisions. The
   bottom-up approach is a tool which identifies the parameters or working
   steps with an overly contribution to the total uncertainty, thus
   offering the chance to improve them. The final uncertainty budget has
   revealed that the main contributions to global uncertainty are those due
   to the recovery and to the calibration function.},

Title = {Improved diagnosis for nine viral diseases considered as notifiable by

Abstract = {Nine viral diseases included in the World Organization for Animal Health
   list of notifiable diseases (former list A) were chosen for their
   contagiousness and high capacity of spreading to improve their diagnosis
   using new and emerging technologies. All the selected diseases -
   foot-and-mouth disease, swine vesicular disease, vesicular stomatitis,
   classical swine fever, African swine fever, bluetongue, African horse
   sickness, Newcastle disease and highly pathogenic avian influenza - are
   considered as transboundary diseases, which detection causes the
   prohibition of livestock exportation, and, thus, it leads to high
   economical losses. The applied diagnostic techniques can fall into two
   categories: (i) nucleic-acid detection, including padlock probes,
   real-time PCR with TaqMan, minor groove binding probes and fluorescence
   energy transfer reaction probes, isothermal amplification like the
   Cleavase/Invader assay or the loop-mediated amplification technology and
   the development of rapid kits for `mobile' PCR and (ii) antigen-antibody
   detection systems like simplified and more sensitive ELISA tests.
   Besides, internal controls have been improved for nucleic acid-detecting
   methods by using an RNA plant virus - Cowpea Mosaic Virus - to ensure
   the stability of the RNA used as a positive control in diagnostic
   real-time RT-PCR assays. The development of these diagnosis techniques
   has required the joint efforts of a European consortium in which nine
   diagnostic laboratories and an SME who have collaborated since 2004
   within the European Union-funded Lab-on-site project. The results
   obtained are shown in this paper.},

Abstract = {Histophilus somni (formerly named Haemophilus somnus), a gram-negative,
   nonmotile pleomorphic bacterium, causes a variety of disease in cattle,
   including thrombotic meningoencephalitis (TME), pleuropneumonia,
   myocarditis, otitis, conjunctivitis, vaginitis, endometritis, mastitis,
   infertility and abortion. The disease occurs most commonly in cattle
   from 4 to 10 months of age during the fall and winter months. This
   report describes two clinical cases observed in beef and veal calves
   showing hyperthermia, lateral recumbence, opistotonus and blindness. On
   post mortem and histopathologic examination thrombotic
   meningoencephalitis (TME) and severe fibrin purulent pleuropneumonia
   were detected. Pure growth of H. somni was obtained from fluid present
   in the pericardial sac. Etiopathogenesis of H. somni infection is
   considered as well as possible therapeutic and prophylactic approaches.},

Abstract = {Small ruminants routine castration is carried out employing several
   methods. The most common are rubber ring (applied by elastrator),
   Burdizzo method, Rubber Ring + Burdizzo. Regrettably, the ``knife
   castration{''} without anesthesia is still employed, too. Commonly
   accepted international welfare standards are frequently not respected.
   However, according to the method, animals experience different levels of
   stress. Several biochemical and behavioral indicators are available to
   quantify stress induced by the various castration methods and correlate
   procedures. The combined method (Rubber Ring + Burdizzo) was proven to
   be less painful than others. However, to minimize stress during small
   ruminants castration, it is necessary to improve present methods and
   look forward in order to find new painless ones. The employment of
   analgesics and local anesthesia is strongly recommended to further
   increase animal welfare during castration.},

Abstract = {The SH2D2A gene encodes a T-cell-specific adapter protein involved in
   the negative control of T-cell activation. The genotype GA13-16
   homozygote of the SH2D2A gene promoter has been associated with the
   susceptibility to develop multiple sclerosis. Chronic inflammatory
   dernyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is an immune-mediated
   neuropathy sharing several pathogenetic mechanisms with multiple
   sclerosis. We genotyped the SH2D2A promoter region in 105 controls and
   48 patients with CIDP. We found a significant association between CIDP
   and the genotype GA 13-16 homozygote (OR 3.167; p 0.013). We hypothesize
   that this genotype is associated with the susceptibility to develop CIDP
   and may be implicated in the persistence of the disease. (C) 2008

Abstract = {Three hundred and ninety-seven randomly selected households were
   interviewed by telephone to determine the numbers and management of
   owned cats and dogs in the Teramo Province of Italy. The households were
   selected using stratified random sampling for each municipality;
   municipalities were combined into coastal, central hills and mountain
   regions for analysis. The interviews were completed during May and June
   of 2004 with a response rate of 74\% (397/536). Forty-six percent of
   households (n = 181) owned pets; 15\% of all households (n = 60) owned
   cats and 33\% (n = 130) owned dogs. Twenty-seven of these households
   (7\%) owned both cats and dogs. Data were provided on 91 cats evenly
   divided between males and females. The median age was 3 years (range
   0.2-10 years). Forty-one percent of cats (36/87) entered the household
   as strays. Nearly half lived entirely outside. Seventy percent (62/ 88)
   had visited a veterinarian at least once; 43\% (39/91) were sterilized.
   About 1/3 had had a litter and all litters were considered accidental
   rather than planned. Age, indoor/outdoor status, veterinarian visit and
   region were all associated with sterilization. Age, confined to a yard,
   veterinary visit and region were associated with allowing the cat to
   roam freely. Data were provided on 182 dogs. Sixty-two percent (113/
   181) were male, with a median age of 4 years (range newborn to 17 years)
   and 40\% (72/181) were purebred. Almost half were acquired as a gift.
   Sixty-two percent (112/180) were kept entirely outside despite the fact
   that 82\% (147/180) were considered companions rather than working dogs.
   Almost all of the dogs had been to a veterinarian at least once; only
   20\% (n = 29) were sterilized. Male dogs were significantly less likely
   to be sterilized than females. Almost half the dogs had had at least one
   litter. Seventy-six percent (137/180) of dogs knew some basic commands.
   Sex, source and training to sit/stay/come were significantly associated
   with whether the dog was sterilized. Dog size, confinement to a yard,
   trained to leash walk, veterinary visit and region were predictors of
   roaming freely. Source and trained to leash walk were associated with
   dog registration. For cats and dogs, education about sterilization
   seemed to be critically important. For dogs, factors relating to
   training, which may reflect the strength of the human-animal bond, were
   also important. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens
   isolated from cattle in different European countries: 2002-2004},
Journal = {ACTA VETERINARIA SCANDINAVICA},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {50},
Month = {JUL 8},
Abstract = {Background: The project ``Antibiotic resistance in bacteria of animal
   origin - II{''} (ARBAO-II) was funded by the European Union
   (FAIR5-QLK2-2002-01146) for the period 2003 - 2005, with the aim to
   establish a continuous monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility among
   veterinary laboratories in European countries based on validated and
   harmonised methodologies. Available summary data of the susceptibility
   testing of the bacterial pathogens from the different laboratories were
   collected.
   Method: Antimicrobial susceptibility data for several bovine pathogens
   were obtained over a three year period (2002-2004). Each year the
   participating laboratories were requested to fill in excelfile templates
   with national summary data on the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance
   from different bacterial species.
   A proficiency test (EQAS - external quality assurance system) for
   antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted each year to test the
   accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the participating
   laboratories. The data from this testing demonstrated that for the
   species included in the EQAS the results are comparable between
   countries.
   Results: Data from 25,241 isolates were collected from 13 European
   countries. For Staphylococcus aureus from bovine mastitis major
   differences were apparent in the occurrence of resistance between
   countries and between the different antimicrobial agents tested. The
   highest frequency of resistance was observed for penicillin. For
   Mannheimia haemolytica resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline and
   trimethoprim/sulphonamide were observed in France, the Netherlands and
   Portugal. All isolates of Pasteurella multocida isolated in Finland and
   most of those from Denmark, England (and Wales), Italy and Sweden were
   susceptible to the majority of the antimicrobials. Streptococcus
   dysgalactiae and Streptococcus uberis isolates from Sweden were fully
   susceptible. For the other countries some resistance was observed to
   tetracycline, gentamicin and erythromycin. More resistance and variation
   of the resistance levels between countries were observed for Escherichia
   coli compared to the other bacterial species investigated.
   Conclusion: In general, isolates from Denmark, England (and Wales), the
   Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland showed low frequencies of
   resistance, whereas many isolates from Belgium, France, Italy, Latvia
   and Spain were resistant to most antimicrobials tested. In the future,
   data on the prevalence of resistance should be used to develop
   guidelines for appropriate antimicrobial use in veterinary medicine.},

Abstract = {The relationship among the frequency, population size and phospholipase
   activity of Malassezia pachydermatis was investigated for dogs with
   Leishmania infantum infection (Li+) and those without evidence of this
   infection (Li-). A group of 188 dogs (141 without and 47 with skin
   lesions) was examined clinically, and samples were taken for the
   detection of Malassezia and L. infantum using various diagnostic
   methods. Malassezia was cultured from skin samples from 101 (53.7\%)
   dogs and classified biochemically and molecularly as M. pachydermatis. A
   significantly higher mean population size of M. pachydermatis was
   cultured from the skin of L+ dogs compared with L- dogs. For M.
   pachydermatis, most phospolipase-producing cultures and the highest
   phospholipase activity were recorded for L- dogs with lesions and L+
   dogs without lesions. The results showed that M. pachydermatis was a
   common commensal on dogs with or without L. infantum infection and
   established that L. infantum infection in dogs without skin lesions was
   associated with increased growth of M. pachydermatis and production of
   phospholipase in vitro. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A total of 117 Escherichia coli from colibacillosis affected (APEC) and
   clinically healthy birds (AFEC) were serotyped and tested for the
   presence of virulence genes: iss, tsh, cva.
   A total of 54.5\% E. Coli were typeable and 15 different serogroups were
   identified. The most common serogroups among APEC strains were 078, 02
   and 0128, whereas 0139 was predominant in faecal strains from healthy
   birds.
   Iss, tsh e cva were more frequently detected among the septicaemic E.
   coli strains. The association of virulence genes was observed.
   Particularly, the pathotype iss-tsh-cva was present in 46.5\% of APEC
   strains.
   Referring to serogroups, E. coli 078 and 02 originating from
   colibacillosis affected birds were always iss-tsh-cva positive but did
   not share virulence genes when they came from healthy birds.},

Abstract = {The widespread perception of the effectiveness of applying tests based
   on the detection of antibodies against foot-and-mouth disease (FMD)
   viral non-capsid proteins (NCPs) to assess virus circulation
   irrespective of vaccination triggered the demand for international
   standards to evaluate the comparative performance of the upcoming assays
   against the OIE Index test developed at the Pan American Foot-and-Mouth
   Disease Center, PAHO/WHO. To this end, a panel was developed composed of
   34 cattle sera from animals with an unambiguous exposed/infected status,
   covering serotypes O, A and C, obtained either under experimental
   conditions or from the field in regions with different epidemiological
   situations. Reference values in the Index test and their reproducibility
   in other laboratories, data on stability as well as results in four
   other commercial kits and one in house test were obtained. The
   characteristics of the panel which comprise adequate preparation
   following international guidelines, a broad range of antibody
   reactivity, proper stability and the ability to assess comparative
   diagnostic sensitivity, make it suitable as a reference standard to
   evaluate if tests equivalent to the OIE Index method are used in support
   of FMD control programs and by trading partners, and also whether they
   maintain their standards of diagnostic performance. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Title = {Buffalo behavioural response to machine milking in early lactation},

Year = {2008},

Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Buffalo farming in Italy is traditionally oriented towards mozzarella
   cheese production and over the last decade it has been rapidly
   increased. As a result, intensive techniques and mechanisation of farm
   activities have been introduced. Those sudden changes in rearing
   techniques have aroused a general concern about buffaloes welfare and
   its possible consequences on products quality.Human-animal interactions
   are recognized to have an impact on productivity, behaviour and welfare,
   particularly in dairy farms, where the milking process involves a close.
   interaction with a human handler. Focusing on the first month of
   lactation, this preliminary study aimed at evidencing buffalo
   behavioural responses to machine milking. Relationship between behaviour
   and oxytocin administrations, often per-formed to allow milk let down,
   has been also investigated. The experiment included 8 multiparous and 6
   primiparous buffaloes, calving in the same period. Starting from the
   first entrance in the milking parlour, the animals were followed two
   days/ week during the morning milking for the first 5 weeks of
   lactation. Behaviour observation was performed following a ``focal
   animal sampling{''} (continuous recording) technique. Proportional
   frequencies of the following behaviours were calculated: kicking,
   stepping, defecating, urinating, vocalizing, pulling the teat cup off
   the teats. The exogenous oxytocin administration at milking was
   recorded. Pearson Chi-Square test was used to verify the presence of
   differences between primiparous and multiparous cows' behaviour at
   milking. Cochran's Q test was used to assess the variability of
   behaviour over time and a binomial regression was performed in order to
   verify the correlations between animal behaviours and the need to
   administer oxytocin. Considering lactation number, every behavioural
   pattern in primiparous cows, except for stepping, resulted to be more
   frequently performed (36.67\% vs 24.36\% for kicking; 5\% vs 2.56\% for
   defecating; 11.67\% vs 5.13\% for pulling the teat cup off the
   teats).The behaviour of urinating (48.33\% vs 11.54\%) proved to have a
   significantly higher mean frequency of occurrence compared to the
   multiparous one (P<0.001). The frequency of oxytocin administration
   showed a high variability over time (P<0.001), soon decreasing, while
   the selected behaviours proved to be more stable in time, except for
   kicking and urinating (P<0.05). Some correlations between animal
   behaviour at milking and oxytocin administration were found;
   particularly kicking, stepping and urinating appeared to be
   significantly related to the requirement of exogenous molecule
   (P<0.001). The occurrence of behaviours considered as indicators of
   acute stress and their correlation with oxytocin administration are a
   clear proof of the machine milking impact on buffaloes welfare and
   productivity.},

Abstract = {Corynebacterium urealyticum is an uncommon cause of urinary tract
   infections in cats. However, it is difficult to diagnose and if left
   untreated it may result in irreversible bladder lesions. C urealyticum
   is a multiantibiotic-resistant bacterium whose culture requires special
   care. Risk factors for the occurrence of this infection include
   urological procedures, foreign bodies, bladder mucosa abnormalities,
   immuno-suppressed states and antibiotic treatment. This report describes
   an unusual case of C urealyticum urinary infection in a young cat with
   pre-existing urethral obstruction. C urealyticum was isolated in pure
   cultures from two urine samples. Clinical and ultrasound features,
   results of the urinalysis and urine culture are described as well as
   therapeutic treatment and eventual favourable outcome to treatment with
   amoxycillin-clavulanic acid. (c) 2007 ESFM and AAFP. Published by

Abstract = {In 2005, a prion disease identified in a goat from France was reported
   to be consistent with disease from the bovine spongiform encephalopathy
   (BSE) agent. Subsequent retrospective examination of UK goat scrapie
   cases led to the identification of one potentially similar, but as yet
   unconfirmed, case from Scotland. These findings strengthened concerns
   that small ruminant populations exposed to the BSE agent have become
   infected. The lack of data relating specifically to scrapie in goats has
   been contributory to past assumptions that, in general, sheep and goats
   respond similarly to prion infections. In this study, brain material
   from 22 archived caprine scrapie cases from the UK was reviewed by
   histopathology and by immunohistochemical examination for accumulations
   of disease-specific prion protein (PrPSc) to provide c additional data
   on the lesions of caprine scrapie and to identify any BSE-like features.
   The vacuolar chang observed in the goats was characteristic of
   transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in general. PrPSc
   immunohistochemical morphologic forms described in scrapie and
   experimental BSE infections of sheep were demonstrable in the goats, but
   these were generally more extensive and variable in PrPSc accumulation.
   None of the cases examined showed a PrPSc immunohistochemical pattern
   indicative of BSE.},

Abstract = {In humans, contrast-enhanced fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)
   imaging plays an important role in detecting brain disease. The aim of
   this study was to define the clinical utility of contrast-enhanced FLAIR
   imaging by comparing the results with those with contrast-enhanced spin
   echo T1-weighted images (SE T1WI) in animals with different brain
   disorders. Forty-one dogs and five cats with a clinical suspicion of
   brain disease and 30 normal animals (25 dogs and five cats) were
   evaluated using a 0.2 T permanent magnet. Before contrast medium
   injection, spin echo T1-weighted, SE T1WI, and FLAIR sequences were
   acquired in three planes. SE T1WI and FLAIR images were also acquired
   after gadolinium injection. Sensitivity in detecting the number,
   location, margin, and enhancement pattern and rate were evaluated. No
   lesions were found in a normal animal. In affected animals, 48 lesions
   in 34 patients were detected in contrast-enhanced SE T1WI whereas 81
   lesions in 44 patients were detected in contrast-enhanced FLAIR images.
   There was no difference in the characteristics of the margins or
   enhancement pattern of the detected lesions. The objective enhancement
   rate, the mean value between lesion-to-white matter ratio and
   lesion-to-gray matter ratio, although representing an overlap of T1 and
   T2 effects and not pure contrast medium shortening of T1 relaxation, was
   better in contrast-enhanced FLAIR images. These results suggest a
   superiority of contrast-enhanced FLAIR images as compared with
   contrast-enhanced SE T1WI in detecting enhancing brain lesions.},

Abstract = {The study investigated the effects of prolonged oral administration of
   dexamethasone at a low daily dosage of 0.75 mg/head per day (Dexa) on
   beef cattle productive traits, behaviour and meat quality. In all, 14
   finishing Marchigiana bulls were used in a trial that begun 56 days
   prior to slaughter, of which six bulls received treatment from day 5 to
   day 53, whereas the remaining animals were used for Control. The animals
   treated showed an increased average daily gain (1515 v. 1177g/head per
   day; P < 0.05; s.e.d. = 48.54) and improved warm carcass dressing
   percentage (60.8\% v. 59.7\%; P < 0.05; s.e.d. = 0.32). Behavioural
   observation did not permit a clear distinction between treated and
   Control animals since feeding and social behaviour were similar in both
   groups. The bulls treated spent less time lying (16.5\% v. 34.6\%; P <
   0.05; s.e.d. = 4.38) and grooming (6.7\% v. 11.9\%; P < 0.05; s.e.d. =
   1.23), and this may indicate poorer welfare. No evidence of treatment
   was observed in other carcass traits, and redness was the only meat
   quality parameter slightly affected by corticosteroid administration.},

Abstract = {Anthrax Euronet, a Coordination Action of the EU 6th Framework
   Programme, was designed to strengthen networking activities between
   anthrax research groups in Europe and to harmonise protocols for testing
   anthrax vaccines and therapeutics. Inevitably, the project also
   addressed aspects of the current political issues of biosecurity and
   dual-use research, i.e. research into agents of important diseases of
   man, livestock or agriculture that could be used as agents of
   bioterrorism. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the
   biology of Bacillus anthracis, of the pathogenesis, epidemiology and
   diagnosis of anthrax, as well as vaccine and therapeutic intervention
   strategies. The proposed requirement for a code of conduct for working
   with dual-use agents such as the anthrax bacillus is also discussed. (C)

Abstract = {The potential of some natural compounds (thymol, vetiver essential oil,
   lysozyme, resveratrol) for the control of nosema infection in honeybees
   was evaluated. A first trial aimed at screening substances, in candy
   preparations, on the basis of their toxicity to honeybees and bees'
   dietary preferences. None of the tested substances showed an increased
   bee mortality or decreased bee preference, and were therefore considered
   suitable for further testing. In the second trial the effects of the
   natural compounds on nosema diseased honeybees were evaluated: bees were
   individually dosed with nosema spores and fed candies prepared with the
   screened substances. The results showed that bees fed with thymol and
   resveratrol candies had significantly lower infection rates, and bees
   supplied with resveratrol prepared candy also lived significantly
   longer. We suggest that thymol and resveratrol could be useful in
   alternative strategies for the control of nosema disease.},

Abstract = {A set of hormonal, haematological and biochemical parameters was used to
   evaluate the physiological response and welfare status of 14 finishing
   Marchigiana bulls treated for 49 days with a low daily dosage (0.75
   mg/head per day) of dexamethasone per os. Compared to the Control group,
   dexamethasone decreased cortisol concentrations (42.3 v. 5.7nmol/l;
   s.e.d. = 4.17; P < 0.001), and led to the reversal of the leukocyte
   formula in the animals treated (P < 0.05). Total serum proteins (70.2 v.
   73.9 g/l; s.e.d. = 1.55; P < 0.05), in particular beta(1) globulins (7.5
   v. 9.1 g/l; s.ed. = 0.24; P < 0.01) and fibrinogen (199 v. 258 mg/dl;
   s.e.d. = 32.70, P < 0.05), increased as a consequence of treatment.
   Prolonged dexamethasone administration led the bulls to an apparently
   chronic stress condition. Moreover, the study indicated various blood
   parameters that might be used by health officials as effective tools in
   identifying beef cattle suspected of being illegally treated with
   dexamethasone.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of two diets with
   different protein/fat ratios (P/F) (diet A: P/F 2.26; diet B: P/F 3.36)
   on the chemical composition, fatty acid profile and some somatic indexes
   of meagre (Argyrosomus regius). The trial was carried out on two groups
   of meagre raised in two different sea cages during 15 months. At the end
   of the production cycle biometric measures as well as
   chemical-nutritional analysis of the fillets were conducted on 25 fishes
   per group. Diet A, with a lower P/F, furnished animals with higher
   percentages of mesenteric fat (0.48 vs 0.41\%; P<0.01) and of fillet
   yield (51.21 vs 48.12; P<0.01). Moreover, the fillets obtained with the
   diet A showed higher percentage of fat (3.60 vs 2.41\%; P< 0.01), lower
   moisture (74.10 vs 75.42\%; P<0.01), lower losses of water under
   pressure (16.73 vs 20.20\%; P<0.01) and after 48 h of refrigeration
   (3.08 vs 4.23\%; P<0.01). The fatty acids profile of fillets was
   affected by the diet. Diet A resulted in a higher level of saturated
   fatty acids (26.44 vs 23.17\% of total lipid; P<0.01) and a lower
   percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids (31.56 vs 36.08\%; P<0.01) in
   the fillet, mainly due to the lower content of linoleic acid (13.63 vs
   19.77\%; P<0.01). The atherogenic (AI) and thrombogenic (TI) indexes,
   which resulted very low in the fish of Group B (AI=0.48 vs 0.60, P<0.01;
   TI=0.33 vs 0.37, P<0.01), together with the low lipid content of meat in
   both groups, confirmed the very high nutritional quality of meagre
   fillets.},

   reached, because <50\% of dogs died of disease-related events. Mean DFI
   and mean survival time were 697.8 days (95\% CI: 559.7-836 days) and
   703.5 days (95\% CI: 566.6-840.5 days), respectively. There were no
   significant differences among survival functions stratified by
   histologic margins.
   Conclusion-Marginal surgical excision without adjuvant treatment of
   low-grade soft tissue spindle cell sarcoma of the extremities results in
   a low local recurrence rate.
   Clinical Relevance-Low-grade spindle cell sarcomas located at or distal
   to the elbow and stifle joints can be excised without need for wide or
   radical surgery. (C) Copyright 2008 by The American College of

Abstract = {A total of 232 stools collected from calves with rotavirus infection in
   herds located in northern Italy from 2003 to 2005 was investigated.
   Determination of the rotavirus G and P types was carried out using
   nested RT PCR. G6 was the most prevalent genotype, accounting for 78.5\%
   of samples, G10 accounted for 9.9\% of samples and viruses of G8 type
   were found in 4.7\% of samples. In 3\% of samples, viruses were not
   classified due to concomitant infection with more G type strains,
   whereas viruses in 3.9\% of samples could not be characterized with any
   of the G-specific primers used in this study. Most common P types were
   P{[}11] and P{[}5], accounting for 65.1\% and 25\%, respectively. In
   2.6\% of cases, samples reacted with multiple P-specific primers; no
   P{[}1] serotype was identified. The G6P{[}11] combination was
   predominant throughout the study period, i.e. 52.5\% in 2003, 50\% in
   2004 and 40\% in 2005. The incidence of G6P{[}5] increased from 13.1\%
   in 2003 to 27\% in 2004 and 25.5\% in 2005. The G10P{[}11] combination
   decreased markedly from 18\% in 2003 to 2.6\% in 2004, rising again to
   7.3\% in 2005. G8P{[}11] viruses were similarly present in 2003 (5\%)
   and 2004 (4.3\%), declining slightly in 2005 (1.8\%). (C) 2007 Elsevier

Volume = {85},

Abstract = {Several countries within the European Union (EU) have successfully
   eradicated Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR), while others (e.g.
   Germany) are making efforts to achieve IBR-free status. EU member states
   IBR eradication programmes must meet Community legislation requirements
   that ban breeding farms from purchasing positive animals, from using
   whole-virus IBR vaccines, and from inseminating cows with semen from
   positive bulls. A follow-up study from 2002 to 2005 was carried out in
   the province of Trento (Italy), where a compulsory programme for IBR
   eradication was started in 1998. IBR outbreaks (identified on the basis
   of seroconversion of sentinel animals) were concentrated in larger
   positive herds. A higher incidence was recorded between 2003 and 2004.
   An association between markedly high temperatures in the summer of 2003
   and virus reactivation has been suggested but is yet to be confirmed.
   The practice of driving cattle to common alpine pastures for the summer
   season did not play a significant epidemiological role in IBR
   transmission. Premising that only seronegative animals are allowed to
   enter dairy farms, animal movement increases the infection risk to a
   moderate extent. The long-term persistence of IBR antibodies was more
   pronounced in animals positive for antibodies to the glycoprotein E
   (gE). Scattered seroconversions, occurring mostly in positive herds,
   require careful interpretation in order to avoid overestimating the
   incidence of the infection at herd level. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {A fast, simple and very selective liquid chromatography-mass
   spectrometry (LC-MS) method for the detection of isopropylthioxanthone

   of an ITX-d(3) as internal standard and a simple extraction from the
   sample with acetonitrile, the extract was centrifuged and directly
   injected into the LC-MS system. Chromatographic separation was achieved
   by means of a Gemini C18 column (100 mm x 2.0 mm i.d. 5 mu m) using a
   gradient of aqueous 20 mM ammonium formiate at pH 4.5 and methanol as
   the mobile phase, at a flow rate of 0.25 mL min(-1). The method was
   validated according to the guidelines laid down by the Commission
   Decision 2002/657/EC using the parent ion {[}M+H](+) (m/z 255) as
   quantification ion, and the fragment ion (m/z 213) obtained by in-source
   collision-induced dissociation (IS-CID) as confirmation ion. Absolute
   and relative recoveries rates were verified at 5, 10, 15 mu g kg(-1) in
   yoghurt samples and at 5 mu g kg(-1) in milk and pudding: mean absolute
   recoveries were 77\% in yoghurt, 50\% in pudding and 67\% in milk;
   relative recoveries (after internal standard correction) were always
   >97\% in each matrix. The detection limit (CC alpha) and the detection

Abstract = {Aims: To determine the variability of the prion protein gene (PRNP) in
   goats from Northern and Southern Italy.
   Methods and results: Genomic DNA isolated from goat blood was polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR)-amplified for the coding region of the PRNP gene
   and then sequenced. In total, 13 polymorphic sites were identified:
   G37V, T110P, G127S, M137I, I142M, I142T, H143R, R154H, P168Q, T194P,
   R211Q, Q222K and S240P (substitutions I142T and T194P are novel) giving
   rise to 14 haplotypes. Clear frequency differences between Northern and
   Southern breeds were found and confirmed by genetic distance analysis.
   Conclusions: Differences in allele distribution were found between
   Northern and Southern goats, in particular regarding the M142 and K222
   alleles, possibly associated to scrapie resistance; philogeographical
   analysis supported the idea that Northern and Southern breeds may be
   considered as separate clusters.
   Significance and impact of the study: In Italy only limited studies have
   been carried out on caprine PRNP genotype distribution; this study is
   important to fill this lack of information. Moreover the finding of
   significant differences among allele distributions in Northern and
   Southern goats, especially if involved in modulating
   resistance/susceptibility, need to be carefully considered for the
   feasibility of selection plans for resistance to scrapie.},

Abstract = {Anaplasma spp. (Rickettsiales: Anaplasmataceae) are tick-borne pathogens
   of veterinary and human importance. The wildlife hosts for these
   pathogens are not well characterized and may play an important role in
   the epidemiology of the disease. The objective of this research was to
   study the infection with A. marginale, A. ovis and A. phagocytophilum in
   free-ranging European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) from Cadiz,
   Andalucia, Spain. Of 17 roe deer tested, 14 (82\%) and 5 (29\%) had
   antibodies reactive to Anaplasma spp. and A. phagocytophilum by
   competitive ELISA and indirect immunofluorescent antibody testing,
   respectively. Polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis of
   Anaplasma major surface protein 4 (msp4) gene was conducted on blood
   samples from all roe deer examined. Nine (53\%) animals had evidence of
   infection with A. ovis and 3 (18\%) were positive for A.
   phagocytophilum. Concurrent infections were not detected. Despite the
   presence of A. marginale infections in cattle in the study site (36\%
   msp4 PCR-positive animals), none of the msp4 amplicons from roe deer
   corresponded to A. marginale sequences. A. ovis msp4 sequences were
   identical to a genotype previously identified in sheep in Sicily, Italy.
   Two different A. phagocytophilum genotypes were identified in infected
   roe deer. This is the first report of roe deer naturally infected with
   A. ovis. These results demonstrate that roe deer are infected with A.
   ovis and A. phagocytophilum in Spain and suggest that this species may
   be involved in the natural cycle of these pathogens in this region, thus
   acting as potential reservoir for transmission to domestic and wild
   animals. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Bovine alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein (bAAG) and bovine serum albumin (BSA)
   are plasmatic acceptors working as carriers by the specific and
   reversible binding of several drugs in vivo. We synthesized affinity
   columns by coupling bAAG and BSA to an activated chromatographic support
   through their carbohydrate moieties, to preserve protein tertiary
   structure and, consequently, to improve the biological activity in
   vitro. The bAAG and BSA affinity columns were used to study the binding
   of acidic and basic drugs. Moreover, a purification strategy was
   developed for the cleanup of drug residues from biological matrices and
   foods, prior to screening and/or confirmatory analysis, on the basis of
   the specific molecular recognition between the protein and the drug. The
   aim of this work was to test the potency of bAAG- and BSA-based affinity
   chromatography to bind some veterinary drugs and purify them in the
   context of the official control of animal products. The efficiency of
   these homemade affinity columns in minimising matrix interference and in
   selective cleanup of different classes of substances was reported and
   discussed.},

Title = {Multilocus sequence typing of IncI1 plasmids carrying extended-spectrum

   origin},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objectives: Plasmids belonging to incompatibility group I1 (IncI1) are
   widespread in Enterobacteriaceae and are characterized by the presence
   of a cluster of genes encoding the type IV pili, contributing to the
   virulence of Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli. Recently, IncI1 plasmids
   were identified in E. coli and Salmonella strains of animal origin as
   responsible for the dissemination of beta-lactamase genes. Plasmid
   multilocus sequence typing (pMLST) was developed to discern naturally
   occurring IncI1 plasmids in homogeneous groups according to their allele
   assortment.
   Methods: pMLST was developed by selecting multiple target genes on the
   available complete IncI1 plasmid DNA sequences. Sixteen plasmids, all
   assigned to the IncI1 group by the PCR-based replicon typing method,
   were included in this study. They were analysed for beta-lactamase genes
   and typed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and pMLST.
   Results: Sixteen plasmids identified in E. coli and Salmonella isolated
   from animals and humans in different countries carried bla(CMY-2),
   bla(CTX-M-15), bla(CTX-M-1), bla(CTX-M-14), bla(TEM-52), bla(SHV-12) or
   bla(TEM-1) beta-lactamase genes. These plasmids were classified by RFLP
   in nine different groups corresponding to the nine sequence types
   determined by pMLST.
   Conclusions: The pMLST method was suitable for rapid and easy subtyping
   of IncI1 plasmids. This study demonstrates that the pMLST method can
   contribute to the epidemiological description of circulation of specific
   resistance plasmids among beta-lactamase producers isolated from animals
   and humans.},

Title = {Adjuvant gemcitabine after surgical removal of aggressive malignant

Abstract = {Canine mammary tumours are generally treated with surgery alone, despite
   the fact that 50\% of them are malignant and many will eventually lead
   to recurrence or metastases. A prospective clinical trial in which dogs
   with aggressive mammary carcinoma of clinical stages IV and V were
   treated with surgical excision (n = 9) or with surgery and adjuvant
   weekly gemcitabine (n = 10) for at least four cycles was conducted.
   Gemcitabine was given as an intravenous infusion at the dose of 800 mg
   m(-2). Aim of the study was to explore potential beneficial effects of
   gemcitabine on time to local recurrence (TTR), time to distant
   metastases (TTM) and overall survival (OS) in canine patients with
   operated mammary tumours bearing high risk for locoregional failure and
   distant metastases. Also, factors associated with OS, including
   neutering status, body weight, age, clinical stage at presentation,
   tumour size, histological grade and, in dogs receiving chemotherapy, the
   number of gemcitabine treatments, were investigated. Finally, acute
   toxicities related to chemotherapy and quality of life were assessed in
   dogs receiving gemcitabine. Dogs treated with surgery alone or surgery
   followed by gemcitabine had no difference in TTR, TTM or OS (P > 0.05).
   In the group of dogs receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, the number of
   gemcitabine treatments was positively correlated with OS (P = 0.017).
   Gemcitabine treatment was well tolerated, with no dogs experiencing
   clinically relevant haematological or gastrointestinal toxicity. Despite
   being safe at the present dose, gemcitabine chemotherapy as an adjunct
   treatment to surgical excision may not be recommended in dogs with
   aggressive mammary carcinoma.},

Abstract = {Whether animals may act as reservoirs for human caliciviruses is
   unclear. By sequence analysis of a short fragment of the RNA-dependent
   RNA polymerase (RdRp) region, porcine sapovirus (SaV) strains that
   genetically resemble human SaVs have been detected in piglets, but
   more-informative sequences (capsid gene) were not available for a
   precise characterization. In this study, the 3' terminus (the 3' end of
   open reading frame 1 {[}ORF1], including the polymerase complex and the
   complete capsid; ORF2; and the 3' untranslated region) of one such human
   SaV-like strain, 43/06-18p3/2006/It, was determined, revealing that
   these viruses are more related genetically to human (47.4 to 54.9\%
   amino acid identity) than to animal (35.2 to 44.7\% amino acid identity)
   SaVs in the capsid gene. In addition, the recombination-prone
   RdRp-capsid junction region was highly conserved with those of human
   SaVs of genogroup GI. The presence of porcine viruses similar to human
   SaVs is a significant finding because of the potential for zoonotic
   infections or generation of porcine/human recombinants.},

Abstract = {An 8-month-old white feathered, black skinned Moroseta hen was presented
   for examination because of numerous 2 mm- to 30 mm-diameter irregularly
   shaped, hard nodules in the skin of the head, wings, back, and abdomen.
   The nodules were confined to the skin and did not involve subcutaneous
   tissues. Nodules consisted of dilated feather follicles packed with a
   caseous tan-to-pale-yellow material admixed with feather remnants.
   Histologically, affected feather follicles were markedly dilated and
   filled with laminated keratin debris. Necrosis of the epidermis and
   perifollicular lymphocyte infiltration was also present. Bacteriologic
   investigation of internal organs was negative, while secondary bacteria,
   Proteus spp. and Bacillus spp., were isolated from skin nodules. A
   concomitant lice infestation of Menopon spp., as well as leg mange
   caused by Cnemidocoptes spp., were also present. These bacterial
   isolates and parasites were not related to the disease condition. The
   condition observed was differentiated from benign feather follicle
   tumors, and a diagnosis of multiple feather follicle cysts was made. In
   addition, a breed predisposition was hypothesized.},

   (57.3\%); no fertile cysts were found. Most of the cysts had sizes <3 cm
   (77. 1 \%) and were unilocular (78.8\%). The results of the linear
   regression model did not show any significant correlation between the
   age of infected cattle and the number of cysts. The sequencing of the
   mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) gene of 40 hydatid
   cysts produced sequences of 419 bp for each sample analyzed. Alignment
   of the obtained sequences with those present in GenBank showed 100\%
   identity with the common sheep G1 (n=21 cysts), the Tasmanian sheep G2
   (n = 2 cysts), and the buffalo G3 (n=17 cysts) strains, which constitute
   the species Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto. The findings reported
   in the present study show that CE is widespread in cattle bred in the
   Campania region of southern Italy However, the absence of fertile cysts
   and of the cattle strain (G5, E. ortleppi) suggests that cattle would
   not have any role in the persistence of this important zoonosis but
   rather a role as indicators of CE infection in this endemic area.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present paper was to continue the study on the presence
   of parasitic elements in the canine faeces contaminating the urban
   environment of Naples (southern Italy), focussing on the protozoa
   Giardia and Cryptosporidium. The total number of sub-areas studied was
   143, and the total number of canine faecal samples collected and
   examined was 415. Each faecal sample was tested for the presence of
   copro-antigens of Giardia and Cryptosporidium using two commercially
   available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Giardia antigens were
   found in 19.6\% (28/143) of the sub-areas and in 7.7\% (32/415) of the
   canine faeces collected. Cryptosporidium antigens were found in 4.2\%
   (6/143) of the sub-areas and in 1.7\% (7/415) of the canine faeces
   collected. Co-infection was not found in any sample. The results of the
   logistic regression models did not show any association between the
   positivity to Giardia or Cryptosporidium and the independent demographic
   variables (human population density, male and female population density)
   taken into consideration. In conclusion, the findings of the present
   study revealed the presence of Giardia and Cryptosporidium in canine
   faecal samples from the urban environment of Naples; however, the
   zoonotic potential of these findings was not assessed due to the lack of
   information on species/genotypes detected. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Bovine tuberculosis diagnosis: accuracy of histopathological examination
   and histochemical and immunohistochemical techniques in framework of
   eradication planes},
Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {As a result of bovine tuberculosis eradication plans in Europe and
   Italy, advanced stages of the infection are less often reported at
   abattoir post mortem inspection, whereas early stages of bovine
   tuberculosis mainly represented by primary complexes are most commonly
   observed.
   Rapid diagnosis and identification of these lesions are pivotal. In this
   frame the contribution of histopatological examination is helpful, but
   it is necessary to evaluate its sensibility and specificity.
   This study evaluated the accuracy of histopathological examination by
   hematoxylin and eosin (HE), ZN and Auramine-Rodamine staining and
   immunohistochemistry using polyclonal anti-Mycobacterium bovis antibody.
   For this purpose we analysed samples of 173 bovine lymph nodes belonging
   to cattle displaying Suspected lesions at abattoir post-mortem
   inspection and with known result at mycobacterial culture.
   Histopathology sensitivity resulted 97.5\% when the inconclusive lesion
   were considered as negative, and 93.4\% when were reviewed as positive.
   The ZN staining was less sensitive, (33.9\%) but high specific too
   (100\%), while IHC and Auramine-Rodamine staining showed sensitivity and
   specificity respectively of 67.3\% and 94.6\% and 44.23\% and 97.30\%.
   The results suggest that histopathological examination is a reliable
   tool for rapid diagnosis Of tuberculosis from suspected tubercular
   lesions and its differentiation from other causes, whereas histochemical
   and immunohistochemical staining are not useful in eradication plans.},

Abstract = {Canine monocytic ehrlichiosis (CME) caused by Ehrlichia canis is the
   most known canine tick-borne disease (TBD) spread throughout the world.
   Preventing tick bites is a priority to reduce the risk of TBDs and it
   was the aim of the present study to evaluate the efficacy of a
   combination of imidacloprid 10\% and permethrin 50\% (ImPer) (Advantix
   (R); Bayer AG, Germany) in a spot-on formulation to control CME under
   field conditions. On January-March 2005, 845 dogs from two kennels in
   southern Italy (kennels of Bari (KB)- and Ginosa (KG)), with a history
   of tick infestation were initially tested by serology and PCR assay for
   E. canis infection. Data on Leishmania infantum infection were also
   available from a previous study carried out on the same dog population.
   One hundred twenty-six dogs (14.9\%) presented anti-E. canis antibodies
   with a relative prevalence of 15.6\% (n = 65 dogs in KB) and 14.2\% (n =
   61 dogs in KG). Five hundred thirty-five animals found negative both for
   E. canis and L infantum infections were enrolled in three groups (Group
   A-treated with ImPer once a month; Group B-treated every 2 weeks; and
   Group C-untreated control animals) and monitored for E. canis infection
   by serology and PCR in November 2005 (first follow-up) and in March 2006
   (second follow-up). The E. canis infection was serologically revealed,
   at the first and/or second follow-up, in 26 animals from Group C in KB
   and KG (mean incidence density rate (IDR), 13.24\%) while in none of the
   animals from Group A (KB and KG) and only in one animal from Group B
   (IDR 1.13\%) in KG. The final protection efficacy of ImPer ranged from
   95.57\% to 100\% in Groups B and A. At PCR only 15 dogs from KG were
   positive for Rickettsiales only at the first follow-up and at the
   sequence analysis two (both in Group Q revealed 100\% homology with E.
   canis sequences while 13 with Anaplasma platys. Four out of 13A. platys
   PCR-positive dogs were also seropositive for E. canis at one or both
   follow-ups. ImPer, by virtue of its repellent and acaricidal activity
   against ticks, has been shown to be efficacious to prevent E. canis
   infection in treated dogs living under natural conditions in endemic
   areas. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Six tests for detection of antibodies against the non-structural
   proteins of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) were compared at an
   international workshop in Brescia, Italy in 2004 on the basis of
   dichotomous test results. However, as results from all of these assays
   were also available on a continuous scale, validation was extended by
   calculating and subsequently analysing the receiver-operator
   characteristic (ROC) curves and likelihood ratios (LR) for each test
   method. For the purposes of these analyses, test results for a total of
   1337 sera were selected from the Brescia workshop dataset, 237 sera that
   had been obtained from cattle exposed to FMDV and 1100 sera obtained
   from cattle that were not exposed to the virus; ``non-sera from
   ``exposed{''} cattle were considered to be ``true positives{''} and sera
   from ``exposed{''} cattle were considered to be ``true negatives{''}.
   Analysis of ROC curves showed that at specificities of both 99 and
   99.5\%, the IZS-Brescia and the Ceditest ELISA had significantly better
   detection rates in exposed cattle than the other ELISAs. The ROC
   analysis confirms the previous finding that the IZS-Brescia and the
   Ceditest ELISAs have both better detection rates in exposed cattle
   combined with a high specificity. The analysis of likelihood ratios
   provides informationthat may be very useful in the interpretation of
   test results, and a working example is presented to show how these
   likelihood ratios might be used in an objective approach to deciding the
   true infection status of surveyed populations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {The intracellular distribution of swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV)
   proteins and the induced reorganization of endomembranes in IBRS-2 cells
   were analyzed. Fluorescence to new SVDV capsids appeared first upon
   infection, concentrated in perinuclear circular structures and
   colocalized to dsRNA. As in foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV)-infected
   cells, a vesicular pattern was predominantly found in later stages of
   SVDV capsid morphogenesis that colocalized with those of non-structural
   proteins 2C, 2BC and 3A. These results suggest that assembly of capsid
   proteins is associated to the replication complex. Confocal microscopy
   showed a decreased fluorescence to ER markers (calreticulin and protein
   disulfide isomerase), and disorganization of cis-Golgi gp74 and
   trans-Golgi caveolin-1 markers in SVDV- and FMDV-, but not in vesicular
   stomatitis virus (VSV)-infected cells. Electron microscopy of
   SVDV-infected cells at an early stage of infection revealed fragmented
   ER cisternae with expanded lumen and accumulation of large Golgi
   vesicles, suggesting alterations of vesicle traffic through Golgi
   compartments. At this early stage, FMDV induced different patterns of ER
   fragmentation and Golgi alterations. At later stages of SVDV
   cytopathology, cells showed a completely vacuolated cytoplasm containing
   vesicles of different sizes. Cell treatment with brefeldin A, which
   disrupts the Golgi complex, reduced SVDV (similar to 5 log) and VSV
   (similar to 4 log) titers, but did not affect FMDV growth. Thus, three
   viruses, which share target tissues and clinical signs in natural hosts,
   induce different intracellular effects in cultured cells. (c) 2008

Abstract = {Aelurostrongylus abstrusus (Nematoda, Strongylida) in cats and
   associated risk factors have been investigated by classical coprology in
   central (site A) and southern (site B) Italy, i.e. by floatations with
   sugar and zinc sulphate solutions and a Baermann technique. Overall, 227
   individual stool samples (i.e. 162 from site A and 65 from site B) were
   processed and risk factors were related to infection by binary logistic
   multiple-regression models. The presence of A. abstrusus was used as the
   dependent variable and the epidemiological data as independent
   variables. Twenty-eight (17.3\%) and 12 (18.5\%) cats were positive for
   A. abstrusus in sites A and 13, respectively, both using the Baermann
   and flotation with zinc sulphate solution methods. Six and three (from
   site A and B, respectively) of the infected cats were negative for A.
   abstrusus when faeces were processed with sugar solution. Stray and
   free-ranging (P = 0.357), young cats (P = 0.008) and the presence of
   respiratory symptoms (P = 0.000) were risk factors for A. abstrusus
   infection. The results suggest that A. abstrusus is spread in Italy.
   Furthermore, these results possibly include infection in the
   differential diagnosis of feline respiratory diseases and offer a
   correct diagnostic approach by using either a Baermann method or
   flotation with zinc sulphate solution in suspected cases. (c) 2008

Abstract = {Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs) have been produced
   and used as a potent and versatile contrast media for magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI). Despite a number of efforts to improve their surface
   chemistry and biocompatibility, the SPIOs half life in blood circulation
   is very short and they are rapidly taken up by the reticuloendothelial
   system (RES). In this paper we describe a new method that permits to
   avoid the rapid clearance of SPIOs. Nanoparticles are made biocompatible
   by encapsulation into autologous red blood cells. These biomimetic
   constructs preserve the main properties of the cells that escape RES
   clearance as well as the properties of the nanoparticles that perform
   even better than in blood suspension with reduced T(2){*}. These
   SPIO-loaded RBCs are promising intravascular imaging contrast agents and
   could also be addressed to selected body compartments by an external
   magnetic field.},

Abstract = {Malassezia pachydermatis isolates (n=185) from skin sites from dogs
   (n=30) were characterized genetically and biochemically following in
   vitro culture. Two regions in the chitin synthase-2 gene (chs-2) and the
   first internal transcribed spacer (ITS-1) of nuclear ribosomal DNA were
   sequenced, and the phospholipase activity of each isolate was assessed.
   Three chs-2 (i.e. A(c), B-c and C-c) and eight ITS-1 (i.e. A(I1), A(I2),
   A(I3), A(I4), B-I1, C-I1, C-I2 and C-I3) sequence types were defined for
   all 185 samples. The findings revealed that multiple M. pachydermatis
   genotypes/subgenotypes could be cultured from healthy dogs or from dogs
   with single or multiple, generalized skin lesions. Subgenotypes A(I1)
   and B-I1 were associated with all skin sites of dogs sampled, whereas
   subgenotype C-I2 was mostly linked to a particular location. Isolates
   derived from skin lesions showed a significantly higher phospholipase
   activity compared with those from skin sites with no detectable lesions.
   Genotype B was mainly cultured from healthy skin; only four isolates
   (9.3\%) had low phospholipase activity, whereas other
   genotypes/subgenotypes were predominantly associated with skin lesions
   and had a high phospholipase activity. The results of the present study
   suggest that the distribution pattern of particular genotypes or
   subgenotypes of M. pachydermatis on the skin of dogs relates to the
   affinity of the yeast to the host and to particular skin sites.},

Abstract = {While vgf gene knockout mice are hyperactive and hypermetabolic,
   surprisingly the TLQP-21 brain VGF peptide increased energy consumption,
   Suggesting that opposing regulatory effects could be exerted by peptides
   alternatively cleaved from the VGF precursor. Using antisera to the VGF
   precursor C-terminus and three cleavage products, we revealed a distinct
   differential distribution in adrenal, certain peptides (VGF(422-430):
   PGH peptides) being found throughout bovine and swine medulla, while
   C-terminus and TLQP peptides were confined to adrenaline cells in the
   above species and in rat and C-terminally shortened forms (VGF(604-612):
   HVLL peptides) to nor-adrenaline cells. Random abattoir samples of
   bovine and swine adrenal contained 520 +/- 40 and 450 +/- 60 pmol/g
   (mean +/- S.E.M. respectively) of C-terminus peptides and similar or
   lower amounts of others. Upon gel chromatography, bona fide VGF
   precursor, similar to 7.5 and similar to 3.5 kDa forms were revealed by
   C-terminus assays, HVLL peptides being limited to small fragments. TLQP
   peptides included similar to 7.5 kDa form and peaks accounting for
   TLQP-21 and predicted TLQP-30 and TLQP-42. Low molecular weight (MW) PGH
   peptides were revealed, together with a high MW form possibly
   encompassing the VGF precursor N-terminus. In acutely stressed swine, a
   striking increase was seen for C-terminus and TLQP peptides, with no
   significant differences for PGH peptides. A similar response was found
   in rat TLQP peptides showing a major increase upon an acute swimming
   stress and 30 min thereafter. A differential processing of the VGF
   precursor encompassing many areas of its primary sequence and selective
   modulations of its derived peptides occur in adrenal medullary cells,
   possibly relevant to adaptive homeostatic responses.},

Journal = {PLOS PATHOGENS},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The disease phenotype of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and the
   molecular/biological properties of its prion strain, including the host
   range and the characteristics of BSE-related disorders, have been
   extensively studied since its discovery in 1986. In recent years,
   systematic testing of the brains of cattle coming to slaughter resulted
   in the identification of at least two atypical forms of BSE. These
   emerging disorders are characterized by novel conformers of the bovine
   pathological prion protein (PrPTSE), named high-type (BSE-H) and
   low-type (BSE-L). We recently reported two Italian atypical cases with a
   PrPTSE type identical to BSE-L, pathologically characterized by PrP
   amyloid plaques and known as bovine amyloidotic spongiform
   encephalopathy (BASE). Several lines of evidence suggest that BASE is
   highly virulent and easily transmissible to a wide host range.
   Experimental transmission to transgenic mice overexpressing bovine PrP
   (Tgbov XV) suggested that BASE is caused by a prion strain distinct from
   the BSE isolate. In the present study, we experimentally infected
   Friesian and Alpine brown cattle with Italian BSE and BASE isolates via
   the intracerebral route. BASE-infected cattle developed amyotrophic
   changes accompanied by mental dullness. The molecular and
   neuropathological profiles, including PrP deposition pattern, closely
   matched those observed in the original cases. This study provides clear
   evidence of BASE as a distinct prion isolate and discloses a novel
   disease phenotype in cattle.},

Abstract = {A longitudinal study of Salmonella enterica infection was carried out in
   five Italian farrow-to-finish swine herds previously known to be
   infected by Salmonella. Five litters were randomly selected from each
   herd and in each litter six piglets were randomly selected and
   individually identified. Thus, the study included 30 pigs from each
   farm. At weaning, individual blood samples were collected for
   serological examination from all selected piglets and on the same day
   from all sows in the farrowing unit. Piglets were bled again at
   approximately 60, 90, 150, 210 and 270 days of life whereas the last
   blood sample was collected at slaughtering. In one of the herds, in
   which the duration of productive cycle was about 12 months, the last
   blood samples were collected at 350 days of life. With the same time
   scheduling, five pen pooled faecal samples were collected from each herd
   for bacteriological examination. At slaughtering, mesenteric lymph nodes
   were collected from each ear-tagged pig. Sero-prevalence (cut off S/P
   ratio 0.25) in sows varied from 93.8\% to 100\%. In four herds,
   sero-prevalence in piglets showed a similar profile with complete
   decline of maternal antibodies at day 60 and clear sero-conversion
   between day 90 and day 150. In one herd, sero-conversion was observed
   earlier and 56\% of piglets were positive at day 90. The peak of
   scro-prevalence was observed between day 210 and day 270.
   Sero-prevalence at slaughtering varied from 66\% to 100\%. Salmonella
   was isolated from faecal samples in four of five herds. No Salmonella
   was isolated from mesenteric lymph nodes at slaughter in two of the
   herds. Culture prevalence from mesenteric lymph nodes in the other three
   herds ranged from 3.3\% to 30\%. This longitudinal study provides
   original information about epidemiological dynamics of Salmonella
   enterica infection in Italian swine herds in consideration of the unique
   extended fattening period typical of the Italian production.},

Abstract = {Among the different hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes of avian influenza (AI)
   viruses, H5, H7, and H9 are of major interest because of the serious
   consequences for the poultry industry and the increasing frequency of
   direct transmission of these viruses to humans. The availability of new
   tools to rapidly detect and subtype the influenza viruses can enable the
   immediate application of measures to prevent the widespread transmission
   of the infection. In this study, a novel one-step real-time reverse
   transcription-PCR (RRT-PCR) was developed to detect simultaneously the
   H5, H7, and H9 subtypes of AI viruses from clinical samples of avian
   origin. The sensitivity of the RRT-PCR assay was determined by using in
   vitro-transcribed RNA and 10-fold serial dilutions of titrated AI
   viruses. High sensitivity levels were obtained, with limits of detection
   ranging from 10(1) to 10(3) RNA copies and from 10(1) 50\% egg
   infectious dose (EID50)/100 mu l to 10(2.74) EID50/100 mu l with
   titrated viruses. Excellent results were achieved in the intra- and
   interassay variability tests. The comparison of the results with those
   obtained from the analysis of 725 avian samples by means of the
   reference method (virus isolation {[}VI]) showed a high level of
   agreement. To date, this is the first real-time PCR protocol available
   for the simultaneous detection of AI viruses belonging to subtypes H5,
   H7, and 119, and the results obtained indicate that this method is
   suitable as a routine laboratory test for the rapid detection and
   differentiation of the three most-important AI virus subtypes in samples
   of avian origin.},

Abstract = {Salmonella strains isolated from poultry and poultry products over the
   period 2005-2006 have been investigated in order to ascertain the
   presence of extended spectrum cephalosporins (ESC) resistance. Twelve
   (ESC)-resistant isolates (n = 1 S. Enteritidis, n = 1 S. Braenderup and
   n = 10 S. Livingstone) were characterized as SHV-12-positive. The
   multi-drug resistant S. Livingstone SHV-12-producing isolates,
   untypeable by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), showed a clonal
   relationship by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. The
   SHV-12 beta-lactamase is reported for the first time in Salmonella
   enterica strains isolated from poultry in Italy. The results suggest
   poultry as a source of Salmonella carrying extended spectrum
   beta-lactamases (ESBLs) genes and highlights the need of monitoring
   animal productions to prevent spreading of (ESC)-resistant strains. (C)

Abstract = {A cross-sectional telephone survey of randomly selected households
   examined the extent and types of problems associated with free-roaming
   dogs and cats in the Teramo province of Italy. The households were
   sampled randomly within each municipality; municipalities were combined
   into coastal, central hills and mountain regions for analysis. The
   survey was conducted in May and June of 2004 with a response rate of
   74\% (397/536). Ninety percent of respondents (N = 356) believed that
   free-roaming dogs and cats were a problem. They were most commonly
   concerned about personal safety, followed by animal welfare, public
   health and environmental sanitation. Sixty-nine percent of respondents
   (274) actually saw free-roaming dogs or cats where they live. While dogs
   were most commonly seen, cats were seen in greater numbers. Overall,
   10\% (39/297) and 5\% (21/397) of respondents cared for free-roaming
   cats and dogs, respectively. Two-thirds of the respondents (251/397)
   believed that animals were abandoned because the owners lost interest.
   About 2/3 of respondents (251/397) reported that the community
   government should have the responsibility for dealing with free-roaming
   dogs and cats. The respondents supported the idea of building more
   shelters and controlling the birth rate as control measures rather than
   euthanizing dogs and cats. The results suggest that free-roaming dogs
   and cats are a very common sight in this part of Italy with substantial
   concerns by the residents. However, concerns about the animals' welfare
   were clearly raised, supporting the laws that make it illegal to
   euthanize a healthy dog or cat in Italy. Using the information from this
   study, research on the underlying causes of abandonment of dogs and cats
   or failing to sterilize them should be undertaken to begin to address
   this problem. Further, national and regional funding must be provided to
   support existing laws which should help protect and eventually decrease
   the numbers of free-roaming and homeless dogs and cats. (C) 2007

Abstract = {This paper reports the identification and characterisation of a 60 kDa
   surface protein antigen (P60) of Mycoplasma capricolum subspecies
   capricolum (Mcc), and describes its diagnostic application. Genomic
   localization and presence in P60 of conserved functional domains
   suggested a structural and functional relationship with the
   immunodominant antigen P48 of Mycoplasma agalactiae, a basic membrane
   protein. A rP60-ELISA was developed, and it resulted in a high
   specificity for Mcc infections after evaluation with 125 goat sera. The
   comparison with an existent ELISA based on whole Mcc cell lysates showed
   that the two assays have comparable sensitivities, but the rP60-ELISA
   has the significant advantage of a greater specificity. Results indicate
   that P60 is a potential marker of Mcc infection, especially useful in
   areas where the presence of M. capricolum subspecies capripenumoniae is
   also reported. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Relationships between dietary factors and milk urea nitrogen level in
   goats grazing herbaceous pasture},

Volume = {7},

Abstract = {This investigation aimed to individuate the dietary factors affecting
   the milk urea nitrogen (MUN) concentration in goats grazing herbaceous
   pasture and, particularly, to verify the relationship linking the diet
   crude protein (CP) content to MUN.
   A total of 205 individual observations regarding dietary and milk
   variables of 37 Girgentana goats involved in two experiments were used.
   Goats, averaging 154 14 days in milk and 38.1 +/- 5.4 kg of live weight,
   grazed on swards and received 500 g/d of barley meal. Sward biomass,
   herbage selected by goats and individual milk yield were measured and
   sampled weekly. The herbage intake and diet digestibility were estimated
   by the n-alkane method. Milk urea content was determined by an enzymatic
   method and transformed in MUN (MUN=urea{*}0.4665).
   The MUN concentration (9.7-35.4 mg/dl) was positively correlated with
   diet CP content (13.7-26.0\% of dry matter (DM); r=0.76; P<0.001),
   pasture allowance (39-151 kg DM/goat; r=0.42; P<0.001), diet net energy
   for lactation concentration (NEL) (1.5-1.9 Mcal/kg DM; r=0.37; P<0.001)
   and milk yield (3202250 g/d; r=0.25; P<0.001), and negatively related
   with NDF (18.7-37.4\% DM; r=-0.69; P<0.001) and diet digestibility
   (72.6-92.5\%; r=-0.33; P<0.001).
   The stepwise selection from dietary variables and milk yield showed
   dietary CP percentage to be the single variable explaining the most
   variation in MUN (R-2=0.56; P<0.0001). The other variables entering into
   the model were diet NDF, 3.5\% fat-corrected milk (FCM), DM intake and
   NDF intake (total R-2=0.66). including the CP/NEL and CP/NDF ratios of
   diet in the stepwise regression model, the CP/NDF ratio alone explained
   60.1\% of MUN variability, followed by barley proportion in the diet,
   FCM and diet CP concentration, absorbing an extra 4.6\% of MUN
   variability.
   A linear regression, fitting mean feeding treatment per time data of MUN
   and dietary CP concentration (n=28){[}CP(\% of DM)=6.91 +/- 1.42+0.61
   +/- 0.06{*}MUN (mg/dl); R-2=0.79; P<0.0001], suggests that MUN could be
   used for predicting the CP content of the diet, as a tool for developing
   feeding strategies aimed at balancing the rations of grazing goats
   through adequate supplementation. Further data from experiments on
   grazing goats in different environmental conditions are required in
   order to define a more robust relationship by which to predict the
   dietary CP content by MUN.},

Abstract = {The hard tick Ixodes ricinus (Ixodidae) is the sole animal thus far
   shown to harbour an intra-mitochondrial bacterium, which has recently
   been named Midichloria mitochondrii. The objectives of this work were
   (i) to screen ixodid ticks for Midichloria-related bacteria and (ii) to
   determine whether these bacteria exploit the intra-mitochondrial niche
   in other tick species. Our main goal was to discover further models of
   this peculiar form of symbiosis. We have thus performed a PCR screening
   for Midichloria -related bacteria in samples of ixodid ticks collected
   in Italy, North America and Iceland. A total of 7 newly examined species
   from 5 genera were found positive for bacteria closely related to M.
   mitochondrii. Samples of the tick species Rhipicephalus bursa, found
   positive in the PCR screening, were analysed with transmission electron
   microscopy, which revealed the presence of bacteria both in the
   cytoplasm and in the mitochondria of the oocytes. There is thus evidence
   that bacteria invade mitochondria in at least 2 tick species.
   Phylogenetic analysis on the bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences generated
   from positive specimens revealed that the bacteria form a monophyletic
   group within the order Rickettsiales. The phylogeny of Midichloria
   symbionts and related bacteria does not appear completely congruent with
   the phylogeny of the hosts.},

Title = {Modeling of DR CALUX (R) bioassay response to screen PCDDs, PCDFs, and

Abstract = {A recent issue in the EU legislation is the evaluation of the
   toxicologically-equivalent contribution of dioxin-like
   polychlorobiphenyls (DL-PCBs) in addition to that coming from
   polychlorodibenzodioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorodibenzofurans (PCDFs) as
   contaminants in foods for a total of 29 congeners. This fact is
   determining the need to revise analytical criteria both for confirmatory
   and screening analysis. In this work, a modeling was developed to check
   the reliability of the outcomes of the DR CALUX (R) bioassay when
   applied to farm milk samples characterized by large differences in
   congener patterns. To reproduce some field conditions where DL-PCB
   contributions up to 90\% of total WHO-TEQs (HRGC-HRMS assessment) were
   recorded in dairy products, goat milk samples from a common bulk were
   fortified at different TEQ levels with mixtures containing either PCDDs
   and PCDFs or non-ortho substituted DL-PCBs. Fortification ranged
   approximately 4.5-15 pgWHO-TEQ/g fat. Based on the results, DR CALUX (R)
   relative potency value (REP) of DL-PCB 126 was estimated 0.061 against
   the canonical WHO-TEF of 0.1. The value of 0.061 together with the other
   DR CALUX (R) REPs from the literature for the remaining 28 congeners
   were used to model DR CALUX (R) response (C-TEQs) in milk samples with
   different congener patterns. The theoretical underestimation of DR CALUX
   (R) data could. be mitigated by correcting the latter with the linear
   correlation experimentally obtained between C-TEQs and the WHO-TEQs.
   Under these conditions, the use as calibrants of reference samples with
   different analytical patterns could help those laboratories involved in
   a high throughput routine to set the most appropriate decision limits to
   optimize screening output. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces regression procedures for prediction
   of total genetic value for quantitative traits, which make use of
   phenotypic and genomic data simultaneously, are discussed from a
   theoretical perspective. It is argued that a nonparametric treatment may
   be needed for capturing the multiple and complex interactions
   potentially arising in whole-genome models, i.e., those based on
   thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. After a
   review of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces regression, it is shown that
   the statistical specification admits a standard mixed-effects linear
   model representation, with smoothing parameters treated as variance
   components. Models for capturing different forms of interaction, e.g.,
   chromosome-specific, are presented. Implementations can be carried out
   using software for likelihood-based or Bayesian inference.},

Abstract = {Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), the prion disease in cattle, was
   widely believed to be caused by only one strain, BSE-C. BSE-C causes the
   fatal prion disease named new variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease in
   humans. Two atypical BSE strains, bovine amyloidotic spongiform,
   encephalopathy (BASE, also named BSE-L) and BSE-H, have been discovered
   in several countries since 2004; their transmissibility and phenotypes
   in humans are unknown. We investigated the infectivity and human
   phenotype of BASE strains by inoculating transgenic (Tg) mice expressing
   the human prion protein with brain homogenates from two BASE
   strain-infected cattle. Sixty percent of the inoculated Tg mice became
   infected after 20 to 22 months of incubation, a transmission rate higher
   than those reported for BSE-C. A quarter of BASE strain-infected Tg
   mice, but none of the Tg mice infected with prions causing a sporadic
   human prion disease, showed the presence of pathogenic prion protein
   isoforms in the spleen, indicating that the BASE prion is intrinsically
   lymphotropic. The pathological prion protein isoforms in BASE
   strain-infected humanized Tg mouse brains are different from those from
   the original cattle BASE or sporadic human prion disease. Minimal brain
   spongiosis and long incubation times are observed for the BASE
   strain-infected Tg mice. These results suggest that in humans, the BASE
   strain is a more virulent BSE strain and likely lymphotropic.},

Abstract = {Foxes (Vulpes vulpes, n = 132) killed during the hunting seasons
   2005-2006 in Central Italy (Tuscany region) were examined in order to
   investigate the possible importance of this animal as a wild reservoir
   for zoonotic filariae. In each specimen adult worms of Dirofilaria
   immitis and hematic microfilariae were searched for. Species
   identification was performed by morphology, morphometry, the Barka
   staining technique applied to pulmonary and splenic blood smears, and,
   finally, by molecular diagnostics-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
   sequencing. Twenty-three subjects (17.4\%) proved to be positive for
   filarial parasites. Infection by Acanthocheilonema was more widespread
   than by Dirofilaria. Briefly, 8 foxes harbored mature adults of D.
   immitis; two of them (25\%) also had microfilariae that in one case were
   mixed with the microfilariae of D. repens. Twelve subjects had
   microfilariae of Acanthocheilonema reconditum, and 3 harbored
   microfilariae of A. dracunculoides. Molecular diagnostics confirmed all
   results. Our findings, drawn by the examination of a few microliters of
   blood obtained from foxes approximately < 2 years of age, support the
   hypothesis that this animal may be an abundant source of infection for
   ticks that transmit Acanthocheilonema parasites and for mosquitoes that
   act as vectors for dirofilarial nematodes. Therefore foxes, contributing
   to the parasite circulation in areas where dogs usually undergo
   prophylactic treatment, have to be considered an important wild
   reservoir for filarial parasites that can be transmitted to companion
   animals and people.},

Abstract = {Enteric caliciviruses (noroviruses and sapoviruses) are responsible for
   the majority of non-bacterial gastroenteritis in humans of all age
   groups. Analysis of the polymerase and capsid genes has provided
   evidence for a huge genetic diversity, but the understanding of their
   ecology is limited. In this study, we investigated the presence of
   porcine enteric caliciviruses in the faeces of piglets with diarrhoea. A
   total of 209 samples from 118 herds were analyszd and calicivirus RNA
   was detected by RT-PCR in 68 sample (32.5\%) and in 46 herds (38.9\%),
   alone or in mixed infection with group A and C rotaviruses. Sequence and
   phylogenetic analysis of the calicivirus-positive samples characterized
   the majority as genogroup III (GGIII) sapoviruses. Unclassified
   caliciviruses, distantly related to the representatives of the other
   sapovirus genogroups, were identified in five herds, while one outbreak
   was associated with a porcine sapovirus related genetically to human
   GGII and GGIV sapovirus strains. By converse, norovirus strains were not
   detected. Altogether, these data suggest the epidemiological relevance
   of porcine enteric caliciviruses and suggest a role in the etiology of
   piglets diarrhoea.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the risk of
   transfusion-transmitted visceral leishmaniasis was present in an area of
   western Sicily where the incidence of the disease is higher than the
   regional average. From May to December 2005, 1449 blood donors from
   Agrigento district (Sicily, Italy) were screened for the presence of
   anti-Leishmania antibodies by an indirect immunofluorescent antibody
   test (IFAT). Blood samples from IFAT-positive donors were examined by
   PCR to detect Leishmania DNA. Anti-Leishmania antibodies were found in
   11 (0.75\%) cases, among which Leishmania DNA was detected from four
   (36.4\%). Particular techniques to inactivate different pathogens would
   be considered mandatory in the case of immunosuppressed recipients. (c)

Title = {Alterations of hepatic ATP homeostasis and respiratory chain during

Abstract = {Background Mitochondrial dysfunction is considered a key player in
   non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) but no data are available on the
   mitochondrial function and ATP homeostasis in the liver during NASH
   progression. In the present paper we evaluated the hepatic mitochondrial
   respiratory chain activity and ATP synthesis in a rodent model of NASH
   development.
   Materials and methods Male Wistar rats fed a High Fat/Methionine-Choline
   Deficient (MCD) diet to induce NASH or a control diet (SHAM), and
   sacrificed after 3, 7 and 11 weeks. The oxidative phosphorylation, the
   F(0)F(1)ATPase (ATP synthase) and the ATP content were assessed in liver
   mitochondria.
   Results NASH mitochondria exhibited an increased rate of substrate
   oxidation at 3 weeks, which returned to below the normal level at 7 and
   11 weeks, concomitantly with the coupling between the phosphorylation
   activity and the mitochondrial respiration (ADP/O). Uncoupling of NASH
   liver mitochondria did not allow the recovery of the maximal respiration
   rate at 7 and 11 weeks. The ATPase (ATP synthase) activity was similar
   in NASH and SHAM rats, but the mitochondrial ATP content was
   significantly lower in NASH livers.
   Conclusions The loss of hepatic ATP stores is not dependent on the
   F0F1-ATPase but resides in the respiratory chain. Dysfunction of both
   Complex I and II of the mitochondrial respiratory chain during NASH
   development implies a mitochondrial adaptive mechanism occurring in the
   early stages of NASH.},

Abstract = {Aluminium (Al) is a ubiquitous metal that is potentially toxic to the
   brain. Its effects on other fundamental organs are not completely
   understood. This morphological in vivo study sought to compare sublethal
   hepatotoxic changes and Al deposition in adult mice that orally ingested
   Al sulphate daily for 10 months, in age matched control mice that drank
   tap water and in senescent mice (24 months old). Livers were examined
   for collagen deposition using Sirius red and Masson, for iron
   accumulation using Perls' stain. Light, electron microscopy and
   morphometry were used to assess fibrosis and vascular changes. Scanning
   transmission electron microscopy and EDX microanalysis were used to
   detect in situ elemental Al. Iron deposition, transferrin receptor
   expression were significantly altered following Al exposure and in the
   aged liver but were unaffected in age matched control mice. In Al
   treated mice as in senescent mice, endothelial thickness was increased
   and porosity was decreased like perisinusoidal actin. Furthermore, Al
   stimulated the deposition of collagen and laminin, mainly in acinar
   zones 1 and 3. Pseudocapillarization and periportal laminin in senescent
   mice were similar to Al treated adult liver. In conclusion, prolonged Al
   sulphate intake accelerates features of senescence in the adult mice
   liver. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A novel proximity ligation assay (PLA) using a pan-serotype reactive
   monoclonal antibody was developed and evaluated for the detection of
   foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) in clinical samples collected from
   field cases of disease. The FMDV-specific PLA was found to be 100 times
   more sensitive for virus detection than the commonly used antigen
   capture-ELISA (AgELISA). As few as five TCID50 were detected in
   individual assays, which was comparable with the analytical sensitivity
   of real-time RT-PCR. Although this assay was capable of detecting
   diverse isolates from all seven FMDV serotypes, the diagnostic
   sensitivity of the PLA assay was lower than real-time RT-PCR mainly due
   to a failure to detect some SAT 1, SAT 2 and SAT 3 FMDV strains. In
   conclusion, this new PLA format has high analytical sensitivity for the
   detection of FMDV in clinical samples and may prove valuable as a rapid
   and simple tool for use in FMD diagnosis. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Fifteen unweaned thoroughbred foals, born on a stud farm to vaccinated
   mares, were clinically monitored during their first six months of life
   and repeatedly tested for equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) and equine
   herpesvirus type 4 (EHV-4). Nasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples were
   collected and screened respectively by PCR and seroneutralisation to
   detect the presence of the virus, explore its role as a possible cause
   of respiratory disease, and to assess the efficiency of the PCR for the
   diagnosis of this disease. The foals were divided into three groups on
   the basis of their clinical signs and whether they had seroconverted to
   EHV-1 and/or EHV-4: first, foals with no clinical signs of disease that
   had not seroconverted; secondly, foals with clinical signs that had
   seroconverted, and thirdly, foals with clinical signs that had not
   seroconverted. The results indicated that the viruses circulated on the
   stud farm despite stringent vaccination regimens against them, and
   confirmed their association with respiratory disease. The absence of
   significantly different PCR results among the three groups of foals
   showed that the PCR was effective in confirming the circulation of the
   viruses on the premises without being particularly helpful as a
   diagnostic tool.},

   was usually associated with a reduction of feed consumption. in
   farrowing-to-weaning herds, diarrhoea affected the sows and suckling
   piglets, and the mortality in newborn piglets was up to 34 per cent. In
   growers and fatteners the morbidity ranged from 20 to 80 per cent, but
   there was either no mortality or it was very low. Depending on the size
   of the herd and the type of operation, the clinical disease lasted for
   weeks or months.},

Abstract = {Red deer (n = 149) from eight geographical locations, including the
   endangered endemic populations from the Tyrrhenian islands (Sardinia and
   Corsica), were analysed at eight polymorphic microsatellite loci. Two
   questions were addressed: (1) Is there a founder effect in the Corsican
   population, which was reintroduced to the island using Sardinian deer
   after the species' extinction on Corsica? (2) What is the origin of the
   Tyrrhenian or Corsican red deer (Cervus elaphus corsicanus)? Our results
   showed signs of a founder effect for the red deer on Corsica in that
   these deer showed differentiation from the Sardinian population as
   measured by F-ST values, assignment tests (with and without a priori
   definition of populations) and individual-based dendrograms. Genetic
   variability, however, did not differ significantly between the two
   populations. With respect to the phylogeography of C. e. corsicanus we
   found that both deer from North-Africa and Mesola on the Italian
   mainland were genetically close to the Corsican red deer, but
   phylogenetic trees based on genetic distances were only poorly supported
   statistically. Among all populations studied the Mesola red deer showed
   the lowest distance values from Corsican red deer and yielded allele
   frequencies that were more similar to those of C. e. corsicanus than
   were those of North-African red deer. These results are in line with
   recent palaeontological and archaeozoological findings which suggest
   that the Corsican red deer is derived from small Italian red deer
   introduced from the mainland to Sardinia and Corsica during the Late
   Neolithic and just before the beginning of Classical Antiquity,
   respectively. They also suggest a possible recent introduction of
   Tyrrhenian red deer to North-Africa (rather than the other way around),
   thus accounting for the close genetic relationship (especially based on
   mitochondrial DNA) that has repeatedly been found between C. e.
   corsicanus and C. e. barbarus.},

Abstract = {The bovine spongiform encephalopathy epidemic is thought to have
   occurred as a consequence of feeding prion-infected material to cattle.
   To avoid the risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy diffusion, the
   European Commission (Directive 2003/126/EC) established an official
   method to detect the presence of animal-derived constituents in
   feedstuffs, using microscopic examination. This method allows easy
   identification of bone fragments among other animal constituents. The
   analysis is based on morphological conformation of the fragments and
   their characterization (mainly of the shape of lacunae) to discriminate
   among mammalian, poultry, and fish tissues. The aim of this study was to
   assess the performances of nine European laboratories through a ring
   trial of the official microscopic method, and to calculate accuracy and
   reproducibility of the method. In general the reproducibility of the
   microscopic method was very good (kappa overall = 0.83), with a high
   sensitivity for all laboratories. Concerning the analysis on the
   different animal-derived constituents, the results show values of
   sensitivity with large variability between fish and poultry or mammal.
   It was generally more difficult to discriminate between mammalian and
   poultry tissues than fish tissue.},

Abstract = {A multilocus VNTR analysis (MLVA) system for detection of tandem repeats
   across the whole genome of Chlamydophila psittaci has been developed.
   Twenty selected genetic loci were initially tested on 9 avian reference
   strains including representatives of all major serotypes (A to F).
   Thereafter, 8 loci were retained for a more complete study performed on
   over 150 C psittaci isolates from different bird species and
   geographical origins. Comparative analysis of the MLVA results and those
   obtained from currently available methods including serotyping and/or
   ompA sequencing indicate that the MLVA system provides an additional
   level of discrimination, with 20 distinct patterns identified to date.
   The newly developed MLVA system therefore provides a highly sensitive,
   high resolution test for the differentiation of C. psittaci isolates
   from different origins that is suitable for molecular epidemiological
   studies. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {After the incursion of bluetongue virus (BTV) into European
   Mediterranean countries in 1998, vaccination Was used ill an effort to
   minimize direct economic losses to animal production, reduce virus
   circulation and allow safe movements of animals from endemic areas.
   Vaccination strategies in different countries were developed according
   to their individual policies, the geographic distribution of the
   incurring serotypes of BTV and the availability of appropriate vaccines.
   Four monovalent modified live virus (MLV) vaccines were imported from
   South Africa and subsequently used extensively in both cattle and sheep.
   MLVs were found to be immunogenic and capable of generating strong
   protective immunity ill vaccinated ruminants. Adverse side effects were
   principally evident in sheep. specifically, some vaccinated sheep
   developed signs of clinical bluetongue With fever, facial oedema and
   lameness. Lactating sheep that developed fever also had reduced milk
   production. More severe clinical signs occured in large numbers of sheep
   that were vaccinated with vaccine combinations containing the BTV-16
   MLV, and the use of the monovalent BTV-16 MLV was discontinued as a
   consequence. Abortion occurred in < 0.5\% of vaccinated animals. The
   length of viraemia in sheep and cattle that received MLVs did not exceed
   35 days, with the single notable exception of a cow vaccinated with a
   multivalent BTV-2, -4, -9 and -16 vaccine in which viraemia persisted at
   least 78 days. Viraemia of sufficient titre to infect Culicoides insects
   was observed transiently in MLV-vaccinated ruminants, and natural
   transmission of MLV strains has been confirmed. An inactivated vaccine
   was first developed against BTV-2 and used in the field. An inactivated
   vaccine against BTV-4 as well as a bivalent vaccine against serotypes 2
   and 4 were subsequently developed and used in Corsica, Spain, Portugal
   and Italy. These inactivated vaccines were generally safe although on
   few occasions reactions occurred at the site of inoculation. Two doses
   of these BTV inactivated vaccines provided complete, long-lasting
   immunity against both clinical signs and viraemia, whereas a single
   immunization with the BTV-4 inactivated vaccine gave only partial
   reduction of viraemia in vaccinated cattle when challenged with the
   homologous BTV serotype. Additional BTV inactivated vaccines are
   currently under development, as well as new generation vaccines
   including recombinant vaccines. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Rapid diagnosis Of tuberculosis in cattle reacting positive in
   antemortem assays is crucial in countries where eradication programs are
   operated to confirm the presence of the infection ill tuberculosis-free
   herds. This study evaluated the accuracy of histopathologic examination
   by hematoxylin and eosin and Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining applied in this
   framework. When Suspected lesions are caused by low infectious doses and
   are detected in early stages of the disease. For this purpose,
   histologic methods were compared with mycobacterial Culture as reference
   test on suspected lymph node samples from 173 cattle reacting positive
   in antemortem tests. Histopathology demonstrated high sensitivity
   (93.4\%) and specificity (92.3\%). while ZN sensitivity and specificity
   were respectively 33.9\% and 100\%. There was good agreement between
   histopathology and bacterial culture, suggesting that histopathologic
   examination is a reliable tool For rapid diagnosis In countries where
   active tuberculosis eradication programs allow the prompt identification
   and elimination of reactor cattle. Histopathology permits identification
   of typical mycobacterial lesions and its differentiation from other

Abstract = {A case of pulmonary blastoma in a 13-year-old Italian Frisian cow is
   reported. On postmortem, the gross lesions consisted of multiple white
   circumscribed masses throughout the lungs, with pleural involvement and
   lymph node metastasis. Histologically, the tumour was composed of a dual
   population of mesenchymal and epithelial neoplastic cells. Epithelial
   cells formed nests, tubules and structures resembling bronchioles of
   normal lung. Mesenchymal cells were spindle shaped with oval nuclei and
   fibrillar eosinophilic cytoplasm, large rounded cells with multiple
   round nuclei and granular eosinophilic cytoplasm, or blast-like, with
   large hyperchromatic nuclei and amphophilic cytoplasm. The tumour varied
   greatly in appearance from one field to another within the same tumour.
   Epithelial cells stained positively with antibodies developed against
   cytokeratin. Some spindle-shaped mesenchymal cells exhibited smooth
   muscle cell differentiation with positive staining with anti-vimentin,
   anti-NSE and anti-muscle-specific actin antibodies; rounded mesenchymal
   cells with multiple nuclei did not express muscle cell differentiation.
   The variable expression of the intermediate filaments indicates multiple
   pathways of differentiation in the pulmonary blastoma.},

Abstract = {The importance of Trasmissible Spongiform Encephalopaties in small
   ruminants increased after the discovery in France of a natural BSE case
   in a goat. Selection has been used to control TSE in sheep populations
   because of the association between PRNP polymorphisms and resistance to
   scrapie. In goats, however, a similar association has not been proved so
   far.
   In Italy only limited studies have been carried out on caprine PRNP
   genotype distribution; the aim of this study was to determine the
   variability of the PRNP gene in goat populations from two Northern
   italian regions: Piemonte and Valle d'Aosta. Coding region of PRNP has
   been sequenced for 364 goats. In total, eight polymorphic sites were
   identified giving rise to nine alleles. The two analysed caprine
   populations were different regarding PRNP genetic variability; breeds
   reared in Piemonte were similar each other, while Valdostana breed seems
   to be a different population. Differences in allele frequencies, if
   related to alleles potential candidates for modulating
   resistance/susceptibility, need to be taken into account for future
   breeding programs.},

Abstract = {Since 2000 severe, long-lasting epidemics of bluetongue virus (BTV) have
   been described in Italy, caused by BTV serotypes 2, 4, 9 and 16.
   Vaccination programs have been applied extensively to control the
   infection, in spite of concerns about the potential dissemination of
   attenuated vaccine strains of BTV in susceptible animals. Accordingly,
   rapid and reliable differentiation between vaccine and field strains is
   paramount in routine diagnosis of BTV to evaluate the extent of this
   phenomenon. In the present study, we report the development of two
   real-time RT-PCR assays able to recognise BTV serotypes 2 and 9,
   respectively, and we evaluated the use of the assays for discrimination
   between field and vaccine strains. A total of 65 samples collected in
   Italy from 2000 to 2006 and diagnosed as positive for either BTV-2 or -9
   were analysed by the TaqMan assays. Both the assays were found to be
   highly sensitive and reproducible, ensuring correct serotype
   characterisation and prediction of the origin of the strains, as
   confirmed by characterisation using virus neutralisation and sequencing.

Abstract = {The aim of this paper was to characterize the diversity among haplotypes
   based on 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and one deletion
   within four casein genes in two geographically distant goat populations,
   the Sicilian Girgentana breed and the Norwegian goat breed. Forty
   Girgentana goats were genotyped for the aforementioned polymorphisms and
   the resulting data set was compared with 436 goats from the Norwegian
   population previously genotyped for these markers. Several casein gene
   polymorphisms were not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium either in
   Girgentana, or in the Norwegian breed. The SNP haplotype frequencies for
   the four casein genes were calculated and despite the large geographical
   distance and phenotypic divergence between these breeds, a proportion of
   casein loci haplotypes were found to be identical between both Norwegian
   and Girgentana goats. However, for the CSN2 gene there were no common
   haplotypes between the two populations. The level of linkage
   disequilibrium between the casein genes was less in the Girgentana
   population than in the Norwegian population.},

Title = {The northward spread of leishmaniasis in Italy: evidence from

Abstract = {Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) incidence has been increased in Italy in
   humans and dogs since the 1990s, with new foci being detected within
   traditional boundaries of endemic transmission but also in northern
   regions previously regarded as non-endemic. To monitor the putative VL
   spreading, surveillance was implemented in northern continental Italy
   comprising: analysis of human cases recorded from 1990 through 2005;
   retrospective literature analysis of canine leishmaniasis (CanL) and
   phlebotomine sandfly records through 2002; prospective investigations in
   dogs from 2003 through 2005 and surveys on sandflies in 2003 and 2004.
   Two-hundred-thirty human cases (11\% of Italian cases) were recorded.
   Their stratification by age and HIV status disclosed a sharp decrease of
   HlV/VL co-infections paralleled by concomitant increase of paediatric
   and HIV-negative adult patients during the study period. Four patients
   had no travel history. Seven leishmaniasis foci were retrospectively
   identified since 1990, whereas prospective investigations in dogs
   disclosed 47 autochthonous clinical cases and 106 autochthonous
   seropositives among 5442 dogs (2.1\%) from 16 foci of six regions.
   Parasites were typed as Leishmania infantum MON-1. Four vector species
   were identified among 1696 Phlebotomus (Larroussius) collected
   specimens. Comparisons with historical data showed that P. perniciosus
   and P. neglectus have increased in density and expanded their geographic
   range in the study area. Northern continental Italy is now focally
   endemic for VL and a moderate risk for human disease does exist,
   although the intensity of transmission seems to be lower than in
   traditional settings of Mediterranean VL.},

Abstract = {This study shows that a diet including insect-resistant Bt176 maize, fed
   to 53 ewes and their progeny for 3 years, did not have adverse effects
   on their health or performance and that no horizontal gene transfer to
   ruminal microorganisms or animal tissues was detected. No differences
   were observed regarding performance, reproductive traits, haematological
   parameters, antioxidant defences, lymphocyte proliferative capacity,
   phagocytosis and intracellular killing of macrophages, and ruminal
   microbial population characteristics between control and genetically
   modified (GM) maize-fed animals. Immune response to Salmonella abortus
   ovis vaccination was more efficient in GM maize fed sheep. No
   modifications of histological features of tissues were found; however,
   cytochemical analyses of ruminal epithelium by Ki67 staining provided
   evidence of proliferative activation of basal cells in all GM maize-fed
   ewes. Preliminary electron microscopy analyses of the liver and pancreas
   revealed smaller cell nuclei containing increased amounts of
   heterochromatin and perichromatin granules in GM maize-fed lambs. Meat
   protein content and water loss by cooking were slightly affected by the
   dietary treatment. No transgenic DNA was detected in tissues, blood, and
   ruminal fluid or ruminal bacteria. Longitudinal studies should be
   included in evaluation of food safety whenever possible and sheep may be
   a useful animal model for toxicological assessment. (C) 2007 Elsevier

Abstract = {Two newly isolated virulent coliphages (MVBS and MVSS) showed ability to
   lyse (form plaque on) a high percentage of pathogenic Escherichia coli

   tested isolates exhibited resistance to a broad range of antibiotics. It
   was also observed that, in contrast to antibiotics, phage treatment did
   not induce Shiga toxin production. These findings suggest that the newly

Volume = {126},

Abstract = {Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the genes (S10)
   encoding the NS3 protein of 137 strains of bluetongue virus (BTV) from
   Africa, the Americas, Asia, Australia and the Mediterranean Basin showed
   limited variation. Common to all NS3 sequences were potential
   glycosylation sites at amino acid residues 63 and 150 and a cysteine at
   residue 137, whereas a cysteine at residue 181 was not conserved. The
   PPXY and PS/TAP late-domain motifs were conserved in all but three of
   the viruses. Phylogenetic analyses of these same sequences yielded two
   principal clades that grouped the viruses irrespective of their serotype
   or year of isolation (1900-2003). All viruses from Asia and Australia
   were grouped in one clade, whereas those from the other regions were
   present: in both clades. Each clade segregated into distinct subclades
   that included viruses from single or multiple regions, and the S10 genes
   of some field viruses were identical to those of live-attenuated BTV
   vaccines. There was no evidence of positive selection on the S10 gene as
   assessed by reconstruction of ancestral codon states on the phylogeny,
   rather the functional constraints of the NS3 protein are expressed
   through substantial negative (purifying) selection. (C) 2007 Elsevier

   amplified product (935 base pairs) was observed only with DNA from
   samples containing C. colinum. Results from performing PCR assays on
   faecal samples from quails spiked with different concentrations of C.
   colinum, showed that the detection limit of the assay was 1.6104
   colony-forming units per gram of faecal material. This PCR assay can be
   used in diagnostic laboratories to confirm the presence of C. colinum in
   pure cultures and could be used to screen enriched samples or faecal
   samples for the presence of this pathogen.},

Abstract = {The present study investigated the occurrence of anaerobic intestinal
   spirochaetes of the genus Brachyspira in laying hen flocks in Treviso
   province, north-eastern Italy, with respect to prevalence, spirochaete
   species present, disease associations and risk factors for colonization.
   A total of 450 faecal samples from 45 sheds on 29 laying hen farms were
   cultured for intestinal spirochaetes. Nineteen sheds on 12 farms
   contained chickens with symptoms consistent with avian intestinal
   spirochaetosis, including reduced egg production, wet litter and/or
   pasty vents. Spirochaetes were isolated from 157 (34.8\%) samples from
   21 (72.4\%) farms, and from 32 (71.1\%) sheds. From these positive
   samples, 189 spirochaetal isolates were speciated using three polymerase
   chain reaction assays and a restriction fragment polymorphism analysis
   of 16S rDNA polymerase chain reaction products. Overall, 52 (27.5\%)
   isolates were identified as pathogenic Brachyspira intermedia, 26
   (13.8\%) as pathogenic Brachyspira pilosicoli, 93 (49.7\%) as
   non-pathogenic (Brachyspira innocens/Brachyspira murdochii), and 18
   (9.6\%) were unidentified. Faeces from 14 sheds (31\%) on 10 farms
   (34.5\%) contained B. intermedia and/or B. pilosicoli, and disease
   consistent with avian intestinal spirochaetosis was observed in nine of
   these sheds on seven farms. There was a significant association
   (P=0.042) between the presence of spirochaetes and using deep pits
   rather than conveyor belts for manure disposal. Sheds housing chickens
   40 weeks of age were significantly more likely to contain spirochaetes
   (P=0.048) and pathogenic species (P=007) than sheds housing younger
   chickens. A significant association (P=0.02) was found between infection
   with pathogenic spirochaetes and reduced egg production.},

   protection of animals after challenge with M. agalactiae, but only
   vaccine C, emulsioned with Montanide ISA-563, Marcol-52 and Montane-80
   (ratio: 30\%, 63\%, 7\% respectively), was able to induce full

Abstract = {Avian influenza infections by high and low pathogenicity H7 influenza
   viruses have caused several outbreaks in European poultry in recent
   years, also resulting in human infections. Although in some cases the
   source of H7 strains from domestic poultry was shown to be the viruses
   circulating in the wild bird reservoir, a thorough characterization of
   the entire genome of H7 viruses from both wild and domestic Eurasian
   birds, and their evolutionary relationships, has not been conducted. In
   our study, we have analysed low pathogenicity H7 influenza strains
   isolated from wild and domestic ducks in Italy and southern China and
   compared them with those from reared terrestrial poultry such as chicken
   and turkey. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the H7
   haemagglutinin genes were all closely related to each other, whereas the
   remaining genes could be divided into two or more phylogenetic groups.
   Almost each year different H7 reassortant viruses were identified and in
   at least two different years more than one H7 genotype co-circulated. A
   recent precursor in wild waterfowl was identified for most of the gene
   segments of terrestrial poultry viruses. Our data suggest that
   reassortment allows avian influenza viruses, in their natural reservoir,
   to increase their genetic diversity. In turn this might help avian
   influenza viruses colonize a wider range of hosts, including domestic
   poultry.},

Abstract = {Avian influenza (AI) is a listed disease of the World Organisation for
   Animal Health (OIE) that has become a disease of great importance both
   for animal and human health. Until recent times, AI was considered a
   disease of birds with zoonotic implications of limited significance. The
   emergence and spread of the Asian lineage highly pathogenic AI H5N1
   virus has dramatically changed this perspective; not only has it been
   responsible of the death or culling of millions of birds, but this virus
   has also been able to infect a variety of non-avian hosts including
   human beings. The implications of such a panzootic reflect themselves in
   animal health issues, notably in the reduction of a protein source for
   developing countries and in the management of the pandemic potential.
   Retrospective studies have shown that avian progenitors play an
   important role in the generation of pandemic viruses for humans, and
   therefore these infections in the avian reservoir should be subjected to
   control measures aiming at eradication of the Asian H5N1 virus from all
   sectors rather than just eliminating or reducing the impact of the
   disease in poultry. Collection and analysis of information in a
   transparent environment and close collaboration between the medical and
   veterinary scientific community are crucial to support the global AI
   crisis.},

Abstract = {Recent outbreaks of avian influenza (AI) occurring in Europe, in the
   Americas, in Asia and in Africa have provided field evidence of how
   challenging the control of this infection can be, particularly in
   densely populated poultry areas or in areas where free-range rural
   village poultry and backyard flocks are present. In these areas,
   laboratory testing is mainly applied to trace viral circulation in a
   given area or in a susceptible population to implement an early warning
   system, rather than to diagnose the presence of the virus in a diseased
   flock or animal. This implies the use of rapid, sensitive and possibly
   cost-effective laboratory tests adaptable to very high throughputs. As a
   consequence, new diagnostic approaches and technologies have been
   increasingly developed and applied. Molecular biology and biotechnology
   are providing important and precious contributions to the field of AI
   diagnosis, making extremely rapid, specific and sensitive techniques
   available. However, the use of some of these technologies is still
   limited, due to their costs and to the requirement of advanced technical
   and scientific expertise. Therefore, more conventional and
   well-established techniques, should not be abandoned but rather
   reconsidered and improved or modified.},

Abstract = {Since 1995 most of the Italian scrapie outbreaks have involved sarda
   sheep, the main ovine Italian breed. This study was designed to evaluate
   the incidence of scrapie among sarda sheep in all the outbreaks reported
   based on clinical symptoms between 1995 and 2007.
   In order to collect information all farmers were interviewed using a
   standardised questionnaire, containing the following items : number of
   sheep (classified into three age classes : <2 year old, from 2 to 4 year
   old, >4 year old), number of animals with scrapie-like symptoms observed
   during the last 12 months prior to the confirmation of the disease in
   the flock. The incidence of scrapie was calculated both in the total
   sarda sheep population and within each scrapie-affected flock. The
   incidence was calculated both on the overall population and within age
   classes. The study of results by age classes demonstrate, as expected,
   that the highest incidence of scrapie is found in 2 to 4 year-old small
   ruminants. Crude within-flock incidence was 2.59 cases per 100
   animal-years (CI 95\% 2.46-2.73); the median within-flock incidence was
   pretty low. There are not significant year to year variations in the
   age-adjusted incidence and no clear temporal trend.
   These results are a starting point for future investigations on risk
   factors that may influence within-flock incidence of Scrapie, such as
   vaccinations, animal handling and management. The validity of these
   data, collected through oral interviews, may have been influenced by the
   farmers' ability to recognize the disease and to remember the oldest
   cases.},

Abstract = {During local respiratory disease outbreaks, occurring in 2003 and 2004
   in horse training stables within race-tracks in Rome, and on a stud
   horse farm in Bari in 2005, four strains of equine influenza (EI) virus
   were isolated. All outbreaks occurred in flu-vaccinated horses. Here, we
   are reporting the results of the genetic characterization of these
   isolates, together with that of another El virus strain isolated in 1999
   from a dead foal presenting pulmonary lesions. Alignment and
   phylogenetic analyses were carried out using the haemagglutinin amino
   acid sequences. The Rome and Bari isolates were identified as members of
   the American lineage, closely related to other recent strains isolated
   in America as well as in Europe, including the latest recommended
   American lineage vaccine prototype A/eq/SouthAfrica/4/2003. In contrast,
   the Italian 1999 isolate was clustered within the European lineage. In
   Italy, the most recent outbreaks of El have been caused by the currently
   circulating American-like strains, even in vaccinated populations,
   confirming that vaccines should contain an updated representative strain
   of this lineage. Presently, companies are still in the process of
   registering updated vaccines but no product is yet available on the
   market. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {An outbreak of canine parvovirus type 2c (CPV-2c) infection in

   kennel in Italy and affected 11 dogs aged between 6 months and 2.5
   years, that had been repeatedly administered vaccines containing a type
   2 (old type) CPV strain. CPV infection was demonstrated in all diseased
   dogs by an immunochromatographic test. A CPV strain was isolated from
   the intestinal content of a 20-month-old pregnant Bernese mountain bitch
   that underwent a fatal outcome. The strain was characterised as CPV-2c
   by means of real-time PCR assays using minor groove binder probes. The
   present report provides further concerns about the real efficacy of type
   2-based vaccines against the antigenic variants of CPV and stresses the
   need for developing new vaccines prepared with the variants currently
   circulating in the dog population.},

Abstract = {A severe outbreak of enteric and respiratory disease associated with
   bovine coronavirus (BCoV) infection is described. The outbreak occurred
   in a dairy herd of southern Italy in the first decade of September 2006,
   when summer temperatures were still recorded, affecting calves, heifers
   and adult cows, with a marked decrease in milk production. By virus
   isolation and RT-PCR targeting the S gene, BCoV was identified as the
   etiological agent of the outbreak, whereas bacteriological,
   parasitological and toxicological investigations failed to detect other
   causes of disease. BCoV strains with 99-100\% nucleotide identity in the
   S gene were isolated from nasal, ocular and rectal swabs, thus proving
   the absence of separate clusters of virus on the basis of tissue
   tropism. Sequence analysis of the haemagglutination-esterase and spike
   proteins of the strain detected in one rectal sample (339/06) showed a
   high genetic relatedness with recent BCoV isolates (98-99\% amino acid
   identity), with several unique amino acid substitutions in the S
   protein. The BCoV outbreak described in this paper presents interesting
   aspects: (i) the occurrence of a severe form of disease in the warmer
   season; (ii) the simultaneous presence of respiratory and enteric
   disease; (iii) the involvement of young as well as adult cattle. (C)

Abstract = {PCDDs and PCDFs levels exceeding the European Union tolerance limits
   were detected in milk from different animal species (cows, sheep, goats,
   and buffaloes) and in animal feed samples from Campania region in
   southern Italy. A monitoring plan was performed in the period 2002-2004
   to investigate the extension of the contamination. A total of 595 milk
   samples were analyzed and the percentage of noncompliant samples
   (PCDD/Fs > 3 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat) was 27\% (maximum value 30.43 pg
   WHO-TEQ/g fat for a sheep's milk). The number of tested feedingstuffs
   was 434 but only feed likely grown in the area of sampling such as
   grass, silage and hay (267 samples) showed a significant contamination
   with 13\% of samples containing PCDD/F > 0.75 ng WHO-TEQ/kg product
   (tolerance limit referred to 12\% moisture content). The spatial
   autocorrelation analysis based on the calculation of the I-Moran index
   gave significant values for both milk and animal feed and highlighted an
   area. characterized by a widespread practice of illegal waste dumping
   and burning. The problem of waste management in the area of study is
   particularly worrying from the sanitary point of view with a significant
   excess of cancer mortality and occurrence of malformations revealed by a
   recent research.},

Abstract = {A method has been developed to analyse for ibuprofen (IBP), ketoprofen
   (KPF), diclofenac (DCF) and phenylbutazone (PBZ) residues in bovine
   milk. Milk samples were extracted with acetonitrile and sample extracts
   were purified on Isolute C18 solid-phase extraction cartridges. Aliquots
   were analysed by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS).
   The method was validated in bovine milk, according to the criteria
   defined in Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. The decision limits (CC were
   0.59, 2.69, 0.90 and 0.70 ng ml-1, respectively, for IBP, KPF, DCF and
   PBZ, and detection capabilities (CC) of 1.01, 4.58, 1.54 and 1.19 ng
   ml-1, respectively, were obtained. The measurement uncertainty of the
   method was 17.8\%, 80.9\%, 28.2\% and 20.2\% for IBP, KPF, DCF and PBZ,
   respectively. Fortifying bovine milk samples (n = 18) in three separate
   assays show the accuracy of the method to be between 104\% and 112\%.
   The precision of the method, expressed as relative standard deviations
   for the within-laboratory reproducibility at the three levels of
   fortification (5, 7.5 and 10 ng ml-1) was less than 8\% for IBP, DCF and
   PBZ, respectively. Poor precision was obtained for KPF with a relative
   standard deviation of 28\%.},

Abstract = {Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) cause blooms in eutrophic lakes and
   drinking water reservoirs. They also produce biotoxins, including
   microcystins (MCs), highly toxic cyclic heptapeptides that cause
   poisoning in animals and human. In this paper, we present a method for
   the analysis of four MCs by ion trap LC-MS and MALDI-TOF/MS. The data
   are compared to evaluate the performance and reliability of the
   different MS detection systems. The method was applied to the analysis
   of water and algae samples from Lake Averno, near Naples, as a
   consequence of a cyanobacteria bloom. The analysis of algae cell
   extracts showed no contamination by known microcystins, but the three
   main substances were detected. MALDI-TOF/MS was successful for screening
   of the biotoxins in the samples, identifying anabaenopeptin B and
   anabaenopeptin F as the major contaminants on the basis of literature
   mass spectrometry data. The structure of the third compound was not
   identified and is under further investigation. The method could
   characterise the biotoxins produced in Lake Averno for evaluating health
   risks related to their presence.},

Abstract = {The European Council Decision 2002/657/EC established that group B
   substances detected in foods must be identified and confirmed on the
   basis of their molecular structure. To this aim, we have developed a
   panel of methods for unambiguous determination of sixteen non-steroidal
   anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in cattle and buffalo raw milk. A
   multi-residue reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography
   method with photodiode array detection is described for quantitative
   screening analysis. For confirmatory purposes, two multi-residue
   reversed-phase ion trap liquid chromatography/electrospray ionisation
   tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS) methods were developed: the
   former to identify salicylic acid, naproxen, carprofen, flurbiprofen,
   ibuprofen, meclofenamic acid, niflumic acid, flunixin and its metabolite
   5-hydroxyflunixin in the negative ion mode; the latter to identify
   ketoprofen, suxibutazone, diclofenac, mefenamic acid, tolfenamic acid,
   phenylbutazone and its metabolite oxyphenbutazone in the positive ion
   mode. These drugs are representative of different subclasses of NSAIDs
   not chemically related. The methods were in-house validated, evaluating
   specificity and calculating the mean recoveries, repeatability,
   within-laboratory reproducibility, and limits of quantification. For all
   the NSAIDs, apart from salicylic acid and 5-hydroxyflunixin, mean
   recoveries ranging between 69.0\% and 96.7\% were measured. The
   qualitative identification of all drugs was attained by their MS/MS
   spectra in the concentration range studied. Similarly, at 5 mu g/kg all
   NSAIDs, apart from flurbiprofen, were unambiguously confirmed. Copyright

Abstract = {Neosporosis is a common infection in cattle and is a major cause of
   abortions worldwide. Neospora caninum abortions have been reported in
   both dairy and beef cattle. We evaluated the presence of this protozoal
   parasite in aborted foetuses by mean of PCR analysis in herds of the
   Piedmont Region (Italy) Subsequently we compared these results with
   those obtained by serodiagnosis in order to establish a correlation with
   seroprevalence. PCR analysis was carried out on tissues from 71 aborted
   foetuses (liver, muscle, kidney, head) collected from 34 selected herds
   with a prior history of abortion problems and seropositivity for N.
   caninum. Seroprevalence in pregnant beef cattle was higher than in dairy
   cattle, but in the latter we found a higher prevalence of positive
   aborted foetuses at PCR analysis. This study confirms that N. caninum is
   an important cause of abortion and that DNA detection by PCR analysis is
   a valid tool for diagnosis of N. caninum infection in aborted foetuses.},

Title = {EFFECTS OF ETHANOL ON DIFFERENT ORGANS AND ON FCR IN QUAILS (COTURNIX
   JAPONICA)},
Journal = {PAKISTAN VETERINARY JOURNAL},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {28},

Abstract = {A study was planned to investigate the effects of different doses of
   ethanol on body organs of Japanese quails. A total of 120 quails were
   randomly divided into five groups, A, B, C, D and E. Quails of groups A,
   B, C and D were given ethanol at concentrations of 2, 4, 8 and 16\%,
   respectively in drinking water for four weeks, while birds of group E
   served as untreated control. The results at the end of 4(th) week
   revealed a significant effect on relative weight of heart, kidney and
   lungs in most treated groups. The increase in heart and lung weight was
   significant (P < 0.05) in quail given 4\% and higher ethanol, of kidney
   given 2 to 8\% ethanol, while statistically no effect was observed on
   relative weight of liver. The relative weight of the proventriculus and
   the intestine at 4(th) week also showed statistically no difference
   compared to control group. However, the weight of the gizzard at 4(th)
   week increased significantly (P0.05) in groups given 8 to 16\% ethanol
   and the increase was 42\% in these groups compared with control group.
   The lymphoid organs at the end of 4(th) week revealed significant
   difference in weight of the bursa of Fabricius in quails given 16\%
   ethanol and of the thymus in quails given 4 to 16\% ethanol.
   Statistically, no difference was observed in spleen weight of treated
   groups compared to control group. The gross and light microscopic
   examination failed to reveal significant changes in these organs with
   routine methods of examination. Ethanol showed a significant effect on
   feed conversion ratio which was poor in ethanol treated groups; at the
   end of 4(th) week, it varied from 232 to 442\% in groups given 8 and
   16\% ethanol, respectively. These data suggest that ethanol has
   significant effects on relative weight of heart, kidney, lungs, thymus,
   and on feed conversion ratio in the Japanese quails.},

Abstract = {Antibiograms of selected mastitis pathogens, performed during the decade
   1995-2004, were retrospectively analysed in order to evaluate
   antimicrobial resistance and determine whether resistance changed over
   time. Results of 2763 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase
   negative staphylococci, Streptococcus uberis and Escherichia coli,
   against penicillin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, kanamycin and
   streptomycin are discussed. Strains were isolated in clinical milk
   samples from sheep suspected of mastitis. The evolution over time of
   resistance was evaluated by means of logistic regression analysis. The
   resistance of staphylococci to penicillin appeared to be lower than
   those usually reported (4.1\% of resistant strains in S. aureus; 15.3\%
   for CNS). Higher rates of resistance were observed for aminoglycosides,
   relevant for S. uberis (84.5\% for kanamycin and 92.5\% for
   streptomycin) and S. aureus (14.6\% for kanamycin and 63.3\% for
   streptomycin). Overall resistance appeared to confirm the lower
   resistance in ovine pathogens than in bovine ones. Logistic regression
   highlighted no trends to increase for resistance over time. (c) 2007

Abstract = {A real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was used for

   and 3 dogs showed altered laboratory parameters related to an impairment

   Leishmania DNA in the lymph node aspirates from all groups of infected
   dogs versus those treasured in their blood or urine. Interestingly,
   urine samples from dogs belonging to groups 2 and 3 contained a higher
   Leishmania DNA load than that detected in their blood. This finding
   suggests that a real-time PCR analysis of urine from infected dogs could
   be a useful and noninvasive tool for monitoring the severity of

Abstract = {Vaccination against avian influenza (AI) infections caused by viruses of
   the H5 and H7 subtypes has been used in several occasions in recent
   years with the general objective of controlling and in some cases
   eradicating the disease. To contain AI infections effectively,
   vaccination should only be used as part of a comprehensive control
   strategy that also includes biosecurity, quarantine, surveillance,
   education, and elimination of infected and at-risk poultry. Although
   properly used, potent AI vaccines can prevent disease and death,
   increase resistance to infection, reduce virus replication and shedding,
   and reduce viral transmission, they cannot completely prevent AI virus
   replication. A wide variety of vaccines against AI has been developed
   and tested in experimental conditions, but only inactivated whole AI
   virus vaccines and recombinant H5-AI vaccines have been licensed and
   widely used in various countries. AI vaccination programmes should be
   adapted to local conditions to guarantee efficacy and sustainability. In
   particular, vaccination programmes should be modulated in diverse
   situations according to the virus strain involved, the characteristics
   of the poultry producing sector, the capacity of the veterinary
   infrastructure, and the availability of adequate resources. Based on the
   eco-epidemiological situation in the affected region/area/compartment
   and the assessment of the risk of AI introduction, different vaccination
   strategies could be implemented to control AI: (i) routine vaccination
   performed in endemic areas; (ii) emergency vaccination in the face of an
   epidemic; and (iii) preventative vaccination carried out whenever a high
   risk of virus incursion is identified.},

Abstract = {Many species of Vibrio are responsible for diseases in marine organisms
   and for economic losses to the aquaculture industry. The aim of this
   preliminary study was to obtain species-specific DNA zones to be used as
   potential probes from a phylogenetic analysis of the 23S ribosomal RNA
   (rRNA) gene of different Vibrio species from marine and human organisms.
   Species-specific probes were identified for V parahaemolyticus, V.
   fortis, V. splendidus, and for two clusters of taxonomically related
   species, namely V. harveyi/campbelli and V. lentus/aestuarianus. A
   reverse line blot assay showed that the designed probes can specifically
   detect the different Vibrio species, thereby proving that these probes
   can be used to evaluate the presence of pathogenic and nonpathogenic
   Vibrio species in the sea and in marine organisms to assist in the
   investigation of environmental risks.},

Abstract = {To determine the influence of lamb presence on the dairy ewes circadian
   system we monitored simultaneously 16 different parameters (insulin,
   glucose, total protein, urea, cholesterol, triglycerides, total
   bilirubine, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride,
   rectal temperature, respiratory rate and heart rate). Sixteen clinically
   healthy Sarda breed dairy ewes, divided into two groups, group A with
   their lambs and group B without their lambs, were used. Data collection
   was done at 3 hourly intervals over a 24-h period. Our results indicate
   that lamb presence influences ewes metabolism, inducing modifications of
   the acrophase and robustness of the rhythm of some physiological
   variables. Most variables lost the rhythmicity that they show in not
   pregnant and not lactating ewes. Lamb presence also influenced urea
   circadian rhythm: the time of urea peak was shifted from 16:00 to

Abstract = {The computerized image analysis system (Visual Image Analysis, VIA) was
   employed in morphological assays, the determination of live weight (LW)
   and degree of fattening (body condition score, BCS) of buffalo species.
   Ten Mediterranean multiparous, lactating buffaloes were selected and
   measured, both manually (with a Lydtin measuring stick) and by VIA, for
   the following linear parameters: withers height (WIH), rump height
   (RUH), body height (BOH), trunk length (TRL) and rump length (RUL). An
   angular parameter (with the apex at the tip of the rump and with the two
   half-line tangents at the iliac tuberosities (AIT)) was measured by VIA
   on 100 Mediterranean multiparous lactating buffaloes, plus three surface
   parameters, i.e. surface areas of the lateral profile (SLP), of the
   profile of the hindquarters (SHP) and of the lateral iliac tuberosity
   (SIT), in addition to recording live weight and BCS. A comparison
   between linear measurements and VIA showed a large degree of similarity
   (differences ranged between 0.32 and 1.55\%). With respect to the
   indirect determination of live weight, the simple regression equations
   (SLP vs. LW; SHP vs. LW) were significant at P < 0.001 and had high
   determination coefficients equal to 0.94 and 0.92, respectively. The
   multiple equation (LW=-427.7445+0.0431 SLP+0.1263 SHP) has an R-2=0.96
   and significance at P < 0.001. Satisfactory results (R-2 =0.77 and 0.81,
   P < 0.001) were obtained from the simple regression equations (AIT vs.
   BCS; SIT vs. BCS) for the objective determination of the degree of
   fattening; the multiple equation (BCS=-7.4026+0.0537 AIT+0.0180 SIT) was
   significant at P < 0.001 with R-2=0.85. The results confirm that, for
   buffalo species, computerized image analysis is an effective measuring
   system for the indirect determination of live weight. Furthermore, this
   technique has proved to be technologically innovative for the objective
   determination of degree of fattening. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   affected. Species-specific G. duodenalis assemblages (C and D) were
   identified in kennel and in privately owned dogs, while the zoonotic
   assemblage A was identified in privately owned dogs. In light of these
   results, giardiosis in dogs, and mainly in well-cared dogs, is still a

Abstract = {The coordinated activity of estrogens and epidermal growth factor
   receptor ( EGFR) family agonists represents the main determinant of
   breast cancer cell proliferation. Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)
   enhances extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 ( ERK1/2)
   activity via the transactivation of EGFR and 17 beta-estradiol (E2)
   induces SDF-1 production to exert autocrine proliferative effects. On
   this basis, we evaluated whether the inhibition of the tyrosine kinase
   (TK) activity of EGFR may control different mitogenic stimuli in breast
   tumors using the EGFR-TK inhibitor gefitinib to antagonize the
   proliferation induced by E2 in T47D human breast cancer cells. EGF, E2,
   and SDF-1 induced a dose-dependent T47D cell proliferation, that being
   nonadditive suggested the activation of common intracellular pathways.
   Gefitinib treatment inhibited not only the EGF-dependent proliferation
   and ERK1/2 activation but also the effects of SDF-1 and E2, suggesting
   that these activities were mediated by EGFR transactivation. Indeed,
   both SDF-1 and E2 caused EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. The molecular
   link between E2 and SDF-1 proliferative effects was identified because
   1,1'-(1,4- phenylenebis(methylene))bis-
   1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane octahydrochloride (AMD3100), a CXCR4
   antagonist, inhibited SDF-1- and E2-dependent proliferation and EGFR and
   ERK1/2 phosphorylation. EGFR transactivation was dependent on c-Src
   activation. E2 treatment caused a powerful SDF-1 release from T47D
   cells. Finally, in SKBR3, E2-resistant cells, EGFR was constitutively
   activated, and AMD3100 reduced EGFR phosphorylation and cell
   proliferation, whereas HER2-neu was transactivated by SDF-1 in SKBR3 but
   not in T47D cells. In conclusion, we show that activation of CXCR4
   transduces proliferative signals from the E2 receptor to EGFR, whose
   inhibition is able to revert breast cancer cell proliferation induced by
   multiple receptor activation.},

Abstract = {Nocardia spp. are an uncommon cause of mastitis, and outbreaks have
   typically been reported in dairy farms with poor hygienic and management
   conditions. The outbreak described herein involved a dairy farm with 43
   lactating cows that, after a long period with low bulk milk somatic cell
   counts (<180,000 cells/mL), experienced an increasing incidence of
   clinical mastitis with bulk milk somatic cell counts greater than
   300,000 cells/mL. Fifteen mastitic quarters milk samples from 9 dairy
   cows were found to be infected by a member of the genus Nocardia, as
   identified on the basis of selected phenotypic and chemotaxonomic
   characteristics. The isolates were confirmed as Nocardia
   neocaledoniensis by 16S rDNA gene sequencing. Average quarter milk
   somatic cell count for infected udders was 863,057 cells/mL,
   significantly greater than the average value in noninfected quarters (
   189,710 cells/mL).},

Abstract = {The geographical diffusion of leishmaniasis can depend on the factors
   limiting the distribution of sandfly vectors. In Sicily, as in all
   Mediterranean areas, sandflies are present almost all year round because
   the climate permits perpetuation of this vector's life cycle.
   Transmission can occurs in rural and domestic habitats through the bite
   of infected female phlebotomine sandflies. In Italy, the visceral form
   of leishmaniasis is commonly found, which is due exclusively to L.
   infantum. Two species of sandfly are considered the main vectors:
   Phlebotomus perniciosus and P. perfiliewi. Fluorescence resonance energy
   transfer technology was used to determine the parasite load in
   phlebotomine vectors, and the test was targeted on a 117-bp fragment of
   kinetoplast DNA minicircles. The assay was evaluated, focusing on
   analytical sensitivity, discriminatory power, and reliability of
   quantification. During 2005, a total of 1686 sandflies were trapped in
   various Sicilian provinces and in farms randomly selected using black
   light traps. We found 20, 30, and 16 sandflies positive for Leishmania
   for each kind of analyzed phlebotomine sandfly, respectively,
   corresponding to 6.5\% for the gravid, 2.7\% for the fed, and 6.3\% for
   other groups. Previously the insects were identified on the basis of
   morphology and the most prevalent sandfly species were P. Sergentomyia
   minuta, P. perfiliewi, and P. perniciosus.},

Title = {Molecular update on cystic echinococcosis in cattle and water buffaloes

Abstract = {Cystic echinococcosis (CE) - caused by the larval stage (hydatid cyst)
   of the cestode Echinococcus granulosus - is one of the most widespread
   zoonoses of veterinary and medical importance. Molecular techniques have
   allowed the identification of 10 different genotypes (G1-G10) of the
   parasite. The present paper is an update regarding the E. granulosus
   genotypes infecting water buffaloes and cattle bred in the Campania
   region of southern Italy. The molecular study was performed on 30
   hydatid cysts (11 from water buffaloes and 19 from cattle). Two
   different mitochondrial DNA genes, namely the cytochrome c oxidase
   subunits 1 and the 12S ribosomal DNA (12S rDNA) were used as genetic
   markers. Three different genotypes of E. granulosus were unequivocally
   identified, i.e. the G1 (common sheep), G2 (Tasmanian sheep) and G3
   (buffalo) genotypes, as well as some G1 and G2 variants. It should be
   noted that the present study demonstrated for the first time: (i) the
   presence of the G2 genotype in water buffaloes from a Mediterranean
   area; and (ii) the fact that the analysed portion of the 12S rDNA gene
   can not discriminate between the G2 and G3 genotypes of E. granulosus.
   The finding of the G1, G2 and G3 genotypes in large ruminants from
   southern Italy is of epidemiological relevance and immediate public
   health importance because of their recognized infectivity in humans.},

Abstract = {Studies on cyclopentenone prostaglandins (CPPGs), clavulones and other

   anticancer activity mediated by their cyclopentenone (CP) chemical
   moiety. In this study the cytotoxicity against cancer cells of the model
   compound cyclopent-2-en-1-one (2CP) was investigated. Being a highly
   water soluble small molecule, 2CP could be an ideal candidate to
   overcome pharmacological issues related to drug delivery and
   penetration. Its cytotoxic activity was tested on various melanoma and
   lung cancer cells. Interestingly, 2CP was both cytotoxic and
   pro-apoptotic, more pronounced on melanoma cells, at concentrations in
   the submicromolar range. On melanoma cells its mechanism of action was
   mediated by the mitochondria and the activation of caspase 3.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the case of a 2-year-old English Bulldog with
   severe teratozoospermia that consisted mainly of ``Dag-like{''} defects,
   which is strong coiling of the tail. Although libido, semen volume and
   sperm concentration were normal, sperm motility was 5.0\%, and 93.3\% of
   spermatozoa exhibited morphological abnormalities affecting the tail.
   Transmission electron microscopic examination of the spermatozoa
   revealed strong folding, coiling and fracture of sperm midpieces and
   tails, axonemal defects and the presence of swollen and unevenly
   distributed mitochondria. Taking into account the dog's history and
   examinations and the constantly high percentage of abnormal spermatozoa
   over time, the defect was considered to be genetic in origin.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate by serology and PCR analyses the
   prevalence of Coxiella burnetti infection in ungulates in Spain. Sera
   were collected from red deer (Cervus elaphus; n = 116), roe deer
   (Capreolus capreolus; n = 39), fallow deer (Dama dama; n = 13) and
   cattle (n = 79). Sera were tested for anti-C. burnetii antibody
   detection by means of an immuno-fiuorescence antibody assay (IFA) and C.
   burnetii DNA was amplified by PCR in samples from ungulates that had
   antibodies to phase II antigens. Twenty-nine, 15 and 39 percent of the
   red deer, roe deer and cattle had antibodies against C. burnetii,
   respectively. None of the fallow deer sera tested positive.
   Seroprevalence was statistically higher in farmed than in wild red deer
   and higher in northern than in southern populations, whereas an inverse
   pattern was observed for the roe deer. Most of the seropositive animals
   had only anti-C. burnetii phase II antibodies, thus showing the acute
   nature of infections in the sampled ungulates. These results show that
   C. burnetii circulates in wild ungulates in Spain and suggest that they
   can act as pathogen reservoirs for both domestic animals and humans. (C)

Title = {Brucella abortus strain RB51 vaccine: Immune response after calfhood
   vaccination and field investigation in Italian cattle population},
Journal = {CLINICAL \& DEVELOPMENTAL IMMUNOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Abstract = {Immune response to Brucella abortus strain RB51 vaccine was measured in
   cattle vaccinated at calfhood. After an increase at day 6
   post-vaccination (pv), the antibody level recorded in the 10 vaccinated
   animals remained constant for two months, and then progressively
   decreased. All vaccinated animals remained negative from day 162 pv to
   the end of the study (day 300 pv). Only at days 13 and 14 pv the
   RB51-CFT showed 100\% sensitivity (credibility interval (CI)
   76.2\%-100\%). The results indicate that the possibility to use RB51-CFT
   for the identification of cattle vaccinated at calfhood with RB51 is
   limited in time. A field investigation was carried out on 26,975 sera
   collected on regional basis from the Italian cattle population. The
   study outcomes indicate that in case of RB51-CFT positive results
   observed in officially Brucellosis-free (OBF) areas and, in any case,
   when an illegal use of RB51 vaccine is suspected, the use of the
   RB51-CFT alone is not sufficient to identify all the vaccinated animals.
   The design of a more sophisticated diagnostic protocol including an
   epidemiological investigation, the use of RB51-CFT, and the use of the
   skin test with RB51 as antigen is deemed more appropriate for the
   identification of RB51 vaccinated animals. Copyright (C) 2008.},

Abstract = {Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses cause viraemia and
   systemic infections with virus replication in internal organs and
   muscles; in contrast, low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses
   produce mild infections with low mortality rates and local virus
   replication. There is little available information on the ability of
   LPAI viruses to cause viraemia or on the presence of avian influenza
   viruses in general in the muscles of infected turkeys. The aim of the
   present study was to determine the ability of LPAI and HPAI H7N1 viruses
   to reach muscle tissues following experimental infection and to
   determine the efficacy of vaccination in preventing viraemia and meat
   localization. The potential of infective muscle tissue to act as a
   source of infection for susceptible turkeys by mimicking the practice of
   swill-feeding was also investigated. The HPAI virus was isolated from
   blood and muscle tissues of all unvaccinated turkeys; LPAI could be
   isolated only from blood of one bird and could be detected only by
   reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in muscles. In contrast,
   no viable virus or viral RNA could be detected in muscles of
   vaccinated/challenged turkeys, indicating that viral localization in
   muscle tissue is prevented in vaccinated birds.},

   and DNA (polymerase chain reaction {[}PCR]; N = 2788) tests were
   conducted on horse, donkey, cattle, sheep, goat, pig, dog, cat, roe
   deer, wild boar, human, and tick samples. The results reported herein
   suggested that in Sicily cattle are a major reservoir for A. marginale,
   dogs for A. platys, and sheep and goats for A. ovis. Domestic animals,
   such as cattle, horses, donkeys, sheep, dogs, and cats, may serve as
   reservoir for A. phagocytophilum, but different strains may infect
   ruminants and humans. All Anaplasma spp. characterized in Sicily had
   some distinctive genotypes for this region. Low genetic diversity was
   observed in A. ovis and A. platys, whereas A. marginale and A.
   phagocytophilum strains showed high genetic diversity. These results
   expanded our knowledge about the prevalence of Anaplasma spp. in Sicily
   and provided information to understand the epidemiology of these
   infections and implement measures to diagnose, treat, and control
   transmission to humans and animals in this region.},

Abstract = {An entomological survey was conducted on phlebotomine sand flies to
   discover the presence of Leishmania parasites in six Sicilian provinces.
   During the season from June to October 2005, 20,346 sand fly specimens
   were collected by using a ``black light{''} trap in eight cattle and
   sheep farms. The most prevalent species was Phlebotomus perfiliewi
   (51.60\%) followed by P. perniciosus (24.37\%), and Sergentomyia minuta
   (24.03\%). Among the 11,441 females collected, 284 (2.70\%) were gravid
   and 708 (6.74\%) were blood-fed females. A total of 194 gravid females,
   274 blood-fed females, and 254 females with no evidence of blood meal
   were analyzed for L. infantum by PCR analysis, showing 9.79\% gravid
   females, 5.84\% blood-fed females, and 5.51\% females with no evidence
   of blood meal positive for Leishmania DNA. These results support the use
   of gravid female sand flies for the evaluation of prevalence of
   Leishmania.},

Abstract = {The objective of this paper was to investigate the prion protein (PrP)
   genotype and haplotype frequencies in three Sicilian dairy sheep
   populations. The three populations were: (1) 1096 Valle del Belice
   animals, (2) 1143 Comisana animals, and (3) 1771 individuals from 5
   flocks with scrapie outbreaks, in which the animals were crossbreds
   derived from indigenous Sicilian dairy breeds. PrP genotypes are
   described for the three codons 136 (Alanine or Valine; A, V), 154
   (Histidine or Arginine; H, R), and 171 (Glutamine, Arginine or
   Histidine; Q, R, H) which represent polymorphisms known to be linked
   with scrapie susceptibility. The Valle del Belice haplotype frequencies
   were 32.3\% ARR, 6.5\% AHQ, 1.0\% ARH, 58.8\% ARQ, and 1.4\% VRQ. The
   Comisana frequencies were 39.4\% ARR, 2.9\% AHQ, 2.9\% ARH, 50.9\% ARQ,
   and 3.9\% VRQ. In the flocks with scrapie outbreaks the frequencies were
   32.8\% ARR, 2.4\% AHQ, 1.7\% ARH, 59.1\% ARQ, and 3.9\% VRQ. In all
   three populations ARQ and ARR were the most frequent haplotypes.
   Multiple generations of strong selection will be needed to fixate the
   most resistant ARR haplotype.},

Abstract = {We analysed 33 brown bears from the Romanian Carpathians and the Italian
   Apennines at sequences of the mitochondrial control region and nine
   polymorphic microsatellite loci with regard to genetic variability and
   haplotype distribution. The Italian brown bears were monomorphic for
   mtDNA sequences. The Romanian bears yielded the highest variability
   found so far in this species. Haplotypes of both previously identified
   mtDNA lineages (western and eastern) were found in Romania. In the
   eastern part of the Carpathians western and eastern haplotypes occurred
   sympatrically, the bears from the western part of the mountain range
   only exhibited western-type sequences. This pattern provides evidence of
   a mitochondrial phylogeographic break in the distribution of the eastern
   lineage within the Romanian Carpathians. Conservation implications of
   this finding are discussed. (c) 2007 Deutsche Geselischaft fur

Volume = {150},

Month = {DEC 25},
Abstract = {Culicoides imicola Kieffer (Culicoides, Dipterat: Ceratopogonidae) is
   the principal vector of bluetongue virus (BTV) to ruminant livestock in
   southern Europe. The secondary potential vectors are Culicoides
   obsoletus (Meigen) and Culicoides scoticus Downes and Kettle of the
   Obsoletus Complex, Culicoides pulicaris (Linnaeus) of the Pulicaris
   Complex and Culicoides dewulfi Goetghebuer of the subgenus Avaritia Fox.
   Between 2000 and 2004 > 38,000 light-trap collections were made for
   Culicoides across Italy including the islands of Sardinia and Sicily.
   Mapping of the 100 largest collections of C. imicola and of the
   Obsoletus Complex showed them to be disjunct overlapping in only 2\% of
   the 200 municipalities selected. For each municipality the average
   values were calculated for minimum temperature, aridity index, attitude,
   terrain slope, normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and
   percentage forest cover. A factor analysis identified two principal
   factors ('biotic' and `abiotic') and explained 84\% of the total
   variability; a discriminant analysis classified correctly 87.5\% of the
   observations. The results indicate adult populations of C. imicola to
   occur in more sparsely vegetated habitats that are exposed to full
   sunlight, whereas species of the Obsoletus Complex favour a more shaded
   habitat, with increased green leaf density. Heliophily and umbrophily,
   by shortening or lengthening the respective adult life cycles of these
   two vectors, will likely impact on the ability of each to transmit BTV
   and is discussed in the light of the current outbreak of BTV across the
   Mediterranean Basin. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A spreadsheet population dynamics model was constructed to evaluate the
   impact of female dog sterilization on the domestic dog population for
   the province of Teramo, Italy. Baseline owned dog population structure
   as well as the annual number of births, adoptions, abandonments, and
   purchases were estimated based on regional managed kennel data in
   addition to a telephone questionnaire administered to members of the
   local population. Age- and gender-dependent death rates were based on
   domestic dog life tables. The model predicts that at the current female
   dog sterilization rate of 30\%, the owned dog population will most
   probably continue to increase. After 20 years, a mean annual increase of
   2.6\% (median: 2.5\%, 95\% CI: -3.2\% to 8.8\%) is projected assuming
   that the average age at sterilization is 3 years. A sterilization rate
   of at least 55\% is estimated to be needed to halt population growth if
   the current age structure for female dog sterilization is maintained.
   However, if the province of Teramo were to focus on sterilizing female
   dogs less than I year of age, the required sterilization rate to arrest
   population growth could be reduced to as low as 26\%. (c) 2007 Elsevier

Abstract = {Aims: To evaluate the application of discriminatory multilocus PCR
   procedures for the characterization of Cryptosporidium in samples of
   naturally contaminated bivalve molluscan shellfish.
   Methods and Results: Nucleic acid was extracted from 22 shellfish
   previously identified as contaminated with Cryptosporidium spp. and
   subjected to PCR-based analysis for two independent fragments of the
   Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) gene, three microsatellite
   markers (ML 1, GP 15 and MS 5) and an extra-chromosomal small
   double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Overall, at least one COWP gene fragment
   was amplified from all 22 samples, 21 amplified the dsRNA and 14 at
   least one of the three microsatellite loci. More than one dsRNA or
   microsatellite allele was detected in 50\% of samples. The majority of
   samples were contaminated with Cryptosporidium parvum types circulating
   in both humans and livestock. A novel dsRNA element was identified in
   one sample, which did not amplify any of the three microsatellite loci
   investigated.
   Conclusions: Multilocus analysis of Cryptosporidium can be applied to
   DNA extracted from naturally contaminated shellfish.
   Significance and Impact of Study: This multilocus genetic analysis
   highlights that filter feeder molluscs are a potential source of
   cryptosporidial oocysts, which may be infectious to humans.},

Title = {Genetic and Antigenic Characterization of Infectious Bursal Disease
   Viruses Isolated in Italy During the Period 2002-2005},

Abstract = {During the period 2002-2005, 109 infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV)
   field strains were isolated from bird flocks located in various parts of
   Italy. Out of these strains, 91 were isolated from broilers, 12 from
   pullets, and six from backyard flocks. Forty-two IBDV strains were
   further investigated and characterized on the basis of the geographical
   origin, source, and clinical signs. Antigenic and genetic
   characterizations were carried out using a monoclonal antibody
   (MAb)-based antigen-capture (AC) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   (ELISA) or a virus neutralization assay and a reverse transcription,
   amplification, and direct sequencing of a genome fragment encoding the
   VP2 variable domain. The viruses were compared with reference IBDV
   strains, F52/70 (classical, 1970), 89163 (typical very virulent {[}vv]
   IBDV, 1989), 91168 (antigenically modified vvIBDV, 1991) and 94432
   (antigenically modified vvIBDV, 1994) among others. All 42 strains were
   genetically characterized, and the comparison of their nucleotide
   sequences revealed the presence of six clusters having 100\% identity,
   named group 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Twelve strains, representative of each
   molecular group and/or with interesting amino acid sequence, were also
   antigenically characterized. The antigenic characterization showed six
   strains-151573, 157185 (group1), 192294 (group 2), 77882 (group 3), 217
   (group 4), and 192304-with the profile typical of vvIBDV (lack of
   binding of MAbs 3 and 4). Two strains, 77165 and 204875 (group 6), were
   also related to vvIBDV but did not react with MAb 5. Three isolates
   exhibited a profile of cell culture-adapted viruses and classical
   strains but with some differences: strain 157776 reacted with all MAbs;
   strain 168026 with all MAbs except MAb 4, which weakly neutralized it;
   and strain 72293 with all MAbs except MAb 9, which is rather unusual.
   The last strain, 213622, showed a very uncommon antigenic profile with
   missing or reduced binding of MAbs 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Genetic
   characterization revealed 37 strains identified as vvIBDV viruses
   divided in 26 isolates (including groups 1, 2, 3, and 4) with the four
   amino acids residues typical of vvIBDV (222A, 256I, 294I, 299S) and 11
   isolates (including groups 5, 6, and 213622) with some other amino acid
   exchanges. Four isolates (72293, 168026, 196783, and 222220) presented
   an amino acid sequence closely related to attenuated classical viruses
   whereas the last isolate (157776) exhibited a rather different sequence
   with some mutations typical of vvIBDV and others for cell
   culture-adapted viruses. Results of the antigenic and genetic
   characterization revealed that the majority of viruses (n 5 37) were
   related to vvIBDV strains but, among these, 11 strains presented
   antigenically and genetically modified characteristics and originated,
   in major part, from the area where viruses have been circulating for a
   long time. The remaining viruses (n 5 5) were related but not identical
   to attenuated classical viruses and came from areas where vaccination
   with intermediate strains is applied.},

Title = {Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells in the horse: Isolation, in vitro
   expansion and preliminary identification in view of a possible use in
   the cellular therapy of tendon and ligament injuries},
Journal = {IPPOLOGIA},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {18},

Abstract = {Tendon and ligament injuries are common causes of reduced performances
   among competitive horses. They are slow healing lesions which have the
   tendency to scar; this condition makes the horse vulnerable to further
   injury when it is put back into training. A number of therapies have
   been tried, but none of them demonstrated to provide a complete anatomic
   and functional recovery. There has been considerable interest, recently,
   in the therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) which are
   potentially able to replace the damaged cells in injured tendons and
   ligaments.
   Fat tissue stroma contains an especially high concentration of MSC which
   are. also easy to obtain and to expand in vitro. The results of recent
   clinical studies employing adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells in the
   therapy of horse tendon and ligament injuries encourage their use in
   these applications. However, the lack of studies of characterization of
   these cells in the horse makes empiric their current clinical use.
   Aim of this work is to report preliminary results concerning isolation
   and characterization of a pool of stromal cells from horse adipose
   tissue, similar to those previously described in humans, mice and rats
   as mesenchymal stem cells.
   Cells of the vascular-stromal fraction of equine adipose tissue were
   isolated and grown in vitro. During their expansion, a monolayer of
   adherent, omogeneous and rapidly proliferating cells progressively
   selected. These cells were characterized by the expression of the
   surface antigen CD90 and if diluted to limit concentration, they gave
   rise to fibroblast-like clonal colonies.
   Our preliminary observations strongly suggest that, in the horse adipose
   tissue, a pool of cells does exist showing morphologic, phenotioic and
   growth features very similar to those of MSC described in other species.},

Abstract = {The spread of vector-borne diseases into new areas, commonly attributed
   to environmental change or increased trade and travel, could be
   exacerbated if novel vector species in newly invaded areas spread
   infection beyond the range of traditional vectors.
   By analysing the differential degree of overlap between the
   environmental envelopes for bluetongue, a devastating livestock disease,
   and its traditional (Afro-Asian) and potential new (Palearctic) midge
   vectors, we have implicated the latter in the recent dramatic northward
   spread of this disease into Europe.
   The traditional vector of bluetongue virus, the Afro-Asian midge
   Culicoides imicola, was found to occur in warm (annual mean 12-20
   degrees C), thermally stable locations that were dry in summer (< 400 mm
   precipitation). The Palearctic C. obsoletus and C. pulicaris complexes
   were both found to occur in cooler (down to 7 degrees C annual mean),
   thermally more variable and wetter (up to 700 mm summer precipitation)
   locations.
   Of 501 recorded outbreaks from the 1998-2004 bluetongue epidemic in
   southern Europe, 40\% fall outside the climate envelope of C. imicola,
   but within the species' envelopes of the C. obsoletus and C. pulicaris
   complexes.
   The distribution in multivariate environmental space of bluetongue virus
   is closer to that of the Palaearctic vectors than it is to that of C.
   imicola. This suggests that Palearctic vectors now play a substantial
   role in transmission and have facilitated the spread of bluetongue into
   cooler, wetter regions of Europe.
   Synthesis and applications. The risk to Northern Europe now depends on
   how much of the distributions of the widespread, abundant Palearctic
   midge vectors (the C. obsoletus and C. pulicaris complexes) bluetongue
   can occupy, perhaps determined by thermal constraints on viral
   replication. This was highlighted by the sudden appearance in summer
   2006 of bluetongue virus at latitudes of more than 50 degrees North -
   approximately 6 degrees further North than previous outbreaks in
   southern Europe. Future surveillance for bluetongue and for related
   Culicoides-borne pathogens should include studies to record and explain
   the distributional patterns of all potential Palearctic vector species.},

Abstract = {Lions (Panthera leo) are an endangered species threatened by illegal
   hunting, habitat loss, and infectious diseases. Little is known about
   the tick-borne pathogens that infect lions and could contribute to
   population declines. The objective of this study was to characterize
   Rickettsia spp., Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Coxiella burnetii
   infections in 10 lions from the Fasano Safari Park in Italy by
   serologoy, polymerase chain reaction, and sequence analysis. Although
   animals did not show clinical signs of tick-borne diseases, evidence of
   infection with C. burnetii, spotted fever group Rickettsia sp., and A.
   phagocytophilum were found in 50\%, 20\%. and 10\% of the lions,
   respectively. One of the lions tested positive for all three pathogens.
   This study is the first report of molecular evidence of infection with
   C. burnetii, Rickettsia sp., and A. phagocytophilum in lions and
   provides evidence that these felids become infected and serve as hosts
   for tick-transmitted bacteria.},

Abstract = {Livestock are commonly infected with protozoan parasites of the genera
   Cryptosporidium and Giardia, and some of the species and genotypes found
   in these animals have zoonotic significance. We characterized isolates
   of both parasites recovered from the Italian water buffalo (Bubalus
   bubalis), an economically important species whose milk is used for the
   production of ``buffalo mozzarella{''} fresh cheese. Molecular analysis
   of the Cryptosporidium small subunit ribosomal DNA gene and of the
   Giardia beta-giardin gene shows the presence of both zoonotic parasites
   (Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia duodenalis assemblage A) and
   host-specific parasites (G. duodenalis assemblage E), suggesting that
   water buffaloes can contribute to environmental contamination with
   oocysts and cysts potentially infectious to humans if their faeces are
   improperly disposed of. On the other hand, mozzarella cheese is probably
   a safe product, given that its production involves the treatment of
   cheese curd at 85-95 degrees C, which is likely to kill or inactivate

Abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes has been detected in fresh as well as dry and
   semidry fermented sausages, rendering preparation and consumption of
   these products as a potential risk to human health. The aims of this
   study were (1) to evaluate the L. monocytogenes prevalence in 288 fresh
   and 237 fermented sausages produced in northern Italy; (2) to quantify
   the average pathogen Most Probable Number (MPN) per g of sausage; (3) to
   evaluate the sausage strain genetic diversity by automated PvuII
   ribotyping; and (4) to predict the pathogenicity lineage of these
   isolates determining their DuPont Identification Library Codes (DUP-IDs)
   by EcoRI ribotyping.
   The overall prevalence of L. monocytogenes in the sampled sausages was
   28.2\%. The percentage of L. monocytogenes positive fresh sausages was
   significantly higher than that of fermented sausages (i.e. 38.9 vs
   15.2\%), which had a pathogen load always lower than 10 MPN/g. In
   contrast, 16.1\% of fresh sausages were contaminated by 10 to 100 MPN/g
   and 20.5\% had more than 100 MPN/g.
   PvuII successfully discriminated sausage isolates with a Simpson's
   numerical index of discrimination of 0.637. A total of 12 and 9
   different PvuII ribogroups were identified among 47 fresh and 24
   fermented randomly selected sausage strains, respectively. Six of those
   ribogroups were shared between strains contaminating both kinds of
   sausages. According to the evaluation of the strain DUP-IDs, the
   majority of the isolates investigated in this study were part of the
   type II L. monocytogenes pathogenicity lineage, but type I lineage
   strains were identified among fermented sausage isolates.
   In conclusion, L. monocytogenes prevalence in Italian sausages was
   estimated to be around 28.2\%. However, 84.2\% of the samples were
   contaminated by less than 100 MPN of L. monocytogenes per g and the
   majority of L. monocytogenes contaminating strains would be classified
   in the type II pathogenicity lineage, including serotypes 1/2a, 1/2c and
   3a. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A cross-sectional serological survey was conducted in order to evaluate,
   irrespective of abortion, the Toxoplasma gondii infection in pastured
   sheep from the Campania region of southern Italy. A geographical
   information system was used in order to uniformly sample the ovine farms
   (n = 117) throughout the entire region. Blood and milk samples were
   collected from 10 adult sheeps (> 18 months) on each farm (total number
   = 1170 sheeps). Serum samples were tested for the presence of IgG
   antibodies to T gondii using a commercial indirect fluorescent antibody
   test. For each farm, the 10 milk samples collected were pooled in order
   to obtain a single milk sample per farm (total number = 117 milk
   samples). The 77.8\% (91/117) of the farms and the 28.5\% (333/ 11, 170)
   of the sheep resulted positive by serology. In addition, the presence of
   T gondii DNA was detected by PCR in 4 milk samples out of the 117
   examined (3.4\%). (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   entomological samplings were carried out in four sites within the Lazio

   and Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1894). Dirofilaria immitis Leidy DNA, D.
   repens DNA, or both were found in the head and thorax of both
   mosquitoes. The simultaneous presence of vectors showing diurnal and
   nocturnal activity patterns is of concern for animal and human health.
   The finding of D. immitis DNA in mosquitoes in areas where only D.
   repens was been recovered in dogs also demonstrates that this filarial
   parasite circulates among carnivores (wild or domesticated pets).},

Title = {Serological study of small ruminant lentivirus in goats in Italy},
Journal = {SMALL RUMINANT RESEARCH},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {73},
Number = {1-3},
Pages = {169-173},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Objective: To determine seroprevalence of small ruminant lentivirus
   (SRLV) infections among goats in South Tyrol, Italy.
   Design: Prospective serological study.
   Material and methods-animals: 15,980 goats older than 6 months from 1973
   goat herds in South Tyrol were tested by an ELISA for the presence of
   SRLV antibodies. 3148 goats were 6-14 months old (AG 1), 3273 goats were
   15 to 26 months old (AG 2) and 9559 goats were older than 26 months (AG
   3).
   Results: Serological examination revealed that seroprevalence of SRLV
   among goats was 23.6\% and herd prevalence was 38.0\%. Seroprevalence
   was significantly higher (P < 0.002) in AG 3 (25.1\%) than among goats
   in AG 1 (20.6\%) and AG 2 (20.0\%), respectively. Seroprevalence of
   dwarf goats was significantly (P<0.001) lower (4.0\%) when compared with
   the indigenous, mainly prevalent breed ``Passeirer Goat{''} (24.6\%),
   dairy breed (25.6\%) and mixed breed (10.7\%). Seroprevalence was
   significantly higher (P<0.001) among goats born indoors (November-April:
   24.2\%) than in the animals born outdoors (May-October: 20.0\%).
   Seroprevalence among female goats (23.6\%) did not differ significantly
   from male goats (23.7\%).
   Conclusions and clinical relevance: SRLV infections among goats in South
   Tyrol, Italy, are evident. Birth indoors with its consequences (close
   contact, kids suckling by diverse dams or by milk pool) is also a risk
   factor for SRLV infections in South Tyrol. In future more clinical
   outbreaks may occur, and therefore establishing measures to prevent the
   spreading of the disease is necessary. Installing a control or
   eradication programme seroprevalence and genetic and economic aspects
   must be considered. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Two hundred hair/skin samples were collected from 2002 to 2004 from two
   groups of cats (privately owned and stray cats from a shelter) and 165
   samples were obtained during the same period from persons in whom
   dermatophyte infection was highly suspected. The epidemiological data
   were statistically evaluated. Thirteen of the 100 privately owned cats
   (13\%) and 100\% of the stray cats were positive; of the 165 human
   samples examined 109 (66\%) were positive for dermatophytes. Microsporum
   canis was the most common dermatophyte isolated in both cat groups while
   Trichophyton mentagrophytes was the most common in humans.
   Interestingly, a geophylic dermatophyte species (Microsporum gypseum)
   was found to be present and associated with clinical signs. Living in
   the countryside proved to be a risk factor for dermatophytoses in
   privately owned cats while in humans the main risk factor for M. canis
   was contact with animals followed by young age. None of the variables
   considered was associated with positivity for T. mentagrophytes while
   positivity for other fungi was correlated with life in the countryside.},

Abstract = {The microbial ecology of 22 samples of commercially available Ciauscolo
   salami were investigated using a polyphasic approach, based on
   culture-dependent and -independent techniques. The viable counts of
   pathogen and hygiene indicator microorganisms highlighted the adequate
   application of good manufacturing practices, while the viable counts of
   the lactic acid bacteria, coagulase negative cocci, and yeasts showed
   dominance of the first of these microbial groups. Bacterial and fungal
   DNA were extracted directly from the salami and amplified by PCR, using
   two primer sets targeting the 16S and 28S rRNA genes, respectively.
   Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequencing of
   selected bands were used to investigate the microbial ecology of these
   Ciauscolo salami. The most frequently found bacterial species were
   Lactobacillus sakei and Lb. curvatus, while Debaryomyces hansenii was
   the prevalent yeast species detected. Cluster analysis of the DGGE
   profiles and calculation of biodiversity indices allowed the degree of
   microbial similarity across these salami to be determined. (c) 2007

Month = {OCT 25},
Abstract = {Evidence for a possible zoonotic role of group C rotaviruses (GCRVs) has
   been recently provided. To gain information on the genetic relationships
   between human and animal GCRVs, we sequenced the VP7 gene of 10 porcine
   strains detected during a large surveillance study from different
   outbreaks of gastroemeritis in piglets. Four GCRV strains were
   genetically related to the prototype GCRV porcine Cowden strain. A
   completely new VP7 genotype included 4 strains (344/04-7-like) that
   shared 92.5\% to 97.0\% aa identity to each other, but < 83\% to human
   GCRVs and < 79\% to other porcine and bovine GCRVs. A unique 4-aa
   insertion (SSSV or SSTI), within a variable region at the
   carboxy-terminus of VP7, represented a distinctive feature for these 4
   unique strains. An additional strain, 134/04-18, was clearly different
   from all human and animal GCRVs (< 85\% aa identity) and likely accounts
   for a distinct VP7 genotype. The VP7 of a unique strain, 42/05-21,
   shared similar ranges of aa sequence identities with porcine and human
   strains (88.0-90.7\% to porcine GCRVs and 85.2-88.2\% to human GCRVs).
   Plotting the VP7 gene of strain 42/05-21 against the VP7 of human and
   porcine strains revealed discontinuous evolution rates throughout the

Title = {Direct Detection of Soil-Bound Prions},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {2},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {Scrapie and chronic wasting disease are contagious prion diseases
   affecting sheep and cervids, respectively. Studies have indicated that
   horizontal transmission is important in sustaining these epidemics, and
   that environmental contamination plays an important role in this. In the
   perspective of detecting prions in soil samples from the field by more
   direct methods than animal-based bioassays, we have developed a novel
   immuno-based approach that visualises in situ the major component
   (PrPSc) of prions sorbed onto agricultural soil particles. Importantly,
   the protocol needs no extraction of the protein from soil. Using a
   cell-based assay of infectivity, we also report that samples of
   agricultural soil, or quartz sand, acquire prion infectivity after
   exposure to whole brain homogenates from prion-infected mice. Our data
   provide further support to the notion that prion-exposed soils retain
   infectivity, as recently determined in Syrian hamsters intracerebrally
   or orally challanged with contaminated soils. The cell approach of the
   potential infectivity of contaminated soil is faster and cheaper than
   classical animal-based bioassays. Although it suffers from limitations,
   e. g. it can currently test only a few mouse prion strains, the cell
   model can nevertheless be applied in its present form to understand how
   soil composition influences infectivity, and to test prion-inactivating
   procedures.},

Title = {Transmission parameters of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H7N1)
   among industrial poultry farms in northern Italy in 1999-2000},

Year = {2007},
Volume = {81},

Month = {OCT 16},
Abstract = {We estimated between-farm transmission parameters of the highly
   pathogenic avian-influenza (HPAI) epidemic that struck the poultry
   industry of northern Italy (including turkeys, layer hens, broilers,
   gamebirds, and waterfowl) from December 1999 through April 2000. We
   estimated the average number of susceptible farms that were infected
   with HPAI virus by each infectious farm during a day (beta) with a
   generalised linear model (GLM). The HPAI's reproductive ratios (R-h; the
   average number of new infected farms (IFs) that were caused by an
   infectious farm) were calculated separately for the regions of Lombardy
   and Veneto, where 382 out of 413 (92.5\%) of IFs were located. In both
   regions, R-h decreased to similar to 1 during the second month of the
   epidemic (showing that its containment had been initiated).
   Subsequently, during the last two months of the epidemic, beta and R-h
   were reduced to 0.04/day and 0.6, respectively, in Veneto and to
   0.07/day and 0.8 in Lombardy. The reduction of the susceptible
   population through strict control measures, including pre-emptive
   slaughter of at-risk poultry flocks, was implemented to a greatest
   extent in Veneto and this might have been associated with a more rapid
   control of the epidemic in this region than in Lombardy. (C) 2007

Abstract = {The diagnostic performance of six foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) assays
   for detection of antibodies to the non-structural proteins (NSP) of the
   FMD virus (FMDV) was estimated using a Bayesian analysis on field sera
   from cattle of unknown infection status originating from post-FMDV
   outbreak situations in Israel and Zimbabwe. Estimations of the disease
   prevalence in both populations were also obtained. The diagnostic
   sensitivity estimates did not differ between both field studies,
   although overall Bayesian estimates were markedly higher than those
   previously reported based on sera from comparable experimentally
   infected (vaccinated) cattle populations. All NSP-based assays
   demonstrated a lower diagnostic specificity when applied to the
   Zimbabwean sera compared to both published specificities and similar
   Bayesian specificity estimates derived for the Israeli dataset. In
   Israel, the disease prevalence was estimated at 23.9\% (95\% credibility
   interval: 19.5-28.8\%), whereas 65.4\% (59.0-72.5\%) was found in
   Zimbabwe. The need for reliable diagnostic test performance estimates
   and the benefits of Bayesian analysis in obtaining them are also
   addressed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A pandemic strain of calicivirus threatens rabbit industries in the
   Americas},
Journal = {VIROLOGY JOURNAL},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {4},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease (RHD) is a severe acute viral disease
   specifically affecting the European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus. As the
   European rabbit is the predominant species of domestic rabbit throughout
   the world, RHD contributes towards significant losses to rabbit farming
   industries and endangers wild populations of rabbits in Europe and other
   predatory animals in Europe that depend upon rabbits as a food source.
   Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease virus (RHDV) - a Lagovirus belonging to the
   family Caliciviridae is the etiological agent of RHD. Typically, RHD
   presents with sudden death in 70\% to 95\% of infected animals. There
   have been four separate incursions of RHDV in the USA, the most recent
   of which occurred in the state of Indiana in June of 2005. Animal
   inoculation studies confirmed the pathogenicity of the Indiana 2005
   isolate, which caused acute death and pathological changes characterized
   by acute diffuse severe liver necrosis and pulmonary hemorrhages.
   Complete viral genome sequences of all USA outbreak isolates were
   determined and comparative genomics revealed that each outbreak was the
   result of a separate introduction of virus rather than from a single
   virus lineage. All of the USA isolates clustered with RHDV genomes from
   China, and phylogenetic analysis of the major capsid protein (VP60)
   revealed that they were related to a pandemic antigenic variant strain
   known as RHDVa. Rapid spread of the RHDVa pandemic suggests a selective
   advantage for this new subtype. Given its rapid spread, pathogenic
   nature, and potential to further evolve, possibly broadening its host
   range to include other genera native to the Americas, RHDVa should be
   regarded as a threat.},

Abstract = {Aflatoxin B-1, a common occurring type of aflatoxin in feed, is a potent
   cancer-causing agent. Lactating cows fed with aflatoxin-contaminated
   feed trasmit the toxin, as the metabolic form aflatoxin M-1, into the
   milk with high risk for consumers. The aim of this study is to determine
   the contamination degree of raw milk and feed in Valle d'Aosta region.
   From the beginning of 2004 to the end of 2005 samples of raw cow's milk
   and cattle feed has been analysed: in 2004, the presence of aflatoxin M1
   in milk and B1 in feed was higher than the maximum allowable in 1.7\% of
   raw milk samples and in 8.1\% of feed samples. In 2005 the presence of
   these aflatoxins are below the limits of EU regulations.
   The samples were analysed with an ELISA immunoassay, used as screening
   test, and the positive samples were confirmed by the HPLC analysis. (c)

Abstract = {Cryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium hominis isolates from
   sporadic, drinking water-associated, and intrafamilial human cases
   together with C. parpum isolates from sporadic cases in livestock were
   collected in the United Kingdom between 1995 and 1999. The isolates were
   characterized by analysis of three microsatellite markers (ML1, GP15,
   and MS5) using PCR amplification. Within C. hominis, four alleles were
   detected within the GP15 and MS5 loci, and a single type was detected
   with MLL C. parvum was more polymorphic; 12 alleles were detected with
   GP15, 6 were detected with MS5, and 3 were detected with MLL Multilocus
   analysis of polymorphisms within the three microsatellite loci was
   combined with those reported previously for an extrachromosomal small
   double-stranded RNA. Forty multilocus types were detected within these
   two species: 9 were detected in C. hominis, and 31 were detected in C.
   parvum. In C. hominis, heterogeneity was almost exclusively found in
   samples from sporadic cases.Similarity analysis identified three main
   groups within C. parpum, and the group that predominated in human
   infection was also found in livestock. Multilocus types of C. parvum
   previously identified only in humans were not detected in livestock.
   Isolates of both C. hominis and C. parvum from separate waterborne
   outbreaks were genetically homogeneous, suggesting preferential or point
   source transmission of certain types of these two species of parasites.},

Title = {Effect of lairage duration on some blood constituents and beef quality
   in bulls after long journey},
Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Pages = {375-384},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {With the aim to contribute to the determination of an adequate resting
   time for cattle after long transportation, the effects of different
   lairage times on some haematic parameters and meat quality of bulls
   subjected to long commercial journeys were investigated. Thirty-nine
   Limousine bulls supplied by one farm located near to Saragoza (Spain)
   were examined after 5 consignments at the final destination, following a
   journey of 2,550 km to the ``San Giorgio{''} abattoir (Palermo, Italy).
   Transport time was of 53.6 +/- 10.9h; lairage duration for bulls of the
   1(st), 3(rd) and 5(th) consignments was of 31h on average ({''}Short
   Lairage{''} group), whereas, for those of the 2(nd) and 4(th)
   consignments, was of 59 and 57h, respectively ({''}Long Lairage{''}
   group). As regards the blood cell counts, data showed a significant
   effect (P<0.001) of the lairage duration on leukocyte and platelet
   counts. No significant effect was observed for erythrocyte count,
   haemoglobin and hematocrit in relation to the lairage duration, although
   the repeated measure analysis of variance showed that, irrespective of
   lairage duration, the hematocrit increased significantly between
   unloading and slaughter. Haematological parameters showed a significant
   (P<0.05) effect of the lairage time only on CK and Cortisol. CK enzyme
   showed an increase in the ``Short Lairage{''} group (33.2\% vs. 14.3\%)
   whereas, Cortisol showed a decrease in the ``Long Lairage{''} group
   (36.3\% vs. 3.8\%). The different lairage duration did not significantly
   (P>0.05) affect the incidence of slight and severe carcass bruises. As
   regards meat quality, lairage duration significantly influenced the pH.
   which was higher (P<0.01) in the muscle of the ``Long Lairage{''} group,
   the luminosity at 24h post mortem which was significantly higher
   (P<0.05) in animals of the ``Short Lairage{''} group, and the red and
   yellow indices which were higher in the ``Long Lairage{''} group. The
   ``Short Lairage{''} group showed a lower (P<0.01) value of cooking loss
   and higher (P<0.01) value of tenderness. Data show that pre-slaughter
   lairage duration after a long transport may influence the blood
   parameters as well as meat quality. On the whole, the increase in
   lairage duration over 36h does not determine any benefit for the
   animal's well-being whereas it can cause a reduction in beef quality.
   For very long transports, it would be better to have an adequate
   organisation of the facilities in order to diminish the pre-slaughter
   lairage duration.},

Abstract = {Aims: The aim of this study was to develop a rapid, sensitive, specific
   tool for detection and quantification of Mycoplasma agalactiae DNA in
   sheep milk samples.
   Methods and Results: A real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay
   targeting the membrane-protein 81 gene of M. agalactiae was developed.
   The assay specifically detected M. agalactiae DNA without
   cross-amplification of other mycoplasmas and common pathogens of small
   ruminants. The method was reproducible and highly sensitive, providing
   precise quantification of M. agalactiae DNA over a range of nine orders
   of magnitude. Compared with an established PCR assay, the real-time PCR
   was one-log more sensitive, detecting as few as 10(1) DNA copies per 10
   mu l of plasmid template and 6.5 x 10(0) colour changing units of
   reference strain Ba/2.
   Conclusions: The real-time PCR assay is a reliable method for the
   detection and quantification of M. agalactiae DNA in sheep milk samples.
   The assay is more sensitive than gel-based PCR protocols and provides
   quantification of the M. agalactiae DNA contained in milk samples. The
   assay is also quicker than traditional culture methods (2-3 h compared
   with at least 1 week).
   Significance and Impact of the Study: The established real-time PCR
   assay will help study the patterns of shedding of M. agalactiae in milk,
   aiding pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy studies.},

Abstract = {The enteric nervous system (ENS) probably plays a dominant role in sheep
   scrapie pathogenesis, but little is known about the cell types involved.
   We investigated the ileal myenteric and submucosal plexuses of four
   naturally and four orally experimentally scrap i e-affected ARQ/ARQ
   Sarda sheep, as well as those of 12 healthy-control Sarda sheep carrying
   different PrP genotypes. All scrapie-affected animals, euthanized at
   clinical-disease end stage, showed PrPd deposition within enteric glial
   cells (EGCs) and calbindin-immunoreactive (CALB-IR) and neuronal nitric
   oxide synthase (nNOS)-IR neurons. Whole-mount investigations revealed no
   significant differences between the densities of total, CALB-IR and
   nNOS-IR neurons in scrapie-affected versus healthy sheep, irrespective
   of PrP genotype. Our results suggest that EGCs and CALB-IR and nNOS-IR
   neurons are probably involved in the pathogenesis of natural and oral
   experimental sheep scrapie. Furthermore, the infectious agent may be
   less pathogenic towards ENS neurons than it is towards central nervous
   system neurons.},

Title = {Onset of puberty in Maremmana heifers},
Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Pages = {385-394},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {The Maremmana breed is characterised by rusticity, resistance to harsh
   environments and good growth ability and it could be considered as one
   of the most suited breeds for extensive rearing in Italy. Moreover,
   Maremmana presents high fertility and good fostering ability but, on the
   other hand, the age at first calving appears quite high. This could
   probably be due to reduced feed availability to which animals are
   frequently subjected. The aim of this paper was to determine the age at
   puberty in Maremmana heifers, the repeatability of the reproductive
   cycles along the seasons and to verify the possibility to anticipate the
   age at first service. Haematic levels of progesterone and
   17-beta-estradiol were determined weekly in 6 heifers raised in pens and
   fed with 0.70 Milk FU/kg DM and 121 g of gross protein/kg d.m, starting
   from 9 up to 25 months of age. Metabolic profile was determined monthly
   to highlight possible metabolic unbalances that could affect
   reproductive activity.
   Plasma was submitted to RIA analysis in order to measure steroidal
   hormones. Puberty was considered reached when two subsequent measures of
   progesterone resulted higher than 1 ng/ml of plasma. This happened in 5
   out of 6 heifers at an average age of 17 months. The fluctuation of the
   hormonal levels throughout the year seems to exclude the seasonality of
   the oestrous cycle. The results showed that the level of the most
   important metabolites is within the normal range and it does not seem to
   interfere with the choice to anticipate the first service by one year.
   Possible periods of anoestrus noticed in some herds could be linked to
   the reduced availability of pastures in a few months of the year.},

Title = {Molecular and cellular determinants of cell-to-cell transmission of HCV

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY},
Year = {2007},

Abstract = {It was reported previously that HCV can be transmitted from persistently
   infected human bone-marrow-derived B-lymphoblastoid cells (TO.FEHCV) to
   human hepatoma cells by cell-to-cell contact. The present study confirms
   and characterize further such type of HCV infection in vitro. TO.FEHCV
   cells were co-cultured with 2.2.15 hepatoma cells, that are not
   susceptible to cell-free infection by sera containing HCV of 1b
   genotype. By this co-cultivation system it was demonstrated that HCV
   transmission to recipient cells requires de novo virus RNA replication.
   Several factors may favor HCV-transmission, evidence is provided that
   TO.FEHCV cells were able to select HCV-quasispecies. 5'-UTR and core
   sequence analysis revealed differences in the HCV-quasispecies
   composition in serum inoculum and in infected TO.FE B-cells at 4 months
   post-inoculation. It is considered that the latter may be more
   successful in replicating HCV in vitro and used to express surface
   molecules which may be involved in cell-to-cell contact, In TO.FEHCV
   cells replicate distinct, or few close related, HCV-variants correlated
   with those of serum inoculum. Comparative analysis of tetraspans and
   integrins expression undertaken by cytofluorimetry displayed higher
   level of expression for TO.FE cells in comparison to other human
   bone-marrow-derived B-cell lines. Overall, the observed persistent in
   vitro HCV replication is mediated by a continuous cell-to-cell
   reinfection that may be favored by selection of viral variants and
   expression of molecules involved in cell adhesion. These observations
   may provide an explanation for the establishment of HCV infection, the
   occurrence of chronic infection and HCV-related lymphoproliferative

Abstract = {Histamine formation in Sardina pilchardus and Engraulis encrasicolus as
   a function of storage temperature was studied. Fish were caught off the
   Adriatic Coast and were carried immediately to the laboratory. A portion
   of dorsal muscle from each fish was soon analyzed, while two other
   portions were examined after storage at two different temperatures (25
   and 4C) for 24 and 72 h, respectively. The analyses were carried out by
   high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-UV and confirmed by
   HPLC-diode array detector. Histamine concentrations were always higher
   than the European Community admissible levels in samples stored at 25C.
   In fish stored at 4C, histamine was detected only in E. encrasicolus.},

Abstract = {Because no suitable products are at the moment available to safely
   control the spread of BTV-16 in Europe, an inactivated vaccine was
   produced from the reference field isolate of bluetongue virus serotype
   16. One group of six sheep was vaccinated subcutaneously with the
   inactivated vaccine twice, on days 0 and 28, whereas a second group of
   eight sheep was inoculated with saline solution and used as
   mock-vaccinated control animals. Seventy-eight days after the first
   vaccination, all sheep were inoculated subcutaneously with a suspension
   containing 10(6.3) TCID50 of a virulent reference BTV-16 isolate. Apart
   from a transient inflammatory reaction at the injection site, no adverse
   effects were reported following vaccination. All vaccinated animals
   developed high titres (7.3-9.3 log(2)(ED50\%/50 mu l)) of virus-specific
   neutralising antibodies and were resistant to challenge with BTV-16.
   Conversely, following challenge, control animals developed hyperthermia
   and long lasting high-titre viraemia. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Verocytotoxin -producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) non-O157 serogroups are
   among the most important emerging food-borne pathogen groups. In
   particular, the 026 serogroup is able to cause a large spectrum of
   illnesses in humans which have a significant public health impact as
   they may range from haemorrhagic colitis (HC) to haemolytic uremic
   syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). It is
   known that VTEC organisms are associated with animal reservoirs, i.e.
   ruminants, and foods of animal origin, especially undercooked meat and
   raw milk, are often involved in outbreaks. In this study, 250 minced
   beef samples collected at retail outlets in southern Italy were tested
   for the presence of E. coli 026 and the isolates were characterized and
   studied for their antimicrobial resistance properties. Three minced beef
   samples (1.2\%) tested positive for E. coli 026; one isolate per
   positive sample was characterized. One isolate harboured the genes
   encoding for virulence factors intimin (eaeA) and enterohaemolysin
   (hlyA), while none presented verocytotoxin-encoding genes (stx1 and
   stx2) and all were negative at the verotoxicity assay. All the isolates
   showed resistance properties to at least four antimicrobial agents
   tested and two were multidrug resistant (MDR).
   Although no verocytotoxin-encoding genes were found in the isolates, the
   presence of potentially pathogenic E. coli 026 strains in minced beef
   points to the need for proper hygiene during meat production to reduce
   the risk of food-borne illnesses and transmission of MDR organisms via
   foods to humans. This paper is the first report on the presence and
   characterization of E. coli 026 in minced beef marketed in Italy. (C)

Abstract = {Risk analysis has only been regularly used in the management of aquatic
   animal health in recent years. The Agreement on the Application of
   Sanitary and Phytosanitary measures (SPS) stimulated the application of
   risk analysis to investigate disease risks associated with international
   trade (import risk analysis-IRA). A majority (9 of 17) of the risk
   analyses reviewed were IRA. The other major focus has been the parasite
   of Atlantic salmon-Gyrodactylus salaris. Six studies investigated the
   spread of this parasite, between countries, rivers and from farmed to
   wild stocks, and clearly demonstrated that risk analysis can support
   aquatic animal health policy development, from international trade and
   biosecurity to disease interaction between wild and farmed stocks. Other
   applications of risk analysis included the spread of vertically
   transmitted pathogens and disease emergence in aquaculture. The
   Covello-Merkhofer, risk analysis model was most commonly used and
   appears to be a flexible tool not only for IRA but also the
   investigation of disease spread in other contexts. The limitations of
   the identified risk assessments were discussed. A majority were
   qualitative, partly due to the lack of data for quantitative analysis,
   and this, it can be argued, constrained their usefulness for trade
   purposes (i.e. setting appropriate sanitary measures); in other
   instances, a qualitative result was found to be adequate for decision
   making. A lack of information about the disease hazards of the large
   number of fish species traded is likely to constrain quantitative
   analysis for a number of years. The consequence assessment element of a
   risk analysis was most likely to be omitted, or limited in scope and
   depth, rarely extending beyond examining the evidence of susceptibility
   of farmed and wild species to the identified hazard. The reasons for
   this are discussed and recommendations made to develop guidelines for a
   consistent, systematic and multi-disciplinary approach to consequence
   assessment. Risk analysis has improved decision making in aquatic animal
   health management by providing a transparent method for using the
   available scientific information. The lack of data is the main
   constraint to the application of risk analysis in aquatic animal health.
   The identification of critical parameters is an important output from
   risk analysis models which should be used to prioritise research. (c)

Month = {SEP 12},
Abstract = {Prions have been documented in extra-neuronal and extra-lymphatic
   tissues of humans and various ruminants affected by Transmissible
   Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE). The presence of prion infectivity
   detected in cervid and ovine blood tempted us to reason that kidney, the
   organ filtrating blood derived proteins, may accumulate disease
   associated PrP(Sc). We collected and screened kidneys of experimentally,
   naturally scrapie-affected and control sheep for renal deposition of
   PrP(Sc) from distinct, geographically separated flocks. By performing
   Western blot, PET blot analysis and immunohistochemistry we found
   intraepithelial (cortex, medulla and papilla) and occasional
   interstitial (papilla) deposition of PrP(Sc) in kidneys of
   scrapie-affected sheep. Interestingly, glomerula lacked detectable
   signals indicative of PrP(Sc). PrP(Sc) was also detected in kidneys of
   subclinical sheep, but to significantly lower degree. Depending on the
   stage of the disease the incidence of PrP(Sc) in kidney varied from
   approximately 27\% (subclinical) to 73.6\% (clinical) in naturally
   scrapie-affected sheep. Kidneys from flocks without scrapie outbreak
   were devoid of PrP(Sc). Here we demonstrate unexpectedly frequent
   deposition of high levels of PrP(Sc) in ovine kidneys of various flocks.
   Renal deposition of PrP(Sc) is likely to be a pre-requisite enabling
   prionuria, a possible co-factor of horizontal prion-transmission in
   sheep.},

Abstract = {The aim of our work was to evaluate a new commercial test kit for the
   detection of Listeria monocytogenes by PCR, using different DNA
   extraction methods. Food samples (pork sausage and ``mozzarella{''}
   cheese) were spiked with known concentrations of L. monocylogenes and
   culture-enriched for 24 It. DNA extracted using three commercial kits
   and two standard methods, was amplified in species-specific PCR
   employing a L. monocytogenes PCR Detection Kit (Diatheva). The PCR-based
   method proved to be a reliable means of detecting the pathogen in food
   samples independently from the extraction procedure used, even for a
   contamination cell number of 1 cfa/g before culture enrichment. The
   molecular assay, showing perfect agreement with standard microbiological
   tests and a considerably shortened analysis time, provides a sensitive
   and rapid alternative for applications in the testing of foods for
   microbiological contamination, and highlights the potential of PCR
   technology in routine food control. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {81},

Abstract = {The composition of the abomasal helminth fauna and parasite diversity
   were studied in 298 red deer collected during 1997-2000 from three
   different sectors (Bolzano, Trento and Sondrio provinces) of the Stelvio
   National Park, one of the main protected areas of north-eastern Italy.
   The association between parasite burdens and geographical areas of the
   hosts was assessed using the negative binomial regression. A variety of
   abomasal helminths, both host specific and generalist, was found in all
   sectors. The most commonly observed parasites were the Spiculopteragia
   spiculoptera morph spiculoptera and Ostertagia leptospicularis morph
   leptospicularis, with prevalences of 79.5\% and 40.9\%, respectively.
   The minor morphs S. spiculoptera morph mathevossiani (prevalence 31.9\%)
   and O. leptospicularis morph kolchida (18.8\%) occurred at lower
   prevalences. Teladorsagia circumcincta morph circumcincta, Marshallagia
   marshalli morph marshalli and Haemonchus contortus were rarer, at
   prevalences of 1, 1.3 and 1.3\%, respectively. Deviance analysis of the
   negative binomial regression model shows that the geographical area is
   significantly related to parasite burdens (P = 0.001). Prevalences of
   hosts with parasites were greater in the Sondrio (odds ratio = 1.31;
   95\% confidence interval: 0.16-10.85) and smaller in the Trento (odds
   ratio = 0.62; 95\% confidence interval: 0.20-1.96) sectors with respect
   to Bolzano, but these differences were not statistically significant.
   Possible cross-infections by more generalist parasites between wild and
   domestic animals were also suggested, as deer and domestic ruminants
   (Bovinae, Caprinae and Ovinae) used the same feeding areas of the park
   sectors.},

Abstract = {Brucellosis is a serious problem in Sicily. Brucella melitensis was
   identified as the species most frequently isolated in humans in Italy.
   No data, however, are available about the molecular epidemiological
   characterization of Brucella isolates from humans. We have conducted
   this study to molecularly characterize clinical isolates of Brucella
   spp. and to evaluate their antimicrobial susceptibilities. Twenty
   Brucella isolates were studied. Differential growth characteristics and
   DNA polymorphisms such as the restriction patterns of the PCR-amplified
   omp2a and omp2b genes, rpoB nucleotide sequencing, and multiple-locus
   variable-number tandem repeat analysis of 16 loci (MLVA-16) were used to
   characterize the strains. In vitro antibiotic susceptibility was
   determined by the E-test method on two different agar media, and the
   results were compared. All isolates were identified as B. melitensis
   biovar 3. rpoB nucleotide sequence analysis allowed the identification
   of two different genotypes of B. melitensis biovar 3. On the other hand,
   the MLVA-16 typing assay recognized 17 distinct genotypes. All isolates
   were sensitive to all tested antibiotics (rifampin, doxycycline,
   ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), and the
   Mueller-Hinton agar plate is recommended for antibiotic susceptibility
   testing by the E-test method. Our findings identify B. melitensis biovar
   3 as the etiological agent isolated in Sicily and encourage the use of
   both molecular methods, and in particular of the MLVA-16 assay, in
   epidemiological trace-back analysis. This study represents the first
   epidemiological data from molecular typing of Brucella strains
   circulating in Italy and, in particular, in eastern Sicily.},

Abstract = {Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), caused by Mycoplasma mycoides
   var. mycoides small colony (MmmSC), is one of the most important
   diseases of cattle in Africa. The role of innate or acquired cell
   mediated and humoral immunity in conferring protection against MmmSC
   infection has not yet been elucidated. On the other hand, the
   pathological lesions caused by the aetiological agent have been
   considered indicative of an immunopathological process. In this study
   ten naive cattle were exposed to in-contact infection with animals
   infected by intubation with a strain of MmmSC. Clinical signs, antibody
   response, IFN gamma release and pathological changes at necropsy were
   analysed and compared with the events following in-contact infection of
   an equal number of animals kept under daily treatment with cyclosporine
   for the entire observation period of 84 days. Cyclosporine is a
   suppressor of the immune response related to the T-cell system. Under
   the conditions of the experiment, cyclosporine appeared to condition the
   pathogenesis of CBPP by delaying the events that follow infection,
   bringing further support to the possibility that the immune response may
   have an impact on the disease outcome.},

   pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) A/Duck/ Vietnam/12/05 (H5N1),
   administered by an intra-nasal and oral route. Clinical symptoms were
   recorded twice a day up to 14 days postinfection (dpi). Clinical signs
   were first noted at 2 dpi, with conjunctivitis and slight depression,
   and progressed over a period of 1-3 days to severe neurologic signs
   consisting of torticollis, incoordination, tremors, and seizures.
   Survival times varied from 3 to 7 dpi. On postmortem examination,
   hemorrhages were observed in the duodenum, ceca, proventriculus,
   ventriculus, trachea, pancreas, and brain. Histologic lesions, as well
   as immunohistochemistry positivity, were recorded in the pancreas and
   brain. In situ hybridization revealed viral antigen associated with
   acinar pancreatic cells, bronchial epithelia] cells, and with cells of
   the central nervous system as well as neurons of the submucosal plexus
   of the duodenum. Our experimental findings agree with those previously
   observed in ducks naturally infected with HPAIV H5N1 viruses, confirming
   the acquired viral neurotropism and pancreatotropism, as previously
   noted in other avian species, as well as in humans.},

Title = {Veterinary drugs residue monitoring in Italian poultry: Current

Journal = {FOOD CONTROL},

Abstract = {Veterinary drugs residue monitoring is enforced in the EU according to
   requirements set down in EU Directive 96/23/EC and Commission Decision
   97/747/EC; the number of samples to be collected yearly is essentially
   defined according to production data.
   The present study aimed to quantitatively estimate the general
   contamination level of Italian poultry meat by some veterinary drug
   residues. A sampling plan was designed according to statistical
   considerations; study results were extrapolated to the general
   population by means of Bayesian analysis.
   Only one positive sample, contaminated by sulfonamides, was detected;
   this low contamination level (0.33\%) is very close to the percentage of
   violative samples detected by the Italian National Residue Plans (NRP)
   in the period 1995-2001 (< 0.5\%). This result, however, was achieved
   more effectively and at a lower cost than data obtained within NRP's
   design and requirements. The study indicated also that statistically
   based residue monitoring plans ensure better protection levels for
   consumers, than control systems designed simply as a proportion of
   production units. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Phylogenetic analysis of partial S1 and N gene sequences of infectious
   bronchitis virus isolates from Italy revealed genetic diversity and
   recombination},
Journal = {VIRUS GENES},
Year = {2007},

Abstract = {A total of ten infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) isolates collected from
   commercial chickens in Italy in 1999 were characterized by RT-PCR and
   sequencing of the S1 and N genes. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial
   S1 gene sequences showed that five field viruses clustered together with
   793/B-type strains, having 91.3-98.5\% nucleotide identity within the
   group, and one isolate had very close sequence relationship (94.6\%
   identity) with 624/I strain. These two IBV types have been identified in
   Italy previously. The other three variant isolates formed novel genotype
   detected recently in many countries of Western Europe. For one of these
   variant viruses, Italy-02, which afterwards became the prototype strain,
   the entire S1 gene was sequenced to confirm its originality. In
   contrast, phylogenetic analysis of more conserved partial N gene
   sequences, comprising 1-300 nucleotides, revealed different clustering.
   Thus, three variant IBVs of novel Italy-02 genotype, which had
   96.7-99.2\% S1 gene nucleotide identity with each other, belonged to
   three separate subgroups based on N gene sequences. 624/I-type isolate
   Italy-06 together with Italy-03, which was undetectable using S1 gene
   primers, shared 97.7\% and 99.3\% identity, respectively, in N gene
   region with vaccine strain H120. Only one of the 793/B-type isolates,
   Italy-10, clustered with the 793/B strain sharing 99.3\% partial N gene
   identity, whereas the other four isolates were genetically distant from
   them (only 87.7-89.7\% identity) and formed separate homogenous
   subgroup. The results demonstrated that both mutations and recombination
   events could contribute to the genetic diversity of the Italian
   isolates.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Immunohistochemistry for PrPSc is used widely in scrapie diagnosis. In
   natural scrapie cases the use of immunohistochemistry (IHC) has revealed
   the existence of up to 12 different morphological types of immunostained
   deposits. The significance of this pattern variability in relation to
   genotype has not been studied extensively in natural disease. In this
   study we recorded in detail PrPSc patterns at the obex level of the
   medulla oblongata from 163 animals derived from 55 flocks which
   presented through passive surveillance in the UK and Italy. A strong
   association was seen between PrPSc patterns and PrP genotype,
   particularly in relation to codon 136. In a blind assessment of this
   association we were able to predict, with over 80\% accuracy, the
   genotype of 151 scrapie cases which were presented through passive
   surveillance from 13 farms. The genotype of these cases was ARQ/ARQ or
   VRQ/VRQ. The association of PrPsc patterns with genotype was generally
   stronger in those farms where all the affected animals belonged to a
   single genotype compared with farms where both genotypes were
   identified, with the exception of one farm in which the genotype of all
   affected sheep was ARQ/ARQ and the PrPSc patterns were of the VRQ/VRQ
   type. Our observations support the hypothesis that the observed
   association between specific IHC patterns and genotypes may in fact be
   strain driven but in natural disease individual scrapie strains may
   demonstrate a genotypic tropism.},

Abstract = {Molecular biology and technical advances in DNA recombination have
   ushered in a new era in vaccinology. This article examines the recent
   development of specific marker vaccines and examines the impact of their
   use on the diagnosis and prevention of major infectious diseases.
   Gene-deleted vaccines, DIVA strategies (differentiating infected from
   vaccinated animals) and similar methods have been successfully applied
   in the control and eradication of Aujeszky's disease, infectious bovine
   rhinotracheitis, classical swine fever, foot and mouth disease and,
   recently, avian influenza. The efficacy and performance of existing
   marker vaccines and their companion diagnostic tools (which should be
   assesed by an independent body) are discussed, as are the ways in which
   these tools are deployed by competent authorities. The limits and the
   advantages of the use of marker vaccines are carefully analysed in the
   light of practical experiences. Although these vaccines can limit the
   speed and the extent of virus dissemination and thus reduce the number
   of animals slaughtered, marker vaccines are no substitute for sanitary
   measures. Early detection and warning systems and the quick
   implementation of sanitary measures, including stamping out, remain key
   issues in the control of highly contagious diseases.},

Abstract = {Continuing outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) across
   Eurasia and in Africa, caused by a type A influenza virus of the H5N 1
   subtype appear out of control and represent a serious risk for animal
   and public health worldwide. It is known that biosecurity represents the
   first line of defence against AI, although in certain circumstances
   strict hygienic measures appear to be inapplicable for social and
   economic conditions.
   The option of using vaccination against AI viruses of the H5 and H7
   subtypes, has made its way in recent times-primarily as a tool to
   maximise the outcome of a series of control measures in countries that
   are currently infected, but also as a means of reducing the risk of
   introduction in areas at high risk of infection.
   In developing countries vaccination programmes in avian species have
   been recommended recently, however it will require concurrent management
   of local husbandry practices and industry compliance to eradicate the
   disease rather than the establishment of an endemic situation. Other key
   deliverables expected for this control strategy include maintaining a
   major source of food for rural communities and the preservation of the
   commercial viability of the local poultry industry.
   In developed countries vaccination is being used as a means of
   increasing resistance of susceptible animals to reduce the risk of
   introduction from the reservoir host or to reduce secondary spread in
   densely populated poultry areas.
   The recent joint OIE/FAO summits recommended applying vaccination, using
   the differentiating infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) strategy
   when there is risk of major spread and depopulation is not feasible or
   desirable. Particularly in developing countries, stamping out of
   infected animals does not seem to be an appropriate means of reducing
   the spread of infection, if food supplies are to be guaranteed and
   economic consequences minimised. Crucial points to the success of a
   vaccination campaign are the implementation of complex territorial
   strategy involving upgraded biosecurity, monitoring vaccine efficacy,
   identification of field exposure and the appropriate management of
   infected flocks, regardless of vaccination status. Granting financial
   support for the compensation of farmers is also a key part of this
   strategy.
   Poultry veterinarians working for the industry or for the public sector
   represent the first line of defence against the pandemic threat and for
   the prevention and control of this infection in poultry and in wild
   birds. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Diarrheic fecal specimens collected from porcine herds were screened for
   the presence of group C rotaviruses using a reverse
   transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. A total of 188
   samples were tested and 54 were positive. When compiled these data with
   diagnostic results on group A rotaviruses and enteric caliciviruses we
   found that all but 5 group C rotavirus positive samples contained at
   least one additional virus. A subset of samples were subjected to
   nucleotide sequencing. The selected strains showed an unexpectedly wide
   range of nucleotide sequence heterogeneity (88.6-100\%) to each other
   and to the reference porcine group C rotavirus strain, Cowden. The
   nucleotide sequence identity to the genuine bovine and human strains
   were, respectively, 86.8 and 87.2\% or less. In conclusion, our study
   demonstrates that infection with group C rotavirus is frequent in
   Italian piggeries. The considerable rate of multiple infections requires
   further studies to investigate the pathogenic potential of group C
   rotaviruses in pigs, alone or in mixed infection, and raises challenges
   in the laboratory diagnosis of porcine enteric infections. (C) 2007

Abstract = {An experimental infection of mice was performed in order to investigate
   the potential for interspecies transmission in mammals of Italian HPAI
   viruses of the H7N1 subtype. Three avian origin isolates were selected,
   two strains obtained from ostrich (one of which contained a PB2-627
   Lysine residue) and one from a chicken. Following intranasal infection
   of mice, clinical signs and mortality were recorded in the experimental
   groups challenged with the two ostrich isolates, while only weight loss
   was observed in those receiving the chicken strain. Viruses were
   recovered to a varying extent from respiratory and nervous tissues of
   infected animals. These results suggest that HPAI viruses, other than
   H5N1 and H7N7, may have zoonotic implications, and support the consensus
   that Al infections in poultry are to be eradicated rather than
   contained. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A high performance liquid chromatographic method with fluorimetric
   detection for the determination of aflatoxin M, (AFMI) in milk has been
   optimized and validated according to Commission Decision 2002/657/EC by
   using the conventional validation approach. The procedure for
   determining selectivity, recovery, precision, decision limit (CC alpha),
   detection capability (CC beta) and ruggedness of the method has been
   reported. The results of the validation process demonstrate the
   agreement of the method with the provisions of Commission Regulation
   401/2006/EC. The mean recovery calculated at three levels of
   fortification (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5-fold the MRL) was 91 \% and the maximum
   relative standard deviation value forthe within-laboratory
   reproducibility was 15\%. Limit of detection (LOD) and limit of
   quantitation (LOQ) values were 0.006 Rg kg(-1) and 0.015 mu g kg(-1)
   while the CC, and CC values were 0.058 Rg kg-1 and 0.065 jig kg(-1),
   respectively. The relative expanded measurement uncertainty of the
   method was 7\%. The method was not affected by slight variations of some
   critical factors (ruggedness minor changes) as pre-treatment and
   clean-up of milk samples, thermal treatment and different storage
   conditions, as well as by major changes valued in terms of milk produced
   by different species (buffalo, goat and sheep). The method allowed
   accurate confirmation analyses of milk samples, resulted positive by the
   screening method. In fact, the Z-score values attained in a proficiency
   test round were well below the reference value of 1, proving the
   excellent laboratory performances. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Bartonella henselae exists as a mosaic of different genetic variants in

Abstract = {Bartonella henselae is a fastidious bacterium associated with infections
   in humans and cats. The mechanisms involved in the long-term survival of
   bartonellae despite vigorous host immune responses are poorly
   understood. Generation of genetic variants is a possible strategy to
   circumvent the host specific immune responses. The authors have recently
   demonstrated the coexistence of different genetic variants within the
   progeny of three primary B. henselae isolates from Berlin by PFGE
   analysis. Aims of the present study were to determine whether
   coexistence of different variants is a common feature of B. henselae
   isolates worldwide and whether the genetic variants originally emerged
   in vivo. Thirty-four primary isolates from different geographical
   regions were analysed by subjecting multiple single-colony-derived
   cultures to PFGE analysis. Up to three genetic variants were detected
   within 20 (58.8 \%) isolates, indicating that most primary isolates
   display a mosaic-like structure. The close relatedness of the genetic
   variants within an isolate was confirmed by multi-locus sequence typing.
   In contrast to the primary isolates, no genetic variants were detected
   within the progeny of 20 experimental clones generated in vitro from 20
   primary isolates, suggesting that the variants were not induced in vitro
   during the procedure of PFGE analysis. Hence, the genetic variants
   within a primary isolate most likely originally emerged in vivo.
   Consideration of the mosaic structure of primary isolates is essential
   when interpreting typing studies on B. henselae.},

Title = {Characterization of low-pathogenic H5 subtype influenza viruses from

Journal = {JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {81},
Number = {14},
Pages = {7529-7539},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses are now endemic in
   many Asian countries, resulting in repeated outbreaks in poultry and
   increased cases of human infection. The immediate precursor of these
   HPAI viruses is believed to be A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 (Gs/GD)-like H5N1
   HPAI viruses first detected in Guangdong, China, in 1996. From 2000
   onwards, many novel reassortant H5N1 influenza viruses or genotypes have
   emerged in southern China. However, precursors of the Gs/GD-like viruses
   and their subsequent reassortants have not been fully determined. Here
   we characterize low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H5 subtype viruses
   isolated from poultry and migratory birds in southern China and Europe
   from the 1970s to the 2000s. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that
   Gs/GD-like virus was likely derived from an LPAI H5 virus in migratory
   birds. However, its variants arose from multiple reassortments between
   Gs/GD-like virus and viruses from migratory birds or with those Eurasian
   viruses isolated in the 1970s. It is of note that unlike HPAI H5N1
   viruses, those recent LPAI H5 viruses have not become established in
   aquatic or terrestrial poultry. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the
   dynamic nature of the influenza virus gene pool in Eurasia with repeated
   transmissions between the eastern and western extremities of the
   continent. The data also show reassortment between influenza viruses
   from domestic and migratory birds in this region that has contributed to
   the expanded diversity of the influenza virus gene pool among poultry in
   Eurasia.},

Abstract = {In the contest of the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)
   H5N1 virus through Eurasia during 2005, a surveillance study of wild
   birds was launched in early 2006 within the framework of regional
   Technical Cooperation Programmes of Food and Agliculture Organization in
   several countries of eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. From
   mid-January to rnid-May 2006, field campaigns were conducted in 14
   countries, including recently infected countries. In total, 5,256
   samples were collected in large wetland areas where Eurasian and
   Afro-tropical waterbirds congregate. The overall prevalence of avian
   influenza viruses detected by RT-PCR was 3.3\%, with no positivity for
   HPAI H5N1 virus. Five distinctvirus isolates were obtained from the
   RT-PCR-positive samples. Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses
   were detected and isolated in both Eurasian and Afro-tropical bird
   species, indicating that low pathogenic viruses were circulating in
   Africa during the northern winter. These findings reveal that LPAI virus
   persists in wild birds in subtropical environments and support the
   hypothesis that avian influenza viruses could be perpetuated in wild
   birds throughout the year, including in Palearctic waterbirds wintering
   in sub-Sabaran Africa before their northward spring migration.},

Abstract = {Following the detection of Listeria monocytogenes in samples of dry
   cured ham imported in the USA from Italy, the Italian Ministry of Health
   planned a risk assessment for listeriosis in ham consumers. The risk
   assessment was performed according to international guidelines set by
   FAO and WHO. Expected incidence of illness was 4.7 X 10(-10) cases per
   serving in the case of normal adult population, 6.1 X 10(-7) in the case
   of organ transplanted patients, the most susceptible risk
   sub-population. Due to the low value of water activity even in the
   deeper parts of the ham, bacterial growth had a very slight effect on
   the probability of illness. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Relationship between habitat, densities and metabolic profile in brown

Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {241-255},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Some habitat traits and haematic parameters were studied to understand
   the relationships between the hare densities, habitat characteristics
   and physiological and nutritional condition of the animals. A total of
   33 protected areas, reserved for wild game reproduction, located in the
   Province of Florence (Central Italy), were monitored during a 2-year
   period. In each protected area the hares were submitted to census. The
   habitat features of the protected areas were studied and the following
   parameters were categorised: altitude; cleared-land/total-land ratio;
   main exposure; main ground composition; water availability; main slope;
   anthropogenic presence; predator presence; wooded borders; presence of
   trees and shrubs; surveillance against hunting; demographic predator
   control; kind of cultivation; un-harvested crops for game. After the
   census the hares were captured for translocation outside in ``free{''}
   hunting areas. During capture the hares were put in darkened, wooden
   capture-boxes and remained inside for a variable period of time (10min
   to 3h). A sample of 3 to 7 hares, captured per year and per each
   protected area, were removed from the boxes (physically restrained, with
   covered eyes) for blood sample collection, sex, age and live weight
   determination. The following analyses were performed on frozen plasma
   samples: ALanine aminoTransferase (ALT), ASpartate aminoTransferase
   (AST), glucose, cholesterol, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), Ca, P, Mg, Na,
   K, and Cl concentrations. The relationship between hare density and
   habitat characteristics was analysed by single regressions analysis.
   Then the habitat characteristics were subjected to multivariate analysis
   in relationship to hare body condition. The haematic parameters were
   analysed by least square means considering habitat traits, animal
   density, age and sex, as main categorical factors, interaction
   sex{*}age, and ``pregnant and non-reproducing{''} nested within sex.
   Results showed that the highest density and best body conditions can be
   found in highlands, open fields with low tree presence and wooded
   borders, medium mixture soils, scarce predator presence and limited
   anthropogenic presence and with abundant water availability and
   shrubbiness. The study of the absolute values of metabolic profile,
   indicator of the physiological and nutritional condition of the reared
   animals, did not show any nutritional winter deficiency in wild hares
   and, as census data, should be repeated for several years since,
   probably, only their variations can be used as indicators of preliminary
   problems.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Prevention is essential in order to fight against disease propagation
   and their consequences, in particular because curative methods are less
   efficient in the open and marine environment. Modelling as a predictive
   tool is in this case particularly accurate. A bibliographic review of
   published models in aquatic health was made for the European project
   DIPNET. Quantitative risk assessment is made for some diseases of
   salmonids of north European countries, in order to protect transfers, to
   make risk-based surveillance, and to prevent from emerging diseases.
   Dynamic models have begun to be used for risk management, for salmonids
   and shellflsh (USA) but are depending on their complexity, data- and
   time-consuming. Dynamic models are, however, necessary for evaluating
   the effects of measures predictively, with a complex system of
   causality. Classical rigorous epidemiologic studies are not numerous in
   aquatic health, however they are of particular interest for risk
   management of health problems. For aquatic animal health, there are few
   models that take into account spatial analysis, economic or ecologic
   consequences. This is surprising because of the strong well-known
   interactions between the host and environment in aquatic systems, and
   because of the interest for the risk manager. Modelling work needs
   multidisciplinary skills, which are sometimes difficult to share for
   aquatic productions.},

   characterized by detecting the mecA gene, the production of type A to D
   staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs), and studying their resistance
   properties against several antibiotics; their ecological origin was
   determined by biotyping. Of the 160 analyzed S. aureus strains six
   (3.75\%) were mecA positive and derived from six different samples; four
   isolates were from bovine milk and two from dairy products (pecorino
   cheese and mozzarella cheese). Two strains isolated from milk belonged
   to the non-host-specific biovar while the others to the ovine biovar.
   The strain isolated from mozzarella cheese belonged to the
   non-host-specific biovar and the strain isolated from pecorino cheese to
   the ovine biovar. All the MRSA strains isolated were enterotoxigenic;
   two strains synthesized SEA/SED two SED and one SEC. All the strains
   showed resistance to at least one of the antibiotics tested but none was
   resistant to glycopeptides. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.},

Title = {The use of vaccination to combat multiple introductions of Notifiable
   Avian Influenza viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes between 2000 and 2006
   in Italy},
Journal = {VACCINE},

Abstract = {Since 1999, Italy has been challenged by several epidemics of Notifiable
   Avian Influenza (NAI) of the H5 and H7 subtypes, occurring in the
   densely populated poultry areas of northern part of the country.
   Vaccination with a conventional vaccine containing a seed strain with a
   different neuraminidase subtype to the field virus was used to
   complement biosecurity and restriction measures as part of an overall
   eradication strategy. This vaccination technique, known as the
   ``DIVA-Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals{''} system,
   enabled, the identification of field exposed flocks and ultimately the
   eradication of H7N1, H7N3 and H5N2 infections. A bivalent H5/H7
   prophylactic vaccination programme of defined poultry populations was
   introduced subsequently to increase their resistance to field infection.
   Retrospective analysis of the outbreaks identified important reservoir
   species such as quail, and demonstrated clearly the higher
   susceptibility of turkeys to infection.
   Data generated during 6 years of experience with vaccination against
   Avian Influenza (AI) indicate that it is a useful tool to limit
   secondary spread and possibly prevent the introduction of AI viruses in
   a susceptible population. The Italian AI control programme including
   vaccination was managed in a flexible manner and enabled the
   continuation of international trade. It is imperative that if
   vaccination is to be used to combat the current H5N1 epidemic it is used
   in conjunction with other measures and under official supervision. An
   extraordinary effort is required from international organisations to
   accredit control strategies so that harmonised and validated programs
   can be implemented. Transparency and sharing of field results from
   countries that are practising such programmes is crucial to the
   progressive control and ultimately the eradication of NAI infections in
   the animal reservoir. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A simple and rapid multiplexed sandwich chemiluminescent enzyme
   immunoassay has been developed for the simultaneous detection of
   Escherichia coli O157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella
   typhimurium, and Listeria monocytogenes. To achieve the multiplexed
   detection of the four pathogens, a new polystyrene 96 well microtiter
   plate format has been designed, in which each main well contains four
   subwells in the bottom. The monoclonal antibodies specific for each
   bacteria were separately immobilized in each subwell. When the samples
   were added to the main wells, the bacteria able to specifically bind to
   the corresponding monoclonal antibody were captured in one of the four
   subwells. Subsequently, a mixture of peroxidase-labeled polyclonal
   antibodies against the four bacteria was added and the peroxidase
   activity of the bound polyclonal labeled antibodies in each well was
   measured by an enhanced luminol-based chemiluminescent cocktail using a
   low-light charge-coupled imaging device. The assay was simple and fast,
   and the limit of quantification was in the order of 10(4)-10(5) CFU/mL
   for all bacterial species. The accuracy of the method, evaluated by
   comparison of the results with a conventional culturing methodology, was
   satisfactory, with recovery values ranging from 90 to 120\%. This method
   can be used as a screening test to evaluate the presence of these
   pathogen bacteria in different foodstuffs.},

Abstract = {Verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) has emerged as a
   foodborne pathogen that can cause severe and potentially fatal
   illnesses, such as hemorrhagic colitis or the hemolytic uremic syndrome.
   In this study, 182 cattle at slaughter (119 dairy cows and 63 feedlot
   cattle) were randomly selected and tested for the presence of VTEC
   serogroups O26, O103, O111, O145, and O157 in their cecal content and
   lymphatic tissue (tonsils or mesenteric lymph nodes). A total of 364
   samples were evaluated with an immunomagnetic separation technique
   followed by slide agglutination. Presumptive VTEC O26, O103, O111, O145,
   and O157 isolates were tested by Vero cell assay for verocytotoxin
   production and by multiplex PCR assay for the detection of vtx(1),
   vtx(2), eae, and E-hlyA genes. VTEC O157 was detected in 6 (3.3\%) of
   182 animals, and VTEC O26 was detected in 1 (0.5\%) of 182 animals. No
   VTEC O103, VTEC O111, or VTEC O145 isolates were found in cattle feces,
   but one VTEC O91:H- vtx(2)(+), eae(-), E-hlyA(+) strain nonspecifically
   cross-reacted with the VTEC O103 type. The prevalence of VTEC O157 in
   the lymphatic tissue of cattle was 1.1\% in both tonsils (1 of 93
   samples) and mesenteric lymph nodes (1 of 89 samples). Lymphatic tissue
   contamination was observed only in VTEC O157 intestinal carriers; two
   (33.3\%) of six fecal carriers were simultaneously VTEC O157 lymphatic
   carriers. This finding suggests that VTEC O157 contamination of meat
   does not necessarily come from feces or the environment. No other VTEC
   serogroups were detected in the lymphatic tissue of slaughtered cattle.},

Abstract = {An enteric syndrome was observed in quail (Coturnix coturnix)
   semi-intensively reared for restocking ill Apulia (southern Italy). The
   birds showed depression, severe diarrhoea, dehydration and reduced

   prominent lesion was enteritis. A coronavirus was detected by electron
   microscopy and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in the
   faeces and in the intestinal content of the dead quails. The virus could
   not be cultivated in chicken embryos. By sequence analyses of a fragment
   (409 nucleotides) of region I b of the polymerase gene, the quail
   coronavirus displayed <= 93\% nucleotide identity to avian coronaviruses
   (group 3 coronaviruses)-whereas by analysis of the S1 portion of the
   spike protein-encoding gene, the quail coronavirus displayed 16\% to
   18\% amino acid identity with infectious bronchitis virus, and 79\% to
   81\% identity with turkey coronavirus. Altogether, the findings suggest
   the existence of a novel coronavirus genetically related to turkey

Title = {Molecular discrimination of atypical bovine spongiform encephalopathy

Abstract = {Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy strains can be differentiated by
   their behavior in bioassays and by molecular analyses of the
   disease-associated prion protein (PrP) in a posttranslationally
   transformed conformation (PrPSc). Until recently, isolates from cases of
   bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) appeared to be very homogeneous.
   However, a limited number of atypical BSE isolates have recently been
   identified upon analyses of the disease-associated proteinase K (PK)
   resistance-associated moiety of PrPSc (Prp(res)), suggesting the
   existence of at least two additional BSE PrPres variants. These are
   defined here as the H type and the L type, according to the higher and
   lower positions of the nonglycosylated PrPres band in Western blots,
   respectively, compared to the position of the band in classical BSE
   (C-type) isolates. These molecular Prpres variants, which originated
   from six different European countries, were investigated together. In
   addition to the migration properties and glycosylation profiles
   (glycoprofiles), the H- and L-type isolates exhibited enhanced PK
   sensitivities at pH 8 compared to those of the C-type isolates.
   Moreover, H-type BSE isolates exhibited differences in the binding of
   antibodies specific for N- and more C-terminal PrP regions and
   principally contained two aglycosylated PrPres moieties which can both
   be glycosylated and which is thus indicative of the existence of two
   PrPres, populations or intermediate cleavage sites. These properties
   appear to be consistent within each BSE type and independent of the
   geographical origin, suggesting the existence of different BSE strains
   in cattle. The choice of three antibodies and the application of two pHs
   during the digestion of brain homogenates provide practical and diverse
   tools for the discriminative detection of these three molecular BSE
   types and might assist with the recognition of other variants.},

Abstract = {Information on population parameters is rarely collected from carcasses.
   This method can be particularly useful - with limitations - when
   protected species are involved (e.g. the grey wolf Canis lupus in
   Italy). Local data on population structure, reproduction, survivorship
   and causes of mortality are necessary to build reliable conservation
   models to assess the state of a population and to predict its evolution.
   On the other hand, `best guesses' or data from ecologically different
   areas have often been used to build population viability analysis and
   other conservation-oriented models. A sample of 154 wolf carcasses was
   found, collected and analysed from 1991 to 2001 in central-eastern
   Italy, the historic core of the wolf distribution range. Collision with
   a vehicle was the main cause of death in both sexes; however, road kills
   may be biased with a greater detectability, and we treated our data
   accordingly. Road kills were concentrated on the younger (<= 4 years
   old) age classes, whereas fully adult wolves died mainly because of
   poaching, intraspecific strife and pathologies. Cubs and subadults (<= 2
   years old) showed a mortality peak in November/December, at the
   beginning of the dispersal period, whereas adults died mainly in
   January/February (mating season). The population structure of our sample
   of wolf carcasses appeared to be well balanced, although perinatal and
   cub mortality was underestimated. The sex ratio was 1:1 in the younger
   age classes and 1:0.7 in the older age classes. Only 20.7\% of females,
   2-6 years old, showed signs of reproduction; placental scar and embryo
   number varied from one to seven (mean, 4.4) per individual. Survivorship
   theoretical curves indicated a fair survival of cubs and subadults, but
   a steep decline as wolves approached maximum life span (9 years old).
   Our data and other published data on food habits and genetic features of
   the wolf in central-eastern Italy suggest that, despite ongoing heavy
   human-induced losses, this predator has fully recovered in the last 30
   years from the brink of extinction.},

   Onderstepoort Journal of Veterinary Research, 74:97-114
   The viruses causing the economically important livestock diseases of
   African horse sickness (AHS) and bluetongue (BT) are transmitted by
   biting midges of the genus Culicoides (Qiptera, Ceratopogonidae). In the
   Old World the most important vectors of these diseases are Culicoides
   imicola Kieffer, 1913, Culicoides brevitarsis Kieffer, 1917 and
   Culicoides bolitinos Meiswinkel, 1989. All three of these vectors belong
   to the Imicola complex of the subgenus Avaritia Fox, 1955. This species
   complex now comprises 12 sibling species; ten occur in sub-Saharan
   Africa and are difficult to identify (based mostly on subtle variations
   in the wing patterns) and so additional methods of reliable
   identification are needed. The pupal exuviae of the five commonest
   sibling species (C. imicola, C. bolitinos, Culicoides loxodontis
   Meiswinkel, 1992, Culicoides tuttifrutti Meiswinkel, Cornet \& Dyce,
   2003 and Culicoides sp. \# 107) harvested from a variety of large
   herbivore dung types and from decaying fruits, are described and
   illustrated in detail. It is shown that they can be differentiated
   clearly on a number of morphological characters and, furthermore, are
   separable into two distinct groups based (principally) on the shape of
   the respiratory organ. A key for identifying and differentiating these
   five pupae is provided. Also, the pupa of the Oriental-Australasian C.
   brevitarsis was compared with its allopatric sister taxon, C. bolitinos.
   Because they share a common larval habitat (cattle and buffalo dung) and
   are almost inseparable in the adult phenotype, the question of their
   possible synonymy is raised. However, their respective pupae could not
   be differentiated on gross morphology and so it is argued that this
   unresolved problem requires a molecular solution.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to determine the burden of Toxoplasma
   gondii-infections in sheep in Sicily, southern Italy and the risk
   factors for infection.
   Sera from 1961 sheep were collected just before slaughtering from 62
   farms located in 8 out of 9 Sicilian administrative districts. The sera
   were analysed for Toxoplasma-specific IgG antibodies using commercially
   available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Sheep less than 4 weeks old
   were further analysed by ELISA for Toxoplasma-specific IgM-antibodies.
   Data on farm size and location were obtained from slaughterhouse
   sanitary reports and through structured telephone interviews of the
   veterinary officers from public health districts.
   The overall seroprevalence of Toxoplasma-specific IgG-antibodies were
   49.9\% (937/1876) by ELISA. Eighty-seven (54/62) percent of the farms
   had at least one Toxoplasma-positive animal. All the farms fed the
   animals outdoor on pasture and only one was claiming organic farming.
   Having cats on the farm, age of the animals, farm size and the use of
   surface water sources for drinking were all significantly associated
   with T. gondii-infected animals on the farm.
   T. gondii infection in mutton used for human consumption is very
   prevalent, and eating unprocessed sheep and lamb meat has a high risk of
   transmitting infections to humans. The presence of cats on the farm,
   farm size and using surface water as drinking water for the animals were
   risk factors for infection in sheep, with age as a significant
   confounder. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The partial PrP gene sequence and the deduced protein of eight cetacean
   species, seven of which have never been reported so far, have been
   determined in order to extend knowledge of sequence variability of the
   PrP genes in different species and to aid in speculation on cetacean
   susceptibility to prions. Both the nucleotide and the deduced amino acid
   sequences have been analysed in comparison with some of the known
   mammalian PrPs. Cetacean PrPs present typical features of eutherian
   PrPs. The PrP gene from the species of the family Delphinidae gave
   identical nucleic acid sequences, while differences in the PrP gene were
   found in Balaenopteridae and Ziphidae. The phylogenetic tree resulting
   from analysis of the cetacean PrP gene sequences, together with reported
   sequences of some ungulates, carnivores and primates, showed that the
   PrP gene phylogenesis mirrors the species phylogenesis. The PrP gene of
   cetaceans is very close to species where natural forms of TSEs are
   known. From an analysis of the sequences and the phylogenesis of the PrP
   gene, susceptibility to or occurrence of prion diseases in cetaceans can
   not be excluded. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {After the first report of Brucella melitensis infection from a
   7-year-old alpine ibex (Capra ibex) buck living in Gran Paradiso
   National Park (GPNP), further studies demonstrated the presence of the
   infection in ibex and chamois. Considering that livestock herds keep on
   sharing pastures with more than 3,500 ibex and 9,000 chamois in the
   park, our aim was to demonstrate under controlled conditions the
   possibility of Brucella infection passing from wild ruminants to
   livestock. A 7-year-old male alpine ibex with clinical signs of
   brucellosis and serologically positive was released in a 5,000 m(2)
   enclosure together with five goats and two sheep rams. Due to poor
   condition, ibex was suppressed at day 40, domestic ruminants stayed into
   the enclosure potentially contaminated by ibex for further 38 days.
   During this period, we had monitored our animals taking blood from
   domestic ruminants every 15 days and tested the serum to Rose Bengal
   agglutination test and Complement Fixation test. Domestic animals tested
   negative at serology at all sampling time and at isolation, while B.
   melitensis biovar 3 was isolated from ibex tissues. Our data show that
   transmission of infection from ibex to livestock is not easy. After 40
   days of strict cohabitation and 38 days of permanence in an area where
   an infected ibex lives, no one of the domestic animals contracted
   infection. In spite of the limitation of our field trial, we have
   demonstrated that long direct and indirect contact between alpine ibex
   and domestic animals will not easily lead to an infection of the latter.
   Further investigations are needed to confirm our results and evaluate
   the effective risk of B. melitensis transmission from alpine ibex to
   livestock.},

Abstract = {Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a very important bacterial pathogen
   of humans which may cause gastrointestinal illnesses ranging from
   gastric and duodenal ulcers to neoplastic diseases such as MALToma and
   gastric cancer. Transmission via contaminated food is still uncertain
   but several authors believe this can realistically occur and milk may
   act as a vehicle of infection. This paper reports the results of H.
   pylori survival trials in pasteurized and ultrahigh temperature (UHT)
   milks artificially contaminated and aerobically stored at 4 degrees C.
   The results obtained showed that the four strains used in this study (H.
   pylori nat 18-19-20 and H. pylori ATCC 43504), had a progressive
   reduction in bacterial load with a median survival of 9 days in
   pasteurized milk and 12 days in UHT milk, with approximate average of
   initial inoculum of 10(5) and 10(6) cfu/ml, respectively. These findings
   are very important to clarify the route of transmission of H. pylori to
   humans via food and for implementation of a correct risk analysis for
   food safety purposes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {New human Cases Of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) have recently been
   recorded Outside the recognised foci of this disease, i.e. in the
   province of Trento in northern Italy. In order to predict the highest
   risk areas for increased TBE virus activity, we have combined
   cross-sectional serological data, obtained from 459 domestic goats, with
   analysis of the autumnal cooling rare based Oil Moderate Resolution
   Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land Surface temperature (LST) data. A
   significant relationship between finding antibodies against the Virus in
   serum (seroprevalence) ill goats and the autumnal cooling rate was
   detected, indicating that the transmission intensity of the virus does
   not only vary spatially, but also ill relation to climatic factors.
   Virus seroprevalence in goats was correlated with the occurrence of TBE
   in humans and also with the average number of forestry workers' tick
   bites, demonstrating that serological screening of domestic animals,
   combined with an analysis Of the autumnal cooling rate, call be Used as
   early-warning predictors of TBE risk in humans.},

Abstract = {This study aims to investigate the relationship between human behaviour,
   buffalo behaviour and prevalence of oxytocin injection at milking. The
   research was carried out on 17 buffalo farms. On each form the
   stockperson's behaviour toward the buffaloes and the buffaloes'
   behaviour were observed during one afternoon's milking. Stockperson's
   behaviour was observed from collection of the animals in the waiting
   area to exit from the milking parlour. The following variables were
   recorded: number of positive, neutral and negative interactions. The
   number of steps and kicks were recorded from the entrance to the milking
   parlour to the removal of cups whenever the stockperson was less than
   0.5 m from the animal. The prevalence of oxytocin injection at milking
   was recorded on two separate occasions with a 5-month interval to obtain
   a measure of the long-term consistency of this variable. Significant
   correlations were found between stepping and kicking, stepping and
   prevalence of oxytocin injection, kicking and prevalence of oxytocin
   injection and stockperson positive interactions and kicking. These
   results indicate that stockperson behaviour is related to buffalo
   behaviour at milking and the latter to the use of oxytocin injections.
   In addition, prevalence of oxytocin injection proved to be highly
   reliable when re-tested five months later.},

Abstract = {To better understand the ecology and epidemiology of the highly
   pathogenic avian influenza virus in its transcontinental spread, we
   sequenced and analyzed the complete genomes of 36 recent influenza A
   (H5N1) viruses collected from birds in Europe, northern Africa, and
   southeastern Asia. These sequences, among the first complete genomes of
   influenza (H5N1) viruses outside Asia, clearly depict the lineages now
   infecting wild and domestic birds in Europe and Africa and show the
   relationships among these isolates and other strains affecting both
   birds and humans. The isolates fall into 3 distinct lineages, 1 of which
   contains all known non-Asian isolates. This new Euro-African lineage,
   which was the cause of several recent (2006) fatal human infections in
   Egypt and Iraq, has been introduced at least 3 times into the
   European-African region and has split into 3 distinct, independently
   evolving sublineages. One isolate provides evidence that 2 of these
   sublineages have recently reassorted.},

Abstract = {Dientamoeba fragilis, a protozoan with worldwide distribution is
   considered to be responsible for enteric disease in humans. A wide
   spectrum of clinical symptoms including; diarrhoea (acute or prolonged),
   flatulence, abdominal pains and other unspecific bowel symptoms have
   been ascribed to this parasite. Asymptomatic infection has also been
   reported. Dientamoeba fragilis is as its name indicates an extremely
   delicate protozoon and only the trophozoite has ever been demonstrated
   in stool samples. The definitive diagnosis of this infection is based on
   demonstration in permanently stained stool samples. In Italy examination
   of ova and parasite (O\&P) samples are not currently performed. This
   protozoan is extremely difficult to cultivate but molecular techniques
   such as the Polymerase Chain Reaction offer promise as a means of
   diagnosing infection. The epidemiology of Dientamoebiasis is not clear.
   This paper will present preliminary results from a study looking for the
   parasite's presence in swine faeces. The possible role of pigs as a
   reservoir of infection was studied; 121 faecal samples from breeding and
   fattening pigs were examined using a Giemsa permanent stain. Dientamoeba
   fragilis was found in 53 (43.8\%) of the stool samples examined. (c)

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to assess the immune response in pigs
   intradermally vaccinated with a commercially available attenuated
   porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSV) vaccine (Porcilis (R)
   PRRS) and subsequently exposed to a heterologous (Italian cluster) field
   strain of virulent PRRSV. A total of 18, 4-week-old pigs seronegative
   for PRRSV were allocated to I of 3 groups (groups A, B, and Q. At 5
   weeks of age, pigs of groups A (n = 6 pigs) and B (n = 6 pigs) were
   vaccinated intramuscularly and intradermally, respectively, with
   Porcilis (R) PRRS. The more conventional intramuscular route of
   vaccination was included for comparative purposes with the intradermal
   route of vaccination (performed with the I.D.A.L.(R) vaccinator). Pigs
   of group C (n = 6 pigs) were kept as nonvaccinated controls. At
   post-vaccination (PV) days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35, blood samples were
   collected for detection of vaccine virus (PCR) and antibodies (ELISA),
   and for changes in PBMC (flow cytometry). At PV day 35, pigs of all
   groups were each exposed (challenged) intranasally to a heterologous
   field strain (78\% ORF5 sequence homology between vaccine and field
   virus) belonging to the Italian cluster of the European genotype of
   PRRSV. At post-challenge (PC) days 0, 3, 7, 10, 13, and 17, blood
   samples were collected for detection and quantitation of virus and
   antibodies, and for changes in PBMC as described above for blood samples
   collected PV. Throughout the experiment all pigs were observed daily for
   clinical signs. At PC days 7 and 17, two pigs and four pigs,
   respectively, of each group were euthanized and examined for macroscopic
   lesions. Following vaccination some pigs of groups A and B had a
   detectable viremia that in two pigs (one pig of group A and one pig of
   group 13) lasted until PV day 28. However, all pigs (groups A, B, and C)
   remained clinically normal. All vaccinated pigs developed a serological
   response (ELISA) to PRRSV. Presumptive evidence for vaccine-induced
   protective immunity against the heterologous challenge strain was
   provided by finding that viremia following challenge was generally less
   (incidence) and significantly less (titers) in vaccinated pigs than in
   nonvaccinated pigs. No differences were apparent between pigs vaccinated
   intramuscularly and those vaccinated intradermally. The absence of
   virulent-virus-induced clinical signs and macroscopic lesions in
   nonvaccinated as well as in vaccinated pigs precluded a more definitive
   evaluation of the magnitude of protective immunity provided by
   vaccination or by the route of vaccination. Some likely
   treatment-associated changes in lymphocyte subpopulations were observed
   among the three treatment groups. These changes and their potential
   relationship to protective immunity are discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier

Abstract = {Neosporosis by Neospora caninum causes losses to livestock production
   through abortion in cattle while, in dogs, it induces neuromuscolar
   disease. This study investigated neosporosis seroprevalence associated
   risk factors (including the seropositivity to leishmaniosis) in dogs of
   southern Italy, determined the prevalence of N. caninum oocyst shedding
   and examined the relationship between seroprevalence of neosporosis in
   farm dogs and cattle. Using an inhibition ELISA, 20.9\% of 306 dogs had
   percent inhibition values >10 (indicative of exposure) and farm dogs had
   a significantly (p < 0.001) higher seroprevalence than dogs in a rescue
   kennel. Whilst N. caninum seroprevalence was associated with increasing
   age in dogs (p <= 0.01) there was no association between seropositivity
   for N. caninum and for Leishmania infantum. Oocysts of N. caninum were
   not detected in faecal samples from 230 dogs including 160 farm dogs.
   The results indicated that neosporosis infection is common in southern
   Italy both in dogs and in cattle and that dogs at higher risk of
   exposure are free-ranging ones living in farms. The lack of correlation
   between canine seroprevalence for N. canium and L. infantum assumes a
   particular significance in an endemic area for leishmaniosis. (C) 2007

Abstract = {This study aimed at identifying genes that could mark scrapie infection
   in the central nervous system of sheep. We used the subtractive
   suppressive hybridization (SSH) technique on brain samples from sheep
   healthy or clinically affected by scrapie. Following subtraction,
   several discrete differential bands appeared between the two
   reciprocally subtracted samples. These bands were cloned and sequenced,
   allowing identifying the genes COX1, CHN1, PPP2CA, LRFN5, CAMK2A and
   RABEPK. Two of the genes identified, CHN1 and RABEPK, appear to locate
   inside a QTL region known to modulate prion disease incubation time in
   mice, and LRFN5 maps inside a QTL region identified in sheep.
   Furthermore, CHN1 and RABEKP showed new unreported differential
   splicing. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is considered to be one of the leading causes of
   food-borne illnesses. Milk, dairy products and meats are often
   contaminated with enterotoxigenic strains of this bacterium. Foodstuff
   contamination may occur directly from infected food-producing animals or
   may result from poor hygiene during production processes, or the retail
   and storage of foods, since humans may carry the microorganism. The
   number of S. aureus strains that exhibits antimicrobial-resistance
   properties has increased, together with the potential risk of
   transmitting the same properties to the human microflora via foods or
   inducing infections hard to be treated. This paper reports the results
   of a 3-year survey (2003-2005) on the occurrence of S. aureus in meat
   and dairy products. Of 1634 samples examined, 209 (12.8\%) were
   contaminated with S. aureus. A total of 125 enterotoxigenic S. aureus
   strains were biotyped and their antimicrobial resistance pattern tested.
   Most of the isolated strains produced SED (33.6\%), followed by SEA
   (18.4\%), SEC (15.2\%), SEB (6.4\%) and belonged mainly to the Human
   ecovar (50.4\%), followed by Ovine (23.2\%), Non-Host-Specific (17.6\%),
   Bovine (7.2\%) and Poultry-like (1.6\%) ecovars. Finally, the 68.8\%
   analysed strains showed antimicrobial resistance properties at least at
   one of antibiotics tested. Human biotype showed antimicrobial resistance
   at more than one antibiotic than the other biotypes (p < 0.05). The
   results provided evidence that the presence of enterotoxigenic and
   antimicrobial resistant strains of S. aureus has become remarkably
   widespread in foods. This calls for better control of sources of food
   contamination and of the spread of antimicrobial-resistance stance
   organisms. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) is a group II coronavirus that
   was firstly identified in lung samples of dogs with canine infectious
   respiratory disease (CIRD) in UK in 2003. We report for the first time
   the identification of CRCoV in Italy, together with serological evidence
   that the virus has been circulating in the Italian dog population as
   from 2005. Serological investigations on 216 dog sera, carried out by an
   ELISA test using the strictly related bovine coronavirus (BCoV) as
   antigen, revealed an overall CRCoV seroprevalence of 32.06\% in the last
   2 years. RT-PCR targeting the S-gene of CRCoV was carried out on 109
   lung samples collected from carcasses of dogs submitted for diagnostic
   investigations. Positive results were obtained from the lungs of a dog
   of the Apulia region that was co-infected with canine parvovirus type 2.
   Sequence analysis of the S-gene fragment amplified by RT-PCR (595 bp)
   showed similarity to group II coronaviruses, with the highest nucleotide
   identity (98\%) to the only CRCoV strain currently available in the
   GenBank database (strain T 101). The results of the present study show
   that CRCoV is present also in continental Europe, although further
   studies are required to determine the real pathogenic potential of the
   virus. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Bovine infertility is a major cause of loss in the livestock industry.
   In the present study bovine oviduct cell cultures were infected with a
   Chlamydophila abortus strain. A direct evaluation of infection was
   performed by means of May Grunwald-Giemsa and immunocytochemistry for
   chlamydial LPS, which revealed inclusion bodies and vacuolisation. SEM
   and TEM analysis of infected cells showed various degrees of cell damage
   and conglutination of microvilli. This finding suggests that cattle
   infertility may result from an alteration of oviduct environment caused
   by multiplication of C. abortus. This microorganism, among other
   infectious agents, could be considered a potential causative agent of
   bovine infertility. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The effects of feeding 1,3/1,6 beta-glucans on the innate and the
   adaptive immune responses of European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax)
   was investigated. Two experiments were carried out during the study. In
   the first, a number of non-specific immune parameters were examined at
   4, 7, 10, 14, 21 and 25 days of feeding fish with a semipurified diet
   containing Macrogard (c), a commercially available form of 1,3/1,6
   beta-glucans. The respiratory burst activity of head kidney macrophages
   isolated from the different groups of fish fed the immunostimulant
   peaked and subsequently decreased at different times during the
   experiment. Head kidney macrophages from fish fed 250 ppm beta-glucans
   had a statistically higher level of respiratory burst activity at Day 21
   of feeding compared with fish fed no immunostimulant. No statistical
   differences were observed in lyzozyme activity during this trial.
   In the second experiment, the effect of feeding 1,3/1,6 beta-glucans on
   ` the immune response of fish to an alginate-encapsulated Vibrio vaccine
   administered orally was examined ` Respiratory burst of head kidney
   macrophages and serum lysozyme activity decreased in all fish over the
   course of the trial, while serum lysozyme activity was considerably
   lower than values obtained in the first experiment. Fish vaccinated
   orally had significant increases in antibody response by Week 2
   post-vaccination, but beta-glucans did not appear to affect these
   levels. Vaccination may have resulted in activating the immune system as
   a whole, thus masking any difference in immunostimulation by the
   beta-glucans. It may be that the optimal doses and timing of
   beta-glucans administration is different when the immunostimulant is
   administered alone or in combination with the vaccine.
   In conclusion, European sea bass can be immunomodulated with oral
   administration of P-glucan. Optimal doses and administration times have
   been established when beta-glucans are fed alone, although further
   studies are needed to establish ideal feeding regimes for glucans
   administrated in combination with vaccination.},
