Abstract = {Prognosis and therapeutic management of dogs with cutaneous mast cell
   tumors (MCTs) depend on clinical stage and histological grade. However,
   the prognostic value of this latter is still questionable. In the
   present study, MCT transcriptome was analyzed to identify a set of
   candidate genes potentially useful for predicting the biological
   behavior of MCTs. Fifty-one canine MCT biopsies were analyzed. Isolated
   and purified total RNAs were individually hybridized to the Agilent
   Canine V2 4x44k DNA microarray. The comparison of reference
   differentiated and undifferentiated MCT transcriptome revealed a total
   of 597 differentially expressed genes (147 down-regulated and 450
   up-regulated). The functional analysis of this set of genes provided
   evidence that they were mainly involved in cell cycle, DNA replication,
   p53 signaling pathway, nucleotide excision repair and pyrimidine
   metabolism. Class prediction analysis identified 13 transcripts
   providing the greatest accuracy of class prediction and divided samples
   into two categories (differentiated and undifferentiated), harboring a
   different prognosis. The Principal Component Analysis of all samples,
   made by using the selected 13 markers, confirmed MCT classification. The
   first three components accounted for 99.924\% of the total variance.
   This molecular classification significantly correlated with survival
   time (p = 0.0026). Furthermore, among all marker genes, a significant
   association was found between mRNA expression and MCT-related mortality
   for FOXM1, GSN, FEN1 and KPNA2 (p<0.05). Finally, marker genes mRNA
   expression was evaluated in a cohort of 22 independent samples. Data
   obtained enabled to identify MCT cases with different prognosis.
   Overall, the molecular characterization of canine MCT transcriptome
   allowed the identification of a set of 13 transcripts that clearly
   separated differentiated from undifferentiated MCTs, thus predicting
   outcome regardless of the histological grade. These results may have
   clinical relevance and warrant future validation in a prospective study.},

Title = {First assessment of classical swine fever marker vaccine candidate
   CP7\_E2alf for oral immunization of wild boar under field conditions},

Abstract = {Oral vaccination against classical swine fever (CSF) is a potent tool to
   control disease outbreaks in wild boar. So far, vaccination campaigns
   have been carried out using live attenuated vaccines that do not allow
   serological differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA).
   Although this drawback is acceptable for wild boar, the use of marker
   vaccines would facilitate studies on disease and vaccination dynamics.
   Recently, the CSF marker vaccine candidate CP7\_E2alf was assessed for
   oral immunization under laboratory conditions. Promising results
   prompted efforts to study the vaccine candidate under field conditions
   and in bait formulation. In this context, two oral vaccination campaigns
   were carried out with CP7\_E2alf bait vaccines in two areas called
   `faunistic-hunting farms' in the region of Umbria, Italy. One campaign
   was conducted using single vaccination, the second with the routinely
   employed double vaccination strategy. Both campaigns were carried out
   before concerted hunting actions were performed. Bait uptake, vaccine
   virus detection and antibody responses were assessed along with
   inspections upon gutting. As a comparator, seven wild boar were hand-fed
   with baits under laboratory conditions. In the field, bait uptake ranged
   from 63.7\% to 98.7\%, whereas antibody prevalence reached only
   33.3-35.1\%. The marker serology showed a strong influence of sample
   quality on the test outcome with a total of 85\% of samples being
   classified correctly. Vaccine virus was not detectable. Under hand
   feeding conditions, six out of seven wild boar took up at least one
   bait, and five of them showed detectable antibody levels seven weeks
   after vaccination. These results were supplemented by stability tests.
   Appropriate stability of vaccine virus was shown both under field and
   laboratory conditions. In total, most results were in line with our
   expectations. However, optimization of the DIVA assay has to be
   attempted in the future. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Indirect versus direct detection methods of Trichinella spp. infection
   in wild boar (Sus scrofa)},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},
Month = {APR 7},
Abstract = {Background: Trichinella spp. infections in wild boar (Sus scrofa), one
   of the main sources of human trichinellosis, continue to represent a
   public health problem. The detection of Trichinella spp. larvae in
   muscles of wild boar by digestion can prevent the occurrence of clinical
   trichinellosis in humans. However, the analytical sensitivity of
   digestion in the detection process is dependent on the quantity of
   tested muscle. Consequently, large quantities of muscle have to be
   digested to warrant surveillance programs, or more sensitive tests need
   to be employed. The use of indirect detection methods, such as the ELISA
   to detect Trichinella spp. infections in wild boar has limitations due
   to its low specificity. The aim of the study was to implement
   serological detection of anti-Trichinella spp. antibodies in meat juices
   from hunted wild boar for the surveillance of Trichinella spp.
   infections.
   Methods: Two tests were used, ELISA for the initial screening test, and
   a specific and sensitive Western blot (Wb) as a confirmatory test. The
   circulation of anti-Trichinella IgG was determined in hunted wild boar
   muscle juice samples in 9 provinces of 5 Italian regions.
   Results: From 1,462 muscle fluid samples, 315 (21.5\%, 95\% C.I.
   19.51-23.73) were tested positive by ELISA. The 315 ELISA-positive
   muscle fluid samples were further tested by Wb and 32 (10.1\%, 95\% C.I.
   7.29-13.99) of these were positive with a final seroprevalence of 2.2\%
   (95\% C.I 1.55-3.07; 32/1,462). Trichinella britovi larvae were detected
   by artificial digestion in muscle tissues of one (0.07\%, 95\% C.I.
   0.01-0.39) out of the 1,462 hunted wild boars. No Trichinella spp.
   larvae were detected in Wb-negative wild boar. From 2006 to 2012, a
   prevalence of 0.017\% was detected by muscle digestion in wild boar
   hunted in the whole Italian territory.
   Conclusions: The combined use of both serological methods had a
   sensitivity 31.4 times higher than that of the digestion (32/1,462
   versus 1/1,462), suggesting their potential use for the surveillance of
   the Trichinella spp. infection in wild boar populations.},

Abstract = {Austropotamobius pallipes juveniles for restocking should originate from
   native breeders to preserve the genetic integrity of the populations. We
   compared the reproductive performance in captivity of A. pallipes
   populations of four drainage basins of the Abruzzi Region to assess
   their reproductive efficiency and improve their aquaculture. The
   broodstock were collected before the breeding season and reproduction
   took place in an experimental hatchery. The female carapace length
   ranged from 35.4 to 59.0 mm. Spawning occurred in 84\% of females (range
   69-93\%) and the mean number of eggs per female was 89 (range 80-104).
   No significant differences were observed among the groups. Close to
   hatching, two groups maintained a high percentage of egg-bearing females
   (52\%) and a high number of eggs, while the other groups lost most of
   their eggs. At the end of the cycle, the stage 2 juveniles obtained
   represented 19.5\% of the initial egg number. The efficiency for stage 2
   juvenile production ranged from 48.2 to 0.1\%, and the mean number of
   stage 2 juveniles per female ranged from 42.2 to 1. These differences
   were not attributable to maternal size, but the characteristics of the
   brooks of origin might have influenced the reproductive performances of
   crayfish in the hatchery.},

Abstract = {Cd bioaccumulation pattern was investigated in Mediterranean spider crab
   (Maya squinado, Herbst, 1788) collected from the northern Adriatic Sea.
   Specimens were caught in the framework of a monitoring plan in order to
   quantify the Cd distribution into different organs and tissues of crab.
   For this purpose, Cd level was studied in appendages, cephalothorax,
   abdomen as well as gonads. Cd concentrations were found largely below
   the Maximum Level (ML) established at the European Union (EU) level for
   muscle from crab appendages (found mean 0.011 mg kg(-1)) and
   approximately amounted to 2\% of the EU ML (0.50 mg kg(-1)). The higher
   Cd concentrations were found in organs and tissues included in crab body
   such as abdomen, chephalotorax and gonads with respect to appendages.
   Chephalotorax showed the highest metal concentration (mean value of 1.19
   mg kg(-1)). The possible differences in Cd bioaccumulation rate among
   crab organs and tissues were also investigated applying a parametric
   linear regression. A major Cd bioaccumulation rate was revealed in
   chephalotorax with respect to other analyzed organs and tissues.
   Furthermore, the evaluation of health risk related to human consumption
   of the Mediterranean spider crab has been studied for median of total
   population, median and 95th percentile of consumers of Italy. The
   observed results highlighted that the consumption of organs and tissues
   included in crab body such as abdomen, gonads and, in particular,
   chephalotorax substantially increased the Cd intake reaching also
   alarming Estimated Weekly Intake (EWI) values especially for median and
   95th percentile of Italian consumers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {ANIMAL},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {A retrospective study on seasonal variations in the characteristics of
   cow's milk and temperature-humidity index (THI) relationship was
   conducted on bulk milk data collected from 2003 to 2009. The THI
   relationship study was carried out on 508 613 bulk milk data items
   recorded in 3328 dairy farms form the Lombardy region, Italy.
   Temperature and relative humidity data from 40 weather stations were
   used to calculate THI. Milk characteristics data referred to somatic
   cell count (SCC), total bacterial count (TBC), fat percentage (FA\%) and
   protein percentage (PR\%). Annual, seasonal and monthly variations in
   milk composition were evaluated on 656 064 data items recorded in 3727
   dairy farms. The model highlighted a significant association between the
   year, season and month, and the parameters analysed (SCC, TBC, FA\%,
   PR\%). The summer season emerged as the most critical season. Of the
   summer months, July presented the most critical conditions for TBC, FA\%
   and PR\%, (52 054 +/- 183 655, 3.73\% +/- 0.35\% and 3.30\% +/- 0.15\%,
   respectively), and August presented higher values of SCC (369 503 +/-
   228 377). Each milk record was linked to THI data calculated at the
   nearest weather station. The analysis demonstrated a positive
   correlation between THI and SCC and TBC, and indicated a significant
   change in the slope at 57.3 and 72.8 maximum THI, respectively. The
   model demonstrated a negative correlation between THI and FA\% and PR\%
   and provided breakpoints in the pattern at 50.2 and 65.2 maximum THI,
   respectively. The results of this study indicate the presence of
   critical climatic thresholds for bulk tank milk composition in dairy
   cows. Such indications could facilitate the adoption of heat management
   strategies, which may ensure the health and production of dairy cows and
   limit related economic losses.},

Abstract = {The impact of weather variables on Culex pipiens L. (Diptera: Culicidae)
   population dynamics in the Po Valley, Northern Italy, a densely
   populated region containing the largest industrial and agricultural
   areas in Italy, was investigated. Monitoring of mosquitoes was carried
   out by using CO2-baited traps without light, collecting data weekly from
   1700 to 0900 hours during the period May-September, from 1997 to 2011.
   Daily minimum, average, and maximum relative humidity; daily minimum,
   maximum, and average temperature; rainfall; and hydroclimatic balance
   (rainfall-potential evapotranspiration) were obtained from three weather
   stations within the surveillance zone. The average population dynamic
   trend over the 15-yr period showed a bell-shaped curve with a major peak
   in June and a secondary peak at the end of August in the rural areas,
   whereas bimodality was not evidenced in the urban areas. The correlation
   analyses showed that the mosquito seasonal population and the population
   in the period of maximum West Nile virus circulation (August-September)
   was mostly affected by the relative humidity registered from March to
   July, particularly in May, and, to a lower extent, also by hydroclimatic
   balance registered in April-July, and by the rainfall occurred in
   June-July. In addition, the rate of increase of the population during
   the spring months influenced the development of the mosquito population
   of the following months.},

Volume = {100},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to improve the cultivation of Leishmania
   promastigotes without the use of common, semisolid culture media such as
   Evans' modified Tobie's medium (EMTM), liquid RPMI 1640, and
   Peptone-yeast extract medium (P-Y). Although EMTM medium permits the
   growth of a high number of parasites, it is technically difficult to
   prepare as it requires the use of fresh rabbit blood from animals bred
   on farms, while RPMI 1640 and P-Y show lower growth rates than the EMTM.
   There is, therefore, a need to develop new blood-free and time-saving
   culture systems. The aim of this paper is to propose new modified
   microbiological media, named RPMI-PY and Tobie-PY, to isolate Leishmania
   and cultivate parasites for research and diagnostic purposes. This study
   compares classic culture media to the new media, RPMI-PY and Tobie-PY,
   and demonstrates that the new media have superior performance in terms
   of time and parasitic load. The growth rate of the parasite was
   significantly higher at 24, 48, and 72 hr cultivation, based on counts
   using Burker's chambers, when compared to classic media. This study was
   carried out at the National References Centre for Leishmaniasis (C. Re.
   Na. L.) where the isolation procedures are conducted daily from a number
   of different biological matrices.},

Abstract = {Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Mhyo) is the principal etiological agent of
   enzootic pneumonia (EP), one of the most economically important diseases
   in the pig production industry worldwide. Although swine and wild boars
   (Sus scrofa) share susceptibility to Mhyo infection, information
   regarding the dynamics of Mhyo infections and pathology in wild boars is
   currently limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the
   spatiotemporal dynamics of Mhyo infections in free-living wild boars
   through serological ELISA testing. Additionally, the presence of EP-like
   gross lesions and their association with the presence of Mhyo, based on
   a PCR assay, were assessed. Over a period of 5 years, antibodies against
   Mhyo were detected in 655 (30.0 \%) of the 2,177 analyzed wild boars. A
   generalized temporal increase of seroprevalence coupled with an increase
   of mean antibody titers of seropositive individuals was found. Moreover,
   a similar seroprevalence between age classes associated with higher
   antibody titers of younger individuals indicated the wild boars were
   infected during the early stages of their life. Out of 99 lungs tested,
   43 showed EP-like lesions and 45 were PCR positive for the presence of
   Mhyo DNA. The lung lesion scores were related to the sex and age of the
   wild boars, with young individuals having higher lung scores than
   others, and there was a positive association with the Mhyo PCR-positive
   status. The temporal increase of the Mhyo seroprevalence and infection
   association with EP-like lesions, when coupled with the spreading of
   wild boar populations, raises concerns on the epidemiological role of
   this species.},

Abstract = {During tuberculosis (TB) surveillance, 53 hunted red deer (Germs
   elaphus) were collected to determine whether TB was present in
   free-ranging animals from an Italian alpine area. Samples (lungs, liver,
   intestine, and lymph nodes) were cultured and analyzed by real-time PCR
   assay carried out directly on tissue. Mycobacterium caprae was isolated
   from small granulomatous, tuberculosis-like lesions in the liver of a
   12-yr-old female. Identification of suspect colonies was done by PCR
   restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the gyrb gene, and
   genotyping was performed by spoligotyping and mycobacterial interspersed
   repetitive unit variable number tandem repeat analysis. The isolated
   strain was genetically identical to strains isolated in the study area
   in 2001 from dairy cows imported from Austria and in 2010 from an
   indigenous cow. The genotype, called ``Lechtal,{''} is the most
   frequently detected in the TB outbreaks in Austria and Germany. The
   possibility that red deer act as a maintenance host of M. caprae between
   TB outbreaks could be not excluded. Despite the high red deer population
   density, the detection of only one infected red deer could suggest that
   the wildlife management measures applied in the study area (prohibition
   of artificial feeding and secure removal of offal from hunted animals)
   may reduce the risk of TB spreading.},

Title = {Genome-wide analysis of Italian sheep diversity reveals a strong
   geographic pattern and cryptic relationships between breeds},

Abstract = {Italy counts several sheep breeds, arisen over centuries as a
   consequence of ancient and recent genetic and demographic events. To
   finely reconstruct genetic structure and relationships between Italian
   sheep, 496 subjects from 19 breeds were typed at 50K single nucleotide
   polymorphism loci. A subset of foreign breeds from the Sheep HapMap
   dataset was also included in the analyses. Genetic distances (as
   visualized either in a network or in a multidimensional scaling analysis
   of identical by state distances) closely reflected geographic proximity
   between breeds, with a clear north-south gradient, likely because of
   high levels of past gene flow and admixture all along the peninsula.
   Sardinian breeds diverged more from other breeds, a probable consequence
   of the combined effect of ancient sporadic introgression of feral
   mouflon and long-lasting genetic isolation from continental sheep
   populations. The study allowed the detection of previously undocumented
   episodes of recent introgression (Delle Langhe into the endangered
   Altamurana breed) as well as signatures of known, or claimed, historical
   introgression (Merino into Sopravissana and Gentile di Puglia;
   Bergamasca into Fabrianese, Appenninica and, to a lesser extent,
   Leccese). Arguments that would question, from a genomic point of view,
   the current breed classification of Bergamasca and Biellese into two
   separate breeds are presented. Finally, a role for traditional
   transhumance practices in shaping the genetic makeup of Alpine sheep
   breeds is proposed. The study represents the first exhaustive analysis
   of Italian sheep diversity in an European context, and it bridges the
   gap in the previous HapMap panel between Western Mediterranean and Swiss
   breeds.},

Abstract = {The microbial composition of artisan and industrial animal rennet pastes
   was studied by using both culture-dependent and -in-dependent
   approaches. Pyrosequencing targeting the 16S rRNA gene allowed to
   identify 361 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) to the genus/species
   level. Among lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Streptococcus thermophilus and
   some lactobacilli, mainly Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus
   reuteri, were the most abundant species, with differences among the
   samples. Twelve groups of microorganisms were targeted by viable plate
   counts revealing a dominance of mesophilic cocci. All rennets were able
   to acidify ultrahigh-temperature-processed (UHT) milk as shown by pH and
   total titratable acidity (TTA). Presumptive LAB isolated at the highest
   dilutions of acidified milks were phenotypically characterized, grouped,
   differentiated at the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic
   DNA(RAPD)-PCR analysis, and subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Only
   18 strains were clearly identified at the species level, as Enterococcus
   casseliflavus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus
   lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and Streptococcus thermophilus, while
   the other strains, all belonging to the genus Enterococcus, could not be
   allotted into any previously described species. The phylogenetic
   analysis showed that these strains might represent different unknown
   species. All strains were evaluated for their dairy technological
   performances. All isolates produced diacetyl, and 10 of them produced a
   rapid pH drop in milk, but only 3 isolates were also autolytic. This
   work showed that animal rennet pastes can be sources of LAB, mainly
   enterococci, that might contribute to the microbial diversity associated
   with dairy productions.},

Abstract = {Dogs share with humans several zoonotic diseases as well as some
   important determinants of degenerative syndromes and tumours. For this
   reason, systematic surveillance on small animal disease carried out
   through the collection and analysis of necropsy records could be helpful
   to public health. To describe the causes of death in dogs from the
   province of Rome ( Italy) submitted to the Istituto Zooprofilattico
   Sperimentale del Lazio e della Toscana for necropsy during 2003-2007, a
   retrospective study was conducted on diagnostic data of 870 dogs. The
   final diagnosis was established by anatomo-histopathological
   examinations and, when needed, by ancillary laboratory tests. The most
   common causes of death were `infectious disease' (23\%) and `poisoning'
   (17\%). In 5\% of the cases, the cause remained undetermined. The
   frequency of `poisoning' was higher (39\%) in stray dogs, while
   `infectious disease' was more frequent (49\%) in dogs from breeding
   farms. Parvovirosis was the most frequent infectious disease (33\%)
   while anticoagulants accounted for 30\% of the cases involving toxicity.
   Death by neoplastic lesions was quite infrequent (7\%). Findings from
   this study provide veterinarians with an overview of the causes of death
   in dogs and it could provide public health authorities with new data

Abstract = {Anthrax is a non-contagious infectious disease; it primarily affects
   herbivores, but all mammals, including humans, can be affected. Humans
   may contract anthrax directly or indirectly from infected animals.
   Veterinary surveillance systems, providing information about animal and
   human cases, should increase the efficacy of the animal anthrax
   management in order to protect population. Any aspect of the disease
   should be carefully monitored to implement effective prevention and
   control strategies. In this paper we propose a new, detailed
   classification of anthrax outbreaks, based on the source of the
   infection and the risk level for humans. We describe three different
   types of animal outbreaks and suggest the most effective procedures for
   their management and prevention.},

Abstract = {The introduction of the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes (Stegomya) albopictus
   (Diptera: Culicidae) into temperate regions poses serious concerns for
   the risk of the spreading of arboviral epidemics, as confirmed by the
   Chikungunya fever outbreak in Italy. This article describes the
   implementation and the results of a strategy for the pest management
   implemented over 4 years in Pesaro (a city in the Marche region, Italy).
   The strategy used 60 integrated wide-sized ovitraps for monitoring
   purposes. Twenty-day larvicide-based treatment cycles were implemented
   for the manholes of the urban area and also the inhabitants were
   involved in pest control relating to their own properties. It was
   observed that the weekly median of eggs laid decreased consistently from
   2008 to 2011, indicating the good performance of the vector control and
   a reduction in the related epidemics risk.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to establish whether climate change affected
   migratory behaviour of Sepia officinalis (Linnaeus, 1758), which is an
   important resource for small-scale fishermen of Abruzzo region (Italy).
   Starting at the beginning of March until the end of April, the
   cuttlefish in this area migrates from deep cold water towards warmer
   coastal waters, where they spawn. Small-scale fishing of cuttlefish is
   permitted in costal waters from March to September. During the study
   period, between March and September 2008, both cuttlefish traps and
   trammel nets were used in 5 sampling areas along the Abruzzo coast to
   test their relative efficiency in catching cuttlefish. Trapped specimens
   were counted, weighed and measured, their gender and sexual maturity
   were also determined. The data obtained from the sampling were
   correlated to surface water temperature to assess possible changes in
   migration behaviours. The obtained data show that during the first
   months of migration (March and April), a greater percentage of large
   males was caught, while females and smaller males predominated later in
   the year. The study also showed that surface water temperature did not
   reveal any significant shifts from the trend over the last 10 years. As
   for the efficiency of the fishing methods, traps were found to be more
   effective than trammel nets.},

Title = {Influence of partial introduction of protein sources alternative to

Abstract = {Pea (Pisum sativum L.) and Faba bean (Vicia faba L. var. minor) are
   valuable sources of protein and energy for monogastric animals,
   traditionally cultivated in the Mediterranean area. They can partially
   or even totally replace soybean meal, that is very expensive and often
   derived from GM plants. The aim of this study was to evaluate some
   immunological and metabolical parameters in fattening pigs fed diets
   containing pea or faba bean meal as partial substitution of soybean.
   The trial was carried out using 30 post-weaned female piglets divided
   into three dietary treatments formulated to be isoenergetic and
   isoproteic; one group received only soybean as protein source while the
   others received 20\% of pea and 18\% of faba bean as partial
   substitution of soybean. At the beginning (T0), in the intermediate
   stage (T1) and at the end of the trial (T2), blood samples were taken
   from the tail vein. The following parameters were investigated in serum:
   ALP, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, cholesterol, glucose, NEFA, total
   protein, triglycerides, GGT, albumin, bactericidal activity, haemolytic
   complement, lysozyme. Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA
   including in the model the diet, the date of sampling and their
   interaction; the values at T0 were used as covariate.
   The different diets affected only NEFA while the date of sampling
   affected several parameters: cholesterol, triglycerides, bactericidal
   activity (p<0.05) and ALP, glucose and lysozyme (p<0.01).
   Some parameters resulted out of the normality range (AST, cholesterol,
   NEFA, triglycerides, albumin, bactericidal activity, haemolytic
   complement) independently from the diet and from the date of sampling
   with the exception of glucose, which in the second sample, returned in
   the normal range. From these results it can be observed that the tested
   diets did not result in changes in metabolic and immunological profile
   of pigs during fattening, then faba beans and peas could partially
   substitute soybean in fattening pigs diets.},

Abstract = {The effects of penethamate hydriodide (Mamyzin, Boehringer Ingelheim,
   Ingelheim, Germany) on udder health and milk yields were evaluated in
   primiparous Mediterranean buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis). An intramuscular
   administration of 10 million international units was performed in 20
   buffaloes at 7 d precalving (treatment group; TG), and 20 animals were
   enrolled as the control group (CG). Evening milk samplings were
   performed at 10, 30, and 60 d in milk (DIM). Somatic cell count (SCC)
   values were evaluated on composite milk samples, whereas bacteriological
   culture and California Mastitis Test were performed on quarter milk.
   Daily milk yields were recorded after all milkings. After 60 DIM,
   composite milk samples from each animal were collected for monthly SCC
   and bacteriological culture until drying off. Statistically significant
   differences were found between the prevalence of mastitic quarters in
   the 2 groups at 10 and 30 DIM, and between the incidence of mastitic
   animals during the examined period (TG: 4/20, 20\% vs. CG: 10/20, 50\%).
   Even though lower and higher values of SCC and milk yields were found in
   TG during each sampling, statistically significant differences were only
   found at 30 (SCC) and 60 DIM (milk yields). In our study, the antibiotic
   administration precalving showed good bactericidal activity against the
   most common udder-specific pathogens that cause mastitis in primiparous
   Mediterranean buffaloes, and greater efficacy was observed at 10 and 30
   DIM compared with 60 DIM. Given the significant decrease in SCC and
   increase in yields achieved, use of this antibiotic could be
   economically beneficial in buffalo breeding.},

Title = {Effect of long transport and environmental conditions on behaviour and
   blood parameters of postweaned piglets with different reactivity to
   backtest},
Journal = {LIVESTOCK SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {162},
Pages = {201-208},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In order to evaluate the effect of long transport on weaned piglets
   transported under warm weather conditions, 144 piglets, previously
   submitted to a backtest during nursing, were monitored during 4
   journeys, each lasting 14 h, carried out from May to September 2009.
   Into the truck, piglets were allocated in 8 pens on the basis of
   backtest classification identified as High Resisting (HR), Low resisting
   (LR), Mixed (M) and Mixed at Loading (MAL). During transport, truck air
   temperature, skin temperatures and postural and behavioural occurrences
   were recorded. Prior to and after transportation, blood samples and body
   weight were also recorded. Piglets lost 5\% of their body weight.
   Environmental conditions affected slightly the behaviour of piglets
   which were more active during the first 4 h of transport. The behaviour
   of the piglets was significantly influenced by the type of pen since
   some differences in biting and exploratory behaviours were found in M
   pens. Conversely, no differences were found between HR and LR pens.
   Significant variations with respect to the baseline levels were found
   only for glucose which decreased and for urea which increased after
   journey as a result of the prolonged fasting.
   In general, the results suggest that long-lasting journeys did not have
   consistent effects on physiological and behavioural parameters of
   early-weaned piglets while grouping and mixing procedures may affect how
   they cope with transport. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Avian influenza (AI) viruses of the H7 subtype have the potential to
   evolve into highly pathogenic (HP) viruses that represent a major
   economic problem for the poultry industry and a threat to global health.
   However, the emergence of HPAI viruses from low-pathogenic (LPAI)
   progenitor viruses currently is poorly understood. To investigate the
   origin and evolution of one of the most important avian influenza
   epidemics described in Europe, we investigated the evolutionary and
   spatial dynamics of the entire genome of 109 H7N1 (46 LPAI and 63 HPAI)
   viruses collected during Italian H7N1 outbreaks between March 1999 and
   February 2001. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the LPAI and HPAI
   epidemics shared a single ancestor, that the HPAI strains evolved from
   the LPAI viruses in the absence of reassortment, and that there was a
   parallel emergence of mutations among HPAI and later LPAI lineages.
   Notably, an ultradeep-sequencing analysis demonstrated that some of the
   amino acid changes characterizing the HPAI virus cluster were already
   present with low frequency within several individual viral populations
   from the beginning of the LPAI H7N1 epidemic. A Bayesian phylogeographic
   analysis revealed stronger spatial structure during the LPAI outbreak,
   reflecting the more rapid spread of the virus following the emergence of
   HPAI. The data generated in this study provide the most complete
   evolutionary and phylogeographic analysis of epidemiologically
   intertwined high- and low-pathogenicity viruses undertaken to date and
   highlight the importance of implementing prompt eradication measures
   against LPAI to prevent the appearance of viruses with fitness
   advantages and unpredictable pathogenic properties.},

Abstract = {Global warming is linked to the reduction of green house gas emissions
   (GHG). The anaerobic digestion of animal manure and energy crops is a
   promising way of reducing GHG emissions.
   The increasing number of biogas plants involves a high consumption of
   energy crops and the needed of big agricultural area. In Italy, cereals
   silages are the main feedstock for biogas production and are commonly
   grown under two different crop systems: single crop (only maize) and
   double crops (maize later winter cereals).
   In this paper we present the results of experimental field tests carried
   out by monitoring the anaerobic biomethane potential (BMP) of different
   cereals silages commonly grown in the Padanian Plan.
   A laboratory device has been developed to measure the specific
   biomethane production of the different cereal silages. The different
   energy crops have been evaluated, in single and double crop systems,
   expressing the biomethane production per hectare.
   The maize hybrids show higher specific biomethane potentials respect to
   winter cereals. Maize FAO class 700 achieves the highest production per
   hectare as a single crop. Nevertheless, the highest biomethane
   productions per hectare are reached with double crop system in
   particular when maize FAO class 500 follows triticale (+12\% respect the
   best single crop system). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Assessing pig welfare at stunning in Northern Italy commercial abattoirs
   using electrical method},
Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Pages = {87-91},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {According to Council Regulation 1099/2009 regular checks at stunning are
   compulsory to ensure that the animals do not present any signs of
   consciousness or sensibility in the period between the end of the
   stunning process and death. So far there are no data available on the
   prevalence of correctly electrically stunned pigs in Italy and on the
   signs more effective to use in practice to evaluate poorly stunned
   animals or return of consciousness. The aim of this study was to
   evaluate the prevalence of correctly stunned pigs by electrical stun in
   Italian commercial abattoirs through the clinical analysis of signs of
   consciousness. Four commercial abattoirs using three different electric
   stunning systems were studied to assess the efficiency of stunning. The
   abattoirs A and C used head-only manual stunning with an intensity >=
   1.3A; the abattoir D used head-only manual stunning with an intensity
   0.4 - 2A and the abattoir B used head-heart automatic stunning with an
   intensity >= 2.5A and >= 1A for the head and the chest respectively. A
   total of 1620 heavy pigs were evaluated from stunning to complete
   bleeding to evaluate the presence of signs of consciousness (animal
   alert, presence of rhythmic breathing, head uplift, pain reaction) and
   other signs (vocalizations, tongue movements, etc.). At the end of the
   observation the evaluator expressed a judgment concerning the state of
   consciousness for each pig conscious: presence of rhythmic breathing
   and/or pain reaction and/or righting reflex and/or the animal appeared
   alert; unconscious: presence of loss of posture, tonic phase, and clonic
   phase (not for head-heart automatic stunning); absence of rhythmic
   breathing, pain reaction, righting reflex; doubtful: not clear presence
   of rhythmic breathing or pain reaction or righting reflex. A
   statistically significant difference was observed in the distribution of
   the state of consciousness between the different abattoirs (p=0.01) and
   between the three different stunning systems (p=0.04). Abattoir B
   resulted to be more efficient (0\% conscious; 0.25\% doubtful) in
   stunning, compared to the others: abattoir A (0.5\% conscious; 1.5\%
   doubtful); C (2\% conscious; 0.5\% doubtful); D (1.7\% conscious; 0.7\%
   doubtful). Pain reaction, rhythmic respiration and head uplift could be
   used as practical key parameters for a regular evaluation of stunning,
   however future investigations are needed to better clarify their
   effectiveness taking into consideration the site of application of tongs
   and the current applied to each animal. The importance of tongue
   movements in apparently unconscious animals should be also investigated
   with more attention. No correlation was found between the state of
   consciousness and any of the anamnestic variables considered (signs of
   recent fighting; weight higher or lower than the range; signs of
   stress).},

Title = {On the relation between soil moisture dynamics and the geographical
   distribution of Culicoides imicola},
Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {622-632},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Culicoides imicola is the main biological vector in the transmission of
   the Bluetongue virus in the Mediterranean basin. Its geographical range
   is constrained by environmental characteristics, and soil moisture has
   been proposed as an important constraint because of its effect on C.
   imicola breeding habitat. The few field studies on breeding habitat of
   C. imicola indicate the favourability of (semi-)moist habitat that is
   not flooded. Data on C. imicola in Calabria revealed the presence of C.
   imicola at the eastern Ionian coastal area and the absence at the
   greater part of the western Tyrrhenian coastal area. A spatially
   distributed soil moisture model was applied to obtain daily soil
   moisture estimates for Calabria and to assess the relationship between
   soil moisture and the particular C. imicola distribution at the study
   region. The temporal soil moisture pattern was not significantly
   different between locations of contrasting C. imicola occurrence. The
   monthly average volumetric soil moisture content, however, was found to
   differ substantially. Soil moisture conditions of the topsoil at
   locations of C. imicola presence were consistently wetter. Particularly
   in August, at the onset of the season of high C. imicola abundance, soil
   moisture was significantly higher at the presence sites and sustained
   the larval stages of the C. imicola life cycle. This study provides
   evidence that soil moisture imposes an important constraint on the
   geographical distribution of C. imicola. Soil moisture may therefore be
   considered as a key environmental variable for the delineation of
   suitableC. imicola habitat. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {Vibrio is a very diverse genus that is responsible for different human
   and animal diseases. The accurate identification of Vibrio at the
   species level is important to assess the risks related to public health
   and diseases caused by aquatic organisms. The ecology of Vibrio spp.,
   together with their genetic background, represents an important key for
   species discrimination and evolution. Thus, analyses of population
   structure and ecology association are necessary for reliable
   characterization of bacteria and to investigate whether bacterial
   species are going through adaptation processes. In this study, a
   population of Vibrionaceae was isolated from shellfish of the Venice
   lagoon and analyzed in depth to study its structure and distribution in
   the environment. A multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) was developed on
   the basis of four housekeeping genes. Both molecular and biochemical
   approaches were used for species characterization, and the results were
   compared to assess the consistency of the two methods. In addition,
   strain ecology and the association between genetic information and
   environment were investigated through statistical models. The
   phylogenetic and population analyses achieved good species clustering,
   while biochemical identification was demonstrated to be imprecise. In
   addition, this study provided a fine-scale overview of the distribution
   of Vibrio spp. in the Venice lagoon, and the results highlighted a
   preferential association of the species toward specific ecological
   variables. These findings support the use of MLSA for taxonomic studies
   and demonstrate the need to consider environmental information to obtain
   broader and more accurate bacterial characterization.},

Abstract = {Choroid plexus papilloma (CPP) is a rare, benign, intracranial neoplasm.
   The present report described a choroid plexus papilloma of the fourth
   ventricle with unusual proliferative reaction of ependymal/subependymal
   cells in a stallion. A single, soft neoformation, red-gray in color,
   with an irregular surface, resembling a cauliflower, expanding from the
   fourth ventricle to the cerebellar peduncles was observed.
   Microscopically, the neoformation was composed of a single layer of
   simple cuboidal to columnar epithelium with a well-vascularized
   papillary-arboriform pattern. Multifocal subependymal aggregates forming
   rosettes were observed near the mesencephalic aqueduct (MA).
   Glial-fibrillary-acidic-protein (GFAP) was markedly positive only in the
   neuropil adjacent to the proliferative areas of the MA.
   Ependymal/subependymal reactions secondary to CPP have never been
   described in equine or human neuropathology. The capabilities of
   ependymal cells to regenerate and eventually proliferate are
   controversial and unclear and, thus, require additional investigation to
   understand the adaptive mechanisms of this rare pathogenic condition.

Abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a major concern in
   environmental studies as many of them have been labeled as probable
   carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC
   1983). Due to their lipophilic properties and resistance to degradation,
   PAHs can accumulate in organic tissue. As a consequence, alarming
   concentrations of these compounds have been found in many aquatic
   species. The European catfish (Silurus glanis) is a top food chain
   predator that is considered to be a reliable bio-indicator of
   environmental pollution. From 2009 to 2011, 54 specimens of S. glanis
   were captured from four different sites covering the area of the Po
   River basin (Northern Italy). Fish muscles were analyzed in the
   laboratory to determine the levels of nine PAHs, namely naphthalene,
   acenaphthene, fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene, pyrene,
   benz{[}a]anthracene, chrysene, and benz{[}a]pyrene (BaP), which were
   detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The total
   average concentration of PAHs was 26.90 +/- 49.50 ng g(-1) (min 0.60,
   max 275.75 ng g(-1)). Analysis showed that 9.20 \% of the fish muscles
   exceeded the maximum levels of 2 ng g(-1) set for BaP by European
   regulations (Commission Regulation (EC), 2006). Values measured for
   benz{[}a]pyrene ranged from 0.05 to 8.20 ng g(-1) (mean 1.07 +/- 1.58 ng
   g(-1)). Chrysene and benz{[}a]anthracene, both considered potential
   human carcinogens (PAH2), were found at levels of 4.40 and 0.05 ng g(-1)
   (mean values), respectively. The highest mean concentration was recorded
   for anthracene (12.92 ng g(-1)), which has been recently included in the
   list of substances of very high concern (SVHC) as reported by the
   European Chemicals Agency (ECHA 1-9, 2009).},

Abstract = {In veal calf production, growth promoters are still illicitly used.
   Surveillance of misuse of such molecules is necessary to preserve human
   health. Methods currently adopted for their analysis are based on liquid
   chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, but their efficacy can be
   affected by undetectable residual concentrations in biological matrices
   due to treatments at low-dosage or based on unknown anabolic compounds.
   The development of screening methods to identify the indirect biological
   effects of administration of growth promoters can improve the efficiency
   of drug residue monitoring. To this purpose, an integrated approach has
   been used to further validate the set of protein biomarkers defined in a
   previous controlled study to detect the use of corticosteroids through
   the changes caused in muscle protein expression. The thymus morphology
   of 48 samples collected under field conditions was evaluated to assess
   the presence of potential corticosteroids treatment. Animals were
   divided on the basis of their thymus characteristics in negative or
   suspected for illegal corticosteroids treatment. Drug residue analyses
   were performed on the liver, giving a satisfactory correlation with the
   histological examination (similar to 85\%). Finally, the proteomics
   analysis of muscle protein extracts was carried out by 2D differential
   in gel electrophoresis, and proteins that were differentially expressed
   between the two animal groups (p value <0.01) were selected for
   MALDI-MS/MS analysis. This approach allowed us to identify 29 different
   proteins, and our findings indicate that the altered protein expression
   pattern can be used as an indirect method for the detection of illicit
   corticosteroids administration. A subset of the identified proteins was
   already reported in a previous controlled study, proving that these
   biomarkers can be used to develop a screening assay to improve the tools
   currently available for the detection of corticosteroids abuse in bovine
   meat production.},

Abstract = {The need for antibiotic treatments in dairy cattle farms can be reduced
   by a combined intervention scheme based on: (1) timely clinical
   inspections, (2) the assessment of animal-based welfare parameters, and
   (3) the use of predictive laboratory tests. These can provide greater
   insight into environmental adaptation of dairy cows and define animals
   at risk of contracting disease. In the long-term, an improved disease
   control justifies the adoption of such a combined strategy. Many
   antibiotic treatments for chronic disease cases are often not justified
   with a cost/benefit analysis, because the repeated drug administration
   does not give rise to the expected outcome in terms of animal health. In
   particular, compared with untreated cases, antibiotics may not lead to
   greater cure rates for some forms of mastitis. Lastly, a substantial
   reduction of antibiotic usage in dairy farms can be achieved through the
   proper use of immuno-modulators, aimed at increasing immunocompetence
   and disease resistance of cows. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The immunotoxic effects of heavy metals on blood leukocytes of sea bass
   (Dicentrarchus labrax) were examined. The cells, separated by a
   discontinuous Percoll-gradients, were exposed in vitro to various
   sublethal concentrations of cadmium and copper (10(-7) M, 10(-5) M, and
   10(-3) M) and their immunotoxic effect was then evaluated by measuring
   neutral red uptake, MU assay, DNA fragmentation and Hsp70 gene
   expression. First of all, we demonstrated that the cells treated in
   vitro could incorporate Cd and Cu. A relationship between heavy metal
   exposure and dose-time-dependent alterations in responses of leukocytes
   from blood was found for both metals, but copper was more immunotoxic
   than cadmium in all assays performed. A significant reduction in the
   cells' ability to uptake neutral red and viability by MU assay was
   recorded, indicating that both cadmium and copper could change the
   membrane permeability, inducing cellular apoptosis when the
   concentration of metals reached 10(-3) M. The apoptotic effect may also
   explain the high level of cytotoxicity found when the leukocytes were
   exposed to higher concentration of metals. These results demonstrated
   that toxic effect of copper and cadmium affect on the mechanisms of
   cell-mediated immunity reducing the immune defences of the organism. (C)

Abstract = {Viral encephalopathy and retinopathy (VER), otherwise known as viral
   nervous necrosis (VNN), is a severe pathological condition caused by RNA
   viruses belonging to the Nodaviridae family, genus Betanodavirus. The
   disease, described in more than 50 fish species worldwide, is considered
   as the most serious viral threat affecting marine farmed species in the
   Mediterranean region, thus representing one of the bottlenecks for
   further development of the aquaculture industry. To date, four different
   genotypes have been identified, namely red-spotted grouper nervous
   necrosis virus (RGNNV), striped jack nervous necrosis virus (SJNNV),
   tiger puffer nervous necrosis virus and barfin flounder nervous necrosis
   virus, with the RGNNV genotype appearing as the most widespread in the
   Mediterranean region, although SJNNV-type strains and reassortant
   viruses have also been reported. The existence of these genetically
   different strains could be the reason for the differences in mortality
   observed in the field. However, very little experimental data are
   available on the pathogenicity of these viruses in farmed fish.
   Therefore, in this study, the pathogenicity of 10 isolates has been
   assessed with an in vivo trial. The investigation was conducted using
   the European sea bass, the first target fish species for the disease in
   the Mediterranean basin. Naive fish were challenged by immersion and
   clinical signs and mortality were recorded for 68days; furthermore,
   samples collected at selected time points were analysed to evaluate the
   development of the infection. Finally, survivors were weighed to
   estimate the growth reduction. The statistically supported results
   obtained in this study demonstrated different pathogenicity patterns,
   underlined the potential risk represented by different strains in the
   transmission of the infection to highly susceptible species and
   highlighted the indirect damage caused by a clinical outbreak of
   VER/VNN.},

Abstract = {The European region has been, and remains, a global leader in the
   development of animal welfare policies. The region has a great diversity
   of cultures and religions, different levels of socio-economic
   development, and varied legislation, policies and practices.
   Nevertheless, there are common drivers for animal welfare policy based
   on a history of animal welfare ethics and obligations to animal users
   and society in general. A unifying goal of countries in the region is to
   achieve sustainable compliance with the World Organisation for Animal
   Health (OIE) standards on animal health and welfare. Ethics is the
   overarching driver, supported by the actions of governmental,
   inter-governmental and non-governmental activities, markets and trade,
   science and knowledge. Historically, organisations involved in promoting
   animal welfare have tended to act in isolation. For example,
   non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have run campaigns to influence
   retailers and the welfare policies of their farmer suppliers.
   Increasingly, different organisations with common or complementary goals
   are working together. For example, competent authorities,
   inter-governmental bodies and NGOs have combined their efforts to
   address dog population control across several countries in the region.
   Also, animal welfare is becoming integrated into the corporate social
   responsibility targets of private companies. Science and knowledge, as
   drivers and tools, are assisting with the harmonisation of welfare
   standards, e.g. by providing a common basis for measuring welfare
   impacts through animal-based measures and widespread sharing of this
   information. Current trends suggest that there will be greater
   collaboration among the organisations driving change, and increasing
   convergence of animal welfare strategies and welfare assessment tools.
   The result will be increased harmonisation of animal welfare standards
   throughout the region.},

Abstract = {A case of acute toxoplasmosis in an adolescent girl, almost certainly
   related to the consumption of raw sausage, is described. The girl
   suffered of fever and weakness and presented a swollen lymph node in the
   submandibular region. Serology analysis was positive for Toxoplasma
   gondii and excluded other infections. Further analysis, with avidity
   test and immunoblot, confirmed the acute toxoplasmosis. She reported
   that about a month before the appearance of the symptoms, she had eaten
   a piece of raw sausage while it was being prepared by her father. We
   analyzed sausage samples prepared from this same batch that had been
   frozen for later consumption, and they demonstrated evidence of T.
   gondii DNA when using a specific nested PCR assay. The sausage was
   prepared from the meat of a pig that had been backyard raised and
   slaughtered at home, a traditional practice in rural communities in many
   countries. The tasting of fresh prepared raw sausage is a common
   practice throughout Italy, and it could be a major cause for
   toxoplasmosis as suggested by the results of a questionnaire
   administered in the province of Palermo, Sicily. Contact with cats and,
   to a lesser extent, raw salad consumption were also referred to as
   presumptive causes for the symptomatic cases. Two additional cases of
   acute toxoplasmosis reported during questionnaire administration were
   alleged to have been caused by the consumption of fresh sausage made
   with the meat of a pig raised in the yard. Traditional practices in
   animal farming, and the processing of meat from animals raised in the
   backyard or meat from wild game animals, might have a big impact on food
   safety.},

Title = {Papular dermatitis due to Leishmania infantum infection in seventeen
   dogs: diagnostic features, extent of the infection and treatment outcome},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAR 24},
Abstract = {Background: This study describes immunological responses, diagnostic
   features, follow up and treatment outcomes from seventeen dogs with
   papular dermatitis due to Leishmania infection diagnosed by cytology or
   real time-PCR.
   Methods: Specific Leishmania humoral and cellular immune responses were
   evaluated by means of an immunofluorescence antibody test in all cases
   and a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction to leishmanin in
   eight cases. The extent of infection was studied in several tissues
   including blood, lymph node, conjunctival and oral swabs, by means of
   PCR, at the time of diagnosis and during follow-up. Culture was
   performed on nine dogs from cutaneous lesions and lymph node aspirates
   and molecular typing was carried out on isolates based on ITS-1, ITS-2
   and Haspb gene sequencing analysis.
   Results: Cytological and molecular results from fine needle aspirates of
   papules were diagnostic in 8 out of 13 (61.5\%) cases and in 14 out of
   15 dogs (93.3\%), respectively. In all dogs, specific anti-Leishmania
   antibody levels were low or absent. Blood and lymph node PCRs and lymph
   node culture were negative in all dogs. Three out of the nine dogs
   (33\%) were positive by culture from cutaneous lesions. The three
   isolates were identified as ITS type A, however, polymorphism was
   observed in the Haspb gene (PCR products of 626 bp, 962 bp and 371 bp).
   DTH response was positive in all tested dogs at the time of diagnosis.
   The majority of dogs were successfully treated with only
   N-methylglucamine antimoniate, after which cutaneous lesions disappeared
   or were reduced to depigmented, flattened scars. All dogs remained
   seronegative and the majority of dogs were negative by PCR in several
   tissues during follow-up.
   Conclusions: This study points out that papular dermatitis due to L.
   infantum is probably an underestimated benign cutaneous problem,
   associated with a parasite specific cell mediated immunity and a poor
   humoral immune response. Papular dermatitis is seen in young dogs, and
   appears to be a mild disease with restricted parasite dissemination and
   a good prognosis. PCR can be used as a non-invasive method to routinely
   evaluate papules if Leishmania infection is suspected in cases in which
   parasites are not visualized by cytology.},

   Screen (R) and Leishmania 96 (R)), a rapid test (Speed Leish K (R)) and
   an in-house IFAT for the detection of specific antibodies against
   Leishmania infantum antigen in dogs in different states of infection.
   Methods: Sick infected dogs (n = 36), healthy infected dogs (n = 18), L.
   infantum seropositive dogs with low to high levels of antibodies (n =
   53), dogs seropositive to other pathogens (to evaluate cross reaction)
   (n = 14) and uninfected dogs from a non-endemic area (n = 50) and from
   an endemic area (n = 32) were analysed by the serological methods
   mentioned above.
   Results: The sensitivity was as follows: ID Screen (R) (0.953), Leiscan
   (R) and Leishmania 96 (R) (0.925), IFAT (0.869) and Speed Leish K (R)
   (0.636). The maximum specificity (1.000) was attained for all diagnostic
   tests except the Leishmania 96 (R) (0.896) and IFAT (0.917). The
   accuracy was as follows: ID Screen (R) (0.975), Leiscan (R) (0.961),
   Leishmania 96 (R) (0.911), IFAT (0.892) and Speed Leish K (R) (0.808).
   In relation to the area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC), the maximum value
   was attained with the ID Screen (R) (0.993) closely followed by Leiscan
   (R) (0.990), then, Leishmania 96 (R) (0.962), IFAT (0.926) and Speed
   Leish K (R) (0.818). For the Kappa index, the best result was obtained
   by the ID Screen (R) (0.951) followed by Leiscan (R) (0.921), Leishmania
   96 (R) (0.822), IFAT (0.783) and Speed Leish K (R) (0.622).
   Statistically significant differences were found between the AUC- ROC of
   quantitative serological tests and the only qualitative rapid test
   evaluated. There were also statistically significant differences between
   AUC-ROC of the ELISAs (ID Screen (R) and Leiscan (R)) and IFAT.
   Conclusions: Leiscan (R) and ID Screen (R) had superior diagnostic
   performance measures than IFAT and all quantitative serological tests
   were superior when compared to Speed Leish K (R). Thus, Speed Leish K
   (R) may be considered a less valuable screening test prior to
   vaccination as it may result in vaccination of seropositive dogs and in
   some cases seropositive sick dogs.},

Title = {Experimental infection of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) with West
   Nile virus isolates of Euro-Mediterranean and North American origins},
Journal = {VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {45},
Month = {MAR 19},
Abstract = {West Nile virus (WNV) is a zoonotic arboviral pathogen transmitted by
   mosquitoes in a cycle involving wild birds as reservoir hosts. The virus
   has recently emerged in North America and re-emerged in Europe. North
   American WNV outbreaks are often accompanied by high mortality in wild
   birds, a feature that is uncommon in Europe. The reason for this
   difference is unknown, but the intrinsic virulence of the viruses
   circulating in each continent and/or the susceptibility to the disease
   of Palearctic as opposed to Nearctic wild bird species could play a
   role. To assess this question, experimental inoculations with four
   lineage 1 WNV strains, three from southern Europe (Italy/2008,
   Italy/2009 and Spain/2007) and one from North America (NY99) were
   performed on house sparrows (Passer domesticus), a wild passerine common
   in both continents. Non-significant differences which ranged from 0\% to
   25\% were observed in mortality for the different WNV strains. Viremias
   lasted from 1 to 5-6 days post-inoculation (dpi) in all cases;
   individuals inoculated with NY99 had significantly higher titres than
   those inoculated with any of the Euro-Mediterranean strains. Remarkably,
   host competence was found to be higher for NY99 than for the other
   strains. Consequently, albeit being pathogenic for house sparrows, some
   Euro-Mediterranean strains had reduced capacity for replication in -and
   transmission from-this host, as compared to the NY99 strain. If
   applicable also to other wild bird host species, this relatively reduced
   transmission capacity of the Euro-Mediterranean strains could explain
   the lower incidence of this disease in wild birds in the
   Euro-Mediterranean area.},

Abstract = {Anthelmintic resistance (AR) in ovine gastro-intestinal nematodes has
   been reported to affect the health and productivity of sheep globally.
   The objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of
   commonly used oral drenches in sheep in France, Greece and Italy. In
   each country, 10 farms were selected. On each farm, 50 animals were
   blocked based on the pre-treatment faecal egg count (FEC). Within each
   block, animals were randomly allocated to one of 5 treatment groups. In
   addition to an untreated control group, there were 4 groups treated per
   oral route: moxidectin (MOX) and ivermectin (IVM), both at 0.2 mg/kg
   bodyweight, levamisole (LEV; at 7.5 mg/kg bodyweight) and a
   benzimidazole (BZ; at 3.75-5 mg/kg bodyweight). In France, animals were
   not treated with LEV, but with netobimin (NET; at 7.5 mg/kg bodyweight).
   The FEC was monitored using a modified McMaster technique. Two weeks
   after treatment, individual faecal samples were taken from all animals
   and efficacy was calculated as the difference between arithmetic mean
   FEC of the control group versus each respective treatment group. The
   results of the present study indicate the high efficacy of treatment
   with oral formulations of MOX (99-100\%) and IVM (98-100\%) on all
   farms, except on 1 farm in Greece. On this farm, multi drug resistance
   (MDR) was identified involving 4 anthelmintics (efficacy MOX: 91\%; IVM:
   0\%; BZ: 58\% and LEV: 87\%). In Greece and Italy, AR against LEV and BZ
   was observed on some farms, with MDR involving both anthelmintics on 3
   farms in Greece and on 2 farms in Italy. In France, AR against BZ and
   NET was observed on all 10 farms included. In all countries,
   Teladorsagia sp. was the most common nematode larva identified after
   treatment, followed by Haemonchus sp. and Trichostrongylus sp., with
   differences among farms and treatments. The current study confirms the
   high efficacy of oral treatments with MOX and IVM, even on farms with
   worm populations resistant to BZ, LEV or NET. This study also reports
   MDR against 4 anthelmintics on one farm in Greece. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {BACKGROUNDNitrites and nitrates are compounds considered harmful to
   humans and the major part of the daily intake of nitrates in foodstuffs
   is related to vegetable consumption. In this work, 150 leafy vegetables
   samples (75 spinach and 75 lettuce) were analysed in order to assess the
   levels of nitrites and nitrates. The analyses were carried out by a
   validated ion chromatography method and the samples with nitrate
   concentrations higher than legal limits and/or with quantifiable
   concentrations of nitrites were confirmed by an alternative ion
   chromatography method.
   RESULTSNitrate levels higher than legal limits were detected both in
   spinach (four samples) and in lettuce (five samples). Nitrite residues
   were registered both at low concentrations-lower than 28.5 mg kg(-1) (12
   spinach samples)-and at high concentrations, up to 197.5 mg kg(-1)
   (three spinach and one lettuce sample).
   CONCLUSIONConsidering the non-negligible percentage of not-compliant'
   samples for nitrates (6.0\%), control is needed. Moreover, it is
   possible to suggest the introduction in the Communities Regulations of a
   maximum admissible level' for nitrites in leafy vegetables. (c) 2013

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of glucose tolerance
   test (GTT) on glucose, insulin, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and
   beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentration in dairy cows during prepartum
   and postpartum period. Forty Two clinically healthy Holstein cows were
   enrolled in two high producing dairy farms in the Northeast Italy. All
   animals were divided into two equal groups on the basis of the farm of
   origin: Group A (farm located in Vicenza) and Group B (farm located in
   Padua). Body condition score (BCS) was determined for both groups. GTT
   was performed 7 +/- 5 days before and 7 +/- 5 days after calving. Blood
   samples were collected from each animal before (T0) and after the
   administration of glucose at different times. Plasma concentration of
   glucose, insulin, NEFA and BHB was evaluated. Application of two way
   analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed no significant effect of farm and a
   significant effect of transition period (prepartum and postpartum) on
   BCS for both groups. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was
   applied to determine significant effects of infusion glucose time,
   transition period and farm on glucose, insulin, NEFA and BHB. No
   significant difference was observed between Groups A and B and a
   significant effect of transition period and glucose infusion was found
   on all parameters studied. Results confirm that glucose is an important
   direct controller of metabolic response in dairy cows during the
   transition period because of the inappropriate energetic supply that

Abstract = {Tropical marine ecosystems are among the most diverse of the world
   oceans, so that assessing the linkages between biodiversity and
   ecosystem functions (BEF) is a crucial step to predict consequences of
   biodiversity loss. Most BEF studies in marine ecosystems have been
   carried out on macrobenthic diversity, whereas the influence of the
   meiofauna on ecosystem functioning has received much less attention. We
   compared meiofaunal and nematode biodiversity and prokaryotic
   heterotrophic production across seagrass, mangrove and reef sediments in
   the Caribbean, Celebes and Red Seas. For all variables we report the
   presence of differences among habitats within the same region, and among
   regions within the same habitat. In all regions, the richness of
   meiofaunal taxa in reef and seagrass sediments is higher than in
   mangrove sediments. The sediments of the Celebes Sea show the highest
   meiofaunal biodiversity. The composition of meiofaunal assemblages
   varies significantly among habitats in the same region. The nematode
   beta diversity among habitats within the same region is higher than the
   beta diversity among regions. Although one site per habitat was
   considered in each region, these results suggest that the composition of
   meiofaunal assemblages varies primarily among biogeographic regions,
   whereas the composition of nematode assemblages varies more considerably
   among habitats. Meiofauna and nematode biodiversity and prokaryotic
   heterotrophic production, even after the removal of covariate effects
   linked with longitude and the quantity and nutritional quality of
   organic matter, are positively and linearly linked both across regions
   and within each habitat type. Our results confirm that meiofauna and
   nematode biodiversity may influence benthic prokaryotic activity, which,
   in turn, implies that diversity loss could have negative impacts on
   ecosystem functioning in these systems.},

Abstract = {The seroprevalence of Neospora caninum was surveyed by an ELISA kit on
   two water buffalo herds of Southern Italy. Seropositive samples were
   detected in 47\% and 59\% of individuals, respectively, thus indicating
   high level of exposure to the parasite even if the possibility of
   vertical transmission cannot be excluded. Tissue samples collected from
   three aborted fetuses from the same herds were investigated for N.
   caninum presence by PCR assays targeting the 18S and the Nc5 DNA
   sequences, respectively. Both methods have shown the presence of N.
   caninum DNA in heart and brain. Sequencing of the Nc5 genomic DNA
   confirmed the presence of N. caninum in the samples; phylogenetic
   analysis of the obtained sequences showed high homology among the
   Neospora recovered from different samples. The present study suggests an
   important role of N. caninum as a possible abortive agent for water
   buffaloes.},

Abstract = {Thermotolerant Campylobacter spp. are frequently the cause of human
   gastroenteritis and have assumed more importance in Italy following the
   increased consumption of raw milk. Our objectives were to determine the
   prevalence and genotypes of Campylobacter spp. in dairy herds and to
   investigate the possible sources of bulk milk contamination. Bulk milk
   from dairy herds (n = 282) was cultured for Campylobacter spp. and
   Enterobacteriaceae. At three Campylobacter jejuni-positive farms, bovine
   feces, pigeon intestines, milk, and water points were also investigated.
   Isolates were identified by PCR and genotyped using multilocus sequence
   typing (MLST). C. jejuni was detected in 34 (12\%) bulk milk samples.
   The strains belonged to 14 sequence types, and the most common clonal
   complexes were CC-21, CC-48, and CC-403. No association was demonstrated
   between the presence of C. jejuni and high levels of Enterobacteriaceae
   in bulk milk. At the three farms examined, C. jejuni was isolated from
   bovine feces (25/82 {[}30.5\%]), pigeon intestines (13/60 {[}21.7\%]),
   bulk milk (10/24 {[}41.7\%]), and water points (4/16 {[}25\%]). MLST
   revealed lineages that were common between milk and bovine feces but
   distinct between cattle and pigeons. In one herd, C. jejuni with the
   same genotype was isolated repeatedly from bulk milk and a cow with an
   udder infection. Our results showed a high prevalence of C. jejuni in
   bulk milk and suggested that udder excretion, in addition to fecal
   matter, may be a route of bulk milk contamination. MLST analysis
   indicated that pigeons are probably not relevant for the transmission of
   C. jejuni to cattle and for milk contamination.},

Abstract = {Data on the occurrence and epidemiology of Aspergillus spp. in laying
   hens farms are scant. With the aims of determining levels of airborne
   contamination in laying hen farms and evaluating the potential risk of
   infection for workers and animals, 57 air samples from 19 sheds (Group
   l), 69 from faeces (Group II), 19 from poultry feedstuffs (Group III)
   and 60 from three anatomical sites (i.e. nostrils, pharynx, ears) of 20
   farm workers (Group IV) were cultured. The Aspergillus spp. prevalence
   in samples ranged from 31.6\% (Group III) to 55.5\% (Group IV), whereas
   the highest conidia concentration was retrieved in Group II (1.2x10(4)
   c.f.u. g(-1)) and in Group III (1.9x10(3) c.f.u. g(-1)). The mean
   concentration of airborne Aspergillus spp. conidia was 70 c.f.u. M-3
   with Aspergillus fumigatus (27.3\%) being the most frequently detected
   species, followed by Aspergillus flavus (6.3\%). These Aspergillus spp.
   were also isolated from human nostrils (40\%) and ears (35\%) (P<0.05)
   (Group IV). No clinical aspergillosis was diagnosed in hens. The results
   demonstrate a relationship between the environmental contamination in
   hen farms and presence of Aspergillus spp. on animals and humans. Even
   if the concentration of airborne Aspergillus spp. conidia (i.e. 70
   c.f.u. m(-3)) herein detected does not trigger clinical disease in hens,
   it causes human colonization. Correct management of hen farms is
   necessary to control environmental contamination by Aspergillus spp.,
   and could lead to a significant reduction of animal and human
   colonization.},

Title = {Italian market fish species identification and commercial frauds

Journal = {FOOD CONTROL},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {37},
Pages = {46-50},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {To guarantee consumers about the security of what they eat is the main
   goal of all the institutions working to assure food safety. In seafood
   field it appears of prime importance to be able to identify fish species
   throughout the production cycle also when the product has been already
   processed (breaded fish, fillets etc). In this context the latest system
   proposed for species identification is the so called
   ``DNA-Barcoding{''}, made by carrying out the DNA sequencing of a
   standard barcode region. In the present study we carried out
   bi-directional sequence analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene
   (Cytb) and cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene (COI). The main goal of the
   research was to unambiguously classify the most common fishes traded in
   Italy, being able to ascertain possible labeling frauds made
   substituting value species with less precious ones. With both genes we
   could correctly identify almost all the samples in study: respectively
   58/58 with COI and 56/58 with Cytb. This study confirms mitochondrial
   genes Cytb and COI as good candidates for fish species identification by
   DNA sequencing. This method appears particularly suitable especially
   when morphological characterization is difficult, (for very close
   species), or impossible (for transformed foodstuffs) to carry out.
   What's more we could efficiently identify many fishes belonging to the
   Mediterranean fauna, which, to our knowledge, underwent for the first
   time this kind of analysis. Further development will concern the
   extension of the analysis to a largest number of local species. (C) 2013

Abstract = {In this study, 50 livestock watering sources (ground water) and 50 field
   irrigation sources (surface water) from various industrialised areas of
   the Veneto region were monitored for chemical contaminants. From each
   site, four water samples (one in each season) were collected during the
   period from summer 2009 through to spring 2010. Surface water samples
   and ground water samples were first screened for toxicity using the
   growth inhibition test on Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and the
   immobilisation test on Daphnia magna, respectively. Then, based on the
   results of these toxicity tests, 28 ground water samples and 26 surface
   water samples were submitted to chemical analysis for various
   contaminants (insecticides/acaricides, fungicides, herbicides, metals
   and anions) by means of UPLC-MSn HPLC-MSn, AAS and IEC. With the
   exception of one surface water sample where the total pesticides
   concentration was greater than 4 mu g L-1, positive samples (51.9 \%)
   showed only traces (nanograms per liter) of pesticides. Metals were
   generally under the detection limit. High concentrations of chlorines
   (up to 692 mg L-1) were found in some ground water samples while some
   surface water samples showed an excess of nitrites (up to 336 mg L-1).
   Detected levels of contamination were generally too low to justify the
   toxicity recorded in bioassays, especially in the case of surface water
   samples, and analytical results painted quite a reassuring picture,
   while tests on P. subcapitata showed a strong growth inhibition
   activity. It was concluded that, from an ecotoxicological point of view,
   surface waters used for field irrigation in the Veneto region cannot be
   considered safe.},

Abstract = {The rise of resistant pathogens and chronic infections tolerant to
   antibiotics presents an unmet need for novel antimicrobial compounds.
   Identifying broad-spectrum leads is challenging due to the effective
   penetration barrier of Gram-negative bacteria, formed by an outer
   membrane restricting amphipathic compounds, and multidrug resistance
   (MDR) pumps. In chronic infections, pathogens are shielded from the
   immune system by biofilms or host cells, and dormant persisters tolerant
   to antibiotics are responsible for recalcitrance to chemotherapy with
   conventional antibiotics. We reasoned that the dual need for
   broad-spectrum and sterilizing compounds could be met by developing
   prodrugs that are activated by bacterium-specific enzymes and that these
   generally reactive compounds could kill persisters and accumulate over
   time due to irreversible binding to targets. We report the development
   of a screen for prodrugs, based on identifying compounds that
   nonspecifically inhibit reduction of the viability dye alamarBlue, and
   then eliminate generally toxic compounds by testing for cytotoxicity. A
   large pilot of 55,000 compounds against Escherichia coli produced 20
   hits, 3 of which were further examined. One compound, ADC111, is an
   analog of a known nitrofuran prodrug nitrofurantoin, and its activity
   depends on the presence of activating enzymes nitroreductases. ADC112 is
   an analog of another known antimicrobial tilbroquinol with unknown
   mechanism of action, and ADC113 does not belong to an approved class.
   All three compounds had a good spectrum and showed good to excellent
   activity against persister cells in biofilm and stationary cultures.
   These results suggest that screening for overlooked prodrugs may present
   a viable platform for antimicrobial discovery.},

Abstract = {Six serological assays for the diagnosis of ovine brucellosis, due to
   Brucella melitensis were evaluated. Reference serum samples from sheep
   of known B. melitensis infection status (n = 118) were assessed using
   the Rose Bengal test (RBT), complement fixation test (CFT) and four
   commercial enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assays (ELISAs), including two
   indirect ELISAs (iELISAs), one competitive ELISA (cELISA) and one
   blocking ELISA (bELISA).
   The highest differential positive rates (DPR) were obtained with the
   cELISA and bELISA, while the lowest DPR was estimated using iELISAs. A
   latent class analysis was performed to estimate the accuracy of the CFT,
   RBT and bELISA using 1827 sera from sheep undergoing testing as part of
   a surveillance and control programme. Lower sensitivity and specificity
   were obtained for the three serological tests when the field samples
   were used. A higher DPR was achieved by the CFT, compared to bELISA and
   RBT. The results suggest that ELISAs, and particularly the bELISA, might
   be suitable for inclusion in the European Union legislation on
   intra-community trade for diagnosing B. melitensis infection in sheep,
   as it has a similar test performance compared to the RBT. (c) 2013

Title = {Interaction of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus Nonstructural Protein 3A
   with Host Protein DCTN3 Is Important for Viral Virulence in Cattle},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Nonstructural protein 3A of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a
   partially conserved protein of 153 amino acids in most FMDVs examined to
   date. The role of 3A in virus growth and virulence within the natural
   host is not well understood. Using a yeast two-hybrid approach, we
   identified cellular protein DCTN3 as a specific host binding partner for
   3A. DCTN3 is a subunit of the dynactin complex, a cofactor for dynein, a
   motor protein. The dynactin-dynein duplex has been implicated in several
   subcellular functions involving intracellular organelle transport. The
   3A-DCTN3 interaction identified by the yeast two-hybrid approach was
   further confirmed in mammalian cells. Overexpression of DCTN3 or
   proteins known to disrupt dynein, p150/Glued and 50/dynamitin, resulted
   in decreased FMDV replication in infected cells. We mapped the critical
   amino acid residues in the 3A protein that mediate the protein
   interaction with DCTN3 by mutational analysis and, based on that
   information, we developed a mutant harboring the same mutations in O1
   Campos FMDV (O1C3A-PLDGv). Although O1C3A-PLDGv FMDV and its parental
   virus (O1Cv) grew equally well in LFBK-alpha v beta 6, O1C3A-PLDGv virus
   exhibited a decreased ability to replicate in primary bovine cell
   cultures. Importantly, O1C3A-PLDGv virus exhibited a delayed disease in
   cattle compared to the virulent parental O1Campus (O1Cv). Virus isolated
   from lesions of animals inoculated with O1C3A-PLDGv virus contained
   amino acid substitutions in the area of 3A mediating binding to DCTN3.
   Importantly, 3A protein harboring similar amino acid substitutions
   regained interaction with DCTN3, supporting the hypothesis that DCTN3
   interaction likely contributes to virulence in cattle.
   IMPORTANCE
   The objective of this study was to understand the possible role of a FMD
   virus protein 3A, in causing disease in cattle. We have found that the
   cellular protein, DCTN3, is a specific binding partner for 3A. It was
   shown that manipulation of DCTN3 has a profound effect in virus
   replication. We developed a FMDV mutant virus that could not bind DCTN3.
   This mutant virus exhibited a delayed disease in cattle compared to the
   parental strain highlighting the role of the 3A-DCTN3 interaction in
   virulence in cattle. Interestingly, virus isolated from lesions of
   animals inoculated with mutant virus contained mutations in the area of
   3A that allowed binding to DCTN3. This highlights the importance of the
   3A-DCTN3 interaction in FMD virus virulence and provides possible
   mechanisms of virus attenuation for the development of improved FMD
   vaccines.},

Abstract = {The management of public health emergencies is improved by quick,
   exhaustive and standardized flow of data on disease outbreaks, by using
   specific tools for data collection, registration and analysis. In this
   context, the National Information System for the Notification of
   Outbreaks of Animal Diseases (SIMAN) has been developed in Italy to
   collect and share data on the notifications of outbreaks of animal
   diseases. SIMAN is connected through web services to the national
   database of animals and holdings (BDN) and has been integrated with
   tools for the management of epidemic emergencies. The website has been
   updated with a section dedicated to the contingency planning in case of
   epidemic emergency. EpiTrace is one such useful tool also integrated in
   the BDN and based on the Social Network Analysis (SNA) and on network
   epidemiological models. This tool gives the possibility of assessing the
   risk associated to holdings and animals on the basis of their trade, in
   order to support the veterinary services in tracing back and forward the
   animals in case of outbreaks of infectious diseases. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {Easy and rapid method for the quantitative determination of
   pyrrolizidine alkaloids in honey by ultra performance liquid
   chromatography-mass spectrometry: An evaluation in commercial honey},
Journal = {FOOD CONTROL},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {37},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are toxins biosynthesised by plants and
   they are known to be present in approximately 6000 plant species, about
   3\% of all flowering plants. PAs are probably the most widely
   distributed natural toxins and represent a potential risk to human
   health, since poisoning caused by these toxins is associated with acute
   and chronic liver damage and may lead to death. One of the most common
   sources of PAs exposure in humans is honey consumption. We have
   developed a quick and easy method to quantify nine different PAs
   (echimidine, heliotrine, intermedine, lycopsamine, lasiocarpine,
   retrorsine, seneciphylline, senecionine, senkirkine) in honey based on
   QuEChERS sample extraction and ultra fast liquid chromatography coupled
   with mass spectrometry detection. We performed a validation study of the
   method and it resulted in good precision and accuracy, high recoveries,
   and good linear calibrations. The limit of detection ranged from 0.021
   to 1.39 mu g Kg(-1) and the limit of quantification from 0.081 to 435 mu
   g Kg-1. This new approach was applied to the quantification of PAs in
   retail honeys purchased in local supermarkets, classified by their
   country of origin: Italian honeys, blends of honey of European countries
   and blends of honey of European and non-European countries. The
   concentrations detected ranged from 1 to 169 mu g PAs/kg(-1) with higher
   concentrations in blends of European and non-European honeys. This study
   reveals that many samples tested would exceed the tolerable daily intake
   suggested for these substances and they could be a hazard to human
   health. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In Italy, West Nile virus (WNV) equine outbreaks have occurred annually
   since 2008. Characterizing WNV vector habitat requirements allows for
   the identification of areas at risk of viral amplification and
   transmission. Maxent-based ecological niche models were developed using
   literature records of 13 potential WNV Italian vector mosquito species
   to predict their habitat suitability range and to investigate possible
   geographical associations with WNV equine outbreak occurrence in Italy
   from 2008 to 2010. The contribution of different environmental variables
   to the niche models was also assessed. Suitable habitats for Culex
   pipiens, Aedes albopictus, and Anopheles maculipennis were widely
   distributed; Culex modestus, Ochlerotatus geniculatus, Ochlerotatus
   caspius, Coquillettidia richiardii, Aedes vexans, and Anopheles plumbeus
   were concentrated in north-central Italy; Aedes cinereus, Culex
   theileri, Ochlerotatus dorsalis, and Culiseta longiareolata were
   restricted to coastal/southern areas. Elevation, temperature, and
   precipitation variables showed the highest predictive power. Host
   population and landscape variables provided minor contributions. WNV
   equine outbreaks had a significantly higher probability to occur in
   habitats suitable for Cx. modestus and Cx. pipiens, providing
   circumstantial evidence that the potential distribution of these two
   species coincides geographically with the observed distribution of the
   disease in equines.},

Abstract = {In January 2011, cases of abortion, stillbirth and weak live kids were
   reported in two goat herds in northern Italy. Samples from 18 kids found
   dead, 12 fetuses, and two stillborn kids were analyzed for pestivirus
   antigen using an ELISA kit and a border disease virus (BDV)-specific
   RT-PCR. Positive results were obtained in six kids and one fetus.
   Phylogenetic analysis based on 225 bp of the 5'UTR fragment of the BDV
   genome from positive samples showed that the goats were infected with
   BDV genotype 3. Serum and blood samples collected from all animals in
   both herds were analyzed using competitive ELISA to detect p80
   antibodies and RT-PCR to detect viraemia.
   Pestivirus antibodies were detected in 61/67 goats in herd A and in
   38/169 in herd B. A persistently infected (PI) goat was found in herd A.
   The PI animal was submitted to the laboratory for BDV diagnosis with
   Ag-ELISA, viral isolation, and nested RT-PCR on tissue samples from the
   spleen, kidney, brain, liver, lung, ileocaecal valve, mesenteric lymph
   nodes, and skin. All of the tests were positive for BDV in each of the
   tissues analyzed. The BDV sequence of the PI was identical to BDV
   sequences found in other positive animals. This is the first description
   of a BDV PI goat and the first evidence of BDV genotype 3 circulation in
   Italy. The study raises questions about the real impact this virus has
   on breeding goats. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The family Chlamydiaceae with the recombined single genus Chlamydia
   currently comprises nine species, all of which are obligate
   intracellular organisms distinguished by a unique biphasic developmental
   cycle. Anecdotal evidence from epidemiological surveys in flocks of
   poultry, pigeons and psittacine birds have indicated the presence of
   non-classified chlamydial strains, some of which may act as pathogens.
   In the present study, phylogenetic analysis of ribosomal RNA and ompA
   genes, as well as multi-locus sequence analysis of 11 field isolates
   were conducted. All independent analyses assigned the strains into two
   different clades of monophyletic origin corresponding to pigeon and
   psittacine strains or poultry isolates, respectively. Comparative genome
   analysis involving the type strains of currently accepted Chlamydiaceae
   species and the designated type strains representing the two new clades
   confirmed that the latter could be classified into two different species
   as their average nucleotide identity (ANI) values were always below
   94\%, both with the closest relative species and between themselves.
   In view of the evidence obtained from the analyses, we propose the
   addition of two new species to the current classification: Chlamydia
   avium sp. nov. comprising strains from pigeons and psittacine birds
   (type strain 10DC88(T); DSMZ: DSM27005(T), CSUR: P3508(T)) and Chlamydia
   gallinacea sp. nov. comprising strains from poultry (type strain
   08-1274/3(T); DSMZ: DSM27451(T), CSUR: P3509(T)). (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {Since 2007, a canine leishmaniasis (CanL) surveillance program has been
   carried out in public kennels of the Emilia-Romagna region with the aim
   of providing health guarantees for dog adoptions. According to this
   program, monitoring activities were performed to verify the presence of
   sandflies and infected dogs, and a specific CanL risk class was assigned
   to each kennel, resulting in different control approaches (entomological
   and/or serological monitoring, clinical surveillance, therapeutic
   treatment of infected dogs, protections against vector bites). From 2007
   to 2012, 20,931 dogs, 89.8\% of which were identified by microchip and
   housed in 73 kennels, were examined using an indirect fluorescent
   antibody test. In all, 528 (2.8\%) dogs tested positive, and 43.0\% of
   these were asymptomatic. The authors used monitoring results, in
   particular serological tests performed on dogs at admittance to the
   kennel and annual controls of sentinel dogs, to estimate CanL risk in
   the whole region and to evaluate the efficacy of the preventive measures
   adopted. CanL seroprevalence in dogs tested at the admittance in kennels
   increased significantly from 2010 (1.0\%; 29/2858) to 2012 (2.4\%;
   69/2841). In contrast, the number of seroconversions in sentinel dogs
   was stable in 2010 (1.2\%; 11/896) and 2011 (1.6\%; 13/825) and
   decreased in 2012 (0.9\%; 8/850), suggesting the efficacy of the
   preventive measures applied.},

Abstract = {Background: Prion strains exhibit distinct physical and biochemical
   repertoires, aggregation propensity, and biological properties. Results:
   A biochemical approach is developed for defining the conformational
   features of prions with or without glycosylphosphatidylinositol
   (GPI)-anchor. Conclusion: GPI anchorless prions are detected in human
   genetic prion diseases, but not in sporadic forms. Significance:
   Unveiling the structure of GPI anchorless prions to predict pathological
   properties.
   The role of the GPI-anchor in prion disease pathogenesis is still a
   challenging issue. In vitro studies have shown that anchorless cellular
   prion protein (PrPC) undergoes aberrant post-translational processing
   and metabolism. Moreover, transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing anchorless
   PrPC develop a spontaneous neurological disease accompanied with
   widespread brain PrP amyloid deposition, in the absence of spongiform
   changes. Generation of PrP forms lacking the GPI and PrP amyloidosis are
   striking features of human stop codon mutations in the PrP gene (PRNP),
   associated with PrP cerebral amyloid angiopathy (PrP-CAA) and
   Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker (GSS) syndrome. More recently, the
   presence of anchorless PrP species has been also claimed in sporadic
   Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD). Using a highly sensitive protein
   separation technique and taking advantage of reference maps of synthetic
   PrP peptides, we investigated brain tissues from scrapie-infected
   anchorless PrP Tg mice and wild type mice to determine the contribution
   of the GPI-anchor to the molecular mass and isoelectric point of PrP
   quasispecies under two-dimensional electrophoresis. We also assessed the
   conformational properties of anchorless and anchored prions under
   standard and inactivating conditions. These studies were extended to
   sCJD and GSS. At variance with GSS, characterization of PrP quasispecies
   in different sCJD subtypes ruled out the presence of anchorless prions.
   Moreover, under inactivating conditions, mice anchorless prions, but not
   sCJD prions, generated internal PrP fragments, cleaved at both N and C
   termini, similar to those found in PrP-CAA and GSS brain tissues. These
   findings show that anchorless PrPSc generates GSS-like PrP fragments,
   and suggest a major role for unanchored PrP in amyloidogenesis.},

Abstract = {During 2009-2010, 161 tissue samples (142 placentas, 16 brains, and 3
   livers) from aborted ovine fetuses on Sardinia Island, Italy, were
   tested for toxoplasmosis. Organs that showed a positive result by nested
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the ITS1 region for Toxoplasma
   gondii were also amplified with 11 genetic markers (SAG1, 5'-SAG2,
   3'-SAG2, SAG3, BTUB, GRA6, c22-8, c29-2, L358, PK1, and Apico) and then
   subjected to PCR/RFLP for genetic typing. T. gondii DNA was found in 5
   placentas, 14 brains, and 2 livers by PCR analysis and all isolates
   displayed Type II alleles at all 11 loci with all 11 markers. The
   results indicate that the Type II T. gondii is associated with ovine

Abstract = {Leishmaniasis is a neglected disease with a broad clinical spectrum
   which includes asymptomatic infection. A thorough diagnosis, able to
   distinguish and quantify Leishmania parasites in a clinical sample,
   constitutes a key step in choosing an appropriate therapy, making an
   accurate prognosis and performing epidemiological studies. Several
   molecular techniques have been shown to be effective in the diagnosis of
   leishmaniasis. In particular, a number of PCR methods have been
   developed on various target DNA sequences including kinetoplast
   minicircle constant regions. The first aim of this study was to develop
   a SYBR green-based qPCR assay for Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum
   detection and quantification, using kinetoplast minicircle constant
   region as target. To this end, two assays were compared: the first used
   previously published primer pairs (qPCR1), whereas the second used a
   nested primer pairs generating a shorter PCR product (qPCR2). The second
   aim of this study was to evaluate the possibility to discriminate among
   subgenera Leishmania (Leishmania) and Leishmania (Viannia) using the
   qPCR2 assay followed by melting or High Resolution Melt (HRM) analysis.
   Both assays used in this study showed good sensitivity and specificity,
   and a good correlation with standard IFAT methods in 62 canine clinical
   samples. However, the qPCR2 assay allowed to discriminate between
   Leishmania (Leishmania) and Leishmania (Viannia) subgenera through
   melting or HRM analysis. In addition to developing assays, we
   investigated the number and genetic variability of kinetoplast
   minicircles in the Leishmania (L.) infantum WHO international reference
   strain (MHOM/TN/80/IPT1), highlighting the presence of minicircle
   subclasses and sequence heterogeneity. Specifically, the kinetoplast
   minicircle number per cell was estimated to be 26,566 +/- 1,192, while
   the subclass of minicircles amplifiable by qPCR2 was estimated to be
   1,263 +/- 115. This heterogeneity, also observed in canine clinical
   samples, must be taken into account in quantitative PCR-based
   applications; however, it might also be used to differentiate between
   Leishmania subgenera.},

Abstract = {Background: Since 2010 Veneto region (North-Eastern Italy) planned a
   special integrated surveillance of summer fevers to promptly identify
   cases of West Nile Fever (WNF), dengue (DENV) and chikungunya (CHIKV).
   The objectives of this study were (i) To increase the detection rate of
   imported CHIKV and DENV cases in travellers from endemic areas and
   promptly identify potential autochthonous cases.(ii) To detect
   autochthonous cases of WNF, besides those of West Nile Neuroinvasive
   Disease (WNND) that were already included in a national surveillance.
   Methods: Human surveillance: a traveler who had returned within the
   previous 15 days from endemic countries, with fever >38 degrees C,
   absence of leucocytosis (leukocyte count <10,000 mu L), and absence of
   other obvious causes of fever, after ruling out malaria, was considered
   a possible case of CHIKV or DENV. A possible autochthonous case of WNF
   was defined as a patient with fever >38 degrees C for <7 days, no recent
   travel history and absence of other obvious causes of fever. Entomologic
   surveillance: for West Nile (WNV) it was carried out from May through
   November placing CDC-CO2 traps in five provinces of Veneto Region, while
   for DENV and CHIKV it was also performed around residences of viremic
   cases.
   Results: Human surveillance: between 2010 and 2012, 234 patients with
   fever after travelling were screened, of which 27 (11,5\%) were found
   infected (24 with DENV and 3 with CHIKV). No autochthonous case of DENV
   or CHIKV was detected. Autochthonous patients screened for WNF were 408,
   and 24 (5,9\%) were confirmed cases. Entomologic surveillance: the WNV
   was found in 10, 2 and 11 pools of Culex pipiens from 2010 to 2012
   respectively, in sites of Rovigo, Verona, Venezia and Treviso
   provinces). No infected Aedes albopictus with DENV or CHIKV was found.
   Conclusions: Veneto is the only Italian region reporting WNV human cases
   every year since 2008. WNV is likely to cause sporadic cases and
   unforeseeable outbreaks for decades. Including WNF in surveillance
   provides additional information and possibly an early alert system.
   Timely detection of DENV and CHIKV should prompt vector control measures
   to prevent local outbreaks.},

Title = {Association between serological response and shedding of Coxiella
   burnetii in milk in dairy cattle},
Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {20},

Abstract = {Introduction - In dairy cows, the shedding of C. burnetii occurs mainly
   through milk and can last up to 32 months postpartum. PCR testing of
   individual milk samples is the most efficient way to detect the
   shedders, but also very expensive. An affordable approach could be a
   preliminary serological investigation of the herd, to further select
   which cows should be further tested by PCR.
   Aim - The aim of this study was to evaluate the relation between the
   serological status of the cows in infected herds and the occurrence of
   C. burnetii shedding in milk.
   Materials and methods -The study involved 4 dairy farms in Veneto region
   (North-east of Italy) with previous history of Q fever abortions. Serum
   and milk samples were collected from all the lactating cows of each
   farm. Sera were tested using a manual complement fixation test (CFT)
   with a cutoff titre of 1: 10, and a commercial indirect ELISA kit (LSI).
   Milk samples were subjected to a commercial real-time PCR kit
   (ADIAVET(R) COX REALTIME) for bacterial DNA detection. The relation
   between serological response to C. burnetii infection and bacteria milk
   shedding was evaluated by means of the odds ratio (OR).
   Results and discussion -A mong 577 sera collected 138 (23,92\%) tested
   positive to the ELISA, while 55 (9,53\%) were positive to CFT. ELISA
   seropositive cows ranged in the herds from 8,43 to 39,67\%. The cows
   with PCR positive milk were 36 (6,24\%), ranging from 3,76 to 13,08\% of
   lactating cows in 3 herds, while in the farm with the lowest number of
   ELISA seropositive animals (8,43\%), no milk shedders were found. Out of
   the 36 cows with PCR positive milk, 11 had no antibodies detectable by
   ELISA and CFT, 10 were ELISA positive but CFT negative, and 15 were
   positive to both the serological tests. The probability of seropositive
   cows to shed C. burnetii in milk was 9 time higher than in seronegative
   cows using either ELISA test or CFT to detect the antibodies (OR 8,94
   for CFT and 8,61 for ELISA). If the ELISA cut-off is increased to a S/p
   value > 2, the probability of seropositive cows to have PCR positive
   milk is 12 time higher than seronegative ones.
   Conclusion - This survey showed that, in infected herds, the number of
   cows shedding C. burnetii in milk is relatively low compared to the
   number of seropositive animals. ELISA test, especially using a higher
   cut-off value, could be an useful tool to identify the cows to be
   further tested by means of PCR. As previously described, it should be
   noticed that shedding of C. burnetii in milk occurred also in
   seronegative cows.},

Abstract = {Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar 4,{[}5],12:i:- DT193 is
   recognized as an emerging monophasic variant of Salmonella Typhimurium
   in many European countries. Resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin,
   sulphonamides, and tetracycline (R-type ASSuT) is described as one of
   the most common profiles of resistance within this clone. Recently,
   strains presenting such features were isolated from two unrelated
   outbreaks in Italy. Strains were characterized by pulsed-field gel
   electrophoresis (PFGE), performed with XbaI, BlnI, and SpeI, and
   multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). XbaI-PFGE
   showed strains related to the two outbreaks as indistinguishable.
   Conversely, both BlnI-PFGE and MLVA characterized the strains related
   the two outbreaks as different. XbaI-PFGE identified two profiles,
   differing by one band, within strains isolated from one of the two
   outbreaks. Also BlnI-PFGE and MLVA generated different profiles among
   the strains related to that outbreak. Combining the PFGE profiles
   obtained by XbaI and BlnI and comparing them with the MLVA profiles, the
   two methods grouped the same isolates based on identity. Moreover,
   genomic deletions of the genes included in the operon fljAB, the
   flanking iroB gene, and the closely located STM2757 gene were
   investigated. For all strains, the same profile of deletion
   characterized by the absence of fljA, fljB, and hin genes and the
   presence of STM2757 and iroB genes was identified. This profile of
   deletion represents a mixture between two profiles of Salmonella
   4,{[}5],12:i:- described as the Spanish and the U.S. clones. This study
   demonstrated that although strains of Salmonella 4,{[}5],12:i:- DT193
   ASSuT are highly clonal, minor differences between strains may be seen
   during the same outbreak by using in parallel PFGE with different
   restriction enzymes, MLVA, and the analysis of molecular markers related
   to the operon fljAB. The combination of these different molecular
   approaches was essential to clarify the epidemiological relationship
   among the strains.},

Abstract = {The efficacies of two commercial Porcine Circovirus 2 (PCV2) vaccines
   were compared in conventional pigs based on humoral response, viral
   load, clinical observation, and growth performance from weaning to 220
   days of age. A double-blind, randomised, and controlled field trial was
   performed on an Italian 420-sow farrow-to-finish farm. One thousand and
   fifty piglets, from five consecutive batches, were included in this
   trial. The piglets were stratified by sex, weight, parity of the sow and
   randomly allocated to 3 groups. At inclusion (weaning at 25+/-2 days of
   age), 349 animals (group A) received a 0.5 ml intramuscular dose of
   Circovac(R), 351 animals (group B) received a 1 ml intramuscular dose of
   CircoFLEX(R). Another group (group C) of 350 pigs was kept as
   unvaccinated control. Weights were recorded at inclusion, at 105 and 220
   days of age, and the average daily weight gain (ADWG) was calculated.
   For serologic and virologic studies, blood samples were collected
   monthly, from weaning to 180 days of life, from a randomly selected
   sample of animals coming from batch no. 3. Compared to the control
   group, vaccinated animals showed a significant increase of ADWG from
   25-105, 105-220 and 25-220 days of age. Both animals vaccinated with
   Circovac(R) and those vaccinated with Circoflex(R) showed ADWG
   significantly higher than those of the control group during the three
   considered periods. The difference between ADWG of group A and group B
   was not statistically significant for any of the three time periods. The
   percentage of 25-to-220-day dead pigs and runts were very similar;
   however, incidence of underweight pigs was statistically lower in the
   vaccinated groups. The vaccination seemed to reduce the viral pressure
   in the facilities. This observation is supported by the qPCR data, which
   showed, that vaccinated animals had a lower serum viral load. No
   statistically significant difference in the considered parameters was
   observed between the two vaccines.},

Title = {Enterotoxin gene profiles of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from milk

Abstract = {Staphylococcal foodborne intoxication, occurring after consumption of
   staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) in food, is considered one of the most
   common forms of bacterial foodborne outbreaks worldwide. Milk and dairy
   products account for 5\% of all the incriminated foods in staphylococcal
   outbreaks, referring to Europe. The distribution of genes encoding for
   enterotoxins in Staphylococcus aureus strains is highly variable, with
   some carried on stable regions of the chromosome and others carried on
   mobile genetic elements. The aim of this study was to analyse the
   distribution of genes encoding for SEs in Staph.aureus strains isolated
   from milk and dairy products. In the period from January 2010 to June
   2011, a total of 1245 dairy samples (848 of raw milk and 397 of dairy
   products) were collected and analysed for detection of genes encoding
   for 11 SEs and SEls (SEA, SEB, SEC, SED, SEE, SEG, SEH, SEI, SER SElJ
   and SElP) according to the procedures of the Italian National Reference
   Laboratory for coagulase-positive Staphylococci including Staph.aureus.
   Staphylococcus aureus strains were isolated in 481 (39\%) samples. Of
   the 481 isolates of Staph.aureus tested, 255 (53\%) were positive for
   one or more SE genes, and thirty-five different enterotoxin gene
   profiles were distinguished among the isolates. ser gene, found in 134
   (28\%) of the isolates, was the most frequent, followed by sed (25\%)
   and selj genes (25\%). The identification of new SEs increased the
   isolation frequency of enterotoxigenic staphylococci, thus suggesting
   that the pathogenic potential of Staph.aureus may be of greater
   importance than previously thought. Further studies are needed to
   quantify the expression of these new enterotoxins, and to assess their
   contribution to foodborne disease burden.},

Abstract = {Because Schmallenberg virus (SBV) was first reported in domestic
   ruminants in Northern Italy in February 2012, we conducted a serosurvey
   to assess the presence of SBV-specific antibodies in free-ranging alpine
   ruminants. The tested serum samples were from chamois (23) and red deer
   (352) hunted from 2007 to 2013. All of the serum samples collected
   through September, 2012, tested negative, whereas a single chamois serum
   and 21 red deer sera taken during the 2012-2013 hunting season tested
   positive for the presence of SBV antibodies. Because this serosurvey is
   suggestive of an active SBV circulation in Alpine wildlife, targeted
   surveillance should be performed on wild ruminants to monitor the spread
   of the virus and to assess the epidemiological role of wildlife at the
   interface with domestic animals.},

Abstract = {Campylobacter has developed resistance to several antimicrobial agents
   over the years, including macrolides, quinolones and fluoroquinolones,
   becoming a significant public health hazard. A total of 145 strains
   derived from raw milk, chicken faeces, chicken carcasses, cattle faeces
   and human faeces collected from various Italian regions, were screened
   for antimicrobial susceptibility, molecular characterization (SmaI
   pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) and detection of virulence genes
   (sequencing and DNA microarray analysis). The prevalence of C. jejuni
   and C. coli was 62.75\% and 37.24\% respectively. Antimicrobial
   susceptibility revealed a high level of resistance for ciprofloxacin
   (62.76\%), tetracycline (55.86\%) and nalidixic acid (55.17\%).
   Genotyping of Campylobacter isolates using PFGE revealed a total of 86
   unique SmaI patterns. Virulence gene profiles were determined using a
   new microbial diagnostic microarray composed of 70-mer oligonucleotide
   probes targeting genes implicated in Campylobacter pathogenicity.
   Correspondence between PFGE and microarray clusters was observed.
   Comparisons of PFGE and virulence profiles reflected the high genetic
   diversity of the strains examined, leading us to speculate different
   degrees of pathogenicity inside Campylobacter populations.},

Abstract = {Sixteen haemagglutinin (HA) subtypes of avian influenza viruses (AIV)
   have been described to date. Rapid subtype identification of any AIV is
   of major interest because of the possible serious consequences for the
   poultry industry and even public health. Molecular techniques currently
   allow immediate accurate subtype characterisation prior to virus
   isolation. In this study, a set of fourteen specific real-time RT-PCR
   methods were developed and evaluated for AIV HA subtyping (H1-H4, H6-H8,
   H10-H16), H5 and H9 being excluded on the basis of the current validity
   of the European Union (EU) recommended specific assays. Specific primers
   and probes sets for each HA-subtype were designed to hybridise the
   largest isolates range within each single subtype, considering the
   Eurasian lineage as a major target. The robustness and general
   application of the 14 HA-subtype methods were verified by the analysis
   of 110 AIV isolates belonging to all 16 HA-subtypes, performed in
   different laboratories. The developed real-time RT-PCR assays proved to
   be highly specific and revealed suitable sensitivity, allowing direct
   HA-subtyping of clinical material. In summary, this study provides for
   the first time a panel of molecular tests using specific hydrolysis
   probes for rapid and complete AIV HA-subtype identification. (C) 2013

Abstract = {Newcastle disease (ND) is a highly contagious disease that affects many
   species of birds and causes significant economic losses to the poultry
   industry worldwide. Fifteen Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolates
   obtained from rural chickens in northwest Ethiopia in 2011 and 2012 were
   characterized genotypically. The main functional region of the F gene
   was amplified and sequenced (260 nucleotides). Among the Ethiopian NDV
   isolates, 2 isolates had the virulent motif R-112-R-Q-K-R-F-117 at the
   cleavage site of the fusion protein while 13 isolates contained the
   lentogenic motif (112)G-G/R-Q-G-R-L-117. Phylogenetic analysis based on
   the variable region of the F gene indicated that the two isolates
   exhibiting the virulent motif belonged to lineage 5 (genotype VII)
   subgenotype d and the remaining 13 isolates were grouped into lineage 2
   (genotype II). The nucleotide sequences of lineage 5 isolates were
   genetically related to the Sudanese NDV isolates, suggesting potential
   epidemiological link of ND outbreaks between neighbouring countries. The
   lentogenic strains shared similarities with La Sota vaccine strain and
   probably originated from the vaccine strain either through direct
   exposure of birds to the live vaccine or to infectious La Sota-like
   strains circulating in rural poultry. This study provides genetic
   evidence on the existence of different NDV genotypes circulating in the
   rural poultry in Ethiopia. The virulent NDV continues to be a problem in
   poultry sector in Ethiopia, and their continuous circulation in rural
   and commercial poultry calls for improved surveillance and intensified
   vaccination and other control measures.},

Abstract = {Since 1994, when Brucella ceti was first isolated from an aborted
   dolphin fetus, several cases have been reported worldwide. The first
   case of B. ceti in the Mediterranean (and in Italy), however, was
   recorded only in 2012, off the coast of Tuscany. Extensive studies,
   using serological and microbiological methods, have documented this
   bacterium in dolphins and demonstrated its zoonotic potential. We
   describe the typing of two B. ceti strains isolated from striped
   dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) stranded on the southern Apulia
   coastline. B. ceti isolates were conventionally typed, and then
   genotyped by both the multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and the
   multilocus variable number of tandem repeats typing (MLVA) methodologies
   to infer phylogeny and potential epidemiological links between the two
   cases. The two isolates were identified through MLST analysis as
   belonging to the common sequence type 26 (ST26), while MLVA analysis,
   having established that the two isolates have identical profiles,
   assigned them to a novel genotype within cluster A - a unique
   representative of a new Mediterranean subcluster. The results thus
   revealed a link between the two cases studied, demonstrating the
   usefulness of MLST and MLVA for the epidemiological investigation of
   brucellae among marine mammals.},

Abstract = {Crossbreeding between wolves (Canis lupus Linnaeus, 1758) and domestic
   dogs is raising as an emerging, potential threat to the conservation of
   wolf populations. Concern has been expressed that introgression with
   domestic genes may pollute the wolf's gene pool, and strategies have
   been proposed to actively manage the hybrids, for example by removing
   them from the wolf population. In this study, autosomal microsatellite
   markers were used in combination with Bayesian assignment tests to
   investigate the occurrence and dynamics of wolf-dog crossbreeding in
   Italy. We evaluated (1) the differentiation between wolves and dogs. (2)
   the extent of crossbreeding, based on the statistical threshold set in
   the Bayesian analyses, and (3) the existence of a descriptive
   relationship between morphological traits of putative wolves and their
   genotypes, useful to recognise hybrids in the wild. The results showed
   that dogs and Italian wolves are genetically well-differentiated,
   suggesting that introgression of domestic genes has not affected the
   wolf's gene pool. The Bayesian tests revealed 6.5\% of admixed
   genotypes, but we showed that the proportion of hybrids, and
   consequently the perception of how severe the hybridisation, depends on
   the detection power of a marker set and the threshold selected for
   assigning genotypes. Evidence for genetic admixture was found in
   individuals with atypical, dog-like phenotypical traits, as well as in
   wild type wolves, indicating that hybrids may be unidentifiable by
   observation criteria, and their removal from a wild population is a
   probably impossible goal. We suggest that management and conservation
   efforts should be focused on sympatric populations of free-ranging dogs,
   which are the primary source of hybridisation for the wolf. (C) 2013

Title = {Influence of ewe milk somatic cell count on the sensory characteristics
   of Pecorino cheese},
Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {35-39},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Introduction - Ewe milk somatic cell count can influence some
   cheesemaking parameters as well as the final characteristics of the
   cheese. In particular, a high SCC determines a reduced response to the
   action of the rennet with an increased curd formation rate and a
   decreased clot firmness thus causing, overall, a higher moisture content
   in the cheese. Casein hydrolysis determines cheese texture changes and
   lipases increase the degree of lipolysis, especially during storage,
   resulting in decreased fat content, and increased volatile fatty acids
   content as well as in possible repercussions on the organoleptic
   characteristics of the product.
   Aim - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a different
   number of somatic cells (Somatic Cell Count SCC) on some sensory
   characteristics of Pecorino cheese ripened for 60 days.
   Materials and methods - For this purpose cheeses were made starting from
   milk with low SCC (<500.000 cells/ml), medium SCC (1.000.000-1.500.000
   cells/ml) and high SCC (>2.000.000 cells/ml). The cheeses were subjected
   to chemical-physical (pH), composition (moisture, protein, fat and ash)
   and sensory analyses (electronic nose, duo-trio and ranking test and
   sensory profile).
   Results and discussion - The average pH value of cheeses obtained from
   milk with a high SCC is significantly higher (5.37) than that obtained
   from milk with average (5.23) (P<0.05) or low SCC (5.15) (P<0.01). The
   chemical composition showed a higher moisture content in cheese obtained
   from milk with high SCC (42.91\%) compared to that obtained from milk
   with low SCC (42.03\%) (P<0.01). No difference was found for the values
   relating to electronic nose signals, while the other sensory analyses
   showed that the cheeses made with high SCC milk differ from the other
   two types, in particular for hardness and graininess.
   Conclusions - The findings in this work confirmed that the sensory
   characteristics of cheese may be affected by the somatic cells count of
   the milk used. However, the 60 day ageing period used in our experiment
   did not determine changes in the flavour which, according to some
   authors, would only change significantly with a longer ripening time.
   Nonetheless this period was sufficient to determine texture alterations
   that negatively affected the taste of cheeses made from milk with high
   SCC.},

Abstract = {Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), a highly infectious and fatal
   disease of cattle present in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, is
   usually controlled by mass vaccinations. However, vaccination against
   CBPP is known to cause site reactions in a percentage of cattle
   especially in primary vaccinations. In Zambia, a record of site
   reactions was kept for seven consecutive years from 2005 to 2011 to
   establish the level of the problem. In some areas, after 3 years of
   consecutive vaccination campaigns, immunization could not be implemented
   for a period of 2 years because of logistical difficulties or owner
   resistance. Whereas in the three preceding years when animals were
   vaccinated annually, site reactions were in the range of 6.2 \%; on
   resumption of vaccination in the herds that had not been immunized for 2
   years, site reactions averaged 21.3 \%. This data shows that the T1/44
   vaccine may cause severe local reactions in cattle if there is any break
   in annual vaccinations. It is therefore important for authorities to
   ensure that the cattle at risk of contracting CBPP are regularly
   vaccinated to avoid discouraging farmers from presenting their animals.},

Abstract = {The recent outbreak caused by Schmallenberg virus, which affected sheep,
   goats and cattle in Europe, highlighted the importance of having a
   robust surveillance plan capable of monitoring abortions and
   malformations in the livestock offspring. In this context, bluetongue
   viruses (BTVs) represented and represent one of the major threats to the
   European livestock industry. Aiming to improve the understanding on BTV
   cross placental transmission and serotype involvement, in this
   retrospective study foetal spleens and/or brains of 663 ovines, 429
   bovines, 155 goats and 17 buffaloes were tested for the presence of BTV
   by virus isolation. BTV vaccine strains were isolated from 31 foetuses
   (2.4\%; 95\% CI: 1.7-3.4\%): 24 (3.6\%; 95\% CI: 2.4-5.3\%) from ovine
   foetal tissues; 6 (1.4\%; 95\% CI: 0.6-3.0\%) from bovine foetal tissues
   and 1 (0.6\%; 95\% CI: 0.2-3.5\%) from the spleen of a caprine foetus.
   All foetuses were from animals vaccinated with either BTV-2 or BTV-2,
   and BTV-9 modified live vaccines (MLVs) produced by Onderstepoort
   Biological Products (OBP), South Africa. Among the 31 isolated vaccine
   strains, serotype 9 (n=28) was more frequently isolated (P<0.05) than
   serotype 2 (n=3). In two cases infectious vaccine strains were found in
   the foetal tissues 2months after the vaccine administration. Other
   pathogens known to be causative agents of abortion in ruminants were not
   detected nor isolated. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that
   BTV-2 and BTV-9 vaccine strains are able to cross the placental barrier
   of sheep, cattle and goats. BTV-2 and BTV-9 vaccine strains are able to
   infect foetuses and cause abortions or malformations depending on the
   period of pregnancy at the time of vaccination.},

Title = {Evaluation of innate immune responses in bovine forestomachs},
Journal = {RESEARCH IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {96},
Number = {1},
Pages = {69-78},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Previous studies had indicated an active role of bovine forestomachs in
   the response to alimentary disorders as well as to inflammatory and
   infectious processes in both the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract and
   elsewhere. We investigated the potential of bovine forestomachs to
   receive, elaborate and produce signals and mediators of the innate
   immune response. Indeed, we detected the expression of Toll
   IL-1R8/single Ig IL-1-related receptor (TIR8/SIGIRR) and other receptors
   and cytokines, such as Toll-like receptor (TLR)4, interleukin (IL)-1
   beta, IL-10 and Caspase-1 in the forestomach walls of healthy cows.
   Their presence suggests an active role of forestomachs in inflammatory
   disorders of the GI tract and other body compartments. Moreover,
   interferon (IFN)-gamma was revealed in ruminal content. We confirmed and
   further characterized the presence of leukocytes in the rumen fluids. In
   particular, T-, B-lymphocytes and myeloid lineage cells were detected in
   the ruminal content of both rumen-fistulated heifers and diseased cows.
   An acidogenic diet based on daily supplements of maize was shown to
   inhibit leukocyte accumulation, as opposed to a control, hay-based diet,
   with or without a soy flour (protein) supplement. On the whole, results
   indicate that bovine forestomachs can receive and elaborate signals for
   the immune cells infiltrating the rumen content or other organs.
   Forestomachs can thus participate in a cross-talk with the lymphoid
   tissues in the oral cavity and promote regulatory actions at both
   regional and systemic levels; these might include the control of dry
   matter intake as a function of fundamental metabolic requirements of
   ruminants. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The systemic and respiratory local immune response induced by the
   intradermal administration of a commercial inactivated Mycoplasma
   hyopneumoniae whole-cell vaccine (Porcilis (R) MHYO ID ONCE - MSD AH) in
   comparison with two commercial vaccines administered via the
   intramuscular route and a negative control (adjuvant only) was
   investigated. Forty conventional M. hyopneumoniae-free pigs were
   randomly assigned to four groups (ten animals each): Group A =
   intradermal administration of the test vaccine by using the needle-less
   IDAL (R) vaccinator at a dose of 0.2 ml; Group B = intramuscular
   administration of a commercially available vaccine (vaccine B); Group C
   = intramuscular administration of the adjuvant only (2 ml of X-solve
   adjuvant); Group D = intramuscular administration of a commercially
   available vaccine (vaccine D). Pigs were vaccinated at 28 days of age.
   Blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples were collected at
   vaccination (blood only), 4 and 8 weeks post-vaccination. Serum and BAL
   fluid were tested for the presence of antibodies by ELISA test.
   Peripheral blood monomorphonuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated to
   quantify the number of IFN-gamma secreting cells by ELISpot. Moreover,
   cytokine gene expression from the BAL fluid was performed. Total
   antibodies against M. hyopneumoniae and specific IgG were detected in
   serum of intradermally and intramuscularly (vaccine B only) vaccinated
   pigs at 4 and 8 weeks post-vaccination. M. hyopneumoniae specific IgA
   were detected in BAL fluid from vaccinated animals (Groups A and B) but
   not from controls and animals vaccinated with the bacterin D (p < 0.05).
   Significantly higher gene expression of IL-10 was observed in the BAL
   fluid at week 8 post-vaccination in the intradermally vaccinated pigs (p
   < 0.05). The results support that the intradermal administration of an
   adjuvanted bacterin induces both systemic and mucosal immune responses.
   Moreover, the intramuscularly administered commercial vaccines each had
   a different ability to stimulate the immune response both systemically
   and locally. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Environmental Correlates of H5N2 Low Pathogenicity Avian Influenza
   Outbreak Heterogeneity in Domestic Poultry in Italy},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 22},
Abstract = {Italy has experienced recurrent incursions of H5N2 avian influenza (AI)
   viruses in different geographical areas and varying sectors of the
   domestic poultry industry. Considering outbreak heterogeneity rather
   than treating all outbreaks of low pathogenicity AI (LPAI) viruses
   equally is important given their interactions with the environment and
   potential to spread, evolve and increase pathogenicity. This study aims
   at identifying potential environmental drivers of H5N2 LPAI outbreak
   occurrence in time, space and poultry populations. Thirty-four
   environmental variables were tested for association with the
   characteristics of 27 H5N2 LPAI outbreaks (i.e. time, place, flock type,
   number and species of birds affected) occurred among domestic poultry
   flocks in Italy in 2010-2012. This was done by applying a recently
   proposed analytical approach based on a combined non-metric
   multidimensional scaling, clustering and regression analysis. Results
   indicated that the pattern of (dis) similarities among the outbreaks
   entailed an underlying structure that may be the outcome of large-scale,
   environmental interactions in ecological dimension. Increased densities
   of poultry breeders, and increased land coverage by industrial,
   commercial and transport units were associated with increased
   heterogeneity in outbreak characteristics. In areas with high breeder
   densities and with many infrastructures, outbreaks affected mainly
   industrial turkey/layer flocks. Outbreaks affecting ornamental,
   commercial and rural multi-species flocks occurred mainly in lowly
   infrastructured areas of northern Italy. Outbreaks affecting rural layer
   flocks occurred mainly in areas with low breeder densities in
   south-central Italy. In savannah-like environments, outbreaks affected
   mainly commercial flocks of galliformes. Suggestive evidence that
   ecological ordination makes sense genetically was also provided, as
   virus strains showing high genetic similarity clustered into
   ecologically similar outbreaks. Findings were informed by hypotheses
   about how ecological interactions among poultry populations, viruses and
   their environments can be related to the observed patterns of H5N2 LPAI
   occurrence. This may prove useful in enhancing future interventions by
   developing site-specific, ecologically-grounded strategies.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 20},
Abstract = {Canine distemper virus (CDV) infection is a primary threat affecting a
   wide number of carnivore species, including wild animals. In January
   2013, two carcasses of Apennine wolves (Canis lupus) were collected in
   Ortona dei Marsi (L'Aquila province, Italy) by the local Veterinary
   Services. CDV was immediately identified either by RT-PCR or
   immunohistochemistry in lung and central nervous tissue samples. At the
   same time, severe clinical signs consistent with CDV infection were
   identified and taped (Videos S1-S3) from three wolves rescued in the
   areas surrounding the National Parks of the Abruzzi region by the
   Veterinary Services. The samples collected from these symptomatic
   animals also turned out CDV positive by RT-PCR. So far, 30 carcasses of
   wolves were screened and CDV was detected in 20 of them. The sequencing
   of the haemagglutinin gene and subsequent phylogenetic analysis
   demonstrated that the identified virus belonged to the CDV Arctic
   lineage. Strains belonging to this lineage are known to circulate in
   Italy and in Eastern Europe amongst domestic dogs. To the best of our
   knowledge this is the first report of CDV Arctic lineage epidemics in
   the wild population in Europe.},

Title = {Determinants of the population growth of the West Nile virus mosquito
   vector Culex pipiens in a repeatedly affected area in Italy},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Background: The recent spread of West Nile Virus in temperate countries
   has raised concern. Predicting the likelihood of transmission is crucial
   to ascertain the threat to Public and Veterinary Health. However,
   accurate models of West Nile Virus (WNV) expansion in Europe may be
   hampered by limited understanding of the population dynamics of their
   primary mosquito vectors and their response to environmental changes.
   Methods: We used data collected in north-eastern Italy (2009-2011) to
   analyze the determinants of the population growth rate of the primary
   WNV vector Culex pipiens. A series of alternative growth models were
   fitted to longitudinal data on mosquito abundance to evaluate the
   strength of evidence for regulation by intrinsic density-dependent
   and/or extrinsic environmental factors. Model-averaging algorithms were
   then used to estimate the relative importance of intrinsic and extrinsic
   variables in describing the variations of per-capita growth rates.
   Results: Results indicate a much greater contribution of
   density-dependence in regulating vector population growth rates than of
   any environmental factor on its own. Analysis of an average model of Cx.
   pipiens growth revealed that the most significant predictors of their
   population dynamics was the length of daylight, estimated population
   size and temperature conditions in the 15 day period prior to sampling.
   Other extrinsic variables (including measures of precipitation, number
   of rainy days, and humidity) had only a minor influence on Cx. pipiens
   growth rates.
   Conclusions: These results indicate the need to incorporate density
   dependence in combination with key environmental factors for robust
   prediction of Cx. pipiens population expansion and WNV transmission
   risk. We hypothesize that detailed analysis of the determinants of
   mosquito vector growth rate as conducted here can help identify when and
   where an increase in vector population size and associated WNV
   transmission risk should be expected.},

Title = {Genome sequencing and comparative analysis of three Chlamydia pecorum
   strains associated with different pathogenic outcomes},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JAN 14},
Abstract = {Background: Chlamydia pecorum is the causative agent of a number of
   acute diseases, but most often causes persistent, subclinical infection
   in ruminants, swine and birds. In this study, the genome sequences of
   three C. pecorum strains isolated from the faeces of a sheep with
   inapparent enteric infection (strain W73), from the synovial fluid of a
   sheep with polyarthritis (strain P787) and from a cervical swab taken
   from a cow with metritis (strain PV3056/3) were determined using
   Illumina/Solexa and Roche 454 genome sequencing.
   Results: Gene order and synteny was almost identical between C. pecorum
   strains and C. psittaci. Differences between C. pecorum and other
   chlamydiae occurred at a number of loci, including the plasticity zone,
   which contained a MAC/perforin domain protein, two copies of a > 3400
   amino acid putative cytotoxin gene and four (PV3056/3) or five (P787 and
   W73) genes encoding phospholipase D. Chlamydia pecorum contains an
   almost intact tryptophan biosynthesis operon encoding trpABCDFR and has
   the ability to sequester kynurenine from its host, however it lacks the
   genes folA, folKP and folB required for folate metabolism found in other
   chlamydiae. A total of 15 polymorphic membrane proteins were identified,
   belonging to six pmp families. Strains possess an intact type III
   secretion system composed of 18 structural genes and accessory proteins,
   however a number of putative inc effector proteins widely distributed in
   chlamydiae are absent from C. pecorum. Two genes encoding the
   hypothetical protein ORF663 and IncA contain variable numbers of repeat
   sequences that could be associated with persistence of infection.
   Conclusions: Genome sequencing of three C. pecorum strains, originating
   from animals with different disease manifestations, has identified
   differences in ORF663 and pseudogene content between strains and has
   identified genes and metabolic traits that may influence intracellular
   survival, pathogenicity and evasion of the host immune system.},

Abstract = {Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), caused by Mycoplasma mycoides
   subsp. mycoides (Mmm) is a severe cattle disease, present in many
   countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The development of improved diagnostic
   tests and vaccines for CBPP control remains a research priority.
   Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry were used to
   characterize the Triton X-114 soluble proteome of nine Mmm strains
   isolated from Europe or Africa. Of a total of 250 proteins detected, 67
   were present in all strains investigated. Of these, 44 were predicted to
   be lipoproteins or cytoplasmic membrane-associated proteins and are thus
   likely to be members of the core in vitro surface membrane-associated
   proteome of Mmm. Moreover, the presence of all identified proteins in
   other ruminant Mycoplasma pathogens were investigated. Two proteins of
   the core proteome were identified only in other cattle pathogens of the
   genus Mycoplasma pointing towards a role in host-pathogen interactions.
   The data generated will facilitate the identification and prioritization
   of candidate Mycoplasma antigens for improved control measures, as it is
   likely that surface-exposed membrane proteins will include those that
   are involved in host-pathogen interactions. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Title = {Haematological Changes Following Reining Trials in Quarter Horses},
Journal = {ACTA SCIENTIAE VETERINARIAE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {42},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {Background: It is well known that exercise induce physiological stress
   on horse's body system, causing significant changes in blood components.
   Haematological changes associated with exercise have been widely
   analyzed to provide information about health status and athletic
   performance in horses. Numerous studies have been performed to
   investigate the response of haematological parameters to various types
   of exercise. However, only few studies dealt with reining horses.
   Reining is a typical Western discipline characterised by manoeuvres
   requiring fast and powerful muscle contractions and motor skills. The
   aim of this study was to assess the effect of a reining training session
   on some haematological parameters.
   Material, Methods \& Results: In the present study, eight Quarter Horses
   aged 5-15 years (three stallions and five mares; mean body weight 480
   +/- 60 kg) were used to establish physiologic responses to a reining
   training session. All subjects were housed at the same horse training
   centre in Sicily, Italy. All horses were subjected to the reining
   pattern 5 of National Reining Horse Association (NRHA), consisting of 2
   large circle gallop (G1; G2), 1 small circle lope (L1), 1 stop (STOP), 4
   spins (S1), 2 large circle gallop (G3; G4), 1 small circle lope (L2), 1
   stop (STOP), 4 spins (S2), 1 large circle gallop (G5), lead change
   (LC1), 1 small circle lope (L3), 1 large circle gallop (G6), lead change
   (LC2), 1 large circle gallop (G7), lead change (LC3), 2 rollbacks (RB1,
   RB2), 1 stop (STOP) and backing (B). Blood samples were collected from
   each animal before (T0) and immediately after completion of the pattern
   (T1). Further samples were collected after 1 h (T2), 2 h (T3) and 24 h
   (T4) after exercise, during the recovery period. Blood was analysed for
   haematological parameters using an automatic analyser. One way repeated
   measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a statistical significant
   effect of time on the following parameters: red blood cell (P < 0.0001),
   haemoglobin concentration (P < 0.0001), haematocrit (P < 0.0001) and
   white blood cell (P < 0.05). The application of Bonferroni's post-hoc
   comparison showed a statistical significant increase in red blood cell,
   haemoglobin and haematocrit values at T1 compared to T0, T2, T3 and T4.
   White blood cell count increased at T1 and T4 compared to T0.
   Discussion: Exercise has variable effects on hematological parameters.
   These differences might depend on both intensity and duration of
   physical effort. The increase in erythrocyte numbers together with the
   increase in Hb concentrations after exercise is probably a sequela of
   splenic contraction and subsequent release of erythrocytes with altered
   erythrocytic indices. High red blood cell counts and haemoglobin
   concentrations allow to increase oxygen transportation capacity to body
   tissues. In association with the increase in red blood cell and
   haemoglobin concentrations an increase in haematocrit. This might be due
   to exercise-induced fluid shifts as well as to splenic contraction. The
   spleen releases not only the stored erythrocytes but also the leukocytes
   into the peripheral circulation. These changes are likely secondary to
   catecholamine release and splenic contraction. The results of this study
   showed that a reining training session induces an increase in red blood
   cell, haemoglobin concentration, haematocrit and white blood cell
   concentrations, immediately after completion of the pattern, returning
   to basal values 1 h after exercise.},

Abstract = {The increased consumption of fish products, as well as the occurrence of
   exotic fish species in the Mediterranean Sea and in the fish market, has
   increased the risk of commercial fraud. Furthermore, the great amount of
   processed seafood products has greatly limited the application of
   classic identification systems. DNA-based identification allows a clear
   and unambiguous detection of polymorphisms between species, permitting
   differentiation and identification of both commercial fraud and
   introduction of species with potential toxic effects on humans. In this
   study, a novel DNA-based approach for differentiation of fish species
   based on pyrosequencing technology has been developed. Raw and processed
   fish products were tested, and up to 25 species of fish belonging to
   Clupeiformes and Pleuronectiformes groups were uniquely and rapidly
   identified. The proper identification based on short and unique genetic
   sequence signatures demonstrates that this approach is promising and
   cost-effective for large-scale surveys.},

Title = {Control of tick infestations and pathogen prevalence in cattle and sheep

   chimeric antigen},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {Background: Despite the use of chemical acaricides, tick infestations
   continue to affect animal health and production worldwide. Tick vaccines
   have been proposed as a cost-effective and environmentally friendly
   alternative for tick control. Vaccination with the candidate tick
   protective antigen, Subolesin (SUB), has been shown experimentally to be
   effective in controlling vector infestations and pathogen infection.
   Furthermore, Escherichia coli membranes containing the chimeric antigen
   composed of SUB fused to Anaplasma marginale Major Surface Protein 1a
   (MSP1a) (SUB-MSP1a) were produced using a simple low-cost process and
   proved to be effective for the control of cattle tick, Rhipicephalus
   (Boophilus) microplus and R. annulatus infestations in pen trials. In
   this research, field trials were conducted to characterize the effect of
   vaccination with SUB-MSP1a on tick infestations and the prevalence of
   tick-borne pathogens in a randomized controlled prospective study.
   Methods: Two cattle and two sheep farms with similar geographical
   locations and production characteristics were randomly assigned to
   control and vaccinated groups. Ticks were collected, counted, weighed
   and classified and the prevalence of tick-borne pathogens at the DNA and
   serological levels were followed for one year prior to and 9 months
   after vaccination.
   Results: Both cattle and sheep developed antibodies against SUB in
   response to vaccination. The main effect of the vaccine in cattle was
   the 8-fold reduction in the percent of infested animals while
   vaccination in sheep reduced tick infestations by 63\%. Female tick
   weight was 32-55\% lower in ticks collected from both vaccinated cattle
   and sheep when compared to controls. The seroprevalence of Babesia
   bigemina was lower by 30\% in vaccinated cattle, suggesting a possible
   role for the vaccine in decreasing the prevalence of this tick-borne
   pathogen. The effect of the vaccine in reducing the frequency of one A.
   marginale msp4 genotype probably reflected the reduction in the
   prevalence of a tick-transmitted strain as a result of the reduction in
   the percent of tick-infested cattle.
   Conclusions: These data provide evidence of the dual effect of a
   SUB-based vaccine for controlling tick infestations and pathogen
   infection/transmission and provide additional support for the use of the
   SUB-MSP1a vaccine for tick control in cattle and sheep.},

Title = {Macrophages Mediate a Switch between Canonical and Non-Canonical Wnt
   Pathways in Canine Mammary Tumors},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 3},
Abstract = {Objective: According to the current hypothesis, tumor-associated
   macrophages (TAMs) are ``corrupted{''} by cancer cells and subsequently
   facilitate, rather than inhibit, tumor metastasis. Because the molecular
   mechanisms of cancer cell-TAM interactions are complicated and
   controversial we aimed to better define this phenomenon.
   Methods and Results: Using microRNA microarrays, Real-time qPCR and
   Western blot we showed that co-culture of canine mammary tumor cells
   with TAMs or treatment with macrophage-conditioned medium inhibited the
   canonical Wnt pathway and activated the non-canonical Wnt pathway in
   tumor cells. We also showed that co-culture of TAMs with tumor cells
   increased expression of canonical Wnt inhibitors in TAMs. Subsequently,
   we demonstrated macrophage-induced invasive growth patterns and
   epithelial-mesenchymal transition of tumor cells. Validation of these
   results in canine mammary carcinoma tissues (n = 50) and xenograft
   tumors indicated the activation of non-canonical and canonical Wnt
   pathways in metastatic tumors and non-metastatic malignancies,
   respectively. Activation of non-canonical Wnt pathway correlated with
   number of TAMs.
   Conclusions: We demonstrated that TAMs mediate a ``switch{''} between
   canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways in canine mammary
   tumors, leading to increased tumor invasion and metastasis.
   Interestingly, similar changes in neoplastic cells were observed in the
   presence of macrophage-conditioned medium or live macrophages. These
   observations indicate that rather than being ``corrupted{''} by cancer
   cells, TAMs constitutively secrete canonical Wnt inhibitors that
   decrease tumor proliferation and development, but as a side effect, they
   induce the non-canonical Wnt pathway, which leads to tumor metastasis.
   These data challenge the conventional understanding of TAM-cancer cell
   interactions.},

Abstract = {A study was carried out to verify the appropriateness of the Hazard
   Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) plan adopted in a school
   catering facility. To that end, the microbiological quality of foods,
   the correct implementation of special diets (lactose- and gluten-free)
   and the nutritional value of foods were assessed. Thirty-six samples of
   lactose-free and 87 samples of gluten-free special diet food
   preparations were subjected to microbiological, chemical, and
   nutritional analyses. The data collected demonstrate the effectiveness
   of the HACCP plan in reducing the occurrence of microbial and chemical
   (lactose and gluten) cross-contamination. The data obtained from the
   nutritional analyses showed that the dietary intake provided by the
   meals under study was satisfactory.},

Title = {The unique Mesola red deer of Italy: taxonomic recognition (Cervus
   elaphus italicus nova ssp., Cervidae) would endorse conservation(\#)},
Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {81},
Number = {1},
Pages = {136-143},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Most likely, the red deer Cervus elaphus Linnaeus, 1758 from the Bosco
   della Mesola Nature Reserve are the last autochthonous red deer in the
   Italian peninsula. In the 20(th) century, they nearly became extinct and
   have only recently recovered to higher numbers (at least c. 150 head in
   2010). Apart from their historical relevance to the Italian fauna, they
   are also evolutionarily distinct at both the genetic and the
   morphological level. However, taxonomically, they are classified as part
   of the Central European red deer subspecies (Cervus elaphus
   hippelaphus), which encompasses most of the red deer from the European
   mainland. While we are fully aware of the high degree of arbitrariness
   of subspecific designations, it is also a fact that taxonomic
   recognition supports conservation, because subspecies are a legal
   category whereas other designations (such as evolutionarily significant
   units, ESUs) are not. We therefore argue that the Mesola red deer should
   be assigned to a subspecies of their own, and give an official
   description of Cervus elaphus italicus nova ssp., including the
   designation of a holo- and a paratype specimen. Given the evolutionary
   status of the Mesola red deer, subspecific recognition is certainly much
   better founded than is the case for many other so-called subspecies in
   present red deer taxonomy.},

   from different matrices. They were all selected from 389 Salmonella
   enterica subspecies enterica strains isolated during 2008-2010 in
   Abruzzo region (Italy). Thirty-seven strains showed to be resistant to
   more than 1 antibiotic. Among 47 isolates, phage type U311 and DT104
   were identified. The ASSuT resistance pattern was predominant in mST
   strains and ACSSuT in ST DT104 and U302. A multiplex Polimerase Chain
   Reaction (PCR) method was used to investigate 4 genes: fluorfenicol
   (floSt), virulence (spvC), invasine (invA) and integrase (int). All ST
   the strain were positive for invA gene and 28,32\% of strains were
   positive for spvC gene. PFGE analysis revealed a large number of small
   clonal populations, however not ascrivable to outbreaks.},

Title = {Genetic Characterization and Evolution of H1N1pdm09 after Circulation in

Journal = {BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2014},
Abstract = {Following the emergence of the A(H1N1)pdm09 in humans, this novel
   influenza virus was reverse transmitted from infected people to swine
   population worldwide. In this study we investigated the molecular
   evolution of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus identified in pigs reared in a single
   herd. Nasal swabs taken from pigs showing respiratory distress were
   tested for influenza type A and A(H1N1)pdm09 by real-time RT-PCR assays.
   Virus isolation from positive samples was attempted by inoculation of
   nasal swabs samples into specific pathogen free embryonated chicken eggs
   (ECE) and complete genome sequencing was performed on virus strains
   after replication on ECE or from original swab sample. The molecular
   analysis of hemagglutinin (HA) showed, in four of the swine influenza
   viruses under study, a unique significant amino acid change, represented
   by a two-amino acid insertion at the HA receptor binding site.
   Phylogenetic analysis of HA, neuraminidase, and concatenated internal
   genes revealed a very similar topology, with viruses under study forming
   a separate cluster, branching outside the A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates
   recognized until 2014. The emergence of this new cluster of A(H1N1)pdm09
   in swine raises further concerns about whether A(H1N1)pdm09 with new
   molecular characteristics will become established in pigs and
   potentially transmitted to humans.},

Abstract = {In most European countries, registration and identification of dogs is
   compulsory. In Italy, the national dog registry is composed of regional
   dog registries. Although dog registries have been established for many
   years, the issue related to completeness of data has not been addressed
   so far. The objective of this study was twofold: first to assess the
   completeness of data of the dog registry through telephone interview of
   a sample of dog owners drawn from the dog registry, then to estimate the
   total owned dog population in 4 boroughs of Rome. For the second
   objective, a capture-recapture method was applied using data from the
   dog registry and data from a face-to-face questionnaire submitted to
   people waiting in the sitting room of 5 points of access for booking and
   payment of primary and specialist care. Different scenarios are proposed
   to verify the assumptions of the estimation procedure and potential
   biases are discussed. The completeness of data of the dog registry was
   88.9\% (95\% CI: 85.8-91.9\%) and the owned-dog population was estimated
   at 26,244 dogs (95\% CI: 24,110-28,383). The dog registry is an
   important source of information especially when it is properly updated
   and completeness of data is known.(C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Atypical and classical scrapie-infected sheep brain tissue was
   monolaterally injected into the tonsils of lambs to investigate their
   role as a prion entry point. We first detected classical PrPSc within
   the inoculated tonsil and in the ipsilateral retropharyngeal lymph node
   at 3 months postinoculation (p.i.). At 7 months p.i., PrPSc colonized
   other lymphoid tissues bilaterally, including ileal Peyer's patches. The
   earliest PrPSc deposition within the brain was ipsilaterally observed at
   9 months p.i. in the substantia reticularis of the medulla oblongata. At
   12 months p.i., PrPSc deposition was present bilaterally in the nucleus
   parasympathicus nervi vagi, as well as in the intermediolateral cell
   column of the thoracolumbar spinal cord. No PrPSc was detected in the
   lambs inoculated with atypical scrapie. These findings suggest that
   neuroinvasion may naturally occur from the tonsil after a widespread
   prion replication within the lymphoid tissues during classical scrapie
   only, thus mimicking the pathogenesis after oral ingestion.},

Journal = {NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {13},

Pages = {246-254},
Abstract = {Annyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative
   disease that occurs in two clinically indistinguishable forms: sporadic
   (SALS) and familial (FALS), the latter linked to several gene mutations,
   mostly inheritable in a dominant manner. Nearly 20\% of FALS forms are
   linked to mutations in the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene.
   Research on ALS relies on transgenic models and particularly on mice
   carrying a glycine-to-alanine conversion at the 93rd codon (G93A) of the
   hSOD1 gene. Although G93A transgenic mice have been widely employed in
   clinical trials and basic research, doubts have been recently raised
   from numerous reliable sources about their suitability to faithfully
   reproduce human disease. Besides, the scientific community has already
   foreseen swine as an attractive and alternative model to nonhuman
   primates for modeling human diseases due to closer anatomical,
   physiological and biochemical features of swine rather than rodents to
   humans. On this basis, we have produced the first swine ALS model by in
   vitro transfection of cultured somatic cells combined with somatic cell
   nuclear transfer (SCNT). To achieve this goal we developed a SOD1(G93A)
   (superoxide dismutase 1 mutated in G1y93-Ala) vector, capable of
   promoting a high and stable transgene expression in primary porcine
   adult male fibroblasts (PAF). After transfection, clonal selection and
   transgene expression level assessment, selected SOD1(G93A) PAF colonies
   were used as nuclei donors in SCNT procedures. SOD1(G93A) embryos were
   transferred in recipient sows, and pregnancies developed to term. A
   total of 5 piglets survived artificial hand raising and weaning and
   developed normally, reaching adulthood. Preliminary analysis revealed
   transgene integration and hSOD1(G93A) expression in swine tissues and
   360 degrees phenotypical characterization is ongoing. We believe that
   our SOD1(G93A) swine would provide an essential bridge between the
   fundamental work done in rodent models and the reality of treating ALS.

   aeschlimannii were detected in Rh. turanicus, Rh. sanguineus,
   Dermacentor marginatus, and Hyalomma marginatum marginatum ticks from
   dogs, goats, wild boar, and horse. Moreover, Candidatus Rickettsia
   barbariae was detected in 2 Rh. turanicus ticks from goats. The
   detection of RI. conorii israelensis, an emergent agent which causes
   Israeli spotted fever, increases our knowledge on tick-borne

Abstract = {To assess the effect of transport duration on animal welfare and meat
   quality of lambs, two trials were performed: Forty Ile-de-France x
   Merino lambs were used in Trial 1 and 40 Comisana lambs in Trial 2. In
   both trials, the lambs, aged between 14 and 16 weeks, were divided into
   two groups of 20 animals. One group was subjected to a 1-h period of
   transportation (T1) and the other to a 24-h period of transportation
   (T24), both in the same truck and arriving to the same slaughterhouse at
   the same time. The effect of transport on serum biochemistry variables
   (cortisol, aspartate transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, blood urea
   nitrogen, creatine kinase, creatinine and total proteins), salivary
   cortisol, metabolites of cortisol in faeces, intra-ruminal temperature
   and meat quality (pH, conductivity, expressible juice, colour and shear
   force) was assessed. In both studies, the duration of transport did not
   affect serum and salivary cortisol concentration (P > 0.05). However, in
   Trial 2, lambs exposed to 24-h transport had a higher concentration of
   faecal cortisol metabolites than did those transported for 1 h (P <
   0.05). Blood variables were not affected by transport in either trial (P
   > 0.05), with the exception of blood urea nitrogen which was higher in
   Trial 1 for the T24 group (P < 0.05) than it was to T1 group. Although
   no signs of dehydration were found, intra-ruminal loggers showed that
   animals did not drink during the transportation in the way they did
   before transport. In Trial 1, no effect of transport duration was found
   on meat-quality traits (P > 0.05). Nevertheless, in Trial 2, lambs
   exposed to 24-h transport had higher values of colour attribute of a{*}
   (red trend) and less tenderness or higher values of shear force (P <
   0.05). The present study showed that although there is little effect on
   meat quality, signs of stress are detectable in lambs transported for 24
   h. Therefore, in the case of lambs, the effect of long transportation
   periods must be considered more in terms of animal welfare than in terms
   of product quality.},

Abstract = {The growth parameter (maximum specific growth rate, mu(max)) of two
   different strains of Listeria monocytogenes on sliced Mortadella were
   calculated. Three batches of sliced Mortadella were vacuum packed,
   stored at 8 degrees C and samples collected at different time intervals
   were enumerated for L. monocytogenes. The pathogen counts were fitted
   using the DMFit version 2.1 Excel (R) add-in, based on Baranyi model, to
   determine the specific growth rates. At 8 degrees C the sliced
   Mortadella supported rapid and prolific L. monocytogenes growth: the
   mu(max) varied between 0.035/h and 0.044/h, and the pathogen counts
   increased up to 10(8) CFU/g after 21-27 days. A square root type model,
   Ratkowsky model, was used to describe how mu(max) changes as a function
   of storage temperature. Growth kinetics data could be useful for
   establishing a safe shelf life, once the product could be post process
   contaminated and stored under different handling scenarios.},

   polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), dioxin-like polychlorinated

   Italian population was assessed through a duplicate diet study on
   prepared meals. Baby food composite representative of the diet of
   toddlers aged 9-12 months and school canteen servings from four towns in
   Italy representing the diet of children aged 4-9 years were collected on
   a 5-day basis. Similarly, 5-day lunches from an office canteen, 7-day
   lunches from a hotel-school, three fast food meals, and eight duplicate
   1-day meals of individuals (one vegetarian) were selected to represent
   the diet of adults aged above 18 years. Servings from each diet were
   then pooled to form a composite and analysed. Dietary intake was
   estimated from the resulting contaminant levels in composites combined
   with age-related food consumption data from national survey. The mean
   upper bound (UB) intakes for cumulative PCDDs, PCDFs, and DL-PCBs were
   0.67, 0.63-0.92, and 0.27-0.63 pg WHO2005-TE kg(-1) body weight (bw)
   day(-1) for toddlers, children and adults, respectively. BDE-47 (UB) ng
   kg(-1) bw day(-1) estimates were 2.75 in toddlers, 0.08-0.16 in children
   and 0.03-0.09 in adults. Similarly, for BDE-99 higher UB intakes (ng
   kg(-1) bw day(-1)) resulted in toddlers (1.26), than those in children
   (0.06-0.08) and adults (0.03-0.10), respectively. The above estimates
   fall below the tolerable weekly intake (TWI) (14 WHO2005-TE kg(-1) bw
   day-1) established by the European Union Scientific Committee on Food
   (SCF) for PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs. The margin of exposure (MOE = 3) of
   toddlers to BDE-99 clearly indicates this age group as target for a
   risk-oriented approach. This study is proposed as a first cost-effective
   screening in PCDD, PCDF, DL-PCB and PBDE intake assessment, with a focus
   also on time trends.},

Title = {Epidemiology of West Nile Disease in Europe and in the Mediterranean
   Basin from 2009 to 2013},
Journal = {BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2014},
Abstract = {West Nile virus (WNV) transmission has been confirmed in the last four
   years in Europe and in the Mediterranean Basin. An increasing concern
   towards West Nile disease (WND) has been observed due to the high number
   of human and animal cases reported in these areas confirming the
   importance of this zoonosis. Anew epidemiological scenario is currently
   emerging: although new introductions of the virus from abroad are always
   possible, confirming the epidemiological role played by migratory birds,
   the infection endemisation in some European territories today is a
   reality supported by the constant reoccurrence of the same strains
   across years in the same geographical areas. Despite the WND
   reoccurrence in the Old World, the overwintering mechanisms are not well
   known, and the role of local resident birds or mosquitoes in this
   context is poorly understood. A recent new epidemiological scenario is
   the spread of lineage 2 strain across European and Mediterranean
   countries in regions where lineage 1 strain is still circulating
   creating favourable conditions for genetic reassortments and emergence
   of new strains. This paper summarizes the main epidemiological findings
   on WNV occurrence in Europe and in the Mediterranean Basin from 2009 to
   2013, considering potential future spread patterns.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to estimate the levels of
   polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans
   (PCDFs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs and NDL-PCBs) in blood
   serum obtained from non-occupationally exposed volunteers living in the
   Naples area (Campania Region, southern Italy).
   The samples were taken from two geographical zones: one was an urban
   area of Naples and its surroundings and the other was located in an area
   deemed to be at high environmental risk.
   Total mean concentrations of these persistent pollutants proved to be in
   the range 1.43-17.38 pg WHO-TEQ 1998 g(-1) lipid for PCDD/Fs, and
   0.98-25.45 pg WHO-TEQ 1998 g(-1) lipid for DL-PCBs. NDL-PCBs were in the
   range 316.57-482.90 ng g(-1) lipid.
   No significant differences were observed between women and men, nor
   between donors living in the two different areas.
   The mean levels of PCDD/Fs and PCBs in the population living in the
   Naples area were lower than those observed in some studies of
   populations living in exposed areas (near incineration plants or
   industrial sites) and urban or rural areas. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Educational interventions in school represent a primary way to introduce
   children to public health issues. In particular, as foodborne diseases
   are considered a worldwide significant problem, according to the World
   Health Organization (WHO), an educational program has been implemented
   to improve children knowledge about microorganisms' characteristics and
   food contamination, and their everyday behaviors concerning personal
   hygiene. Twelve public schools in Padua province were enrolled, for a
   total of 249 children attending the fifth grade of primary school.
   Health programs are usually targeted to adults and teenagers; a method
   that take into account children's peculiar learning and communicative
   skills was adopted. Aim of the study is to determine whether
   interventions based on practical activities that dynamically involve
   children with experiments and scientific observations are more efficient
   that purely theoretical programs. To assess the different effectiveness
   of the interventions, a between subjects experimental design has been
   set up, with random assignment of classes to theoretical (N=120) and
   practical (N=123) groups. The evaluation of children knowledge was
   assessed in two ways: 1) the analysis of a questionnaire collected
   before and after the intervention; 2) the analysis of a creative drawing
   about the microorganisms collected before and after the intervention
   that has been related to a semi-structured interview, to comprehend the
   meanings of the picture. Results show that although both the programs
   (theoretical and practical) were effective, the practical work
   stimulated a qualitatively deeper comprehension of the given
   information, especially in relation to the causal linkage between
   protective behaviors and control of contagion risk. (C) 2013 The Authors

Abstract = {An indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to
   screen sulfonamide residues in food (muscle, eggs, milk and honey) and
   feed has been developed and validated according to Commission Decision
   2002/657/EC. The immunoreagents were appropriately produced to detect a
   wide range of sulfonamide antibiotic congeners, obtaining half-maximum
   inhibition concentration (IC50) values below 10 mu g L-1 for 11
   sulfonamides widely used in veterinary practices. Taking into account
   the complexity of involved matrices, specific sample preparation
   protocols have been optimised combining high method throughput with low
   detectable concentrations. Accordingly, depending on the congener, the
   obtained detection capabilities (CC beta s) were lower or equal to 20 mu
   g kg(-1) (muscle, eggs and milk), 10 mu g kg-1 (honey) and 2 mg kg(-1)
   (feed). Finally the developed qualitative test was applied to real
   samples collected within the official monitoring programmes: results
   exceeding the established screening cut-off were re-analysed with a
   suitable confirmatory method. The presence of one or more sulfonamides
   was found in all the suspect screening samples thus demonstrating that
   the proposed ELISA can be successfully applied in class-specific
   detection of sulfonamides in food and feed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Is HCRTR2 a Genetic Risk Factor for Alzheimer's Disease?},

Abstract = {Backgrounds/Aims: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the main types of
   dementia affecting about 50-55\% of all demented patients. Sleep
   disturbances in AD patients are associated with the severity of dementia
   and are often the primary reason for institutionalization. These sleep
   problems partly resemble the core symptoms of narcolepsy, a sleep
   disorder caused by a general loss of the neurotransmitter hypocretin.
   The aim of our study was to investigate whether genetic variants in the
   hypocretin (HCRT) and in the hypocretin receptors 1 and 2 (HCRTR1,
   HCRTR2) genes could modify the occurrence and the clinical features of
   AD and to examine if these possible variants influence the role of the
   protein in sleep regulation. Methods: Using a case-control strategy, we
   genotyped 388 AD patients and 272 controls for 10 SNPs in the HCRT,
   HCRTR1 and HCRTR2 genes. In order to evaluate which residues belong to
   the HCRTR2 binding site, we built a molecular model. Results: The
   genotypic and allelic frequencies of the rs2653349 polymorphism were
   different (chi(2) = 5.77, p = 0.016; chi(2) = 6.728, p = 0.035) between
   AD patients and controls. The carriage of the G allele was associated
   with an increased AD risk (OR 2.53; 95\% CI 1.10-5.80). No significant
   differences were found in the distribution of either genotypic or
   allelic frequencies between cases and controls in the HCRTR1
   polymorphisms rs2271933, rs10914456 and rs4949449 and in the HCRTR2
   polymorphism rs3122156. Conclusion: Our data support the hypothesis that
   the HCRTR2 gene is likely to be a risk factor for AD. The increased risk
   inferred is quite small, but in the context of a multi-factorial
   disease, the presence of this polymorphism may significantly contribute
   to influencing the susceptibility for AD by interacting with other
   unknown genetic or environmental factors in sleep regulation. (C) 2014

Abstract = {During March 2011 an outbreak of gastroenteritis occurred in Santo
   Stefano di Quisquina, Agrigento, Sicily, Italy. Within two weeks 156
   cases were identified among the 4,965 people living in the municipality.
   An epidemiological investigation was conducted to characterize the
   outbreak and target the control measures. A case was defined as a person
   developing diarrhea or vomiting during February 27-March 13, 2011. Stool
   specimens were collected from 12 cases. Norovirus (NoV) genotype GII. 4
   variant New Orleans 2009 was identified in stool samples from 11 of 12
   cases tested (91.7\%). Epidemiological investigations suggested a
   possible association with municipal drinking water consumption. Water
   samples from the public water system were tested for NoV and a variety
   of genotypes were detected during the first 3 months of surveillance,
   including GII. 4 strains belonging to different variants from that
   involved in the gastroenteritis outbreak. Contamination of the well and
   springs supplying the public water network was eventually thought to be
   the source of the NoV contamination.},

Abstract = {Naples and Caserta provinces are extensively affected by the illegal
   dumping of hazardous and urban wastes, which were periodically set to
   fire. Several studies were made on the possible health impact of this
   illegal waste management. The aim of the study was to detect dioxins
   levels in breast milk of volunteer primiparae and to assess the possible
   source of dioxins in the affected areas. The authors determined dioxins
   levels in breast milk from 100 primiparae from the study area and
   collected anamnestic information on donors. We determined dioxins levels
   in breast milk from 100 primiparae from the study area and collected
   anamnestic information on donors. As a measure of environmental risk of
   dioxins (EDR) we used the interpolated values of dioxins concentration
   in buffalo milk samples collected in the study area. Correlations
   between the EDR, age of the mother, smoking habit, cheese consumption,
   occupation in activity at risk, presence of plants for the disposal of
   toxic waste or illegal burning of solid waste near the residence of the
   donor and dioxin level in breast milk were investigated. The dioxin
   level in breast milk is significantly correlated to the EDR, the age of
   the sampled women and the presence of illegal burning of solid waste.

Abstract = {Areas of sympatry and hybridization of closely related species can be
   difficult to assess through morphological differences alone. Species
   which coexist and are similar morphologically may be distinguished only
   with molecular techniques. The roe deer (Capreolus spp.) is a
   meso-mammal having a Palaearctic distribution, with two closely related
   species: the European C.capreolus and the Siberian C.pygargus. We
   analysed mtDNA sequences from 245 individuals, sampled through all the
   entire range of the genus, to investigate the distribution of genetic
   lineages and outline phylogeographical patterns. We found that: (1) a
   C.pygargus lineage occurs in Poland and Lithuania, much farther west
   than the area which so far was believed its westernmost limit; (2) no
   haplotype of this C.pygargus lineage matches any found in East Europe
   and Asia - this should rule out human introductions and may indicate
   Pleistocene-Holocene migrations from the east; (3) no geographical
   structuring of C.pygargus lineages occurs, questioning the existence of
   putative subspecies; (4) several genetic lineages of C.capreolus can be
   recognized, consistent with the existence of two subspecies,
   respectively in central-southern Italy and southern Spain. Coalescence
   times suggest that intraspecific variation in C.capreolus and C.pygargus
   developed approximately 100-10kya. The extant mitochondrial lineages
   pre-dated the Last Glacial Maximum. Capreolus pygargus must have moved
   westward to Central Europe, where at least one genetic lineage still
   survives, coexisting with C.capreolus.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of

Abstract = {Objective: This study describes an effective educational program to
   improve children's knowledge about characteristics of microorganisms and
   food contamination, and their personal hygiene behaviors. Materials and
   Methods: Between November 2011 and March 2012, a health campaign,
   targeted at fifth-grade students of 12 public primary compulsory
   schools, was conceived. Participants were divided into two classes, a
   theoretical class and a practical class based on two different teaching
   approaches. To address children's knowledge and behaviors on the program
   topics and to monitor the effectiveness of the health campaign on
   changing pre-existent concepts and habits, pre- and post-intervention
   questionnaires were administered both to students and parents. Poisson
   and binomial mixed models were performed. Results: Two hundred
   forty-nine children were enrolled. Results show an overall improvement
   in children's knowledge both for the practical and theoretical classes
   (incident risk ratios {[}IRRs]: 1.2, 95\% confidence interval (CI)
   1.1-1.2, p<0.001 and 1.1, 95\% CI 1.0-1.1, p<0.001, post- versus
   pre-intervention). The same effect was observed for children's behavior,
   comparing post- versus pre-intervention for both groups (IRRs were 3.4,
   95\% CI 2.2-5.2, p<0.001 and 3.2 95\% CI 1.9-5.5, p<0.001). Conclusion
   and Applications: The methodology described in this article might be
   usefully adopted to conduct food safety classes, contributing to the
   amelioration of children's awareness on food related risks and leading
   to significant benefit for primary prevention.},

Journal = {BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2014},
Abstract = {Genetic typing of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) has distinguished
   BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 species and an emerging putative third species
   (HoBi-like virus), recently detected in southern Italy, signaling the
   occurrence of natural infection in Europe. Recognizing the need to
   update the data on BVDV genetic variability in Italy for mounting local
   and European alerts, a wide collection of 5.. UTR sequences (n = 371)
   was selected to identify the frequency of genotypes and subtypes at the
   herd level. BVDV-1 had the highest frequency, followed by sporadic
   BVDV-2. No novel HoBi-like viruses were identified. Four distribution
   patterns of BVDV-1 subtypes were observed: highly prevalent subtypes
   with a wide temporal-spatial distribution (1b and 1e), low prevalent
   subtypes with a widespread geographic distribution (1a, 1d, 1g, 1h, and
   1k) or a restricted geographic distribution (1f), and sporadic subtypes
   detected only in single herds (1c, 1j, and 1l). BVDV-1c, k, and l are
   reported for the first time in Italy. A unique genetic variant was
   detected in the majority of herds, but cocirculation of genetic variants
   was also observed. Northern Italy ranked first for BVDV introduction,
   prevalence, and dispersion. Nevertheless, the presence of sporadic
   variants in other restricted areas suggests the risk of different routes
   of BVDV introduction.},

Abstract = {Introduction:
   The IZSV-edu project was realized within the framework issued by the
   European Union, along with the strategy for animal health and public
   health 2007-2013, which aims to ensure public health through the
   reduction of food risks, providing clear and transparent information to
   consumers. In this context, the Istituto Zoooprofilattico Sperimentale
   delle Venezie (IZSVe), in collaboration with the Regional School Office
   for the Veneto Region (USR), has designed and implemented the 2-years
   project ``IZSV-edu{''}, directed at high school students. The first
   edition was held between November 2011 and May 2012, and the second was
   held between November 2012 and May 2013, in 3 different Regions of
   North-Italy.
   Aims and methodology:
   The project was designed to promote health education, to improve
   students' knowledge and to develop technical competencies in the context
   of food safety and risk communication, within the methodological
   framework of ``learning by doing{''}. In addition to these educational
   goals, scientific data were collected on knowledge, attitudes,
   intentions and habits of the students, in order to evaluate the
   effectiveness of an integrated ``theoretical-practical{''} approach,
   compared to a classical one. All the lessons were given by experts and
   researchers from the IZSVe, paying particular attention to the
   development of science and risk communication skills.
   Results:
   The 1st edition was attended by 850 students (35 classes, 140 lessons).
   Teachers and students could choose among more than 20 different didactic
   modules, including microbiology, chemistry, hystopatology, parasitology,
   virology, molecular biology, epidemiology, risk and science
   communication. In this edition, from an initial situation of correct
   knowledge equal to 63.1 \%, after the introductory course it passed to
   89\%. The general learning scored a satisfactory result, with 83, 1\% of
   correct questions after the intervention.
   The 2nd edition was attended by 175 students (12 classes, 18 lessons),
   and it was focused on chemical risks in food and risk communication. The
   classes were divided into two laboratories, virtual lab and practical
   lab. A risk communication lab followed. The learning evaluation shows
   that the mean number of correct answers is higher after the
   intervention; comparing the two methods there are significant
   differences in the mean number of correct answers given in the
   questionnaire ex-post: virtual = 15,54; practical = 14,86 (F=4,386;
   p=0,038).
   For both the editions students were required to realize effective
   science and risk communication products.
   Discussion and conclusion:
   The project succeeded in transferring knowledge and skills to students
   and schools have demonstrated a keen interest in the proposal. The
   satisfaction was generally high: 97\% of teachers have expressed a
   ``good{''} or ``very good{''} preference, while among students was
   94.5\%.
   The didactic modules attracted considerable scientific interest in
   current issues, and they proved to be essential for learning contents,
   providing an added value with respect to the traditional teachings. On
   the other side, the science communication modules resulted innovative
   and challenging, for the proper understanding of the relationship
   between science, media and society.},

Abstract = {The study addressed the communication of chemical risks in food to
   adolescents with a view to evaluating the potential, the effectiveness
   and the limitations of web- and paper-based tools. The tools were
   developed through a participatory process based on the active
   involvement of the target group. The method used to convey the
   communication message was storytelling.
   A sample of 327 students living in north-eastern Italy evaluated the
   tools through two questionnaires. An assessment was made of the tools'
   effectiveness in transmitting knowledge, changing perceptions of
   chemical risks and arousing students' interest. Results showed that
   perception of chemical risks and scientific knowledge increased
   significantly among participants following exposure to both
   communication tools, but the paper-based tool was the preferred medium.
   The digital tool exhibited comparable effectiveness to the paper tool in
   terms of improving learning and changing risk perception, making it a
   valuable tool in the design of risk-prevention campaigns. However, the
   paper-based tool met higher approval, suggesting that further studies
   are needed in Italy to better understand young people's preferences in
   media usage and the correlations between approval, learning and changes
   in behaviours. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Multiplex Evaluation of Influenza Neutralizing Antibodies with Potential
   Applicability to In-Field Serological Studies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2014},
Abstract = {The increased number of outbreaks of H5 and H7 LPAI and HPAI viruses in
   poultry has major public and animal health implications. The continuous
   rapid evolution of these subtypes and the emergence of new variants
   influence the ability to undertake effective surveillance. Retroviral
   pseudotypes bearing influenza haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA)
   envelope glycoproteins represent a flexible platform for sensitive,
   readily standardized influenza serological assays. We describe a
   multiplex assay for the study of neutralizing antibodies that are
   directed against both influenza H5 and H7 HA. This assay permits the
   measurement of neutralizing antibody responses against two antigenically
   distinct HAs in the same serum/plasma sample thus increasing the amount
   and quality of serological data that can be acquired from valuable sera.
   Sera obtained from chickens vaccinated with a monovalent H5N2 vaccine,
   chickens vaccinated with a bivalent H7N1/H5N9 vaccine, or turkeys
   naturally infected with an H7N3 virus were evaluated in this assay and
   the results correlated strongly with data obtained by HI assay. We show
   that pseudotypes are highly stable under basic cold-chain storage
   conditions and following multiple rounds of freeze-thaw. We propose that
   this robust assay may have practical utility for in-field
   serosurveillance and vaccine studies in resource-limited regions
   worldwide.},

Abstract = {To analyse the effect of pasture availability and genotype on innate
   immunological status, morphological organisation of lymphoid follicles,
   behaviour, performance and carcass and meat characteristics, 80 growing
   rabbits (40 Leprino of Viterbo and 40 New Zealand White, NZVV) were
   reared in bicellular standard cages (control) or in a wired pen,
   provided with an external grass pasture (pasture). Blood samples and
   behaviour observations (10 rabbits per group) were performed at
   different ages (weaning, 49 and 89 d). At the end of the trial, 10
   rabbits per group were slaughtered to study meat quality/composition and
   vermiform appendix structure. Leprino rabbits showed higher serum
   lysozyme values than NZW for all ages and rearing systems. Leprino
   rabbits showed the highest values in caged animals (29.6 and 32.4 mg/mL,
   respectively at 49 and 89 d of age), while NZW animals did so in the pen
   (2.2 and 0.00 g/mL, respectively at 49 and 89 d of age). Haemolytic
   Complement Assay increased with age in Leprino (43.7 vs. 48.6 and 51.2
   mu g/mL, respectively for cage and pen), but decreased in NZW (68.6 vs.
   25.8 and 41.1 mu g/mL, respectively for cage and pen). Plasma TBARs was
   always higher in Leprino rabbits (16.0 vs. 7.0 mu mol malondialdehyde/L
   at 29 d of age; 17.9 vs. 8.0 mu mol malondialdehyde/L at 49 d of age;
   20.0 vs. 11.4 mu mol malondialdehyde/L at 89 d of age), whereas plasma
   tocopherol showed an inverse trend (32.9 vs. 46.6 mg/L at 29 d of age;
   32.5 vs. 44.4 mg/L at 49 d of age; 31.2 vs. 42.4 mg/L at 89 d of age).
   Mortality rate of Leprino rabbits was highest in the cage system, while
   mortality was highest in NZW housed in the pen. Productive performance,
   carcass traits and fatty acid composition of meat were strongly affected
   by genotype and rearing system. Regarding genotype effect, Leprino
   showed lower daily gains (31.9 and 29.6 vs. 44.2 and 40.0 g,
   respectively for cage and pen system), live (2563 and 2418 vs. 2902 and
   2650, respectively for cage and pen system) and carcass weights (1561
   and 1465 vs. 1763 and 1580, respectively for cage and pen system).
   Pasture availability improved the meat nutritional quality and, in
   particular, the n-6/n-3 ratio was optimal and the total tocopherol
   content was suitable to assure a good oxidative stability.},

Abstract = {The first detection of Aethina tumida Murray (the small hive beetle) in
   Italy occurred on 5 September 2014. Three nuclei containing honey bees
   (Apis mellifera) and located in a clementine (citrus) orchard near an
   important international harbour in the Calabria region (southern Italy)
   were heavily infested with adult and larval A. tumida. A. tumida
   infestation is a notifiable disease of honey bees in the European Union
   as well as an OIE listed disease. To prevent any A. tumida introduction,
   the importation of honey bees is regulated strictly in the European
   Union (Commission Regulation (EU) No. 206/2010). Early reaction measures
   adopted in Italy require that beekeepers must notify A. tumida discovery
   to the local veterinary services and cannot move their colonies.
   Furthermore, a protection area (20 km radius) and surveillance (100 km
   radius) zone should be established. The surveillance zone now includes
   the entire territory of Calabria region. Compulsory visits to all
   apiaries in the protection zone with the collection of the spatial
   information by means of a georeferentiation process (georeferentiation
   can be defined as the process to describe a location relative to the
   earth, in this context the process consists on the collection of the
   spatial coordinate of a point that represents the spatial location of
   the apiaries by means of a GPS device) and colony inspection according
   to 5\% expected prevalence (95\% CI) are applied. Destruction of
   infested apiaries is compulsory and the soil under the infested colonies
   must be ploughed and treated with pyrethroids. If apiaries in the
   protection zone are found to be negative, traps are placed. In the
   surveillance zone, veterinarians visit apiaries that are selected
   according to a risk analysis (migration in infested areas, honey bee or
   materials exchange) or randomly and colonies are inspected according to
   2\% expected prevalence (95\% CI). Furthermore, in Italy as well in the
   rest of Europe, investigations are in progress by competent authorities
   to make an inventory of all bees and colonies moved from Calabria during
   2014. Subsequent controls on colonies should be implemented. People from
   the honey bee network (beekeepers, veterinarians, beekeeping material
   producers and distributors) should be aware and informed of the hazard
   posed by A. tumida to honey bees.},

Title = {Recovery of South Australian rabbit populations from the impact of
   rabbit haemorrhagic disease},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {41},
Number = {7},
Pages = {552-559},
Abstract = {Context Recovery of Australian rabbit populations from the impact of
   rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) contrasts with more prolonged
   suppression of wild rabbits in Europe, and has been widely discussed in
   the scientific community, but not yet documented in formal scientific
   literature. The underlying causes of recovery remain unclear, but
   resistance to RHDV infection has been reported in laboratory studies of
   wild-caught rabbits.
   Aims We document numerical changes in two South Australian wild rabbit
   populations that were initially suppressed by RHDV, and examine
   serological data to evaluate several alternative hypotheses for the
   cause of recovery.
   Methods Rabbit numbers were assessed from spotlight transect counts and
   dung mass transects between 1991 and 2011, and age and RHDV antibody
   sero-prevalence were estimated from rabbits shot in late summer.
   Key results Rabbit numbers were heavily suppressed by RHDV between 1995
   and 2002, then increased 5- to 10-fold between 2003 and 2010. During the
   period of increase, annual RHDV infection rates remained stable or
   increased slightly, average age of rabbits remained stable and annual
   rainfall was below average.
   Conclusions Rabbit populations recovered but neither avoidance of RHDV
   infection, gradual accumulation of long-lived RHD-immune rabbits, nor
   high pasture productivity were contributing factors. This leaves
   increased annual survival from RHDV infection as the most likely cause
   of recovery.
   Implications Previously documented evidence of resistance to RHDV
   infection may be of little consequence to post-RHD recovery in rabbit
   numbers, unless the factors that influence the probability of infection
   also shape the course of infection and affect survival of infected
   rabbits.},

Abstract = {The pathogenicity of a Nervous Necrosis Virus isolate obtained from
   naturally infected Golden grey mullet (Liza auratus) suffering serious
   mortalities in Iranian coastline water of the Caspian Sea was
   investigated for first time. An experimental infection has been
   performed using three groups, two experimental groups and one control
   group of Guppy (Poecilia reticulata) with mean weight 0.47 +/- 0.09 g,
   at temperature 25 degrees C. The infectious dosage (50 ml) with
   TCID50/ml= 10 (4.25) for 2 hours in group 1and 4 hours in group 2
   developed the disease with immersion method. Clear clinical signs
   associated with significant mortality were observed since 15 dpi.
   Cumulative mortalities rose to 100\% at 30 dpi. While in the control
   group no mortality was recorded.
   Virus was re-isolated on SSN-1 cell line that showing typical CPE
   developed after inoculation with tissues filtrate from dead fish.
   Histopathological examination of exposed fish, showed clear
   vacuolization in the granular layer of the retina and cerebellum. TEM
   micrographs revealed intracytoplasmic vacuoles in the retina of infected
   Guppy. IHC revealed the presence of viral antigens in the brain and
   retina.
   These results confirmed the pathogenicity of the NNV isolate obtained
   from Golden grey mullet suffering high mortality with regard to suggest
   that the same agent isolated from golden grey mullet is very likely the
   cause of the mortality observed in the same species.},

Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of image analysis
   measurements in combination with the official analytical method for the
   detection of constituents of animal origin in feedstuffs, in
   distinguishing between bovine and swine (bone containing) material.
   Authentic samples of controlled origin containing bovine or swine meat
   and bone meals were analysed by the microscopic method, in accordance
   with the official analytical method. Sediment fractions of each sample
   were observed with a compound microscope at X40. A total of 362 bone
   fragment lacunae images were recorded and processed through image
   analysis software, deriving 30 geometric variables for each lacuna.
   Results indicated that not only were most variables significantly
   (P<0.001) different between bovine and swine samples, but also that two
   thirds of the same variables were bigger in bovine than in swine. This
   information, however, does not seem to be so effective in practice since
   bovine and swine features and measurements overlapped. It can be
   concluded that the microscopic method even when combined with image
   analysis does not fit all the requirements for accurately identifying
   prohibited ingredients of animal origin. A combined approach with other
   methods is therefore recommended.},

Title = {Determination of polychlorinated biphenyls in fish: Optimisation and

Journal = {FOOD CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2014},

Abstract = {A simple and robust method for the determination of 18 polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs) in fish was developed and validated. A mixture of
   acetone/n-hexane (1:1, v/v) was selected for accelerated solvent
   extraction (ASE). After the digestion of fat, the clean-up was carried
   out using solid phase extraction silica cartridges. Samples were
   analysed by GC-MS in selected ion monitoring (SIM) using three fragment
   ions for each congener (one quantifier and two qualifiers). PCB 155 and
   PCB 198 were employed as internal standards.
   The lowest limit of detection was observed for PCB 28 (0.4 ng/g lipid
   weight). The accuracy of the method was verified by means of the
   Certified Reference Material EDF-2525 and good results in terms of
   linearity (R-2 > 0.994) and recoveries (80-110\%) were also achieved.
   Precision was evaluated by spiking blank samples at 4, 8 and 12 ng/g.
   Relative standard deviation values for repeatability and reproducibility
   were lower than 8\% and 16\%, respectively.
   The method was applied to the determination of PCBs in 80 samples
   belonging to four Mediterranean fish species.
   The proposed procedure is particularly effective because it provides
   good recoveries with lowered extraction time and solvent consumption; in
   fact, the total time of extraction is about 12 min per sample and, for
   the clean-up step, a total solvent volume of 13 ml is required. (C) 2013

Title = {Expression of CYP4 and GSTr genes in Venerupis philippinarum exposed to

Volume = {196},

Abstract = {Bivalve molluscs, such as Venerupis philippinarum, are often used as
   bioindicators of environmental pollution since they can bioaccumulate a
   large variety of pollutants because of their filter feeding. The
   Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) is an
   important contaminant, commonly present in the marine environment.
   Pollutants are generally metabolized by enzymes of phase I, mainly CYPs
   enzymes, and by conjugation enzymes of phase II like GST. In this study,
   we investigated by Real Time PCR the expression of CYP4 and GSTr (GST
   class rho) in the digestive gland of V. philippinarum exposed to
   different concentrations of B(a)P for 24 h and after a 24 h depuration
   period. Accumulation of B(a)P by clams has been confirmed by the
   HPLC-FLD analyses. Moreover, HPLC-FLD analyses evidenced that after
   depuration, B(a)P concentrations decreased in animals subjected to 0.03
   mg/l and 0.5 mg/l exposures but did not decrease in animals subjected to
   1 mg/l exposure. B(a)P exposure and depuration did not cause
   histopathological lesions in the different organs. The analysis of GSTr
   expression in the digestive gland showed a significant increase in mRNA
   in animals subjected to 1 mg/l exposure, whereas the analysis of CYP4
   expression did not evidence differences among treatments. Moreover, the
   expression of both genes did not exhibit any differences after the
   purification treatment. The results demonstrate that B(a)P significantly
   affects the expression of GSTr mRNA in the digestive gland of V.
   philippinarum and suggest that GSTr gene could play an important role in
   the biotransformation of B(a)P. Published by Elsevier GmbH.},

Abstract = {Between September 6 and 21, 2012, seven human cases of West Nile virus
   (WNV) neuroinvasive infection were laboratory confirmed in Croatia. The
   median patient age was 62 years (range 48-77). Five patients presented
   with meningoencephalitis and two patients with meningoencephalitis
   followed by acute flaccid paralysis. Four of them had an underlying
   disease (hypertension). Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA),
   WNV-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies of low avidity
   were detected in six patients, whereas one showed only IgM antibodies.
   All samples were confirmed using plaque-reduction neutralization and
   microneutralization tests. Five patients recovered fully. Before human
   cases were reported, acute asymptomatic WNV infection was demonstrated
   by detection of IgM antibodies in sentinel horses. Moreover, an
   increased WNV IgG seropositivity in horses was detected in counties
   where human cases occurred. Adulticidal and larvicidal treatments were
   administered immediately in the respective places of residence. The end
   of the warm season contributed to the fact that there were no new cases
   of WNV disease recorded.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine ochratoxin A (OTA) concentrations
   in the raw materials and cooked meat products made from pigs
   sub-chronically exposed to OTA. The treated animal group (n = 5) was
   administered with 300 mu g OTA/kg of feed for 30 days, whereas the
   control group (n = 5) was left untreated. OTA concentrations were
   quantified using immunoassay (ELISA) and high performance liquid
   chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FD). OTA concentration
   was the highest in the kidney, followed by the lungs, liver, blood,
   spleen, heart, and adipose tissue. As for the final meat products, the
   highest average OTA concentration was detected in black pudding sausages
   (14.02 +/- 2.75 mu g/kg), then in liver sausages (13.77 +/- 3.92 mu
   g/kg), while the lowest was found in pale (933 +/- 2.66 mu g/kg). The
   results pointed out that a sub-chronic pig exposure leads to the
   accumulation of OTA in raw materials and consequently in meat products,
   whose level of contamination is directly dependent on OTA contents in
   raw materials used for their production. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Despite pattern recognition methods for human behavioral analysis has
   flourished in the last decade, animal behavioral analysis has been
   almost neglected. Those few approaches are mostly focused on preserving
   livestock economic value while attention on the welfare of companion
   animals, like dogs, is now emerging as a social need. In this work,
   following the analogy with human behavior recognition, we propose a
   system for recognizing body parts of dogs kept in pens. We decide to
   adopt both 2D and 3D features in order to obtain a rich description of
   the dog model. Images are acquired using the Microsoft Kinect to capture
   the depth map images of the dog. Upon depth maps a Structural Support
   Vector Machine (SSVM) is employed to identify the body parts using both
   3D features and 2D images. The proposal relies on a kernelized
   discriminative structural classificator specifically tailored for dogs
   independently from the size and breed. The classification is performed
   in an online fashion using the LaRank optimization technique to
   obtaining real time performances. Promising results have emerged during
   the experimental evaluation carried out at a dog shelter, managed by
   IZSAM, in Teramo, Italy.},

Title = {Observational study of hypertension and snoring in Northeastern Italy
   (Limana Hypertension Study)},
Journal = {CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL HYPERTENSION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4},
Pages = {263-267},
Abstract = {Objective: To evaluate through an observational study on volunteers some
   important cardiovascular disease risk factors such as hypertension and
   snoring in a population from Limana, a town of a subalpine zone of
   northeastern Italy.
   Design: Limana residents were informed by post and at a public meeting
   and then attended an outpatient clinic set up by the town of Limana for
   clinical history, measurement of blood pressure, weight and height.
   Patients: 01 202 subjects (94 men and 108 women), 92.6\% of whom were
   residents of Limana, having a mean age of 59.7 years, which was
   significantly higher than the mean (44.7 years), took part in the study.
   Results: Only 32.3\% of study subjects with hypertension had normal
   blood pressure values while 38.6\% of the subjects without hypertension
   treatment, were hypertensive. We found no significant association
   between hypertension and smoking and there were significant associations
   between hypertension and age and hypertension and snoring.
   Conclusions: Given the limitations of an observational study based on
   volunteer participation, nevertheless, our study presents some
   interesting results: (1) a low number of subjects with hypertension
   whose blood pressure is well controlled; (2) a significant number of
   ``normal{''} subjects with high values of blood pressure; (3) no
   significant relationship between hypertension and smoking; (4) a
   significant relationship between subjects who snored and were
   hypertensive.},

Title = {Frequency of Piroplasms Babesia microti and Cytauxzoon felis in Stray
   Cats from Northern Italy},
Journal = {BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2014},
Abstract = {Emerging diseases caused by piroplasms pose a health risk for man and
   other animals, and domestic cats have been proposed as potential
   reservoirs for some piroplasm infections. The aim of this study was to
   identify the frequency of the piroplasms Babesia microti and Cytauxzoon
   felis in stray cats from northern Italy and to identify possible risk
   factors associated with these infections. Blood samples from 260 stray
   cats enrolled in a trap-neuter-release (TNR) program in northern Italy
   were examined with conventional PCR for the presence of Babesia microti
   and Cytauxzoon felis DNA. No sample (0.0\%) tested positive for C.
   felis, whilst B. microti DNA was detected in two samples (0.8\%). Both
   infected cats were in good clinical condition and recovered well from
   the neutering surgery. One of these two cats had a triple coinfection
   with Babesia microti, Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum, and Anaplasma
   phagocytophilum. Evidence presented in this study indicates that the
   blood borne protozoans Babesia microti and Cytauxzoon felis are not
   widely distributed in stray cat populations in Milan, northern Italy,
   and that the significance of cats as a reservoir host for B. microti in
   this area is limited.},

Title = {Taurine Rescues Cisplatin-Induced Muscle Atrophy In Vitro: A
   Morphological Study},
Journal = {OXIDATIVE MEDICINE AND CELLULAR LONGEVITY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2014},
Abstract = {Cisplatin (CisPt) is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug whose side
   effects include muscle weakness and cachexia. Here we analysed
   CisPt-induced atrophy in C2C12 myotubes by a multidisciplinary
   morphological approach, focusing on the onset and progression of
   autophagy, a protective cellular process that, when excessively
   activated, may trigger protein hypercatabolism and atrophy in skeletal
   muscle. To visualize autophagy we used confocal and transmission
   electron microscopy at different times of treatment and doses of CisPt.
   Moreover we evaluated the effects of taurine, a cytoprotective
   beta-amino acid able to counteract oxidative stress, apoptosis, and
   endoplasmic reticulum stress in different tissues and organs. Our
   microscopic results indicate that autophagy occurs very early in 50 mu M
   CisPt challenged myotubes (4 h-8 h) before overt atrophy but it persists
   even at 24 h, when several autophagic vesicles, damaged mitochondria,
   and sarcoplasmic blebbings engulf the sarcoplasm. Differently, 25
   mMtaurine pretreatment rescues the majority of myotubes size upon 50 mu
   M CisPt at 24 h. Taurine appears to counteract atrophy by restoring
   regular microtubular apparatus and mitochondria and reducing the
   overload and the localization of autophagolysosomes. Such a promising
   taurine action in preventing atrophy needs further molecular and
   biochemical studies to best define its impact onmuscle homeostasis and
   the maintenance of an adequate skeletal mass in vivo.},

Abstract = {AimThe aim of this work was to evaluate the efficacy of domestic cooking
   in inactivating Manila clams experimentally infected with murine
   norovirus (MNV).
   Methods and ResultsA cooking pan was modified to enable electronic
   temperature probes to be positioned to record both flesh and environment
   temperature. Manila clams were infected with 10(4)TCID50\%ml(-1) of MNV.
   The infected whole-in-shell clams, divided into three replicates, were
   cooked on an electric stove, and groups of nine clams were removed from
   the pan at fixed intervals. Pools of three digestive glands were
   examined by virus isolation to ascertain residual viral load.
   ConclusionResults showed that 10min of cooking by a traditional domestic
   method at a temperature close to 100 degrees C, for at least 2min, can
   completely devitalize the MNV in infected clams. This is generally the
   time needed for the majority of valves to open up.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyAt present, it is highly recommended
   to label all lagoon products as requiring cooking before consumption',
   but no specifications are given on how long and at what temperature they
   should be cooked. Our results can provide the consumer with useful
   indications on how to cook clams to prevent any risk of foodborne
   illness.},

Abstract = {The sarcoptic mange epizootic affecting chamois in the Dolomites Alps
   since 1995 has risen considerable concern in a management and
   conservation perspective, due to its strong impact on chamois and ibex
   populations. A remarkable amount of data has been collected by different
   wildlife research and management institutions, in order to analyze mange
   patterns and develop possible strategies to control the disease. The
   present study is aimed at providing a population-related figure of the
   spatial and temporal dynamics of clinical sarcoptic mange in alpine
   chamois, proposing an approach in which relevant basic concepts and
   parameters, as the definition of the epidemic front and its spreading
   speed, can be estimated and framed. The epidemic front was referred to
   the different mountain massifs, corresponding to well established
   management units of the chamois in the study area; moreover, the
   mange-related mortality peak at the massif level was used (in
   substitution of the index case/s) for temporal analysis of the disease
   spreading. Two speeds of the front have been estimated: a first raw
   average speed of about 3.38 km/year, and a second refined speed of 4.64
   +/- 3.12 km/year, more consistent to the variability in the field. The
   time series analysis showed that the impact of mange increases over the
   late winter months, reaching a peak in early spring.
   Our results strengthen the conclusions of previous studies, proposing a
   new frame to include other studies in progress on the Alpine
   chamois-Sarcoptes interactions},

Abstract = {This article presents results of an analysis of winter losses of honey
   bee colonies from 19 mainly European countries, most of which
   implemented the standardised 2013 COLOSS questionnaire. Generalised
   linear mixed effects models (GLMMs) were used to investigate the effects
   of several factors on the risk of colony loss, including different
   treatments for Varroa destructor, allowing for random effects of
   beekeeper and region. Both winter and summer treatments were considered,
   and the most common combinations of treatment and timing were used to
   define treatment factor levels. Overall and within country colony loss
   rates are presented. Significant factors in the model were found to be:
   percentage of young queens in the colonies before winter, extent of
   queen problems in summer, treatment of the varroa mite, and access by
   foraging honey bees to oilseed rape and maize. Spatial variation at the
   beekeeper level is shown across geographical regions using random
   effects from the fitted models, both before and after allowing for the
   effect of the significant terms in the model. This spatial variation is
   considerable.},

Title = {Modulation of plasma antioxidant activity in weaned piglets by plant

Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of plant polyphenols
   (PP) on antioxidant activity in weaned piglets. First, a uniform design,
   one optimising an experimental technique that can rationally arrange the
   concentrations of mixture components, was used to obtain the best PP
   mixture of apple, grape seed, green tea and olive leaf polyphenols based
   on in vitro antioxidant capacity and inhibitory action on bacterial
   growth. Second, the optimised PP mixture was tested in vivo with an
   efficacy trial on piglets. The optimal effects of the mix were observed
   in vitro when apple, grape seed, green tea, olive leaf polyphenols and a
   carrier (silicon dioxide) accounted for 16.5, 27.5, 30, 2.5 and 23.5\%,
   respectively, of the mixture. Forty-eight weaned piglets were randomly
   allocated to two dietary treatments (6 replicates of 4 piglets each per
   treatment) and fed a control diet (CTR) or CTR supplemented with 0.1\%
   of the optimised PP mixture. Dietary PP did not affect growth
   performance compared to the CTR group. Plasma total protein, urea
   nitrogen and lysozyme content were not affected by dietary treatment. No
   differences of E. coli or Clostridia counts in the faeces and caecum
   content between the CTR and PP groups were observed. A reduced
   malondialdehyde concentration in the PP group was observed on day 21
   compared to the CTR group (P= 0.02). In conclusion, the prepared PP
   mixture has the potential to improve plasma antioxidant activity.},

Abstract = {In this study, an immunoproteomic approach was used to identify
   immunodominant proteins from Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri isolates.
   Membrane proteins, extracted through TX-114 phase partitioning, were
   separated using mono- and two-dimensional electrophoresis and detected
   by Western blotting with pooled sera from naturally infected goats. A
   total of 27 immunoreactive spots, corresponding to 13 different
   proteins, were identified using nanoLC-ESI-MSMS. Function annotation
   revealed that most of these proteins were metabolic enzymes involved in
   carbohydrate and energy metabolism. The immunogenic proteins identified
   in this study: pyruvate dehydrogenase, dihydrolipoamide
   acetyltransferase, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase, phosphate
   acetyltransferase, phosphopyruvate hydratase, adenine
   phopshoribosyltransferase, transketolase, translation elongation factor
   G, translation elongation factor Ts, FMN-dependent NADH-azoreductase,
   peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase, inorganic diphosphatase and
   trigger factor may be used as biomarkers for the serological diagnosis

   at position 487 of the kat gene altered the functionality of the
   catalase enzyme. This is the first report of a catalase-negative mRSA in
   animals. As catalase test is a rapid assay routinely employed for the
   identification of staphylococci in clinical microbiology laboratories,
   the presence of MRSA with this uncommon phenotype may be underestimated.
   Moreover, catalase-negative staphylococci should be investigated more
   in-depth in order to assess their virulence. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Is the horse a reservoir or an indicator of Coxiella burnetii infection?
   Systematic review and biomolecular investigation},

Abstract = {The role of the horse in Coxiella burnetii infection has not been
   defined. Accordingly, a twofold approach was taken to further our
   knowledge on this topic: (1) conduct a systematic review of the
   literature to establish available evidence of C. burn etii infection in
   the horse; (2) undertake a biomolecular investigation of 122 cases of
   equine abortion, stillbirth and neonatal foal death, for the presence of
   C burnetii using a PCR test targeting the 151111 gene of C bumetii.
   A review of the literature turned up seven studies that identified C
   bumetii DNA in equine specimens, especially aborted fetuses, while an
   additional 34 studies sought to determine seroprevalence of the
   infection in the horse. A meta-analytical approach was taken to
   calculate a pooled mean seroprevalence in equines based on published
   studies. A seroprevalence of 15.8\% (95\% confidence interval:
   9.6-23.0\%) was obtained. This figure is comparable to those previously
   reported in other species, especially ruminants.
   None of the 122 cases of equine abortion, stillbirth or neonatal foal
   death were positive for C. burnetii DNA.
   C. bumetii has rarely been looked for in equine specimens in previous
   studies. Cases of equine abortion should be comprehensively investigated
   to assess the risk of abortion in a pregnant mare infected with C.
   bumetii. Consideration should also be given to the possible role of the
   horse as a source of the organism for other animal species including
   humans. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {VIRUS RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {178},
Number = {1},
Pages = {114-120},

Abstract = {Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of the H5N1 subtype emerged in
   Far East Asia in 1996 and spread in three continents in a period of 10
   or less years. Before this event, avian influenza infections caused by
   highly pathogenic viruses had occurred in many different countries,
   causing minor or major outbreaks, and had always been eradicated.
   The unique features of these H5N1 viruses combined to the geographic
   characteristics of the area of emergence, including animal husbandry
   practices, has caused this subtype to become endemic in several Asian
   countries, as well as in Egypt. Our aim is to review the direct and
   indirect control strategies with the rationale for use, advantages and
   shortcomings particularly resulting from practicalities linked to field
   application and economic constraints. Certainly, in low income countries
   which have applied vaccination, this has resulted in a failure to
   eradicate the infection. Although the number of infected countries has
   dropped from over 40 (2006) to under 10 (2012), the extensive
   circulation of H5N1 in areas with high poultry density still represents
   a risk for public and animal health. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Results of own-check for Aflatoxin M1 contamination in milk in Lombardy
   region},
Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {19},
Number = {6},
Pages = {251-255},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Introduction - Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus are the
   main fungi responsible for Aflatoxin (AF) production. To provide an
   adequate margin of safety to protect human and animal health European
   Commission (EC) established maximum levels for AFs presence in food and
   feed (Commission Regulation No 1881/2006). The limit for AFM1 in milk is
   fixed at 0,050 mu g/kg (50 ppt); in Lombardy Region a more restrictive
   limit has been fixed at 0,030 mu g/kg (30 ppt) for raw milk for direct
   sale (CIR/19/SAN 2007 Lombardia). The impact of climatic conditions has
   been identified as an emerging issue for food and feed safety. In summer
   2012 an alert was launched because of AF feed contamination due to
   drought conditions. The surveillance performed on milk was increased in
   order to assess the risk for consumers and to warrant food safety. The
   aim of this paper is to present the results of AFM1 detection in milk
   samples collected by producers or dairy industries for own-check
   purposes in Lombardy Region from August 2012 to February 2013.
   Material - Commercial ELISA kit ``I'screen Afla M1{''} (TECNA S.r.l., I)
   was used for screening AFM1 concentration in 4.977 bulk tank milk
   samples; among them, about 400 samples originated from official control
   of raw milk for direct sale.
   Results - From August 2012 to February 2013, tolerance level of 50 ppt
   was exceeded in 2,2 to 23,3\% of the samples: the higher AFM1 value was
   found in September; the tolerance level of 30 ppt in raw milk for direct
   sale was exceeded in 3,5 to 35,5\% of the samples with the higher value
   in October.
   Conclusions - The monitoring of the AFM1 in bulk tank milk through a
   rapid screening method, mainly during critic period of the year, is able
   to describe the dynamic trend of AFM1 contamination, giving useful
   information to support the decision making actions, for example
   monitoring of effects of changes in bovine diet at single farm level.},

Abstract = {Several studies regarding the transcriptome of Mycobacterium
   tuberculosis following the exposure to various in vitro simulated
   phagosomal stressors, have already tried to elucidate the bacterium
   behavior during the intracellular infection. An in vitro
   acid-nitrosative multi-stress was carried out for M. tuberculosis H37Rv
   and Mycobacterium smegrnatis MC(2)155 in order to analyze by
   DNA-microarray the gene expression changes associated respectively to
   pathogenic and non-pathogenic mycobacterial species. During
   acid-nitrosative multi-stress both mycobacteria shift their
   transcriptome to allow the anaerobic respiratory state and energy
   pathways characteristic of starvation. M. tuberculosis counteracts the
   combined acid-nitrosative stress more efficiently than M. smegmatis as
   also shown by the up-regulation of glbN and hmp genes, that are
   specifically directed to NO detoxification. Moreover, the
   down-regulation of some virulence factors involved in phthiocerol
   dimycocerosates synthesis strengthens the hypothesis that these major
   virulence determinants may be attenuated by M. tuberculosis in the
   presence of reactive nitrogen species. In fact, it down-regulates other
   genes implicated in the synthesis of membrane structural lipids but in
   contrast to M. smegmatis, M. tuberculosis up-regulates many genes
   annotated for the synthesis of peptidoglycan. Results suggest a gene
   regulation of M. tuberculosis which reveals a distinctive expression
   pattern under stressful environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is an important human and animal pathogen, and is
   regarded as an important cause of intramammary infection (IMI) in
   ruminants. Staphylococcus aureus genetic variability and virulence
   factors have been well studied in veterinary medicine, especially in
   cows as support for control and management of IMI. The aim of the
   present study was to genotype 71 Staph. aureus isolates from the bulk
   tank and foremilk of water buffaloes (n = 40) and from udder tissue (n =
   7) and foremilk (n = 24) from small ruminants. The method used was
   previously applied to bovine Staph. aureus and is based on the
   amplification of the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region. The
   technique applied was able to identify different Staph. aureus genotypes
   isolated from dairy species other than the bovine species, and cluster
   the genotypes according to species and herds. Virulence gene
   distribution was consistent with genotype differentiation. The isolates
   were also characterized through determination of the presence of 19
   virulence-associated genes by specific PCR. Enterotoxins A, C, D, G, I,
   J, and L were associated with Staph. aureus isolates from buffaloes,
   whereas enterotoxins C and L were linked to small ruminants. Genes
   coding for methicillin resistance, Panton-Valentine leukocidin,
   exfoliative toxins A and B, and enterotoxins B, E, and H were
   undetected. These findings indicate that RNA template-specific PCR is a
   valid technique for typing Staph. aureus from buffaloes and small
   ruminants and is a useful tool for understanding udder infection
   epidemiology.},

Title = {Continuous straw provision reduces prevalence of oesophago-gastric ulcer

Abstract = {Adopting a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design, this study evaluated whether
   continuous straw provision by racks, tail docking and gender (barrows
   vs. females) have an effect on the prevalence of lung lesions and
   oesophago-gastric ulcer (OGU) visually scored at slaughter in 635
   Italian heavy pigs (169 +/- 4 kg). The lung lesions were very low (72\%
   of pigs with score 0), and were not significantly different among the
   experimental groups. Overall, OGU was diagnosed in 47\% of the pigs. The
   consumption of small amounts of straw (70 g/day/pig) represented a
   protective factor against the onset of OGU (OR: 0.27). Barrows were more
   likely than females to have OGU (OR: 1.52), while no significant
   differences between docked and undocked pigs were detected.
   Nevertheless, the presence of straw acted as a protective factor
   particularly in undocked pigs (OR: 0.16), suggesting that in this group
   the absence of rooting material may have a stronger effect on welfare.

Abstract = {This study reports a rapid PCR-based technique using a one-enzyme RFLP
   for discrimination of yeasts isolated from bovine clinical and
   subclinical mastitis milk samples. We analyzed a total of 1,486 milk
   samples collected over 1 yr in south Sardinia and northern Italy, and
   142 yeast strains were preliminarily grouped based on their cultural
   morphology and physiological characteristics. Assimilation tests were
   conducted using the identification kit API ID 32C and APILAB Plus
   software (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). For PCR-RFLP analysis,
   the 18S-ITS1-5.8S ribosomal(r) DNA region was amplified and then
   digested with HaeIII, and dendrogram analysis of RFLP fragments was
   carried out. Furthermore, within each of the groups identified by the
   API or PCR-RFLP methods, the identification of isolates was confirmed by
   sequencing of the D1/D2 region using an ABI,Prism 310 automatic
   sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The combined phenotypic
   and molecular approach enabled the identification of 17 yeast species
   belonging to the genera Candida (47.9\%), Cryptococcus (21.1\%),
   Trichosporon (19.7\%), Geotrichum (7.1\%), and Rhodotorula (4.2\%). All
   Candida species were correctly identified by the API test and their
   identification confirmed by sequencing. All strains identified with the
   API system as Geotrichum candidum, Cryptococcus uniguttulatus, and
   Rhodotorula glutinis also produced characteristic restriction patterns
   and were confirmed as Galactomyces geotrichum (a teleomorph of G.
   candidum), Filobasidium uniguttulatum (teleomorph of Crypt.
   uniguttulatus), and R. glutinis, respectively, by D1/D2 rDNA sequencing.
   With regard to the genus Trichosporon, preliminary identification by API
   was problematic, whereas the RFLP technique used in this study gave
   characteristic restriction profiles for each species. Moreover,
   sequencing of the D1/D2 region allowed not only successful
   identification of Trichosporon gracile where API could not, but also
   correct identification of misidentified isolates. In conclusion, the
   18S-ITS1-5.8S region appears to be useful in detecting genetic
   variability among yeast species, which is valuable for taxonomic
   purposes and for species identification. We have established an RFLP
   database for yeast species identified in milk samples using the software
   GelCompar II and the RFLP database constitutes an initial method for
   veterinary yeast identification.},

Abstract = {ObjectivesAn epidemiological survey was carried out in order to obtain a
   better understanding of the role of wild boars in the epidemiology of
   the influenza virus.
   DesignThe samples were submitted to Real-Time PCR testing for gene M of
   the swine influenza virus (SIV), and virus isolation was performed from
   the positive PCR samples. Genome sequence analysis was performed on the
   isolates. Additionally, 1,977 boar sera samples were analyzed using
   ELISA and hemoagglutination inhibition.
   SettingOver recent years, the wild boar population has greatly increased
   in Italy, including in areas of high-density industrial pig farming,
   where the influenza virus is widespread. From July to December 2012,
   wild boar lung samples were collected in the Parma and Piacenza area, in
   the Emilia Romagna region.
   Sample354 wild boar lung samples were collected.
   Main outcome measuresWild-boar influenza A virus infection should be
   studied more broadly in order to obtain a better understanding of the
   epidemiological role played by this species.
   ResultsThree SIV strains were isolated out of 12 samples that resulted
   positive using PCR analysis and they were identified as avian-like SIV
   subtype H1N1. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences obtained from
   isolate A/wild boar/291320/2012 showed that it clustered with recent
   Italian avian-like H1N1 SIVs isolated from domestic pigs. Sixty-eight
   sera samples showed a positive titer to the isolate A/wild
   boar/291320/2012.
   ConclusionsThis study suggests that SIV actively circulates in the wild
   boar population in the investigated. area.},

Abstract = {In June 2011, an outbreak of Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin food
   poisoning gastroenteritis occurred in Turin, Italy, following a catered
   dinner party at a private home. Within a few hours, 26 of the 47 guests
   experienced gastrointestinal illness, and 9 were hospitalized. A
   retrospective cohort study using a standardized questionnaire was
   carried out, and the risk ratios for each food item were calculated. The
   analysis indicated consumption of seafood salad as the most probable
   cause of the outbreak (risk ratio = 11.72; 95\% confidence interval,
   1.75 to 78.54). Biological samples were collected from four of the
   hospitalized guests (stool and vomit), nasal mucosa swabs from three
   food handlers employed with the caterer, and available food residuals.
   All stool and vomit samples tested positive for enterotoxigenic S.
   aureus. As residues of the seafood salad were no longer available for
   sampling, suspected contamination could not be verified. However, no
   other food was found contaminated by S. aureus or its enterotoxins. All
   isolates from the biological samples were characterized at the genomic
   level by means of two multiplex PCR protocols to determine the presence
   of genes encoding staphylococcal enterotoxins, pulsed-field gel
   electrophoresis and staphylococcal protein A gene (spa) typing to
   describe their genetic profiles. All the isolates presented genes
   encoding SEA and SET; the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis genetic
   profiles revealed the same pulsotype in the microorganism isolated from
   the hospitalized guests as in one of the isolates from a food handler's
   nasal mucosa, and the spa-typing analysis reported two closely related
   spa types (t701 and t267), implicating the food handler as the most
   likely outbreak source.},

Abstract = {1. In migratory species female- and male-mediated gene flow are
   important for defining relevant Management Units, and for evaluating
   connectivity between these and their respective foraging grounds.
   2. The stock composition at five Mediterranean foraging areas was
   investigated by analysing variation in the mitochondrial D-loop and six
   microsatellite loci in a sample of 268 loggerhead turtles (Caretta
   caretta) stranded or accidentally caught by fisheries. This involved a
   comprehensive Mixed Stock Analysis which considers also recent data from
   major rookeries in Libya and Turkey, and the generation of a
   standardized nomenclature of allele sizes at the microsatellite loci.
   3. The results indicate:
   that the north Adriatic, the Tunisian continental shelf, the waters
   around Malta and the Italian Ionian Sea represent important areas for
   the conservation of rookeries in Greece, Libya and Turkey, respectively;
   that waters off the Italian peninsula and the islands of Lampedusa and
   Malta are mainly inhabited by individuals of Mediterranean origin, with
   a major contribution from the nearest and largest colonies, while
   Atlantic turtles are restricted to the western areas;
   that specific migratory routes exist from rookeries to foraging grounds;
   a poor bi-parental genetic structuring, which suggests a high
   male-mediated gene flow in the Mediterranean;
   mixing of small turtles in waters distant from natal rookeries, and
   recovery of structuring for large-sized individuals; and
   that uncommon mtDNA haplotypes are more powerful markers than
   microsatellite alleles in assessing an individual's origin, owing to
   their higher geographic specificity. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {In this paper the preparation of magnetic nano-carriers (MNCs),
   containing superparamagnetic domains, is reported, useful as potential
   magnetically targeted drug delivery systems. The preparation of MNCs was
   performed by using the PHEA-IB-p(BMA) graft copolymer as coating
   material through the homogenization-solvent evaporation method. Magnetic
   and nonmagnetic nanocarriers containing flutamide (FLU-MNCs) were
   prepared. The prepared nanocarriers have been exhaustively characterized
   by dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM), and magnetic measurements. Biological evaluation was performed by
   in vitro cytotoxicity and cell uptake tests and in vivo biodistribution
   studies. Magnetic nanocarriers showed dimensions of about 300 nm with a
   narrow size distribution, an amount of loaded FLU of 20\% (w/w), and a
   superparamagnetic behavior. Cell culture experiments performed on
   prostate cancer cell line LNCaP demonstrated the cytotoxic effect of
   FLU-MNCs. In vivo biodistribution studies carried out by the application
   of an external magnetic field in rats demonstrated the effect of the
   external magnet on modifying the biodistribution of FLU-MNCs. FLU-MNCs
   resulted efficiently internalized by tumor cells and susceptible to
   magnetic targeting by application of an external magnetic field. The
   proposed nanocarriers can represent a very promising approach to obtain
   an efficient magnetically targeted anticancer drug delivery system.},

Title = {A monitoring study of glyceroltriheptanoate (GTH) in animal by-products

Abstract = {According to Commission Regulation (EU) No 142/2011, animal by-products
   (ABPs) not intended for human consumption should be excluded from the
   food chain, as they are a potential source of risks to public and animal
   health. As an example, in recent years an improper use of certain ABPs
   brought to a spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
   Therefore, Commission Regulation (EU) 142/2009 forces producers to mark
   permanently the ABPs not intended for human consumption (category 1 and
   category 2), with glyceroltriheptanoate (GTH). All EU Member States have
   the duty to control the content of GTH in ABPs, which should be present
   homogenously throughout the substance at a minimum concentration of at
   least 250 mg GTH per kg fat. Starting from a Joint Research Centre
   procedure (von Hoist, Boix, Bellorini, Androni, \& Serano, 2009), a
   method based on gas chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy (GC-MS)
   was studied and validated as stated by Regulation 882/2004, providing an
   efficient tool for both official and in-house laboratories. Moreover, a
   monitoring study on seventeen samples collected throughout Italy by the
   Official Veterinary Service in rendering industries was carried out.
   Eight samples were not compliant with Commission Regulation (EU) No
   142/2011, as their GTH concentration ranged from 224 mg kg(-1) to values
   below the lower range limit. Results found satisfied the requirements of
   European Union analytical methods validation criteria (Regulation (EC)
   No 882/2004). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Herpesviral infections frequently occur in horses. The objective of this
   study was to investigate the possible association of equine
   herpesviruses (EHV-1, EHV-2, EHV-3, EHV-4, EHV-5) with other causes of
   abortion, neonatal mortality or placental disorder. Sixty-seven
   abortions, 22 stillbirths, 14 cases of neonatal foal mortality and 3
   cases of placental disease were investigated for infectious and
   non-infectious causes. Type-specific nested PCR assays and virus
   isolation were performed to detect EHV infections. A cause of fetal loss
   or placental disease was reached in 68 out 116 (58.7 \%) cases.
   Twenty-seven cases were positive for EHV, and 22/27 (81.5 \%) were
   positive for EHV-1 (16 neuropathogenic and 6 non-neuropathogenic
   strains), 4 (14.8 \%) for EHV-2 and 3 (11.1 \%) for EHV-5. The
   association between EHV infections and other etiological agents was
   statistically significant (two sided P = 0.002). The odds ratio of EHV
   DNA associated with other diagnoses, especially with bacterial infection
   and premature placental separation, was 10.88 (95 \% confidence
   interval: 2.15-55.16). EHV-1 was the main viral cause of pregnancy loss
   in this study, also associated with other etiological agents, including
   EHV-2 and EHV-5. The latter viruses in particular need to be more fully
   investigated to elucidate what role either or both may play as
   co-infecting agents with other established infectious causes of
   reproductive disease.},

Abstract = {West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne virus belonging to the family
   Flaviviridae included in the Japanese encephalitis antigenic complex
   (JEAC). A seroepidemiological study was carried out in 2011 using 160
   horse sera collected from different areas of Bolivia to investigate the
   presence of WNV antibody. A high proportion (59.4\%) of the tested sera
   were positive to a commercially available WNV competitive enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (C-ELISA). Sixty-six randomly selected
   C-ELISA-positive sera were further tested by WNV plaque reduction
   neutralization test (PRNT), virus neutralization (VN), and
   immunoglobulin M (IgM)-WNV ELISA to exclude false-positive results due
   to possible cross-reactions to other members of the JEAC and to
   investigate if the horses were recently infected. No WNV IgM was
   detected in these samples, whereas neutralizing antibodies were found in
   21 and 18 samples by PRNT and VN, respectively. In conclusion, a high
   proportion of the Bolivian horses included in this study reacted
   serologically against viruses of the JEAC. WNV was partially responsible
   (31.8\%) for these reactions, supporting the conclusion that WNV
   circulated in Bolivia.},

Abstract = {Reverse transcription (RT) quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is the most
   accurate and easy-to-perform technique to measure the expression level
   of a selected gene of interest by quantifying mRNA transcripts. The use
   of reference genes is commonly accepted as the most reliable approach to
   normalize RT-qPCR data and reduce possible errors generated in the
   quantification of gene expression. The optimal number and choice of
   reference genes are experimentally validated for specific tissues or
   cell types and experimental designs. To date, data on qPCR normalization
   in goats are scarce and the most suitable reference genes in this
   species have been identified for only a limited number of tissues. The
   aim of this study was to determine an optimal combination of stably
   expressed reference genes in caprine milk somatic cells (MSC) from
   healthy and infected mammary glands. For the purpose, we performed
   RT-qPCR for 10 commonly used reference genes from various functional
   classes and then determined their expression level in MSC from goats
   intramammary challenged with Staphylococcus aureus and in MSC from
   healthy controls, with a view to select genes whose stability would be
   unaffected under infection conditions. The geNorm and NormFinder
   algorithms were used for validating the reference genes. Furthermore, to
   demonstrate the importance of normalization of gene expression with
   appropriate reference genes, we tested the effect of using a combination
   of the least stable genes for expression analysis evaluation. On the
   basis of our evaluation, we recommend the use of a panel of reference
   genes that should include G6PD, YWHAZ, and ACTB for caprine MSC gene
   expression profiling. The expression of the 2 genes of interest,
   pentraxin-related protein (PTX3) and secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1),
   was evaluated by RT-qPCR in all samples collected pre- and
   postinfection, and the recommended reference genes were used to
   normalize the data. Our study provides a validated panel of optimal
   reference genes for the identification of genes differentially expressed
   by qRT-PCR in caprine MSC. Moreover, we provided a set of
   intron-spanning primer sequences that could be suitable for gene
   expression experiments using SYBR Green chemistry on other caprine
   tissues and cells.},

Title = {Different evolutionary trends of swine H1N2 influenza viruses in Italy
   compared to European viruses},
Journal = {VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {44},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {European H1N2 swine influenza viruses (EU H1N2SIVs) arose from multiple
   reassortment events among human H1N1, human H3N2, and avian influenza
   viruses. We investigated the evolutionary dynamics of 53 Italian H1N2
   strains by comparing them with EU H1N2 SIVs. Hemagglutinin (HA)
   phylogeny revealed Italian strains fell into four groups: Group A and B
   (41 strains) had a human H1 similar to EU H1N2SIVs, which probably
   originated in 1986. However Group B (38 strains) formed a subgroup that
   had a two-amino acid deletion at positions 146/147 in HA. Group C (11
   strains) contained an avian H1 that probably originated in 1996, and
   Group D (1 strain) had an H1 characteristic of the 2009 pandemic strain.
   Neuraminidase (NA) phylogeny suggested a series of genomic reassortments
   had occurred. Group A had an N2 that originated from human H3N2 in the
   late 1970s. Group B had different human N2 that most likely arose from a
   reassortment with the more recent human H3N2 virus, which probably
   occurred in 2000. Group C had an avian-like H1 combined with an N2 gene
   from one of EU H1N2SIVs, EU H3N2SIVs or Human H3N2. Group D was part of
   the EU H3N2SIVs clade. Although selection pressure for HA and NA was
   low, several positively selected sites were identified in both proteins,
   some of which were antigenic, suggesting selection influenced the
   evolution of SIV. The data highlight different evolutionary trends
   between European viruses and currently circulating Italian B strains and
   show the establishment of reassortant strains involving human viruses in
   Italian pigs.},

Title = {Dermatophytosis in animals: epidemiological, clinical and zoonotic
   aspects},
Journal = {GIORNALE ITALIANO DI DERMATOLOGIA E VENEREOLOGIA},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {148},
Number = {6},
Pages = {563-572},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Aim. Dermatophytosis are the most frequent fungal infections of pets and
   livestock and play an important role in animal and human health due to
   their zoonotic potential. Another important aspect of these infections
   is linked to the economic consequences in farm animal and fur production
   systems. An overview of dermatophytosis in animals is described in this
   paper. Epidemiological, clinical and zoonotic aspects are addressed,
   considering individual species, both pets and farmed animals.
   Methods. In particular, most recent investigations in the field of
   animal mycology, carried out in Central Italy, are reported, with
   particular reference to rabbit, ruminants, horse, dog, cat and some wild
   species.
   Results. The information in this article show how dermatophytes infect a
   wide range of animals which may be in contact with human beings either
   directly or indirectly. Consequently they are frequently a source of
   infection for human beings who, vice versa, may sometimes become
   contagious for animals.
   Conclusion. Fungal pathogens derive their power to spread from
   contamination of the animal's habitat whether the animal is a
   conventional pet or not, a farm animal or living in the wild. Thus if
   treatment of the animal or human patient is to achieve optimal efficacy,
   it needs to be associated with adequate environmental measures.},

Title = {Variability of the hemocyte parameters of cultivated mussel Mytilus
   galloprovincialis (Lmk 1819) in Sabaudia (Latina, Italy) coastal lagoon},
Journal = {MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {92},
Pages = {215-223},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Sabaudia's lake consists of a protected coastal lagoon, located in
   the central Italy, historically characterized by recurrent mortality
   events of marine fauna during warmer months. A field study was monthly
   conducted on mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis cultivated inside the
   lagoon, measuring hemocyte parameters as total circulating count (THC),
   viability (HV), spreading and oxidative response to in vitro
   phagocytosis stimulation. A depression of the immune response was
   observed during the spring season, as indicated by higher values of
   hemocyte circularity and lower luminescence levels related to
   respiratory burst, also associated to modulation of THC and HV. The
   water temperature and the oxygen concentration appeared as the major
   environmental factors having influence on the phagocytosis activity.
   Therefore, the hemocyte variations have been intended as early danger
   signal to evaluate the immunodepression induced by the environmental
   stressors which could reveal in advance the development of critical
   situations for mussel survival. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Detection of Brucella abortus DNA and RNA in different stages of
   development of the sucking louse Haematopinus tuberculatus},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Background: Brucellosis is considered the world's most widespread
   zoonotic infection. It causes abortion and sterility in livestock
   leading to serious economic losses and has even more serious medical
   impact in humans, since it can be a trigger to more than 500,000
   infections per year worldwide. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   role of Haematopinus tuberculatus, a louse that can parasitize several
   ruminants, as a new host of brucellosis. Louse specimens were collected
   from seropositive and seronegative water buffaloes and divided in 3
   developmental stages: adults, nymphs and nits. All samples were
   separately screened for Brucella spp. DNA and RNA detection by Real Time
   PCR. In particular, primers and probes potentially targeting the 16S
   rRNA and the Brucella Cell Surface 31 kDalton Protein (bcsp31) genes
   were used for Real Time PCR and buffalo beta actin was used as a
   housekeeping gene to quantify host DNA in the sample. A known amount of
   B. abortus purified DNA was utilized for standard curve preparation and
   the target DNA amount was divided by the housekeeping gene amount to
   obtain a normalized target value. A further molecular characterization
   was performed for Brucella strain typing and genotyping by the
   Bruce-ladder, AMOS-PCR and MLVA assays. Data were statistically analysed
   by ANOVA.
   Results: Brucella abortus DNA and RNA were detected in all developmental
   stages of the louse, suggesting the presence of viable bacteria. Data
   obtained by MLVA characterization support this finding, since the
   strains present in animals and the relative parasites were not always
   identical, suggesting bacterial replication. Furthermore, the detection
   of Brucella DNA and RNA in nits samples demonstrate, for the first time,
   a trans-ovarial transmission of the bacterium into the louse.
   Conclusions: These findings identified H. tuberculatus as a new host of
   brucellosis. Further studies are needed to establish the role of this
   louse in the epidemiology of the disease, such as vector or reservoir.},

Abstract = {As a rainbow trout producer, Italy is accounted as fifth in the world
   and second in continental Europe. In this study, the levels of the
   eighteen PCBs in feed and in trout, showed a statistical significant
   difference (p < 0.01) throughout the years, with a declining trend from
   2005 to 2010. This trend shows effectively that quality and safety of
   trout feeds has greatly improved during the last years and, as a
   consequence, also the PCBs values in muscle trout, showed a decreasing
   trend.
   Moreover, feed Sigma 18PCBs showed a statistical significant difference
   (p < 0.01) among the analysed brands and was positively correlated (p <
   0.01 and r = 0.451) with the rainbow trout muscle Sigma 18PCBs. These
   results showed that the presence of PCBs in trout muscle is directly
   linked to the chemical quality of aquaculture feed. The most commonly
   detected PCBs congeners were congeners PCB 153 and PCB 138 in all the
   three compared brands. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Three standard methods for collecting sand flies (sticky trap, CDC light
   trap, and CO2 trap) were compared in a field study conducted from June
   to October, 2012, at a site located in the center of a newly established
   autochthonous focus of canine leishmaniasis in northeastern Italy. Six
   traps (two sticky traps, two CDC light traps, and two CO2 traps) were
   activated at the same time for a single night every two weeks during the
   season of sand fly activity. A total of 5,667 sand flies were collected
   and 2,213 identified, of which 82.1\% were Phlebotomus perniciosus,
   17.4\% P. neglectus, 0.3\% Sergentomya minuta, and 0.2\% P. mascitti.
   The performances of all traps were influenced by their position inside
   the site, increasing with proximity to the animal shelters. CO2 traps
   were more attractive for females of P. perniciosus and P. neglectus. CDC
   light traps showed an intermediate efficiency and were more attractive
   for P. neglectus, compared to other two traps. Results suggest that in
   northern Italy the CO2 trap is a suitable sampling method for sand fly
   monitoring programs that include transmitted pathogen surveillance.},

Title = {International Trade Standards for Commodities and Products Derived from
   Animals: The Need for a System that Integrates Food Safety and Animal
   Disease Risk Management},
Journal = {TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {60},
Number = {6},
Pages = {507-515},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {A case is made for greater emphasis to be placed on value chain
   management as an alternative to geographically based disease risk
   mitigation for trade in commodities and products derived from animals.
   The geographic approach is dependent upon achievement of freedom in
   countries or zones from infectious agents that cause so-called
   transboundary animal diseases, while value chain-based risk management
   depends upon mitigation of animal disease hazards potentially associated
   with specific commodities or products irrespective of the locality of
   production. This commodity-specific approach is founded on the same
   principles upon which international food safety standards are based,
   viz. hazard analysis critical control points (HACCP). Broader acceptance
   of a value chain approach enables animal disease risk management to be
   combined with food safety management by the integration of
   commodity-based trade and HACCP methodologies and thereby facilitates
   farm to fork' quality assurance. The latter is increasingly recognized
   as indispensable to food safety assurance and is therefore a
   pre-condition to safe trade. The biological principles upon which HACCP
   and commodity-based trade are based are essentially identical,
   potentially simplifying sanitary control in contrast to current separate
   international sanitary standards for food safety and animal disease
   risks that are difficult to reconcile. A value chain approach would not
   only enable more effective integration of food safety and animal disease
   risk management of foodstuffs derived from animals but would also
   ameliorate adverse environmental and associated socio-economic
   consequences of current sanitary standards based on the geographic
   distribution of animal infections. This is especially the case where
   vast veterinary cordon fencing systems are relied upon to separate
   livestock and wildlife as is the case in much of southern Africa. A
   value chain approach would thus be particularly beneficial to
   under-developed regions of the world such as southern Africa
   specifically and sub-Saharan Africa more generally where it would reduce
   incompatibility between attempts to expand and commercialize livestock
   production and the need to conserve the subcontinent's unparalleled
   wildlife and wilderness resources.},

Abstract = {The transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) to humans,
   leading to variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease has demonstrated that
   cattle transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) can pose a risk
   to human health. Until recently, TSE disease in cattle was thought to be
   caused by a single agent strain, BSE, also known as classical BSE, or
   BSE-C. However, due to the initiation of a large-scale surveillance
   programme throughout Europe, two atypical BSE strains, bovine
   amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy (BASE, also named BSE-L) and BSE-H
   have since been discovered. To model the risk to human health, we
   previously inoculated these two forms of atypical BSE (BASE and BSE-H)
   into gene-targeted transgenic (Tg) mice expressing the human prion
   protein (PrP) (HuTg) but were unable to detect any signs of TSE
   pathology in these mice. However, despite the absence of TSE pathology,
   upon subpassage of some BASE-challenged HuTg mice, a TSE was observed in
   recipient gene-targeted bovine PrP Tg (Bov6) mice but not in HuTg mice.
   Disease transmission from apparently healthy individuals indicates the
   presence of subclinical BASE infection in mice expressing human PrP that
   cannot be identified by current diagnostic methods. However, due to the
   lack of transmission to HuTg mice on subpassage, the efficiency of
   mouse-to-mouse transmission of BASE appears to be low when mice express
   human rather than bovine PrP.},

Abstract = {Many studies have demonstrated that xanthophylls, such as astaxanthin,
   have beneficial effects in human health, and their use in food
   supplements is thus encouraged. Moreover, such nutrients are frequently
   used in aquaculture to meet consumer demand for salmonoid flesh
   pigmentation. In this study different xanthophyll administration
   protocols were tested to verify pigmentation properties and safety of
   such mixtures of additives in trout diet. Residues of xanthophylls in
   muscle samples were determined by HPLC-MS/MS, reaching levels of 3.70
   +/- 0.04 mg/kg (astaxanthin) and 1.21 +/- 0.06 mg/kg (canthaxanthin)
   during a 56 day administration period. On the basis of the average fish
   consumption in the human diet, the highest astaxanthin and canthaxanthin
   concentrations detected in trout fillets could result in weekly intakes
   of 1.63 and 0.53 mg, respectively, in humans; these values are not
   sufficient to achieve the positive effects described by many authors,
   but their residues could still represent an important source of
   carotenoids, alternative to the use of synthetic dietary supplements.},

   were measured in fillets of both species. Hg-tot and MeHg in S. aurata
   ranged between 0.355-1.58 and 0.341-1.53 pg/g wet weight (ww),
   respectively; in D. labrax, their ranges were 0.284-2.54 and 0.214-2.35
   gg/g ww. Approximately 90\% of the concentrations measured exceeded
   Hgto, regulatory maximum level of 0.5 igig ww; however, exceedance rate
   was different in the two species studied. No correlations between

Abstract = {The effects of early weaning on the performances and molecular ontogeny

   were fed live feed until 27 days post-hatching (dph) (WP-27) and weaned
   with dry feed. The other groups provided only with dry feed (WP-4), live
   feed until 13 dph (WP-13) and live feed until 18 dph (WP-18), followed
   by weaning on to the same commercial microdiet (MD) used in the WP-27
   group (AgloNorse K/S Tromso Fiskeindustry A/S \& Co., Norway). The trial
   lasted until 33 dph. The larvae of theWP-4 group displayed a
   significantly lower survival rate, lower growth increase and a delay in
   the onset of metamorphosis when compared with the other groups. The
   WP-13 and WP-18 groups displayed significantly lower weight increases
   when compared with the WP-27 group, whereas metamorphosis development
   and survival were not influenced. Partial transcripts of trypsinogen 1
   (tryp1), trypsinogen 3 (tryp3), trypsinogen Y (trypY), chymotrypsinogen
   (chymt), amylase (amy) and hepatic lipase (HL) were cloned and analysed
   by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The tryp1 and chymt mRNA levels
   displayed a rapid increase in all the treatments between 4 and 8 dph and
   thereafter displayed a homogeneous fluctuating pattern with a higher
   increasing tendency for chymt at the end of the trial. The amount of
   tryp3 and trypY mRNA remained stable or slightly increased until 27 dph
   in all WP groups and thereafter displayed a general up-regulation trend.
   The amy transcript levels displayed a gradual increase throughout the
   study in all WP groups. The HL mRNA levels increased until 13 dph in the
   WP-27, WP-18 and WP-13 groups and thereafter remained generally stable
   until 27 dph, whereas in theWP-4 group, there was a linear time-related
   increasing trend until the end of the trial. This study supports
   previous results on the feasibility of early weaning of common sole
   larvae using a MD before the end of metamorphosis. The molecular
   ontogeny of some important digestive enzyme precursors is described for
   the first time in this species. The transcripts analysed were not
   greatly influenced by the WPs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {A spatial, statistical approach to map the risk of milk contamination by

Journal = {GEOSPATIAL HEALTH},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {In May 2005, beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (beta-HCH) was found in a sample
   of bovine bulk milk from a farm in the Sacco River valley (Latium
   region, central Italy). The primary source of contamination was
   suspected to be industrial discharge into the environment with the Sacco
   River as the main mean of dispersion. Since then, a surveillance
   programme on bulk milk of the local farms was carried out by the
   veterinary services. In order to estimate the spatial probability of
   beta-HCH contamination of milk produced in the Sacco River valley and
   draw probability maps of contamination, probability maps of beta-HCH
   values in milk were estimated by indicator kriging (IK), a
   geo-statistical estimator, and traditional logistic regression (LR)
   combined with a geographical information systems approach. The former
   technique produces a spatial view of probabilities above a specific
   threshold at non-sampled locations on the basis of observed values in
   the area, while LR gives the probabilities in specific locations on the
   basis of certain environmental predictors, namely the distance from the
   river, the distance from the pollution site, the elevation above the
   river level and the intrinsic vulnerability of hydro-geological
   formations. Based on the beta-HCH data from 2005 in the Sacco River
   valley, the two techniques resulted in similar maps of high risk of milk
   contamination. However, unlike the IK method, the LR model was capable
   of estimating coefficients that could be used in case of future
   pollution episodes. The approach presented produces probability maps and
   define high-risk areas already in the early stages of an emergency
   before sampling operations have been carried out.},

Abstract = {The interaction between living beings, including men, animals and

   unique dynamic system, in which the health of each component is
   inextricably interconnected and dependent with the others. Nowadays, a
   new integrated One Health approach is reflecting this interdependence
   with a holistic view to the ecological system. The One Health approach
   can be defined as a collaborative and a multidisciplinary effort at
   local, national and global level to guarantee an optimal healthy status
   for humans, animals and environment. Strictly related to the One Health
   concept is to be considered the control of infectious diseases, which
   have influenced the course of human history. Four different components
   might be identified as key elements within the One World - One Health'
   (OWOH) approach: the geographical component, the ecological one, the

Abstract = {The virulence of bacteria can be evaluated through both phenotypic and
   molecular assays. We applied these techniques to 114 strains of
   Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica collected from July 2010 to June
   2012. Salmonella strains were of human origin (71/114) or isolated from
   food (43/114). The strain set included only the three predominant
   Salmonella serovars isolated in Italy from humans (S. Enteritidis, S.
   Typhimurium, S. 4,{[}5],12:i:-). These strains were screened via
   polymerase chain reaction for 12 virulence factors (gipA, gtgB, sopE,
   sspH1, sspH2, sodC1, gtgE, spvC, pefA, mig5, rck, srgA), while
   antimicrobial sensitivity was evaluated through the Kirby-Bauer assay.
   Fifty-nine different virulence profiles were highlighted; the genes
   showing the highest homology were those related to the presence of
   prophages (gipA, gtgB, sopE, sspH1, sspH2, sodC1, gtgE), while the genes
   related to the presence of plasmids were less frequently detected (spvC,
   pefA, mig5, rck, srgA). The Salmonella serovars Typhimurium and
   4,{[}5],12:i:- were closely related in terms of both virulotyping and
   antibiotic resistance. S. Enteritidis showed higher antibiotic
   sensitivity and a higher prevalence of genes related to plasmids.},

Abstract = {This preliminary study aimed at assessing whether the in vitro
   proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to
   lipopolysaccharide permits individual characterization of periparturient
   dairy cows, and whether this parameter may be associated with incidence
   of infections and with some of the single nucleotide polymorphisms
   located on the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) gene. Based on the average
   response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to lipopolysaccharide
   over 7 time points during the transition period, 31 cows were
   categorized as low (LO), medium (MED), and high (HI) responders. This
   categorization identified 7 HI, 19 MED, and 5 LO cows, respectively.
   Genomic DNA was genotyped for P-226 C>G and E3+2021 C>T TLR4 single
   nucleotide polymorphisms. Monitoring of the health status revealed that
   8 of the 31 cows suffered from clinical mastitis, metritis, or
   interdigital dermatitis during the first 60 d in milk. The association
   study pointed out that none of the HI cows and all of the LO cows
   developed an infection; cows with the CCGT haplotype remained healthy
   and none of them belonged to the LO responder category.},

Abstract = {West Nile virus (WNV) and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) represent an
   important group of viral agents responsible for vector-borne zoonotic
   diseases constituting an emerging sanitary threat for the Mediterranean
   Basin and the neighbouring countries. WNV infection is present in
   several Mediterranean countries, whereas RVF has never been introduced
   into Europe, but it is considered a major threat for North African
   countries. Being vector-borne diseases, they cannot be prevented only
   through an animal trade control policy. Several approaches are used for
   the surveillance of WNV and RVFV. With the aim of assessing the
   surveillance systems in place in Mediterranean countries, two
   disease-specific questionnaires (WNV, RVFV) have been prepared and
   submitted to Public Health and Veterinary Authorities of six EU
   countries. This study presents the information gathered through the
   questionnaires and describes some critical points in the prevention and
   surveillance of these diseases as emerged by the answers received.},

Abstract = {This work illustrates how a well-optimized gas chromatograph-electron
   capture detector method represents an economical and satisfactory
   analytical choice for the routine determination of polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs) of US Environmental Protection Agency concern in fish
   and seafood. A dramatic and never observed dependence of the recovery
   efficiency of PCB congeners on the temperature of activation of the
   sorbent phase prompted us to optimize both the key steps (extraction and
   cleanup) of the analytical procedure. Very high performance levels in
   terms of the limit of detection (less than 0.64 ng g(-1)) and precision
   {[}better than 15 \% for unspiked and spiked samples of gilt-head bream,
   Sparus aurata, and better than 20 \% for certified reference material
   BCR 350 (mackerel oil)] were obtained. The acceptability of accuracy
   data was successfully evaluated according to the Association of Official
   Analytical Chemists' guidelines. The method was tested by analyzing ten
   samples of aquacultured gilt-head bream from Greece and Italy. The total
   of 18 PCBs measured for each sample ranged from 120.1 to 335.5 ng g(-1)
   (average value 180.7 ng g(-1)) on a fat weight basis.},

Abstract = {The results of a study designed to evaluate the performance of an
   in-clinic test for the detection of canine parvovirus (CPV) are
   reported. A total of 150 faecal samples collected from dogs with acute
   diarrhoea were tested using the in-clinic test, a haemagglutination
   assay (HA) and a real-time PCR assay for CPV detection, quantification
   and characterisation.
   CPV was detected in 66, 73, and 101 faecal samples by in-clinic, HA and
   PCR testing, respectively. The relative sensitivity and specificity of
   the in-clinic test were 86.3\% and 96.1\%, respectively, when the test
   was compared to HA, and 65.3\% and 100\%, respectively, when compared to
   real-time PCR. The sample distribution according to the virus type was
   CPV-2a, n = 44; CPV-2b, n = 11; CPV-2c, n= 44, CPV-2, n = 2, as
   determined by minor groove binder probe assays and/or sequence analysis.
   The percentage of positive in-clinic tests was 70.5\% for CPV-2a, 72.7\%
   for CPV-2b and 75.0\% for CPV-2c (P > 0.05). Using real-time PCR as the
   reference standard for CPV detection, the in-clinic test was more
   specific than HA and had comparable sensitivity to HA, demonstrating
   detection rates similar to those previously observed for other rapid
   in-clinic tests. The in-clinic test was also able to detect all CPV
   types at equivalent rates. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the pupal development times of the blow fly
   Calliphora vicina, which were studied in the laboratory at six different
   constant temperatures (15, 20, 23, 25, 28, and 30 degrees C each +/- 1
   degrees C). Lower thresholds (t(L)) for development were estimated from
   the linear regression of the developmental rates on each temperature.
   These data have made it possible to calculate the accumulated degree
   days (ADD) necessary for C.vicina to complete the larval stage and to
   achieve adult emergence. The minimal duration of development from
   oviposition to adult emergence was found to be inversely related to
   temperature. Additionally, six landmarks in pupal development are
   showed, and for each of the landmarks, the ADD value was calculated for
   every rearing temperature involved. These data assist in calculating the
   duration of the pupal stage based on morphological characteristics and
   would be of great value for future forensic entomological casework.},

Title = {Profiling microcystin contamination in a water reservoir by MALDI-TOF

Volume = {54},

Abstract = {High resolution mass spectrometry was employed to study a bloom of the
   Cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens in a dam for drinking water on
   Lake Occhito, near the town of Foggia, in Southern Italy, to
   characterise the cyanotoxins produced and to evaluate the related health
   risks for consumers.
   The cyanotoxin production in various sites of the contaminated dam was
   studied by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography coupled
   to Q/TOF tandem mass spectrometry analysis of water and cyanobacteria
   samples. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was employed for rapid screening
   over a wide mass range; liquid chromatography coupled to Q/TOF tandem
   mass spectrometry allowed for molecular structure confirmation of each
   single cyanotoxin. This analytical strategy allowed for profiling the
   cyanotoxins produced during the bloom and calculating the concentrations
   of the main contaminants in drinking water. Microcystins,
   anabaenopeptins and aeruginosins were the main cyanotoxins identified. A
   des-methyl variant of the microcystin-RR was recognised as the most
   abundant compound in all water samples; liquid chromatography coupled to
   Q/TOF tandem mass spectrometry allowed for molecular structural
   confirmation of detected substances, and quantitative analysis of
   microcystins. The contamination levels over 3 weeks were monitored, by
   sampling from different sites of the dam.
   This analytical strategy allows for complete characterisation of the
   cyanotoxins produced during this kind of environmental outbreaks, for
   time-dependent monitoring of pollution levels and thus represents a
   powerful tool to prevent intoxication for consumers of contaminated
   drinking water collected from the dam. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   were collected in one region. One hundred raw milk consumers in four
   regions were interviewed while purchasing raw milk from vending
   machines. One hundred seventy-eight of 60,907 samples were positive for
   one of the four foodborne pathogens investigated: 18 samples were
   positive for Salmonella, 83 for L. monocytogenes, 24 for E. coli O157:
   H7, and 53 for C. jejuni in the seven regions investigated. No
   significant differences in prevalence were found among regions, but a
   significant increase in C. jejuni prevalence was observed over the years
   of the study. A comparison of the two analysis methods revealed that
   real-time PCR was 2.71 to 9.40 times more sensitive than the
   culture-based method. Data on consumer habits revealed that some
   behaviors may enhance the risk of infection linked to raw milk
   consumption: 37\% of consumers did not boil milk before consumption,
   93\% never used an insulated bag to transport raw milk home, and raw
   milk was consumed by children younger than 5 years of age. These results
   emphasize that end-product controls alone are not sufficient to
   guarantee an adequate level of consumer protection. The beta
   distribution of positive samples in this study and the data on raw milk
   consumer habits will be useful for the development of a national
   quantitative risk assessment of Salmonella, L. monocytogenes, E. coli
   O157, and C. jejuni infection associated with raw milk consumption.},

Title = {Free-roaming dog populations: A cost-benefit model for different
   management options, applied to Abruzzo, Italy},
Journal = {PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {112},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {401-413},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Since 1991, Italian free-roaming dogs have been under government
   protection and euthanasia is restricted by law. Management measures are
   regulated at the regional level and include: kennelling, adoptions,
   conversion of stray dogs into block dogs, and population control of
   owned dogs. ``Block dogs{''} are free-roaming dogs that have been
   collected by the veterinary services, microchipped, sterilised,
   vaccinated, and released under the responsibility of the local
   municipalities. The present paper describes a cost-benefit model for
   different management options and applies it to two provinces in Abruzzo,
   central Italy. The model considers welfare, nuisance and direct costs to
   the municipality. Welfare is quantified based on the expert opinions of
   60 local veterinarians, who were asked to assign a score for each dog
   category according to the five freedoms: freedom from pain, physical
   discomfort, disease, fear, and freedom to express normal behaviour.
   Nuisance was assessed only for comparisons between management options,
   using the number of free-roaming dogs per inhabitant as a proxy
   indicator.
   A community dog population model was constructed to predict the effect
   of management on the different subpopulations of dogs during a ten-year
   period. It is a user-friendly deterministic model in Excel, easily
   adaptable to different communities to assess the impact of their dog
   management policy on welfare, nuisance and direct monetary cost.
   We present results for Teramo and Pescara provinces. Today's management
   system is compared to alternative models, which evaluate the effect of
   specific interventions. These include either a 10\% yearly increase in
   kennel capacity, an increase in adoptions from kennels, a doubling of
   the capture of stray dogs, or a stabilisation of the owned dog
   population.
   Results indicate that optimal management decisions are complex because
   welfare, nuisance and monetary costs may imply conflicting
   interventions. Nevertheless, they clearly indicate that management
   actions that would act on dog ownership patterns to reduce the number of
   free-roaming dogs would have the most favourable outcomes. These include
   reducing the reproductive capacity of the owned dog population, stronger
   enforcement of mandatory dog identification, reducing abandonment and
   increasing adoptions. This would increase welfare and free resources for
   implementing public campaigns. Block dogs may be an important
   intermediary means to reduce stray dogs, but adoption would be
   preferable. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Can landscape metrics help determine the Culicoides imicola distribution

Journal = {GEOSPATIAL HEALTH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},

Pages = {267-277},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Culicoides imicola is considered to be one of the main vectors of
   bluetongue disease in the Mediterranean Basin. However, local variations
   occur. For example, in Italy, C. imicola is a stable and abundant
   population in Sardinia and is widely distributed across the island,
   whilst in Tuscany on the Italian mainland, it ranges from low abundance
   in the west and coastal areas to absence in the eastern part of the
   region. Entomological surveillance data collected over 10 years were
   used to classify 52 sites as low to medium or high C. imicola abundance
   in Sardinia, and 59 sites as either positive or negative in Tuscany. The
   land cover was mapped from high-resolution remote sensing images using
   an object-based image analysis approach and a set of landscape metrics
   with 500 m buffers around each site. Multivariate analysis was used to
   test the statistical association of landscape metrics to C. imicola
   presence and abundance together with other eco-climatic and topographic
   variables. In Sardinia, 75\% of the sites were correctly classified
   based on altitude alone and the inclusion of landscape-related variables
   did not improve the classification. In Tuscany, the mean annual
   temperature allowed classifying 70\% of the positive/negative sites
   correctly. When landscape metrics was included in the multivariate
   model, an improvement up to 80\% was obtained. The presence of riparian
   vegetation and water was found to be positively correlated with C.
   imicola presence, whilst forest (including the edge between the forest
   and cultivated areas) was found to be negatively related to the presence
   of C. imicola.},

Abstract = {Little information is available regarding the role of natural killer T
   (NKT) cells during the early stage of Rickettsia conorii infection.
   Herein, C3H/HeN mice were infected with the Malish 7 strain of

   of the infection by flow cytometry and compared with uninfected
   controls. Our results showed an increase in NKT cells in infected mice.
   Additionally, NKT interleukin (IL)-17(+) cells increased three days
   after infection, together with a concurrent decrease in the relative
   amount of NKT interferon (IFN)-(+) cells. We also confirmed a higher
   amount of NK IFN-(+) cells in infected mice. Taken together, our data
   showed that NKT cells producing Il-17 increased during the early stage
   of rickettsial infection. These results suggest a connection between
   IL-17(+) NKT cells and vasculitis, which is the main clinical symptom of
   rickettsiosis.},

Abstract = {Bats are natural reservoirs for many mammalian coronaviruses, which have
   received renewed interest after the discovery of the severe acute
   respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome
   (MERS) CoV in humans. This study describes the identification and
   molecular characterization of alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses
   in bats in Italy, from 2010 to 2012. Sixty-nine faecal samples and 126
   carcasses were tested using pan-coronavirus RT-PCR. Coronavirus RNAs
   were detected in seven faecal samples and nine carcasses. A phylogenetic
   analysis of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence fragments aided in
   identifying two alphacoronaviruses from Kuhl's pipistrelle (Pipistrellus
   kuhlii), three clade 2b betacoronaviruses from lesser horseshoe bats
   (Rhinolophus hipposideros), and 10 clade 2c betacoronaviruses from
   Kuhl's pipistrelle, common noctule (Nyctalus noctula), and Savi's
   pipistrelle (Hypsugo savii). This study fills a substantive gap in the
   knowledge on bat-CoV ecology in Italy, and extends the current knowledge
   on clade 2c betacoronaviruses with new sequences obtained from bats that
   have not been previously described as hosts of these viruses.},

Title = {Use of milk amyloid A in the diagnosis of subclinical mastitis in dairy
   ewes},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {80},

Abstract = {Subclinical mastitis (SM) is one of the most important diseases
   affecting dairy ewes worldwide, with negative impact on the animal
   health, farm income and public health. Animals with SM often remain
   untreated because the disease may not be revealed. Increase in somatic
   cell count (SCC) and positive bacteriology for mastitis pathogens in
   milk samples are indicative of SM but the evidence of only one of these
   alterations must suggest an uncertain SM (UM). UM is defined when
   positive bacteriological examination (Latent-SM) or SCC>500 000 cells/ml
   (non-specific-SM) are detected in milk. Nevertheless, SCC and
   bacteriological examination are expensive, time consuming and are not
   yet in use at the farm level in dairy ewes. Recently, a sensitive acute
   phase protein, amyloid A, displaying multiple isoforms in plasma and
   different body fluids including mammary secretion (milk amyloid A-MAA),
   has been investigated as a marker of mastitis in cows and, in a few
   studies, in sheep. The aim of this trial was to compare the
   concentration of MAA of single udder-halves in ewes with healthy
   udder-halves (HU-control group) and naturally occurring subclinical
   mastitis, both confirmed (SM group) and uncertain (UM groups: Latent-SM
   and non-specific-SM), for monitoring udder health. The reliability of a
   specific ELISA kit for the measurement of MAA was also tested. During a
   3-month trial period, 153 udder halves were assigned to the experimental
   groups based on their health status: 25 with SM, 40 with UM (11 with
   latent-SM and 29 with non-specific-SM) and 88 HU. SCC and
   bacteriological analysis were performed to establish the control and
   subclinical mastitis groups. MAA concentrations in milk samples were
   measured using a specific commercially milk ELISA kit. The data were
   submitted to statistical analysis. Significant (P<0.05) differences
   among the groups SM, non-specific-SM and HU were detected with the SM
   having the highest level and HU the lowest. MAA concentration is
   affected by the udder health status and is a useful indicator of
   subclinical mastitis and increased SCC in sheep.},

Title = {Development and Validation of a Multiresidue Liquid
   Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry Method for 11 Coccidiostats in

Abstract = {A confirmatory method for the determination of 11 regulated
   coccidiostats including the ionophore antibiotics lasalocid,
   maduramicin, monensin, narasin, salinomycin, and semduramicin and the
   chemical coccidiostats decoquinate, diclazuril, halofuginone,
   nicarbazin, and robenidine in animal feed was developed and validated.
   The procedure was intended for the identification and quantification of
   the coccidiostats at concentrations relating both to the unintentional
   carryover as stated in Regulation 57412011 and to the authorized levels
   in target feed. The analytes were determined by LC/MS/MS in the positive
   or negative electrospray ionization mode. The method performance
   characteristics were estimated in the relevant application field from
   0.003 to 200 mg/kg. Validation criteria of linearity, specificity,
   trueness, precision, LOD, and LOQ along with measurement uncertainty
   were estimated for all analytes. Absolute and relative matrix effects
   were also studied. The results proved that the method performance was
   satisfactory, and it was successfully applied to carryover control by
   analyzing 165 feed samples collected within regulatory monitoring plans.
   Finally, since the carryover phenomenon in feed may result in the
   presence of residues in food products of animal origin, a survey has
   been carried out on the occurrence of coccidiostats in 167 eggs and
   animal muscles.},

Abstract = {A selective and highly sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass
   spectrometry method has been developed and validated for determination
   of Bisphenol A (BPA) in human urine using labeled d(6)-BPA as internal
   standard. BPA was purified from human urine by affinity chromatography
   on solid extraction AFFINIMIPA (R) Bisphenol A cartridges, based on
   molecularly imprinted polymers. After purification, the samples were
   analyzed on a Phenomenex Kinetex 100 x 4.6 mm, 2.6 mu m particle PFP
   reversed-phase HPLC column, coupled to a triple quadrupole mass
   spectrometer by an electrospray ion source. Analyses were performed in
   the multiple reaction monitoring mode and negative ionization; the
   product ions at 133.2 and 212.1 m/z for BPA and at 138.2 and 215.0 m/z
   for d(6)-BPA were monitored to assess unambiguous identification. The
   linearity of the detector response was verified in human urine over the
   concentration range 0.100-200 ng/mL. The detection limit was calculated
   as 0.03 ng/mL and the limit of quantification of the method is 0.10
   ng/mL. This LC/ESI-MS/MS method was in-house validated evaluating
   specificity, trueness, within-day and between-days precision. The mean
   recoveries of BPA from spiked urine samples were higher than 94 \% and
   good reproducibility (relative standard deviations a parts per thousand
   currency signaEuro parts per thousand 8.1 \%) was observed. The
   developed method was applied to a pilot study involving 105 children,
   aged from 6 to 14 years (16 normal weight and 89 obese children), from
   the Regione Campania (Southern Italy). The aim of this study was to
   determine the concentrations of BPA in urine of children and possible
   correlations with childhood obesity.},

Abstract = {Mosquito-borne arboviruses (MBV) represent an important health problem,
   causing diseases and deaths both in human and animals mainly in tropical
   and subtropical countries. In recent years, they have emerged also in
   temperate regions where they have caused epidemics. Of mounting concern
   among public health authorities in Europe are zoonotic mosquito-borne
   viruses belonging to the Flavivirus genus. The aim of this study was to
   carry out active surveillance on mosquitoes in two regions of
   northwestern Italy (Liguria and Piedmont) to gain a better knowledge of
   the mosquito populations by identifying potential vectors of arboviruses
   and to investigate arbovirus infection. A network of 61 CO2 CDC traps
   was placed in the study area; sampling was conducted from May to October
   2011. A total of 46677 mosquitoes was collected, identified to species
   level, and classified according to their vector competence. Mosquitoes
   collected from 16 traps, selected according to risk-based factors, were
   tested by biomolecular analysis to detect flavivirus infection. This
   study highlights the importance of entomological surveillance in
   northwestern Italy because most of the mosquitoes collected were found
   to have high vector competence. Moreover, the risk-based virological
   surveillance allowed to detect the presence of mosquito flavivirus RNA,
   phylogenetically closely related to the MMV Spanish isolate, in three
   pools and USUV RNA in one pool in new areas where it has not been
   reported previously. The availability of continuous data on mosquito
   populations provides invaluable information for use in cases of an
   epidemic emergency. Maintenance of this integrated system for the next
   years will provide stronger data that can inform the design of a
   risk-based surveillance for the early detection of the occurrence of
   outbreaks of tropical MBDs.},

Abstract = {Anaplasma species are obligate intracellular rickettsial pathogens
   transmitted by ticks with an impact on human and animal health.
   Anaplasma ovis infects sheep and goats in many regions of the world, and
   it can be diagnosed by different methods like Giemsa staining, PCR or
   competitive ELISA. In this study, a PCR based on the gene coding for
   major surface protein 4 (MSP-4) was used to examine field samples
   collected from sheep in different countries. Altogether, 1161 blood
   samples from Turkey (n=830), Iraq (n=195), Sudan (n=96) and Portugal
   (n=40) were examined, of which 31.4\%, 66.6\% 41.6\% and 82.5\%,
   respectively, were positive. This indicates high prevalence of A.ovis in
   the countries under investigation, and it can be assumed that the
   situation in other areas of the world might be similar. Thus, A.ovis
   should be considered as an important constraint of livestock production,
   and further efforts are needed to better understand the epidemiology and
   to implement suitable control measures.},

Abstract = {Background: The Caserta and Naples areas in Campania Region experience
   heavy environmental contamination due to illegal waste disposal and
   burns, thus representing a valuable setting to develop a general model
   of human contamination with dioxins (PCDDs-PCDFs) and dioxin-like-PCBs
   (dl-PCBs). Methods: 94 breastfeeding women (aged 19-32 years; mean age
   27.9 +/- 3.0) were recruited to determine concentrations of PCDDs-PCDFs
   and dl-PCBs in their milk. Individual milk samples were collected and
   analyzed according to standard international procedures. A generalized
   linear model was used to test potential predictors of pollutant
   concentration in breast milk: age, exposure to waste fires, cigarette
   smoking, diet, and residence in high/low risk area (defined at high/low
   environmental pressure by a specific 2007 WHO report). A Structural
   Equation Model (SEM) analysis was carried out by taking into account
   PCDDs-PCDFs and dl-PCBs as endogenous variables and age, waste fires,
   risk area and smoking as exogenous variables. Results: All milk samples
   were contaminated by PCDDs-PCDFs (8.6 pg WHO-TEQ/98g fat +/- 2.7; range
   3.8-19) and dl-PCBs (8.0 pg WHO-TEQ/98g fat +/- 3.7; range 2.5-24), with
   their concentrations being associated with age and exposure to waste
   fires (p < 0.01). Exposure to fires resulted in larger increases of
   dioxins concentrations in people living in low risk areas than those
   from high risk areas (p < 0.01). Conclusions: A diffuse human exposure
   to persistent organic pollutants was observed in the Caserta and Naples
   areas. Dioxins concentration in women living in areas classified at low
   environmental pressure in 2007 WHO report was significantly influenced
   by exposure to burns.},

Abstract = {Isolate wigeon/Italy/3920-1/2005 (3920-1) was obtained during
   surveillance of wild birds in November 2005 in the Rovigo province of
   Northern Italy and shown to be a paramyxovirus. Analysis of
   cross-haemagglutination-inhibition tests between 3920-1 and
   representative avian paramyxoviruses showed only a low-level
   relationship to APMV-1. Phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome and
   each of the six genes indicated that while 3920-1 grouped with APMV-1
   and APMV-9 viruses, it was quite distinct from these two. In the
   whole-genome analysis, 3920-1 had 52.1 \% nucleotide sequence identity
   to the closest APMV-1 virus, 50.1 \% identity to the APMV-9 genome, and
   less than 42 \% identity to representatives of the other avian
   paramyxovirus groups. We propose isolate wigeon/Italy/3920-1/2005 as the
   prototype strain of a further APMV group, APMV-12.},

Abstract = {Fleas (Insecta: Siphonaptera) are obligate bloodsucking insects, which
   parasitize birds and mammals, and are distributed throughout the world.
   Several species have been implicated in pathogen transmission. This
   study aimed to monitor red foxes and the fleas isolated from them in the
   Palermo and Ragusa provinces of Sicily, Italy, as these organisms are
   potential reservoirs and vectors of pathogens. Thirteen foxes (Vulpes
   vulpes) and 110 fleas were analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
   to detect DNA of the pathogens Ehrlichia canis, Babesia microti,
   Rickettsia spp., Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Anaplasma platys, Anaplasma
   marginale and Anaplasma ovis. In the foxes, A.ovis was detected in only
   one animal, whereas the prevalence of the E.canis pathogen was 31\%.
   B.microti and Rickettsia spp. were not detected. Of all of the collected
   fleas, 75 belonged to the species Xenopsylla cheopis, 32 belonged to
   Ctenocephalides canis, two belonged to Ctenocephalides felis and one
   belonged to Cediopsylla inaequalis. In the fleas, the following
   pathogens were found: A.ovis (prevalence 25\%), A.marginale (1\%),
   A.phagocytophilum (1\%), Rickettsia felis (2\%) and E.canis (3\%).
   X.cheopis was the flea species most frequently infected with Anaplasma,
   in particular A.ovis (33\%), A.marginale (1\%) and A.phagocytophilum
   (1\%). Both C.felis exemplars were positive for R.felis. E.canis was
   found in the lone C.inaequalis and also in 3\% of the X.cheopis
   specimens. No fleas were positive for B.microti or A.platys. As foxes
   often live in proximity to domestic areas, they may constitute potential
   reservoirs for human and animal parasites. Further studies should be
   performed on fleas to determine their vectorial capacity.},

Abstract = {Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a severe mosquito-borne disease that is
   caused by a Phlebovirus (Bunyaviridae) and affects domestic ruminants
   and humans. Recently, its distribution widened, threatening Europe. The
   probability of the introduction and large-scale spread of Rift Valley
   fever virus (RVFV) in Europe is low, but localized RVF outbreaks may
   occur in areas where populations of ruminants and potential vectors are
   present. In this study, we assumed the introduction of the virus into
   Italy and focused on the risk of vector-borne transmission of RVFV to
   three main European potential hosts (cattle, sheep and goats). Five main
   potential mosquito vectors belonging to the Culex and Aedes genera that
   are present in Italy were identified in a literature review. We first
   modelled the geographical distribution of these five species based on
   expert knowledge and using land cover as a proxy of mosquito presence.
   The mosquito distribution maps were compared with field mosquito
   collections from Italy to validate the model. Next, the risk of RVFV
   transmission was modelled using a multicriteria evaluation (MCE)
   approach, integrating expert knowledge and the results of a literature
   review on host sensitivity and vector competence, feeding behaviour and
   abundance. A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness
   of the results with respect to expert choices. The resulting maps
   include (i) five maps of the vector distribution, (ii) a map of suitable
   areas for vector-borne transmission of RVFV and (iii) a map of the risk
   of RVFV vector-borne transmission to sensitive hosts given a viral
   introduction. Good agreement was found between the modelled presence
   probability and the observed presence or absence of each vector species.
   The resulting RVF risk map highlighted strong spatial heterogeneity and
   could be used to target surveillance. In conclusion, the geographical
   information system (GIS)-based MCE served as a valuable framework and a
   flexible tool for mapping the areas at risk of a pathogen that is
   currently absent from a region.},

Abstract = {Growth, weight at birth and daily weight gain (DWG) on 12 water buffalo
   calves, starting from 6 days of age until completion of weaning, was
   investigated in this study. Different feeding regimens were given to two
   groups of animals with regard to daily milk replacer: (1) group 1 (G1)
   received a double concentration in single administration; whereas (2)
   group 2 (G2) received the same amount of milk replacer split twice
   daily. Blood samples were collected from each calf on days 6, 30, 60 and
   90 to evaluate acute phase proteins (haptoglobin), bactericide activity,
   lysozime, total protein content and biochemical parameters. No
   differences were observed between the two groups in terms of dry matter
   intake, feed efficiency and live body weight at the end of the study.
   Interestingly, a significantly (P < 0.05) reduced DWG was observed
   earlier in G1 (day 45) than in G2 (day 60). Gastrointestinal disorders
   were not recorded throughout the experimental period, and no significant
   differences were recorded between the two groups for all considered
   parameters. This study confirms the possibility of utilising one daily
   administration of milk replacer in water buffalo calf during weaning.
   This new approach facilitates calves management, without interfering
   with calves growing performances.},

Title = {New Strategies to Prolong the In Vivo Life Span of Iron-Based Contrast
   Agents for MRI},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) and ultra small superparamagnetic
   iron oxide (USPIO) nanoparticles have been developed as magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents. Iron oxide nanoparticles, that
   become superparamagnetic if the core particle diameter is (similar to)
   30nm or less, present R1 and R2 relaxivities which are much higher than
   those of conventional paramagnetic gadolinium chelates. Generally, these
   magnetic particles are coated with biocompatible polymers that prevent
   the agglomeration of the colloidal suspension and improve their blood
   distribution profile. In spite of their potential as MRI blood contrast
   agents, the biomedical application of iron oxide nanoparticles is still
   limited because of their intravascular half-life of only few hours; such
   nanoparticles are rapidly cleared from the bloodstream by macrophages of
   the reticulo-endothelial system (RES). To increase the life span of
   these MRI contrast agents in the bloodstream we proposed the
   encapsulation of SPIO nanoparticles in red blood cells (RBCs) through
   the transient opening of cell membrane pores. We have recently reported
   results obtained by applying our loading procedure to several SPIO
   nanoparticles with different chemical physical characteristics such as
   size and coating agent. In the current investigation we showed that the
   life span of iron-based contrast agents in the mice bloodstream was
   prolonged to 12 days after the intravenous injection of murine
   SPIO-loaded RBCs. Furthermore, we developed an animal model that
   implicates the pretreatment of animals with clodronate to induce a
   transient suppression of tissue macrophages, followed by the injection
   of human SPIO-loaded RBCs which make it possible to encapsulate
   nanoparticle concentrations (5.3-16.7mM Fe) higher than murine
   SPIO-loaded RBCs (1.4-3.55mM Fe). The data showed that, when human RBCs
   are used as more capable SPIO nanoparticle containers combined with a
   depletion of tissue macrophages, Fe concentration in animal blood is 2-3
   times higher than iron concentration obtained by the use of murine
   SPIO-loaded RBCs.},

Abstract = {The current avian influenza epidemic in Egypt caused by circulation of
   genetically and antigenically diverse H5N1 HPAI viruses in poultry is
   controlled by applying vaccination among other measures. In this
   context, the use of a DIVA (differentiating infected from vaccinated
   animals) vaccination strategy utilizing a vaccine capable of inducing
   protection against multiple antigenic variants may result as an
   additional control tool to the existing ones. In this study the efficacy
   of a single-shot recombinant baculovirus-based vaccine in
   specific-pathogen-free chickens was tested by experimental challenge
   with genetically and antigenically diverse H5N1 HPAI viruses belonging
   to clades 2.2.1 and 2.2.1.1, which have been circulating in Egypt since
   2010. A single dose of vaccine, administration at 10 days of age, was
   shown to confer 100\% clinical protection, with a decrease or
   suppression of virus shedding. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The massive introduction of nitrogen fertilisers, necessary to maximise
   the global food production, has brought about an increase of the
   residual amounts of nitrites and nitrates in the products. Notoriously,
   these compounds may exercise toxic effects.
   In this work the results obtained from 5 years of official controls and
   monitoring focused on tracing quantifiable amounts of nitrites and
   nitrates in 1785 samples of meat, dairy, fish products and leafy
   vegetables are reported.
   A widespread presence of nitrates at low concentrations in foodstuffs
   was verified. High concentrations of nitrates were registered in some
   leafy vegetables and mussels samples, while high nitrites concentrations
   were registered in some spinach samples.
   The results confirmed the necessity to develop most controls and suggest
   the introduction of new legal limits related to some combinations
   contaminant/matrix. Such new limits may fill legislative gaps that may
   cause wrong interpretations of the results obtained during official
   controls. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The wedge clam Donax trunculus Linnaeus, 1758 is one of the most common
   bivalve molluscs inhabiting the sandy shores of the Mediterranean Sea
   and is considered an important commercial resource. In this study, we
   report the first molecular, morphological and histopathological
   descriptions of metacercariae from a trematode belonging to the genus
   Postmonorchis (Digenea: Monorchiidae) that infects D. trunculus in
   natural beds of the Italian Tyrrhenian coast (Campania, Lazio and
   Tuscany). Morphological analysis of the parasite revealed a combination
   of features that exist in the 3 previously identified species of
   Postmonorchis, viz. P. donacis, P. variabilis and P. orthopristis, with
   the addition of new, distinctive morphological characteristics. The
   pathogen exhibited a predilection for the gill; however, it was also
   present in the labial palp and mantle in addition to the gut, kidney
   epithelium and foot. The inflammatory response was characterised by
   either a focal or diffuse haemocyte infiltration followed by the
   formation of multiple, large multi-layered capsules associated with
   tissue destruction. The prevalence of the pathogen ranged from 75 to
   100\%, while the infection intensity fluctuated among the study areas.
   Further studies regarding the life cycle of this parasite and the
   identification of other larval and adult stages and their respective
   hosts may confirm the identification of a new species of Postmonorchis
   that infects wedge clams in Mediterranean waters. The study of the
   parasite is completed by molecular analysis of the ITS1 and ITS2 rDNA
   sequences.},

Abstract = {Constitutive activation of the canonical and noncanonical nuclear
   factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) pathways is frequent in multiple myeloma
   (MM) and can compromise sensitivity to TRAIL. In this study, we
   demonstrate that Aurora kinases physically and functionally interact
   with the key regulators of canonical and noncanonical NF-kappa B
   pathways I kappa B kinase beta (IKK beta) and IKK alpha to activate
   NF-kappa B in MM, and the pharmacological blockade of Aurora kinase
   activity induces TRAIL sensitization in MM because it abrogates
   TRAIL-induced activation of NF-kappa B. We specifically found that TRAIL
   induces prosurvival signaling by increasing the phosphorylation state of
   both Aurora and IKK kinases and their physical interactions, and the
   blockade of Aurora kinase activity by pan-Aurora kinase inhibitors
   (pan-AKIs) disrupts TRAIL-induced survival signaling by effectively
   reducing Aurora-IKK kinase interactions and NF-kappa B activation.
   Pan-AKIs consistently blocked TRAIL induction of the antiapoptotic
   NF-kappa B target genes A1/Bfl-1 and/or Mcl-1, both important targets
   for TRAIL sensitization in MM cells. In summary, these results identify
   a novel interaction between Aurora and IKK kinases and show that these
   pathways can cooperate to promote TRAIL resistance. Finally, combining
   pan-AKIs with TRAIL in vivo showed dramatic efficacy in a
   multidrug-resistant human myeloma xenograft model. These findings
   suggest that combining Aurora kinase inhibitors with TRAIL may have
   therapeutic benefit in MM.},

Title = {Distribution and habitat characterization of the recently introduced
   invasive mosquito Aedes koreicus {[}Hulecoeteomyia koreica], a new
   potential vector and pest in north-eastern Italy},

Abstract = {Background: The container breeding species belonging to the genus Aedes
   (Meigen) are frequently recorded out of their place of origin. Invasive
   Aedes species are proven or potential vectors of important Arboviruses
   and their establishment in new areas pose a threat for human and animal
   health. A new species of exotic mosquito was recorded in 2011 in
   north-eastern Italy: Aedes (Finlaya) koreicus {[}Hulecoeteomyia
   koreica]. The aim of this study was to characterize the biology, the
   environment and the current distribution of this mosquito in
   north-eastern Italy. Morphological details useful to discriminate this
   species from other invasive Aedes mosquitoes are also given (see
   Additional files).
   Methods: All possible breeding sites for larval development were
   monitored. In addition, ovitraps and traps for adults were used to
   collect eggs and adults. The mosquitoes (larvae and adults) were
   identified morphologically and molecularly. Environmental data and
   climatic variables during the period of mosquito activity (from April to
   October) were considered.
   Results: Aedes koreicus was found in 37 municipalities (39.4\%) and was
   detected in 40.2\% of places and in 37.3\% of larval habitats monitored,
   in a range of altitude from 173 to 1250 m.a.s.l.. Garden centres were
   the most common locations (66.7\%), followed by streets/squares
   (57.1\%), private gardens (46.4\%) and cemeteries (21.1\%) (p < 0.01).
   The main larval habitats were catch basins (48.5\%) and artificial water
   containers (41.8\%). As for Aedes albopictus {[}Stegomyia albopicta],
   ovitraps were attractive for adult females resulting in the higher rate
   of positivity (15/21; 71.4\%) among breeding sites. The period of Ae.
   koreicus activity ranged from March 29 to October 29.
   Conclusion: The species is clearly established in the area and is now
   overlapping with other vectors such as Ae. albopictus and colonizing
   areas over 800 m.a.s.l, not yet or sporadically reached by the tiger
   mosquito. The data collected are essential to assess the risk of
   colonization of other parts of Italy and Europe, as well as the risk of
   spreading of pathogens transmitted. These findings stress the importance
   of implementing entomological surveillance for early detection of
   invasive species, which is necessary for eradication or limitation of
   its further spread.},

Abstract = {Lagovirus is an emerging genus of Caliciviridae, which includes the
   Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV) of rabbits and the European
   brown hare syndrome virus (EBHSV) of hares that cause lethal hepatitis.
   In 2010, a new RHDV related virus (RHDV2) with a unique genetic and
   antigenic profile and lower virulence was identified in France in
   rabbits. Here we report the identification of RHDV2 as the cause in
   Sardinia of several outbreaks of acute hepatitis in rabbits and Cape
   hare (Lepus capensis mediterraneus). This is the first account of a
   lagovirus that causes fatal hepatitis in both rabbits and hares.},

Abstract = {Zoonotic infections with hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotype 3 are
   presumably transmitted via contaminated pig meat products, which raises
   the necessity for enhanced serological surveillance of pig herds. The
   aim of the study was to set up a novel protein expression system to
   overcome the well-known problems in (HEV-) protein expression using the
   standard Escherichia coli tools such as inclusion body formation and
   loss of protein conformation. A recombinant strain of the protozoan
   organism Leishmania tarentolae (L. tarentolae) was therefore
   established. A fragment of HEV ORF2 coding for a truncated capsid
   protein, of a porcine HEV strain was cloned and parts of the plasmid DNA
   were introduced into the Leishmania genome, resulting in stably
   transformed cells. Via a C-terminal His-tag the recombinant HEV Delta
   ORF2 protein could be purified and concentrated directly from the
   medium, resulting in a total protein amount of approximately 1.4 mg/l
   Leishmania culture. The recombinant protein was coated on ELISA plates
   and was proven to be highly reactive and well-suited to be applied in a
   serological assay. By investigating 144 porcine sera, the in-house assay
   detected specific antibodies in 43.1\% of the samples and demonstrated a
   higher sensitivity than a commercially available antibody test. Taken
   together, it was shown that L. tarentolae exhibits a remarkable
   alternative expression strategy for viral antigens with considerable
   advantages of a eukaryotic protein expression host. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {We report the first serological evidence of Usutu virus (USUV) infection
   in horses in Croatia. During 2011, 1380 horse serum samples from healthy
   animals were collected from six northern Croatian counties. All samples
   were first screened for West Nile virus (WNV) immunoglobulin G (IgG)
   antibodies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
   Sixty-nine WNV ELISA-reactive samples were further tested for WNV
   antibodies by a virus neutralization assay (VN assay) and plaque
   reduction neutralization test (PRNT), and USUV by a VN assay and
   tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) antibodies by PRNT. During the same
   period, 306 human serum samples from patients coming for routine testing
   with no symptoms of acute febrile disease were tested for USUV IgG using
   ELISA. Reactive samples were tested for both USUV and WNV using a VN
   assay. USUV-specific neutralizing antibodies were detected in two of 69
   WNV ELISA-reactive horse serum samples. Seropositive animals were found
   in two different regions of Croatia. One additional sample showed
   specific WNV-neutralizing antibodies that cross-neutralized USUV. Only
   one human sample (0.3\%) was reactive to USUV antibodies in an ELISA
   test. In a confirmatory test, WNV-neutralizing antibodies were detected,
   indicating cross-reactive antibodies with USUV in ELISA. The exposure to
   USUV was documented in two WNV ELISA-reactive horses at distant
   locations. These results indicate the presence of USUV in northern
   Croatia.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was the development of hatching protocols in
   controlled conditions to obtain juveniles, in order to restock and
   increase the resource of Sepia officinalis. The study was divided into
   the following phases: development and application of artificial surfaces
   at specific sites of the Molise coast in Italy; induction of eggs
   hatching and juveniles maintenance under controlled condition; juveniles
   introduction into specific sites and assessment their increment;
   experimental data elaboration. The obtained results concerned both the
   effectiveness of the artificial surfaces tasted during the study and the
   importance of the recovery of the eggs laid on artificial surfaces (
   artefacts and fishing gear) for preservation and the management of the
   Sepia officinalis resource. The induction tests conducted on eggs
   hatching under controlled conditions confirmed what described in the
   extant literature. Water salinity was detected as the only limiting
   factor, with values <= 20\% related to the absence of hatching. The
   described practices for harvesting and induction of hatching for the
   production of juvenile cuttlefish may be endorsed by the operators at
   relatively low cost and throughout the year, with obvious economic
   benefits.},

Abstract = {The transfer of passive immunity from sows to piglets is important and
   it is the first immune protection of the new born piglet. Improving sows
   immunity by adding immuno-stimulating product in sows diet can
   positively affect colostrum composition and transfer of immune molecules
   to piglets. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the benefit of a
   different solution, made of specific fatty acids from marine origin that
   have been used in human medicine for decades, for sows and piglets. Two
   trials were conducted in commercial farm, involving 240 sows at
   different periods of the year. Sows were divided in a control group,
   without supplementation, and a test group, supplemented with the feed
   additive from the 90th day of gestation to weaning. Sows body condition,
   piglets viability and growth were recorded. Milk immunoglobulin content
   was measured, as well as Aujeszky antibodies in sows and piglets blood
   as marker of specific immunity, and blood bactericidal activity,
   complement activity and lysozyme as markers of non specific immunity. No
   effect of the product was observed on piglets zootechnical criteria and
   specific immunity parameters but significant improvement of piglet non
   specific immunity, was observed. No difference was observed neither in
   the piglets blood PRRSV and PCV2 antibodies and viruses nor in Aujeszky
   antibodies. Blood complement activity seems to be an accurate indicator
   of immuno-stimulating additive efficiency. Giving alkyl-glycerol fatty
   acids to sows in late gestation and lactation can improve the passive
   immunity transfer to piglets.},

Abstract = {Synthetic dyes are added to food and drinks to restore their original
   appearance when color is affected by processing, storage, packaging and
   distribution. Furthermore colors are used to make food more visually
   attractive to consumers. The EU Directive 1994/36/CE lists the permitted
   substances that can be used in foodstuffs. In order to investigate the
   content of some permitted and non-permitted dyes in food and drinks, a
   sensitive and helpful method has been developed to determine
   simultaneously seventeen synthetic colorants by high-performance liquid
   chromatography coupled with a diode-array detector in solid food
   matrices and beverages. Substances involved were azorubine (E122),
   amaranth (E123), cochineal red A (E124), red 2G (E128), allura red
   (E129), azocarmine B (AZO B), azocarmine G (AZO G), ponceau 2R (P2R),
   ponceau 6R (P6R), tartrazine (E102), sunset yellow (E110), quinoline
   yellow (E104), orange II (OR H), metanil yellow (MY), patent blue V
   (E131), indigo carmine (E132) and brilliant blue FCF (E133). Solid food
   matrices were extracted by a water alcohol mixture, cleaned up on a
   polyamide SPE cartridge and eluted with basic methanol solution.
   Otherwise a simple dilution and filtration of samples were used for
   drinks. The method has been validated according to Regulation
   (2004/882/CE) and could be applied to a concentration range between 5
   and 300 mg kg(-1) (5-100 mg l(-1) for drinks) depending on the dye. The
   accuracy (precision and trueness) and specificity were assessed. During
   years 2009-2011 many food samples for the detection of synthetic
   colorants were analyzed. Most of them were fresh fishery products in
   which the use of food colorant is banned. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Practical experience on the use of injectable transponders in a flock of
   Ouessant sheep},
Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {19},

Pages = {219-223},

Abstract = {Introduction - According to the Reg. (EC) N. 1560/2000, electronic
   identification has become compulsory for sheep and goats born after
   31/12/2009 in all EU countries. The electronic identifiers include
   bolus, eartag, tag on the pastern and injectable transponder (TIP). The
   TIP may be a valid alternative to bolus or eartag in sheep or goat
   breeds of small size, even though any type of TIP hasn't been approved
   in Italy yet.
   Aim - This paper describes a practical experience conducted throughout 2
   years in a small flock of Ouessant sheep, in order to gather information
   useful for the authorization of this device.
   Materials and methods -The Ouessant rams reach 48-50 cm in height at
   withers and weigh 15-22 kg, the ewes are even smaller. At the beginning
   the herd consisted of 27 subjects of which 18 were ewes. In these
   animals, the black colour of the coat doesn't allow the tattoo and the
   ears are too small to apply the eartags authorized in Italy, therefore
   it was obtained the permission to use special aluminium eartags.
   The TIP used is 23 mm x 3.85 mm, 0.6g of weight, with an operating
   frequency of 134.2 kHz, memory capacity of 64 bits, reading distance up
   to 60 cm and average reading time of 70 ms.
   The electronic devices were initialized with the ID numbers generated by
   the National Data Base and the same numbers were printed on the eartags.
   The TIPs were applied to 6 adults and 35 animals born at the farm,
   ranging from 1 to 9 months of age, in the armpit, between the chest wall
   and the caudal muscles of the right arm. The permanence of the microchip
   was verified after 15 days, 6 months and 1 year from the application, by
   using a handheld reader.
   The recovery of the TIP at the slaughterhouse wasn't investigated
   because the animals were not intended to be slaughtered.
   Results and discussion -The experience confirmed that the injection in
   the armpit is easy to perform for the operator and doesn't appear to be
   painful for the animal. All animals needed a minimum containment and
   didn't react to the inoculation, the absence of wool and the low
   thickness of the skin facilitated the injection. After 15 days the TIP
   proved to be palpable in situ and readable in all subjects, there
   weren't any signs of inflammation or scarring reactions. After 6 and 12
   months no accidental breakage of the TIPs occurred and all TIPs were
   easily detected by the reader in the armpit. During the project two
   animals died, respectively at 12 and 17 months from the application of
   the TIP, which was found still in situ at the necropsy in both of them.
   Conclusion - The application of a TIP of 23 mm in the armpit fully met
   the requirements for the electronic identifiers, such as ease of use,
   non-invasiveness and safety, good readability, durability, absence of
   breakage or loss and permanence in situ. TIP may constitute the main
   identification device for dwarf goats and sheep, usually farmed as
   companion animals.},

Title = {Sylvatic rabies epidemic in Italy: implementation of a data management
   system to assess the level of application of preventive dog vaccination},
Journal = {PATHOGENS AND GLOBAL HEALTH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {107},

Abstract = {After 20 years of absence, rabies re-emerged in wild animals in
   north-eastern Italy in October 2008. Besides measures undertaken to
   fight the spread of infection in wildlife, vaccination against rabies
   was made compulsory for dogs living in the risk area. In the last 15
   years, the veterinary authorities have focused on implementing
   computerized data collection systems in animal health, to serve as
   working tools for epidemiological surveillance activities and
   emergencies management. The prerequisite for implementing any data
   collection system is knowledge of the animal population. This also
   applies to the Canine Registry Data Bank, in which data on dogs and
   their movements, together with personal data on each owner and keeper,
   have been stored since 2003. The management information system has been
   updated and specific functions have been integrated in order to support
   the activity of both the veterinary services and the veterinary
   practitioners involved in the dog vaccination program. Vaccination
   became voluntary in February 2013. This paper describes implementation
   of the software and organization of data gathering, highlighting the
   benefits of computerized data compared to previously used paper-based
   data collection systems. The new functions, designed to centralize
   collection of uniform, updated vaccination data, have led to more
   efficient organization and better control of the vaccination plan.
   Automated information processing allowed vaccination operations to be
   supervised, incurred costs to be calculated, and vaccination coverage of
   the dog population to be monitored during the 3 years of compulsory
   vaccination.},

Abstract = {Understanding the factors governing host species barriers to virus
   transmission has added significantly to our appreciation of virus
   pathogenesis. Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) is the causative agent
   of ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma (OPA), a transmissible lung cancer of
   sheep that has rarely been found in goats. In this study, in order to
   further clarify the pathogenesis of OPA, we investigated whether goats
   are resistant to JSRV replication and carcinogenesis. We found that JSRV
   induces lung tumors in goats with macroscopic and histopathological
   features that dramatically differ from those in sheep. However, the
   origins of the tumor cells in the two species are identical.
   Interestingly, in experimentally infected lambs and goat kids, we
   revealed major differences in the number of virus-infected cells at
   early stages of infection. These differences were not related to the
   number of available target cells for virus infection and cell
   transformation or the presence of a host-specific immune response toward
   JSRV. Indeed, we also found that goats possess transcriptionally active
   endogenous retroviruses (enJSRVs) that likely influence the host immune
   response toward the exogenous JSRV. Overall, these results suggest that
   goat cells, or at least those cells targeted for viral carcinogenesis,
   are not permissive to virus replication but can be transformed by JSRV.},

Title = {Investigation on the prevalence of BVDV-2 in dairy cattle herds of

Abstract = {The study was aimed at obtaining data regarding the prevalence of Bovine
   Viral Diarrhea Virus type 2 (BVDV-2) in dairy cattle population of the
   Po Valley, Northern Italy. The survey was carried out in the period
   2009-2011 and involved five diagnostic laboratories located in five
   provinces of Lombardia and Emilia Romagna regions, namely Brescia,
   Cremona, Lodi, Mantova e Parma. The area is characterized for a high
   density of bovine dairy herds, even large herds rearing animals with
   high genetic value. Despite of the lack of official control-eradication
   programmes by Authorities, the consciousness about BVD damages is
   widespread among practitioners and dairy farmers. Therefore, voluntary
   control-eradication programmes to BVDV are set up on herd level. The
   programmes, besides the vaccination practice, provided for detection and
   cull of persistently infected (PI) animals.
   Bulk milk, blood samples, aborted foetuses and specimens from organs of
   cattle died for suspected BVD were examined by PCR or real-time PCR to
   detect BVDV-1 and 2. In addition blood serum samples from BVDV
   unvaccinated herds were submitted to comparative serology through serum
   neutralization test (SN) to both the viral types. On the whole 4,464
   dairy herds were submitted to diagnostic investigation.
   Direct diagnostic tests (PCR or real-time PCR) allowed BVDV-2 to be
   detected in 2.9\% of the examined herds. Indirect diagnostic test
   (comparative SN) showed 4\% of the tested herds positive for BVDV-2
   infection. Sometimes both the viral types were present together in a
   single herd.
   Taken together our data pointed out that BVDV-2, introduced in Italy in
   1999 by a contaminated vaccine, at present circulates among the
   considered cattle population but the prevalence is low. So that BVDV-1
   must be considered the most relevant viral type circulating among the
   domestic dairy cattle population. This evidence is consistent with the
   epidemiological situation of other European Countries but in contrast
   with the US picture where BVDV-2 infection is widespread in dairy and
   beef cattle. The reason of this epidemiological disagreement is not yet
   elucidated.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to analyze a bank of 35 Mycoplasma
   mycoides subsp. capri (Mmc) isolates collected from contagious agalactia
   outbreaks during a 9-year period (2004-2012) in Sardinia, Italy.
   Isolates were characterized using genotyping and phenotyping methods.
   For each isolate, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) DNA profile
   was determined. The PFGE study, performed with the rare-cutting
   restriction enzyme Bull, showed a high degree of genetic heterogeneity.
   Our findings show the value of PFGE analysis for revealing the genetic
   diversity of isolates and its usefulness for epidemiology
   investigations. In addition, the whole cell protein profiles of each
   isolate were studied by Coomassie Blue-stained sodium dodecyl sulphate
   polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblot (IB). After
   IB with pooled serum from naturally infected goats, two immunogenic
   proteins of about 90 and 60 kDa were identified in all isolates
   analyzed. These proteins may have potential for the development of
   serological diagnostic tests. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Parthenolide generates reactive oxygen species and autophagy in
   MDA-MB231 cells. A soluble parthenolide analogue inhibits tumour growth
   and metastasis in a xenograft model of breast cancer},
Journal = {CELL DEATH \& DISEASE},

Abstract = {Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are clinically aggressive forms
   associated with a poor prognosis. We evaluated the cytotoxic effect
   exerted on triple-negative MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells both by
   parthenolide and its soluble analogue dimethylamino parthenolide (DMAPT)
   and explored the underlying molecular mechanism. The drugs induced a
   dose-and time-dependent decrement in cell viability, which was not
   prevented by the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. In particular in the first
   hours of treatment (1-3 h), parthenolide and DMAPT strongly stimulated
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The drugs induced production
   of superoxide anion by activating NADPH oxidase. ROS generation caused
   depletion of thiol groups and glutathione, activation of c-Jun
   N-terminal kinase (JNK) and downregulation of nuclear factor kB (NF-kB).
   During this first phase, parthenolide and DMAPT also stimulated
   autophagic process, as suggested by the enhanced expression of beclin-1,
   the conversion of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-I (LC3-I)
   to LC3-II and the increase in the number of cells positive to
   monodansylcadaverine. Finally, the drugs increased RIP-1 expression.
   This effect was accompanied by a decrement of pro-caspase 8, while its
   cleaved form was not detected and the expression of c-FLIPS markedly
   increased. Prolonging the treatment (5-20 h) ROS generation favoured
   dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential and the appearance of
   necrotic events, as suggested by the increased number of cells positive
   to propidium iodide staining. The administration of DMAPT in nude mice
   bearing xenografts of MDA-MB231 cells resulted in a significant
   inhibition of tumour growth, an increment of animal survival and a
   marked reduction of the lung area invaded by metastasis.
   Immunohistochemistry data revealed that treatment with DMAPT reduced the
   levels of NF-kB, metalloproteinase-2 and -9 and vascular endothelial
   growth factor, while induced upregulation of phosphorylated JNK. Taken
   together, our data suggest a possible use of parthenolide for the
   treatment of TNBCs.},

Abstract = {Brucellosis, one of the most important re-emerging zoonoses in many
   countries, is caused by bacteria belonging to the genus Brucella.
   Furthermore these bacteria represent potential biological warfare agents
   and the identification of species and biovars of field strains may be
   crucial for tracing back source of infection, allowing to discriminate
   naturally occurring outbreaks instead of bioterrorist events. In the
   last years, multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA)
   has been proposed as complement of the classical biotyping methods and
   it has been applied for genotyping large collections of Brucella spp. At
   present, the MLVA band profiles may be resolved by automated or manual
   procedures. The Lab on a chip technology represents a valid alternative
   to standard genotyping techniques (as agarose gel electrophoresis) and
   it has been previously used for Brucella genotyping. Recently, a new
   high-throughput genotyping analysis system based on capillary gel
   electrophoresis, the QIAxcel, has been described. The aim of the study
   was to evaluate the ability of two DNA sizing equipments, the QIAxcel
   System and the Lab chip GX, to correctly call alleles at the sixteen
   loci including one frequently used MLVA assay for Brucella genotyping.
   The results confirmed that these technologies represent a meaningful
   advancement in high-throughput Brucella genotyping. Considering the
   accuracy required to confidently resolve loci discrimination, QIAxcel
   shows a better ability to measure VNTR allele sizes compared to LabChip
   GX.},

Abstract = {Introduction and aim - This paper reports the results of microbiological
   analysis performed within the plan conducted against bovine mastitis in
   Aosta Valley Region during the period 2009-2011. The monitoring aimed at
   the detection of agents causing mammary gland infections, classically
   contagious bacteria (Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus)
   and environmental/opportunistic bacteria (principally coagulase-negative
   staphylococci, streptococci and enterobacteria).
   Material and method - We tested 963 farms (for a total of 12429 cattle)
   in 2009, 808 farms (9710 cattle) in 2010 and 764 farms (10507 cattle) in
   2011. Milk samples (corresponding to the pool of four quarters) were
   subjected to bacteriological exam using common media as Blood Agar,
   Baird-Parker -Rabbit Plasma Fibrinogen Agar, Tallium Kristal-violette
   Tossin Agar and Gassner Agar, with subsequent incubation at 37 C for 24
   hours (48 h for BRP-RPF). The identification of isolates was confirmed,
   (in case of doubt and depending on the genus of the germ), by
   agglutination, CAMP test, biochemical tests (API Biomerieux Systems) and
   molecular tests (gene sequencing 16SrRNA), performed according to the
   routine methods. Each pathogen strain was analysed with Kirby-Bauer
   method to determine the pattern of sensitivity for the antibiotics
   mainly used in mastitis' therapy.
   Results and discussion - The prevalence of positive herds for
   Streptococcus agalactiae showed a favorable trend, rising from 28.8\% in
   2009 to 20.7\% in 2010 to finally settle on the 18.2\% in 2011. The
   prevalence of positive herds for Staphylococcus aureus was fairly stable
   during the monitoring period, with values of 39.1\% in 2009, 32.4\% in
   2010, 38.5\% in 2011. The data confirm the effectiveness of therapeutic
   and prophylactic actions carried out against the spread of Streptococcus
   agalactiae in the herds; instead about Staphylococcus aureus, the lack
   of a positive trend is probably related to the fact that the strains
   involved can be sometimes of environmental origin and therefore it's
   difficult their containment, as well as they frequently highlight a
   particular resistance (variable depending on the biotype/genotype) to
   conventional antibiotic therapies. In this regard, the most significant
   resistance, with more than 10\% of the strains not sensitive, relate to
   the following molecules: cloxacillin, neomycin, and tetracycline for
   Streptococcus agalactiae, amoxicillin, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid,
   ampicillin, penicillin, cloxacillin, tetracycline and cefoperazone for
   Staphylococcus aureus. With regard to environmental and opportunistic
   bacteria, coagulase-negative staphylococci and streptococci, in
   particular Streptococcus uberis and Streptococcus disgalactiae, are the
   most common pathogens in the herds not infected by Streptococcus
   agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus.
   Conclusions - In conclusion, the decrease of Streptococcus agalactiae
   diffusion, and also the need to contain the spread of Staphylococcus
   aureus, which is still present with significant prevalence, encourage
   the continuation of the program against infectious mastitis in the farms
   of Aosta Valley Region, integrating bacteriological monitoring,
   prophylaxys actions and pharmacological treatment.},

   tested for the presence of BTV antibodies by c-ELISA, of these 42
   (mean=42\%; 95\% CI: 32.8-51.8) serum samples were from sheep and 55
   (mean=67.9\%; 95\% CI: 57.1-77.1) serum samples were from goats.
   Fourteen blood samples (14/110; mean=12.7\%; 95\% CI: 7.8-20.3), 6
   (6/66; mean=9.1\%; 95\% CI: 4.4-18.5) from sheep and 8 (8/44;
   mean=18.2\%; 95\% CI: 9.6-32.0) from goats, were positive by qRT-PCR.
   The results with serum-neutralization assay and typing performed by
   RT-PCR confirmed that six BTV serotypes are currently circulating in
   Lebanon, and these serotypes are as follows: 1, 4, 6, 8, 16 and 24. This
   study is the first report that confirms the presence and circulation of
   BTV in Lebanon.},

Abstract = {A wide range of arthropod-borne viruses threaten both human and animal
   health either through their presence in Europe or through risk of
   introduction. Prominent among these is West Nile virus (WNV), primarily
   an avian virus, which has caused multiple outbreaks associated with
   human and equine mortality. Endemic outbreaks of West Nile fever have
   been reported in Italy, Greece, France, Romania, Hungary, Russia and
   Spain, with further spread expected. Most outbreaks in Western Europe
   have been due to infection with WNV Lineage 1. In Eastern Europe WNV
   Lineage 2 has been responsible for human and bird mortality,
   particularly in Greece, which has experienced extensive outbreaks over
   three consecutive years. Italy has experienced co-circulation with both
   virus lineages. The ability to manage this threat in a cost-effective
   way is dependent on early detection. Targeted surveillance for pathogens
   within mosquito populations offers the ability to detect viruses prior
   to their emergence in livestock, equine species or human populations. In
   addition, it can establish a baseline of mosquito-borne virus activity
   and allow monitoring of change to this over time. Early detection offers
   the opportunity to raise disease awareness, initiate vector control and
   preventative vaccination, now available for horses, and encourage
   personal protection against mosquito bites. This would have major
   benefits through financial savings and reduction in equid
   morbidity/mortality. However, effective surveillance that predicts virus
   outbreaks is challenged by a range of factors including limited
   resources, variation in mosquito capture rates (too few or too many),
   difficulties in mosquito identification, often reliant on specialist
   entomologists, and the sensitive, rapid detection of viruses in mosquito
   pools. Surveillance for WNV and other arboviruses within mosquito
   populations varies between European countries in the extent and focus of
   the surveillance. This study reviews the current status of WNV in
   mosquito populations across Europe and how this is informing our
   understanding of virus epidemiology. Key findings such as detection of
   virus, presence of vector species and invasive mosquito species are
   summarized, and some of the difficulties encountered when applying a
   cost-effective surveillance programme are highlighted.},

Abstract = {Effective food safety interventions implemented in schools should be an
   important way to reach children and to improve their knowledge and
   habits in the context of food handling and personal hygiene. However,
   few intervention programs of this kind have been implemented with young
   children, as the preferred groups are secondary school children, young
   adults and adults. Even though introducing children to new hygiene
   habits and offering them simplified knowledge based on experience might
   be effective, health intervention programs and evaluation methods must
   be adapted to the peculiarity of childhood learning abilities.
   This study provides an example of a health promotion campaign addressed
   at primary school students, with the aim of improving children's
   knowledge, correcting habits in the context of food safety, and
   enhancing the children's understanding of microorganisms and their
   functions. Children attending a program based on (1) mostly theoretical
   knowledge or (2) mostly practical information (with the scientific
   method of ``learn by playing{''}) were evaluated before and after the
   intervention using drawings and semi structured interviews to test the
   intervention effectiveness. Data extracted from an analysis of 492
   drawings and of 141 interviews showed that practical classes are more
   effective than theory classes. Data also show that children's drawings
   could be used to simplify and consolidate the deep learning of
   scientific topics, and also to evaluate the successfulness of health
   promotion campaigns targeting young children. This should contribute to
   the amelioration of children's awareness of hygiene and food
   contamination-related risks, leading to significant benefits for primary
   prevention of foodborne illness. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Sixteen specimens of female crucian carp, Carassius carassius (L.),
   during the breeding season, were investigated for post-mortem and full
   diagnostic examination during a mortality outbreak in a tributary stream
   of the Arno River in Tuscany in 2011. Necropsy highlighted the presence
   of a swollen anus and widespread haemorrhages in the body, fins, gills
   and eyes. Haemorrhages in internal organs and spleen granulomas were
   also observed. Bacteria isolated from the brain, kidney and spleen of
   affected fish were identified as A.sobria. Microscopic lesions observed
   in gills were characterized by necrosis of the secondary lamellae,
   congestion and multifocal lamellar fusion. The kidney showed necrosis,
   oedema, fibrin exudation and areas of haemorrhages, while in the spleen
   the main lesions were by multifocal necrosis of the lymphoid tissue. In
   the gills, transmission electron microscopy revealed herpesvirus-like
   particles, subsequently identified as Cyprinid herpesvirus-2 (CyHV-2)
   with a nested PCR protocol. Although it was not possible to attribute a
   pathogenic role to CyHV-2 in this mortality event, the identification of

Title = {Investigating genetic diversity of Brucella abortus and Brucella

Year = {2013},

Abstract = {Despite the eradication of brucellosis from most of Europe, the disease
   remains relatively common in a variety of livestock in southern European
   countries. It is therefore surprising that with such high prevalence
   rates, there have been few genetic characterizations of brucellosis
   outbreaks in this region. We conducted a genetic assessment of 206
   isolates of Brucella abortus and B. melitensis from Italy using Variable
   Number Tandem Repeats (VNTRs). We determined genetic diversity and
   geographic distribution of these Brucella VNTR genotypes from 160 farms
   in eight regions of Southern Italy in a fine-scale analysis using 16
   VNTR loci in a MLVA-16 methodology. In a broad scale analysis, we then
   used a reduced dataset of 11 VNTR loci (MLVA-11) to compare genotypes
   from Italy to a global database. In the 84 isolates of B. melitensis,
   there were 56 genotypes using MLVA-16; 43 of these genotypes were found
   only once. At a broad scale, 81 of these isolates were part of an
   Italian sub-group within the West Mediterranean group. One of the two B.
   melitensis isolates from a human patient shared the same genotype as a
   livestock isolate, suggesting a possible epidemiological connection. In
   122 B. abortus isolates, there were 34 genotypes by MLVA-16; 16 of these
   genotypes were found only once. At a broad scale with MLVA-11, one
   genotype was predominant, comprising 77.8\% of the isolates and was
   distributed throughout Southern Italy. These data on the current
   lineages of Brucella present in Italy should form the basis for
   epidemiological studies of Brucella throughout the country, while
   placing these strains in a global context. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Bed bugs (Cimex lectularius) have been a common problem for humans for
   at least 3,500 years and in Europe their presence was endemic until the
   end of World War II, when infestations began to decrease. However, since
   the beginning of the 21st century new cases of infestations have been
   reported in developed countries. Many theories have been put forward to
   explain this change of direction, but none has been scientifically
   proven. The aim of this study is to provide some reports of bed bug
   infestations in Northern Italy (Liguria, Piedmont and Aosta valley
   regions) and a brief summary about their identification, clinical
   significance, bioecology and control. From 2008 to date, 17 bed bug
   infestations were identified in Northwest Italy. Knowledge about the
   presence and distribution of bed bugs in Italy is scanty, prior to this
   work only 2 studies reported the comeback of these arthropods in the
   Italian territory; further investigations would be necessary to better
   understand the current situation.},

Abstract = {Mycoplasma bovis is an important cause of bovine respiratory disease,
   especially in young calves where it can also cause arthritis,
   tenosynovitis and otitis. During 2009 and 2010 a survey was carried out
   on carcasses of calves less than one month old sent to the Diagnostic
   Laboratory of the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia
   e dell'Emilia Romagna in Brescia, regardless of the presence of lung
   lesions, to detect this pathogen. PCR tests for Mycoplasma spp. and M.
   bovis were applied. 83 out of 224(37\%) lung tissue samples examined
   were positive at PCR test for Mycoplasma spp.; in 64 cases of these we
   observed typical respiratory lesions (P < 0.001). M. bovis was
   identified in 26 out of 83 (31\%) lung tissue samples positive at PCR
   test for Myco plasma spp.; in 24 cases of these we observed typical
   respiratory lesions (P = 0.039). Our data demonstrate that presence of
   Mycoplasma spp. and M. bovis positively correlates with pneumonic lung
   lesions in young dairy calves. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   new BT outbreaks caused by BTV-1 and BTV-4 were reported. Nearly 500
   flocks were infected and 9238 sheep died because of the infection. When
   sequenced, Seg-10 of both strains shared 99\% similarity at nucleotide
   level with BTV strains that have circulated in the Mediterranean basin
   in the last few years. Similarly, Seg-5 sequences of BTV-1 and BTV-4
   newly isolated Sardinian strains are identical and cluster together with
   recent BTV-1 circulating in the Mediterranean Basin and the BTV-4
   strains isolated in Tunisia in 2007 and 2009. These BTV-4 strains differ
   from the ones that circulated in Europe from 2003 to 2005 and appear to
   be reassortant strains. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   State, particularly Italy, has to carry out checks at marketing stage.
   This work reports on the results of analytical controls on 451 foodstuff
   samples over the period 2006-2011 performed by an Italian accredited
   laboratory using 4 different screening and confirmatory techniques: PSL,
   DNA Comet Assay, TL and ESR. A total of 18 samples were found
   non-compliant: 6 frog legs, 3 clams, 3 cuttlefish, I octopus and 1
   shrimps from Vietnam; 3 squids, 1 white pepper and 1 chilli tofu from
   China. Non-compliances are due to both incorrect labelling and
   irradiation in not approved facilities in extra European/third
   countries. Check results also showed that among screening methods PSL is
   the most. accurate, simple and practical standard to analyse most of
   samples (spices, herbs, supplements, mollusks, crustaceans and
   vegetables) with a low false positive classification (11\%) whereas DNA
   Comet Assay revealed the highest percentage of false positive cases
   (26\%). ESR is the suitable confirmatory method to detect dried fruits
   and foodstuffs (meat and fish product) containing bone, while TL is the
   best confirmatory method to detect herbs, spices and supplements,
   cephalopods, mollusks and crustaceans, besides fresh fruits and
   vegetables. In conclusion, by comparison with European data, this study
   suggests more checks on meat products (frog and poultry meats), fish
   products (cephalopods, mussels and crustacean) spices and supplements
   especially at import stage from countries where non approved irradiation
   facilities are operating (e.g. Vietnam and China). (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {After more than 10 years of absence, in 2008 rabies re-emerged and
   spread in wild foxes in north-eastern Italy. In order to control the
   infection and to minimize the risk of human exposure, three oral foxes
   vaccination campaigns were first carried out by manual distribution of
   baits between January and September 2009, followed by four emergency
   oral rabies vaccination (ORV) campaigns by aerial distribution in the
   affected regions starting in December 2009. Ordinary aerial ORV
   campaigns followed in spring and fall 2011 and 2012, although no cases
   were reported after February 2011. In our paper, we describe the main
   characteristics of the rabies epidemic that occurred in north-eastern
   Italy in 2008-2011, with particular focus on the innovative systems that
   were implemented to manage and evaluate the efficacy of the aerial ORV.
   The Italian experience in containing and eliminating rabies in less than
   3 years may provide information and suggestions for countries affected
   by rabies, and sharing a similar geomorphological conformation as Italy.},

Title = {A NEW POTENTIALLY TOXIC AZADINIUM SPECIES (DINOPHYCEAE) FROM THE

Abstract = {A new photosynthetic planktonic marine dinoflagellate, Azadinium
   dexteroporum sp. nov., is described from the Gulf of Naples (South
   Tyrrhenian Sea, Mediterranean Sea). The plate formula of the species,
   Po, cp, X, 4, 3a, 6, 6C, 5?S, 6'{''} and 2, is typical for this recently
   described genus. Azadinium dexteroporum is the smallest rep-resentative
   of the genus (8.5m average length, 6.2m average width) and shares the
   presence of a small antapical spine with the type species A.spinosum and
   with A.polongum. However, it differs from all other Azadinium species
   for the markedly asymmetrical Po plate and the position of the ventral
   pore, which is located at the right posterior end of the Po plate.
   Another peculiarity of A.dexteroporum is the pronounced concavity of the
   second intercalary plate (2a), which appears collapsed with respect to
   the other plates. Phylogenetic analyses based on the large subunit 28S
   rDNA (D1/D2) and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS rDNA) support the
   attribution of A.dexteroporum to the genus Azadinium and its separation
   from the other known species. LC/MS-TOF analysis shows that Azadinium
   dex-teroporum produces azaspiracids in low amounts. Some of them have
   the same molecular weight as known compounds such as azaspiracid-3 and
   -7 and Compound 3 from Amphidoma languida, as well as similar
   fragmentation patterns in some cases. This is the first finding of a
   species producing azapiracids in the Mediterranean Sea.},

Abstract = {The presence of ochratoxin A (OTA) was determined in traditional
   dry-cured meat products made from sub-chronically OTA-exposed pigs. The
   experimental group of pigs (n=5) was treated with 300 mu g OTAkg(-1) of
   feed during 30days, whereas the control group (n=5) remained untreated.
   After the household production of six types of dry-cured meat products
   based on traditional recipes, OTA residues were determined in final
   products produced from each treated and untreated animal using an
   immunoenzymatic technique (ELISA) and HPLC with fluorescence detection
   (HPLC-FD). The analytical methods showed acceptable analytical
   performance results and high correlation coefficients. Mean OTA
   concentrations ranged from 4.51 +/- 0.11 mu gkg(-1) in smoked ham to
   6.87 +/- 2.01 mu gkg(-1) in home-made Slavonian sausage. The study
   demonstrated that pig exposure to OTA leads to the accumulation of OTA
   residues in muscle and adipose tissue used for the production, and
   consequently results in contamination of the final meat products.},

Volume = {33},

Abstract = {Interferon-alpha (IFN-) shows potent immunomodulatory properties, which
   underlies its use for low-dose oral treatments of diverse viral
   infections and immunopathological conditions. The studies on oral
   administration have been hampered by the lack of recognized in vitro
   models, reproducing the in vivo control action of IFN- over inflammatory
   cytokine responses. Owing to these reasons, the aim of our study was to
   validate IPEC-J2 (a continuous cell line of porcine intestinal
   epithelial cells) as a reporter system of the properties of IFN-. Three
   different experimental conditions (oxidative stress, inflammatory
   response, and amplification of lymphoid cell signals) were selected to
   evaluate the effects of porcine recombinant IFN-(1) (rIFN-) and 2
   natural porcine IFN- preparations (nIFN-). The IFNs under study showed
   significantly different control actions in IPEC-J2 cells. In particular,
   rIFN- was shown to down-regulate interleukin (IL)-8, IL-1, tumor
   necrosis factor (TNF)-, and -defensin 1 genes either directly, or
   indirectly through second messengers released by IFN--treated lymphoid
   cells. With regard to IL-6, only second messengers from IFN--treated
   lymphoid cells could regulate the expression of this cytokine. Our
   results suggest that IPEC-J2 cells can be a useful tool for
   investigating the regulatory actions of type I IFNs and the second
   messengers thereof. The results provided by this model could be
   conveniently exploited in studies on enteric diseases sustained by
   infectious or noninfectious stressors.},

Title = {Lipid profiles in brains from sheep with natural scrapie},
Journal = {CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS OF LIPIDS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {175},
Pages = {33-40},
Month = {OCT-NOV},
Abstract = {Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders affecting many
   mammals, ovine scrapie being the archetypal prion disease. Several
   independent studies in murine and cell-based models of scrapie have
   highlighted the presence of a link between prion generation and lipid
   alterations; yet, no data on natural disease are available. In this
   study we investigated levels of total lipids and cholesterol as well as
   profiles of fatty acids in brain homogenates from symptomatic and
   asymptomatic scrapie-infected sheep vs. healthy sheep, all belonging to
   the same flock. Lipid extracts were analyzed by means of gas
   chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography. Data of fatty
   acids were submitted to multivariate statistical analysis to give a
   picture of the brain lipid profiles of sheep. Interestingly, results
   revealed abnormalities in the brain fatty acid unsaturation of
   infected/symptomatic animals. Significant reduction of monoene 18:1 n-9
   was detected in brain lipids from infected/symptomatic sheep, as
   compared to healthy and infected/asymptomatic animals, and this
   alteration occurred in combination with a significant increase in 18:0
   level. The unsupervised Principal Component Analysis showed that
   infected/symptomatic and healthy sheep samples lie in two different
   regions of the plot, infected/asymptomatic lie mostly next to healthy.
   The increase of cerebral saturated fatty acids provides a rough
   indication of presumed alterations in lipid raft domains of nervous
   cells during scrapie, suggesting that they may exist in a notable
   viscous liquid-ordered state. Such physicochemical alteration would have
   a profound impact on the raft thermodynamic properties, its spatial
   organization, and signal transduction, all potentially relevant for
   prion generation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In Italy, since 2005 a breeding plan to increase scrapie resistance has
   been adopted. The impact of this selection on genetic diversity was
   assessed on Sambucana, an autochtonous sheep breed reared in southern
   Piedmont, by analysing the evolution of allele frequencies at different
   levels: PRNP (prion protein) gene, microsatellite loci on OAR13 (where
   PRNR maps), and microsatellite loci on other chromosomes, not subjected
   to selection for scrapie resistance. A total of 147 young rams, 80 born
   in 2004 and 67 in 2008-2009 were analysed. Evidence of diversity loss
   was observed for PRNP gene as a consequence of the directional
   selection. Diversity was affected in the immediate vicinity of PRNP but
   the effect on more distant loci on the same chromosome was trivial. With
   regard to neutral markers, lack of heterozygosis with no changeover of
   allele frequencies was observed suggesting an increase of inbreeding.
   Mating policies would be sufficient to solve these problems. A selection
   scheme based on genotyping rams and eliminating carriers of both
   susceptible and high susceptible alleles is the best way to improve
   natural resistance to scrapie with low costs and minimal problems in the
   current conservation programmes targeting rare breeds. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {A wild Beech Marten (Manes foina), was referred for necropsy to the
   Department of Animal Pathology of the University of Turin (Italy).
   At gross examination, whitish and firm masses, 10-mm in diameter, were
   found on the heart and in the kidney. Spleen showed lighter color and
   greater consistency, and the cut surface of the liver appeared scattered
   with whitish-yellow coalescing foci homogeneously distributed.
   Amyloid deposits were present in the perivascular and intercellular
   spaces of the visceral organs, such as the heart, liver, and kidneys.
   Amyloid stained positively with Congo red with and without 5\% potassium
   permanganate pretreatment and showed green birefringence observable
   under polarized light. A diagnosis of systemic AL amyloidosis was made.
   This is the first description of systemic AL amyloidosis in a wild Stone

Abstract = {Essential oils from six different populations of Origanum vulgare subsp.
   hirtum were compared for their antibiofilm properties. The six essential
   oils (A to F) were characterized by a combination of gas chromatography
   with flame ionization detector and gas chromatography with mass
   spectrometer detector analyses. All oils showed weak activity against
   the planktonic form of a group of Staphylococcus aureus strains and
   against a Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442 reference strain. The
   ability to inhibit biofilm formation was investigated at sub-MIC levels
   of 200, 100, and 50 mu g/ml by staining sessile cells with safranin.
   Sample E showed the highest average effectiveness against all tested
   strains at 50 mu g/ml and had inhibition percentages ranging from 30 to
   52\%. In the screening that used preformed biofilm from the reference
   strain P. aeruginosa, essential oils A through E were inactive at 200 mu
   g/ml; F was active with a percentage of inhibition equal to 53.2\%.
   Oregano essential oil can inhibit the formation of biofilms of various
   food pathogens and food spoilage organisms.},

Title = {Tail docking and the rearing of heavy pigs: The role played by gender

Abstract = {This study evaluated whether the specific heavy pig rearing context
   allowed the fattening of undocked pigs without an outbreak of tail
   biting. At the same time, gender and straw availability (small amounts)
   were considered to understand their possible interactions with tail
   presence in the display of tail biting. A 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design was
   adopted to test the effects of these factors on blood parameters,
   behaviour and tail/ear lesions. Few interactions among factors were
   detected. Undocked pigs showed lower cortisol (P < 0.02), lying
   behaviour (P < 0.001), and higher risk of tail/ear biting (weeks 3 and
   9), but lower risk of tail lesions (week 14). Straw increased the
   motivation for exploring (P < 0.001), reduced serum haptoglobin (P <
   0.001) and the risk for tail biting (weeks 3, 9, 18) and ear biting
   (weeks 3, 9). Results highlight the importance of straw as an
   environmental enrichment and seem to indicate that fattening undocked
   heavy pigs is possible. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the diagnostic and clinical observations of an
   infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) variant, referred to as Q1, in
   clinically ill chickens in Italy. This IBV variant was described for the
   first time in 1998 in China. In the autumn of 2011 it caused a
   small-scale epidemic in non-vaccinated meat chickens in farms located in
   Northern Italy. The disease was characterized by increased mortality,
   kidney lesions and proventriculitis. Histopatological observations
   confirmed the nephritis and described an unusual erosive/necrotic
   proventriculitis with infiltration of lymphocytes, plasma cells and
   heterophils, as well as fibroplasia in the lamina propria. Despite these
   findings and the isolation of the Q1 IB virus directly from
   proventricular tissue, further studies are necessary to confirm the role
   of this IBV strain in the development of proventricular lesions.
   Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all the IBV isolates were very
   similar and probably had a common origin. The IBV Q1 variant appears to
   be now endemic in the North of Italy and at times it is detected in
   vaccinated backyard and commercial broiler farms. The importance of
   continuous monitoring in controlling the spread of known or emerging IBV
   variants is underlined.},

Abstract = {A tuberculosis (TB) outbreak caused by Mycobacterium bovis occurred in a
   mixed herd of three cattle and eighteen goats in Northern Italy in 2005.
   All the cattle were removed, as opposed to the co-existing goats, who
   remained in the farm and were not subsequently tested by the official
   intradermal tuberculin test. At the beginning of May 2006, a 7-day old
   calf was introduced into the herd from an officially TB-free (OTF) farm.
   On October 2006, tuberculous lesions were detected at the slaughterhouse
   in the same animal. The following epidemiological investigation on the
   herd highlighted a clinical suspicion of TB in one goat out of 35, and
   visible lesions were found at necropsy in the respiratory and intestinal
   tracts. Bacteriological culture and molecular tests confirmed the
   presence of M. bovis in both animals. Spoligotyping and Mycobacterial
   Interspersed Repetitive Units - Variable Number of Tandem Repeats
   (MIRU-VNTR) showed the same genomic profile of the previous breakdown
   occurred in 2005. Since this profile has never been described in Italy,
   these findings suggest the probable transmission of TB within the farm
   among cattle and goats.
   The remaining 34 goats were also tested by single intradermal cervical
   comparative tuberculin (SICCT) test, Interferon (IFN)-gamma assay and
   ELISA for antibody to M. bovis. The SICCT test and the IFN-gamma showed
   a good concordance with 20 and 19 positive reactors, respectively. By
   ELISA we found 12 Ab-positive animals, seven of which had not been
   detected by the tests for cell-mediated immunity. Finally, 15 goats were
   found positive for gross lesions at necropsy.
   The in vivo tests revealed a total of 27 positive animals out of 35,
   which highlights the usefulness of the serology in parallel with SICCT
   and IFN-gamma when an advanced stage of infection is suspected.
   Moreover, our results confirm the necessity for adopting the official
   tuberculin test on goats co-existing with cattle. (c) 2013 Published by

   combs, the matrices were sampled at different time points, and
   sulfathiazole residues were quantified by high-performance liquid
   chromatography with fluorescence detection. In honey, the higher
   concentration of sulfathiazole (180 mg kg(-1)) occurred 2 weeks after
   the last treatment in syrup. In beeswax, drug concentration was higher
   than in honey, particularly with powder administration, with a maximum
   level (340 mg kg(-1)) 3 days following the last treatment. The strongest
   contamination in honeybees (28 mg kg(-1)) was achieved with
   sulfathiazole administered in powder 3 days after the second treatment.
   The high persistence of sulfathiazole in the different beehive matrices
   suggests that it could be a reliable marker of previous treatments
   performed by beekeepers.},

Abstract = {This study reports the results of the finding of Contracaecum spp.
   during a survey on endoparasites isolated from cultured and wild fish
   and also from some cephalopods caught in Sardinian waters. Contracaecum
   spp. is a nematode belonging to the Anisakidae, and is reported to cause
   zoonosis in humans. Nematodes were detected after visual inspection and
   enzymatic digestion and then identified by morphologic observation,
   which was confirmed by PCR.
   The results show that Contracaecum spp. were found in both fish caught
   from sea or lagoon, and in both cultured and wild fish: 33 of the
   parasitized samples were wild fish (24 caught in the sea and 9 in
   lagoons) and 11 were cultured ones.
   The prevalence of Contracaecum spp. was higher in Diplodus spp.
   (16.0\%), Sparus aurata (15.8\%) and Mullus spp. (14.6\%). Larvae were
   also found by enzymatic digestion at muscular level in 5 species, with
   the highest prevalence in S. aurata (10.5\%). The results of this study
   indicate that Contracaecum spp. was present in cultured fish such as S.
   aurata, Diplodus spp. and Dicentrarchus labrax. All cultured fish with
   parasites were collected from land-based semi-intensive tanks whose
   water came from an adjacent lagoon. Finally, the evidence that this
   parasite is found in both cultured and wild fish leads us to re-consider
   the zoonotic potential of Contracaecum spp., in particular when one
   bears in mind its dimensions at the L3 stage, when it is barely visible
   to the human eye. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study aims to investigate the occurrence of Anisakidae larvae
   (genera Anisakis and Hysterothylacium) in fishes and squids used for
   human nutrition and increase the knowledge of the distribution of
   Anisakidae larvae in this area of Mediterranean Sea. Distribution and
   correct identification of Anisakidae larvae in fish species is important
   for the assessment of their relative epidemiological role; especially
   when the fishes are of high commercial value and largely used in human
   nutrition. The study investigated the occurrence of Anisakidae larvae
   (genera Anisakis and Hysterothylacium) in 195 fishes owing to 22
   different species and 60 squids (Illex coindetii) sampled in northern
   Ligurian Sea. A combination of morphological and PCR-RFLP methods have
   been used. A total of 177 anisakid larvae were isolated in 42/195
   (21.5\%) fish of 11 species and only one larva in one squid. These
   larvae were identified morphologically as belonging to the genera
   Anisakis (36/177) or Hysterothylacium (142/177). All Anisakis larvae
   were isolated from Trachurus trachurus and were identified at species
   level by PCR-RFLP as belonging to Anisakis pegreffii. Hysterothylacium
   sp. in short, larvae presence occurred in most of examined fish species
   with a higher density in Mullus barbatus (mean intensity 5.6 larvae) and
   Serranus scriba (MI 5.3). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Emergence of a new lagovirus related to rabbit haemorrhagic disease

Journal = {VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {44},
Month = {SEP 8},
Abstract = {Since summer 2010, numerous cases of Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD)
   have been reported in north-western France both in rabbitries, affecting
   RHD-vaccinated rabbits, and in wild populations. We demonstrate that the
   aetiological agent was a lagovirus phylogenetically distinct from other
   lagoviruses and which presents a unique antigenic profile. Experimental
   results show that the disease differs from RHD in terms of disease
   duration, mortality rates, higher occurrence of subacute/chronic forms
   and that partial cross-protection occurs between RHDV and the new RHDV
   variant, designated RHDV2. These data support the hypothesis that RHDV2
   is a new member of the Lagovirus genus. A molecular epidemiology study
   detected RHDV2 in France a few months before the first recorded cases
   and revealed that one year after its discovery it had spread throughout
   the country and had almost replaced RHDV strains. RHDV2 was detected in
   continental Italy in June 2011, then four months later in Sardinia.},

Abstract = {Transplacental transmission of bluetongue virus has been shown
   previously for the North European strain of serotype 8 (BTV-8) and for
   tissue culture or chicken egg-adapted vaccine strains but not for field
   strains of other serotypes. In this study, pregnant ewes (6 per group)
   were inoculated with either field or rescued strains of BTV-2 and BTV-8
   in order to determine the ability of these viruses to cross the
   placental barrier. The field BTV-2 and BTV-8 strains was passaged once
   in Culicoides KC cells and once in mammalian cells. All virus inoculated
   sheep became infected and seroconverted against the different BTV
   strains used in this study. BTV RNA was detectable in the blood of all
   but two ewes for over 28 days but infectious virus could only be
   detected in the blood for a much shorter period. Interestingly,
   transplacental transmission of BTV-2 (both field and rescued strains)
   was demonstrated at high efficiency (6 out of 13 lambs born to BTV-2
   infected ewes) while only 1 lamb of 12 born to BTV-8 infected ewes
   showed evidence of in utero infection. In addition, evidence for
   horizontal transmission of BTV-2 between ewes was observed. As expected,
   the parental BTV-2 and BTV-8 viruses and the viruses rescued by reverse
   genetics showed very similar properties to each other. This study
   showed, for the first time, that transplacental transmission of BTV-2,
   which had been minimally passaged in cell culture, can occur; hence such
   transmission might be more frequent than previously thought.},

Abstract = {Investigating the innate immune response mediators released in milk has
   manifold implications, spanning from elucidation of the role played by
   mammary epithelial cells (MECs) in fighting microbial infections to the
   discovery of novel diagnostic markers for monitoring udder health in
   dairy animals. Here, we investigated the mammary gland response
   following a two-step experimental infection of lactating sheep with the
   mastitis-associated bacterium Streptococcus uberis. The establishment of
   infection was confirmed both clinically and by molecular methods,
   including PCR and fluorescent in situ hybridization of mammary tissues.
   Proteomic investigation of the milk fat globule (MFG), a complex vesicle
   released by lactating MECs, enabled detection of enrichment of several
   proteins involved in inflammation, chemotaxis of immune cells, and
   antimicrobial defense, including cathelicidins and calprotectin
   (S100A8/S100A9), in infected animals, suggesting the consistent
   involvement of MECs in the innate immune response to pathogens. The
   ability of MECs to produce and release antimicrobial and immune defense
   proteins was then demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and confocal
   immunomicroscopy of cathelicidin and the calprotectin subunit S100A9 on
   mammary tissues. The time course of their release in milk was also
   assessed by Western immunoblotting along the course of the experimental
   infection, revealing the rapid increase of these proteins in the MFG
   fraction in response to the presence of bacteria. Our results support an
   active role of MECs in the innate immune response of the mammary gland
   and provide new potential for the development of novel and more
   sensitive tools for monitoring mastitis in dairy animals.},

Abstract = {Preparedness for bioterrorism is based on communication between people
   in organizations who are educated and trained in several disciplines,
   including law enforcement, health, and science. Various backgrounds,
   cultures, and vocabularies generate difficulties in understanding and
   interpretating terms and concepts, which may impair communication. This
   is especially true in emergency situations, in which the need for
   clarity and consistency is vital. The EU project AniBio-Threat initiated
   methods and made a rough estimate of the terms and concepts that are
   crucial for an incident, and a pilot database with key terms and
   definitions has been constructed. Analysis of collected terms and
   sources has shown that many of the participating organizations use
   various international standards in their area of expertise. The same
   term often represents different concepts in the standards from different
   sectors, or, alternatively, different terms were used to represent the
   same or similar concepts. The use of conflicting terminology can be
   problematic for decision makers and communicators in planning and
   prevention or when handling an incident. Since the CBRN area has roots
   in multiple disciplines, each with its own evolving terminology, it may
   not be realistic to achieve unequivocal communication through a
   standardized vocabulary and joint definitions for words from common
   language. We suggest that a communication strategy should include
   awareness of alternative definitions and ontologies and the ability to
   talk and write without relying on the implicit knowledge underlying
   specialized jargon. Consequently, cross-disciplinary communication
   skills should be part of training of personnel in the CBRN field. In
   addition, a searchable repository of terms and definitions from relevant
   organizations and authorities would be a valuable addition to existing
   glossaries for improving awareness concerning bioterrorism prevention
   planning.},

Abstract = {Botulism is a neuroparalytic disease that can occur in all warm-blooded
   animals, birds, and fishes. The disease in animals is mainly caused by
   toxins produced by Clostridium botulinum strains belonging to group III,
   although outbreaks due to toxins produced by group I and II organisms
   have been recognized. Group III strains are capable of producing
   botulinum toxins of type C, D, and C/D and D/C mosaic variants.
   Definitive diagnosis of animal botulism is made by combining clinical
   findings with laboratory investigations. Detection of toxins in clinical
   specimens and feed is the gold standard for laboratory diagnosis. Since
   toxins may be degraded by organisms contained in the gastrointestinal
   tract or may be present at levels below the detection limit, the
   recovery of C. botulinum from sick animal specimens is consistent for
   laboratory confirmation. In this article we report the development and
   in-house validation of a new multiplex real-time PCR for detecting and
   typing the neurotoxin genes found in C. botulinum group III organisms.
   Validation procedures have been carried out according to ISO 16140,
   using strains and samples recovered from cases of animal botulism in
   Italy and France.},

Abstract = {Botulism is a severe neuroparalytic disease that affects humans, all
   warm-blooded animals, and some fishes. The disease is caused by exposure
   to toxins produced by Clostridium botulinum and other botulinum
   toxin-producing clostridia. Botulism in animals represents a severe
   environmental and economic concern because of its high mortality rate.
   Moreover, meat or other products from affected animals entering the food
   chain may result in a public health problem. To this end, early
   diagnosis is crucial to define and apply appropriate veterinary public
   health measures. Clinical diagnosis is based on clinical findings
   eliminating other causes of neuromuscular disorders and on the absence
   of internal lesions observed during postmortem examination. Since
   clinical signs alone are often insufficient to make a definitive
   diagnosis, laboratory confirmation is required. Botulinum antitoxin
   administration and supportive therapies are used to treat sick animals.
   Once the diagnosis has been made, euthanasia is frequently advisable.
   Vaccine administration is subject to health authorities' permission, and
   it is restricted to a small number of animal species. Several measures
   can be adopted to prevent or minimize outbreaks. In this article we
   outline all phases of management of animal botulism outbreaks occurring
   in wet wild birds, poultry, cattle, horses, and fur farm animals.},

Abstract = {The present research has been performed to evaluate whether a commercial
   magnesium-enriched hydroxyapatite (MgHA)/collagen-based scaffold
   engineered with ovine amniotic fluid mesenchymal cells (oAFMC) could
   improve bone regeneration process in vivo.
   Bilateral sinus augmentation was performed on eight adult sheep in order
   to compare the tissue regeneration process at 45 and 90 days after
   implantation of the oAFMC-engineered scaffold (Test Group) or of the
   scaffold alone (Ctr Group). The process of tissue remodeling was
   analyzed through histological, immunohistochemical, and morphometric
   analyses by calculating the proliferation index (PI) of oAFMC loaded on
   the scaffold, the total vascular area (VA), and vascular endothelial
   growth factor (VEGF) expression levels within the grafted area.
   MgHA/collagen-based scaffold showed high biocompatibility preserving the
   survival of oAFMC for 90 days in grafted sinuses. The use of oAFMC
   increased bone deposition and stimulated a more rapid angiogenic
   reaction, thus probably supporting the higher cell PI recorded in
   cell-treated sinuses. A significantly higher VEGF expression (Test vs.
   Ctr Group; p = 0.0004) and a larger total VA (p = 0.0006) were detected
   in the Test Group at 45 days after surgery. The PI was significantly
   higher (p = 0.027) at 45 days and became significantly lower at 90 days
   (p = 0.0007) in the Test Group sinuses, while the PI recorded in the Ctr
   Group continued to increase resulting to a significantly higher PI at
   day 90 (CTR day 45 vs. CTR day 90; p = 0.022).
   The osteoinductive effect of a biomimetic commercial scaffold may be
   significantly improved by the presence of oAFMC.
   The amniotic fluid mesenchymal cell (AFMC) may represent a novel,
   largely and easily accessible source of mesenchymal stem cells to
   develop cell-based therapy for maxillofacial surgery.},

Abstract = {Haptoglobin (Hp), serum amyloid A (SAA), C-reactive protein (CRP), and
   white blood cells (WBC) were assessed in 20 dogs divided into 2 groups.
   The dogs of group A were not subjected to hunting exercise (control
   group), while the dogs of group B were subjected to hunting exercise for
   3 hr (experimental group). Blood samples were collected from each animal
   before hunting (T0), immediately after 3 hr of hunting (T1), and after 1
   hr of recovery (T2). The general linear model (GLM) repeated measures
   procedure showed a significant difference between the 2 groups (P <
   0.0001) and a significant rise (P < 0.0001) in concentration of Hp, SAA,
   and CRP after hunting exercise, with a consequent decline during
   recovery period in group B. These parameters could be considered valid
   and easily obtainable biomarkers in relation to hunting stress in dogs.
   Additional studies will continue to elucidate the magnitude and the time
   of response of other acute phase proteins.},

Title = {Efficiency of flagging and dragging for tick collection},
Journal = {EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {61},
Number = {1},
Pages = {119-127},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {It is acknowledged that data from field studies on tick ecology might be
   biased by collection methods, but actually comparative studies are still
   limited. Herein we assessed whether the efficiency of flagging and
   dragging varies according to tick developmental stage, species, season
   and habitat. Ticks were collected in three sites bordered by an oak
   forest. The abundance of ticks collected by each collection method
   varied according to tick species, developmental stage, season, and
   habitat. Flagging was in general more efficient in collecting adult
   ticks, especially in spring and winter. Females were more frequently
   collected by flagging in the meadow and grassland habitats and males in
   the man-made trail. Flagging collected significantly more adults of
   Dermacentor marginatus, Hyalomma marginatum, Haemaphysalis inermis and
   Ixodes ricinus. Flagging was more efficient in collecting D. marginatus
   and I. ricinus in spring, and H. inermis and I. ricinus females in both
   spring and winter. In summer and autumn tick abundances were generally
   similar, with the exception of D. marginatus female in autumn. Flagging
   was more efficient in collecting D. marginatus adults in the meadow
   habitat and in the man-made trail, and I. ricinus adults in the meadow
   and grassland habitats. Dragging was more efficient in grassland for R.
   turanicus. Our results suggest that variations in terms of collection
   method performance are associated to factors linked to tick behaviour,
   habitat characteristics, and climate. Field studies employing these
   collection methods should take this into account to avoid misleading
   conclusions about tick population dynamics and tick-borne pathogen
   transmission risk.},

Abstract = {A survey was carried out to determine the prevalence of anisakid
   nematode larvae in European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) fished off
   the Tyrrhenian coast of central Italy. From February through July 2012,
   1,490 specimens of E. encrasicolus caught in three different fishing
   areas (off Civitavecchia, Anzio, and Gaeta in the northern, central, and
   southern Lazio region of Italy, respectively) were tested for the
   presence of anisakid larvae, both by visual microscopic inspection and
   enzymatic digestion. In each of the three fishing areas, each of two
   sampling times produced 250 fish (with the exception of one sampling
   time in Gaeta that produced 240 fish). Larvae of the family Anisakidae
   were detected with an overall estimated prevalence of 2.3\%, and each
   positive fish harbored a single larva. No anisakid larvae were detected
   in fish caught off Gaeta. Fish with larvae were significantly longer
   (standard length) than fish without larvae. Twenty-six larvae (74.3\%)
   were detected by visual inspection of the viscera, eight larvae (22.8\%)
   were detected by visual inspection of the fillets, and one larva (2.8\%)
   was detected after digestion of pooled fillets. Molecular analysis to
   fully characterize the 35 detected larvae revealed 15 specimens of
   Anisakis pegreffii, 10 specimens of Hysterothylacium aduncum, and one
   hybrid genotype of A. pegreffii x Anisakis simplex. For nine specimens,
   no visible product was obtained after PCR amplification. The overall
   prevalence for A. pegreffii and H. aduncum was 1.0 and 0.7\%,
   respectively. A comparison between fishes harboring A. pegreffii larvae
   and those harboring H. aduncum revealed that those with A. pegreffii
   were significantly heavier. The prevalence of anisakid larvae found in
   the present study is lower then that reported previously in E.
   encrasicolus collected in the Mediterranean Sea.},

Title = {Excretion profile of corticosteroids in bovine urine compared with
   tissue residues after therapeutic and growth-promoting administration of
   dexamethasone},
Journal = {STEROIDS},

Volume = {78},

Abstract = {The illicit use of dexamethasone as growth-promoting agent in animal
   breeding is still practiced within the EU constituting a health risk for
   meat consumers. An experimental study was developed to assess
   dexamethasone urinary excretion and tissue distribution (liver, kidney,
   and muscle) in male calves after therapeutic and growth-promoting
   administration. Urine and tissue samples collected from treated and
   untreated bovines were also investigated for the presence of other
   natural and synthetic corticosteroids (prednisolone, prednisone,
   hydrocortisone, and cortisone), in order to study a possible correlation
   with dexamethasone administration and to clarify prednisolone origin.
   Analyses were performed by a multi-residue LC-MS/MS method developed and
   validated according to the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC.
   The results confirm the rapid rate of dexamethasone urinary excretion,
   irrespective of the dosage, the duration and the route of
   administration, and the disappearance of cortisone and hydrocortisone
   during the treatment. Dexamethasone was distributed to the tissues where
   the elimination rate proceeded relatively slower as suggested by the
   presence of residues one month after the withdrawal of the therapeutic
   treatment.
   An increase in the number of positive findings for prednisolone, in
   association with higher levels of cortisone and hydrocortisone, was
   observed in urine samples collected from slaughterhouse rather than
   those collected at the farm. Prednisone residues were found only in one
   urine sample that showed the highest levels of prednisolone,
   hydrocortisone, and cortisone.
   The occurrence of prednisolone residues in urine and even in tissue
   samples confirms the endogenous nature of this molecule. (C) 2013

Abstract = {Following the first case of Schmallenberg (SBV) in northern Italy in
   February 2012, virus detection was conducted on midges collected during
   the national entomological surveillance program for bluetongue (BT). Six
   cattle farms, within a radius of 50 km from the SBV case, were selected
   for a 12 month study, aiming to determine when the virus entered the
   area, if it was capable of overwintering, and the possible role played
   by each species of the Obsoletus complex in disseminating the infection.
   A total of 33,724 Culicoides were collected at the six sites between
   June 2011 and June 2012. Species belonging to the Obsoletus Complex were
   the most abundant (94.44\%) and, within the complex, Culicoides
   obsoletus was the most prevalent species in the studying area (65.4\%).
   Nearly 7000 Culicoides midges were screened, either in pools or
   individually, for SBV by real-time RT-PCR. Viral genome was detected in
   six pools of the Obsoletus complex, collected at three sites between
   September and November 2011, and in a single parous female of C
   obsoletus, collected in May 2012.
   As a result of the BT surveillance program in Italy it was possible to
   demonstrate, retrospectively, that SBV has circulated in at least three
   Italian provinces since early September 2011, nearly 5 months prior and
   as far as 40 km away from the first detected case. Similarly, the survey
   confirmed the presence of SBV in the vector population 3 months after
   the outbreak, following a cold winter during which the blacklight traps
   failed to catch active adult midges. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {In the last decade massive blooms of the Ostreopsis cf. ovata have
   occurred in the Mediterranean basin, posing great concern to both
   environmental and human health.
   Biotoxicological and chemical studies demonstrated that O. cf. ovata
   produces palytoxin and ovatoxins; besides direct respiratory effects on
   humans due to inhalation of marine toxic aerosols, O. cf. ovata blooms
   can cause adverse effects on benthic invertebrates.
   The main aim of this study was to highlight the role of immunological,
   cellular and oxidative mechanisms in modulating the toxicity induced by
   O. cf. ovata in mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis. Organisms were
   exposed in laboratory condition to O. cf. ovata and analysed after 7 and
   14 days of exposure.
   Obtained results demonstrated a clear involvement of the immune system
   with a significant decrement of granulocytes respect to the hyalinocytes
   type cells, a diminished phagocytosis activity and a reduced lysosomal
   membrane stability in haemocytes, after both 7 and 14 days of exposure.
   Histological analyses showed a decrease of the digestive gland wall
   thickness, dilatation of the tubules, haemocytes infiltration into the
   digestive gland and a decrement of neutral lipid levels in exposed
   mussels; similar results suggest a possible inhibition of the feeding
   activity, with a consequent induction of authophagic phenomena and
   utilization of stored reserve products such as neutral lipids.
   Antioxidant parameters revealed a limited role of O. cf. ovata to induce
   oxidative stress in mussels exposed under laboratory conditions
   excepting for a certain increase of catalase, glutathione reductase and
   glutathione peroxidases activities, and a significantly higher
   capability to neutralize peroxyl radicals in mussels exposed for 14
   days.
   Although the obtained results suggest a non-specific response of mussels
   to the O. cf. ovata exposure, observed effects on the general health
   status of exposed mussels should be adequately considered when assessing
   the ecological relevance of these algal blooms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {This study assessed the effects of dietary supplementation with extruded
   linseed on milk yield and composition, milk fatty acid (FA) profile and
   renal and hepatic metabolism of grazing goats in mid-lactation. Forty
   Saanen goats were divided into two isoproductive groups: one group was
   fed the control diet (CON) composed of hay and pelleted concentrate and
   the other group was supplemented with additional 180 g/day of extruded
   linseed (LIN; dry matter basis), which supplied 70 g/day of fat per head
   for 9 weeks, Animals grazed on pasture for similar to 3 h/day after the
   first of the 2 daily milkings. Milk samples were collected weekly and
   analyzed for fat, protein, lactose, milk urea nitrogen (MUN) and somatic
   cell count. Blood samples were collected every 2 weeks and analyzed for
   total bilirubin, creatinine, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine
   transaminase (ALT), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase,
   total protein and urea nitrogen. Milk yield was higher in the LIN than
   in the CON group (2369 v. 2052 g/day). LIN group had higher milk fat
   (37.7 v. 33.4 g/kg) and protein (30.7 v. 29.1 g/kg) concentration and
   lower MUN (35.0 v. 43.3 mg/dl) than CON group. Goats fed UN had greater
   proportions of 18:1 trans 11, 18:2 cis9trans11 and total polyunsatured
   fatty acids n-3 in milk fat, because of higher 18:3n-3 and 20:5n-3 FA,
   and lower proportions of short- and medium-chain FAs than goats fed CON.
   All kidney and liver function biomarkers in serum did not differ between
   dietary groups, except for AST and ALT, which tended to differ. Extruded
   linseed supplementation to grazing mid-lactating goats for 2 months can
   enhance the milk performance and nutritional profile of milk lipids,
   without altering the general hepatic and renal metabolism.},

Abstract = {Influenza A is a highly contagious respiratory virus in constant
   evolution and represents a threat to both veterinary and human public
   health. IA viruses (IAVs) originate in avian reservoirs but may adapt to
   humans, either directly or through the spillover to another mammalian
   species, to the point of becoming pandemic. IAVs must successfully be
   able to (i) transmit from animal to human, (ii) interact with host
   cells, and (iii) transmit from human to human. The mechanisms by which
   viruses evolve, cause zoonotic infections, and adapt to a new host
   species are indeed complex and appear to be a heterogeneous collection
   of viral evolutionary events rather than a single phenomenon. Progress
   has been made in identifying some of the genetic markers mainly
   associated with virulence and transmission; this achievement has
   improved our knowledge of how to manage a pandemic event and of how to
   identify IAVs with pandemic potential. Early evidence of emerging
   viruses and surveillance of animal IAVs is made possible only by
   strengthening the collaboration between the public and veterinary health
   sectors.},

Abstract = {A survey on 73 milk samples from different animal breeds and 24 dairy
   products samples from Sicily, Italy, was carried out for the presence of
   aflatoxin M-1 (AFM1) by LC-fluorescence detection after immunoaffinity
   cleanup. AFM1 was detected in 48\% and 42\% of the milk and dairy
   samples at concentration ranges between<5.0-16.0 and<5.0-18.0ngL(-1),
   respectively. Within the raw milk samples, 92\% had an AFM1 content
   below 5.0ngL(-1), in 7\% of the cases it was in the range
   5.0-10.0ngL(-1) and 1\% was contaminated between 10.0 and 20.0ngL(-1).
   For the dairy products, ultra-high-temperature treated (UHT) milk, milk
   cream and cheese, the incidence was 42\%, of which 83\% contained less
   than 5.0ngL(-1) and 17\% contained 10.0-20.0ngL(-1) AFM1. The levels of
   contamination found justify continuous monitoring for public health and

   biopreparedness. Animal botulism is underreported and under-diagnosed,
   but an increasing number of reports, as well as the information gathered
   from this workshop, show that it is an emerging problem in Europe. The
   workshop was divided into 4 sessions: animal botulism in Europe, the
   bacteria behind the disease, detection and diagnostics, and European
   collaboration and surveillance. An electronic survey was conducted
   before the workshop to identify the 3 most needed discussion points,
   which were: prevention, preparedness and outbreak response; detection
   and diagnostics; and European collaboration and surveillance. The main
   conclusions drawn from these discussions were that there is an urgent
   need to replace the mouse bioassay for botulinum toxin detection with an
   in vitro test and that there is a need for a European network to
   function as a reference laboratory, which could also organize a European
   supply of botulinum antitoxin and vaccines. The foundation of such a
   network was discussed, and the proposals are presented here along with
   the outcome of discussions and a summary of the workshop itself.},

Abstract = {The non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (NDL-PCBs) highly
   contribute to the PCB dietary intake of total PCBs. Most of the NDL-PCBs
   are assumed through ingestion of contaminated fish and fishery products.
   Therefore, it is important to quantify their presence in aquatic
   organisms to evaluate human risks associated with fish consumption. The
   European catfish is a top food-chain predator and is considered a
   reliable bio-monitoring tool reflecting the state of the environmental
   organic pollution. From 2006 to 2009, 54 European catfish were captured
   in four sites covering the area of the Po River (North Italy), and their
   muscles were analysed to determine the levels of 18 PCBs congeners. All
   samples presented detectable levels of 18 congeners and, on average,
   results showed an important presence of NDL-PCBs. The sum of the six
   congeners (28, 52, 101, 138, 153, 180 IUPAC) was used as indicator of
   the total PCBs concentration. The 33\% of the samples analysed exceeded
   the maximum levels of 125 ng g(-1) set by European regulations in fish.
   The values measured ranged from 19.7 to 1015.4 ng g(-1) (mean 135.6 +/-
   149.8 ng g(-1)).
   The concentrations of NDL-PCBs were not related to fish weight or sex,
   while a significant variability was found among sites (p < 0.05),
   according to the geographical location of many industrial activities in
   the catchment area of the Po River. PCB 153 and 138 were present in
   higher concentrations (40\% and 30\% respectively). We hypothesise that
   this is due to their high resistance to metabolic degradation. (C) 2013

Abstract = {Botulism disease in both humans and animals is a worldwide concern.
   Botulinum neurotoxins produced by Clostridium botulinum and other
   Clostridium species are the most potent biological substances known and
   are responsible for flaccid paralysis leading to a high mortality rate.
   Clostridium botulinum and botulinum neurotoxins are considered potential
   weapons for bioterrorism and have been included in the Australia Group
   List of Biological Agents. In 2010 the European Commission (DG Justice,
   Freedom and Security) funded a 3-year project named AniBioThreat to
   improve the EU's capacity to counter animal bioterrorism threats. A
   detection portfolio with screening methods for botulism agents and
   incidents was needed to improve tracking and tracing of accidental and
   deliberate contamination of the feed and food chain with botulinum
   neurotoxins and other Clostridia. The complexity of this threat required
   acquiring new genetic information to better understand the diversity of
   these Clostridia and develop detection methods targeting both highly
   specific genetic markers of these Clostridia and the neurotoxins they
   are able to produce. Several European institutes participating in the
   AniBioThreat project collaborated on this program to achieve these
   objectives. Their scientific developments are discussed here.},

Title = {Differences in the detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1

Abstract = {Previous studies have reported the detection of H5N1 HPAI virus in
   feathers from ducks naturally and experimentally infected and suggested
   that feather calami (FC) could be used as diagnostic samples for the
   early detection of H5N1 HPAI infections. Ducks are readily infected with
   H5N1 HPAI viruses although the development of clinical signs and deaths
   were reported as age-related with younger birds being more susceptible.
   The correlation between age and virus localisation in FC of infected
   ducks has not been studied to date.
   In the present study juvenile (4-week-old) and adult (24-week-old) Pekin
   ducks (Anas platyrhynchos var. domestica) were infected experimentally
   with a clade 2.2 H5N1 HPAI virus (A/duck/Nigeria/1071-23/2007). Tracheal
   (Tr) and cloacal (Cl) swabs and FC were collected at 3, 5, 7 and 10 days
   post infection and tested by RRT-PCR and a double antibody
   sandwich-ELISA (DAS-ELISA) developed in house.
   Virus was detected in swabs and FC of challenged ducks with a higher
   rate of detection in juvenile ducks. In this age group virus was
   detected over a longer period of time in FC compared to swabs.
   Our study showed that FC samples collected from young ducks are a valid
   diagnostic specimen for H5N1 HPAI virus detection. The DAS-ELISA on FC
   proved to be a suitable alternative diagnostic test when molecular
   and/or virus isolation techniques are not available therefore it could
   be useful in the diagnosis of H5N1 HPAI infections in under-resourced
   countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We identified a novel papillomavirus (CePV1) in a fibropapilloma of a
   1.5 year old male red deer (Cervus elaphus) shot in the Italian Alps in
   Brescia province. PV particles were first observed by electron
   microscopy and PV DNA was then identified by PCR using degenerate
   primers. Subsequently we cloned the entire genome and determined its
   complete sequence. CePV1 genome is 8009 bp long and contains all 9 ORFs
   and the long untranslated regulatory region characteristic for
   Delta-papillomaviruses. Pairwise nucleotide alignments and phylogenetic
   analyses based on concatenated E1-E2-L1 ORFs allowed to determine the
   highest similarity with the Capreolus caprelus papillomavirus CcaPV1.
   The analysis of the host-parasite phylogenetic tree interactions suggest
   the co-divergence of CePV1 and C elaphus while the identified
   topological incongruences leading us to speculate that CcaPV1 could
   eventually be the result of an earlier host switch event. (c) 2013

Abstract = {Aims: The purpose of this work is to evaluate the effects of
   (R-S)-glucoraphanin, a glucosinolate present in Brassicaceae, notably in
   Tuscan black kale, and bioactivated with myrosinase. enzyme (bioactive
   R-S-GRA) (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally), and to assess its capacity to
   prevent the dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a fundamental
   structure for brain homeostasis, in a mouse model of restraint stress.
   Main methods: CD1 mice were subjected to restraint stress by blocking
   the body with a tape on a table for 150 mm at the four extremities.
   After the sacrifice of the animals, stomachs and brains were collected
   to perform histological evaluation, Evan's blue dye,
   immunohistochemistry and, western blotting analysis, to evaluate whether
   immobilization stress leads to alterations of tight junction (TJ)
   components, such as claudin-1, claudin-3 and ZO-1.
   Key findings: Immobilization causes considerable damage to BBB as shown
   by detection of Evan's blue dye, indicating a high level of
   extravasation due to stress. BBB alterations were accompanied by an
   enhancement of GFAP expression, IkB-alpha degradation followed by
   increased NF-kBp65 nuclear translocation, as well as caspase 3
   overexpression. Conversely, our results revealed that bioactive R-S-GRA
   treatment significantly counteracts the changes in all these parameters
   and preserves TJ integrity reducing the production of pro-inflammatory
   cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, and increasing the
   production of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine.
   Additionally, bioactive R-S-GRA shows antioxidant properties modulating
   iNOS and nitrotyrosine expression.
   Significance: Our results clearly show that bioactive R-S-GRA could
   represent a possible treatment during pharmacological therapy of stress.

Title = {Efficacy of an imidacloprid/flumethrin collar against fleas, ticks and
   tick-borne pathogens in dogs},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {6},
Month = {AUG 23},
Abstract = {Background: Tick-borne diseases comprise a group of maladies that are of
   substantial medical and veterinary significance. A range of tick-borne
   pathogens, including diverse species of bacteria and protozoa, can
   infect both dogs and humans. Hence, the control of tick infestations is
   pivotal to decrease or prevent tick-borne pathogen transmission.
   Therefore, different commercial products with insecticidal, repellent or
   both properties have been developed for use on dogs. Recently, a collar
   containing a combination of imidacloprid 10\% and flumethrin 4.5\% has
   proven effective to prevent tick and flea infestations in dogs under
   field conditions and the infection by some vector-borne pathogens they
   transmit under laboratory-controlled conditions.
   Methods: From March 2011 to April 2012, a field study was conducted in a
   private shelter in southern Italy to assess the efficacy of the
   imidacloprid/flumethrin collar against tick and flea infestations and to
   determine if this strategy would decrease tick-borne pathogen
   transmission in young dogs. A total of 122 animals were enrolled in the
   study and randomly assigned to group A (n = 64; collared) or group B (n
   = 58; untreated controls). Dogs were examined monthly for ticks and
   fleas and systematically tested for selected tick-borne pathogens.
   Results: Compared to controls, the collar provided overall efficacies of
   99.7\% and 100\% against tick and flea infestation, respectively. The
   overall efficacy for the prevention of tick-borne pathogens (i.e.,
   Anaplasma platys and Babesia vogeli) was 91.6\%.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the imidacloprid/flumethrin
   collar is efficacious against flea and tick infestation as well as
   tick-borne pathogen transmission to dogs under field conditions.},

   Evidence for Genetic-Ecological Divergence?},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},

Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 19},
Abstract = {We modeled the ecological niche of a globally successful Bacillus
   anthracis sublineage in the United States, Italy and Kazakhstan to
   better understand the geographic distribution of anthrax and potential
   associations between regional populations and ecology. Country-specific
   ecological-niche models were developed and reciprocally transferred to
   the other countries to determine if pathogen presence could be
   accurately predicted on novel landscapes. Native models accurately
   predicted endemic areas within each country, but transferred models
   failed to predict known occurrences in the outside countries. While the
   effects of variable selection and limitations of the genetic data should
   be considered, results suggest differing ecological associations for the
   B. anthracis populations within each country and may reflect niche
   specialization within the sublineage. Our findings provide guidance for
   developing accurate ecological niche models for this pathogen; models
   should be developed regionally, on the native landscape, and with
   consideration to population genetics. Further genomic analysis will
   improve our understanding of the genetic-ecological dynamics of B.
   anthracis across these countries and may lead to more refined predictive
   models for surveillance and proactive vaccination programs. Further
   studies should evaluate the impact of variable selection of native and
   transferred models.},

Title = {Stability properties of PrPSc from cattle with experimental
   transmissible spongiform encephalopathies: use of a rapid whole
   homogenate, protease-free assay},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Background: Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs), including
   scrapie in sheep, chronic wasting disease (CWD) in cervids,
   transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME), and bovine spongiform
   encephalopathy (BSE), are fatal diseases of the nervous system
   associated with accumulation of misfolded prion protein (PrPSc).
   Different strains of TSEs exist, associated with different PrPSc
   conformations that can be probed by the stability assay, in which PrPSc
   is treated with increasing concentrations of the denaturant guanidine
   hydrochloride (GdnHCl).
   Results: Here, we provide the first comprehensive application of a
   rapid, protease-free version of the GdnHCl stability assay to brain
   tissue from cattle experimentally infected with various TSE isolates.
   Consistent with previous findings from a single Japanese isolate, the
   L-type isolates of BSE are not distinguishable from classical BSE in
   this assay. In contrast, H-type isolates of BSE, including our unique
   isolate of E211K BSE, exhibit higher stability than classical BSE,
   suggesting that its increased protection against protease digestion at
   the BSE N-terminus is associated with a higher stability in GdnHCl.
   While the difference in stability in our version of the assay is likely
   not large enough for effective use in a diagnostic laboratory setting,
   the use of alternative experimental conditions may enhance this effect.
   TSEs from other natural host species that have been passaged in cattle,
   including CWD and TME, were not distinguishable from classical BSE,
   while isolates of cattle passaged scrapie exhibited a slight increase in
   stability as compared to classical BSE.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that the core of PrPSc, as probed in
   this assay, has similar stability properties among cattle-passaged TSE
   isolates and that the conformational differences that lead to changes in
   the proteinase K cleavage site do not cause large changes in the
   stability of PrPSc from TSE-affected cattle. However, the stability
   differences observed here will provide a basis of comparison for new
   isolates of atypical BSE observed in the future and in other geographic
   locations, especially in the case of H-type BSE.},

Abstract = {We have recently demonstrated that an attenuated strain of Salmonella
   enterica serovar Typhimurium unable to synthesize the zinc transporter
   ZnuABC (S. Typhimurium Delta znuABC), is able to protect mice against
   systemic and enteric salmonellosis and is safe in pigs. Here, we have
   tested the protective effects of S. Typhimurium Delta znuABC in pigs.
   Resistance to challenge with the fully virulent strain S. Typhimurium
   ATCC 14028 was assessed in animals vaccinated with S. Typhimurium Delta
   znuABC (two dosages tested), in controls vaccinated with a
   formalin-inactivated virulent strain and in unvaccinated controls.
   Clinical signs of salmonellosis, faecal shedding and bacterial
   colonization of organs were used to assess vaccine-induced protection.
   After the challenge, pigs vaccinated with the attenuated S. Typhimurium
   Delta znuABC strain did not display clinical signs of salmonellosis
   (fever or diarrhoea). The vaccine also reduced intestinal tract
   colonization and faecal shedding of the fully virulent Salmonella
   strain, as compared to control groups. S. Typhimurium Delta znuABC
   represents a promising candidate vaccine against salmonellosis in pigs.

Abstract = {This paper reports a simple and reliable mass spectrometry hyphenated
   chromatographic method for ochratoxin A determination in hard cheese.
   The method is based on a simple extraction using an acetonitrile: water
   (84:16, v/v) solution acidified with 2.5\% acetic acid. After a
   defatting step with n-hexane, the extract was directly analysed by
   LC-MS/MS without any further clean-up step. The method showed good
   linearity and specificity, and it was in-house validated in the range of
   1-16 mu g/kg, resulting in 93.75\% mean overall recovery (confidence
   interval 1.36\%) and 3.42\% coefficient of variatioin (CV). The
   analytical performances were also satisfactory in terms of sensitivity
   (limit of quantification = 1 mu g/kg); although no legal limits have
   been set up for cheese, this value is consistent with the tolerances
   fixed for other regulated foods. Preliminary results on 40 commercial
   samples of grated hard cheese are presented.},

Abstract = {Raw milk consumption in Italy has increased over the past three years
   following the enactment of a national law that allows the sale of
   unpacked and unpasteurized cows' milk via vending machines on the farm
   and at markets. From 2009 to 2011, a three-part monitoring survey of raw
   milk sold though vending machines was carried out to investigate for the
   occurrence of Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli O:157, Campylobacter
   spp. and Listeria monocytogenes. A total of 618 raw milk samples were
   collected from 112 dairy herds supplying 131 raw milk vending machines.
   Of the samples tested, 0.3\% were positive for Salmonella spp., 0.2\%
   for E. coli O:157, 1.5\% for Campylobacter spp., and 1.6\% for Listeria
   monocytogens. Multivariate analysis showed no effect of seasonality,
   average daily temperature, herd size, sample collection point or
   distance between herd and vending machine; however, there was a
   statistically significant correlation between a previous finding of
   pathogens and recurrence of contamination. The monitoring survey results
   confirm that unpasteurized milk can be a vehicle of a variety of
   microorganisms and an important source of foodborne illness outbreaks.

   Infantis although no sign of salmonellosis (e.g. diarrhoea) was shown.
   This is believed to be the first report of Salmonella spp. infection in

Abstract = {Twenty-four Salmonella enterica isolates (13 serovar Enteritidis and 11
   Typhimurium) isolated from 5,600 samples from intensive laying hen farms
   in Italy in 1998-2007 were characterized for antimicrobial resistance
   genes, pulsotype and phage type. Most of S. Typhimurium strains were
   pulsotype STYMXB. 0147 (81.8\%), phage type DT143 and resistant to
   sulfamethoxazole encoded by sul2. Two multidrug resistant (MDR) strains
   were identified. One strain, STYMXB. 0061, was resistant to ampicillin
   (A), chloramphenicol (C), streptomycin (S), sulfamethoxazole (Su) and
   tetracycline (T) encoded by the Salmonella Genomic Island SGI1. The
   second MDR strain, STYMXB. 0110, was resistant to SSuT encoded by sul1
   and sul2, aadA1 and tet(C)-flanked by an IS26 element, respectively. The
   tet(C) gene has been reported to confer low levels of resistance and it
   has very rarely been detected in S. Typhimurium from poultry. In the
   current study, the MIC value (32 mu g/mL) was consistent with the
   breakpoint (>= 16 mu g/mL) reported for Enterobacteriaceae. Most of the
   S. Enteritidis strains were resistant to Su (encoded by sul2). One MDR
   strain (ANxSSuT) was identified. With the exception of nalidixic acid
   (Nx), the resistances were respectively encoded by bla(TEM), strAB, sul2
   and tet(A) harbored by an IncN conjugative plasmid. All isolates were
   pulsotype SENTXB.0001 with PT14b being the most prevalent identified
   phage type (57.1\%). In Europe, SENTXB. 0001 is the predominant PFGE
   profile from clinical cases and the identification of PT14b has steadily
   been on the increase since 2001. The findings presented in this study
   highlight the potential spread of S. Enteritidis phage types PT14b and
   S. Typhimurium DT143 in a field of particular relevance for zoonoses.
   Additional, the presence of resistance genes and genetic elements
   (conjugative plasmid and IS element) underlines the need to assess
   routinely studies in field, such as poultry farms, relevant fot the
   public health and suitable for the storage and diffusion of
   antimicrobial resistance.},

Abstract = {We report the clinical, pathogenetic and immunological features of the
   infection caused by a novel bovine pestivirus, namely Hobi virus or
   bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) type 3, in Italy. This emerging
   pestivirus, first detected more than 10 years ago in a commercial batch
   of foetal bovine serum produced in Brazil, has been reported so far only
   in southern America and Asia. In 2010, Hobi-like viruses were detected
   in Italy in association with outbreaks of respiratory disease and
   reproductive failures occurring in a cattle herd of the Calabria region.
   A virus pair consisting of cytopathogenic (cp) and noncytopathogenic
   (ncp) BVDV-3 was isolated from a heifer dead as a consequence of
   respiratory distress. At the genetic level the two viruses differed for
   the presence in the cp strain of an insertion displaying high similarity
   to a bovine sequence previously associated to other cp BVDVs. By
   screening the cattle herd affected by clinical forms induced by the
   novel pestivirus, a BVDV-3 persistently infected (PI) calf was detected,
   which was monitored for about 6 months with regards to clinical
   conditions, viremia and viral shedding. Experimental infection of
   cattle, sheep and swine showed that BVDV-3 is able to infect all those
   species, although only ruminants displayed clinical signs and virus
   shedding. The poor serological cross-reactivity existing between BVDV-1
   and BVDV-3, which was assessed in the sheep model, raised some concerns
   about the ability of currently available vaccines, mostly containing
   BVDV-1, to protect effectively against the new pestiviral species. To
   overcome the limitations of available diagnostic assays, a new tool
   (nested PCR) was developed which ensures unambiguous molecular
   characterisation of all BVDV species, including BVDV-3, in clinical
   samples. Future studies will assess the real circulation of this
   pestivirus in Italian cattle herds and evaluate the BVDV-3 impact on
   animal productions.},

Abstract = {Foodborne disease caused by Salmonella represents a worldwide public
   health problem. In Europe, salmonellosis is still the second most
   commonly recorded zoonosis. Since the standard culture method for
   detecting Salmonella (ISO 6579:2002) requires up to 5 days to produce
   results, the need to develop rapid methods represents an important issue
   for the authorities and the producers. The aim of the present study was
   the in-house validation, according to ISO 16140, of an open-formula
   diagnostic real-time PCR for the detection of Salmonella in all the
   different meat categories reported in the EU Regulations relative to
   microbiological criteria for food safety. The assay employed specific
   primers and a probe target within the ttrRSBCA locus, which allows the
   tetrathionate respiration in Salmonella. Selectivity, relative accuracy,
   relative sensitivity and relative specificity were established by
   testing 110 bacterial strains and 175 various edible meat samples.
   Results showed 100 \% selectivity, 100 \% relative accuracy, 100 \%
   relative sensitivity and 100 \% relative specificity of the real-time
   PCR when compared to the standard culture method used as reference. In
   addition, in order to minimize the effect of the competitive micro-flora
   naturally present on meat samples, a highly nutritious and selective
   commercial medium (ONE Broth Salmonella, Oxoid) was evaluated in
   comparison with the classical non-selective pre-enrichment broth
   (buffered peptone water). Results demonstrated that the ONE Broth
   Salmonella medium increases the growth of Salmonella in the presence of
   competitive micro-flora.},

Title = {A de novo X;8 translocation creates a PTK2-THOC2 gene fusion with THOC2

Abstract = {Background and aim We identified a balanced de novo translocation
   involving chromosomes Xq25 and 8q24 in an eight year-old girl with a
   non-progressive form of congenital ataxia, cognitive impairment and
   cerebellar hypoplasia.
   Methods and Results Breakpoint definition showed that the promoter of
   the Protein Tyrosine Kinase 2 (PTK2, also known as Focal Adhesion
   Kinase, FAK) gene on chromosome 8q24.3 is translocated 2 kb upstream of
   the THO complex subunit 2 (THOC2) gene on chromosome Xq25. PTK2 is a
   well-known non-receptor tyrosine kinase whereas THOC2 encodes a
   component of the evolutionarily conserved multiprotein THO complex,
   involved in mRNA export from nucleus. The translocation generated a
   sterile fusion transcript under the control of the PTK2 promoter,
   affecting expression of both PTK2 and THOC2 genes. PTK2 is involved in
   cell adhesion and, in neurons, plays a role in axonal guidance, and
   neurite growth and attraction. However, PTK2 haploinsufficiency alone is
   unlikely to be associated with human disease. Therefore, we studied the
   role of THOC2 in the CNS using three models: 1) THOC2 ortholog knockout
   in C.elegans which produced functional defects in specific sensory
   neurons; 2) Thoc2 knockdown in primary rat hippocampal neurons which
   increased neurite extension; 3) Thoc2 knockdown in neuronal stem cells
   (LC1) which increased their in vitro growth rate without modifying
   apoptosis levels.
   Conclusion We suggest that THOC2 can play specific roles in neuronal
   cells and, possibly in combination with PTK2 reduction, may affect
   normal neural network formation, leading to cognitive impairment and
   cerebellar congenital hypoplasia.},

Title = {Protective Role of (R-S)-glucoraphanin Bioactivated with Myrosinase in
   an Experimental Model of Multiple Sclerosis},

Abstract = {AimThe discovery of new natural compounds with pharmacological
   properties is a field of interest widely growing. Recent literature
   shows that Brassica vegetables (Cruciferae) possess therapeutic effects
   particularly ascribed due to their content in glucosinolates, which upon
   myrosinase hydrolysis release the corresponding isothiocyanates. This
   study examines the potential neuroprotective and immunomodulatory
   effects of (R-S)-glucoraphanin from Tuscan black kale (Brassica oleracea
   L. var. acephala sabellica) bioactivated with myrosinase (bioactive
   R-S-GRA) (10mg/kg/day intraperitoneally), in an experimental autoimmune
   encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis.
   MethodsEAE was induced by immunization with myelin oligodendroglial
   glycoprotein peptide (MOG(35-55)) in mice. After immunization, mice were
   observed daily for signs of EAE and weight loss. Clinical score was
   evaluated using a standardized scoring system.
   ResultsBy Western blot analysis of spinal cord tissues, we have
   demonstrated that treatment with bioactive R-S-GRA significantly
   decreased nuclear factor (NF)-kB translocation, pro-inflammatory
   cytokine production such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), and apoptosis (Bax and
   caspase 3 expression).
   ConclusionOur results clearly demonstrate that bioactive R-S-GRA
   treatment may represent a useful therapeutic perspective in the
   treatment of this disease.},

Abstract = {Adipose tissue as a stem cell source is ubiquitously available and has
   several advantages compared to other sources, for example it is easily
   accessible in large quantities with minimal invasive harvesting
   procedure, and isolation of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells
   (MSCs) yields a high amount of stem cells, essential for stem cell-based
   therapies and tissue engineering. We have explored the effect of donor
   age, and the anatomical origin of the adipose tissue on several aspects
   of MSCs in dogs, such as cell yield, proliferative ability,
   multi-differentiation potential, colony-forming capacity, stemness
   marker expression. We also assessed the effect of cell passaging on the
   MSCs stemness. We found that the anatomical origin of the adipose tissue
   and the age of donors have effects only on the proliferative capacity of
   the MSCs. Moreover, cells show a progressive loss of the stemness
   characteristics with passages. Cell therapies need a suitable number of
   cells to use in clinical applications. Characterization of MSCs at
   different passages, allowed us to demonstrate that, under our culture
   conditions, the best quantitative and qualitative characteristics are
   obtained at early passages. Adult MSCs are of particular interest for
   the therapeutic approach to musculoskeletal diseases, and the dog
   provides an excellent preclinical model for the development of new
   approaches in regenerative medicine that might be applied to humans.},

Title = {The mycotic abortion in cattle},
Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Pages = {155-161},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Abortion can determine significant production losses in cattle breeding.
   Several viral, bacterial, protozoal and fungal organisms, as well as
   management and genetic factors, can be listed among the causes of bovine
   abortion. Veterinarians usually pay particular attention to infective
   abortions of epizootic nature. Despite fungi being involved in bovine
   abortions, they are not commonly included in diagnostic protocols.
   Various factors contribute to the underestimation of the involvement of
   such pathogens including their sporadic nature (the disease rarely
   affects more than one or two animals in a herd), the lack of
   characteristic clinical symptoms in dams and foetuses (with the
   exception of retained placentas) and their diagnostic complexity
   requiring multiple approaches (mycological culture, microscopical
   examination of potassium hydroxide-treated tissue imprints,
   histopathology, etc).
   In cattle, abortion associated with mycotic placentitis is mainly due to
   infections caused by opportunistic filamentous fungi including
   Aspergillus fumigatus, other Aspergillus species and zygomycetes
   (Absidia, Mortierella, Rhizopus) or yeasts such as Candida sp.
   To date, mycotic abortion can't be prevented; in uterus disinfection
   treatments can be reccomended to reduce the risk of complications. The
   only useful suggestion to limit the frequency of abortive events is to
   influence the factors involved in mycotic abortion by applying direct
   prophylaxis measures to reduce the receptivity of the host (biotic
   factors) and to improve the quality of food, shelter, etc (abiotic
   factors). In this paper the aim of the Authors is to highlight the main
   etio-pathogenetic, epidemiological, clinical and diagnostic aspects of
   mycotic abortions occurring in cattle, in order to increase the
   awareness to this event and to suggest specific strategies for its
   prevention. Furthermore, the Authors wish to revitalize the interest in
   this particular scientific field, often underestimated in veterinary
   medicine.},

Volume = {60},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Since 2008, West Nile Virus (WNV) has expanded its range in several
   Italian regions, and its yearly recurrence suggests the virus may have
   become endemic in some areas. In 2011, a new plan based also on the
   detection of IgM antibodies was implemented in the north-eastern Italian
   regions of Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia, aiming to early detect WNV
   infections in areas where the virus had already circulated during the
   previous summers, and in adjacent zones. From July to November 2011,
   1880 sera from 521 equine premises were screened by a commercial IgM
   capture ELISA. Mosquitoes were captured by CDC-CO2 traps at 61 locations
   in the two regions. Collected mosquitoes were identified, pooled by
   species/date/location and examined by real-time RT-PCR and sequencing.
   Passive surveillance was carried out on clinically affected horses and
   non-migratory wild birds found dead. IgM sero-positive equines were
   detected in 19 holdings, five in the area with WNV circulation (AWC) and
   14 in the surveillance area (SA); 10 more horse premises tested positive
   to further serological controls within 4km of the positive holdings. A
   total of 85398 mosquitoes of 15 species were collected and 2732 pools
   examined. Five Culex pipiens pools tested positive for the presence of
   WNV. Passive surveillance on non-migratory wild birds allowed detection
   of the virus only in one found dead collared dove (Streptopelia
   decaocto), of 82 birds sampled. The WNV belonged to the lineage 2, which
   had been isolated for the first time in Italy earlier in 2011. By the
   first week of October, nine human cases had been confirmed in the same
   area. The implementation of a protocol combining IgM screening of horses
   with surveillance on mosquito vectors proved to be valuable for early
   detecting WNV circulation.},

Abstract = {The objective of this work was to investigate the expression of heat
   shock protein 70 (HSP70) by Western blot (WB) in swine liver.
   Subsequently, the study aimed to apply this method to two experimental
   groups of heavy pigs raised in different confinement systems:
   intensive/indoor (Group A) and extensive/outdoor (Group B). Thirty-six
   crossbred commercial heavy pigs were divided as follows: Group A (eight
   castrated males and eight females) was equally distributed into two
   single-sex indoor pens (1.02m(2)/pig); Group B (11 castrated males and
   nine females) was kept in one single (partially grassy and partially
   wooded) open area of about 6000m(2). Group A was slaughtered at 41 weeks
   of age (170 +/- 9 kg) and Group B at 48 weeks of age (172 +/- 13 kg). At
   the abattoir the livers of all the animals were collected and analyzed
   by WB assay in order to quantify the levels of HSP70. Moreover, a
   further liver sample was taken from the same animals in order to
   investigate the cellular localization of HSP70 by immunohistochemistry
   (IHC). The interaction between sex and group resulted statistically
   significant (P = 0.001). When stratified by sex, Group A showed
   significantly higher HSP70 values compared with Group B for both male
   and female subjects (P < 0.001). Stratifying by group, males showed
   significantly higher HSP70 values than females in Group A (P < 0.001),
   whereas no statistical differences were observed between sexes for Group
   B (P = 0.653). The IHC results evidenced cytoplasmic immunoreactivity in
   a granular pattern in both groups. The different expression pattern
   observed by WB could prove to be a useful tool in the assessment of pig
   health and welfare.},

Title = {Prevalence assessment of Coxiella burnetii and verocytotoxin-producing

Abstract = {Raw milk has become increasingly appreciated by consumers and in the EU
   there is general acceptance of this product, the sale of which is
   regulated by EU Directives. However, unpasteurised milk can be
   contaminated by zoonotic agents, thus representing a risk for human
   health. The aim of our work was the assessment of Coxiella burnetii and
   verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) presence in bovine bulk
   tank milk of Marche region (Central Italy) destined to direct human
   consumption. PCR and real-time PCR well-established protocols have been
   used for pathogen identification, showing high sensitivity and
   specificity. C. burnetii prevalence was 27\%, while VTEC serogroup were
   found as follows: 3.5\% for both 0157 and 0145; 2.3\% for 026; 4.7\% for
   O103. In contrast, the immunomagnetic separation-based protocol (IMS)
   was able to identify only one sample (1.2\%) contaminated by VTEC O157.
   These results indicate that a combination of real-time PCR and IMS
   proved to be more appropriate for VTEC serogroup identification, thanks
   to improved sensitivity. Moreover, the prevalence of these pathogens
   would suggest that non-O157 VTEC and C. burnetii should be included
   among microbiological criteria for raw milk, implementing control
   strategies to limit possible negative impact to consumers' health. (C)

Abstract = {The use of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) in orthopedic practice has
   recently and rapidly acquired an important role. Therapies based on the
   use of MSCs for the treatment of acute injuries as well as chronic
   inflammatory disorders are gradually becoming clinical routine. These
   cells have demonstrated intriguing therapeutic potentialities (i.e.:
   inflammation control, tissue regeneration and pathological scar
   prevention), that have been taken into-consideration for use in both
   human and veterinary medicine. In particular, horses represent high
   performance athletes considered models for human pathologies since
   musculo-skeletal disorders frequently occur in this species. In the
   past, repair of tendon injures were performed by different methods. In
   particular, clinical therapy was based on ice application, bandage, box
   rest and controlled exercise. An alternative approach consisted on the
   use of corticosteroid (inflammation reduction) and other drugs (sodium
   hyaluronate, polysulphated glycosaminoglycans, beta aminoproprionitrile
   fumarate). Furthermore, surgical treatments like accessory ligament
   desmotomy, local irritation by line firing or pin firing were commonly
   used. More recently ultrasound, laser therapy, electromagnetic field
   therapy have been considered. Unfortunately, they did not allow complete
   tissue healing and quite often animals did not regain competitiveness.
   In order to minimize this inconvenience, the use of MSCs has been
   introduced as an alternative to the traditional approach since it
   represents a potential tool to improve tissue regeneration.
   Aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of MSCs to improve the
   functional outcome of horses affected by tendonitis and desmitis.
   Thirty-three breed and activity-matched horses affected by tendonitis or
   desmitis, were included in clinical trial scored for lesions and
   subdivided into two groups. Group 1 animals were treated with autologous
   MSCs, associated with platelet rich plasma (group 1). Bone marrow
   samples were collected from the sternum of the treated horses and
   processed in order to isolate MSCs. Following cell therapy, they were
   subjected to a rehabilitation period and their ability to resume
   training was evaluated. In this study, implanted MSCs caused no adverse
   reactions and thirteen out of the eighteen inoculated horses returned to
   race competitions. On the contrary, no improvement was seen in the
   twelve animals of group 2 treated with pin firing, that were not able to
   resume sport activity. In conclusion the clinical trial proves the
   safety of equine bone-marrow derived MSCs and a successful outcome of
   the treated animals that returned to their previous level of sport
   activity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A pilot study was implemented in the Veneto Region of Italy, aimed at
   classifying dairy farms which produce milk to be commercialised
   unpasteurised on the basis of their risk of faecal contamination of
   milk, which is directly correlated to the probability of a foodborne
   pathogen, if present in the herd and eliminated through faecal
   excretion, to contaminate the raw product. Factors considered to be
   relevant in the definition of the risk of pathogens potentially present
   in animal faeces to be transmitted to milk, were hierarchically
   structured, weighted through the application of experts elicitation
   methods (Analytic Hierarchy Process, Delphi) and used to categorise
   farms through the application of a herd questionnaire. The probability
   of faecal contamination of milk, and thus the risk of pathogens transfer
   appears to be modulated more by farm management than by the structure of
   the farm or the health status of the herd. Such a method, combined with
   the microbiological evaluation of the prevalence of faecal excretion of
   such pathogens, can be used to implement a risk-based surveillance
   programme and to apply targeted control measures. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Blood investigations in French young beef cattle before exportation to
   fattening farms in Italy},
Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {19},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Introduction - Every year Italy imports from France more than 850,000
   young beef cattle reared at pasture, called ``broutard{''}, for
   fattening in specialized farms. The main health losses in these farms
   are due to `` bovine respiratory disease complex{''} (BRDC), involving
   animals generally in the first weeks of the production cycle. BRDC is a
   multifactorial disease where a great number of risk factors, able to
   decrease defensive capacity of the animals and increase exposure to
   pathogens, play a major role.
   Aim - The purpose of this study was to evaluate, through surveys on
   blood samples taken from calves prior to export from France, some of the
   factors that can affect the immune defenses of the animals.
   Materials and methods - We studied the amount of copper and zinc in
   serum, the activity of the erythrocyte GSHPx, the amount of total
   thyroxine (T4), the rate of hemoglobin, the amount of total protein and
   gamma-globulin, the presence of antibodies against BHV1 and BRSV and the
   presence of animals viremic with BVDV. 293 calves from 12 Departments
   and 8 Regions of France were included in the study.
   Results and discussion - Animals with values below the reference values
   were 80.5\% for copper, 76.2\% for zinc, 78.1\% for GSH-PXE, 30.7\% for
   hemoglobin and 78.8\% for gamma-globulins. Normal values were found for
   T4 and total serum protein. Only 3.1\% of the subjects were positive for
   antibodies against BHV1. For BRSV, 23.9\% of the samples were
   seropositive. No calf was identified as viremic with BVDV.
   Conclusions - During this study, a copper, zinc and selenium deficiency
   was found in most of the subjects tested. According to these data, a
   specific supplementation of the diet of beef cattle kept on pasture in
   France is advisable. The high number of seronegative calves for BHV1 and
   BRSV suggests the application of an adequate isolation of the animals
   upon arrival in the fattening units and their rapid immunization against
   these two viruses.},

Abstract = {Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus that re-emerged
   in 2004 and has caused massive outbreaks in recent years. The lack of a
   licensed vaccine or treatment options emphasize the need to obtain more
   insight into the viral life cycle and CHIKV-host interactions.
   Infectious cDNA clones are important tools for such studies, and for
   mechanism of action studies on antiviral compounds. Existing CHIKV cDNA
   clones are based on a single genome from an individual clinical isolate,
   which is expected to have evolved specific characteristics in response
   to the host environment, and possibly also during subsequent cell
   culture passaging. To obtain a virus expected to have the general
   characteristics of the recent E1-226V CHIKV isolates, we have
   constructed a new CHIKV full-length cDNA clone, CHIKV LS3, based on the
   consensus sequence of their aligned genomes. Here we report the
   characterization of this synthetic virus and a green fluorescent
   protein-expressing variant (CHIKV LS3-GFP). Their characteristics were
   compared to those of natural strain ITA07-RA1, which was isolated during
   the 2007 outbreak in Italy. In cell culture the synthetic viruses
   displayed phenotypes comparable to the natural isolate, and in a mouse
   model they caused lethal infections that were indistinguishable from
   infections with a natural strain. Compared to ITA07-RA1 and clinical
   isolate NL10/152, the synthetic viruses displayed similar sensitivities
   to several antiviral compounds. 3-deaza-adenosine was identified as a
   new inhibitor of CHIKV replication. Cyclosporin A had no effect on CHIKV
   replication, suggesting that cyclophilins - opposite to what was found
   for other +RNA viruses- do not play an essential role in CHIKV
   replication. The characterization of the consensus sequence-based
   synthetic viruses and their comparison to natural isolates demonstrated
   that CHIKV LS3 and LS3-GFP are suitable and representative tools to
   study CHIKV-host interactions, screen for antiviral compounds and
   unravel their mode of action.},

Abstract = {A trial was conducted to assess the efficacy of eprinomectin (EPR)
   against the sucking louse Haematopinus asini on naturally infested
   donkeys. Parasitological investigations were performed on fifteen
   animals. On day 0, donkeys received EPR pour-on at the manufacturer's
   recommended cattle dose. Louse counts were performed on days 1, 7, 14,
   21, 28, 35, 42,49 and 56 at seven predilection sites on the skin of each
   donkey. EPR was completely effective (100\%) from day 7, until the end
   of the study. Clinically no adverse reactions were observed in any of
   donkeys treated. EPR was considered to be 100\% effective against H.
   asini. This is the first trial to evaluate the efficacy of EPR against a
   natural louse infestation in donkeys. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Tuberculosis Epidemiology in Islands: Insularity, Hosts and Trade},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Because of their relative simplicity and the barriers to gene flow,
   islands are ideal systems to study the distribution of biodiversity.
   However, the knowledge that can be extracted from this peculiar
   ecosystem regarding epidemiology of economically relevant diseases has
   not been widely addressed. We used information available in the
   scientific literature for 10 old world islands or archipelagos and
   original data on Sicily to gain new insights into the epidemiology of
   the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC). We explored three
   nonexclusive working hypotheses on the processes modulating bovine
   tuberculosis (bTB) herd prevalence in cattle and MTC strain diversity:
   insularity, hosts and trade. Results suggest that bTB herd prevalence
   was positively correlated with island size, the presence of wild hosts,
   and the number of imported cattle, but neither with isolation nor with
   cattle density. MTC strain diversity was positively related with cattle
   bTB prevalence, presence of wild hosts and the number of imported
   cattle, but not with island size, isolation, and cattle density. The
   three most common spoligotype patterns coincided between Sicily and
   mainland Italy. However in Sicily, these common patterns showed a
   clearer dominance than on the Italian mainland, and seven of 19 patterns
   (37\%) found in Sicily had not been reported from continental Italy.
   Strain patterns were not spatially clustered in Sicily. We were able to
   infer several aspects of MTC epidemiology and control in islands and
   thus in fragmented host and pathogen populations. Our results point out
   the relevance of the intensity of the cattle commercial networks in the
   epidemiology of MTC, and suggest that eradication will prove more
   difficult with increasing size of the island and its environmental
   complexity, mainly in terms of the diversity of suitable domestic and
   wild MTC hosts.},

Abstract = {Avian influenza viruses of the H9N2 subtype have circulated in the
   poultry population in Asia, Far and Middle East since the mid-1990s. One
   of the most widespread lineages established in poultry is the G1
   lineage. This lineage has undergone further evolution and reassortment
   since its first detection in 1997 and G1-like H9N2 viruses still
   circulate. In this study we have investigated the susceptibility of
   quail and turkeys to the H9N2 G1-lineage prototype strain (A/quail/Hong
   Kong/G1/97). Contact transmission experiments were carried out in both
   avian species. Animals were infected oro-nasally with increasing doses
   of the virus (10(3)-10(6) EID50/0.1 ml) and sentinel birds were
   introduced 4 days post infection (pi) in each experimental group. Quail
   were more susceptible than turkeys, as they were readily infected with
   lower challenge doses. Interestingly, infection of turkeys was
   associated with worse clinical condition. Transmission was detected in
   both species. Quail infected with a dose less than or equal to 10(4)
   EID50 transmitted the virus to the sentinels without showing any signs
   of disease. These findings reinforce the hypothesis that quail may
   ensure the perpetuation of H9N2 viruses in poultry, acting as a silent
   reservoir. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The real and perceived impact of influenza infections in animals has
   changed dramatically over the last 10 years, due mainly to the better
   understanding of the public health implications of avian and swine
   influenza viruses. On a number of occasions in the last decade
   avian-to-human transmissions of H5, H7 and H9 virus subtypes have
   occurred, and the first influenza pandemic of the new millennium
   occurred as a result of the emergence and spread of a virus from pigs.
   Although the mechanisms that allow influenza viruses to jump from one
   host species to another are not fully understood, several genetic
   signatures linked to the crossing of species barriers have been
   identified. This has led to a re-evaluation of the importance of
   understanding these viruses in the animal reservoir, to the extent that
   millions of euros have been invested in surveillance, research and
   capacity building worldwide. This has resulted in an enhanced
   collaboration with our medical counterparts, leading to many discoveries
   that will contribute to an understanding of the complex mechanisms that
   lead to the emergence of a pandemic virus. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {To improve the efficiency of the National equine infectious anaemia
   (EIA) surveillance program in Italy, a three-tiered diagnostic system
   has been adopted. This procedure involves initial screening by ELISA
   (Tier 1) with test-positive samples confirmed by the agar gel
   immunodiffusion test (AGIDT) (Tier 2) and, in the case of ELISA
   positive/AGIDT negative results, final determination by immunoblot (IB)
   (Tier 3). During this evaluation, 74,880 samples, principally collected
   from two Regions of Central Italy (Latium and Abruzzo) were examined,
   with 44 identified as negative in AGIDT but positive in both ELISA and
   IB. As the majority of these reactions occurred in mules, an
   observational study was conducted in this hybrid equid species to
   investigate if there is a correlation between plasma-associated viral
   loads and serological reactivity, to test the hypothesis that
   false-negative or very weak positive AGIDT results are associated with
   elite control of EIA virus (EIAV) replication accompanied by reduced
   transmission risks. The study animals consisted of 5 mules with positive
   AGIDT readings, along with another 5 giving negative or very weak
   positive results in this test. All mules were seropositive in Elisa and
   IB. Samples were collected routinely during an initial 56-day
   observation period, prior to dexamethasone treatment lasting 10 days, to
   determine the effect of immune suppression (IS) on clinical, humoral and
   virological responses. All mules were monitored for a further 28 days
   from day 0 of IS. None of the animals experienced relevant clinical
   responses before IS and there were no significant changes in antibody
   levels in ELISA, IB or AGIDT. However, plasma-associated viral-RNA
   (vRNA) loads, as determined using TaqMan (R) based RT-PCR, showed
   unexpectedly high sample to sample variation in all mules, demonstrating
   host-mediated control of viral replication is not constant over time.
   Furthermore, there was no apparent correlation between vRNA loads and
   antibody reactivity in serological tests. Analysis of PCR products
   established all mules were infected with viruses possessing nucleotide
   sequence similarity, varying from 77 to 96\%, to previously identified
   European EIAV strains. Following IS, all mules showed increases in
   plasma-associated vRNA loads, suggesting control of EIAV replication is
   mediated by immune responses in this hybrid species. However, only three
   mules showed anamnestic humoral responses to rises in viral loads, as
   defined by at least a four-fold increase in ELISA titre, while two
   remained AGIDT-negative. This study demonstrates that viral loads in
   equids with consistent ELISA/IB positive-AGIDT negative to very weak
   positive test results (Group N) can be equivalent to those that produce
   clearly positive results in all three serologic tests (Group P).
   Therefore, such animals do not pose inherently lower risks for the
   transmission of EIAV. Consequently, the exclusive use of the AGIDT, as
   prescribed by the World Organization of Animal Health (OIE) for
   diagnosis of EIA prior to the international movement of horses, can
   report as negative some EIAV-infected equids. These results dramatically
   underscore the necessity of combining the specificity of AGIDT with
   tests with higher sensitivity, such as the ELISA and the power of the IB
   to enhance the accuracy of EIA diagnosis. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Ground Anthrax Bacillus Refined Isolation (GABRI) method for analyzing
   environmental samples with low levels of Bacillus anthracis
   contamination},

Abstract = {Background: In this work are reported the results of a qualitative
   analytical method capable of detecting Bacillus anthracis spores when
   they are present in very low concentration in the soil. The Ground
   Anthrax Bacillus Refined Isolation (GABRI) method, assessed in our
   laboratory, was compared with the classic method. The comparison
   involved artificially anthrax-contaminated soil samples (500 spores/7.5
   grams soil) and naturally contaminated soil samples collected in
   Bangladesh during a field investigation.
   Results: The results indicated that, in contrast to the classic method,
   the GABRI method was able to detect B. anthracis in all contaminated
   samples. The GABRI method produces a more sensitive measure of anthrax
   spore presence significantly different from the standard method. In
   particular, the latter is more sensitive to the presence of normal soil
   contaminants.
   Conclusion: The main feature of the GABRI method is its ability to
   strongly reduce the presence of the environmental contaminants, which
   being much more numerous than B. anthracis tend to inhibit their
   germination and growth making it extremely difficult to visualize any
   colonies. The reduction of the microbial environment also allows one to
   be able to culture and test a larger quantity of potentially
   contaminated soil and to isolate B. anthracis when the spores are
   present in very low concentrations in the soil.},

Abstract = {Swine influenza virus (SwIV) is considered a zoonosis and the fact that
   swine may act as an intermediate reservoir for avian influenza virus,
   potentially infectious for humans, highlights its relevance and the need
   to understand the interaction of different influenza viruses with the
   porcine immune system. Thus, in vitro porcine bone marrow-derived
   dendritic cell (poBMDCs) were infected with a circulating SwIV
   A/Swine/Spain/SF32071/2007(H3N2), 2009 human pandemic influenza virus
   A/Catalonia/63/2009(H1N1), low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV)
   A/Anas plathyrhynchos/Spain/1877/2009(aH7N2) or high pathogenic avian
   influenza virus (HPAIV) A/Chicken/Italy/5093/1999(aH7N1). Swine
   influenza virus H3N2 infection induced an increase of SLA-I and CD80/86
   at 16 and 24 h post infection (hpi), whereas the other viruses did not.
   All viruses induced gene expression of NF-kappa B, TGF-beta, IFN-beta
   and IL-10 at the mRNA level in swine poBMDCs to different extents and in
   a time-dependent manner. All viruses induced the secretion of IL-12
   mostly at 24 hpi whereas IL-18 was detected at all tested times. Only
   swH3N2 induced IFN-alpha in a time-dependent manner. Swine H3N2, aH7N2
   and aH7N1 induced secretion of TNF-alpha also in a time-dependent
   manner. Inhibition of NF-kappa B resulted in a decrease of IFN-alpha and
   IL-12 secretion by swH3N2-infected poBMDC at 24 hpi, suggesting a role
   of this transcription factor in the synthesis of these cytokines.
   Altogether, these data might help in understanding the relationship
   between influenza viruses and porcine dendritic cells in the innate
   immune response in swine controlled through soluble mediators and
   transcription factors. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {VETERINARY RESEARCH},

Abstract = {The endemic non-pathogenic Australian rabbit calicivirus RCV-A1 is known
   to provide some cross protection to lethal infection with the closely
   related Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV). Despite its obvious
   negative impacts on viral biocontrol of introduced European rabbits in
   Australia, little is known about the extent and mechanisms of this cross
   protection. In this study 46 rabbits from a colony naturally infected
   with RCV-A1 were exposed to RHDV. Survival rates and survival times did
   not correlate with titres of serum antibodies specific to RCV-A1 or
   cross reacting to RHDV, but were instead influenced by the time between
   infection with the two viruses, demonstrating for the first time that
   the cross protection to lethal RHDV infection is transient. These
   findings are an important step towards a better understanding of the
   complex interactions of co-occurring pathogenic and non-pathogenic
   lagoviruses.},

Title = {Risk factors for the persistence of bovine brucellosis in Sicily from

Abstract = {Bovine brucellosis is a worldwide zoonotic disease, responsible for
   economic and reproductive losses in farmed animals. Despite the
   application of control and eradication measures, after several years the
   brucellosis situation still remains problematic in Sicily, one of the
   regions with the highest prevalence of infection in Italy. The objective
   of this paper is to evaluate the possible risk factors influencing the
   presence of bovine brucellosis in Sicily. Data on existing cattle herds
   in Sicily and on their structure in 2008, 2009 and 2010 were extracted
   from the national database (NDb) of holdings and animals. Several
   possible brucellosis risk factors were considered, in particular
   herd-related factors and the performances of the control activities
   carried out by the veterinary services and recorded into national animal
   health information system (SANAN). Statistical analysis (chi(2) and
   Mann-Whitney tests) and spatial cluster analysis using a simple spatial
   Bernoulli model were performed. The multivariable logistic regression
   was also performed using SPSS for Windows. The spatial distribution of
   infected herds shows two main clusters of infection, in Messina and in
   Siracusa provinces. The results of the statistical analysis performed
   show that the infection is associated to the largest herds (P < 0.0001)
   and to beef and mixed herds (P < 0.0001). A significant association can
   be observed between the infected status in 2010 and presence of positive
   animals in 2008 or in 2009 (P < 0.0001).
   This article shows the importance of detailed and reliable
   epidemiological data through information systems, allowing a continuous
   monitoring of the health status of animal populations and also the
   evaluation and re-planning of veterinary activities. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {West Nile disease (WND) is one of the most widespread mosquito-borne
   infectious diseases in the World. In Morocco the first WND cases were
   reported in equines in 1996. After an apparent epidemiological silence,
   WND re-occurred in 2003 and in 2010, when the disease was reported in
   equines living in the central and north-western part of the country.
   Eco-climatic variables are known to influence the mosquito presence and
   abundance and, therefore, the probability of occurrence of
   mosquito-borne infections. The remote sensed values of Land Surface
   Temperature (LST), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and
   rainfall registered from 2001 to 2010 were evaluated for a possible
   association with the occurrence of WND cases in 2003 and in 2010. In the
   zones where WND cases occurred, NDVI values recorded in 2003 and 2010,
   from June to November, were significantly higher than those registered
   during the same months in the rest of the decade. Rainfall data showed
   higher peaks in 2003 and 2010, when the number of days with extreme
   rainfall was significantly higher during 1-2 months before the
   occurrence of WND cases. Temperature does not seem to play an important
   role in Moroccan epidemiological conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The development of early warning systems is fundamental for preventing
   the spread of infectious diseases. Data collection, however, is a costly
   activity and it is not possible to implement early warning systems
   everywhere and for all possible events. Hence, tools helping to improve
   the focus of surveillance efforts are of paramount importance. Risk
   assessment methods and other provisional modelling techniques may permit
   to estimate the probability of introduction and spread of infectious
   diseases in different geographical areas. Similarly, efficient
   information systems must be in place to assist the veterinary services
   in case of epidemic emergencies in order to support the prompt
   application of control measures for the containment of the infection and
   the reduction of the magnitude of negative consequences. This review
   describes two recent approaches to the estimation of the probability of
   introduction and spread of infectious diseases based on the use of risk
   maps/spatial modelling and Social Network Analysis (SNA) techniques. The
   review also describes a web application developed in Italy to help
   official veterinary services to trace animals in case of outbreaks of
   infectious diseases.},

Title = {New incursions of West Nile virus lineage 2 in Italy in 2013: the value

Abstract = {West Nile virus (WNV) is one of the most serious public health threats
   that Europe and the Mediterranean countries are currently facing. In
   Italy, WNV emerged in 1998 and has been circulating since 2008. To
   tackle its continuous incursions, Italian national and regional
   institutions set up a surveillance program, which includes the
   serological screening of sentinel horses, sentinel-chickens and backyard
   poultry flocks and the surveillance on all equine neurological cases,
   resident captured and wild dead birds, and vectors. This communication
   aims to assess the importance of the entomological surveillance program
   as an early warning system for WNV circulation. In the province of
   Modena, the circulation of WNV lineage 2 strains was first detected in
   pools of Culex pipiens on July the 3rd, 42 days prior to the onset of
   the first 2013 human WNV neuroinvasive case reported in the same
   province. Similarly in Veneto, WNV was first detected on July 3rd in a
   pool of Cx. pipiens collected in the province of Venezia. The first
   human neuroinvasive case in this region occurred in the Rovigo province
   on July the 24th, seven days after the detection of WNV lineage 2 in a
   mosquito pool collected in the same province. Up to the end of July
   2013, WNV circulation was further detected in several other pools of Cx.
   pipiens mosquitoes collected in Emilia-Romagna, Veneto and Lombardia.
   According to the NS3 partial sequence alignments including all recent
   European and Italian Lineage 2 strains, the new circulating WNV lineage
   2 strains share high nt homology with the Hungarian and with the
   previous lineage 2 strains isolated in Veneto and Sardegna in 2011 and
   2012. These data provide a clear and practical demonstration of the
   relevance of a reliable entomological surveillance program to early
   detect WNV in Italy.},

Abstract = {West Nile Virus lineage 1 (WNV lin1) emerged in North-Eastern Italy in
   2008 and, since then, it has been detected in animals, humans and
   mosquitoes. Three years later, in the same area, a lineage 2 (lin2)
   strain of WNV was found in birds and vectors. On August the 21st, during
   the 2012 WNV entomological surveillance plan, a WNV lin2 strain was
   detected by RT-PCR in a pool of Culex pipiens mosquitoes captured in
   Veneto region. According to the alignment of the partial sequences of
   the NS5 and NS3 genes, no differences between this Italian lineage 2
   strain and the Nea Santa-Greece-2010 WNV isolate (Gr-10) were observed.
   Similarly to the Gr-10 strain, the putative NS3 aminoacid sequences of
   the Italian strain showed proline in position 249 instead of histidine
   (H249P). Although proline in position 249 has been suggested to increase
   the virulence of WNV strains, neither human nor veterinary cases
   associated to this strain have been reported in the region. A prompt
   mosquito disinfestation was organized to avoid the spread of this
   potential threatening virus. The simultaneous circulation of both WNV
   lineage 1 and 2 confirms North-Eastern Italy as a high risk area for WNV
   emergence and highlights the need for a continuous surveillance.},

Abstract = {West Nile virus (WNV) was first isolated in Uganda. In Europe WNV was
   sporadically detected until 1996, since then the virus has been
   regularly isolated from birds and mosquitoes and caused several
   outbreaks in horses and humans. Phylogenetic analysis showed two main
   different WNV lineages. The lineage 1 is widespread and segregates into
   different subclades (1a-c). WNV-1a includes numerous strains from
   Africa, America, and Eurasia. The spatio-temporal history of WNV-1a in
   Europe was recently described, identifying two main routes of
   dispersion, one in Eastern and the second in Western Europe. The West
   Nile lineage 2 (WNV-2) is mainly present in sub-Saharan Africa but has
   been recently emerged in Eastern and Western European countries. In this
   study we reconstruct the phylogeny of WNV-2 on a spatio-temporal scale
   in order to estimate the time of origin and patterns of geographical
   dispersal of the different isolates, particularly in Europe.
   Phylogeography findings obtained from E and NS5 gene analyses suggest
   that there were at least two separate introductions of WNV-2 from the
   African continent dated back approximately to the year 1999 (Central
   Europe) and 2000 (Russia), respectively. The epidemiological
   implications and clinical consequences of lineage 1 and 2 cocirculation
   deserve further investigations. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Fox rabies re-emerged in north-eastern Italy at the end of 2008 and
   circulated until early 2011. As with previous rabies epidemics, the
   Italian cases were linked to the epidemiological situation in adjacent
   regions. To obtain a comprehensive picture of the dynamics of the recent
   Italian epidemic, we performed a detailed evolutionary analysis of RABVs
   circulating in north-eastern Italy. Sequences were obtained for the
   hyper-variable region of the nucleoprotein gene, the complete
   glycoprotein gene, and the intergenic region G-L from 113 selected fox
   rabies cases. We identified two viral genetic groups, here referred to
   as Italy-1 and Italy-2. Phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses
   revealed that both groups had been circulating in the Western Balkans
   and Slovenia in previous years and were only later introduced into Italy
   (into the Friuli Venezia Giulia region-FVG), occupying different areas
   of the Italian territories. Notably, viruses belonging to the Italy-1
   group remained confined to the region of introduction and their spread
   was minimised by the implementation of oral fox vaccination campaigns.
   In contrast, Italy-2 viruses spread westward over a territory of 100 km
   from their first identification in FVG, likely crossing the northern
   territories where surveillance was inadequate. A genetic sub-group
   (Italy-2A), characterised by a unique amino acid mutation (D106A) in the
   N gene, was also observed to occupy a distinct geographic cluster. This
   molecular epidemiological analysis of the 2008-2011 fox rabies epidemic
   will contribute to future control programmes both at national and
   regional levels. In particular, our findings highlight the weaknesses of
   the national surveillance strategy in the period preceding rabies
   re-emergence, and of control plans implemented immediately after rabies
   notification, and underline the need of a coordinated approach at the
   regional level for both the surveillance and control of wildlife rabies.

Abstract = {This study investigated classical scrapie susceptibility in four native
   Italian sheep breeds (Lamon, Brogna, Alpagota, Foza) through PrP
   genotyping. The investigation revealed that the majority of animals
   overall showed moderate to high susceptibility to classical scrapie. The
   Lamon and Brogna breeds exhibited the highest frequency of the highly
   susceptible VRQ allele (38.1\% and 19.3\%, respectively), while the
   Alpagota and Foza had a high frequency of the ARQ allele (85\% and 64\%,
   respectively), also considered to confer susceptibility. The Foza breed
   showed a significantly high frequency (P < 0.01) of the rare ARK allele
   (9.7\%); a similar frequency has never been described before in the
   literature. This study stresses the importance of genotyping native
   sheep breeds both to better organize conservation schemes and to assess
   the risk of contracting classical scrapie. Additionally, the
   investigated native breeds revealed some characteristics that could be
   interesting for research purposes. These sheep could in fact be used to
   investigate the susceptibility of the ARK allele to classical scrapie,
   but also to determine whether its relatively high frequency is
   indicative that the origin of the Foza breed differs from the other
   Venetian sheep breeds. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The in vitro activity of enrofloxacin against 73 Mycoplasma synoviae
   field strains isolated in Israel and Europe was determined by broth
   microdilution. Decreased susceptibility to enrofloxacin was identified
   in 59\% of strains, with the MICs ranging from 1 to >16 mu g/ml. The
   estimated MIC50 and MIC90 values for enrofloxacin were 2 and 8 mu g/ml,
   respectively. Moreover, this study showed that 92\% of recent Israeli
   field isolates (2009 to 2011) of M. synoviae have MICs of >= 2 mu g/ml
   to enrofloxacin. Comparison of the quinolone resistance-determining
   regions (QRDRs) in M. synoviae isolates revealed a clear correlation
   between the presence of one of the amino acid substitutions Asp79-Asn,
   Thr80-Ala/Ile, Ser81-Pro, and Asp84-Asn/Tyr/His of the ParC QRDR and
   decreased susceptibility to enrofloxacin (MIC, >= 1 mu g/ml). Amino acid
   substitutions at positions GyrA 87, GyrB 401/402, and ParE 420/454 were
   also identified, but there was no clear-cut correlation with
   susceptibility to enrofloxacin. Comparison of vlhA molecular profiles
   revealed the presence of 9 different genotypes in the Israeli M.
   synoviae field isolates and 10 genotypes in the European isolates; only
   one vlhA genotype (type 4) was identified in both cohorts. Based on
   results of vlhA molecular typing, several mechanisms for emergence and
   dissemination of Israeli enrofloxacin-resistant M. synoviae isolates are
   suggested.},

Abstract = {Following the first report of Schmallenberg virus (SBV) in the brain of
   a dystocic goat foetus in 2012 in Northern Italy, immediate response
   actions were adopted to avoid the virus circulation. The brain tested
   positive by 2 different one-step real-time RT-PCR protocols; these
   results were also confirmed by partial sequencing of the viral genome.
   At that time this was the first detection of the new Orthobunyavirus
   genus within the Bunyaviridae family in Italy. An epidemiological
   investigation in the involved farm was carried out in collaboration with
   the CESME - National Reference Centre for the study and verification of
   Foreign Animal Diseases (Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale
   dell'Abruzzo e del Molise `G. Caporale', Italy). Epidemiological
   information on the flock was provided and analysed, whole blood and
   serum samples were also collected from all animals in the farm for both
   virological and serological investigations. All blood samples tested
   negative for SBV, whereas serological positive results were obtained by
   virus-neutralization (VN). Epidemiological investigations indicated the
   possible virus circulation in the area. The subsequent surveillance
   actions were mainly based on the standardization and re-enforcement of
   passive surveillance protocols, a risk-based serological surveillance
   programme through VN and an entomological surveillance programme in the
   involved geographical areas were also put in place. Eventually SBV local
   circulation was confirmed by real time RT-PCR in 6 Culicoides pools,
   collected between September and November 2011 in 3 farms in the
   surroundings of the area of SBV outbreak.},

Abstract = {The Angiopoietin/Tie system is a key regulator of vascular remodeling,
   maturation, angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. In humans there are
   three angiopoietins: Angiopoietin-1 (Angl), Angiopoietin-2 (Ang2), and
   Angiopoietin-4 (Ang4). Angl and Ang2 are the best characterized
   angiopoietins. The `` angiopoietin receptor system consists of two type
   I tyrosine kinase receptors (Tie1 and Tie2). Tie2 binds all known
   angiopoietins. We sought to characterize Angl, Ang2, Tiel and T1e2
   expression and functions in human basophils and mast cells. Basophils,
   LAD-2 cells and Human Lung Mast Cells (HLMCs) constitutively express
   Angl and Ang2 mRNA. Intracellular staining for Angl and Ang2 was
   stronger in basophils than in mast cells. Immunoelectron microscopy
   demonstrated Angl in cytoplasmic vesicles of basophils. The protein
   kinase C activators phorbol diester (PMA) and bryostatin 1 (Bryol)
   stimulated basophils to rapidly release a large amount of Angl.
   PMA-induced Angl release was inhibited by brefeldin A. Tiel and Tie2
   mRNAs were expressed in basophils, LAD-2 and HLMCs. Basophils, LAD-2 and
   HLMCs expressed Tiel on the cell surface. HLMCs and LAD-2 expressed Tie2
   on the cell surface, whereas basophils did not. Angl, but not Ang2,
   induced migration of mast cells through the engagement of Tie2. Neither
   Angl nor Ang2 induced basophil chemotaxis. We have identified a novel
   mechanism of cross-talk between human basophils and mast cells mediated
   by the Angl/Tie2 system that might be relevant in the orchestration of
   inflammatory and neoplastic angiogenesis.},

Abstract = {Twelve National Reference Laboratories (NRLs) for rabies have undertaken
   a comparative assay to assess the comparison of fluorescent antibody
   test (FAT) results using five coded commercial anti-rabies conjugates
   (Biorad, Bioveta, Fujirebio, Millipore, and SIFIN conjugates).
   Homogenized positive brain tissues infected with various lyssavirus
   species as well as negative samples were analyzed blindly using a
   standardized FAT procedure. Conjugates B, C, D, and E were found to be
   significantly more effective than conjugate A for GS7 (French RABV)
   diluted samples (1/8 and 1/100) while the frequency of concordant
   results of conjugates C and D differ significantly from conjugates A, B
   and E for CVS 27. For detection of EBLV-1 strains, conjugates C and D
   also presented a significantly lower frequency of discordant results
   compared to conjugates A, B and E. Conjugates B, C and D were found to
   be significantly more effective than conjugates E and A for EBLV-2 and
   ABLV samples. In view of these results, conjugates C and D set
   themselves apart from the others and appeared as the most effective of
   this 5-panel conjugates. This study clearly demonstrates that the
   variability of conjugates used by National Reference Laboratories can
   potentially lead to discordant results and influence assay sensitivity.
   In case of false negative results this could have a dramatic impact if
   the animal under investigation is responsible for human exposure. To
   avoid such situations, confirmatory tests should be implemented. Crown

Abstract = {This report describes the clinicopathological features of a case of
   diffuse scaling dermatitis that occurred in a 16-week-old female athymic
   nude (CrTac:NCr-Foxn1(nu) ) mouse. Gross presentation was suggestive of
   Corynebacterium bovis infection (scaly skin disease). However, C. bovis
   was not isolated from the skin of the affected animal or from the skin
   of unaffected CrTac:NCr-Foxn1(nu) mice housed in the same cage or room.
   Staphylococcus xylosus was instead isolated in high numbers from the
   skin lesion, whereas only a few colonies were recovered from the skin of
   unaffected mice. Microscopically, the affected skin was characterized by
   chronic hyperplastic and hyperkeratotic dermatitis with focal
   ulcerations, extensive serocellular crusts, and intralesional clusters
   of Gram-positive coccoid bacteria. Although gross presentation of the
   reported case was suggestive of C. bovis infection, epidemiological,
   histopathological, and bacteriological findings definitively ruled out
   an outbreak of scaly skin disease. A diagnostic hypothesis of
   hyperplastic and hyperkeratotic dermatitis associated with opportunistic
   S. xylosus infection was formulated based on increased bacterial burden
   and presence of intralesional Gram-positive coccoid bacteria.},

Abstract = {Arsenic toxicity to humans critically depends on the chemical form of
   the arsenic. The Expert Committee of the Food and Agriculture
   Organization and the World Health Organization defined a tolerable
   intake only for inorganic arsenic, although the toxicity of some
   organoarsenic compounds is known. Arsenobetaine (AsB), arsenocholine
   (AsC), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), and monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) are
   abundant in shellfish. We present a fast and reliable method for
   identification of the type of organic arsenic in mussels by using liquid
   chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass
   spectrometry on triple quadrupole with parallel determination of total
   arsenic by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The method was validated
   by evaluating mean recoveries, repeatability, specificity, limits of
   quantification, and limits of detection that produced satisfactory
   results. The method was used to carry out the first survey of the
   concentrations of AsB, AsC, MMA, and DMA in seafood from southern Italy.
   Total As concentrations ranged from 1.38 to 12.79 mg/kg. AsB and DMA
   were detected in all samples (AsB: 0.72 to 10.36 mg/kg; DMA: 0.28 to
   1.08 mg/kg), and concentrations of AsC and MMA ranged from 0.20 to 1.53
   mg/kg. This method allowed us to rapidly and inexpensively identify
   arsenic types in fishery products and would be suitable for routine
   detection of organoarsenic compounds in molluscs.},

Abstract = {Caprine herpesvirus 1 (CpHV1) is a member of ruminant alphaherpesviruses
   antigenically related to the prototype bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV1).
   Although cross reactivity between the two viruses involves many
   structural glycoproteins, the use of two competitive BoHV1 ELISAs
   detecting anti gB and gE antibodies has been proposed for CpHV1
   infection, resulting mainly in a gB+/gE- reactivity and leading to
   suppose that CpHV1 gE may represent an useful target for the development
   of specific diagnostic test. Since CpHV1 gE gene has been only partially
   characterized so far, in this study the genome fragment of the short
   unique unit (Us) encompassing gI and gE gene was amplified and
   sequenced. Gene fragments encoding the ectodomain of both glycoproteins
   were subcloned into pSECTag2/Hygro and expressed in HEK293T cells as
   secreted form in serum free medium. Due to the lack of specific
   monoclonal antibodies (Mabs), the same recombinant glycoproteins were
   obtained from BoHV1 and used as positive control with a panel of
   specific gE and gI Mabs as well as in some ELISA assays. Results clearly
   indicate that the ectodomain of CpHV1 gE, immobilized on solid face in
   an indirect ELISA format, represents a sensitive and specific marker of
   infection, when compared with neutralization test, with absence of very
   low degree of cross-reactivity with BoHV1 gE counterpart, while the use
   of CpHV1 gI-ELISA or a combination of gE/gI complex did not
   significantly improve the sensitivity of the assay. In addition, in the
   rare event in which cross species barrier occurs for both viruses from
   their natural host to other species, the use of both BoHV1 and CpHV1 gE
   in a comparative assay may be proposed. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

   inflammation are associated with the accumulation of the misfolded
   isoform (PrPsc) of the cellular prion protein (PrPc). Therefore we
   tested the hypothesis that augmenting a natural anti-inflammatory
   pathway mediated by epoxygenated fatty acids (EpFAs) will delay
   lethality. EpFAs are highly potent but enzymatically labile molecules
   produced by the actions of a number of cytochrome P450 enzymes.
   Stabilization of these bioactive lipids by inhibiting their degradation
   mediated by the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) results in potent
   anti-inflammatory effects in multiple disease models.
   Main methods: Mice were infected with the mouse-adapted RML strain of
   scrapie by intracerebral or intraperitoneal routes. Animals received the
   sEH inhibitor, by oral route, administrated in drinking water or vehicle
   (PEG400). Infected mice were euthanized at a standard clinical end
   point. Histopathological, immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses
   of brain tissue confirmed the presence of pathology related to prion
   infection.
   Key findings: Oral administration of the sEHI did not affect the very
   short survival time of the intracerebral prion infection group. However,
   mice infected by intraperitoneal route and treated with t-AUCB survived
   significantly longer than the control group mice (p < 0.001).
   Significance: These findings support the idea that inhibition of sEH or
   augmentation of the natural EpFA signaling in the brain offers a
   potential and different route to understand prion diseases and may
   become a therapeutic strategy for diseases involving neuroinflammation.

Title = {Seroepidemiological study of ovine toxoplasmosis in East and West Shewa
   Zones of Oromia Regional State, Central Ethiopia},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Background: Toxoplasmosis is a globally distributed zoonosis.
   Consumption of raw or undercooked meat, which is among the main risk
   factors for acquiring human infection, is a popular tradition in
   Ethiopia. However, studies on toxoplasmosis in food animals used for
   human consumption in Ethiopia are very scarce. Thus, the objectives of
   the present study were to estimate the seroprevalence and the risk
   factors of T. gondii infection in sheep in Ambo, Ada'a-Liben and Fentale
   districts of Central Ethiopia. Sera from 1130 sheep were analyzed for
   Toxoplasma gondii specific IgG antibodies using an indirect enzyme
   linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with the P30 antigen. A questionnaire
   was administered to assess potential risk factors for T. gondii
   seropositivity. Association of seroprevalence with potential risk
   factors related to altitude, host and farm characteristics were analyzed
   by univariable and multivariable logistic regression.
   Results: Overall flock and animal level seroprevalences were 70.48\%
   (160/227; 95\% CI: 64.51, 76.46) and 31.59\% (357/1130; 95\% CI: 28.88,
   34.31), respectively. The multivariable logistic regression model
   indicated that the probability of acquiring T. gondii was higher in
   sheep from highland (2300 - 3200 meters above sea level) {[}Odds ratio
   (OR) = 4.11, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 2.65, 6.36; P < 0.001] and
   midland (OR = 4.54, 95\% CI: 2.76, 7.49; P < 0.001) than from lowland (<
   1500 meters above sea level), in females than in males (OR = 1.60, 95\%
   CI: 1.04, 2.43, P = 0.033), in adult than in young animals (OR = 2.93,
   95\% CI: 1.97, 4.35, P < 0.001), in small than in large flocks (OR =
   3.34, 95\% CI: 1.26, 8.86, P = 0.016), and in sheep that were given tap
   water (OR = 4.07, 95\% CI: 1.07, 15.42, P = 0.039) and river water (OR =
   4.18, 95\% CI: 1.54, 11.35, P = 0.005) than in those that drunk water
   from mixed sources (i.e., river, well, lake and pond).
   Conclusions: The high flock and animal level seroprevalence of
   toxoplasmosis in sheep is a good marker of the potential risk for human
   infections. Altitude, sex, age, flock size and source of water were
   identified as important risk factors to acquire the infection. Public
   education and awareness training are imperative in order to alleviate
   the danger posed to consumers. Further detailed studies to assess the
   impact of infections are warranted.},

Abstract = {Meat contamination by Salmonella spp. is emerging as a major cause of
   human enteric infections in industrialized countries. The attempts to
   reduce human cases of salmonellosis encompass pre- and post-harvest
   interventions. In this context, vaccination of pigs may represent an
   effective instrument in eliminating/reducing Salmonella burden through
   the food chain. We have previously demonstrated that Salmonella
   Typhimurium lacking the ZnuABC transporter (S. Typhimurium Delta znuABC)
   is a promising candidate live vaccine in different mouse models of
   Salmonella Typhimurium infection. In this study, we confirmed in pigs
   the attenuation of S. Typhimurium Delta znuABC. Moreover, we evaluated
   the safety and immunogenicity of S. Typhimurium Delta znuABC
   administered to pigs by the oral route. We monitored clinical conditions
   of animals and we conducted a microbiological culture and a
   quantification of the humoral and cellular immune response,
   respectively, on fecal and blood samples of pigs. After vaccination with
   attenuated S. Typhimurium Delta znuABC, pigs showed a modest degree of
   hyperthermia. In addition, fecal shedding of S. Typhimurium Delta znuABC
   could not be detected 28 days after the inoculum. Furthermore,
   vaccination with S. Typhimurium Delta znuABC elicited a distinct
   production of anti-Salmonella antibodies and IFN-gamma. Taken together,
   these results suggest that S. Typhimurium Delta znuABC is attenuated and
   immunogenic in pigs. Although the vaccine dosages do not guarantee
   complete safety there is ample margin to set up better conditions of
   use, suggesting that S. Typhimurium Delta znuABC could be a promising
   attenuated strain to be used as live mucosal vaccine for oral delivery.

Abstract = {Prednisolone is a steroid belonging to the corticosteroid group. The
   results obtained in the application of the 2008 and 2009 Italian Residue
   Control Plans show the frequent detection of prednisolone traces in
   cow's urine. Since most of the positive samples were detected at the
   slaughterhouse, the researchers hypothesised that, together with an
   increase of cortisol concentration, traces of prednisolone could be
   produced endogenously during stressful situations due to transport and
   handling before slaughter. In the present trial, 52 lactating cows
   housed in seven different farms in Lombardy, Italy, were studied. Urine
   samples were collected at the farm (after urethral catheterisation) and
   immediately after slaughter (from urinary bladder) together with 40
   adrenal gland samples belonging to the same animals. All the samples
   were analysed for the determination of prednisolone and cortisol by
   LC/MSn. The results demonstrated that prednisolone can be endogenously
   produced in dairy cows and, furthermore, its endogenous presence in
   bovine urine seems to be strongly related to a state of stress in the
   animals (at the farm and at the slaughterhouse). The data from adrenal
   glands do not, however, clarify if the endogenous production occurs,
   partially or totally, in this organ.},

Abstract = {In this study, we characterised the Salmonella Typhimurium strains
   responsible for four outbreaks which occurred in distinct rabbit farms
   (Southern Italy) from 1999 to 2003. Strains were typed by Pulsed Field
   Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) and the genetic basis of antimicrobial
   resistance was established. A major group of clonally related isolates,
   pulsotype STYMXB.0061, accounted for three of the salmonellosis foci.
   Strains were resistant to streptomycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline,
   ampicillin and sulphonamides encoded respectively by the aadA2, floR,
   tetG, bla(PSE-1), sul1 gene cluster harboured by a Salmonella Genomic
   Island I. The clonally related group of isolates included strains phage
   type DT104, DT12 or undefined type (NT). The fourth salmonellosis focus
   was caused by a strain pulsotype STYMXB.0147, resistant to sulphonamides
   (encoded by sul2) and phage type U302. Results provided first molecular
   characterisation of S. Typhimurium strains isolated from rabbit farms in
   Italy and highlighted the presence of the pulsotype STYMXB.0061 even
   before its wide detection among human clinical isolates collected in
   Italy in the mid 2000s from clinical cases. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

   nucleotide polymorphism is associated with intermediate levels of tumor
   necrosis factor alpha, gamma interferon, and nitric oxide synthase
   (NOS). Accordingly, deficiency as well as overexpression of

Title = {Preliminary results of the first regional project for the prevention of

Abstract = {Scrapie is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy of sheep and goats,
   caused by an accumulation of an abnormal form of a host membrane
   glycoprotein (prion protein or PrP) in the central nervous system. The
   disease is widely distributed in Europe and has been a notifiable
   disease within the European Union (EU) since 1991. Polymorphisms of the
   sheep PrP gene are associated with susceptibility to scrapie. The EU
   decided to use genetics as a control tool for scrapie, because genetic
   selection for resistance has been deployed successfully in some
   countries. Accordingly, it is very important to know the allelic
   frequency of the resistant genotype, especially for national and local
   sheep breeds. The aim of the present work is to describe the objectives
   and the preliminary results obtained by a local project in the Umbrian
   Region in order to further the knowledge of the frequency of the
   polymorphisms in the local sheep breeds, to make the breeders more aware
   of the disease and to improve the genetic selection strategies in the
   flocks, especially on the female lineage. Six-hundred and forty female
   sheep, belonging to different breeds (Sardinian, Comisana, Appenninica,
   Bergamasca, Suffolk, Sopravissana, Fabrianese) were genotyped and their
   allelic frequencies may be used to create a genetic selection nucleus.
   Every breed showed a different polymorphism frequency, and this is
   important for the future selection programmes because they should be
   adopted considering the characteristics of each breed, like the total
   number of the population, to avoid production damage or a possible
   extinction risk.
   Moreover, the purchase of resistant ram was promoted and a popular
   brochure for breeders was created.
   These results represent the initial nucleus for the future genetic
   selection of resistant genotypes, especially for local breeds, which
   could be penalized by a wider approach. The extension of this project to
   other flocks is recommended to improve the selection strategy.},

Abstract = {Hobi-like pestivirus, a new tentative species within genus Pestivirus,

   to respiratory distress and reproductive failures in cattle. In the
   present study, the cross-antibody response between bovine viral
   diarrhoea virus 1 (BVDV-1) and the emerging pestivirus was evaluated in
   the sheep model. Ten sheep were immunised against BVDV-1 or Hobi-like
   pestivirus using inactivated preparations and the induced antibody
   responses were evaluated against the homologous and heterologous
   viruses. The results showed that heterologous antibody titres were
   significantly lower than the homologous ones, thus suggesting the need
   to develop specific vaccines against the emerging pestiviral species.

Abstract = {An epidemiological survey for canine parvovirus (CPV) was conducted by
   collecting 615 faecal samples from dogs with diarrhoea in different
   European countries. Molecular methods showed that CPV-2a was predominant
   in most countries, followed by CPV-2c and CPV-2b, whereas 30 strains
   were not characterised. By sequence analysis of the full-length VP2
   gene, 20 of these viruses were characterised as CPV-2c mutants having
   the synonymous mutation A4061G in the probe-binding region that
   prevented correct strain characterisation. A real-time polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) assay using a minor groove binder probe was able to
   recognise both mutant and classical CPV-2c strains. These results
   indicate that the emergence of CPVs with mutations affecting the
   oligonucleotide-binding region needs a continuous update of molecular
   diagnostic tools in order to detect efficiently those emerging strains.

Abstract = {Major discrepancies are observed between experimental trials of
   PRRS-virus (PRRSV) infection in isolation facilities and observations
   made in the field on farm. Owing to the above, a cohort study was
   carried out in a farrow-to-finish, PRRSV-infected pig farm to
   characterize the time-course of the virus-specific immune response in
   two groups of replacement gilts. Despite the occurrence of three and two
   distinct waves of infection in groups 1 and 2, respectively, the large
   majority of animals showed little if any PRRSV-specific response in an
   interferon-gamma release assay on whole blood, whereas non-specific
   responses were consistently observed. To rule out any possible bias of
   our test procedure, this was used along with an ELISPOT assay for
   interferon-gamma-secreting cells with the same reagents on a group of
   PRRS-virus infected pigs in isolation facilities. A very good agreement
   was shown between the two sets of results. Also, as opposed to the PRRS
   model, plenty of Pseudorabies virus-vaccinated pigs under field
   conditions scored positive in another experiment in the interferon-gamma
   release assay, ad hoc modified for the Pseudorabies virus. Our results
   indicate that under field conditions poor or no development rather than
   delayed development of the PRRS virus-specific interferon-gamma response
   could be the rule for a long time in non-adult pigs after PRRS virus
   infection. Housing and hygiene conditions, as well as heavy exposure to
   environmental microbial payloads in intensive pig farms could adversely
   affect the host's immune response to PRRS virus and partly account for
   the discrepancies between experimental and field studies. (C) 2012

   Recoveries were in the range of 73-98\% (liver), 82-93\% (muscle),
   77-84\% (milk), and 93-110\% (feed). In all matrices the coefficients of
   variation for repeatability and intra-laboratory reproducibility were
   satisfactory. For emamectin in liver the worst method performance was
   observed. As this multi-analyte method fully met the required criteria
   and applicability both to food and feed, it has been successfully

Abstract = {Ovine hopesvirus 2 (OvHV-2) causes sheep-associated malignant catarrhal
   fever (SA-MCF), and is responsible for economic losses in cattle and
   other susceptible species around the world. A survey of 154 serum
   samples from 14 flocks in 3 Japanese prefectures (Hokkaido, Aomori and
   Iwate) was undertaken between 2007 and 2008 to test for antibodies to
   OvHV-2. OvHV-2 was present in 56 sheep and 2 goats, with 37.66\% of
   samples having a positive reaction using a serum neutralization test.
   The immune reaction reported in goats could result from Caprine
   herpesvirus-2. These results indicate that sheep are reservoirs for
   OvHV-2 in the field in Japan, and they might transmit the virus to
   susceptible cattle and wild fauna.},

Abstract = {The use of thyreostats as veterinary drugs is banned in the European
   Union since 1981 because of their carcinogenic and teratogenic
   properties. Controlling their illegal use in breeding animals is quite
   difficult because of their low molecular weight, high polarity and the
   presence of tautomeric forms. To harmonise the performance of analytical
   methods, the recommended concentration for thyreostats such as
   thiouracil, methylthiouracil, propylthiouracil and tapazole established
   by the Community Reference Laboratory in 2007 is 10ngg(-1). The majority
   of the currently available analytical methods require a time-consuming
   derivatisation step and/or an SPE clean-up step. In this study, a rapid
   confirmatory method for the determination of six thyreostatic drugs -
   thiouracil, methylthiouracil, propylthiouracil, phenylthiouracil,
   tapazole and 2-mercaptobenzoimidazole - in thyroid and muscle at
   recommended concentration is presented. Quick sample extraction has been
   achieved by QuEChERS with ethyl acetate without further clean-up or
   derivatisation steps. Analysis has been carried out by using
   UPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Performance characteristics of the method have been
   determined in agreement with Commission Decision 2002/657/EC
   requirements for confirmatory methods and calculated decision limits
   (CC) are below the recommended concentration (10ngg(-1)).},

Abstract = {Prednisolone is a synthetic corticosteroid acting on both hydrosaline
   balance and metabolism that is liable to fraudulent administration to
   meat-producing animals for growth-promoting purposes. Its use outside
   strict therapeutic control and prescription is banned by the European
   legislation, but official controls are hampered by its negligible direct
   excretion into the urinary matrix. Recent studies reported on a
   potential endogenous origin of prednisolone in animals subjected to
   stressful conditions, accounting for its occasional detection in control
   urines. The objective of the present study was the identification and
   quantification of prednisolone urinary metabolites to be used as illicit
   treatment biomarkers in place of the parent drug. An LC-MS/MS screening
   was conducted on urine samples collected from a bullock intramuscularly
   administered with prednisolone acetate by using a therapeutic protocol
   (2x0.52mgkg(-1) at 48-hour interval). Four prednisolone metabolites were
   identified: 20-dihydroprednisolone, 20-dihydroprednisolone,
   6-hydroxyprednisolone and 20-dihydroprednisone; the first was detected
   at relatively high concentrations. An existing quantitative LC-MS/MS
   method was expanded and revalidated to include these metabolites. The
   new analytical method proved sensitive (LODs: 0.35-0.42ngmL(-1)) and
   specific and was applied to urine samples collected from eight beef
   cattle subjected to low-dosage oral administration of prednisolone
   acetate for a 35-day period, as in standard growth-promoting treatments.
   20-Dihydroprednisolone was detected in all urine samples collected
   during the treatment, at relatively high concentration (1.2-27ngmL(-1)),
   whereas the prednisolone concentration was virtually negligible
   (<0.7ngmL(-1)). 20-Dihydroprednisolone was no longer present in almost
   all samples collected 6 days after the end of the treatment, but trace
   amounts of this metabolite were found in two urine samples from control
   animals. 20-Dihydroprednisolone is proposed as an effective biomarker to
   test illegal growth-promoting treatments with prednisolone in meat
   cattle, alternatively to the parent drug.},

Abstract = {In many parts of the world, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are
   the predominant cause of intramammary infections (IMI) in dairy cows and
   in water buffaloes, as well. A longitudinal field study was carried out
   on one well-managed dairy water buffalo herd to determine the prevalence
   and distribution of CNS and a recently described CNS-species,
   Staphylococcus rostri, in milk samples to explore its relevance for
   buffaloes' udder health throughout lactation, and to gain insight into
   the susceptibility of the latter species toward commonly used
   antimicrobials. Twice weekly quarter milk samples from a cohort of 11
   lactating water buffaloes were collected over an 8-mo period. The CNS (n
   = 109; 76.2\% of all culture-positive samples) were the predominant
   pathogens causing IMI, followed by Corynebacterium bovis (n = 11; 7.6\%)
   and Streptococcus spp. (n = 9; 6.2\%) other than Stretococcus uberis (n
   = 2; 1.4\%). Thirty-seven hemolytic staphylococci suspected to be
   Staphylococcus aureus were further differentiated using transfer
   DNA-intergenic spacer-PCR and rpoB-gene sequencing because they were
   coagulase-negative. Thirty-three of those isolates were identified as
   Staph. rostri, whereas 2 others were identified as Staphylococcus
   epidermidis. None of the Staph. rostri isolates displayed resistance to
   the antimicrobial agents tested. Mean quarter milk somatic cell count
   (qSCC) of all samples collected throughout lactation was 20,970
   cells/mL. The qSCC at sampling of quarters infected with Staph. rostri
   (34,466 cells/mL) and CNS other than Staph. rostri (34,813 cells/mL)
   were significantly higher than the qSCC of noninfected quarters (20,287
   cells/mL), yet not significantly different from each other. These
   findings provide novel insight into the prevalence and distribution,
   antimicrobial susceptibility, and relevance of Staph. rostri compared
   with other CNS species causing IMI in water buffaloes. Further studies
   are needed to pinpoint the relevance, niches, and transmission routes of
   Staph. rostri, as well as other CNS in water buffaloes.},

Abstract = {Following a report submitted by a beekeeper to Istituto Zooprofilattico
   Sperimentale delle Venezie, in Padua province (Borgoricco, Veneto, NE
   Italy), the authors discovered in April 2011 several specimens of the
   dusky sap beetle Carpophilus lugubris Murray 1864 (Coleoptera,
   Nitidulidae) on the bottom board of some beehives. At a later time (May
   2012), an isolated specimen was also collected within a Natural Reserve
   in Belluno province (Feltre, Veneto, NE Italy). These specimens
   represent the first known records of this species in Italy or Europe as
   a whole. This is also the first record of the species associated with
   beehives. This discovery led us to review the available bionomical and
   faunistic data for this widespread Nearctic and Neotropical species. C.
   lugubris is a recognized pest of corn, therefore is very important
   monitoring its possible dispersal into cornfields, beehives, and other
   agricultural regions of NE Italy and southern Europe over the next few
   years.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study is to better understand MRSA environmental
   contamination in pig holdings in relation, to the productive phase and
   the application of environmental cleaning and disinfection practices
   (C\&D). This study was carried out on six herds. Dust samples from
   farrowing crates, weaning boxes, growing and finishing pens were
   collected from each herd environment prior to and after C\&D and
   cultured for MRSA. Ten samples were collected at the end of each
   productive phase with the animals present and 10 additional samples were
   collected after C\&D, prior to introduction of a new stock. The
   proportion of positive samples prior to C\&D was lower in fattening than
   in other phases. The proportion of positive samples prior to and after
   C\&D was 121/240 (50\%) and 46/240 (19\%) respectively. In the mixed
   effects logistic regression analysis it was shown not only that both
   productive phase and C\&D were associated with the probability of having
   a positive sample but also that the C\&D effect was different in the
   different productive phases. In particular the effect of C\&D was
   stronger in farrowing crates than in the other productive phases. The
   results of this study show that, although current practices of cleaning
   and disinfection reduce MRSA environmental contamination, they are
   likely to be inadequate to the elimination of the microorganism.
   However, a strict application of hygienic protocols can lead to a marked
   reduction of MRSA environmental contamination. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Hemocytes are a critical component of the mussel defense system and the
   present study aims at investigating their spreading and oxidative
   properties during phagocytosis under in vivo experimental stress
   conditions. The spreading ability was measured by an automated cell
   analyzer on the basis of the circularity, a parameter corresponding to
   the hemocyte roundness. The oxidative activity was investigated by
   micromethod assay, measuring the respiratory burst as expression of the
   fluorescence generated by the oxidation of specific probe. Following the
   application of high temperature and exposure to air, there was evidence
   of negative modulation of spreading and oxidative response, as revealed
   by a cell roundness increase and fluorescence generation decrease.
   Therefore, the fall of respiratory burst appeared as matched with the
   inhibition of hemocyte morphological activation, suggesting a potential
   depression of the phagocytosis process and confirming the application of
   the circularity parameter as potential stress marker, both in
   experimental and field studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Use of eprinomectin and pyrantel pamoate in donkey: evaluation of
   anthelmintic efficacy},
Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {19},

Abstract = {Introduction - The popular belief that the donkey is the unlucky cousin
   of the horse leads to transfer all the experiences matured in the horse
   medicine to the donkey. This lack of knowledges has certainly a negative
   effect in the sanitary management of this animal.
   Aim - This field study was aimed to evaluate the anthelmintic efficacy
   of two molecules, the pyrantel pamoate and the eprinomectin, in donkey.
   Additional goals of this study were to evaluate the effect of the
   treatment on the body condition score and to establish the average cost
   of the two different treatments.
   Material and Methods - Fifteen ``Ragusana{''} breed donkeys were used
   for the study. Animals included in the study were all females aged 3-8
   year-old and infested with intestinal strongyles. Donkeys were divided
   in three homogeneous groups (E, P, and C) composed by five subjects
   each. At day (D0), animals of groups E and P were treated with
   eprinomectin pour-on (1 ml/10 kg p. v. namely 500 mu g of
   eprinomectin/kg p.v.) and pyrantel pamoate (5 g/100 kg/p.v. P.O.)
   respectively. Animals of group C were left untreated and used as
   control.
   Results and discussion - All animals recruited were shedding strongyle
   eggs at D -5 and D0 (>= 500 e.p.g.). Additionally 3 Dictyocaulus
   arnfieldi positive subjects were present in each group. Treatments were
   well tolerated in both groups and no side effects were noted. A
   significant reduction of intestinal nematode egg shedding was found in
   both treated groups (P and E) on D7 and D14 post treatment. Both the
   drugs showed a good anthelmintic efficacy (> 90\%) expressed as values
   of fecal egg count reduction test (FECRT). The highest value (99.6\%)
   was recorded in Group E while in P group it was 93\%. Concerning the
   lung infestation by D. arnfieldi, after treatments both a reduction of
   infected animals and of the number of larvae shed in the faeces were
   observed. On D14, treated groups were negative at the Baermann
   technique, however, in the faecal controls on D21, D28 and D35, only
   donkeys in Group E were still negative. Eggs reapparition time (ERT)
   showed different patterns for the two treated groups. In Group P,
   strongyle eggs reappeared on D21, while in Group E strongyle eggs
   reappeared on D35 in only one donkey.
   Conclusion - Both the compounds tested in the study showed a good
   anthelmintic efficacy, but with different FECRT and ERT values.
   Regarding to the therapeutic time window, calculated in this study
   through the ERT, the eprinomectin clearly showed the longest activity.
   Finally, based on the cost of the commercial compounds used in the
   study, the cheapest treatment resulted that with the eprinomectin ((sci)
   2.13/100 kg), whereas the treatment with pyrantel was estimated in (sci)
   4.65/100 kg. In conclusion, based on the analysis of the FECRT value,
   the therapeutic time window, the market price and the board-spectrum of
   action, the eprinomectin pour-on could represent, in the case it will be
   registered for the use in donkey, an efficient drug for deworming
   program especially in those animals raised for milk production.},

Title = {PFGE and automated riboprinting methods for molecular characterization
   of Pseudomonas fluorescens isolates involved in the

Abstract = {Introduction - Since June 2010, an amazing high number of mozzarella
   cheese, produced in Italian and German plants, caused complaints in
   Italian consumers due to their unusual blue colour. The samples resulted
   positive for Pseudomonas fluorescens, psychrotrophic microorganisms,
   classified as ubiquitous in nature, isolated from soil, water, and
   vegetation. These species are particularly worrying for dairy industry
   as they could enter in processed dairy products through
   postpasteurization contamination in the milk processing plant; moreover
   the temperature of transport and distribution are considered permissive
   for the growth of these organisms.
   Aim - The aim of this study was the molecular characterization of P.
   fluorescens isolates with two different molecular techniques, in order
   to evaluate the genetic correlation between isolates and eventually the
   contamination source.
   Material and methods - 94 isolates of P. fluorescens, deriving from food
   microbiological laboratories of Italian network of Istituti
   Zooprofilattici Sperimentali, were collected between June 2010 and July
   2011. The two molecular techniques analyze different portion of DNA:
   PFGE restriction endonuclease digestion was conducted on the whole
   genome of isolates with a rare-cutting enzymes SpeI, whereas automated
   riboprinting was conducted with two enzymes, EcoRI and PvuII on locus
   coding for rRNA operons.
   Results and discussion - PFGE analysis gave 44 different pulsotypes,
   while riboprinting with EcoRI gave 6 different ribogroups; the second
   restriction, operated with PvuII, gave other 7 ribogroups. All the
   restriction profiles were analysed with BioNumerics software, resulting
   in three different phylogenetic trees. Applying appropriate criteria of
   analysis, it was possible to evidence two different cluster of isolates,
   one including Italian isolates and the other including German ones.
   Conclusions - Our results demonstrate that the ``blue-mozzarella{''}
   event was not correlated to an unusual spread of one P. fluorescens
   strain diffusion, underlining the high genetic variability of 94 P.
   fluorescens isolates, pointed out with both molecular methods.},

Abstract = {Norovirus (NoV) are increasingly important as etiological agents of
   gastrointestinal infections. Consumption of bivalve molluscs and
   ready-to-eat fishery products is one of the most common ways of
   acquiring NoV foodborne infections, and the rise of outbreaks of viral
   gastroenteritis represents an important health problem that is also
   responsible for economic losses. The aim of this work was to define the
   prevalence of NoV contamination in preserved fishery products and in
   shellfish commercialized in Italy, taking into account the results
   obtained during 9 years of survey (2003-2011) and paying special
   attention to the regions more involved in national production. A total
   of 4463 samples were examined (2310 mussels, 1517 clams, 510 oysters, 22
   other shellfish species, 104 preserved seafood products) and the average
   positivity rate for NoV presence was 4.1\% and ranged from 0.6\% in 2007
   to 9.8\% in 2003 and from 1.9\% in preserved seafood products to 4.7\%
   in mussels. Genetic characterization of circulating strains showed a
   prevalence of genogroup II genotypes, including GII.b and GII.e
   polymerase types and different GII.4 variants. This information could
   contribute to the optimization of risk-based sampling strategies for NoV
   contamination in seafood, taking into account variability in different
   species and from year to year.},

Abstract = {17 beta-Oestradiol is a steroid hormone banned as a growth promoter in
   food-producing animals all over Europe because of its carcinogenicity.
   Despite mandatory monitoring of illegal treatment all over Europe,
   official analytical methods in use test negative a few days after
   17-oestradiol administration, requiring new sensitive tools to ensure a
   high level of protection for consumers. The aim of this work was the
   evaluation of the accuracy of histopathology and immunohistochemistry
   for progesterone receptor (PR) as a screening method for the detection
   of low-dosage illegal treatments with 17 beta-oestradiol. Fresian male
   calves (153) were farmed under controlled conditions, and 89 of them
   were treated with 17 beta-oestradiol (5mg/animal once a week for 4
   weeks). After 15 days of suspension, all animals were slaughtered and
   sexual accessory glands (prostate and bulbo-urethral glands) were
   sampled for histological examination and immunohistochemical staining
   with anti-PR antibody (clone hPRa 2). Microscopically 86 out of 89
   bulbo-urethral glands showed mild to severe metaplasia, while mild
   metaplasia was observed only in 1 control. Eighteen out of 89 samples of
   prostate did not show metaplastic lesions. Immunopositivity for PR
   characterised all treated animals, while no signal was detected in
   controls. These findings show that metaplasia of the sexual accessory
   glands is a sensitive and specific parameter for illegal 17
   beta-oestradiol treatment in calves at the slaughterhouse, while the
   appliance of immunohistochemistry for PR can improve to 100\% the
   accuracy of this highly reliable histological approach.},

Title = {Evaluation of the DR-CALUX (R) bioassay as screening method for the
   detection of contamination by dioxins in milk in Piedmont},

Abstract = {Introduction - Dioxins are a family of organic micro-pollutants, highly
   toxic to man, able to persist long time in the environment, accumulate
   in the fat of humans and animals, and thus enter the food chain. The
   cell bioassay DR-CALUX (Dioxin Responsive Chemically Activated
   Luciferase Gene Expression), based on the mechanism of uptake of
   cellular receptor AhR for dioxins and dioxin-like compounds, is a method
   that has spread in recent years in many countries, as test of choice for
   screening of food, because of the relatively short run times and reduced
   costs compared to the confirmatory method, the high resolution gas
   chromatography and mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS).
   Aim - The purpose of this paper is to assess the applicability of the
   BDS-DR-CALUX (R) method as a screening tool for the monitoring of
   dioxins in milk produced in the Piedmont region, verifying the
   reliability compared to the data obtained through the official
   confirmatory method.
   Materials and method - Thirteen raw milk samples, previously examined by
   HRGC/HRMS, coming from a contaminated site near a steelworks in the area
   of Susa Valley, and 30 milk samples coming from the market distribution,
   were subjected to extraction of fats and subsequent purification into
   silica columns.
   For the dioxins determination, genetically modified hepatoma cells were
   cultured and incubated in 96 well plates and then left in contact for 24
   hours with the extracts of the samples. Luminescence was measured with a
   chemiluminometer, exploiting the interaction mechanism between
   luciferine and luciferase.
   Results and discussion - The results obtained showed good infraclass
   correlation between the traditional method and the BDS-DR-CALUX (R), in
   milk, a common food, especially in childhood nutrition, and used for
   further transformations. BDS -DR-CALUX (R) and chemical method can be
   considered as two valid systems to be used in series and are able to
   provide comparable results with regard to the relative quantification of
   dioxins: DR-CALUX gives a biological response of total mixture and allow
   to discriminate in advance through samples, which don't require an
   additional method of confirmation, and suspect samples, which will need
   to be confirmed by HRGC/HRMS, while HRGC/HRMS provides the concentration
   of specific chemical compounds in the mixture.
   Conclusions -BDS-DR-CALUX (R), therefore, is confirmed as a valid
   screening method for milk, quick, fast, relatively cheap and able to
   allow a much broad monitoring of any areas potentially at risk for the
   population. Therefore the method allows for environmental monitoring and
   epidemiology of a high number of samples and test the contamination
   levels of dioxin in the food chain.},

   human consumption. According to the Commission Decision 657/2002/CE, the
   detection capability, the precision, the selectivity-specificity, and
   applicability-ruggedness-stability were determined to validate the
   method. Moreover, trueness was verified. This procedure resulted in
   rapid execution, which allowed immediate and effective intervention by

Abstract = {Pb, Cd and Hg in muscles of flathead mullet (Mugil cephalus), collected
   from Bocca di Magra, La Spezia (Ligurian Sea, Mediterranean Sea, Italy),
   were determined using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry
   after microwave digestion for Pb and Cd and direct mercury analyser for
   Hg. Average Pb concentrations varied in the range 0.20-0.24mg/kg,
   whereas Cd and Hg levels were negligible. None of the tested 200 samples
   exceeded the European regulatory limits as set by EC 1881/2006 and
   420/2011. Metal concentrations in fish muscles were assessed for human
   consumption according to provisional tolerable weekly intake. The
   estimated values of Pb, Cd and Hg in M. cephalus's edible parts in this
   study were below the values established by the Joint WHO/FAO Expert
   Committee on Food Additives. Therefore, it can be concluded that there

Abstract = {In 2011, Trypanosoma equiperdum reemerged in Italy, almost 10 years
   after its last appearance. A total of eight infected horses have been
   observed to date. Six horses were affected by natural outbreaks of the
   disease, whereas two were infected experimentally. The aim of this study
   was to offer a recent perspective on clinical cases of dourine in
   Europe. Investigation of the clinical aspects confirmed the three stages
   reported in the literature: stage 1 (genital lesions), stage 2
   (cutaneous signs), and stage 3 (nervous signs). The most common signs in
   the horses under study were notable weight loss, edematous skin
   eruptions and oedemas of the abdomen, mammary glands and hind legs.
   Three animals presented neurological signs (lip ptosis of lower lip and
   ataxia). Infections were paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic in some
   animals. Hyperthermia was not reported in infected animals and
   considerable anemia was observed. High antibody titers did not always
   correspond to clinical signs. Positive polymerase chain reaction test
   results of blood or tissue (skin, eye swab) often correspond to an
   advanced stage of the disease. Dourine is a variable disease; owing to
   its low prevalence and chronic manifestation, it can be difficult to
   make a quick diagnosis when facing a Dourine-positive horse. (C) 2013

Abstract = {Two European laboratories independently detected atypical bovine

   to exclude possible contamination of the Australian FBS with that of
   South American origin during manufacturing/packaging in European
   countries. RT-PCR amplification of partial 5untranslated region and the
   complete Npro gene yielded a specific band with expected size, which was
   confirmed by DNA sequencing. Bayesian analysis of sequence data
   demonstrated a closer phylogenetic relation of the newly detected
   atypical bovine pestiviruses to those of South American origin, which
   were related to the recognized bovine pestivirus species, bovine viral
   diarrhoea virus. Taken together, the results indicated the presence of
   atypical bovine pestiviruses in the Australian FBS, and most likely in

Abstract = {Brucella spp. was isolated from brain, lung and intestinal lymph nodes
   of a dead adult male striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba) found
   stranded on the Tyrrhenian coast (Tuscany, Italy) of the Mediterranean
   Sea in February 2012. Brucella spp. was associated with moderate to
   severe lesions of meningoencephalitis. A co-infection by Toxoplasma
   gondii was also demonstrated at brain level by means of molecular and
   histopathologic methods. The Brucella isolate was further characterized
   based on a fragment-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach,
   consisting of a set of five specific PCBs, targeting specific
   chromosomal IS711 locations for marine mammal Brucellae, as described
   previously. The isolate was thus classified as Brucella ceti I; V
   fragment-positive (or B. ceti dolphin type), according to previous
   studies. Multi Locus Sequence Analysis demonstrated that the isolate
   belongs to Sequence Type 26, while omp2 (omp2a and omp2b genes) sequence
   analysis further confirmed the isolate belonged to this group of
   strains. This is the first report of Brucella spp. from marine mammals
   in the Mediterranean Sea, and represents a further observation that this
   strain group is associated with hosts of the Family Delphinidae, and
   particularly with the striped dolphins, also in the Mediterranean area,
   thus constituting a further biological hazard of concern for this
   vulnerable subpopulation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Ovine subclinical mastitis: Proteomic analysis of whey and milk fat
   globules unveils putative diagnostic biomarkers in milk},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PROTEOMICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {83},
Pages = {144-159},
Month = {MAY 27},
Abstract = {Subclinical mastitis is one of the main causes of alteration in milk
   content and has a major impact on both animal welfare and economy in the
   dairy industry. A better knowledge is needed to understand the ovine
   mammary gland metabolism and its response to bacterial infection. In
   this study, the proteomic changes in ovine milk as a result of
   subclinical mastitis were investigated by comparing both whey and fat
   globule membrane profiles of samples from Staphylococcus
   chromogenes-positive individuals, with those from non-infected
   counterparts having high or low somatic cell count; the latter were used
   as control. 2-DE and combined MS procedures were utilized for this
   purpose. Although sample bromatological parameters were very similar,
   proteomic analysis highlighted significant differences between the three
   experimental groups. Most relevant changes were observed between samples
   of infected milk and control. Modifications related to the defense
   response of the mammary gland to the pathogen were evident, with
   important consequences on nutritional and technological properties of
   milk. On the other hand, quantitative protein changes between
   non-infected samples with low and high levels of somatic cells indicated
   that the latter may result as a consequence of a probable unpaired
   cellular metabolism due to cellular stress, hormonal variations or
   previous infections. Putative biomarkers useful for the monitoring of
   sheep mammary metabolism and for the careful management of ovine
   subclinical mastitis to avoid its clinical degeneration are proposed and
   discussed.
   Biological significance
   Proteomics has been here applied to the differentiation of healthy and
   subclinical mastitic sheep milk samples, evidencing the response of the
   mammary gland to S. chromo genes infection. Presented results propose
   useful protein biomarkers for the detection of ewe mammary infection at
   its subclinical stages and, subsequently, mastitis recognition and
   treatment. Differently from bovine, these data confirm that the increase
   in somatic cell count in sheep milk is not always associated with
   protein factors that characterize the mammary gland infection;
   accordingly, somatic cell count cannot be considered as a useful
   parameter to certainly diagnose subclinical mastitis in ovine. (C) 2013

Title = {Salmonella serotypes in wild boars (Sus scrofa) hunted in northern Italy},
Journal = {ACTA VETERINARIA SCANDINAVICA},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {55},
Month = {MAY 21},
Abstract = {Background: Salmonella species (spp.) are zoonotic enteric bacteria able
   to infect humans, livestock and wildlife. However, little is known about
   the prevalence and the presence of the different serovars in wildlife.
   Considering the wide distribution of wild boars and the feeding
   behaviour (omnivorous scavengers), wild boars may be a good indicator
   for environmental presence of Salmonella spp. The aims of this study
   were to determine the presence of Salmonella spp. in hunted wild boars
   and to determine the serotype the isolated strains.
   Findings: Over three hunting seasons, the intestinal contents of 1,313
   boars hunted in northern Italy were sampled and cultured. Salmonella
   spp. were isolated from 326 boars (24.82\%). Thirty different serovars
   belonging to three different S. enterica spp. were found. Twenty-one
   serovars of S. enterica subsp. Enterica were found including the human
   pathogens S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis. In addition, nine serovars
   belonging to S. enterica subsp. diarizonae and S. enterica subsp.
   houtenae were detected.
   Conclusions: Considering the widespread occurrence of wild boars in
   Europe, the epidemiological role of this species in relation to
   salmonellosis might be relevant and should be further investigated. Wild
   boars may act as healthy carriers of a wide range of Salmonella
   serotypes.},

Abstract = {Source attribution of cases of food-borne disease represents a valuable
   tool for identifying and prioritizing effective food-safety
   interventions. Microbial subtyping is one of the most common methods to
   infer potential sources of human food-borne infections. So far,
   Salmonella microbial subtyping source attribution models have been
   implemented by using serotyping and phage-typing data. Molecular-based
   methods may prove to be similarly valuable in the future, as already
   demonstrated for other food-borne pathogens like Campylobacter. This
   review assesses the state of the art concerning Salmonella source
   attribution through microbial subtyping approach. It summarizes the
   available microbial subtyping attribution models and discusses the use
   of conventional phenotypic typing methods, as well as of the most
   commonly applied molecular typing methods in the European Union (EU)
   laboratories in the context of their potential applicability for
   Salmonella source attribution studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Prevalence, characterization and antimicrobial susceptibility of
   Salmonella enterica and Yersinia enterocolitica in pigs at slaughter in
   Italy},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {163},

Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {In 2005-2008, 1152 samples (451 faecal samples, 451 carcass swabs and
   250 tonsils) were collected from 451 finishing pigs slaughtered in three
   abattoirs of northern Italy. In two abattoirs, 34 scalding water samples
   were collected. The aim of this study was to investigate the faecal and
   palatine tonsil carriage rate of Salmonella enterica and Yersinia
   enterocolitica in pigs at slaughter and the degree of carcass
   contamination by these bacteria Typing of the isolates, virulence
   characterization and antimicrobial testing were also performed.
   S. enterica was isolated from 21.5\% of the faecal samples, 10.9\% of
   the carcasses and 10.4\% of the tonsils, but not from scalding water.
   Nineteen different serovars were identified among 172 S. enterica
   isolates. The prevalent serovars were Derby (41.3\%), Rissen (12.2\%),
   Typhimurium (11\%), 4,{[}5],12:i:-(8.7\%) and Give (4.1\%). S. enterica
   ser. Typhimurium and S. enterica ser. 4,{[}5],12:i:-isolates were
   phage-typed and PT DT120 was the most common (23.5\%). Y. enterocolitica
   was detected in 17.1\% of the faecal samples, 2.4\% of the carcasses,
   10.8\% of the tonsils and 11.8\% of the scalding water samples. A total
   of 119 isolates were found, four of them in water. Of the 115 Y.
   enterocolitica isolates of pig origin, 24 (20.9\%) were 4/O:3 and 4
   (3.5\%) were 2/O:9. Y. enterocolitica 4/O:3 represented 85.7\% of the
   pathogenic isolates found in all types of samples and 100\% of those
   found in tonsils. In 4/O:3 isolates the most common virulence-associated
   genes were ystA (100\%), inv (95.8\%), ail (87.5\%) and yadA (54.2\%).
   In 2/O:9 isolates the prevalent genes were ail (100\%), inv (100\%) and
   ystA (100\%), followed by ystB (25.0\%). The majority (75.7\%) of Y.
   enterocolitica isolates was biotype 1A, belonging to 13 serotypes (O:3;
   O:5; O:4,32-4,33; O:6,30-6,31; O:7,8-8; O:7,8-8-8,19; O:7,13; O:8; O:9;
   O:13; O:16-16,29; O:41,42-41,43; O:52). The most common virulence genes
   in 1A isolates were inv (95.4\%) and ystB (72.4\%).
   The antimicrobial resistance test showed that all Salmonella isolates
   were susceptible to cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, cefalothin, gentamicin
   and enrofloxacin. Resistances to tetracycline (56\%), sulphonamide
   compounds (42\%) and streptomycin (34\%) were the most common. All Y.
   enterocolitica isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime,
   cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, enrofloxacin, gentamicin, kanamicin and
   neomycin. Most isolates were resistant to cefalothin (92\%) and
   ampicillin (89\%).
   Apparently, carcass contamination by S. enterica and Y. enterocolitica
   was more likely attributable to cross-contamination than to
   self-contamination, suggesting that good hygienic measures and
   slaughtering procedures can control transmission of these pathogens to
   pork meat. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Marine bacteria exposed to antibiotics in fish farms can acquire
   antimicrobial resistance by mobile genetic elements and horizontal gene
   transfer. A total of 872 autochthonous marine bacterial strains was
   isolated from samples collected from four different fish farms located
   at northern and southern Italian Adriatic Sea. Resistance to only
   tetracycline (17\%) and to trimethoprim-sulfadiazine (7\%) were the most
   frequent patterns obtained, while flumequine resistance has recorded in
   only 0.3\% of the strains. Comparing strains isolated from coastal areas
   and fish farms, a significant higher incidence (4\% versus 10\%) of
   multi-resistant strains in aquaculture centers was found. Significant
   differences in antibiotic resistance incidence were also detected among
   the four fish farms due probably to different approaches in farm
   management and the more or less frequent use of antibiotics.
   Antibiotic-resistant and multiresistant strains isolated constitute an
   environmental reservoir directly involved in the seafood chain and might
   represent a public health concern. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Exploring the larval transcriptome of the common sole (Solea solea L.)},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {14},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {Background: The common sole (Solea solea) is a promising candidate for
   European aquaculture; however, the limited knowledge of the
   physiological mechanisms underlying larval development in this species
   has hampered the establishment of successful flatfish aquaculture.
   Although the fact that genomic tools and resources are available for
   some flatfish species, common sole genomics remains a mostly unexplored
   field. Here, we report, for the first time, the sequencing and
   characterisation of the transcriptome of S. solea and its application
   for the study of molecular mechanisms underlying physiological and
   morphological changes during larval-to-juvenile transition.
   Results: The S. solea transcriptome was generated from whole larvae and
   adult tissues using the Roche 454 platform. The assembly process
   produced a set of 22,223 Isotigs with an average size of 726 nt, 29
   contigs and a total of 203,692 singletons. Of the assembled sequences,
   75.2\% were annotated with at least one known transcript/protein; these
   transcripts were then used to develop a custom oligo-DNA microarray. A
   total of 14,674 oligonucleotide probes (60 nt), representing 12,836
   transcripts, were in situ synthesised onto the array using Agilent
   non-contact ink-jet technology. The microarray platform was used to
   investigate the gene expression profiles of sole larvae from hatching to
   the juvenile form. Genes involved in the ontogenesis of the visual
   system are up-regulated during the early stages of larval development,
   while muscle development and anaerobic energy pathways increase in
   expression over time. The gene expression profiles of key transcripts of
   the thyroid hormones (TH) cascade and the temporal regulation of the
   GH/IGF1 (growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor I) system suggest a
   pivotal role of these pathways in fish growth and initiation of
   metamorphosis. Pre-metamorphic larvae display a distinctive
   transcriptomic landscape compared to previous and later stages. Our
   findings highlighted the up-regulation of gene pathways involved in the
   development of the gastrointestinal system as well as biological
   processes related to folic acid and retinol metabolism. Additional
   evidence led to the formation of the hypothesis that molecular
   mechanisms of cell motility and ECM adhesion may play a role in tissue
   rearrangement during common sole metamorphosis.
   Conclusions: Next-generation sequencing provided a good representation
   of the sole transcriptome, and the combination of different approaches
   led to the annotation of a high number of transcripts. The construction
   of a microarray platform for the characterisation of the larval sole
   transcriptome permitted the definition of the main processes involved in
   organogenesis and larval growth.},

Title = {Usutu Virus Persistence and West Nile Virus Inactivity in the
   Emilia-Romagna Region (Italy) in 2011},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 7},
Abstract = {Background: The circulation of West Nile virus and Usutu virus was
   detected in the Emilia-Romagna region in 2008 and 2009. To evaluate the
   extent of circulation of both viruses, environmental surveillance, based
   on bird and mosquito testing, was conducted in 2008 and gradually
   improved over the years.
   Methods: In February-March 2009-2011, 5,993 hibernating mosquitoes were
   manually sampled, out of which 80.1\% were Culex pipiens; none tested
   positive for the viruses. From 2008 to 2011, 946,213 mosquitoes, sampled
   between May and October, were tested; 86.5\% were Cx. pipiens. West Nile
   virus was detected in 32 Cx. pipiens pools, and Usutu virus was detected
   in 229 mosquito pools (217 Cx. pipiens, 10 Aedes albopictus, one
   Anopheles maculipennis s.l., and one Aedes caspius). From 2009 to 2011,
   of 4,546 birds collected, 42 tested positive for West Nile virus and 48
   for Usutu virus. West Nile virus and Usutu virus showed different
   patterns of activity during the 2008-2011 surveillance period. West Nile
   virus was detected in 2008, 2009, and 2010, but not in 2011. Usutu
   virus, however, was continuously active throughout 2009, 2010, and 2011.
   Conclusions: The data strongly suggest that both viruses overwinter in
   the surveyed area rather than being continually reintroduced every
   season. The lack of hibernating mosquitoes testing positive for the
   viruses and the presence of positive birds sampled early in the season
   support the hypothesis that the viruses overwinter in birds rather than
   in mosquitoes. Herd immunity in key bird species could explain the
   decline of West Nile virus observed in 2011, while the persistence of
   Usutu virus may be explained by not yet identified reservoirs. Reported
   results are comparable with a peri-Mediterranean circulation of the West
   Nile virus lineage 1 related strain, which became undetectable in the
   environment after two to three years of obvious circulation.},

Title = {Spatial Transmission of Swine Vesicular Disease Virus in the 2006-2007
   Epidemic in Lombardy},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 7},
Abstract = {In 2006 and 2007 pig farming in the region of Lombardy, in the north of
   Italy, was struck by an epidemic of Swine Vesicular Disease virus
   (SVDV). In fact this epidemic could be viewed as consisting of two
   sub-epidemics, as the reported outbreaks occurred in two separate time
   periods. These periods differed in terms of the provinces or
   municipalities that were affected and also in terms of the timing of
   implementation of movement restrictions. Here we use a simple
   mathematical model to analyse the epidemic data, quantifying
   between-farm transmission probability as a function of between-farm
   distance. The results show that the distance dependence of between-farm
   transmission differs between the two periods. In the first period
   transmission over relatively long distances occurred with higher
   probability than in the second period, reflecting the effect of movement
   restrictions in the second period. In the second period however, more
   intensive transmission occurred over relatively short distances. Our
   model analysis explains this in terms of the relatively high density of
   pig farms in the area most affected in this period, which exceeds a
   critical farm density for between-farm transmission. This latter result
   supports the rationale for the additional control measure taken in 2007
   of pre-emptively culling farms in that area.},

Title = {Effect of induced ruminal acidosis on blood variables in heifers},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAY 6},
Abstract = {Background: Ruminal acidosis is responsible for the onset of different
   pathologies in dairy and feedlot cattle, but there are major
   difficulties in the diagnosis. This study modelled the data obtained
   from various blood variables to identify those that could indicate the
   severity of ruminal acidosis. Six heifers were fed three experimental
   rations throughout three periods. The diets were characterised by
   different starch levels: high starch (HS), medium starch (MS) and low
   starch, as the control diet (CT). Ruminal pH values were continuously
   measured using wireless sensors and compared with pH measurements
   obtained by rumenocentesis. Blood samples were analysed for complete
   blood count, biochemical profile, venous blood gas, blood
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and LPS-binding proteins (LBP).
   Results: The regression coefficient comparing the ruminal pH values,
   obtained using the two methods, was 0.56 (P = 0.040). Feeding the CT, MS
   and HS led to differences in the time spent below the 5.8, 5.5 and 5.0
   pH thresholds and in several variables, including dry matter intake (7.7
   vs. 6.9 vs. 5.1 kg/d; P = 0.002), ruminal nadir pH (5.69 vs. 5.47 vs.
   5.44; P = 0.042), mean ruminal pH (6.50 vs. 6.34 vs. 6.31; P = 0.012),
   haemoglobin level (11.1 vs. 10.9 vs. 11.4 g/dL; P = 0.010), platelet
   count (506 vs. 481 vs. 601; P = 0.008), HCO3- (31.8 vs. 31.3 vs. 30.6
   mmol/L; P = 0.071) and LBP (5.9 vs. 9.5 vs. 10.5 mu g/mL; P < 0.001). A
   canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) was used to classify the animals
   into four ruminal pH classes (normal, risk of acidosis, subacute ruminal
   acidosis and acute ruminal acidosis) using haemoglobin, mean platelet
   volume, beta-hydroxybutyrate, glucose and reduced haemoglobin.
   Conclusions: Although additional studies are necessary to confirm the
   reliability of these discriminant functions, the use of plasma variables
   in a multifactorial model appeared to be useful for the evaluation of
   ruminal acidosis severity.},

   Sheep},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {In sheep scrapie, pathological prion protein (PrPSc) deposition occurs
   in the lymphoreticular and central nervous systems. We investigated
   PrPSc distribution in scrapie-affected sheep showing simultaneous
   evidence of chronic lymphofollicular,
   lymphoproliferative/non-lymphofollicular, and/or granulomatous
   inflammations in their mammary gland, lung, and ileum. To do this, PrPSc
   detection was carried out via immunohistochemistry and Western Blotting
   techniques, as well as through inflammatory cell immunophenotyping.
   Expression studies of gene coding for biological factors modulating the
   host's inflammatory response were also carried out. We demonstrated that
   ectopic PrPSc deposition occurs exclusively in the context of
   lymphofollicular inflammatory sites, inside newly formed and
   well-organized lymphoid follicles harboring follicular dendritic cells.
   On the contrary, no PrPSc deposition was detected in granulomas, even
   when they were closely located to newly formed lymphoid follicles. A
   significantly more consistent expression of lymphotoxin alpha and beta
   mRNA was detected in lymphofollicular inflammation compared to the other
   two types, with lymphotoxin alpha and beta signaling new lymphoid
   follicles' formation and, likely, the occurrence of ectopic PrPSc
   deposition inside them. Our findings suggest that, in sheep co-affected
   by scrapie and chronic inflammatory conditions, only newly formed
   lymphoid follicles provide a suitable micro-environment that supports
   the scrapie agent's replication in inflammatory sites, with an increased
   risk of prion shedding through body secretions/excretions.},

Abstract = {An effective vaccine that improves the control of contagious agalactia
   in Mediterranean regions would be beneficial for poorer farmers who use
   traditional husbandry methods for sheep and goat production. However
   while there is little published data on the efficacy of commercially
   available vaccines for contagious agalactia, evidence from the field
   suggests that some provide inadequate protection. This paper compares
   four different vaccine formulations, including a widely used commercial
   vaccine, using clinical signs and mycoplasma excretion as measures of
   protection in sheep. Results showed that protection afforded by the
   vaccines, following contact challenge with experimentally infected ewes,
   varied considerably. A live attenuated vaccine, presently forbidden in
   the European Union, conferred the best clinical protection, despite a
   lack of serological response, followed by a vaccine prepared by
   inactivating the mycoplasmas with saponin. A commercial vaccine
   inactivated with formalin provided no protection against this disease.

Abstract = {Increasing world population worsens the serious problem of food security
   in developing countries. On the other hand in industrialized countries,
   where the problem of food security is of minor concern, health problems
   related to food refer to 2 main factors: food safety and environmental
   sustainability of food production. For these reasons, new ways must be
   found to increase yields while preserving food quality, natural
   habitats, and biodiversity. Insects could be of great interest as a
   possible solution due to their capability to satisfy 2 different
   requirements: (i) they are an important source of protein and other
   nutrients; (ii) their use as food has ecological advantages over
   conventional meat and, in the long run, economic benefits. However,
   little is known on the food safety side and this can be of critical
   importance to meet society's approval, especially if people are not
   accustomed to eating insects. This paper aims to collect information in
   order to evaluate how insects could be safely used as food and to
   discuss nutritional data to justify why insect food sources can no
   longer be neglected. Legislative issues will also be discussed.},

Abstract = {The study concerns the presence of Brucella spp. in the stretched curd
   cheese produced in an area characterized by the presence of a relevant
   number of herds infected with Brucella spp. One hundred ninety-one
   cheese samples made with milk from different species were tested by two
   molecular assays. Positive samples were further submitted to sequence
   analysis of the IS711 gene. Eleven out of 98 of the samples made with
   buffalo milk alone resulted contaminated. The prevalence in cheese
   samples from cow milk alone and milk from cow and buffalo was 2.7\% and
   10.5\%, respectively. No sample was positive to the microbiological
   Office International des Epizooties detection tests of Brucella spp.
   Practical Application The aim of the study is to evaluate the use of
   molecular assays as a tool to support microbiological and immunological
   tests carried out to eradicate brucellosis. Molecular assays shows to be
   a useful aid for the monitoring of herds health and the safety of dairy
   products evaluation; furthermore, their application to dairy products
   allows the implementation of the procedures to trace those infected
   farms that supply milk to dairies.},

Title = {Serological diagnosis of avian influenza in poultry: is the
   haemagglutination inhibition test really the ``gold standard'?},

Abstract = {Background The serological diagnosis of avian influenza (AI) can be
   performed using different methods, yet the haemagglutination inhibition
   (HI) test is considered the gold standard' for AI antibody subtyping.
   Although alternative diagnostic assays have been developed, in most
   cases, their accuracy has been evaluated in comparison with HI test
   results, whose performance for poultry has not been properly evaluated.
   Objective The objective of this study was to estimate the diagnostic
   sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of the HI test and six other
   diagnostic assays for the detection of AI antibodies without assuming a
   gold standard. Methods We applied a Bayesian version of latent class
   analysis to compare the results of multiple tests from different study
   settings reported in the literature. Results The results showed that the
   HI test has nearly perfect accuracy (i.e. 98 center dot 8\% sensitivity
   and 99 center dot 5\% specificity). It performed well in both chickens
   and turkeys and yet was less accurate in experimentally infected
   poultry, compared to naturally infected. Blocking ELISA and the indirect
   immunofluorescence assay also performed very well. Conclusions Given its
   very high Se and Sp, the HI test may be effectively considered a gold
   standard. In the framework of LPAI surveillance, where large numbers of
   samples have to be processed, the blocking ELISA could be a valid
   alternative to the HI test, in that it is almost as sensitive and
   specific as the HI test yet quicker and easier to automate.},

Abstract = {The risks associated with zoonotic infections transmitted by companion
   animals are a serious public health concern: the control of zoonoses
   incidence in domestic dogs, both owned and stray, is hence important to
   protect human health. Integrated dog population management (DPM)
   programs, based on the availability of information systems providing
   reliable data on the structure and composition of the existing dog
   population in a given area, are fundamental for making realistic plans
   for any disease surveillance and action system. Traceability systems,
   based on the compulsory electronic identification of dogs and their
   registration in a computerised database, are one of the most effective
   ways to ensure the usefulness of DPM programs. Even if this approach
   provides many advantages, several areas of improvement have emerged in
   countries where it has been applied. In Italy, every region hosts its
   own dog register but these are not compatible with one another. This
   paper shows the advantages of a web-based-application to improve data
   management of dog regional registers. The approach used for building
   this system was inspired by farm animal traceability schemes and it
   relies on a network of services that allows multi-channel access by
   different devices and data exchange via the web with other existing
   applications, without changing the pre-existing platforms. Today the
   system manages a database for over 300,000 dogs registered in three
   different Italian regions. By integrating multiple Web Services, this
   approach could be the solution to gather data at national and
   international levels at reasonable cost and creating a traceability
   system on a large scale and across borders that can be used for disease
   surveillance and development of population management plans. (C) 2012

Abstract = {A serological survey was carried out in the northern prefectures of
   Hokkaido, Iwate and Aomori in Japan, for the presence of antibodies
   against Toxoplasma gondii, Chlamydia psittaci var. ovis, Mycobacterium
   paratuberculosis, Coxiella burnetii, Brucella spp., Leptospirosis and
   Orf virus (ORFV). Out of 267 samples tested, highest overall prevalence
   (28.78\%) was found for T gondii. The 12.59\% of tested sheep were

Title = {Climate change and the spread of vector-borne diseases: using

Abstract = {Bluetongue (BT) is a commonly cited example of a disease with a
   distribution believed to have recently expanded in response to global
   warming. The BT virus is transmitted to ruminants by biting midges of
   the genus Culicoides, and it has been hypothesized that the emergence of
   BT in Mediterranean Europe during the last two decades is a consequence
   of the recent colonization of the region by Culicoides imicola and
   linked to climate change. To better understand the mechanism responsible
   for the northward spread of BT, we tested the hypothesis of a recent
   colonization of Italy by C.imicola, by obtaining samples from more than
   60 localities across Italy, Corsica, Southern France, and Northern
   Africa (the hypothesized source point for the recent invasion of
   C.imicola), and by genotyping them with 10 newly identified
   microsatellite loci. The patterns of genetic variation within and among
   the sampled populations were characterized and used in a rigorous
   approximate Bayesian computation framework to compare three competing
   historical hypotheses related to the arrival and establishment of
   C.imicola in Italy. The hypothesis of an ancient presence of the insect
   vector was strongly favoured by this analysis, with an associated P99\%,
   suggesting that causes other than the northward range expansion of
   C.imicola may have supported the emergence of BT in southern Europe.
   Overall, this study illustrates the potential of molecular genetic
   markers for exploring the assumed link between climate change and the
   spread of diseases.},

Abstract = {Histamine content was tested on 311 samples of fresh fish and fish
   products collected in Puglia (Italy) in the years 2009-2011. The
   analyses were carried out employing ELISA for screening and HPLC to
   confirm suspicious non-compliant samples according to Commission
   Regulation (EC) 1441/2007. Histamine concentration >2.5 mg kg(-1) was
   detected in 58\% of total samples with 5\% of non-compliance. Among 216
   samples of fresh fish, 70\% had a content of histamine less than 10 mg
   kg(-1), while a percentage of 6\% showed histamine level higher than 100
   mg kg(-1). Although for processed anchovies a contamination below 50 mg
   kg(-1) in 21 samples (75\%) was observed, the highest percentage of
   ``non-compliant{''} samples (14\%) was found. Good quality of canned
   tuna and canned mackerel was demonstrated by histamine content lower
   than 10 mg kg(-1). The validation of both ELISA and HPLC methods and the
   optimization of the confirmatory method were also reported. (C) 2012

Abstract = {The relationship between Vibrio parahaemolyticus strains isolated from
   the aquatic environment and those isolated from cases of infection in
   humans is poorly understood due to the low prevalence of tdh- and/or
   trh-positive strains in the environment. To address this concern, it
   would be useful to analyse the genetic relationships among environmental
   and food strains and with reference to clinical isolates, also applying
   molecular typing methods. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   prevalence of toxigenic V.parahaemolyticus in Italian coastal waters and
   seafood, to examine intra-species variability and to identify, using
   serotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), relationships
   among strains from different sources, geographical origin and period of
   isolation. Of the 192 V.parahaemolyticus strains isolated in different
   Italian areas and examined in this study, 25 (13.0\%) proved to carry
   the trh gene while none of the strains proved positive to the search by
   PCR for tdh and Group-Specific-toxRS genes. The prevalence of toxigenic
   strains in the Tyrrhenian Sea was significantly lower than that
   calculated for the Ligurian coasts. Regarding the sources of isolation,
   the higher prevalence of trh-positive V.parahaemolyticus was revealed in
   fish, followed by clams, plankton, oysters, mussels and lastly seawater.
   Within the toxigenic strains, 16 serotypes and 20 distinct PFGE patterns
   were identified. Two clusters, which included a total of 8
   V.parahaemolyticus strains, were specifically associated with the North
   Adriatic Sea area and were stable over time. Our results demonstrate
   that trh-positive V.parahaemolyticus strains circulated in Italy in the
   period 20022009 with a prevalence higher than that reported from other
   European and extra-European countries, confirming that toxigenic
   V.parahaemolyticus is an emerging public health concern in Italy,
   regardless of its pandemic potential.},

Abstract = {The European Commission Recommendation 2006/576/EC, suggests that the
   maximum level of Ochratoxin A (OTA) in poultry feeds should be set at
   0.1mg OTA/kg. Thirty-six one-day-old male Hubburd broiler chickens were
   divided into two groups, a Control (basal diet) and an Ochratoxin A
   (basal diet + 0.1mg OTA/kg) group. The growth and slaughter performance
   traits were recorded. The liver, spleen, bursa of Fabricius and thymus
   weights were measured. The erythrocyte and leukocyte numbers were
   assayed in blood samples, and the heterophils to lymphocytes (H/L) ratio
   was determined. Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), lysozyme, the total
   protein and the electrophoretic pattern were evaluated in serum samples.
   Liver enzymes (alanino aminotransferase, ALT and aspartate
   aminotransferase, AST) and kidney function parameters (uric acid and
   creatinine) were quantified. The results revealed that feeding a 0.1mg
   OTA/kg contaminated diet to chicks caused a decrease in the absolute
   thymus weight (p<0.05) and a lower total protein (p<0.01), albumin
   (p<0.01), alpha (p<0.05), beta (p=0.001) and gamma (p=0.001) globulins
   serum concentration in the Ochratoxin A group. Moreover, the
   albumin-to-globulin (A/G) ratio of the OTA-treated animals resulted to
   be higher (p<0.05). Feeding broiler chickens, a diet contaminated with
   the maximum level admitted by the European Commission Recommendation
   (0.1mg OTA/kg), did not affect the animal performance, slaughter traits,
   organ weights, haematological parameters, liver enzyme or renal function
   parameters concentrations but had an overall immunosuppressant effect,
   with reduction in the thymus weight and of the total serum protein,
   albumin, alpha, beta and gamma globulins concentration.},

Abstract = {Failure to respond to commercial limited antigen diets can occur in dogs
   kept on a dietary trial for the diagnosis of adverse food reaction
   (AFR). The aim of this study was to assess twelve canine dry limited
   antigen diets (eleven novel protein diets and one hydrolysed diet) for
   potential contamination by ingredients of animal origin not mentioned on
   the label. The validity of the two methods adopted for the detection of
   such food antigens was also evaluated. Each dietary product was analysed
   by microscopy analysis using the official method described in Commission
   Regulation EC 152/2009 with the aim of identifying bone fragments of
   different zoological classes (mammalian, avian and fish) and by
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the identification of DNA of animal
   origin. Discrepancies between the results obtained by PCR and/or
   microscopy analysis and the ingredients listed on pet food packages were
   found. Only in two pet foods did the results of both analyses match the
   ingredients listed on the label. In the remaining ten samples,
   microscopy detected bone fragments from one or two unpredicted
   zoological classes, revealing avian fragments in six of ten samples
   followed by those of fish in five of ten and mammalian fragments in four
   of ten. In two samples, microscopy analysis identified a contamination
   that would have otherwise passed unobserved if only PCR had been used.
   However, PCR confirmed the presence of all the zoological classes
   detected by microscopy and also identified the DNA of an additional
   unexpected zoological class in two samples. Dogs might fail to respond
   to commercial limited antigen diets because such diets are contaminated
   with potential allergens. Both PCR and microscopy analysis are required
   to guarantee the absence of undeclared animal sources in pet foods.
   Before ruling out AFR, a novel protein home-made diet should be
   considered if the dog is unresponsive to a commercial regimen.},

Abstract = {Listeriosis is a disease that causes significant economic losses at the
   farm level because of high morbidity and mortality in ruminants. This
   study was performed to investigate the role of ruminants in the
   epidemiology of listeriosis in northern Italy and the possible
   association of animal-adapted strains of Listeria monocytogenes with
   strains associated with human disease. Twenty ruminant rhombencephalitis
   isolates previously confirmed as L. monocytogenes by bacteriology and
   PCR were characterized by serotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis,
   multi-virulence-locus sequence typing (MVLST), and multiplex single
   nucleotide polymorphism (mSNP) typing for the detection of epidemic
   clones. Subtyping results were subsequently compared with those obtained
   from human, food, and environmental isolates of L. monocytogenes,
   including 311 isolates from the University of Turin, Grugliasco, Italy,
   and 165 isolates representing major human listeriosis outbreaks
   worldwide, in addition to other unrelated isolates. Both mSNP typing and
   MVLST showed that 60\% of the isolates analyzed belonged to epidemic
   clone I (ECI), which has been epidemiologically linked to several human
   outbreaks of listeriosis. In particular, the 1981 Canada outbreak was
   linked to the use of sheep manure and the 1985 California outbreak was
   linked to the use of raw cow's milk. In our study, ECI isolates were
   collected from different ruminant species on geographically and
   temporally distinct occasions for the last 13 years. Our results support
   the hypothesis that ruminants represent possible natural reservoirs of
   L. monocytogenes strains capable of causing epidemics of listeriosis in
   humans.},

Title = {Prevalence of brucellosis in dairy cattle from the main dairy farming

Abstract = {In order to get a reliable estimate of brucellosis prevalence in
   Eritrean dairy cattle, a cross-sectional study was carried out in 2009.
   The survey considered the sub-population of dairy cattle reared in
   modern small-and medium-sized farms. Samples were screened with the Rose
   Bengal test (RBT) and positive cases were confirmed with the complement
   fixation test (CFT). A total of 2.77\% (417/15 049; Credibility Interval
   CI: 2.52\% - 3.05\%) of the animals tested in this study were positive
   for antibodies to Brucella species, with a variable and generally low
   distribution of positive animals at regional level. The highest
   seroprevalence was found in the Maekel region (5.15\%; CI: 4.58\% -
   5.80\%), followed by the Debub (1.99\%; CI: 1.59\% - 2.50\%) and
   Gash-Barka (1.71\%; CI: 1.34\% - 2.20\%) regions. Seroprevalence at
   sub-regional levels was also generally low, except for two sub-regions
   of Debub and the sub-region Haicota from the Gash-Barka region.
   Seroprevalence was high and more uniformly distributed in the Maekel
   region, namely in the Asmara, Berik and Serejeka sub-regions.
   Considering the overall low brucellosis prevalence in the country, as
   identified by the present study, a brucellosis eradication programme for
   dairy farms using a test-and-slaughter policy would be possible.
   However, to encourage the voluntary participation of farmers to the
   programme and to raise their awareness of the risks related to the
   disease for animals and humans, an extensive public awareness campaign
   should be carefully considered, as well as strict and mandatory dairy
   movement control.},

Abstract = {Since 2006 the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) population in north-eastern Italy
   has experienced an epidemic of canine distemper virus (CDV).
   Additionally, in 2008, after a thirteen-year absence from Italy, fox
   rabies was re-introduced in the Udine province at the national border
   with Slovenia. Disease intervention strategies are being developed and
   implemented to control rabies in this area and minimise risk to human
   health. Here we present empirical data and the epidemiological picture
   relating to these epidemics in the period 2006-2010. Of important
   significance for epidemiological studies of wild animals, basic
   mathematical models are developed to exploit information collected from
   the surveillance program on dead and/or living animals in order to
   assess the incidence of infection. These models are also used to
   estimate the rate of transmission of both diseases and the rate of
   vaccination, while correcting for a bias in early collection of CDV
   samples. We found that the rate of rabies transmission was roughly twice
   that of CDV, with an estimated effective contact between infected and
   susceptible fox leading to a new infection occurring once every 3 days
   for rabies, and once a week for CDV. We also inferred that during the
   early stage of the CDV epidemic, a bias in the monitoring protocol
   resulted in a positive sample being almost 10 times more likely to be
   collected than a negative sample. We estimated the rate of intake of
   oral vaccine at 0.006 per day, allowing us to estimate that roughly 68\%
   of the foxes would be immunised. This was confirmed by field
   observations. Finally we discuss the implications for the
   eco-epidemiological dynamics of both epidemics in relation to control
   measures.},

Abstract = {Mycoplasma agalactiae is a major pathogen of sheep and goats in many
   areas of the world and particularly in Mediterranean countries. It
   causes contagious agalactia, an infectious disease primarily affecting
   mammary glands. Many vaccines against the pathogen are currently under
   development. The aim of the study was to investigate the involvement of
   T cell-mediated immunity during vaccination and challenge experiments
   againstMycoplasma agalactiae. A comparison of the antigen-specific
   expansion of interferon gamma positive T cell memory and nave subsets
   was performed between vaccinated and non-vaccinated sheep to identify
   cellular subsets whose activation was different between protected and
   non-protected sheep. Data reported in this manuscript demonstrated that
   two out of the three vaccines used in this study protected sheep from
   the disease. In the protected groups CD4(+) memory interferon-gamma(+) T
   cells underwent an early expansion (p < 0.05 when compared to
   unprotected groups), whilst memory CD+ Interferon-gamma(+) T cells
   increased in non-protected animals 7 days after infection (p <0.05).
   gamma delta(+) Interferon-gamma(+) T cells reached peaks of expansion in
   infected and in two vaccinated groups thus indicating that these cells
   are not preferentially involved in protection or pathogenesis (p <0.05).
   Hereby we propose that the early activation of CD4(+) memory
   Interferon-gamma(+) T cells could be considered as a marker of
   protection from the disease as well as a tool to establish vaccine
   efficacy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Background: Infection by two or more canine vector-borne disease
   (CVBD)-causing pathogens is common in subtropical and tropical regions
   where vectors are plentiful. Co-infections may potentiate disease
   pathogenesis, thereby altering clinical manifestations typically
   associated with singular infections. These factors complicate diagnosis,
   treatment and can adversely influence prognosis if the practitioner
   fails to suspect, document, and treat each concurrent infection. The
   spectrum of pathogens co-infecting dogs may change over time in a given
   practice location due to the rapid expansion of arthropods and their
   associated vectored agents, and international transit among pets and
   wild animals. This applies, for example, to Dirofilaria immitis and
   Leishmania infantum, the distributions of which have expanded from
   northern to southern Italy, and vice versa, respectively. Indeed, mixed
   infections by D. immitis and L. infantum have only been reported once in
   Italy, probably due to the fact that competent vectors for these
   infections do not usually occur in the same geographical areas. Thus,
   information that would help practitioners to identify clinical
   presentations in dogs co-infected by D. immitis and L. infantum and
   other CVBD-causing pathogens is scant.
   Findings: This manuscript describes the clinical history and physical
   examination of findings for 7 CVBD co-infected dogs that were examined
   because of a spectrum of clinical signs. Five dogs were co-infected with
   L. infantum and Ehrlichia canis, one dog with L. infantum, E. canis and
   D. immitis and the remaining dog with L. infantum and D. immitis.
   Conclusions: The clinical signs and haematological abnormalities
   associated with the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of these dogs is
   discussed. Also, the usefulness of bone marrow specimens for the
   molecular diagnosis of CVBDs and for the enhanced monitoring of
   treatment response is emphasized.},

Title = {Aflatoxin M1 in bovine milk: screening and confirmation methods for
   monitoring in Piedmont},
Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Pages = {59-63},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Introduction - Aflatoxins are mycotoxins produced by many species of
   Aspergillus, a fungus, the most notable ones being A. flavus and A.
   parasiticus. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has
   classified aflatoxin B1 in group of molecules carcinogenic and the
   substance is considered the most powerful liver-carcinogenic for
   mammals.
   Aim - This paper reports the data of the monitoring carried out in
   Piedmont for the presence of aflatoxin M1 (AM1) in bovine milk. Data are
   referred to the period 2009-2011 and to different sampling plan,
   including the National Residues Plan and the Monitoring Plan of raw milk
   at vending machines.
   Materials and methods - In the period 2009-2011, a total of 1199 milk
   samples were analyzed at the laboratory Centro Latte. Among the
   different monitoring plans, the Monitoring Plan of raw milk at vending
   machines provided the largest number of samples (74\% of the total).
   Analyses were carried out with ELISA method for a screening step: when
   samples were suspected to be positive HPLC confirmation was performed.
   Results and discussion - A total of 16 milk samples (1.3\%) were
   non-negative by ELISA screening method. For these samples the
   quantitative confirmation analysis by HPLC was carried out: in three
   cases (one sample in 2009 and two samples in 2010) values exceeding the
   maximum residual level (MRL) of AM1 have been reported and respectively
   equal to 57, 82 and 96 ppt; the remaining nine samples gave results
   within the MRLs. Continuous sampling can monitor the concentration of
   AM1 in milk and allow to manage any emergencies that may arise.
   Conclusion - The analytical data of the past three years show that the
   AM1, with a total percentage of non-compliant samples representing
   approximately 0.25\% of the total, is not a risk for the consumer: the
   forecasts of climate change suggest that in the coming years there will
   be an increase in temperature and an altered distribution of rainfall
   which may favor the development of the main AM1 producers.},

Abstract = {The validation of food microbiology methods and assessment of
   measurement uncertainty are required for laboratories operating EN
   ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation systems. This paper aims to describes the
   statistical approach adopted by a multi-site laboratory to satisfy these
   requirements and to routinely check the performance of the methods. A
   validation protocol was performed, reflecting a great variability of
   experimental conditions, represented by the period of time during which
   determinations were made, the different laboratories concerned, the
   large number of technicians involved, the differences in the level of
   contamination of the matrix analyzed and the operating conditions
   (equipment, reagents, culture media, environmental conditions, etc.).
   Despite the very high variability of the experimental conditions, the
   values of repeatability and reproducibility obtained for the methods
   were lower than those stated in the respective regulations. In addition,
   the top-down approach adopted in this study is to be considered
   effective overtime and allows to randomize all variable factors,
   including the effects of sensitivity and specificity, in order to
   simulate the conditions of real reproducibility. A specific Excel
   spreadsheet was also developed for the routine expression of analytical
   results. This spreadsheet represents a very useful tool for operators to
   calculate and routinely check the results, as well as to assess the
   uncertainty of measurement. This particular quality assessment system is
   enabling the multi-site laboratory to implement the accuracy,
   reliability and comparability of the analytical results and to ensure
   the analytical control of data output.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was the comparative evaluation of an isothermal
   amplification and bioluminescence detection of DNA (IMBD) method and
   method ISO 6579: 2002 for detection of Salmonella in retail meat
   products of unknown contamination status. A total of 200 meat samples
   were tested: 116 minced meat and meat preparations to be eaten cooked
   (52 chicken, 48 pork, and 16 beef samples) and 84 fresh meat samples (68
   poultry and 16 pork). With one or both methods, 21 samples (10.5\%) were
   positive for Salmonella enterica. Fifteen samples were positive with
   both methods (71.4\% of all positive samples), two more samples (9.5\%)
   were positive with the IMBD method only, and four samples (19.1\%) were
   positive with the ISO method only. One ISO-positive sample was inhibited
   with the IMBD method. For the IMBD method, relative accuracy was 97.0\%
   (95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 93.6 to 98.9\%), relative sensitivity
   was 78.9\%(95\% CI, 54.4 to 93.9\%), and relative specificity was 98.9\%
   (95\% CI, 96.1 to 99.7\%). Time to negative results was shorter with the
   IMBD method (20 to 24 h). Also, positive results were available in 20 to
   24 h but should be confirmed using other methods (presumptive-positive
   results). Rapidity of response of the IMBD method gave us the
   opportunity to test the presumptive-positive samples by the
   most-probable-number (MPN) method, which was not performed for samples
   that were positive only with the ISO method because of likely microbial
   changes during the long storage period (5 to 7 days) at refrigeration
   temperature. Salmonella MPN values in naturally contaminated meat were
   low, at <0.3 to 2.1 MPN/g.},

Abstract = {The importance of Dermacentor spp. in the transmission of tick-borne
   pathogens is not well recognized in Europe. To investigate the role of
   Dermacentor spp. in the transmission of tick-borne pathogens, questing
   ticks were collected in 9 sites from southern to northwestern France
   (Camargue Delta to Eastern Brittany) where Dermacentor spp. exist and
   tick-borne diseases had occurred previously. Three tick species were
   collected during the spring and autumn of 2009. Collected ticks (both
   males and females) included D. marginatus (n = 377), D. reticulatus (n =
   74), and I. ricinus (n = 45). All ticks were analyzed by PCR or reverse
   line blot for the presence of pathogens' DNA. Pathogens analyzed were
   based on veterinarian reports and included Anaplasma phagocytophilum,
   Coxiella burnetii, Anaplasma marginale, Borrelia burgdorferi, Bartonella
   spp., Babesia spp., Theileria spp., and Francisella sp. Francisella
   tularensis was not detected in any of the analyzed ticks. In D.
   marginatus, infection prevalence for A. phagocytophilum (3\%) was
   similar to that found in I. ricinus in Europe. Other pathogens present
   in D. marginatus included A. marginale (0.5\%), Bartonella spp. (9\%),
   C. burnetii (12\%), F. philomiragia (1.3\%), and Theileria
   annulata/Babesia bovis (0.3\%), which were detected for the first time
   in France. Pathogens detected in D. reticulatus included A. marginale
   (1\%), Bartonella spp. (12\%), C. burnetii (16\%), Borrelia spp.
   (1.5\%), and F. philomiragia (19\%). Pathogens detected in I. ricinus
   included A. phagocytophilum (41\%), Bartonella spp. (9\%), C. burnetii
   (18\%), A. marginale (1\%), Borrelia spp. (4.5\%), and Babesia sp.
   (7\%). This study represents the first epidemiological approach to
   characterize tick-borne pathogens infecting Dermacentor spp. in France
   and that may be transmitted by ticks from this genus. Further
   experiments using experimental infections and transmission may be now
   conducted to analyze vector competency of Dermacentor spp. for these
   pathogens and to validate such hypothesis.},

Abstract = {Salmonella is an important zoonotic pathogen of economic importance. In
   Europe, salmonellosis is the second food-borne infection, in Italy,
   Salmonella is still the major cause of food-borne outbreaks. In Europe,
   there are many Salmonella surveillance plans on farmed animals, while
   Salmonella survey of wild animals is occasionally performed. The aim of
   this study was to investigate the presence of Salmonella including the
   antibiotic-resistant strains in wild animals. Between 2002 and 2010,
   2,713 wild animals (canids, mustelids, birds, rodents, ungulates), were
   collected in north-western Italy and tested for Salmonella by classical
   microbiological culture method followed by serological and biochemical
   typing. One hundred and seventeen wild animals (63 canids, 25 mustelids,
   24 birds, 5 ungulates) were found positive for Salmonella (4.3\%). One
   hundred and thirty strains, belonging to several serotypes were
   isolated, and S. Typhimurium was the most common serotype found.
   Antibiotic susceptibility was tested by disk-diffusion test on 88
   strains. Almost all the analyzed strains (97.7\%) showed
   resistance/intermediate resistance to at least one class of antibiotics
   and the highest resistance values were observed for the tetracycline
   class. In conclusion, zoonotic and antibiotic-resistant serotypes were
   found in many species of wildlife.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we report an investigation on cat-scratch disease (CSD)
   in Northern Italy. Seventy-four cases of CSD were diagnosed at the San
   Matteo hospital, Pavia, during the period 2005-2010. Of these 74
   patients, 18 (24.3 \%) reported atypical clinical manifestations such as
   ocular papillitis, maculopapular eruptions, vertebral infection,
   pulmonary infiltrates, and granulomatous hepatitis. Contact with cats
   was documented for 61 patients (82.4 \%), while cat-related trauma was
   reported for 49 patients (66.2 \%). We subsequently investigated the
   presence of Bartonella infection in cats belonging to the above patients
   and in other domestic and stray cats from three provinces of Northern
   Italy. Among the 27 domestic cats tested, nine of the 11 belonging to
   the CSD patients and two of the remaining 16 were infected by B.
   henselae (81.8 \% vs. 12.5 \%). Out of over 1,300 stray cats examined,
   23.1 \% were seropositive for B. henselae; after culturing and
   genotyping, 17 \% were found to be infected by B. henselae (15.5 \%) or
   B. clarridgeiae (1.5 \%).},

Title = {Preliminary study of the effects of preventive measures on the

Abstract = {Canine Leishmaniosis is endemic in Mediterranean areas, with a
   well-documented northward spread. The mass use of preventive measures
   against sandfly bites (collar and spot-on formulations) was tested in a
   small focus recently established in an isolated hilly area of
   north-eastern Italy (Colli Euganei). In 2006 and 2007, a total of 449
   dogs living in the southern part of Colli Euganei were screened against
   Leishmania infantum using an immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT),
   and 31 (6.9\%) were seropositive. A risk factor analysis clearly
   described the focus as limited to a small village named Calaone. In
   2010, 63 animals from Calaone were sampled and their owners interviewed
   to verify the effectiveness of the preventive measures. According to
   what reported by owners, dogs started to be protected in 2006 (66.7\%
   dogs protected), and protection rate incremented (around 90\%) during
   the subsequent years. The seroprevalence value (4.2\%) of the youngest
   age class (<5 years) was significantly lower than other classes,
   demonstrating that animals born after 2006 had low probabilities of
   getting infected. Besides, seroprevalence value referred only to dogs
   living in Calaone was 32.4\% (23/71) in 2006-2007 and 20.6\% (13/63) in
   2010, showing a decreasing trend. Although still preliminary, the
   results show high sensitization of dog owners and suggest that the mass
   use of collars and spot-on acts positively in reducing the circulation
   of L. infantum.},

Volume = {49},

Abstract = {In Italy, National Law (281/1991) prohibits euthanasia of shelter dogs
   if they are not dangerous or suffering seriously. Adoption rates in
   rescue shelters are often lower than entrance rates, leading inevitably
   to overcrowded facilities where animals are likely to spend the rest of
   their lives in kennels. In this situation, housing conditions (i.e.
   space provided, environmental, and social stimulation) may have an
   impact on canine welfare. In this research project, the effects of two
   different forms of housing (group-and pair housing) on long-term shelter
   dogs were compared using behavioural and physiological parameters.
   Observational data and saliva samples were collected from dogs exposed
   to both experimental settings; behaviour and cortisol concentration
   levels were used as welfare indicators. Pair housing offered fewer
   social and environmental stimuli and behavioural analysis showed a
   significant decrease in locomotor, exploratory, and social behaviour.
   Cortisol levels show that this parameter varied independently of housing
   conditions. Although this study found no evidence suggesting that one
   form of confinement reduced animal welfare more than the other (e.g. in
   terms of abnormal behaviour, or higher cortisol concentrations), the
   type of confinement did affect the expression of a variety of behaviours
   and these variations should not be ignored with respect to housing
   decisions for long-term shelter dogs.},

Abstract = {Background: Bovine tuberculosis is a significant disease in animals and
   monitoring is important in preventing spread and transmission to man.
   Objective: We identified risk factors for a positive tuberculin test
   (SCCIT) in cattle at Faisalabad and Okara, Pakistan.
   Methods: Fifty-nine herds (230 cattle) at Faisalabad and 38 (291 cattle)
   at Okara were included in the study. The risk factors studied included
   area, farm, nature of villages, location, total cattle, presence of
   other animals, other species (buffalo, small ruminants, equines or
   pets), age, sex, live weight, calving number, lactation length,
   lactation status, total milk produced, and per day milk.
   Results: Our results showed an association between age, live weight,
   calving number, lactation length, and total number of cattle at the farm
   with positive tuberculin test. The analysis of variance technique also
   showed association of all of these factors except lactation length with
   positive skin test. The results of logistic regression analysis also
   suggested an association of age, live weight, calving number, total
   animals at the farm, and total cattle at the farm with positive SCCIT
   test in cattle.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of tuberculosis in cattle is around 9\% at
   herd level and 2\% at animal level with stronger risk factors being live
   weight, total animals, and total cattle at the farm.},

Abstract = {From January 2007 to December 2011, a total of 106 Haemophilus parasuis
   strains isolated from pigs were serotyped by agar gel diffusion test
   (DG). Serovar 4 was the most prevalent (24.5\%), followed by serovar 13
   (19.8\%) and serovar 5 (11.3\%). Twenty-nine strains were non-typeable
   (27.3\%). The strains were divided into two groups, depending on whether
   they were isolated from specific pathological lesions of systemic
   disease such as polyserositis, arthritis or meningitis (73 cases of 106)
   or from the lower respiratory tract of pigs suffering from
   bronchopneumonia (33 cases of 106). Serovars 4 and 13 had a higher
   prevalence in systemic infection (polyserositis) than in respiratory
   disease only. Pasteurella multocida (14/106), Streptococcus suis
   (7/106), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (4/106), Bordetella
   bronchiseptica (3/106) and Arcanobacterium pyogenes (3/106) were
   isolated in association with H.parasuis.},

Title = {HER-2 expression in canine morphologically normal, hyperplastic and

Abstract = {The proto-oncogene HER-2/neu (c-erbB-2) encodes a transmembrane receptor
   protein with tyrosine-kinase activity. Previous studies have shown that
   HER-2 protein over-expression is present in canine mammary tumours,
   however, possible prognostic and predictive analogies between protein
   over-expression patterns in canine and human species are still
   controversial. Thirty-five canine mammary carcinomas, 11 mammary
   adenomas, and normal, hyperplastic or dysplastic tissues taken at the
   marginal area of the tumours were evaluated by immunohistochemistry
   (IHC) for HER-2 expression, using the Hercept Test (R) system scoring
   guidelines. HER-2 over-expression was detected in 3/11 adenomas and
   10/35 carcinomas. Normal, hyperplastic and dysplastic mammary tissues
   were also found to be positive. The correlations between HER-2
   expression and tumour histological grading, mitotic index, the presence
   of lymphatic invasion, and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. In
   carcinomas, HER-2 positive status only correlated with the mitotic
   index. A positive correlation was also found between HER-2 positive
   status and the presence of HER-2 over-expression in normal, hyperplastic
   or/and dysplastic mammary tissues surrounding the tumours. The
   percentage of HER-2 over-expressing tumours was similar to the
   percentage previously observed in canine benign and malignant mammary
   tumours. However an investigation regarding morphologically normal and
   hyperplastic or dysplastic tissues surrounding neoplastic lesions also
   showed HER-2 over-expression. In contrast with human mammary tumours,
   this study confirmed that in canine species, HER-2 over-expression does
   not identify a subgroup of tumours with a poor prognosis. In fact, we
   found HER-2 over-expression in morphologically non-neoplastic mammary
   tissues, surrounding hyperplastic and neoplastic lesions. (C) 2012

Abstract = {Toxicity of benzo{[}a]pyrene occurs because of the formation of covalent
   adducts with DNA guanines. In this work we report the attempt to detect
   this DNA-adduct using both an electrochemical assay based on gold
   nanoparticles and a surface plasmon resonance DNA sensor. Detection was
   achieved via inhibition of the hybridization reaction of oligonucleotide
   sequences after formation of the covalent adduct. Detecting
   oligonucleotide sequences have been designed to get high reactivity vs
   formation of the adduct and benzo{[}a]-pyrene 7,8-dihydrodiol
   9,10-epoxide has been used to generate adducts. Formation of adducts in
   the nanomolar range was evaluated using the surface plasmon resonance
   sensor with both the oligonucleotide sequences containing guanines. (C)

Abstract = {Dourine is trypanosomosis that affects equids, it's mainly sexually
   transmitted. The disease was first eradicated in Italy in the 19405, but
   there was then a serious epidemic in the mid-70s. After sporadic reports
   at the end of the 1990s, in May 2011 it was reported once more.
   Clinical diagnosis of dourine can be complex, as clinical signs and
   gross lesions are not always present. Direct laboratory diagnosis is
   also problematic, given the low number of parasites normally present in
   infected tissues and the mild, short-lasting parasitaemia. This article
   describes the epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data enabling
   confirmation of the suspicion of dourine in Italy in the 2011 epidemic.

Title = {Impact of genetic variation and geographic distribution of porcine
   reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus on infectivity and pig
   growth},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAR 27},
Abstract = {Background: The porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is
   a devastating disease for the pig industry. In this study, we analysed
   the genetic variability of PRRS virus (PRRSV) as well as the
   relationship between the genetic variability, the geographical and
   temporal distribution of the PRRSV strains. Moreover, we investigated
   the association between the glycosylation patterns in PRRSV sequences
   and pigs growth.
   Results: The data highlight that PRRSV strains evolve rapidly on
   individual farms, and temporal evolution of PRRSV is an important factor
   of genetic variability. Analysis of glycosylation sites in the
   glycoprotein 5 (GP5) ectodomain revealed that PRRSV isolates had seven
   combinations of putative N-linked glycosylation sites of which the
   N37/46/53 sites was found in 79\% of the sequences. No significant
   relationship was found between the genetic variation of the PRRSV
   strains and the geographic distance. A significant relationship was
   found between the genetic variation and time of sampling when farm was
   considered as a factor in the analysis. Furthermore, the commercial
   semen from artificial insemination centres was not a source of PRRS
   transmission. The PRRSV having the glycosylation site at position N46
   (N46+) were observed to have higher burden on pigs and accordingly the
   corresponding infected pigs had lower average daily gain (ADG) compared
   with those infected with PRRSV lacking the glycosylation at N46 (N46-)
   position site. This study showed that the number of piglets by litter
   infected by PRRSV was lower for the Landrace breed than for the other
   studied breeds (Large White, Duroc and Pietrain).
   Conclusions: The PRRSV genetic variability which is determined by a
   local and temporal evolution at the farm level could be considered in a
   perspective of prevention. Moreover, the association between the PRRSV
   glycosylation patterns and its virulence could be of interest for
   vaccine development. The differences of resistance to PRRSV infections
   among pig breeds might open new horizons for the genetic selection of
   robustness against PRRSV infection.},

Title = {Thromboelastometry in veal calves to detect hemostatic variations caused
   by low doses of dexamethasone treatment},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAR 26},
Abstract = {Background: The illegal administration of hormones, steroids,
   beta-agonists and other anabolic agents to productive livestock in the
   European Union continues, despite the long-term ban on their use and
   despite the measures provided under the directives to monitor certain
   substances and residues thereof in the interest of protecting consumer
   health and animal wellbeing. Often administered in low doses in the form
   of a drug cocktail, these compounds escape detection by common
   analytical techniques. The aim of this study was to determine whether
   low-dose dexamethasone administration (0.4 mg orally per day, for 20
   days) in white-meat calves produced variations in blood coagulation, as
   measured by thromboelastometry. A second aim was to determine whether
   such variations could be valid in detecting illicit low-dose
   dexamethasone treatment.
   Results: The study population was 42 Friesian calves kept under
   controlled conditions until 6 months of age. The calves were subdivided
   into 2 groups: a control group (group A, n = 28) and a group treated
   with dexamethasone (group B, n = 14) for 20 days beginning at 5 months
   of age. When compared against the age-matched control group, the
   dexamethasone-treated calves showed a significant increase in alpha
   angle, maximum clot firmness and a significant decrease in clot
   formation time on all thromboelastometric profiles (P < 0.05). The
   clotting time was significantly decreased on the in-TEM (R) profile but
   increased on the ex-TEM (R) and fib-TEM (R) profiles (P < 0.05). The
   Receiver Operating Characteristic curves, plotted for the Maximum Clot
   Elasticity (MCE), had a cut-off value >= 488.23 mm for in-TEM (R) MCE
   {[}Se 85.7\%, (95\% CI 57.2-98.2); Sp 100\% 96.43\% (95\% CI 81.7-99.9]
   and a cut-off value >= 63.94 mm for fib-TEM (R) MCE {[}Se 92.8 (95\% CI
   66.1-99.8); Sp 89.3\% (95\% CI 71.8-97.7)]. In order to increase the
   sensitivity of the test two parameters (in-TEM (R) and fib-TEM (R) MCE)
   were used as two parallel tests; subsequently, the sensitivity rose to a
   point value of 99\% (95\% CI 85.4-99.9).
   Conclusions: Thromboelastometry identified a state of hypercoagulability
   in the dexamethasone-treated subjects. Furthemore, the results of this
   preliminary study suggest that TEM may be useful in the detection of
   illicit low-dose dexamethasone treatment.},

Abstract = {Crayfish plague, caused by the oomycete Aphanomyces astaci, is a serious
   disease of European freshwater crayfish and has eliminated entire
   populations in several European countries. In September 2011, mortality
   was observed among the Austropotamobius pallipes population of a river
   basin in the Abruzzi region (central Italy), and A. astaci DNA was
   detected by PCR in dead crayfish. A systematic survey was carried out to
   evaluate the spread and the effects of the plague in the river basin.
   The source of the outbreak remained unknown since North American
   crayfish species, which frequently act as subclinical carriers of the
   infection, were not detected in the area. The A. pallipes population
   disappeared from a river stretch of similar to 1 km, where A. astaci
   infection was detected in dead crayfish. However, apparently unaffected
   crayfish were still present upstream of that area as well as in a
   tributary that joined the brook in the apparently depopulated stretch.
   A. astaci infection was not detected in dead individuals collected in
   the upstream area and tributary. A follow-up visit conducted in the
   following season showed the presence of A. pallipes in the river stretch
   hit by the plague. In this outbreak, the spread of the infection could
   have been limited by a low density of the crayfish population and by the
   geographic conformation of the river basin, which includes a dense
   network of small tributaries, characterized by high flow velocity and
   low water temperature. In this particular setting, crayfish plague
   outbreaks can remain undetected. This underlines the importance of
   active monitoring programs aimed at the prompt recognition of both
   episodes of mortality and the presence of non-indigenous crayfish
   species.},

Abstract = {Avian-like H1N1 and reassortant H3N2 and H1N2 influenza A viruses with a
   human-like haemagglutinin have been co-circulating in swine in Europe
   for more than a decade. We aimed to examine the infection dynamics of
   the three swine influenza virus (SIV) lineages at the farm level, and to
   identify possible regional and seasonal variations in their circulation.
   Sera were collected from six successive generations of fattening pigs
   (200-2008) in a total 80 farrow-to-finish herds in Belgium, Italy,
   France and Spain and examined for antibodies against the three SIVs in
   haemagglutination inhibition tests. Overall, in all regions and periods,
   9.7\% of all farms were negative for Sly, 49\% were infected with one
   subtype, 38\% with two subtypes and 3.9\% with all three SIVs. We found
   serological evidence for the circulation of all three subtypes in
   Belgium, Italy and Spain, while only infections with H1N1 and H1N2 SIVs
   were detected in France. Despite temporary changes in the circulation of
   H1N2 in Belgium and in Spain, there was no true seasonal variation. The
   exact combination of subtypes on the same farm differed in each of the
   sampling periods. On the other hand, 21 farms were found to be
   consistently infected with the same SIV subtype throughout the study.
   This can either be explained by the persistence of the virus in a farm,
   or by the periodical re-introduction of SIVs of the same subtype. (C)

Abstract = {The most important animal disease caused by yeast-like algae belonging
   to the genus Prototheca is bovine mastitis. Although the infection can
   be caused by both Prototheca zopfii genotype 2 and Prototheca
   blaschkeae, the bulk of prevalence of bovine protothecal mastitis has
   been so far attributed to the former, being P. blaschkeae only
   sporadically isolated. However, we report here the first outbreak of
   bovine mastitis caused by P. blaschkeae in an Italian dairy herd. One
   hundred and four individual milk samples, three bulk tank milk and 16
   environmental samples within the herd were screened for the presence of
   Prototheca: five, one and four positive samples, were respectively
   observed. Molecular analysis revealed that, with the sole exception of
   one environmental isolate belonging to P. zopfii genotype 2, all
   Prototheca strains were identified as P. blaschkeae.
   Our results might suggest that even P. blaschkeae can induce mastitis
   outbreaks, while it is not clear if the higher incidence of P. zopfii
   genotype 2 as causative agent of protothecal mastitis could reflect an
   intrinsic higher pathogenicity or it could be simply the consequence of
   its, so far observed, higher diffusion in worldwide dairy herd
   ecosystems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {After an urgent inquiry into a suspected international outbreak of
   Salmonella Goldcoast infection was launched by Hungary in October 2009 a
   nationwide multidisciplinary investigation was carried out in Italy. The
   aims were to verify whether the higher than expected number of cases of
   S. Goldcoast infection that had occurred in Italy in the previous months
   were linked to the outbreak in Hungary and to determine their origin.
   Between June 2009 and March 2010, 79 confirmed cases of S. Goldcoast
   infection were identified. Of these, 17 were part of three different
   point-source outbreaks probably associated with the consumption of
   salami. Eating salami was also reported by 20 of the 39 sporadic cases
   that could be interviewed. Fifteen strains of S. Goldcoast isolated from
   the cases were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. They shared
   more than 90\% homology with the Hungarian epidemic strain and were also
   highly similar to S. Goldcoast strains that had been isolated in Italy
   from pigs and pork-containing food items in 2009 and 2010. Although the
   origin of the outbreak and the common source linking the Hungarian and
   the Italian cases could not be definitively identified, our results
   suggest a possible zoonotic connection of the outbreak cases with the
   pork production chain.},

   The assay has been used to assess the dissemination of these strains in

   results suggest a limited dissemination compared to the usually higher
   prevalence of Chlamydia psittaci that is the main species associated

Title = {Risk of canine and human exposure to Dirofilaria immitis infected
   mosquitoes in endemic areas of Italy},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {6},
Month = {MAR 7},
Abstract = {Background: The occurrence of infections by Dirofilaria immitis in
   canine and human populations depends on several factors linked to both
   the definitive and intermediate hosts. Little data are available on the
   risk of human and dog exposure to D. immitis in endemic areas. Data
   collected on dog- and human-bait traps in endemic areas of north-eastern
   Italy were used to estimate the likelihood of a receptive host coming
   into contact with an infected vector.
   Methods: From 1997 to 1999, mosquitoes were collected from three
   sampling sites of north-eastern Italy on D. immitis microfilaraemic dogs
   and on human baits. The bite/night/host rates were determined based on
   the number of feeding and probing mosquitoes on dogs and humans,
   respectively. The survival/mortality rates of different species of
   mosquitoes following the blood meal, and the rate of natural Dirofilaria
   infection in unfed specimens were estimated. The risk of exposure of
   dogs and humans to infected mosquito species was determined by combining
   the bite/host/night and the mosquito infection rates.
   Results: A total of 1,165 mosquitoes were collected on human (n = 815)
   and dog (n = 350) baits with varying species composition (i.e., Culex
   pipiens, 87.3\% and Ochlerotatus caspius, 11.6\%). Overall, dogs were
   more attractive to Cx pipiens than humans (feeding rate 70.2\% vs
   probing rate 25.9\%). The highest bite/night/host rate was 84.0 for dogs
   and 26.5 for humans. Cx pipiens displayed a mortality rate of 76.3\%
   within 13 days and Oc. caspius of 100\% within two days following the
   infective blood meal. In addition, D. immitis DNA was detected in unfed
   Cx pipiens (infection rate of 0.26\%-2.07\%). The infection rate
   adjusted for mosquito mortality was 0.38\%. Based on data collected, the
   contact between an infected mosquito and a host can occur as often as
   every four nights for D. immitis infected-mosquitoes in dogs and within
   two weeks for humans.
   Conclusions: Cx pipiens was confirmed as the most efficient natural
   vector of D. immitis in the studied area. In endemic areas, the risk of
   transmission can be very high for dogs and relevant for humans. Despite
   the increased awareness of veterinarians and owners on canine
   dirofilarioses, dogs from rural areas still maintain the natural life
   cycle of Dirofilaria spp., therefore acting as a source of infection to
   humans through vector bites.},

Abstract = {Recent evidences have demonstrated that the presence of low pathogenic
   avian influenza viruses (LPAIV) may play an important role in host
   ecology and transmission of avian influenza viruses (AIV). While some
   authors have clearly demonstrated that LPAIV can mutate to render highly
   pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV), others have shown that their
   presence could provide the host with enough immunological memory to
   resist re-infections with HPAIV. In order to experimentally study the
   role of pre-existing host immunity, chickens previously infected with
   H7N2 LPAIV were subsequently challenged with H7N1 HPAIV. Pre-infection
   of chickens with H7N2 LAPIV conferred protection against the lethal
   challenge with H7N1 HPAIV, dramatically reducing the viral shedding, the
   clinical signs and the pathological outcome. Correlating with the
   protection afforded, sera from chickens primed with H7N2 LPAIV reacted
   with the H7-AIV subtype in hemagglutination inhibition assay and
   specifically with the N2-neuraminidase antigen. Conversely, subsequent
   exposure to H5N1 HPAIV resulted in a two days-delay on the onset of
   disease but all chickens died by 7 days post-challenge. Lack of
   protection correlated with the absence of H5-hemagglutining inhibitory
   antibodies prior to H5N1 HPAIV challenge. Our data suggest that in
   naturally occurring outbreaks of HPAIV, birds with pre-existing immunity
   to LPAIV could survive lethal infections with HA-homologous HPAIV but
   not subsequent re-infections with HA-heterologous HPAIV. These results
   could be useful to better understand the dynamics of AIV in chickens and
   might help in future vaccine formulations.},

Abstract = {Dexamethasone is a potent synthetic corticosteroid synthesised as an
   anti-inflammatory agent, but also illegally used at low dosages as a
   growth promoter either alone or in combination with other steroids or
   -agonists. The use of screening methods based on the detection of
   biological effects of growth promoters is a promising approach to assist
   residue monitoring. The advantage of such an approach is that it offers
   the possibility to discover illicit treatments even when the drug
   residues are not easily detectable by common analytical methods. The aim
   of this study was to determine the urinary elimination and tissue
   distribution of dexamethasone and to investigate whether endogenous
   corticosteroid profiling of urine could be used to establish a
   predictive tool for identifying any misuse of growth promoters in bulls.
   Urinary corticosteroid concentrations were assayed in bulls (n=8)
   treated with dexamethasone (0.75mg/animal/day), bulls (n=8) treated with
   a combination of dexamethasone (0.66mg/animal/day) and clenbuterol (from
   2 to 6mg/animal/day) and untreated bulls (n=8). The distribution and
   elimination of dexamethasone and the urinary concentration of cortisone,
   cortisol and 6-hydroxycortisol were determined by using LC-MS/MS at
   different time points both during treatments and after appropriate
   withdrawal times. The urinary concentration of endogenous
   corticosteroids in bulls decreased significantly (p<0.001) upon the
   administration of dexamethasone alone, whereas it remained unchanged
   until the last sampling point in animals treated with dexamethasone and
   clenbuterol (p<0.001). Nonetheless, dexamethasone administration
   significantly reduced (p<0.01) the urinary 6-hydroxycortisol/cortisol
   ratio in both treatment groups. Therefore, this ratio could be regarded
   as a candidate for an indirect screening assay for detecting
   glucocorticoid abuse in bull fattening to pick out farms where similar
   treatments are potentially in use and to suggest targeted sampling on
   remaining animals.},

Abstract = {Mercury (Hg) settlements in the Mediterranean Sea determine a potential
   toxicological relevance of seafood intakes for coastal populations. To
   assess this possibility, fish, molluscs, and crustaceans of commercial
   size of 69 different species were sampled and analyzed for total mercury
   (Hg-TOT) from georeferenced areas and evaluated for their compliance
   with the European Union Maximum Residue Limits of 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg wet
   weight (ww). Accounting for the weekly estimated seafood intake in the
   Italian coastal population (mean 469-626 g/person/week) it was then
   possible to recover threshold contamination values in seafood. Under a
   Tolerable Weekly Intake of 1.3 mu g/kg/bw/week, a threshold seafood
   contamination <0.10 mg/kg ww has been derived for sensitive groups. A
   suitable algorithm based on the parallel MeHg and Hg-TOT analysis on the
   most consumed species, helped to refine the uncertainties related to the
   conservative assumption in seafood all the Hg-TOT present is in form of
   MeHg. This work aims to improve the link between the risk management and
   risk assessment strategies, with the identification of those fish and
   seafood species, that, when regularly consumed, could determine or
   prevent potential Hg-TOT/MeHg overintakes in sensitive groups. (C) 2013

Abstract = {Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) is the only member of serotype 1 avian
   paramyxoviruses (APMV-1) that causes respiratory and neurological
   disease in chickens and other species of birds and can cause severe
   economic losses in the poultry sector. Due to the relevant variability
   of the genome and the pathogenicity of NDV isolates, their detection in
   a specimen is not sufficient to provide and confirm an exact diagnosis,
   and so the assessment of virus pathotype is required.
   To diagnose rapidly and pathotype NDV directly in clinical specimens, a
   method based on RT-PCR and pyrosequencing analysis has been developed
   and is reported in the present study. A pair of degenerated primers was
   designed to amplify a portion of the fusion (F) gene responsible for
   virulence and used to test 315 specimens collected from 2006 to 2011.
   The subsequent pyrosequencing reaction identified a 30-bp region
   encompassing the cleavage site. A total of 213 out of 315 samples were
   pyrosequenced and results were compared and confirmed by the Sanger
   sequencing procedure, which is traditionally performed for NDV
   pathotyping.
   The pyrosequencing reaction provided high quality results in real time
   and proved to be more rapid and cost-efficient than the classical
   sequencing procedure, indicating it as a possible valid alternative to
   the currently used diagnostic assays for NDV. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {We compiled information on the distribution of ticks in the western
   Palearctic (11A degrees W, 45A degrees E; 29A degrees N, 71A degrees N),
   published during 1970-2010. The literature search was filtered by the
   tick's species name and an unambiguous reference to the point of
   capture. Records from some curated collections were included. We focused
   on tick species of importance to human and animal health, in particular:
   Ixodes ricinus, Dermacentor marginatus, D. reticulatus, Haemaphysalis
   punctata, H. sulcata, Hyalomma marginatum, Hy. lusitanicum,
   Rhipicephalus annulatus, R. bursa, and the R. sanguineus group. A few
   records of other species (I. canisuga, I. hexagonus, Hy. impeltatum, Hy.
   anatolicum, Hy. excavatum, Hy. scupense) were also included. A total of
   10,280 records was included in the data set. Almost 42 \% of published
   references are not adequately referenced (and not included in the data
   set), host is reported for only 61 \% of records and a reference to time
   of collection is missed for 84 \% of published records. Ixodes ricinus
   accounted for 44.3 \% of total records, with H. marginatum and D.
   marginatus accounting for 7.1 and 8.1 \% of records, respectively. The
   lack of homogeneity of the references and potential pitfalls in the
   compilation were addressed to create a digital data set of the records
   of the ticks. We attached to every record a coherent set of quantitative
   descriptors for the site of reporting, namely gridded interpolated
   monthly climate and remotely sensed data on vegetation (NDVI). We also
   attached categorical descriptors of the habitat: a standard
   classification of land biomes and an ad hoc classification of the target
   territory from remotely sensed temperature and NDVI data. A descriptive
   analysis of the data revealed that a principal components reduction of
   the environmental (temperature and NDVI) variables described the
   distribution of the species in the target territory. However,
   categorical descriptors of the habitat were less effective. We stressed
   the importance of building reliable collections of ticks with specific
   references as to collection point, host and date of capture. The data
   set is freely downloadable.},

Abstract = {Knowledge of the antigenic structure of foot-and-mouth disease virus
   (FMDV) has relevance in the development of diagnostic assays, in the
   evaluation of the antigenic variability and in the selection of
   appropriate vaccine strains. Antigenic sites have been investigated only
   in FMDVs of serotypes O, A and C, while it would be valuable to extend
   studies also to other serotypes. This paper reports the identification
   of antigenic sites involved in virus neutralization in the FMDV serotype
   Asia 1 by using a new panel of mAbs and their relation with sites
   described in other serotypes is discussed. Out of 24 mAbs raised against
   the FMDV serotype Asia 1, 10 neutralize viral infectivity and were used
   to select FMDV mutants resistant to neutralization. On the basis of
   their reactivity profile with virus mutants, the 10 neutralizing mAbs
   were clustered in four groups corresponding to four independent
   antigenic sites. By comparing the amino acid sequence of the parental
   virus and of virus mutants, the amino acids crucial for the four sites
   were mapped at the following positions: VP1 140-142, VP2 67-79, VP3
   58/59 and VP3 218. Three of the four neutralizing sites identified and
   mapped on FMDV serotype Asia 1 correspond structurally and functionally
   to analogous sites described in FMDV serotypes 0, A and C, enforcing the
   evidence that these are dominant antigenic sites in the FMDV structure.
   The fourth site, located at the C terminus of VP3, is a new independent
   site, described for the first time in FMDV.},

Abstract = {Evidence of diseases on vertebrate fossil bones can provide detailed
   information on many aspects of extinct animals. This study focused on
   pathological craniodental remains (left maxilla and dentary) referred to
   the canid Cuon alpinus unearthed from a Late Pleistocene karst filling
   deposit at San Sidero (Apulia, southern Italy). These fossils show clear
   evidence of a chronic periodontitis that caused the animal's death.
   Clinical diagnosis of the disease and the timing of its development have
   been defined on the basis of a veterinary odontostomatology approach, in
   addition to radiographic and tomographic techniques. From the initiation
   of the infection until death, a time span of at least 6 months occurred,
   and three main steps have been defined: (1) the bacterial infections of
   the buccal cavity turning into severe periodontitis, (2) the fracture of
   the lower carnassial and (3) the loss of teeth due to the worsening
   infection that deformed and/or eroded maxillary and mandibular bones and
   enlarged alveoli. The analysis of the palaeopathology also provides
   information about the biomechanics of the bite, on the feeding behaviour
   and on the relationships of injured members in a pack of Late
   Pleistocene canids.},

Abstract = {Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is a disease of economic
   importance that is widely distributed in sub-Saharan African and
   contributes significantly to cattle morbidity and mortality. Lack of
   resources to implement eradication measures has led to the disease
   becoming endemic in most areas in sub-Saharan Africa where governments
   have little resources and the majority of the people are poor. Usually,
   control and eradication of such diseases as CBPP is treated as a public
   good by governments and to achieve this, governments are usually
   assisted by nongovernment organisations, bilateral government programmes
   and international donors. The private sector, which usually is companies
   that run businesses to make profit, although not very well established
   in sub-Saharan Africa could play a big role in the eradication of CBPP
   in the region. This could play a dual role of promoting investment and
   also eradicate livestock diseases which have proved a menace in the
   livestock sector. This paper highlights the role played by the private
   sector in the control of CBPP in Zambia.},

Abstract = {Between June and September 2010, widespread Italian consumer reports of
   unusual blue spoilage on fresh dairy products were publicized, resulting
   in the so-called blue mozzarella event. An inordinately high number of
   samples from mozzarella and whey cheese products of Italian and German
   production subsequently tested positive for Pseudomonas fluorescens. The
   aim of this study was to verify whether a selected P. fluorescens strain
   was responsible for this apparently unusual event. Molecular
   characterization of 181 isolated P. fluorescens strains was conducted
   using a newly optimized pulsed-field gel electrophoresis protocol.
   Although a high number of pulsotypes was found (132), only four
   pulsotypes were associated with more than one production plant, and only
   one German isolate had the same pulsotype as was detected in two Italian
   plants. This is the only evidence of possible cross-contamination among
   cheeses from the two countries. The overall results did not support the
   spread of contamination from German to Italian plants or the presence of
   one environmental strain that spread in both countries.},

Abstract = {The main goal in cancer chemotherapy is to drive the drug into the tumor
   microenvironment to kill as many cancer cells as possible while
   producing the lowest collateral toxicity. Previously, we have shown that
   human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hBM-MSCs) exposed
   to Paclitaxel (PTX) were able to uptake and subsequently release the
   drug in the culture medium. PTX primed hBM-MSCs (hBM-MSCsPTX) located in
   the vicinity of cancer cells produced a strong inhibition of tumor cell
   growth both in vitro and in vivo. To expand these observations, in the
   present study we exposed human skin derived fibroblasts (hSDFs) to 2,000
   ng/ml of PTX and then tested both cells and their conditioned medium
   (CM) in vitro for their capacity to inhibit the proliferation of human
   tumor cell lines (MOLT-4, DU-145, U87-MG, SH-SY5Y(+) and LAN-5). We
   found that hSDFs primed with PTX (hSDFsPTX) were able to uptake and
   subsequently release PTX in a time dependent manner. hSDFsPTX-derived
   CM(hSDFsPTX-CM) from 1: 4 to 1: 10 dilutions produced a significant
   (p<0.05) in vitro tumor growth inhibition. hSDFsPTX co-cultured with
   leukemia cells at 1: 1 to 1: 10 ratio, completely inhibited cells growth
   whereas no inhibition was induced by normal hSDFs cells. Our results
   demonstrate for the first time that hSDFs can be loaded in vitro with
   PTX and thus can acquire a potent anti-tumor activity. Since hSDFs can
   be easily isolated from skin biopsies without any particular pain and
   discomfort to donor patients, we conclude that hSDFs may represent a
   valid cell type option for carrying and delivering anti-cancer drugs.},

Abstract = {Current leukaemia therapy focuses on increasing chemotherapy efficacy.
   Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been proposed for carrying and
   delivery drugs to improve killing of cancer cells. We have shown that
   MSCs loaded with Paclitaxel (PTX) acquire a potent anti-tumour activity.
   We investigated the effect of human MSCs (hMSCs) and mouse SR4987 loaded
   with PTX (hMSCsPTX and SR4987PTX) on MOLT-4 and L1210, two leukaemia
   cell (LCs) lines of human and mouse origin, respectively. SR4987PTX and
   hMSCsPTX showed strong anti-LC activity. hMSCsPTX, co-injected with
   MOLT-4 cells or intra-tumour injected into established subcutaneous
   MOLT-4 nodules, strongly inhibited growth and angiogenesis. In
   BDF1-mice-bearing L1210, the intraperitoneal administration of SR4987PTX
   doubled mouse survival time. In vitro, both hMSCs and hMSCsPTX released
   chemotactic factors, bound and formed rosettes with LCs. In
   ultrastructural analysis of rosettes, hMSCsPTX showed no morphological
   alterations while the attached LCs were apoptotic and necrotic. hMSCs
   and hMSCsPTX released molecules that reduced LC adhesion to
   microvascular endothelium (hMECs) and down-modulated ICAM1 and VCAM1 on
   hMECs. Priming hMSCs with PTX is a simple procedure that does not
   require any genetic cell manipulation. Once the effectiveness of
   hMSCsPTX on established cancers in mice is proven, this procedure could
   be proposed for leukaemia therapy in humans.},

   in an intensive sheep farm in north Sardinia (Italy). E. faecalis, which
   is only rarely isolated from sheep milk, was unexpectedly found in
   22.3\% of positive samples at microbiological examination. Forty-five
   out of the 48 E. faecalis isolates showed the same multi-drug resistance
   pattern (cloxacillin, streptomycin, kanamycin, clindamycin,
   oxytetracycline). E. faecalis isolates were analysed by pulsed-field gel
   electrophoresis, and all 45 multi-drug resistant strains showed an
   indistinguishable macrorestiction profile, indicating their clonal
   origin. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an outbreak of

Abstract = {Avian adenovirus infections cause important disease complexes in
   chickens, but many of the viruses also infect chickens without resulting
   in overt disease. Previously several outbreaks of gizzard erosions
   caused by a fowl adenovirus A serotype-1 (FAdV-1) were reported from
   Japan. Here we report an outbreak of gizzard erosions in 12 broiler
   flocks in Germany in 2011. Chickens had a reduced daily weight gain and
   a higher total mortality rate of up to 8\%. The birds showed a severe
   detachment of the koilin layer and ulcerative to necrotizing lesions of
   the underlying mucosa. Histopathologically, necrotizing ventriculitis
   with basophilic, intranuclear inclusion bodies in epithelial cells was
   diagnosed. Immunohistochemistry, egg culture, and electron microscopic
   examination revealed adenovirus-like particles in the samples. No
   concurrent infectious agent could be identified. The virus was genotyped
   as FAdV-1 by PCR and subsequent sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of the
   hexon loop L1 gene yielded 100\% sequence identity to the chicken embryo
   lethal orphan strain. These findings suggest that outbreaks of
   adenoviral gizzard erosion can lead to significant economic losses in
   Germany and may be caused by an unusual virulent FAdV-1 strain.},

Title = {Evidence of Cross-Reactive Immunity to 2009 Pandemic Influenza A Virus
   in Workers Seropositive to Swine H1N1 Influenza Viruses Circulating in
   Italy},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Background: Pigs play a key epidemiologic role in the ecology of
   influenza A viruses (IAVs) emerging from animal hosts and transmitted to
   humans. Between 2008 and 2010, we investigated the health risk of
   occupational exposure to swine influenza viruses (SIVs) in Italy, during
   the emergence and spread of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (H1N1pdm) virus.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Serum samples from 123 swine workers
   (SWs) and 379 control subjects (Cs), not exposed to pig herds, were
   tested by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay against selected SIVs
   belonging to H1N1 (swH1N1), H1N2 (swH1N2) and H3N2 (swH3N2) subtypes
   circulating in the study area. Potential cross-reactivity between swine
   and human IAVs was evaluated by testing sera against recent, pandemic
   and seasonal, human influenza viruses (H1N1 and H3N2 antigenic
   subtypes). Samples tested against swH1N1 and H1N1pdm viruses were
   categorized into sera collected before (n. 84 SWs; n. 234 Cs) and after
   (n. 39 SWs; n. 145 Cs) the pandemic peak. HI-antibody titers >= 10 were
   considered positive. In both pre-pandemic and post-pandemic peak
   subperiods, SWs showed significantly higher swH1N1 seroprevalences when
   compared with Cs (52.4\% vs. 4.7\% and 59\% vs. 9.7\%, respectively).
   Comparable HI results were obtained against H1N1pdm antigen (58.3\% vs.
   7.7\% and 59\% vs. 31.7\%, respectively). No differences were found
   between HI seroreactivity detected in SWs and Cs against swH1N2 (33.3\%
   vs. 40.4\%) and swH3N2 (51.2 vs. 55.4\%) viruses. These findings
   indicate the occurrence of swH1N1 transmission from pigs to Italian SWs.
   Conclusion/Significance: A significant increase of H1N1pdm
   seroprevalences occurred in the post-pandemic peak subperiod in the Cs
   (p<0.001) whereas SWs showed no differences between the two subperiods,
   suggesting a possible occurrence of cross-protective immunity related to
   previous swH1N1 infections. These data underline the importance of risk
   assessment and occupational health surveillance activities aimed at
   early detection and control of SIVs with pandemic potential in humans.},

Title = {Seroepidemiology of Toxoplasma gondii infection in women of
   child-bearing age in central Ethiopia},
Journal = {BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {13},
Month = {FEB 26},
Abstract = {Background: Toxoplasma gondii infections during pregnancy can result in
   abortion or congenital defects. Prevalence and risk factors of
   toxoplasmosis in women of child-bearing age in Ethiopia are unknown. The
   current study was conducted with the objectives of estimating the
   seroprevalence and potential risk factors in acquiring T. gondii
   infection by women of child-bearing age in Central Ethiopia.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2011 to
   September 2011. Sera of 425 women were analyzed by indirect enzyme
   linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A questionnaire survey was
   administered for all study participants to gather information on risk
   factors.
   Results: The study revealed that anti-T. gondii IgG antibodies were
   detected in 81.4\% of the samples of which 78.4\% were positive for only
   IgG and 3.06\% positive for both IgG and IgM antibodies. Seroprevalence
   of IgM antibodies to T. gondii (4.0\%, 95\% CI: 2.14, 5.86) was
   suggestive of recent infections. Of the 213 pregnant women 9 (4.2 \%)
   were IgM reactive. Out of 17 potential risk factors investigated,
   univariate logistic regression showed significant association of T.
   gondii infection with study area, age, pregnancy status, raw vegetable
   consumption, source of water, presence of cats at home, contact with
   cats, HIV status and precaution during cats' feces cleaning (P = 0.05).
   The final logistic regression model revealed that: the probability of
   acquiring T. gondii infection by women of Debre-Zeit was 4.46 times
   (95\% CI of adjusted odds ratio {[}aOR]: 1.67, 11.89; P = 0.003) higher
   compared to women of Ambo, pregnant women were twice (95\% CI aOR: 1.13,
   3.59; P = 0.018) more likely to be seropositive than non-pregnant women
   and women who consume raw vegetable were at increased risk of infection
   (aOR = 2.21, 95\% CI: 1.03, 4.78; P = 0.043) than women who didn't
   consume.
   Conclusion: The seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in women of
   child-bearing age in Central Ethiopia is high. Study area, pregnancy and
   raw vegetable consumption are risk factors to acquire T. gondii
   infection. Educational program, antenatal screening of pregnant women
   and further epidemiological studies to uncover the economic and health
   impact of toxoplasmosis are suggested.},

Abstract = {Background: Dogs are the main reservoir hosts of Leishmania infantum,
   the agent of human zoonotic visceral leishmaniosis. This study
   investigated the efficacy of a polymer matrix collar containing a
   combination of 10\% imidacloprid and 4.5\% flumethrin as a novel
   prophylactic measure to prevent L. infantum infections in young dogs
   from a hyper-endemic area of southern Italy, with a view towards
   enhancing current control strategies against both human and canine
   leishmaniosis.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: The study was carried out on 124 young
   dogs, of which 63 were collared (Group A) while 61 were left untreated
   (Group B), from March-April 2011 until March 2012. Blood and skin
   samples were collected at baseline (April 2011) and at the first,
   second, third and fourth follow-up time points (July, September 2011 and
   November 2011, and March 2012, respectively). Bone marrow and
   conjunctiva were sampled at baseline and at the fourth follow-up.
   Serological, cytological and molecular tests were performed to detect
   the presence of L. infantum in the different tissues collected. At the
   end of the trial, no dog from Group A proved positive for L. infantum at
   any follow-up, whereas 22 dogs from Group B were infected (incidence
   density rate = 45.1\%); therefore, the combination of 10\% imidacloprid
   and 4.5\% flumethrin was 100\% efficacious for the prevention of L.
   infantum infection in young dogs prior to their first exposure to the
   parasite in a hyper-endemic area for CanL.
   Conclusions: The use of collars containing 10\% imidacloprid and 4.5\%
   flumethrin conferred long-term protection against infection by L.
   infantum to dogs located in a hyper-endemic area, thus representing a
   reliable and sustainable strategy to decrease the frequency and spread
   of this disease among the canine population which will ultimately result
   in the reduction of associated risks to human health.},

Abstract = {Serological diagnosis of equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV)
   infections has depended mainly on the agar gel immunodiffusion test
   (AGIDT). This study documents the presence of EIAV genetic sequences in
   a number of persistently infected horses and mules whose serums were
   interpreted as negative/equivocal on AGIDT, but positive on more than
   one ELISA test and in immunoblot tests. Strategies designed to take
   advantage of the combined strengths of the ELISA and AGIDT are shown
   effective in a national surveillance program for EIA in Italy where 17
   per cent (25/149) of the equids considered to be infected with EIAV on
   combined/comparative serological data had reactions in the AGIDT that
   were interpreted as negative or equivocal. These data document the
   benefits of using a three-tiered laboratory system for the diagnosis of
   EIA. Although the ELISA-first strategy introduces some confusing
   results, the discovery of up to 20 per cent more cases of EIA makes it
   compelling. In our opinion, it is better and more defensible to find two
   samples in 1000 with resolvable but falsely positive ELISA tests for EIA
   than to release two to three horses in 10,000 with falsely negative test
   results for EIA (the rates seen in the Italian surveillance presented
   here).},

Title = {Comparative evaluation of novel African swine fever virus (ASF) antibody

Abstract = {The presence of antibodies against African swine fever (ASF), a complex
   fatal notifiable OIE disease of swine, is always indicative of previous
   infection, since there is no vaccine that is currently used in the
   field. The early appearance and subsequent long-term persistence of
   antibodies combined with cost-effectiveness make antibody detection
   techniques essential in control programmes. Recent reports appear to
   indicate that the serological tests recommended by the OIE for ASF
   monitoring are much less effective in East and Southern Africa where
   viral genetic and antigenic diversity is the greatest. We report herein
   an extensive analysis including more than 1000 field and experimental
   infection sera, in which the OIE recommended tests are compared with
   antigen-specific ELISAs and immuno-peroxidase staining of cells (IPT).
   The antibody detection results generated using new antigen-specific
   tests, developed in this study, which are based on production of antigen
   fractions generated by infection and virus purification from COS-1
   cells, showed strong concordance with the OIE tests. We therefore
   conclude that the lack of success is not attributable to antigenic
   polymorphism and may be related to the specific characteristics of the
   local breeds African pigs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In order to investigate the prevalence of urinary tract infections (UTI)
   in sow, lower urinary tract (LUT), kidney and urine samples were
   collected at slaughterhouse from 65 multiparous culled sows.
   Histopathology was performed on urethra, urinary bladder and kidney
   sections. Urine collected by cystocentesis was analysed for physical and
   biochemical parameters, in addition to microscopic examination of the
   sediment and quantitative culture (> 10(5) CFU/ml urine). The diagnostic
   accuracy of urinalysis and urine culture was calculated for the
   parameters that correlated with histological diagnosis: bilateral
   chronic lesions were found in 54 per cent of kidney samples and
   diffuse/multifocal lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the submucosa in 53
   per cent of the bladder and 68 per cent of the urethra samples. In 49
   per cent of cases, the co-occurrence of bladder and urethra lesions was
   statistically significant (P<0.009). Turbid urine (80 per cent
   sensitivity, 50 per cent specificity), > 5 white blood cells per
   high-power field (34 per cent sensitivity, 90 per cent specificity),
   intracellular or free bacteria (43 per cent sensitivity, 90 per cent
   specificity), and urine culture (49 per cent sensitivity, 97 per cent
   specificity) correlated with a finding of histopathological changes in
   the bladder. UTI appears to be common in culled sows in northern Italy.
   Compared with histopathology, urinalysis and urine culture showed low
   sensitivity but high specificity in detecting UTI.},

   the dynamical and structural properties of water/methanol solutions as a

   quantities such as the self-diffusion coefficient and the spin lattice
   relaxation time and structurally dependent quantities like the proton
   chemical shift of all the chemical groups present in the mixture. In
   fact, by means of high resolution NMR spectroscopy, it is possible to
   study separately all the hydrogens belonging to the different functional
   groups. We argue that the physical properties of the solution are
   influenced by the interplay between hydrophobic and hydrophilic
   interactions that in turn depend on the solution concentration and on

Abstract = {To date control strategies in detecting anabolic agents for promoting
   growth of food producing animals are mainly related to screening
   techniques based on immunochemical and physiochemical methods, whose
   major limit is represented by relative low analytical sensitivity. As a
   consequence, consumers are currently exposed to molecules with potential
   carcinogenic effects such as 17 beta-estradiol, the most powerful
   substance with estrogenic effect. Therefore, high analytical sensitivity
   screening and confirmatory methods are required, coupling easiness of
   use and efficiency. We here report on the immunodetection of 17
   beta-estradiol in serum by antibody-immobilized microcantilever
   resonators, an innovative biosensing platform able to quantify an
   adsorbed target mass (such as cells, nucleic acids, biomolecules, etc.)
   thanks to a shift in resonance frequency. Our tool based on
   microcantilever resonator arrays has shown to be capable of
   discriminating treated and untreated animals, showing the ability of
   detecting traces of 17 beta-estradiol in serum at concentrations lower
   than the present accepted physiological serum concentration threshold
   value (40 ppt) and commercial ELISA tests (25 ppt). The method exhibits
   a limit of detection of 20 ppt and a limited cross-reactivity with high
   concentrations (10 ppb) of similar molecules (testosterone). (C) 2012

Title = {Could drought conditions trigger Schmallenberg virus and other
   arboviruses circulation?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {12},
Month = {FEB 14},
Abstract = {Background: In 2011, a new orthobunyavirus, named the Schmallenberg
   virus (SBV), was discovered in Europe. Like the related Shamonda virus,
   SBV is an arbovirus (arthropod-borne virus). After its discovery, the
   virus was detected in a wide area in north-western Europe, an unexpected
   finding in a territory where climatic conditions would not seem ideal
   for arbovirus transmission. This sudden expansion suggests the effect of
   2011 drought as a key factor that may have triggered SBV circulation.
   The possible influence of drought, recorded in north-western Europe in
   early 2011, on virus circulation was evaluated.
   Methods and results: The locations of SBV detections in Europe until
   April 2012 were obtained, and area of virus circulation was evaluated by
   kernel density estimation. Precipitation data in SBV circulation area,
   summarized by the 3 month precipitation indexes of May, were compared
   with precipitation data outside that area, confirming driest conditions
   in that area.
   Conclusions: The onset of drought conditions recorded in the SBV
   detection area in early 2011 may have promoted the circulation of this
   virus. A correlation between circulation of some arboviruses and drought
   has been reported elsewhere. This was mainly explained by an effect of
   water deficit on the environment, which altered the relationships
   between vectors and reservoirs, but this correlation might be also the
   result of unknown effects of drought on the vectors. The effect of
   drought conditions on arbovirus circulation is most likely
   underestimated and should be considered, since it could promote
   expansion of arboviruses into new areas in a global warming scenario.},

Abstract = {A new chromatographic method is proposed for the analysis of aflatoxin
   M1 in milk. The method is based on liquidliquid extraction followed by
   LC-MS/MS analysis. Liquidliquid extraction (LLE) is performed on the
   defatted milk plus sodium chloride by using ethyl acetate as an
   extraction solvent. Accuracy and precision were evaluated at the LOQ
   (15?ng?kg1) spiked sample as well as with three other different
   naturally contaminated reference materials. The mean overall recovery
   (n?=?24) was 95\% with a confidence interval of 1.9\% and a CV\% of
   4.5\%. The performance of the proposed method was compared with that of
   the Official ISO Method based on the use of immunoaffinity
   chromatography columns (IAC): LLE protocol could be considered a valid
   alternative to the LC-IAC. In general it showed better accuracy with
   lower data dispersion. Moreover, the sample preparation is very simple
   and straightforward, potentially being applicable as a high-throughput
   method which, on account of its simplicity and low cost, may be applied
   to the analysis of a large number of samples in the occasion of
   outbreaks of large-scale contamination.},

Abstract = {The few studies attempting to specifically characterize dermatophytes
   from hair samples of dogs and cats using PCR-based methodology relied on
   sequence-based analysis of selected genetic markers. The aim of the
   present investigation was to establish and evaluate a PCR-based approach
   employing genetic markers of nuclear DNA for the specific detection of
   dermatophytes on such specimens. Using 183 hair samples, we directly
   compared the test results of our one-step and nested-PCR assays with
   those based on conventional microscopy and in vitro culture techniques
   (using the latter as the reference method). The one step-PCR was highly
   accurate (AUC > 90) for the testing of samples from dogs, but only
   moderately accurate (AUC = 78.6) for cats. A nested-PCR was accurate
   (AUC = 93.6) for samples from cats, and achieved higher specificity
   (94.1 and 94.4\%) and sensitivity (100 and 94.9\%) for samples from dogs
   and cats, respectively. In addition, the nested-PCR allowed the
   differentiation of Microsporum canis from Trichophyton interdigitale
   (zoophilic) and geophilic dermatophytes (i.e., Microsporum gypseum or
   Trichophyton terrestre), which was not possible using the one
   step-assay. The PCRs evaluated here provide practical tools for
   diagnostic applications to support clinicians in initiating prompt and
   targeted chemotherapy of dermatophytoses.},

Title = {Morbillivirus infection in cetaceans stranded along the Italian
   coastline: Pathological, immunohistochemical and biomolecular findings},
Journal = {RESEARCH IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {94},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Morbilliviruses are recognized as biological agents highly impacting the
   health and conservation status of free-ranging cetaceans worldwide, as
   clearly exemplified by the two Dolphin Morbillivirus (DMV) epidemics of
   1990-1992 and 2006-2008 among Mediterranean striped dolphins (Stenella
   coeruleoalba). After these two epidemics, morbilliviral infection (MI)
   cases with peculiar neurobiological features were reported in striped
   dolphins stranded along the Spanish coastline. Affected cetaceans showed
   a subacute-to-chronic, non-suppurative encephalitis, with brain lesions
   strongly resembling those found in human ``subacute sclerosing
   panencephalitis{''} and ``old dog encephalitis{''}. Brain was the only
   tissue in which morbilliviral antigen and/or genome could be detected.
   Beside a case of morbilliviral encephalitis in a striped dolphin's calf
   stranded in 2009, we observed 5 additional MI cases in 2 striped
   dolphins, 1 bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and 2 fin whales
   (Balaenoptera physalus), all stranded in 2011 along the Italian
   coastline. Noteworthy, 3 of these animals (2 striped dolphins and I
   bottlenose dolphin) showed immunohistochemical (IHC) and/or biomolecular
   (PCR) evidence of morbilliviral antigen and/or genome exclusively in
   their brain, with 1 striped dolphin and I bottlenose dolphin also
   exhibiting a non-suppurative encephalitis. Furthermore, simultaneous IHC
   and PCR evidence of a Toxoplasma gondii coinfection was obtained in I
   fin whale.
   The above results are consistent with those reported in striped dolphins
   after the two MI epidemics of 1990-92 and 2006-2008, with evidence of
   morbilliviral antigen and/or genome being found exclusively in the brain
   tissue from affected animals. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {A spectrophotometric method, based on the electronic absorption and
   second-derivative spectra of beef drip, has been developed to detect the
   amount of carbon monoxide bound to myoglobin in treated beef samples.
   The method has been validated following the criteria reported in the
   Eurachem guides. The limit of detection, equal to 0.14 mu m, has been
   evaluated analysing ten blank samples, taking into account the mean
   concentration and the resulting standard deviations. The accuracy of the
   method has been studied in terms of trueness and precision; the first is
   expressed as per cent recovery (always exceeding 90\%) and the second as
   relative standard deviation. The method is easy, rapid and allows one to
   determine qualitatively and quantitatively the CO concentration in the
   meat drip, by simply measuring in the UVVis spectrum of an unknown
   sample the absorbance values at three specific wavelengths: 423, 429 and
   434 nm.},

Abstract = {In humans, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) gene battery constitutes
   a set of contaminant-responsive genes, which have been recently shown to
   be involved in the regulation of several patho-physiological conditions,
   including tumorigenesis.
   As the domestic dog represents a valuable animal model in comparative
   oncology, mRNA levels of cytochromes P450 1A1, 1A2 and 1B1 (CYP1A1, 1A2
   and 1B1), AHR, AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT), AHR repressor (AHRR,
   whose partial sequence was here obtained) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2)
   were measured in dog control tissues (liver, skin, mammary gland and
   bone), in 47 mast cell tumors (MCTs), 32 mammary tumors (MTs), 5
   osteosarcoma (OSA). and related surgical margins.
   Target genes were constitutively expressed in the dog, confirming the
   available human data. Furthermore, their pattern of expression in tumor
   biopsies was comparable to that already described in a variety of human
   cancers; in particular, both AHR and COX2 genes were up-regulated and
   positively correlated, while CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNAs were generally
   poorly expressed.
   This work demonstrated for the first time that target mRNAs are
   expressed in neoplastic tissues of dogs, thereby increasing the
   knowledge about dog cancer biology and confirming this species as an
   useful animal model for comparative studies on human oncology. (C) 2012

Title = {Identification of Mammalian Orthoreovirus Type 3 in Italian Bats},

Volume = {60},

Abstract = {This study describes the isolation and molecular characterization of
   Mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) in microbats. Faecal samples and dead
   individuals available from rehabilitation centres or collected from
   known roost sites were virologically tested. In total, 112 carcasses of
   bats found dead, and 44 faecal samples were analysed. Nineteen viral
   strains were isolated by in vitro cell culture from faecal and tissue
   samples of different bat species (Pipistrellus khulii, Tadarida
   teniotis, Rhinolophus hipposideros and Vespertilio murinus), and they
   were morphologically identified as reoviruses by negative staining
   electron microscopy observation. The definitive assignment of all
   isolates to MRV was confirmed by RT-PCR assays targeting the L1 gene.
   Through a multiplex RT-PCR assay targeting the S1 gene, we typed 15 of
   19 isolates as MRV type 3. Partial L1 (416 bp) and complete S1 (1416 bp)
   sequences of the isolates were analysed and compared with those of
   reference strains obtained from GenBank, belonging to the three
   serotypes. Molecular analysis of the S1 gene revealed that the amino
   acid residues associated with neurotropism (198-204NLAIRLP, 249I, 350D
   and 419E) were highly conserved among the Italian bat strains. These
   results suggest that potentially neurotropic MRV type 3 strains are
   widespread among Italian bats. Furthermore, the identification of MRV
   type 3 in bat species such as Pipistrellus Khulii, which is common in
   urban areas and known for its close contact with humans, underlines the
   need for vigilance.},

Abstract = {The results of an epidemiological survey for canine parvovirus (CPV) in
   European countries are reported. Faecal samples collected from 615 dogs
   with acute gastroenteritis were analysed by using molecular methods,
   showing that CPV-2a is the predominant variant in most countries,
   followed by CPV-2c and CPV-2b. Thirty uncharacterised strains were types
   as CPV-2c by sequence analysis of the full-length VPV2 gene, but they
   displayed the non-coding mutation A406IG in the probe-binding region,
   which prevented the correct oligonucleotide annealing. A minor groove
   binding probe assay was developed for the detection of the A406IG mutant
   and classical CPV-2c strains. The detection of mutations in the
   oligonucleotide-binding region highlights the need to update the
   molecular diagnostic tools in order to identify emerging mutant CPVs.},

Abstract = {Diagnostic and containment measures are essential for the management of
   avian influenza. In this study, a monoclonal antibody (MAb)-based
   competitive ELISA for detecting antibodies against H5 avian influenza
   viruses was developed and validated. Twenty-five anti-H5 MAbs were
   characterised using competitive, indirect and sandwich ELISAs,
   immunofluorescence, Western blotting and virus neutralisation and
   haemagglutination inhibition assays. One MAb (5D8) with wide
   intra-subtype cross-reactivity was selected and characterised using
   escape mutant selection. Epitope analysis showed that this MAb
   recognises a conformational epitope comprising amino acid residues in
   positions 170, 235 and 240 located in the receptor binding domain. The
   diagnostic performance of the test was evaluated by ROC analysis using a
   panel of 950 known sera collected from different avian species,
   including chickens, turkeys, ducks, pheasants, wild Anseriformes and
   ostriches. The competitive ELISA had excellent diagnostic performance
   and discriminatory power with high Se and Sp values (Se: 99.6-95\% CI
   98.0-100; Sp: 99.4-95\% CI 98.5-99.8). In addition to its excellent
   diagnostic performance, properties of the competitive ELISA, such as
   high feasibility of testing sera without pre-treatment and potential for
   automation and instrument-mediated detection, make it ideal for
   screening samples, confirming positive HI assay results or analysing
   samples that are difficult to test using the HI assay. Published by

   under controlled training was monitored. In vitro expanded oAECs showed
   a constant proliferative ability, a conserved phenotype and stable

   was also regularly documented. US controls showed the infilling of the
   defect and early good alignment of the fibers and 12 horses resumed
   their previous activity. Histological and immunohistochemical
   examinations in an explanted tendon demonstrated the low immunogenicity
   of oAECs that were able to survive in the healing site. In addition,
   oAECs supported the regenerative process producing ovine collagen type I
   amongst the equine collagen fibers. Considering our results, oAECs can

Title = {Mycoplasma bovis infection: an observational study in a dairy herd},
Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2013},

Abstract = {Introduction - Mycoplasma bovis (M. bovis) is considered an important
   pathogen in cattle, causing respiratory disease, arthritis, otitis and
   mastitis. In particular, respiratory disease of calves can cause
   significant economic losses in endemically infected farms. The control
   of mycoplasmal pneumonia in calves has to rely on the correct management
   of the herd, since vaccines are not available and antibiotic therapy is
   often not effective.
   Aim - The study was carried out in a dairy cattle herd, with a history
   of several mycoplasmal pneumonia outbreaks in calves in the last five
   years. Aim of this work was the identification of the epidemiological
   features of M. bovis infection in calves, to reduce the spreading of
   infection in the first weeks of life. In particular, prevalence of M.
   bovis excretion in milk and colostrum of cows and incidence of M. bovis
   in nasal swabs of their calves in the first eight weeks of life were
   investigated.
   Materials and methods - Two observational studies were conducted, a
   transversal study in cows after parturition and a cohort study in
   calves. The study was carried out from February 2011 to May 2011, on 60
   cows and their 60 calves; each calf received milk and colostrum from its
   mother only, and it was immediately removed from her after parturition
   and hosted in an individual crate. Three samples of colostrum/milk from
   cows were taken weekly from day 0 to day 14 post parturition, and nasal
   swabs were taken from calves weekly for the first 8 weeks of life. Data
   on the health status of the animals and body temperature of calves were
   recorded on a daily basis. Both the colostrum/milk samples from cows and
   the nasal swabs from calves were cultured for Mycoplasma and then typed
   by PCR.
   Results and discussion - The prevalence of M. bovis infection in cows
   was 5\% (I.C. 95\% 2.12\%-10.91\%) all the positive cows were
   primiparous. All the calves resulted positive within the 6th week of
   life, therefore no correlation was possible between the infectious
   status of the calf and the presence of M. bovis in milk/colostrum. The
   prevalence of infection in calves peaked at the second week, and the
   four calves born from excreting cows were positive at the first (3
   animals) and second (1) week of life, but this datum was not
   statistically different from the media. Several symptoms of respiratory
   disease were recorded in calves during the study, but no correlation was
   found between the onset of respiratory signs and the presence of M.
   bovis in nostrils in the same week.
   Conclusions - During the study, only primiparous cows were excreting M.
   bovis in milk or colostrum; this finding, if confirmed, can be of
   importance in controlling the disease in closed herds. The high
   prevalence of infection in calves is common in herds endemically
   infected by M. bovis. Nevertheless, the high incidence of infection in
   calves in the second week of life could suggest a major role of
   horizontal transmission in the diffusion of M. bovis infection in the
   herd considered.},

Abstract = {Is DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) dysfunction involved in epigenetic
   deregulation of placentae from embryos obtained by assisted reproduction
   technologies (ARTs)?
   DNMT1 expression in growing placentae of in vitro produced (IVP) embryos
   is compromised and associated with pregnancy loss.
   DNMT1 maintains the methylation profile of genes during cell division.
   The methylation status of genes involved in placenta development is
   altered in embryos obtained in vitro. Disturbances in the epigenetic
   regulation of gene expression during placentogenesis could be involved
   in the frequent developmental arrest and loss of IVP embryos.
   Forty sheep were naturally mated (Group 1, CTR). IVP blastocysts (24 per
   ewe) were surgically transferred to the remaining 46 recipient sheep 6
   days after oestrus (Group 2). Twenty-one recipients from Group 1 and 27
   recipients from Group 2 were allowed to deliver in order to compare
   embryo survival in both groups at term (150 days). From the remaining
   recipients (n 38), fetuses and placentae of both groups were recovered
   by paramedian laparotomy at Days 20, 22, 24, 26 and 28 of gestation.
   Immediately after collection, early placental tissues
   (chorion-allantois) were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and DNMT1
   expression and activity was evaluated. mRNA levels (for DNMT1, HDAC2,
   PCNA, DMAP1, MEST, IGF2, CDKN1C, H19) and the methylation status of H19
   were also analyzed. Furthermore, embryo size and survival rate were
   measured.
   Our study shows that DNMT1 expression was reduced in early placentae
   from sheep IVP embryos. This reduction was associated with growth arrest
   and subsequent death of the sheep embryos. Conversely, normal levels of
   DNMT1 and its cofactors were observed in placentae from IVP embryos that
   survived this developmental bottleneck. Although DNA methylation
   machinery was severely compromised in IVP placentae only up to Day 24,
   the low DNMT1 enzymatic activity that persisted after this stage in IVP
   placentae was not lethal for the developing embryos.
   The studied genes represent only a small fraction of genes regulating
   DNA methylation. Further studies are needed to evaluate changes in the
   expression and methylation status of other genes that may lead to
   developmental arrest of IVP embryos. As this is the only study
   evaluating the functionality of DNMT1 machinery in placentae from ART
   embryos, studies on other species are needed to confirm if our
   observation may be applicable to all mammalian embryos produced in
   vitro.
   The knowledge about compromised activity of DNMT1 in placentae obtained
   from IVP embryos should stimulate detailed studies on the metabolic
   requirements of oocytes and embryos in order to adequately enrich the
   culture media.

Abstract = {Natural infections of cattle associated with Listeria innocua have not
   been reported. This report describes the first case of cerebral
   listeriosis in a bull due to Listeria innocua. The animal presented
   neurological signs characterized by weakness, incoordination and
   recumbency. Histopathologic evaluation of brain tissue revealed
   multifocal microabscesses, perivascular lymphocytic cuffing, vasculitis,
   oedema and haemorrhages. All lesions extended from the medulla oblongata
   to the basal nuclei/parietal cortex area. Indirect immunohistochemistry
   labelled for Listeria sp. in the brain tissue, but not for Listeria
   monocytogenes, neurotropic Flaviviruses, BVDV, bovine Herpesvirus 1,
   Chlamydophila spp. and Histophilus somni. PCR was negative for ovine
   herpesvirus. L innocua was isolated from brainstem and identified by
   biochemical tests (Camp and beta-hemolysis negative). Subsequently, the
   species was confirmed by a duplex PCR and minisequencing assays. L.
   innocua should be histologically considered as a differential diagnosis
   of thrombotic meningoencephalitis, malignant catarrhal fever and
   cerebral listeriosis due to L monocytogenes in cattle. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {Contents Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP)
   strains have been isolated from dogs with increasing frequency;
   prolonged or excessive use of antimicrobials is associated with the
   selection of MRSP, and misuse of antimicrobials is frequent in breeding
   kennels. This study was carried out in two breeding kennels (A and B) in
   which we had isolated MRSP in 2008: the aim was to assess colonization
   of previously positive bitches and of other bitches sharing the same
   environment and to assess the genetic profile of both the old and the
   new strains {[}spa typing, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec
   (SCCmec) typing and Pulsed-field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE)]. Six
   animals from Kennel A (two from 2008) and eight from Kennel B (one from
   2008) were tested: 16 MRSP strains were isolated only from bitches
   housed in Kennel B. Old and new isolates were mecA positive, resulted
   spa type t02 and carried SSCmec IIIII. PGFE showed that all isolates
   were related and belonged to the main clone lineage dominating in
   Europe, ST71-J-t02-IIIII. Kennels A and B differ in the use of
   antimicrobials, which has been reduced over time in Kennel A, while has
   remained excessive in Kennel B, where many agents belonging to different
   classes (third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, macrolids)
   are administered to dogs, without veterinary supervision, especially
   around parturition. Misuse of antimicrobials is the key factor for the
   selection of MRSP strains in healthy dogs and for their persistence over
   time. Dog breeders should be aware that infections caused by
   multiresistant bacteria have very limited therapeutical options and
   represent a huge challenge for animal health.},

Abstract = {Yessotoxins (YTXs) are polycyclic ether compounds produced by
   phytoplanktonic dinoflagellates and accumulated in filter-feeding
   shellfish. Mouse bioassay is still the official method to detect these
   toxins, even if it is lacking of specificity and sensitivity. Moreover,
   there is growing resistance against the use of animal experiments. Many
   efforts have been made to determine YTXs with other methods. The
   detection of YTX using a functional assay allows its quantification with
   an automated and repetitive technique at concentrations in the range of
   the 1 mg of YTX equivalent/kg European regulatory limit. In this study,
   an in vitro functional assay based on YTX treatment of MCF-7 cells and
   resulting in the accumulation of a 100-kDa fragment of E-cadherin was
   developed on samples of Mytilus galloprovincialis collected from the
   Adriatic Sea, Italy, along the coasts of Abruzzo, Molise, and Emilia
   Romagna regions. The YTX concentrations ranged from 0.2 to 1.8 mg of YTX
   equivalent/kg. The occurrence of levels exceeding the above mentioned
   limit was observed only in samples of Emilia Romagna region. This last
   result could represent a risk for human health, but these shellfish were
   not intended to consumers, because they belonged to a preventive
   monitoring program.},

Title = {Tail dockingof sheep and animal welfare: a review},
Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {21+},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Tail docking is a common practice in sheep extensive farming. This
   review gives an overview on the main aspects of sheep tail docking,
   describing different commonly used techniques. Physiological and
   behavioral indicators useful to evaluate the presence of pain are also
   described, as well as the use of anesthetic and analgesic drugs.
   Directive 1998/58 CE on farm animal welfare does not provide for
   specific rules on tail docking, delegating relevant national provisions
   to the stakeholders. Dispositions are present at National level,
   although some countries (including Italy) do not have a specific law to
   safeguard ovine welfare during tail docking procedures. This procedure
   is essential in order to prevent myiasis, however, it is often performed
   paying no attention on animal welfare. Painful practices are used by
   non-trained personnel and anesthetics or analgesic are uncommon in this
   procedure. As emerged analyzing behavioral and hormonal parameters (e.
   g. cortisol level), pain perceived by ovine differs in relation to the
   type of practice applied. Necrosis inducted by a prolonged application
   of a rubber ring is the most commonly used technique, although this has
   a considerable impact on welfare. The mechanical pressure using the
   Burdizzo clamp, alone or combined to the rubber ring, resulted less
   painful that the use of the rubber ring alone. Although economically not
   advantageous, local anesthesia would be always advisable, especially in
   animals older than a week. In any case, in order to avoid repercussion
   on colostrum assumption, this technique should never be performed on
   lambs within the first 24 hours of live. From this review it is evident
   that the practice of tail docking is still controversial with regard to
   its effects on the welfare of sheep, although its effectiveness in the
   prevention of myiasis seems clear. Alternative strategies for myiasis
   control (e.g. integrated flies population management, animal
   immunization, sensible areas shearing) should be systematically used,
   and tail docking should be carried out only in case of real necessity.},

Abstract = {It has been previously demonstrated that the progesterone receptor gene
   is up-regulated in the sex accessory glands of pre-pubertal and adult
   male bovines after 17 beta-oestradiol treatment. In the present study, a
   qualitative screening method was optimised to detect 17 beta-oestradiol
   treatment using absolute quantification by qPCR of the progesterone
   receptor gene to determine the amount of gene expression in
   bulbo-urethral glands. An external standard curve was generated and
   developed with TaqMan (R) technology. Based on two in vivo experiments,
   the decision limit CCa, sensitivity and specificity of this screening
   method were established. Trial 1 consisted of 32 Friesian veal calves
   divided into two groups: group A (n?=?12), consisting of animals treated
   with four doses of 17 beta-oestradiol (5?mg?week-1 per animal); and
   group B (n?=?20), consisting of control animals. Trial 2 was performed
   on 26 Charolaise beef cattle that either received five doses of 17
   beta-oestradiol (group C; 20?mg?week-1 per animal; n?=?6) or remained
   untreated (group D; n?=?20). Further, progesterone receptor gene
   expression was evaluated in beef and veal calves for human consumption.
   A specific CCa on 20 Piedmontese control beef cattle was calculated to
   include these animals in a field investigation. Five out of 190 beef
   cattle and 26 out of 177 calves tested expressed the progesterone
   receptor gene above their respective CCa and they were classified as
   being suspected of 17 beta-oestradiol treatment. Additionally, 58\% of
   veal calves that tested suspect via qPCR exhibited histological lesions
   of the bulbo-urethral gland tissue, which are typical of oestrogen
   administration and are consistent with hyperplasia and metaplasia of the
   glandular epithelium.},

Abstract = {Background: Betanodaviruses are the causative agents of Viral
   Encephalopathy and Retinopathy (VER). To date, more than 50 species have
   proved to be susceptible and among them, those found in genus
   Epinephelus are highly represented. Clinical disease outbreaks are
   generally characterized by typical nervous signs and significant
   mortalities mainly associated with aquaculture activities, although some
   concerns for the impact of this infection in wild fish have been raised.
   In this study, the authors present the first documented report
   describing an outbreak of VER in wild species in the Mediterranean
   basin.
   Case presentation: In late summer - early winter 2011
   (September-December), significant mortalities affecting wild Dusky
   grouper (Epinephelus marginatus), Golden grouper (Epinephelus costae)
   and European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) were reported in the
   municipality of Santa Maria di Leuca (Northern Ionian Sea, Italy). The
   affected fish showed an abnormal swimming behavior and swollen abdomens.
   During this epizootic, five moribund fish showing clear neurological
   signs were captured and underwent laboratory investigations. Analytical
   results confirmed the diagnosis of VER in all the specimens. Genetic
   characterization classified all betanodavirus isolates as belonging to
   the RGNNV genotype, revealing a close genetic relationship with viral
   sequences obtained from diseased farmed fish reared in the same area in
   previous years.
   Conclusion: The close relationship of the viral sequences between the
   isolates collected in wild affected fish and those isolated during
   clinical disease outbreaks in farmed fish in the same area in previous
   years suggests a persistent circulation of betanodaviruses and
   transmission between wild and farmed stocks. Further investigations are
   necessary to assess the risk of viral transmission between wild and
   farmed fish populations, particularly in marine protected areas where
   endangered species are present.},

Abstract = {The extensive circulation of Highly Pathogenic (HP) H5N1 Avian Influenza
   in Egypt in poultry since 2006 resulted in the emergence of distinct
   clades with the recent identification of a further clade: 2.2.1.1. The
   aim of this study was to characterize for the first time the antigenic
   profile of an extensive collection of genetically diverse Egyptian H5N1
   HP viruses isolated between 2007 and 2010 applying antigenic cartography
   and principal component analysis to serological data. We identified that
   Egyptian H5N1 viruses have undergone significant antigenic
   diversification between 2007 and 2010 and two distinct antigenic
   clusters co-circulated in 2010. Such clusters correlated with 2.2.1 and
   2.2.1.1 clades, showing for the first time that the new emerging clade
   2.2.1.1 is antigenically distinct. This study highlights that the
   antigenic diversity of H5N1 HP Egyptian viruses may represent a
   potential challenge for the development of an effective vaccination
   programme for animal and human health in Egypt. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Assessment of motor laterality in foals and young horses (Equus
   caballus) through an analysis of derailment at trot},
Journal = {PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {109},
Pages = {8-13},

Abstract = {The conflicting results regarding the study of motor laterality in
   horses may indicate that there does not exist a proper method to assess
   the degree and the direction of motor bias in these animals.
   Unfortunately, even less is known about the development of laterality in
   horses, and to what extent early manipulations can still exert their
   effects in adulthood. We propose a new method that can be easily applied
   at a very early age thus avoiding testing adult horses eventually biased
   by human handling and/or training.
   Forty-six horses (29 nine-month-old foals and 17 two-year old horses)
   were handled since birth bilaterally and housed in groups in wide areas.
   At the time of the analysis, in order to minimize environmental and
   sensorial disturbances, each horse was tested in a round pen
   individually or as dyad mother-foal. The ability/inability to properly
   execute a circle at trot was then recorded, assuming the direction of
   derailment, i.e. the cutting of the circle, as an indicator of motor
   bias.
   From the results of the study it is arguable that motor laterality in
   horses is acquired over time: in fact foals tested while their mothers
   were being subjected to longeing showed a higher percentage of
   ambidextrous animals, while two-year-old horses appeared biased toward
   the right (p<0.05). Results are discussed in the light of the scientific
   knowledge about equine biomechanics, taking into account horses'
   locomotion that leads to the advancement of the body mass through the
   activation of a kinetic chain that originates from the hindquarters. (C)

Title = {Vector-borne helminths of dogs and humans in Europe},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JAN 16},
Abstract = {Presently, 45\% of the total human population of Europe, as well as
   their domestic and companion animals, are exposed to the risk of
   vector-borne helminths (VBH) causing diseases. A plethora of intrinsic
   biological and extrinsic factors affect the relationship among
   helminths, vectors and animal hosts, in a constantly changing
   environment. Although canine dirofilarioses by Dirofilaria immitis and
   Dirofilaria repens are key examples of the success of VBH spreading into
   non-endemic areas, another example is represented by Thelazia callipaeda
   eyeworm, an emergent pathogen of dogs, cats and humans in several
   regions of Europe. The recent finding of Onchocerca lupi causing canine
   and human infestation in Europe and overseas renders the picture of VBH
   even more complicated. Similarly, tick-transmitted filarioids of the
   genus Cercopithifilaria infesting the skin of dogs were recently shown
   to be widespread in Europe. Although for most of the VBH above there is
   an increasing accumulation of research data on their distribution at
   national level, the overall impact of the diseases they cause in dogs
   and humans is not fully recognised in many aspects. This review
   investigates the reasons underlying the increasing trend in distribution
   of VBH in Europe and discusses the diagnostic and control strategies
   currently available. In addition, this article provides the authors'
   opinion on some topics related to VBH that would deserve further
   scientific investigation.},

Title = {IgG antibodies from dourine infected horses identify a distinctive

Abstract = {Diagnosis and control of dourine is strongly based on serological
   evidence, but knowledge of the humoral response of horses during
   infection is limited. In this study we developed a chemiluminescent
   immunoblotting (cIB) assay to characterise the Trypanosoma equiperdum
   antigen pattern recognised by IgGs from naturally or experimentally
   dourine-infected horses and analyse the kinetics of IgG humoral response
   following the infection. One compounding factor is that sera from
   uninfected animals often cross-react with T. equiperdum antigens.
   Development of the cIB assay was based on the hypothesis that serum IgGs
   from healthy and infected animals recognise different T. equiperdum
   antigen patterns. We used sera from 8 naturally infected horses which
   had recovered from Italian outbreaks and 2 experimentally infected
   mares. In addition, sera from 10 healthy control animals, eight of which
   were CFT positive but IFA negative for dourine, were collected from
   disease free regions. Sera were compared by the complement fixation test
   (CFT), indirect immune fluorescence (IFA) and the cIB assay.
   cIB analysis revealed that IgGs from infected horses, in contrast to
   IgGs from healhty horses, specifically recognise a T. equiperdum
   antigenic profile with low molecular weight bands ranging between 16 and
   35 kDa. A time course experiment indicated that IgGs specific for the
   16-35 kDa parasite protein fraction appear 17 days post-infection. The
   cIB assay confirmed all ten infected animals as positive and all
   controls as negative. This study demonstrated that analysis of IgGs by
   cIB can provide clear confirmation of trypanosome infection in horses,
   suggesting that this technique can be applied as a confirmatory
   serological test for dourine infection. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to monitor the age related variation of the

   Additionally, lymphocytes and neutrophils percentage was measured.
   Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against bovine lymphocyte cell surface

   peripheral blood samples prepared from 36 different aged water buffalo
   calves. Results showed the percentage of positive stained cells
   expressing CD4, CD8 and WC1 (gamma/delta), as determined by flow
   cytometry. The subsets proportions varied significantly (P< 0.05) from
   the youngest age groups to the older ones as CD4+ increased while CD8+
   and WC1+ decreased.
   The present study shows that the T-cell subpopulations are present in
   peripheral blood of buffalo calves as well as veal calves. Furthermore,
   there is a half reduction of neutrophil : lymphocytes ratio at the age

Abstract = {The current study describes the first detection of a field strain of
   BuHV-1 in a water buffalo foetus in Europe. The study was carried out by
   analysing samples of aborted buffalo foetus collected from water buffalo
   farms in southern Italy during a one year period of routine state
   surveillance. Foetus tissues were investigated for the presence of
   pathogens typically involved in abortion. In all samples analysed, the
   presence of a single pathogen was observed with no cases of
   co-infection. One foetus, positive for herpesvirus, was further
   investigated to typify the virus identified. In particular, we
   characterised the herpesvirus by sequencing the gE gene ( US8) and we
   carried out phylogenetic analysis to assess the relationship between our
   isolate and other ruminant Alphaherpesviruses. The herpesvirus
   discovered in this research, that we called BuHV-1 Mediterranean
   isolate, showed the highest degree of homology with BuHV-1 strain b6. To
   our knowledge, the current study represents the first survey of BuHV-1
   in buffalo abortive tissues suggesting its involvement in an abortion
   episode. Genetic analysis demonstrated that the virus isolated is
   closely related to, but genetically distinct from the BuHV-1 b6. These
   data suggest the presence of a BuHV-1 subtype typically found in
   Mediterranean water buffalo and/or the existence of a more virulent
   strain, possibly associated with abortion.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects of
   2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenylether (PBDE-47) on the Chamelea gallina clam
   (according to current commercial regulations: Venus gallina). PBDEs,
   which are used as flame retardants in various industrial products, are
   classed as hazardous substances by Directive 2011/65/EU. They are
   bioaccumulative compounds, considered to be endocrine disruptors,
   genotoxic, neurotoxic and practically ubiquitous, and their
   concentration in the environment has considerably increased in recent
   years. The aim of this study is to establish the effects of PBDE-47 on
   Chamelea gallina: toxic power and any harmful effects on the gonads,
   bioaccumulation capacity in the tissues, and possible entry into the
   food chain. The research used 96-hour and 21-day experimental tests on
   clams housed in filtered seawater. The tests were preceded by a period
   of acclimatisation of the molluscs lasting five to seven days. The clams
   were fed on seaweed (Dunaliella tertiolecta). The choice of the toxic
   compound PBDE-47 was based on the high concentration, among the
   congeners of PBDE, found in some aquatic species. The study demonstrated
   that the concentration of the contaminant used did not alter the vital
   functions, cause significant levels of mortality or lead to evident
   alteration in the gonads of Chamelea gallina. However, the research
   demonstrated the bioaccumulation capacity of the bivalve mollusc,
   allowing PBDE-47 to enter the food chain. Veterinaria Italiana 2013, 49

Abstract = {Leukocytes subpopulations in blood and milk of lactating Sarda ewes were
   investigated. Animals characterized by a SSC level <500x10(3)cells/mL
   and a negative bacteriological examination were sampled in early, mid
   and late lactation. Milk differential cell count evidenced that
   macrophage represented the main population (42.8\%+/- 3.5) followed by
   lymphocytes (40.2\%+/- 3.4) and neutrophils (8,6\%+/- 2.1). Flow
   cytometry analysis showed that lymphocytes subsets in milk were quite
   different from blood. High CD8(+) and low CD4(+) lymphocytes percentages
   determined a CD4/CD8 ratio inversion in milk compared to blood (0.3\%+/-
   0.03 vs 1.8\%+/- 0.08). CD8(+) decreased while, conversely, CD4(+)
   increased in late lactation..d T cells were more represented in milk
   (12.6\%+/- 1.3) than in blood (6.8\%+/- 0.3) and their proportions
   appeared similar throughout lactation in both compartments. IL-2
   receptor was mainly expressed in milk on T cytotoxic lymphocytes. Data
   obtained in uninfected mammary glands could allow an early
   discrimination between physiological and pathological changes occurring
   in ewe milk. Further phenotypical and functional studies on milk
   leukocytes subsets might help to understand defense mechanisms of the
   ovine mammary gland against mastitis.},

Abstract = {The buffalo Mediterranean Italian breed was very much studied for
   lactation curve. Data on lactation curves after the first, the second
   and the third calving are reported. In all the 3 lactations we have
   similar curves, with the production peak on the 40th day, in the second
   and third lactations, while in the first lactation it is shown on the
   50th day and with a longer duration. Lactation curves were different for
   the first and later parities with lactations of different duration also
   in Nili-Ravi buffaloes. Milk production and milk flow profiles are
   important parameters to be recorded and evaluated. In fact they give
   various advices on milking management. The milk flow curve is typical
   for each animal and must be recorded singly. Buffaloes are characterized
   by longer teat and teat canal, and particularly by stronger muscular
   resistance of teat wall, than in cow: it is necessary a high vacuum
   level for opening the teat canal and beginning milk ejection. A recent
   trial is reported, where the manual stimulation at different times
   provoked the increasing of released oxytocin and of the intra-mammary
   pressure and finally the increasing of cisternal teat largeness and the
   reduction of teat canal length. Buffalo is characterized by smaller
   cisternal fraction than in cattle. The cisternal milk fraction is
   immediately available while the alveolar fraction needs an oxytocin
   stimulation to release. In Mediterranean Italian buffaloes it has been
   observed a higher cisternal fraction of total milk than in Murrah breed.
   In buffalo management, the milking room and the milking machine are
   really a critical point and the characteristics of milking vacuum and
   milking pulsations are strictly connected with milk flow observations.
   Different curves obtained in recent trials during the milking with
   normal milking machine and with Automatic Milking System are reported
   and discussed. A recent study on Mediterranean Italian buffaloes from
   104 different herds showed that 88.86\% of milk is ejected in 4.24 min
   (main milking time), as 8.49\% is ejected in 1.98 min (milk let-down)
   corresponding to the cisternal milk fraction. Only 2.65\% is the milk
   ejected in the stripping phase. These results suggest toapply a
   premilking udder stimulation to reduce milk let-down time increasing the
   average milk flow and reducing total milking time. These results suggest
   to the detachment of milking cluster to reduce the blind phase with the
   following advantages: a) reducing the total milking time and
   consequently worker's time, b) improving the farmer's income and the
   milk quality thought the mastitis incidence decreasing.},

Abstract = {In recent years a significant increase in food supplements consumption
   has been observed, maybe in the belief that they couldn't be dangerous
   for consumers health, even if they don't achieved medical effects.
   However, environmental pollution can cause heavy metals contamination
   that could exceed maximum levels established by European legislation.
   Aim of this work was to evaluate arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead and
   mercury content in 12 food supplements seized in a Piedmont shop by the
   Italian authority against food adulteration. All metals were analysed
   after mineralization and dilution steps by ICP-MS, with the exception of
   mercury, detected by the direct analyser TDA-AAS. Only one sample exceed
   the European maximum limits for lead (3,00 mg/kg) but warning levels of
   chromium (over 3,00 mg/Kg) has been detected in three of them.},

Abstract = {Influenza A viruses commonly cause pancreatitis in naturally and
   experimentally infected animals. In this study, we report the results of
   in vivo investigations carried out to establish whether influenza virus
   infection could cause metabolic disorders linked to pancreatic
   infection. In addition, in vitro tests in human pancreatic islets and in
   human pancreatic cell lines were performed to evaluate viral growth and
   cell damage. Infection of an avian model with two low-pathogenicity
   avian influenza isolates caused pancreatic damage resulting in
   hyperlipasemia in over 50\% of subjects, which evolved into
   hyperglycemia and subsequently diabetes. Histopathology of the pancreas
   showed signs of an acute infection resulting in severe fibrosis and
   disruption of the structure of the organ. Influenza virus nucleoprotein
   was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the acinar tissue. Human
   seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 viruses and avian H7N1 and H7N3 influenza virus
   isolates were able to infect a selection of human pancreatic cell lines.
   Human viruses were also shown to be able to infect human pancreatic
   islets. In situ hybridization assays indicated that viral nucleoprotein
   could be detected in beta cells. The cytokine activation profile
   indicated a significant increase of MIG/CXCL9, IP-10/CXCL10,
   RANTES/CCL5, MIP1b/CCL4, Groa/CXCL1, interleukin 8 (IL-8)/CXCL8, tumor
   necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and IL-6. Our findings indicate that
   influenza virus infection may play a role as a causative agent of
   pancreatitis and diabetes in humans and other mammals.},

Abstract = {A high incidence of parasitic infections in domestic animals has a big
   impact on productivity and it leads to severe economic losses. We
   conducted a preliminary study with the aim of setting out the
   composition of gastrointestinal parasite communities in sheep farms in
   Sicily. In this study the prevalence of parasitic infections in sheep
   caused by intestinal parasites was analysed. The study was carried out
   in adult sheep randomly chosen from selected farms from January to
   December 2011. Individual faecal or intestine samples were collected and
   tested. Almost 60\% of the tested animals resulted to be positive to
   parasites. Distribution of parasites has been related to spatial
   location of farms and seasonal changes. The herds studied were located
   at different altitudes and in different climatic conditions. Eradication
   of gastrointestinal parasites from the environment is generally
   impractical; though, infections can be limited, and control programmes
   should mainly minimise the deriving economic losses.},

Abstract = {Sixteen Mediterranean homogenous lactating buffaloes were divided into
   low protein (LP) and high protein (HP) groups of eight animals each.
   Groups were fed for 120 days two isoenergetic diets (0.90 Milk FU/kg DM)
   with different crude protein (CP) contents and rumen protected
   methionine (RPM) supplement. Milk yield and quality were determined.
   Faecal, blood, and urine samples were collected for the detection of
   urea and insulin in plasma; total-N, urea-N, and creatinine in urine;
   and total-N and N-digestibility in the faeces. To investigate rumen
   microbial diversity four cannulated Mediterranean buffalo cows were fed
   LP and HP diets according to a cross over design. Rumen samples, were
   analyzed for pH, microbial population quantity and diversity using
   classical and molecular techniques including DGGE and Q-PCR. Milk yield,
   protein, casein and fat content were similar in the two groups. Milk
   urea level was significantly lower in LP group. Both urea level in
   plasma and urea-N in urine were significantly higher in the HP. The
   total organic nitrogen excreted detected in urine and manure was higher
   in the HP group. The protein level reduction in diet supplemented with
   RPM seems to negatively affect the growth fungi and protozoa and methane
   production can be reduced by reducing rumen ciliate protozoa. Moreover
   these results indicate that the use of a low CP, RPM supplemented diet
   did not negatively affect milk production or quality, and reduced the
   nitrogen quantity excreted with urine and faeces, thus contributing to
   reduce the impact of buffalo herds on the environment.},

Abstract = {The production of toxins by Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) in
   the intestinal tract is one of the major causes of enteritis and
   enterotoxemia in livestock species. In the present study, 166 C.
   perfringens strains isolated from 176 water buffalo calves which had
   died with clinical enteric symptoms were tested for the presence of
   genes encoding alpha, beta, beta2, enterotoxin, epsilon and iota toxins
   (cpa, cpb, cpb2, cpe, etx and iap) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
   assay. The gene coding for the. -toxin appeared highly frequent, being
   detected in 130 out of 166 isolates (88\%). Out of the 130
   -toxin-positive isolates only in 12 (7.2\%) was the gene coding for the
   beta -toxin detected; in 2 (1.2\%) the gene coding for the enterotoxin
   (cpe) was detected, and in 3 (1.8\%) the gene coding for the e-toxin
   (etx) was detected. The cases clustered seasonally at the end and the
   beginning of the year (November, December, February and March). These
   results confirm the role of toxin-producing C. perfringens in lethal
   enteritis in water buffalo and highlight the need for proper vaccination
   schedules combined with controlled feeding programs and good management
   practices for the effective control of enterotoxemia in the herd.},

Abstract = {This study describes the results of an investigation undertaken to
   determine the cause of an outbreak of mastitis in water buffalo (Bubalus
   bubalis) from a dairy farm (73 buffaloes and 81 cows) located in
   southern Italy. The outbreak began in May 2012. A total of 20 buffalo
   milk and 60 cow milk samples were examined. Bacteriological analysis of
   the milk showed the presence of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptoccoccus
   group B. In 4 milk samples, collected from buffaloes with clinical
   mastitis and negative for other pathogens, Mycoplasma spp was isolated.
   Each isolate was identified by means of PCR assays using M. agalactiae,
   M. bovis, M. putrefaciens, M. mycoides subsp. capri, M. capricolum
   subsp. capricolum, and M. mycoides cluster as reference strains. PCR
   confirmed the identity of the mycoplasmas as Mycoplasma capricolum
   subspecies capricolum (M. capricolum) in 4 of 80 samples of milk samples
   examined. The PCR result was confirmed by means of DNA sequencing. The
   nucleotide sequence was compared with the sequences in the GenBank
   database by using the BLASTN local alignment search tool. All bovine
   milk samples proved negative for the mycoplasma. The entry and
   transmission of M. capricolum may be explained by the presence of a
   group of goats reared on the farm. However, further studies are
   necessary to define both the role of buffaloes as a reservoir for M.
   capricolum and the relevance of this pathogen in buffalo mycoplasmosis.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to verify the effect of bunks on the health,
   welfare and productivity of the buffalo, a species that is characterized
   by high genetic and behavioural variability and in which hierarchic
   phenomena are particularly evident. The trial was conducted for a period
   of 120 days and involved 96 buffaloes bred in the Salerno province. The
   animals were divided into two homogeneous groups according to days in
   milk, body condition score (BCS) and milk production (both quality and
   quantity): buffaloes in Group 1 were maintained on cement pads equipped
   with foam rubber bunks, while those in Group 2 were allocated to similar
   cement pads without bunks. Monthly, milk production was recorded and
   individual milk samples were collected, to evaluate fat and protein
   contents and somatic cell counts. Finally, after 2, 3 and 4 months, milk
   samples were sterilely collected for total bacterial counting. Each
   month, milk samples underwent bacteriological analyses to detect the
   presence of mastitis-causing agents. At the same time-points, the
   well-being of the animals was assessed through determination of the main
   parameters of innate immunity, which are indicators of well-being
   (bactericidal capacity, haemolytic complement, haptoglobin, serum
   lysozyme). Statistical analysis was performed by means of chi-square
   test and ANOVA.
   The results showed that mismanagement can reduce the positive effects of
   using structures that can improve animal welfare.},

Abstract = {This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of transport and
   genotype on the welfare and fear response of laying hens through a
   comparison of three breeds reared in free-range conditions: a commercial
   strain, the Isa Brown (IBh), and two local chicken breeds, the Bionda
   Piemontese (BPh) and the Bianca di Saluzzo (BSh). After a journey of 67
   km (75min) from the farmhouse of origin to the experimental station,
   ninety hens, divided according to breed, were free-range reared for two
   months. Body weight (BW), tonic immobility (TI), red and white blood
   cells, heterophil to lymphocyte (H/L) ratio and 1-acid glycoprotein
   (AGP) were assessed at four different sampling times: at the farmhouse
   of origin (T1), at 1 day (T2), 15 days (T3) and at 2 months (T4) after
   arrival at the experimental station. No statistical differences were
   found between the four sampling times for BW, total red and white blood
   cells or for AGP. An increase in the H/ L ratio (P< 0.05) was recorded
   at time T2 for IBh and BSh, compared to BPh ( P< 0.05). TI was
   significantly higher (P< 0.05) for the local breeds, BPh and BSh, than
   for the commercial strain IBh. The results of this study suggest that
   genetic and adaptive differences can affect both, physiological and
   ethological parameters.},

Abstract = {Paratuberculosis is a chronic infection of domestic and wild ruminants,
   caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis. The persistence
   of paratuberculosis infection for months up to years without exhibiting
   any clinical signs makes the diagnosis and control program a difficult
   proposition. Limited informations on prevalence of paratuberculosis in
   water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) are available. We carried out a study
   on 1350 buffaloes belonging to 56 herds in the Caserta province, of
   Campania region, Italy. The prevalence of infected buffalo dairy herds
   was estimated by a commercial ELISA kit of individual blood samples of
   animals over 24 months of age. On the basis of performance (sensitivity
   43\%, specificity 99.3\%) of ELISA test on serum, the resulting true
   prevalence at animal level and at herd level was 4\% (95\% CI 3\% to
   5\%) and 74,1\% (95\% CI 71.8\% to 76\%). Considering the paucity of
   epidemiological reports in the region our results could be a useful
   contribution towards the prevention of buffalo paratuberculosis in the
   area.},

Abstract = {The aim of this preliminary study was to verify the application of veal
   calves welfare rules to buffalo rearing and as a result, the related
   metabolic and hormonal parameters response. Data regarding housing and
   management of two buffalo farms (A and B) were collected by means of a
   specific farm record card in order to verify the compliance to European
   legislation.
   In both farms, blood samples were taken from 14 newborn buffalo calves
   and followed up monthly from one week to 5 months aged. The haemogram
   was carried out by automatic counter Cell-Dyn 3700 (12 parameters) on
   blood samples with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) within 4
   hours. Furthermore, iron and gamma-Glutamyltransferase (gamma GT) serum
   levels were measured by an automatic biochemical analyzer (Olympus
   4000). Finally, cortisol serum concentration was detected by
   radioimmunoassay (RIA) method. In comparison with farm B, farm A showed
   lesser attention to the compliance of some management parameters and
   weaning procedures. Farm A showed a significant lower average value for
   RBC and haemoglobin (P< 0.05). Iron level was lightly higher in farm B
   whereas a significant increase of cortisol was observed in farm A (P<
   0.05). Nevertheless, in both farms, an increase of gamma GT values as a
   result of a correct colostrum ingestion was observed. In conclusion,
   farm B could be considered as a control for what concerns the veal
   calves rules application to buffalo rearing and the results of welfare
   related haematochemical parameters.},

Abstract = {Kidney diseases as protein-losing nephropathies are predisposing
   conditions for thrombosis/thromboembolism in dogs due to increased blood
   coagulability. The aim of this study was to use thromboelastometry for
   investigation of changes in haemostasis in dogs affected by renal
   proteinuria alone or concomitant with azotemia. The study was done at 55
   client-owned, healthy (n = 34), proteinuric (n = 14), and
   proteinuric/azotemic (n = 7) dogs. Blood coagulation was assessed by
   means of standard coagulation profile and thromboelastometry (in-TEM,
   ex-TEM, and fib-TEM). In proteinuric dogs only the maximum clot firmness
   and maximum clot elasticity significantly increased (P < 0.05), whereas
   in the proteinuric/azotemic dogs the thromboelastometric profiles showed
   a pronounced increase of blood coagulability, as indicated by
   significant changes (P < 0.05) of the variables clotting time, clot
   formation time, a angle, maximum clot firmness and maximum clot
   elasticity. After correction for group affiliation, the linear
   regression analysis showed a non significant association between changes
   in proteinuria and thromboelastometric profiles. In conclusion,
   thromboelastometric changes indicating hypercoagulabilty were more
   consistently found in the dogs with proteinuria/azotemia, than in those
   with proteinuria alone, suggesting that the former dogs can be
   considered at higher thrombotic risk. This is the first study where
   thromboelastometry has been applied to the investigation of haemostatic
   changes in dogs with kidney diseases.},

Abstract = {Although avian influenza (AI) virus of H5 and H7 subtypes has the
   potential to mutate to a highly pathogenic form and cause very high
   mortalities in some poultry species, most AI infections in poultry are
   due to low pathogenic AI (LPAI). Hence serological surveys, coupled with
   passive surveillance activities, are essential to detect sub-clinical
   infections by LPAI viruses, H5 and H7 subtypes. However the proper
   planning of an active surveillance system should be based on a careful
   estimation of its performance. Therefore, the sensitivity of the active
   surveillance system for AI in the western region of Cuba was assessed by
   a stochastic model quantifying the probability of revealing at least one
   animal infected by H5 or H7 subtype. The diagnostic sensitivity of the
   haemagglutination inhibition assay and different levels of within-flock
   prevalence (5\%, 12\% and 30\%) were considered. The sensitivity of the
   surveillance system was then assessed under five different samples size
   scenarios: testing 20, 30, 40, 50 or 60 animals in each flock. Poultry
   flock sites in the western region of Cuba with a size ranging from
   10,000 to 335,000 birds were included in the study.},

Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The objective of this study was to quantify lactoferrin (Lfe) in buffalo
   milk and to examine the factors affecting milk Lfe, such as the
   lactation stage, daily milk yield, parity, and milk somatic cells count
   (SCC). Milk Lfe concentration was detected by the SDS-polyacrilamide gel
   electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The overall mean of Lfe concentration was
   0.332 +/- 0.165 g/kg and ranged from 0.030 to 0.813 g/kg. Milk Lfe
   concentrations increased (P<0.01) with the increase of days in milk, but
   it was not affected by parity. Milk Lfe concentration was significantly
   affected by SCC. The differences became significant when the levels of
   SCC increased up to 200,000/mL. This is the first investigation on the
   levels of Lfe in buffalo milk in reference to daily milk production,
   lactation stage, parity and SCC. Further studies are needed to clarify
   the relationship between Lfe and SCC in buffalo milk.},

Abstract = {Aflatoxins (AFs) are a group of mycotoxins produced by Aspergillus
   genus. Dairy animals fed with diet containing aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1))
   excrete aflatoxin M-1 (AFM(1)) in milk. The buffalo also excretes small
   amounts of AFB(1). In European Union (EU) the law limit is 0.05 mu g/kg
   (50 ng/kg) of AFM(1) in the milk. During the experimental period, eight
   Mediterranean Italian buffalo cow in lactating were used to study the
   conversion of dietary AFB(1) into AFM(1). The buffaloes were fed
   individually for six days with naturally contaminated corn meal (217 mu
   g AFB(1)/buffalo/day) and for additional three days with a diet free of
   AFB(1). The milk yield by each animal during the test (morning and
   evening milking) was collected and analyzed. The concentration of AFM(1)
   and AFB(1) in milk was determined by HPLC method with fluorimetric
   detection. AFB(1) was determined after derivatization of the extract
   purified with trifluoroacetic acid. The carry over of AFM(1), determined
   during the steady-state phase was 0.190\% (Range 0.123\% - 0.280\%). The
   rate of transfer of AFB(1) from diet to milk was 0.019\% (Range 0.012\%
   - 0.020\%). After 48 hours from the last administration the
   concentration of AFM(1) in milk drops below the law limit (29.86 +/-
   9.77 ng/kg) and after 24 hours falls to 6.65 +/- 2.39 ng/kg.},

Title = {Alpaca semen quality in relation to different diets},
Journal = {REPRODUCTION FERTILITY AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Pages = {683-690},
Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to evaluate the biochemical composition
   of seminal plasma, along with semen quality, of alpacas maintained on
   different diets (hay; hay + pasture grazing; pasture grazing + sheep
   concentrate; pasture grazing + horse concentrate; Periods 1-4,
   respectively). Alpacas (n = 5) were fed the four different diets for a
   period of 6 weeks each. During the period of feeding of each diet, semen
   was collected using an artificial vagina to determine its volume,
   viscosity, sperm concentration and sperm motility. Moreover, testicular
   volume and body condition score were evaluated. Seminal plasma was
   analysed biochemically to measure total protein, triglyceride,
   cholesterol, gamma-glutamyl transferase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
   and alkaline phosphatase levels. Protein profiles were investigated
   using one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
   electrophoresis. There was high variability in semen parameters between
   different males maintained on the same diet. Semen volume increased
   significantly (P < 0.05) when alpacas were fed diets containing
   commercial sheep and horse concentrates. In contrast, sperm
   concentration and motility decreased significantly (P < 0.05) from
   Period 1 to Period 4. Dietary changes had no effect on viscosity.
   Significant reductions were seen in triglyceride and cholesterol
   content, as well as gamma-glutamyl transferase, ALT and alkaline
   phosphatase concentrations, from Period 1 to Period 4. Regardless of
   experimental period, a wide variation was seen in seminal plasma enzyme
   concentrations between alpacas, whereas diet had no effect on glucose
   and total protein concentrations in the seminal plasma. Eight protein
   bands, with molecular weights ranging from 200 to 14 kDa, were
   considered in electrophoresis gel after image analysis. Proteins
   fractions of the 14-kDa (total protein express in md dL(-1) with a
   molecular weight of 14-kDa, TP8) and 21-kDa (total protein express in md
   dL(-1) with a molecular weight of 21-kDa, TP7) bands were not present in
   all samples of alpaca seminal plasma. There were no significant changes
   in the concentration of any protein fractions during the four periods.
   Moreover, the protein fraction of the 60-kDa (total protein express in
   md dL(-1) with a molecular weight of 60-kDa, TP3) band was the most
   prevalent in all periods. These results demonstrate that there are
   marked changes in semen quality, as well as some parameters related to
   the composition of alpaca seminal plasma, that are dependent on diet,
   which may indicate the need for specific diet formulation to improve
   reproductive performance. We hypothesise that, in alpacas, the
   mechanisms underlying the changes in some reproductive traits in
   response to feeding regimens could be related to changes in the
   endocrine-gonadal system.},

Abstract = {African horse sickness (AHS) is a non-contagious viral disease of
   solipeds transmitted by Culicoides. The disease is endemic in most
   African countries. Past experience has shown that Italy is a country
   exposed to emerging infectious diseases endemic to Africa; an incursion
   of AHS virus together with the widespread presence of Culicoides vectors
   could be the cause of a serious epidemic emergency. A live attenuated
   vaccine containing seven of the nine viral serotypes, serotype 5 and 9
   are excluded, is commercially available from Onderstepoort Biological
   Products. However, the use of live vaccines is a matter of endless
   disputes, and therefore inactivated or recombinant alternative products
   have been investigated over the years. Since research on AHS is hampered
   by the use of horses to evaluate vaccine potency, in a previous
   experiment serological response to serotypes 5 and 9 was assayed in
   guinea-pigs and horses. A durable and comparable serological response
   was observed in the two animal species. In the present study antibody
   response in horses and guinea-pigs, immunised with the
   inactivated-adjuvanted vaccine formulated with serotype 9, was tested
   over a period of 12 months. When immunity was challenged, horses were
   protected from infection and disease. Antibody response in horses and
   guinea-pigs compared favourably. Veterinaria Italiana 2013, 49 (1),

Abstract = {A serological investigation of equine infectious anaemia (EIA), equine
   viral arteritis (EAV), glanders, and dourine was conducted on the sera
   of 346 Turkish horses using a combination of tests in series (ELISA and
   agar gel immunodiffusion) for EIA, virus neutralisation for EAV, and
   complement fixation (CF) for glanders and dourine. Forty-nine sera
   showed anticomplementary reactions and were not assessable in the CF
   test for glanders and dourine. No positive samples were detected for
   EIA, dourine, and glanders. Fifty-seven sera were positive for EAV. A
   systematic review of the distribution of these diseases in Turkey was
   conducted to describe their epidemiological status in the country. The
   serological results of this investigation confirm those of the published
   reports for EAV and glanders, whereas different results were reported
   for dourine and EIA. In fact, no previous data were found for dourine.
   Furthermore, all sera tested for EIA in the literature were negative,
   but 3 outbreaks were reported on an international official site in 2005
   without details. Further studies and reports of the outbreaks are needed
   to better understand the real status of infections and the transmission
   of the diseases. The systematic review is a useful tool to improve the
   knowledge of public health disease in a country.},

Abstract = {The bivalve molluscs represent an important matrix to be studied for
   several reasons. Their nutritional properties make them valuable to the
   consumers, so that their consumption and commercial value has risen
   worldwide. Simultaneously, their significant water-filtering capability
   and their persistence in the same place make them good bio-indicators of
   marine ecosystems. The presence of the heavy metal contaminants, as Cd,
   Pb and Hg, was investigated in bivalve molluscs such as mussels (Mytilus
   galloprovincialis), clams (Venus gallina) and oysters (Ostrea edulis).
   In the present study, a survey was carried out on 334 samples addressed
   to the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale Puglia e Basilicata, Foggia
   (ITALY) between 2009-2011, and collected by official authorities along
   the coasts of Apulia Region. The conformity of heavy metal content in
   bivalve molluscs was verified, in according to EC Reg. 1881/2006. The
   compliance was found for the total amount of samples. The obtained data
   on heavy metals concentration in bivalve molluscs were compared with
   data found in monitoring studies on the incidence of heavy metals in
   1981 in North-Western Mediterranean Sea, in 2003 in Tyrrhenian Sea and
   in 2010 in Pacific Ocean (Chile), reported in literature. The
   information obtained from this work offer an essential database, not
   only for the authorities involved in food control, but also for the
   official institutions responsible of a constant control of the marine
   ecosystem pollution.},

Abstract = {Lesions caused by animals, in particular by dogs, are a health issue to
   which public opinion often reacts sensitively. To effectively manage and
   prevent these events, it is therefore essential to evaluate the public
   health impact of this phenomenon and to identify the main connected risk
   factors. The aim of the present survey in the Autonomous Province of
   Bolzano was to collect various epidemiological variables helpful in
   understanding the problem at local level. The incidence and impact on
   Health Services of human lesions by several animal species for the year
   2010 is presented, as well as a more detailed analysis of dog bites,
   giving a profile of the victims and of the animals involved. Different
   factors (geographical, contextual, seasonal and relational) that can be
   associated with episodes where dogs react aggressively to humans are
   illustrated. On the basis of the collected data, recommendations are
   given to prevent risk situations. Veterinaria Italiana 2013, 49 (1),

Title = {Evaluation of the genetic diversity of avian paramyxovirus type 4},
Journal = {VIRUS RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {171},
Number = {1},
Pages = {103-110},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Avian paramyxoviruses (APMVs) belong to the genus Avulavirus in the
   family Paramyxoviridae and include at least nine serotypes, APMV-1 to
   -9, as well as two additional provisional serotypes. Newcastle disease
   virus (NDV), which comprises APMV-1, is the most extensively studied
   APMV because it is an important poultry pathogen. A moderate level of
   antigenic and genetic diversity is recognized for APMV-1 isolates, but
   our knowledge of the antigenic and genetic diversity of the other APMV
   serotypes is limited. APMV-4 is frequently isolated from waterfowl
   around the world. To date complete genome sequences of APMV-4 are
   available for only strains, which were isolated from ducks in Hong Kong,
   Korea and Belgium over a period of 37 years. We have carried out genome
   sequencing from the nucleocapsid (N) gene-end signal to the polymerase
   (L) gene-start signal of five APMV-4 strains recently isolated from
   Italy. Each of the eight APMV-4 strains has the same F protein cleavage
   site, DIQPR down arrow F. They also share a high level of nucleotide and
   amino acid sequence identity: for example, the F and HN glycoproteins
   have greater than 97\% sequence identity between the various strains.
   Thus, comparison of these eight strains of APMV-4 did not provide
   evidence of substantial diversity, in contrast to similar studies with
   APMV-2, -3, and -6, in which the F and HN glycoproteins exhibited up to
   20-30\% amino acid sequence variation within a subgroup. Reciprocal
   cross-HI assay using post infection chicken sera also failed to detect
   significant antigenic variation among the available APMV-4 strains.

Title = {Expression of 8-OHdG in Zosterisessor ophiocephalus from the Venetian
   lagoon, Italy},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HISTOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {57},
Number = {1},
Pages = {46-53},
Abstract = {The aim of the present work was to evaluate the expression of 8-OHdG
   (8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine) in the benthic fish Zosterisessor
   ophiocephalus collected in two differently polluted sites of the
   Venetian lagoon (Porto Marghera and Caroman). We compared our data on
   8-OHdG with those of CYP1A (Cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A,
   polypeptide 1), which is a well known biomarker for detoxification of
   contaminants. Immunohistochemistry with an antibody to 8-OHdG showed
   immunopositivity in nuclei of hepatocytes as well as in melanomacrophage
   centres of spleen and kidney, whereas an antiCYP1A antibody exhibited
   positive immunostaining in the liver, kidney and ovary. The liver of
   males showed higher expression of both proteins than females. In animals
   from Porto Marghera site, the enzymatic assay for 8-OHdG exhibited
   higher levels in liver of males than in females. Western Blot analysis
   using the antibody anti-CYP1A recognized the presence of a band of about
   60 kDa in the liver of males and females. Males exhibited a strong band,
   whereas in females the band showed a lower intensity. By using Real-Time
   PCR, the mRNA expression of CYP1A did not show any differences between
   males and females from each site, but it was at borderline significance
   level. Comparing the two sites, mRNA expression of CYP1A was
   significantly higher in the liver of both males and females from Porto
   Marghera than that of Caroman. The present data suggest that pollutants
   are bio-available as demonstrated by our biomarker analyses and may have
   a harmful effect on aquatic organisms such as Z. ophiocephalus. We
   report that the highest levels of hepatic 8-OHdG and CYP1A expression
   were detected in males, showing clear gender specificity.},

   Pathogen Arcobacter butzleri: Preliminary Data for Risk Assessment},
Journal = {BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {2013},
Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate, at a laboratory scale, the
   ability of this microorganism to grow in seawater and bioaccumulate in
   mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) maintained in constantly aerated
   tanks, containing twenty litres of artificial seawater. Three
   concentrations of A. butzleri LMG 10828(T) were tested (about 5 x 10(6)
   CFU/mL, 5 x 10(4) CFU/mL, and 5 x 10(2) CFU/mL). Following
   contamination, enumeration of A. butzleri was performed from water and
   mussels each day, for up to 96 h. Three contamination experiments with
   artificial seawater in absence of mussels were also performed in the
   same manner. In the experiments with mussels, A. butzleri declined in
   water of approximately 1 log every 24 h from the contamination. In
   artificial seawater without mussels the concentration of A. butzleri
   remained on the same logarithmic level in the first 48 h and then
   decreased of about 1 log every 24 hours. In mussels, the concentration
   was approximately 2 log lower than the exposition level after 24 h from
   the contamination, and then it decreased exponentially of 1 log every 24
   h. Our findings suggest that in the experimental conditions tested A.
   butzleri is neither able to effectively grow in seawater nor
   bioaccumulate in mussels, at least in the free and cultivable form.},

Abstract = {In the present work a sensitive and accurate method by ion
   chromatography and conductimetric detection has been developed for the
   determination of biogenic amines in food samples at microgram per
   kilogram levels. The optimized extraction procedure of trimethylamine,
   triethylamine, putrescine, cadaverine, histamine, agmatine, spermidine,
   and spermine from real samples, as well as the separation conditions
   based on a multilinear gradient elution with methanesulfonic acid and
   the use of a weak ionic exchange column, have provided excellent results
   in terms of resolution and separation efficiency. Extended calibration
   curves (up to 200 mg/kg, r > 0.9995) were obtained for all the analyzed
   compounds. The method gave detection limits in the range 23-65 mu g/kg
   and quantification limits in spiked blank real samples in the range
   65-198 mu g/kg. Recovery values ranged from 82 to 103 \%, and for all
   amines, a good repeatability was obtained with precision levels in the
   range 0.03-0.32 \% (n = 4). The feasibility and potential of the method
   were tested by the analysis of real samples, such as tinned tuna fish,
   anchovies, cheese, wine, olives, and salami.},

Abstract = {We report the detection of Listeria spp. and Listeria monocytogenes in
   34 dairy plants. In total, 547 of food, product contact surface and
   floor drain samples were collected along the product lines. Nineteen
   cheese factories (55.8\%) were contaminated by Listeria spp. Of these
   20.6\% were L. monocytogenes positive. Listeria spp. was found in 6.8\%
   of food samples, 11.3\% of product contact surfaces and 40.6\% of floor
   drains. L. monocytogenes was found in 2.4\% of food samples, 4.9\% of
   product contact surfaces and 18.8\% of floor drains. Twentyfive L.
   monocytogenes isolates were serotyped using commercial specific antisera
   and genotyped using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP)
   analysis. AFLP genotyping discriminated the four species of Listeria
   isolated and different genotypes for each species, moreover it could
   identify persistent genotypes in some dairy facilities. Listeria spp.
   and L monocytogenes are widely spread in the dairy sector and probably
   contaminate foods during the production process. Facility-based
   monitoring can identify possible routes of transmission and thus allow
   establishment of more effective strategies to prevent food
   contamination. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Peptides Trapping Dioxins: A Docking-Based Inverse Screening Approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {2013},
Abstract = {A rapid and cost-effective computational methodology for designing and
   rationalizing the selection of small peptides as receptors for
   dioxin-like compounds was proposed. The backbone of the dioxin Ah
   receptor binding site was used to design a series of penta- and
   hexapeptide libraries, with 1400 elements in total. Peptide flexibility
   was considered and 10 conformers were found to be a good option to
   represent peptide conformational space with fair speed-accuracy ratio.
   Each peptide conformer was treated as a possible receptor, generating a
   dedicated box and then running a docking process using as ligands a
   family of 76 dibenzo-p-dioxins and 113 dibenzofurans mono-and
   polychlorinated. Significant predictions were confirmed by comparing
   primary structure of top and bottom ranked peptides binding dioxins
   confirming that scrambled positions of the same amino acids gave
   completely different predicted binding. The hexapeptide EWFQPW, with the
   best binding score, was chosen as selective sorbent material in
   solid-phase extraction. The retention performances were tested using the
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and two polychlorinated biphenyls in
   order to verify the hexapeptide specificity. The solid-phase extraction
   experimental procedure was optimized, and analytical parameters of
   hexapeptide sorbent material were compared with the resin without
   hexapeptide and a commercial reversed phase cartridge.},

Abstract = {The near-infrared microscope (NIRM) is an instrument that has
   demonstrated its great ability to detect contaminants not by analyzing a
   single spectrum but rather by analyzing hundreds or thousands of spectra
   from individual particles, while at the same time being a
   non-destructive and easy-to-use technique. It has been used for the
   detection of meat-and-bone meal (MBM) in compound feeds within the
   context of the European bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE; commonly
   known as ``mad cow disease{''}) crisis. This study describes, for the
   first time, an application of NIRM instrument standardization using a
   measurement cell in an inter-laboratory study conducted within the
   framework of a qualitative determination of animal proteins in compound
   feeds, based on spectra obtained with eight instruments. The
   standardization cell was assessed for its ability to produce good
   optical matching of the instruments and/or to evaluate instrument
   performance.},

Title = {Characterization of size and composition of milk fat globules from Sarda

Volume = {109},

Abstract = {The small size of goat milk fat globules (MFGs) is one of the factors
   contributing to the higher digestibility of goat milk compared to other
   milks. In this study, size, protein composition and lipid distribution
   of MFGs were evaluated comparatively in a popular dairy breed, Saanen,
   and in a minor breed, Sarda. MFGs were found to be significantly smaller
   in Sarda compared to Saanen goats, with average diameters of 2.73 +/-
   0.15 mu m and 3.63 +/- 0.27 mu m, respectively. Raman spectroscopy
   revealed differences in the lipid profiles of differently sized MFGs
   within each breed, with MFGs of the same size class having comparable
   profiles between breeds. Proteomic characterization by SDS-PAGE followed
   by tandem mass spectrometry (GeLC-MS/MS) and label-free differential
   quantification highlighted significant differences in expression levels
   of MFG proteins from the two breeds, with a higher abundance of
   cytoplasmic proteins in Sarda MFGs and of membrane proteins in Saanen
   MFGs. Moreover, differences in the relative abundance of several major
   MFG proteins were observed for the two breeds. In conclusion, this study
   demonstrates the existence of breed-dependent differences in the lipid
   and protein makeup of goat MFGs, likely related to their different size
   distribution. This highlights once again the importance of investigating
   bio-diversity in autochthonous and neglected breeds, which often possess
   valuable attributes that might be lost as a consequence of the
   widespread diffusion of highly productive, but more homogeneous, dairy
   breeds. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The present work describes the first Italian koi herpes virus (KHV)
   outbreak where the infectious agent was isolated and genetically
   characterized. At the beginning of April 2012, a batch of koi (Cyprinus
   carpio koi) was imported from Israel by a wholesale facility located in
   North-Eastern Italy. Fish, originating from different farms, were
   shipped separately but maintained together in the same tank upon
   arrival. Three weeks after the introduction of fish, an increased
   mortality was recorded. Typical clinical and pathological signs of koi
   herpesvirus disease (KHVD) were observed: enophthalmia, skin erosion,
   gill hemorrhages and necrosis, pale and enlarged kidney. The
   histological analysis of symptomatic koi allowed the detection of
   typical pale intranuclear inclusions in gill epithelium, intestinal
   lamina propria and kidney. Viral isolation yielded positive results and
   KHV isolation was confirmed by immunofluorescence. Conventional and real
   time PCR substantiated the presence of Cyprinid Herpesvirus type 3
   (CyHV-3) belonging to the U/I lineage. Mortality in the koi tank reached
   82.5\% and the few surviving fish were culled by the Official Veterinary
   Inspector. Epidemiological data and laboratory results suggested that
   the virus likely originated from Israel.},

Abstract = {Overstrain tendonitis are common pathologies in the sport horses.
   Therapeutic approaches to tendon healing do not always result in a
   satisfactory anatomical and functional repair, and healed tendon is
   often characterized by functional impairment and high risk of reinjury.
   Recently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and platelet rich plasma (PRP)
   have been proposed as novel therapeutic treatments to improve the tendon
   repair process. MSCs are multipotent, easy to culture and being
   originated from adult donors do not pose ethical issues. To date,
   autologous MSCs have been investigated mainly in the treatment of large
   bone defects, cardiovascular diseases, osteogenesis imperfecta and
   orthopaedic injuries both in human and veterinary medicine. The clinical
   applications in which autologous MSCs can be used are limited because
   patient-specific tissue collection and cell expansion require time. For
   clinical applications in which MSCs should be used right away, it would
   be more practical to use cells collected from a donor, expanded in vitro
   and banked to be readily available when needed. However, there are
   concerns over the safety and the efficacy of allogeneic MSCs. The safety
   and efficacy of a therapy based on the use of allogeneic adipose
   tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) associated to platelet rich
   plasma (PRP) were evaluated in 19 horses affected by acute or subacute
   overstrain superficial digital flexor tendonitis (SDFT). The application
   of allogeneic ASCs neither raised clinical sign of acute or chronic
   adverse tissue reactions, nor the formation of abnormal tissue in the
   long term. After a follow-up of 24 months, 89.5\% horses returned to
   their previous level of competition, while the reinjury rate was 10.5\%,
   comparable to those recently reported for SDFT treated with autologous
   bone marrow derived MSCs. This study suggests that the association
   between allogeneic ASCs and PRP can be considered a safe and effective
   strategy for the treatment of SDF tendonitis in the horse.},

Title = {Unraveling the transcriptional regulatory networks associated to
   mycobacterial cell wall defective form induction by glycine and lysozyme
   treatment},
Journal = {MICROBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {168},

Pages = {153-164},
Abstract = {It is known that a combined glycine/lysozyme treatment is able to induce
   in vitro the mycobacterial conversion from the bacillary to the cell
   wall defective forms. These forms also naturally occur in vivo as a
   response to various antimicrobial factors such as lysozyme released by
   phagocytic cells. Although they have been successfully isolated from
   patients with several chronic diseases, their role in pathogenesis is
   still unknown, mainly due to the difficulties in handling the in vivo
   isolated variants. Moreover, nothing is known about the transcriptional
   peculiarities that may exist in comparison to the vegetative phase.
   Hence, in this study, we simulated in vitro the induction of the
   mycobacterial cell wall defective state by using a glycine and
   lysozyme-based treatment in order to identify the gene expression
   profiles of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic mycobacteria.
   DNA-microarray results showed that in contrast to the non-pathogenic
   Mycobacterium smegmatis species, glycine and lysozyme treated forms of
   Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium subspecies
   paratuberculosis regulated a repertoire of genes usually expressed in
   vivo during adaptation and persistence within host environments. Results
   suggest that the cell wall defective state may represent an important
   stage in the life-cycle of pathogenic mycobacteria that potentially
   coordinates persistence. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier GmbH.},

Abstract = {Control of tubercolosis (TB) in buffaloes is currently based on
   slaughter of animals deemed positive on the basis of tubercolin testing.
   This test presents some disadvantages such as the need of holding
   animals for 72 h and some difficulties depending on the interpretation
   and the site of the PPD inoculation. Therefore, the purpose of this
   preliminary study was to evaluate the use of the gamma-Interferon
   (gamma-IFN) assay as a confirmatory test under field condition in South
   of Italy. Animals from herds of known tubercolosis-positive status and
   from herds of known tubercolosis-negative status were tested in the last
   three years using the Intradermal Cervical Tuberculin Test (ICTT) and
   both the Prionics and IDVET gamma-IFN test. Different antigens (PPDS,
   ESAT-6, CFP10) were used in the vitro stimulation of blood lymphocytes
   of TB positive and negative animals to evaluate which reagent give the
   best results. The samples related to animals from herd TB free were
   negative for ICTT and for stimulation with recombinant proteins, while
   two samples reacted positively after stimulation with bovine PPD,
   demonstrating the specificity of improvement through the use of
   recombinant antigens. The results obtained in positive herds over the
   years demonstrate the ability of the gamma -IFN test to make early TB
   diagnosis compared to ICTT. The comparison between results of Prionics
   and IDVET tests performed on samples from infected herds, show a good
   correlation between the two kits.},

Journal = {AMB EXPRESS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {The present study aims to investigate coelomocytes, immune mediators
   cells in the echinoderm Holothuria tubulosa, as an unusual source of
   antimicrobial and antibiofilm agents. The activity of the 5kDa peptide
   fraction of the cytosol from H. tubulosa coelomocytes (5-HCC) was tested
   against a reference group of Gram-negative and Gram-positive human
   pathogens. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 125 to
   500 mg/ml were determined against tested strains. The observed
   biological activity of 5-HCC could be due to two novel peptides,
   identified by capillary RP-HPLC/nESI-MS/MS, which present the common
   chemical-physical characteristics of antimicrobial peptides. Such
   peptides were chemically synthesized and their antimicrobial activity
   was tested. The synthetic peptides showed broad-spectrum activity at
   12.5 mg/ml against the majority of the tested Gram-positive and
   Gram-negative strains, and they were also able to inhibit biofilm
   formation in a significant percentage at a concentration of 3.1 mg/ml
   against staphylococcal and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains.
   The immune mediators in H. tubulosa are a source of novel antimicrobial
   peptides for the development of new agents against biofilm bacterial
   communities that are often intrinsically resistant to conventional
   antibiotics.},

Abstract = {Coinfection of a cell by two different strains of a segmented virus can
   give rise to a ``reassortant{''} with phenotypic characteristics that
   might differ from those of the parental strains. Bluetongue virus (BTV)
   is a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) segmented virus and the cause of
   bluetongue, a major infectious disease of livestock. BTV exists as at
   least 26 different serotypes (BTV-1 to BTV-26). Prompted by the
   isolation of a field reassortant between BTV-1 and BTV-8, we
   systematically characterized the process of BTV reassortment. Using a
   reverse genetics approach, our study clearly indicates that any BTV-1 or
   BTV-8 genome segment can be rescued in the heterologous ``backbone.{''}
   To assess phenotypic variation as a result of reassortment, we examined
   viral growth kinetics and plaque sizes in in vitro experiments and
   virulence in an experimental mouse model of bluetongue disease. The
   monoreassortants generated had phenotypes that were very similar to
   those of the parental wild-type strains both in vitro and in vivo. Using
   a forward genetics approach in cells coinfected with BTV-1 and BTV-8, we
   have shown that reassortants between BTV-1 and BTV-8 are generated very
   readily. After only four passages in cell culture, we could not detect
   wild-type BTV-1 or BTV-8 in any of 140 isolated viral plaques. In
   addition, most of the isolated reassortants contained heterologous VP2
   and VP5 structural proteins, while only 17\% had homologous VP2 and VP5
   proteins. Our study has shown that reassortment in BTV is very flexible,
   and there is no fundamental barrier to the reassortment of any genome
   segment. Given the propensity of BTV to reassort, it is increasingly
   important to have an alternative classification system for orbiviruses.},

Abstract = {The accumulation of heavy metals in freshwaters has direct consequences
   to man and ecosystem. Thus, in this study, the concentrations of
   mercury, cadmium, lead, arsenic and chromium in organs of the predator
   European catfish (Silurus glanis) were investigated. Samples were
   collected annually in five sites covering the area of the Po River
   (North Italy) between 2007 and 2009.
   Metals were differently distributed in the various organs, the highest
   concentrations of Hg were found in muscle and liver. Cd in kidney, Pb in
   gill and liver, as in muscle, and of Cr in gill and liver. Our survey
   found Hg exceeding the Maximum Levels (MLs) of 0.5 ppm in 18\% of
   samples, while Pb and Cd were lower than the MLs set by European
   regulations in muscle tissues (1881/2006/EC and 629/2008/EC). Hg
   concentrations were significantly related to sampling stations studied,
   according to the presence of many industrial activities in the catchment
   area of Bormida and Tanaro Rivers. The finding that Hg did not fit food
   fish legislation limits indicated that S. glanis flesh might not be
   utilised for human consumption, A close monitoring of metals pollution
   is strongly recommended especially in piscivorous fish, cause their

Abstract = {In the last years the use of serious games has become relevant for
   education and learning, by allowing learners to acquire new skills and
   competences in an engaging, interactive environment. It is argued that
   the multi-sensory environment offered by virtual gaming worlds promote
   the development of multiple learning styles. These games can contribute
   to improve higher order cognitive ability such as critical thinking,
   problem-solving, decision-making and collaborative social skills. Some
   empirical evidence shows that games can be effective tools for enhancing
   learning and understanding of complex subject matter. Many games have
   been developed specifically to teach health-related content and to
   positively modify health-related behaviours. In particular, they have
   been realized in hygiene field, public safety, healthy eating, AIDS
   education, obesity prevention, and diabetes treatment, but less in the
   field of food safety. In Italy the increasing sale and consumption of
   raw milk are posing many health problems. Since 2004, raw milk
   consumption was found to be responsible of several out breaks of
   verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC). Furthermore serious
   cases of Haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS) were reported in particular
   among children, one of these had a fatal outcome in 2010. Ad hoc
   regulations were promoted by the Italian authorities to inform consumers
   on correct practices for raw milk consumption. However, in 2012, the
   Italian Ministry of Health underlines the need of implementing
   communication initiatives to improve consumers' awareness, since the
   practice to drink raw milk without boiling it first still raised a
   severe health problem.
   A project involving 807 Italian students (16 - 17 years old) was
   designed by the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie,
   with the aim to inform young consumers on this issue. Starting from the
   analysis of adolescents' food habits, behaviours and knowledge towards
   milk and especially raw milk, an online videogame was realized to
   communicate microbiological risks to the students. In the game, called
   ``A mysterious poisoning{''}, students help a detective to find out the
   cause of a food poisoning outbreak. Analysing all steps of the milk
   supply chain players learn the main crucial moments when milk can be
   contaminated and discover good practices to manage milk safely. In this
   way they can test their knowledge and, at the same time, they receive
   new information on selected topics. The efficacy of the tool was
   evaluated through two structured questionnaires administered to the
   students before and after the interaction with the game. Data collected
   before playing showed the need to enhance risk communication
   intervention aimed at guarantee consumer protection. After playing the
   game, students' knowledge about the risks associated with the
   consumption of raw milk increased as well as the perception of their
   exposure to food risks. However data revealed a low level of awareness
   about practices regarding safe milk storage and correct handling at
   home. Moreover, the evaluation of critical aspects of the online
   videogame provided useful information for the implementation of
   education strategies oriented to disseminate food risk knowledge to

Title = {Efficacy test of a hydrolysable tannin extract against necrotic
   enteritis in challenged broiler chickens},
Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},

Number = {3},
Abstract = {A hydrolysable tannin extracted from chestnut (SaviotaN (R)) was tested
   for efficacy in controlling the proliferation of Clostridium perfringens
   in the gut of broiler chickens challenged via oral gavage first with
   coccidia (Eimeria tenella, Eimeria acervulina, Eimeria maxima) at the
   age of 10 days, and then with Clostridium perfringens at the age of 15
   days. We randomly allocated 150 broiler chickens within 5 poultry
   isolators (30 birds each). Dietary treatments consisted of a basal diet
   (C) composed of corn {[}575 g/kg on dry matter (DM)] and soybean meal
   (100 g/kg DM), barley bran (220 g/kg DM), corn gluten feed (30 g/kg DM),
   soybean oil (25 g/kg DM), vitamin mineral premix (49.5 g/kg DM), and
   four other diets obtained by adding chestnut tannin extract (1.5, 3, 5,
   and 12 g/kg during week 1, 10.0 g/kg during week 2, and 8.0 g/kg during
   the last two weeks, respectively) to C. At the age of 20 days, 15
   birds/group were euthanised and individually examined for the level of
   gut infection by counting Clostridium perfringens and macroscopic gut
   lesions. Results demonstrated that chestnut tannin gave significant
   results even at low concentration levels in the feed (1.5 to 3.0 g/kg),
   but was actually efficient in controlling necrotic enteritis at levels
   >= 5.0 g/kg. The treatment (12.0 g/kg during the first week and 8.0 g/kg
   during the last two weeks of age) resulted very efficient in controlling
   the proliferation of Clostridium perfringens and in reducing the
   severity of gut damage compared to the untreated infected group.},

Abstract = {Background: The effect of acute lung injury on adhesion molecule
   expression in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) is poorly
   understood. Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine whether
   there is a relationship between pulmonary inflammation, expression of
   VLA-4 (CD49d), LFA-1 (CD11a), L-selectin (CD62L), CXCR4, and chemotaxis
   in resident HSPCs, as well as the level of circulating HSPCs. Methods:
   Following intratracheal administration of a single LPS bolus in C57Bl/6
   mice, the number of inflammatory cells, differential counts, and amounts
   of cytokines/chemokines were studied in cytospins and bronchoalveolar
   lavage fluid (BALF) specimens. Expressions of adhesion molecules and
   CXCR4 were analyzed in HSPCs by flow cytometry, as well as
   SDF-1-directed chemotaxis. Levels of HSPCs in the blood were studied in
   ungated and circulating subpopulations. Results: In coincidence with a
   peak of airway neutrophils, cytokine (IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha,and IL-6),
   chemokine (KC, MIP-2, and SDF-1) levels in BALF and the number of marrow
   HSPCs expressing CD49d and CXCR4 significantly increased at 48 h. The
   number of CD49d- and CXCR4-positive HSPCs dropped at 72 h. The HSPC
   subset comprising bigger cells behaved the same for CD49d. Chemotaxis of
   the marrow HSPC subset of bigger cells was higher in LPS-treated animals
   than in controls at 72 h. Finally, we could detect a significant
   decrease in circulating Sca-1(+) cells in the mononuclear population at
   72 h in LPS-treated mice. Conclusions: Our data provide evidence for a
   temporal relationship between pulmonary inflammation, CD49d and CXCR4
   expression fluctuation in resident HSPCs, and the level of circulating
   HSPCs. Copyright (C) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {This chapter addresses survey methodology and questionnaire design for
   the collection of data pertaining to estimation of honey bee colony loss
   rates and identification of risk factors for colony loss. Sources of
   error in surveys are described. Advantages and disadvantages of
   different random and non-random sampling strategies and different modes
   of data collection are presented to enable the researcher to make an
   informed choice. We discuss survey and questionnaire methodology in some
   detail, for the purpose of raising awareness of issues to be considered
   during the survey design stage in order to minimise error and bias in
   the results. Aspects of survey design are illustrated using surveys in
   Scotland. Part of a standardized questionnaire is given as a further
   example, developed by the COLOSS working group for Monitoring and
   Diagnosis. Approaches to data analysis are described, focussing on
   estimation of loss rates. Dutch monitoring data from 2012 were used for
   an example of a statistical analysis with the public domain R software.
   We demonstrate the estimation of the overall proportion of losses and
   corresponding confidence interval using a quasi-binomial model to
   account for extra-binomial variation. We also illustrate generalized
   linear model fitting when incorporating a single risk factor, and
   derivation of relevant confidence intervals.},

Title = {Schmallenberg Virus Pathogenesis, Tropism and Interaction with the

Journal = {PLOS PATHOGENS},
Year = {2013},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Schmallenberg virus (SBV) is an emerging orthobunyavirus of ruminants
   associated with outbreaks of congenital malformations in aborted and
   stillborn animals. Since its discovery in November 2011, SBV has spread
   very rapidly to many European countries. Here, we developed molecular
   and serological tools, and an experimental in vivo model as a platform
   to study SBV pathogenesis, tropism and virus-host cell interactions.
   Using a synthetic biology approach, we developed a reverse genetics
   system for the rapid rescue and genetic manipulation of SBV. We showed
   that SBV has a wide tropism in cell culture and ``synthetic{''} SBV
   replicates in vitro as efficiently as wild type virus. We developed an
   experimental mouse model to study SBV infection and showed that this
   virus replicates abundantly in neurons where it causes cerebral malacia
   and vacuolation of the cerebral cortex. These virus-induced acute
   lesions are useful in understanding the progression from vacuolation to
   porencephaly and extensive tissue destruction, often observed in aborted
   lambs and calves in naturally occurring Schmallenberg cases. Indeed, we
   detected high levels of SBV antigens in the neurons of the gray matter
   of brain and spinal cord of naturally affected lambs and calves,
   suggesting that muscular hypoplasia observed in SBV-infected lambs is
   mostly secondary to central nervous system damage. Finally, we
   investigated the molecular determinants of SBV virulence. Interestingly,
   we found a biological SBV clone that after passage in cell culture
   displays increased virulence in mice. We also found that a SBV deletion
   mutant of the non-structural NSs protein (SBV Delta NSs) is less
   virulent in mice than wild type SBV. Attenuation of SBV virulence
   depends on the inability of SBV Delta NSs to block IFN synthesis in
   virus infected cells. In conclusion, this work provides a useful
   experimental framework to study the biology and pathogenesis of SBV.},

Abstract = {The expression of Ki67, BCL-2, and COX-2 was investigated in 53 canine
   cutaneous mast cell tumors (MCTs) by immunohistochemistry and
   quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to evaluate
   their prognostic significance and the association with the histologic
   grading and the mitotic index (MI). MCTs were graded according to the
   Patnaik grading system and the novel 2-tier grading system proposed by
   Kiupel. The numbers of mitotic figures/10 high-power fields (MI) were
   counted. Both grading systems were significantly associated with
   prognosis. The Patnaik grading was of limited prognostic value for grade
   2 MCTs, with 23\% being associated with mortality. The concordance among
   pathologists was strongly improved by the application of the 2-tier
   grading system, and 71\% of high-grade MCTs were associated with a high
   mortality rate. MI and Ki67 protein expression were significantly
   associated with grading and survival. No significant association between
   BCL-2 protein expression and either grading system or health status was
   observed. BCL-2 mRNA expression was significantly higher in grade 2 than
   in grade 1 MCTs, while no statistically significant differences were
   detected between low- and high-grade MCTs. The increased BCL-2 mRNA
   level was significantly associated with increased mortality rate. The
   COX-2 protein expression was detected in 78\% of the MCTs investigated.
   However, neither association with the tumor grade nor with the health
   status was observed. COX-2 mRNA was significantly up-regulated in MCTs
   compared to surgical margins and control skin tissue, but it was neither
   associated with tumor grade nor with survival.},

Title = {Detection of yessotoxin by three different methods in Mytilus

Abstract = {Samples of Mytilus galloprovincialis collected from shellfish
   aquaculture plans located in the Adriatic Sea were analysed for
   yessotoxin (YTX) by three methods, in vivo (Mouse Bioassay, MBA), in
   vitro (functional assay) and chemical test (Liquid Chromatography-Mass
   Spectrometry, LC-MS/MS). As YTX coexists with other phycotoxins in
   shellfish, namely the diarrhoetic shellfish poisoning, okadaic acid,
   dinophysistoxins, pectenotoxins, and azaspirazids, the MBA is not
   completely satisfactory because it is difficult to identify which toxin
   causes the death of the mice. So, the two other techniques were proposed
   to detect and quantify YTX and its analogues in order to avoid this
   problem. The global results showed no difference among the three methods
   and the correlation between the functional assay and LC-MS/MS was
   positive (Spearman r = 0.72). Both analytical methods demonstrated
   advantages; the functional assay is specific, very sensitive and
   correlates well with real toxicity, whereas LC-MS/MS is convenient
   because it allows the detection of YTX and some analogues which are
   currently included in the EU regulation. For this reason LC-MS/MS will
   become the official method starting 1st January 2015 (Regulation
   15/2011/EU). Only four samples exceeded the current EU regulation limit
   of 1 mg of YTX equivalent kg(-1). However, all samples belonged to a
   monitoring program and they were not suitable for consumers. (C) 2012

Title = {Helminth Communities of Owls (Strigiformes) Indicate Strong Biological
   and Ecological Differences from Birds of Prey (Accipitriformes and
   Falconiformes) in Southern Italy},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},

Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {We compared the helminth communities of 5 owl species from Calabria
   (Italy) and evaluated the effect of phylogenetic and ecological factors
   on community structure. Two host taxonomic scales were considered, i.e.,
   owl species, and owls vs. birds of prey. The latter scale was dealt with
   by comparing the data here obtained with that of birds of prey from the
   same locality and with those published previously on owls and birds of
   prey from Galicia (Spain). A total of 19 helminth taxa were found in
   owls from Calabria. Statistical comparison showed only marginal
   differences between scops owls (Otus scops) and little owls (Athene
   noctua) and tawny owls (Strix aluco). It would indicate that all owl
   species are exposed to a common pool of `owl generalist' helminth taxa,
   with quantitative differences being determined by differences in diet
   within a range of prey relatively narrow. In contrast, birds of prey
   from the same region exhibited strong differences because they feed on
   different and wider spectra of prey. In Calabria, owls can be separated
   as a whole from birds of prey with regard to the structure of their
   helminth communities while in Galicia helminths of owls represent a
   subset of those of birds of prey. This difference is related to the
   occurrence in Calabria, but not Galicia, of a pool of `owl specialist'
   species. The wide geographical occurrence of these taxa suggest that
   local conditions may determine fundamental differences in the
   composition of local communities. Finally, in both Calabria and Galicia,
   helminth communities from owls were species-poor compared to those from
   sympatric birds of prey. However, birds of prey appear to share a
   greater pool of specific helmith taxa derived from cospeciation
   processes, and a greater potential exchange of parasites between them
   than with owls because of phylogenetic closeness.},

Abstract = {The present study aimed to obtain data on the occurrence of Giardia
   duodenalis in calves in four major cattle rearing countries in Europe
   (Germany, UK, France and Italy), along with genotyping data and risk
   factors associated with these infections. A total of 2072 calves were
   sampled on 207 farms. The majority of the animals were Holstein dairy or
   mixed Holstein calves (n = 1565 or 75.5\%), and were female (n = 1640 or
   79.1\%). The average age was 7.8 weeks (SD = 4.1; median = 7; range =
   2-16 weeks). All fecal samples were tested using a commercially
   available monoclonal antibody-based ELISA. The overall apparent
   prevalence of G. duodenalis for the four countries was 45.4\% (n =
   942/2072) and the overall farm prevalence was 89.9\% (186/207), with
   differences in both animal and farm prevalence between the four
   countries. The prevalence was significantly higher in animals up to 8
   weeks (OR=1.88; P<0.001) compared to older calves, and several
   management factors including contact with the Dam, Frequency of cleaning
   of the Maternity Pens, and Disinfection of the Calf Housing were found
   to be associated with infection. Positive samples were withheld for
   genotyping using the beta-giardin and triose phosphate isomerase gene:
   G. duodenalis assemblage E was most prevalent, although 43\% of the
   isolates were typed as assemblage A, with differences in between
   countries. Furthermore, 32\% of the examined samples was found to be a
   mixed assemblage A and E infection, which is consistent with previous
   reports. The results of the present study confirm previous findings in
   other European countries that G. duodenalis infections are common in
   calves. The infection especially occurs in animals younger than 2
   months, and the proportion of positive animals gradually decreased with
   increasing age. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {An evaluation of the capability of existing and novel serodiagnostic
   methods for porcine brucellosis to reduce false positive serological

Abstract = {Porcine brucellosis is a zoonotic disease of truly global significance
   because even in countries without the disease the occurrence of false
   positive serological reactions (FPSRs) creates significant problems.
   Statutory diagnostic testing is required in many disease free countries
   or regions and is often a prerequisite for the movement of live animals.
   Currently this testing is dependent almost entirely on serological
   assays and these may result in a significant number of FPSRs. The aim of
   this study was to examine existing and novel serodiagnostic assays to
   evaluate their diagnostic sensitivity and resilience to FPSRs. The
   existing assays evaluated were the RBT, smooth lipopolysaccharide (sLPS)
   indirect (i) ELISA, sLPS competitive (c) ELISA, and the FPA. The novel
   assays evaluated were the sLPS TR-FRET assay, a rough (r)LPS iELISA, a
   recombinant protein BP26 iELISA and a cytoplasmic protein extract
   (Brucellergene(TM)) iELISA. Four populations of sera were evaluated:
   those from Brucella suis infected swine (n = 34), randomly selected
   samples from non-infected swine (n = 161), sera from non-infected swine
   within herds exhibiting FPSRs (n = 132) and sera from swine
   experimentally infected with Yersinia enterocolitica 0:9 (n = 4). The
   results show that all the assays dependent on the sLPS O-polysaccharide
   (OPS) for their sensitivity (the RBT, sLPS ELISAs, FPA and the sLPS
   TR-FRET) had significantly reduced diagnostic specificity when applied
   to the FPSR population, the RBT being most affected. Of the two rapid
   homogeneous assays, the TR-FRET was diagnostically superior to the FPA
   in this study. Neither of the protein based iELISAs demonstrated
   sufficient diagnostic sensitivity to resolve the FPSRs. The rLPS iELISA
   showed no cross reaction with the FPSRs and had diagnostic sensitivity
   similar to that of the OPS based assays. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The present study represents a survey of the infectious aetiological
   agents responsible for gastroenteritis in water buffalo calves within
   the first month of life. The faeces from 248 diarrhoeic calves were
   investigated for the presence of the pathogens E. coli, Salmonella spp.,
   Clostridium perfringens, Rotavirus, Coronavirus, Cryptosporidium spp.,
   Giardia spp. and Eimeria spp. C. perfringens resulted the most frequent
   (28\%) pathogen. Pathogenic E. coli, Salmonella spp. and Cryptosporidium
   spp. were isolated in the 23\%, 20\% and 17\% of cases, respectively.
   Rotavirus, Coronavirus, Eimeria spp. and Giardia spp. were detected in
   the 7\%, 4\%, 4\% and 3\% of cases, respectively. The E. coli strains
   were characterized for the presence of the main virulence factors (1t,
   st, stx1, stx2, eae, cdt, cnf, F17) and for haemolytic activity. The
   strains were therefore classified as ETEC (2\%), STEC (7\%) and NTEC
   (21\%). The serotyping of the Salmonella spp. isolates displayed an
   elevated number of S. enterica subspecies, mainly Typhimurium (26\%),
   Muenster (10\%) and Give (10\%). The 13 S. Typhimurium isolates were
   characterized for phage susceptibility and exhibited 9 different phage
   types. The isolates of C. perfringens were characterized for the
   presence of genes coding for the major toxins (alpha, beta, beta2, iota,
   epsilon and enterotoxin E). The 81\% of the strains was positive to the
   gene coding for toxin alpha, 12\% of the isolates were positive to both
   toxin alpha and toxin beta 2, 3\% of the isolates were positive to toxin
   alpha, toxin beta 2 and enterotoxin E. The E. coli and Salmonella
   isolates were further characterized for the resistance to 16
   antibiotics, and exhibited high levels of multi-resistance. The results
   reported in this study confirm the wide and variegated presence of
   aetiological agents in water buffalo calves affected by gastroenteritis
   and underline the broad presence of antibiotic-resistance.},

Abstract = {In the Veneto region (northern Italy), some geographic areas in the Po
   Valley have a large concentration of industrial poultry farms and are
   located close to wet areas with high populations of wild waterfowl. Live
   decoy birds belonging to the orders of Anseriformes and Charadriiformes
   can constitute a ``bridge{''} for avian influenza (AI) viruses between
   the wild reservoir and the rural holdings where live decoy birds are
   usually kept, sometimes together with poultry. Thus, the use of live
   decoy birds during bird hunting could increase the risk of exposure of
   poultry farms to AI viruses. Since 2008, this kind of hunting has been
   strictly regulated with regard to the detection and use of live decoy
   birds. In order to guarantee the application of appropriate AI
   risk-modulating and monitoring measures in the management of the live
   decoys according to the European Union (EU) provisions, a solid and
   well-structured information system has been created. The Regional Data
   Bank (RDB) of farms and livestock, which has been operating since 1997,
   also contains data on farms and poultry movements. Therefore, the RDB
   management software was updated to collect data from the hunters who
   keep live decoy birds, and specific functions were integrated to ensure
   the traceability of these birds. Each live decoy bird has been
   identified by an irremovable ring. The individual code of each ring is
   recorded in the RDB and linked to both the holder's code and the hunting
   area. Transfers and death/slaughtering of the registered birds are
   recorded, too. The activation of a computerized data collection system
   has proven to be a prerequisite for the implementation of a control
   system for live decoy birds and provides an essential tool for the
   management of AI emergencies.},

Abstract = {Free trade of animals and their products is based on the international
   or bilateral recognition of the health status of the animal populations
   being traded. This recognition is based on documentation of their health
   status by the exporting country, based on the results of continuing
   surveillance.
   According to the Terrestrial Animal Health Code of the World
   Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), this may be based on various
   methods of surveillance, such as: documenting non-specific surveillance
   (clinical surveillance, passive notification of suspect cases, etc.);
   documenting activities that increase the sensitivity of non-specific
   surveillance (training activities, rewards/sanctions for
   notification/failure to notify, etc.); documenting all specific
   surveillance and its results (random surveys, targeted and risk-based
   surveillance, convenience-testing activities, etc.).
   Usually, the infection is the subject of the declaration of freedom.
   While clinical and passive surveillance can provide a high level of
   confidence that foot and mouth disease (FMD) infection is absent, this
   is not the case in vaccinated populations. In these populations,
   specific surveillance becomes much more important than non-specific
   clinical surveillance.
   Specific surveillance is severely restricted by the performance of the
   test(s) employed. The imperfect specificity of any serological test is
   further complicated when techniques to differentiate infected from
   vaccinated animals (DIVA) are used, because imperfect purification of
   the antigen used for vaccination may foster the production of undesired
   antibodies in the vaccinated animals.
   The authors discuss various approaches to overcome this problem; their
   merits and flaws in documenting the absence of infection or virus
   circulation for animal diseases in general, and for FMD in particular.
   Particular attention is paid to finding methods that can be applied in a
   variety of epidemiological conditions and organisational structures,
   since these vary greatly among OIE Members.},

Abstract = {In this study, the presence of Coxiella burnetii (Cb) in cheese produced
   in Southern Italy from milk of cow, buffalo, and small ruminants has
   been evaluated. Two tests based on real-time PCR assay targeting CB
   IS1111 element were performed. First an assay based on the use of
   Taq-Man probe was performed to screen the samples. The positive samples
   were confirmed using both a SyBr Green test and the evaluation of the
   melting temperature of the amplicons. In addition, all cheese samples
   were also tested to determine the milk species utilized (Regulation EC
   273/2008). The samples of cheese produced with a milk mix from different
   species were not included into the study. A total of 169 cheese samples
   were tested, and the obtained results showed an overall prevalence of Cb
   of 21.3 \% with variation between species. A positivity rate of 39 \%
   was observed in cow's cheese while Cb DNA was detected in 26 \% of
   cheese samples made from small ruminants' milk. However, the bacterium
   was found only in 6.9 \% of buffalo's cheese samples. A direct
   association between prevalence and milk used for the production was
   highlighted (chi (2) = 19.12). The statistical analysis of the
   prevalence in the samples from cattle and small ruminants compared with
   those from buffalo shows an OR of 8.4 and 4.9, respectively.},

   genotype 2, and P. blaschkeae as target species and P. stagnora, and P.
   ulmea as negative controls. The assay was applied on 50 isolates of
   Prototheca spp. isolated from bovine mastitic milk or bulk-tank milk
   samples, and all isolates were identified as P. zopfii genotype 2. We
   conclude that the described PCR-SSCP approach is accurate, inexpensive,

Title = {Avian Influenza and Animal Health Risk: Conservation of Endemic
   Threatened Wild Birds in Sardinia Island},
Journal = {AVIAN DISEASES},

Abstract = {Sardinia is a Mediterranean island with a long geological history,
   leading to a separation process from continental Europe during the
   Miocene. As a consequence, in this insular habitat some wild bird
   species developed endemic forms, some of which are currently threatened.
   The aim of this study is to evaluate the possible animal health risk
   associated with a potential avian influenza virus (AIV) circulation in
   Sardinian wild bird populations. Overall, 147 cloacal swabs were sampled
   in the Sardinia region from June 2009 to September 2011. Samples were
   obtained from 12 taxonomic orders, including 16 families and 40 species
   of birds. Based on the endangered host status or on the ecology of the
   host-virus interaction, samples were categorized into three groups of
   species: 1) endemic, endangered, or both (17 species); 2) potential
   reservoir (21 species); and 3) potential spillover (two species).
   Cloacal swabs were tested by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR for
   influenza A virus matrix gene amplification. Forty-one serum samples
   were tested by nucleoprotein-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   (NP-ELISA) for antibodies against influenza A virus nucleoprotein and by
   hemagglutination inhibition assay for detection of seropositivity
   against H5 and H7 AIV subtypes. No cloacal swabs tested RT-PCR positive
   for AIV, whereas two weak seropositive results were detected by NP-ELISA
   in a mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and in a yellow-legged gull (Larus
   michahellis). The low or absent AIV circulation detected in Sardinia's
   wild birds during the study suggests a naive status in these avian
   populations. These data provide new information on AIV circulation in
   Sardinia's wild birds that could be applied to implement conservation
   strategies for threatened species.},

Abstract = {Highly pathogenic (HP) and low pathogenic (LP) avian influenza viruses
   (AIVs) belonging to H5 and H7 subtypes have been found to be associated
   with human infection as the result of direct transmission from infected
   poultry. Human infections by AIVs can cause mild or subclinical disease,
   and serosurveys are believed to represent an important tool to identify
   risk of zoonotic transmission. Therefore, we sought to examine Italian
   poultry workers exposed during LPAI and HPAI outbreaks with the aim of
   assessing serologic evidence of infection with H5 and H7 AIVs. From
   December 2008 to June 2010 serum samples were collected from 188 poultry
   workers and 379 nonexposed controls in Northern Italy. The
   hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay using horse red blood cells
   (RBCs) and a microneutralization (MN) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   test were used to analyze human sera for antibodies against the
   following H5 and H7 LPAI viruses: A/Dk/It/4445/07(H5N2);
   A/Ty/It/2369/09(H5N7); A/Ty/It1218-193/10; A/Ck/It/3775/99(H7N1);
   A/Ty/It/214845/03(H7N3); and A/Dk/It/332145/09(H7N3). Since previous
   studies identified low antibody titer to AIVs in people exposed to
   infected poultry, a cutoff titer of >= 1:10 was chosen for both
   serologic assays. Only HI-positive results confirmed by MN assay were
   considered positive for presence of specific antibodies. The Fisher
   exact test was used to analyze differences in seroprevalence between
   poultry workers and control groups, with the significance level set at P
   < 0.05. MN results showed a proportion of H7-seropositive poultry
   workers (6/188, i.e., 3.2\%), significantly higher than that of controls
   (0/379), whereas no MN-positive result was obtained against three H5
   LPAI subtypes recently identified in Italy. In conclusion, the survey
   indicated that assessing seroprevalence can be an important tool in risk
   assessment and health surveillance of poultry workers.},

Abstract = {Objective To assess the effects of in vitro hemodilution of canine blood
   with a low molecular weight hy-droxyethyl starch (HES 130/0.4) by means
   of thromboelastometry (TEM). Design In vitro experimental study. Setting
   University Teaching Hospital. Animals Ten healthy adult staff-owned dogs
   were sampled for the purposes of the study. Samples were also collected
   from 45 clinically normal dogs to establish thromboelastometric
   reference intervals. Interventions For each dog whole blood was
   collected by jugular venipuncture and placed into tubes containing 3.8\%
   trisodium citrate and stored at 37 degrees C. Two standard dilutions
   (1:4 and 1:10) from canine blood specimens were prepared with HES
   130/0.4 and saline 0.9\%. Measurements and Main Results The effects of
   dilution were studied by TEM. No statistically significant differences
   were observed between the TEM values of the control samples and the
   samples diluted with saline solution (ratio 1:10 and 1:4). In contrast,
   hypocoagulability was observed in the samples treated with HES 130/0.4,
   with more severe effects at 1:4 dilution than at 1:10 dilution. The 1:4
   dilution with HES 130/0.4 produced marked alterations: CT (P = 0.035)
   and CFT (P = 0.0007) on the ex-TEM profile, CT (P = 0.0005) and ML (P =
   0.0017) on the fib-TEM profile and CFT (P = 0.0043) on the in-TEM, were
   all significantly increased (P < 0.05), whereas MCF (P = 0.0042) and
   alpha angle (P = 0.002) on the in-TEM and MCF (P = 0.011) and alpha
   angle (P = 0.001) ex-TEM profiles and MCF (P = 0.0001) on the fib-TEM
   profile were significantly decreased (P < 0.05). Conclusions Dilution of
   canine blood with HES 130/0.4 results in a thromboelastometric pattern
   consistent with hypocoagulation and this effect appears to result from a
   dose-dependent alteration in fibrinogen concentration and inhibition of
   platelet function. As this is an in vitro study, further in vivo
   investigations are necessary to confirm the results.},

Title = {European rabbit survival and recruitment are linked to epidemiological

Abstract = {The European rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus, is threatened within its
   native range, yet it is a highly successful colonizing pest species
   across its worldwide introduced range, causing large economic losses and
   widespread environmental degradation. To date, there has been no
   long-term empirical evidence documenting the relative roles of climatic,
   epidemiological and biological factors in limiting life-history
   determinants of rabbit range and abundance. Using 12 years of
   capturemarkrecapture data from their exotic range in Australia, we
   constructed candidate CormackJollySeber models to test the influence of
   environmental, competition and disease conditions on rabbit survival and
   recruitment. Our results show that: (i) population-level disease
   infection rate has the largest overall impact on rabbit survival,
   explaining 80\% of variance in survival rates; (ii) environmental as
   well as epidemiological conditions constrain rabbit survival, especially
   for younger animals; (iii) temporal variation in rabbit kitten
   recruitment patterns are best described by a combination of climate,
   competition and disease settings (accounting for 68\% of variance),
   while temperature alone has a strong negative influence on kitten
   recruitment; and (iv) recruitment responds positively to rabbit
   haemorrhagic disease, but negatively to myxomatosis the former, probably
   being mediated through a disease driven effect on intraspecific
   competition for food. A strengthened understanding of climate change
   impacts on rabbit range and abundance can be achieved by accounting
   explicitly for potential synergisms between disease dynamics and
   climate. In this analysis, we provide the first step towards such an
   attempt for this important mammal species. Integrated approaches of this
   kind are essential for future forecasts of rabbit range and abundance,
   offsetting the conservation threat faced by O. cuniculus in its native
   range, and achieving effective management in exotic habitats.},

Abstract = {A putative hybrid sea turtle juvenile was evaluated with discriminant
   DNA markers. When compared with standard values for sea turtles, the
   general morphological features assigned the specimen to Caretta caretta,
   while the shape and coloration of the head and the beak profile fell
   within the Eretmochelys imbricata range; the front flippers were instead
   like those of a Chelonia mydas. Moreover, prefrontal scale number was
   outside the putative parental species' ranges. The mitochondrial D-loop
   sequence was from C. caretta, and matched haplotype CC-A2.1, the most
   common in the Mediterranean. Sequence profiles at three nuclear loci
   with species-specific substitutions (Cmos, BDNF and R35) revealed only
   C. caretta variants, thus excluding that the individual was an F1
   hybrid. This study highlights the importance of integrating different
   methodological approaches to understand reproductive animal biology and
   to set the boundaries for specific morphological traits. In particular,
   we propose the genetic analysis of a new combination of mitochondrial
   and nuclear markers as a standard procedure which can be adopted in the
   identification of sea turtle hybrids.},

Abstract = {Objective-To determine MRI characteristics of the skulls and brains of
   sheep with chronic cerebral coenurosis (CC) caused by naturally acquired
   Taenia multiceps infection.
   Animals-33 sheep with CC and 10 healthy control sheep.
   Procedures-Sheep underwent MRI of the head. Volumes of the cranial
   cavity and rostral and caudal fossas of the cranial cavity were
   determined. For CC-affected sheep, the number, location, and volume of T
   multiceps cysts were determined and the percentage volumes of cysts in
   the cranial cavity and rostral and caudal fossas of the cranial cavity
   were calculated. Focal and diffuse abnormalities of cranial bones in
   CC-affected sheep were identified. Brain edema and hemorrhage and signs
   of increased cranial pressure (ICP) in MRI images were determined.
   Results-Volumes of the cranial cavity and rostral and caudal fosses of
   the cranial cavity were significantly larger for CC-affected sheep
   versus healthy control sheep. Total volumes of cysts ranged from 4.40\%
   to 46.93\% in cranial cavities of sheep, 4.12\% to 51.53\% in rostral
   fossas of cranial cavities of sheep, and 15.24\% to 68.30\% in caudal
   fossas of cranial cavities of sheep. Moderate to severe diffuse cranial
   bone abnormalities and signs of increased ICF in MRI images were
   detected in 21 and 24 sheep, respectively, and were positively
   correlated with cyst volumes.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results suggested that cranial cavity
   volume and morphological abnormalities can be detected in sheep with CC.
   These changes may reflect abnormalities in ossification of the cranial
   bones secondary to chronically increased ICP caused by development of T
   multiceps cysts. (Am J Vet Res 2012;73:1913-1918)},

Abstract = {Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) produced by Staphylococcus spp. are
   superantigens responsible for food-poisoning and are associated to
   mobile genetic elements such as Staphylococcus aureus pathogenicity
   islands (SaPI). The presence of 13 enterotoxin genes (sea, seb, sec,
   sed, see, seg, seh, sei, sej, sel, sek, seq, and tst) was tested in 15
   S. aureus and 24 coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS) multi-resistant
   strains isolated from ovine milk in Sardinia. All CNS isolates were
   enterotoxin-negative, whereas co-presence of sec, sel and tst was
   observed in most of the S. aureus strains. One isolate of S. aureus was
   characterized by tst alone. A multiplex PCR assay aimed at
   discriminating between the integrase genes of pathogenicity islands
   SaPI2, SaPIbov1, and SaPIMW2 was developed. We demonstrated that strains
   harboring sec, sel and tst were associated with SaPIbov1, whereas the
   strain positive for tst was associated with SaPI2. Borderline oxacillin
   resistant S. aureus strains were also detected. RAPD analysis of the
   Staphylococcus strains showed that clonal relationships were correlated
   with pathogenic profiles. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The aims of this study were to assess the infectivity of highly
   pathogenic (HP) and low pathogenicity (LP) H7 AI viruses at different
   temperatures and pH values and to investigate the persistance of HP H7
   virus in chicken, turkey and duck meat. The H7 viruses tested remained
   infectious at +4 degrees C and +20 degrees C for 200 and > 50 days,
   respectively. At pH 5, H7 viruses retained their infectivity for a
   shorter period of time compared to pH 7. The infectivity of HP H7 was
   detected > 2 months in meat maintained at +4 degrees C and was higher in
   chicken meat compared to turkey and duck meat. Results of this study
   show that higher temperatures and lower pH values both reduce virus
   infectivity and demonstrate that HP H7 virus can remain infectious in
   meat for extended periods of time. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {West Nile alternative open reading frame (N-NS4B/WARF4) is produced in
   infected West Nile Virus (WNV) cells and induces humoral response in WNV
   infected individuals},
Journal = {VIROLOGY JOURNAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {9},
Month = {NOV 22},
Abstract = {Background: West Nile Virus (WNV) is a flavivirus that requires an
   efficient humoral and cellular host response for the control of
   neuroinvasive infection. We previously reported the existence of six
   alternative open reading frame proteins in WNV genome, one of which
   entitled WARF4 is exclusively restricted to the lineage I of the virus.
   WARF4 is able to elicit antibodies in WNV infected horses; however,
   there was no direct experimental proof of the existence of this novel
   protein. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the in vitro
   production of WARF4 protein following WNV infection of cultured VERO
   cells and its immunity in WNV infected individuals.
   Results: We produced a monoclonal antibody against WARF4 protein (MAb
   3A12) which detected the novel protein in WNV lineage I-infected,
   cultured VERO cells while it did not react with WNV lineage II infected
   cells. MAb 3A12 specificity to WARF4 protein was confirmed by its
   reactivity to only one peptide among four analyzed that cover the full
   WARF4 amino acids sequence. In addition, WARF4 protein was expressed in
   the late phase of WNV lineage I infection. Western blotting and
   bioinformatics analyses strongly suggest that the protein could be
   translated by programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting process. Since WARF4
   is embedded in the NS4B gene, we rename this novel protein N-NS4B/WARF4.
   Furthermore, serological analysis shows that N-NS4B/WARF4 is able to
   elicit antibodies in WNV infected individuals.
   Conclusions: N-NS4B/WARF4 is the second Alternative Reading Frame (ARF)
   protein that has been demonstrated to be produced following WNV
   infection and might represent a novel tool for a better characterization
   of immune response in WNV infected individuals. Further serological as
   well as functional studies are required to characterize the function of
   the N-NS4B/WARF4 protein. Since the virus might actually make an
   extensive use of ARFs, it appears important to investigate the novel six
   ARF putative proteins of WNV.},

Title = {Predicting the spatio-temporal distribution of Culicoides imicola in
   Sardinia using a discrete-time population model},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {5},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {NOV 22},
Abstract = {Background: Culicoides imicola KIEFFER, 1913 (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae)
   is the principal vector of Bluetongue disease in the Mediterranean
   basin, Africa and Asia. Previous studies have identified a range of
   eco-climatic variables associated with the distribution of C. imicola,
   and these relationships have been used to predict the large-scale
   distribution of the vector. However, these studies are not
   temporally-explicit and can not be used to predict the seasonality in C.
   imicola abundances. Between 2001 and 2006, longitudinal entomological
   surveillance was carried out throughout Italy, and provided a
   comprehensive spatio-temporal dataset of C. imicola catches in
   Onderstepoort-type black-light traps, in particular in Sardinia where
   the species is considered endemic.
   Methods: We built a dynamic model that allows describing the effect of
   eco-climatic indicators on the monthly abundances of C. imicola in
   Sardinia. Model precision and accuracy were evaluated according to the
   influence of process and observation errors.
   Results: A first-order autoregressive cofactor, a digital elevation
   model and MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST)/or temperatures acquired
   from weather stations explained similar to 77\% of the variability
   encountered in the samplings carried out in 9 sites during 6 years.
   Incorporating Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) or rainfall
   did not increase the model's predictive capacity. On average, dynamics
   simulations showed good accuracy (predicted vs. observed r corr = 0.9).
   Although the model did not always reproduce the absolute levels of
   monthly abundances peaks, it succeeded in reproducing the seasonality in
   population level and allowed identifying the periods of low abundances
   and with no apparent activity. On that basis, we mapped C. imicola
   monthly distribution over the entire Sardinian region.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated prospects for modelling data
   arising from Culicoides longitudinal entomological surveillance. The
   framework explicitly incorporates the influence of eco-climatic factors
   on population growth rates and accounts for observation and process
   errors. Upon validation, such a model could be used to predict monthly
   population abundances on the basis of environmental conditions, and
   hence can potentially reduce the amount of entomological surveillance.},

Title = {Intestinal parasite infections in immigrant children in the city of
   Rome, related risk factors and possible impact on nutritional status},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {5},
Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {Background: Parasitic diseases can represent a social and economic
   problem among disadvantaged people - even in developed countries. Due to
   the limited data available concerning Europe, the aims of the present
   study were to evaluate the presence of parasites in immigrant children
   and the risk factors favouring the spread of parasites. Subsequently,
   the possible correlation between nutritional status and parasitic
   infections was also investigated.
   Findings: A convenience sample of two hundred and forty seven immigrant
   children (aged 0-15) attending the Poliambulatorio della Medicina
   Solidale in Rome was examined. Data were collected using structured
   questionnaires, and parasitological and anthropometric tests were
   applied. Chi-squared test and binary logistic multiple-regression models
   were used for statistical analysis.
   Thirty-seven children (15\%) tested positive to parasites of the
   following species: Blastocystis hominis, Entamoeba coli, Giardia
   duodenalis, Enterobius vermicularis, Ascaris lumbricoides and
   Strongyloides stercoralis. A monospecific infection was detected in 30
   (81\%) out of 37 parasitized children, while the others (19\%) presented
   a polyparasitism. The major risk factors were housing, i.e. living in
   shacks, and cohabitation with other families (p<0.01). Children
   classified in the lower height Z-scores had a significantly greater
   prevalence of parasites (30.9\%) than the others (p<0.01).
   Conclusions: This study shows that parasite infection in children is
   still quite common, even in a developed country and that children's
   growth and parasitism may be related. Extensive improvements in the
   living, social and economic conditions of immigrants are urgently needed
   in order to overcome these problems.},

   different dose levels in the range 0.1-2 kGy and suggests a simple, fast
   and sequential routine analysis protocol. A total number of 50 oysters
   from North Sea, including 10 control samples, were analysed by using two
   photo-stimulated luminescence (PSL) methods (named A and B) and three
   thermoluminescence (TL) methods (named C, D and E), either on
   constituents or contaminating minerals from shells and intestines.
   Setting a lower threshold value T1 (1000 counts/60 s) all of control
   specimens gave negative screening results while photo counts from
   irradiated samples were found to be higher than upper threshold T2 (4000
   counts/60 s), except at the lowest dose level 0.1 kGy for procedure A.
   All PSL calibrated analysis were successful and a sensitivity index was
   also determined to better classify obtained data according to the
   revised European Standard (EN 13751:2009). TL ratios, Glow 1 over second
   Glow 2, the latter after irradiating at 1 kGy and remeasuring the same
   minerals for each sample, showed values less than 0.1 related to
   untreated samples or higher than 0.1 for irradiated ones. Reported
   procedures were also tested over 60 days, longer than oyster shelf life
   confirming the applicability and feasibility of the proposed methods.

Abstract = {The spatial propagation of many livestock infectious diseases critically
   depends on the animal movements among premises; so the knowledge of
   movement data may help us to detect, manage and control an outbreak. The
   identification of robust spreading features of the system is however
   hampered by the temporal dimension characterizing population
   interactions through movements. Traditional centrality measures do not
   provide relevant information as results strongly fluctuate in time and
   outbreak properties heavily depend on geotemporal initial conditions. By
   focusing on the case study of cattle displacements in Italy, we aim at
   characterizing livestock epidemics in terms of robust features useful
   for planning and control, to deal with temporal fluctuations,
   sensitivity to initial conditions and missing information during an
   outbreak. Through spatial disease simulations, we detect spreading paths
   that are stable across different initial conditions, allowing the
   clustering of the seeds and reducing the epidemic variability. Paths
   also allow us to identify premises, called sentinels, having a large
   probability of being infected and providing critical information on the
   outbreak origin, as encoded in the clusters. This novel procedure
   provides a general framework that can be applied to specific diseases,
   for aiding risk assessment analysis and informing the design of optimal
   surveillance systems.},

Abstract = {Salmonella enterica 4,{[}5],12:i:- is a monophasic variant of
   S.Typhimurium. In the last decade, its prevalence rose sharply. Although
   S. 4,{[}5],12:i:- and S.Typhimurium are known to pose a considerable
   public health risk, there is no detailed information on the circulation
   of these serovars in Italy, particularly as far as veterinary isolates
   are concerned. For this reason, a data set of 877 strains isolated in
   the north-east of Italy from foodstuffs, animals and environment was
   analysed during 20052010. The Random Forests (RF) method was used to
   identify the most important epidemiological and phenotypic variables to
   show the difference between the two serovars. Both descriptive analysis
   and RF revealed that S. 4,{[}5],12:i:- is less heterogeneous than
   S.Typhimurium. RF highlighted that phage type was the most important
   variable to differentiate the two serovars. The most common phage types
   identified for S. 4,{[}5],12:i:- were DT20a, U311 and DT193. The same
   phage types were also found in S.Typhimurium isolates, although with a
   much lower prevalence. DT7 and DT120 were ascribed to the two serovars
   at comparable levels. DT104, DT2 and DT99 were ascribed exclusively to
   S.Typhimurium, and almost all the other phage types identified were more
   related to the latter serovar. Such data confirm that phage typing can
   provide an indication of the biphasic or monophasic state of the strains
   investigated and could therefore support serotyping results. However,
   phage typing cannot be used as the definitive method to differentiate
   the two serovars, as part of the phage types were detected for both
   serovars and, in particular, all phage types found for S. 4,{[}5],12:i-
   were found also for S.Typhimurium.},

Abstract = {Osteosarcoma is the second leading cause of cancer-related death for
   children and young adults. In this study, we have subcutaneously
   injectedwith and without matrigelathymic mice (Fox1nu/nu) with human
   osteosarcoma 3AB-OS pluripotent cancer stem cells (CSCs), which we
   previously isolated from human osteosarcoma MG63 cells. Engrafted 3AB-OS
   cells were highly tumorigenic and matrigel greatly accelerated both
   tumor engraftment and growth rate. 3AB-OS CSC xenografts lacked crucial
   regulators of beta-catenin levels (E-cadherin, APC, and GSK-3beta), and
   crucial factors to restrain proliferation, resulting therefore in a
   strong proliferation potential. During the first weeks of engraftment
   3AB-OS-derived tumors expressed high levels of pAKT, beta1-integrin and
   pFAK, nuclear beta-catenin, c-Myc, cyclin D2, along with high levels of
   hyperphosphorylated-inactive pRb and anti-apoptotic proteins such as
   Bcl-2 and XIAP, and matrigel increased the expression of proliferative
   markers. Thereafter 3AB-OS tumor xenografts obtained with matrigel
   co-injection showed decreased proliferative potential and AKT levels,
   and undetectable hyperphosphorylated pRb, whereas beta1-integrin and
   pFAK levels still increased. Engrafted tumor cells also showed
   multilineage commitment with matrigel particularly favoring the
   mesenchymal lineage. Concomitantly, many blood vessels and muscle fibers
   appeared in the tumor mass. Our findings suggest that matrigel might
   regulate 3AB-OS cell behavior providing adequate cues for transducing
   proliferation and differentiation signals triggered by pAKT,
   beta1-integrin, and pFAK and addressed by pRb protein. Our results
   provide for the first time a mouse model that recapitulates in vivo
   crucial features of human osteosarcoma CSCs that could be used to test
   and predict the efficacy in vivo of novel therapeutic treatments. J.

   with tumour invasion and metastasis in human and canine neoplasia.
   Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), tissue inhibitors of
   metalloproteinases (TIMPs) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A
   (VEGF-A) are key mediators of these respective processes. Mast cell
   tumour (MCT) is the most common malignant cutaneous tumour in dogs. MCTs
   are always considered potentially malignant, but their true metastatic
   potential is unknown. In the present study, samples from seven grade 1,
   22 grade 2 and six grade 3 MCTs were subjected to quantitative real-time
   polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to evaluate
   MMP-2, MMP-9, membrane-type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP), TIMP-2 and VEGF-A mRNA and
   protein expression. Gelatin zymography (GZ) was also performed to
   evaluate MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity. MMP-9 and VEGF-A mRNA increased with
   histological grade, while TIMP-2 decreased with increasing grade. Gene
   expression data obtained for MMP-9, VEGF-A and TIMP-2 were confirmed by
   IHC for evaluation of the respective proteins. In contrast, MMP-2 and
   MT1-MMP had variable, but similar, expression for both mRNA and protein.
   Despite the high variability observed, there was correlation between
   MMP-2 and MT1-MMP mRNA expression (r= +0.91, P < 0.0001). The
   MMP-2:TIMP-2 and MMP-9:TIMP-1 mRNA ratios showed an imbalance between
   MMPs and their specific inhibitors in MCTs, which increased with the
   histological grade. Finally, the activities of both latent and active
   forms of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were evaluated by GZ and there were significant
   increases in their activities with increasing histological grade and
   immunohistochemical expression. This study demonstrates that MMP-9,
   TIMP-2 and VEGF-A expression is related to histological grade and
   suggests that these markers are possible indicators of malignancy and
   targets for therapeutic strategies. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), the causative agent of
   foot-and-mouth disease, is an Apthovirus within the Picornaviridae
   family. Replication of the virus occurs in association with replication
   complexes that are formed by host cell membrane rearrangements. The
   largest viral protein in the replication complex, 2C, is thought to have
   multiple roles during virus replication. However, studies examining the
   function of FMDV 2C have been rather limited. To better understand the
   role of 2C in the process of virus replication, we used a yeast
   two-hybrid approach to identify host proteins that interact with 2C. We
   report here that cellular Beclin1 is a specific host binding partner for
   2C. Beclin1 is a regulator of the autophagy pathway, a metabolic pathway
   required for efficient FMDV replication. The 2C-Beclin1 interaction was
   further confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy to
   actually occur in FMDV-infected cells. Overexpression of either Beclin1
   or Bcl-2, another important autophagy factor, strongly affects virus
   yield in cell culture. The fusion of lysosomes to autophagosomes
   containing viral proteins is not seen during FMDV infection, a process
   that is stimulated by Beclin1; however, in FMDV-infected cells
   overexpressing Beclin1 this fusion occurs, suggesting that 2C would bind
   to Beclin1 to prevent the fusion of lysosomes to autophagosomes,
   allowing for virus survival. Using reverse genetics, we demonstrate here
   that modifications to the amino acids in 2C that are critical for
   interaction with Beclin1 are also critical for virus growth. These
   results suggest that interaction between FMDV 2C and host protein
   Beclin1 could be essential for virus replication.},

Abstract = {Midichloria mitochondrii is an intracellular bacterium found in the hard
   tick Ixodes ricinus. In this arthropod, M. mitochondrii is observed in
   the oocytes and in other cells of the ovary, where the symbiont is
   present in the cell cytoplasm and inside the mitochondria. No studies
   have so far investigated whether M. mitochondrii is present in the
   salivary glands of the tick and whether it is transmitted to vertebrates
   during the tick blood meal. To address the above issues, we developed a
   recombinant antigen of M. mitochondrii (to screen human sera) and
   antibodies against this antigen (for the staining of the symbiont).
   Using these reagents we show that (i) M. mitochondrii is present in the
   salivary glands of I. ricinus and that (ii) seropositivity against M.
   mitochondrii is highly prevalent in humans parasitized by I. ricinus
   (58\%), while it is very low in healthy individuals (1.2\%). These
   results provide evidence that M. mitochondrii is released with the tick
   saliva and raise the possibility that M. mitochondrii is infectious to
   vertebrates. Besides this, our study indicates that M. mitochondrii
   should be regarded as a package of antigens inoculated into the human
   host during the tick bite. This implies that the immunology of the
   response toward the saliva of I. ricinus is to be reconsidered on the
   basis of potential effects of M. mitochondrii and poses the basis for
   the development of novel markers for investigating the exposure of
   humans and animals to this tick species.},

Title = {Predicting dioxin-like PCBs soil contamination levels using milk of

Abstract = {Dioxin-like PCBs (dl-PCBs) are ubiquitous persistent organic pollutants
   of recognized negative effects on human health. Assessing highly
   polluted areas should be an important public health issue. This study
   proposes to use the milk of grazing animals as a bioindicator of dl-PCB
   contamination in the environment. The hypothesis is that milk
   concentration of dl-PCBs are related to soil concentrations of these
   compounds, and that soils are generally reflective of a larger
   environmental issue of dl-PCB contamination. In this study, we evaluate
   the possibility of predicting soil concentrations using milk of sheep,
   cows and buffalos in a spatial model. For this purpose, samples of soil
   and milk collected in Campania (Italy) were introduced in a GIS platform
   to perform geostatistical analysis for building a simple predictive
   model. The ordinary least squares regressions (OLS) showed a
   statistically significant correlation (p < 0.05) between soil and milk
   contamination. However, this relationship was spatially variable. Thus,
   a geographically weighted regression (GWR) was performed, obtaining R-2
   values of 0.91, 0.77 and 0.66 for sheep's, buffalo's and cow's milk
   respectively. Assessed the mathematical relationships between the
   variables, new data was introduced to evaluate the performance of the
   model. Predictions of soil contamination with dl-PCBs using sheep's,
   cow's and buffalo's milk showed a mean error of 23\%, 25\% and 36\%
   respectively. According to these results the sheep's milk can be
   considered the best bioindicator of dl-PCBs contamination among the
   three species. The results of this project evidence the potentialities
   of the proposed approach to assess bioindicator performance in a spatial
   predictive model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Infectious bronchitis, a disease of chickens caused by Avian coronavirus
   infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), leads to severe economic losses for
   the poultry industry worldwide. Various attempts to control the virus
   based on vaccination strategies are performed. However, due to the
   emergence of novel genotypes, an effective control of the virus is
   hindered. In 1996, a novel viral genotype named IBV-QX was reported for
   the first time in Qingdao, Shandong province, China. The first
   appearance of an IBV-QX isolate in Europe was reported between 2003 and
   2004 in The Netherlands. Subsequently, infections with this genotype
   were found in several other European countries such as France, Italy,
   Germany, United Kingdom, Slovenia, and Sweden. The present report
   describes the use of a new set of degenerate primers that amplify a
   636-bp fragment within the S1 gene by reverse transcription polymerase
   chain reaction to detect the occurrence of IBV-QX infection in
   Switzerland.},

Abstract = {The present study describes the use of microarray technology for rapid
   identification and differentiation of Mycoplasma mycoides subsp.
   mycoides from other mycoplasmas that may be pathogenic to ruminants,
   including those of the Mycoplasma mycoides cluster, genetically and
   antigenically strictly correlated with Mycoplasma mycoides subsp.
   mycoides. A microarray containing genetic sequences of 55 different
   bacterial species from Acholeplasma, Mycoplasma, Spiroplasma and
   Ureaplasma genera was constructed. Sequences to genes of interest were
   collected in FASTA format from NCBI. The collected sequences were
   processed with OligoPicker software. Oligonucleotides were then checked
   for their selectivity with BLAST searches in GenBank. The microarray was
   tested with ATCC/NCTC strains of Mycoplasma spp. of veterinary
   importance in ruminants including Mycoplasma belonging to the mycoides
   cluster as well as Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides and Mycoplasma
   mycoides subsp. capri field strains. The results showed that but one
   ATCC/NCTC reference strains hybridized with their species-specific
   sequences showed a profile/signature different and distinct from each
   other. The heat-map of the hybridization results for the nine genes
   interrogated for Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides demonstrated that
   the reference strain Mycoplasma mycoides subsp mycoides PG1 was positive
   for all of the gene sequences spotted on the microarray. CBPP field,
   vaccine and reference strains were all typed to be M. mycoides subsp.
   mycoides, and seven of the nine strains gave positive hybridization
   results for all of the nine genes. Two Italian strains were negative for
   some of the genes. Comparison with non-Mycoplasma mycoides subsp.
   mycoides reference strains showed some positive signals or considerable
   homology to Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides genes. As expected, some
   correlations were observed between the strictly genetically and
   antigenically correlated Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides and
   Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri strains. Specifically, we observed that
   some Italian Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides strains were positive
   for two out of the three Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri genes,
   differently from what has been observed for other European or African
   Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides strains. This study highlighted the
   use of microarray technology as a simple and effective method for a
   single-step identification and differentiation of Mycoplasma mycoides
   subsp. mycoides from other mycoplasmas that may be pathogenic to
   ruminants, including those of the Mycoplasma mycoides cluster,
   genetically and antigenically strictly correlated with Mycoplasma
   mycoides subsp. mycoides. The opportunity to discriminate several
   mycoplasmas in a single analysis enhances diagnostic rapidity and may
   represent a useful tool to screen occasionally mycoplasmas affecting
   animal farming in territories where diagnostic laboratory support is
   limited. The heat-map of the hybridization results of the comparative
   genomic hybridizations DNA-designed chip clearly indicates that the
   microarray performs well for the identification of the tested Mycoplasma
   mycoides subsp. mycoides reference and field strains, discriminating
   them from other mycoplasmas.},

Title = {Does Routine Completion Angiogram During Embolectomy for Acute
   Upper-Limb Ischemia Improve Outcomes?},

Abstract = {Background: Since 1963, Fogarty balloon catheter thromboembolectomy is
   usually adopted as the gold standard treatment for acute limb ischemia.
   As the success of the procedure depends on complete removal of all
   thromboembolic material, intraoperative arteriography can be used after
   arterial thromboembolectomy as a guide for extension of the procedure.
   It is still a matter of debate whether intraoperative angiography should
   be routinely performed in all cases or only in selected cases, depending
   on intraoperative findings, when the surgeon suspects an incomplete
   disobstruction. Most published evidence derives from analysis of
   lower-limb thromboembolectomies. The aim of our retrospective study was
   to elucidate the value of routine completion angiogram in acute arterial
   embolism of the upper limb.
   Methods: Clinical and demographic data of 100 patients with acute
   embolic upper-limb ischemia were prospectively recorded during an
   18-year period in a central hospital vascular unit setting. The
   relevance of intraoperative angiography was retrospectively analyzed.
   The procedures were divided into two groups: group A, when
   intraoperative angiography was performed in selected cases (selective
   angiography); and group B, when angiography was performed as a routine
   procedure in all cases (routine angiography). All factors associated
   with reocclusion and mortality were investigated to produce meaningful
   information that could assist the surgeon to predict outcomes.
   Results: Cumulative reocclusion and mortality rates at 24 months were
   14.0\% and 70.0\%, respectively. After upper-limb arterial embolectomy,
   the rate of extension of the procedure was significantly higher in group
   B than in group A (26.0\% vs. 4.0\%, P = 0.002). At 24 months after
   embolectomy, group B resulted in a lower incidence of reocclusion
   compared with group A (12.0\% vs. 2.0\%, P=0.05), whereas there was no
   statistical difference between the two groups in terms of mortality
   (P>0.05). On univariate analysis, the factor associated with increased
   2-year reocclusion rate was only the avoidance of completion
   angiography, although it lost some of its predictive value on
   multivariate analysis. Factors associated with increased 2-year
   mortality rate on univariate analysis included age >80 years, diabetes
   mellitus {[}DM], and antiplatelet drug use. Only DM was significantly
   associated on multivariate analysis.
   Conclusion: Routine use of intraoperative angiography influences outcome
   after embolectomy for upper-limb acute arterial occlusion. Routine use
   of intraoperative angiography, compared with selective use, results in a
   higher rate of extension of the procedure for residual lesion and in a
   lower rate of reocclusion at 24 months. In prevention of reocclusion,
   completion angiogram has a hazard ratio of 5.44 on multivariate
   analysis. Postoperative late mortality is mainly affected by old age and
   DM.},

Title = {Diversity of Salmonella spp. serovars isolated from the intestines of
   water buffalo calves with gastroenteritis},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {8},
Month = {OCT 25},
Abstract = {Background: Salmonellosis in water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) calves is a
   widespread disease characterized by severe gastrointestinal lesions,
   profuse diarrhea and severe dehydration, occasionally exhibiting a
   systemic course. Several Salmonella serovars seem to be able to infect
   water buffalo, but Salmonella isolates collected from this animal
   species have been poorly characterized. In the present study, the
   prevalence of Salmonella spp. in water buffalo calves affected by lethal
   gastroenteritis was assessed, and a polyphasic characterization of
   isolated strains of S. Typhimurium was performed.
   Results: The microbiological analysis of the intestinal contents
   obtained from 248 water buffalo calves affected by lethal
   gastroenteritis exhibited a significant prevalence of Salmonella spp.
   (25\%), characterized by different serovars, most frequently Typhimurium
   (21\%), Muenster (11\%), and Give (11\%). The 13 S. Typhimurium isolates
   were all associated with enterocolitis characterized by severe damage of
   the intestine, and only sporadically isolated with another possible
   causative agent responsible for gastroenteritis, such as Cryptosporidium
   spp., Rotavirus or Clostridium perfringens. Other Salmonella isolates
   were mostly isolated from minor intestinal lesions, and often (78\% of
   cases) isolated with other microorganisms, mainly toxinogenic
   Escherichia coli (35\%), Cryptosporidium spp. (20\%) and Rotavirus
   (10\%). The S. Typhimurium strains were characterized by phage typing
   and further genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of 24
   virulence genes. The isolates exhibited nine different phage types and
   10 different genetic profiles. Three monophasic S. Typhimurium (B: 4,12:
   i:-) isolates were also found and characterized, displaying three
   different phage types and three different virulotypes. The molecular
   characterization was extended to the 7 S. Muenster and 7 S. Give
   isolates collected, indicating the existence of different virulotypes
   also within these serovars. Three representative strains of S.
   Typhimurium were tested in vivo in a mouse model of mixed infection. The
   most pathogenic strain was characterized by a high number of virulence
   factors and the presence of the locus agfA, coding for a thin
   aggregative fimbria.
   Conclusions: These results provide evidence that Salmonella is
   frequently associated with gastroenteritis in water buffalo calves,
   particularly S. Typhimurium. Moreover, the variety in the number and
   distribution of different virulence markers among the collected S.
   Typhimurium strains suggests that within this serovar there are
   different pathotypes potentially responsible for different clinical
   syndromes.},

Abstract = {In the present study, transcriptional and post-translational effects of
   culturing time and prototypical cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inducers on
   principal nuclear receptors (NRs), CYP2B22, 2C and 3A were investigated
   in long-term stored (similar to 10 years) cryopreserved pig hepatocytes
   (CPHs). In the time-course study, a crush and rise effect was observed
   for pregnane X receptor (NR1I2) and constitutive androstane receptor
   (NR1I3) mRNAs, while a time-dependent increase of retinoid X receptor
   alpha (NR2B1) was noticed. Cytochrome P450 gene expression profiles were
   down-regulated as a function of time. In the induction study, an
   increase of NR1I2. NR1I3 and NR2B1 mRNAs was observed in
   dexamethasone-exposed CPHs. About CYPs, an overall up-regulation was
   seen in CPHs exposed to phenobarbital, while dexamethasone and
   rifampicin up-regulated only CYP3A. In both studies, transcriptional CYP
   results were confirmed at the post-translational level (immunoblotting
   and enzyme activities), except for CYP2B immunoblotting in the induction
   study. The present data demonstrate that long-term stored CPHs may be
   used to investigate mechanisms involved in CYPs regulation, expression
   and function; provide further info about NR regulation of CYPs, and
   confirm species-differences in these mechanisms of regulation; finally,
   they suggest the usefulness and relevance of gene expression profiling
   to early detect any modulation of CYP expression and bioactivity.},

Abstract = {West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging zoonotic pathogen with rapid global
   expansion. The virus circulation is confirmed in many countries of
   Mediterranean Basin and Southern and Central Europe. In our study
   detection of specific WNV antibodies was performed in horses and cattle
   sera samples collected from October 2010 to April 2011. Serum samples
   were randomly taken from different parts of Croatia and tested by IgG
   and IgM ELISA. Positive serological results were confirmed by virus
   neutralization assay (VN-assay) and plaque reduction neutralization test
   (PANT). Results showed that WNV antibodies were present in 72 out of
   2098 horse sera (3.43\%) and 3 of 2695 cattle sera (0.11\%). The highest
   seroprevalence was found in Eastern Croatia in counties next to
   Hungarian, Serbian and Bosnia and Herzegovinian state borders. In
   Adriatic part of Croatia positive animals were found only in the
   westernmost county, near Slovenian and Italian borders. Geographic
   distribution and number of positive horses indicated that WNV is highly
   present in Croatia and spreading from East to West. However, positive
   horses in westernmost part of country indicate possible second origin of
   spreading. Location of serological positive cattle supports the
   hypothesis that seropositive cattle could be indicators of high WNV
   activity in the respective geographic regions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV), an arthropod-borne orbivirus
   (family Reoviridae), is an emerging pathogen of wild and domestic
   ruminants that is closely related to bluetongue virus (BTV). The present
   study examines the outcome of an experimental EHDV-7 infection of
   Holstein cattle and East Frisian sheep. Apart from na ve animals that
   had not been exposed to BTV, it included animals that had been
   experimentally infected with either BTV-6 or BTV-8 two months earlier.
   In addition, EHDV-infected cattle were subsequently challenged with
   BTV-8.
   Samples were tested with commercially available ELISA and real-time
   RT-PCR kits and a custom NS3-specific real-time RT-PCR assay. Virus
   isolation was attempted in Vero, C6/36 and KC cells (from Culicoides
   variipennis), embryonated chicken eggs and type I interferon
   receptor-deficient IFNAR-I- mice.
   EHDV-7 productively infected Holstein cattle, but caused no clinical
   signs. The inoculation of East Frisian sheep, on the other hand,
   apparently did not lead to a productive infection. The commercial
   diagnostic kits performed adequately. KC cells proved to be the most
   sensitive means of virus isolation, but viremia was shorter than 2 weeks
   in most animals. No interference between EHDV and BTV infection was
   observed; therefore the pre-existing immunity to some BTV serotypes in
   Europe is not expected to protect against a possible introduction of
   EHDV, in spite of the close relation between the viruses. (c) 2012

Title = {Response of the goat mammary gland to infection with Staphylococcus
   aureus revealed by gene expression profiling in milk somatic and white
   blood cells},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {13},
Month = {OCT 9},
Abstract = {Background: S. aureus is one of the main pathogens responsible for the
   intra-mammary infection in dairy ruminants. Although much work has been
   carried out to understand the complex physiological and cellular events
   that occur in the mammary gland in response to S. aureus, the protective
   mechanisms are still poorly understood. The objectives of the present
   study were to investigate gene expression during the early response of
   the goat mammary gland to an experimental challenge with S. aureus, in
   order to better understand the local and systemic response and to
   compare them in two divergent lines of goat selected for high and low
   milk somatic cell scores.
   Results: No differences in gene expression were found between high and
   low SCS (Somatic Cells Score) selection lines. Analysing the two groups
   together, an expression of 300 genes were found to change from T0 before
   infection, and T4 at 24 hours and T5 at 30 hours following challenge. In
   blood derived white blood cells 8 genes showed increased expression
   between T0 and T5 and 1 gene has reduced expression. The genes showing
   the greatest increase in expression following challenge (5.65 to 3.16
   fold change) play an important role in (i) immune and inflammatory
   response (NFKB1, TNFAIP6, BASP1, IRF1, PLEK, BATF3); (ii) the regulation
   of innate resistance to pathogens (PTX3); and (iii) the regulation of
   cell metabolism (CYTH4, SLC2A6, ARG2). The genes with reduced expression
   (-1.5 to -2.5 fold) included genes involved in (i) lipid metabolism
   (ABCG2, FASN), (ii) chemokine, cytokine and intracellular signalling
   (SPPI), and (iii) cell cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix (KRT19).
   Conclusions: Analysis of genes with differential expression following
   infection showed an inverse relationship between immune response and
   lipid metabolism in the early response of the mammary gland to the S.
   aureus challenge. PTX3 showed a large change in expression in both milk
   and blood, and is therefore a candidate for further studies on immune
   response associated with mastitis.},

Abstract = {Ultrasonography is a fundamental diagnostic imaging tool in everyday
   clinical practice. Here, we are unique in describing the use of
   functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as hyperechogenic
   material, suggesting their potential application as ultrasound contrast
   agents. Initially, we carried out a thorough investigation to assess the
   echogenic property of the nanotubes in vitro. We demonstrated their
   long-lasting ultrasound contrast properties. We also showed that
   ultrasound signal of functionalized MWCNTs is higher than graphene
   oxide, pristine MWCNTs, and functionalized single-walled CNTs.
   Qualitatively, the ultrasound signal of CNTs was equal to that of sulfur
   hexafluoride (SonoVue), a commercially available contrast agent. Then,
   we found that MWCNTs were highly echogenic in liver and heart through ex
   vivo experiments using pig as an animal model. In contrast to the
   majority of ultrasound contrast agents, we observed in a phantom bladder
   that the tubes can be visualized within a wide variety of frequencies
   (i.e., 5.5-10 MHz) and 12.5 MHz using tissue harmonic imaging modality.
   Finally, we demonstrated in vivo in the pig bladder that MWCNTs can be
   observed at low frequencies, which are appropriate for abdominal organs.
   Importantly, we did not report any toxicity of CNTs after 7 d from the
   injection by animal autopsy, organ histology and immunostaining, blood
   count, and chemical profile. Our results reveal the enormous potential
   of CNTs as ultrasound contrast agents, giving support for their future
   applications as theranostic nanoparticles, combining diagnostic and
   therapeutic modalities.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the hygiene performance of a
   camel (Camelus dromedarius) slaughtering process as carried out with the
   traditional method in the Sahrawi refugee camps located in southwestern
   Algeria. The camel slaughtering process in this region differs
   significantly from that carried out in commercial abattoirs.
   Slaughtering is performed outdoors in desert areas, and dehiding of the
   carcass is approached via the dorsoventral route rather than the classic
   ventrodorsal route. Samples were taken from 10 camel carcasses from
   three different areas: the hide, the carcass meat immediately after
   dehiding, and the meat after final cutting. Enterobacteriaceae counts
   (EC) were enumerated employing conventional laboratory techniques.
   Carcass meat samples resulted in EC below the detection limit more
   frequently if the hide samples from the same carcass had also EC counts
   below the detection limit. Because of the low number of trials, the
   calculation of statistical significance of the results was not possible.
   Further experimental research is needed in order to validate the results
   presented in this study. The comparison of the microbiological hygiene
   performance between dorsal dehiding and traditional ventral dehiding of
   slaughtered animals could serve to validate the hypothesis of the
   potential positive impact of the dorsal dehiding method in carcass meat
   hygiene.},

Abstract = {A female wild boar, aged approximately two years, was found dead by
   local veterinary services in Piano la di Roio in L'Aquila Province
   situated in the Abruzzo Region of central Italy. The carcass was
   submitted to the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e
   del Molise `G. Caporale' in Teramo for necropsy. Brucella suis biovar 2
   was isolated from submandibular lymph nodes. This is the first report of
   isolation of B. suis in the Abruzzo Region. Several authors agreed in
   the past on the hypothesis that B. suis biovar 2 had been introduced
   into Italy through the importation of hares from European countries in
   which the infection is endemic in wild populations. This led the Italian
   authorities to reinforce existing controls for hares imported for
   restocking purposes. However, no provisions for brucellosis control are
   currently in place (or have been in place in the past) for wild boar
   movements either at the national or the European level. The isolation of
   B. suis biovar 2 from wild boar in two different and distant regions of
   Italy may suggest that this infection may have been introduced to the
   affected areas by wild boar rather than by imported hares. National and
   European rules managing wildlife brucellosis should be adapted to
   control the health status of farmed wild boar before movement or
   release, with the aim of preventing the spread of this pathogen to free
   territories.},

Abstract = {A seven-year-old horse was euthanised after exhibiting a severe and
   rapidly progressive neurological disorder. Tissue samples were
   despatched to the Italian Reference Centre for Animal Foreign Diseases
   (Istituto `G. Caporale' in Teramo) for diagnosis. All laboratory tests
   for equine neurotropic viruses gave negative results. Scattered
   perivascular inflammatory infiltrates and several parasites that were
   morphologically classified as Halicephalobus gingivalis, were seen
   within the brain upon microscopic examination. Pathological findings led
   to the diagnosis of parasitic meningo-encephalitis caused by H.
   gingivalis. This case report confirms that halicephalobosis should be
   taken into account in the differential diagnosis of equine
   encephalopathy and it also highlights the value of a multidisciplinary
   approach to problem solving in veterinary medicine.},

Abstract = {Ovine sera collected from the northern Prefectures of Hokkaido, Iwate
   and Aomori in Japan, were examined for the presence of antibodies
   against Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) using the complement fixation test
   and, against Brucella spp., using both the rapid serum agglutination
   test and the complement fixation test. None of the sera tested were
   serologically positive to Brucella spp. A total of 21 animals (8.64\%)
   out of 243 samples tested were seropositive to the C. burnetii antigen.
   Levels of infection were observed in all of the three Prefectures and in
   ten flocks of the fourteen sampled. Although no diagnostic measures were
   in place, the infection could not be linked to losses in sheep
   production or to the decreased fertility in ewes, a lower lambing rate
   and mortality in lambs. These data confirmed that Q fever is widespread
   in the sheep population in the area studied. Considering the zoonotic
   potential of the disease, further studies to investigate the
   epidemiology of Q fever in this region are required.},

Abstract = {Massive blooms of the harmful benthic dinoflagellate Ostreopsis cf.
   ovata are of growing environmental concern in the Mediterranean, having
   recently caused adverse effects on benthic invertebrates and also some
   intoxication episodes to humans.
   The toxicological potential of produced palytoxin-like compounds was
   investigated in the present study on a typical marine sentinel species,
   the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. Organisms were sampled during
   various phases of a O. cf. ovata bloom, in two differently impacted
   sites. The presence of the algal toxins was indirectly assessed in
   mussels tissues (mouse test and hemolysis neutralization assay), while
   biological and toxicological effects were evaluated through the
   measurement of osmoregulatory and neurotoxic alterations (Na+/K+-ATPase
   and acetylcholinesterase activities), oxidative stress responses
   (antioxidant defences and total oxyradical scavenging capacity), lipid
   peroxidation processes (level of malondialdehyde), peroxisomal
   proliferation, organelle dysfunctions (lysosomal membrane stability.
   accumulation of lipofuscin and neutral lipids), immunological impairment
   (granulocytes percentage).
   Obtained results demonstrated a significant accumulation of algal toxins
   in mussels exposed to O. cf. ovata. These organisms exhibited a marked
   inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase activity and alterations of
   immunological, lysosomal and neurotoxic responses. Markers of oxidative
   stress showed more limited variations suggesting that toxicity of the O.
   cf. ovata toxins is not primarily mediated by an over production of
   reactive oxygen species. This study provided preliminary results on the
   usefulness of a multi-biomarker approach to assess biological
   alterations and toxicological events associated to blooms of O. cf.
   ovata in marine organisms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Migratory birds are considered one of the main sources for West Nile
   virus (WNV) introduction into European countries. Following the WNV
   epidemic in the late summer of 1998 in a marshy area of Tuscany (Padule
   of Fucecchio), an extensive ornithological surveillance programme was
   carried out in the infected areas from 2006 to 2008. Several species of
   migratory and resident birds were trapped, sampled and serologically
   tested. The results of this surveillance programme gave a useful
   indication of potential sources of WNV re-introduction and spread into
   Italy. The area under study was also investigated and classified into
   ecological areas through satellite image processing. In August 2008, the
   WNV infection re-emerged in Italy in the area surrounding the Po river
   delta, involving three regions: Lombardy, Emilia Romagna and Veneto.
   Several surveillance activities were immediately put in place, including
   the extensive monitoring of wild birds found dead or trapped in the
   framework of other surveillance programmes. These activities were also
   prolonged in the 2009, when the virus circulation re-occurred at the
   border of the area already infected in 2008. The possible
   epidemiological role of the different species of migratory and resident
   birds is discussed, in relation to the different ecological patterns
   identified in the area and their potential ability to introduce, spread
   and support the endemization of WNV infection.},

Abstract = {Salmonella remains a major public health concern worldwide.
   Microbiological methods are the gold standard for Salmonella detection.
   These methods are highly specific, but their sensitivity is variable.
   Moreover, they are lengthy, labour intensive and not always consistent
   with the speed of food manufacturing processes. Thus, in the food
   industry, there is the need for more rapid, sensitive and accurate
   detection methods. The purpose of this study is to describe a
   Salmonella-monitoring scheme in different food processing plants based
   on a screening approach by a commercial real-time polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) kit and subsequent confirmation of positive molecular
   results by the reference microbiological method. This scheme was tested
   on a total of 4,693 samples, 90 of which were positive with the
   real-time PCR screening; 52 of the positive samples were eventually
   confirmed by the microbiological method. The real-time PCR kit was
   tested in comparison to the microbiological method in order to evaluate
   its performances and drawbacks. The comparison between cycle threshold
   (Ct) values of real-time PCR and the microbiological results (Wilcoxon
   rank sum test) showed a statistically significant difference between the
   Ct values of bacteriological positive and bacteriological negative
   samples (p value, < 0.05). Furthermore, receiver operating
   characteristic curve analysis was used to identify the Ct value ensuring
   the lowest level of misclassification between Salmonella-positive and
   negative samples. The present study confirms that the real-time PCR kit
   tested could be used as a screening tool, leading to a rapid and
   sensitive identification of Salmonella and confining bacteriological
   confirmation to samples previously identified as positive.},

Abstract = {Influenza outbreaks are widespread in swine and avian populations.
   Disease control is jeopardized by the extreme antigenic variability of
   virus strains. Primary isolation of Influenza virus is performed using
   embryonated chicken eggs (ECE), but alternatives to ECE are badly
   needed. Although various cultured cells have been used for propagating
   Influenza A viruses, few types of cells can efficiently support virus
   replication. One of the most commonly cell lines used in order to
   isolate Influenza A virus, is represented by the Madin Darby Canine
   Kidney (MDCK) cell line, but cells derived from primary swine organs
   (kidney, testicle, lung and trachea) can also be employed. The aim of
   this study was the evaluation of NSK, MDCK, UMNSAH/DF1 cell lines
   suitability, compared to ECE for isolation and propagation of Avian and
   Swine virus subtypes. The results indicated both NSK and MDCK could
   provide an appropriate substrate for cultivating either Avian (AIV) or
   Swine (SIV) Influenza virus strains, especially for high pathogenicity
   Avian Influenza ones.
   Furthermore, NSK appeared more susceptible than MDCK cells for primary
   isolation of AIV. In contrast, UMNSAH/DF1 cell line seemed to be less
   permissive to support Avian virus growth. Furthermore, no SIV
   replication was detected except for one subtype. Additionally, the
   results of this study indicated that not all virus strains seemed to
   adapt with the same efficiency to the different cell lines. On the
   contrary, chicken embryos were shown to be the most suitable biological
   system for AIV isolation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {European and Italian legislation have banned use of growth promoters in
   livestock since 1988, but epidemiological data show that anabolic drugs
   are still being used illegally. Recent surveys carried out on the cattle
   farms in Northern Italy have confirmed the presence of growth-promoting
   hormones. Authors report data on growth performances in 80 Valle del
   Belice x Comisana weaned lambs experimentally treated with 17
   beta-estradiol with 0.5 ml solution of oil Depot Estradiol A (R)
   (containing 5 mg of 17 beta-estradiol valerate) by intramuscular
   injection into the thigh. The experiment was founded by the National
   Ministry of Health, to validate histological test for surveillance and
   control of growth-promoting hormones in sheep. This study confirmed the
   strong correlation between clinical and anatomopathological features and
   growth performances of treated animals. Otherwise, no significant
   differences were found on in vivo performance of the lambs. Estradiol
   treatment showed heavier shoulders and necks on treated lambs, while the
   loins were significantly lighter. Moreover, lamb-estradiol-treated
   groups showed lower separable and inseparable fat percentage than

Abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different intensities and
   durations of ultrasound on the composition, oxidation, cheese-making
   properties and sensory traits of raw milk. Moreover, the effects of the
   addition of CO2 and HCl prior to the sonication were tested to determine
   whether these chemicals could reduce the production of off-flavours.
   Treating milk with ultrasound led to certain changes in milk
   composition. We observed significant increases in free fatty acid
   levels, oxidation, and decreases in somatic cell count and pH; improved
   coagulation traits were also observed. The results of sensory
   evaluations revealed a significant increase in a burnt off-flavour with
   increasing intensity and duration of the ultrasound treatment. The
   addition of CO2 appeared to significantly reduce the disruptive effect
   of ultrasound, the formation of oxidation products and the detection of
   the burnt off-flavour, whereas the sour flavour was increased.
   Industrial relevance: Among the new technologies that are used to
   improve milk sanitisation and shelf life, ultrasound treatment has been
   demonstrated to inactivate many bacterial species and to be a viable
   sanitisation procedure.
   In this study the milk coagulation properties of sonicated milk were
   dramatically improved following the ultrasound (US) treatments,
   indicating a possible use for US in the cheese-making industry.
   Moreover, despite the evident production of off-flavours caused by US in
   milk, the use of CO2 to reduce pyrolytic processes and thus the
   formation of oxidation products, appeared to be promising with respect
   to the increased use of sonication on food and other organic matrices.

Abstract = {Follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) residing within ileal Peyer's patches
   (PPs) are of crucial relevance for sheep scrapie early pathogenesis and
   subsequent scrapie prion neuroinvasion. In this study, ileal PP
   follicles were significantly more numerous in lambs than in adult Sarda
   breed sheep, with significant differences being also found in lymphoid
   follicle area, perimeter and FDC density. Furthermore, PrPd deposition
   within ileal PPs and host's PrP genotype did not significantly influence
   these parameters. We conclude that age significantly affects FDC density
   in Heal PPs from Sarda breed ovines, independently from host's scrapie
   status and PrP genotype. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Bioavailability of coated amoxicillin in pigs field experiences},
Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},

Abstract = {Amoxicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic widely used in pigs, has a broad
   spectrum of action and bactericidal activity against the common
   respiratory pathogens.
   The aim of the present study was to identify the bioavailability and
   pharmacokinetic behaviour of two different formulations of amoxicillin
   orally administered to pigs. A new premix for medicated feedstuff
   containing 10\% of coated amoxicillin, was developed using a hydrophobic
   matrix and was compared with a premix for medicated feedstuff containing
   10\% of not coated amoxicillin. Two feed formulations medicated with 20
   gr. of the two premixes for medicated feedstuff were administered to 8
   pigs using a two period, two sequence crossover design with a 7 days
   washout period. Medicated feed was administered to pigs as a single dose
   at 8 mg/kg b.w., and was rapidly and totally consumed.
   Amoxicillin analyses in serum were performed by a sensitive high
   performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with fluorometric
   detection, using an extraction procedure already described for edible
   tissues of fish and adapted and validated for pig serum. The oral
   bioavailability of the formulation with coated amoxicillin was higher
   than the one of not coated amoxicillin and the area under the
   concentration-time curve (AUC) values was significantly different
   (P<0.05). Differences between the mean maximum concentration (C-max),
   time of C-max (t(max)) and mean residence time (MRT) of the drug
   formulations were also statistically significant.
   Coated amoxicillin is suitable for in-feed administration to pigs and,
   thanks to its higher oral bioavailability compared to the not coated
   compound; it may be more effective for the treatment of susceptible
   infections. The bioavailability of the coated formulation most probably
   is referred to a greater stability in acid environment compared to not
   coated amoxicillin. Furthermore the protection of amoxicillin with a
   hydrophobic matrix matches with a reduced risk of cross-contamination
   and improves safety of feed manufacturing.},

Abstract = {This work examines the antimicrobial resistance of potentially
   pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Streptococcus
   canis. Escherichia coli) found in the vaginal tract in prepartum mammary
   secretions and postpartum milk of bitches housed in breeding kennels (N
   = 20; 92 bitches). The kennels were divided into three categories: no
   routine antimicrobial administration around parturition (category 1);
   routine administration of one antibiotic around parturition (category
   2); routine administration of multiple antimicrobials around parturition
   (category 3). Bacteriological cultures and antibiotic susceptibility
   tests were performed on vaginal specimens, prepartum mammary secretions,
   and postpartum milk. Stillbirths and neonatal deaths were recorded for
   each whelping and analyzed as ``within-litter stillbirths{''} and
   ``within-litter neonatal deaths{''} according to kennel category, by
   Pearson chi(2) test and the Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test,
   respectively. The frequency of isolation and antimicrobial resistance of
   bacteria were analyzed according to kennel category by Pearson chi(2)
   test. Kennel category was not significantly associated with differing
   numbers of stillbirths or neonatal death events, nor was the frequency
   of isolation of potentially pathogenic bacteria in the three kennel
   categories significantly different. Kennel category 3 had a
   significantly higher frequency of isolation of multiresistant
   gram-positive bacterial strains. Our results show that intense
   administration of antibiotics to breeding bitches does not effectively
   reduce neonatal mortality; on the contrary, it induces multiresistance
   in potentially pathogenic bacteria. Breeders and veterinarians should be
   aware of the risk of selecting pathogenic bacteria by uncontrolled
   treatment in. prepartum bitches. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to evaluate the degree of PCBs
   contamination of wild brown trouts (Salmo trutta trutta L) caught in
   Marche Region rivers and to study the percentage contribution of the sum
   of the six indicators PCBs with respect to the sum of eighteen congeners
   in wild brown trouts. The determination of eighteen PCBs was made on the
   edible portion (fillets) of trouts by GC-ECD analysis. Fish samples were
   collected from fourteen rivers, selected to represent the fluvial
   pollution in the Marche Region. The total sum of eighteen congener
   concentrations was 8.2 +/- 0.9 ng/g wet weight. All the analysed samples
   showed a high variability of their congener profile even though the six
   PCBs indicators stood for 49.8\% of the total PCBs. In the muscle of
   brown trout the Sigma eighteen PCB and the Sigma six PCB concentrations
   were not statistically correlated with the length and the body mass of
   specimens. Total PCB (Sigma eighteen PCBs and Sigma six PCBs)
   concentrations measured in the different sampling sites showed
   significant statistical differences among districts and, in the same
   district, among rivers (p < 0.01). In particular, the lowest PCB levels
   (p < 0.01) were detected in fish caught in Pesaro-Urbino Province rivers
   with the mean total PCB concentrations of 102.4 +/- 6.3 ng/g fat weight
   while the highest PCB levels were measured in specimens coming from
   Macerata Province rivers (1147.8 +/- 456.6 ng/g fat weight). (C) 2012

Abstract = {Polish Friesian male calves (n = 78) were used to investigate the
   effects of innovative feeding plans based on the provision of large
   amounts of solid feeds on growth performance, welfare, and carcass
   characteristics of veal calves. Groups of calves (initial BW 71.5 +/-
   3.7 kg) were fed 1 of 3 treatments (26 calves/treatment): 1) milk
   replacer plus corn grain (CG), 2) milk replacer plus an 80: 20 mixture
   (as-fed basis) of corn grain and wheat straw (CGS), or 3) milk replacer
   plus a 72: 20: 8 mixture (as-fed basis) of corn grain, wheat straw, and
   extruded soybean, respectively (CGSES). All the treatments provided at
   least 170 kg DM/calf from solid feed throughout the 206 d of fattening.
   Type and concentration of milk replacer were the same for all calves
   throughout fattening. Calves fed CGSES received 96\% of the daily amount
   of milk replacer delivered to CG and CGS to balance the dietary CP
   content. No differences (P >= 0.063) among treatments were observed for
   growth performance and DMI. Health status of CG calves was less than
   CGSES calves, as indicated by the greatest (P < 0.001) proportion of
   milk replacer refusal events and the greatest (P< 0.001) incidence of
   treatments for respiratory disorders. Inclusion of straw and soybean in
   the solid feeds increased (P < 0.001) the daily intake of iron in CGS
   and CGSES as compared with CG; however, blood hemoglobin concentrations
   measured at d 5 and 31 were greater (P < 0.05) than when measured on d
   80, 122, and 206 of fattening. Feeding treatment did not (P >= 0.107)
   affect HCW, dressing percentage, or carcass color. Calves fed CG had
   heavier (P < 0.001) reticulorumens and more (P < 0.001) developed rumens
   than CGS and CGSES calves, but 84\% and 68\% of CG rumens (P < 0.001)
   showed overt signs of hyperkeratinization and plaques, respectively.
   These alterations of rumen mucosa were not detected in CGSES calves, and
   only 8\% of CGS calves had rumen plaques. Regardless of feeding
   treatment, postmortem inspection recorded a prevalence of more than 84\%
   abomasal lesions. When feeding veal calves with large amounts of solids,
   it is advisable to avoid the provision of corn grain alone and replace
   part of the cereal with a roughage source to improve calf health and
   prevent rumen mucosa alterations.},

Abstract = {Patients suffering from chronic intestinal diseases (Crohn's disease,
   Ulcerative Colitis, Indeterminate Colitis) are prone to the development
   of pyogenic complications. These complications are most commonly in the
   form of perianal or intraabdominal abscesses and/or fistulas. The
   treatment of these complications are managed differently but, after an
   initial treatment based on medical or minimally invasive management, the
   solution of the pathological condition is always achieved by a surgical
   procedure.
   In the last few years prospective studies have proposed an alternative
   conservative therapeutic approach based on application of fibrin glue in
   the healing of patients with fistulas-in-ano.
   In this paper we suggest and discuss the therapeutic potential of silver
   and quarz in the conservative treatment of anorectal fistulas pointing
   out their role in modulating particular steps of the pathogenetic
   process which characterizes this pathological condition. (C) 2012

Title = {Metabolic stress and inflammatory response in high-yielding,
   periparturient dairy cows},
Journal = {RESEARCH IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {93},
Number = {2},
Pages = {695-704},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Increased disease rates are commonly reported among high-yielding dairy
   cows in the transition period, extending from 3 weeks before to 3 weeks
   after calving, and characterized by the occurrence of an inflammatory
   response in terms of both positive and negative acute phase proteins
   (APP+ and APP-). To determine the above inflammatory response, the
   authors had developed the Liver Functionality Index (LFI), which defines
   the above condition on the basis of some APP- responses (albumin,
   cholesterol sensu stricto + bilirubin) during the first month of
   lactation. In this respect, low LFI values are associated to a high
   inflammatory response and vice versa. The relationship between LFI and
   inflammatory cytokine response was investigated from day -28 to day +28
   with respect to calving in 12 periparturient dairy cows showing the six
   highest and six lowest LFI values within a cohort of 54 high-yielding
   dairy cows. The hypothesis being tested was that LFI and APP- on the
   whole could be used as readout of successful vs. non-successful
   adaptation to the transition period, with a strong association to
   disease occurrence. In fact, low LFI cows experienced many more disease
   cases (13 vs. 3 in high LFI Group) and related drug treatments till day
   +28. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) serum concentrations were always higher in low
   LFI cows (P < 0.05 on day +28). The greater IL-6 levels were correlated
   with higher ceruloplasmin (APP+) and lower lysozyme serum concentrations
   (P < 0.05 and <0.1, respectively). This latter finding was correlated
   with a clear role in vitro of lysozyme in a dose-dependent modulation of
   the inflammatory response of swine intestinal epithelial cells and
   bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Hematological examinations
   showed no significant differences between the two groups under study. On
   the whole, our results indicate that LFI and LFI-related parameters
   could be used to identify cows at risk in the transition period toward
   an improved farm management. Also, our study indicates that disease
   cases in periparturient, high-yielding dairy cows are correlated with
   signs of accentuated IL-6 response and other markers of inflammatory
   phenomena. These likely start in the late lactation period or around
   dry-off, as suggested by our prepartal data, and proceed at much greater
   levels after calving. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {The efficacy of diclazuril in growing rabbits was investigated under
   experimental and field conditions. In a first experimental trial, the
   susceptibility of recent isolated French Eimeria field strains to
   in-feed use of diclazuril, salinomycin and robenidine was studied in
   fattening rabbits. Rabbits were challenged at the age of 31 d with a
   mixed inoculum of Eimeria magna, E. media and E. perforans. Production
   data and oocyst excretion were compared with an infected-untreated
   control group and an uninfected-untreated control group. Infection
   resulted in significantly lower production data and higher oocyst
   excretion in the infected-untreated control group. Salinomycin and
   diclazuril treated rabbits were able to control the infection,
   demonstrated also by comparable weight gain and final weight to those of
   the uninfected-untreated control rabbits and significantly higher than
   those of the infected-untreated control rabbits. Based on the production
   data and oocyst excretion, robenidine was not able to control the
   infection adequately. Economic performance (weight gain, feed intake,
   feed conversion) and oocyst excretion were significantly worse than in
   the uninfected-untreated controls. In a second trial, a 1 yr
   longitudinal study was carried out in Italy to evaluate the excretion of
   coccidia in growing rabbits from 8 meat farms applying a 2-phase
   anticoccidial programme (diclazuril and robenidine). Parasitological
   parameters (oocyst counts and species identification) were measured
   monthly. Seven of the 11 known coccidial rabbit species were identified.
   Variable levels of oocysts per gram were detected in the farms, but on
   all farms lower oocyst per gram and a reduced number of Eimeria spp. in
   rabbit faeces were recorded in the 8-mo treatment period with
   diclazuril.},

Title = {Investigating Avian Influenza Infection Hotspots in Old-World Shorebirds},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 28},
Abstract = {Heterogeneity in the transmission rates of pathogens across hosts or
   environments may produce disease hotspots, which are defined as specific
   sites, times or species associations in which the infection rate is
   consistently elevated. Hotspots for avian influenza virus (AIV) in wild
   birds are largely unstudied and poorly understood. A striking feature is
   the existence of a unique but consistent AIV hotspot in shorebirds
   (Charadriiformes) associated with a single species at a specific
   location and time (ruddy turnstone Arenaria interpres at Delaware Bay,
   USA, in May). This unique case, though a valuable reference, limits our
   capacity to explore and understand the general properties of AIV
   hotspots in shorebirds. Unfortunately, relatively few shorebirds have
   been sampled outside Delaware Bay and they belong to only a few
   shorebird families; there also has been a lack of consistent
   oropharyngeal sampling as a complement to cloacal sampling. In this
   study we looked for AIV hotspots associated with other shorebird species
   and/or with some of the larger congregation sites of shorebirds in the
   old world. We assembled and analysed a regionally extensive dataset of
   AIV prevalence from 69 shorebird species sampled in 25 countries across
   Africa and Western Eurasia. Despite this diverse and extensive coverage
   we did not detect any new shorebird AIV hotspots. Neither large
   shorebird congregation sites nor the ruddy turnstone were consistently
   associated with AIV hotspots. We did, however, find a low but widespread
   circulation of AIV in shorebirds that contrast with the absence of AIV
   previously reported in shorebirds in Europe. A very high AIV antibody
   prevalence coupled to a low infection rate was found in both first-year
   and adult birds of two migratory sandpiper species, suggesting the
   potential existence of an AIV hotspot along their migratory flyway that
   is yet to be discovered.},

Abstract = {We report the genetic and biological characterisation of a novel
   pantropic canine coronavirus (CCoV), strain 450/07, which caused the
   death of a 60-day-old miniature pinscher. At the genetic level, this
   virus was strictly related to the prototype strain CB/05, but displayed
   some unique features. After experimental infection with the new
   pantropic isolate, most inoculated dogs showed diarrhoea and acute
   lymphopenia. Gross lesions and histological changes were mainly evident
   in the gut and lymphoid tissues, although some animals showed remarkable
   changed also in parenchymatous organs. The viral RNA was detected in the
   faeces and/or internal organs of most pups. These findings seem to
   indicate that strain 450/07 is able to spread to internal organs (mainly
   lymphoid tissues), causing lymphopenia but inducing a mild disease. (C)

Title = {EU-Approved Rapid Tests for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy Detect
   Atypical Forms: A Study for Their Sensitivities},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 11},
Abstract = {Since 2004 it become clear that atypical bovine spongiform
   encephalopthies (BSEs) exist in cattle. Whenever their detection has
   relied on active surveillance plans implemented in Europe since 2001 by
   rapid tests, the overall and inter-laboratory performance of these
   diagnostic systems in the detection of the atypical strains has not been
   studied thoroughly to date. To fill this gap, the present study reports
   on the analytical sensitivity of the EU-approved rapid tests for
   atypical L-and H-type and classical BSE in parallel. Each test was
   challenged with two dilution series, one created from a positive pool of
   the three BSE forms according to the EURL standard method of homogenate
   preparation (50\% w/v) and the other as per the test kit manufacturer's
   instructions. Multilevel logistic models and simple logistic models with
   the rapid test as the only covariate were fitted for each BSE form
   analyzed as directed by the test manufacturer's dilution protocol. The
   same schemes, but excluding the BSE type, were then applied to compare
   test performance under the manufacturer's versus the water protocol. The
   IDEXX HerdChek (R) BSE-scrapie short protocol test showed the highest
   sensitivity for all BSE forms. The IDEXX (R) HerdChek BSE-scrapie ultra
   short protocol, the Prionics (R) - Check WESTERN and the AJ Roboscreen
   (R) BetaPrion tests showed similar sensitivities, followed by the Roche
   (R) PrionScreen, the Bio-Rad (R) TeSeE (TM) SAP and the Prionics (R) -
   Check PrioSTRIP in descending order of analytical sensitivity. Despite
   these differences, the limit of detection of all seven rapid tests
   against the different classes of material set within a 2 log(10) range
   of the best-performing test, thus meeting the European Food Safety
   Authority requirement for BSE surveillance purposes. These findings
   indicate that not many atypical cases would have been missed
   surveillance since 2001 which is important for further epidemiological
   interpretations of the sporadic character of atypical forms.},

Title = {Transforming growth factor-beta1 induces microvascular abnormalities
   through a down-modulation of neural cell adhesion molecule in human
   hepatocellular carcinoma},

Abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a very angiogenic and malignant
   cancer. Conventional chemotherapy is poorly effective because of the
   abnormal structural organization of HCC-infiltrating vessels. In
   previous work, we demonstrated that HCC angiogenesis is driven by
   transforming growth factor beta-1(TGF-beta 1)/CD105 axis, stimulating
   liver-derived microvascular endothelial cells (Ld-MECs) migration. As
   TGF-beta 1 also affects mural cells (MCs) recruitment and maturation, we
   asked whether it may contribute to HCC-induced vascular abnormalities.
   HCC and adjacent non-neoplastic liver (nNL) biopsies obtained from 12
   patients were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for angiogenic markers
   CD105, TGF-beta 1, CD44 and vascular endothelial growth factor-a (VEGFa)
   and for MC markers NG2, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha SMA) and neural
   cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). The same markers were also investigated
   by immunocytochemistry on cultured HCC-derived stromal cells (HCC-StCs)
   and nNL-derived StCs (nNL-StCs) isolated from the same liver biopsies.
   Angiogenic factors released by StCs were analyzed by ELISA and the
   interaction between StCs and Ld-MECs by adhesion assay. Compared with
   nNL, HCC biopsies showed increased angiogenic markers and alpha SMA that
   was localized in vessels. By contrast, NG2 and NCAM were substantially
   localized in tumor cells but absent in vessels and stroma. Cultured
   HCC-StCs showed less expression of NG2, alpha SMA and NCAM. They also
   demonstrated a lower capacity to release angiogenic factors and adhered
   on Ld-MECs. HCC-StCs and nNL-StCs treated with TGF-beta 1 or with of
   HepG2 (a human hepatoma cell line) derived conditioned medium (CM),
   down-modulated NCAM expression, whereas anti-NCAM antibodies
   significantly reduced the adhesion of StCs to Ld-MECs. By further
   blocking TGF-beta 1 with anti-TGF-beta 1 antibodies or with Ly-364947 (a
   specific inhibitor TGF-beta 1-receptor) adhesion to Ld-MECs and NCAM
   expression respectively was partially restored. TGF-beta 1 contributes
   to HCC-induced vascular alterations by affecting the interaction between
   HCC-StCs and Ld-MECs through a down-modulation of NCAM expression.

Abstract = {Information technology has embraced the ontological approach to expand
   its capacity to deal with knowledge of different kinds. The subsequent
   combination of formal concerns and philosophical considerations has led
   to the development of new knowledge systems that rely on foundational
   distinctions of entity type such as object, process, property and role.
   This change has attracted attention to the distinction between types of
   entity in the enterprise. The result is a compartmentalisation of the
   information, which, although well motivated and technically fruitful, is
   not always optimal for knowledge management (KM) tasks where one aims at
   an integrated view of information. This paper focuses on the notion of
   knowledge object understood as a formal construct for knowledge
   modelling and KM systems. The approach starts from formal and
   ontological analysis with an eye to modelling knowledge at large. The
   paper motivates the introduction of a notion of knowledge object as a
   new type of entity that emerges from the explicit interaction of
   material entities, information entities and roles within an enterprise.
   The main goals of this work are: to discuss the capacity of knowledge
   objects to tie knowledge and roles in an (enterprise) context; to model
   aspects of enterprise knowledge that escape standard ontological
   approaches; and to describe knowledge objects as a conceptual tool that
   can be integrated within existing formal systems. Knowledge Management

Abstract = {In Europe, three major swine influenza viral (Sly) subtypes (H1N1, H1N2
   and H3N2) have been isolated in pigs. Developing a test that is able to
   detect and identify the subtype of the circulating strain rapidly during
   an outbreak of respiratory disease in the pig population is of essential
   importance. This study describes two multiplex RT-PCRs which distinguish
   the haemagglutinin (HA) gene and the neuraminidase (NA) gene of the
   three major subtypes of SIV circulating in Europe. The HA PCR was able
   to identify the lineage (avian or human) of the HA of H1 subtypes. The
   analytical sensitivity of the test, considered to be unique, was
   assessed using three reference viruses. The detection limit corresponded
   to 1 x 10(-1) TCID50/200 mu l for avian-like H1N1, 1 x 10(0) TCID50/200
   mu l for human-like H1N2 and 1 x 10(1) TOD50/200 mu l for H3N2 SIV. The
   multiplex RT-PCR was first carried out on a collection of 70 isolated
   viruses showing 100\% specificity and then on clinical samples, from
   which viruses had previously been isolated, resulting in an 89\%
   positive specificity of the viral subtype. Finally, the test was able to
   identify the viral subtype correctly in 56\% of influenza A positive
   samples, from which SIV had not been isolated previously. It was also
   possible to identify mixed viral infections and the circulation of a
   reassortant strain before performing genomic studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {Since 2008, the analyses carried out in the Lombardia region as part of
   National Residue Control Plans have evidenced unexpected frequent
   detection of the corticosteroid prednisolone (PRED) in cow urine samples
   taken to the slaughterhouse. Considering the scarce plausibility of
   these high frequent findings, analytical investigations were started to
   ascertain the real presence of this corticosteroid. The applied
   confirmatory method involved liquid-chromatography low-resolution tandem
   mass spectrometry (triple quadrupole) as instrumental technique, and it
   was validated in compliance with the requirements of the Commission
   Decision 2002/657/EC. However, recently some criticism regarding
   Commission Decision 2002/657/EC identification criteria has been pointed
   out, experimentally demonstrating false positive results (wrong
   identification) although these criteria have been strictly observed.
   Therefore, considering the serious implications (i.e. the possibility
   that PRED could be considered endogenous in particular animal
   conditions), studies were carried out to investigate the reliability of
   PRED identification through the change of the chromatographic conditions
   (mobile phases, gradient and analytical column) of the confirmatory
   procedure routinely applied. Further confirmation came from the
   application of high-resolution mass spectrometry technique (MS2 and MS3
   experiments) to analyze incurred cow urines samples. All the obtained
   results confirmed definitively the real presence of this corticosteroid
   excluding false-positive findings in routine analysis. In addition,
   other experiments demonstrated that high-resolution mass spectrometers
   (Time of Flight and Orbitrap technologies) could be successfully applied
   to routine determination of steroid residues in biological fluids at
   very low concentrations (< 1?mu g?L-1). Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {A reliable and accurate analytical method was developed and validated
   for the quantitative determination of polyphosphates (diphosphate,
   triphosphate, trimetaphosphate and tetrapolyphosphate) in products of
   animal origin (meat, dairy and fish products) by ion chromatography with
   suppressed conductivity detection. The chromatographic separations were
   accomplished by using an anion-exchange column eluted with a sodium
   hydroxide gradient. The method validation, performed according to
   Regulation 882/2004/EC and Decision 657/2002/EC, provided results
   conform with the European Directives with respect to linearity (R >
   0.996), specificity, precision (CV a parts per thousand currency sign
   4.5 \%), recovery (ranging from 87.2 to 101.1 \%), detection and
   quantification limits and ruggedness. The method reliability was
   confirmed evaluating the method measurement uncertainty, lower than 7.5
   \% and by proficiency test results. Finally, the method ability to
   discriminate samples treated from those not-treated with polyphosphates
   was verified by analyzing commercial samples containing polyphosphates
   (cooked ham, wurstel, corned beef, processed cheese and surimi) or
   treated in-house with polyphosphates (pangasius fillets, shrimps and
   cuttlefishes).},

Abstract = {Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is an infectious and potentially fatal
   viral disease of equids. EIA virus is usually transmitted from horse to
   horse by large biting insects, such as horseflies. The aim of this study
   was to evaluate the results of a national surveillance plan from 2007 to
   2009 and evaluate the potential risk factors of EIA in horse populations
   in central Italy. In 2007, 18 of 6,773; in 2008, 30 of 7,940; and in
   2009, 21 of 11,666 equines tested were seropositive for EIA. No
   statistical association was found between location or sex and the
   diagnosis of EIA. The seroprevalence rate (2007-2008-2009) was higher
   among older equids (older than 6 years) than among young (3 months to 5
   years old) (P < .05). Likewise, the seroprevalence rate (2007-2008-2009)
   was higher among mules than among other horses (P < .05). Until 2007,
   the national equine register did not exist in Italy; therefore, it was
   difficult to measure the percentage of untested horses that presented a
   real but unquantified risk for continued EIA virus transmission. By
   introducing new laws governing the control and conducting active
   surveillance for EIA, it has been possible, in Italy, to develop a firm
   foundation of knowledge concerning the persistence and transmission of
   EIA and the risk factors and to better control the spread of this
   infection in horses. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A retrospective study on burden of human echinococcosis based on

Abstract = {Cystic Echinococcosis (CE) is an infective zoonosis that represents a
   worldwide important public health problem. In humans, its manifestations
   may range from asymptomatic infection to severe disease and possible
   death, and lead to economic losses from treatment costs and lost wages.
   Recent studies suggest that this disease has a large social impact in
   endemic areas, and estimates of burden in terms of monetary and
   no-monetary impact on human health are essential to allocate financial
   and technical resources. In Sardinia, the most affected Italian region
   per number of inhabitants. CE is still endemic, although three
   eradication campaigns have been carried out in 1962, 1978, and 1987,
   respectively. To date, the burden of human CE in Sardinia remains poorly
   defined. In this work, a retrospective study was carried out using
   public Hospital Discharge Records spanning from 2001 to 2009. During
   these years, a total of 1409 discharges were recorded: 1196(84.88\%)
   records corresponding to patients hospitalized for symptoms directly
   correlated to CE (primary diagnosis), and 213 (15.11\%) records
   corresponding to patients hospitalized for symptoms not directly
   correlated to CE and with an afterwards or concurrent diagnosis of
   echinococcosis made during the hospitalization (secondary diagnosis).
   The annual regional average record (discharge rate) was 9.3/100,000
   inhabitants. Direct cost associated with diagnosis, surgery or
   chemotherapy, medical care, and hospitalization in humans were evaluated
   in this work. Furthermore, burden of disease was also evaluated by using
   the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), the preferred disease-burden
   measure of the World Health Organization. Knowing the burden of human CE
   in Sardinia is extremely important to enable the prioritization of
   control measures for this preventable neglected disease. This is the
   first study describing the measure of the overall disease burden in an
   Italian region endemic for this disease, performed by calculating the
   number of CE patients from Hospital Discharge Records. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {Prion protein (PrP) is encoded by the PRNP gene, which is highly
   polymorphic in goats, with polymorphisms encoding amino acid
   substitutions at the protein level. In the current study, the reactivity
   of monoclonal antibody (mAb) F99/97.6.1 in binding PrP from goats
   polymorphic at PRNP codon 222 was investigated. Nervous tissue from 30
   scrapie-negative goats with 3 different genotypes (222Q/Q, 222Q/K, and
   222K/K) was analyzed by Western blot using mAbs P4 and F99/97.6.1.
   Although PrP was detected in all 30 samples by mAb P4, detection of PrP
   by mAb F99/97.6.1 was limited to 222Q/Q (12/12). No PrP was detected by
   mAb F99/97.6.1 in the 222K/K samples (n = 6), and the signal intensity
   of mAb F99/97.6.1 for PrP was lower for the 222Q/K samples (12/12
   samples). To further investigate these results, additional Western blot
   analyses were performed, and the PrP signals detected by mAbs F99/97.6.1
   and SAF84 were then quantified. The mean F99/SAF84 ratio (+/- standard
   deviation) calculated for the 222Q/Q group was 0.73 +/- 1.26, and the
   mean for the 222Q/K group was 0.27 +/- 1.31. Statistical analysis of
   these values evidenced statistically significant differences between the
   222Q/Q and 222Q/K samples. The results of the study thus revealed an
   inhibition by lysine at position 222 on the binding of mAb F99/97.6.1 to
   goat PrP. This has implications for the use of mAb F99/97.6.1 for
   diagnostic purposes. Because the 222K allele could be a target for
   genetic selection in goats, the differential reactivity of mAb
   F99/97.6.1 could be exploited with a genotyping test setup.},

Title = {Occurrence of toxigenic Clostridium difficile in edible bivalve molluscs},
Journal = {FOOD MICROBIOLOGY},

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {Clostridium difficile is an anaerobic bacterium commonly considered to
   be responsible for antibiotic-associated gastrointestinal diseases,
   ranging from diarrhea of varying severity to pseudomembranous colitis.
   The aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of C. difficile in
   marine edible bivalve molluscs, which, as filter feeding organisms, are
   able to accumulate particles suspended in water, including
   microorganisms. Samples of Mytilus galloprovincialis, Tapes
   philippinarum, and Venus verrucosa were collected from mussel farms and
   fishmongers in the province of Naples (Southern Italy). C. difficile was
   found in 49\% of the 53 samples investigated. Sixteen isolates were
   grouped in 12 known different PCR ribotypes (001, 002, 003, 010, 012,
   014/020, 018, 045, 070, 078, 106, and 126), whereas 10 additional
   isolates were grouped in 8 new PCR riboprofiles. Two toxinotypes (0 and
   V) were found. Fifty eight percent of the isolates were toxigenic. These
   findings indicate that toxigenic C. difficile strains can be isolated in
   bivalve molluscs. Marine filter feeding organisms, therefore, may be
   considered as reservoir of toxigenic strains of C. difficile. The
   ingestion of raw or poorly cooked contaminated seafood and the high
   temperature resistance of the spore-forming C. difficile could represent
   an important source of exposure and pose human health concern. (C) 2012

Abstract = {Aims To investigate Norovirus (NoV) contamination of mussels, clams and
   oysters harvested in two class B harvesting areas of the delta of the Po
   river, to choose a species as an indicator. Methods and Results
   Environmental parameters (temperature and salinity) and hydrometric
   levels of the tributary river were measured. Seventy shellfish samples
   (35 samples per area) were examined for Escherichia coli and NoV (GI and
   GII). NoV contamination was found in 51.4\% of samples, of which, 2.9\%
   contained only NoV GI, 14.3\% only NoV GII, while the majority of the
   samples (34.3\%) contained both genogroups. Most of the positive results
   (90.0\%) were obtained in the period between November 2008 and April
   2009. Conclusions No significant differences were found between the
   results from the two harvesting areas and the three shellfish species.
   However, on the basis of the average Ct values, the recovery rate (from
   0.46 to 1.15\%) and the distribution of positive results in the
   samplings, mussels seem to be a suitable indicator species to monitor
   viral contamination in these areas. Significance and Impact of the Study
   The data allow the optimization of monitoring plans to improve the
   prevention strategies in terms of money and time, by the intensification
   of controls in the cold season and the use of one species as indicator.},

Abstract = {To compare the real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase
   chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays used for the diagnosis of Porcine
   reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a Europe-wide
   interlaboratory ring trial was conducted. A variety of PRRSV strains
   including North American (NA) and European (EU) genotype isolates were
   analyzed by the participants. Great differences regarding qualitative
   diagnostics as well as analytical sensitivity were observed between the
   individual RT-qPCR systems, especially when investigating strains from
   the EU genotype. None of the assays or commercial kits used in the ring
   trial could identify all different PRRSV strains with an optimal
   analytical and diagnostic sensitivity. The genetic variability of the
   PRRSV strains, which is supposed to hinder the diagnostic of the RT-PCR
   because of mutations at the primer binding sites, was also confirmed by
   sequencing and subsequent phylogenetic analysis. In summary, a major
   problem in PRRSV diagnostics by RT-qPCR is false-negative results. To
   achieve maximum safety in the molecular diagnosis of PRRSV, the combined
   usage of different assays or kits is highly recommended.},

Volume = {54},

Abstract = {Background: Since 1999, field evidence of transplacental infection by
   porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and reproductive failure has been
   reported in pigs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the
   clinical and pathological consequences of PCV2 infection in conventional
   PCV2-seropositive gilts by insemination with PCV2b-spiked semen.
   Results: Six PCV2 seropositive gilts were inseminated with
   PCV2b-supplemented semen (infected) and three animals with semen and
   cell culture medium (controls). Only three out of the six infected
   animals were pregnant by ultrasonography on day 29 after insemination,
   while two out of the three controls were pregnant. One control gilt
   aborted on day 23 after insemination but not due to PVC2. Viraemia was
   demonstrated in four out of six infected and in one control gilt that
   became infected with PCV2a. Anti-PCV2 antibody titres showed dynamic
   variations in the infected group throughout the study. Among infected
   gilts, the animal with the lowest anti-PCV2 titre (1/100) at the
   beginning of the experiment and another that reached a similar low value
   during the experiment showed evident seroconversion over time and had
   also PCV2 positive foetuses. One placenta displayed mild focal necrosis
   of the chorionic epithelium positively stained by immunohistochemistry
   for PCV2 antigen.
   Conclusions: PCV2-seropositive gilts can be infected with PCV2 after
   intrauterine exposure and low maternal antibody titre may increase the
   probability of a foetal infection.},

Abstract = {The assessment of fox immunity following oral rabies vaccination (ORV)
   is commonly applied to assess the efficacy of an ORV campaign in the
   field. Several ELISA kits have been developed and validated for their
   use for rabies serology in wildlife as an alternative to neutralizing
   techniques (NT), such as the fluorescent antibody virus neutralization
   test (FAVN) and the rapid fluorescent foci inhibition test (RFFIT). At a
   European level. NT and ELISA tests are used interchangeably and on
   different types of samples collected for vaccination follow-up. This has
   resulted in a difficulty in comparing the results generated with
   different diagnostic tools. We have evaluated (a) the effect of two
   different matrices commonly used for serology in red foxes on the
   results of the FAVN and (b) the performance of two commercially
   available ELISAs in comparison with the FAVN, as a gold standard, using
   a panel of over 700 field fox samples. Moderate agreement was observed
   when comparing results from different matrices. We found a very low
   level of agreement and low values of relative sensitivity and
   specificity of the ELISAs tested in comparison with the FAVN. Our
   findings confirm, using a vast collection afield samples obtained during
   post-vaccination surveillance campaigns in Italy, the need for improved
   reliability of certain serological tests. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {A West Nile virus (WNV) strain belonging to lineage 2 was for the first
   time detected in two pools of Culex pipiens collected in the province of
   Udine and in tissues of a wild collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto)
   found dead in the province of Treviso, in North East of Italy. It was
   molecularly identified by group and WNV lineage specific RT-PCRs and
   characterized by partial sequencing of the NS3 and NS5 genes. When
   compared with the sequences of same fragments of NS3 and NS5 of the WNV
   lineage 2 strain isolated from birds of prey in Hungary (2004), the
   phylogenetic analysis of these sequences revealed 100\% and 99\%
   similarity, respectively. As the Hungarian strain, the NS3 selected
   sequence differed from the 2010 Greek isolate by one amino-acid located
   at 249 site which is the site involved in genetic modulation of WNV
   pathogenicity. The Italian and Hungarian strains have histidine rather
   than proline at this site. The presence of a lineage 2 strain in regions
   where the lineage 1 strain is still circulating, creates a new scenario
   with unpredictable consequences. In this situation comprehensive
   investigations on the occurrence, ecology, and epidemiology of these
   different WNV strains circulating in Italy become the highest priority.

Abstract = {Gastrointestinal disorders, constipation in particular, are the most
   common non-motor dysfunctions affecting Parkinson's disease (PD)
   patients. We have previously reported that rats bearing unilateral
   nigrostriatal lesion caused by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) stereotaxic
   injection develop severe constipation together with a region-specific
   decrease of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in enteric neurons of
   the lower intestinal tract. Here, we extend these observations on other
   enteric neuronal subpopulations, investigating also the propulsive
   activity of isolated colonic specimens. Four weeks post 6-OHDA
   injection, lesioned rats showed a significant increase of vasoactive
   intestinal polypeptide (VIP) concomitant with the reduced expression of
   nNOS in the myenteric plexus of distal ileum and proximal colon: in
   particular VIP increased in a subpopulation of neurons actively
   expressing nNOS. On the other hand, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) was
   not modified in any of the intestinal segments analyzed. Interestingly,
   we found a reduced expression of dopamine receptor type 2 (D2R) in
   proximal (-66.8\%) and distal (-54.5\%) colon, together with reduced
   peristalsis efficiency (decrease in intraluminal pressure and frequency
   of peristaltic events) in the 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. The selective
   depletion of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons is associated with
   changes in the expression of enteric inhibitory neurotransmitters, as
   well as of the D2R in intestinal specific regions. Moreover,
   6-OHDA-lesioned rats demonstrated altered colon propulsive activity
   referable to the D2R decrease. Our findings unveil subtle mechanisms
   underlying the enteric neurochemical plasticity events evoked by
   disruption of the normal brain-gut cross-talk, giving a peculiar point
   of view on the pathophysiology of the severe constipation that
   frequently affects PD patients. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {A rapid, sensitive and selective analytical method was developed for the
   quantitative determination of deoxynivalenol (DON) and nivalenol (NIV)
   in cereals intended for human and animal consumption. The method, based
   on liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection, involves an
   automated 2 channel post-column derivatization, performed with sodium
   hydroxide, methyl acetoacetate and ammonium acetate. The chromatographic
   separation was accomplished using a C18 column eluted in isocratic mode
   with a mixture of 0.01\% acetic acid and acetonitrile. Optimal
   fluorescence detection was obtained by an excitation and emission
   wavelength of 360 nm and 470 nm, respectively. The sample preparation
   required a rapid extraction of mycotoxins with water and a purification
   step by hydrophilic-lipophilic balance column clean-up. Under the
   optimized experimental conditions, a complete separation of DON and NIV
   was obtained in less than 20 min. The on-line post-column derivatization
   ensures excellent results in terms of simplicity and sensitivity, with
   limits of detection down to 0.014 mg/kg. The proposed method was
   extensively validated and the analytical performances of linearity
   (correlation coefficient of 0.9998), selectivity, precision (intra-day
   precision lower than 8\%) and recovery (ranging from 89\% to 101\%) were
   evaluated, demonstrating the method feasibility in accurate confirmation
   analyses. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Mycobacterium bovis recognizes as hosts a wide spectrum of animal
   species. In particular epidemiological situations, high prevalence of
   infection is found also in pigs. In the present study, we evaluated the
   capability of the interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) assay to identify pigs
   infected with M. bovis. The results of the immune-diagnosis were
   correlated to the findings of the post mortem inspection and the
   bacterial culture of lymph nodes. Blood samples of 146 pigs, belonging
   to a local breed of Sicily reared in free or semi-free roaming
   conditions, were collected to assess the specificity and the sensibility
   of the IFN-gamma assay. Thirty-one pigs, from M. bovis free herds, did
   not react to the IFN-gamma assay, yielding a specificity of 100\%. The
   IFN-gamma assay identified 15 out of 19 animals positive to the
   bacterial culture and 22 out of 26 animals with tuberculous lesions,
   with a sensibility of 78.9-84.6\%, respectively. Out of 26 reactors to
   the test, 15 pigs (57.7\%) confirmed to be infected after the bacterial
   culture and 22 (84.6\%) had tuberculous lesions. The IFN-gamma assay was
   able to reveal 4 animals with no visible lesions (NVL). Together, these
   findings support the feasible use of the IFN-gamma assay as an intra
   vitam tool for the surveillance and management of M. bovis infection in
   swine populations. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Tonsils are secondary lymphoid organs that play an important role in
   host defense. The aim of our study was to develop reliable procedures
   for isolation and culture of pig tonsil cells, and to validate their
   possible use in functional immunoassays. Using our isolation procedure,
   we recovered on average 238.7 +/- 107.1 x 10(6) cells per tonsil couple
   with a mean vitality of 89.8 +/- 2.7\%. These values significantly
   decreased 8 months after freezing at -80 degrees C along with the
   subsequent spontaneous release of both IgA and IgG in culture. These
   results suggest to use pig tonsil cells within 2 months from thawing to
   maintain suitable conditions in terms of recovery, vitality and release
   of antibody in vitro. Tonsil mononuclear cells also showed the ability
   to secrete antimicrobial peptides and to respond in vitro to
   immunological stimuli. On the whole, our study has defined operating
   conditions for tonsil processing, control of bacterial contaminations,
   time limits of storage at -80 degrees C, as well as for evaluating
   polyclonal Ig production in vitro. Such procedures are likely to be of
   some importance in studies on regional immunity aid in the development
   of large animal models for biomedical sciences. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Identification of serum proteomic biomarkers for early porcine
   reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) infection},
Journal = {PROTEOME SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {Background: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one
   of the most significant swine diseases worldwide. Despite its relevance,
   serum biomarkers associated with early-onset viral infection, when
   clinical signs are not detectable and the disease is characterized by a
   weak anti-viral response and persistent infection, have not yet been
   identified. Surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time of flight
   mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) is a reproducible, accurate, and simple
   method for the identification of biomarker proteins related to disease
   in serum. This work describes the SELDI-TOF MS analyses of sera of 60
   PRRSV-positive and 60 PRRSV-negative, as measured by PCR, asymptomatic
   Large White piglets at weaning. Sera with comparable and low content of
   hemoglobin (< 4.52 mu g/mL) were fractionated in 6 different fractions
   by anion-exchange chromatography and protein profiles in the mass range
   1-200 kDa were obtained with the CM10, IMAC30, and H50 surfaces.
   Results: A total of 200 significant peaks (p < 0.05) were identified in
   the initial discovery phase of the study and 47 of them were confirmed
   in the validation phase. The majority of peaks (42) were up-regulated in
   PRRSV-positive piglets, while 5 were down-regulated. A panel of 14
   discriminatory peaks identified in fraction 1 (pH = 9), on the surface
   CM10, and acquired at low focus mass provided a serum protein profile
   diagnostic pattern that enabled to discriminate between PRRSV-positive
   and -negative piglets with a sensitivity and specificity of 77\% and
   73\%, respectively.
   Conclusions: SELDI-TOF MS profiling of sera from PRRSV-positive and
   PRRSV-negative asymptomatic piglets provided a proteomic signature with
   large scale diagnostic potential for early identification of PRRSV
   infection in weaning piglets. Furthermore, SELDI-TOF protein markers
   represent a refined phenotype of PRRSV infection that might be useful
   for whole genome association studies.},

Title = {Evaluation of thymus morphology and serum cortisol concentration as
   indirect biomarkers to detect low-dose dexamethasone illegal treatment
   in beef cattle},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {8},
Month = {AUG 3},
Abstract = {Background: Corticosteroids are illegally used in several countries as
   growth promoters in veal calves and beef cattle, either alone or in
   association with sex steroids and beta-agonists, especially at low
   dosages and primarily through oral administration, in order to enhance
   carcasses and meat quality traits. The aim of the present study is to
   evaluate the reliability of the histological evaluation of the thymus,
   as well as the serum cortisol determination, in identifying beef cattle,
   treated with two different dexamethasone-based growth-promoting
   protocols and the application of different withdrawal times before
   slaughter.
   Results: Our findings demonstrate that low dosages of dexamethasone
   (DXM), administered alone or in association with clenbuterol as growth
   promoter in beef cattle, induce morphologic changes in the thymus,
   resulting in increase fat infiltration with concurrent cortical atrophy
   and reduction of the cortex/medulla ratio (C/M). In fact, the C/M value
   was significantly lower in treated animals than in control ones, with
   both the protocols applied. The cut off value of 0.93 for the
   cortex/medulla ratio resulted to be highly effective to distinguish
   control and treated animals. The animals treated with DXM showed
   inhibition of cortisol secretion during the treatment period, as well as
   at the slaughterhouse, 3 days after treatment suspension. The animals
   treated with lower doses of DXM in association with clenbuterol, showed
   inhibition of cortisol secretion during the treatment period, but serum
   cortisol concentration was restored to physiological levels at
   slaughterhouse, 8 days after treatment suspension.
   Conclusions: The histological evaluation of thymus morphology, and
   particularly of the C/M may represent a valuable and reproducible method
   applicable to large-scale screening programs, due to the easy sampling
   procedures at slaughterhouse, as well as time and cost-saving of the
   analysis. Serum cortisol determination could be considered as an useful
   in vivo biomarker of dexamethasone illegal treatment in beef cattle
   during the fattening period, whilst it does not appear to be a good
   biomarker at the slaughterhouse, since the protocol of DXM
   administration, as well as the withdrawal period could affect the
   reliability of the method.},

Abstract = {Several investigations have studied the influence of polyunsaturated
   fatty acids on the immune function of ruminants but many contradictory
   observations have been reported in this field. The aim of this study was
   to evaluate the influence of an extruded linseed dietary supplementation
   on the immune response and oxidative stress in the transition dairy ewe.
   The experiment was performed using 58 Sarda pluriparous ewes, 42
   pregnant (T) and 16 non-pregnant and non-lactating (NP). Both groups
   were fed an isoenergetic and isonitrogenous diet from 60 d before to 15
   d after lambing of the T ewes. Within each physiological state, one
   sub-group received a commercial pelleted concentrate (CTR) and the other
   an extruded linseed-enriched (10 g/100 g) concentrate (EL). Blood
   samples were collected from all animals at -28, -21, -14, -7, +3 and +15
   d to parturition, based on expected date of lambing of the T ewes, to
   evaluate the innate immunity (serum lysozyme, haemolytic complement and
   bactericidal activity), the acquired immunity and the oxidative stress.
   The dietary supplementation with extruded linseed did not markedly
   influence the innate immunity response of the animals. The antibody
   production against Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar
   Abortusovis was shown to be increased by the linseed-enriched diet in
   the T ewes (2.37 vs. 2.19 log(10) for the T and the NP ewes,
   respectively). As for the cell-mediated immunity, no differences between
   dietary treatments were observed. The extruded linseed-enriched diet was
   able to induce a transitory overproduction of oxidants in the NP ewes,
   whereas no effects were observed in the T ewes. In conclusion, under the
   adopted experimental conditions, the use of extruded linseed in the diet
   did not greatly affect the oxidative state and the immune response of
   the transition ewe. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Tick-borne diseases affect small ruminants in tropical and subtropical
   regions. In sheep and goats, these diseases are not well characterized
   although breeding of these species is the main livestock resource in
   some regions. Ticks transmit viruses (tick-borne encephalitis, Thogoto
   virus), bacteria (Rickettsiales, Borrelia, Francisella) and protozoa
   (Babesia and Theileria) to small ruminants some of which cause also
   zoonotic diseases (e.g. Crimean Congo Haemorrhagic Fever virus, Coxiella
   burnetti, Anaplasma phagocytophilum). The aim of the paper is to provide
   an overview of the main diseases due to pathogens belonging to genera
   Anaplasma, Babesia and Theileria in small ruminants. The authors also
   report the results of surveys on small ruminants for anaplasmosis and
   piroplasmosis. Anaplasma ovis is the main etiological agent of
   anaplasmosis with a prevalence of 82.9\% for sheep and 74.9\% for goats,
   prevalences for Anaplasma phagocytophilum were, respectively, 11.9\% and
   15.2\%. Protozoa were present with lower prevalences and the species
   present were not very virulent, the higher prevalence found was for
   Theileria ovis 17.7\% for sheep and 1.6\% for goats. The
   characterization of these pathogens is important to develop effective
   control measures to prevent diseases in animals and humans and improve
   animal well-being and production. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Selling fish products as fresh when they have actually been frozen and
   thawed is a common fraudulent practice in seafood retailing. Unlike fish
   products frozen to protect them against degenerative changes during
   transportation and to extend the product's storage life, fish intended
   for raw consumption in European countries must be previously frozen at
   -20 degrees C for at least 24 h to kill parasites. The aim of this study
   was to use histological analysis to distinguish between fresh and
   frozen-thawed fish and to evaluate this method for use as a routine
   screening technique in compliance with the requirements of European
   Commission Regulation No. 882/2004 on official food and feed controls.
   Method performance (i.e., accuracy and precision) was evaluated on
   tissue samples from three common Mediterranean fish species; the
   evaluation was subsequently extended to include samples from 35 fish
   species in a second experiment to test for method robustness. Method
   accuracy was tested by comparing histological results against a ``gold
   standard{''} obtained from the analysis of frozen and unfrozen fish
   samples prepared for the study. Method precision was evaluated according
   to interrater agreement (i.e., three laboratories with expertise in
   histopathology in the first experiment and three expert analysts in the
   second experiment) by estimating Cohen's kappa (and corresponding 95\%
   confidence intervals) for each pair of laboratories and experts and the
   combined Cohen's kappa for all three experts and laboratories. The
   observed interrater agreement among the three laboratories and the three
   experts indicated high levels of method accuracy and precision (high
   sensitivity and specificity) and method reproducibility. Our results
   suggest that histology is a rapid, simple, and highly accurate method
   for distinguishing between fresh and frozen-thawed fish, regardless of
   the fish species analyzed.},

Abstract = {The aim of this experiment was to study consumer acceptability and
   composition of Pecorino cheese obtained from ewes fed an extruded
   linseed-enriched diet. Sixty lactating Sarda ewes were randomly assigned
   to 3 dietary treatments: (1) control concentrate (CTR); (2) concentrate
   enriched with 100 g/kg of extruded linseed (EL-10); (3) concentrate
   enriched with 200 g/kg of extruded linseed (EL-20), that were all
   administered along with ad libitum alfalfa hay. Cheeses were made with
   the bulk milk obtained from the 3 groups. The results showed that the
   diet affected cheese composition after 60 days of ripening. Linseed
   supplementation decreased protein and fat content while it increased the
   concentration of monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and long-chain fatty
   acids in both EL-10 and EL-20 cheeses. The extruded linseed-enriched
   diets improved the n-3 fatty acid and conjugated linoleic acid contents
   and decreased the n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratio. A consumer panel evaluated
   the cheeses for color, eyeness, toughness, Pecorino cheese odor,
   Pecorino cheese flavor, extraneous odors and flavors and overall
   acceptability. Although EL-10 and EL-20 cheeses differed from the CTR
   cheese for some sensory profile attributes, all groups proved similar
   for overall acceptability and presence of extraneous odors and flavors.
   A triangle test showed no differences among dietary treatments.
   Furthermore, when a MOS sensor array, composed of six metal oxide
   sensors, was used to evaluate the three types of cheeses, no differences
   were found among groups. Extruded linseed supplementation seems
   therefore a possible strategy for improving the nutritional quality of
   lipids in Pecorino cheese without affecting its sensory properties. (c)

Abstract = {Olfactory communication is an important aspect of the biology of ground
   squirrels; accordingly, some of their integumentary glands are
   associated with scent-marking behavior. Although reports of neoplasms in
   ground squirrels are limited, the literature on tumors in this family of
   rodents is extensive, with hepatocellular carcinomas in woodchucks and
   fibromas in squirrels being the 2 most common neoplasms. Apocrine gland
   tumors occur frequently in domestic animals such as cats and dogs but to
   our knowledge have not previously been reported in squirrels. Here we
   describe 2 cases of adenocarcinoma of the dorsal glands in privately
   owned European ground squirrels (Spemophilus citellus). The skin nodules
   were characterized histologically by proliferation of epithelial cells,
   which were arranged in a tubuloacinar pattern with neoplastic emboli
   within the blood vessels. Adenocarcinoma of the dorsal glands was
   diagnosed in light of the anatomic localization, immunohistochemistry
   results, and histochemistry findings.},

Abstract = {Reliable figures of local distribution and prevalence of cystic
   echinococcosis (CE) in intermediate hosts are a fundamental prerequisite
   for implementation of control strategies against cystic echinococcosis
   (CE), caused by Echinococcus granulosus. With the aim to assess the
   ``true{''} prevalence of CE in a mountain area of Piedmont region
   (North-Western Italy), two methods alternative to use of official
   abattoir data were compared: (i) the necroscopic examination of 117
   sheep and goats, killed during wolf attacks while on summer pastures,
   for presence of hydatid cysts; (ii) the serological examination with an
   enzyme-linked immuno-electro transfer blot assay (EITB) of 1217 sheep
   from 9 transhumant flocks for presence of anti-Echinococcus antibodies.
   EITB was first performed on pooled samples, then each serum sample from
   positive pools was individually tested. Prevalences were 15.4 and 10.8\%
   with method (i) and method (ii), respectively, and they resulted not
   statistically different (P> 0.05). Seroreactors (from 4.4 to 46\%) were
   found in 7 of 9 tested flocks. Adult Echinococcus tapeworms were found
   in 2 of 4 necropsied dogs from 3 flocks. On the basis of the results, CE
   prevalence in small ruminants from Piedmont seems to be higher than that
   reported by official abattoir statistics in the last decade. (c) 2012

Abstract = {Aims:similar to To provide an epidemiologic interpretation of a
   suspected outbreak of food poisoning caused by Salmonella enterica
   subspecies enterica serovar Berta strains isolated from humans and from
   the leftovers of the implicated foods (cream, dairy-based desserts and
   eggs). Methods and Results:similar to We have correlated the similarity
   between the strains through genotyping with Pulsed Field Gel
   Electrophoresis (PFGE), studying antimicrobial sensitivity patterns and
   epidemiological investigation. The clonal origin of the outbreak was
   confirmed by all laboratory tests. PFGE analysis of the restriction
   profiles obtained with XbaI and SpeI revealed a certainly correlation
   from the strains isolated from the various sources, while the
   antimicrobial sensitivity pattern was the same in all cases, with all
   strains sensitive to all antibiotics tested. Conclusions:similar to Poor
   hygiene conditions in the facility concerned, lack of hygiene in food
   handling, high summer temperatures and positive cultures from
   asymptomatic staff could all be implicated in the infection, with food
   being the means through which it spread. Significance and Impact of the
   Study:similar to This study describes the first outbreak of food
   poisoning caused by Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar
   Berta (Salmonella Berta) reported in Italy. It confirms the importance
   of correlating epidemiological investigations with genotyping and
   phenotyping to understand the dynamics of infection.},

Abstract = {This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of Anaplasma
   phagocytophilum infection in Equidae and investigate the possibility of
   exposure to the organism in Sicily (Southern Italy). During the study
   blood samples were collected in horses and donkeys housed in five of the
   nine provinces of Sicilian Island. Of 133 horses and 100 donkeys tested,
   respectively 9.0\% and 6.0\% were seroactive (IFAT) with A.
   phagocytophilum antigen. In only 4.7\% of the horses, specific A.
   phagocytophilum DNA was recorded; in donkey, Anaplasma DNA was not
   found. Our results indicate a low prevalence of A. phagocytophilum in
   Sicilian equids. This condition does not justify the exclusion of equids
   from prophylactic plans for this multihost pathogen infection, a
   zoonosis with a wide distribution in other European countries. However,
   further studies are necessary to elucidate the possible mechanisms that
   involve the Equidae as host of this pathogen.},

Abstract = {The glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX), when used as a growth promoter,
   cause morphological and functional alterations in cattle lymphoid organs
   and cells. In the present experiment, the transcriptional effects of an
   illicit DEX protocol upon six target genes were investigated in cattle
   neutrophils (NEU) and lymphocytes (LFC). Blood samples were taken before
   (T-0) and 2, 3, 10, 19,31 and 43 days from the beginning of DEX
   administration (T-1-T-6). Leukocytes were counted and cells isolated by
   gradient centrifugation; then, glutathione peroxidase 1 and 3 (GPX1 and
   GPX3), glucocorticoid receptor alpha (GR alpha), l-selectin, nuclear
   factor kappa B, subunit p65 (NF kappa B) and tumor necrosis factor alpha
   (TNF alpha) mRNA amounts were measured through a quantitative Real Time
   RT-PCR approach. A significant change vs controls in NEU/LFC ratio was
   noticed from T-3 forward. Compared to T-0, DEX significantly increased
   to a variable extent all candidate gene mRNAs abundances in NEU; in
   contrast, only l-selectin, GR alpha and GPX1 were significantly
   up-regulated in LFC. Present results suggest that illicit DEX affects
   transcription in cattle immune cells, that might be considered as a
   promising surrogate tissue for the screening of DEX abuse in cattle
   farming. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {FOOD CONTROL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {26},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Consumer awareness of food safety and nutrition is a major issue in
   relation to healthy lifestyles and disease prevention. Improper consumer
   food management has been implicated in a large number of cases of
   foodborne illnesses. To reduce the risk of foodborne illness, consumers
   must be willing to change behaviours that are not consistent with safe
   food storage and preparation practices. Change in such behaviours is
   strongly related to consumer knowledge of proper food handling
   practices. At the same time there is public consciousness of the role of
   diet in contributing to the health status, but this awareness has not
   led to sufficient improvement of eating habits. What people buy and eat
   and the way they manage food depends not only on the individual but also
   on social, cultural, economic, and environmental factors. Identifying an
   effective strategy to improve consumers' behaviour is a concern for
   politicians and health promoters. Non-targeted spreading of generic
   information is one strategy, but seems to be relatively unsuccessful.
   This paper describes an innovative and effective methodology to improve
   the level of consumer awareness towards healthier food choices and safer
   behaviours based on a holistic approach. This strategy could be adopted
   to better disseminate information regarding healthy foods on a large
   scale and at a relatively low cost, obtaining significant benefits in
   terms of primary prevention and contributing to the amelioration of food
   management at the consumer level. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The proficiency testing (PT) scheme ``AQUA{''} for food microbiology was
   organised by the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie
   (IZSVe) according to ISO/IEC 17043 and ISO/TS 22117. This paper
   describes the IZSVe experience on the application of the above-mentioned
   standards for the PTs, with focus on the Enterobacteriaceae enumeration
   one. Freeze-dried food matrices contaminated with American Type Culture
   Collection bacterial strains were used as test samples for each
   microbiological PT organised by IZSVe. The sample homogeneity and
   stability were verified prior to distribution to participants and
   throughout the PT, respectively. The participating laboratories analysed
   samples using their routine methods, and results were transmitted to
   IZSVe. Data and methods used by each participating laboratory were
   analysed in order to evaluate the laboratory performance. With reference
   to the Enterobacteriaceae PT, the test samples were homogeneous and
   stable. In addition, most laboratory results were obtained using
   equivalent test methods. Statistical approaches applied to analyse data
   generated from all participating laboratories revealed similar outcomes
   as no significant outlying count and only 5 \% of unacceptable results
   were observed. Finally, the z-score, with the standard deviation that
   does not vary from round toround, was applied to compare and to evaluate
   the performance of each laboratory over time highlighting possible
   persistent trends over several rounds.},

Title = {Sheep milk as a potential indicator of environmental exposure to
   dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs)},

Abstract = {Dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls are lipophilic persistent organic
   pollutants which accumulate in the fat tissue of animals. Moreover, in
   mammals, these contaminants are secreted into milk during lactation
   periods. The contamination level of milk is closely related to the
   animal dl-PCBs exposure through diet, inhalation and dermal contact. The
   study of the relationship between the environment in which the animals
   live and the milk contamination level is a key component in assessing
   the presence of pollutants in dairy products. In this paper, soil was
   selected as a reliable matrix of environmental pollution with dl-PCBs as
   it reflects as well the possible contamination of vegetation and air in
   the areas where sheep graze and live. However, dl-PCBs analysis could be
   problematic due to the high cost. To overcome this problem, the approach
   of this study was focused on using GIS and geostatistics to integrate
   data from different research institutions, aiming to assess the
   relationship between milk and soil contaminated with dl-PCBs. Therefore,
   samples of soil and sheep milk collected in Campania (Italy) during 2008
   monitoring plans were introduced in a GIS. The relationship between the
   two variables showed heteroscedasticity, and the global regression
   technique OLS indicated a R-2 of 0.24. To improve the OLS results, the
   altitude was integrated in the GIS considering that this variable can
   influence PCBs contamination. The results showed that altitude is
   strongly related with soil contamination but was not strongly related
   with milk contamination. Thus, analyzing the relationship between milk
   and soil contamination dividing data in three different groups of
   altitude ranges, the R-2 values were higher. Furthermore, this
   correlation changes with the altitude, becoming weaker with higher
   altitude. These results show the possibility to use sheep milk as
   indicator of PCBs contamination at least from sheep bred under 300 m of
   altitude. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The study examined the proximate composition, cholesterol content and
   fatty acid profile of fillet from the most important species captured in
   Italian seas and commonly consumed in the European Union, such as
   anchovy (Engraulis encrasicholus L.), red mullet (Mullus barbatus L.),
   European hake (Merluccius merluccius L.) and Atlantic bonito (Sarda
   sarda L.). The fish were caught in three different geographic areas of
   the Italian seas: south Tyrrhenian (ST), south Adriatic (SA) and Ionian
   (IO). Anchovy from the ST sea had the highest lipid content (2.27\%)
   compared to fish captured in the SA (1.81\%) and IO seas (1.91\%) (P <
   0.01). Red mullet captured in the SA exhibited the highest amount of
   lipid content (7.54\%) compared to fish from the ST (1.82\%) and IO seas
   (3.23\%) (P < 0.01). The total cholesterol content of fish did not show
   significant differences from one geographic area to the other,
   particularly for European hake (from 98 to 66 mg per 100 g). The fatty
   acid profile of anchovy species was not affected by the geographical
   capture area. European hake caught in the ST sea showed the highest
   proportion of DHA (29.13\%) in comparison to those captured in the SA
   (19.98\%) and IO seas (19.84\%). Atlantic bonito from the ST had the
   highest proportions of DHA (24.94\%), compared to those from the SA
   (12.08\%) and IO seas (13.83\%). The SA bonitos contained a
   significantly lower proportion of EPA (3.31\%) in comparison to fish
   from both the ST and IO seas (5.66 and 5.17\%, respectively). Red mullet
   captured in the ST exhibited the highest proportions of DHA, n-3 PUFA,
   and total PUFA, and significantly lower proportions of oleic acid and
   MUFA. The fish from the ST sea showed better nutritional traits than
   those from other geographical areas although they all had excellent
   nutritional traits due to the low fat content and very high n-3 PUFA
   proportion.},

Abstract = {A molecular epidemiology investigation was undertaken in two Nigerian
   states (Plateau and Nassarawa) to determine the prevalence of pathogens
   of veterinary and public health importance associated with ticks
   collected from cattle and dogs using PCR, cloning and sequencing or
   reverse line blot techniques. A total of 218 tick samples. Amblyomma
   variegatum (N = 153), Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) decoloratus (N = 45),
   and Rhipicephalus sanguineus (N = 20) were sampled. Pathogens identified
   in ticks included piroplasmids (Babesia spp., Babesia bigemina and
   Babesia divergens), Anaplasma marginale and Rickettsia africae.
   Piroplasmids were identified in A. variegatum, A. marginale was found in
   R. decoloratus, while R. africae was detected in all tick species
   examined. Ehrlichia spp. and Theileria spp. were not identified in any
   of the ticks examined. Of the 218 ticks examined, 33 (15.1\%) contained
   pathogen DNA, with the presence of B. divergens and R. africae that are
   zoonotic pathogens of public health and veterinary importance. The
   variety of tick-borne pathogens identified in this study suggests a risk
   for the emergence of tick-borne diseases in domestic animals and humans,
   especially amongst the Fulani pastoralists in Plateau and Nassarawa
   states of Nigeria. (c) 012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Astroviruses can infect mammalian and avian species and are often
   responsible for gastroenteric disease symptoms. In this study, the
   complete open reading frame (ORF) 2, the 3' end of ORF1b and the
   corresponding intergenic region of astroviruses identified in farmed
   guinea fowl (Numida meleagris) were sequenced and genetically analysed.
   Overall, the genetic sequence of guinea fowl astroviruses was related to
   turkey astrovirus type 2 (TastV2), although a marked genetic distance
   was revealed based on ORF2, which might indicate the circulation of a
   distinct virus genotype and serotype in guinea fowl. Furthermore, the
   genetic data presented herein suggest that either recombination between
   different astroviruses infecting distinct hosts or adaptation of a given
   astrovirus to a new host had occurred. In either case, direct or
   indirect interspecies transmission of astroviruses is likely to have
   occurred between turkey and guinea fowl, indicating the ability of
   viruses belonging to the family Astroviridae to cross species barriers.},

Abstract = {The molecular characterization of a strain of Canine minute virus (CnMV)
   associated with neonatal death is reported. Three newborn puppies of a
   litter of Jack Russell terrier dogs died after displaying systemic
   disease, whereas 2 surviving puppies showed no clinical signs with the
   exception of transient cardiac abnormalities that were evident by
   electrocardiography. Necropsy of 1 dead puppy revealed severe lesions in
   the internal organs. A strain of Canine minute virus was detected in
   tissue samples collected from the puppy, and virus circulation was
   demonstrated by molecular or serological testing in the dam, puppies of
   the same litter, and other puppies in the same kennel. By sequence and
   phylogenetic analysis of the gene encoding for the VP2 capsid protein,
   the strain circulating in the kennel was found to be related to recent
   Asian CnMV isolates. Continuous molecular surveillance for CnMV in
   kennels, shelters, and rescue centers would expand the knowledge base on
   the epidemiological and pathogenetic features of CnMV, which has been
   known for several decades but still poorly understood.},

Abstract = {The recent description of a prion disease (PD) case in a free-ranging
   bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) prompted us to carry out an
   extensive search for the ``disease-associated{''} isoform (PrPSc) of the
   cellular prion protein (PrPC) in the brain and in a range of lymphoid
   tissues from 23 striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba), 5 bottlenose
   dolphins and 2 Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus) found stranded between
   2007 and 2012 along the Italian coastline. Three striped dolphins and
   one bottlenose dolphin showed microscopic lesions of encephalitis, with
   no evidence of spongiform brain lesions being detected in any of the 30
   free-ranging cetaceans investigated herein. Nevertheless, we could still
   observe a prominent PrPC immunoreactivity in the brain as well as in
   lymphoid tissues from these dolphins. Although immunohistochemical and
   Western blot investigations yielded negative results for PrPSc
   deposition in all tissues from the dolphins under study, the reported
   occurrence of a spontaneous PD case in a wild dolphin is an intriguing
   issue and a matter of concern for both prion biology and
   intra/inter-species transmissibility, as well as for cetacean
   conservation medicine.},

Abstract = {Chloralose (alpha-chloralose) is a poisonous substance currently used as
   a rodenticide or avicide. It has primarily been used in Europe since
   1893 as a human and veterinary hypnotic agent. Chloralose is a central
   nervous system depressant also acting as a stimulant on spinal reflexes.
   In the present case, a 24-year-old man was found dead in his bedroom
   near vomit residues. Several items were seized from the scene, including
   an empty bottle of Murex 50 g (alpha-chloralose), sold in Italy as
   rodenticide. Postmortem examination revealed no evidence of natural
   disease or trauma. Heart blood, urine, gastric contents, vitreous
   humour, brain, bile and liver were collected and submitted for
   toxicological analysis.
   Several extraction procedures and a specific liquid chromatographytandem
   mass spectrometry protocol were purposely developed and validated.
   Chloralose was found in blood at a concentration of 65.1 mg/L and high
   levels were also detected in the gastric contents, confirming its
   ingestion shortly before the mans death. The distribution of chloralose
   in the body was evaluated by analyzing urine, vitreous humour, brain,
   bile and liver specimens. Quantitation of chloralose in several body
   fluids and tissues adds new data about the distribution of this chemical
   in the human body after massive ingestion.},

Abstract = {According to Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology, the
   Rickettsiales are ` ... bacteria with typical Gram-negative cell walls
   and no flagella'. The recently sequenced genome of `Candidatus
   Midichloria mitochondrii', a divergent lineage within the order
   Rickettsiales capable of invading mitochondria in ixodid ticks, revealed
   the presence of 26 putative flagellar genes. Open questions in relation
   to this observation are whether these genes are expressed and whether
   they possess the domains expected for the flagellar function. Here we
   show that: (a) the putative flagellar proteins of `Ca. M. mitochondrii'
   actually possess the conserved domains and structural features required
   for their function in a model bacterium; (b) the seven flagellar genes
   of `Ca. M. mitochondrii' that have been tested are expressed at the RNA
   level; and (c) the putative flagellar cap gene of this bacterium (FliD)
   is expressed at the protein level, and can be stained within the
   bacterium and at its surface. Beside the specific questions that we have
   addressed that relate to the first evidence, to our knowledge, for a
   flagellar apparatus in a member of the order Rickettsiales, we present
   here novel tools (recombinant protein and antibodies) that will
   facilitate the study of `Ca. M. mitochondrii'.},

Abstract = {Cranioventral pulmonary consolidation (enzootic pneumonia-like lesions)
   and chronic pleuritis (CP) are common findings in slaughtered pigs.
   Pleural lesions involving dorsocaudal lobes are suggestive of
   pleuropneumonia due to Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. In this report
   the results of an abattoir survey of pleuritis and pulmonary lesions in
   pigs is presented with a focus on herd risk factors. A total of 4889
   animals, ranging in age from 9 to 10 months, from 48 batches of pigs
   belonging to an equal number of herds, were included in the study.
   Bronchopneumonic lesions suggestive of enzootic pneumonia (EP-like
   lesions) were detected in 46.4\% of the examined lungs. The EP-like
   lesion average value for all lungs was 1.03 (95\% Cl 0.98-1.08), ranging
   from 0.17 to 2.56 among the 48 batches; 47.5\% of lungs showed chronic
   pleuritis. Dorsocaudal pleuritis suggestive of recovered pleuropneumonia
   (SPES score >= 2) was found in 25.1\% of the lungs. The mean SPES
   (slaughterhouse pleuritis evaluation system) value of the overall 4889
   lungs was 0.83 (95\% Cl 0.78-0.86). The mean SPES value of the batches
   ranged from 0.04 to 1.87. The mean Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae index
   of all studied batches was 0.61 (95\% Cl 0.51-0.71), ranging from 0 to
   1.84.
   Blood samples were collected from each herd to evaluate antibody titres
   to Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, A. pleuropneumoniae, Aujeszky's disease
   virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and
   swine influenza virus. Herd characteristics were recorded using a
   questionnaire given to the farmers. A multivariable analysis was
   conducted to identify risk factors for pleuritis and EP-like lesions.
   High dorsocaudal pleuritis was associated with A. pleuropneumoniae
   seroprevalence and history of A. pleuropneumoniae isolation from
   pneumonic lungs of dead animals. Vaccination of weaners at 3-5 weeks of
   age against PRRS using a modified live vaccine was associated with a
   reduction in the percentage of cranioventral pulmonary consolidation
   (EP-like lesions). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the
   complement fixation test (CFT) with respect to ELISA for the serological
   diagnosis of Q fever and to assess the role of serology as a tool for
   the identification of the shedder status. During 2009-2010, sera from
   9635 bovines and 3872 small ruminants (3057 goats and 815 sheep) were
   collected and analyzed with CFT and ELISA. In addition, 2256 bovine, 139
   caprine and 72 ovine samples (individual and bulk tank milk samples,
   fetuses, vaginal swabs and placentae) were analyzed with a real-time PCR
   kit. The relative sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of CFT with
   respect to ELISA were Se 26.56\% and Sp 99.71\% for cattle and Se 9.96\%
   and Sp 99.94\% for small ruminants. To evaluate the correlation between
   serum-positive status and shedder status, the ELISA, CFT and real-time
   PCR results were compared. Due to the sampling method and the data
   storage system, the analysis of individual associations between the
   serological and molecular tests was possible only for some of the bovine
   samples. From a statistical point of view, no agreement was observed
   between the serological and molecular results obtained for fetus and
   vaginal swab samples. Slightly better agreement was observed between the
   serological and molecular results obtained for the individual milk
   samples and between the serological (at least one positive in the
   examined group) and molecular results for the bulk tank milk (BTM)
   samples. The CFT results exhibited a better correlation with the shedder
   status than did the ELISA results. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to analyse the SPRN genes of goats from
   several scrapie outbreaks in order to detect polymorphisms and to look
   for association with scrapie occurrence, by an unmatched case-control
   study. A region of the caprine SPRN gene encompassing the entire ORF and
   a fragment of the 3'UTR revealed a total of 11 mutations: 10
   single-nucleotide polymorphisms and one indel polymorphism. Only two
   non-synonymous mutations occurring at very low incidence were
   identified. A significant association with scrapie positivity in the
   central nervous system was found for an indel polymorphism
   (602\_606insCTCCC) in the 3'UTR. Bioinformatics analyses suggest that
   this indel may modulate scrapie susceptibility via a microRNA-mediated
   post-transcriptional mechanism. This is the first study to demonstrate
   an association between the SPRN gene and goat scrapie. The identified
   indel may serve as a genetic target other than PRNP to predict disease
   risk in future genetics-based scrapie-control approaches in goats.},

   dromedaries were investigated. Virulence gene profiles were determined
   using a custom E. coli virulence DNA microarray, composed of 70-mer
   oligonucleotide probes targeting 264 virulence or related genes of known
   E. coli pathotypes. Both strains displayed positive hybridization
   signals for the Locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) gene probes (ler,

Abstract = {A retrospective telephone survey (n=3490) was conducted in Italy between
   2008 and 2009 to estimate the occurrence of self-reported acute
   gastrointestinal illness (AGI) and to describe subjects' recourse to
   healthcare, using a symptom-based case definition. Three hundred and ten
   AGI cases were identified. The annual incidence rate was 1.08
   episodes/person-year (95\% confidence interval 0.90-1.14). The
   proportion of subjects consulting physicians was 39.5\% while only 0.3\%
   submitted a specimen for laboratory investigation. Risk factors for AGI
   and medical care-seeking were identified using logistic regression
   analysis. Females, children and young adults had a significantly higher
   incidence rate of AGI. Factors associated with medical care-seeking were
   age < 10 years, presence of fever, diarrhoea, and duration of illness >
   3 days. Our results provide a relevant contribution towards estimating
   the global burden of AGI using standard methods that ensure a good level
   of comparability with other studies.},

Abstract = {The association between bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and
   variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) has demonstrated that cattle
   transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) can pose a risk to
   human health and raises the possibility that other ruminant TSEs may be
   transmissible to humans. In recent years, several novel TSEs in sheep,
   cattle and deer have been described and the risk posed to humans by
   these agents is currently unknown. In this study, we inoculated two
   forms of atypical BSE (BASE and H-type BSE), a chronic wasting disease
   (CWD) isolate and seven isolates of atypical scrapie into gene-targeted
   transgenic (Tg) mice expressing the human prion protein (PrP). Upon
   challenge with these ruminant TSEs, gene-targeted Tg mice expressing
   human PrP did not show any signs of disease pathology. These data
   strongly suggest the presence of a substantial transmission barrier
   between these recently identified ruminant TSEs and humans.},

Title = {CA 15-3 cell lines and tissue expression in canine mammary cancer and

Abstract = {Background: Mammary tumours are the most common malignancy diagnosed in
   female dogs and a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in this
   species. Carbohydrate antigen (CA) 15-3 is a mucinous glycoprotein
   aberrantly over-expressed in human mammary neoplasms and one of the most
   widely used serum tumour markers in women with breast cancer. The aim of
   this study was to investigate the antigenic analogies of human and
   canine CA 15-3 and to assess its expression in canine mammary cancer
   tissues and cell lines. Immunohistochemical expression of CA 15-3 was
   evaluated in 7 canine mammary cancer cell lines and 50 malignant mammary
   tumours. As a positive control, the human breast carcinoma cell line
   MCF7 and tissue were used. To assess CA 15-3 staining, a
   semi-quantitative method was applied. To confirm the specificity and
   cross-reactivity of an anti-human CA 15-3 antibody to canine tissues, an
   immunoblot analysis was performed. We also investigated serum CA 15-3
   activity to establish whether its expression could be assigned to
   several tumour characteristics to evaluate its potential use as a serum
   tumour marker in the canine mammary oncology field.
   Results: Immunocytochemical analysis revealed CA 15-3 expression in all
   examined canine mammary cancer cell lines, whereas its expression was
   confirmed by immunoblot only in the most invasive cells (CMT-W1,
   CMT-W1M, CMT-W2 and CMT-W2M). In the tissue, an immunohistochemical
   staining pattern was observed in 34 (68\%) of the malignant tumours. A
   high statistical correlation (p = 0.0019) between serum CA 15-3 levels
   and the degree of tumour proliferation and differentiation was shown,
   which indicates that the values of this serum marker increase as the
   tumour stage progresses.
   Conclusions: The results of this study reveal that CA 15-3 is expressed
   in both canine mammary tumour cell lines and tissues and that serum
   levels significantly correlate with the histological grade of the
   malignancy.},

Abstract = {This work tested the effect of replacing zinc bacitracin with a blend of
   caproic and caprylic acids in a diet including colistin on growth
   performance, mortality, gut histology and development of intestinal
   lymphoid tissues in rabbits experimentally infected with Escherichia
   coli and Clostridium perfringens. Three experimental diets were
   formulated: a control non-medicated diet (diet C), diet C medicated with
   150 mg zinc bacitracin and 120 mg colistin/kg (diet B) and diet C
   supplemented with a 4-g mixture of the acids and 120 mg colistin/kg
   (diet A). Forty rabbits weaned at 28 days of age and housed individually
   were assigned to each diet. At 35 days of age, rabbits were orally
   infected with 10(9) cfu of E. coli and 10(9) cfu of C. perfringens. At
   35 and 56 days of age, five rabbits per diet and age were slaughtered to
   assess caecal traits, jejunal histology and follicular development in
   the caudal Heal Peyer's patch and the appendix. No significant
   differences were reported on growth performance. Mortality rate reached
   60.0\% for control rabbits whereas no mortality occurred in rabbits fed
   the supplemented diets. Caecal pH was not influenced by diet but was
   lower at 56 than at 35 days (6.20 vs. 6.49, P<0.001). No differences
   were detected on villus height of control rabbits between 35 and 56 days
   of age (average height of 597 mu m) but villi of rabbits fed diets B and
   A were, respectively, 19 and 34\% (P<0.001) longer at 56 days than at 35
   days. The average follicle area in the Peyer's patch (81,900 mu m(2) vs.
   56,800 mu m(2), P<0.001) and in the appendix (116,000 mu m(2) vs. 56,900
   mu m(2), P<0.001) increased after the infection. Besides, average
   follicle area of the Peyer's patch was influenced by diet (78,983 mu
   m(2) vs. 69,632 mu m(2) vs. 59,457 mu m(2), P=0.011, for diets C. B and
   A. respectively). No significant effect of treatments was detected on
   the number of follicles of the appendix (37.2 follicles on average). To
   conclude, the substitution of caproic and caprylic acids for zinc
   bacitracin in a diet including colistin increased jejunal villus height
   and reduced follicle hypertrophy of the caudal ileal Peyer's patch in
   growing rabbits experimentally infected with C perfringens A and E. coli
   O103. The dietary combination of colistin with both zinc bacitracin and
   the blend of esterified caproic and caprylic acids prevented the rise of
   fattening mortality, even after the infection. However, the effect of
   including medium-chain organic acids in a diet free of medication on
   challenged rabbit health is yet to be elucidated. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Background: This report describes the results of radiological,
   histological and molecular examination of three farm-reared red-legged
   partridges (Alectoris rufa) affected by candidiasis.
   Case presentation: Three juvenile farm-reared red-legged partridges in a
   batch of 100 of the same species were sent for clinical and pathological
   investigations. The owner referred of a sudden isolation of the sick
   animals, with apathy, diarrhea, ruffled plumage and respiratory rattles.
   Post mortem total body lateral projection radiograph showed an increased
   perihilar interstitial pattern and air bronchogram signs due to lung
   edema. At necropsy, carcasses showed cachexia; the pericloacal region
   was soiled by diarrheic fecal material. From the mouth to the intestine,
   a mucous yellowish fluid was present on a slightly reddish mucosa.
   Histopathology showed slight edema and congestion with different free
   fungal elements, referable to blastospores, hyphae and pseudohyphae.
   Biomolecular exam identified the most similar sequences as belonging to
   Leucosporidium scottii.
   Conclusion: To our knowledge, this case report describes for the first
   time this fungal species as a causative agent of candidiasis in birds.},

Abstract = {Objective-To compare methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
   pseudintermedius (MRSP) and methicillin-susceptible S pseudintermedius
   (MSSP) infections in dogs.
   Design-Multicenter case-control study.
   Animals-Dogs with MRSP infections were matched, by hospital, with 2 MSSP
   controls, with the infections occurring immediately before and after the
   case infection.
   Procedures-Signalment, historical, clinical, treatment, and outcome data
   were documented. Conditional logistic regression was performed. A manual
   stepwise backward elimination procedure was used to build the
   multivariable model.
   Results-56 case and 112 control dogs were enrolled. Pyoderma was the
   most common infection type in both groups. In the final multivariable
   model, systemic administration of antimicrobials within 30 days prior to
   infection was significantly associated with an MRSP versus an MSSP
   infection (OR, 9.9; 95\% confidence interval, 3.59 to 2753).
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-The association of prior
   antimicrobial administration and MRSP infection indicated the potential
   impact of routine antimicrobial use in veterinary medicine on
   antimicrobial resistance and the need for prudent use of these important
   drugs. Mortality rate was not significantly different between MRSP and
   MSSP infections; the lack of a significant difference suggested that
   MRSP was inherently no more virulent than MSSP provided the infection
   was properly diagnosed and appropriate treatment was started. Basic
   concepts such as prudent antimicrobial use and early diagnosis through
   timely submission of appropriate culture specimens therefore can be
   important measures to try to reduce the impact of this pathogen. (J Am

Abstract = {Sepsis (S) and bacterial suppurative meningitis-meningoencephalitis
   (M-ME) are common causes of death in bovine neonates. The aim of this
   prospective study was to evaluate the prevalence of S and M-ME in
   critically ill neonatal Piedmontese calves. Critically ill animals up to
   15 days old referred by practitioners were registered according to their
   status and subsequently assigned to clinical standardized score. Calves
   with a clinical score >= 5 were further assessed under a clinical and
   clinical-pathological protocol to strengthen the suspicion of S and
   M-ME. Critically ill neonatal calves sent for necropsy were included in
   the study as well. Fifty-nine calves were investigated, 26 of which
   referred alive and 33 dead. Ten out of the 26 clinically evaluated
   calves were classified as suspicious of S on the basis of the clinical
   and clinical-pathological protocol;. S was confirmed by positive
   bacteriologic culture in 7 cases and in 3 cases on the basis of
   necroptic lesions. Concomitant suppurative M-ME suspected in 6 of these
   10 calves was subsequently confirmed by CSF analysis or histological
   findings. Of the 33 calves examined only post-mortem, 20 showed
   pathognomonic findings of S and 14 signs of M-ME. The prevalence of S
   and M-ME was 46 and 36\%, respectively. Clinical signs of S were
   confirmed to be vague and overlapping with other diseases. The developed
   protocol was highly accurate in predicting S in these neonatal calves.},

Abstract = {Many studies have focused on the transport of cattle to fattening farms
   or to slaughterhouses but there is little information concerning the
   transport of young bulls delivered to the genetic test stations for
   selection. Due to the high expected value of young Al candidate bulls,
   their transport conditions could be very different from those intended
   for other cattle categories. The objective of the present study was to
   examine the effect of transport on behavioural response and on some
   blood variables of 26 young Holstein bulls (mean weight kg 278 64)
   before, during and after short journeys (duration <8 h) to a genetic
   test centre. Behavioural patterns such as agonistic and affiliative
   interactions, environmental and conspecific explorative behaviour were
   recorded by means of an instantaneous sampling method at the farms of
   origin, into the truck and at the genetic test station. Moreover,
   standing orientation and postures during transport were recorded. Blood
   samples were collected by jugular venipuncture before transport (-4
   days, T - 4), immediately after transport (day 0, TO) and at 4 days (T +
   4) relative to time day 0. The space allowance during transport, ranging
   from 1.50 m(2) to 3.75 m(2) per head, enabled the animals to move quite
   freely and adopt comfortable positions. Young bulls did not show any
   preferences in their standing orientation during journeys and they were
   observed in a lying position for short time periods: they were also
   observed to ruminate, especially during the stationary periods of the
   journey. Mixing of animals during journeys did not affect their
   behaviour. The agonistic behaviour rate was higher during transport
   (P=0.049) and in the first two hours after unloading (P=0.003) than on
   the rearing farms. Four days after transport, agonistic behaviour
   decreased compared to the level observed during the first two hours
   after unloading (P=0.003), whereas affiliative behaviours increased
   (P=0.023); however, since the hourly rate of agonistic interactions
   remained higher than the rate observed on the farms of origin (P=0.001),
   we postulate that hierarchical relationships were not well established
   yet. After unloading, all animals spent more time interacting with
   others than exploring their new pen. Plasma glucose and non-esterified
   fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations both increased significantly after
   transport. There were no changes in the activity of plasma creatine
   kinase (CK) after transport, suggesting that the journeys did not cause
   physical exertion. The results indicate that the transport conditions
   adopted for the Al candidate bulls only slightly affected the
   behavioural response and blood variables examined here and could be
   considered satisfactory for their welfare. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae, includes a number of
   important arthropod-transmitted human pathogens such as dengue viruses,
   West Nile Virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and yellow fever virus. In
   addition, the genus includes flaviviruses without a known vertebrate
   reservoir, which have been detected only in insects, particularly in
   mosquitoes, such as cell fusing agent virus, Kamiti River virus, Culex
   flavivirus, Aedes flavivirus, Quang Binh virus, Nakiwogo virus and
   Calbertado virus. Reports of the detection of these viruses with no
   recognized pathogenic role in humans are increasing in mosquitoes
   collected around the world, particularly in those sampled in
   entomological surveys targeting pathogenic flaviviruses. The presence of
   six potential flaviviruses, detected from independent European arbovirus
   surveys undertaken in the Czech Republic, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the
   UK between 2007 and 2010, is reported in this work. Whilst the Aedes
   flaviviruses, detected in Italy from Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, had
   already been isolated in Japan, the remaining five viruses have not been
   reported previously: one was detected in Italy, Portugal and Spain from
   Aedes mosquitoes (particularly from Aedes caspius), one in Portugal and
   Spain from Culex theileri mosquitoes, one in the Czech Republic and
   Italy from Aedes vexans, one in the Czech Republic from Aedes vexans and
   the last in the UK from Aedes cinereus. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed
   the close relationship of these putative viruses to other insectonly
   flaviviruses.},

Abstract = {Deficits in glutamate neurotransmission and mitochondrial functions were
   detected in the frontal cortex (FC) and hippopcampus (HIPP) of aged 3 X
   Tg-Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice, compared with their wild type
   littermates (non-Tg). In particular, basal levels of glutamate and
   vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) expression were reduced in
   both areas. Cortical glutamate release responded to K+ stimulation,
   whereas no peak release was observed in the HIPP of mutant mice.
   Synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25), glutamate/aspartate
   transporter (GLAST), glutamate transporter 1 (GLT1) and excitatory amino
   acid carrier 1 (EAAC1) were reduced in HIPP homogenates, where the
   adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content was lower. In contrast, glutamate
   transporter 1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were found to
   be higher in the frontal cortex. The respiration rates of complex-I, II,
   IV, and the membrane potential were reduced in cortical mitochondria,
   where unaltered proton leak, F0F1-ATPase activity and ATP content, with
   increased hydrogen peroxide production (H2O2), were also observed. In
   contrast, complex-I respiration rate was significantly increased in
   hippocampal mitochondria, together with increased proton leak and H2O2
   production. Moreover, loss of complex-IV and F0F1-ATPase activities were
   observed. These data suggest that impairments of mitochondrial
   bioenergetics might sustain the failure in the energy-requiring
   glutamatergic transmission. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Following reports of increased mortality in the small ruminant
   population of the Sahrawi territories, western Algeria, between January
   and May 2010, local veterinary authorities suspected an outbreak of
   peste des petits ruminants (PPR). An investigation was implemented in
   May 2010 and followed up in October 2010 in the Sahrawi refugee camps,
   Tindouf province, with the objective of confirming the circulation of
   the peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV). Laboratory results
   confirmed the presence of PPRV in 33.3\% of the samples. Sequence
   analysis revealed that the virus belonged to Lineage IV and phylogenetic
   analysis indicated a close relationship (99.3\%) with the PPRV isolated
   during the Moroccan outbreak in 2008.},

Abstract = {Influenza A viruses infect a large number of mammals and birds resulting
   in sporadic infections, seasonal epidemics, epizootics and pandemics.
   The segmented genome of the virus encodes 10 or 11 proteins depending on
   the strain. The neuraminidase, non-structural 1 and the PB1-F2 proteins
   are known to be variable in their length due to very specific deletions,
   truncations and elongations. This review presents an update on what is
   currently known about these three proteins and discusses their length
   variations in relation to virulence and host adaptation in addition to
   identifying possible areas of future research.},

Abstract = {Ticks are the main vectors of rickettsiae of the spotted fever group, as
   well as of a variety of other Rickettsiales, including bacteria of the
   genus , that might cause diseases in humans and animals. Here we present
   the result of a survey for ticks and for tick-associated Rickettsiales
   in the Emilia Romagna region (Northern Italy). The study was focused on
   ticks collected from wild-hunted animals. Out of 392 ticks collected
   from these animals, 282 (72\%) were identified as , 110 (28\%) as . The
   former was found on four vertebrate species, whereas the latter appeared
   more specific for wild boar. The presence of rickettsiae was
   demonstrated in 22.5\% of (57/253) and in 29\% of (32/110). Five ticks
   of the species were also positive for (2\%). In addition, we collected
   ticks by dragging in a natural park of the same region. All of the ticks
   captured by dragging were identified as . Thirty-six out of 200 analyzed
   ticks proved positive for and (16.5 and 1.5\%, respectively). Our
   results highlight that that ticks present in wild areas, widely

Title = {Anthrax outbreaks in South Italy},
Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {18},

Pages = {107-111},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Introduction - Bacillus anthracis is the agent of anthrax, a non
   contagious infectious disease that primarily affects domestic and wild
   ruminants. The classical form is characterized by sporadic outbreaks,
   usually occurring in the summer, involving a very low number of animals
   developing an hyperacute form in which animals die without any symptoms.
   Rarely, however, anthrax may develop in an epidemic-like form
   characterized by many outbreaks occurring in a very limited area and
   involving a large number of animals.
   Material and methods - From August 28th to September 27th 2011, several
   outbreaks of anthrax affecting cattle, horses and sheep were recorded in
   an area of about 50 km(2) in Basilicata and in Campania. All dead
   animals were submitted to a careful clinical examination. After samples
   collection, they were buried in a hole three meters deep and, where
   possible, the carcasses were burned inside of the pit before it was
   filled in. The isolates were submitted to genetic analysis by MLVA with
   15 VNTR and Canonical SNPs. After confirmation of anthrax, an emergency
   vaccination program was performed.
   Results - Laboratory tests confirmed anthrax in 16 cattle, 7 horses and
   5 sheep. Clinical examination revealed that all horses and many cattle
   had a huge swelling in different parts of their bodies. Within four
   weeks over 97\% of the livestock population in affected areas were
   vaccinated and revaccinated. The genetic analysis indicated the presence
   of two different genotypes, Gt/Sal and Gt/Pz1, isolated in Campania and
   in Basilicata, respectively both belonging to the major lineage A,
   sub-linage A. Br. 008/009.
   Conclusions - In Italy, where anthrax is endemic but sporadic disease,
   two major anthrax epidemic-like were recorded (Basilicata 2004 and
   Basilicata/Campania 2011). The same genotype of Bacillus anthracis was
   isolated from all outbreaks. Interestingly, horses and cattle were
   mainly involved with respect to the sheep and goats which were the
   prevalent species in the animal population. This observation was
   confirmed by statistical analysis showing that the incidence of the
   disease is significant in horses and cattle respect to other receptive
   animal species. Moreover, all infected horses and many cattle showed
   massive edema in different parts of their body. Based on these data, the
   Authors hypothesize that the epidemic-like anthrax could be an atypical
   evolution of the classic disease contracted by the ingestion of
   anthrax-sporescontaminated soil. The tabanids, after being fed on
   infected animals, especially during the bacteraemic phase, may passively
   transfer the pathogen to healthy animals, causing the disease
   characterized by an extensive edema due to the injection-source of the
   infection.},

Abstract = {Increasing diversity among H5 hemagglutinin (HA) subtype avian influenza
   (AI) viruses has resulted in the need of novel sensitive and specific
   molecular assays. In this study, an SYBR Green-based real-time reverse
   transcription-PCR (RRT-PCR) assay was developed for the detection of H5
   subtype AI virus. Sequence analysis of the Mexican lineage H5N2 isolates
   (subgroup B) revealed several mismatches in the primer/hydrolysis probe
   set reported in the commonly used RRT-PCR assay for the detection of H5
   North American lineage. The present assay was designed to circumvent the
   challenge that these viruses represent for the specific detection of H5
   subtype AI viruses. This RRT-PCR assay successfully detected a range of
   different H5 subtype AI strains from both Eurasian and North American
   lineages representing different avian H5 HA clades from diverse
   geographical locations. The sensitivity of the present method was
   determined by using in vitro-transcribed RNA and 10-fold serial
   dilutions of titrated AI viruses. High sensitivity levels were obtained,
   with limits of detection of 10(0) 50\% egg infectious dose (EID50)/mL
   and 4.2 gene copies/mu l. The linear ranges of the assay span within
   10(6)-10(0) EID50/mL and 10(6)-10(0) gene copies/mu l. The results
   obtained from this method were directly compared with those of the H5
   RRT-PCR assay recommended by the OIE. The comparison was performed with
   110 tracheal and cloacal swabs from various bird species collected
   during field and laboratory investigations in Eurasia and Africa in 2006
   and 2008 and showed 100\% agreement. This assay is recommended as an
   alternative method, also allowing a `double check' approach detection,
   to be use mainly in outbreak scenarios with higher risk of poultry
   infections by Central American/Caribbean H5 AI viruses. (C) 2012

Abstract = {This paper describes the investigations carried out in a buffaloes herd
   from a farm in central Italy (Marche region), where repeated episodes of
   respiratory problems in the category of young buffaloes. Clinical,
   virological, molecular biology, bacteriological, and serological tests
   were conducted in the group of animals constituted from 6 young
   buffaloes, 4 nourishing buffaloes and 4 cattle.
   The results obtained showed the presence of severe clinical respiratory
   symptoms only in young buffaloes. The viral isolation from only nasal
   swab of one young buffalo evidenced a cytopathic effect typical of
   Herpesvirus. Further molecular biology investigations (PCR, genomic
   sequencing) were performed to characterize this isolate. A 100\% of
   homology with the glycoprotein E (gE) of Bubaline herpesvirus type 1
   (BuHV-1) deposited in the Gene Bank (EF624469.1) has been shown. No
   positive results neither for Bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1) nor for
   other viruses were found in nasal or rectal swabs from the other
   animals. The bacteriological investigations performed on both nasal or
   rectal swabs, did not evidence any microbiological agent responsible for
   respiratory and/or enteric clinical symptoms. The BoHV-1 gB ELISA (IDEXX
   (R) IBR gB Ab test) tests showed positive results for all the young
   buffaloes, in 3 cattle and in 4 adult buffaloes, while the results
   obtained from the gE ELISA (IDEXX (R) IBR gE Ab test), which showed
   positive in 2 young buffaloes, in 4 cattle and in 4 adult buffaloes. The
   serum neutralization tests against BoHV-1 and BuHV-1 showed no
   significant difference both among the categories of animals tested.
   According to the results obtained in this study we can conclude that for
   the very first time it was possible to detect BuHV-1 in young buffaloes
   combined with severe respiratory clinical symptoms. Subsequent studies
   will be aimed to determine, in compliance with Koch postulate, whether
   the virus isolate is the cause of the observed respiratory clinical
   symptoms.},

Abstract = {Background: Specific bacterial infections or alterations of the gut
   microbiota likely trigger immunopathological phenomena associated with
   Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Mycobacterium avium subspecies
   paratuberculosis is a candidate etiological agent of Crohn's disease.
   Definitive causal connection between Mycobacterium avium subspecies
   paratuberculosis infection and Crohn's disease has not been
   demonstrated.
   Aims: To determine the circulation of Mycobacterium avium subspecies
   paratuberculosis in Crohn's disease patients and water supplies in an
   Italian region where this bacterium is endemic in cattle farms.
   Methods: Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis screening was
   performed on biopsies from human patients, and from water samples, using
   two different PCR procedures.
   Results: In hospitals where multiple specimens were obtained from
   different sites in the intestine, the prevalence of Mycobacterium avium
   subspecies paratuberculosis infection was 82.1\% and 40\% respectively
   in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients; in another hospital,
   where single specimens were obtained from patients, the bacterium was
   not detected. Control subjects also harboured Mycobacterium avium
   subspecies paratuberculosis, but at a lower prevalence. Tap water
   samples collected in the study area contained Mycobacterium avium
   subspecies paratuberculosis DNA.
   Discussion: The results of screenings for Mycobacterium avium subspecies
   paratuberculosis in humans are deeply influenced by both the number and
   location of the collected biopsies. There is a wide circulation of the
   organism in the study area, considering the prevalence in humans and its
   presence in drinking water. (C) 2012 Editrice Gastroenterologica

Abstract = {Mycobacterium bovis isolates from the Iberian Peninsula are dominated by
   strains with spoligotype patterns deleted for spacer 21. Whole-genome
   sequencing of three Spanish strains with spacer 21 missing in their
   spoligotype pattern revealed a series of SNPs and subsequent screening
   of a selection of these SNPs identified one in gene guaA that is
   specific to these strains. This group of strains from the Iberian
   Peninsula missing spoligotype spacer 21 represents a new clonal complex
   of M. bovis, defined by the SNP profile with a distinct spoligotype
   signature. We have named this clonal complex European 2 (Eu2) and found
   that it was present at low frequency in both France and Italy and absent
   from the British Isles. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Mosquito, Bird and Human Surveillance of West Nile and Usutu Viruses in

Abstract = {Background: In 2008, after the first West Nile virus (WNV) detection in
   the Emilia-Romagna region, a surveillance system, including mosquito-and
   bird-based surveillance, was established to evaluate the virus presence.
   Surveillance was improved in following years by extending the monitoring
   to larger areas and increasing the numbers of mosquitoes and birds
   tested.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: A network of mosquito traps, evenly
   distributed and regularly activated, was set up within the surveyed
   area. A total of 438,558 mosquitoes, grouped in 3,111 pools and 1,276
   birds (1,130 actively sampled and 146 from passive surveillance), were
   tested by biomolecular analysis. The survey detected WNV in 3 Culex
   pipiens pools while Usutu virus (USUV) was found in 89 Cx. pipiens pools
   and in 2 Aedes albopictus pools. Two birds were WNV-positive and 12 were
   USUV-positive. Furthermore, 30 human cases of acute meningoencephalitis,
   possibly caused by WNV or USUV, were evaluated for both viruses and
   1,053 blood bags were tested for WNV, without any positive result.
   Conclusions/Significance: Despite not finding symptomatic human WNV
   infections during 2010, the persistence of the virus, probably due to
   overwintering, was confirmed through viral circulation in mosquitoes and
   birds, as well as for USUV. In 2010, circulation of the two viruses was
   lower and more delayed than in 2009, but this decrease was not explained
   by the relative abundance of Cx. pipiens mosquito, which was greater in
   2010. The USUV detection in mosquito species confirms the role of Cx.
   pipiens as the main vector and the possible involvement of Ae.
   albopictus in the virus cycle. The effects of meteorological conditions
   on the presence of USUV-positive mosquito pools were considered finding
   an association with drought conditions and a wide temperature range. The
   output produced by the surveillance system demonstrated its usefulness
   and reliability in terms of planning public health policies.},

Title = {Gene expression profiling of Mycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis
   in simulated multi-stress conditions and within THP-1 cells reveals a
   new kind of interactive intramacrophage behaviour},
Journal = {BMC MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2012},

Abstract = {Background: Recent studies have identified in Mycobacterium avium subsp.
   paratuberculosis (MAP), already known as a pathogen in ruminants, a
   potential zoonotic agent of some autoimmune diseases in humans.
   Therefore, considering the possible risk for public health, it is
   necessary a thorough understanding of MAP's gene expression during
   infection of human host as well as the identification of its immunogenic
   and/or virulence factors for the development of appropriate diagnostic
   and therapeutic tools.
   Results: In order to characterize MAP's transcriptome during macrophage
   infection, we analyzed for the first time the whole gene expression of a
   human derived strain of MAP in simulated intraphagosomal conditions and
   after intracellular infection of the human macrophage cell line THP-1 by
   using the DNA-microarray technology. Results showed that MAP shifts its
   transcriptome to an adaptive metabolism for an anoxic environment and
   nutrient starvation. It up-regulates several response factors to
   oxidative stress or intracellular conditions and allows, in terms of
   transcription, a passive surface peptidoglycan spoliation within the
   macrophage along with an intensification of the anabolic activity for
   lipidic membrane structures.
   Conclusions: These results indicate a possible interactive system
   between MAP and its host cell based on the internal mimicry unlike other
   intracellular pathogens, bringing new hypothesis in the virulence and
   pathogenicity of MAP and its importance in human health.},

Title = {A gallery of the key characters to ease identification of Dermanyssus
   gallinae (Acari: Gamasida: Dermanyssidae) and allow differentiation from
   Ornithonyssus sylviarum (Acari: Gamasida: Macronyssidae)},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAY 30},
Abstract = {Background: Dermanyssus gallinae (poultry red mite) is a major threat
   for the poultry industry and is of significant interest for public
   health. Identification of D. gallinae can be difficult for scientists
   not familiar with mite morphology and terminology especially when trying
   to use identification keys. Moreover, this species may easily be
   confused with another dermanyssoid mite, Ornithonyssus sylviarum
   (northern fowl mite), which often shares the same hosts and environment.
   Methods: Specimens of D. gallinae were collected at poultry farms in the
   Puglia and performed for light and scanning electron microscopy
   observations, identification and micrographs. Moreover specimens of O.
   sylviarum were collected separately macerated and mounted on slides for
   light microscopy observations, identification and pictures.
   Results: The micrographs used in this study, based on LM and SEM
   observations, highlight the following important identifying characters
   of D. gallinae: the prominent shoulders of the dorsal shield and the
   jagged edges of the shield reticulations, the position of setae j1, s1
   and the epigynal pores, and the presence on tibia IV pl of one seta.
   Additional micrographs highlighting the shape of the dorsal (abruptly
   narrowed posteriorly) and epigynal (narrowly rounded posteriorly)
   shields and the chelicera (elongate, with distinct digits) of O.
   sylviarum enable its differentiation from D. gallinae.
   Conclusion: The photographic support provided here (both LM and SEM
   pictures) can be considered a practical tool for scientists who are not
   well acquainted with the morphology of D. gallinae, and who are involved
   with classical and molecular systematics, veterinary and human health
   aspects of poultry red mites.},

   puppies (age from 5 to 14 weeks of age) from 33 French breeding kennels.
   Data were registered for each puppy, including age, bleed, gender,
   origin of the dog, and feces quality. The samples were tested by
   specific RTPCR for the presence of canine astrovirus. Astroviruses were
   identified in 20.9\% (66/316) of the puppies and in 42\% (14/33) of the
   breeding kennels. Young puppies (i.e. <7 weeks of age) and puppies from
   large breeding kennels were more likely to be infected by the
   astrovirus. No association between the quality of feces and astrovirus
   infection could be determined in this survey. (C) 2012 Published by

Title = {Detection of Leishmania infantum DNA mainly in Rhipicephalus sanguineus
   male ticks removed from dogs living in endemic areas of canine
   leishmaniosis},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAY 21},
Abstract = {Background: Sand flies are the only biologically adapted vectors of
   Leishmania parasites, however, a possible role in the transmission of
   Leishmania has been proposed for other hematophagous ectoparasites such
   as ticks. In order to evaluate natural infection by Leishmania infantum
   in Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks, taking into account its close
   association with dogs, 128 adult R. sanguineus ticks removed from 41
   dogs living in endemic areas of canine leishmaniosis were studied.
   Methods: Individual DNA extraction was performed from each tick and
   whole blood taken from dogs. Dog sera were tested for IgG antibodies to
   L. infantum antigen by ELISA and L. infantum real-time PCR was performed
   from canine whole blood samples and ticks.
   Results: Leishmania infantum PCR was positive in 13 ticks (10.1\%)
   including one female, (2.0\%) and 12 males (15.2\%), and in only five
   dogs (12.2\%). Male ticks had a significantly higher infection rate when
   compared to female R. sanguineus. The percentage of L. infantum
   seroreactive dogs was 19.5\%. All but two PCR positive dogs were
   seroreactive. Leishmania infantum PCR positive ticks were removed from
   seropositive and seronegative dogs with a variety of PCR results.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates high prevalence of L. infantum DNA
   in R. sanguineus ticks removed from L. infantum seropositive and
   seronegative dogs. The presence of L. infantum DNA was detected mainly
   in male ticks possibly due to their ability to move between canine hosts
   and feed on several canine hosts during the adult life stage. Additional
   studies are needed to further explore the role of R. sanguineus ticks
   and in particular, male adults, in both the epidemiology and immunology
   of L. infantum infection in dogs in endemic areas.},

   hospital in Mantua, Italy with symptoms of acute encephalitis. Due to a
   recent history of bite by a suspected rabid dog in India, where he had
   received incomplete post-exposure treatment, rabies was suspected. The
   patient died after 22 days of intensive care treatment and rabies was
   confirmed post mortem. This report stresses the need of appropriate
   post-exposure prophylaxis in rabies-endemic countries.},

Abstract = {Three subtypes (H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2) are currently diffused worldwide
   in pigs. The H1N2 subtype was detected for the first time in Italian
   pigs in 1998. To investigate the genetic characteristics and the
   molecular evolution of this subtype in Italy, we conducted a
   phylogenetic analysis of whole genome sequences of 26 strair's isolated
   from 1998 to 2010. Phylogenetic analysis of HA and NA genes showed
   differences between the older (1998-2003) and the more recent strains
   (2003-2010). The older isolates were closely related to the established
   European H1N2 lineage, whereas the more recent isolates possessed a
   different NA deriving from recent human H3N2 viruses. Two other
   reassortant H1N2 strains have been detected: A/sw/It/22530/02 has the HA
   gene that is closely related to H1N1 viruses; A/sw/It/58769/10 is an
   uncommon strain with an HA that is closely related to H1N1 and an NA
   similar to H3N2 SIVs. Amino acid analysis revealed interesting features:
   a deletion of two amino acids (146-147) in the HA gene of the recent
   isolates and two strains isolated in 1998; the presence of the uncommon
   aa change (N66S), in the PB1-F2 protein in strains isolated from 2009 to
   2010, which is said to have contributed to the increased virulence.
   These results demonstrate the importance if pigs as mixing vessels for
   animal and human influenza and show the presence and establishment of
   reassortant strains involving human viruses in pigs in Italy. These
   findings also highlighted different genomic characteristics of the NA
   gene the recent Italian strains compared to circulating European
   viruses. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Raw milk is increasingly appreciated by consumers but can be
   contaminated by a variety of zoonotic pathogens. Therefore, preventive
   measures, such as on-farm hazard analysis critical control point (HACCP)
   programs, must be applied to protect consumers. The aim of the present
   study was the comparison of a multiplex real-time polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) assay with a culture-based approach in an on-farm quality
   assurance program for the detection of Escherichia coli O157, Salmonella
   spp., and Listeria monocytogenes in bulk tank milk, in-line milk
   filters, manure, and feces. Results revealed that the real-time PCR was
   more sensitive in detecting E. coli O157 than the culture method in
   filters (48\% vs. 4\% positive), manure (93\% vs. 7\% positive) and
   feces (60\% vs. 4\% positive). The two methods were equally efficient in
   detecting L. monocytogenes (8\% of filters), while Salmonella spp. was
   not detected in any sample. In conclusion, the real-time PCR, by
   reducing analysis time to two working days, can be proposed as a useful
   tool in the raw milk primary production setting as a rapid and
   user-friendly screening method.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {285-291},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Cystic echinococcosis (CE) in cattle was found in 246 out of all 377
   municipalities in Sardinia, Italy. Out of 32,685 bovines slaughtered in
   Sardinia in 2009, 1,360 were found to be positive for CE with a
   registered average prevalence of 4.2\%. Of these animals, 896 (66\%) had
   lived on the same farm from birth to slaughter, thus linking the
   infection to the farm with certainty, while 413 (30\%) had lived on two
   different farms (one transfer) and 51 (4\%) on three (two transfers). As
   it was not possible to assess in which farm the animals acquired the
   infection, all farms having kept infected cattle were considered as
   suspected sources of CE infection. Based on this classification, 534
   farms were listed as definitely infected with a further 495 suspected to
   also be infected. Scan statistics was used with the Bernoulli model to
   detect and evaluate clusters of infected farms and also clusters of
   ``non-cases{''}. For the spatial analysis, 1,029 farms (534 + 495) were
   considered as positive with the number of non-infected farms from which
   negative results were available (8,457) as controls. A most likely
   cluster was detected at latitude 39.47861 N and longitude 8.58216 E in a
   centroid of 97.92 km radius and a secondary cluster was detected at
   latitude 40.58890 N and longitude 8.98400 E in a centroid of 15.44 km
   radius. To address the issue of sensitivity and consistency of the
   results, we ran multiple scans with various max-sizes as this allowed us
   to achieve more valid, consistent results and to highlight the core
   clusters.},

Abstract = {Polysaccharides are biopolymers that play key roles as therapeutic
   agents. The current study examined the efficiency of a polysaccharide
   newly derived from a plant resource for detection of sub-acute mercury
   (Hg) exposure on blood characteristics of Atlantic salmon. The
   polysaccharide was extracted from the roots of Acanthophyllum
   bracteatum, and the Atlantic salmon were divided into three groups and
   placed in fiberglass tanks: one with no Hg as a control, one filled with
   60 mu g l(-1) of Hg solution, and one with 60 mu g l(-1) Hg solution
   plus 1\% weight/weight (w/w) of polysaccharide, which had been added 24
   hours before the addition of Hg solution. Serum hematological and
   biochemical parameters were analysed. Results of the study showed that
   the blood factors were significantly adjusted in the group that had been
   exposed to the polysaccharide and Hg compared to the group that had been
   exposed only to Hg. The polysaccharide had an adjustment effect on
   lymphocytes, granulocytes, red blood cells (RBCs), Hemoglobin (Hb), mean
   corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), alanine
   aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), protein,
   chlorine (Cl), sodium (Na), and glucose. It did not have a significant
   effect on hematocrit (Ht), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration
   (MCHC), potassium (K), and monocytes. Finally, the results confirmed
   that the new polysaccharide has useful effects on the host, possibly
   acting as a probiotic by selectively motivating the activity of some
   useful bacteria, which can improve the host health. This is the first
   report on application of this polysaccharide for the health improvement
   of Atlantic salmon exposed to mercury chloride.},

Abstract = {The general term ``pesticide{''} includes a large number of substances
   that belong to many different chemical classes. Pesticides are applied
   to crops at various stages of cultivation to provide protection against
   weeds and pests, and during post-harvest storage to preserve quality.
   The list of which pesticides are authorized for use in Europe is
   available on EU pesticides Database. The QuEChERS approach is a method
   designed for the analysis of pesticides in fruits and vegetables. This
   method is based on an extraction and clean-up step; it has been designed
   to be Quick Easy Cheap Effective Rugged and Safe. The aim of this study
   was to modify the QuEChERS method to be applied in the analysis of 9
   organophosphate and 1 pyrethroid pesticides in raw materials for animal
   feeding introducing an additional liquid -liquid partition step. This
   additional step allowed us to concentrate the samples, avoiding any
   solvent evaporation, prior to the instrumental analysis. Once the method
   was optimized, it was carried out a pesticides quantization study using
   a GC-MS SIM multi-residue analysis. 45 samples of maize and soy coming
   from Northern Italy (Piedmont Region) were analysed during ten months.
   In 30 samples organophosphate pesticides were found up to 12.4 mg kg(-1)
   of Chlorpyrifos, while no Deltamethrin was detected. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Title = {Identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from caprine

Journal = {SMALL RUMINANT RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {104},
Number = {1-3},
Pages = {185-190},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are the most common cause of
   intramammary infection (IMI) in small ruminants. In this study, 143 CNS
   isolates were collected from 1385 sarda goats belonging to 29 herds with
   high somatic cell count scores. In order to make light of the role of
   CNS species in goat mastitis, all isolates were subjected to
   identification with the API Staph ID test, and then to amplification of
   staphylococcal groEL gene by PCR assay. Amplicons of groEL gene were
   submitted to restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis with the
   enzyme Alul. When PCR-RFLP patterns of CNS isolates were different from
   those of their reference strains, groEL gene amplicons were sequenced
   for definitive identification. The API Staph ID test, in alternative to
   the genotypic identification method, produced considerably different
   results in terms of species identified within each group. Using the
   PCR-RFLP assay, most of the isolates clustered together with the
   Staphylococcus epidermidis type strain (53, corresponding to 37\%),
   followed by S. caprae (45, corresponding to 31.4\%), S. chromogenes (19,
   corresponding to 13.2\%) and S. simulans (7 corresponding to 4.8\%). In
   conclusion, the PCR-RFLP assay of groEL gene is a more reliable and
   reproducible method than the API Staph ID test for the identification of
   CNS causing goats mastitis. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {82},

Abstract = {The seasonal rhythms reflect the ability of the endogenous adaptive
   mechanism to react in advance to the regular environmental changes
   associated with the seasons. It seems that these biochemical parameters
   are often influenced by a change in physiological status. The aim of
   this study was to assess the trend of annual variations of some
   biochemical parameters in dairy cows. The experimental subjects were ten
   dairy cows and the start of the experimental period coincided with the
   last month of pregnancy. These animals were monitored for one year and
   blood samples were collected every month. From the obtained sera, total
   bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, total cholesterol,
   non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), tryglicerides, beta-hydroxybutyrate,
   total proteins, calcium and phosphorus were assessed by means of an
   automated spectrophotometer. All the results were expressed as mean +/-
   standard deviation (SD). Data were normally distributed (P<0.05,
   Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). One method of repeated measurement, the
   Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), was applied to determine the effect of
   time during the experimental period (12 months) and P values of <0.05
   were considered statistically significant. Using cosinor-rhythmometry,
   three rhythmic parameters were determined: mesor (mean level), amplitude
   (half the range of oscillation) and acrophase (Phi, time of peak). A
   significant effect of time (P<0.0001) was shown for all the parameters,
   except for NEFA. After application of cosinor rhythmometry, only total
   bilirubin, creatinine, triglycerides and beta-hydroxybutyrate showed a
   seasonal rhythm. In conclusion we can affirm that our results supplement
   the current information available about the circannual changes in the
   metabolic activity of these animals and help us to evaluate the
   adaptation of these animals to environmental changes, together with the
   metabolic effect of calving and lactation.},

Abstract = {In order to estimate prevalence, levels and patterns of Listeria
   monocytogenes contamination, a total of 774 swine carcasses were traced
   along the Parma ham production chain. Analyses were conducted on
   isolates originated from the same carcass, collected at different stages
   during processing, resulting in 0.2\% (faeces at intestine removal from
   carcasses), 3.0\% (swabbing of carcasses), 12.5\% (fresh hams) and 2.0\%
   prevalence (dry-cured hams). The highest contamination levels of L
   monocytogenes were reached in fresh hams after cutting and were followed
   by a marked decrease during the subsequent processing stages. All the
   132 isolates were characterized by serotyping and Pulsed-Field Gel
   Electrophoresis (PFGE). Transfer of L monocytogenes between different
   stages of the processing chain was not reported, whereas processing
   itself has proved to be an important cause of contamination. The sole
   isolate of fecal origin belonged to a pulsotype that was uncommon to any
   of those recovered in carcasses, fresh hams and dry-cured hams,
   indicating that contaminations from farms does not significantly affect
   Parma ham production. For the majority of the strains isolated from the
   same production plants, PFGE profiles were highly similar. In several
   cases, the same pulsotypes were recurrently detected, over time, in
   carcasses and fresh ham samples sharing the same processing environment.
   A levels were also measured, showing that drying of the ham surface was
   able to induce a considerable decrease of the contamination levels,
   although unable to ultimately remove L monocytogenes. (C) 2011 Published

Title = {Growth and toxicity responses of Mediterranean Ostreopsis cf. ovata to
   seasonal irradiance and temperature conditions},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Pages = {25-34},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The genus Ostreopsis includes several species capable of producing
   various palytoxin-like compounds which have harmful effects on humans
   and marine fauna. Species in this genus are regular members of the
   epiphytic community in tropical seas but their geographic range have
   shown an apparent expansion towards temperate regions in recent years.
   This is the case of the Mediterranean Sea, where Ostreopsis cf. ovata is
   responsible for intense blooms in summer and autumn. With the aim of
   describing the growth performances of O. cf. ovata, we carried out a
   multifactorial experiment in which strains isolated from 3 locations
   along the Italian coast were grown at different combinations of
   temperature, daylength and irradiance encompassing different seasonal
   conditions.
   Temperature constiained growth of O. cf. ovata within a window of 18-30
   degrees C, while best performances were recorded at 22 and 26 degrees C.
   Growth was maximum at 12 h daylength, whereas it was limited by photon
   flux density at short daylength (9 h) and often showed photosaturation
   at the longest daylength (15 h). Cells with anomalous shape were found
   during the exponential phase at the lowest and highest temperatures,
   while cells with a reduced size were produced at all conditions except
   18 degrees C. Total toxin concentration varied between the different
   environmental conditions and between exponential and post-exponential
   growth phases without a clear pattern, whereas toxin composition was
   less variable. Our results suggest that O. cf. ovata is adapted to
   intermediate temperatures and daylength conditions such as those
   recorded in the natural environment at the beginning of summer and/or at
   the beginning of autumn, when this dinoflagellate builds up its biomass
   along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. Photosaturation instead occurs
   at the highest temperature and irradiance conditions, thus supporting
   the observations of generally lower cell abundances in late July-August.

Abstract = {The study was designed to evaluate anti-tumour properties of Iraqi
   propolis collected from Mosul region (M) on HL-60 and HCT-116 cell lines
   and on HCT-116 in vivo. M induced an inhibitory effect against the
   proliferation of HL-60 and colony potential of HCT-116 cells. The
   apoptosis in HL-60 cells was associated with down-regulation of Bcl-2
   and activation of Bax, while in HCT-116 cells, necrotic features were
   observed; size of cells was dramatically increased by swelling of
   cytoplasm and loss of membrane integrity, cell rupture and release of
   cellular contents. Analysis of BrdU/DNA cell cycle in both cell lines
   showed that M induced cell cycle perturbations in both BrdU positive and
   BrdU negative cells. The exposure of HL-60 to M caused gamma-H2AX in a
   dose dependent manner and was associated with induction of apoptosis.
   The experiments in HCT-116 tumor-bearing mice showed that oral
   administration of propolis at doses that caused no detectable toxicity
   was associated with a decrease in mitotic cells and an increase in
   endoreduplications, increased p53 and decreased Ki-67 expression of
   cells in tumor sections. This study provides the rationale to
   investigate the potential beneficial effect of propolis in the diet of
   patients receiving anti-cancer therapies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Until recently, transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) disease in
   cattle was thought to be caused by a single agent strain, bovine
   spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) (classical BSE or BSE-C). However, due
   to the initiation of a large-scale surveillance programme throughout
   Europe, two atypical BSE strains, bovine amyloidotic spongiform
   encephalopathy (BASE, also named BSE-L) and BSE-H have since been
   discovered. These atypical BSE isolates have been previously transmitted
   to a range of transgenic mouse models overexpressing PrP from different
   species at different levels, on a variety of genetic backgrounds. To
   control for genetic background and expression level in the analysis of
   these isolates, we performed here a comprehensive comparison of the
   neuropathological and molecular properties of all three BSE agents
   (BASE, BSE-C and BSE-H) upon transmission into the same gene-targeted
   transgenic mouse line expressing the bovine prion protein (Bov6) and a
   wild-type control of the same genetic background. Significantly, upon
   challenge with these BSE agents, we found that BASE did not produce
   shorter survival times in these mice compared with BSE-C, contrary to
   previous studies using overexpressing bovine transgenic mice. Amyloid
   plaques were only present in mice challenged with atypical BSE and
   neuropathological features, including intensity of PrP deposition in the
   brain and severity of vacuolar degeneration were less pronounced in BASE
   compared with BSE-C-challenged mice.},

Abstract = {Clostridium botulinum types C and D, as well as their mosaic variants
   C-D and D-C, are associated with avian and mammalian botulism. This
   study reports on the development of low-density macroarrays based on the
   GeneDisc cycler platform (Pall-Gene-Disc Technologies) applied to the
   simultaneous detection of the C. botulinum subtypes C, C-D, D, and D-C.
   The limit of detection of the PCR assays was 38 fg of total DNA,
   corresponding to 15 genome copies. Artificially contaminated samples of
   cecum showed a limit of detection below 50 spores/g. The tests were
   performed with a large variety of bacterial strains, including C.
   botulinum types C (n = 12), C-D (n = 29), D (n = 5), and D-C (n = 10),
   other botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT)-producing Clostridium strains (n =
   20), non-BoNT-producing clostridia (n = 20), and other bacterial species
   (n = 23), and showed a high specificity. These PCR assays were compared
   to previously published real-time PCRs for the detection of C. botulinum
   in 292 samples collected from cases of botulism events in four European
   regions. The majority of the samples originated from wild birds (n =
   108), poultry (n = 60), and bovines (n = 56). Among the 292 samples, 144
   were positive for either the bont/C-D or the bont/D-C gene by using the
   GeneDisc arrays. The reliability of the results tallied to 97.94\%.
   Interestingly, only BoNT mosaics, types C-D and D-C, were found in
   naturally contaminated samples whatever their animal origin and their
   geographical location. Further investigations should now be performed in
   order to check that mosaic types dominate in Europe and that acquisition
   of mosaic types helps in survival or adaptation to particular niche.},

Title = {Plasma levels of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-4 and IL-10 during a course of
   experimental contagious bovine pleuropneumonia},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {8},
Month = {APR 25},
Abstract = {Background: Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia (CBPP), caused by
   Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides, is widespread in sub-Saharan
   Africa. The current live vaccine T1/44 has limited efficacy and
   occasionally leads to severe side effects in the animals. A better
   understanding of the immune responses triggered by Mycoplasma mycoides
   subsp. mycoides and their role in disease progression will help to
   facilitate the design of a rational vaccine. Currently, knowledge of
   cytokines involved in immunity and immunopathology in CBPP is rather
   limited. The aim of this study was to characterize the in vivo plasma
   concentrations of the cytokines TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-10 and
   the overall role of CD4(+) T cells in the development of cytokine levels
   during a primary infection. Plasma cytokine concentrations in two groups
   of cattle (CD4(+) T cell-depleted and non-depleted cattle)
   experimentally infected with Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides were
   measured and their relationship to the clinical outcomes was
   investigated.
   Results: Plasma cytokine concentrations varied between animals in each
   group. Depletion of CD4(+) T cells did not induce significant changes in
   plasma levels of TNF-alpha, IL-4, and IL-10, suggesting a minor role of
   CD4(+) T cells in regulation or production of the three cytokines during
   the time window of depletion (1-2 weeks post depletion). Unexpectedly,
   the IFN-gamma concentrations were slightly, but statistically
   significantly higher in the depleted group (p < 0.05) between week three
   and four post infection. Three CD4(+) T cell-depleted animals that
   experienced severe disease, had high levels of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma.
   Only one severely diseased non-depleted animal showed a high serum
   concentration of IL-4 post infection.
   Conclusions: Comparison of most severely diseased animals, which had to
   be euthanized prior to the expected date, versus less severe diseased
   animals, irrespective of the depletion status, suggested that high
   TNF-alpha levels are correlated with more severe pathology in
   concomitance with high IFN-gamma levels.},

Title = {Evaluating Surveillance Strategies for the Early Detection of Low
   Pathogenicity Avian Influenza Infections},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 24},
Abstract = {In recent years, the early detection of low pathogenicity avian
   influenza (LPAI) viruses in poultry has become increasingly important,
   given their potential to mutate into highly pathogenic viruses. However,
   evaluations of LPAI surveillance have mainly focused on prevalence and
   not on the ability to act as an early warning system. We used a
   simulation model based on data from Italian LPAI epidemics in turkeys to
   evaluate different surveillance strategies in terms of their performance
   as early warning systems. The strategies differed in terms of sample
   size, sampling frequency, diagnostic tests, and whether or not active
   surveillance (i.e., routine laboratory testing of farms) was performed,
   and were also tested under different epidemiological scenarios. We
   compared surveillance strategies by simulating within-farm outbreaks.
   The output measures were the proportion of infected farms that are
   detected and the farm reproduction number (Rh). The first one provides
   an indication of the sensitivity of the surveillance system to detect
   within-farm infections, whereas Rh reflects the effectiveness of
   outbreak detection (i.e., if detection occurs soon enough to bring an
   epidemic under control). Increasing the sampling frequency was the most
   effective means of improving the timeliness of detection (i.e., it
   occurs earlier), whereas increasing the sample size increased the
   likelihood of detection. Surveillance was only effective in preventing
   an epidemic if actions were taken within two days of sampling. The
   strategies were not affected by the quality of the diagnostic test,
   although performing both serological and virological assays increased
   the sensitivity of active surveillance. Early detection of LPAI
   outbreaks in turkeys can be achieved by increasing the sampling
   frequency for active surveillance, though very frequent sampling may not
   be sustainable in the long term. We suggest that, when no LPAI virus is
   circulating yet and there is a low risk of virus introduction, a less
   frequent sampling approach might be admitted, provided that the
   surveillance is intensified as soon as the first outbreak is detected.},

Abstract = {Although swine origin A/H1N1/2009 influenza virus (hereafter
   ``pH1N1{''}) has been detected in swine in 20 countries, there has been
   no published surveillance of the virus in African livestock. The
   objective of this study was to assess the circulation of influenza A
   viruses, including pH1N1 in swine in Cameroon, Central Africa. We
   collected 108 nasal swabs and 98 sera samples from domestic pigs
   randomly sampled at 11 herds in villages and farms in Cameroon. pH1N1
   was isolated from two swine sampled in northern Cameroon in January
   2010. Sera from 28\% of these herds were positive for influenza A by
   competitive ELISA and 92.6\% of these swine showed cross reactivity with
   pandemic A/H1N1/2009 influenza virus isolated from humans. These results
   provide the first evidence of this virus in the animal population in
   Africa. In light of the significant role of swine in the ecology of
   influenza viruses, our results call for greater monitoring and study in
   Central Africa. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the antimicrobial
   resistance rates and the trend in resistance of Actinobacillus
   pleuropneumoniae isolated from pigs in Italy from 1994 to 2009. A total
   of 992 A. pleuropneumoniae isolates were tested for their susceptibility
   to a panel of antimicrobial agents in a disk diffusion method.
   Resistance to 7 drugs (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid,
   ampicillin, cefquinome, cotrimoxazole, penicillin G and tilmicosin)
   showed a significant increasing trend over the time, while for 2 drugs
   (gentamycin and marbofloxacin) a significant decrease was observed.
   Resistance to the remaining 14 antimicrobial agents tested did not
   change significantly over the study period. Most of the isolates
   retained high susceptibility to antimicrobials usually effective against
   A. pleuropneumoniae such as amphenicols, fluoroquinolones and ceftiofur.
   However, high rates of resistance were observed for potentiated sulfa
   drugs, tetracyclines and penicillins which are currently recommended
   antimicrobials for pig pleuropneumonia therapy. Our results suggest the
   importance of continued monitoring of A. pleuropneumoniae clinical
   isolates in order to choose the most appropriate treatment of infections
   and to control the increase of resistance to currently used
   antimicrobials. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Molecular xenomonitoring of Dirofilaria immitis and Dirofilaria repens
   in mosquitoes from north-eastern Italy by real-time PCR coupled with
   melting curve analysis},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {5},
Month = {APR 20},
Abstract = {Background: Dirofilaria immitis and Dirofilaria repens are transmitted
   by bloodsucking culicid mosquitoes belonging to Culex, Aedes,
   Ochlerotatus, Anopheles and Mansonia genera.
   The detection of filarioids in mosquitoes for assessing distribution of
   vectors and/or of pathogens in a given area (also known as
   ``xenomonitoring{''}), when based on individual dissection of
   wild-caught female mosquitoes is time consuming and hardly applicable in
   large epidemiological surveys. Our study aimed to evaluate the recently
   developed duplex real-time PCR for screening large number of culicids
   and to assess their positivity for D. immitis and D. repens in an area
   where both species are endemic.
   Methods: A duplex real-time PCR was used to detect and differentiate D.
   immitis and D. repens in mosquitoes collected in six provinces of the
   Veneto region using 43 carbon dioxide-baited traps under the frame of an
   entomological surveillance program to monitor the vectors of West Nile
   disease. From early May till October 2010, unfed female mosquitoes (n =
   40,892) were captured in 20 selected sites.
   Results: Mosquitoes identified as Culex pipiens, Ochlerotatus caspius,
   Aedes vexans and Culex modestus were grouped into 995 pools according to
   species, day and site of collection (from minimum of 1 to maximum of
   57). Out of 955 pools, 23 (2.41 \%) scored positive for Dirofilaria spp.
   of which, 21 (2.2 \%) for D. immitis and two (0.21 \%) for D. repens. An
   overall Estimated Rate of Infection (ERI) of 0.06 \% was recorded, being
   higher in Och. caspius and Ae. vexans (i.e., 0.18 \% and 0.14 \%,
   respectively). At least one mosquito pool was positive for Dirofilaria
   spp. in each province with the highest ERI recorded in Vicenza and
   Padova provinces (i.e., 0.42\% and 0.16 \%, respectively). Mosquitoes
   collected in all provinces were positive for D. immitis whereas, only
   two (i.e., Padova and Rovigo) provinces scored positive for D. repens.
   All mosquito species, except for Cx. modestus, were positive for D.
   immitis, whereas D. repens was only found in Cx. pipiens.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that both Dirofilaria species are
   endemic and may occur in sympatry in the examined area. The molecular
   approach herein used represents a powerful tool for surveillance
   programs of D. immitis and D. repens in the culicid vectors towards a
   better understanding of the epidemiology of the infections they cause
   and their seasonal transmission patterns.},

Abstract = {Current carcinogenesis theory states that only a small subset of tumor
   cells, the cancer stem cells or tumor initiating cells (TICs), are
   responsible for tumor formation and progression. Human breast
   cancer-initiating cells have been identified as CD44-expressing cells,
   which retain tumorigenic activity and display stem cell like properties.
   Spontaneous feline mammary carcinoma (FMC) is an aggressive cancer,
   which shows biological similarities to the human tumor counterpart.
   We report the isolation and phenotypic characterization of FMC-derived
   stem/progenitor cells, showing in vitro self-renewal, long-lasting
   proliferation and in vivo tumorigenicity. Twenty-one FMC samples were
   collected, histologically classified and characterized for the
   expression of Ki67, EGFR, ER-alpha and CD44, by immunohistochemistry. By
   culture in stem cell permissive conditions, we isolated, from 13 FMCs, a
   CD44-positive subpopulation able to survive and proliferate in vitro as
   mammospheres of different sizes and morphologies. When injected in
   NOD/SCID mice, FMC stem-like cells initiate tumors, generating cell
   heterogeneity and recapitulating the original histotype. In
   serum-containing medium, spheroid cells showed differentiation
   properties as shown by morphological changes, the loss of CD44
   expression and tumorigenic potential.
   These data show that stem-defined culture of FMC enriches for TICs and
   validate the use of these cells as a suitable model for comparative
   oncology studies of mammary biology and testing therapeutic strategies
   aimed at eradicating TICs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Test methods have to be developed by laboratories for official control
   to monitor possible misuse of veterinary drugs in animal productions,
   also through feeding stuff. A novel method for identification and
   quantification of levamisole in feeds by liquid chromatography coupled
   to electrospray mass spectrometry in an ion trap (LC/ESI-MS/MS) is
   herein described; after a single-step cleanup by liquid-liquid
   extraction from the feed and separation by reversed-phase liquid
   chromatography, levamisole was determined and unambiguously confirmed by
   tandem mass spectrometry, on the basis of two product ions. The method
   was in-house validated, according to the Regulation 882/2004/EC,
   evaluating trueness, repeatability, within-laboratory reproducibility,
   ruggedness, specificity, and the limit of quantification (LOQ). The
   method is reliable and specific for complete and complementary feeds for
   pigs, cattle, rabbits and poultry; very good mean recoveries (higher
   than 92 \%) and precision (RSD values < 15.2\%) were attained. The LOQ
   at 2.0mg/kg was verified. Moreover, we describe how the method was
   developed to support Italian Police investigations regarding illegal
   treatments of pigs; in this case, since the drug(s) added to the feed
   were unknown, a preliminary untargeted analysis was performed by full
   scan mass spectrometry on an ion trap, from 50 up to 2000m/z; the
   presence of levamisole was hypothesised, on the basis of the most
   abundant ion and its fragmentation pattern. Then, levamisole was
   unambiguously confirmed by the ion trap LC/ESI-MS/MS method. Copyright

Title = {West Nile virus: characterization and diagnostic applications of
   monoclonal antibodies},
Journal = {VIROLOGY JOURNAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {9},
Month = {APR 13},
Abstract = {Background: Diagnosis of West Nile virus (WNV) infections is often
   difficult due to the extensive antigenic cross-reactivity among
   flaviviruses, especially in geographic regions where two or more of
   these viruses are present causing sequential infections. The purpose of
   this study was to characterize a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs)
   produced against WNV to verify their applicability in WNV diagnosis and
   in mapping epitope targets of neutralizing MAbs.
   Methods: Six MAbs were produced and characterized by isotyping,
   virus-neutralization, western blotting and MAb-epitope competition. The
   MAb reactivity against various WNVs belonging to lineage 1 and 2 and
   other related flaviviruses was also evaluated. The molecular basis of
   epitopes recognized by neutralizing MAbs was defined through the
   selection and sequencing of MAb escape mutants. Competitive binding
   assays between MAbs and experimental equine and chicken sera were
   designed to identify specific MAb reaction to epitopes with high
   immunogenicity.
   Results: All MAbs showed stronger reactivity with all WNVs tested and
   good competition for antigen binding in ELISA tests with WNV-positive
   equine and chicken sera. Four MAbs (3B2, 3D6, 4D3, 1C3) resulted
   specific for WNV, while two MAbs (2A8, 4G9) showed cross-reaction with
   Usutu virus. Three MAbs (3B2, 3D6, 4D3) showed neutralizing activity.
   Sequence analysis of 3B2 and 3D6 escape mutants showed an amino acid
   change at E307 (Lys -> Glu) in the E protein gene, whereas 4D3 variants
   identified mutations encoding amino acid changed at E276 (Ser -> Ile) or
   E278 (Thr -> Ile). 3B2 and 3D6 mapped to a region on the lateral surface
   of domain III of E protein, which is known to be a specific and strong
   neutralizing epitope for WNV, while MAb 4D3 recognized a novel specific
   neutralizing epitope on domain II of E protein that has not previously
   been described with WNV MAbs.
   Conclusions: MAbs generated in this study can be applied to various
   analytical methods for virological and serological WNV diagnosis. A
   novel WNV-specific and neutralizing MAb (4D3) directed against the
   unknown epitope on domain II of E protein can be useful to better
   understand the role of E protein epitopes involved in the mechanism of
   WNV neutralization.},

Abstract = {Veterinary training plays a crucial role in increasing effectiveness of
   veterinary response to epidemic and non-epidemic emergencies. Being able
   to assess learning needs and to deliver training is acknowledged as a
   strategic priority in veterinary public health activities. The
   validation of an e-learning system that is able to respond to the urgent
   needs of veterinary professionals to ensure the despatch of rapid
   teaching methods on emerging and re-emerging animal diseases and
   zoonoses was the core of a research project developed in the
   Mediterranean Basin between 2005 and 2009. The project. validated a new
   transferable, sustainable and repeatable learning model, the main
   components of which are described. The model is applied to an emergency
   situation that occurred in Italy in 2008, when West Nile disease
   outbreaks were reported in northern Italy. Approximately 450 official
   veterinarians were trained, using an e-learning system that showed
   adaptability and effectiveness in transferring knowledge, skills and
   competence to face the situation. The case was used to validate the
   effectiveness of the model and proved that it can be applied in any
   emergency situation, i.e. every time that rapid dissemination of
   knowledge and skills is required.},

Abstract = {Aims: Eating raw or insufficiently cooked bivalve molluscs contaminated
   with human noroviruses (NVs) can result in acute cases of
   gastroenteritis in humans. Manila clams (Ruditapes philippinarum) are
   particularly prone to exposure to NVs due to the brackish environment in
   which they are farmed which is known to be susceptible to human faecal
   contamination. High hydrostatic pressure processing (HHP) is a food
   treatment technique that has been shown to inactivate NV.
   Methods and results: In this study we investigated the ability of HHP to
   inactivate murine norovirus (MNV-1), a recognised surrogate for NV, in
   experimentally contaminated manila clams. Pools of contaminated live
   clams were subjected to hydrostatic pressure ranging from 300 to 500 MPa
   for different time intervals of between one and 10 min. The trial was
   repeated three times, at monthly intervals.
   Conclusions: Virus vitality post-treatment was assessed and the data
   obtained indicates that the use of high hydrostatic pressures of at
   least 500 MPa for 1 min was effective in inactivating MNV-1.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: HHP results to be an effective
   technique that could be applied to industrial process to obtain safe
   Manila clams ready to eat.},

Title = {The effects of different environmental conditions on thermoregulation
   and clinical and hematological variables in long-distance
   road-transported calves},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of long-distance
   road transport (19 h, from Poland to Italy) during 2 seasons (summer vs.
   winter) on clinical and hematological variables in calves. The
   environmental temperature range that could compromise the
   thermoregulation system (thermal stress) of the calves was tested. For
   the 7 Holstein calves in each transport, the BW and rectal temperature
   (RT) were measured, and blood samples were collected at the farm of
   origin, before loading at the transit center (T2), after unloading at
   the farm of destination (T3), and 1, 2, 3, and 4 d after arrival. The
   body temperature (BT) and heart rate (HR) were continuously monitored
   from T2 to T3. The data were statistically analyzed according to a mixed
   model that considered the fixed effects of transport (repeated
   measurements), season of journey, and their interaction. Within the
   observed temperature-humidity index (THI) range (30 to 80), effective
   thermoregulation allowed the calves to maintain their BT with small
   physiologic changes to prevent thermal stress, particularly in the
   summer. With no seasonal differences, the HR was greater at loading than
   unloading (120 vs. 115 beats per min; P = 0.012). As for the transport
   effect, the BW was less (P < 0.001) after unloading, and the RT was
   greater (P = 0.004). This effect was more marked in summer. The
   hematological variables indicated a moderate effect of transport on the
   hydration condition, reactive and muscular systems, and metabolism,
   although hematocrit (P = 0.004), erythrocytes, cortisol, NEFA,
   beta-hydroxybutyrate, lactate, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase,
   and aspartate aminotransferase activity (P < 0.001), and total protein
   (P = 0.007) were greater after unloading. This was confirmed by a
   moderate decrease in total leukocytes (P = 0.031) and glucose
   concentration (P = 0.002). The changes in the clinical variables were
   similar for both seasons even though in the summer, hematocrit (P <
   0.001), urea (P = 0.008), and total protein (P = 0.010) increased and
   glucose concentration (P = 0.038) decreased. In conclusion, the data did
   not show a pronounced effect attributable to the season of the journey.
   Long-distance road transport leads to notable changes in clinical and
   hematological variables at the end of the journey. However, these
   variables remained within their physiological ranges and returned to
   basal values within a few days after the journey.},

Abstract = {A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA), an indirect
   ELISA (i-ELISA) and a dissociation-enhanced lanthanide fluorescence
   immunoassay (DELFIA) were developed to test for antibodies to Brucella
   suis in pig and wild boar sera. An anti-Brucella-LPS monoclonal antibody
   (MAb 4B5A) (c-ELISA and DELFIA) and an anti-swine IgG monoclonal
   antibody (MAb 10C2G5) (i-ELISA) were used for the three assays. The
   specificity (Sp) and sensitivity (Se) of the assays gave the following
   results: Se and Sp = 100\% at a cut-off value of 61.0\% (B/B-0\%) for
   c-ELISA; Sp = 99.1\% and Se = 100\% at a cut-off value of 21.7\%
   (percentage positivity: PP\%) for i-ELISA; Sp = 91.0\% and Se = 75\% at
   a cut-off value of 37.0\% (B/B-0\%) for DELFIA. In addition, the
   performance of a commercial fluorescence polarisation assay (FPA),
   standardised for bovine sera, was evaluated in swine sera. The
   specificity and sensitivity obtained were both 100\% at a cut-off value
   of 99.5 (millipolarisation unit values). These results suggest that the
   combination of c-ELISA, i-ELISA and FPA can be used to improve the
   serological diagnosis of swine brucellosis.},

Abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is an emerging disease among wild animals in
   many parts of the world. Wildlife reservoir hosts may thus represent a
   potential source of infection for livestock and humans. We investigated
   the role played by the Sicilian black pig, an autochthonous free-or
   semi-free-ranging domestic pig breed, as a potential source of bTB
   infection in an area where bTB prevalence in cattle is high. We
   initially performed a preliminary field study to assess the occurrence
   of bTB in such animals. We sampled 119 pigs at abattoir and found 6.7\%
   and 3.4\% of them to be affected by gross tuberculous-like lesions (TBL)
   and Myco-bacterium bovis culture positive, respectively. We then
   proceeded to investigate the dissemination and characteristics of
   lesions in a second field study performed on 100 animals sampled from
   infected herds. Here, tissues collected at the abattoir were examined
   macroscopically, microscopically, and by culture tests. Most pigs with
   TBL showed generalized lesions in both gross and histological
   examinations (53\% and 65.5\%, respectively). Head lymph nodes were the
   most frequently affected in both localized and generalized TB cases
   observed macroscopically and microscopically. M. bovis was the most
   frequently isolated etiologic agent. The molecular characterization of
   isolates from both field studies by spoligotyping and analysis of 12
   mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit-variable number tandem repeat
   (MIRU-VNTR) loci, followed by their comparison to isolates of cattle
   origin, suggested a potential transmission of mycobacteria from domestic
   animals to black pigs and vice versa. Our findings, along with
   ethological, ecological, and management considerations, suggest that the
   black pig might act as a bTB reservoir in the ecosystem under study.
   However, additional studies will be necessary to establish the true
   epidemiological significance of the Sicilian black pig.},

Abstract = {The transmission of pestiviruses between domestic and wild ruminants has
   not been documented in communal alpine pastures shared between wildlife
   and livestock. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of
   domestic and wild ungulates species from Varaita Valley (SW Italian
   Alps) in the epidemiology of Pestivirus infections. Sera from
   free-ranging alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) and roe deer
   (Capreolus capreolus) were collected from 1994 to 2009 and 2001 to 2009,
   respectively. Also, sera from cattle and sheep sampled in 2009 were
   studied. Sera were tested for the presence of antibodies against
   pestivirus with an ELISA assay. Sera from positive animals were
   subsequently tested with a comparative virus neutralisation test using
   the BVDV-NADL and BDV-137/4 strains. Sera were tested for the presence
   of pestiviral antigen and the presence of viral RNA with a commercial
   ELISA assay and RT-PCR. Antibodies against Pestivirus were detected in
   132 out of 312 (42\%) chamois, in 30 out of 175 (17\%) cattle and 6 out
   of 24 (25\%) sheep. No antibodies were found in roe deer. No Pestivirus
   antigen or RNA was detected in any of the samples. Results indicate
   circulation of pestiviruses among the studied chamois, cattle and sheep
   populations. However the role of wild ungulates in the dynamics of
   Pestivirus infection is still unknown and monitoring the presence of
   these viruses in wild ungulates would be of importance, especially in
   the chamois population, where pestiviruses seem to circulate
   extensively.},

Title = {Receptor-Binding Profiles of H7 Subtype Influenza Viruses in Different

Abstract = {Influenza viruses of gallinaceous poultry and wild aquatic birds usually
   have distinguishable receptor-binding properties. Here we used a panel
   of synthetic sialylglycopolymers and solid-phase receptor-binding assays
   to characterize receptor-binding profiles of about 70 H7 influenza
   viruses isolated from aquatic birds, land-based poultry, and horses in
   Eurasia and America. Unlike typical duck influenza viruses with non-H7
   hemagglutinin (HA), all avian H7 influenza viruses, irrespective of the
   host species, displayed a poultry-virus-like binding specificity, i.e.,
   preferential binding to sulfated oligosaccharides Neu5Ac alpha 2-3Gal
   beta 1-4(6-O-HSO3)GlcNAc and Neu5Ac alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4(Fuc alpha
   1-3)(6-O-HSO3)GlcNAc. This phenotype correlated with the unique amino
   acid sequence of the amino acid 185 to 189 loop of H7 HA and seemed to
   be dependent on ionic interactions between the sulfate group of the
   receptor and Lys193 and on the lack of sterical clashes between the
   fucose residue and Gln222. Many North American and Eurasian H7 influenza
   viruses displayed weak but detectable binding to the human-type receptor
   moiety Neu5Ac alpha 2-6Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc, highlighting the potential of
   H7 influenza viruses for avian-to-human transmission. Equine H7
   influenza viruses differed from other viruses by preferential binding to
   the N-glycolyl form of sialic acid. Our data suggest that the
   receptor-binding site of contemporary H7 influenza viruses in aquatic
   and terrestrial birds was formed after the introduction of their common
   precursor from ducks to a new host, presumably, gallinaceous poultry.
   The uniformity of the receptor-binding profile of H7 influenza viruses
   in various wild and domestic birds indicates that there is no strong
   receptor-mediated host range restriction in birds on viruses with this
   HA subtype. This notion agrees with repeated interspecies transmission
   of H7 influenza viruses from aquatic birds to poultry.},

Abstract = {The circadian rhythms have evolved in domestic animals in more different
   breeding management, and reflect an adaptive mechanism to react in
   advance to the regular environmental changes. The aim of this research
   was to evaluate the circadian rhythm of haematological parameters in
   cows and to study if Brucella abortus infection in cows can alterate
   their rhythmicity. For this purpose, five healthy cows and five Brucella
   infected cows were enrolled. Blood samples were collected in spring
   (sunrise 06: 30, sunset 19.00), every 4 h over a 24 h period, starting
   at 12: 00 on day 1 and finishing at 12: 00 on day 2, and a complete
   blood cell count with differential was performed. One-way ANOVA for
   repeated measures was applied to evaluate the effect of time on
   haematological parameters. Using cosinor rhythmometry, four rhythmic
   parameters were determined: mesor, amplitude, acrophase and robustness.
   One-way repeated measures Analysis of Variance were applied to evaluate
   a significant effect of time of day on each parameter. P values <0.05
   were considered statistically significant. The application of one-way
   ANOVA showed a statistical significant effect of time of day on
   haematocrit (PCV) and haemoglobin (Hb) in healthy cows. In
   Brucella-infected cows, statistical significant changes of neutrophils,
   eosinophils and lymphocytes were observed. Using Cosinor method, the
   same parameters showed a daily rhythmicity.
   Our results showed that a daily rhythmicity exists both for healthy and
   infected cows, but in different haematological parameters. In
   particular, hemoglobin, and hematocrit in and neutrophils, eosinophils
   and lymphocytes in. This study is a preliminary observation in changes
   of circadian clocks during pathological events in domestic animals. In
   particular, further investigations should be conducted to evaluate how
   the molecular clock components are influenced not only by an
   inflammatory response but contemporarily by a change in L/D cycles.},

Abstract = {Following a resurgence of fox rabies in northeastern Italy in 2008-2009,
   two emergency oral rabies vaccination (ORV) campaigns were performed in
   the Alpine mountain ranges in 2009 and 2010 using aerial distribution to
   prevent the disease from spreading further inland. Vaccine baits were
   distributed only below the freezing point altitude, 1000 m above sea
   level (a.s.l.) in December 2009-January 2010 and 1500 m a.s.l. in
   April-May 2010, to avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Spatial analysis
   unexpectedly identified fox rabies hotspots above the threshold
   altitudes, probably representing local residual rabies foci which may
   have contributed to maintaining the infectious cycle in areas not
   vaccinated at higher altitudes. Based on the results obtained, in May
   2010, the second ORV campaign was extended to include threshold
   altitudes of up to 2300 m a.s.l. to eliminate residual foci. The
   observations made may help in the formulation of ORV strategies in
   countries sharing similar topographical features.},

Title = {An assessment of genetic variability in the mitochondrial cytochrome c

Abstract = {This study investigates sequence variation in mitochondrial cytochrome c
   oxidase subunit 1 gene within Cercopithifilaria sp. recorded recently in
   Italy. Fourteen sequence types (haplotypes) were characterized for 163
   (7.7\%) amplicons from 2111 Genomic DNA samples prepared from skin
   samples from dogs and from Rhipicephalus sanguineus (ticks) from
   different geographical areas of the Mediterranean basin (i.e., Italy,
   Spain and Greece). The most prevalent sequence types represented
   haplotypes I (70.5\%) and X (16.0\%), followed by haplotype VIII (4.9\%)
   and other 11 haplotypes (8.6\%). Three haplotypes (II, V and VI) were
   found exclusively in ticks. The overall intraspecific nucleotide
   variation among pcox1 haplotypes ranged from 0.4 to 3.5\% (mean =
   1.6\%), whereas a mean interspecific difference of 9.5\% was detected as
   compared with other onchocercids. Phylogenetic analysis of the
   nucleotide sequence data showed a clustering of Cercopithifilaria sp.
   with the other Cercopithifilaria species (with strong statistical
   support) to the exclusion of other onchocercids. The number of
   haplotypes identified here might be explained by complex ecology and
   transmission patterns as well as the high mutation rate of mitochondrial
   DNA and/or inbreeding associated with hosts and their vectors. (C) 2011

Abstract = {Usutu virus is a mosquito-borne virus first isolated from Culex naevei
   in South Africa in 1959. The first emergence of Usutu virus outside
   Africa was recorded in Austria. Here, a phylogenetic analysis targeting
   the E5 and NS5 genes was carried out on the viral strains circulating in
   Europe. The NS5 gene tree showed two main clades, one of which included
   the Italian sequences. In the E gene tree all sequences grouped into the
   same main clade, with sequences from Austria divided into two separate
   clusters. Only sites under negative selective pressure were found in E
   and NS5 proteins. The results suggest that Usutu virus circulating in
   Europe has a degree of genetic diversity higher than expected and that
   infection may arise from different sources.},

Abstract = {The occurrence of Salmonella is a global challenge in the public health
   and food production sectors. Our study investigated the prevalence,
   serovar and antimicrobial susceptibility of strains of Salmonella
   serovars isolated from animal feed (meat-and-bone and blood meal)
   samples from two commercial abattoirs in Namibia. A total of 650 samples
   (n = 650) were examined for the presence of Salmonella. Results showed
   that 10.9\% (n = 71) were positive for Salmonella. Of the Salmonella
   serovars isolated, S. Chester was the most commonly isolated serovar
   (19.7\%), followed by S. Schwarzengrund at 12.7\%. From the Salmonella
   isolates, 19.7\% (n = 14) were resistant to one or more of the
   antimicrobials (nalidixic acid, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,
   sulfisoxazole, streptomycin and/or tetracycline), whereas 80.3\% (n =
   57) were susceptible to all 16 antimicrobials tested. Resistance to
   sulfisoxazole and the trimethroprim-suflamethoxazole combination were
   the most common. The resistant isolates belonged to ten different
   Salmonella serovars. The susceptibility of most of the Salmonella
   isolated to the antimicrobials tested indicates that antimicrobial
   resistance is not as common and extensive in Namibia as has been
   reported in many other countries. It also appears that there is a range
   of antimicrobials available that are effective in managing Salmonella
   infections in Namibia. However, there is some evidence that resistance
   is developing and this will need further monitoring to ensure it does
   not become a problem.},

Journal = {AQUACULTURE},

Abstract = {To validate the use of imaging techniques to evaluate tissue damage in
   vivo, ten European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) were anesthetized
   with MS-222 and experimentally infected with nematode larvae collected
   from three Lepidopus caudatus. Live nematode larvae were introduced by
   gastroscopy into the stomach of ten fish. Another challenge was
   performed 15 days later. After a 60 day period, an explorative
   celioscopy was carried out. Fish were examined for Anisakis larvae and
   biopsy samples were collected. Parasites sampled from L caudatus and D.
   labrax were morphologically identified at genus level. Biopsy samples
   were routinely processed for histopathology. Some larvae were sampled
   for PCR. At gastroscopic exam 15 days after the first challenge some
   live nematode larvae were found within the lumen of the stomach in four
   fish. Two months later, at celioscopy, four sea bass showed hemorrhages
   and/or irregular neoformations within the celomic cavity. Within each of
   these changes a single nematode larva was detected. Histopathology
   showed hemorrhagic lesions with a cystic aspect. Parasite larvae were
   identified as 13 stages Anisakis Type I. PCR-RFLP analysis has allowed
   the identification of larvae isolated as Anisakis pegreffii. Endoscopy
   is a suitable noninvasive procedure for evaluation of experimental
   challenges in sea bass using live Anisakis larvae. The evidence of
   tissue change is an unusual occurrence in fish parasitized by Anisakis.
   The paper sets out to assess the damage anisakid nematodes induce in
   infected fish by imaging techniques. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Occurrence and identification of risk areas of Ixodes ricinus-borne
   pathogens: a cost-effectiveness analysis in north-eastern Italy},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAR 27},
Abstract = {Background: Ixodes ricinus, a competent vector of several pathogens, is
   the tick species most frequently reported to bite humans in Europe. The
   majority of human cases of Lyme borreliosis (LB) and tick-borne
   encephalitis (TBE) occur in the north-eastern region of Italy. The aims
   of this study were to detect the occurrence of endemic and emergent
   pathogens in north-eastern Italy using adult tick screening, and to
   identify areas at risk of pathogen transmission. Based on our results,
   different strategies for tick collection and pathogen screening and
   their relative costs were evaluated and discussed.
   Methods: From 2006 to 2008 adult ticks were collected in 31 sites and
   molecularly screened for the detection of pathogens previously reported
   in the same area (i.e., LB agents, TBE virus, Anaplasma phagocytophilum,
   Rickettsia spp., Babesia spp., ``Candidatus Neoehrlichia
   mikurensis{''}). Based on the results of this survey, three sampling
   strategies were evaluated a-posteriori, and the impact of each strategy
   on the final results and the overall cost reductions were analyzed. The
   strategies were as follows: tick collection throughout the year and
   testing of female ticks only (strategy A); collection from April to June
   and testing of all adult ticks (strategy B); collection from April to
   June and testing of female ticks only (strategy C).
   Results: Eleven pathogens were detected in 77 out of 193 ticks collected
   in 14 sites. The most common microorganisms detected were Borrelia
   burgdorferi sensu lato (17.6\%), Rickettsia helvetica (13.1\%), and
   ``Ca. N. mikurensis{''} (10.5\%). Within the B. burgdorferi complex,
   four genotypes (i.e., B. valaisiana, B. garinii, B. afzelii, and B.
   burgdorferi sensu stricto) were found. Less prevalent pathogens included
   R. monacensis (3.7\%), TBE virus (2.1\%), A. phagocytophilum (1.5\%),
   Bartonella spp. (1\%), and Babesia EU1 (0.5\%). Co-infections by more
   than one pathogen were diagnosed in 22\% of infected ticks. The
   prevalences of infection assessed using the three alternative strategies
   were in accordance with the initial results, with 13, 11, and 10 out of
   14 sites showing occurrence of at least one pathogen, respectively. The
   strategies A, B, and C proposed herein would allow to reduce the
   original costs of sampling and laboratory analyses by one third, half,
   and two thirds, respectively. Strategy B was demonstrated to represent
   the most cost-effective choice, offering a substantial reduction of
   costs, as well as reliable results.
   Conclusions: Monitoring of tick-borne diseases is expensive,
   particularly in areas where several zoonotic pathogens co-occur.
   Cost-effectiveness studies can support the choice of the best monitoring
   strategy, which should take into account the ecology of the area under
   investigation, as well as the available budget.},

Title = {The gene expression profiles of canine mammary cancer cells grown with
   carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as a co-culture in vitro},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAR 27},
Abstract = {Background: It is supposed that fibroblasts present in tumour
   microenvironment increase cancer invasiveness and its ability to
   metastasize but the mechanisms have not been clearly defined yet. Thus,
   the current study was designed to assess changes in gene expression in
   five various cancer cell lines grown as a co-culture with the
   carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in vitro.
   Results: A carcinoma-associated fibroblast cell line was isolated from a
   canine mammary cancer. Then, a co-culture of cancer cells with the CAFs
   was established and maintained for 72 hrs. Having sorted the cells, a
   global gene expression in cancer cells using DNA microarrays was
   examined. The analysis revealed an up-regulation of 100 genes and a
   down-regulation of 106 genes in the cancer cells grown as a co-culture
   with the CAFs in comparison to control conditions. The PANTHER binomial
   statistics tool was applied to determine statistically over-manifested
   pathways (p < 0.05). Bulk of the up-regulated genes are involved in the
   adhesion, the angiogenesis, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
   and generally take part in the developmental processes. These results
   were further confirmed using real-time qPCR. Moreover, a wound-healing
   assay and growth characteristics on Matrigel matrix showed that CAFs
   increase cancer cell migration and matrix invasion.
   Conclusion: The results of the current study showed that the
   co-culturing of cancer cells and the CAFs caused significant changes to
   the cancer gene expression. The presence of the CAFs in a
   microenvironment of cancer cells promotes adhesion, angiogenesis and
   EMT.},

Abstract = {To date, limited information is available on the ability of `Hobi'-like
   pestiviruses (putative bovine viral diarrhoea 3) to infect and cause
   disease in animal species traditionally affected by pestiviruses. In
   order to obtain new insights into host range and pathogenic potential of
   this atypical pestivirus, BVDV-seronegative calves (n = 5), lambs (n =
   5) and piglets (n = 5) were experimentally infected with the European
   `Hobi'-like strain Italy-1/10-1, whereas two animals per species served
   as uninfected controls. Appearance of clinical signs, leukopenia,
   viremia, viral shedding and seroconversion were monitored for 28 days
   post-infection. Calves and lams were successfully infected, displaying
   respiratory signs (nasal discharge), moderate hyperthermia and
   leukopenia, viremia and viral shedding through the nasal and faecal
   routes. Antibody responses were observed in both animal species by ELISA
   and virus neutralisation assays. In contrast, inoculated piglets did not
   display any clinical signs nor leukopenia and viral RNA was not detected
   in any biological samples. Nevertheless, the presence of detectable
   antibodies by virus neutralisation accounted for a successful, albeit
   limited infection of these animals. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {A post-mortem survey was carried out on 46 Sardinian horses to evaluate
   the presence of Strongylus vulgaris and associated pathology. Horses
   were from local farms and had been treated with broad-spectrum
   anthelmintics at least 3 times a year. Examination of the cranial
   mesenteric arterial system (CMAS) showed parasite-induced lesions in all
   horses. S. vulgaris larvae were found in 39\% of examined arteries,
   while their detection rate in coprocultures was 4\%. Histology, carried
   out on 26 horses, showed mainly chronic and chronic-active lesions.
   Histometry showed a significant increase in thickness of the arterial
   wall, in particular of the intima tunic and adventitia tunic of the
   ileocolic artery and its colic branch. MCV, MCHC and alpha2, beta and
   gamma globulins were increased in horses with S. vulgaris larvae in the
   arteries, while the albumin/globulin ratio was decreased. Horses that
   were positive on faecal examination showed decreased values for RBC, PCV
   and the albumin/globulin ratio. Although several studies have shown a
   dramatic decrease of S. vulgar-is infection worldwide, our data show
   that this parasite continues to exert its pathogenic role, even when its
   detection rate is quite low within the strongyle population infecting
   horses. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Despite considerable effort for surveillance of wild birds for avian
   influenza viruses (AIVs), empirical investigations of ecological drivers
   of AIV prevalence in wild birds are still scarce. Here we used a
   continental-scale dataset, collected in tropical wetlands of 15 African
   countries, to test the relative roles of a range of ecological factors
   on patterns of AIV prevalence in wildfowl. Seasonal and geographical
   variations in prevalence were positively related to the local density of
   the wildfowl community and to the wintering period of Eurasian migratory
   birds in Africa. The predominant influence of wildfowl density with no
   influence of climatic conditions suggests, in contrast to temperate
   regions, a predominant role for inter-individual transmission rather
   than transmission via long-lived virus persisting in the environment.
   Higher prevalences were found in Anas species than in non-Anas species
   even when we account for differences in their foraging behaviour
   (primarily dabbling or not) or their geographical origin (Eurasian or
   Afro-tropical), suggesting the existence of intrinsic differences
   between wildfowl taxonomic groups in receptivity to infection. Birds
   were found infected as often in oropharyngeal as in cloacal samples, but
   rarely for both types of sample concurrently, indicating that both
   respiratory and digestive tracts may be important for AIV replication.},

Abstract = {The human-animal bond has been a fundamental feature of mankind's
   history for millennia. The first, and strongest of these, man's
   relationship with the dog, is believed to pre-date even agriculture,
   going back as far as 30,000 years. It remains at least as powerful
   today. Fed by the changing nature of the interactions between people and
   their dogs worldwide and the increasing tendency towards close
   domesticity, the health of dogs has never played a more important role
   in family life. Thanks to developments in scientific understanding and
   diagnostic techniques, as well as changing priorities of pet owners,
   veterinarians are now able, and indeed expected, to play a fundamental
   role in the prevention and treatment of canine disease, including canine
   vector-borne diseases (CVBDs).
   The CVBDs represent a varied and complex group of diseases, including
   anaplasmosis, babesiosis, bartonellosis, borreliosis, dirofilariosis,
   ehrlichiosis, leishmaniosis, rickettsiosis and thelaziosis, with new
   syndromes being uncovered every year. Many of these diseases can cause
   serious, even life-threatening clinical conditions in dogs, with a
   number having zoonotic potential, affecting the human population.
   Today, CVBDs pose a growing global threat as they continue their spread
   far from their traditional geographical and temporal restraints as a
   result of changes in both climatic conditions and pet dog travel
   patterns, exposing new populations to previously unknown infectious
   agents and posing unprecedented challenges to veterinarians. In response
   to this growing threat, the CVBD World Forum, a multidisciplinary group
   of experts in CVBDs from around the world which meets on an annual
   basis, gathered in Nice (France) in 2011 to share the latest research on
   CVBDs and discuss the best approaches to managing these diseases around
   the world.
   As a result of these discussions, we, the members of the CVBD Forum have
   developed the following recommendations to veterinarians for the
   management of CVBDs.},

Abstract = {Evidences of oseltamivir resistant influenza patients raised the need of
   novel neuraminidase inhibitors. In this study, five oseltamivir analogs
   PMC-31-PMC-36, synthesised according to the outcomes of a rational
   design analysis aimed to investigate the effects of substitution at the
   5-amino and 4-amido groups of oseltamivir on its antiviral activity,
   were screened for their inhibition against neuraminidase N1 and N3. The
   enzymes used as models were from the avian influenza A H7N1 and H7N3
   viruses. The neuraminidase inhibition assay was carried out by using
   recombinant species obtained from a baculovirus expression system and
   the fluorogenic substrate MUNANA. The assay was validated by using
   oseltamivir carboxylate as a reference inhibitor. Among the tested
   compounds, PMC-36 showed the highest inhibition on N1 with an IC50 of
   14.6 +/- 3.0 nM (oseltamivir 25 +/- 4 nM), while PMC-35 showed a
   significant inhibitory effect on N3 with an IC50 of 0.1 +/- 0.03 nM
   (oseltamivir 0.2 +/- 0.02 nM). The analysis of the inhibitory properties
   of this panel of compounds allowed a preliminary assessment of a
   structure-activity relationship for the modification of the 4-amido and
   5-amino groups of oseltamivir carboxylate. The substitution of the
   acetamido group in the oseltamivir structure with a 2-butenylamido
   moiety reduced the observed activity, while the introduction of a
   propenylamido group was well tolerated. Substitution of the free 5-amino
   group of oseltamivir carboxylate with an azide, decreased the activity
   against both N1 and N3. When these structural changes were both
   introduced, a dramatic reduction of activity was observed for both N1
   and N3. The alkylation of the free 5-amino group in oseltamivir
   carboxylate introducing an isopropyl group seemed to increase the
   inhibitory effect for both N1 and N3 neuraminidases, displaying a more
   pronounced effect against N1. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {CXCR4 expression in feline mammary carcinoma cells: evidence of a
   proliferative role for the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAR 14},
Abstract = {Background: Mammary tumours frequently develop in female domestic cats
   being highly malignant in a large percentage of cases. Chemokines
   regulate many physiological and pathological processes including
   organogenesis, chemotaxis of inflammatory cells, as well as tumour
   progression and metastasization. In particular, the chemokine/receptor
   pair SDF-1/CXCR4 has been involved in the regulation of metastatic
   potential of neoplastic cells, including breast cancer. The aim of this
   study was the immunohistochemical defininition of the expression profile
   of CXCR4 in primary and metastatic feline mammary carcinomas and the
   evaluation of the role of SDF-1 in feline mammary tumour cell
   proliferation.
   Results: A total of 45 mammary surgical samples, including 33 primary
   tumours (31 carcinomas and 2 adenomas), 6 metastases, and 4 normal
   mammary tissues were anlyzed. Tumor samples were collected from a total
   number of 26 animals, as in some cases concurrent occurrence of neoplasm
   in more than one mammary gland was observed. Tissues were processed for
   standard histological examination, and all lesions were classified
   according to the World Health Organization criteria. CXCR4 expression in
   neoplastic cells was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The level of
   CXCR4 immunoreactivity was semi-quantitatively estimated as CXCR4 score
   evaluating both the number of positive cells and the intensity of
   staining. Six primary, fibroblast-free primary cultures were obtained
   from fresh feline mammary carcinomas and characterized by
   immunofluorescence for CXCR4 and malignant mammary cell marker
   expression. SDF-1-dependent in vitro proliferative effects were also
   assayed. CXCR4 expression was observed in 29 out of 31 malignant tissues
   with a higher CXCR4 score observed in 4 out of 6 metastatic lesions than
   in the respective primary tumours. In 2 benign lesions analyzed, only
   the single basaloid adenoma showed a mild positive immunostaining
   against CXCR4. Normal tissue did not show CXCR4 immunoreactivity. CXCR4
   score was statistically significantly associated with the histological
   features of the samples, showing an increase accordingly with the degree
   of neoplastic transformation (from normal tissue to metastatic lesions).
   Finally, in the primary cultures obtained from 6 primary feline mammary
   carcinomas CXCR4 expression was detected in all cells and its activation
   by SDF-1 in vitro treatment caused a significant increase in the
   proliferation rate in 5 out of 6 tumours.
   Conclusions: These results indicate that malignant feline mammary
   tumours commonly express CXCR4, with a higher level in malignant
   tumours, and, in most of the cases analysed, metastatic cells display
   stronger immunoreactivity for CXCR4 than the corresponding primary
   tumours. Moreover, CXCR4 activation in primary cultures of feline
   mammary carcinomas causes increase in the proliferative rate. Thus,
   SDF-1/CXCR4 system seems to play a tumorigenic in feline mammary gland
   malignancy and in vitro cultures from these tumour samples may represent
   an experimental model to investigate the biological and pharmacological
   role of this chemokinergic axis.},

Title = {Dolphin Morbillivirus and Toxoplasma gondii coinfection in a
   Mediterranean fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus)},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAR 7},
Abstract = {Background: Although Morbillivirus and Toxoplasma gondii have emerged as
   important pathogens for several cetaceans populations over the last 20
   years, they have never been identified together in a Mysticete. In
   particular, morbilliviral infection has been never described in the
   Mediterranean fin whale population.
   Case presentation: On January 2011 an adult male of fin whale (
   Balaenoptera physalus) stranded along the Tyrrhenian coastline of Italy.
   During necropsy, tissue samples from heart, skeletal muscle, mesenteric
   lymph nodes, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney were collected and
   subsequently analyzed for Morbillivirus and Toxoplasma gondii by
   microscopic and molecular methods. Following the detailed necropsy
   carried out on this whale, molecular analysis revealed, for the first
   time, the simultaneous presence of a Dolphin Morbillivirus ( DMV) and T.
   gondii infection coexisting with each other, along with high
   organochlorine pollutant concentrations, with special reference to DDT.
   Conclusion: This report, besides confirming the possibility for
   Mysticetes to be infected with DMV, highlights the risk of toxoplasmosis
   in sea water for mammals, already immunodepressed by concurrent factors
   as infections and environmental contaminants.},

Title = {Meta-Analysis of Two Genome-Wide Association Studies of Bovine
   Paratuberculosis},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 2},
Abstract = {Background: Bovine paratuberculosis (ParaTB) also known as Johne's
   disease, is a contagious fatal disease resulting from infection by
   Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP). Previous studies
   have identified loci associated with ParaTB using different measurements
   to define cases and controls. The objective of this study was to combine
   the data from two recent studies to identify genetic loci associated
   with MAP tissue infection and humoral immune response, defined by MAP
   ELISA-positive cattle, by comparing cases and control animals for one or
   both measures of infection.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: The two populations used for the
   association analyses were a cohort of MAP tissue infected animals and
   control Holstein cows from the USA and the second cohort composed of
   ELISA-positive and ELISA-negative Holstein cows from Italy. Altogether
   1190 cattle were genotyped with the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip. SNP
   markers were removed if the minor allele frequency <0.01 or genotyping
   failure was.5\%. Animals were removed with >5\% genotyping failure.
   Whole genome association analyses were conducted with the GRAMMAR-CG
   method using two different definitions of control populations.
   Conclusion/Significance: The analyses identified several loci (P < 5
   e-05) associated with ParaTB, defined by positive ELISA and presence of
   bacteria in tissue compared to ELISA and tissue negative animals, on
   chromosomes 1, 12 and 15 and one unassigned SNP. These results confirmed
   associations on chromosome 12 and the unassigned SNP with ParaTB which
   had been found in the Italian population alone. Furthermore, several
   additional genomic regions were found associated with ParaTB when ELISA
   and tissue positive animals were compared with tissue negative samples.
   These loci were on chromosomes 1, 6, 7, 13, 16, 21,23 and 25 (P < 5
   e-05). The results clearly indicate the importance of the phenotype
   definition when seeking to identify markers associated with different
   disease responses.},

Abstract = {Astroviruses (AstVs) are nonenveloped RNA small round viruses (SRVs)
   with a genome of 6.8-7.9 kb. Known avian AstVs are spread worldwide;
   they have been associated with poult enteritis and mortality syndrome in
   the United States and reported in Italy in intensive rurkey and guinea
   fowl flocks. Nevertheless, their real prevalence and their pathogenic
   role in avian enteritis affecting Italian flock; is far from clear.
   Negative staining electron microscopy (nsEM) is used for the routine
   diagnosis of avian enteric SRVs, although it cannot distinguish
   morphologically similar particles. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   (ELISA), reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), and genomic sequencing are
   now used for this specific purpose. We analyzed 329 samples of chicken,
   turkey, and guinea fowl intestinal contents from Italian poulny flocks.
   Most samples were from enteritis outbreaks, but we also included samples
   from three longitudinal studies (one on 11 broiler flocks and the other
   two on a guinea fowl flock). We first examined the samples with nsEM.
   SRVs, including AstVs, are often associated with rotaviruses and were
   the most commonly detected morphotypes in avian enteric diseases. We
   then analyzed 124 of the samples with an RT-PCR targeting the open
   reading frame (ORF)-1b of AstV. This gene codes for an RNA-dependent
   polymerase. We then sequenced and genetically analyzed the RT-PCR
   positive samples. Phylogenetic analysis distinguished three defined
   clusters: the first included guinea fowl AstVs and turkey AstVs-2; the
   second, chicken AstVs; and the third was formed by avian nephritis
   viruses (ANVs). No strains clustered with turkey AstVs-1. The results
   indicate that ORF-1b presents certain genetic variability, even among
   AstVs from the same species. In longitudinal studies, samples retrieved
   from the same shed were homogeneous, with some exceptions suggesting
   possible coexistence of different genetic types in the same unit. The
   finding of ANV-like viruses in commercial guinea fowls underlines the
   genetic variability of AstVs and strengthens the hypothesis of a varied
   intraherd situation.},

Title = {Diagnostic accuracy of brush cytology in canine chronic intranasal
   disease},
Journal = {VETERINARY CLINICAL PATHOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {41},

Abstract = {Background: Most cases of canine chronic intranasal disease cannot be
   differentiated based on clinical examination alone, and biopsy is often
   required for a definitive diagnosis. Nonsurgical cytologic and
   histologic biopsy techniques represent desirable diagnostic approaches.
   Objective: The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the
   diagnostic accuracy of brush cytology in differentiating non-neoplastic
   and neoplastic diseases in dogs with chronic intranasal disease.
   Methods: Cytologic samples of lesions in dogs with chronic intranasal
   disease were obtained by brushing over a 12-year period. All dogs had
   complete physical examinations as well as radiographic, rhinoscopic, and
   cytologic evaluation. Histologic diagnosis, follow-up clinical
   information, or both were used as the gold standard, and dogs free of
   disease or with no progression of disease at 1 year were considered
   negative for neoplasia. Indicators of performance of brush cytology in
   detecting neoplasia were calculated and included sensitivity,
   specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and diagnostic
   odds ratio.
   Results: Samples of nasal brushings from 138 dogs were evaluated. Of 62
   cases of neoplastic disease, true-positive and false-negative diagnoses
   were made using cytologic evaluation in 44 (71.0\%) and 18 (29.0\%)
   cases, respectively. False-negative diagnoses of neoplasia were not
   attributed to low cellularity, but to the presence of inflammatory cells
   that masked neoplastic cells. Brush cytology had a sensitivity of 0.71,
   specificity of 0.99, positive likelihood ratio of 53.94, negative
   likelihood ratio of 0.29, and diagnostic odds ratio of 188.33.
   Conclusions: Brush cytology has good diagnostic accuracy for chronic
   intranasal lesions in dogs.},

Title = {Development of a multilevel approach for the evaluation of

Journal = {NANOMEDICINE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {Aim: To develop a multilevel approach that includes different toxicity
   tests and gene-expression studies for toxicity evaluation of engineered
   nanomaterials developed for biomedical applications. Materials \&
   methods: K-562, MCF-7 and U-937 human-derived cell lines were used as
   models for in vitro toxicity tests. These tests included viability
   assays
   (3-{[}4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-5-{[}3-carboxymethoxyphenyl]-2-{[}4-sulf
   ophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium {[}MTS] assay); evaluation of apoptosis/necrosis
   by propidium iodide staining and DNA laddering assay; evaluation of
   mitochondrial toxicity
   (5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethyl-benzimidazolcarbocyanine
   iodide {[}JC-1] assay); transmission electron microscopy analysis and
   gene expression analysis by DNA microarray. For in vivo toxicity
   evaluation, Swiss mice were used for monitoring acute or chronic
   effects. Two superparamagnetic contrast agents approved for human use
   (Resovist (R) and Primovist (R)) and two new lanthanide-based
   luminescent nanoparticles were tested. Results \& discussion: The
   nanomaterials approved for human use did not show significant toxicities
   in our assays. Toxicity studies performed on lanthanide-based
   nanoparticles (EDTA120 and EDTA120D) complexed with the chelating agent
   EDTA revealed that these nanomaterials induced necrosis in U-937 and
   K-562 cells while no toxicity was observed in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, no
   in vivo effects have been observed. The comparative analysis of the
   nanomaterials and their separated components showed that the toxicity in
   U-937 and K-562 cells was mainly due to the presence of EDTA.
   Conclusion: The multilevel approach proved to be useful for nanomaterial
   toxicity characterization. In particular, for the lanthanide-based
   nanoparticles tested in this work, the EDTA was identified as the main
   cause of the toxicity in vitro, suggesting a possible applicability of
   these nanoparticle suspensions for in vivo optical imaging.},

Abstract = {This report describes a pandemic A/H1N1 (H1N1 pdm) virus outbreak
   occurred in December, 2009 in a swine farm used as research facility
   (Istituto Mediterraneo Trapianti e Terapie ad Alta Specializzazione) for
   preclinical studies, located in Sicily, Italy. All the 13 pigs of the
   farm, showed cough, fever, inappetence and weakness. At the same time,
   an unvaccinated worker of the stabling showed influenza-like symptoms.
   RNAv extracted from two swabs collected from infected pigs resulted
   positive by Real Time RT-PCR for Influenza A virus. Furthermore, after
   growth on embryonated eggs, viral isolates were identified by Real Time
   RT-PCR specific for H1N1 pdm virus and characterized antigenically.
   Sequencing of the whole genome was also performed. All sera taken from
   animals and from the worker were tested by a competitive Influenza A
   ELISA and by the haemoagglutination inhibition test. Serological
   findings confirmed the circulation of influenza virus H1N1 pdm in pigs
   and the presence of specific antibodies against H1N1 pdm in human serum.
   The results of this study seem to support a H1N1 pdm transmission from
   man to animals showing the importance of serological and virological
   investigation to control the pig farms and the importance of close
   cooperation between the different authorities like veterinarian and

Abstract = {Salmonella is one of the most common pathogens in the European Union
   which can spread in the domestic environment due to incorrect food
   handling practices. This study has investigated the efficacy of the
   Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to uncover the processes that lead to
   the formation of the intentions and thus to a specific behavior, i.e.
   consuming meat and fresh sausages only if well cooked. Two parallel
   longitudinal studies comprising Italian young adults and adults were
   carried out. In a two week period, participants were administered two
   questionnaires measuring behavioral intentions and their antecedents in
   the first wave, and self-reported behavior toward the target behavior in
   the second one.
   Results showed the superior predictive power of the TPB plus past
   behavior. From a cognitive perspective, the samples differed: the actual
   behavior of young adults derives from intentions and perceived control,
   whereas the behavior of adults depends only on past behavior. Findings
   suggest that food risk-communication should consider the differences in
   behavior models. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {West Nile Disease (WND) has been considered in Italy a re-emerging
   zoonosis, due to West Nile Virus (WNV) appearance on national territory
   in summer of 2008, 10 years after the last epidemic outbreak in Tuscany.
   WNV cycle involves birds and mosquitoes, however several mammals, as
   humans and horses, can be infected showing influenza-like symptoms and
   sometimes severe meningoencephalitis. Main objective of veterinary
   surveillance is the early detection of WNV circulation, in order to
   manage specific preventive measures. One of the most effective tools for
   this purpose is the passive surveillance on horses (OM 5/11/2008). Data
   about WND confirmed cases in horses in Emilia-Romagna region between
   2008 and 2010 were examined. Clinical features resulted variable and
   unspecific. More information and awareness of veterinary practitioners
   working in the equine field will make this surveillance system more
   effective for early detection of new cases in the region. The aim of
   this article is to make available to practitioners some diagnostic
   tools, useful to identify neurological syndrome and to report suspected
   cases of WND in horse.},

Abstract = {The use of non invasive sampling, such as collection of conjunctival
   swabs, as a diagnostic tool for the detection of Leishmania DNA is of
   interest. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic
   utility of detecting Leishmania infection with the use of conjunctival
   swab samples in dogs living in a highly endemic area for leishmaniosis
   and to investigate, for the first time, the presence of Leishmania DNA
   in oral swabs in the same population. One hundred sixty-three dogs
   living outdoor and recruited in various provinces of Sicily were
   studied. Leishmania infantum indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT),
   delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to leishmanin (DTH) and real-time
   PCR of blood (BL), lymph node (LN), conjunctival (CS) and oral swab (OS)
   samples were performed. The positive PCR percentages in LN, CS, OS and
   BL samples were: 24.5\%, 22.1\%, 8.7\% and 5.5\%, respectively.
   Serological and DTH positive percentages were 27.0\% and 73.8\%,
   respectively. Seropositive and LN-PCR positive dogs had a high
   likelihood to be positive by CS-PCR. The similar positive PCR
   percentages found in CS and LN samples suggest the use of CS-PCR as
   non-invasive alternative technique to LN-PCR for the detection of
   Leishmania infection in dogs. In addition, this study demonstrated, for
   the first time, the presence of Leishmania DNA in oral swabs in dogs.

Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Volume = {7},

Month = {FEB 27},
Abstract = {We investigated the impact of CHIKV strains on some Aedes albopictus
   (Skuse) reproductive parameters and the possibility of vertical
   transmission. Two strains were collected in the area where the epidemic
   occurred in 2007, one isolated from mosquitoes, the other one isolated
   from a viraemic patient. Different types of blood meals, either infected
   or non-infected, were offered to Ae. albopictus females, that were then
   analyzed at increasing time post infection. The virus titre, measured by
   two RT-PCR methods in the blood meals, influenced the rate of infection
   and the rate of dissemination of CHIKV in Ae. albopictus body. We found
   individual variability with respect to the infection/dissemination rates
   and their latency both considering the female's body and appendages. The
   hatching rate was significantly lower for the eggs laid by the infected
   females than for the control eggs, while the mortality during the larval
   development (from first instar larva to adult emergence) was similar
   among the progeny of infected and non-infected female groups. Our
   findings seem to support the hypothesis that the vertical transmission
   is a rare event under our conditions, and that a certain time period is
   required in order to get the ovarioles infected. Field observations
   conducted during the Spring 2008 showed no evidence of the presence of
   infected overwintering progeny produced by Ae. albopictus females
   infected during the 2007 outbreak.},

Abstract = {We describe trends in the occurrence of acute infectious gastroenteritis
   (1992 to 2009) and food-borne disease outbreaks (1996 to 2009) in Italy.
   In 2002, the Piedmont region implemented a surveillance system for early
   detection and control of food-borne disease outbreaks; in 2004, the
   Lombardy region implemented a system for surveillance of all notifiable
   human infectious diseases. Both systems are internet based. We compared
   the regional figures with the national mean using official notification
   data provided by the National Infectious Diseases Notification System
   (SIMI) and the National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT), in order to
   provide additional information about the epidemiology of these diseases
   in Italy. When compared with the national mean, data from the two
   regional systems showed a significant increase in notification rates of
   non-typhoid salmonellosis and infectious diarrhoea other than
   non-typhoid salmonellosis, but for food-borne disease outbreaks, the
   increase was not statistically significant. Although the two regional
   systems have different objectives and structures, they showed improved
   sensitivity regarding notification of cases of acute infectious
   gastroenteritis and, to a lesser extent, food-borne disease outbreaks,
   and thus provide a more complete picture of the epidemiology of these
   diseases in Italy.},

Title = {Acaricide Residues in Laying Hens Naturally Infested by Red Mite
   Dermanyssus gallinae},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 21},
Abstract = {In the poultry industry, control of the red mite D. gallinae primarily
   relies worldwide on acaricides registered for use in agriculture or for
   livestock, and those most widely used are carbamates, followed by
   amidines, pyrethroids and organophosphates. Due to the repeated use of
   acaricides sometimes in high concentrations to control infestation, red
   mites may become resistant, and acaricides may accumulate in chicken
   organs and tissues, and also in eggs. To highlight some situations of
   misuse/abuse of chemicals and of risk to human health, we investigated
   laying hens, destined to the slaughterhouse, for the presence of
   acaricide residues in their organs and tissues. We used 45 hens from
   which we collected a total of 225 samples from the following tissues and
   organs: skin, fat, liver, muscle, hearth, and kidney. In these samples
   we analyzed the residual contents of carbaryl and permethrin by
   LC-MS/MS.
   Ninety-one (40.4\%) samples were positive to carbaryl and four samples
   (1.7\%) were positive to permethrin. Concentrations of carbaryl
   exceeding the detection limit (0.005 ppm) were registered in the skin
   and fat of birds from two farms (p<0.01), although these concentrations
   remained below the maximum residue limit (MRLs) (0.05 ppm) (p<0.01). All
   organs/tissues of hens from a third farm were significantly more
   contaminated, with skin and muscle samples exceeding the MRL (0.05 ppm)
   (p<0.01) of carbaryl in force before its use was banned. Out of 45
   chickens tested, 37 (82.2\%) were found to be contaminated by carbaryl,
   and 4 (8.8\%) by permethrin. The present study is the first report on
   the presence of pesticides banned by the EU (carbaryl) or not licensed
   for use (permethrin) in the organs and tissues of laying hens, which
   have been treated against red mites, and then slaughtered for human
   consumption at the end of their life cycle.},

Title = {Infectivity in Skeletal Muscle of Cattle with Atypical Bovine Spongiform
   Encephalopathy},

Abstract = {The amyloidotic form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) termed
   BASE is caused by a prion strain whose biological properties differ from
   those of typical BSE, resulting in a clinically and pathologically
   distinct phenotype. Whether peripheral tissues of BASE-affected cattle
   contain infectivity is unknown. This is a critical issue since the BASE
   prion is readily transmissible to a variety of hosts including primates,
   suggesting that humans may be susceptible. We carried out bioassays in
   transgenic mice overexpressing bovine PrP (Tgbov XV) and found
   infectivity in a variety of skeletal muscles from cattle with natural
   and experimental BASE. Noteworthy, all BASE muscles used for inoculation
   transmitted disease, although the attack rate differed between
   experimental and natural cases (similar to 70\% versus similar to 10\%,
   respectively). This difference was likely related to different prion
   titers, possibly due to different stages of disease in the two
   conditions, i.e. terminal stage in experimental BASE and pre-symptomatic
   stage in natural BASE. The neuropathological phenotype and PrP res type
   were consistent in all affected mice and matched those of Tgbov XV mice
   infected with brain homogenate from natural BASE. The
   immunohistochemical analysis of skeletal muscles from cattle with
   natural and experimental BASE showed the presence of abnormal prion
   protein deposits within muscle fibers. Conversely, Tgbov XV mice
   challenged with lymphoid tissue and kidney from natural and experimental
   BASE did not develop disease. The novel information on the neuromuscular
   tropism of the BASE strain, efficiently overcoming species barriers,
   underlines the relevance of maintaining an active surveillance.},

Title = {Resistance to classical scrapie in experimentally challenged goats
   carrying mutation K222 of the prion protein gene},
Journal = {VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {43},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Susceptibility of sheep to scrapie, a transmissible spongiform
   encephalopathy of small ruminants, is strongly influenced by
   polymorphisms of the prion protein gene (PRNP). Breeding programs have
   been implemented to increase scrapie resistance in sheep populations;
   though desirable, a similar approach has not yet been applied in goats.
   European studies have now suggested that several polymorphisms can
   modulate scrapie susceptibility in goats: in particular, PRNP variant
   K222 has been associated with resistance in case-control studies in
   Italy, France and Greece. In this study we investigated the resistance
   conferred by this variant using a natural Italian goat scrapie isolate
   to intracerebrally challenge five goats carrying genotype Q/Q 222 (wild
   type) and five goats carrying genotype Q/K 222. By the end of the study,
   all five Q/Q 222 goats had died of scrapie after a mean incubation
   period of 19 months; one of the five Q/K 222 goats died after 24 months,
   while the other four were alive and apparently healthy up to the end of
   the study at 4.5 years post-challenge. All five of these animals were
   found to be scrapie negative. Statistical analysis showed that the
   probability of survival of the Q/K 222 goats versus the Q/Q 222 goats
   was significantly higher (p = 0.002). Our study shows that PRNP gene
   mutation K222 is strongly associated with resistance to classical
   scrapie also in experimental conditions, making it a potentially
   positive target for selection in the frame of breeding programs for
   resistance to classical scrapie in goats.},

Abstract = {Objective-To develop a diagnostic diagram for rapid field assessment of
   acidosis severity in diarrheic calves.
   Design-Prospective cross-sectional study.
   Animals-148 Piedmontese calves (38 calves in preliminary experiments; 83
   diarrheic calves and 27 healthy control calves in the primary
   experiment).
   Procedures-Physical examination was performed and a standard data
   collection form was completed for each calf. Blood samples were obtained
   and submitted for evaluation of acid-base balance, performance of a CBC,
   and measurement of electrolyte and total protein concentrations.
   Results-Severe metabolic acidosis (extracellular base excess more
   negative than -10 mmol/L) was associated with abnormal mental status,
   delayed or absent suckle reflex, abnormal posture or gait, enophthalmos,
   and cold oral mucosa! membranes. Clinical signs associated with severe
   metabolic acidosis were arranged into a grid to create a diagnostic
   diagram. Sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic diagram for the
   prediction of severe metabolic acidosis were 88\% and 79\%,
   respectively.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Use of the diagnostic diagram may aid
   differentiation between severe and nonsevere acidosis patterns as
   determined on the basis of clinical signs. (J Am Vet Med Assoc

Volume = {23},

Pages = {400-404},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Five species-specific Real-Time PCR protocols were developed,
   standardised and validated for the identification of turkey, chicken,
   beef, pork and sheep meat in complex food products. Specific primers and
   probes were designed for each assay. 16S rRNA and cyt-b target genes
   located in the mitochondrial DNA were used for this purpose. The limit
   of detection of the Real-Time PCR methods ranged between 0.02 pg and
   0.80 pg of template DNA, with an efficiency between 95\% and 100\%. All
   methods were able to detect the target species when spiked at 1\% in any
   other species and no relevant difference was observed between the Ct
   values of raw and cooked samples. An Internal Amplification Control was
   used to detect possible false negatives due to inhibitory substances
   eventually present in the sample matrix. The assays were tested on meat
   mixtures to evaluate the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. (C)

Title = {Conditioned medium from amniotic mesenchymal tissue cells reduces

Journal = {CYTOTHERAPY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Background and aims. We have demonstrated recently that transplantation
   of placental membrane-derived cells reduces bleomycin-induced lung
   fibrosis in mice, despite a limited presence of transplanted cells in
   host lungs. Because placenta-derived cells are known to release factors
   with potential immunomodulatory and trophic activities, we hypothesized
   that transplanted cells may promote lung tissue repair via
   paracrine-acting molecules. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether
   administration of conditioned medium (CM) generated from human amniotic
   mesenchymal tissue cells (AMTC) was able to reduce lung fibrosis in this
   same animal model. Methods. Bleomycin-challenged mice were either
   treated with AMTC-CM or control medium, or were left untreated (Bleo
   group). After 9 and 14 days, the distribution and severity of lung
   fibrosis were assessed histologically with a scoring system. Collagen
   deposition was also evaluated by quantitative image analysis. Results.
   At day 14, lung fibrosis scores in AMTC-CM-treated mice were
   significantly lower (P < 0.05) compared with mice of the Bleo group, in
   terms of fibrosis distribution {[}1.0 (interquartile range, IQR 0.9)
   versus 3.0 (IQR 1.8)], fibroblast proliferation {[}0.8 (IQR 0.4) versus
   1.6 (IQR 1.0)], collagen deposition {[}1.4 (IQR 0.5) versus 2.0 (IQR
   1.2)] and alveolar obliteration {[}2.3 (IQR 0.8) versus 3.2 (IQR 0.5)].
   No differences were observed between mice of the Bleo group and mice
   treated with control medium. Quantitative analysis of collagen
   deposition confirmed these findings. Importantly, AMTC-CM treatment
   significantly reduced the fibrosis progression between the two
   observation time-points. Conclusions. This pilot study supports the
   notion that AMTC exert anti-fibrotic effects through release of yet
   unknown soluble factors.},

Abstract = {In this study we compared two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods
   using either 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) or 23S rRNA gene primers for the
   detection of different Leptospira interrogans serovars. The performance
   of these two methods was assessed using DNA extracted from bovine
   tissues previously inoculated with several bacterial suspensions. PCR
   was performed on the same tissues before and after the formalin-fixed,
   paraffin-embedding procedure (FFPE tissues). The 23S rDNA PCR detected
   all fresh and FFPE positive tissues while the 16S rDNA-based protocol
   detected primarily the positive fresh tissues. Both methods are specific
   for pathogenic L. interrogans. The 23S-based PCR method successfully
   detected Leptospira in four dubious cases of human leptospirosis from
   archival tissue specimens and one leptospirosis-positive canine
   specimen. A sensitive method for leptospirosis identification in FFPE
   tissues would be a useful tool to screen histological specimen archives
   and gain a better assessment of human leptospirosis prevalence,
   especially in tropical countries, where large outbreaks can occur
   following the rainy season.},

Abstract = {An atypical pestivirus ('Hobi'-like pestivirus, putative bovine viral
   diarrhoea 3, BVDV-3) was identified firstly in contaminated foetal calf
   serum batches and isolated subsequently from an outbreak of respiratory
   disease in a cattle herd in Italy. The isolation of the novel pestivirus
   from animals affected clinically posed concerns about the validity of
   BVDV eradication programs, considering that `Hobi'-like pestivirus
   (BVDV-3) is undetected or mistyped by the molecular diagnostic tools
   currently employed. In this paper, the development of a nested PCR
   (nPCR) assay for unambiguous typing of all bovine pestiviruses is
   reported. The assay consisted of a first-round amplification using an
   oligonucleotide pair which binds to conserved sequences located in the
   5' untranslated region and capsid gene, followed by a heminested PCR
   using virus-specific forward primers. The assay performances were
   evaluated analytically, showing good sensitivity and specificity. By
   analysis of 100 BVDV-positive samples typed using a nPCR assay
   discriminating ruminant pestiviruses, five samples recognised previously
   as BVDV-2 were not typed when submitted to the new assay (n = 2) or
   reacted as `Hobi'-like pestivirus BVDV-3 (n = 3). Sequence analysis of
   the first-round amplification products showed that the untyped strains
   were border disease viruses, whereas the other three strains were true
   `Hobi'-like viruses. The development of a molecular assay able to
   identify simultaneously all bovine pestiviruses known currently will
   help warrant biosafety of live vaccines and other biological products
   and assess the molecular epidemiology of `Hobi'-like pestivirus, thus
   leading to the improvement of the eradication programs through
   unambiguous typing of pestiviruses infecting cattle. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {Babesioses are hematic tick-borne diseases that induce malaria-like
   disorders in domestic, wild animals, and humans. Although indirect
   fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   (ELISA) commercial kits are available to test the presence of antibodies
   against most Babesia species, no kit exists to serologically diagnose
   the infections due to Babesia divergens, one of the most important
   zoonotic species. To fill this gap and to develop assays to detect
   animal and human infections, in vitro cultures (microaerophilous
   stationary phase system) of B. divergens were organized. Infected
   erythrocytes were adsorbed as corpuscular antigen (CA) on IFAT slides
   and ELISA microwells. The supernatant medium of the cultures (metabolic
   antigen, MA) was collected and employed in ELISA and western blot (WB)
   assays. B. divergens was also used to produce positive sera in Meriones
   unguiculatus and to infect a calf. Serological tests were set up with
   sera from experimentally/naturally infected animals, and possible
   cross-reactions were evaluated using heterologous sera from cattle
   positive to other piroplasms. Sera from clinically healthy people at
   risk of infection were also tested. As expected, assays based on the
   purified MAs from in vitro cultures proved more sensitive and specific
   than CA-IFAT and CA-ELISA. In fact, MA-ELISA provided satisfactory
   performances (even if 8.4\%-15.7\% cross-reactions were evidenced), and
   the WB developed proved totally sensitive and specific. WB indicated as
   immunodominant antigens two major protein bands at 33 and 37 kDa, which
   were also evidenced in 2.2\% of the human sera tested, proving the
   parasite transmission to humans also in Italy.},

Abstract = {Aims: To predict the risk of incursion of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic
   fever virus (CCHFV) in livestock in Europe introduced through immature
   Hyalomma marginatum ticks on migratory birds under current conditions
   and in the decade 20752084 under a climate-change scenario. Methods and
   Results: A spatial risk map of Europe comprising 14 282 grid cells (25 x
   25 km) was constructed using three data sources: (i) ranges and
   abundances of four species of bird which migrate from sub-Saharan Africa
   to Europe each spring, namely Willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus),
   Northern wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe), Tree pipit (Anthus trivialis) and
   Common quail (Coturnix coturnix); (ii) UK Met Office HadRM3 spring
   temperatures for prediction of moulting success of immature H.
   marginatum ticks and (iii) livestock densities. On average, the number
   of grid cells in Europe predicted to have at least one CCHFV incursion
   in livestock in spring was 1 04 per year for the decade 2005-2014 and 1
   03 per year for the decade 2075-2084. In general with the assumed
   climate-change scenario, the risk increased in northern Europe but
   decreased in central and southern Europe, although there is considerable
   local variation in the trends. Conclusions: The absolute risk of
   incursion of CCHFV in livestock through ticks introduced by four
   abundant species of migratory bird (totalling 120 million individual
   birds) is very low. Climate change has opposing effects, increasing the
   success of the moult of the nymphal ticks into adults but decreasing the
   projected abundance of birds by 34\% in this model. Significance and
   Impact of the Study: For Europe, climate change is not predicted to
   increase the overall risk of incursion of CCHFV in livestock through
   infected ticks introduced by these four migratory bird species.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted to elucidate the accuracy of the current
   streptomycin epidemiological cut-off value (ECOFF) for Escherichia coli
   and Salmonella spp. A total of 236 Salmonella enterica and 208 E. coli
   isolates exhibiting MICs between 4 and 32 mg/L were selected from 12
   countries. Isolates were investigated by polymerase chain reaction for
   aadA, strA, and strB streptomycin resistance genes. Out of 236
   Salmonella isolates, 32 (13.5\%) yielded amplicons for aadA (n=23), strA
   (n=9), and strB (n=11). None of the 60 Salmonella isolates exhibiting
   MIC 4 mg/L harbored resistance genes. Of the Salmonella isolates
   exhibiting MICs 8 mg/L, 16 mg/L, and 32 mg/L, 1.6\%, 15\%, and 39\%,
   respectively, tested positive for one or more genes. For most monitoring
   programs, the streptomycin ECOFF for Salmonella is wild type (WT) <= 32
   or <= 16 mg/L. A cut-off value of WT <= 32 mg/L would have misclassified
   13.5\% of the strains as belonging to the WT population, since this
   proportion of strains harbored resistance genes and exhibited MICs <= 32
   mg/L. Out of 208 E. coli strains, 80 (38.5\%) tested positive for aadA
   (n=69), strA (n=18), and strB (n=31). Of the E. coli isolates exhibiting
   MICs of 4 mg/L, 8 mg/L, 16 mg/L, and 32 mg/L, 3.6\%, 17.6\%, 53\%, and
   82.3\%, respectively, harbored any of the three genes. Based on the
   European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing guidelines
   (ECOFF <= 16 mg/L), 25\% of the E. coli strains presenting MIC <= 16
   mg/L would have been incorrectly categorized as belonging to the WT
   population. The authors recommend an ECOFF value of WT <= 16 mg/L for
   Salmonella and WT <= 8 mg/L for E. coli.},

Abstract = {Autologous AD-MSC {[}adipose-derived MSC (mesenchymal stem cell)]
   therapy involves harvesting fat from the patient by isolating the stem
   and regenerative cells and administering the cells back to the patient.
   This study evaluated the production of canine AD-MSCs and their possible
   application in cellular therapy for dogs. To assess whether cellular
   therapy can replace drug therapy, the clinical effect of a single
   intra-articular injection of AD-MSCs was evaluated on 4 dogs with
   lameness associated with OA (osteoarthritis) of the humeroradial joints.
   MSCs were readily isolated from adult dog adipose tissue, and their
   ability to form colony and differentiate into various phenotypes was
   confirmed. AD-MSCs expressed OCT4, NANOG and SOX2 at the mRNA level,
   pluripotency markers usually ascribed to embryonic stem cells. The
   results suggest the sternness of the cells isolated from canine fat, and
   good quality control made them available for both experimental and
   clinical use. Follow-up studies to evaluate the effects of AD-MSC
   therapy showed that OA of the elbow joints improved with time,
   indicating significant potential for clinical use in the treatment of
   lameness, particularly when administered before the injury becomes

Title = {Investigation on the presence of sulphites in fresh meat preparations:
   Estimation of an allowable maximum limit},

Volume = {90},

Abstract = {Sulphiting agents are commonly used food additives. They are not allowed
   in fresh meat preparations. In this work, 2250 fresh meat samples were
   analysed to establish the maximum concentration of sulphites that can be
   considered as ``natural{''} and therefore be admitted in fresh meat
   preparations. The analyses were carried out by an optimised
   Monier-Williams Method and the positive samples confirmed by ion
   chromatography. Sulphite concentrations higher than the screening method
   LOQ (10.0 mg . kg(-1)) were found in 100 samples. Concentrations higher
   than 76.6 mg . kg(-1), attributable to sulphiting agent addition, were
   registered in 40 samples. Concentrations lower than 41.3 mg . kg(-1)
   were registered in 60 samples. Taking into account the distribution of
   sulphite concentrations obtained, it is plausible to estimate a maximum
   allowable limit of 40.0 mg . kg(-1) (expressed as SO2). Below this value
   the samples can be considered as ``compliant{''}. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Background: Bovine tuberculosis is a disease of zoonotic importance. It
   is disease of high priority all over the world and needs to be
   investigated in each country.
   Objective: This study was conducted to find out the prevalence of
   tuberculosis in buffaloes and associated risk factors.
   Methods: The study was carried out at seven livestock experimental
   stations in Punjab, Pakistan. Buffaloes were studied by comparative
   cervical intradermal tuberculin test.
   Result: The results of the study revealed an overall tuberculosis
   prevalence of 11.3\% with 86\% of farms having tuberculin positive
   animals. The frequency analysis revealed significant difference between
   different groups for age, calving, lactation length, average daily milk
   and live weight of the buffaloes. Data analysis by T-test also revealed
   significant difference between means for age, live weight, calving,
   lactation length and average daily milk between tuberculin positive and
   negative buffaloes. Bivariate and multivariate logistic analysis
   revealed significant association of age, live weight, calving, average
   daily milk and lactation length. Multivariate logistic regression
   analysis including all the variables in the model revealed significant
   association of tuberculosis with age, live weight, total milk produced,
   presence of cattle at the farm, lactation length, and total other
   animals at the farm.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of tuberculosis in buffaloes increases with
   the increase in age, calving, live weight, milk production and presence
   of cattle at the farm, while the prevalence decreases with the increase
   in lactation length.},

Abstract = {Context: Development of inexpensive and safe enzymatic assays to screen
   for putative neuraminidase inhibitors.
   Objective: Validate the use of recombinant neuraminidase expressed in
   baculovirus located on the viral surface capsule to develop a
   neuraminidase inhibitor screening assay.
   Materials and methods: Recombinant baculovirus particles displaying
   neuraminidase N1 and N3 were used as enzyme sources. The assay set-up
   required the use of 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-D-acetyl neuraminic
   acid as substrate and oseltamivir carboxylate as benchmark inhibitor.
   Results: The assay was set up in a standard 96-well plate. The within-
   and between-assay coefficients of variation were, on average, less than
   10\%. The 50\% inhibitory concentration values of the inhibitor were in
   good agreement with those determined by independent kinetic experiments.
   Discussion and conclusions: The assay showed satisfactory within- and
   between-assay repeatability. The obtained results suggest that
   recombinant baculovirus expressing neuraminidase located on the virus
   membrane capsule can be used to set up affordable and reliable
   neuraminidase inhibitors screening assays.},

Abstract = {A selective and sensitive method for screening 31 analytes (nine
   corticosteroids, eight beta-agonists, seven anabolic steroids, six
   promazines and zeranol) in bovine urine was validated according to
   2002/657/EC guidelines. Upon optimization of sample treatment
   conditions, the extraction was performed by diethylether at pH 9, after
   deconjugation. Extraction yields (R\%) proved higher than 70\% for 19
   analytes, 50<R\%<70 for 5 analytes, lower than 50\% but reproducible for
   the remaining six analytes. The analyses were carried out using
   HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. The method sensitivity proved high enough to largely
   exceed the CC beta requirements of the Italian residue detection plan,
   ranging from 1 to 3 ng/mL (20 ng/mL for promazines). The present method
   allowed the simultaneous analysis of most drugs for which the European
   legislation prescribes official controls. Its practical applicability
   was verified on 494 real samples as an alternative to the traditional
   screening protocols based on multiple immunometric analysis,
   demonstrating high efficiency and comprehensive investigation capacity,
   allowing epidemiological assessment of the current trends in cattle
   breeding drug abuse. Among non-compliant results, nine borderline cases
   of growth-promoters illegal treatments, making use of long-term
   low-dosage administrations and typically yielding urine residues below
   the cut-off value for immunochemical methods, were detected by using the
   present LC-MS/MS method.},

Volume = {92},

Abstract = {Recently, atypical bovine pestiviruses (BVDV-3) have been identified in
   batches of contaminated foetal calf serum (FCS) and in naturally
   infected cattle. During routine screening of FCS by conventional
   panpestivirus PCR assay, one batch showed traces of pestivirus nucleic
   acids, and the contaminating virus was typed as BVDV-3-like.
   Phylogenetic analysis based on three genome regions (5'UTR, N-pro and
   E2) showed that this strain, named IZSPLV\_To, clusters in a separate
   clade with CH\_KaHo/cont, a cell culture contaminant detected in
   Switzerland. This study is the first report of the detection in Italy of
   a FCS batch contaminated with BVDV-3 and adds more evidence that
   atypical pestiviruses represent a serious cause for concern in cell
   culture laboratories, with potential repercussions on BVD control and
   vaccine biosafety. Our findings suggest that the BE/B2 primers may be
   able to detect BVDV-3 in a panpestivirus assay, but testing of a larger
   number of strains is required. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {ER signaling regulation drives the switch between autophagy and

Year = {2012},
Volume = {318},
Number = {3},
Pages = {238-250},

Abstract = {Cisplatin (cisPt) use in chemotherapy is limited by the occurrence of a
   severe nephrotoxicity. Both autophagy and apoptosis seem to contribute
   in kidney response to cisPt, however their cross-talk is still
   controversial, since the role played by autophagy (cytoprotective or
   harmful) and the cellular site driving their switch, are still unclear.
   Here, we used a multidisciplinary approach to study the correlation
   between autophagy and apoptosis in renal NRK-52E cells exposed to cisPt.
   We showed two ``sensitivity-thresholds{''} to cisPt, stating whether
   apoptosis or autophagy would develop: 10 mu M dose of cisPt activated
   autophagy that preserved cell homeostasis; however 3-methyladenine
   co-administration affected cell viability and induced apoptosis. In
   contrast, 50 mu M cisPt determined cell death by apoptosis, whereas the
   pre-conditioning with taurine contributed to cell rescue, delaying
   apoptosis and maintaining autophagy. Hence, autophagy protects NRK-52E
   cells from cisPt injury. By studying the expression of ER specific
   hallmarks, such as GRP78, GRP94 and GADD153/CHOP, we found a possible
   pivotal role of ER signaling modulation in the crosstalk between
   autophagy and apoptosis induced by cisPt. To the best of our knowledge,
   this is the first demonstration that taurine enhances autophagic
   protection against apoptosis by reducing ER stress, thus making it
   possible to develop new strategies to reduce severe cisPt-induced
   side-effects such as nephrotoxicity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Salmonellosis is one of the most common foodborne human diseases. The
   risk of infection can be reduced by communication campaigns. The aim of
   this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of a food safety message that
   underlines that eating well-cooked meat is an effective strategy for
   preventing salmonellosis. The target audience was young adults
   (university students). They were presented with one of two messages, a
   prevention message or a control message. The prevention message proved
   to be very effective. First, it changed the attitude toward raw or rare
   meat, which after having read the prevention message was evaluated less
   positively and more negatively. Second, intentions to eat raw or rare
   meat were weaker in those who read the prevention message compared with
   those who read the control message. Third, after the message,
   participants in the experimental condition, but not in the control
   condition, associated the self-image more with well-done meat than with
   raw or rare meat.},

Title = {Factors affecting long-term outcomes after thromboembolectomy for acute
   lower limb ischemia},
Journal = {MINERVA CHIRURGICA},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {67},
Number = {1},
Pages = {49-57},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Aim. The aim of this study was to analyze factors influencing outcomes
   of surgical management for lower limb acute ischemia.
   Methods. A retrospective analysis of 490 thromboembolectomies performed
   in 468 patients was conducted. Perioperative and follow-up results were
   analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analysis of clinical variables and
   patients' characteristics for the risk of reocclusion, amputation and
   mortality at 2 years were performed. Statistical significance was
   defined as a P value <0.05.
   Results. Cumulative reocclusion, amputation and mortality rates at 24
   months were 22.6\%, 14.3\% and 42.8\%, respectively. At univariate
   analysis, the factors associated with increased 2-year reocclusion rate
   were severity of clinical presentation, current smoking habit, arterial
   thrombosis rather than embolism, atrial fibrillation and the avoidance
   of completion angiography. All these factors except clinical
   presentation maintained significance at multivariate analysis. Factors
   associated with increased 2-year amputation rate at univariate analysis
   included severity of clinical presentation, smoke, arterial thrombosis,
   atrial fibrillation and valvulopathy. All these factors except clinical
   presentation and valvular defects maintained significance at
   multivariate analysis. Factors associated with increased 2-year
   mortality rate at univariate analysis included age >80 years, arterial
   thrombosis, history of peripheral arterial disease and antiplatelet
   drugs. The same factors, except antiplatelet treatment, were found to be
   significant at multi-variate analysis.
   Conclusion. Surgical intervention for lower limb ischemia is associated
   with high 2-year mortality but offers good 2-year limb salvage. The
   pattern of risk factors for reocclusion and amputation rates is quite
   different from those affecting mortality. Only thrombotic aetiology is a
   significant risk factor for all the three outcomes.},

Abstract = {Since 2006, the members of the molecular epidemiological working group
   of the European ``EPIZONE{''} network of excellence have been generating
   sequence data on avian influenza and avian paramyxoviruses from both
   European and African sources in an attempt to more fully understand the
   circulation and impact of these viruses. This review presents a timely
   update on the epidemiological situation of these viruses based on
   sequence data generated during the lifetime of this project in addition
   to data produced by other groups during the same period. Based on this
   information and putting it all into a European context, recommendations
   for continued surveillance of these important viruses within Europe are
   presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs) are structures that are morphologically
   and functionally similar to secondary lymphoid organs. TLOs usually
   arise in a background of chronic inflammation. Several histological
   patterns of interstitial nephritis have been documented in porcine
   leptospirosis. Among them the lympho-follicular pattern is characterized
   by infiltrates of mononuclear cells organized in lymphoid follicle-like
   structures. Immunohistological analysis of 5 cases of porcine
   lympho-follicular nephritis associated with Leptospira Pomona infection
   demonstrated the presence of inflammatory cell populations, including B
   cells, T cells, macrophages and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), which
   were compart-mentalized as in TLOs. Immunohistochemistry for Leptospira
   Pomona revealed an intimate association between leptospiral antigen and
   FDCs. Overexpression of MHCII in different populations of both
   professional and non-professional antigen presenting cells was also
   demonstrated. FDCs play role during TLOs induction for their ability to
   retain non-self antigens in the form of immune complexes, thus causing
   persistent T cell activation, generation of a complex cytokine network
   and stimulation of humoral immunity. Sustained bacterial antigen
   presentation in the context of chronic leptospiral nephritis, may also
   lead to autoimmune mechanisms involved in the generation of TLOs.
   Whether lymphoid neogenesis and TLOs play a protective role in porcine
   leptospiral nephritis is still unclear. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Antigen-Specific T Cells and Cytokines Detection as Useful Tool for
   Understanding Immunity against Zoonotic Infections},
Journal = {CLINICAL \& DEVELOPMENTAL IMMUNOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Abstract = {Zoonoses include a broad range of diseases, that are becoming of great
   interest, due to the climate changing, that cause the adaptation of
   vectors to new niches and environments. Host immune responses play a
   crucial role in determining the outcome of infections, as documented by
   expansion of antigen-specific T cells during several zoonotic
   infections. Thus, understanding of the contribution of antigen-specific
   T-cell subsets in the host immune response is a powerful tool to
   evaluate the different immunological mechanisms involved in zoonotic
   infections and for the development of effective vaccines. In this paper
   we discuss the role of T cells in some eukaryotic and prokaryotic
   infectious models.},

Abstract = {The objective of the present study was to examine the phylogenetic
   position of Setaria cervi based on sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome
   c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene. A fragment of the cox1 gene from two
   morphologically identified S. cervi collected from red deer (Cervus
   elaphus) from Italy were amplified, sequenced, and compared with
   corresponding sequences of other filarioid nematode species.
   Phylogenetic studies using Bayesian analysis revealed S. cervi as
   monophyletic with other Setaria species, confirming S. cervi as a member
   of the Setaria genus. S. cervi appeared to be sister species to Setaria
   labiatopapillosa and Setaria digitata. Setaria tundra and Setaria
   equina, the other two Setaria species presented in the Italian fauna,
   formed a sister group to the clade consisting of S. cervi, S.
   labiatopapillosa, and S. digitata. In addition to phylogenetic
   clarification, our study is the first molecular identification of S.
   cervi, which may be useful for further molecular identification and
   differentiation of this filarial worm from other filarioid nematode
   species, especially in the earlier developmental stages of its life
   cycle.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL},
Year = {2012},
Abstract = {Four goats bred in Central Italy (province of Rieti) revealed, in the
   liver, metacestodes of Echinococcus granulosus. The cysts, unilocular
   and fertile, were examined by microscopy and molecular diagnostics.
   Morphological data on the rostellar hooks are in agreement with the
   original description of the strain found in buffaloes and are largely
   compatible with those reported in Europe for cattle and humans. Specific
   PCR followed by DNA sequencing of the mitochondrial cox1 gene revealed
   for all the isolates 99.5\% identity to the reference strain G3 genotype
   and 99.3\% and 99.1\% to G2 and G1, respectively. Further genetic
   markers (nad1 and 12S rRNA) confirmed the identity of the goat isolates
   to the G3 strain. This genotype, here reported for the first time in
   goats, proved to have a wider than previously supposed host range,
   therefore its relevance in human hydatidosis is expected to be more
   often evidenced.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the variations of vitamin B12
   and homocysteine in blood of dairy cows during subacute ruminal acidosis
   (SARA). On 228 subjects ruminal liquid was collected through
   rumenocentesis technique and rumen pH was immediately measured by a
   portable pH-meter. On the basis of pH values all cows were classified
   (bovine class) in Group A (animals with rumen pH>5.7), Group B (animals
   with rumen pH between 5.6 and 5.7) and Group C (animals with rumen
   pH<5.6). In relation to the acidosis risk depending on the rumen pH
   (herd class), the herds were classified in Group 1 (normal herds: less
   than 33\% cows with rumen pH<5.8), Group 2 (critical herds: more than
   33\% cows with rumen pH between 5.5 and 5.8) and Group 3 (acidosis
   herds: more than 33\% cows with rumen pH<5.5). On blood samples,
   collected by jugular venipuncture, vitamin B12 and homocysteine were
   measured by chemiluminescent immunological tests. One-way analysis of
   variance (ANOVA), followed by Bonferroni test, showed significant
   differences (P<0.05) for vitamin B12 in bovine class and significant
   differences (P<0.05) for homocysteine in herd class. The influence of
   rumen pH values resulted in adequate vitamin B12 and homocysteine levels
   to meet microbial and cow requirements and fatty acids modifications in
   dairy cows affected by SARA. Moreover, the increase of vitamin B12 could
   be due to the presence of analogues which interfere with the transport
   of the vitamin. These findings provide more information on blood
   modifications during SARA.},

Abstract = {Reports of infections from enteric viruses, particularly hepatitis A
   virus (HAV), and norovirus, have resulted in consumers boiling or
   steaming molluscs before eating them and, currently, ready to use,
   pasteurized and packed products are available from the food industry.
   The present study investigated HAV survival in manila clams (Ruditapes
   philippinarum) after infection and subsequent pasteurization treatments
   of different duration and temperature according to established
   industrial procedures. The results showed that HAV was completely
   inactivated only after application of heat treatment at 90 degrees C for
   10 minutes and only when that temperature was reached in the core of the
   mollusc.},

Title = {Parvovirus B19 Infection and Severe Anemia in Renal Transplant
   Recipients},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL},
Year = {2012},
Abstract = {Kidney transplant (KT) recipients can develop symptomatic Parvovirus
   (PV) B19 infections, frequently associated with persistent anemia. The
   aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and clinical
   significance of PV B19 infection in anemic and non-anemic KT patients.
   Overall, out of 64 patients monitored for the presence of PV B19 by
   real-time PCR, 2 (3.12\%) had an active PV B19 infection, in absence of
   other viral coinfections. The 2 cases occurred in nonanemic kidney
   transplant patients group (2/50, 4\%), while none of the anemic
   transplant patients (0/14) was found to suffer from this infection.
   Moreover, patients affected by active PV B19 infection showed viral
   loads not exceeding 1 x 10(5) genome copies/reaction. In conclusion, in
   this study, PV B19 infection was not common in renal transplant
   population and wasn't associated with severe anemia.},

Pages = {465-470},
Abstract = {1. Escherichia coli isolated from lesions (Avian Pathogenic E. coli -
   APEC) of layer hens affected by colibacillosis and from intestinal
   contents of clinically-healthy birds (Avian Faecal E. coli - AFEC) were
   serotyped. All the isolates were investigated for the presence of
   virulence genes to determine which genes were more closely related to
   those from lesions.
   2. A number of different serogroups were detected, O78 being predominant
   among the isolates from colibacillosis.
   3. E. coli isolated from lesions were not linked to a specific pathotype
   (set of common virulence genes).
   4. The presence of the virulence genes, with the exception of astA, was
   associated more generally with APEC strains.
   5. Statistically, genes such as cva/cvi, tsh, iss, irp2 and iucD were
   more related to isolates from colibacillosis.
   6. It is suggested that the detection of these genes in a rapid and
   inexpensive test for field practitioners could provide useful
   information about the potential virulence of E. coli isolated in
   commercial layer flocks.},

Abstract = {Background, aim and scope Metal pollution is a serious problem for
   environmental safety and programmes of monitoring and bioremediation are
   needed. Among the processes of bioremediation, the use of microbes to
   remove and degrade contaminants is considered a biotechnological
   approach to clean up polluted environments.
   Aim The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of Serratia
   marcescens in Pb, Cd and Cr removal and the potential use of these
   bacteria in toxic metal bioremediation from polluted environments.
   Methods A short-term study (120 min) was carried out to study the
   bacterial growth in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of
   each metal analysed and the kinetics of metal biosorption in S.
   marcescens strain. In addition, metal influence on the biosynthesis of
   the red pigment `prodigiosina' by S. marcescens was monitored.
   Results The results obtained in this study show metals biosorption by S.
   marcescens (range: 0.0133-0.213 mu g/g for Pb; 0.097-0.1853 mu g/g for
   Cd; and 0.105-0.176 mu g/g for Cr) and confirm the possible use of this
   bacterium to realize bioremediation processes, especially for Pb
   removal, and as a bioindicator of metal pollution.},

Abstract = {The content of chlorides, nitrites, nitrates, phosphates and sulphates
   was used to classify 45 donkey's milk samples collected from different
   Italian regions. A method employing ion exchange chromatography with
   conductivity detector and chemical suppression was used. The
   quantitative results indicated phosphates (569.4-1304.4 mg kg(-1)) and
   chlorides (545.9-1757.9 mg mg kg(-1)) as being the most abundant anions,
   followed by sulphates (109.5-200.7 mg kg(-1)). The concentrations of
   nitrites and nitrates were found to be lower at 5.6 and 5.5 mg kg(-1)
   respectively. The data set was subdivided into three groups according to
   the region of origin of milk, and was statistically evaluated by
   analysis of variance (ANOVA). Concentrations of chlorides and nitrites
   showed a significant difference among farms (p<0.001). In a first
   discriminant analysis procedure, functions based on linear combinations
   of the log(e)-transformed element concentrations of anions were
   generated to classify donkey's milk samples from different regions. In
   an alternative approach, a three-step discriminant analysis procedure to
   classify a milk sample was tested. The results obtained led to a correct
   classification of donkey's milk samples based on their anions content
   with 91-98\% of the samples being correctly classified. The procedure
   proved to be very simple, so it could be used as an evaluation method
   for the traceability of donkey's milk, thus defending this unique
   product against fraud or commercial disputes.},

Abstract = {Predator fishes at the top of the aquatic food chain can accumulate
   large concentrations of metals and their consumption, consequently,
   makes a significant contribution, in particular, to mercury intake. The
   aim of this study was to determine mercury levels in fillets of two
   predatory species: pangasius (Pangasius hypophthalmus) from the Vietnam
   region of Megong and Chao Pharayai and cod (Gadus morhua) from the
   Baltic and North Sea, both being commercially important in the Italian
   market. A comparative analysis of these two imported fish species was
   carried out as a risk assessment for consumer safety. The results showed
   the presence of higher mercury levels in pangasius (0.41 +/- 0.08 mg
   kg(-1)) than in cod (0.11 +/- 0.004 mg kg(-1)) fillets. These data
   underline the importance of monitoring on imported fish before
   marketing, to evaluate better the risk of mercury exposure through fish
   and seafood consumption, and of selecting safer fishes for consumption
   by those groups more sensitive to the toxic effects of this metal.},

Title = {Field handling conditions of raw milk sold in vending machines:

Abstract = {The direct sale by farmers of raw milk for human consumption has been
   allowed in Italy since 2004. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   behaviour of selected foodborne pathogens in raw milk sold in vending
   machines, in field handling conditions, and during shelf-life from
   production to consumption. Temperature of storage of raw milk in 33
   farms authorized to produce and sell raw milk were investigated from
   farm to vending machine delivery, together with consumer habits in one
   province of the Emilia-Romagna region of northern Italy. Failure to
   maintain appropriate low temperatures during shelf-life was recorded and
   43\% of consumers did not boil milk before consumption. Listeria
   monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium and
   Campylobacter jejuni strains were inoculated into raw milk samples, and
   the best (4 degrees C as established by law) and worst temperature
   storage conditions detected (variable temperature) were simulated.
   Boiling tests were performed for each pathogen considered at high and
   low levels of contamination. Results showed an increase in L.
   monocytogenes in milk stored at 4 degrees C and at variable temperatures
   recorded in shelf-life monitoring, an increase in E. coli O157:H7 and S.
   Typhimurium at variable temperatures but not at 4 degrees C, and a
   decrease in C. jejuni in all storage conditions. Boiling milk is
   effective in making it safe for consumers.
   This study provides evidence that appropriate handling of raw milk,
   maintaining low temperatures, together with consumer education
   concerning boiling raw milk before consumption are key factors in
   preventing foodborne infections linked to raw milk consumption, and
   helps assess the risk of foodborne infection linked to raw milk
   consumption.},

Abstract = {To investigate the daily rhythm of cortisol in horse and to establish

   established body temperature circadian rhythm. Blood samples and rectal
   temperature were collected every 3 h during all the experimental period.
   Two-way for repeated measure analysis of variance showed statistically
   significant effect of time and no effect of experimental conditions on
   both studied parameters. In the two experimental conditions, both
   parameters showed robust circadian rhythmicity, with diurnal acrophase
   for cortisol and nocturnal acrophase for rectal temperature. In
   conclusion, serum cortisol daily fluctuation showed oppose trend respect
   to daily fluctuation of rectal temperature, and its rhythm is

Abstract = {Cutaneous mast cell tumors (MCTs) are among the most common neoplasms in
   dogs and show a highly variable biologic behavior. Histological grading,
   cell proliferation markers, and KIT immunohistochemistry are typically
   used to predict post-surgical prognosis. In the present study, c-KIT
   messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was measured in canine MCTs and its
   relationship with tumor grade, immunohistochemical staining pattern,
   post-surgical prognosis, and mutations was investigated. A significant
   increase of c-KIT mRNA was observed in MCTs versus healthy skin and
   surgical margins. Mutations were observed in 8.3\% of cases. The KIT
   staining pattern was investigated for both grading systems. In
   particular, staining pattern III was associated with grade II (G2) and
   G3 MCTs, while staining patterns I and II were associated with G1 and G2
   MCTs. Considering the 2-tier histological grading, the high grade was
   mainly associated with pattern III (71\%) while the low grade was
   associated with patterns II (70\%) and I (28\%). A weak association
   between the KIT staining pattern and outcome was also observed. The
   results obtained suggest that c-KIT mRNA is overexpressed in canine MCT,
   although the fold variations were not associated with the protein
   localization or complementary DNA mutations. These observations
   suggested that the 3 events were independent. The histological grading
   and the KIT staining pattern have prognostic value as previously
   published. Staining pattern I could be especially helpful in predicting
   a good prognosis of G2 MCTs. Sequence mutations were not necessarily
   suggestive of a worse prognosis, but might be useful in choosing a
   chemotherapy protocol.},

Abstract = {The aim of this work is testing the efficiency of homeopathy to improve
   the resistance of bee families. 20 hives was divided at random in two
   groups: 10 were treated with Calcarea Sulphurica 200 CH (C) and 10
   received only water (W). To control Varroasis, the groups were both
   treated with block brood and Api-Bioxal (based on oxalic acid). We
   recorded the incidences of Varroa destructor by counting the natural
   mite fall, and by detecting through PCR the presence of Nosema spp. and
   virus. We evaluated the honey production by weighing beehives and
   supers. All data were statistically analysed. After the brood block,
   natural mite fall diminished in group C, but only after Api-Bioxal this
   difference became significant. At first, Nosema increased in group C,
   but after completely disappeared. Some viruses showed significant
   difference between groups. Beehive weight and honey production didn't'
   show significant differences between groups. The first results could
   indicate the efficiency of homeopathic treatments in controlling
   Varroasis and Nosemosis.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to compare soy lecithins (L), a
   by-product of the biodiesel production process, with choline chloride
   microencapsulated with hydrogenated vegetable oils (C), to verify their
   effects on dry matter intake, milk yield, milk quality traits, milk
   choline and haematological profile of dairy cows. A total of 12
   mid-lactating Holstein Friesian cows were assigned to one of two
   experimental groups and fed according to cross-over design (2 diets x 2
   periods). Diets were isoenergetic, isofibrous and isonitrogenous and had
   the same content of choline. Dry matter intake, milk yield and the 3.5\%
   fat-corrected milk (FCM) were not affected by the diet. The milk choline
   content and the milk quality did not differ between treatments, with the
   exception of milk fat (P<0.05) and urea (P<0.01), which resulted lower
   for the L-group. Milk fat, protein and choline yields remained
   unaffected. With regard to the haematological profile, all of the
   parameters fell within the physiological range of lactating dairy cows,
   and the only difference was represented by the lower urea level of the L
   fed cows (P<0.01), that could be explained by a better N metabolic
   efficiency. Results indicated that soy lecithins can be used as an
   available source of choline in mid-lactating dairy cows.},

Abstract = {A total of 1388 goats from 31 farms distributed throughout Sardinia,
   Italy, were investigated in this study. The goat population of Sardinia
   accounts for a quarter of the entire goat population of Italy. In this
   work, data and information concerning each farming site were collected,
   a detailed clinical examination of the udder of lactating animals was
   carried out, and microbiological examination of milk was performed.
   Results were then subjected to statistical analysis in order to
   highlight possible correlations among all findings. Significant results
   were obtained by comparing clinical findings with bacteriological
   positivity of milk.
   Intra-mammary infections were detected in 22.7\% of all goats examined.
   Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., and Myco plasma spp. were
   detected in 73.5\%, 9.7\%, and 4.7\% of positive milk cultures,
   respectively. Other bacterial genera showed a prevalence lower than 3\%.
   Milk positivity to Staphylococcus aureus was significantly associated to
   presence in the udder of pustules, ulcers, nodules, and rubor (p <
   0.05). Staphylococcus caprae was associated to manual vs mechanical
   milking, age, udder edema, and absence of mammary secretions (p < 0.05).
   Staphylococcus epidermidis was positively associated to age (p < 0.05).
   Streptococcus uberis was associated to mechanical milking, atrophic
   udder texture, and reactive mammary lymph nodes (p < 0.05). Several
   other factors showed statistically significant correlations. Taken
   together, the results presented in this work highlight the specificity,
   the usefulness, and the practical value of performing a clinical
   examination of the udder, and suggest its relevance as the most
   important diagnostic tool for complementing microbiological examination
   of milk. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Pages = {392-394},
Abstract = {Nineteen ticks belonging to the species Dermacentor marginatus,
   Rhipicephalus bursa, and Haemaphysalis sulcata were collected from wild
   animals (wild boar, deer, and mouflon) in south-western Sardinia, Italy.
   Five D. marginatus ticks from wild boar were PCR-positive when analyzed
   using gltA-specific and ompA-specific primers, leading to the
   identification and first isolation in cell culture of Rickettsia
   slovaca, the causative agent of tick-borne lymphadenopathy (TIBOLA), on
   the island of Sardinia. This study confirms the detection of a new
   tick-borne rickettsia that can be added to the others already known to
   be present in Sardinia (Rickettsia aeschlimannii, R. massiliae, and
   Candidatus Rickettsia barbariae). These data increase our knowledge of
   tick-borne rickettsioses in Sardinia and, more generally, in the
   Mediterranean basin. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Canine monocytic ehrlichiosis is a common and widespread disease. This
   disease is present in Sardinia year-round because the temperate weather
   on the island permits the survival of many types of tick vectors. A
   total of 35 ticks was collected from goats in south-eastern Sardinia,
   Italy, and tested for Ehrlichia DNA using polymerase chain reaction and
   DNA sequencing. This study provides the first evidence of the presence
   of Ehrlichia canis in Rhipicephalus bursa ticks. The data presented here
   increase our knowledge of tick-borne diseases in Sardinia and provide a
   useful contribution toward understanding their epidemiology. The role of
   R. bursa in the life cycle and transmission of E. canis needs however
   further investigation. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

   occupation-related data were collected. Serum total immunoglobulin E
   (IgE) and specific IgE levels to AS (threshold >0.35 kU/L) were
   determined by an fluoroimmunoassay technique. Ninety-four subjects with
   potential occupational exposure (fishmongers, fishermen, fish industry
   employees) were recruited. Specific AS IgEs were detected in 20.2\% of
   the study population. AS IgE seroprevalence was elevated 6.7-fold (p =
   .03) among fishermen/sailors compared with fish industry workers. The
   study suggested the importance to adopt specific prevention strategies
   against exposure to AS in the occupational setting.},

Abstract = {Investigations into immune responses are often based upon recovery of
   peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). To this purpose, the recovery
   of PBMC by gradient centrifugation is labour-intensive and requires a
   reasonable level of skill by the laboratory technician. Thus, we set out
   to determine whether laboratory automation equipment could be used for
   the recovery of PBMC from blood samples of horses, pigs and cattle,
   based on the Ficoll-Paque gradient centrifugation technique. Mixing of
   blood samples with PBS, layering of diluted blood onto Ficoll-Paque
   gradients, recovery of separated PBMC in RPMI 1640 medium were performed
   using an automated robotic system, the SBF200 (AM Robotic Systems,
   Warrington, UK) under laminar air flow conditions. Tubes were tagged
   with bar codes and manually placed after gradient centrifugation into a
   tube reader to measure the volume and position of the PBMC layer. The
   results of the automated procedure compared very well to those of the
   manual one in terms of percent cell recovery, sterility and cell
   viability. Also, a high throughput of samples could be implemented: with
   the integration of cell counting it should be possible for 96 blood
   samples to be processed, including the production of aliquots, by one
   person in a day. (C) 2011 The International Alliance for Biological

Abstract = {Viral encephalopathy and retinopathy (VER) is one of the most
   devastating diseases for marine aquaculture, and similarly represents a
   threat to wild fish populations because of its high infectivity and
   broad host range. Betanodavirus, the causative agent of VER, is a small
   non-enveloped virus with a bipartite RNA genome comprising the RNA1 and
   RNA2 segments. We partially sequenced both RNA1 and RNA2 from 120 viral
   strains isolated from 2000 to 2009 in six different countries in
   Southern Europe. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of the
   red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) (n = 96) and striped
   jack nervous necrosis virus (SJNNV) (n = 1) genotypes in Southern
   Europe, with 23/120 samples classified as RGNNV/SJNNV reassortants.
   Viruses sampled from individual countries tended to cluster together
   suggesting a major geographic subdivision among betanodaviruses,
   although some phylogenetic evidence for viral gene flow was also
   obtained. Rates of nucleotide substitution were similar to those
   observed in a broad array of RNA viruses, and revealed a significantly
   higher evolutionary rate in the polymerase compared to the coat protein
   gene. This may reflect temperature adaptation of betanodaviruses,
   although a site-specific analysis of selection pressures identified
   relatively few selected sites in either gene. Overall, our analyses
   yielded novel data on the evolutionary dynamics and phylogeography of
   betanodaviruses and therein provides a more complete understanding of
   the distribution and evolution of different genotypes in Southern

Abstract = {The aims of this study were to determine the seroprevalence for
   Rickettsia conorii, Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and
   Babesia canis in outdoor-kennelled dogs (n = 249) from the Stretto di
   Messina (Italy) and to compare seroprevalence in 2 public shelters and 4
   privately-owned kennels where different tick-preventive measures were
   implemented in order to focus on the specific sanitary risk posed by
   public shelters in southern Italy for tick-borne pathogens. R. conorii
   (72\%) and B. canis (70\%) were the most prevalent infections when
   compared to E. canis (46\%) and A. phagocytophilum (38\%).
   Seroprevalence for R. conorii, E canis, and A. phagocytophilum was
   significantly higher in public shelters than in private kennels.
   However, B. canis seropositivity was similar in both types of kennels.
   In addition, in private kennels where a regular ectocide treatment was
   carried out by means of spot-on devices, dogs did not present E. canis
   and A. phagocytophilum antibodies. One hundred fifty-one dogs out of 249
   (61\%) were seropositive to more than one pathogen with R. conorii and
   B. canis the most common ones. Coinfections were more frequently found
   in public-shelter dogs. This study demonstrated high seroprevalences
   against R. conorii, B. canis, E. canis, and A. phagocytophilum in
   kennelled dogs from both coastal sites of the Stretto di Messina and the
   importance of regular tick-bite prevention by means of individual
   spot-on devices. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) and Alzheimer
   disease (AD) both misfolding and aggregation of specific proteins
   represent key features. Recently, it was observed that PrPC is a
   mediator of a synaptic dysfunction induced by A beta oligomers. We
   tested a novel gamma-secretase modulator (CHF5074) in a murine model of
   prion disease. Groups of female mice were intracerebrally or
   intraperitoneally infected with the mouse-adapted Rocky Mountain
   Laboratory prions. Two weeks prior infection, the animals were provided
   with a CHF5074-medicated diet (375 ppm) or a standard diet (vehicle)
   until they showed neurological signs and eventually died. In
   intracerebrally infected mice, oral administration of CHF5074 did not
   prolong survival of the animals. In intraperitoneally-infected mice,
   CHF5074-treated animals showed a median survival time of 21 d longer
   than vehicle-treated mice (p < 0.001). In these animals,
   immunohistochemistry analyses showed that deposition of PrPSc in the
   cerebellum, hippocampus and parietal cortex in CHF5074-treated mice was
   significantly lower than in vehicle-treated animals. Immunostaining of
   glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in parietal cortex revealed a
   significantly higher reactive gliosis in CHF5074-treated mice compared
   with the control group of infected animals. Although the mechanism
   underlying the beneficial effects of CHF5074 in this murine model of
   human prion disease is unclear, it could be hypothesized that the drug
   counteracts PrPSc toxicity through astrocyte-mediated neuroprotection.
   CHF5074 shows a pharmacological potential in murine models of both AD
   and TSEs thus suggesting a link between these degenerative pathologies.},

Title = {Staphylococcus aureus CC398: Host Adaptation and Emergence of
   Methicillin Resistance in Livestock},
Journal = {MBIO},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {Since its discovery in the early 2000s, methicillin-resistant
   Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clonal complex 398 (CC398) has become a
   rapidly emerging cause of human infections, most often associated with
   livestock exposure. We applied whole-genome sequence typing to
   characterize a diverse collection of CC398 isolates (n = 89), including
   MRSA and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) from animals and
   humans spanning 19 countries and four continents. We identified 4,238
   single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among the 89 core genomes.
   Minimal homoplasy (consistency index = 0.9591) was detected among
   parsimony-informative SNPs, allowing for the generation of a highly
   accurate phylogenetic reconstruction of the CC398 clonal lineage.
   Phylogenetic analyses revealed that MSSA from humans formed the most
   ancestral clades. The most derived lineages were composed predominantly
   of livestock-associated MRSA possessing three different staphylococcal
   cassette chromosome mec element (SCCmec) types (IV, V, and VII-like)
   including nine subtypes. The human-associated isolates from the basal
   clades carried phages encoding human innate immune modulators that were
   largely missing among the livestock-associated isolates. Our results
   strongly suggest that livestock-associated MRSA CC398 originated in
   humans as MSSA. The lineage appears to have undergone a rapid radiation
   in conjunction with the jump from humans to livestock, where it
   subsequently acquired tetracycline and methicillin resistance. Further
   analyses are required to estimate the number of independent genetic
   events leading to the methicillin-resistant sublineages, but the
   diversity of SCCmec subtypes is suggestive of strong and diverse
   antimicrobial selection associated with food animal production.
   IMPORTANCE Modern food animal production is characterized by densely
   concentrated animals and routine antibiotic use, which may facilitate
   the emergence of novel antibiotic-resistant zoonotic pathogens. Our
   findings strongly support the idea that livestock-associated MRSA CC398
   originated as MSSA in humans. The jump of CC398 from humans to livestock
   was accompanied by the loss of phage-carried human virulence genes,
   which likely attenuated its zoonotic potential, but it was also
   accompanied by the acquisition of tetracycline and methicillin
   resistance. Our findings exemplify a bidirectional zoonotic exchange and
   underscore the potential public health risks of widespread antibiotic
   use in food animal production.},

Journal = {BIOPRESERVATION AND BIOBANKING},
Year = {2012},

Pages = {276-281},
Abstract = {The advent of stem cells and stem cell-based therapies for specific
   diseases requires particular knowledge of laboratory procedures, which
   not only guarantee the continuous production of cells, but also provide
   them an identity and integrity as close as possible to their origin.
   Their cryopreservation at temperatures below -80 degrees C and typically
   below -140 degrees C is of paramount importance. This target can be
   achieved by incorporating high molar concentrations of cryoprotectant
   mixtures that preserve cells from deleterious ice crystal formation.
   Usually, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and animal proteins are used as
   protectant reagents, but unexpected changes in stem cell fate and
   downstream toxicity effects have been reported, limiting their wide use
   in clinical settings. In scientific reviews, there are not much data
   regarding viability of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) after the
   freezing/thawing process. During our routine analysis, a poor resistance
   to cryopreservation of these cells was observed, as well as their weak
   ability to replicate. This is an important point in the study of MSCs;
   moreover, it represents a limit for preservation and long-term storage.
   For this reason, MSCs isolated from equine, ovine, and rodent bone
   marrow and equine adipose tissue were compared using different
   cryopreservation solutions for this study of vitality. Our findings
   showed the best results regarding cell viability using a solution of
   fetal bovine serum with addition of 10\% DMSO. In particular, we noted
   an increase in survival of equine bone marrow MSCs. This parameter has
   been evaluated by Trypan blue staining at fixed times (0, 24, and 48
   hours post-thaw). This result highlights the fact that equine bone
   marrow MSCs are the frailest we analyzed. Therefore, it could be useful
   to delve further into this topic in order to improve the storage
   possibility for these cells and their potential use in cell-based
   therapies.},

Abstract = {Monovalent, inactivated and adjuvanted vaccines against African horse
   sickness, prepared with serotypes 5 and 9, were tested on guinea-pigs to
   select the formulation that offered the greatest immunity. The final
   formulation of the vaccines took into account the immune response in the
   guinea-pig and the inflammatory properties of two types of adjuvant
   previously tested on target animals. A pilot study was subsequently
   conducted on horses using a vaccine prepared with serotype 9. The
   vaccine stimulated neutralising antibodies from the first administration
   and, after the booster dose, 28 days later; high antibody levels were
   recorded for at least 10 months. The guinea-pig appears to be a useful
   laboratory model for the evaluation of the antigenic properties of
   African horse sickness vaccines.},

Abstract = {Water buffalo mozzarella cheese (WBMC) is a fresh pasta filata cheese
   produced from whole chilled buffalo milk. Although pasteurization of
   milk and the use of defined starter cultures are recommended,
   traditional technology involving the use of unpasteurized milk and
   natural whey cultures is still employed for WBMC production in Italy.
   The aim of this study were to assess the behaviour of Salmonella
   Typhimurium during the production of artisan water buffalo mozzarella
   cheese and during its shelf life under different temperature conditions.
   Raw milk was inoculated with S. Typhimurium and the evolution of S.
   Typhimurium count during production and shelf life was monitored. In
   artisan WBMC production technology S. Typhimurium multiplied in the curd
   during ripening, but its growth rate expressed in log CFU/g/h was lower
   than the growth rate reported by theoretical predictions. Stretching
   proved to be a process with good repeatability and able to reduce S.
   Typhimurium contamination by 5.5 Log CFU/g. The intrinsic
   characteristics of traditional WBMC proved to be unable to obstacolate
   the growth of S. Typhimurium during storage in the case of thermal
   abuse. Control of raw milk contamination and a proper refrigeration
   temperature are key factors in reducing the risk for consumers.},

Abstract = {The study was carried out in zoo animals at Islamabad Zoo, Pakistan to
   know the prevalence of bovine tuberculosis. An overall prevalence of
   3.3\% was recorded in zoo animals with 3.6\% in Bovidae, 3.2\% in
   Cervidae and 0\% in Equidae families. The positive animals included
   spotted deer (1/3; 95\% CI = 0.84, 90.57), Chinkara gazella (1/5; 95\%
   CI = 0.51, 71.64) and Blackbuck gazelle (1/30; 95\% CI = 0.08, 17.22),
   while the negative animals were barking deer (0/4), hog deer (0/24),
   grey gorals (0/2), urial (0/9), mouflon (0/4), nilgai (0/5) and zebra
   (0/4). The results revealed significant association of live weight and
   number of calving with the positive tuberculin test, with 32\% higher
   chances for females to show a positive test. Results also showed that
   odds of a positive test were 1.19 times higher when animal number was
   less than 10. The results of haematological parameters showed
   significant differences in total erythrocyte counts, hemoglobin, total
   leukocyte counts, eosinophil and basophil percentages between positive
   and negative animals.},

Journal = {AVIAN PATHOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {41},

Pages = {429-435},
Abstract = {Avian astroviruses, of the genus Avastrovirus, are recognized as being
   the cause of enteritis in different bird species worldwide. In
   particular, turkeys are very susceptible and can be severely affected by
   this viral agent. More recently, astroviruses were detected in diseased
   guinea fowl in Italy but whether or not they were the causative agents
   of the clinical disease was not established. Despite the distribution
   and relevance of Avastrovirus infection, very little information on
   pathogenesis or factors influencing the pathogenicity of astroviruses is
   available. To increase available data on the pathogenesis of these
   viruses and to test the hypothesis of possible interspecies
   transmission, experimental infections were carried out in turkeys and
   guinea fowl with two genetically distinct avian astroviruses, namely
   TK-6363 and GF-5497, originating respectively from diseased turkey
   poults and guinea fowl. Data obtained in our study show that both of the
   viruses selected were able to infect young birds of the species in which
   they were originally detected. Additionally, these viruses were able to
   infect young birds of different species causing clinical signs, thus
   providing experimental evidence for the infection of distinct avian
   astroviruses in different avian species.},

Title = {Development and validation of two PCR tests for the detection of and

Journal = {TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {3},
Number = {5-6},
Pages = {282-286},
Abstract = {Anaplasma ovis and Anaplasma marginale are tick-transmitted bacteria
   that cause anaplasmosis in domestic and wild animals. Recent results
   show that some domestic and wild animals and ticks are susceptible to
   both A. ovis and A. marginale, thus supporting the need to differentiate
   between these species in hosts and ticks diagnosed with Anaplasma
   infection. However, although anaplasmosis is one of the most common
   diseases of grazing animals worldwide, rapid and effective tests are not
   available for the detection of and discrimination between these 2
   Anaplasma species. The objective of this research was to develop an easy
   and reliable method to identify and discriminate between the closely
   related pathogens A. ovis and A. marginale. A. ovis and A. marginale
   major surface protein 4 (msp4) gene sequences were retrieved from
   different geographic strains and aligned to design 2 sets of primers in
   a region with significant differences between the 2 species, but
   completely conserved among strains. PCR reactions using these primers
   were 100\% species-specific and detected all strains from each pathogen
   previously identified with other methods. The 2 sets of primers designed
   for the specific PCR amplification of A. ovis and A. marginale allow
   easy-to-detect and discriminate between the 2 pathogens, thus avoiding
   the time-consuming sequencing or multi-gene amplification procedures.
   This PCR provides a tool for the detection of A. ovis and A. marginale
   in ticks and in wildlife and domestic hosts. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All

   activities (36,2 +/- 27,5 ILU/g). Pathogens and microorganisms,
   considered to be markers of hygienic conditions, were absent or less
   than the maximum count tolerated. Our results showed that the treatment
   performed on artisanal rennet pastes did not favour the growth of germs
   dangerous to consumer health and assured the enzymatic content necessary

Abstract = {The aims of this study were to determine natural infections by Anaplasma
   phagocytophilum/Anaplasma platys, Bartonella henselae, Ehrlichia canis,
   Leishmania infantum, Rickettsia spp., Babesia spp., and Hepatozoon spp.
   by molecular methods in ticks (n = 91) removed from dogs with clinical
   signs and laboratory abnormalities compatible with tick-borne diseases
   (n = 22) living in Italy and to assess the distribution and species of
   ticks encountered. Ticks from dogs living in southern Italy were all
   identified as Rhipicephalus sanguineus (n = 25), ticks from central
   Italy included Rh. sanguineus (n = 8) and lxodes ricinus (n = 9), ticks
   from northern Italy included Rh. sanguineus (n = 45), Dermacentor
   marginatus (n = 3), and one I. ricinus. Leishmania infantum, Rickettsia
   spp., and Babesia canis were the only pathogens detected in 7 (8\%),
   4(4\%), and 2(2\%) out of 91 ticks, respectively. L. infantum was
   detected in I. ricinus from central Italy and in Rh. sanguineus from
   northern and central Italy. Rickettsia conorii and Ri. massiliae were
   detected in Rh. sanguineus ticks from central and southern Italy
   (Sicily), respectively. Bob. canis was detected in D. marginatus ticks
   from northern Italy. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved,},

Title = {Managed honey bee colony losses in Canada, China, Europe, Israel and

Abstract = {In 2008 the COLOSS network was formed by honey bee experts from Europe
   and the USA. The primary objectives set by this scientific network were
   to explain and to prevent large scale losses of honey bee (Apis
   mellifera) colonies. In June 2008 COLOSS obtained four years support
   from the European Union from COST and was designated as COST Action
   FA0803 - COLOSS (Prevention of honey bee COlony LOSSes). To enable the
   comparison of loss data between participating countries, a standardized
   COLOSS questionnaire was developed. Using this questionnaire information
   on honey bee losses has been collected over two years. Survey data
   presented in this study were gathered in 2009 from 12 countries and in
   2010 from 24 countries. Mean honey bee losses in Europe varied widely,
   between 7-22\% over the 2008-9 winter and between 7-30\% over the
   2009-10 winter. An important finding is that for all countries which
   participated in 2008-9, winter losses in 2009-10 were found to be
   substantially higher. In 2009-10, winter losses in South East Europe
   were at such a low level that the factors causing the losses in other
   parts of Europe were absent, or at a level which did not affect colony
   survival. The five provinces of China, which were included in 2009-10,
   showed very low mean (4\%) A. mellifera winter losses. In six Canadian
   provinces, mean winter losses in 2010 varied between 16-25\%, losses in
   Nova Scotia (40\%) being exceptionally high. In most countries and in
   both monitoring years, hobbyist beekeepers (1-50 colonies) experienced
   higher losses than practitioners with intermediate beekeeping operations
   (51-500 colonies). This relationship between scale of beekeeping and
   extent of losses effect was also observed in 2009-10, but was less
   pronounced. In Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Poland, 2008-9 mean
   winter losses for beekeepers who reported `disappeared' colonies were
   significantly higher compared to mean winter losses of beekeepers who
   did not report `disappeared' colonies. Mean 2008-9 winter losses for
   those beekeepers in the Netherlands who reported symptoms similar to
   ``Colony Collapse Disorder{''} (CCD), namely: 1. no dead bees in or
   surrounding the hive while; 2. capped brood was present, were
   significantly higher than mean winter losses for those beekeepers who
   reported `disappeared' colonies without the presence of capped brood in
   the empty hives. In the winter of 2009-10 in the majority of
   participating countries, beekeepers who reported `disappeared' colonies
   experienced higher winter losses compared with beekeepers, who
   experienced winter losses but did not report `disappeared' colonies.},

Abstract = {Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid widely employed in bovine
   clinical practice that may also be used illegally as a growth promoter.
   Recent in vitro and in vivo studies lend support to the hypothesis that
   prednisolone could be synthesised from cortisol in untreated cattle
   subjected to stressful events. To verify such a hypothesis, a field
   survey was conducted on urine samples collected from 131 guaranteed
   untreated cows and analysed for the presence of prednisolone and
   prednisone - in some instances also for cortisol and cortisone - with a
   validated LC/MS-MS method. None of the examined samples exhibited either
   prednisolone levels higher than the CC alpha limit (around 0.70 mu g
   l(-1)) or prednisone, being therefore officially compliant for both
   analytes. Trace amounts of prednisolone, approximately estimated in the
   range 0.1-0.3 mu g l(-1) were found in only seven samples from cows also
   showing urinary cortisol and cortisone levels higher than those detected
   in negative specimens, as the result of a probable stress condition.},

Abstract = {Anatomical and functional studies on the autonomic innervation as well
   as the location of airway receptors in the air-bladder of lepisosteids
   are very fragmentary. These water-breathing fishes share in common with
   the bichirs the presence of a glottis (not a ductus pneumaticus) opening
   into the esophagus. In contrast to a high concentration of
   neuroepithelial cells (NECs) contained in the furrowed epithelium in the
   lung of Polypterus, these cells are scattered as solitary cells in the
   glottal epithelium, and grouped to form neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs) in
   the mucociliated epithelium investing the main trabeculae in the
   air-bladder of Lepisosteus osseus and L. oculatus. The present
   immunohistochemical studies also demonstrated the presence of nerve
   fibers in the trabecular striated musculature and a possible relation to
   NEBs in these species, and identified immunoreactive elements of this
   innervation. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), choline acetyltransferase
   (ChAT), 5-HT and neuropeptide immunoreactivities were detected in the
   intramural nerve fibers. 5-HT and VIP immunopositive nerve fibers are
   apparently associated with NEBs. TH, VIP and SP immunoreactivities are
   also present in nerve fibers coursing in the radially arranged striated
   muscle surrounding the glottis and its submucosa. 5-HT positive neurons
   are also found in submucosal and the muscle layers of the glottis. The
   physiological function of the adrenergic and inhibitory innervation of
   the striated muscle as well as the neurochemical coding and morphology
   of the innervation of the NEBs are not known. Future studies are needed
   to provide evidence for these receptors with the capacity of
   chemoreceptors and/or mechanoreceptors. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All

   in one and two dolphins, respectively. In spite of the different
   molecular patterns characterizing the above T. gondii genotypes, the
   brain lesions observed in the three animals showed common microscopic
   features, with no remarkable differences among them. The role of T.
   gondii in causing the meningo-encephalitis is herein discussed. (C) 2011

Abstract = {Here we describe an outbreak of European brown hare syndrome (EBHS) in a
   captive hare population. The EBHS outbreak occurred in March 2009, at
   the beginning of the breeding season. Overall mortality was 53\% out of
   an original population of 61 animals. Animals between five and eleven
   months showed a significantly higher mortality rate than other age
   classes. Pregnant females either aborted their foetuses and survived or
   died pregnant. All foetuses (n = 10) of the pregnant hares were PCR
   positive for EBHSV. Only one offspring born during the outbreak
   survived. Shortly after the outbreak, the surviving hares developed a
   specific anti-EBHSV titre between 1:80 and 1:2560, which dropped to
   1:10-1:160 nine months later. Hares between one and three years of age
   developed a significantly higher titre than hares younger than one year
   or older than four years. Offspring born after the outbreak showed a
   lower titre of 1:10, indicating passive antibody transfer via placenta
   and milk. After two months, the titre was not detectable any longer. In
   December 2009, the captive population was vaccinated against EBHS virus
   with inactivated virus prepared from the organs of infected hares. The
   titres after the first vaccination ranged from 1:10 to 1:640, and after
   the second vaccination from 1:10 to 1:320. To estimate the effect of
   EBHS on reproduction, we compared the breeding seasons 2008 and 2009.
   Several possible sources of infection of the colony are discussed, but
   the definite cause could not be determined. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The wood tick Ixodes ricinus, one of the most common arthropod-borne
   disease vectors, is of increasing relevance for human and animal health
   in Europe. The aim of this study was to determine the relative
   contribution of several abiotic and biotic factors potentially affecting
   questing activity and local abundance of I. ricinus in Italy,
   considering the scale at which these factors interact with the
   host-seeking ticks. Within EDEN, a large-scale EU collaborative project
   on eco-epidemiology of vector-borne diseases, we collected questing
   ticks for three consecutive years using a standard protocol at eleven
   sites in the Italian Alps and Apennines. A total of 25 447 I. ricinus
   were collected. All sites showed the same annual pattern of tick
   activity (bimodal for nymphs and unimodal for larvae and adults),
   although the abundance of nymphs was statistically different between
   sites and years. A Generalized Linear Mixed Model and a Linear Mixed
   Model fitted to data for nymphs, showed that while the principal
   variables affecting the local abundance of questing ticks were
   saturation deficit (an index combining temperature and relative
   humidity) and red deer density, the most important variable affecting
   questing nymph activity was saturation deficit. As for the timing of
   seasonal emergence, we confirmed that the threshold temperature at this
   latitude for larvae is 10 degrees C (mean maximum) while that for nymphs
   is 8 degrees C. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Primed with Paclitaxel Provide a New Approach
   for Cancer Therapy},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2011},

Abstract = {Background: Mesenchymal stromal cells may represent an ideal candidate
   to deliver anti-cancer drugs. In a previous study, we demonstrated that
   exposure of mouse bone marrow derived stromal cells to Doxorubicin led
   them to acquire anti-proliferative potential towards co-cultured
   haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). We thus hypothesized whether freshly
   isolated human bone marrow Mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and mature
   murine stromal cells (SR4987 line) primed in vitro with anti-cancer
   drugs and then localized near cancer cells, could inhibit proliferation.
   Methods and Principal Findings: Paclitaxel (PTX) was used to prime
   culture of hMSCs and SR4987. Incorporation of PTX into hMSCs was studied
   by using FICT-labelled-PTX and analyzed by FACS and confocal microscopy.
   Release of PTX in culture medium by PTX primed hMSCs (hMSCsPTX) was
   investigated by HPLC. Culture of Endothelial cells (ECs) and aorta ring
   assay were used to test the anti-angiogenic activity of hMSCsPTX and PTX
   primed SR4987(SR4987PTX), while antitumor activity was tested in vitro
   on the proliferation of different tumor cell lines and in vivo by
   co-transplanting hMSCsPTX and SR4987PTX with cancer cells in mice.
   Nevertheless, despite a loss of cells due to chemo-induced apoptosis,
   both hMSCs and SR4987 were able to rapidly incorporate PTX and could
   slowly release PTX in the culture medium in a time dependent manner. PTX
   primed cells acquired a potent anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic activity
   in vitro that was dose dependent, and demonstrable by using their
   conditioned medium or by co-culture assay. Finally, hMSCsPTX and
   SR4987PTX co-injected with human cancer cells (DU145 and U87MG) and
   mouse melanoma cells (B16) in immunodeficient and in syngenic mice
   significantly delayed tumor takes and reduced tumor growth.
   Conclusions: These data demonstrate, for the first time, that without
   any genetic manipulation, mesenchymal stromal cells can uptake and
   subsequently slowly release PTX. This may lead to potential new tools to
   increase efficacy of cancer therapy.},

Abstract = {In the last decades, multipotent mesenchymal progenitor cells have been
   isolated from many adult tissues of different species. The International
   Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) has recently established that
   multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) is the currently
   recommended designation.
   In this study, we used flow cytometry to evaluate the expression of
   several molecules related to sternness (CD90, CD44, CD73 and STRO-1) in
   undifferentiated, early-passaged MSCs isolated from adipose tissue of
   four donor horses (AdMSCs).
   The four populations unanimously expressed high levels of CD90 and CD44.
   On the contrary, they were unexpectedly negative to CD73. A small
   percentage of the cells, finally, showed the expression of STRO-1. This
   last result might be due to the existence of a small subpopulation of
   STRO-1+ cells or to a poor cross-reactivity of the antibody. A
   remarkable donor-to-donor consistency and reproducibility of these
   findings was demonstrated.
   The data presented herein support the idea that equine AdMSCs may be
   easily isolated and selected by adherence to tissue culture plastic and
   exhibit a surface profile characterized by some peculiar differences in
   comparison to those described in other species.
   Continued characterization of these cells will help to clarify several
   aspects of their biology and may ultimately enable the isolation of
   specific, purified subpopulations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {High energy radiation treatment of foodstuff for microbial control and
   shelf-life extension is being used in many countries. However, for
   consumer protection and information, the European Union has adopted the
   Directives 1999/2/EC and 1999/3/EC to harmonize the rules concerning the
   treatment and trade of irradiated foods in EU countries. Among the
   validated methods to detect irradiated foods the EU directives also
   include Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR/ESR) spectroscopy.
   We describe herein the use of EPR for identification of four species of
   bivalve mollusks, i.e. brown Venus shells (Callista chione), clams
   (Tapes semidecussatus), mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and oysters
   (Ostrea edulis) irradiated with (60)Co gamma-rays. EPR could definitely
   identify irradiated seashells due to the presence of long-lived free
   radicals, primarily CO(2)(-), CO(3)(3-), SO(2)(-) and SO(3)(-) radical
   anions. The presence of other organic free radicals, believed to
   originate from conchiolin, a scleroprotein present in the shells, was
   also ascertained. The use of one of these radicals as a marker for
   irradiation of brown Venus shells and clams can be envisaged. We also
   propose a dosimetric protocol for the reconstruction of the administered
   dose in irradiated oysters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Veterinary drug residues determination in raw milk in Croatia},

Pages = {1941-1948},

Abstract = {A total of 1259 raw milk samples were examined over a three-year period
   for various antibiotics chloramphenicol, penicillins, cephalosporines,
   tetracyclines, sulfonamides, beta-lactams. quinolones, aminoglycosides
   and macrolides. Microbiological and immunoassay methods used for
   determination of these antibiotics were validated according to the
   guidelines laid down by European Commission Decision 2002/657/EC.
   Microbiological screening detected 36 positive samples and in only one
   sample presence of residues was confirmed. Also, immunoassay
   determination found one positive sample on tetracycline residues. In
   total, 37 positive samples were determined, which was equal to a
   frequency of 0.69\% of the total number of targeted analyses. The
   HPLC-DAD method confirmed the presence of residues above the maximum
   residue limits (MRLs) in two samples with concentrations of 12 mu g
   kg(-1) for penicillin G and 19 mu g kg(-1) for amoxicillin, and 1671 mu
   g kg(-1) for tetracycline. Calculated estimated daily intakes (EDIs) for
   antibiotics presented showed lower exposure levels than the fixed values
   of acceptable daily intakes (ADIs). These suggested that raw milk in
   Croatia contain very low levels of veterinary drugs so that
   toxicological risk with regard to consuming of milk could not be
   considered as a public health problem. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the effects of 3 antibiotics used
   for pulmonary pathologies added in the feed of weaned pigs on growth
   performance, commensal microbiota, and immune response. At weaning, a
   total of 72 pigs were randomly assigned by BW and litter to 1 of the
   following diets: control (typical weaning diet), control + 400 mg of
   tilmicosin/kg, control + 600 mg of amoxicillin/kg, and control + 300 mg
   of doxycycline/kg. Individually penned pigs were slaughtered after 3 wk
   (12 pigs/treatment) or 4 wk (6 pigs/treatment). During the fourth week,
   all pigs received the control diet to test the residual effect of the
   antimicrobial supplementation. The antibiotic supplementation increased
   growth and feed intake during the first week (P < 0.01) and over the
   first 3 wk combined (P < 0.05). Gain-to-feed ratio tended to improve
   during the first week (P = 0.076) by the antibiotics compared with the
   control. Among the antibiotic treatments, no difference was observed in
   ADG and feed intake, which were also unchanged by the diet in the fourth
   week. The fecal enterobacteria counts were increased by amoxicillin on d
   14 and 21 (P < 0.05 and 0.01, respectively) and were decreased by
   tilmicosin (P < 0.001) compared with the control. Amoxicillin decreased
   lactic acid bacteria (P < 0.01) counts compared with the control. The
   antibiotic supplementation tended to decrease total bacteria variability
   in the jejunum (Shannon index, P = 0.091) compared with the control. The
   antibiotic treatment decreased the mean total serum IgM concentration (P
   = 0.016) after 3 wk and did not change the mucosal histomorphometry of
   the small intestine. For tilmicosin, the observed positive action on
   piglet performance and feed intake can originate by the decreased costs
   of immune activation determined by the action on intestinal microbiota.
   For amoxicillin and doxycycline, the observation on intestinal and fecal
   microbiota seems to be not sufficient to explain their growth-promoting
   effect.},

Abstract = {A 9-year-old, neutered male cat was presented for a subcutaneous mass on

   developing at the site of microchip application have been reported in
   animals, although the contributory role of vaccine administrations has
   not been ruled out. This is the first report of a microchip-associated
   fibrosarcoma in a cat. Adherence to American Association of Feline

   enabled confirmation of the definitive aetiology of the neoplasia.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of
   sarcosporidiosis in semi-intensively bred cattle in northwestern Italy.
   A diagnostic protocol was setup in which infected animals were
   identified by rapid histological examination of the esophagus,
   diaphragm, and heart and the detected Sarcocystis spp. were subsequently
   typed using conventional electron microscopy in combination with
   molecular techniques. Sarcosporidia cysts were detected in 78.1\% of the
   animals and were seen most often in the esophagus. The cattle is
   intermediate host for Sarcocystis hominis (final host, humans and some
   primates), Sarcocystis cruzi (final host, domestic and wild canids), and
   Sarcocystis hirsuta (final host, wild and domestic cats).All these three
   species of Sarcocystis were identified, variously associated, with the
   following prevalence: S. cruzi (74.2\%), S. hirsuta (1.8\%), and S.
   hominis (42.7\%). Furthermore, a new S. hominis-like (prevalence
   18.5\%), characterized by hook-like structures of villar protrusion and
   a different sequence of the 18S rRNA gene, was identified. The cattle
   sheds testing positive for zoonotic Sarcocystis were assessed for risk
   factors contributing to the maintenance of the parasite's life cycle.
   Significant associations emerged between consumption of raw meat by the
   farm owner, mountain pasturing, and absence of a sewerage system on the
   farm and cattle breed. Our study demonstrates that sarcosporidiosis may
   constitute a public health problem in Italy and indicates several issues
   to be addressed when planning surveillance and prevention actions. The
   applied diagnostic approach revealed that cattle can harbor a further
   type of Sarcocystis, of which life cycle and zoonotic potential should
   be investigated.},

Abstract = {In April 2009, a novel H1N1 influenza A virus (pH1N1) was recognized as
   the cause of the flu pandemic in humans. Here, we report the isolation
   of pH1N1 virus from the lung homogenates of two cats, which died after
   severe respiratory symptoms. The cats belonged to a cat colony
   consisting of 90 caged cats and were found dead following a 2-week
   period of respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases in the colony.
   During the outbreak, 25 cats died and 50\% of the animal colony showed
   anorexia, depression, respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms.
   Histological examination of the lungs of the two tested cats displayed
   lesions centred on terminal airways with epithelial bronchiolar
   hyperplasia and alveolar necrosis. Influenza A virus was detected in the
   lung tissues by immunohistochemistry and real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR).
   Partial sequences of haemagglutinin (HA) genes and complete sequences of
   neuraminidase (NA) genes of the two isolates displayed high similarity
   to the pH1N1 viruses circulating in humans (99\% for HA gene and 100\%
   for NA gene). To determine whether the pandemic virus had circulated
   among cats, serum samples and pharyngeal swabs were collected from 38
   cats of the colony. Serum samples were tested by ELISA to detect
   antibodies against pH1N1 nucleoprotein and by
   hemagglutination-inhibition test, while pharyngeal swabs were examined
   by pH1N1 specific rRT-PCR. Twenty-one (55\%) of the tested cats carried
   antibodies against the isolated strain and two swabs were positive for
   the presence of pH1N1 RNA. Our results confirm that the pH1N1 virus was
   able to infect cats and raise the hypothesis of the circulation of the
   virus within the colony being due to cat-to-cat transmission. The case
   reported here provides, to the best of the authors knowledge, the first
   description of the pH1N1 infection involving numerous cats that lived in
   a restricted area with limited contact with humans.},

Abstract = {In order to investigate the genetic heterogeneity of small ruminant
   lentivirus (SRLV) isolates in Italy, 55 clinical samples collected
   between 1998 and 2010 were analysed. The phylogenetic study was based on
   analysis of gag-pol sequences. Our findings revealed that the SRLVs
   belonged to the subtype A9 (n = 3, sheep), B1 (n = 5, goat), B2 (n = 3,
   sheep) and E2 (n = 5, goat). Interestingly, 39 isolates from both sheep
   and goat, significantly differed from all the other SRLVs previously
   described and formed two separate clusters within genotypes A and B
   tentatively named A11 (n = 27, goat and sheep) and B3 (n = 12, goat and
   sheep), which have never been shown before. These results revealed a
   marked diversity among Italian field SRLV strains which might reflect
   the absence of any systematic control measures.},

Abstract = {The first epidemiological survey of Border disease virus (BDV) was
   undertaken in small ruminants in Japan. Ovine sera, collected from the
   northern prefectures of Hokkaido. Aomori and Iwate, were examined for
   the presence of antibodies against BDV using the neutralization
   peroxidase-linked antibody test. Twenty-nine (17.6\%) of one hundred and
   sixty-five samples were seropositive for BDV. Results were specific,
   excluding cross-reactions with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). Only
   one sample (0.6\%) was positive for BVDV, and was negative for BDV.
   Despite serological evidence of virus circulation, there have been no
   clinical cases of border disease in sheep in Japan. Although no
   diagnostic measures were performed, the infection did not appear to be
   associated with a reduction in ewe fertility nor with lamb mortality.},

Abstract = {A method to assess the expansion of antigen-specific intracellular
   IFN-gamma positive T cell subsets during the infection will be helpful
   for a better understanding of mycoplasmal infections physiopathology in
   the sheep. We analysed the percentage of antigen-specific lymphocytes
   positive for intracellular IFN-gamma during the infection of sheep with
   Myoplasma agalactiae by culturing peripheral blood mononuclear cells of
   infected or uninfected animals with irradiated M. agalactiae. The
   expansion of antigen-specific IFN-gamma positive lymphocytes in infected
   sheep was initially sustained by CD+, T cells at day 15 after infection,
   when antigen specific IgG start to be detectable, followed by
   CD8/IFN-gamma double positive cells, gamma delta T-cells were not
   expanded at any time point analysed. IFN gamma(+) T cells disappear 60
   days after infection, suggesting that antigen specific IFN gamma(+) T
   cells, mainly detected in the early phase of the disease, could be
   useful to understand the role of cell-mediated immunity during M.
   agalactiae infection. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {By screening rabbits with enterocolitis or enteritis complex and
   asymptomatic rabbits, we identified a novel astrovirus. The virus was
   distantly related (19.3\%-23.7\% aa identity) in the capsid precursor to
   other mammalian astroviruses within the Mamastrovirus genus. By using
   real-time reverse transcription PCR, with specific primers and probes
   and targeting a conserved stretch in open reading frame 1b, we found
   rabbit astrovirus in 10 (43\%) of 23 samples from animals with enteric
   disease and in 25 (18\%) of 139 samples from asymptomatic animals in
   Italy during 2005-2008. The mean and median titers in the positive
   animals were 10(2)x and 10(3)x greater, respectively, in the symptomatic
   animals than in the asymptomatic animals. These findings support the
   idea that rabbit astroviruses should be included in the diagnostic
   algorithm of rabbit enteric disease and animal experiments to increase
   informal:ion obtained about their epidemiology and potential pathogenic
   role.},

Abstract = {The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) requested an
   International Standard anti-Brucella melitensis Serum (ISaBmS) to
   standardise diagnostic tests and reagents for sheep and goats. The
   agreed criteria were the highest dilution (in negative serum) of the
   standard which must give a positive result and the lowest dilution (in
   negative serum) which must simultaneously give a negative result. The
   two dilutions for each assay were, respectively: indirect enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (iELISA) 1/64 and 1/750, competitive ELISA (cELISA)
   1/8 and 1/300, fluorescent polarisation assay (FPA) 1/16 and 1/200, Rose
   Bengal test (RBT) 1/16 and 1/200. The OIE International Standard Serum
   (OIEISS) will remain the primary standard for the RBT; the ISaBmS is an
   additional standard. It was impossible to set criteria for the
   complement fixation test, therefore the OIEISS will remain the primary
   standard. The ISaBmS can be used to standardise iELISA, cELISA and FPA
   to diagnose sheep and goat brucellosis. This standard should facilitate
   harmonisation of tests used for brucellosis surveillance and
   international trade in these species.},

Abstract = {Bluetongue virus (BTV) is the causative agent of a major disease of
   livestock (bluetongue). For over two decades, it has been widely
   accepted that the 10 segments of the dsRNA genome of BTV encode for 7
   structural and 3 non-structural proteins. The non-structural proteins
   (NS1, NS2, NS3/NS3a) play different key roles during the viral
   replication cycle. In this study we show that BTV expresses a fourth
   non-structural protein (that we designated NS4) encoded by an open
   reading frame in segment 9 overlapping the open reading frame encoding
   VP6. NS4 is 77-79 amino acid residues in length and highly conserved
   among several BTV serotypes/strains. NS4 was expressed early
   post-infection and localized in the nucleoli of BTV infected cells. By
   reverse genetics, we showed that NS4 is dispensable for BTV replication
   in vitro, both in mammalian and insect cells, and does not affect viral
   virulence in murine models of bluetongue infection. Interestingly, NS4
   conferred a replication advantage to BTV-8, but not to BTV-1, in cells
   in an interferon (IFN)-induced antiviral state. However, the BTV-1 NS4
   conferred a replication advantage both to a BTV-8 reassortant containing
   the entire segment 9 of BTV-1 and to a BTV-8 mutant with the NS4
   identical to the homologous BTV-1 protein. Collectively, this study
   suggests that NS4 plays an important role in virus-host interaction and
   is one of the mechanisms played, at least by BTV-8, to counteract the
   antiviral response of the host. In addition, the distinct nucleolar
   localization of NS4, being expressed by a virus that replicates
   exclusively in the cytoplasm, offers new avenues to investigate the
   multiple roles played by the nucleolus in the biology of the cell.},

Abstract = {A real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the rapid
   detection of African swine fever virus (ASFV), multiplexed for
   simultaneous detection of swine beta-actin as an endogenous control, has
   been developed and validated by four National Reference Laboratories of
   the European Union for African swine fever (ASF) including the European
   Union Reference Laboratory. Primers and a TaqMan (R) probe specific for
   ASFV were selected from conserved regions of the p72 gene. The limit of
   detection of the new real-time PCR assay is 5.7-57 copies of the ASFV
   genome. High accuracy, reproducibility and robustness of the PCR assay
   (CV ranging from 0.7 to 5.4\%) were demonstrated both within and between
   laboratories using different real-time PCR equipments. The specificity
   of virus detection was validated using a panel of 44 isolates collected
   over many years in various geographical locations in Europe, Africa and
   America, including recent isolates from the Caucasus region, Sardinia,
   East and West Africa. Compared to the OIE-prescribed conventional and
   real-time PCR assays, the sensitivity of the new assay with internal
   control was improved, as demonstrated by testing 281 field samples
   collected in recent outbreaks and surveillance areas in Europe and
   Africa (170 samples) together with samples obtained through experimental
   infections (111 samples). This is particularly evident in the early days
   following experimental infection and during the course of the disease in
   pigs sub-clinically infected with strains of low virulence (from 35 up
   to 70 dpi). The specificity of the assay was also confirmed on 150
   samples from uninfected pigs and wild boar from ASF-free areas. Measured
   on the total of 431 tested samples, the positive deviation of the new
   assay reaches 21\% or 26\% compared to PCR and real-time PCR methods
   recommended by OIE.
   This improved and rigorously validated real-time PCR assay with internal
   control will provide a rapid, sensitive and reliable molecular tool for
   ASFV detection in pigs in newly infected areas, control in endemic areas
   and surveillance in ASF-free areas. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The present work was carried out to evaluate the effect of two salting
   technologies {[}dry salting (DS) and the combined dry-brine salting
   (DBS)] on the chemico-physical and microbiological characteristics of
   PDO Pecorino Siciliano cheeses of different final weight (6 and 12 kg).
   Dry matter was significantly influenced by both salting process and
   final size. Twelve kilogram cheeses treated by DBS showed higher protein
   content with higher soluble nitrogen per cent than 6 kg cheeses. Salt
   content was in the range 3.1-4.0\% on dry matter. The colour did not
   show significant differences for any of the factors, but 12 kg cheeses
   subjected to DS showed higher yellow index than the other cheeses. The
   resistance at 30\% of strain was influenced by cheese size, with 6 kg
   cheeses showing higher resistances than 12 kg cheeses. All cheeses were
   dominated by coccus LAB, but pseudomonads and Enterobacteriaceae showed
   comparable levels of about 10(5) cfu/g. Significant microbiological
   differences were evidenced only for enterococci and yeasts concerning
   the final cheese size. Thirteen species of LAB, belonging to five genera
   (Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Pediococcus and
   Streptococcus), were identified, but several spoilage/pathogenic species
   were also identified, especially Pseudomonas putida, Citrobacter
   freundii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. LAB isolates were preliminary
   evaluated for their physiological characteristics in view of developing
   autochthonous starters to improve the microbiological quality of PDO
   Pecorino Siciliano cheese.},

Title = {Evidence for differing evolutionary dynamics of A/H5N1 viruses among
   countries applying or not applying avian influenza vaccination in
   poultry},

Month = {NOV 21},
Abstract = {Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 (clade 2.2) was introduced
   into Egypt in early 2006. Despite the control measures taken, including
   mass vaccination of poultry, the virus rapidly spread among commercial
   and backyard flocks. Since the initial outbreaks, the virus in Egypt has
   evolved into a third order clade (clade 2.2.1) and diverged into
   antigenically and genetically distinct subclades. To better understand
   the dynamics of HPAI H5N1 evolution in countries that differ in
   vaccination policy, we undertook an in-depth analysis of those virus
   strains circulating in Egypt between 2006 and 2010, and compared
   countries where vaccination was adopted (Egypt and Indonesia) to those
   where it was not (Nigeria, Turkey and Thailand). This study incorporated
   751 sequences (Egypt n = 309, Indonesia n = 149. Nigeria n = 106, Turkey
   n = 87, Thailand n = 100) of the complete haemagglutinin (HA) open
   reading frame, the major antigenic determinant of influenza A virus. Our
   analysis revealed that two main Egyptian subclades (termed A and B) have
   co-circulated in domestic poultry since late 2007 and exhibit different
   profiles of positively selected codons and rates of nucleotide
   substitution. The mean evolutionary rate of subclade A H5N1 viruses was
   4.07 x 10(-3) nucleotide substitutions per site, per year (HPD 95\%,
   3.23-4.91), whereas subclade B possessed a markedly higher substitution
   rate (8.87 x 10(-3); 95\% HPD 7.0-10.72 x 10(-3)) and a stronger
   signature of positive selection. Although the direct association between
   H5N1 vaccination and virus evolution is difficult to establish, we found
   evidence for a difference in the evolutionary dynamics of H5N1 viruses
   among countries where vaccination was or was not adopted. In particular,
   both evolutionary rates and the number of positively selected sites were
   higher in virus populations circulating in countries applying avian
   influenza vaccination for H5N1, compared to viruses circulating in
   countries which had never used vaccination. We therefore urge a greater
   consideration of the potential consequences of inadequate vaccination on
   viral evolution. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive
   chemotherapy-resistant cancer. Up-regulation of epidermal growth factor
   receptor (EGFR) plays an important role in MPM development and
   EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) may represent novel therapeutic
   options. We tested the effects of the EGFR TKIs gefitinib and erlotinib
   and TKIs targeted to other growth factors (VEGFR and PDGFR), in
   comparison to standard antineoplastic agents, in two human MPM cell
   lines, IST-Mes2 and ZL55. All drugs showed IC50 values in the micromolar
   range: TKIs induced cytostatic effects at concentrations up to the IC50,
   while conventional drug growth-inhibitory activity was mainly cytotoxic.
   Moreover, the treatment of IST-Mes2 with TKIs (gefitinib and imatinib
   mesylate) in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine did not show
   additivity. Focusing on the molecular mechanisms underlying the
   antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of EGFR-TKIs, we observed
   that gefitinib induced the formation and stabilization of inactive EGFR
   homodimers, even in absence of EGF, as demonstrated by EGFR B-max and
   number of sites/cell. The analysis of downstream effectors of EGFR
   signaling demonstrated that EGF-induced proliferation, reverted by
   gefitinib, involved ERK1/2 activation, independently from Akt pathway.
   Gefitinib inhibits MPM cell growth and survival, preventing
   EGF-dependent activation of ERK1/2 pathway by blocking EGFR-TK
   phosphorylation and stabilizing inactive EGFR dimers. Along with the
   molecular definition of TKIs pharmacological efficacy in vitro, these
   results may contribute to delve deep into the promising but still
   controversial role for targeted and conventional drugs in the therapy of
   MPM. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The Non-structural 1 (NS1) protein of avian influenza (AI) viruses is
   important for pathogenicity. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized
   tandem PDZ-ligand (TPL) domain in the extreme carboxy terminus of NS1
   proteins from a subset of globally circulating AI viruses. By using
   protein arrays we have identified several human PDZ-cellular ligands of
   this novel domain, one of which is the RIL protein, a known regulator of
   the cellular tyrosine kinase Src. We found that the AI NS1 proteins bind
   and stimulate human Src tyrosine kinase, through their carboxy terminal
   Src homology type 3-binding (SHB) domain. The physical interaction
   between NS1 and Src and the ability of AI viruses to modulate the
   phosphorylation status of Src during the infection, were found to be
   influenced by the TPL arrangement. These results indicate the potential
   for novel host-pathogen interactions mediated by the TPL and SHB domains
   of AI NS1 protein.},

Abstract = {Aims: This study was performed to investigate the microbiological
   contamination of digestate product (DP) obtained from the anaerobic
   co-digestion of bovine manure and agricultural by-products.
   Methods and results: Microbiological analyses were performed on bovine
   manure, fresh DP, liquid and solid fractions and stored liquid fraction
   of DP. A statistically significant reduction of faecal bacterial
   indicator was found after anaerobic digestion except for enterococci.
   After liquid/solid DP separation, bacteria tend to be concentrated in
   the solid fraction. Storage does not seem to influence the indicator
   parameters, except for enterococci. Escherichia coli O157:H7 and
   Yersinia were not found in any samples analysed. Salmonella was rarely
   detected in DP samples and its derivates, while Listeria monocytogenes
   was encountered in many samples.
   Conclusions: The results obtained indicate that the hygienic quality of
   DP is for almost all microbiological parameters better than that of the
   bovine manure (range of reduction 1.6-3.1 log(10)) and suggest the need
   to identify specific pathogen indicators related to the hygienic
   characteristics of DPs.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: This study highlights that the
   anaerobic co-digestion of bovine manure and agricultural by-products in
   a field-scale biogas plant does not increase human health risk with
   respect to the use of animal manure for agricultural fertilization.},

Abstract = {Bluetongue is a major infectious disease of ruminants that is caused by
   bluetongue virus (BTV). In this study, we analyzed virulence and genetic
   differences of (i) three BTV field strains from Italy maintained at
   either a low (L strains) or high (H strains) passage number in cell
   culture and (ii) three South African ``reference{''} wild-type strains
   and their corresponding live attenuated vaccine strains. The Italian BTV
   L strains, in general, were lethal for both newborn NIH-Swiss mice
   inoculated intracerebrally and adult type I interferon
   receptor-deficient (IFNAR(-/-)) mice, while the virulence of the H
   strains was attenuated significantly in both experimental models.
   Similarly, the South African vaccine strains were not pathogenic for
   IFNAR(-/-) mice, while the corresponding wild-type strains were
   virulent. Thus, attenuation of the virulence of the BTV strains used in
   this study is not mediated by the presence of an intact interferon
   system. No clear distinction in virulence was observed for the South
   African BTV strains in newborn NIH-Swiss mice. Full genomic sequencing
   revealed relatively few amino acid substitutions, scattered in several
   different viral proteins, for the strains found to be attenuated in mice
   compared to the pathogenic related strains. However, only the genome
   segments encoding VP1, VP2, and NS2 consistently showed nonsynonymous
   changes between all virulent and attenuated strain pairs. This study
   established an experimental platform for investigating the determinants
   of BTV virulence. Future studies using reverse genetics will allow
   researchers to precisely map and ``weight{''} the relative influences of
   the various genome segments and viral proteins on BTV virulence.},

   injures among herdmates. In Europe, the practice is regulated by law but
   little is known about the methods applied or about farmers' attitude to
   the practice. This study aimed to broaden the existing information on
   dehorning in dairy holdings by processing results of 639 farm
   questionnaires gathered in a traditional dairy area of northeastern
   Italy. Farm questionnaires were stratified according to herd size, type
   of housing, and productive purpose of the predominant reared breed(s).
   Chi-squared tests were performed to verify the significant association
   between a given practice or opinion and the 3 classification factors,
   and odd ratios were calculated. The outcomes of the study showed that
   dehorning was carried out on 80\% of the surveyed farms, and disbudding
   was the method reported by all the interviewed farmers. Hotiron
   cauterization was the preferred method for disbudding (91\%). On
   average, disbudding was performed at 32 d of age and it was more likely
   in farms with >= 60 cows than in smaller dairy holdings (OR = 7.3). The
   practice was carried out mainly by farm personnel, but the intervention
   of a veterinarian was far more likely (OR = 5.98) on farms with <= 30
   cows than on larger dairies. Most farmers (70\%) stated that they had
   not received any specific training on how to perform disbudding.
   Fifty-two percent of the respondents reported that disbudding causes
   prolonged postoperative pain (>= 6 h) but pain management was rare. Only
   10\% of the farmers used local anesthesia before cauterization, and 5\%
   of the farmers provided calves with postoperative analgesia. Consistent
   with these results, farmers indicated limited willingness to pay the
   cost of analgesia or to call a veterinarian to perform the procedure.
   This low motivation of the respondents toward the adoption of practices
   able to reduce pain related to disbudding might arise from their
   insufficient knowledge on long-term negative effects of early painful
   experiences on behavior and handling of dairy heifers. Farmers in favor
   of keeping horned cows were asked about the reasons for not carrying out
   dehorning. Aesthetic motivations (54\% of respondents) and lack of time
   (24\%) were the main reasons cited. Moreover, a large majority of these
   respondents (74\%) reported no difficulty in handling horned cattle.},

Abstract = {The present study aimed to identify ticks collected from road-killed
   wildlife species retrieved in several localities of southern Italy and
   to assess the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Anaplasma
   phagocytophilum and Rickettsia spp. DNA in ticks. Collections were
   carried out from January 2000 to December 2009 on wild animals found
   dead within the territories of 11 municipalities from three regions
   (i.e., Apulia, Basilicata, and Calabria). In total, 189 carcasses of
   wild animals belonging to 10 species were checked for tick infestation,
   and 40 animals belonging to seven species were found parasitized. One
   hundred and twenty-five ixodid ticks (11 larvae, 14 nymphs, 77 males,
   and 23 females) were collected and identified as belonging to nine
   species, namely Dermacentor marginatus, Haemaphysalis erinacei, Hyalomma
   marginatum, Ixodes acuminatus, Ixodes canisuga, Ixodes hexagonus, Ixodes
   ricinus, Rhipicephalus bursa, and Rhipicephalus turanicus. None of the
   36 tick specimens tested by PCR was positive for tick-borne pathogens.
   The results add new information on the tick fauna associated with wild
   animals in Italy, reporting new tick-host associations. Further field
   studies are still needed to ascertain the suitability of certain
   wildlife species as hosts for some tick species, particularly for those
   implicated in the transmission of pathogens to domestic animals and
   humans. Finally, from a conservation perspective, it would be
   interesting to assess whether these wild animals (e.g., Lepus
   corsicanus) are exposed to tick-borne pathogens, investigating the
   possible implications for their health and behavior.},

Abstract = {Objectives: To compare fecal excretion of Salmonella in sows of
   different parities and stages of reproduction.
   Materials and methods: A total of 166 sows at two farrow-to-finish farms
   in Italy were tested for Salmonella shedding at four stages of
   reproduction. Sows were divided into three groups: primiparous (farrowed
   one litter), pluriparous (two to five litters), and old sows (> 5
   litters). Fecal samples were collected approximately 2 weeks before
   parturition (Late Gestation), 1 and 3 weeks after parturition
   (Postpartum One and Two), and 30 to 60 days postpartum (Postweaning).
   Environmental samples were collected from farrowing rooms, farrowing
   crates, and gestation pens before placement of sows.
   Results: The prevalence of Salmonella was 0.6 \% in Late Gestation,
   1.9\% in Postpartum One, 4.3\% in Postpartum Two, and 26.5\% in
   Postweaning, and 33.3\% in primiparous, 28.8\% in pluriparous, and 4.6\%
   in old sows. Salmonella was isolated from environmental samples in
   farrowing rooms (8\%) and gestation pens (23\%). Salmonella serovar
   Muenchen and Salmonella serovar Typhimurium were isolated both from sows
   and environmental samples on Farm One, while on Farm Two, Salmonella
   serovar Choleraesuis and Salmonella enterica serovar 4,5,12:i- were
   identified in fecal samples, and Salmonella serovar 4,5,12:i- and S
   Typhimurium var Copenhagen were recovered from environmental samples.
   Implications: Young sows are more likely to shed Salmonella than older
   animals. The postweaning period is the high-risk period for excretion of
   Salmonella. Environmental contamination and poor hygiene may play a role
   in the higher Salmonella risk in weaned sows.},

Abstract = {The increasing awareness of animal welfare in public and science induces
   a need for objective evaluation. Particularly animal welfare during
   transport is discussed due to the variable transport conditions in
   Europe. Therefore an objective evaluation of animal transport is
   relevant and the first attempts to develop animal welfare risk
   assessment guidelines for animal transport are made. A report of the
   development of a guideline on animal welfare risk assessment during
   animal transport (Dalla Villa et al., 2009) bases on other recent
   reports and guidelines of animal welfare risk assessment published by
   EFSA (2009) and adapts the method to animal transport condition. For the
   implementation of a model for quantitative risk assessment, transport
   conditions were defined to develop multiple scenarios. Hazard
   identification was prepared for each scenario and for three selected
   scenarios a complete risk assessment was performed. Within the exemplary
   risk assessment potential hazards were initially identified and
   furthermore hazard description and exposure assessment were evaluated by
   expert opinion which resulted in risk characterisation. Within risk
   characterisation of each hazard, magnitude and risk estimate were
   calculated to afford an individual ranking of these values in order to
   obtain a graphical illustration of the ten highest estimated risks. (C)

Abstract = {In recent years, West Nile virus (WNV) has re-emerged in the Western
   Mediterranean region. As a result, the number of complete WNV genome
   sequences available from this region has increased, allowing more
   detailed phylogenetic analyses, which may help to understand the
   evolutionary history of WNV circulating in the Western Mediterranean. To
   this aim, the present work describes six new complete WNV sequences from
   recent outbreaks and surveillance in Italy in 2008-2009 and in Spain in
   2008 and 2010. Comparison with other sequences from different WNV
   clusters within lineage 1 (clade 1a) confirmed that all Western
   Mediterranean WNV isolates obtained since 1996 (except one from Tunisia,
   collected in 1997) cluster in a single monophyletic group (here called
   `WMed' subtype). The analysis differentiated two subgroups within this
   subtype, which appear to have evolved from earlier WMed strains,
   suggesting a single introduction in the area, and further dissemination
   and evolution. Close similarities between WNV variants circulating in
   consecutive years, one in Spain, between 2007 and 2008, and another in
   Italy between 2008 and 2009, suggest that the virus possibly overwinters
   in Western Mediterranean sites. The NS3(249)-proline genotype, recently
   proposed as a virulence determinant for WNV, has arisen independently at
   least twice in the area. Overall, these results indicate that the
   frequent recurrence of outbreaks caused by phylogenetically homogeneous
   WNV in the Western Mediterranean since 1996 is consistent with a single
   introduction followed by viral persistence in endemic foci in the area,
   rather than resulting from independent introductions from exogenous
   endemic foci.},

Abstract = {Olfactory memory dysfunctions were investigated in the triple-transgenic
   murine model of Alzheimer's disease (3x Tg-AD). In the social
   transmission of food preference test, 3x Tg-AD mice presented severe
   deficits in odor-based memory, without gross changes in general
   odor-ability. A beta and tau immunoreactivity was not observed in the
   primary processing regions for odor, the olfactory bulbs (OBs), whereas
   marked immunostaining was present in the piriform, entorhinal, and
   orbitofrontal cortex, as well as in the hippocampus. Our results suggest
   that the impairment in olfactory-based information processing might
   arise from degenerative mechanisms mostly affecting higher cortical
   regions and limbic areas, such as the hippocampus. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Title = {Transmission Dynamics of Low Pathogenicity Avian Influenza Infections in
   Turkey Flocks},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 26},
Abstract = {Low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses of H5 and H7 subtypes
   have the potential to mutate into highly pathogenic strains (HPAI),
   which can threaten human health and cause huge economic losses. The
   current knowledge on the mechanisms of mutation from LPAI to HPAI is
   insufficient for predicting which H5 or H7 strains will mutate into an
   HPAI strain, and since the molecular changes necessary for the change in
   virulence seemingly occur at random, the probability of mutation depends
   on the number of virus replicates, which is associated with the number
   of birds that acquire infection. We estimated the transmission dynamics
   of LPAI viruses in turkeys using serosurveillance data from past
   epidemics in Italy. We fitted the proportions of birds infected in 36
   flocks into a hierarchical model to estimate the basic reproduction
   number (R-0) and possible variations in R0 among flocks caused by
   differences among farms. We also estimated the distributions of the
   latent and infectious periods, using experimental infection data with
   outbreak strains. These were then combined with the R0 to simulate LPAI
   outbreaks and characterise the resulting dynamics. The estimated mean
   within-flock R0 in the population of infected flocks was 5.5, indicating
   that an infectious bird would infect an average of more than five
   susceptible birds. The results also indicate that the presence of
   seropositive birds does not necessarily mean that the virus has already
   been cleared and the flock is no longer infective, so that seropositive
   flocks may still constitute a risk of infection for other flocks. In
   light of these results, the enforcement of appropriate restrictions, the
   culling of seropositive flocks, or pre-emptive slaughtering may be
   useful. The model and parameter estimates presented in this paper
   provide the first complete picture of LPAI dynamics in turkey flocks and
   could be used for designing a suitable surveillance program.},

Journal = {FOOD CHEMISTRY},

Abstract = {In recent years carbon monoxide (CO) has been employed by the fishery
   industry to preserve the fresh appearance of fish products during frozen
   storage, particularly in vacuum packaged products. CO reacts with
   oxy-myoglobin to form a stable cherry coloured carboxy-myoglobin
   complex. We propose a method that allows the quantitative determination
   of CO in the meat drip of tuna fish by UV-Vis spectroscopy. It consists
   of: (i) preparations of CO secondary standard solutions titrated against
   horse heart Mb primary standard solutions; (ii) determination of
   calibration curves to measure CO concentration in treated and untreated
   samples. The accuracy of the spectrophotometric method has been
   evaluated in terms of trueness and precision by using fortified tuna
   fish samples. The spectroscopic results have been compared with those
   obtained using a head space gas chromatographic technique (HS-GC-MS).
   The CO levels measured in tuna fish samples by UV-Vis are substantially
   lower than those revealed by HS-GC-MS. The origin of this discrepancy is
   discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A study was carried out on the presence of Anisakis and Hysterothylacium
   larvae in fish and cephalopods caught in Sardinian waters. A total of
   369 specimens of 24 different species of teleosts and 5 species of
   cephalopods were collected from different fishing areas of Sardinia.
   Larvae were detected and isolated by both visual inspection and
   enzymatic digestion. These methods allowed Anisakis type I and type II
   third-stage larvae and Hysterothylacium third- and fourth-stage larvae
   to be detected. The prevalence, mean intensity, and mean abundance were
   calculated. The results obtained showed the highest prevalence of
   Anisakidae in Zeus faber (100\%) and of Anisakis in Micromesistius
   poutassou (87.5\%). The highest prevalence of Anisakis type I larvae was
   in M. poutassou (81.2\%), and that of Anisakis type II larvae was in
   Todarodes sagittatus (20\%). The highest values for prevalence, mean
   intensity, and mean abundance for Hysterothylacium were found in Z.
   faber. These prevalences and the mean intensity and abundance were
   higher than those reported by different authors in other Mediterranean
   areas. This may be because the enzymatic digestive method used in this
   research resulted in higher recovery levels. The data suggest that
   Sardinia may be a high-risk area for zoonotic diseases and that measures
   such as information campaigns, aimed at both sanitary service personnel
   and consumers, should be employed to limit the spread of such zoonosis.},

Abstract = {Histophilus somni is able to infect the genital tract of dairy cattle
   and to cause vaginitis, embryonic death and abortion. This paper
   describes two outbreaks characterized by reproductive disorders in dairy
   cattle associated with genital infections caused by H. somni. In the
   first case-report the presence of infectious agents responsible for
   abortion, reproductive failure or vaginal discharge has been
   investigated by means of bacteriological, serological and biomolecular
   techniques. Among the infectious agents investigated a significant
   association (P<0.001) between the positivity for H. somni and reduced
   fertility was observed, with higher prevalence of vaginal discharge and
   poor conception rate among infected animals.
   The second case-report describes the effectiveness of the therapeutic
   approach adopted by the veterinary, based on the execution of vaginal
   washings with an antibiotic solution containing gentamicin, lincomycin
   and spectinomycin, in cows with a muco-purulent vaginal discharge and
   the worsening of the reproductive performance due to H. somni
   infections.
   These results suggest to consider H. somni as a possible cause of
   reproductive failures in dairy cattle.},

Abstract = {The study aimed at comparing three strategies of supplementing selenium
   (Se) during the finishing period of Charolais young bulls: (1)
   administration of sodium selenite throughout the finishing (NaSe); (2)
   administration of an Se-enriched yeast strain (Saccharomyces cerevisiae
   NCYC R397) throughout the finishing (Se-Y); (3) administration of sodium
   selenite for 140 days replaced by Se-enriched yeast during the last 70
   days of finishing (Switch). Eighty-four young bulls (mean initial BW =
   434.2 +/- 31.9 kg; mean age = 382 +/- 52 days) were stratified by live
   weight and equally assigned to one of three Se treatments. Experimental
   groups were fed the same diets and the inclusion rate of the different
   treatments was targeted to achieve 0.3 mg of Se/kg of dry matter (DM) in
   the complete feed. The average daily gain of bulls was 1.36 kg/d and no
   differences due to Se treatment were recorded. Dry matter intake and
   feed conversion ratio were not affected by Se treatment resulting in, on
   average, 10.3 kg/d and 7.65, respectively. Repeated blood samples were
   taken at days 0, 120, 180 and 210 of finishing to assess the Se status
   of the animals. As compared to NaSe, both organic Se treatments (Se-Y
   and Switch) increased plasma Se in the last two sampling sessions
   according to a significant treatment X time interaction (P < 0.001). A
   similar trend was observed for serum total antioxidant status of the
   young bulls, whereas there was only a significant time effect (P <
   0.001) on glutathione peroxidase activity that was raised by all Se
   treatments. The finishing period lasted 210 days and at the abattoir
   there were no differences across Se treatments in carcass weight and
   dressing percentage. A higher Se content in the Longissimus thoracis
   (LT) muscle was instead observed in Se-Y samples as compared with NaSe
   (0.85 v. 0.47mg/kg DM; P < 0.05). Meat quality evaluation was carried
   out on LT samples after 6 and 11 days of ageing under a vacuum package.
   Regardless of ageing time, meat from young bulls supplemented with Se
   yeast had higher colour lightness (L{*}) values than those receiving
   NaSe (38.1 v. 36.6; P < 0.01) and showed a significant decrease in shear
   force (3.69 v. 4.22 kg/cm(2); P < 0.01). The outcomes of the study
   suggest that the provision of Se yeast throughout the finishing period
   is a strategy to increase the benefits of the replacement of sodium
   selenite with organic selenium in beef cattle.},

Abstract = {Astroviruses are small, non-enveloped, positive sense, single-stranded
   RNA viruses first identified in 1975 in children suffering from diarrhea
   and then described in a wide variety of animals. To date, the list of
   animal species susceptible to astrovirus infection has expanded to 22
   animal species or families, including domestic, synantropic and wild
   animals, avian, and mammalian species in the terrestrial and aquatic
   environments. Astrovirus infections are considered among the most common
   cause of gastroenteritis in children, second only to rotavirus
   infections, but in animals their association with enteric diseases is
   not well documented, with the exception of turkey and mink astrovirus
   infection. Genetic variability has been described in almost all
   astrovirus species sufficiently examined infecting mammals and birds;
   however, antigenic variability has been demonstrated for human
   astroviruses but is far less investigated in animal viruses.
   Interestingly, there is an increasing evidence of recombination events
   occurring in astroviruses, which contributes to increase the genetic
   variability of this group of viruses. A wide variety of species
   infected, the evident virus genetic diversity and the occurrence of
   recombination events indicate or imply either cross-species transmission
   and subsequent virus adaptation to new hosts or the co-infection of the
   same host with different astroviruses. This can also favor the emergence
   of novel astroviruses infecting animals or with a zoonotic potential.
   After more than 30 years from their first description in humans, there
   are many exciting streams of research to be explored and intriguing
   questions that remain to be answered about the relatively under-studied
   Astroviridae family. In the present work, we will review the existing
   knowledge concerning astrovirus infections in humans and animals, with
   particular focus on the molecular biology, interspecies transmission and
   zoonotic potential of this group of viruses. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Four groups of BTV free Frisian and cross bred calves were used to
   determine the length of viraemia following infection with different
   doses of BTV-8 Italian isolate. The first group of five animals was
   infected with 10 TCID50 of BTV-8, the second group of four animals with
   10(3) TCID50 and the third group, which also included four animals, was
   infected with 10(6) TCID50. A placebo containing uninfected tissue
   culture medium was given to the four animals of the fourth group. The
   viraemia was evaluated by real time RTPCR and virus isolation. In all
   infected groups, virus isolation was able to detect infectious virus up
   to 39 days post infection (dpi) while RT-PCR was positive up to 151-157
   dpi. Infectious dose did influence neither the length nor the pattern of
   BTV-8 viraemia and confirmed that real time RT-PCR remains positive
   although no circulating virus is detectable in the peripheral
   circulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A new quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay based on Taqman (R)
   technology and minor groove binding (MGB) probe was developed for the
   diagnosis of leishmaniosis and quantification of Leishmania infantum DNA
   in infected dogs. This method was based on the amplification of a 122 bp
   fragment of the highly conserved kDNA minicircles of L infantum. The
   reaction was performed using the SteponePlus (TM) system with StepOne
   software (TM). This assay was able to detect the presence of protozoan
   parasite DNA in amounts as low as 0.03 parasites per reaction. The
   standard curve designed for the quantification of parasites showed
   linearity over seven log DNA concentration range with a correlation
   coefficient >0.999 and both intra and inter-assay variability
   demonstrated the high efficiency and reproducibility of the assay. The
   qPCR also proved to be successfully applicable to different clinical
   samples including blood, bone marrow, lymph node aspirates and
   conjunctival swabs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Ovine sera collected from the northern Prefectures of Hokkaido, Iwate
   and Aomori in Japan, were examined for the presence of antibodies
   against visna-maedi virus using the agar gel immunodiffusion test and
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Three animals (1.12\%), out of 267
   samples tested, were found to be seropositive to the visna-maedi
   antigens in both tests. Levels of infection were found in flocks from
   Hokkaido and Iwate Prefectures, but not in the Aomori Prefecture.
   Nucleic acid detection by polymerase chain reaction on serum samples did
   not give positive results. Although no diagnostic measures were in
   place, the infection could not be related to losses in sheep production
   or to reduced survival rates. The very limited visna-maedi distribution
   indicates a highly favourable condition for the application of
   eradication strategies in this area.},

Abstract = {An outbreak of bovine besnoitiosis in three female, 15-18 months old
   beef cattle in central Italy is here described. All the animals were
   born in central Italy without any recent contact with imported animals.
   The animals were in poor body conditions and showed symptoms and
   clinical signs consistent with chronic besnoitiosis. The diagnosis was
   confirmed by histopathologic examinations of skin biopsies and whole
   body at necropsy, showing typical 50-100 mu cysts engulfing superficial
   dermis in skin and lamina propria in mucosae; lesions were confined to
   skin and respiratory mucosae, and cysts were not seen in any other
   tissue. Bovine besnoitiosis is rapidly spreading among European
   countries and in our case the affected animals were born in the farm and
   not recent admission was referred, so it is likely to consider this as
   an autoctone outbreak of the disease in Italy. This case, taken together
   with other recently reported ones, suggest to consider Italy among
   potentially endemic areas for bovine besnoitiosis.},

Abstract = {Anisakis spp. larvae arc parasitic, and potentially zoonotic, nematodes
   transmitted by marine fish and cephalopods, which are the main
   intermediate hosts of the third larval stage. The accidental consumption
   of infected raw or poorly cooked fish may cause gastroenteric diseases
   and allergies in humans. The aim of the present study was to use
   polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism
   (PCR-RFLP) to define the occurrence, species variability, and host
   preferences of Anisakis spp. larvae in fish caught off the coast of
   Sardinia. Necropsy was used on 285 samples; 552 Anisakis spp. L3 larvae
   were isolated from 87 fish that tested positive for this nematode.
   Anisakis pegreffii was most frequently encountered (90.6\%), with a
   primary preference for Scomber scombrus, Zeus faber, and Trachurus
   mediterraneus. In contrast, the prevalence of Anisakis physeteris was
   only 1.3\%. A hybrid genotype of Anisakis simplex sensu stricto and
   Anisakis pegreffii was also observed, which confirms the results of
   previous studies carried out in the western Mediterranean.
   Interestingly, no Anisakis simplex s.s. larvae were recovered. These
   results indicate that the diversity of Anisakis species is low in
   Sardinia waters, probably because of its geographic position.},

Abstract = {For the second consecutive year a West Nile disease (WND) epidemic has
   affected Italy causing disease in horses and humans. The infection
   re-occurred in the same places of the 2008 and moved westerly and
   southerly involving new areas and regions. The whole genome sequence of
   the Italian 2009 West Nile disease isolate (WNDV) was compared with
   those responsible for the 2008 WND outbreaks. The epidemiological
   findings of the two years of epidemic were compared as well. The high
   identity between 2008 and 2009 WNV strains (>99\%), the earlier virus
   circulation in 2009 and the re-occurrence of the disease starting from
   the bordering infected areas reached by the infection in the previous
   year, strongly support the hypothesis of the overwintering of the virus
   and the endemisation to local host populations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Wild boar represents one of the most common and widespread wildlife and
   wild game species in Umbria region. Aim of work was to investigate the
   parasitofauna of wild boars living in Umbria analyzing the faecal
   samples of 123 animals shut down during the hunting season 2009/2010 by
   quali-quantitative coprological examinations. The results of the
   coprological analyses showed that gastro-intestinal strongyles (73.98\%)
   and coccidia (33.33\%) represented the predominant parasites and the
   most common parasitic association recovered. Moreover the statistical
   analysis revealed a significant correlation between the coccidia
   infection rate and the animal age (p<0.05). Copropositivity for further
   parasites including lungworms (8.94\%), acanthocephalans (6.55\%),
   Trichuris suis (4.88\%), Capillaria spp. (2.44\%), Spiruridae (1.63\%),
   Ascaris suum (0.81\%) and Strongyloides ransomi (0.81\%), was also
   detected. The examinations of the whole intestinal tracts and
   respiratory tracts of 16 wild boars allowed to confirm that
   gastro-intestinal strongyles were the most prevalent parasites of the
   wild boar and to identify three different species of gastro-intestinal
   strongyles (Oesophagostomum dentatum, Hyostrongylus rubidus,
   Globocephalus urosubulatus) and two of lungworms (Metastrongylus apri,
   Metastrongylus pudendotectus).},

Title = {High sensitivity of a histological method in the detection of low-dosage

Abstract = {With this study we evaluated the performance of a histological method
   for the detection of microscopic lesions in the sexual accessory glands
   of veal calves administered 17 beta-estradiol valerate for growth
   promotion; our goal was to determine whether the method might hold
   potential as an official screening technique according to the Commission
   Decision 2002/657/EC. The target organs of veal calves treated with
   low-dose 17 beta-estradiol valerate and those of control animals were
   microscopically examined in blinded manner and the histolopathogical
   features scored by two pathologists. Distinct histopathological
   differences were seen in the prostate and the bulbo-urethral glands of
   the treated animals versus the controls. Our findings indicate that,
   compared with the negative results obtained with the official test, this
   histopathological method can identify illicit 17 beta-estradiol valerate
   treatment up to 15 days after the last drug administration.
   Based on the preliminary evidence for the method's high specificity and
   sensitivity, a validation study could be set up according to Decision
   2002/657/EC. Confirmation of its performance could support adoption of
   histopathology as an official screening method in the National Residue
   Monitoring Program for the detection of illicit estrogenic treatment.

Volume = {102},

Abstract = {Paratuberculosis is a chronic granulomatous infection caused by
   Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) that affects multiple
   ruminant species causing important economic losses. Therefore, control
   programmes at herd and regional levels have been established worldwide
   and prevalence estimates are needed for their implementation. Although
   different herd-level prevalence estimations for paratuberculosis have
   been reported in Europe, very few studies provided comparable and
   interpretable values, due to poor study designs and lack of knowledge
   about the accuracy of the diagnostic tests used. To overcome these
   problems we applied a latent class analysis to the results of two
   prevalence studies carried out in two neighbouring Northern Italian
   regions (Lombardy and Veneto) that account for over 50\% of the Italian
   dairy cattle population. Serum samples from a randomly selected number
   of farms in the two regions were analyzed by different ELISA tests. The
   herd-level Apparent Prevalences (AP) were 48\% (190/391) for Lombardy
   and 65\% (272/419) for Veneto. Median within-herd APs were 2.6\% and
   4.0\% for Lombardy and Veneto, respectively. Posterior estimates for the
   herd-level True Prevalences (TP) based on a Bayesian model were very
   similar between the two regions (70\% for Lombardy and 71\% for Veneto)
   and close to previous estimates of infected herds in Europe. The two
   95\% credibility intervals overlap each other, virtually showing only
   one distribution of the herd-level true prevalence for both regions. On
   the contrary, estimates of the within-herd TP distributions differed
   between the two regions (mean values: 6.7\% for Lombardy and 14.3\% for
   Veneto), possibly due to the different age distribution within the herds
   from the two regions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This report describes an outbreak of Mycoplasma bovis mastitis affecting
   45 cows in a herd of 122 dairy cattle in Northern Italy. Clinically, the
   outbreak was characterized by agalactia, multiple swollen and painless
   quarters, high milk somatic cell count and unresponsiveness to
   conventional antibiotic therapy. M. bovis was isolated from the milk
   samples of all the 32 affected cows tested and from the mammary tissue
   of three affected cows that underwent necropsy. No other pathogens were
   isolated from these samples. Lesions in two of the necropsied cows were
   characterized by mild chronic suppurative mastitis and galactophoritis.
   The other necropsied cow showed a chronic necrosuppurative and
   pyogranulamaous galactophoritis, a condition not previously associated
   with M. bovis. M. bovis was detected immunohistochemically in the lumen
   of the affected mammary ducts suggesting that ascending infection via
   the teat canal was the likely route of transmission. No other
   intralesional pathogens were demonstrated microscopically. (C) 2011

Abstract = {A few studies provided convincing evidence of constitutive expression of
   type I interferons (IFNs) in humans and mice, and of the steady-state
   role of these cytokines under health conditions. These results were
   later confirmed in pigs, too. In line with this tenet, low levels of
   IFN-alpha/beta can be detected in swine tissues in the absence of any
   specific inducer. These studies are compounded by the utmost complexity
   of type I IFNs (including among others 17 IFN-alpha genes in pigs),
   which demands proper research tools. This prompted us to analyse the
   available protocols and to develop a relevant, robust, reverse
   transcription (RT) real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection
   system for the amplification of porcine IFN-alpha/beta genes. The
   adopted test procedure is user-friendly and provides the complete panel
   of gene expression of one subject in a microtitre plate. Also, a proper
   use of PCR fluorochromes (SYBR (R) versus EvaGreen (R) supermix) enables
   users to adopt proper test protocols in case of low-expression porcine
   IFN-alpha genes. This is accounted for by the much higher sensitivity of
   the test protocol with EvaGreen (R) supermix. Interestingly, IFN-beta
   showed the highest frequency of constitutive expression, in agreement
   with its definition of `immediate early' gene in both humans and mice.
   Results indicate that the outlined procedure can detect both
   constitutively expressed and virus-induced IFN-alpha/beta genes, as well
   as the impact of environmental, non-infectious stressors on the previous
   profile of constitutive expression.},

Abstract = {Analysis of micro- and minisatellite loci is widely used in sub-typing
   of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis. Microsatellite (short
   sequence repeat, SSR) loci have shown highest discriminatory power, but
   direct sequencing of amplicons is required for correct assignment of the
   repeat number. We developed an alternative method to sequencing,
   focusing on the SSR8 locus (constituted by GGT triplets from three to
   six repeats). The approach is based on asymmetric quantitative PCR,
   followed by high-resolution melting analysis with unlabelled probes
   (UP-HRM). Data showed perfect concordance between direct sequencing and
   UP-HRM, which is faster, simpler and more cost effective.},

   pleuropneumonia (CBPP) are numerous. However, an analysis of the effects
   of the two different routes of infection on disease outcome is lacking.
   This study analyses the disease outcome in cattle infected by the two
   methodologies. Data originate from two controlled trials conducted in
   Namibia under field conditions. Intubation appears to be responsible for
   chronic evolution of the disease while in-contact infected animals
   develop more severe infection inducing mortality. Our results seem to
   suggest that the mode of infection may condition the disease outcome and
   should be taken into consideration in studies on the pathogenesis of
   CBPP.},

Abstract = {Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of Vibrio
   vulnificus and potentially pathogenic strains of Vibrio parahaemolyticus
   in mullets collected from estuarine environment in Italy.
   Methods and Results: Two hundred and ninety-five mullets were analysed
   by culture using the selective medium thiosulfate citrate bile salt
   sucrose agar, during a monitoring period of 2 years (2008-2009).
   Presumptive Vibrio colonies were initially identified by using
   biochemical tests, and strains identified as V. parahaemolyticus and V.
   vulnificus were subsequently examined by PCR for the presence of
   species-specific and virulence genes (toxR, trh, tdh and vvh). V.
   parahaemolyticus was found in 55\% (162/295) of fishes and V. vulnificus
   in 1\% (3/295) with a higher presence in summer months. The trh+/tdh-
   strains were detected in 16\% (47/295) of samples and only one strain
   resulted trh+/tdh+. One of the V. parahaemolyticus trh+ strains isolated
   belonged to the O1:KUT (K untypeable), a serotype recently associated to
   gastroenteritis in Italy.
   Conclusions: This is the first report demonstrating a high percentage of
   potential pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus trh+ strains in estuarine
   fishes of the Mediterranean area.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: These findings indicate the
   potential human health risk associated with the presence of pathogenic
   Vibrio spp. in wild fishes.},

Abstract = {Stunning is a stage of slaughtering which is crucial to minimize any
   direct consequence on animal welfare as well as on meat quality. It is
   necessary for those who work in this field to have an excellent
   knowledge of instruments and procedures, the latter should be always
   applied according to the law. This study provides an overview of
   different stunning techniques used in small ruminants slaughtering
   practices. The impact of each technique on animal welfare and meat
   quality is also described. Nowadays, electronarcosis and captive bolt
   gun are the most used stunning methods for small ruminants. Whatever the
   technique been used, correct practices, regular maintenance of
   instruments and the proportionately of tools to the size of the animal
   are always necessary. In particular, electric stunning parameters such
   as amperage, voltage and duration should be set according to the size
   and the age of the animal. Indeed, a rational organization of the
   slaughterhouse operations is important, mostly in order to avoid delays
   that could increase the stun-stick interval, which is a critical animal
   welfare parameter. Therefore, written procedures, good training of
   operators and systems of own-checks, including assessment and management
   of stunning-related risks, are undoubtedly essential in order to
   correctly perform the stunning procedure.},

   each flock, a cloacal swab from four hens was collected and produced
   1102 E. coli and 792 E. faecalis isolates. Broth microdilution was used
   to test susceptibility to antimicrobials. Country and housing type
   interacted differently with the MDR levels of both species. In the E.
   coli model, housing in a raised-floor system was associated with an
   increased risk of MDR compared to the conventional battery system {[}
   odds ratio (OR) 2.12, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.13-3.97)]. In the
   E. faecalis model the MDR levels were lower in free-range systems than
   in conventional battery cages (OR 0.51, 95\% CI 0.27-0.94). In Belgium,
   ceftiofur-resistant E. coli isolates were more numerous than in the

Title = {Lower extremity traumatic vascular injury at a level II trauma center:
   an analysis of limb loss risk factors and outcomes},

Volume = {66},

Abstract = {Aim. The objectives were to review in our series the risk factors,
   management and outcomes of patients who sustained vascular injuries in
   the lower limbs and to determine the effect of risk factors and
   treatment on the outcome of the injured extremity.
   Methods. Fifty-six patients submitted to surgical treatment were
   retrospectively reviewed. Results were analysed in terms of type of
   operation and reconstruction, intraoperative and 30 day complications,
   reconstruction occlusion, major amputation and mortality.
   Results. The mechanism of trauma was blunt in 30.4\% and penetrating in
   69.6\%. The overall primary amputation rate was 5.4\%, the overall
   secondary amputation rate was 1.8\%. The overall intraoperative and
   postoperative mortality were 1.8\% and 5.4\% respectively. At univariate
   analys is, the presence of compartment syndrome and ischemia time >6
   hours were associated with a significantly higher risk of early
   reconstruction thrombosis (both P=0.03). It showed also that the number
   of patent vessels (P=0.0000) and the presence of a MESS score >7
   (P=0.0000) significantly affected primary amputation, and that the
   occurrence of postoperative deep wound infection or sepsis (P=0.0000),
   of tibio-peroneal trunk injury (P=0.003) and of a MESS score >7
   (P=0.004) significantly affected secondary amputation.
   Conclusion. The number of patent arteries (0-1), the presence of a MESS
   score >7, the incidence of tibio-peroneal trunk injury and the
   occurrence of postoperative deep wound infection are significant
   independent factors for limb loss. The presence of compartment syndrome
   and of ischemia time >6 hours are associated with a significantly higher
   risk of early reconstruction thrombosis.},

Title = {First report in italy of the exotic mosquito species Aedes (Finlaya)
   koreicus, a potential vector of arboviruses and filariae},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {4},
Month = {SEP 28},
Abstract = {Background: In the Veneto region (north-eastern Italy) an entomological
   surveillance system has been implemented since the introduction of the
   Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) in 1991. During the routine
   monitoring activity in a tiger mosquito-free area, an unexpected
   mosquito was noticed, which clearly did not belong to the recorded
   Italian fauna.
   Findings: At the end of May 2011, twelve larvae and pupae were collected
   in a small village in Belluno province (Veneto region) from a single
   manhole. Ten adults reared in the laboratory were morphologically and
   genetically identified as Aedes (Finlaya) koreicus (Edwards, 1917), a
   species native to Southeast Asia. The subsequent investigations carried
   out in the following months in the same village provided evidence that
   this species had become established locally. Entomological and
   epidemiological investigations are currently ongoing in the surrounding
   area, to verify the eventual extension of the species outside the
   village and to trace back the route of entry into Italy.
   Conclusions: This is the first report in Italy of the introduction of
   the exotic mosquito Ae. koreicus. This species has been shown
   experimentally to be competent in the transmission of the Japanese
   encephalitis virus and of the dog heartworm Dirofilaria immitis and is
   considered a potential vector of other arboviruses. Thus, the
   establishment of this species may increase the current risk or pose new
   potential threats, for human and animal health. This finding
   considerably complicates the entomological monitoring of the Asian tiger
   mosquito Ae. albopictus in Italy and stresses the importance of
   implementing the entomological surveillance for the early detection of
   and the rapid response against invasive mosquito species.},

Title = {Effectiveness of combination of Mini-and Microsatellite loci to sub-type
   Mycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis Italian type C isolates},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {7},
Month = {SEP 19},
Abstract = {Background: Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map) is the
   etiological agent of paratuberculosis. The aim of our study was to
   combine Mini-and Microsatellite loci analysis in order to explore the
   effectiveness of this sub-typing method in a group of Map isolates. For
   this purpose, 84 Italian Type C Map isolates, each from a different
   cattle herd, were submitted to MIRU-Variable-Number Tandem-Repeats
   (VNTRs) typing and Short Sequence repeats (SSRs) sequencing. Moreover,
   the method was used to analyse the variability inside 10 herds (from
   three to 50 isolates per herd).
   Results: The molecular sub-typing, carried out using three SSR and 10
   MIRU-VNTR loci, differentiated the 84 isolates into 33 clusters,
   reaching a Simpson's Discriminatory Index (SID) value of 0.952 (0.933 to
   0.972, 95\% confidence intervals). Among all considered loci, six (SSR2,
   MIRU2, SSR1, SSR8, VNTR3527 and VNTR1067) showed relevant allelic
   variability. Thirty-eight\% of the isolates were clustered into four
   genotypes, differing from each other for the SSR2 locus. The other
   isolates, characterised by differences in two or more loci, were spread
   among the rest of the clusters. The intra-herd analysis revealed more
   than one genotype in most herds with a similar distribution of clusters.
   Conclusions: Our results revealed the advantage of using both Mini- and
   Microsatellite approaches for successfully discriminating among Map Type
   C isolates from the same geographic area, host species and herd. These
   data suggest that the combination of loci here proposed could be a
   useful molecular tool for regional epidemiological studies.},

Abstract = {Milk fat globules (MFGs) are vesicles released in milk as fat droplets
   surrounded by the endoplasmic reticulum and apical cell membranes.
   During formation and apocrine secretion by lactocytes, various amounts
   of cytoplasmic crescents remain trapped within the released vesicle,
   making MFGs a natural sampling mechanism of the lactating cell contents.
   With the aim of investigating the events occurring in the mammary
   epithelium during bacterial infection, the MFG proteome was
   characterized by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2-D
   DIGE), SDS-PAGE followed by shotgun liquid chromatography-tandem mass
   spectrometry (GeLC-MS/MS), label-free quantification by the normalized
   spectral abundance factor (NSAF) approach, Western blotting, and pathway
   analysis, using sheep naturally infected by Mycoplasma agalactiae. A
   number of protein classes were found to increase in MFGs upon infection,
   including proteins involved in inflammation and host defense, cortical
   cytoskeleton proteins, heat shock proteins, and proteins related to
   oxidative stress. Conversely, a strikingly lower abundance was observed
   for proteins devoted to MFG metabolism and secretion. To our knowledge,
   this is the first report describing proteomic changes occurring in MFGs
   during sheep infectious mastitis. The results presented here offer new
   insights into the in vivo response of mammary epithelial cells to
   bacterial infection and open the way to the discovery of protein
   biomarkers for monitoring clinical and subclinical mastitis.},

Title = {Antigenic Drift in H5N1 Avian Influenza Virus in Poultry Is Driven by

Abstract = {H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus has been endemic in poultry
   in Egypt since 2008, notwithstanding the implementation of mass
   vaccination and culling of infected birds. Extensive circulation of the
   virus has resulted in a progressive genetic evolution and an antigenic
   drift. In poultry, the occurrence of antigenic drift in avian influenza
   viruses is less well documented and the mechanisms remain to be
   clarified. To test the hypothesis that H5N1 antigenic drift is driven by
   mechanisms similar to type A influenza viruses in humans, we generated
   reassortant viruses, by reverse genetics, that harbored molecular
   changes identified in genetically divergent viruses circulating in the
   vaccinated population. Parental and reassortant phenotype viruses were
   antigenically analyzed by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test and
   microneutralization (MN) assay. The results of the study indicate that
   the antigenic drift of H5N1 in poultry is driven by multiple mutations
   primarily occurring in major antigenic sites at the receptor binding
   subdomain, similarly to what has been described for human influenza H1
   and H3 subtype viruses.},

Abstract = {Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) is a probiotic for humans and is
   normally not found in pigs; however, it has been shown to protect the
   human-derived intestinal Caco-2 cells against the damage induced by an
   important intestinal pathogen, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli F4
   (ETEC). An experiment was conducted to test whether the dietary addition
   of LGG improves the growth and health of weaned pigs when orally
   challenged by E. coli F4. Thirty-six pigs were weaned at 21 days and
   assigned to a standard weaning diet with or without 10(10) CFU LGG (ATCC
   53103) per day. The pigs, individually penned, were orally challenged
   with 1.5 ml of a 10(10) CFU E. coli F4 suspension on day 7 and
   slaughtered on day 12 or 14. With the addition of LGG, the average daily
   gain and the average daily feed intake were reduced after the challenge
   with ETEC and for the entire trial (P<0.05). The average faecal score
   tended to worsen from day 11 to the end of the trial and the
   concentration of ETEC in the faeces tended to increase (P=0.07) with the
   LGG supplementation. The counts of lactic acid bacteria, enterobacteria
   and yeasts in the colonic digesta were not affected. The pH values in
   ileal, colonic and caecal digesta, and the small intestine size were
   also unchanged. Regardless of the site of measurement (duodenum, jejunum
   or ileum), a trend of decreased villus height was seen with LGG
   (P=0.10). Crypt depth and villus to crypt ratio were unchanged by the
   diet. A gradual increase of total seric IgA was seen after 1 week and
   after the challenge, in the control (P<0.05), but not in the treated
   group. After the challenge, the LGG reduced the total IgA in the blood
   serum (P<0.05), v. the control. The total IgA in the saliva and in the
   jejunum secretion were not affected by the diet. The F4-specific IgA
   activity was not affected by the diet at all the samplings. Our result
   shows that, the administration of LGG do not prevent or reduce the
   detrimental effect of the E. coli F4 infection on the growth performance
   and health status of weaned piglet.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the response of physical,
   hematological, and biochemical parameters after acute intense exercise
   in polo horses playing in an outdoor international competition. The game
   consisted of four periods (chukkas) and each period consisted a playing
   time of 7 minutes. Two matches were played everyday for a week. A total
   of 12 horses were examined. Each ``high-goal{''} polo horse played one
   chukka a day for 4 days. Horses were clinically examined the day before
   the games started and then daily during the 4 days of their
   participation in the games. During these days, physical examination was
   performed and blood sample was collected at rest (T0), immediately (T1)
   after exercise, and after 30 minutes of exercise (T2). Blood samples
   were analyzed for total cell counts and for determination of creatine
   kinase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase,
   lactate, total proteins, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and cortisol.
   Data were evaluated using two-way analysis of variance. Exercise caused
   significant dehydration (P < .01), mucous membranes congestion,
   increased heart rate (P < .001), and capillary refill time (P < .001).
   It also caused increased value of the following parameters: hematocrit
   (P < .001), red blood cells (P < .001), hemoglobin (P < .001), white
   blood cells (P < .05), lymphocyte (P < .001), total proteins (P < .001),
   creatine kinase (P < .05), LDH (P < .01), lactate (P < .001), and
   cortisol (P < .01), and a decrease in the platelet count (P < .001),
   calcium (P < .01), phosphorus (P < .001), and magnesium (P < .001). All
   parameters returned within or near the reference range by 30 minutes
   postexercise. On the basis of these observations, data were considered
   indicative of a good response to an acute intense exercise. Moreover
   statistical results obtained were typical of a mixed aerobic/anaerobic
   metabolic pathway that is prevailing in this sport. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {Viral encephalopathy and retinopathy (VER), otherwise known as viral
   nervous necrosis (VNN), is a neuropathological condition affecting > 40
   species of fish. Although VER affects mainly marine fish, the disease
   has also been detected in certain species reared in freshwater
   environments. There are relatively few reports concerning the disease in
   freshwater species, and there is not much information on clinical signs.
   Nevertheless, the most common clinical findings reported from affected
   freshwater species are consistent with the typical signs observed in
   marine species. In this paper we describe the main clinical signs and
   the laboratory results associated with the detection of a betanodavirus
   in hybrid striped bass x white bass (Morone saxatilis x Morone chrysops)
   and largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, reared in a freshwater
   environment. We also detected the virus by real-time PCR and isolated it
   in cell culture from a batch of pike-perch Sander lucioperca farmed in
   the same system.},

Abstract = {An analytical, pharmacokinetic and histopathologic investigation was
   conducted by two experimental trials on beef cattle in order to
   determine fate and effects of dexamethasone and prednisolone,
   administered to distinct cattle groups at low dosage for long periods of
   time. In trial 1, eighteen Charolaise beef cattle, male,
   17-22-months-old, were divided in three groups: to group A (n = 6)
   dexamethasone-21-sodium-phosphate 0.7 mg day(-1) per os for 40 days was
   administered: group B (n = 6) was orally treated with prednisolone 15 mg
   day(-1) for 30 days, while group C (n = 6) served as negative control.
   Urine was collected at days 0, 7, 15,25 and 47 from groups A and C. and
   at days 0, 8, 18 and 42 from group B. In trial 2, sixteen Friesian
   cattle, male, 10-17-months-old, were randomly divided into two groups:
   group D (n = 8) was administered prednisolone 30 mg day(-1) per as for
   35 days, while group K (n = 8) served as control. In both trials, the
   animals were slaughtered after a 6-days drug withdrawal and thymus and
   livers were collected and properly stored until the analysis was
   performed.
   Quantitative determinations of dexamethasone, prednisolone and its main
   metabolite. prednisone, in urine and liver samples were conducted by
   HPLC-MS/MS, after the analytical procedure was optimized and fully
   validated. The method validation included the assessment of specificity,
   linearity, precision, trueness, robustness, CC(alpha) and CC(beta)
   values.
   By a morphological point of view, severe atrophy of thymus parenchyma
   was observed in group A, together with a significant (P<0.005) reduction
   of the mean thymus weight (217 +/- 94 g), while group B (646 +/- 215 g)
   presented normal thymus features and weights (group C, 415 +/- 116 g).
   Accordingly, no differences were found in trial 2 for groups D (727 +/-
   275 g) and K (642 +/- 173 g).
   Average dexamethasone concentrations in group A urine samples ranged
   from 1.4 to 3.0 mu g L(-1) during the treatment, while no residue was
   detected in the urine samples collected 6-7 days after the end of the
   treatment. Low amounts of dexamethasone (<1 mu g L(-1)) were detected in
   liver samples of group A.
   All average prednisolone concentrations in group B urine samples (sum of
   conjugate and free form) turned out to be below 1.0 mu g L(-1) during
   the treatment, despite the much higher concentration administered (15-30
   mg day(-1)) with respect to dexamethasone in group A (0.7 mg day(-1)).
   No prednisolone residues were found in the urine and liver samples taken
   at the slaughterhouse.
   The absence of any prednisolone residue in the urine samples of control
   group animals supports the theory that the origin of this molecule is
   fundamentally exogenous, at least for this cattle category maintained
   under unstressing conditions. Remarkable findings are represented by the
   absence of thymus atrophy in the prednisolone treated animals and the
   extremely low residue concentrations found in urine during the
   treatment. Both findings reveal that the detection of illegal
   growth-promoting treatments with this drug is difficult. (C) 2010

Abstract = {A liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) confirmatory
   method for the simultaneous determination of nine corticosteroids in
   liver, including the four MRL compounds listed in Council Regulation
   37/2010, was developed. After an enzymatic deconjugation and a solvent
   extraction of the liver tissue, the resulting solution was cleaned up
   through an SPE Oasis HLB cartridge. The analytes were then detected by
   liquid chromatography-negative-ion electrospray tandem mass
   spectrometry, using deuterium-labelled internal standards. The procedure
   was validated as a quantitative confirmatory method according to the
   Commission Decision 2002/657/EC criteria. The results showed that the
   method was suitable for statutory residue testing regarding the
   following performance characteristics: instrumental linearity,
   specificity, precision (repeatability and intra-laboratory
   reproducibility), recovery, decision limit (CC alpha), detection
   capability (CC beta) and ruggedness.
   All the corticosteroids can be detected at a concentration around 1 mu g
   kg(-1); the recoveries were above 62\% for all the analytes.
   Repeatability and reproducibility (within-laboratory reproducibility)
   for all the analytes were below 7.65\% and 15.5\%, respectively. (C)

Abstract = {Despite the growing importance of qualitative screening tests in routine
   laboratories involved in the EU official control, their validation is
   not as deeply explained in Commission Decision 2002/657/EC as the
   validation of quantitative confirmatory methods. At the same time, the
   issue of quality assurance of screening assays defining internal quality
   control (IQC) procedures as required by accreditation bodies is
   undoubtedly less developed in this analytical field. As an example the
   present study describes the development, the validation and the IQC
   implemented for a commercial enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
   able to detect 17-alpha-19-nortestosterone (alpha-NT) and
   17-beta-19-nortestosterone (beta-NT) isomers in bullock urine. In order
   to select a suitable sample treatment, two SPE purification protocols
   were preliminary compared. The chosen method was therefore fully
   validated determining the mandatory parameters required by Commission
   Decision 2002/657/EC: specificity, detection capability and robustness.
   An in-depth discussion was carried out illustrating the possible
   validation approaches and their implications especially in the
   assessment of the key performance characteristic: detection capability.
   Finally, the control charts implemented for continuous method
   verification during analyses of real samples were reported. (C) 2011

Abstract = {A confirmatory method for the determination of residues of eleven
   coccidiostats including ionophore antibiotics: lasalocid, maduramycin,
   monensin, narasin, salinomycin, semduramycin and chemical coccidiostats:
   decoquinate, diclazuril, halofuginone, nicarbazin and robenidine in
   poultry eggs was developed and validated. The sample was extracted with
   acetonitrile, defatted with hexane and cleaned-up on a silica SPE
   cartridge. The analytes were identified and quantified by liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The method
   performance characteristics required by Commission Decision 2002/657/EC
   were estimated adopting a more flexible and simple validation design. In
   this alternative approach the experimental study focuses on a larger
   dynamic range with progressively increasing validation levels. Each of
   them presents equal concentrations of all the analytes. On the contrary
   the classical Decision plan investigates a restricted concentration
   range necessarily different for each analyte being determined by the
   individual permitted limit (0.5-1.5 times the permitted limit). As a
   consequence each validation level involves the simultaneous
   fortification with complex mixtures containing different concentrations
   of each analyte. Adopting this alternative strategy the validation of
   several substances with significantly different permitted limits is
   considerably simplified and a deeper knowledge of the method is
   achieved. The results proved that the method enables the confirmation of
   regulated coccidiostats in eggs at the levels required in the official
   control of residues (CC alpha in the range of 2.2-174 mu g kg(-1),
   depending on the coccidiostat). The repeatability (CVr in the range of
   1.1-19\%) and within-laboratory reproducibility (CVRW in the range of
   1.8-30\%) are also acceptable. The procedure was successfully verified
   in the proficiency test and implemented in the national residue control
   plan. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Avermectines are antiparasitic agents widely used as veterinary drugs
   for food producing animals. The European Community, due to their side
   effects, limited the use of these molecules establishing maximum residue
   limits (MRLs) in some foods.
   A validated qualitative and quantitative high performance liquid
   chromatography method with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FL) is presented
   for the simultaneous determination of ivermectin (IVM), abemectin (ABA),
   moxidectin (MOX), eprinomectin (EPR), doramectin (DOR) and emamectin
   (EMA) in foodstuffs (muscle, eggs and milk). Samples were extracted with
   acetonitrile, purified with liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), and analysed
   by HLPC-FL previous derivatization with trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA)
   in presence of 1-methyl-imidazole (MI) and acetic acid.
   To date, the presented method is the first validated for the matrix
   eggs, and in accordance with the requirements set by Commission Decision
   2002/657/EC. Recoveries of the methods, calculated spiking the samples
   in the range 5.0-100.0 mu g kg(-1), were 64-83\% for muscle, 65-89\% for
   milk and 63-84\% for eggs. The precision (CV) ranged between 9.2 and
   17.1\% for muscle, 9.9 and 16.6\% for milk and from 9.4 to 17.4\% for
   eggs. Linearity for the six analytes was calculated from 5.0 to 200.0 mu
   g kg(-1).
   The main advantages of the presented method are its rapidity, the
   specificity, the good precision and recovery that make it very suitable
   to the detection and determination of avermectines. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is the etiological agent of a
   lethal and contagious disease of rabbits that remains as a serious
   problem worldwide. As this virus does not replicate in cell culture
   systems, the capsid protein gene has been expressed in heterologous
   hosts or inserted in replication-competent viruses in order to obtain
   non-conventional RHDV vaccines. However, due to technological or safety
   issues, current RHDV vaccines are still prepared from organs of infected
   rabbits. In this work, two human type 5 derived replication-defective
   adenoviruses encoding the rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus VP60 capsid
   protein were constructed. The recombinant protein was expressed as a
   multimer in mouse and rabbit cell lines at levels that ranged from
   approximately 120 to 160 mg/L of culture. Mice intravenously or
   subcutaneously inoculated with a single 10(8) gene transfer units (GTU)
   dose of the AdVP60 vector (designed for VP60 intracellular expression)
   seroconverted at days 7 and 14 post-immunization, respectively. This
   vector generated a stronger response than that obtained with a second
   vector (AdVP60sec) designed for VP60 secretion. Rabbits were then
   immunized by parenteral or mucosal routes with a single 10(9) GTU dose
   of the AdVP60 and the antibody response was evaluated using a
   competition ELISA specific for RH DV or RHDVa. Protective
   hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers were also promptly detected and
   IgG antibodies corresponding with inhibition percentages over 85\%
   persisted up to one year in all rabbits, independently of the
   immunization route employed. These levels were similar to those elicited
   with inactivated RHDV or with VP60 obtained from yeast or insect cells.
   IgA specific antibodies were only found in saliva of rabbits immunized
   by intranasal instillation. The feasibility of VP60 production and
   vaccination of rabbits with replication-defective adenoviral vectors was
   demonstrated. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Mercuric chloride (HgCl(2)) causes acute oxidant renal failure that
   affects mainly proximal tubules. Schisandrin B (Sch B), an active lignan
   from the fruit of Schisandra chinensis, has been successfully used to
   treat gentamicin nephrotoxicity, but its role against mercury damage is
   still largely unknown. Here we analysed in vivo and in vitro the
   efficacy of Sch B supplementation against HgCl(2) nephrotoxicity,
   focusing on histopathology, stress proteins, oxidative (cytochrome c
   oxidase) and nitrosactive markers (eNOS, nNOS).
   Wistar rats were treated with Sch B (10 mg/kg/day p.o.) or vehicle
   (olive oil) for 9 days, then coad-ministered with a single HgCl(2)
   nephrotoxic dose (3.5 mg/kg i.p.) and killed after 24 h. The tubular and
   mitochondrial damage induced by mercury was limited by Sch B
   coadministration in vivo. Remarkably, after Sch B and mercury challenge,
   HSP25, HSP72, GRP75 were reduced in the renal cortex, cytochrome c
   oxidase increased and eNOS and nNOS were restored in glomeruli. In
   contrast, NRK-52E proximal tubular cells treated with Sch B 6.25 mu M
   plus HgCl(2) 20 mu M did not show any amelioration on viability and
   oxidative stress in respect to HgCl(2) 20 mu M alone. Moreover, after
   Sch B plus mercury in vitro treatment, HSP72 staining persisted while
   HSP25 further increased. Thus, in our experimental conditions, Sch B
   cotreatment afforded better protection against mercury poisoning in vivo
   than in vitro. This discrepancy might be partly attributable to Sch B
   influence on glomerular perfusion as corroborated by the recovery of
   vasoactive markers like macular and endothelial nitric oxide isoforms.

Title = {Characterization of Salmonella Occurring at High Prevalence in a

   Islands, Ecuador},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to elucidate the association between the
   zoonotic pathogen Salmonella and a population of land iguana, Colonophus
   subcristatus, endemic to Galapagos Islands in Ecuador. We assessed the
   presence of Salmonella subspecies and serovars and estimated the
   prevalence of the pathogen in that population. Additionally, we
   investigated the genetic relatedness among isolates and serovars
   utilising pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) on XbaI-digested DNA
   and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility to a panel of
   antimicrobials. The study was carried out by sampling cloacal swabs from
   animals (n = 63) in their natural environment on in the island of Santa
   Cruz. A high prevalence (62/63, 98.4\%) was observed with heterogeneity
   of Salmonella subspecies and serovars, all known to be associated with
   reptiles and with reptile-associated salomonellosis in humans.
   Serotyping revealed 14 different serovars among four Salmonella enterica
   subspecies: S. enterica subsp. enterica (n = 48), S. enterica subsp.
   salamae (n = 2), S. enterica subsp. diarizonae (n = 1), and S. enterica
   subsp. houtenae (n = 7). Four serovars were predominant: S. Poona (n =
   18), S. Pomona (n = 10), S. Abaetetuba (n = 8), and S. Newport (n = 5).
   The S. Poona isolates revealed nine unique XbaI PFGE patterns, with 15
   isolates showing a similarity of 70\%. Nine S. Pomona isolates had a
   similarity of 84\%. One main cluster with seven (88\%) indistinguishable
   isolates of S. Abaetetuba was observed. All the Salmonella isolates were
   pan-susceptible to antimicrobials representative of the most relevant
   therapeutic classes. The high prevalence and absence of clinical signs
   suggest a natural interaction of the different Salmonella serovars with
   the host species. The interaction may have been established before any
   possible exposure of the iguanas and the biocenosis to direct or
   indirect environmental factors influenced by the use of antimicrobials
   in agriculture, in human medicine or in veterinary medicine.},

Abstract = {This study used PCR-RFLP to investigate the genetic variability of
   pmp-encoding genes from fifty-two Chlamydophila abortus (C. abortus)
   strains originating from abortion cases from various geographical
   regions and host species. Six primer pairs were used to PCR-amplify DNA
   fragments encoding eighteen pmps. PCR products were digested using four
   restriction endonucleases and Bayesian methodologies were used to
   compare RFLP profiles and assign strains to a RFLP genotype. Strains
   could be assigned to 2 genotypes in the region encoding pmp18D, 3
   genotypes in the regions encoding pmp1A-pmp2B, pmp3E-pmp6H and
   pmp11G-pmp15G, 4 genotypes in the region encoding pmp7G-pmp10G and 5
   genotypes in the region encoding pmp16G-pmp17G. In all regions, the
   majority of strains (88.4-96.1\%) had the same genotype as the reference
   strain S26/3. No correlation could be made between genotype, host
   species or geographical origin except for the two variant Greek strains,
   LLG and POS, which formed a discrete genotype in all pmp-encoding
   regions except pmp18D. Relative rates of evolution calculated for each
   pmp-encoding gene locus suggest that differing selective pressures and
   functional constraints may exist on C. abortus polymorphic membrane
   proteins. These findings suggest that although intraspecies
   heterogeneity of pmp-encoding genes in C. abortus is low, the sequence
   heterogeneity should be an important consideration when using pmps as
   the basis for novel diagnostics or vaccine development. (C) 2011

Abstract = {A two year study (2008-2009) was carried out to monitor the Usutu virus
   (USUV) circulation in Italy. Sentinel horses and chickens, wild birds
   and mosquitoes were sampled and tested for the presence of USUV and USUV
   antibodies within the WND National Surveillance plan. Seroconversion
   evidenced in sentinel animals proved that in these two years the virus
   has circulated in Tuscany, Emilia Romagna, Veneto and Friuli Venezia
   Giulia regions. In Veneto USUV caused a severe blackbird die-off disease
   involving at least a thousand birds. Eleven viral strains were detected
   in organs of 9 blackbirds (52.9\%) and two magpies (0.5\%) originating
   from Veneto and Emilia Romagna regions. USUV was also detected in a pool
   of Culex pipiens caught in Tuscany. According to the alignment of the
   NS5 partial sequences, no differences between the Italian USUV strains
   isolated from Veneto. Friuli and Emilia Romagna regions were observed.
   The Italian North Eastern strain sequences were identical to those of
   the strain detected in the brain of a human patient and shared a high
   similarity with the isolates from Vienna and Budapest. Conversely, there
   were few differences between the Italian strains which circulated in the
   North Eastern regions and the USUV strain detected in a pool of C.
   pipiens caught in Tuscany. A high degree of similarity at both
   nucleotide and amino acid level was also found when the full genome
   sequence of the Italian North Eastern isolate was compared with that of
   the strains circulating in Europe. The North Eastern Italian strain
   sequence exhibited 97\% identity to the South African reference strain
   SAAR-1776. The deduced amino acid sequences of the Italian strain
   differed by 10 and 11 amino-acids from the Budapest and Vienna strains,
   respectively, and by 28 from the SAAR-1776 strain. According to this
   study two strains of USUVs are likely to have circulated in Italy
   between 2008 and 2009. They have developed strategies of adaptation and
   evolution to spread into new areas and to become established. (C) 2011

Abstract = {Water buffalo milk and derived dairy products, including mozzarella
   cheese, represent a possible source of Brucella contamination for
   consumers. Brucella is a severe pathogen for human health even at low
   concentrations. It is therefore fundamental to develop an assay that is
   faster and more sensitive than the traditional bacterial culturing
   method for the detection of the pathogen in the food matrix. We designed
   a Real-time PCR assay able to detect as low as 1 CFU/ml of Brucella spp.
   in water (80\% probability) and 3 CFU/ml of Brucella spp. in buffalo
   milk (50\% probability) in less than 3 h without any enrichment step.
   The assay was validated by calculating specificity, sensitivity,
   detection limit, precision, PCR efficiency, DNA extraction efficiency
   and food matrix inhibition. When this method was employed to detect and
   quantify Brucella spp. in 109 buffalo milk samples, the assay
   demonstrated a higher sensitivity in comparison to bacteriological
   analysis (27 positive samples and 2 positive samples, respectively). (C)

Abstract = {Small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs) represent a group of viruses
   infecting sheep and goats worldwide. Despite the high heterogeneity of
   genotype A strains, which cluster into as many as ten subtypes, genotype
   B was believed to be less complex and has, so far, been subdivided into
   only two subtypes. Here, we describe two novel full-length proviral
   sequences isolated from Sarda sheep in two Italian regions. Genome
   sequence as well as the main linear epitopes clearly placed this cluster
   into genotype B. However, owing to long-standing segregation of this
   sheep breed, the genetic distances that are clearly >15\% with respect
   to B1 and B2 subtypes suggest the designation of a novel subtype, B3.
   Moreover the close relationship with a gag sequence obtained from a
   Turkish sheep adds new evidence to historical data that suggest an
   anthropochorous dissemination of hosts (small ruminants) and their
   pathogens (SRLV) during the colonization of the Mediterranean from the
   Middle East.},

Title = {Assessment of the Genetic Susceptibility of Sheep to Scrapie by Protein
   Misfolding Cyclic Amplification and Comparison with Experimental Scrapie

Abstract = {The susceptibility of sheep to scrapie is influenced mainly by the prion
   protein polymorphisms A136V, R154H, and Q171R/H. Here we analyzed the
   ability of protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) to model the
   genetic susceptibility of sheep to scrapie. For this purpose, we studied
   the efficiency of brain homogenates from sheep with different PrP
   genotypes to support PrPSc amplification by PMCA using an ARQ/ARQ
   scrapie inoculum. The results were then compared with those obtained in
   vivo using the same sheep breed, genotypes, and scrapie inoculum.
   Genotypes associated with susceptibility (ARQ/ARQ, ARQ/AHQ, and AHQ/ARH)
   were able to sustain PrPSc amplification in PMCA reactions, while
   genotypes associated with resistance to scrapie (ARQ/ARR and ARR/ARR)
   were unable to support the in vitro conversion. The incubation times of
   the experimental infection were then compared with the in vitro
   amplification factors. Linear regression analysis showed that the
   efficiency of in vitro PrPSc amplification of the different genotypes
   was indeed inversely proportional to their incubation times. Finally,
   the rare ARQK(176)/ARQK(176) genotype, for which no in vivo data are
   available, was studied by PMCA. No amplification was obtained,
   suggesting ARQK(176)/ARQK(176) as an additional genotype associated with
   resistance, at least to the isolate tested. Our results indicate a
   direct correlation between the ability of different PrP genotypes to
   undergo PrPC-to-PrPSc conversion by PMCA and their in vivo
   susceptibility and point to PMCA as an alternative to transmission
   studies and a potential tool to test the susceptibility of numerous
   sheep PrP genotypes to a variety of prion sources.},

Abstract = {Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are ubiquitous conserved
   chaperone-like proteins involved in cellular proteins protection under
   stressful conditions. In this study, a reverse transcription
   quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) procedure was developed and used to quantify
   the transcript level of a small heat shock gene (shs) in the probiotic
   bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, under stress conditions such
   as heat (45 degrees C and 53 degrees C), bile (0.3\% w/v), hyperosmosis
   (1 M and 2.5 M NaCl), and low pH value (pH 4). The shs gene of L.
   acidophilus NCFM was induced by salt, high temperature and acidic
   stress, while repression was observed upon bile stress. Analysis of the
   5' noncoding region of the hsp16 gene reveals the presence of an
   inverted repeat (IR) sequence (TTAGCACTC-N9-GAGTGCTAA) homologue to the
   controlling IR of chaperone expression (CIRCE) elements found in the
   upstream regulatory region of Gram-positive heat shock operons,
   suggesting that the hsp16 gene of L. acidophilus might be
   transcriptionally controlled by HrcA. In addition, the alignment of
   several small heat shock proteins identified so far in lactic acid
   bacteria, reveals that the Hsp16 of L. acidophilus exhibits a strong
   evolutionary relationship with members of the Lactobacillus acidophilus
   group.},

Abstract = {Blooms of Ostreopsis spp. have been recently reported along the
   Mediterranean coasts of Spain, France, Italy, and Greece posing serious
   risks to human health. Occurrence of Ostreopsis spp. may result in
   palytoxin contamination of seafood and, in order to prevent sanitary
   risks, the need exists to develop efficient extraction procedures to be
   coupled to rapid and sensitive monitoring methods of palytoxin-like
   compounds in seafood. In the present study, the best conditions for both
   extraction of palytoxin from seafood and palytoxin quantification by
   using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were
   investigated. Three seafood matrices (mussels, sea-urchins, and
   anchovies) were selected and five different extraction systems were
   tested, namely: the official protocol for extraction of lipophilic
   toxins and various aqueous methanol or acetonitrile solutions (MeOH/H2O
   1:1, MeOH/H2O 8:2, MeCN/H2O 8:2 and MeOH 100\%). Extraction with
   MeOH/H2O 8:2 provided the best results in terms of accuracy and matrix
   interference on LC-MS/MS detection of palytoxin. Accuracy and intra-day
   reproducibility (n = 3) were evaluated for all the selected matrices but
   only for mussels at three spiking concentration levels, including the
   provisional limit proposed by the Community Reference Laboratory for
   marine biotoxins (250 mu g kg(-1)). Limits of quantitation of palytoxin
   in mussels, sea-urchins and anchovies tissues were calculated using
   matrix-matched standards; taking into account extraction efficiency of
   MeOH/H2O 8:2, they resulted to be 228, 343, and 500 mu g kg(-1),
   respectively.},

Abstract = {Confidence intervals for blood parameters used for nutritional and
   metabolic profile testing in cattle were calculated for clinically
   normal lactating Holstein cows, taking into account the effects of
   parity, stage of lactation, and season. Blood samples were collected
   from 740 cows in 33 Italian dairy herds according to a predefined
   protocol. Herds were visited during summer and the following winter,
   sampling 12 lactating cows at each visit (4 primiparous and 8
   multiparous). Six cows were selected from the early-lactation group
   (days in milk: 10 to 89) and the other 6 were selected from the
   mid-lactation group (days in milk: 90 to 215). Cow selection criteria
   excluded animals clinically exposed to periparturient diseases as well
   as animals not considered in good health by a veterinary clinical
   examination. For each blood variable, outliers were identified and
   discarded. Data were then analyzed for their Gaussian distribution and
   variables with not normal distribution were log-transformed to adjust
   for lack of normality. Herd mean values were calculated for each blood
   parameter according to 3 main classification factors: parity
   (primiparous vs. multiparous), stage of lactation (early vs. mid) and
   season of production (summer vs. winter). The resulting data set was
   statistically analyzed using a mixed model with the fixed effects of
   these factors, their interactions, and the random effect of herd.
   General 95\% confidence intervals were calculated for blood variables
   that showed a relevant herd variance component such as albumin,
   triglycerides, aspartate, urea, glucose, alanine aminotransferase,
   lactate dehydrogenase, direct and total bilirubin, calcium, magnesium,
   and potassium. For the remaining parameters, specific confidence
   intervals were calculated for each level of the significant main
   factors. Parity affected blood concentration of total protein, globulin,
   creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyl transferase, creatinine
   kinase, and phosphorus. Blood nonesterified fatty acids, aspartate
   aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl transferase, creatinine kinase and
   cholesterol were influenced by stage of lactation. The season of
   production had a significant effect on total protein, globulin,
   creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, phosphorus, sodium, and chlorine. The
   outcomes of this work will improve the accuracy of the biochemical
   profile as a tool for dairy practitioners to assess the metabolic status
   of lactating Holstein cows.},

Abstract = {A sandwich ELISA using recombinant integrin alpha v beta 6 as a capture
   ligand and serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) as detecting
   reagents has been compared with a polyclonal antibody based ELISA (using
   type-specific rabbit antibodies as capture and guinea pig antibodies as
   detectors), which is employed routinely at the FAO World Reference
   Laboratory for Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD), for the identification and
   serotyping of FMD virus (FMDV). The study used cell culture grown
   antigens (1351 FMDV positive) derived from suspected cases of vesicular
   disease collected from 86 countries between 1924 and 2011, those
   positive for the other vesicular diseases of swine vesicular disease (n
   = 25) and vesicular stomatitis (n = 45) and negative samples collected
   from uninfected cell cultures (n = 36). The diagnostic sensitivity of
   the assays was similar at 98.1\% (polyclonal ELISA) compared to 97.9\%
   (integrin/Mab ELISA) but the serotypic-specificity of the latter was
   vastly superior (96\%) to that of the former (61.5\%). Reactions with
   the viruses of swine vesicular disease and vesicular stomatitis, which
   produce clinically indistinguishable syndromes in pigs and cattle, did
   not occur. The integrin/Mab ELISA recognized FMDV strains of wide
   antigenic and molecular diversity of all seven serotypes and although
   some FMDV isolates were not detected, the greater specificity of the
   assay, while retaining test sensitivity comparable to the conventional
   assay, warrants its consideration for adoption for routine diagnostic
   use. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Avian influenza viruses of the H9N2 subtype have seriously affected the
   poultry industry of the Far and Middle East since the mid-1990s and are
   considered one of the most likely candidates to cause a new influenza
   pandemic in humans. To understand the genesis and epidemiology of these
   viruses, we investigated the spatial and evolutionary dynamics of
   complete genome sequences of H9N2 viruses circulating in nine Middle
   Eastern and Central Asian countries from 1998 to 2010. We identified
   four distinct and cocirculating groups (A, B, C, and D), each of which
   has undergone widespread inter- and intrasubtype reassortments, leading
   to the generation of viruses with unknown biological properties. Our
   analysis also suggested that eastern Asia served as the major source for
   H9N2 gene segments in the Middle East and Central Asia and that in this
   geographic region within-country evolution played a more important role
   in shaping viral genetic diversity than migration between countries. The
   genetic variability identified among the H9N2 viruses was associated
   with specific amino acid substitutions that are believed to result in
   increased transmissibility in mammals, as well as resistance to
   antiviral drugs. Our study highlights the need to constantly monitor the
   evolution of H9N2 viruses in poultry to better understand the potential
   risk to human health posed by these viruses.},

Abstract = {Many assays aimed to test the inhibitory effects of synthetic molecules,
   and naturally occurring products on the neuraminidase activity exploit
   the hydrolysis of 2'-O-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-N-acetylneuraminic acid
   (4-MUNANA). The amount of the released product, 4-methylumbelliferone
   (4-MU), is then measured fluorimetrically. The authors attempted an
   analysis of the inhibitory properties of 35 naturally occurring
   flavonoids on neuraminidase N3, where only 29 of them were sufficiently
   soluble in the assay medium. During the analysis, the authors noticed a
   strong quenching effect due to the test compounds on the fluorescence of
   4-MU. The quenching constants for the flavonoids were determined
   according to the Stern-Volmer approach. The extent of fluorescence
   reduction due to quenching and the magnitude of the fluorescence
   reduction measured in the inhibition assays were comparable: for 11 of
   29 compounds, the two values were found to be coincident within the
   experimental uncertainty. These data were statistically analyzed for
   correlation by calculating the pertinent Pearson correlation
   coefficient. Inhibition and quenching were found to be positively
   correlated (r = 0.71, p(uncorr) = 1.5 x 10(-5)), and the correlation was
   maintained for the whole set of tested compounds. Altogether, the
   collected data imply that all of the tested flavonoids could produce
   false-positive results in the neuraminidase inhibition assay using
   4-MUNANA as a substrate. (Journal of Biomolecular Screening

Abstract = {This study reports a combined analysis of mitochondrial and ribosomal
   DNA target regions of phlebotomine sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae)
   from the Mediterranean region. A similar to 900 bp long fragment of the
   mitochondrial DNA encompassing regions within cytb and nd1 gene and the
   complete ITS2 ribosomal region (similar to 500 bp) were sequenced and
   characterized for Phlebotomus perniciosus, Phlebotomus perfiliewi,
   Phlebotomus neglectus, Phlebotomus papatasi, and Sergentomyia minuta,
   captured in two sites of southern Italy. From one to eight mitochondrial
   haplotypes and from one to three ITS2 sequence types were found for the
   examined specimens according to the different sand fly species. The mean
   interspecific difference in the mitochondrial sequences was of 16.1\%,
   with an overall intraspecific nucleotide variation from 0.1 to 2.8\%. A
   higher interspecific difference (mean 25.1\%) was recorded for the ITS2
   sequence, with an overall intraspecific nucleotide variation up to
   4.9\%. The sequence types alignment of ITS2 region showed that all
   phlebotomine specimens possessed a split 5.8S rRNA, consisting of a
   mature 5.8S rRNA and a 2S rRNA separated by a short transcribed spacer.
   Phylogenetic analysis of the Phlebotomus spp. sequences, herein
   determined and of those available in GenBank (TM) were concordant in
   clustering P. neglectus, P. perfiliewi and P. papatasi with the same
   species collected from different geographic areas of the Mediterranean
   basin in four main clades for mtDNA and ITS2, respectively. This study
   demonstrates the utility of multilocus sequencing, provides a dataset
   for the molecular identification of the most prevalent phlebotomine sand
   flies in southern Europe and defines the phylogenetic relationships
   among species examined. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A forensic short tandem repeat (STR) typing test using a population
   database was developed to investigate an instance of poaching on the
   protected Sardinian mouflon. The case study involves a suspected poacher
   found in possession of a carcass, which he claimed was that of a sheep
   from his flock and had died accidentally. His claim was refuted by the
   molecular forensic analyses as DNA typing and the Bayesian assignment
   test revealed the carcass to be mouflon-derived; the genetic profile of
   the carcass matched also that of additional trace evidence collected by
   forestry officers at the scene of the kill. The matching evidence led to
   the poacher being charged with the illegal harvest of protected
   wildlife. Molecular techniques, in combination with a reference
   population database, and the appropriate statistical evaluation of
   genetic information, are fundamental to wildlife forensics. This
   approach allows DNA testing to be accepted in court as submissible
   evidence in the fight against poaching and other crimes involving
   wildlife. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Epizootic haemorrhagic disease (EHD) is an infectious non-contagious
   viral disease transmitted by insects of the genus Culicoides which
   affects wild and domestic ruminants. The causative agent, the epizootic
   haemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV), belongs to the family Reoviridae,
   genus Orbivirus and shares many morphological and structural
   characteristics with the other members of the genus such as bluetongue,
   African horse sickness and equine encephalosis viruses. In recent years
   EHD outbreaks have been reported in countries bordering the European
   Union. They caused disease in cattle and severe repercussion on the
   livestock industry of the affected countries. In the light of recent
   European bluetongue epizootic these events pose an increasing threat to
   the European Union. This review includes the most recent information
   regarding the virus and the disease as well as tools for its diagnosis
   and control. It is our conviction that more attention should be drawn to
   both EHDV and the disease itself in order to fulfil all these gaps and
   not to be unprepared in case future possible incursions. (C) 2011

Title = {European 1: A globally important clonal complex of Mycobacterium bovis},
Journal = {INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {We have identified a globally important clonal complex of Mycobacterium
   bovis by deletion analysis of over one thousand strains from over 30
   countries. We initially show that over 99\% of the strains of M. bovis,
   the cause of bovine tuberculosis, isolated from cattle in the Republic
   of Ireland and the UK are closely related and are members of a single
   clonal complex marked by the deletion of chromosomal region RDEu1 and we
   named this clonal complex European 1 (Eu1). Eu1 strains were present at
   less than 14\% of French, Portuguese and Spanish isolates of M. bovis
   but are rare in other mainland European countries and Iran. However,
   strains of the Eu1 clonal complex were found at high frequency in former
   trading partners of the UK (USA, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia
   and Canada). The Americas, with the exception of Brazil, are dominated
   by the Eu1 clonal complex which was at high frequency in Argentina,
   Chile, Ecuador and Mexico as well as North America. Eu1 was rare or
   absent in the African countries surveyed except South Africa. A small
   sample of strains from Taiwan were non-Eu1 but, surprisingly, isolates
   from Korea and Kazakhstan were members of the Eu1 clonal complex. The
   simplest explanation for much of the current distribution of the Eu1
   clonal complex is that it was spread in infected cattle, such as
   Herefords, from the UK to former trading partners, although there is
   evidence of secondary dispersion since. This is the first identification
   of a globally dispersed clonal complex M. bovis and indicates that much
   of the current global distribution of this important veterinary pathogen
   has resulted from relatively recent International trade in cattle. Crown

Abstract = {A free-living, striped dolphin Stenella coeruleoalba calf was stranded
   on the Latium coast of Italy in November 2009. Significant
   neuropathological findings included non-suppurative meningoencephalitis,
   microgliosis, neuronal degeneration, astrocytosis, and occasional
   multinucleate syncytia. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and reverse
   transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) for Morbillivirus were
   positive exclusively from the brain, with morbilliviral antigen and
   nucleic acid being detected in neurons and, to a lesser extent, in
   astrocytes. A low neutralizing antibody titer (1: 10) against
   Morbillivirus (Canine distemper virus, CDV) was also found in blood
   serum, with no simultaneous presence of serum antibodies to Brucella
   spp. or Toxoplasma gondii. Furthermore, no pathogenic bacteria were
   isolated from any tissue or biological sample. This is the second report
   of morbilliviral encephalitis in a striped dolphin stranded along the
   Italian coastline in a 16 yr period (1993 to 2009). The
   neurohistopathological, IHC, and biomolecular features of this case are
   of additional interest, as antigenic and genomic positivity were
   exclusively confined to the brain of this dolphin, which may have
   acquired morbilliviral infection either postnatally or transplacentally.},

Abstract = {Switzerland has been officially free of bovine tuberculosis (OTF) since
   1960. Since 1980 the control of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) has been
   reduced to passive abattoir surveillance. Isolated cases of bTB, partly
   due to reactivation of human Mycobacterium bovis infections with
   subsequent transmission to cattle, have been noticed in the last years.
   In Europe, the overall prevalence of bTB is slightly increasing. Both
   OTF and non-OTF countries report increases in the proportion of bTB
   positive cattle herds.
   Current bTB eradication and control programs in Europe are facing a
   range of challenges. Whole herd depopulation is becoming a less
   attractive option for economic reasons and due to animal welfare
   concerns. Live animal trade is increasing both at national and
   international levels. Regarding these tendencies and taking into account
   the chronicity of bTB infection, pre-movement testing is becoming
   increasingly important as a central tool for eradication and for
   protection against re-introduction of bTB. Pre-movement testing, however
   specifically focuses on the infection status in individuals, requiring a
   high level of diagnostic accuracy to correctly diagnose infected
   animals. Current screening tests for bTB, however, have been designed to
   meet demands as herd tests. This illustrates that the modification of
   existing and/or the development of new diagnostics for bTB might be
   needed.
   The tuberculin skin test (TST), the primary screening test for bTB may
   in certain situations have low sensitivity. The interferon gamma
   (IFN-gamma) assay is accepted to be more sensitive compared to TST.
   Reduced specificity, however, especially in areas of low bTB prevalence
   raises concerns. New antigen combinations including Rv3615c, OmpATb and
   others have been shown to complement ESAT-6 and CFP-10 in the whole
   blood IFN-gamma assay and resulted in improved sensitivity (compared to
   ESAT-6 and CFP-10) and specificity (compared to tuberculins). Lesion
   detection after slaughter represents a cost-effective procedure for
   passive surveillance of bTB, especially in areas of low prevalence or in
   regions free of bTB; however, its sensitivity is very low. This
   illustrates that trade is linked with a certain risk to re-introduce bTB
   in OTF regions or countries and that there may be delays in detecting a
   re-introduction of bTB.
   In conclusion, regarding the fact that some parameters linked with bTB
   programs are changing, the development of improved diagnostic tests with
   a high reliability for use as individual animal tests will be important
   for future eradication of bTB, in line with international commitment to
   high standard animal health programs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors in canine mammary tumors},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUL 4},
Abstract = {Background: Malignant canine mammary tumors represent 50\% of all
   neoplasms in female dogs. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue
   inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are thought to be involved in
   tumor progression, and they are also associated with the reactive
   stroma, which provides structural and vascular support for tumor growth.
   Results: MMP-2, MMP-9 and MT1-MMP were expressed at both the mRNA and
   protein levels in tumor samples. MMP-2 and MMP-9 immunohistochemical
   reactions were evident both in the epithelial tumor cells and in the
   stromal compartment to varying degrees; in particular, the intensity of
   the MMP-2 staining was stronger in the stromal fibroblasts close to
   epithelial tumor cells in simple carcinomas than in adenomas. These data
   were supported by gelatin-zymography; bands for the active form of MMP-2
   were found in 94\% of carcinoma samples, compared with 17\% of benign
   tumor samples. The gene expression and immunohistochemical results for
   MT1-MMP were comparable to those for MMP-2. The immunoreactivity for
   MMP-13 and TIMP-2 was lower in carcinomas than in adenomas, confirming
   the mRNA data for MMP-13 and the other MMP inhibitors that were
   evaluated. The active form of MMP-9, but not the active form of MMP-2,
   was identified in the plasma of all of the tested dogs.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that MMP-9, MMP-2 and MT1-MMP, which
   are synthesized by epithelial cancer cells and cancer-associated
   fibroblasts, play an important role in malignant canine mammary tumors.
   The reduction of MMP-13 and TIMP-2 could also be a significant step in
   malignant transformation. MMP-2 and MT1-MMP could be further evaluated
   as future biomarkers for predicting the progression and prognosis of
   canine mammary tumors.},

Abstract = {The exogenous and pathogenic Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) coexists
   with highly related and biologically active endogenous retroviruses
   (enJSRVs). The endogenous enJS56A1 locus possesses a defective Gag
   polyprotein which blocks the late replication steps of related exogenous
   and endogenous retroviruses by a mechanism known as JSRV late
   restriction (JLR). Conversely, enJSRV-26, which most likely integrated
   into the sheep genome less than 200 years ago, is able to escape JLR. In
   this study, we demonstrate that the ability of enJSRV-26 to escape JLR
   is due to a single-amino-acid substitution in the signal peptide (SP) of
   its envelope glycoprotein. We show that enJSRV-26 SP does not localize
   to the nucleolus, unlike the functional SPs of related exogenous and
   endogenous sheep betaretroviruses. In addition, enJSRV-26 SP function as
   a post-transcriptional regulator of viral gene expression is impaired.
   enJSRV-26 JLR escape relies on the presence of the functional enJS56A1
   SP. Moreover, we show that the ratio between enJSRV-26 and enJS56A1 Gag
   is critical to elude JLR. Interestingly, we found that the domestic
   sheep has acquired, by genome amplification, several copies of the
   enJS56A1 provirus. These data further reinforce the notion that
   transdominant enJSRV proviruses have been positively selected in
   domestic sheep, and that the coevolution between endogenous and
   exogenous sheep betaretroviruses and their host is still occurring.},

Abstract = {Gene expression experiments were targeted in order to monitor the ABC
   efflux transporters, which is potentially involved in cellular
   detoxification/defense. Changes in expression levels of different ABC
   genes in kidney of Oncorhynchus mykiss fed with melamine and melamine +
   cyanuric acid enriched diets were recorded in both treated groups by
   mRNA Delta Delta(CT) relative quantification method. Expression profiles
   of eight different ABC genes basically showed low alterations in
   melamine group and more consistent changes in melamine + cyanuric acid
   treated fish, compared with own control. In the last group ABCC2 gene
   over expression was the more evident alteration. These results suggest
   that ABC efflux system could be involved in mobilization of hydrophilic
   molecules in the forcing condition of chronic exposure. (C) 2011

Abstract = {Newcastle disease (ND) remains a constant threat to the poultry industry
   and is a limiting disease for poultry producers worldwide. The variety
   of clinical presentations and the emergence and spread of new genetic
   variants make recognition and diagnosis challenging. The current review
   details the pertinent features of the clinicopathologic disease in the
   main susceptible species, including chicken, turkey, duck, goose,
   pigeon, and other birds such as cormorants, psittacines, and canaries.
   Furthermore, the available and emerging laboratory diagnostic
   methodologies for the detection and typing of the virus are reviewed,
   including traditional techniques such as virus isolation and
   immunohistochemistry as well as rapid procedures based on molecular
   tools, such as real-time polymerase chain reaction, gene sequencing, and
   microarrays. The relevant genetic variability of ND viruses probably
   represents the major limitation in the validation and application of the
   current, advanced diagnostic molecular techniques. This underscores the
   importance of a multidisciplinary and comprehensive diagnostic approach,
   which should include, next to the new generation assays of the genomic
   era, the more traditional techniques such as histopathology,
   immunohistochemistry, and virus isolation.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the national system for the notification and
   management of outbreaks of animal diseases in Italy (Sistema Informativo
   Nazionale Malattie Animali: SIMAN). The main objective of the system is
   to provide a tool for the management of epidemic emergencies and to
   fulfil the information obligations towards international organisations,
   such as the European Commission and World Organisation for Animal Health
   (Office International des Epizooties: OIE). SIMAN was thus designed to
   collect all relevant information on outbreaks of animal diseases and to
   provide a useful tool for the management of activities to be implemented
   in emergencies. SIMAN is able to collect and report information
   concerning suspected or confirmed animal outbreaks in a consistent way
   and allows veterinary services to enter data electronically, instead of
   using paperwork, within the framework of the process of e-government and
   dematerialisation of the administrative acts. Data are immediately
   accessible for local and national authorities. The system provides the
   relevant national authorities with information relative to the planning
   of control measures in case epidemic emergencies. SIMAN is part of the
   e-government process that involves all public administrations of the
   European Union (EU) and refers to the use of information and
   communication technologies for the digital processing of documents so as
   to simplify the system and to make administrative procedures on the
   Internet much easier to follow.},

Abstract = {The study provides data on two cases of foodborne botulism caused by
   consumption of commercial vegetable products: artichoke preserve and
   cream of vegetable soup. By mouse bioassay, Clostridium botulinum toxin
   in both the suspected food samples was detected and identified as type B
   toxin. The detection of C. botulinum toxin in the artichoke preserve
   indicates an inadequate food production technology while the presence of
   C. botulinum toxin in the vegetable soup appeared to be related to wrong
   behavior on the part of the consumer and to faulty food preservation.
   The study confirms that an early identification and reporting of
   suspected botulism cases is vital in the prevention of accidental
   widespread outbreaks.},

Abstract = {Food-borne diseases caused by Salmonella represent a worldwide public
   health problem. Salmonella must be absent in an established amount
   depending on the kind of the product and usually cultural methods have
   to be applied to evaluate the compliance of the products. ISO 6579:2002
   in Europe and FSIS MLG 4.04.:2008 in the USA have usually been employed
   to detect Salmonella in meat, poultry and egg products. A Real Time PCR
   method using probes has recently been validated against the NMKL (Nordic
   Committee on Food Analysis) standard method. This method has been
   modified using the less expensive Sybr Green Real Time PCR approach and
   applied directly in the 18 hours pre-enrichment broth for the purpose of
   detecting Salmonella in meat products in less than 24 hours. The purpose
   of this study was to:
   compare the effectiveness of ISO and FSIS cultural methods;
   develop a new 24 hour duplex Sybr Green Real Time PCR-melting curve
   analysis;
   evaluate the performance of Salmonella, Standard Method, Rapid Method,
   SYBR Green Real Time PCR.
   The equivalence between ISO and FSIS methods was demonstrated and the
   use of SYBR Green Real Time PCR as a screening tool for negative results
   seems appealing especially to evaluate compliance with the HACCP
   systems.},

Abstract = {We used serology to estimate the prevalence of exposure to chlamydiae in
   Italian populations of wild boars (Sus scrota). Sera from 173
   hunter-killed wild boars harvested during the 2006-2009 hunting seasons
   in three Italian regions were tested for antibodies to Chlamydia suis,
   Chlamydophila pecorum, Chlamydophila abortus, and Chlamydophila psittaci
   by the microimmunofluorescence test. Antibody titers to chlamydiae >=
   1.:32 were detected in 110 of the 17:3 samples tested (63.6\%). Specific
   reactivity could be assessed only in 44 sera with antibody titers to C.
   suis that were two- to threefold higher than antibody titers against the
   other chlamydial species; the other 66 sera had similar reactivity
   against all the chlamydia species tested. Antibody to C. suis was
   detected in sera from wild boar populations with rare or no known
   contact with domestic pigs. These results suggest that the wild boar
   could be a chlamydia reservoir and may acquire chlamydiae independent of
   contacts with the domestic pig.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine serological values of lysozyme,
   hemolytic complement levels (alternative pathway), and bactericidal
   activity of serum in turkeys kept in different rearing systems
   (industrial, backyard, and experimental). Results showed that the values
   for serum bactericidal activity and hemolytic complement levels
   increased with age, and their values were higher in experimental and in
   industrial turkeys than in turkeys reared in backyard. Lysozyme
   concentration showed a similar pattern; its value was higher in the
   industrial and experimental groups than in the backyard group. Data
   obtained suggest that rearing system can have an influence on the
   natural immune parameters considered; experimental and industrial groups
   showed a similar trend, differentiated from that observed in the
   backyard group. In the backyard group, the values observed may suggest
   that hybrid turkeys, selected for high production, have difficulty with
   being reared outside where predators (foxes and weasels) and weather
   conditions could be responsible for a stress situation.},

Title = {Mybl2 expression is under genetic control and contributes to determine a

Abstract = {Background \& Aims: MYBL2 is implicated in human malignancies and over
   expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We investigated Mybl2 role
   in the acquisition of susceptibility to HCC and tumor progression.
   Methods: MYBL2 mRNA and protein levels were evaluated by quantitative
   RT-PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. MYBL2 expression in HCC cell
   lines was controlled through MYBL2 cDNA or anti-MYBL2 siRNA
   transfection. Gene expression profile of cells transfected with MYBL2
   was analyzed by microarray.
   Results: Low induction of Mybl2 and its target Clusterin mRNAs, in
   low-grade dysplastic nodules (DN), progressively increased in fast
   growing high-grade ON and HCC of F344 rats, susceptible to
   hepatocarcinogenesis, whereas no/lower increases occurred in slow
   growing lesions of resistant BN rats. Highest Mybl2 protein activation,
   prevalently nuclear, occurred in F344 than BN lesions. Highest Mybl2,
   Clusterin, Cdc2, and Cyclin B1 expression occurred in fast progressing
   DN and HCC of E2f1 transgenics, compared to c-Myc transgenics, and
   anti-Mybl2 siRNA had highest anti-proliferative and apoptogenic effects
   in cell lines from HCC of E2f1 transgenics. MYBL2 transfected HepG2 and
   Huh7 cells exhibited increased cell proliferation and G1-S and G2-M cell
   cycle phases. The opposite occurred when MYBL2 was silenced by specific
   siRNA. MYBL2 transfection in Huh7 cells led to upregulation of genes
   involved in signal transduction, cell proliferation, cell motility, and
   downregulation of oncosuppressor and apoptogenic genes.
   Conclusions: mybl2 expression and activation are under genetic control.
   Mybl2 upregulation induces fast growth and progression of premalignant
   and malignant liver, through cell cycle deregulation and activation of
   genes and pathways related to tumor progression. (C) 2010 European

   geographical area, sex, and age were collected for statistical analysis
   of risk factors associated with infection. A seroprevalence of 8.5\% was
   found: 8.2\% of the animals were positive for anti-T. equi antibodies
   and 0.3\% for anti-B. caballi antibodies. No dual infections were
   observed. Of those horses with positive serology to T. equi, 33\% were
   also positive in PCR, whereas none of the seropositive horses for B.
   caballi was positive in PCR. No significant correlation between sex or

Title = {Determination of Microbial Diversity of Aeromonas Strains on the Basis

Abstract = {The genus Aeromonas has been described as comprising several species
   associated with the aquatic environment, which represents their
   principal reservoir. Aeromonas spp. are commonly isolated from diseased
   and healthy fish, but the involvement of such bacteria in human
   infection and gastroenteritis has frequently been reported. The primary
   challenge in establishing an unequivocal link between the Aeromonas
   genus and pathogenesis in humans is the extremely complicated taxonomy.
   With the aim of clarifying taxonomic relationships among the strains and
   phenotypes, a multilocus sequencing approach was developed and applied
   to characterize 23 type and reference strains of Aeromonas spp. and a
   collection of 77 field strains isolated from fish, crustaceans, and
   mollusks. All strains were also screened for putative determinants of
   virulence by PCR (ast, ahh1, act, asa1, eno, ascV, and aexT) and the
   production of acylated homoserine lactones (AHLs). In addition, the
   phenotypic fingerprinting obtained from 29 biochemical tests was
   submitted to the nonparametric combination (NPC) test methodology to
   define the statistical differences among the identified genetic
   clusters. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) achieved precise strain
   genotyping, and the phylogenetic analysis of concatenated sequences
   delineated the relationship among the taxa belonging to the genus
   Aeromonas, providing a powerful tool for outbreak traceability, host
   range diffusion, and ecological studies. The NPC test showed the
   feasibility of phenotypic differentiation among the majority of the MLST
   clusters by using a selection of tests or the entire biochemical
   fingerprinting. A Web-based MLST sequence database
   (http://pubmlst.org/aeromonas) specific for the Aeromonas genus was
   developed and implemented with all the results.},

Abstract = {An epidemiological survey on canine leishmaniasis (CanL) was performed
   during a 3-year period (2007-2009) in a public kennel of the Bologna
   province. The presence of the disease was shown in the canine population
   for the first time in 2007 by indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT).
   The parasite circulation was confirmed also by direct diagnostic tools,
   as PCR, cytology and cultural method, performed on different bioptic
   materials. The parasite was isolated and identified as Leishmania
   infantum zymodeme MON 1. The serological monitoring was performed also
   in 2008 and 2009 on animals that previously showed negative or uncertain
   results. The incidence values calculated by significant seroconversions
   in IFAT titre >= 1/160, ranged between 4.9\% and 6.6\%, indicating a
   stable focus of leishmaniasis. The entomological survey, performed by
   sticky and CO(2)-baited traps in 2008, showed the presence of the vector
   Phlebotomus perfiliewi. This study allowed us to identify a stable focus
   of CanL in an area that was not considered eco-compatible with the
   presence of the vector and infection. Our results confirm the northward
   spread of CanL towards areas not previously affected by autochthonous
   foci. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A minor role of CD4(+) T lymphocytes in the control of a primary
   infection of cattle with Mycoplasma mycoides subsp mycoides},
Journal = {VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {42},
Month = {JUN 12},
Abstract = {Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), caused by Mycoplasma mycoides
   subsp. mycoides, is an important livestock disease in Africa. The
   current control measures rely on a vaccine with limited efficacy and
   occasional severe side effects. Knowledge of the protective arms of
   immunity involved in this disease will be beneficial for the development
   of an improved vaccine. In previous studies on cattle infected with M.
   mycoides subsp. mycoides, a correlation was detected between the levels
   of mycoplasma-specific IFN-gamma-secreting CD4(+) T lymphocytes and
   reduced clinical signs. However, no cause and effect has been
   established, and the role of such cells and of protective responses
   acquired during a primary infection is not known.
   We investigated the role of CD4(+) T lymphocytes in CBPP by comparing
   disease patterns and post mortem findings between CD4(+) T cell depleted
   and non-depleted cattle. The depletion was carried out using several
   injections of BoCD4 specific murine monoclonal antibody on day 6 after
   experimental endotracheal infection with the strain Afade. All cattle
   were monitored clinically daily and sacrificed 28-30 days
   post-infection. Statistically significant but small differences were
   observed in the mortality rate between the depleted and non-depleted
   animals. However, no differences in clinical parameters (fever, signs of
   respiratory distress) and pathological lesions were observed, despite
   elimination of CD4(+) T cells for more than a week. The slightly higher
   mortality in the depleted group suggests a minor role of CD4(+) T cells
   in control of CBPP.},

Abstract = {Five cattle and five sheep that had never been exposed to bluetongue
   virus (BTV), as well as ten animals that had been experimentally
   infected with BTV-8, were inoculated with BTV-1. Previous exposure to
   BTV-8 did not prevent a second infection with another serotype.
   After the experiment, the BTV-1 preparation was found to be contaminated
   with BTV-15. The inoculum and blood samples taken during the experiment
   were analysed by serotype-specific real-time RT-PCR. There was 100-fold
   less BTV-15 than BTV-1 in the inoculum. Unexpectedly, BTV-15 dominated
   the infection in cattle that had previously been exposed to BTV-8. In
   sheep of both groups, on the other hand, BTV-1 prevailed over the
   contaminant.
   Regardless of the outcome, the incident demonstrates the need for a
   thorough contamination screening of virus preparations. For this
   purpose, two type-specific RT-PCR primer sets for each of the 24
   established BTV serotypes as well as Toggenburg Orbivirus were designed.

Abstract = {Trichinella pseudospiralis is a non-encapsulated species infecting both
   mammals and birds. In Italy, this parasite was reported only in two
   night-birds of prey of Central Italy. In January 2010, Trichinella
   larvae were detected in three wild boars (Sus scrofa) of two regions of
   Northern Italy by enzymatic digestion. The parasites were identified as
   T. pseudospiralis by multiplex-PCR. The first infected wild boar was
   hunted in the Emilia Romagna region and the other two infected wild
   boars were bred outdoors in a small family farm of the Friuli Venezia
   Giulia region. These new epidemiological data reinforce the role of the
   wild boar as the main reservoir of T. pseudospiralis in Europe. (C) 2011

Abstract = {Aims:
   To investigate the bacterial dynamics of a Caciotta cheese traditionally
   manufactured in the Montefeltro area (Central Italy) with raw cow's milk
   and an aqueous extract of dried flowers from Cynara cardunculus as a
   coagulating agent.
   Methods and Results:
   Conventional methods and a combined PCR-DGGE approach, relying on
   culture-dependent and -independent analyses, were used to investigate
   the cheese bacterial community, with a special focus on lactic acid
   bacteria. A heterogeneous population, including enterococci, lactococci,
   lactobacilli, food spoilage and other banal micro-organisms, was found.
   Significance and Impact of the Study:
   The study contributed to highlighting the influence of different
   technological parameters on bacterial dynamics of a raw milk Caciotta
   cheese coagulated with vegetable rennet.
   Conclusions:
   None of the species found in the vegetable rennet became dominant during
   the cheese-making and a prevailing role of the adventitions microbita
   coming from the raw milk and the dairy environment was highlighted.},

Abstract = {Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serotype 4,{[}5],12:i:- is an
   emerging serovar considered as a monophasic variant of Salmonella
   enterica serotype Typhimurium. The antigenic and genetic similarity
   between Salmonella 4,{[}5], 12: i:- and Salmonella Typhimurium suggests
   that they may behave in a similar way and represent a comparable threat
   to public health. As serotyping alone does not necessarily provide for
   identification of Salmonella 4,{[}5], 12: i:- and its differentiation
   from Salmonella Typhimurium, a method that combines traditional
   serotyping and a multiplex polymerase chain reaction has been tested on
   208 strains serotyped as Salmonella 4,{[}5], 12: i:-, Salmonella
   Typhimurium, and similar serovars of serogroup B sharing the same
   phase-1 antigen ``i.{''} For 191 strains, the combined method fully
   confirmed the results provided by traditional serotyping, whereas for 17
   strains of Salmonella 4,{[}5], 12: i:- and Salmonella Typhimurium some
   inconsistencies emerged between the two methods. The combined method
   resulted in a more accurate and faster identification of these two

Abstract = {A real-time PCR method to detect fish DNA in feedstuffs was developed
   and optimised. A combination of primers and a Taqman-MGB probe was used
   to selectively amplify the fish mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA gene.
   Qualitative and also quantitative assessments were performed with
   different protocols: a relative quantification by a standard curve, and
   a Delta C-T method, by total plant DNA as endogenous controls. Method
   specificity was evaluated analysing 40 different tissues (mammalians,
   avian, fish) and flour samples. Sensitivity was evaluated by LOD (limit
   of detection) estimation. The designed probe-primers set showed an
   increased sensitivity compared to previously published PCR end point
   method, reaching a limit of detection of 0.2 pg of fish DNA, and showing
   to be a robust assay for fish DNA detection. The quantification results,
   based on Delta C-T method and the relative standard curve, are well
   reproducible in our experimental condition but, in lacking of separate
   pure raw materials of a tested feed, they cannot be applied for reliable
   and precise quantification on field samples but for now as a
   semi-quantitative PCR method only. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   gene expression profile in mouse hippocampus. Physiol Genomics 43:
   711-725, 2011. First published March 15, 2011;
   doi:10.1152/physiolgenomics.00205.2010.-The conversion of the cellular
   prion protein (PrPC) to an abnormal and protease-resistant isoform is
   the key event in prion diseases. Mice lacking PrPC are resistant to
   prion infection, and downregulation of PrPC during prion infection
   prevents neuronal loss and the progression to clinical disease. These
   results are suggestive of the potential beneficial effect of silencing
   PrPC during prion diseases. However, the silencing of a protein that is
   widely expressed throughout the central nervous system could be
   detrimental to brain homeostasis. The physiological role of PrPC remains
   still unclear, but several putative functions (e. g., neuronal
   development and maintenance) have been proposed. To assess the influence
   of PrPC on gene expression profile in the mouse brain, we undertook a
   microarray analysis by using RNA isolated from the hippocampus at two
   different developmental stages: newborn (4.5-day-old) and adult
   (3-mo-old) mice, both from wild-type and Prnp(0/0) animals. Comparing
   the different datasets allowed us to identify ``commonly{''}
   co-regulated genes and ``uniquely{''} deregulated genes during postnatal
   development. The absence of PrPC affected several biological pathways,
   the most representative being cell signaling, cell-cell communication
   and transduction processes, calcium homeostasis, nervous system
   development, synaptic transmission, and cell adhesion. However, there
   was only a moderate alteration of the gene expression profile in our
   animal models. PrPC deficiency did not lead to a dramatic alteration of
   gene expression profile and produced moderately altered gene expression
   levels from young to adult animals. Thus, our results may provide
   additional support to silencing endogenous PrPC levels as therapeutic
   approach to prion diseases.},

Abstract = {West Nile virus (WNV) was detected in Italy, in late summer 2008 in
   horses and birds in the Po valley. As a consequence, an intense WNV
   surveillance was implemented in that area involving Emilia-Romagna,
   Veneto and Lombardy. This paper presents the results of the September
   2008-November 2009 surveillance on equines, mosquitoes, wild birds, dogs
   and cattle in Veneto. WNV was detected in equines and dogs, and, to a
   lesser extent in cattle and wild birds. Simultaneous circulation of
   Usutu virus was detected by testing wild birds found dead. Usutu virus
   but not WNV was also found in mosquitoes monitored during 2009. Equine
   practices monitoring allowed the definition of an area of WNV
   circulation and the 2008-2009 westward and northward spread of the
   infection. Although a relatively low number of human cases and a low
   virus circulation in vectors and birds detected in Veneto region could
   be considered favourable conditions for a limited risk of human
   exposure, it remains difficult to predict the possible evolution of the
   epidemiological situation.},

Abstract = {P>Surveillance programmes for low pathogenicity (LPAI) and high
   pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) infections in poultry are
   compulsory for EU Member States; yet, these programmes have rarely been
   evaluated. In Italy, following a 1999 HPAI epidemic, control measures,
   including vaccination and monitoring, were implemented in the densely
   populated poultry area (DPPA) where all epidemics in Italy have been
   concentrated. We evaluated the monitoring system for its capacity to
   detect outbreaks rapidly in meat-type turkey flocks. The evaluation was
   performed in vaccination areas and high-risk areas in the DPPA, in
   2000-2005, during which four epidemics occurred. Serum samples and
   cloacal swabs were taken from vaccinated birds and unvaccinated
   (sentinel) birds. We compared the detection rate of active, passive and
   targeted surveillance, by vaccination status, using multinomial logistic
   regression. A total of 13 275 samplings for serological testing and 4889
   samplings for virological testing were performed; 6315 production cycles
   of different bird species were tested. The outbreaks detection rate in
   meat-type turkeys was 61\% for active surveillance (n = 222/363
   outbreaks), 32\% for passive surveillance and 7\% for targeted
   surveillance. The maximum likelihood predicted values for the detection
   rates differed by vaccination status: in unvaccinated flocks, it was
   50\% for active surveillance, 40\% for passive surveillance and 10\% for
   targeted surveillance, compared to respectively 79\%, 17\% and 4\% for
   vaccinated flocks. Active surveillance seems to be most effective in
   detecting infection, especially when a vaccination programme is in
   place. This is the first evaluation of the effectiveness of different
   types of surveillance in monitoring LPAI infections in vaccinated
   poultry using field data.},

Abstract = {Three discrete regions of the African swine fever virus (ASFV) were
   analysed in the genomes of a wide range of isolates collected from wild
   and domestic pigs in Sardinia, over a 31-year period (1978-2009). The
   analysis was conducted by genotyping based on sequence data from three
   single copy ASF genes. The E183L gene encoding the structural protein
   p54 and part of the gene encoding the p72 protein were used to delineate
   genotypes, before intra-genotypic resolution of viral relationships by
   analysis of tetramer amino acid repeats within the hypervariable central
   variable region (CVR) of the B602L gene. The data revealed that these
   isolates did not show significant variation in their p72 and p54
   sequence when compared between different isolates showing a remarkable
   genetic stability of these genome regions. In particular, the phylogeny
   revealed that all the Sardinian isolates belong to the same largest and
   most homogeneous p72 genotype I together with viruses from Europe, South
   America, the Caribbean and West Africa, and p54 genotype Ia which
   comprises viruses from Europe and America. The analysis of B602L gene
   revealed a minor difference in the number of tetramer repeats, placing
   the Sardinian isolates into two clusters, accordingly to their temporal
   distribution, namely sub-group III and sub-group X, this latter showing
   a deletion of 12 tetramer repeats located in the centre of the array.
   The genetic variation of this fragment suggests that one sub-group could
   be derived from the other supporting the hypothesis of a single
   introduction of ASFV in Sardinia.},

Abstract = {P>The present report describes the haematological and serological
   findings observed in a dairy sheep farm during an aborting outbreak.
   Fifty ewes divided into two groups were included in the study: group A
   consisted of 35 healthy ewes and group B consisted of 15 ill subjects.
   From each ewe, blood samples were collected for microscopic examination
   and serological assay. After 3 months, all ewes were subjected to
   microscopic examination, serological and biochemical assay.
   Morula-containing granulocytes characteristic of A. phagocytophilum was
   observed in all animals of group B. Antibodies against A.
   phagocytophilum were observed in only one animal of group A.
   Seroconversion was observed after 3 months in five ewes of group A and
   all animals of group B. Only one subject with negative serology was
   positive to PCR. Our results confirm the endemicity of sheep tick-borne
   fever (TBF) in Sicily and the problem to breeding in an endemic area. We
   suggest that is necessary to combine the different assays depending on
   the stage of infection for a correct diagnosis in endemic areas.
   Periodic evaluation of seroconversion could be helpful to evaluate the
   progression of TBF in a flock.},

Abstract = {2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME) is a cytotoxic drug that interacts with tubulin
   and alters microtubule dynamics. It has been reported that testosterone
   (T) has a neuroprotective effect against oxidative stress and induces
   differentiation in mouse C1300 neuroblastoma cells. Here, we
   investigated the ability of T to attenuate the cytotoxic effects of 2ME
   and to induce cell differentiation in an immortalized rat glial cell
   line, known as C6. C6 cells were exposed for 5 days to 5 mu M 2ME, 50 nM
   T, or both. We evaluated the morphological changes, growth rate,
   vitality, catalase activity, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)
   immunoreactivity in control and treated C6 cells. Western blot analyses
   were used to quantify expression of tyrosinated tubulin (Tyr-Tub),
   acetylated tubulin (Acet-Tub), total alpha-tubulin (TOT-Tub), and GFAP.
   After 2ME exposure, the cells displayed a globular, shrunken shape, and
   retraction or absence of cytoplasmic processes; moreover, 2ME treatment
   significantly decreased cell growth, cell viability, catalase activity,
   and expression of both Tyr-Tub and Acet-Tub. However, when T was added,
   the cells exhibited a glial-like shape, elongated cell processes, and
   enhanced cell growth, cell vitality, catalase activity, and GFAP
   immunoreactivity. Densitometric values of Tyr-Tub, Acet-Tub, and GFAP
   increased significantly when T was present, while Tot-Tub values were
   unaltered. These results indicate that, in C6 cells, T: (i) attenuated
   the morpho-functional changes caused by 2ME exposure; (ii) induced glial
   differentiation; and (iii) exerted a direct action on the microtubule
   system. J. Cell. Physiol. 226: 1510-1518, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss,

Title = {Downer cow syndrome: clinical diagnostic monitoring system in Piedmont},
Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2011},

Pages = {83-88},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Downer cow syndrome is a bovine multifactorial disease characterized by
   the inability to rise to a standing position and to keep a quadrupedal
   walking with a consequent prolonged or permanent recumbency. Given the
   complexity of the syndrome and the multiplicity of causes, including the
   BSE, a systematic analysis of the condition is essential in order to
   reach a definitive diagnosis and to properly manage animals in the herd.
   The aim of the present study was to investigate downer cow syndrome in a
   small area of Piedmont, including Torino and Cuneo, through a precise
   diagnostic procedure in life and post-mortem. From March 2009 to
   February 2010, 103 downer cows were reported by 8 veterinarians applying
   a standard clinical protocol, followed by appropriate laboratory tests.
   Reported cases refer mainly Friesian cows with metabolic disorders in
   the peripartum period. A complete necropsy, organ-tissue-CNS sampling
   for histopathological examination and further investigations were
   performed on dead or euthanized cattle. Forty-six cows were cured, 20
   were slaughtered and 37 died. Thirteen cows, 4 dead naturally and 9
   euthanized were further investigated by necropsy, histological
   examination and bacteriology. All cases showed inflammatory lesions in
   the main organs and tissues. In 3 cases histopathological lesions
   (suppurative inflammations) were found in the CNS. The implementation of
   this surveillance network and the establishment of active partnerships
   between public authorities and private veterinarians is the goal of a
   correct management of the problem in the farm in order to provide
   specialist support to the farmer to safeguard animals' health and
   welfare as well as public health.},

Journal = {ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {58},
Number = {4},
Pages = {262-269},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {P>The prevalence of Salmonella infection was determined in a group of
   spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca) seized during two smuggling
   attempts and in a population of captive Hermann's tortoises (Testudo
   hermanni) sheltered in a wildlife rescue centre. Salmonella spp. was
   isolated in 81 of 220 (36.8\%) and in 17 of 67 (25.4\%) cloacal swabs
   collected from the T. graeca and T. hermanni tortoises respectively.
   Overall, a total of 21 different Salmonella serotypes were found. Some
   of these serotypes are common to terrestrial chelonians while others
   have never been reported. All cultured serotypes were non-typhoidal but
   nonetheless many of these have been previously reported as source of
   human outbreaks of reptile-related salmonellosis. Eighty-two per cent
   and 5.3\% of the isolates were resistant to two and three anti-microbial
   agents respectively. However, the isolates were highly susceptible to
   the anti-microbials of choice for the treatment of salmonellosis such as
   cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. Our findings confirm that tortoises
   can be considered a reservoir for Salmonella and that care should be
   employed when handling and breeding these animals. Tight surveillance
   should be enforced to avoid illegal importation and prevent the trading
   of live tortoises, carriers of zoonotic pathogens.},

Title = {Porcine Circovirus type 2 (PCV2) associated diseases},
Journal = {LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {89-98},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {To date, PCV2 infection in domestic pigs and wild boars is widespread
   worldwide and has been associated with several syndromes, collectively
   called porcine circovirus diseases (PCVD). They include: postweaning
   multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), porcine dermatitis and
   nephropathy (PDNS), and, in some cases, porcine respiratory disease
   complex (PRDC).
   PMWS only is considered to have the higher economic impact on pig farms.
   It is considered a multifactorial disease in which PCV2, in combination
   with other factors, is able to determine the clinical signs of the
   disease. Its main clinical signs were observed in piglets and in
   fattening pigs; wasting is considered to be the major one. This syndrome
   is diagnosed by detection of histopathological lesions typical of
   lymphoid tissues and the simultaneous presence of PCV2 antigen.
   PDNS is a disease characterized by immuno-complexes, fibrino-necrotizing
   glomerulonephritis and necrotizing vasculitis. These lesions are
   associated with PCV2, but to date the pathogenetic role of the virus in
   the development of such lesions has not yet been demonstrated.
   As to PRDC, the identification of PCV2 in the lungs suggested that the
   virus could play a kay role in determining it, especially in the
   presence of a low prevalence of other viral pathogens and/or bacterial.
   Currently, the clinical signs of PRDC are highly variable and
   nonspecific. Three vaccines are now available in Europe. Two of them are
   to be used for piglets only, while the third one is lincensed for both
   sows and piglets.},

Abstract = {The fraudulent treatment of cattle with growth promoting agents (GPAs)
   is a matter of great concern for the European Union (EU) authorities and
   consumers. It has been estimated that 10\% of animals are being
   illegally treated in the EU. In contrast, only a much lower percentage
   of animals (< 0.5\%) are actually found as being noncompliant by
   conventional analytical methods. Thus, it has been proposed that methods
   should be developed that can detect the use of the substances via the
   biological effects of these substances on target organs, such as the
   alteration of protein expression profiles. Here we present a study aimed
   at evaluating if a correlation exists between the treatment with GPAs
   and alterations in the two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) protein
   pattern obtained from the biceps brachii skeletal muscle from mixed-bred
   cattle. After image analysis and statistical evaluation, protein spots
   that differentiate between treated and control groups were selected for
   analysis by mass spectrometry. A set of proteins could be defined that
   accurately detect the use of glucocorticoids and beta(2)-agonists as
   growth promoters through the changes caused in muscle differentiation.
   As a further validation, we repeated the analysis using an independent
   set of samples from a strain of pure-bred cattle and verified these
   proteins by Western blot analysis.},

Abstract = {Objectives: This study was initiated to collect retrospective
   information on the occurrence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance
   (PMQR) in Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli isolates in Europe
   and to identify the responsible genes.
   Methods: Databases of national reference laboratories containing MIC
   values for Salmonella and E. coli isolated between 1994 and 2009 in
   animals, humans, food and the environment from 13 European countries
   were screened for isolates exhibiting a defined quinolone resistance
   phenotype, i.e. reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and nalidixic
   acid. PCR and sequence analysis were performed to identify the
   responsible PMQR genes.
   Results: Screening of databases of 13 European countries resulted in a
   selection of 1215 Salmonella and 333 E. coli isolates. PMQR genes were
   identified in 59\% of the Salmonella isolates and 15\% of the E. coli
   isolates selected. In Salmonella, qnrS1 (n = 125) and variants of qnrB
   (n = 138) were frequently identified, whereas qnrA1 (n = 3) and
   aac(6')-1b-cr (n = 3) were rarely found. qnrD was detected in 22
   Salmonella isolates obtained from humans and animals. In E. coli, qnrS1
   was identified in 19 isolates and qnrB19 was found in one isolate. No
   qnrC or qepA genes were detected in either Salmonella or E. coli.
   Conclusions: This study shows the occurrence and dissemination of PMQR
   genes in Salmonella and E. coli in Europe with a defined quinolone
   resistance phenotype. We also report the first detection of qnrD in
   Salmonella collected in Europe.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 18},
Abstract = {Despite their importance for the spread of zoonotic diseases, our
   understanding of the dynamical aspects characterizing the movements of
   farmed animal populations remains limited as these systems are
   traditionally studied as static objects and through simplified
   approximations. By leveraging on the network science approach, here we
   are able for the first time to fully analyze the longitudinal dataset of
   Italian cattle movements that reports the mobility of individual animals
   among farms on a daily basis. The complexity and inter-relations between
   topology, function and dynamical nature of the system are characterized
   at different spatial and time resolutions, in order to uncover patterns
   and vulnerabilities fundamental for the definition of targeted
   prevention and control measures for zoonotic diseases. Results show how
   the stationarity of statistical distributions coexists with a strong and
   non-trivial evolutionary dynamics at the node and link levels, on all
   timescales. Traditional static views of the displacement network hide
   important patterns of structural changes affecting nodes' centrality and
   farms' spreading potential, thus limiting the efficiency of
   interventions based on partial longitudinal information. By fully taking
   into account the longitudinal dimension, we propose a novel definition
   of dynamical motifs that is able to uncover the presence of a temporal
   arrow describing the evolution of the system and the causality patterns
   of its displacements, shedding light on mechanisms that may play a
   crucial role in the definition of preventive actions.},

Title = {Sometimes Sperm Whales (Physeter macrocephalus) Cannot Find Their Way
   Back to the High Seas: A Multidisciplinary Study on a Mass Stranding},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {Background: Mass strandings of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus)
   remain peculiar and rather unexplained events, which rarely occur in the
   Mediterranean Sea. Solar cycles and related changes in the geomagnetic
   field, variations in water temperature and weather conditions, coast
   geographical features and human activities have been proposed as
   possible causes. In December 2009, a pod of seven male sperm whales
   stranded along the Adriatic coast of Southern Italy. This is the sixth
   instance from 1555 in this basin.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Complete necropsies were performed on
   three whales whose bodies were in good condition, carrying out on
   sampled tissues histopathology, virology, bacteriology, parasitology,
   and screening of veins looking for gas emboli. Furthermore, samples for
   age determination, genetic studies, gastric content evaluation, stable
   isotopes and toxicology were taken from all the seven specimens. The
   animals were part of the same group and determined by genetic and
   photo-identification to be part of the Mediterranean population. Causes
   of death did not include biological agents, or the ``gas and fat embolic
   syndrome{''}, associated with direct sonar exposure. Environmental
   pollutant tissue concentrations were relatively high, in particular
   organochlorinated xenobiotics. Gastric content and morphologic tissue
   examinations showed a prolonged starvation, which likely caused, at its
   turn, the mobilization of lipophilic contaminants from the adipose
   tissue. Chemical compounds subsequently entered the blood circulation
   and may have impaired immune and nervous functions.
   Conclusions/Significance: A multi-factorial cause underlying this sperm
   whales' mass stranding is proposed herein based upon the results of
   postmortem investigations as well as of the detailed analyses of the
   geographical and historical background. The seven sperm whales took the
   same ``wrong way{''} into the Adriatic Sea, a potentially dangerous trap
   for Mediterranean sperm whales. Seismic surveys should be also regarded
   as potential co-factors, even if no evidence of direct impact has been
   detected.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic
   freshwaters has been described all over the world, including most
   European countries. Blooms of cyanobacteria may produce mixtures of
   toxic secondary metabolites, called cyanotoxins. Among these, the most
   studied are microcystins, a group of cyclic heptapeptides, because of
   their potent hepatotoxicity and activity as tumour promoters. Other
   peptide cyanotoxins have been described whose structure and toxicity
   have not been thoroughly studied.
   Herein we present a peptidomic approach aimed to characterise and
   quantify the peptide cyanotoxins produced in two Italian lakes, Averno
   and Albano. The procedure was based on matrix-assisted laser
   desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry mass spectrometry
   (MALDI-TOF-MS) analysis for rapid detection and profiling of the peptide
   mixture complexity, combined with liquid chromatography/electrospray
   ionisation quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry
   (LC/ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS) which provided unambiguous structural
   identification of the main compounds, as well as accurate quantitative
   analysis of microcystins. In the case of Lake Averno, a novel variant of
   microcystin-RR and two novel anabaenopeptin variants (Anabaenopeptins
   B-1 and Anabaenopeptin F-1), presenting homoarginine in place of the
   commonly found arginine, were detected and characterised. In Lake
   Albano, the peculiar peptide patterns in different years were compared,
   as an example of the potentiality of the peptidomic approach for fast
   screening analysis, prior to fine structural analysis and determination
   of cyanotoxins, which included six novel aeruginosin variants. This
   approach allows for wide range monitoring of cyanobacteria blooms, and
   to collect data for evaluating possible health risks to consumers,
   through the panel of the compounds produced along different years.

Abstract = {Canine distemper virus (CDV) infection represents an important
   conservation threat to many carnivore species and has contributed to the
   population decline of several wild terrestrial and aquatic mammalian
   species. Since 2006, the Alpine region of North-Eastern (NE) Italy has
   been experiencing a severe and widespread outbreak of CDV affecting the
   wild carnivore population. In this study we performed an extensive
   phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analysis of CDV identified
   during the recent wildlife epidemic in the Alpine region. Our analysis
   yielded data on the evolutionary dynamics of the Alpine wildlife CDV
   epidemic and revealed the emergence and spread of a single genetic
   cluster of CDV. The wide distribution of the novel cluster combined with
   the identification of a specific amino acid mutation, which is believed
   to increase the ability of the virus to replicate in a wider host range,
   raises concerns over the possible implications of the spread of this
   virus on the conservation of endangered wildlife species. (C) 2011

Abstract = {Salmonella enterica serovar Gallinarum is the causative agent of fowl
   typhoid, a severe disease of poultry, responsible for heavy economic
   losses. Epidemiologic investigation of fowl typhoid significantly
   benefits from molecular typing tools, RAPD and PFGE have been proposed
   for this purpose. PFGE, a well established technique, is still the gold
   standard among typing methods for most bacteria, including salmonella.
   Nevertheless, it has some limitations regarding execution and
   reproducibility, in particular it is labour intensive and requires good
   technical expertise. Furthermore, it needs accurate standardization and
   results can be ambiguous to interpret. Such limitations can hamper
   reproducibility and transfer of results. As a possible alternative to
   PFGE, multilocus variable-number of tandem-repeats analysis (MLVA) has
   recently emerged as an effective genotyping method for many bacterial
   pathogens showing high discriminatory power associated to robustness. We
   developed a six-loci MLVA protocol for Salmonella Gallinarum and
   compared it to PFGE performed with Spel, Xbal and Notl on fifty
   isolates. The proposed MLVA has a high discriminatory power, equivalent
   to that of the three-enzyme PFGE (Simpson's index 0.94 for MLVA, 0.93
   for three-enzyme PFGE) but it is simpler to perform and straightforward
   in genotype identification, allowing unambiguous exchange of results.
   Stability of selected VNTR loci, assessed in vitro and in vivo, is good
   but not absolute, reflecting the sensitivity of MLVA to detect
   evolutionary changes of bacteria. Clustering of the isolates as
   determined by MLVA typing is substantially confirmed by PFGE. (C) 2010

Abstract = {Swine influenza monitoring programs have been in place in Italy since
   the 1990s and from 2009 testing for the pandemic H1N1/2009 virus
   (H1N1pdm) was also performed on all the swine samples positive for type
   A influenza. This paper reports the isolation and genomic
   characterization of a novel H1N2 swine influenza reassortant strain from
   pigs in Italy that was derived from the H1N1pdm virus.
   In May 2010, mild respiratory symptoms were observed in around 10\% of
   the pigs raised on a fattening farm in Italy. Lung homogenate taken from
   one pig showing respiratory distress was tested for influenza type A and
   H1N1pdm by two real time RT-PCR assays. Virus isolation was achieved by
   inoculation of lung homogenate into specific pathogen free chicken
   embryonated eggs (SPF CEE) and applied onto Caco-2 cells and then the
   complete genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis was performed from
   the CEE isolate.
   The lung homogenate proved to be positive for both influenza type A
   (gene M) and H1N1pdm real time RT-PCRs. Virus isolation
   (A/Sw/It/116114/2010) was obtained from both SPF CEE and Caco-2 cells.
   Phylogenetic analysis showed that all of the genes of
   A/Sw/It/116114/2010, with the exception of neuraminidase (NA), belonged
   to the H1N1pdm cluster. The NA was closely related to two H1N2 double
   reassortant swine influenza viruses (SIVs), previously isolated in
   Sweden and Italy. NA sequences for these three strains were clustering
   with H3N2 SIVs. The emergence of a novel reassortant H1N2 strain derived
   from H1N1pdm in swine in Italy raises further concerns about whether
   these viruses will become established in pigs. The new reassortant not
   only represents a pandemic (zoonotic) threat but also has unknown
   livestock implications for the European swine industry. (C) 2011

Abstract = {Rapid tests specific for sheep and goats became part of European
   Union-wide active scrapie surveillance in 2006. Performance of three
   approved TSE rapid tests for the detection of sheep infected with
   scrapie in field cases in the pre-clinical stage of the disease was
   compared.
   The medulla oblongata of 969 asymptomatic sheep of various genotype and
   breed aged over 18 months from 23 Italian flocks affected with scrapie,
   were tested by the Bio-Rad TeSeE Sheep/Goat (A), the IDEXX HerdChek
   BSE-Scrapie Antigen Test Kit, EiA (B) and the Prionics (R)-Check Western
   Small Ruminant (C) rapid tests.
   Of 136 positive samples of classical scrapie, as confirmed by Western
   blot assay, 132 were positive with test A (Se 97.06\%, CI 95\%
   92.64-99.19); 135 with test B (Se 99.26\%, 95\% CI 95.97-99.98) and 128
   with test C (Se 94.12\%, 95\% CI 88.74-97.43).
   Tests A and B showed the best performance on analytical sensitivity. All
   three systems demonstrated good reproducibility: being the intrarater
   and interrater kappa coefficients always over 0.83.
   The one available atypical scrapie sample was positive with tests A and
   B, negative with test C. Considering the discrepant results in the
   detection of low PrPsc concentrations and of the atypical case,
   differences can be expected in the efficacy of an active surveillance
   system, depending on the test adopted. Published by Elsevier B.V.},
