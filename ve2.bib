Abstract = {{Recombination in Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus
   (PRRSV) is a well-documented phenomenon. A high recombination frequency
   has been reported in experimental conditions both in vitro and in vivo,
   and its role in driving viral evolution has been postulated by several
   authors. However field evidences are rare, mainly obtained from
   large-scale sampling and typically represented by single sequences
   rather than by groups of circulating ``recombinant progenies{''}. The
   present work was aimed to investigate the gray area between experimental
   studies and large-scale epidemiological investigations. The study was
   performed on ORF5, ORF7 and concatenated sequences obtained in our
   laboratory or available in GenBank collected between 2009 and 2012 in
   northern Italy. Six independent recombinant strains out of 66
   concatenated sequences (similar to 9\%) were found, demonstrating a high
   recombination frequency respect to previous field studies but comparable
   to in vitro experiments. In silico analysis let speculate that this new
   strain displayed physicochemical features diverse enough to potentially
   alter its immunological properties. Taken altogether, the results of our
   study support previous experimental evidences that depict PRRSV to be
   extremely prone to recombination. The limited temporal and geographical
   spread of recombinant strains however states in favor of a limited
   fitness of the recombinant progeny compared to parental strains and the
   marginal role of this phenomenon in PRRSV evolution. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{Comparative structural analysis of haemagglutinin proteins from type A
   influenza viruses: conserved and variable features}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Genome variation is very high in influenza A viruses.
   However, viral evolution and spreading is strongly influenced by
   immunogenic features and capacity to bind host cells, depending in turn
   on the two major capsidic proteins. Therefore, such viruses are
   classified based on haemagglutinin and neuraminidase types, e. g. H5N1.
   Current analyses of viral evolution are based on serological and primary
   sequence comparison; however, comparative structural analysis of
   capsidic proteins can provide functional insights on surface regions
   possibly crucial to antigenicity and cell binding.
   Results: We performed extensive structural comparison of influenza virus
   haemagglutinins and of their domains and subregions to investigate type-
   and/or domain-specific variation. We found that structural closeness and
   primary sequence similarity are not always tightly related; moreover,
   type- specific features could be inferred when comparing surface
   properties of haemagglutinin subregions, monomers and trimers, in terms
   of electrostatics and hydropathy. Focusing on H5N1, we found that
   variation at the receptor binding domain surface intriguingly relates to
   branching of still circulating clades from those ones that are no longer
   circulating.
   Conclusions: Evidence from this work suggests that integrating
   phylogenetic and serological analyses by extensive structural comparison
   can help in understanding the `functional evolution' of viral surface
   determinants. In particular, variation in electrostatic and hydropathy
   patches can provide molecular evolution markers: intriguing surface
   charge redistribution characterizing the haemagglutinin receptor binding
   domains from circulating H5N1 clades 2 and 7 might have contributed to
   antigenic escape hence to their evolutionary success and spreading.}},

Title = {{Food allergies in school: design and evaluation of a teacher-oriented
   training action}},
Journal = {{ITALIAN JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{40}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Food allergies are perceived as a significant problem in
   school environments; as a result, a teacher's ability to recognise and
   deal with allergic reactions is of fundamental importance to protect
   children's health. This paper includes the results of a study conducted
   for the purposes of designing, implementing and monitoring a specific
   set of teacher-oriented communication actions.
   Methods: The study involved designing, implementing and assessing five
   workshops. These workshops were designed on the basis of the analysis of
   perceptions and information needs investigated by three focus groups (25
   teachers). The level of the teachers' knowledge and appreciation of the
   workshops was evaluated by using two structured questionnaires (n =
   158).
   Results: The teachers feel that they are insufficiently informed about
   food allergies; this knowledge gap is confirmed by an analysis of their
   knowledge before participating in the workshops. According to the
   teachers, the information which would be most useful to them has to do
   with the practical management of allergies in school. They feel that
   there is a lack of a professional contact person for precise and
   reliable information on health issues. The workshops seem to be
   appreciated as an information method. In addition, there appears to be a
   need to involve all children in awareness raising activities and
   education projects on this subject.
   Conclusions: There is an urgent need for training actions on food
   allergies in Italian schools, in particular the communication of
   practical information regarding the management of allergies and
   emergencies. More communication between the medical and school staff is,
   in particular, advisable.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of blood and bone marrow in selected canine vector-borne
   diseases}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Bone marrow (BM) is a major hematopoietic organ that can
   harbour a variety of vector-borne pathogens; however, knowledge of BM
   pathological changes in dogs infected with vector-borne pathogens is
   limited. Thus, the aim of the present study was to assess the
   pathological changes in canine BM associated with natural infections by
   four vector-borne pathogens, as well as to determine the relationships
   between such changes and abnormalities of the peripheral blood.
   Methods: Cytological disorders and pathological changes of the BM of 83
   dogs naturally-infected with one or more of four vector-borne pathogens
   (i.e., Anaplasma platys, Leishmania infantum, Babesia vogeli and
   Hepatozoon canis) were evaluated and compared with the corresponding
   hematological findings.
   Results: Dysgranulopoiesis and dysmegakaryocytopoiesis were the most
   frequently observed BM abnormalities in infected dogs. Erythroid
   suppression, and lymphocytic, monocytic and macrophage hyperplasia were
   also observed. Interestingly, associations between suppression and
   hyperplasia of specific cell lines in the marrow and corresponding
   changes in numbers of circulating peripheral blood cells were not
   observed.
   Conclusions: Infections with one or more of the vector-borne pathogens
   examined in this study should be considered as differential diagnoses
   for secondary dysmyelopoiesis.}},

Volume = {{202}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Equine piroplasmosis (EP) has been frequently described in donkeys in
   subtropical and tropical regions, but published data reflecting large
   scale surveys are very limited in Europe. The seroprevalence of Babesia
   caballi and Theileria equi was determined in a donkey population from
   Campania Region in Southern Italy using a commercial indirect
   fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), and the risk factors associated with
   the occurrence of the infection were assessed.
   Of 203 samples, the overall seroprevalence for EP was 57.1\% (116/203),
   with 35.5\% (72/203) for B. caballi and 44.3\% (90/203) for T. equi.
   Co-infection was detected in 46 donkeys (22.6\%). The distribution of
   IFAT antibody titres to B. caballi was: 1:80 (n=67), 1:160 (n=2), 1:320
   (n=3); while the distribution of IFAT antibody titres to T. equi was:
   1:80 (n=25), 1:160 (n=42), 1:320 (n=12), 1:640 (n=8), 1:1280 (n=3). All
   examined donkeys were asymptomatic, except one adult male (with a titre
   of 1:640 against T. equi) that showed clinical signs corresponding to
   the acute stage of EP, reported for the first time in Italy.
   The unique risk factor associated with a higher B. caballi
   seroprevalence was the presence of horses in the farms, while risk
   factors associated with a higher T. equi seroprevalence were poor body
   condition, presence of ruminants in the farms and milk production. The
   results indicate a high level of exposure in donkeys living in Southern
   Italy and suggest that donkeys may be an important reservoir of EP. (C)

Abstract = {{Reproduction in dairy cows is based around the use of cryopreserved
   semen. Antibiotics are utilized to control bacterial contamination and
   growth in cryopreserved bull semen. The antibiotic resistance of some
   bacteria required the evaluation of new antibiotic combinations with a
   high level of antibacterial effectiveness and a negligible effect on
   spermatozoa. In this research, we studied the effect of the fluorinate
   carboxyquinolone ofloxacin and the combination of ceftiofur/tylosin on
   bull spermatozoa and in-field bacterial growth. In Experiment 1, the
   toxicity of different levels of ofloxacin and ceftiofur/tylosin was
   tested by the incubation of bull spermatozoa and the evaluation of sperm
   kinetic parameters, membranes and acrosome integrity after dilution, and
   at 60 and 120 min after incubation. The data reported in this study
   reveals that both antibiotic combinations, at all concentrations, seem
   to have a negligible effect on spermatozoa with respect to all of the
   parameters examined (p >0.05). Furthermore, progressive motility was
   significantly higher for sperm diluted with both antibiotic combinations
   compared with samples without antibiotics (p <0.01).
   In Experiment 2, the ability of ofloxacin or ceftiofur/tylosin to
   control bacterial growth during bovine semen cryopreservation was
   compared with the combination of
   gentamicin/tylosin/spectinomycin/lincomycin. A significant reduction in
   progressive motility was found in cooled semen with respect to all of
   the antibiotic treatments (p <0.05). However, the membrane integrity was
   found to significantly rise in frozen samples with, compared to samples
   without, antibiotics (p <0.05). In a bull, gentamicin, tylosin,
   spectinomycin, and lincomycin failed to control bacterial growth in the
   cryopreserved sample, while no such growth was found in samples extended
   with ceftiofur/tylosin or ofloxacin. In conclusion, both
   ceftiofur/tylosin and ofloxacin can be safely added to bull seminal
   extenders, and both can protect insemination doses from bacteria that
   are resistant to other antibiotic combinations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

   current matter of study, owing to the recurrent production breakdowns
   reported in Europe and other regions of the world. In the frame of
   Project FP7-KBBE-2010-4 BIVALIFE, we investigated the occurrence of

   Crassostrea gigas and Mytilus galloprovincialis cohabiting in the
   shallow waters of one northern Italian lagoon (Sacca di Goro, Adriatic
   Sea) and regarded as susceptible and resistant species, respectively. In
   2011, limited bivalve mortality was detected in the open-field trial
   performed with 6-12 month old spat whereas subsequent trials with 2-3
   month old spat produced almost complete (2012) and considerable (2013)
   oyster mortality. Macroscopical examination and histology excluded the
   presence of notifiable pathogens but, in the sampling preceding the
   massive oyster spat mortality of 2012, a mu deleted variant of OSHV-1
   DNA was found in wide-ranging amounts in all analyzed oysters in
   conjunction with substantial levels of Vibrio splendidus and Vibrio
   aestuarianus. The large oyster spat mortality with borderline OSHV-1
   positivity recorded in 2013 supports the multi-factorial etiology of the
   syndrome. This is the first report of a OSHV-1 (under a form interpreted
   as the variant mu Var) in the Goro lagoon. Transcriptional host
   footprints are under investigation to better understand the bivalve

   Sand fly trapping was conducted from 2001 to 2012 in 175 sites in the

   MaxEnt prediction found the more suitable habitat for P. perniciosus to
   be hilly areas (100-300 m above the mean sea level) characterised by
   temperate climate during the winter and summer seasons, high winter
   vegetation cover and moderate rainfall during the activity season of

Abstract = {{Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar 4,{[}5],12,i:- is a
   monophasic variant of Salmonella Typhimurium and its occurrence has
   markedly increased in several European countries in the last ten years.
   In June 2011, an outbreak of Salmonella 4,{[}5],12,i:- was reported
   among attendees of a wedding reception in the North-East of Italy. The
   source of this outbreak was identified as a cooked pork product served
   during the wedding reception. All Salmonella isolates from humans and
   the contaminated pork products were identified as Salmonella
   4,{[}5],12,i:- and phage typed as DT7a. Afterwards, the farm where the
   pigs were raised was identified and sampled, and Salmonella Typhimurium
   was isolated from swine fecal samples. Despite the difference in
   serovar, these Salmonella Typhimurium isolates were also phage typed as
   DT7a.
   In the present study, Salmonella isolates from animals, humans and pork
   products during the outbreak investigation were subtyped by pulsed-field
   gel electrophoresis (PFGE), Multiple-Locus Variable number tandem
   repeats Analysis (MLVA), and resistance patterns, aiming to identify the
   most suitable subtyping methods to characterize isolates associated with
   this outbreak. In addition, a collection of epidemiologically unrelated
   strains of Salmonella 4,{[}5],12,i:- and Salmonella Typhimurium sharing
   the same phage type (DT7a) was similarly characterized in order to
   investigate their genetic relationship.
   This study provides a first snapshot of a rare Salmonella phage type,
   DT7a, associated with both Salmonella 4, {[}5],12,i:- and Salmonella
   Typhimurium. Moreover, the study demonstrated that in this specific
   context MLVA could be a reliable tool to support outbreak investigations
   as well as to assess the genetic relatedness among Salmonella isolates.

Abstract = {{Donkeys, owing to the frequent outdoor activity, are exposed to a high
   risk of infection with tick-borne pathogens. This work aimed to detect
   exposure to Theileria equi, Babesia caballi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum
   and Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. of donkeys reared in Central Italy.
   For this purpose 122 adult donkeys were selected within 11 herds and
   submitted to blood collection. IgG antibodies to T. equi, B. caballi, A.
   phagocytophilum and B. burgdorferi s.l. were detected by IFAT.
   Conventional PCRs targeting the genes MSP2 and the flagellin were used
   for the detection of A. phagocytophilum and B. burgdorferi s.l.
   respectively and a Real Time PCR Sybr Green was used to detect
   Babesia/Theileria spp.... The species identity was determined by
   amplicons sequencing.
   Forty eight (39.3\%) and 58 (47.5\%) animals tested positive for T. equi
   and B. caballi antibodies, respectively; nine animals (7.4\%) were found
   positive for antibodies against A. phagocytophilum whereas negative
   results were obtained for B. burgdorferi s.l. Twenty-six (21.3\%)
   animals showed antibodies for both T. equi and B. caballi. Twenty-three
   (18.8\%) donkeys were positive to Babesia/Theileria spp. PCR assay. Out
   of 21 sequenced amplicons, 20 were identified as T. equi, belonging to
   three main groups designated A, B and D and one as B. caballi group A.
   Neither A. phagocytophilum nor B. burgdorferi PCR results were positive.
   The study showed a high exposure of donkeys to tick-borne pathogens and
   provides information on the genetic identity of the T. equi strains
   circulating in Central Italy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A nephrotropic H10N1 avian influenza virus (AIV) with an intravenous
   pathogenicity index (IVPI) of 1.9 and a haemagglutinin monobasic amino
   acid cleavage site motif, was genetically and phenotypically
   characterized.
   Specific pathogen free chickens of 3 or 6 weeks of age were challenged
   with a 10(6) EID50/0.1 mL dose by either oro-nasal or intravenous route,
   to study the distribution, tissue tropism and virulence of the virus.
   Direct transmission was tested by introducing sentinel birds on day 4
   post infection. Virus shedding and viremia were investigated by means of
   type A influenza real-time RT-PCR. Dead birds were necropsied and
   selected organs were collected for histology, immunohistochemistry, and
   to detect and re-isolate the virus. Serological analyses were carried
   out to evaluate seroconversion, three weeks from challenge.
   The oro-nasal challenge of the 6-week-old birds elicited 47\% mortality
   as a result of viremia and massive replication of the virus in the
   kidneys. Unexpectedly, among birds of 3 weeks of age the same challenge
   caused 5\% mortality and few clinical signs. Surprisingly the
   intravenous administration of the virus in the 3-week-old birds recorded
   an IVPI of 2.4.
   A full genome characterization of the virus could not identify any
   molecular determinant underlying the observed phenotype.
   Our findings describe the complex pathobiology of an AIV of the H10
   subtype that stands out for its peculiar pathogenicity and tissue
   tropism in chickens. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cryptococcosis is a life-threatening fungal disease that infects humans
   and animals worldwide. Inhalation of fungal particles from an
   environmental source can cause primary infection of the respiratory
   system. As animals can be considered a sentinel for human diseases, the
   aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and molecular identity
   of Cryptococcus spp. in the nasal cavity of feral cats.
   Cats from 162 urban and rural feral cat colonies were sampled over 3
   years. Of 766 cats from which nasal swabs were obtained, Cryptococcus
   spp. were recovered from 95 (12.6\%), including 37 C. magnus (4.8\%), 16
   C. albidus (2.0\%), 15 C. carnescens (1.9\%), 12 C. neoformans (1.6\%),
   as well as C. oeirensis (n = 3), C. victoriae (n = 3), C. albidosimilis
   (n = 2), Filobasidium globisporum (n = 2), C. adeliensis (n = 1), C.
   flavescens (n = 1), C. dimnae (n = 1), C. saitoi (n = 1), and C.
   wieringae (n = 1) with prevalence <1\%.
   Thirteen Cryptococcus species were identified by polymerase chain
   reaction and sequencing of internal transcribed spacer amplicons.
   Statistical analysis did not identify any predisposing factors that
   contributed to nasal colonization (eg, sex, age, season, or habitat).
   Results suggest that asymptomatic feral cats may carry C. neoformans and
   other Cryptococcus species in their sinonasal cavity. Genotyping of the
   specific cryptococcal isolates provides a better understanding of the
   epidemiology of these yeasts.}},

Abstract = {{Bubaline herpesvirus 1 (BuHV1) is a member of ruminant
   alphaherpesviruses antigenically related to bovine herpesvirus 1
   (BoHV1). The impact of BuHV1 infection in infectious bovine
   rhinotracheitis control program is difficult to establish, due to the
   lack of specific diagnostic test. The ectodomain of glycoprotein E of
   BuHV1 was expressed as recombinant secreted protein and used in indirect
   ELISA as well as in a discriminatory test using the BoHV1 counterpart. A
   panel of monoclonal antibodies was produced against BuHV1; 6 out of 7
   anti-gE monoclonal antibodies specifically recognized the BuHV1 gE.
   Results indicated BuHV1 gE as a sensitive marker of infection compared
   to seroneutralization (SN) test or blocking ELISA. When BoHV1 and BuHV1
   gEs were immobilized in different wells of the same ELISA microplate,
   bovine and water buffalo sera were more reactive against the respective
   infecting virus. About one third of seropositive buffaloes with no
   history of contact with cattle and having higher SN titres, reacted in
   BoHV1 gE blocking ELISA, possibly because of steric hindrance. Since in
   two occasions BuHV1 was also isolated from water buffalo scoring gB+/gE+
   BoHV1 blocking ELISA, we conclude that the combination of the two
   blocking ELISAs is not suitable to differentiate between BoHV1 and
   BuHV1. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study was conducted to evaluate the effect of vaccines
   produced in Ethiopia from vaccine strains used worldwide on the
   transmission characteristics of velogenic Newcastle disease virus field
   strain after different vaccination schemes. Chickens were vaccinated
   with Hitchner B1, La Sota or I-2 via the intraocular and intranasal
   routes. Vaccine and challenge viruses induced high antibody levels, both
   in inoculated and contact birds. Prime-boost vaccination protected birds
   against morbidity and mortality and significantly reduced the incidence
   of viral shedding from chickens compared with single vaccinated and
   unvaccinated birds. Protection from disease and mortality was correlated
   with the presence of positive antibody titres (>4 log(2)) at day of
   challenge. Most of the unvaccinated and in-contact birds excreted the
   virus and showed a high level of antibody titres, indicating the high
   infectivity of the challenge virus. The detection of the challenge virus
   in most of vaccinated birds demonstrated that the tested vaccination
   protocols cannot fully protect birds from viral infection, replication
   and shedding, and vaccinated-infected birds can act as a source of
   infection for susceptible flocks. The high mortality observed in
   unvaccinated birds and their contacts confirmed the virulence of the
   challenge virus and indicated that this field virus strain can easily
   spread in an unvaccinated poultry population and cause major outbreaks.
   Progressive vaccinations supported by biosecurity measures should
   therefore be implemented to control the disease and introduction of the
   virus to the poultry farms.}},

   M13 PCR fingerprinting types were identified. The wide variety of MLST
   types of C.neoformans and the occurrence of ADa and aAD hybrids in our
   study supports the notion of genetic recombination in the area studied.
   The heterogeneity of the non-C.neoformans isolates remains open to

   different concentrations of B(a)P in the Manila clam Venerupis
   philippinarum. The general morphology of the different clam tissues,
   which was investigated histologically, evidenced a significant increase
   in the number of intestinal brown cells after B(a)P exposure. An
   increasing trend response to B(a)P was detected. The histochemical
   analysis for lipofuscin revealed the presence of lipofuscin-like
   substances inside the cytoplasm of intestinal brown cells. The same
   cells exhibited a PAS positivity and a reactivity to Schmorl's solution
   for melanin pigment. Moreover, intestinal brown cells exhibited an
   immunopositivity to HSP70 antibody confirming the increasing trend
   response to B(a)P detected by the histochemical analysis. Our results

Abstract = {{Human cases of infection due to a novel swine-origin variant of
   influenza A virus subtype H3N2 (H3N2v) have recently been identified in
   the United States. Pre-existing humoral and cellular immunity has been
   recognized as one of the key factors in limiting the infection burden of
   an emerging influenza virus strain, contributing to restrict its
   circulation and to mitigate clinical presentation. Aim of this study was
   to assess humoral and cell-mediated cross immune responses to H3N2v in
   immuno-competent (healthy donors, n = 45) and immuno-compromised hosts
   (HIV-infected subjects, n = 46) never exposed to H3N2v influenza strain.
   Humoral response against i) H3N2v (A/H3N2/Ind/08/11), ii) animal vaccine
   H3N2 strain (A/H3N2/ Min/11/10), and iii) pandemic H1N1 virus
   (A/H1N1/Cal/07/09) was analysed by hemagglutination inhibition assay;
   cell-mediated response against the same influenza strains was analysed
   by ELISpot assay. A large proportion of healthy and HIV subjects
   displayed cross-reacting humoral and cellular immune responses against
   two H3N2v strains, suggesting the presence of B-and T-cell clones able
   to recognize epitopes from emerging viral strains in both groups.
   Specifically, humoral response was lower in HIV subjects than in HD, and
   a specific age-related pattern of antibody response against different
   influenza strains was observed both in HD and in HIV. Cellular immune
   response was similar between HD and HIV groups and no relationship with
   age was reported. Finally, no correlation between humoral and cellular
   immune response was observed. Overall, a high prevalence of HD and HIV
   patients showing cross reactive immunity against two H3N2v strains was
   observed, with a slightly lower proportion in HIV persons. Other studies
   focused on HIV subjects at different stages of diseases are needed in
   order to define how cross immunity can be affected by advanced
   immunosuppression.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction - Bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8) caused a massive

   large-scale vaccination campaigns of susceptible species were
   implemented in most European countries starting from the spring of 2008,
   when inactivated BTV-8 vaccines became available on the market. In
   Italy, the first evidence of BTV-8 circulation was reported in March
   2008 from five dairy cattle herds in the province of Verona. Compulsory
   vaccination was then implemented in the two adjoining provinces of
   Verona and Mantua.
   Aim - This study aims at determining the prevalence of vaccine-elicited
   BTV-8 neutralizing antibodies in dairy cattle 29-47 months after
   vaccination. As infected and vaccinated animals cannot be differentiated
   serologically, information on the post-vaccination antibody dynamic
   under field conditions is crucial to implement surveillance activities.
   Materials and methods - A cross-sectional serosurvey of vaccine-elicited
   BTV-8 neutralizing antibodies in dairy cattle was performed in the
   province of Verona; 110 cows housed in 12 farms vaccinated during the
   2008 campaign, and 270 cows housed in 28 farms vaccinated during both
   2008 and 2009 campaigns, were sampled in 2012. Eighty-four
   non-vaccinated heifers born from 2010 onwards were also sampled to
   confirm absence of virus circulation in the sampled herds after
   vaccination. All samples were tested for BTV-8 neutralizing antibodies
   using virus neutralization assay. Differences in seroprevalence between
   cows receiving one or two vaccinations (2008 vs. 2008 and 2009) were
   tested with chi(2) test. The analysis considered stratification of
   samples according to herd size and vaccination schedule, clustering of
   animals at the herd level, and sampling weights as to weight the sample
   back to the population from which it was drawn.
   Results and discussion - Overall seroprevalence was 43.1\% (95\%
   confidence interval: 41.8-44.5\%), relatively low compared to that of
   similar surveys performed in other countries. Seroprevalence in cows
   vaccinated once was 30.4\% (29.3-31.5\%), significantly lower than that
   in cows vaccinated twice (48.3\%, 46.5-50.2\%). Antibody titres ranged
   from log(10) 1.00 to 2.51 (mean 1.36). None of the 84 non-vaccinated
   heifers had detectable BTV-8 neutralizing antibodies, confirming absence
   of virus circulation in the sampled herds after vaccination.
   Conclusions - A seroprevalence of 43.1\% was evidenced in Italian dairy
   cattle 29-47 months post-vaccination. Although neutralizing antibodies
   are being waned sooner in formerly, non-repeatedly vaccinated animals,
   for at least 47 months vaccinated animals cannot be included in (sero)
   surveillance programmes. The fact that many vaccinated animals are
   likely to still be protected by vaccination during that period provides
   an explanation of why the devastating 2006-2007 European BTV-8 epidemic
   was so efficiently controlled despite most vaccination campaigns were
   stopped after two years.}},

Abstract = {{Urine is an ideal biofluid for metabolomics studies since it is obtained
   noninvasively, and its composition is affected by genetic and
   environmental factors reflecting the physiology of multiple organs.
   However, urine dilution effects and instrumental variation from the
   analytical method play a significant confounding role when one attempts
   to characterize biological and physiological factors through NMR and MS
   measurements of small molecule concentrations. Several normalization
   approaches have been used for urinary metabolomics studies and
   normalization to osmolality or to total useful MS signal have been
   proposed. When dealing with urinary metabolome analysis in cattle,
   freeze-drying (FD) is the method commonly used for normalization
   purposes. Herein, normalization to specific gravity, which provides a
   fair estimation of urine osmolality, was compared to the time consuming
   FD step and to the normalization to total useful MS signal in order to
   assess if this approach could be used as normalization strategy to
   differentiate control from anabolic treated animals. The results
   revealed that similar to 80 \% of the metabolites detected as
   constituting the acquired MS fingerprints for the freeze-dried samples
   and for the samples normalized to both specific gravity (SG) and total
   useful MS signal were in common. In addition, similar information from
   the multivariate statistical analysis was obtained by both normalization
   approaches. We demonstrate, therefore, that SG can be used as
   normalization approach for urinary metabolome analysis in cattle
   resulting in a high sample throughput procedure when compared with the
   FD step.}},

Abstract = {{Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is the most lethal form of human
   cancer, with dismal survival rates due to late-stage diagnoses and a
   lack of efficacious therapies. Building on the observation that avian
   influenza A viruses (IAVs) have a tropism for the pancreas in vivo, the
   present study was aimed at testing the efficacy of IAVs as oncolytic
   agents for killing human PDA cell lines. Receptor characterization
   confirmed that human PDA cell lines express the alpha-2,3- and the
   alpha-2,6-linked glycan receptor for avian and human IAVs, respectively.
   PDA cell lines were sensitive to infection by human and avian IAV
   isolates, which is consistent with this finding. Growth kinetic
   experiments showed preferential virus replication in PDA cells over that
   in a nontransformed pancreatic ductal cell line. Finally, at early time
   points posttreatment, infection with IAVs caused higher levels of
   apoptosis in PDA cells than gemcitabine and cisplatin, which are the
   cornerstone of current therapies for PDA. In the BxPC-3 PDA cell line,
   apoptosis resulted from the engagement of the intrinsic mitochondrial
   pathway. Importantly, IAVs did not induce apoptosis in nontransformed
   pancreatic ductal HPDE6 cells. Using a model based on the growth of a
   PDA cell line as a xenograft in SCID mice, we also show that a slightly
   pathogenic avian IAV significantly inhibited tumor growth following
   intratumoral injection. Taken together, these results are the first to
   suggest that IAVs may hold promise as future agents of oncolytic
   virotherapy against pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a model to calculate a quantitative risk score for

   herpes virus), and is intended to be used for risk ranking sites to
   support surveillance for demonstration of zone or member state freedom

   quantitative and qualitative estimates of risk factors organised into
   five risk themes (1) Live fish and egg movements; (2) Exposure via
   water; (3) On-site processing; (4) Short-distance mechanical
   transmission; (5) Distance-independent mechanical transmission. The
   calculated risk score for an individual aquaculture site is a value
   between zero and one and is intended to indicate the risk of a site

Abstract = {{Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a marine microorganism, recognized as an
   important cause of foodborne illness particularly in Asia, South America
   and United States. Outbreaks are rarely reported in Europe, but they can
   occur unexpectedly in relation, among other reasons, to the spread of
   highly virulent strains. It is known that the risk is proportional to
   exposure levels to pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus (i.e. carrying the tdh
   and/or the trh genes) but currently there is a lack of occurrence data
   for pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus in shellfish production areas of the
   Member States. In this study a total of 147 samples of bivalve molluscs,
   from harvesting areas of two Italian regions (Sardinia and Veneto) were
   analyzed for Escherichia coli and salmonella, according to Reg
   2073/2005, and for detection and enumeration of total and toxigenic V.
   parahaemolyticus strains using a new DNA colony hybridization method.
   Environmental parameters (water temperature and salinity) were also
   recorded. Results of E. coli were consistently in agreement with the
   legislation limits for the harvesting class of origin and Salmonella was
   detected only in one sample. The average contamination levels for total
   V. parahaemolyticus were 84 and 73 CFU/g respectively for Sardinia and
   Veneto, with the highest value reaching 8.7 x 10(3) CFU/g. Nineteen
   samples (12.9\%) resulted positive for the presence of potentially
   pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus strains, with levels ranging between 10
   and 120 CFU/g and most of the positive samples (n = 17) showing values
   equal or below 20 CFU/g. A significant correlation (r = 0.41) was found
   between water temperature and V. parahaemolyticus levels, as well as
   with isolation frequency.
   The data provided in this study on contamination levels of total and
   potentially pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus, seasonal distribution and
   correlation with water temperature, will help in defining appropriate
   monitoring programs and post-harvest policies for this hazard, improving
   the management of the harvesting areas and the safety of bivalve
   molluscs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   with contamination levels that varied from 5 to 7 x 10(2) copies/g. On
   the contrary, NoV showed a high prevalence (51.5\%), with a large
   variability according to the group considered (e.g. 47.8\% for
   Crassostrea in Veneto, 79.7\% for Mytilus in Campania, 84.6\% for Tapes
   in Sardinia). NoV contamination affected class A and class B production
   areas to a different extent, with a statistically significant difference
   in both contamination prevalence (22.1\% vs. 66.3\%; p < 0.0001) and
   quantity (average contamination level of 3.1 x 10(2) vs. 1.9 x 10(3)
   copies/g; p < 0.05). The different species analyzed from class B
   harvesting areas (Mytilus, Tapes/Ruditapes and Crassostrea) showed a NoV
   prevalence respectively of 70.3\%, 66.0\% and 47.8\% but comparable NoV
   contamination levels (between 8.4 x 10(2) and 4.9 x 10(3) copies/g).
   Other two bivalve species considered in the study (Donax spp. and Solen
   spp.) showed a relevant NoV presence (40.0\% and 34.4\% of samples).
   Finally, samples analyzed before and after commercial purification
   treatment showed a decrease of contamination prevalence after the
   treatment, but inconsistent results were recorded on NoV levels.
   The data obtained, together with other quantitative information to
   estimate consumer exposure, in association with studies on dose-response
   and on the effectiveness of post-harvest treatments, will provide a
   useful tool for the definition of microbiological criteria related to
   the different shellfish species. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper was to provide suitable microbiological criteria
   (MC) for Campylobacter in broiler carcasses and a sampling plan to
   verify compliance with such criteria. Data were gathered in the presence
   and concentration of Campylobacter in broiler carcasses collected in
   three different Italian slaughterhouses, labelled as A, B and C. The
   sampling plan to be validated in each slaughterhouse included the
   analysis of three different carcasses collected immediately after
   chilling from 30 different lots, fora total of 90 samples per
   slaughterhouse. The number of positive samples containing above 100
   CFU/g and above 1000 CFU/g throughout the 30 tested lots was determined
   to estimate between-lot variability. Based on this information, the
   performance of four MC was evaluated for lot compliance: i) n = 3; c =
   0; m = 100 CFU/g; ii) n = 3; c = 0; m = 1000 CFU/g; iii) n = 3; c = 1; m
   = 1000 CFU/g and iv) n = 3; c = 2; m = 1000 CFU/g. Positive
   Campylobacter samples were found in 60\% of the lots tested in
   slaughterhouses A and C and in 733\% of lots from slaughterhouse B. The
   differences among the three slaughterhouses in the mean Campylobacter
   levels found in positive samples were not significant and were used to
   evaluate the performance of the MC. The level of lot compliance to
   different MC was calculated and for the most stringent one (n = 3; c =
   0; m = 100 CFU/g) was 40\% at slaughterhouses A and C but only 26.7\% at
   slaughterhouse B. The results of this study show an alternative approach
   to establish MC for Campylobacter in broilers. According to (1)
   Campylobacter prevalence and concentration in Italy, (2) applied
   experimental plan and (3) selected slaughterhouses, the number of
   compliant lots to the suggested MC ranged between 26.7 and 100\%. The
   selection of the fit for purpose MC is a risk manager decision, based on
   a reasonable balance between public health and cost for poultry
   industries. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The efficacy of a slow-release insecticidal and repellent
   collar containing 10\% imidacloprid and 4.5\% flumethrin (Seresto, Bayer
   Animal Health) in preventing Leishmania infantum infection was evaluated
   in a large population of dogs living in a hyper-endemic area of Sicily
   (Italy).
   Methods: A total of 219 dogs, negative for L. infantum were enrolled in
   a multicentre, controlled study. Dogs were divided into two homogeneous
   groups, defined as G1 (n = 102) and G2 (n = 117). Before the start of
   the sand fly season, dogs in G1 were treated with the collar while
   animals in G2 were left untreated, serving as negative controls. Dogs
   were serially sampled on day D90, D180, D210 and D300 in order to assess
   Leishmania infection by IFAT, PCR on skin (D210-D300) and bone marrow
   (D300) and cytology on bone marrow aspirate (D300).
   Results: Three dogs (2.9\%) in G1 and 41 (40.2\%) in G2 became positive
   for L. infantum in at least one of the diagnostic tests employed in the
   study. The number of seropositive dogs in G2 increased in the course of
   the study from 15 (D90) to 41 (D300), with some of them also positive in
   other diagnostic tests. Eight (19.6\%) of the seropositive dogs in G2
   showed an increase in antibody titers ranging from 1:160 to 1:1,280. At
   the last follow-up, some of dogs in G2 displayed overt clinical signs
   suggestive of leishmaniosis. The mean incidence density rate at the
   final follow-up was 4.0\% for G1 and 60.7\% for G2, leading to a mean
   efficacy of the collar in protecting dogs at both sites of 93.4\%.
   Conclusions: The slow-release collar tested in this study was shown to
   be safe and highly effective in preventing L. infantum infection in a
   large population of dogs. Protection conferred by a single collar (up to
   eight months) spanned an entire sand fly season in a hyper-endemic area
   of southern Italy. The regular use of collars, at least during the sand
   fly season, may represent a reliable and sustainable strategy for the
   prevention of leishmaniosis in dogs living in or travelling to an
   endemic area.}},

Title = {{Ticks infesting humans in Italy and associated pathogens}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Ticks may transmit a large variety of pathogens, which cause
   illnesses in animals and humans, commonly referred to as to tick-borne
   diseases (TBDs). The incidence of human TBDs in Italy is underestimated
   because of poor surveillance and the scant amount of studies available.
   Methods: Samples (n = 561) were collected from humans in four main
   geographical areas of Italy (i.e., northwestern, northeastern, southern
   Italy, and Sicily), which represent a variety of environments. After
   being morphologically identified, ticks were molecularly tested with
   selected protocols for the presence of pathogens of the genera
   Rickettsia, Babesia, Theileria, Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis,
   Borrelia and Anaplasma.
   Results: Ticks belonged to 16 species of the genera Argas, Dermacentor,
   Haemaphysalis, Hyalomma, Ixodes and Rhipicephalus, with Ixodes ricinus
   (59.5\%) being the species most frequently retrieved, followed by
   Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (21.4\%). Nymphs were the life stage
   most frequently retrieved (41\%), followed by adult females (34.6\%).
   The overall positivity to any pathogen detected was 18\%. Detected
   microorganisms were Rickettsia spp. (17.0\%), Anaplasma phagocytophilum
   (0.8\%), Borrelia afzelii (0.5\%), Borrelia valaisiana (0.3\%), C. N.
   mikurensis (0.5\%) and Babesia venatorum (0.6\%).
   Conclusions: Results indicate that people living in the Italian
   peninsula are at risk of being bitten by different tick species, which
   may transmit a plethora of TBD causing pathogens and that co-infections
   may also occur.}},

Abstract = {{The study compared the effects of enriching a basic solid feed mixture
   made of corn grain and straw with a protein source (extruded pea) or
   with urea on growth, health, behavior, and carcass quality of veal
   calves. Seventy-nine calves, divided according to their initial body
   weight (59.8 +/- 6.9 kg) into 3 groups (5 pens of 5 or 6 animals per
   group), were allotted to 1 of 3 experimental feeding treatments: milk
   replacer plus an 85:15 (as-fed basis) mixture of corn grain and wheat
   straw (CGS); milk replacer plus a 72:15:13 mixture of corn grain, wheat
   straw, and extruded pea (CGS-EP); or milk replacer plus an 83.3:16:0.7
   mixture of corn grain, wheat straw, and urea (CGS-U). All feeding
   treatments were targeted to provide 140 kg of dry matter (DM)/calf of
   solid feed during the 201-d fattening cycle, and the greater crude
   protein content of the mixtures supplemented with protein or urea was
   balanced by restricting to 96\% the daily amount of milk replacer
   delivered to CGS. Results did not differ among feeding treatments for
   average daily gain or solid feed intake but, net of meal refusal events,
   the average daily intake of milk replacer was 1.73, 1.66, and 1.60 kg of
   DM/calf for CGS, CGS-EP, and CGS-U, respectively. The overall mean
   hemoglobin values from samples taken at d 11, 40, 83, 126, and 196 were
   lower for CGS-U calves (9.1 +/- 0.2 g/dL) compared with CGS (9.8 +/- 0.2
   g/dL), whereas those of CGS-EP were intermediate (9.4 +/- 0.2 g/dL).
   Behavioral observations showed a frequency of oral stereotypes <1.2\%
   for all feeding treatments. Longer eating and chewing or ruminating time
   was recorded for CGS-U calves compared with CGS and CGS-EP calves. All
   carcasses had satisfactory color for the veal market and none of the
   carcass traits were affected by the feeding treatments. The proportions
   of tongues and lungs with signs of lesions, forestomach development,
   abomasal lesions, and rumen plaques did not differ among feeding
   treatments. Hyperkeratinization of rumen papillae was observed only in
   CGS-U calves with a prevalence of 11.3\%. Based on these findings,
   providing a corn grain and straw solid feed mixture enriched with
   extruded pea or urea was an effective strategy to reduce milk replacer
   consumption, lowering total feeding cost per calf by 3.0 to 3.4\% and
   6.9 to 7.2\%, respectively. This economic advantage was supported by the
   lack of detrimental effects on calf growth performance, behavior, and
   carcass quality. However, the occurrence of rumen papillae
   hyperkeratosis may raise some concerns about the use of urea.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Clostridium difficile is an important cause of intestinal
   infections in some animal species and animals might be a reservoir for
   community associated human infections. Here we describe a collection of
   animal associated C. difficile strains from 12 countries based on
   inclusion criteria of one strain (PCR ribotype) per animal species per
   laboratory.
   Results: Altogether 112 isolates were collected and distributed into 38
   PCR ribotypes with agarose based approach and 50 PCR ribotypes with
   sequencer based approach. Four PCR ribotypes were most prevalent in
   terms of number of isolates as well as in terms of number of different
   host species: 078 (14.3\% of isolates; 4 hosts), 014/020 (11.6\%; 8
   hosts); 002 (5.4\%; 4 hosts) and 012 (5.4\%; 5 hosts). Two animal hosts
   were best represented; cattle with 31 isolates (20 PCR ribotypes; 7
   countries) and pigs with 31 isolates (16 PCR ribotypes; 10 countries).
   Conclusions: This results show that although PCR ribotype 078 is often
   reported as the major animal C. difficile type, especially in pigs, the
   variability of strains in pigs and other animal hosts is substantial.
   Most common human PCR ribotypes (014/020 and 002) are also among most
   prevalent animal associated C. difficile strains worldwide. The
   widespread dissemination of toxigenic C. difficile and the considerable
   overlap in strain distribution between species furthers concerns about
   interspecies, including zoonotic, transmission of this critically
   important pathogen.}},

Abstract = {{The remarkable economic losses due to porcine reproductive and
   respiratory syndrome (PRRS) have stated the control and eradication of
   this disease is one of the main issues of swine modern farming. The
   limited cross-protection of vaccine-induced immunity compelled the
   adoption of strict biosecurity measures that must be associated with the
   prompt diagnosis of infection. In our study four RT-PCR methods, a
   RT-PCR, a SYBR Greenland two hydrolysis probes, were compared to
   evaluate their respective benefits and disadvantages. One hundred and
   seventy samples originating from 50 farms located in northern Italy were
   tested with all assays and performances were evaluated using a Bayesian
   approach to deal with the absence of a Gold Standard. Sequencing the
   complete of ORF7, the segment targeted by all methods, allowed a gain of
   insight into the genetic variability of Italian strains and to
   investigate the role of mismatches on assay sensitivity. Our study
   evidenced that methods based only on primers-genome interaction better
   tolerate PRRSV genetic variability, demonstrating a greater sensitivity
   (Se): SYBR Green I (Se = 98.4\%) and RT-PCR (Se = 99\%) outperform both
   in-house (Se = 71.4\%) and commercial (Se = 91.7\%) probe-based methods.
   On the other hand, probe-based assays allowed an easier genotyping of
   PRRSV strains and implementation of the internal control system (IC).
   Phylogenetic analysis allowed demonstration of a presence of two clades

Abstract = {{Mycoplasma iowae, an occasional pathogen of turkeys, was isolated for
   the first time from captive grey partridges (Perdix perdix). Clinical
   signs including respiratory and intestinal disorder were seen in birds
   of all ages but mainly in those kept housed during rearing. Mortality
   rates averaged over 20\% during the year. Treatment with antibiotics and
   antiparasitic drugs produced only a transient improvement in condition.
   The gross pathology findings included poor body growth, lack of
   development of the breast muscles, abnormalities in the keel
   development, and bone fragility. Some birds showed infraorbital
   sinusitis with serous or fibrinous exudates and catarrhal tracheitis,
   while others presented serofibrinous airsacculitis and splenomegaly.
   Laboratory investigations revealed pure cultures of M. iowae in the gut
   as well as sinus and air sacs. While other organisms such as coccidia,
   Trichomonas, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, and Aspergillus
   spp. were detected, the similarity of the disease with that seen in
   turkeys infected with M. iowae strongly suggests that this mycoplasma
   may be the primary pathogen here. The presence of M. iowae in game birds
   commonly released into the wild could have serious implications
   particularly in areas where industrial poultry farms are concentrated.}},

Abstract = {{Salmonella 4,{[}5], 12: i:-is a variant of Salmonella Typhimurium, which
   lacks the expression of phase-2 flagellar antigen, generally associated
   with the deletion of the fljB gene. Additional mechanisms involving the
   fljAB operon (fljA, fljB, and hin genes) lead to the lack of expression
   of phase-2 flagellar antigens also in Salmonella strains harboring the
   fljB gene. For 20 S. 4,{[}5], 12: i:-strains, defined as
   ``inconsistent'' Salmonella Typhimurium variants since they had
   phenotypically behaved as monophasic, even though the fljB gene was
   conserved, the fljAB operon was characterized in order to explain the
   ineffective expression of the phase-2 flagellar antigen. The monophasic
   phenotype for a first group of strains (9) was likely due to the absence
   of the hin gene, leading to the inhibited switch between the expression
   of phase-1 and phase-2 flagellar genes. For a second group of strains
   (5), the monophasic phenotype could be attributed to nonconservative
   point mutations identified in fljA and hin genes, which could hamper the
   proper expression of invertase gene and the fljA, acting as repressor of
   the phase-1 flagellar gene. Finally, for a last group of inconsistent
   strains (6), a plausible reason for their monophasic phenotype was not
   found, since the genes involved in the expression of phase-2 flagellar
   antigen were fully conserved. Moreover, the collection of inconsistent
   Salmonella Typhimurium isolates investigated were characterized by
   distinct molecular profiles, as demonstrated by multiple-locus
   variable-number tandem repeat analysis, and phenotype variability, as
   demonstrated by phage-typing. This study highlights the usefulness of
   investigating the entire fljAB operon when a definitive identification
   of the monophasic or biphasic status of Salmonella Typhimurium strains
   is needed (for instance, in the context of epidemiological
   investigations aimed to identify the relatedness among strains).}},

Abstract = {{Avian H7 influenza viruses are recognized as potential pandemic viruses,
   as personnel often become infected during poultry outbreaks. H7
   infections in humans typically cause mild conjunctivitis; however, the
   H7N9 outbreak in the spring of 2013 has resulted in severe respiratory
   disease. To date, no H7 viruses have acquired the ability for sustained
   transmission among humans. Airborne transmission is considered a
   requirement for the emergence of pandemic influenza, and advanced
   knowledge of the molecular changes or signature required for
   transmission would allow early identification of pandemic vaccine seed
   stocks, screening and stockpiling of antiviral compounds, and
   eradication efforts focused on flocks harboring threatening viruses.
   Thus, we sought to determine if a highly pathogenic influenza A H7N1
   (A/H7N1) virus with no history of human infection could become capable
   of airborne transmission among ferrets. We show that after 10 serial
   passages, A/H7N1 developed the ability to be transmitted to cohoused and
   airborne contact ferrets. Four amino acid mutations (PB2 T81I, NP V284M,
   and M1 R95K and Q211K) in the internal genes and a minimal amino acid
   mutation (K/R313R) in the stalk region of the hemagglutinin protein were
   associated with airborne transmission. Furthermore, transmission was not
   associated with loss of virulence. These findings highlight the
   importance of the internal genes in host adaptation and suggest that
   natural isolates carrying these mutations be further evaluated. Our
   results demonstrate that a highly pathogenic avian H7 virus can become
   capable of airborne transmission in a mammalian host, and they support
   ongoing surveillance and pandemic H7 vaccine development.}},

Abstract = {{The particle size of cereal grains has been found to modulate the rate
   of passage from the rumen and the digestibility of starch and neutral
   detergent fibre (NDF), but few studies have examined its impact on
   reticular pH. The study aimed to evaluate the effect of feeding finely
   ground maize on the risk of ruminal acidosis, milk yield and
   composition. Twelve Holstein-Friesian cows were assigned to one of two
   experimental groups and fed according to a cross-over design. Diets were
   isoenergetic and isonitrogenous and were characterised by the same NDF
   and ADF, differing only in maize particle size. In the control diet
   (Ct), the maize meal was ground to 1.0mm, whereas in the experimental
   diet, it was finely ground (Fg) to 0.5mm. The pH and temperature of the
   reticulum were continuously measured in eight cows throughout the trial
   using indwelling sensors. Dry matter intake was higher in cows offered
   Fg diet than in Ct (19.0 vs. 20.3kg/day; p=0.067). However, milk yield
   (p=0.855) and the 3.5\% fat-corrected milk (FCM) (p=0.724) did not show
   any differences between the diets. Casein (2.48 vs. 2.57\%; p=0.035) and
   crude protein (CP) (3.18 vs. 3.31\%; p=0.021) resulted higher in Fg.
   Similarly, starch digestibility increased in animals offered Fg diet
   versus Ct (0.94 vs. 0.98; p=0.078). Among the reticular parameters, the
   Fg-fed cows spent a significantly higher time below the 5.5 pH threshold
   (15 vs. 61min/day; p=0.047) and had an average daily variation in
   reticular pH characterised by a lower nadir pH (5.95 vs. 5.72; p<0.001)
   and a higher pH range (0.79 vs. 0.94; p=0.003). In this study, grain
   particle size affected the risk of the onset of ruminal acidosis.
   Therefore, it should be carefully considered when formulating rations.}},

   comparison to an end point two-step RT-PCR validated previously. All
   assays were aimed at discrimination between PRRSV genotypes.
   Furthermore, an exogenous internal control (IC) system had also been
   implemented in qRT-PCR. A rigorous analytical validation, executed on
   infected cell cultures and serum, demonstrated good sensitivity,
   specificity and repeatability. In particular RT-PCR was exceptionally
   sensitive and could detect a viral titre in the order of a magnitude of
   1 copies/mu L, 10-fold lower than other qRT-PCR described in this study.
   Optimal diagnostic performances have been demonstrated analyzing samples
   retrieved from an experimental infection, with RT-PCR again
   outperforming real time RT-PCR assays. All tests, showing substantial
   agreement between them, were able to detect early stages of viraemia (1

Abstract = {{Salmonella spp. is one of the main causes of foodborne illnesses in
   humans worldwide. Consequently, great interest exists in reducing its
   impact on human health by lowering its prevalence in the food chain.
   Antimicrobial formulations in the form of nanoparticles exert
   bactericidal action due to their enhanced reactivity resultant from
   their high surface/volume ratio. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are known
   to be highly toxic to Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms,
   including multidrug resistant bacteria. However, few data concerning
   their success against different Salmonella serovars are available. Aims
   of the present study were to test the antimicrobial effectiveness of
   AgNPs, against Salmonella Enteritidis, Hadar, and Senftenberg, and to
   investigate the causes of their different survival abilities from a
   molecular point of view. Results showed an immediate, time-limited and
   serovar-dependent reduction of bacterial viability. In the case of S.
   Senftenberg, the reduction in numbers was observed for up to 4 h of
   incubation in the presence of 200 mg/I of AgNPs; on the contrary, S.
   Enteritidis and S. Hadar resulted to be inhibited for up to 48 h.
   Reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction experiments

Abstract = {{Betanodaviruses are the causative agents of viral nervous necrosis and
   affect a broad range of fish species worldwide. Their bi-segmented
   genome is composed of the RNA1 and the RNA2 molecules encoding the viral
   polymerase and the coat protein, respectively. In southern Europe the
   presence of the RGNNV and the SJNNV genotypes, and the RGNNV/SJNNV and
   RGNNV/SJNNV reassortants has been documented. Several studies have
   reported a correlation between water temperature and disease onset. To
   explore the replication efficiency of betanodaviruses with different
   genomes in relation to temperature and to understand the role of genetic
   reassortment on viral phenotype, RGNNV, SJNNV, RGNNV/SJNNV and
   RGNNV/SJNNV field isolates were fully sequenced, and growth curves
   generated in vitro at four different temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30
   degrees C) were developed for each isolate. The data obtained,
   corroborated by statistical analysis, demonstrated that viral titres of
   diverse betanodavirus genotypes varied significantly in relation to the
   incubation temperature of the culture. In particular, at 30 degrees C
   betanodaviruses under investigation presented different phenotypes, and
   viruses containing the RNA1 of the RGNNV genotype showed the best
   replication efficiency. Laboratory results demonstrated that viruses
   clustering within the same genotype based on the polymerase gene,
   possess similar growth kinetics in response to temperature, thus
   highlighting the key role of RNA1 in controlling viral replication at
   different environmental conditions. The results generated might have
   practical implications for the inference of viral phenotype according to
   genetic features and may contribute to a better understanding of
   betanodavirus ecology.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
   (LA-MRSA) has been described in food-producing animals and farm or
   slaughterhouse workers involved in the primary industrial production of
   swine, bovine and poultry. This communication describes the first case
   of LA-MRSA (ST398, spa types t034 and t5210) occurring in rabbits raised
   intensively for meat production and involving farm workers or their
   family members. In 2012-2013, in a study involving 40 rabbit industrial
   holdings in Italy, one farm was found to have rabbits colonized or
   infected with MRSA. Four farm workers and one of their relatives were
   found to be carrying MRSA. In this case holding, rabbits, people and the
   holding environment were further investigated and followed up by a
   second sampling five months later. MRSA was found in 48\% (11/23) and
   25\% (15/59) of the rabbits carrying S. aureus at first and second
   samplings, respectively. Five months after first detection, some farm
   workers or family members were still MRSA carriers. Surface samples
   (2/10) and air samples (2/3) were contaminated with MRSA. Air samples
   yielded MRSA counts of 5 and 15 CFU/m3. MRSA from rabbits and people
   collected at first sampling were spa types t034 and t5210 belonging to
   ST398. The MRSA isolates from rabbits and persons tested at second
   sampling were t034 and t5210, but spa types t1190 and t2970 were also
   detected in MRSA isolates from rabbits. Tracing the epidemiological
   pattern earlier may prevent further spread of LA-MRSA in these food
   producing animals. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cystic echinococcosis (CE) and bovine cysticercosis (BC) are two
   important parasitic zoonoses, whose prevalence varies among European

   Italy, where they are generally perceived as minor public health
   problems. Available data from regional farms on cattle positive to CE

   scan statistic using a Bernoulli probability model. Out of 576 bovines
   testing positive to CE, 467 were found to be autochthonous cases. Three
   significant CE clusters were identified, the most likely one (P <0.001)
   located in the eastern part of the Veneto region. As for BC, two
   clusters were identified from 148 animals testing positive, 91 of which
   were autochthonous. An epidemiological survey was conducted and the most
   likely CE cluster was centred, collecting faecal samples from 28 dogs
   living in the farms of the area. Out of five animals (all shepherd dogs)
   found positive for taenid eggs by copromicroscopy, one was confirmed
   positive for Echinococcus granulosus by means of polymerase chain
   reaction. The study demonstrates the usefulness of integration of
   slaughterhouse data and geographical coordinates of farms involved for
   effective surveillance of CE and BC. The reliability of the spatial
   analysis in the identification of clusters of EC cases was confirmed by
   the finding of one dog positive for E. granulosus.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial references are required when geographical information systems
   (GIS) are used for the collection, storage and management of data. In
   the veterinary domain, the spatial component of a holding (of animals)
   is usually defined by coordinates, and no other relevant information
   needs to be interpreted or used for manipulation of the data in the GIS
   environment provided. Users trying to integrate or reuse spatial data
   organised in such a way, frequently face the problem of data
   incompatibility and inconsistency. The root of the problem lies in
   differences with respect to syntax as well as variations in the
   semantic, spatial and temporal representations of the geographic
   features. To overcome these problems and to facilitate the
   inter-operability of different GIS, spatial data must be defined
   according to a `` schema{''} that includes the definition, acquisition,
   analysis, access, presentation and transfer of such data between
   different users and systems. We propose an application `` schema{''} of
   holdings for GIS applications in the veterinary domain according to the
   European directive framework (directive 2007/ 2/ EC -INSPIRE). The
   conceptual model put forward has been developed at two specific levels
   to produce the essential and the abstract model, respectively. The
   former establishes the conceptual linkage of the system design to the
   real world, while the latter describes how the system or software works.
   The result is an application `` schema{''} that formalises and unifies
   the information-theoretic foundations of how to spatially represent a
   holding in order to ensure straightforward information-sharing within
   the veterinary community.}},

Abstract = {{Outbreaks of low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses of the
   H7N3 subtype were first detected in Italy in October 2002, and the virus
   continued to circulate between 2002 and 2004 in a densely populated
   poultry area in the northeast portion of that country. This virus
   circulated in unvaccinated and vaccinated poultry farms, and the
   infection was controlled in August 2003 by culling, control of
   movements, improved biosecurity, and heterologous vaccination. In 2004,
   H7N3 reoccurred in vaccinated poultry farms in which infection had been
   successfully controlled by the vaccination program. To shed light on
   this occurrence and the temporal pattern and genetic basis of antigenic
   drift for avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in the absence and presence of
   heterologous vaccination, a collection of H7N3 viruses isolated in 2002
   and 2004 were characterized genetically and antigenically. Molecular
   analysis showed that viruses isolated in the 2004 outbreaks after the
   implementation of vaccination had acquired specific amino acid
   signatures, most of which were located at reported antibody binding
   sites of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein. Antigenic characterization of
   these 2004 isolates showed that they were antigenically different from
   those isolated prior to the implementation of vaccination. This is the
   first report on antigenic and genetic evolution of H7 LPAI viruses
   following the application of heterologous vaccination in poultry. These
   findings may have an impact on control strategies to combat AI
   infections in poultry based on vaccination.}},

Abstract = {{The Pseudomonas fluorescens group comprises several closely related
   species that are involved in food contamination and spoilage.
   Specifically, the interest in P. fluorescens as a spoiler of dairy
   products increased after the cases of ``blue mozzarella{''} that
   occurred in Italy in 2010. A Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) scheme
   was developed and applied to characterise 136 isolates (reference
   strains and food borne isolates) at strain level, to reveal the genetic
   relationships among them and to disclose any possible genetic clustering
   of phenotypic markers involved in food spoilage (protease, lipase,
   lecithinase activities and pigmented or fluorescent molecule
   production). The production of dark blue diffusible pigment was
   evaluated on several bacterial culture media and directly on mozzarella
   cheese. The MLST scheme provided precise genotyping at the strain level,
   and the population analyses of the concatenated sequences allowed major
   taxa to be defined. This approach was revealed to be suitable for
   tracking the strains according to their origin, such as dairy plants or
   food matrices. The genetic analysis revealed the presence of a
   connection between the blue pigment production and a specific
   phylogenetic cluster. The development of the online database specific to
   the P. fluorescens group (http://pubmlstorg/ pfluorescens) will
   facilitate the application of the scheme and the sharing of the data.

Abstract = {{Prognosis and therapeutic management of dogs with cutaneous mast cell
   tumors (MCTs) depend on clinical stage and histological grade. However,
   the prognostic value of this latter is still questionable. In the
   present study, MCT transcriptome was analyzed to identify a set of
   candidate genes potentially useful for predicting the biological
   behavior of MCTs. Fifty-one canine MCT biopsies were analyzed. Isolated
   and purified total RNAs were individually hybridized to the Agilent
   Canine V2 4x44k DNA microarray. The comparison of reference
   differentiated and undifferentiated MCT transcriptome revealed a total
   of 597 differentially expressed genes (147 down-regulated and 450
   up-regulated). The functional analysis of this set of genes provided
   evidence that they were mainly involved in cell cycle, DNA replication,
   p53 signaling pathway, nucleotide excision repair and pyrimidine
   metabolism. Class prediction analysis identified 13 transcripts
   providing the greatest accuracy of class prediction and divided samples
   into two categories (differentiated and undifferentiated), harboring a
   different prognosis. The Principal Component Analysis of all samples,
   made by using the selected 13 markers, confirmed MCT classification. The
   first three components accounted for 99.924\% of the total variance.
   This molecular classification significantly correlated with survival
   time (p = 0.0026). Furthermore, among all marker genes, a significant
   association was found between mRNA expression and MCT-related mortality
   for FOXM1, GSN, FEN1 and KPNA2 (p<0.05). Finally, marker genes mRNA
   expression was evaluated in a cohort of 22 independent samples. Data
   obtained enabled to identify MCT cases with different prognosis.
   Overall, the molecular characterization of canine MCT transcriptome
   allowed the identification of a set of 13 transcripts that clearly
   separated differentiated from undifferentiated MCTs, thus predicting
   outcome regardless of the histological grade. These results may have
   clinical relevance and warrant future validation in a prospective study.}},

Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},

Abstract = {{Background: Trichinella spp. infections in wild boar (Sus scrofa), one
   of the main sources of human trichinellosis, continue to represent a
   public health problem. The detection of Trichinella spp. larvae in
   muscles of wild boar by digestion can prevent the occurrence of clinical
   trichinellosis in humans. However, the analytical sensitivity of
   digestion in the detection process is dependent on the quantity of
   tested muscle. Consequently, large quantities of muscle have to be
   digested to warrant surveillance programs, or more sensitive tests need
   to be employed. The use of indirect detection methods, such as the ELISA
   to detect Trichinella spp. infections in wild boar has limitations due
   to its low specificity. The aim of the study was to implement
   serological detection of anti-Trichinella spp. antibodies in meat juices
   from hunted wild boar for the surveillance of Trichinella spp.
   infections.
   Methods: Two tests were used, ELISA for the initial screening test, and
   a specific and sensitive Western blot (Wb) as a confirmatory test. The
   circulation of anti-Trichinella IgG was determined in hunted wild boar
   muscle juice samples in 9 provinces of 5 Italian regions.
   Results: From 1,462 muscle fluid samples, 315 (21.5\%, 95\% C.I.
   19.51-23.73) were tested positive by ELISA. The 315 ELISA-positive
   muscle fluid samples were further tested by Wb and 32 (10.1\%, 95\% C.I.
   7.29-13.99) of these were positive with a final seroprevalence of 2.2\%
   (95\% C.I 1.55-3.07; 32/1,462). Trichinella britovi larvae were detected
   by artificial digestion in muscle tissues of one (0.07\%, 95\% C.I.
   0.01-0.39) out of the 1,462 hunted wild boars. No Trichinella spp.
   larvae were detected in Wb-negative wild boar. From 2006 to 2012, a
   prevalence of 0.017\% was detected by muscle digestion in wild boar
   hunted in the whole Italian territory.
   Conclusions: The combined use of both serological methods had a
   sensitivity 31.4 times higher than that of the digestion (32/1,462
   versus 1/1,462), suggesting their potential use for the surveillance of
   the Trichinella spp. infection in wild boar populations.}},

Abstract = {{In veal calf production, growth promoters are still illicitly used.
   Surveillance of misuse of such molecules is necessary to preserve human
   health. Methods currently adopted for their analysis are based on liquid
   chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, but their efficacy can be
   affected by undetectable residual concentrations in biological matrices
   due to treatments at low-dosage or based on unknown anabolic compounds.
   The development of screening methods to identify the indirect biological
   effects of administration of growth promoters can improve the efficiency
   of drug residue monitoring. To this purpose, an integrated approach has
   been used to further validate the set of protein biomarkers defined in a
   previous controlled study to detect the use of corticosteroids through
   the changes caused in muscle protein expression. The thymus morphology
   of 48 samples collected under field conditions was evaluated to assess
   the presence of potential corticosteroids treatment. Animals were
   divided on the basis of their thymus characteristics in negative or
   suspected for illegal corticosteroids treatment. Drug residue analyses
   were performed on the liver, giving a satisfactory correlation with the
   histological examination (similar to 85\%). Finally, the proteomics
   analysis of muscle protein extracts was carried out by 2D differential
   in gel electrophoresis, and proteins that were differentially expressed
   between the two animal groups (p value <0.01) were selected for
   MALDI-MS/MS analysis. This approach allowed us to identify 29 different
   proteins, and our findings indicate that the altered protein expression
   pattern can be used as an indirect method for the detection of illicit
   corticosteroids administration. A subset of the identified proteins was
   already reported in a previous controlled study, proving that these
   biomarkers can be used to develop a screening assay to improve the tools
   currently available for the detection of corticosteroids abuse in bovine
   meat production.}},

Abstract = {{Vibrio is a very diverse genus that is responsible for different human
   and animal diseases. The accurate identification of Vibrio at the
   species level is important to assess the risks related to public health
   and diseases caused by aquatic organisms. The ecology of Vibrio spp.,
   together with their genetic background, represents an important key for
   species discrimination and evolution. Thus, analyses of population
   structure and ecology association are necessary for reliable
   characterization of bacteria and to investigate whether bacterial
   species are going through adaptation processes. In this study, a
   population of Vibrionaceae was isolated from shellfish of the Venice
   lagoon and analyzed in depth to study its structure and distribution in
   the environment. A multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) was developed on
   the basis of four housekeeping genes. Both molecular and biochemical
   approaches were used for species characterization, and the results were
   compared to assess the consistency of the two methods. In addition,
   strain ecology and the association between genetic information and
   environment were investigated through statistical models. The
   phylogenetic and population analyses achieved good species clustering,
   while biochemical identification was demonstrated to be imprecise. In
   addition, this study provided a fine-scale overview of the distribution
   of Vibrio spp. in the Venice lagoon, and the results highlighted a
   preferential association of the species toward specific ecological
   variables. These findings support the use of MLSA for taxonomic studies
   and demonstrate the need to consider environmental information to obtain
   broader and more accurate bacterial characterization.}},

Abstract = {{Viral encephalopathy and retinopathy (VER), otherwise known as viral
   nervous necrosis (VNN), is a severe pathological condition caused by RNA
   viruses belonging to the Nodaviridae family, genus Betanodavirus. The
   disease, described in more than 50 fish species worldwide, is considered
   as the most serious viral threat affecting marine farmed species in the
   Mediterranean region, thus representing one of the bottlenecks for
   further development of the aquaculture industry. To date, four different
   genotypes have been identified, namely red-spotted grouper nervous
   necrosis virus (RGNNV), striped jack nervous necrosis virus (SJNNV),
   tiger puffer nervous necrosis virus and barfin flounder nervous necrosis
   virus, with the RGNNV genotype appearing as the most widespread in the
   Mediterranean region, although SJNNV-type strains and reassortant
   viruses have also been reported. The existence of these genetically
   different strains could be the reason for the differences in mortality
   observed in the field. However, very little experimental data are
   available on the pathogenicity of these viruses in farmed fish.
   Therefore, in this study, the pathogenicity of 10 isolates has been
   assessed with an in vivo trial. The investigation was conducted using
   the European sea bass, the first target fish species for the disease in
   the Mediterranean basin. Naive fish were challenged by immersion and
   clinical signs and mortality were recorded for 68days; furthermore,
   samples collected at selected time points were analysed to evaluate the
   development of the infection. Finally, survivors were weighed to
   estimate the growth reduction. The statistically supported results
   obtained in this study demonstrated different pathogenicity patterns,
   underlined the potential risk represented by different strains in the
   transmission of the infection to highly susceptible species and
   highlighted the indirect damage caused by a clinical outbreak of
   VER/VNN.}},

Abstract = {{Cd bioaccumulation pattern was investigated in Mediterranean spider crab
   (Maya squinado, Herbst, 1788) collected from the northern Adriatic Sea.
   Specimens were caught in the framework of a monitoring plan in order to
   quantify the Cd distribution into different organs and tissues of crab.
   For this purpose, Cd level was studied in appendages, cephalothorax,
   abdomen as well as gonads. Cd concentrations were found largely below
   the Maximum Level (ML) established at the European Union (EU) level for
   muscle from crab appendages (found mean 0.011 mg kg(-1)) and
   approximately amounted to 2\% of the EU ML (0.50 mg kg(-1)). The higher
   Cd concentrations were found in organs and tissues included in crab body
   such as abdomen, chephalotorax and gonads with respect to appendages.
   Chephalotorax showed the highest metal concentration (mean value of 1.19
   mg kg(-1)). The possible differences in Cd bioaccumulation rate among
   crab organs and tissues were also investigated applying a parametric
   linear regression. A major Cd bioaccumulation rate was revealed in
   chephalotorax with respect to other analyzed organs and tissues.
   Furthermore, the evaluation of health risk related to human consumption
   of the Mediterranean spider crab has been studied for median of total
   population, median and 95th percentile of consumers of Italy. The
   observed results highlighted that the consumption of organs and tissues
   included in crab body such as abdomen, gonads and, in particular,
   chephalotorax substantially increased the Cd intake reaching also
   alarming Estimated Weekly Intake (EWI) values especially for median and

Abstract = {{Avian influenza (AI) viruses of the H7 subtype have the potential to
   evolve into highly pathogenic (HP) viruses that represent a major
   economic problem for the poultry industry and a threat to global health.
   However, the emergence of HPAI viruses from low-pathogenic (LPAI)
   progenitor viruses currently is poorly understood. To investigate the
   origin and evolution of one of the most important avian influenza
   epidemics described in Europe, we investigated the evolutionary and
   spatial dynamics of the entire genome of 109 H7N1 (46 LPAI and 63 HPAI)
   viruses collected during Italian H7N1 outbreaks between March 1999 and
   February 2001. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the LPAI and HPAI
   epidemics shared a single ancestor, that the HPAI strains evolved from
   the LPAI viruses in the absence of reassortment, and that there was a
   parallel emergence of mutations among HPAI and later LPAI lineages.
   Notably, an ultradeep-sequencing analysis demonstrated that some of the
   amino acid changes characterizing the HPAI virus cluster were already
   present with low frequency within several individual viral populations
   from the beginning of the LPAI H7N1 epidemic. A Bayesian phylogeographic
   analysis revealed stronger spatial structure during the LPAI outbreak,
   reflecting the more rapid spread of the virus following the emergence of
   HPAI. The data generated in this study provide the most complete
   evolutionary and phylogeographic analysis of epidemiologically
   intertwined high- and low-pathogenicity viruses undertaken to date and
   highlight the importance of implementing prompt eradication measures
   against LPAI to prevent the appearance of viruses with fitness
   advantages and unpredictable pathogenic properties.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Speed Leish K (R) is used as a serological screening test
   for Leishmania infection prior to vaccination. Limited comparative
   serological studies with Speed Leish K (R) have been performed. The aim
   of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of four
   commercially available serologic tests including ELISAs (Leiscan (R), ID
   Screen (R) and Leishmania 96 (R)), a rapid test (Speed Leish K (R)) and
   an in-house IFAT for the detection of specific antibodies against
   Leishmania infantum antigen in dogs in different states of infection.
   Methods: Sick infected dogs (n = 36), healthy infected dogs (n = 18), L.
   infantum seropositive dogs with low to high levels of antibodies (n =
   53), dogs seropositive to other pathogens (to evaluate cross reaction)
   (n = 14) and uninfected dogs from a non-endemic area (n = 50) and from
   an endemic area (n = 32) were analysed by the serological methods
   mentioned above.
   Results: The sensitivity was as follows: ID Screen (R) (0.953), Leiscan
   (R) and Leishmania 96 (R) (0.925), IFAT (0.869) and Speed Leish K (R)
   (0.636). The maximum specificity (1.000) was attained for all diagnostic
   tests except the Leishmania 96 (R) (0.896) and IFAT (0.917). The
   accuracy was as follows: ID Screen (R) (0.975), Leiscan (R) (0.961),
   Leishmania 96 (R) (0.911), IFAT (0.892) and Speed Leish K (R) (0.808).
   In relation to the area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC), the maximum value
   was attained with the ID Screen (R) (0.993) closely followed by Leiscan
   (R) (0.990), then, Leishmania 96 (R) (0.962), IFAT (0.926) and Speed
   Leish K (R) (0.818). For the Kappa index, the best result was obtained
   by the ID Screen (R) (0.951) followed by Leiscan (R) (0.921), Leishmania
   96 (R) (0.822), IFAT (0.783) and Speed Leish K (R) (0.622).
   Statistically significant differences were found between the AUC- ROC of
   quantitative serological tests and the only qualitative rapid test
   evaluated. There were also statistically significant differences between
   AUC-ROC of the ELISAs (ID Screen (R) and Leiscan (R)) and IFAT.
   Conclusions: Leiscan (R) and ID Screen (R) had superior diagnostic
   performance measures than IFAT and all quantitative serological tests
   were superior when compared to Speed Leish K (R). Thus, Speed Leish K
   (R) may be considered a less valuable screening test prior to
   vaccination as it may result in vaccination of seropositive dogs and in
   some cases seropositive sick dogs.}},

Abstract = {{Anthelmintic resistance (AR) in ovine gastro-intestinal nematodes has
   been reported to affect the health and productivity of sheep globally.
   The objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of
   commonly used oral drenches in sheep in France, Greece and Italy. In
   each country, 10 farms were selected. On each farm, 50 animals were
   blocked based on the pre-treatment faecal egg count (FEC). Within each
   block, animals were randomly allocated to one of 5 treatment groups. In
   addition to an untreated control group, there were 4 groups treated per
   oral route: moxidectin (MOX) and ivermectin (IVM), both at 0.2 mg/kg
   bodyweight, levamisole (LEV; at 7.5 mg/kg bodyweight) and a
   benzimidazole (BZ; at 3.75-5 mg/kg bodyweight). In France, animals were
   not treated with LEV, but with netobimin (NET; at 7.5 mg/kg bodyweight).
   The FEC was monitored using a modified McMaster technique. Two weeks
   after treatment, individual faecal samples were taken from all animals
   and efficacy was calculated as the difference between arithmetic mean
   FEC of the control group versus each respective treatment group. The
   results of the present study indicate the high efficacy of treatment
   with oral formulations of MOX (99-100\%) and IVM (98-100\%) on all
   farms, except on 1 farm in Greece. On this farm, multi drug resistance
   (MDR) was identified involving 4 anthelmintics (efficacy MOX: 91\%; IVM:
   0\%; BZ: 58\% and LEV: 87\%). In Greece and Italy, AR against LEV and BZ
   was observed on some farms, with MDR involving both anthelmintics on 3
   farms in Greece and on 2 farms in Italy. In France, AR against BZ and
   NET was observed on all 10 farms included. In all countries,
   Teladorsagia sp. was the most common nematode larva identified after
   treatment, followed by Haemonchus sp. and Trichostrongylus sp., with
   differences among farms and treatments. The current study confirms the
   high efficacy of oral treatments with MOX and IVM, even on farms with
   worm populations resistant to BZ, LEV or NET. This study also reports
   MDR against 4 anthelmintics on one farm in Greece. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Data on the occurrence and epidemiology of Aspergillus spp. in laying
   hens farms are scant. With the aims of determining levels of airborne
   contamination in laying hen farms and evaluating the potential risk of
   infection for workers and animals, 57 air samples from 19 sheds (Group
   l), 69 from faeces (Group II), 19 from poultry feedstuffs (Group III)
   and 60 from three anatomical sites (i.e. nostrils, pharynx, ears) of 20
   farm workers (Group IV) were cultured. The Aspergillus spp. prevalence
   in samples ranged from 31.6\% (Group III) to 55.5\% (Group IV), whereas
   the highest conidia concentration was retrieved in Group II (1.2x10(4)
   c.f.u. g(-1)) and in Group III (1.9x10(3) c.f.u. g(-1)). The mean
   concentration of airborne Aspergillus spp. conidia was 70 c.f.u. M-3
   with Aspergillus fumigatus (27.3\%) being the most frequently detected
   species, followed by Aspergillus flavus (6.3\%). These Aspergillus spp.
   were also isolated from human nostrils (40\%) and ears (35\%) (P<0.05)
   (Group IV). No clinical aspergillosis was diagnosed in hens. The results
   demonstrate a relationship between the environmental contamination in
   hen farms and presence of Aspergillus spp. on animals and humans. Even
   if the concentration of airborne Aspergillus spp. conidia (i.e. 70
   c.f.u. m(-3)) herein detected does not trigger clinical disease in hens,
   it causes human colonization. Correct management of hen farms is
   necessary to control environmental contamination by Aspergillus spp.,
   and could lead to a significant reduction of animal and human
   colonization.}},

Abstract = {{In Italy, West Nile virus (WNV) equine outbreaks have occurred annually
   since 2008. Characterizing WNV vector habitat requirements allows for
   the identification of areas at risk of viral amplification and
   transmission. Maxent-based ecological niche models were developed using
   literature records of 13 potential WNV Italian vector mosquito species
   to predict their habitat suitability range and to investigate possible
   geographical associations with WNV equine outbreak occurrence in Italy
   from 2008 to 2010. The contribution of different environmental variables
   to the niche models was also assessed. Suitable habitats for Culex
   pipiens, Aedes albopictus, and Anopheles maculipennis were widely
   distributed; Culex modestus, Ochlerotatus geniculatus, Ochlerotatus
   caspius, Coquillettidia richiardii, Aedes vexans, and Anopheles plumbeus
   were concentrated in north-central Italy; Aedes cinereus, Culex
   theileri, Ochlerotatus dorsalis, and Culiseta longiareolata were
   restricted to coastal/southern areas. Elevation, temperature, and
   precipitation variables showed the highest predictive power. Host
   population and landscape variables provided minor contributions. WNV
   equine outbreaks had a significantly higher probability to occur in
   habitats suitable for Cx. modestus and Cx. pipiens, providing
   circumstantial evidence that the potential distribution of these two
   species coincides geographically with the observed distribution of the
   disease in equines.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, 50 livestock watering sources (ground water) and 50 field
   irrigation sources (surface water) from various industrialised areas of
   the Veneto region were monitored for chemical contaminants. From each
   site, four water samples (one in each season) were collected during the
   period from summer 2009 through to spring 2010. Surface water samples
   and ground water samples were first screened for toxicity using the
   growth inhibition test on Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and the
   immobilisation test on Daphnia magna, respectively. Then, based on the
   results of these toxicity tests, 28 ground water samples and 26 surface
   water samples were submitted to chemical analysis for various
   contaminants (insecticides/acaricides, fungicides, herbicides, metals
   and anions) by means of UPLC-MSn HPLC-MSn, AAS and IEC. With the
   exception of one surface water sample where the total pesticides
   concentration was greater than 4 mu g L-1, positive samples (51.9 \%)
   showed only traces (nanograms per liter) of pesticides. Metals were
   generally under the detection limit. High concentrations of chlorines
   (up to 692 mg L-1) were found in some ground water samples while some
   surface water samples showed an excess of nitrites (up to 336 mg L-1).
   Detected levels of contamination were generally too low to justify the
   toxicity recorded in bioassays, especially in the case of surface water
   samples, and analytical results painted quite a reassuring picture,
   while tests on P. subcapitata showed a strong growth inhibition
   activity. It was concluded that, from an ecotoxicological point of view,
   surface waters used for field irrigation in the Veneto region cannot be
   considered safe.}},

Abstract = {{Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are toxins biosynthesised by plants and
   they are known to be present in approximately 6000 plant species, about
   3\% of all flowering plants. PAs are probably the most widely
   distributed natural toxins and represent a potential risk to human
   health, since poisoning caused by these toxins is associated with acute
   and chronic liver damage and may lead to death. One of the most common
   sources of PAs exposure in humans is honey consumption. We have
   developed a quick and easy method to quantify nine different PAs
   (echimidine, heliotrine, intermedine, lycopsamine, lasiocarpine,
   retrorsine, seneciphylline, senecionine, senkirkine) in honey based on
   QuEChERS sample extraction and ultra fast liquid chromatography coupled
   with mass spectrometry detection. We performed a validation study of the
   method and it resulted in good precision and accuracy, high recoveries,
   and good linear calibrations. The limit of detection ranged from 0.021
   to 1.39 mu g Kg(-1) and the limit of quantification from 0.081 to 435 mu
   g Kg-1. This new approach was applied to the quantification of PAs in
   retail honeys purchased in local supermarkets, classified by their
   country of origin: Italian honeys, blends of honey of European countries
   and blends of honey of European and non-European countries. The
   concentrations detected ranged from 1 to 169 mu g PAs/kg(-1) with higher
   concentrations in blends of European and non-European honeys. This study
   reveals that many samples tested would exceed the tolerable daily intake
   suggested for these substances and they could be a hazard to human
   health. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Since 2010 Veneto region (North-Eastern Italy) planned a
   special integrated surveillance of summer fevers to promptly identify
   cases of West Nile Fever (WNF), dengue (DENV) and chikungunya (CHIKV).
   The objectives of this study were (i) To increase the detection rate of
   imported CHIKV and DENV cases in travellers from endemic areas and
   promptly identify potential autochthonous cases.(ii) To detect
   autochthonous cases of WNF, besides those of West Nile Neuroinvasive
   Disease (WNND) that were already included in a national surveillance.
   Methods: Human surveillance: a traveler who had returned within the
   previous 15 days from endemic countries, with fever >38 degrees C,
   absence of leucocytosis (leukocyte count <10,000 mu L), and absence of
   other obvious causes of fever, after ruling out malaria, was considered
   a possible case of CHIKV or DENV. A possible autochthonous case of WNF
   was defined as a patient with fever >38 degrees C for <7 days, no recent
   travel history and absence of other obvious causes of fever. Entomologic
   surveillance: for West Nile (WNV) it was carried out from May through
   November placing CDC-CO2 traps in five provinces of Veneto Region, while
   for DENV and CHIKV it was also performed around residences of viremic
   cases.
   Results: Human surveillance: between 2010 and 2012, 234 patients with
   fever after travelling were screened, of which 27 (11,5\%) were found
   infected (24 with DENV and 3 with CHIKV). No autochthonous case of DENV
   or CHIKV was detected. Autochthonous patients screened for WNF were 408,
   and 24 (5,9\%) were confirmed cases. Entomologic surveillance: the WNV
   was found in 10, 2 and 11 pools of Culex pipiens from 2010 to 2012
   respectively, in sites of Rovigo, Verona, Venezia and Treviso
   provinces). No infected Aedes albopictus with DENV or CHIKV was found.
   Conclusions: Veneto is the only Italian region reporting WNV human cases
   every year since 2008. WNV is likely to cause sporadic cases and
   unforeseeable outbreaks for decades. Including WNF in surveillance
   provides additional information and possibly an early alert system.
   Timely detection of DENV and CHIKV should prompt vector control measures
   to prevent local outbreaks.}},

Title = {{Association between serological response and shedding of Coxiella
   burnetii in milk in dairy cattle}},
Journal = {{LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{3-8}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Introduction - In dairy cows, the shedding of C. burnetii occurs mainly
   through milk and can last up to 32 months postpartum. PCR testing of
   individual milk samples is the most efficient way to detect the
   shedders, but also very expensive. An affordable approach could be a
   preliminary serological investigation of the herd, to further select
   which cows should be further tested by PCR.
   Aim - The aim of this study was to evaluate the relation between the
   serological status of the cows in infected herds and the occurrence of
   C. burnetii shedding in milk.
   Materials and methods -The study involved 4 dairy farms in Veneto region
   (North-east of Italy) with previous history of Q fever abortions. Serum
   and milk samples were collected from all the lactating cows of each
   farm. Sera were tested using a manual complement fixation test (CFT)
   with a cutoff titre of 1: 10, and a commercial indirect ELISA kit (LSI).
   Milk samples were subjected to a commercial real-time PCR kit
   (ADIAVET(R) COX REALTIME) for bacterial DNA detection. The relation
   between serological response to C. burnetii infection and bacteria milk
   shedding was evaluated by means of the odds ratio (OR).
   Results and discussion -A mong 577 sera collected 138 (23,92\%) tested
   positive to the ELISA, while 55 (9,53\%) were positive to CFT. ELISA
   seropositive cows ranged in the herds from 8,43 to 39,67\%. The cows
   with PCR positive milk were 36 (6,24\%), ranging from 3,76 to 13,08\% of
   lactating cows in 3 herds, while in the farm with the lowest number of
   ELISA seropositive animals (8,43\%), no milk shedders were found. Out of
   the 36 cows with PCR positive milk, 11 had no antibodies detectable by
   ELISA and CFT, 10 were ELISA positive but CFT negative, and 15 were
   positive to both the serological tests. The probability of seropositive
   cows to shed C. burnetii in milk was 9 time higher than in seronegative
   cows using either ELISA test or CFT to detect the antibodies (OR 8,94
   for CFT and 8,61 for ELISA). If the ELISA cut-off is increased to a S/p
   value > 2, the probability of seropositive cows to have PCR positive
   milk is 12 time higher than seronegative ones.
   Conclusion - This survey showed that, in infected herds, the number of
   cows shedding C. burnetii in milk is relatively low compared to the
   number of seropositive animals. ELISA test, especially using a higher
   cut-off value, could be an useful tool to identify the cows to be
   further tested by means of PCR. As previously described, it should be
   noticed that shedding of C. burnetii in milk occurred also in
   seronegative cows.}},

Abstract = {{Newcastle disease (ND) is a highly contagious disease that affects many
   species of birds and causes significant economic losses to the poultry
   industry worldwide. Fifteen Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolates
   obtained from rural chickens in northwest Ethiopia in 2011 and 2012 were
   characterized genotypically. The main functional region of the F gene
   was amplified and sequenced (260 nucleotides). Among the Ethiopian NDV
   isolates, 2 isolates had the virulent motif R-112-R-Q-K-R-F-117 at the
   cleavage site of the fusion protein while 13 isolates contained the
   lentogenic motif (112)G-G/R-Q-G-R-L-117. Phylogenetic analysis based on
   the variable region of the F gene indicated that the two isolates
   exhibiting the virulent motif belonged to lineage 5 (genotype VII)
   subgenotype d and the remaining 13 isolates were grouped into lineage 2
   (genotype II). The nucleotide sequences of lineage 5 isolates were
   genetically related to the Sudanese NDV isolates, suggesting potential
   epidemiological link of ND outbreaks between neighbouring countries. The
   lentogenic strains shared similarities with La Sota vaccine strain and
   probably originated from the vaccine strain either through direct
   exposure of birds to the live vaccine or to infectious La Sota-like
   strains circulating in rural poultry. This study provides genetic
   evidence on the existence of different NDV genotypes circulating in the
   rural poultry in Ethiopia. The virulent NDV continues to be a problem in
   poultry sector in Ethiopia, and their continuous circulation in rural
   and commercial poultry calls for improved surveillance and intensified
   vaccination and other control measures.}},

Abstract = {{Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar 4,{[}5],12:i:- DT193 is
   recognized as an emerging monophasic variant of Salmonella Typhimurium
   in many European countries. Resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin,
   sulphonamides, and tetracycline (R-type ASSuT) is described as one of
   the most common profiles of resistance within this clone. Recently,
   strains presenting such features were isolated from two unrelated
   outbreaks in Italy. Strains were characterized by pulsed-field gel
   electrophoresis (PFGE), performed with XbaI, BlnI, and SpeI, and
   multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). XbaI-PFGE
   showed strains related to the two outbreaks as indistinguishable.
   Conversely, both BlnI-PFGE and MLVA characterized the strains related
   the two outbreaks as different. XbaI-PFGE identified two profiles,
   differing by one band, within strains isolated from one of the two
   outbreaks. Also BlnI-PFGE and MLVA generated different profiles among
   the strains related to that outbreak. Combining the PFGE profiles
   obtained by XbaI and BlnI and comparing them with the MLVA profiles, the
   two methods grouped the same isolates based on identity. Moreover,
   genomic deletions of the genes included in the operon fljAB, the
   flanking iroB gene, and the closely located STM2757 gene were
   investigated. For all strains, the same profile of deletion
   characterized by the absence of fljA, fljB, and hin genes and the
   presence of STM2757 and iroB genes was identified. This profile of
   deletion represents a mixture between two profiles of Salmonella
   4,{[}5],12:i:- described as the Spanish and the U.S. clones. This study
   demonstrated that although strains of Salmonella 4,{[}5],12:i:- DT193
   ASSuT are highly clonal, minor differences between strains may be seen
   during the same outbreak by using in parallel PFGE with different
   restriction enzymes, MLVA, and the analysis of molecular markers related
   to the operon fljAB. The combination of these different molecular
   approaches was essential to clarify the epidemiological relationship
   among the strains.}},

   Outbreak Heterogeneity in Domestic Poultry in Italy}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Month = {{JAN 22}},
Abstract = {{Italy has experienced recurrent incursions of H5N2 avian influenza (AI)
   viruses in different geographical areas and varying sectors of the
   domestic poultry industry. Considering outbreak heterogeneity rather
   than treating all outbreaks of low pathogenicity AI (LPAI) viruses
   equally is important given their interactions with the environment and
   potential to spread, evolve and increase pathogenicity. This study aims
   at identifying potential environmental drivers of H5N2 LPAI outbreak
   occurrence in time, space and poultry populations. Thirty-four
   environmental variables were tested for association with the
   characteristics of 27 H5N2 LPAI outbreaks (i.e. time, place, flock type,
   number and species of birds affected) occurred among domestic poultry
   flocks in Italy in 2010-2012. This was done by applying a recently
   proposed analytical approach based on a combined non-metric
   multidimensional scaling, clustering and regression analysis. Results
   indicated that the pattern of (dis) similarities among the outbreaks
   entailed an underlying structure that may be the outcome of large-scale,
   environmental interactions in ecological dimension. Increased densities
   of poultry breeders, and increased land coverage by industrial,
   commercial and transport units were associated with increased
   heterogeneity in outbreak characteristics. In areas with high breeder
   densities and with many infrastructures, outbreaks affected mainly
   industrial turkey/layer flocks. Outbreaks affecting ornamental,
   commercial and rural multi-species flocks occurred mainly in lowly
   infrastructured areas of northern Italy. Outbreaks affecting rural layer
   flocks occurred mainly in areas with low breeder densities in
   south-central Italy. In savannah-like environments, outbreaks affected
   mainly commercial flocks of galliformes. Suggestive evidence that
   ecological ordination makes sense genetically was also provided, as
   virus strains showing high genetic similarity clustered into
   ecologically similar outbreaks. Findings were informed by hypotheses
   about how ecological interactions among poultry populations, viruses and
   their environments can be related to the observed patterns of H5N2 LPAI
   occurrence. This may prove useful in enhancing future interventions by
   developing site-specific, ecologically-grounded strategies.}},

   vector Culex pipiens in a repeatedly affected area in Italy}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: The recent spread of West Nile Virus in temperate countries
   has raised concern. Predicting the likelihood of transmission is crucial
   to ascertain the threat to Public and Veterinary Health. However,
   accurate models of West Nile Virus (WNV) expansion in Europe may be
   hampered by limited understanding of the population dynamics of their
   primary mosquito vectors and their response to environmental changes.
   Methods: We used data collected in north-eastern Italy (2009-2011) to
   analyze the determinants of the population growth rate of the primary
   WNV vector Culex pipiens. A series of alternative growth models were
   fitted to longitudinal data on mosquito abundance to evaluate the
   strength of evidence for regulation by intrinsic density-dependent
   and/or extrinsic environmental factors. Model-averaging algorithms were
   then used to estimate the relative importance of intrinsic and extrinsic
   variables in describing the variations of per-capita growth rates.
   Results: Results indicate a much greater contribution of
   density-dependence in regulating vector population growth rates than of
   any environmental factor on its own. Analysis of an average model of Cx.
   pipiens growth revealed that the most significant predictors of their
   population dynamics was the length of daylight, estimated population
   size and temperature conditions in the 15 day period prior to sampling.
   Other extrinsic variables (including measures of precipitation, number
   of rainy days, and humidity) had only a minor influence on Cx. pipiens
   growth rates.
   Conclusions: These results indicate the need to incorporate density
   dependence in combination with key environmental factors for robust
   prediction of Cx. pipiens population expansion and WNV transmission
   risk. We hypothesize that detailed analysis of the determinants of
   mosquito vector growth rate as conducted here can help identify when and
   where an increase in vector population size and associated WNV
   transmission risk should be expected.}},

Abstract = {{The increased consumption of fish products, as well as the occurrence of
   exotic fish species in the Mediterranean Sea and in the fish market, has
   increased the risk of commercial fraud. Furthermore, the great amount of

   and unambiguous detection of polymorphisms between species, permitting
   differentiation and identification of both commercial fraud and
   introduction of species with potential toxic effects on humans. In this
   study, a novel DNA-based approach for differentiation of fish species
   based on pyrosequencing technology has been developed. Raw and processed
   fish products were tested, and up to 25 species of fish belonging to
   Clupeiformes and Pleuronectiformes groups were uniquely and rapidly
   identified. The proper identification based on short and unique genetic
   sequence signatures demonstrates that this approach is promising and
   cost-effective for large-scale surveys.}},

Abstract = {{The first detection of Aethina tumida Murray (the small hive beetle) in
   Italy occurred on 5 September 2014. Three nuclei containing honey bees
   (Apis mellifera) and located in a clementine (citrus) orchard near an
   important international harbour in the Calabria region (southern Italy)
   were heavily infested with adult and larval A. tumida. A. tumida
   infestation is a notifiable disease of honey bees in the European Union
   as well as an OIE listed disease. To prevent any A. tumida introduction,
   the importation of honey bees is regulated strictly in the European
   Union (Commission Regulation (EU) No. 206/2010). Early reaction measures
   adopted in Italy require that beekeepers must notify A. tumida discovery
   to the local veterinary services and cannot move their colonies.
   Furthermore, a protection area (20 km radius) and surveillance (100 km
   radius) zone should be established. The surveillance zone now includes
   the entire territory of Calabria region. Compulsory visits to all
   apiaries in the protection zone with the collection of the spatial
   information by means of a georeferentiation process (georeferentiation
   can be defined as the process to describe a location relative to the
   earth, in this context the process consists on the collection of the
   spatial coordinate of a point that represents the spatial location of
   the apiaries by means of a GPS device) and colony inspection according
   to 5\% expected prevalence (95\% CI) are applied. Destruction of
   infested apiaries is compulsory and the soil under the infested colonies
   must be ploughed and treated with pyrethroids. If apiaries in the
   protection zone are found to be negative, traps are placed. In the
   surveillance zone, veterinarians visit apiaries that are selected
   according to a risk analysis (migration in infested areas, honey bee or
   materials exchange) or randomly and colonies are inspected according to
   2\% expected prevalence (95\% CI). Furthermore, in Italy as well in the
   rest of Europe, investigations are in progress by competent authorities
   to make an inventory of all bees and colonies moved from Calabria during
   2014. Subsequent controls on colonies should be implemented. People from
   the honey bee network (beekeepers, veterinarians, beekeeping material
   producers and distributors) should be aware and informed of the hazard
   posed by A. tumida to honey bees.}},

Abstract = {{The sarcoptic mange epizootic affecting chamois in the Dolomites Alps
   since 1995 has risen considerable concern in a management and
   conservation perspective, due to its strong impact on chamois and ibex
   populations. A remarkable amount of data has been collected by different
   wildlife research and management institutions, in order to analyze mange
   patterns and develop possible strategies to control the disease. The
   present study is aimed at providing a population-related figure of the
   spatial and temporal dynamics of clinical sarcoptic mange in alpine
   chamois, proposing an approach in which relevant basic concepts and
   parameters, as the definition of the epidemic front and its spreading
   speed, can be estimated and framed. The epidemic front was referred to
   the different mountain massifs, corresponding to well established
   management units of the chamois in the study area; moreover, the
   mange-related mortality peak at the massif level was used (in
   substitution of the index case/s) for temporal analysis of the disease
   spreading. Two speeds of the front have been estimated: a first raw
   average speed of about 3.38 km/year, and a second refined speed of 4.64
   +/- 3.12 km/year, more consistent to the variability in the field. The
   time series analysis showed that the impact of mange increases over the
   late winter months, reaching a peak in early spring.

   new frame to include other studies in progress on the Alpine

Abstract = {{Educational interventions in school represent a primary way to introduce
   children to public health issues. In particular, as foodborne diseases
   are considered a worldwide significant problem, according to the World
   Health Organization (WHO), an educational program has been implemented
   to improve children knowledge about microorganisms' characteristics and
   food contamination, and their everyday behaviors concerning personal
   hygiene. Twelve public schools in Padua province were enrolled, for a
   total of 249 children attending the fifth grade of primary school.
   Health programs are usually targeted to adults and teenagers; a method
   that take into account children's peculiar learning and communicative
   skills was adopted. Aim of the study is to determine whether
   interventions based on practical activities that dynamically involve
   children with experiments and scientific observations are more efficient
   that purely theoretical programs. To assess the different effectiveness
   of the interventions, a between subjects experimental design has been
   set up, with random assignment of classes to theoretical (N=120) and
   practical (N=123) groups. The evaluation of children knowledge was
   assessed in two ways: 1) the analysis of a questionnaire collected
   before and after the intervention; 2) the analysis of a creative drawing
   about the microorganisms collected before and after the intervention
   that has been related to a semi-structured interview, to comprehend the
   meanings of the picture. Results show that although both the programs
   (theoretical and practical) were effective, the practical work
   stimulated a qualitatively deeper comprehension of the given
   information, especially in relation to the causal linkage between
   protective behaviors and control of contagion risk. (C) 2013 The Authors

   percentage of young queens in the colonies before winter, extent of
   queen problems in summer, treatment of the varroa mite, and access by
   foraging honey bees to oilseed rape and maize. Spatial variation at the

Abstract = {{AimThe aim of this work was to evaluate the efficacy of domestic cooking
   in inactivating Manila clams experimentally infected with murine
   norovirus (MNV).
   Methods and ResultsA cooking pan was modified to enable electronic
   temperature probes to be positioned to record both flesh and environment
   temperature. Manila clams were infected with 10(4)TCID50\%ml(-1) of MNV.
   The infected whole-in-shell clams, divided into three replicates, were
   cooked on an electric stove, and groups of nine clams were removed from
   the pan at fixed intervals. Pools of three digestive glands were
   examined by virus isolation to ascertain residual viral load.
   ConclusionResults showed that 10min of cooking by a traditional domestic
   method at a temperature close to 100 degrees C, for at least 2min, can
   completely devitalize the MNV in infected clams. This is generally the
   time needed for the majority of valves to open up.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyAt present, it is highly recommended
   to label all lagoon products as requiring cooking before consumption',
   but no specifications are given on how long and at what temperature they
   should be cooked. Our results can provide the consumer with useful

Abstract = {{Bivalve molluscs, such as Venerupis philippinarum, are often used as
   bioindicators of environmental pollution since they can bioaccumulate a
   large variety of pollutants because of their filter feeding. The
   Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) is an
   important contaminant, commonly present in the marine environment.
   Pollutants are generally metabolized by enzymes of phase I, mainly CYPs
   enzymes, and by conjugation enzymes of phase II like GST. In this study,
   we investigated by Real Time PCR the expression of CYP4 and GSTr (GST
   class rho) in the digestive gland of V. philippinarum exposed to
   different concentrations of B(a)P for 24 h and after a 24 h depuration
   period. Accumulation of B(a)P by clams has been confirmed by the
   HPLC-FLD analyses. Moreover, HPLC-FLD analyses evidenced that after
   depuration, B(a)P concentrations decreased in animals subjected to 0.03
   mg/l and 0.5 mg/l exposures but did not decrease in animals subjected to
   1 mg/l exposure. B(a)P exposure and depuration did not cause
   histopathological lesions in the different organs. The analysis of GSTr
   expression in the digestive gland showed a significant increase in mRNA
   in animals subjected to 1 mg/l exposure, whereas the analysis of CYP4
   expression did not evidence differences among treatments. Moreover, the
   expression of both genes did not exhibit any differences after the
   purification treatment. The results demonstrate that B(a)P significantly
   affects the expression of GSTr mRNA in the digestive gland of V.
   philippinarum and suggest that GSTr gene could play an important role in

Abstract = {{Introduction:
   The IZSV-edu project was realized within the framework issued by the
   European Union, along with the strategy for animal health and public
   health 2007-2013, which aims to ensure public health through the
   reduction of food risks, providing clear and transparent information to
   consumers. In this context, the Istituto Zoooprofilattico Sperimentale
   delle Venezie (IZSVe), in collaboration with the Regional School Office
   for the Veneto Region (USR), has designed and implemented the 2-years
   project ``IZSV-edu{''}, directed at high school students. The first
   edition was held between November 2011 and May 2012, and the second was
   held between November 2012 and May 2013, in 3 different Regions of
   North-Italy.
   Aims and methodology:
   The project was designed to promote health education, to improve
   students' knowledge and to develop technical competencies in the context
   of food safety and risk communication, within the methodological
   framework of ``learning by doing{''}. In addition to these educational
   goals, scientific data were collected on knowledge, attitudes,
   intentions and habits of the students, in order to evaluate the
   effectiveness of an integrated ``theoretical-practical{''} approach,
   compared to a classical one. All the lessons were given by experts and
   researchers from the IZSVe, paying particular attention to the
   development of science and risk communication skills.
   Results:
   The 1st edition was attended by 850 students (35 classes, 140 lessons).
   Teachers and students could choose among more than 20 different didactic
   modules, including microbiology, chemistry, hystopatology, parasitology,
   virology, molecular biology, epidemiology, risk and science
   communication. In this edition, from an initial situation of correct
   knowledge equal to 63.1 \%, after the introductory course it passed to
   89\%. The general learning scored a satisfactory result, with 83, 1\% of
   correct questions after the intervention.
   The 2nd edition was attended by 175 students (12 classes, 18 lessons),
   and it was focused on chemical risks in food and risk communication. The
   classes were divided into two laboratories, virtual lab and practical
   lab. A risk communication lab followed. The learning evaluation shows
   that the mean number of correct answers is higher after the
   intervention; comparing the two methods there are significant
   differences in the mean number of correct answers given in the
   questionnaire ex-post: virtual = 15,54; practical = 14,86 (F=4,386;
   p=0,038).
   For both the editions students were required to realize effective
   science and risk communication products.
   Discussion and conclusion:
   The project succeeded in transferring knowledge and skills to students
   and schools have demonstrated a keen interest in the proposal. The
   satisfaction was generally high: 97\% of teachers have expressed a
   ``good{''} or ``very good{''} preference, while among students was
   94.5\%.
   The didactic modules attracted considerable scientific interest in
   current issues, and they proved to be essential for learning contents,
   providing an added value with respect to the traditional teachings. On
   the other side, the science communication modules resulted innovative
   and challenging, for the proper understanding of the relationship
   between science, media and society.}},

Title = {{Multiplex Evaluation of Influenza Neutralizing Antibodies with Potential
   Applicability to In-Field Serological Studies}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{The increased number of outbreaks of H5 and H7 LPAI and HPAI viruses in
   poultry has major public and animal health implications. The continuous
   rapid evolution of these subtypes and the emergence of new variants
   influence the ability to undertake effective surveillance. Retroviral
   pseudotypes bearing influenza haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA)
   envelope glycoproteins represent a flexible platform for sensitive,
   readily standardized influenza serological assays. We describe a
   multiplex assay for the study of neutralizing antibodies that are
   directed against both influenza H5 and H7 HA. This assay permits the
   measurement of neutralizing antibody responses against two antigenically
   distinct HAs in the same serum/plasma sample thus increasing the amount
   and quality of serological data that can be acquired from valuable sera.
   Sera obtained from chickens vaccinated with a monovalent H5N2 vaccine,
   chickens vaccinated with a bivalent H7N1/H5N9 vaccine, or turkeys
   naturally infected with an H7N3 virus were evaluated in this assay and
   the results correlated strongly with data obtained by HI assay. We show
   that pseudotypes are highly stable under basic cold-chain storage
   conditions and following multiple rounds of freeze-thaw. We propose that
   this robust assay may have practical utility for in-field
   serosurveillance and vaccine studies in resource-limited regions
   worldwide.}},

Abstract = {{The study addressed the communication of chemical risks in food to
   adolescents with a view to evaluating the potential, the effectiveness
   and the limitations of web- and paper-based tools. The tools were
   developed through a participatory process based on the active
   involvement of the target group. The method used to convey the
   communication message was storytelling.
   A sample of 327 students living in north-eastern Italy evaluated the
   tools through two questionnaires. An assessment was made of the tools'
   effectiveness in transmitting knowledge, changing perceptions of
   chemical risks and arousing students' interest. Results showed that
   perception of chemical risks and scientific knowledge increased
   significantly among participants following exposure to both
   communication tools, but the paper-based tool was the preferred medium.
   The digital tool exhibited comparable effectiveness to the paper tool in
   terms of improving learning and changing risk perception, making it a
   valuable tool in the design of risk-prevention campaigns. However, the
   paper-based tool met higher approval, suggesting that further studies
   are needed in Italy to better understand young people's preferences in
   media usage and the correlations between approval, learning and changes
   in behaviours. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of the H5N1 subtype emerged in
   Far East Asia in 1996 and spread in three continents in a period of 10
   or less years. Before this event, avian influenza infections caused by
   highly pathogenic viruses had occurred in many different countries,
   causing minor or major outbreaks, and had always been eradicated.
   The unique features of these H5N1 viruses combined to the geographic
   characteristics of the area of emergence, including animal husbandry
   practices, has caused this subtype to become endemic in several Asian
   countries, as well as in Egypt. Our aim is to review the direct and
   indirect control strategies with the rationale for use, advantages and
   shortcomings particularly resulting from practicalities linked to field
   application and economic constraints. Certainly, in low income countries
   which have applied vaccination, this has resulted in a failure to
   eradicate the infection. Although the number of infected countries has
   dropped from over 40 (2006) to under 10 (2012), the extensive
   circulation of H5N1 in areas with high poultry density still represents
   a risk for public and animal health. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Adopting a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design, this study evaluated whether

   vs. females) have an effect on the prevalence of lung lesions and
   oesophago-gastric ulcer (OGU) visually scored at slaughter in 635
   Italian heavy pigs (169 +/- 4 kg). The lung lesions were very low (72\%
   of pigs with score 0), and were not significantly different among the
   experimental groups. Overall, OGU was diagnosed in 47\% of the pigs. The
   consumption of small amounts of straw (70 g/day/pig) represented a
   protective factor against the onset of OGU (OR: 0.27). Barrows were more
   likely than females to have OGU (OR: 1.52), while no significant
   differences between docked and undocked pigs were detected.
   Nevertheless, the presence of straw acted as a protective factor

Abstract = {{The wedge clam Donax trunculus Linnaeus, 1758 is one of the most common
   bivalve molluscs inhabiting the sandy shores of the Mediterranean Sea
   and is considered an important commercial resource. In this study, we
   report the first molecular, morphological and histopathological
   descriptions of metacercariae from a trematode belonging to the genus
   Postmonorchis (Digenea: Monorchiidae) that infects D. trunculus in
   natural beds of the Italian Tyrrhenian coast (Campania, Lazio and
   Tuscany). Morphological analysis of the parasite revealed a combination
   of features that exist in the 3 previously identified species of
   Postmonorchis, viz. P. donacis, P. variabilis and P. orthopristis, with
   the addition of new, distinctive morphological characteristics. The
   pathogen exhibited a predilection for the gill; however, it was also
   present in the labial palp and mantle in addition to the gut, kidney
   epithelium and foot. The inflammatory response was characterised by
   either a focal or diffuse haemocyte infiltration followed by the
   formation of multiple, large multi-layered capsules associated with
   tissue destruction. The prevalence of the pathogen ranged from 75 to
   100\%, while the infection intensity fluctuated among the study areas.
   Further studies regarding the life cycle of this parasite and the
   identification of other larval and adult stages and their respective
   hosts may confirm the identification of a new species of Postmonorchis
   that infects wedge clams in Mediterranean waters. The study of the
   parasite is completed by molecular analysis of the ITS1 and ITS2 rDNA

Abstract = {{Background: The container breeding species belonging to the genus Aedes
   (Meigen) are frequently recorded out of their place of origin. Invasive
   Aedes species are proven or potential vectors of important Arboviruses
   and their establishment in new areas pose a threat for human and animal
   health. A new species of exotic mosquito was recorded in 2011 in
   north-eastern Italy: Aedes (Finlaya) koreicus {[}Hulecoeteomyia
   koreica]. The aim of this study was to characterize the biology, the
   environment and the current distribution of this mosquito in
   north-eastern Italy. Morphological details useful to discriminate this
   species from other invasive Aedes mosquitoes are also given (see
   Additional files).
   Methods: All possible breeding sites for larval development were
   monitored. In addition, ovitraps and traps for adults were used to
   collect eggs and adults. The mosquitoes (larvae and adults) were
   identified morphologically and molecularly. Environmental data and
   climatic variables during the period of mosquito activity (from April to
   October) were considered.
   Results: Aedes koreicus was found in 37 municipalities (39.4\%) and was
   detected in 40.2\% of places and in 37.3\% of larval habitats monitored,
   in a range of altitude from 173 to 1250 m.a.s.l.. Garden centres were
   the most common locations (66.7\%), followed by streets/squares
   (57.1\%), private gardens (46.4\%) and cemeteries (21.1\%) (p < 0.01).
   The main larval habitats were catch basins (48.5\%) and artificial water
   containers (41.8\%). As for Aedes albopictus {[}Stegomyia albopicta],
   ovitraps were attractive for adult females resulting in the higher rate
   of positivity (15/21; 71.4\%) among breeding sites. The period of Ae.
   koreicus activity ranged from March 29 to October 29.
   Conclusion: The species is clearly established in the area and is now
   overlapping with other vectors such as Ae. albopictus and colonizing
   areas over 800 m.a.s.l, not yet or sporadically reached by the tiger
   mosquito. The data collected are essential to assess the risk of
   colonization of other parts of Italy and Europe, as well as the risk of
   spreading of pathogens transmitted. These findings stress the importance
   of implementing entomological surveillance for early detection of
   invasive species, which is necessary for eradication or limitation of
   its further spread.}},

Abstract = {{After 20 years of absence, rabies re-emerged in wild animals in
   north-eastern Italy in October 2008. Besides measures undertaken to
   fight the spread of infection in wildlife, vaccination against rabies
   was made compulsory for dogs living in the risk area. In the last 15
   years, the veterinary authorities have focused on implementing
   computerized data collection systems in animal health, to serve as
   working tools for epidemiological surveillance activities and
   emergencies management. The prerequisite for implementing any data
   collection system is knowledge of the animal population. This also
   applies to the Canine Registry Data Bank, in which data on dogs and
   their movements, together with personal data on each owner and keeper,
   have been stored since 2003. The management information system has been
   updated and specific functions have been integrated in order to support
   the activity of both the veterinary services and the veterinary
   practitioners involved in the dog vaccination program. Vaccination
   became voluntary in February 2013. This paper describes implementation
   of the software and organization of data gathering, highlighting the
   benefits of computerized data compared to previously used paper-based
   data collection systems. The new functions, designed to centralize
   collection of uniform, updated vaccination data, have led to more
   efficient organization and better control of the vaccination plan.
   Automated information processing allowed vaccination operations to be
   supervised, incurred costs to be calculated, and vaccination coverage of
   the dog population to be monitored during the 3 years of compulsory

   first time in 1998 in China. In the autumn of 2011 it caused a
   small-scale epidemic in non-vaccinated meat chickens in farms located in
   Northern Italy. The disease was characterized by increased mortality,

   confirmed the nephritis and described an unusual erosive/necrotic
   proventriculitis with infiltration of lymphocytes, plasma cells and
   heterophils, as well as fibroplasia in the lamina propria. Despite these

   proventricular tissue, further studies are necessary to confirm the role
   of this IBV strain in the development of proventricular lesions.
   Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all the IBV isolates were very
   similar and probably had a common origin. The IBV Q1 variant appears to

Title = {{Practical experience on the use of injectable transponders in a flock of
   Ouessant sheep}},
Journal = {{LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Introduction - According to the Reg. (EC) N. 1560/2000, electronic
   identification has become compulsory for sheep and goats born after
   31/12/2009 in all EU countries. The electronic identifiers include
   bolus, eartag, tag on the pastern and injectable transponder (TIP). The
   TIP may be a valid alternative to bolus or eartag in sheep or goat
   breeds of small size, even though any type of TIP hasn't been approved
   in Italy yet.
   Aim - This paper describes a practical experience conducted throughout 2
   years in a small flock of Ouessant sheep, in order to gather information
   useful for the authorization of this device.
   Materials and methods -The Ouessant rams reach 48-50 cm in height at
   withers and weigh 15-22 kg, the ewes are even smaller. At the beginning
   the herd consisted of 27 subjects of which 18 were ewes. In these
   animals, the black colour of the coat doesn't allow the tattoo and the
   ears are too small to apply the eartags authorized in Italy, therefore
   it was obtained the permission to use special aluminium eartags.
   The TIP used is 23 mm x 3.85 mm, 0.6g of weight, with an operating
   frequency of 134.2 kHz, memory capacity of 64 bits, reading distance up
   to 60 cm and average reading time of 70 ms.
   The electronic devices were initialized with the ID numbers generated by
   the National Data Base and the same numbers were printed on the eartags.
   The TIPs were applied to 6 adults and 35 animals born at the farm,
   ranging from 1 to 9 months of age, in the armpit, between the chest wall
   and the caudal muscles of the right arm. The permanence of the microchip
   was verified after 15 days, 6 months and 1 year from the application, by
   using a handheld reader.
   The recovery of the TIP at the slaughterhouse wasn't investigated
   because the animals were not intended to be slaughtered.
   Results and discussion -The experience confirmed that the injection in
   the armpit is easy to perform for the operator and doesn't appear to be
   painful for the animal. All animals needed a minimum containment and
   didn't react to the inoculation, the absence of wool and the low
   thickness of the skin facilitated the injection. After 15 days the TIP
   proved to be palpable in situ and readable in all subjects, there
   weren't any signs of inflammation or scarring reactions. After 6 and 12
   months no accidental breakage of the TIPs occurred and all TIPs were
   easily detected by the reader in the armpit. During the project two
   animals died, respectively at 12 and 17 months from the application of
   the TIP, which was found still in situ at the necropsy in both of them.
   Conclusion - The application of a TIP of 23 mm in the armpit fully met
   the requirements for the electronic identifiers, such as ease of use,
   non-invasiveness and safety, good readability, durability, absence of
   breakage or loss and permanence in situ. TIP may constitute the main
   identification device for dwarf goats and sheep, usually farmed as
   companion animals.}},

Abstract = {{A wide range of arthropod-borne viruses threaten both human and animal
   health either through their presence in Europe or through risk of
   introduction. Prominent among these is West Nile virus (WNV), primarily
   an avian virus, which has caused multiple outbreaks associated with
   human and equine mortality. Endemic outbreaks of West Nile fever have
   been reported in Italy, Greece, France, Romania, Hungary, Russia and
   Spain, with further spread expected. Most outbreaks in Western Europe
   have been due to infection with WNV Lineage 1. In Eastern Europe WNV
   Lineage 2 has been responsible for human and bird mortality,
   particularly in Greece, which has experienced extensive outbreaks over
   three consecutive years. Italy has experienced co-circulation with both
   virus lineages. The ability to manage this threat in a cost-effective
   way is dependent on early detection. Targeted surveillance for pathogens
   within mosquito populations offers the ability to detect viruses prior
   to their emergence in livestock, equine species or human populations. In
   addition, it can establish a baseline of mosquito-borne virus activity
   and allow monitoring of change to this over time. Early detection offers
   the opportunity to raise disease awareness, initiate vector control and
   preventative vaccination, now available for horses, and encourage
   personal protection against mosquito bites. This would have major
   benefits through financial savings and reduction in equid
   morbidity/mortality. However, effective surveillance that predicts virus
   outbreaks is challenged by a range of factors including limited
   resources, variation in mosquito capture rates (too few or too many),
   difficulties in mosquito identification, often reliant on specialist
   entomologists, and the sensitive, rapid detection of viruses in mosquito
   pools. Surveillance for WNV and other arboviruses within mosquito
   populations varies between European countries in the extent and focus of
   the surveillance. This study reviews the current status of WNV in
   mosquito populations across Europe and how this is informing our
   understanding of virus epidemiology. Key findings such as detection of
   virus, presence of vector species and invasive mosquito species are
   summarized, and some of the difficulties encountered when applying a
   cost-effective surveillance programme are highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{Effective food safety interventions implemented in schools should be an
   important way to reach children and to improve their knowledge and

   few intervention programs of this kind have been implemented with young

   habits and offering them simplified knowledge based on experience might
   be effective, health intervention programs and evaluation methods must
   be adapted to the peculiarity of childhood learning abilities.
   This study provides an example of a health promotion campaign addressed
   at primary school students, with the aim of improving children's
   knowledge, correcting habits in the context of food safety, and
   enhancing the children's understanding of microorganisms and their
   functions. Children attending a program based on (1) mostly theoretical
   knowledge or (2) mostly practical information (with the scientific

   effective than theory classes. Data also show that children's drawings
   could be used to simplify and consolidate the deep learning of
   scientific topics, and also to evaluate the successfulness of health
   promotion campaigns targeting young children. This should contribute to
   the amelioration of children's awareness of hygiene and food

Abstract = {{Preparedness for bioterrorism is based on communication between people
   in organizations who are educated and trained in several disciplines,
   including law enforcement, health, and science. Various backgrounds,
   cultures, and vocabularies generate difficulties in understanding and
   interpretating terms and concepts, which may impair communication. This
   is especially true in emergency situations, in which the need for
   clarity and consistency is vital. The EU project AniBio-Threat initiated
   methods and made a rough estimate of the terms and concepts that are
   crucial for an incident, and a pilot database with key terms and
   definitions has been constructed. Analysis of collected terms and
   sources has shown that many of the participating organizations use
   various international standards in their area of expertise. The same
   term often represents different concepts in the standards from different
   sectors, or, alternatively, different terms were used to represent the
   same or similar concepts. The use of conflicting terminology can be
   problematic for decision makers and communicators in planning and
   prevention or when handling an incident. Since the CBRN area has roots
   in multiple disciplines, each with its own evolving terminology, it may
   not be realistic to achieve unequivocal communication through a
   standardized vocabulary and joint definitions for words from common
   language. We suggest that a communication strategy should include
   awareness of alternative definitions and ontologies and the ability to
   talk and write without relying on the implicit knowledge underlying
   specialized jargon. Consequently, cross-disciplinary communication
   skills should be part of training of personnel in the CBRN field. In
   addition, a searchable repository of terms and definitions from relevant
   organizations and authorities would be a valuable addition to existing
   glossaries for improving awareness concerning bioterrorism prevention
   planning.}},

Abstract = {{Botulism is a neuroparalytic disease that can occur in all warm-blooded
   animals, birds, and fishes. The disease in animals is mainly caused by
   toxins produced by Clostridium botulinum strains belonging to group III,
   although outbreaks due to toxins produced by group I and II organisms
   have been recognized. Group III strains are capable of producing
   botulinum toxins of type C, D, and C/D and D/C mosaic variants.
   Definitive diagnosis of animal botulism is made by combining clinical
   findings with laboratory investigations. Detection of toxins in clinical
   specimens and feed is the gold standard for laboratory diagnosis. Since
   toxins may be degraded by organisms contained in the gastrointestinal
   tract or may be present at levels below the detection limit, the
   recovery of C. botulinum from sick animal specimens is consistent for
   laboratory confirmation. In this article we report the development and
   in-house validation of a new multiplex real-time PCR for detecting and
   typing the neurotoxin genes found in C. botulinum group III organisms.
   Validation procedures have been carried out according to ISO 16140,
   using strains and samples recovered from cases of animal botulism in
   Italy and France.}},

Abstract = {{Botulism is a severe neuroparalytic disease that affects humans, all
   warm-blooded animals, and some fishes. The disease is caused by exposure
   to toxins produced by Clostridium botulinum and other botulinum
   toxin-producing clostridia. Botulism in animals represents a severe
   environmental and economic concern because of its high mortality rate.
   Moreover, meat or other products from affected animals entering the food
   chain may result in a public health problem. To this end, early
   diagnosis is crucial to define and apply appropriate veterinary public
   health measures. Clinical diagnosis is based on clinical findings
   eliminating other causes of neuromuscular disorders and on the absence
   of internal lesions observed during postmortem examination. Since
   clinical signs alone are often insufficient to make a definitive
   diagnosis, laboratory confirmation is required. Botulinum antitoxin
   administration and supportive therapies are used to treat sick animals.
   Once the diagnosis has been made, euthanasia is frequently advisable.
   Vaccine administration is subject to health authorities' permission, and
   it is restricted to a small number of animal species. Several measures
   can be adopted to prevent or minimize outbreaks. In this article we
   outline all phases of management of animal botulism outbreaks occurring
   in wet wild birds, poultry, cattle, horses, and fur farm animals.}},

Abstract = {{A workshop on animal botulism was held in Uppsala, Sweden, in June 2012.
   Its purpose was to explore the current status of the disease in Europe
   by gathering the European experts in animal botulism and to raise
   awareness of the disease among veterinarians and others involved in
   biopreparedness. Animal botulism is underreported and under-diagnosed,
   but an increasing number of reports, as well as the information gathered
   from this workshop, show that it is an emerging problem in Europe. The
   workshop was divided into 4 sessions: animal botulism in Europe, the
   bacteria behind the disease, detection and diagnostics, and European
   collaboration and surveillance. An electronic survey was conducted
   before the workshop to identify the 3 most needed discussion points,
   which were: prevention, preparedness and outbreak response; detection
   and diagnostics; and European collaboration and surveillance. The main
   conclusions drawn from these discussions were that there is an urgent
   need to replace the mouse bioassay for botulinum toxin detection with an
   in vitro test and that there is a need for a European network to
   function as a reference laboratory, which could also organize a European
   supply of botulinum antitoxin and vaccines. The foundation of such a
   network was discussed, and the proposals are presented here along with
   the outcome of discussions and a summary of the workshop itself.}},

Abstract = {{Influenza A is a highly contagious respiratory virus in constant
   evolution and represents a threat to both veterinary and human public
   health. IA viruses (IAVs) originate in avian reservoirs but may adapt to
   humans, either directly or through the spillover to another mammalian
   species, to the point of becoming pandemic. IAVs must successfully be
   able to (i) transmit from animal to human, (ii) interact with host
   cells, and (iii) transmit from human to human. The mechanisms by which
   viruses evolve, cause zoonotic infections, and adapt to a new host
   species are indeed complex and appear to be a heterogeneous collection
   of viral evolutionary events rather than a single phenomenon. Progress
   has been made in identifying some of the genetic markers mainly
   associated with virulence and transmission; this achievement has
   improved our knowledge of how to manage a pandemic event and of how to
   identify IAVs with pandemic potential. Early evidence of emerging
   viruses and surveillance of animal IAVs is made possible only by
   strengthening the collaboration between the public and veterinary health
   sectors.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{It is acknowledged that data from field studies on tick ecology might be
   biased by collection methods, but actually comparative studies are still
   limited. Herein we assessed whether the efficiency of flagging and
   dragging varies according to tick developmental stage, species, season
   and habitat. Ticks were collected in three sites bordered by an oak
   forest. The abundance of ticks collected by each collection method
   varied according to tick species, developmental stage, season, and
   habitat. Flagging was in general more efficient in collecting adult
   ticks, especially in spring and winter. Females were more frequently
   collected by flagging in the meadow and grassland habitats and males in
   the man-made trail. Flagging collected significantly more adults of
   Dermacentor marginatus, Hyalomma marginatum, Haemaphysalis inermis and
   Ixodes ricinus. Flagging was more efficient in collecting D. marginatus
   and I. ricinus in spring, and H. inermis and I. ricinus females in both
   spring and winter. In summer and autumn tick abundances were generally
   similar, with the exception of D. marginatus female in autumn. Flagging
   was more efficient in collecting D. marginatus adults in the meadow
   habitat and in the man-made trail, and I. ricinus adults in the meadow
   and grassland habitats. Dragging was more efficient in grassland for R.
   turanicus. Our results suggest that variations in terms of collection
   method performance are associated to factors linked to tick behaviour,
   habitat characteristics, and climate. Field studies employing these
   collection methods should take this into account to avoid misleading
   conclusions about tick population dynamics and tick-borne pathogen
   transmission risk.}},

Abstract = {{Botulism disease in both humans and animals is a worldwide concern.
   Botulinum neurotoxins produced by Clostridium botulinum and other
   Clostridium species are the most potent biological substances known and
   are responsible for flaccid paralysis leading to a high mortality rate.
   Clostridium botulinum and botulinum neurotoxins are considered potential
   weapons for bioterrorism and have been included in the Australia Group
   List of Biological Agents. In 2010 the European Commission (DG Justice,
   Freedom and Security) funded a 3-year project named AniBioThreat to
   improve the EU's capacity to counter animal bioterrorism threats. A
   detection portfolio with screening methods for botulism agents and
   incidents was needed to improve tracking and tracing of accidental and
   deliberate contamination of the feed and food chain with botulinum
   neurotoxins and other Clostridia. The complexity of this threat required
   acquiring new genetic information to better understand the diversity of
   these Clostridia and develop detection methods targeting both highly
   specific genetic markers of these Clostridia and the neurotoxins they
   are able to produce. Several European institutes participating in the
   AniBioThreat project collaborated on this program to achieve these
   objectives. Their scientific developments are discussed here.}},

Abstract = {{Following the first case of Schmallenberg (SBV) in northern Italy in
   February 2012, virus detection was conducted on midges collected during
   the national entomological surveillance program for bluetongue (BT). Six
   cattle farms, within a radius of 50 km from the SBV case, were selected
   for a 12 month study, aiming to determine when the virus entered the
   area, if it was capable of overwintering, and the possible role played
   by each species of the Obsoletus complex in disseminating the infection.
   A total of 33,724 Culicoides were collected at the six sites between
   June 2011 and June 2012. Species belonging to the Obsoletus Complex were
   the most abundant (94.44\%) and, within the complex, Culicoides
   obsoletus was the most prevalent species in the studying area (65.4\%).
   Nearly 7000 Culicoides midges were screened, either in pools or
   individually, for SBV by real-time RT-PCR. Viral genome was detected in
   six pools of the Obsoletus complex, collected at three sites between
   September and November 2011, and in a single parous female of C
   obsoletus, collected in May 2012.
   As a result of the BT surveillance program in Italy it was possible to
   demonstrate, retrospectively, that SBV has circulated in at least three
   Italian provinces since early September 2011, nearly 5 months prior and
   as far as 40 km away from the first detected case. Similarly, the survey
   confirmed the presence of SBV in the vector population 3 months after
   the outbreak, following a cold winter during which the blacklight traps
   failed to catch active adult midges. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Previous studies have reported the detection of H5N1 HPAI virus in
   feathers from ducks naturally and experimentally infected and suggested
   that feather calami (FC) could be used as diagnostic samples for the
   early detection of H5N1 HPAI infections. Ducks are readily infected with
   H5N1 HPAI viruses although the development of clinical signs and deaths
   were reported as age-related with younger birds being more susceptible.
   The correlation between age and virus localisation in FC of infected
   ducks has not been studied to date.
   In the present study juvenile (4-week-old) and adult (24-week-old) Pekin
   ducks (Anas platyrhynchos var. domestica) were infected experimentally
   with a clade 2.2 H5N1 HPAI virus (A/duck/Nigeria/1071-23/2007). Tracheal
   (Tr) and cloacal (Cl) swabs and FC were collected at 3, 5, 7 and 10 days
   post infection and tested by RRT-PCR and a double antibody
   sandwich-ELISA (DAS-ELISA) developed in house.
   Virus was detected in swabs and FC of challenged ducks with a higher
   rate of detection in juvenile ducks. In this age group virus was
   detected over a longer period of time in FC compared to swabs.
   Our study showed that FC samples collected from young ducks are a valid
   diagnostic specimen for H5N1 HPAI virus detection. The DAS-ELISA on FC
   proved to be a suitable alternative diagnostic test when molecular
   and/or virus isolation techniques are not available therefore it could
   be useful in the diagnosis of H5N1 HPAI infections in under-resourced
   countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Efficacy of an imidacloprid/flumethrin collar against fleas, ticks and
   tick-borne pathogens in dogs}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Tick-borne diseases comprise a group of maladies that are of
   substantial medical and veterinary significance. A range of tick-borne
   pathogens, including diverse species of bacteria and protozoa, can
   infect both dogs and humans. Hence, the control of tick infestations is
   pivotal to decrease or prevent tick-borne pathogen transmission.
   Therefore, different commercial products with insecticidal, repellent or
   both properties have been developed for use on dogs. Recently, a collar
   containing a combination of imidacloprid 10\% and flumethrin 4.5\% has
   proven effective to prevent tick and flea infestations in dogs under
   field conditions and the infection by some vector-borne pathogens they
   transmit under laboratory-controlled conditions.
   Methods: From March 2011 to April 2012, a field study was conducted in a
   private shelter in southern Italy to assess the efficacy of the
   imidacloprid/flumethrin collar against tick and flea infestations and to
   determine if this strategy would decrease tick-borne pathogen
   transmission in young dogs. A total of 122 animals were enrolled in the
   study and randomly assigned to group A (n = 64; collared) or group B (n
   = 58; untreated controls). Dogs were examined monthly for ticks and
   fleas and systematically tested for selected tick-borne pathogens.
   Results: Compared to controls, the collar provided overall efficacies of
   99.7\% and 100\% against tick and flea infestation, respectively. The
   overall efficacy for the prevention of tick-borne pathogens (i.e.,
   Anaplasma platys and Babesia vogeli) was 91.6\%.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the imidacloprid/flumethrin
   collar is efficacious against flea and tick infestation as well as
   tick-borne pathogen transmission to dogs under field conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Twenty-four Salmonella enterica isolates (13 serovar Enteritidis and 11
   Typhimurium) isolated from 5,600 samples from intensive laying hen farms
   in Italy in 1998-2007 were characterized for antimicrobial resistance
   genes, pulsotype and phage type. Most of S. Typhimurium strains were
   pulsotype STYMXB. 0147 (81.8\%), phage type DT143 and resistant to
   sulfamethoxazole encoded by sul2. Two multidrug resistant (MDR) strains
   were identified. One strain, STYMXB. 0061, was resistant to ampicillin
   (A), chloramphenicol (C), streptomycin (S), sulfamethoxazole (Su) and
   tetracycline (T) encoded by the Salmonella Genomic Island SGI1. The
   second MDR strain, STYMXB. 0110, was resistant to SSuT encoded by sul1
   and sul2, aadA1 and tet(C)-flanked by an IS26 element, respectively. The
   tet(C) gene has been reported to confer low levels of resistance and it
   has very rarely been detected in S. Typhimurium from poultry. In the
   current study, the MIC value (32 mu g/mL) was consistent with the
   breakpoint (>= 16 mu g/mL) reported for Enterobacteriaceae. Most of the
   S. Enteritidis strains were resistant to Su (encoded by sul2). One MDR
   strain (ANxSSuT) was identified. With the exception of nalidixic acid
   (Nx), the resistances were respectively encoded by bla(TEM), strAB, sul2
   and tet(A) harbored by an IncN conjugative plasmid. All isolates were
   pulsotype SENTXB.0001 with PT14b being the most prevalent identified
   phage type (57.1\%). In Europe, SENTXB. 0001 is the predominant PFGE
   profile from clinical cases and the identification of PT14b has steadily
   been on the increase since 2001. The findings presented in this study
   highlight the potential spread of S. Enteritidis phage types PT14b and
   S. Typhimurium DT143 in a field of particular relevance for zoonoses.
   Additional, the presence of resistance genes and genetic elements
   (conjugative plasmid and IS element) underlines the need to assess
   routinely studies in field, such as poultry farms, relevant fot the
   public health and suitable for the storage and diffusion of
   antimicrobial resistance.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to investigate the expression of heat
   shock protein 70 (HSP70) by Western blot (WB) in swine liver.
   Subsequently, the study aimed to apply this method to two experimental
   groups of heavy pigs raised in different confinement systems:
   intensive/indoor (Group A) and extensive/outdoor (Group B). Thirty-six
   crossbred commercial heavy pigs were divided as follows: Group A (eight
   castrated males and eight females) was equally distributed into two
   single-sex indoor pens (1.02m(2)/pig); Group B (11 castrated males and
   nine females) was kept in one single (partially grassy and partially
   wooded) open area of about 6000m(2). Group A was slaughtered at 41 weeks
   of age (170 +/- 9 kg) and Group B at 48 weeks of age (172 +/- 13 kg). At
   the abattoir the livers of all the animals were collected and analyzed
   by WB assay in order to quantify the levels of HSP70. Moreover, a
   further liver sample was taken from the same animals in order to
   investigate the cellular localization of HSP70 by immunohistochemistry
   (IHC). The interaction between sex and group resulted statistically
   significant (P = 0.001). When stratified by sex, Group A showed
   significantly higher HSP70 values compared with Group B for both male
   and female subjects (P < 0.001). Stratifying by group, males showed
   significantly higher HSP70 values than females in Group A (P < 0.001),
   whereas no statistical differences were observed between sexes for Group
   B (P = 0.653). The IHC results evidenced cytoplasmic immunoreactivity in
   a granular pattern in both groups. The different expression pattern
   observed by WB could prove to be a useful tool in the assessment of pig
   health and welfare.}},

Abstract = {{Since 2008, West Nile Virus (WNV) has expanded its range in several
   Italian regions, and its yearly recurrence suggests the virus may have
   become endemic in some areas. In 2011, a new plan based also on the
   detection of IgM antibodies was implemented in the north-eastern Italian
   regions of Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia, aiming to early detect WNV
   infections in areas where the virus had already circulated during the
   previous summers, and in adjacent zones. From July to November 2011,
   1880 sera from 521 equine premises were screened by a commercial IgM
   capture ELISA. Mosquitoes were captured by CDC-CO2 traps at 61 locations
   in the two regions. Collected mosquitoes were identified, pooled by
   species/date/location and examined by real-time RT-PCR and sequencing.
   Passive surveillance was carried out on clinically affected horses and
   non-migratory wild birds found dead. IgM sero-positive equines were
   detected in 19 holdings, five in the area with WNV circulation (AWC) and
   14 in the surveillance area (SA); 10 more horse premises tested positive
   to further serological controls within 4km of the positive holdings. A
   total of 85398 mosquitoes of 15 species were collected and 2732 pools
   examined. Five Culex pipiens pools tested positive for the presence of
   WNV. Passive surveillance on non-migratory wild birds allowed detection
   of the virus only in one found dead collared dove (Streptopelia
   decaocto), of 82 birds sampled. The WNV belonged to the lineage 2, which
   had been isolated for the first time in Italy earlier in 2011. By the
   first week of October, nine human cases had been confirmed in the same
   area. The implementation of a protocol combining IgM screening of horses
   with surveillance on mosquito vectors proved to be valuable for early
   detecting WNV circulation.}},

Abstract = {{A pilot study was implemented in the Veneto Region of Italy, aimed at

   unpasteurised on the basis of their risk of faecal contamination of
   milk, which is directly correlated to the probability of a foodborne
   pathogen, if present in the herd and eliminated through faecal
   excretion, to contaminate the raw product. Factors considered to be
   relevant in the definition of the risk of pathogens potentially present
   in animal faeces to be transmitted to milk, were hierarchically
   structured, weighted through the application of experts elicitation
   methods (Analytic Hierarchy Process, Delphi) and used to categorise
   farms through the application of a herd questionnaire. The probability
   of faecal contamination of milk, and thus the risk of pathogens transfer
   appears to be modulated more by farm management than by the structure of
   the farm or the health status of the herd. Such a method, combined with
   the microbiological evaluation of the prevalence of faecal excretion of
   such pathogens, can be used to implement a risk-based surveillance
   programme and to apply targeted control measures. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

   avian-to-human transmissions of H5, H7 and H9 virus subtypes have
   occurred, and the first influenza pandemic of the new millennium

   Although the mechanisms that allow influenza viruses to jump from one
   host species to another are not fully understood, several genetic
   signatures linked to the crossing of species barriers have been
   identified. This has led to a re-evaluation of the importance of
   understanding these viruses in the animal reservoir, to the extent that
   millions of euros have been invested in surveillance, research and
   capacity building worldwide. This has resulted in an enhanced
   collaboration with our medical counterparts, leading to many discoveries

   lead to the emergence of a pandemic virus. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Avian influenza viruses of the H9N2 subtype have circulated in the
   poultry population in Asia, Far and Middle East since the mid-1990s. One
   of the most widespread lineages established in poultry is the G1
   lineage. This lineage has undergone further evolution and reassortment
   since its first detection in 1997 and G1-like H9N2 viruses still
   circulate. In this study we have investigated the susceptibility of
   quail and turkeys to the H9N2 G1-lineage prototype strain (A/quail/Hong
   Kong/G1/97). Contact transmission experiments were carried out in both
   avian species. Animals were infected oro-nasally with increasing doses
   of the virus (10(3)-10(6) EID50/0.1 ml) and sentinel birds were
   introduced 4 days post infection (pi) in each experimental group. Quail
   were more susceptible than turkeys, as they were readily infected with
   lower challenge doses. Interestingly, infection of turkeys was
   associated with worse clinical condition. Transmission was detected in
   both species. Quail infected with a dose less than or equal to 10(4)
   EID50 transmitted the virus to the sentinels without showing any signs
   of disease. These findings reinforce the hypothesis that quail may
   ensure the perpetuation of H9N2 viruses in poultry, acting as a silent

Abstract = {{West Nile Virus lineage 1 (WNV lin1) emerged in North-Eastern Italy in
   2008 and, since then, it has been detected in animals, humans and

   strain of WNV was found in birds and vectors. On August the 21st, during
   the 2012 WNV entomological surveillance plan, a WNV lin2 strain was
   detected by RT-PCR in a pool of Culex pipiens mosquitoes captured in
   Veneto region. According to the alignment of the partial sequences of
   the NS5 and NS3 genes, no differences between this Italian lineage 2
   strain and the Nea Santa-Greece-2010 WNV isolate (Gr-10) were observed.
   Similarly to the Gr-10 strain, the putative NS3 aminoacid sequences of
   the Italian strain showed proline in position 249 instead of histidine
   (H249P). Although proline in position 249 has been suggested to increase
   the virulence of WNV strains, neither human nor veterinary cases
   associated to this strain have been reported in the region. A prompt
   mosquito disinfestation was organized to avoid the spread of this
   potential threatening virus. The simultaneous circulation of both WNV
   lineage 1 and 2 confirms North-Eastern Italy as a high risk area for WNV
   emergence and highlights the need for a continuous surveillance.}},

Abstract = {{West Nile virus (WNV) is one of the most serious public health threats
   that Europe and the Mediterranean countries are currently facing. In
   Italy, WNV emerged in 1998 and has been circulating since 2008. To
   tackle its continuous incursions, Italian national and regional
   institutions set up a surveillance program, which includes the
   serological screening of sentinel horses, sentinel-chickens and backyard
   poultry flocks and the surveillance on all equine neurological cases,
   resident captured and wild dead birds, and vectors. This communication
   aims to assess the importance of the entomological surveillance program
   as an early warning system for WNV circulation. In the province of
   Modena, the circulation of WNV lineage 2 strains was first detected in
   pools of Culex pipiens on July the 3rd, 42 days prior to the onset of
   the first 2013 human WNV neuroinvasive case reported in the same
   province. Similarly in Veneto, WNV was first detected on July 3rd in a
   pool of Cx. pipiens collected in the province of Venezia. The first
   human neuroinvasive case in this region occurred in the Rovigo province
   on July the 24th, seven days after the detection of WNV lineage 2 in a
   mosquito pool collected in the same province. Up to the end of July
   2013, WNV circulation was further detected in several other pools of Cx.
   pipiens mosquitoes collected in Emilia-Romagna, Veneto and Lombardia.
   According to the NS3 partial sequence alignments including all recent
   European and Italian Lineage 2 strains, the new circulating WNV lineage
   2 strains share high nt homology with the Hungarian and with the
   previous lineage 2 strains isolated in Veneto and Sardegna in 2011 and
   2012. These data provide a clear and practical demonstration of the
   relevance of a reliable entomological surveillance program to early
   detect WNV in Italy.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated classical scrapie susceptibility in four native
   Italian sheep breeds (Lamon, Brogna, Alpagota, Foza) through PrP
   genotyping. The investigation revealed that the majority of animals
   overall showed moderate to high susceptibility to classical scrapie. The
   Lamon and Brogna breeds exhibited the highest frequency of the highly
   susceptible VRQ allele (38.1\% and 19.3\%, respectively), while the
   Alpagota and Foza had a high frequency of the ARQ allele (85\% and 64\%,
   respectively), also considered to confer susceptibility. The Foza breed
   showed a significantly high frequency (P < 0.01) of the rare ARK allele
   (9.7\%); a similar frequency has never been described before in the
   literature. This study stresses the importance of genotyping native
   sheep breeds both to better organize conservation schemes and to assess
   the risk of contracting classical scrapie. Additionally, the
   investigated native breeds revealed some characteristics that could be
   interesting for research purposes. These sheep could in fact be used to
   investigate the susceptibility of the ARK allele to classical scrapie,
   but also to determine whether its relatively high frequency is
   indicative that the origin of the Foza breed differs from the other
   Venetian sheep breeds. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fox rabies re-emerged in north-eastern Italy at the end of 2008 and
   circulated until early 2011. As with previous rabies epidemics, the
   Italian cases were linked to the epidemiological situation in adjacent
   regions. To obtain a comprehensive picture of the dynamics of the recent
   Italian epidemic, we performed a detailed evolutionary analysis of RABVs
   circulating in north-eastern Italy. Sequences were obtained for the
   hyper-variable region of the nucleoprotein gene, the complete
   glycoprotein gene, and the intergenic region G-L from 113 selected fox
   rabies cases. We identified two viral genetic groups, here referred to
   as Italy-1 and Italy-2. Phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses
   revealed that both groups had been circulating in the Western Balkans
   and Slovenia in previous years and were only later introduced into Italy
   (into the Friuli Venezia Giulia region-FVG), occupying different areas
   of the Italian territories. Notably, viruses belonging to the Italy-1
   group remained confined to the region of introduction and their spread
   was minimised by the implementation of oral fox vaccination campaigns.
   In contrast, Italy-2 viruses spread westward over a territory of 100 km
   from their first identification in FVG, likely crossing the northern
   territories where surveillance was inadequate. A genetic sub-group
   (Italy-2A), characterised by a unique amino acid mutation (D106A) in the
   N gene, was also observed to occupy a distinct geographic cluster. This
   molecular epidemiological analysis of the 2008-2011 fox rabies epidemic
   will contribute to future control programmes both at national and
   regional levels. In particular, our findings highlight the weaknesses of
   the national surveillance strategy in the period preceding rabies
   re-emergence, and of control plans implemented immediately after rabies
   notification, and underline the need of a coordinated approach at the
   regional level for both the surveillance and control of wildlife rabies.

Abstract = {{The in vitro activity of enrofloxacin against 73 Mycoplasma synoviae
   field strains isolated in Israel and Europe was determined by broth
   microdilution. Decreased susceptibility to enrofloxacin was identified

   field isolates (2009 to 2011) of M. synoviae have MICs of >= 2 mu g/ml
   to enrofloxacin. Comparison of the quinolone resistance-determining
   regions (QRDRs) in M. synoviae isolates revealed a clear correlation
   between the presence of one of the amino acid substitutions Asp79-Asn,
   Thr80-Ala/Ile, Ser81-Pro, and Asp84-Asn/Tyr/His of the ParC QRDR and
   decreased susceptibility to enrofloxacin (MIC, >= 1 mu g/ml). Amino acid
   substitutions at positions GyrA 87, GyrB 401/402, and ParE 420/454 were

   susceptibility to enrofloxacin. Comparison of vlhA molecular profiles
   revealed the presence of 9 different genotypes in the Israeli M.
   synoviae field isolates and 10 genotypes in the European isolates; only
   one vlhA genotype (type 4) was identified in both cohorts. Based on

Abstract = {{Twelve National Reference Laboratories (NRLs) for rabies have undertaken
   a comparative assay to assess the comparison of fluorescent antibody
   test (FAT) results using five coded commercial anti-rabies conjugates
   (Biorad, Bioveta, Fujirebio, Millipore, and SIFIN conjugates).
   Homogenized positive brain tissues infected with various lyssavirus
   species as well as negative samples were analyzed blindly using a
   standardized FAT procedure. Conjugates B, C, D, and E were found to be
   significantly more effective than conjugate A for GS7 (French RABV)
   diluted samples (1/8 and 1/100) while the frequency of concordant
   results of conjugates C and D differ significantly from conjugates A, B
   and E for CVS 27. For detection of EBLV-1 strains, conjugates C and D
   also presented a significantly lower frequency of discordant results
   compared to conjugates A, B and E. Conjugates B, C and D were found to
   be significantly more effective than conjugates E and A for EBLV-2 and
   ABLV samples. In view of these results, conjugates C and D set
   themselves apart from the others and appeared as the most effective of
   this 5-panel conjugates. This study clearly demonstrates that the
   variability of conjugates used by National Reference Laboratories can
   potentially lead to discordant results and influence assay sensitivity.
   In case of false negative results this could have a dramatic impact if
   the animal under investigation is responsible for human exposure. To
   avoid such situations, confirmatory tests should be implemented. Crown

Abstract = {{Following the first report of Schmallenberg virus (SBV) in the brain of
   a dystocic goat foetus in 2012 in Northern Italy, immediate response
   actions were adopted to avoid the virus circulation. The brain tested
   positive by 2 different one-step real-time RT-PCR protocols; these
   results were also confirmed by partial sequencing of the viral genome.
   At that time this was the first detection of the new Orthobunyavirus
   genus within the Bunyaviridae family in Italy. An epidemiological
   investigation in the involved farm was carried out in collaboration with
   the CESME - National Reference Centre for the study and verification of
   Foreign Animal Diseases (Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale
   dell'Abruzzo e del Molise `G. Caporale', Italy). Epidemiological
   information on the flock was provided and analysed, whole blood and
   serum samples were also collected from all animals in the farm for both
   virological and serological investigations. All blood samples tested
   negative for SBV, whereas serological positive results were obtained by
   virus-neutralization (VN). Epidemiological investigations indicated the
   possible virus circulation in the area. The subsequent surveillance
   actions were mainly based on the standardization and re-enforcement of
   passive surveillance protocols, a risk-based serological surveillance
   programme through VN and an entomological surveillance programme in the
   involved geographical areas were also put in place. Eventually SBV local
   circulation was confirmed by real time RT-PCR in 6 Culicoides pools,
   collected between September and November 2011 in 3 farms in the
   surroundings of the area of SBV outbreak.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction - Since June 2010, an amazing high number of mozzarella
   cheese, produced in Italian and German plants, caused complaints in
   Italian consumers due to their unusual blue colour. The samples resulted
   positive for Pseudomonas fluorescens, psychrotrophic microorganisms,
   classified as ubiquitous in nature, isolated from soil, water, and
   vegetation. These species are particularly worrying for dairy industry
   as they could enter in processed dairy products through
   postpasteurization contamination in the milk processing plant; moreover
   the temperature of transport and distribution are considered permissive
   for the growth of these organisms.
   Aim - The aim of this study was the molecular characterization of P.
   fluorescens isolates with two different molecular techniques, in order
   to evaluate the genetic correlation between isolates and eventually the
   contamination source.
   Material and methods - 94 isolates of P. fluorescens, deriving from food
   microbiological laboratories of Italian network of Istituti
   Zooprofilattici Sperimentali, were collected between June 2010 and July
   2011. The two molecular techniques analyze different portion of DNA:
   PFGE restriction endonuclease digestion was conducted on the whole
   genome of isolates with a rare-cutting enzymes SpeI, whereas automated
   riboprinting was conducted with two enzymes, EcoRI and PvuII on locus
   coding for rRNA operons.
   Results and discussion - PFGE analysis gave 44 different pulsotypes,
   while riboprinting with EcoRI gave 6 different ribogroups; the second
   restriction, operated with PvuII, gave other 7 ribogroups. All the
   restriction profiles were analysed with BioNumerics software, resulting
   in three different phylogenetic trees. Applying appropriate criteria of
   analysis, it was possible to evidence two different cluster of isolates,
   one including Italian isolates and the other including German ones.
   Conclusions - Our results demonstrate that the ``blue-mozzarella{''}
   event was not correlated to an unusual spread of one P. fluorescens
   strain diffusion, underlining the high genetic variability of 94 P.
   fluorescens isolates, pointed out with both molecular methods.}},

Abstract = {{In many parts of the world, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are
   the predominant cause of intramammary infections (IMI) in dairy cows and
   in water buffaloes, as well. A longitudinal field study was carried out
   on one well-managed dairy water buffalo herd to determine the prevalence
   and distribution of CNS and a recently described CNS-species,
   Staphylococcus rostri, in milk samples to explore its relevance for
   buffaloes' udder health throughout lactation, and to gain insight into
   the susceptibility of the latter species toward commonly used
   antimicrobials. Twice weekly quarter milk samples from a cohort of 11
   lactating water buffaloes were collected over an 8-mo period. The CNS (n
   = 109; 76.2\% of all culture-positive samples) were the predominant
   pathogens causing IMI, followed by Corynebacterium bovis (n = 11; 7.6\%)
   and Streptococcus spp. (n = 9; 6.2\%) other than Stretococcus uberis (n
   = 2; 1.4\%). Thirty-seven hemolytic staphylococci suspected to be
   Staphylococcus aureus were further differentiated using transfer
   DNA-intergenic spacer-PCR and rpoB-gene sequencing because they were
   coagulase-negative. Thirty-three of those isolates were identified as
   Staph. rostri, whereas 2 others were identified as Staphylococcus
   epidermidis. None of the Staph. rostri isolates displayed resistance to
   the antimicrobial agents tested. Mean quarter milk somatic cell count
   (qSCC) of all samples collected throughout lactation was 20,970
   cells/mL. The qSCC at sampling of quarters infected with Staph. rostri
   (34,466 cells/mL) and CNS other than Staph. rostri (34,813 cells/mL)
   were significantly higher than the qSCC of noninfected quarters (20,287
   cells/mL), yet not significantly different from each other. These
   findings provide novel insight into the prevalence and distribution,
   antimicrobial susceptibility, and relevance of Staph. rostri compared
   with other CNS species causing IMI in water buffaloes. Further studies
   are needed to pinpoint the relevance, niches, and transmission routes of
   Staph. rostri, as well as other CNS in water buffaloes.}},

Abstract = {{In 2005-2008, 1152 samples (451 faecal samples, 451 carcass swabs and
   250 tonsils) were collected from 451 finishing pigs slaughtered in three
   abattoirs of northern Italy. In two abattoirs, 34 scalding water samples
   were collected. The aim of this study was to investigate the faecal and
   palatine tonsil carriage rate of Salmonella enterica and Yersinia
   enterocolitica in pigs at slaughter and the degree of carcass
   contamination by these bacteria Typing of the isolates, virulence
   characterization and antimicrobial testing were also performed.
   S. enterica was isolated from 21.5\% of the faecal samples, 10.9\% of
   the carcasses and 10.4\% of the tonsils, but not from scalding water.
   Nineteen different serovars were identified among 172 S. enterica
   isolates. The prevalent serovars were Derby (41.3\%), Rissen (12.2\%),
   Typhimurium (11\%), 4,{[}5],12:i:-(8.7\%) and Give (4.1\%). S. enterica
   ser. Typhimurium and S. enterica ser. 4,{[}5],12:i:-isolates were
   phage-typed and PT DT120 was the most common (23.5\%). Y. enterocolitica
   was detected in 17.1\% of the faecal samples, 2.4\% of the carcasses,
   10.8\% of the tonsils and 11.8\% of the scalding water samples. A total
   of 119 isolates were found, four of them in water. Of the 115 Y.
   enterocolitica isolates of pig origin, 24 (20.9\%) were 4/O:3 and 4
   (3.5\%) were 2/O:9. Y. enterocolitica 4/O:3 represented 85.7\% of the
   pathogenic isolates found in all types of samples and 100\% of those
   found in tonsils. In 4/O:3 isolates the most common virulence-associated
   genes were ystA (100\%), inv (95.8\%), ail (87.5\%) and yadA (54.2\%).
   In 2/O:9 isolates the prevalent genes were ail (100\%), inv (100\%) and
   ystA (100\%), followed by ystB (25.0\%). The majority (75.7\%) of Y.
   enterocolitica isolates was biotype 1A, belonging to 13 serotypes (O:3;
   O:5; O:4,32-4,33; O:6,30-6,31; O:7,8-8; O:7,8-8-8,19; O:7,13; O:8; O:9;
   O:13; O:16-16,29; O:41,42-41,43; O:52). The most common virulence genes
   in 1A isolates were inv (95.4\%) and ystB (72.4\%).
   The antimicrobial resistance test showed that all Salmonella isolates
   were susceptible to cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, cefalothin, gentamicin
   and enrofloxacin. Resistances to tetracycline (56\%), sulphonamide
   compounds (42\%) and streptomycin (34\%) were the most common. All Y.
   enterocolitica isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime,
   cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, enrofloxacin, gentamicin, kanamicin and
   neomycin. Most isolates were resistant to cefalothin (92\%) and
   ampicillin (89\%).
   Apparently, carcass contamination by S. enterica and Y. enterocolitica
   was more likely attributable to cross-contamination than to
   self-contamination, suggesting that good hygienic measures and
   slaughtering procedures can control transmission of these pathogens to
   pork meat. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effect of induced ruminal acidosis on blood variables in heifers}},
Journal = {{BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{MAY 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: Ruminal acidosis is responsible for the onset of different
   pathologies in dairy and feedlot cattle, but there are major
   difficulties in the diagnosis. This study modelled the data obtained
   from various blood variables to identify those that could indicate the
   severity of ruminal acidosis. Six heifers were fed three experimental
   rations throughout three periods. The diets were characterised by
   different starch levels: high starch (HS), medium starch (MS) and low
   starch, as the control diet (CT). Ruminal pH values were continuously
   measured using wireless sensors and compared with pH measurements
   obtained by rumenocentesis. Blood samples were analysed for complete
   blood count, biochemical profile, venous blood gas, blood
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and LPS-binding proteins (LBP).
   Results: The regression coefficient comparing the ruminal pH values,
   obtained using the two methods, was 0.56 (P = 0.040). Feeding the CT, MS
   and HS led to differences in the time spent below the 5.8, 5.5 and 5.0
   pH thresholds and in several variables, including dry matter intake (7.7
   vs. 6.9 vs. 5.1 kg/d; P = 0.002), ruminal nadir pH (5.69 vs. 5.47 vs.
   5.44; P = 0.042), mean ruminal pH (6.50 vs. 6.34 vs. 6.31; P = 0.012),
   haemoglobin level (11.1 vs. 10.9 vs. 11.4 g/dL; P = 0.010), platelet
   count (506 vs. 481 vs. 601; P = 0.008), HCO3- (31.8 vs. 31.3 vs. 30.6
   mmol/L; P = 0.071) and LBP (5.9 vs. 9.5 vs. 10.5 mu g/mL; P < 0.001). A
   canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) was used to classify the animals
   into four ruminal pH classes (normal, risk of acidosis, subacute ruminal
   acidosis and acute ruminal acidosis) using haemoglobin, mean platelet
   volume, beta-hydroxybutyrate, glucose and reduced haemoglobin.
   Conclusions: Although additional studies are necessary to confirm the
   reliability of these discriminant functions, the use of plasma variables
   in a multifactorial model appeared to be useful for the evaluation of
   ruminal acidosis severity.}},

Abstract = {{Failure to respond to commercial limited antigen diets can occur in dogs
   kept on a dietary trial for the diagnosis of adverse food reaction
   (AFR). The aim of this study was to assess twelve canine dry limited
   antigen diets (eleven novel protein diets and one hydrolysed diet) for
   potential contamination by ingredients of animal origin not mentioned on
   the label. The validity of the two methods adopted for the detection of
   such food antigens was also evaluated. Each dietary product was analysed
   by microscopy analysis using the official method described in Commission
   Regulation EC 152/2009 with the aim of identifying bone fragments of
   different zoological classes (mammalian, avian and fish) and by
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the identification of DNA of animal
   origin. Discrepancies between the results obtained by PCR and/or
   microscopy analysis and the ingredients listed on pet food packages were
   found. Only in two pet foods did the results of both analyses match the
   ingredients listed on the label. In the remaining ten samples,
   microscopy detected bone fragments from one or two unpredicted
   zoological classes, revealing avian fragments in six of ten samples
   followed by those of fish in five of ten and mammalian fragments in four
   of ten. In two samples, microscopy analysis identified a contamination
   that would have otherwise passed unobserved if only PCR had been used.
   However, PCR confirmed the presence of all the zoological classes
   detected by microscopy and also identified the DNA of an additional
   unexpected zoological class in two samples. Dogs might fail to respond
   to commercial limited antigen diets because such diets are contaminated
   with potential allergens. Both PCR and microscopy analysis are required
   to guarantee the absence of undeclared animal sources in pet foods.
   Before ruling out AFR, a novel protein home-made diet should be
   considered if the dog is unresponsive to a commercial regimen.}},

Abstract = {{Background The serological diagnosis of avian influenza (AI) can be
   performed using different methods, yet the haemagglutination inhibition
   (HI) test is considered the gold standard' for AI antibody subtyping.
   Although alternative diagnostic assays have been developed, in most
   cases, their accuracy has been evaluated in comparison with HI test
   results, whose performance for poultry has not been properly evaluated.
   Objective The objective of this study was to estimate the diagnostic
   sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of the HI test and six other
   diagnostic assays for the detection of AI antibodies without assuming a
   gold standard. Methods We applied a Bayesian version of latent class
   analysis to compare the results of multiple tests from different study
   settings reported in the literature. Results The results showed that the
   HI test has nearly perfect accuracy (i.e. 98 center dot 8\% sensitivity
   and 99 center dot 5\% specificity). It performed well in both chickens
   and turkeys and yet was less accurate in experimentally infected
   poultry, compared to naturally infected. Blocking ELISA and the indirect
   immunofluorescence assay also performed very well. Conclusions Given its
   very high Se and Sp, the HI test may be effectively considered a gold
   standard. In the framework of LPAI surveillance, where large numbers of
   samples have to be processed, the blocking ELISA could be a valid
   alternative to the HI test, in that it is almost as sensitive and
   specific as the HI test yet quicker and easier to automate.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between Vibrio parahaemolyticus strains isolated from
   the aquatic environment and those isolated from cases of infection in
   humans is poorly understood due to the low prevalence of tdh- and/or
   trh-positive strains in the environment. To address this concern, it
   would be useful to analyse the genetic relationships among environmental
   and food strains and with reference to clinical isolates, also applying
   molecular typing methods. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   prevalence of toxigenic V.parahaemolyticus in Italian coastal waters and
   seafood, to examine intra-species variability and to identify, using
   serotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), relationships
   among strains from different sources, geographical origin and period of
   isolation. Of the 192 V.parahaemolyticus strains isolated in different
   Italian areas and examined in this study, 25 (13.0\%) proved to carry
   the trh gene while none of the strains proved positive to the search by
   PCR for tdh and Group-Specific-toxRS genes. The prevalence of toxigenic
   strains in the Tyrrhenian Sea was significantly lower than that
   calculated for the Ligurian coasts. Regarding the sources of isolation,
   the higher prevalence of trh-positive V.parahaemolyticus was revealed in
   fish, followed by clams, plankton, oysters, mussels and lastly seawater.
   Within the toxigenic strains, 16 serotypes and 20 distinct PFGE patterns
   were identified. Two clusters, which included a total of 8
   V.parahaemolyticus strains, were specifically associated with the North
   Adriatic Sea area and were stable over time. Our results demonstrate
   that trh-positive V.parahaemolyticus strains circulated in Italy in the
   period 20022009 with a prevalence higher than that reported from other
   European and extra-European countries, confirming that toxigenic
   V.parahaemolyticus is an emerging public health concern in Italy,
   regardless of its pandemic potential.}},

   possible solution due to their capability to satisfy 2 different
   requirements: (i) they are an important source of protein and other
   nutrients; (ii) their use as food has ecological advantages over
   conventional meat and, in the long run, economic benefits. However,
   little is known on the food safety side and this can be of critical
   importance to meet society's approval, especially if people are not

Abstract = {{Since 2006 the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) population in north-eastern Italy
   has experienced an epidemic of canine distemper virus (CDV).
   Additionally, in 2008, after a thirteen-year absence from Italy, fox
   rabies was re-introduced in the Udine province at the national border
   with Slovenia. Disease intervention strategies are being developed and
   implemented to control rabies in this area and minimise risk to human
   health. Here we present empirical data and the epidemiological picture
   relating to these epidemics in the period 2006-2010. Of important
   significance for epidemiological studies of wild animals, basic
   mathematical models are developed to exploit information collected from
   the surveillance program on dead and/or living animals in order to
   assess the incidence of infection. These models are also used to
   estimate the rate of transmission of both diseases and the rate of
   vaccination, while correcting for a bias in early collection of CDV
   samples. We found that the rate of rabies transmission was roughly twice
   that of CDV, with an estimated effective contact between infected and
   susceptible fox leading to a new infection occurring once every 3 days
   for rabies, and once a week for CDV. We also inferred that during the
   early stage of the CDV epidemic, a bias in the monitoring protocol
   resulted in a positive sample being almost 10 times more likely to be
   collected than a negative sample. We estimated the rate of intake of
   oral vaccine at 0.006 per day, allowing us to estimate that roughly 68\%
   of the foxes would be immunised. This was confirmed by field
   observations. Finally we discuss the implications for the
   eco-epidemiological dynamics of both epidemics in relation to control
   measures.}},

   presentation in dogs?}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Infection by two or more canine vector-borne disease
   (CVBD)-causing pathogens is common in subtropical and tropical regions
   where vectors are plentiful. Co-infections may potentiate disease
   pathogenesis, thereby altering clinical manifestations typically
   associated with singular infections. These factors complicate diagnosis,
   treatment and can adversely influence prognosis if the practitioner
   fails to suspect, document, and treat each concurrent infection. The
   spectrum of pathogens co-infecting dogs may change over time in a given
   practice location due to the rapid expansion of arthropods and their
   associated vectored agents, and international transit among pets and
   wild animals. This applies, for example, to Dirofilaria immitis and
   Leishmania infantum, the distributions of which have expanded from
   northern to southern Italy, and vice versa, respectively. Indeed, mixed
   infections by D. immitis and L. infantum have only been reported once in
   Italy, probably due to the fact that competent vectors for these
   infections do not usually occur in the same geographical areas. Thus,
   information that would help practitioners to identify clinical
   presentations in dogs co-infected by D. immitis and L. infantum and
   other CVBD-causing pathogens is scant.
   Findings: This manuscript describes the clinical history and physical
   examination of findings for 7 CVBD co-infected dogs that were examined
   because of a spectrum of clinical signs. Five dogs were co-infected with
   L. infantum and Ehrlichia canis, one dog with L. infantum, E. canis and
   D. immitis and the remaining dog with L. infantum and D. immitis.
   Conclusions: The clinical signs and haematological abnormalities
   associated with the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of these dogs is
   discussed. Also, the usefulness of bone marrow specimens for the
   molecular diagnosis of CVBDs and for the enhanced monitoring of
   treatment response is emphasized.}},

   well-documented northward spread. The mass use of preventive measures
   against sandfly bites (collar and spot-on formulations) was tested in a
   small focus recently established in an isolated hilly area of
   north-eastern Italy (Colli Euganei). In 2006 and 2007, a total of 449
   dogs living in the southern part of Colli Euganei were screened against
   Leishmania infantum using an immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT),
   and 31 (6.9\%) were seropositive. A risk factor analysis clearly
   described the focus as limited to a small village named Calaone. In
   2010, 63 animals from Calaone were sampled and their owners interviewed
   to verify the effectiveness of the preventive measures. According to
   what reported by owners, dogs started to be protected in 2006 (66.7\%
   dogs protected), and protection rate incremented (around 90\%) during
   the subsequent years. The seroprevalence value (4.2\%) of the youngest
   age class (<5 years) was significantly lower than other classes,
   demonstrating that animals born after 2006 had low probabilities of
   getting infected. Besides, seroprevalence value referred only to dogs
   living in Calaone was 32.4\% (23/71) in 2006-2007 and 20.6\% (13/63) in

Abstract = {{After an urgent inquiry into a suspected international outbreak of

   nationwide multidisciplinary investigation was carried out in Italy. The
   aims were to verify whether the higher than expected number of cases of

   were linked to the outbreak in Hungary and to determine their origin.
   Between June 2009 and March 2010, 79 confirmed cases of S. Goldcoast
   infection were identified. Of these, 17 were part of three different
   point-source outbreaks probably associated with the consumption of
   salami. Eating salami was also reported by 20 of the 39 sporadic cases
   that could be interviewed. Fifteen strains of S. Goldcoast isolated from
   the cases were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. They shared
   more than 90\% homology with the Hungarian epidemic strain and were also
   highly similar to S. Goldcoast strains that had been isolated in Italy
   from pigs and pork-containing food items in 2009 and 2010. Although the
   origin of the outbreak and the common source linking the Hungarian and
   the Italian cases could not be definitively identified, our results

   mosquitoes in endemic areas of Italy}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Background: The occurrence of infections by Dirofilaria immitis in
   canine and human populations depends on several factors linked to both
   the definitive and intermediate hosts. Little data are available on the
   risk of human and dog exposure to D. immitis in endemic areas. Data
   collected on dog- and human-bait traps in endemic areas of north-eastern
   Italy were used to estimate the likelihood of a receptive host coming
   into contact with an infected vector.
   Methods: From 1997 to 1999, mosquitoes were collected from three
   sampling sites of north-eastern Italy on D. immitis microfilaraemic dogs
   and on human baits. The bite/night/host rates were determined based on
   the number of feeding and probing mosquitoes on dogs and humans,
   respectively. The survival/mortality rates of different species of
   mosquitoes following the blood meal, and the rate of natural Dirofilaria
   infection in unfed specimens were estimated. The risk of exposure of
   dogs and humans to infected mosquito species was determined by combining
   the bite/host/night and the mosquito infection rates.
   Results: A total of 1,165 mosquitoes were collected on human (n = 815)
   and dog (n = 350) baits with varying species composition (i.e., Culex
   pipiens, 87.3\% and Ochlerotatus caspius, 11.6\%). Overall, dogs were
   more attractive to Cx pipiens than humans (feeding rate 70.2\% vs
   probing rate 25.9\%). The highest bite/night/host rate was 84.0 for dogs
   and 26.5 for humans. Cx pipiens displayed a mortality rate of 76.3\%
   within 13 days and Oc. caspius of 100\% within two days following the
   infective blood meal. In addition, D. immitis DNA was detected in unfed
   Cx pipiens (infection rate of 0.26\%-2.07\%). The infection rate
   adjusted for mosquito mortality was 0.38\%. Based on data collected, the
   contact between an infected mosquito and a host can occur as often as
   every four nights for D. immitis infected-mosquitoes in dogs and within
   two weeks for humans.
   Conclusions: Cx pipiens was confirmed as the most efficient natural
   vector of D. immitis in the studied area. In endemic areas, the risk of
   transmission can be very high for dogs and relevant for humans. Despite
   the increased awareness of veterinarians and owners on canine
   dirofilarioses, dogs from rural areas still maintain the natural life
   cycle of Dirofilaria spp., therefore acting as a source of infection to
   humans through vector bites.}},

Abstract = {{Dexamethasone is a potent synthetic corticosteroid synthesised as an
   anti-inflammatory agent, but also illegally used at low dosages as a
   growth promoter either alone or in combination with other steroids or
   -agonists. The use of screening methods based on the detection of
   biological effects of growth promoters is a promising approach to assist
   residue monitoring. The advantage of such an approach is that it offers
   the possibility to discover illicit treatments even when the drug
   residues are not easily detectable by common analytical methods. The aim
   of this study was to determine the urinary elimination and tissue
   distribution of dexamethasone and to investigate whether endogenous
   corticosteroid profiling of urine could be used to establish a
   predictive tool for identifying any misuse of growth promoters in bulls.
   Urinary corticosteroid concentrations were assayed in bulls (n=8)
   treated with dexamethasone (0.75mg/animal/day), bulls (n=8) treated with
   a combination of dexamethasone (0.66mg/animal/day) and clenbuterol (from
   2 to 6mg/animal/day) and untreated bulls (n=8). The distribution and
   elimination of dexamethasone and the urinary concentration of cortisone,
   cortisol and 6-hydroxycortisol were determined by using LC-MS/MS at
   different time points both during treatments and after appropriate
   withdrawal times. The urinary concentration of endogenous
   corticosteroids in bulls decreased significantly (p<0.001) upon the
   administration of dexamethasone alone, whereas it remained unchanged
   until the last sampling point in animals treated with dexamethasone and
   clenbuterol (p<0.001). Nonetheless, dexamethasone administration
   significantly reduced (p<0.01) the urinary 6-hydroxycortisol/cortisol
   ratio in both treatment groups. Therefore, this ratio could be regarded
   as a candidate for an indirect screening assay for detecting
   glucocorticoid abuse in bull fattening to pick out farms where similar
   treatments are potentially in use and to suggest targeted sampling on
   remaining animals.}},

Abstract = {{Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) is the only member of serotype 1 avian
   paramyxoviruses (APMV-1) that causes respiratory and neurological
   disease in chickens and other species of birds and can cause severe
   economic losses in the poultry sector. Due to the relevant variability
   of the genome and the pathogenicity of NDV isolates, their detection in
   a specimen is not sufficient to provide and confirm an exact diagnosis,
   and so the assessment of virus pathotype is required.
   To diagnose rapidly and pathotype NDV directly in clinical specimens, a
   method based on RT-PCR and pyrosequencing analysis has been developed
   and is reported in the present study. A pair of degenerated primers was
   designed to amplify a portion of the fusion (F) gene responsible for
   virulence and used to test 315 specimens collected from 2006 to 2011.
   The subsequent pyrosequencing reaction identified a 30-bp region
   encompassing the cleavage site. A total of 213 out of 315 samples were
   pyrosequenced and results were compared and confirmed by the Sanger
   sequencing procedure, which is traditionally performed for NDV
   pathotyping.
   The pyrosequencing reaction provided high quality results in real time
   and proved to be more rapid and cost-efficient than the classical
   sequencing procedure, indicating it as a possible valid alternative to
   the currently used diagnostic assays for NDV. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Avian adenovirus infections cause important disease complexes in

   in overt disease. Previously several outbreaks of gizzard erosions
   caused by a fowl adenovirus A serotype-1 (FAdV-1) were reported from
   Japan. Here we report an outbreak of gizzard erosions in 12 broiler
   flocks in Germany in 2011. Chickens had a reduced daily weight gain and
   a higher total mortality rate of up to 8\%. The birds showed a severe
   detachment of the koilin layer and ulcerative to necrotizing lesions of
   the underlying mucosa. Histopathologically, necrotizing ventriculitis
   with basophilic, intranuclear inclusion bodies in epithelial cells was
   diagnosed. Immunohistochemistry, egg culture, and electron microscopic
   examination revealed adenovirus-like particles in the samples. No
   concurrent infectious agent could be identified. The virus was genotyped
   as FAdV-1 by PCR and subsequent sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of the
   hexon loop L1 gene yielded 100\% sequence identity to the chicken embryo
   lethal orphan strain. These findings suggest that outbreaks of
   adenoviral gizzard erosion can lead to significant economic losses in

Abstract = {{Mercury (Hg) settlements in the Mediterranean Sea determine a potential
   toxicological relevance of seafood intakes for coastal populations. To
   assess this possibility, fish, molluscs, and crustaceans of commercial
   size of 69 different species were sampled and analyzed for total mercury
   (Hg-TOT) from georeferenced areas and evaluated for their compliance
   with the European Union Maximum Residue Limits of 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg wet
   weight (ww). Accounting for the weekly estimated seafood intake in the
   Italian coastal population (mean 469-626 g/person/week) it was then
   possible to recover threshold contamination values in seafood. Under a
   Tolerable Weekly Intake of 1.3 mu g/kg/bw/week, a threshold seafood
   contamination <0.10 mg/kg ww has been derived for sensitive groups. A
   suitable algorithm based on the parallel MeHg and Hg-TOT analysis on the
   most consumed species, helped to refine the uncertainties related to the
   conservative assumption in seafood all the Hg-TOT present is in form of
   MeHg. This work aims to improve the link between the risk management and
   risk assessment strategies, with the identification of those fish and
   seafood species, that, when regularly consumed, could determine or
   prevent potential Hg-TOT/MeHg overintakes in sensitive groups. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Background: Pigs play a key epidemiologic role in the ecology of
   influenza A viruses (IAVs) emerging from animal hosts and transmitted to
   humans. Between 2008 and 2010, we investigated the health risk of
   occupational exposure to swine influenza viruses (SIVs) in Italy, during
   the emergence and spread of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (H1N1pdm) virus.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Serum samples from 123 swine workers
   (SWs) and 379 control subjects (Cs), not exposed to pig herds, were
   tested by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay against selected SIVs
   belonging to H1N1 (swH1N1), H1N2 (swH1N2) and H3N2 (swH3N2) subtypes
   circulating in the study area. Potential cross-reactivity between swine
   and human IAVs was evaluated by testing sera against recent, pandemic
   and seasonal, human influenza viruses (H1N1 and H3N2 antigenic
   subtypes). Samples tested against swH1N1 and H1N1pdm viruses were
   categorized into sera collected before (n. 84 SWs; n. 234 Cs) and after
   (n. 39 SWs; n. 145 Cs) the pandemic peak. HI-antibody titers >= 10 were
   considered positive. In both pre-pandemic and post-pandemic peak
   subperiods, SWs showed significantly higher swH1N1 seroprevalences when
   compared with Cs (52.4\% vs. 4.7\% and 59\% vs. 9.7\%, respectively).
   Comparable HI results were obtained against H1N1pdm antigen (58.3\% vs.
   7.7\% and 59\% vs. 31.7\%, respectively). No differences were found
   between HI seroreactivity detected in SWs and Cs against swH1N2 (33.3\%
   vs. 40.4\%) and swH3N2 (51.2 vs. 55.4\%) viruses. These findings
   indicate the occurrence of swH1N1 transmission from pigs to Italian SWs.
   Conclusion/Significance: A significant increase of H1N1pdm
   seroprevalences occurred in the post-pandemic peak subperiod in the Cs
   (p<0.001) whereas SWs showed no differences between the two subperiods,
   suggesting a possible occurrence of cross-protective immunity related to
   previous swH1N1 infections. These data underline the importance of risk
   assessment and occupational health surveillance activities aimed at
   early detection and control of SIVs with pandemic potential in humans.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Dogs are the main reservoir hosts of Leishmania infantum,
   the agent of human zoonotic visceral leishmaniosis. This study
   investigated the efficacy of a polymer matrix collar containing a
   combination of 10\% imidacloprid and 4.5\% flumethrin as a novel
   prophylactic measure to prevent L. infantum infections in young dogs
   from a hyper-endemic area of southern Italy, with a view towards
   enhancing current control strategies against both human and canine
   leishmaniosis.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: The study was carried out on 124 young
   dogs, of which 63 were collared (Group A) while 61 were left untreated
   (Group B), from March-April 2011 until March 2012. Blood and skin
   samples were collected at baseline (April 2011) and at the first,
   second, third and fourth follow-up time points (July, September 2011 and
   November 2011, and March 2012, respectively). Bone marrow and
   conjunctiva were sampled at baseline and at the fourth follow-up.
   Serological, cytological and molecular tests were performed to detect
   the presence of L. infantum in the different tissues collected. At the
   end of the trial, no dog from Group A proved positive for L. infantum at
   any follow-up, whereas 22 dogs from Group B were infected (incidence
   density rate = 45.1\%); therefore, the combination of 10\% imidacloprid
   and 4.5\% flumethrin was 100\% efficacious for the prevention of L.
   infantum infection in young dogs prior to their first exposure to the
   parasite in a hyper-endemic area for CanL.
   Conclusions: The use of collars containing 10\% imidacloprid and 4.5\%
   flumethrin conferred long-term protection against infection by L.
   infantum to dogs located in a hyper-endemic area, thus representing a
   reliable and sustainable strategy to decrease the frequency and spread
   of this disease among the canine population which will ultimately result
   in the reduction of associated risks to human health.}},

Abstract = {{Contents Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP)
   strains have been isolated from dogs with increasing frequency;
   prolonged or excessive use of antimicrobials is associated with the
   selection of MRSP, and misuse of antimicrobials is frequent in breeding
   kennels. This study was carried out in two breeding kennels (A and B) in
   which we had isolated MRSP in 2008: the aim was to assess colonization
   of previously positive bitches and of other bitches sharing the same
   environment and to assess the genetic profile of both the old and the
   new strains {[}spa typing, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec
   (SCCmec) typing and Pulsed-field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE)]. Six
   animals from Kennel A (two from 2008) and eight from Kennel B (one from
   2008) were tested: 16 MRSP strains were isolated only from bitches
   housed in Kennel B. Old and new isolates were mecA positive, resulted
   spa type t02 and carried SSCmec IIIII. PGFE showed that all isolates
   were related and belonged to the main clone lineage dominating in
   Europe, ST71-J-t02-IIIII. Kennels A and B differ in the use of
   antimicrobials, which has been reduced over time in Kennel A, while has
   remained excessive in Kennel B, where many agents belonging to different
   classes (third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, macrolids)
   are administered to dogs, without veterinary supervision, especially
   around parturition. Misuse of antimicrobials is the key factor for the
   selection of MRSP strains in healthy dogs and for their persistence over
   time. Dog breeders should be aware that infections caused by
   multiresistant bacteria have very limited therapeutical options and
   represent a huge challenge for animal health.}},

Abstract = {{In humans, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) gene battery constitutes
   a set of contaminant-responsive genes, which have been recently shown to
   be involved in the regulation of several patho-physiological conditions,
   including tumorigenesis.
   As the domestic dog represents a valuable animal model in comparative
   oncology, mRNA levels of cytochromes P450 1A1, 1A2 and 1B1 (CYP1A1, 1A2
   and 1B1), AHR, AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT), AHR repressor (AHRR,
   whose partial sequence was here obtained) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2)
   were measured in dog control tissues (liver, skin, mammary gland and
   bone), in 47 mast cell tumors (MCTs), 32 mammary tumors (MTs), 5
   osteosarcoma (OSA). and related surgical margins.
   Target genes were constitutively expressed in the dog, confirming the
   available human data. Furthermore, their pattern of expression in tumor
   biopsies was comparable to that already described in a variety of human
   cancers; in particular, both AHR and COX2 genes were up-regulated and
   positively correlated, while CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNAs were generally
   poorly expressed.
   This work demonstrated for the first time that target mRNAs are
   expressed in neoplastic tissues of dogs, thereby increasing the
   knowledge about dog cancer biology and confirming this species as an
   useful animal model for comparative studies on human oncology. (C) 2012

   southern Italy: a threat for wild endangered species?}},
Journal = {{BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Background: Betanodaviruses are the causative agents of Viral
   Encephalopathy and Retinopathy (VER). To date, more than 50 species have
   proved to be susceptible and among them, those found in genus
   Epinephelus are highly represented. Clinical disease outbreaks are
   generally characterized by typical nervous signs and significant
   mortalities mainly associated with aquaculture activities, although some
   concerns for the impact of this infection in wild fish have been raised.
   In this study, the authors present the first documented report
   describing an outbreak of VER in wild species in the Mediterranean
   basin.
   Case presentation: In late summer - early winter 2011
   (September-December), significant mortalities affecting wild Dusky
   grouper (Epinephelus marginatus), Golden grouper (Epinephelus costae)
   and European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) were reported in the
   municipality of Santa Maria di Leuca (Northern Ionian Sea, Italy). The
   affected fish showed an abnormal swimming behavior and swollen abdomens.
   During this epizootic, five moribund fish showing clear neurological
   signs were captured and underwent laboratory investigations. Analytical
   results confirmed the diagnosis of VER in all the specimens. Genetic
   characterization classified all betanodavirus isolates as belonging to
   the RGNNV genotype, revealing a close genetic relationship with viral
   sequences obtained from diseased farmed fish reared in the same area in
   previous years.
   Conclusion: The close relationship of the viral sequences between the
   isolates collected in wild affected fish and those isolated during
   clinical disease outbreaks in farmed fish in the same area in previous
   years suggests a persistent circulation of betanodaviruses and
   transmission between wild and farmed stocks. Further investigations are
   necessary to assess the risk of viral transmission between wild and
   farmed fish populations, particularly in marine protected areas where
   endangered species are present.}},

   clusters co-circulated in 2010. Such clusters correlated with 2.2.1 and
   2.2.1.1 clades, showing for the first time that the new emerging clade
   2.2.1.1 is antigenically distinct. This study highlights that the

Month = {{JAN 16}},
Abstract = {{Presently, 45\% of the total human population of Europe, as well as
   their domestic and companion animals, are exposed to the risk of
   vector-borne helminths (VBH) causing diseases. A plethora of intrinsic
   biological and extrinsic factors affect the relationship among
   helminths, vectors and animal hosts, in a constantly changing
   environment. Although canine dirofilarioses by Dirofilaria immitis and
   Dirofilaria repens are key examples of the success of VBH spreading into
   non-endemic areas, another example is represented by Thelazia callipaeda
   eyeworm, an emergent pathogen of dogs, cats and humans in several
   regions of Europe. The recent finding of Onchocerca lupi causing canine
   and human infestation in Europe and overseas renders the picture of VBH
   even more complicated. Similarly, tick-transmitted filarioids of the
   genus Cercopithifilaria infesting the skin of dogs were recently shown
   to be widespread in Europe. Although for most of the VBH above there is
   an increasing accumulation of research data on their distribution at
   national level, the overall impact of the diseases they cause in dogs
   and humans is not fully recognised in many aspects. This review
   investigates the reasons underlying the increasing trend in distribution
   of VBH in Europe and discusses the diagnostic and control strategies
   currently available. In addition, this article provides the authors'
   opinion on some topics related to VBH that would deserve further
   scientific investigation.}},

Abstract = {{The present work describes the first Italian koi herpes virus (KHV)
   outbreak where the infectious agent was isolated and genetically
   characterized. At the beginning of April 2012, a batch of koi (Cyprinus
   carpio koi) was imported from Israel by a wholesale facility located in
   North-Eastern Italy. Fish, originating from different farms, were
   shipped separately but maintained together in the same tank upon
   arrival. Three weeks after the introduction of fish, an increased
   mortality was recorded. Typical clinical and pathological signs of koi
   herpesvirus disease (KHVD) were observed: enophthalmia, skin erosion,
   gill hemorrhages and necrosis, pale and enlarged kidney. The
   histological analysis of symptomatic koi allowed the detection of
   typical pale intranuclear inclusions in gill epithelium, intestinal
   lamina propria and kidney. Viral isolation yielded positive results and
   KHV isolation was confirmed by immunofluorescence. Conventional and real
   time PCR substantiated the presence of Cyprinid Herpesvirus type 3
   (CyHV-3) belonging to the U/I lineage. Mortality in the koi tank reached
   82.5\% and the few surviving fish were culled by the Official Veterinary
   Inspector. Epidemiological data and laboratory results suggested that
   the virus likely originated from Israel.}},

Abstract = {{Avian paramyxoviruses (APMVs) belong to the genus Avulavirus in the
   family Paramyxoviridae and include at least nine serotypes, APMV-1 to
   -9, as well as two additional provisional serotypes. Newcastle disease
   virus (NDV), which comprises APMV-1, is the most extensively studied
   APMV because it is an important poultry pathogen. A moderate level of
   antigenic and genetic diversity is recognized for APMV-1 isolates, but
   our knowledge of the antigenic and genetic diversity of the other APMV
   serotypes is limited. APMV-4 is frequently isolated from waterfowl
   around the world. To date complete genome sequences of APMV-4 are
   available for only strains, which were isolated from ducks in Hong Kong,
   Korea and Belgium over a period of 37 years. We have carried out genome
   sequencing from the nucleocapsid (N) gene-end signal to the polymerase
   (L) gene-start signal of five APMV-4 strains recently isolated from
   Italy. Each of the eight APMV-4 strains has the same F protein cleavage
   site, DIQPR down arrow F. They also share a high level of nucleotide and
   amino acid sequence identity: for example, the F and HN glycoproteins
   have greater than 97\% sequence identity between the various strains.
   Thus, comparison of these eight strains of APMV-4 did not provide
   evidence of substantial diversity, in contrast to similar studies with
   APMV-2, -3, and -6, in which the F and HN glycoproteins exhibited up to
   20-30\% amino acid sequence variation within a subgroup. Reciprocal
   cross-HI assay using post infection chicken sera also failed to detect
   significant antigenic variation among the available APMV-4 strains.

   cutaneous mast cell tumors (MCTs) by immunohistochemistry and
   quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to evaluate
   their prognostic significance and the association with the histologic
   grading and the mitotic index (MI). MCTs were graded according to the
   Patnaik grading system and the novel 2-tier grading system proposed by
   Kiupel. The numbers of mitotic figures/10 high-power fields (MI) were
   counted. Both grading systems were significantly associated with
   prognosis. The Patnaik grading was of limited prognostic value for grade
   2 MCTs, with 23\% being associated with mortality. The concordance among
   pathologists was strongly improved by the application of the 2-tier
   grading system, and 71\% of high-grade MCTs were associated with a high
   mortality rate. MI and Ki67 protein expression were significantly
   associated with grading and survival. No significant association between
   BCL-2 protein expression and either grading system or health status was
   observed. BCL-2 mRNA expression was significantly higher in grade 2 than
   in grade 1 MCTs, while no statistically significant differences were
   detected between low- and high-grade MCTs. The increased BCL-2 mRNA
   level was significantly associated with increased mortality rate. The
   COX-2 protein expression was detected in 78\% of the MCTs investigated.
   However, neither association with the tumor grade nor with the health
   status was observed. COX-2 mRNA was significantly up-regulated in MCTs
   compared to surgical margins and control skin tissue, but it was neither

   avian influenza isolates caused pancreatic damage resulting in
   hyperlipasemia in over 50\% of subjects, which evolved into
   hyperglycemia and subsequently diabetes. Histopathology of the pancreas
   showed signs of an acute infection resulting in severe fibrosis and
   disruption of the structure of the organ. Influenza virus nucleoprotein
   was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the acinar tissue. Human
   seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 viruses and avian H7N1 and H7N3 influenza virus
   isolates were able to infect a selection of human pancreatic cell lines.
   Human viruses were also shown to be able to infect human pancreatic
   islets. In situ hybridization assays indicated that viral nucleoprotein
   could be detected in beta cells. The cytokine activation profile
   indicated a significant increase of MIG/CXCL9, IP-10/CXCL10,

Abstract = {{In the last years the use of serious games has become relevant for
   education and learning, by allowing learners to acquire new skills and
   competences in an engaging, interactive environment. It is argued that
   the multi-sensory environment offered by virtual gaming worlds promote
   the development of multiple learning styles. These games can contribute
   to improve higher order cognitive ability such as critical thinking,
   problem-solving, decision-making and collaborative social skills. Some
   empirical evidence shows that games can be effective tools for enhancing
   learning and understanding of complex subject matter. Many games have
   been developed specifically to teach health-related content and to
   positively modify health-related behaviours. In particular, they have
   been realized in hygiene field, public safety, healthy eating, AIDS
   education, obesity prevention, and diabetes treatment, but less in the
   field of food safety. In Italy the increasing sale and consumption of
   raw milk are posing many health problems. Since 2004, raw milk
   consumption was found to be responsible of several out breaks of
   verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC). Furthermore serious
   cases of Haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS) were reported in particular
   among children, one of these had a fatal outcome in 2010. Ad hoc
   regulations were promoted by the Italian authorities to inform consumers
   on correct practices for raw milk consumption. However, in 2012, the
   Italian Ministry of Health underlines the need of implementing
   communication initiatives to improve consumers' awareness, since the
   practice to drink raw milk without boiling it first still raised a
   severe health problem.
   A project involving 807 Italian students (16 - 17 years old) was
   designed by the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie,
   with the aim to inform young consumers on this issue. Starting from the
   analysis of adolescents' food habits, behaviours and knowledge towards
   milk and especially raw milk, an online videogame was realized to
   communicate microbiological risks to the students. In the game, called
   ``A mysterious poisoning{''}, students help a detective to find out the
   cause of a food poisoning outbreak. Analysing all steps of the milk
   supply chain players learn the main crucial moments when milk can be
   contaminated and discover good practices to manage milk safely. In this
   way they can test their knowledge and, at the same time, they receive
   new information on selected topics. The efficacy of the tool was
   evaluated through two structured questionnaires administered to the
   students before and after the interaction with the game. Data collected
   before playing showed the need to enhance risk communication
   intervention aimed at guarantee consumer protection. After playing the
   game, students' knowledge about the risks associated with the
   consumption of raw milk increased as well as the perception of their
   exposure to food risks. However data revealed a low level of awareness
   about practices regarding safe milk storage and correct handling at
   home. Moreover, the evaluation of critical aspects of the online
   videogame provided useful information for the implementation of
   education strategies oriented to disseminate food risk knowledge to
   students effectively.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present work was to evaluate the expression of 8-OHdG
   (8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine) in the benthic fish Zosterisessor
   ophiocephalus collected in two differently polluted sites of the
   Venetian lagoon (Porto Marghera and Caroman). We compared our data on
   8-OHdG with those of CYP1A (Cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A,
   polypeptide 1), which is a well known biomarker for detoxification of
   contaminants. Immunohistochemistry with an antibody to 8-OHdG showed
   immunopositivity in nuclei of hepatocytes as well as in melanomacrophage
   centres of spleen and kidney, whereas an antiCYP1A antibody exhibited
   positive immunostaining in the liver, kidney and ovary. The liver of
   males showed higher expression of both proteins than females. In animals
   from Porto Marghera site, the enzymatic assay for 8-OHdG exhibited
   higher levels in liver of males than in females. Western Blot analysis
   using the antibody anti-CYP1A recognized the presence of a band of about
   60 kDa in the liver of males and females. Males exhibited a strong band,
   whereas in females the band showed a lower intensity. By using Real-Time
   PCR, the mRNA expression of CYP1A did not show any differences between
   males and females from each site, but it was at borderline significance
   level. Comparing the two sites, mRNA expression of CYP1A was
   significantly higher in the liver of both males and females from Porto
   Marghera than that of Caroman. The present data suggest that pollutants
   are bio-available as demonstrated by our biomarker analyses and may have
   a harmful effect on aquatic organisms such as Z. ophiocephalus. We
   report that the highest levels of hepatic 8-OHdG and CYP1A expression
   were detected in males, showing clear gender specificity.}},

Abstract = {{The present study aimed to obtain data on the occurrence of Giardia
   duodenalis in calves in four major cattle rearing countries in Europe
   (Germany, UK, France and Italy), along with genotyping data and risk
   factors associated with these infections. A total of 2072 calves were
   sampled on 207 farms. The majority of the animals were Holstein dairy or
   mixed Holstein calves (n = 1565 or 75.5\%), and were female (n = 1640 or
   79.1\%). The average age was 7.8 weeks (SD = 4.1; median = 7; range =
   2-16 weeks). All fecal samples were tested using a commercially
   available monoclonal antibody-based ELISA. The overall apparent
   prevalence of G. duodenalis for the four countries was 45.4\% (n =
   942/2072) and the overall farm prevalence was 89.9\% (186/207), with
   differences in both animal and farm prevalence between the four
   countries. The prevalence was significantly higher in animals up to 8
   weeks (OR=1.88; P<0.001) compared to older calves, and several
   management factors including contact with the Dam, Frequency of cleaning
   of the Maternity Pens, and Disinfection of the Calf Housing were found
   to be associated with infection. Positive samples were withheld for
   genotyping using the beta-giardin and triose phosphate isomerase gene:
   G. duodenalis assemblage E was most prevalent, although 43\% of the
   isolates were typed as assemblage A, with differences in between
   countries. Furthermore, 32\% of the examined samples was found to be a
   mixed assemblage A and E infection, which is consistent with previous
   reports. The results of the present study confirm previous findings in
   other European countries that G. duodenalis infections are common in
   calves. The infection especially occurs in animals younger than 2
   months, and the proportion of positive animals gradually decreased with
   increasing age. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the Veneto region (northern Italy), some geographic areas in the Po
   Valley have a large concentration of industrial poultry farms and are
   located close to wet areas with high populations of wild waterfowl. Live
   decoy birds belonging to the orders of Anseriformes and Charadriiformes
   can constitute a ``bridge{''} for avian influenza (AI) viruses between
   the wild reservoir and the rural holdings where live decoy birds are
   usually kept, sometimes together with poultry. Thus, the use of live
   decoy birds during bird hunting could increase the risk of exposure of
   poultry farms to AI viruses. Since 2008, this kind of hunting has been
   strictly regulated with regard to the detection and use of live decoy
   birds. In order to guarantee the application of appropriate AI
   risk-modulating and monitoring measures in the management of the live
   decoys according to the European Union (EU) provisions, a solid and
   well-structured information system has been created. The Regional Data
   Bank (RDB) of farms and livestock, which has been operating since 1997,
   also contains data on farms and poultry movements. Therefore, the RDB
   management software was updated to collect data from the hunters who
   keep live decoy birds, and specific functions were integrated to ensure
   the traceability of these birds. Each live decoy bird has been
   identified by an irremovable ring. The individual code of each ring is
   recorded in the RDB and linked to both the holder's code and the hunting
   area. Transfers and death/slaughtering of the registered birds are
   recorded, too. The activation of a computerized data collection system
   has proven to be a prerequisite for the implementation of a control
   system for live decoy birds and provides an essential tool for the
   management of AI emergencies.}},

Abstract = {{Highly pathogenic (HP) and low pathogenic (LP) avian influenza viruses
   (AIVs) belonging to H5 and H7 subtypes have been found to be associated
   with human infection as the result of direct transmission from infected
   poultry. Human infections by AIVs can cause mild or subclinical disease,
   and serosurveys are believed to represent an important tool to identify
   risk of zoonotic transmission. Therefore, we sought to examine Italian
   poultry workers exposed during LPAI and HPAI outbreaks with the aim of
   assessing serologic evidence of infection with H5 and H7 AIVs. From
   December 2008 to June 2010 serum samples were collected from 188 poultry
   workers and 379 nonexposed controls in Northern Italy. The
   hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay using horse red blood cells
   (RBCs) and a microneutralization (MN) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   test were used to analyze human sera for antibodies against the
   following H5 and H7 LPAI viruses: A/Dk/It/4445/07(H5N2);
   A/Ty/It/2369/09(H5N7); A/Ty/It1218-193/10; A/Ck/It/3775/99(H7N1);
   A/Ty/It/214845/03(H7N3); and A/Dk/It/332145/09(H7N3). Since previous
   studies identified low antibody titer to AIVs in people exposed to
   infected poultry, a cutoff titer of >= 1:10 was chosen for both
   serologic assays. Only HI-positive results confirmed by MN assay were
   considered positive for presence of specific antibodies. The Fisher
   exact test was used to analyze differences in seroprevalence between
   poultry workers and control groups, with the significance level set at P
   < 0.05. MN results showed a proportion of H7-seropositive poultry
   workers (6/188, i.e., 3.2\%), significantly higher than that of controls
   (0/379), whereas no MN-positive result was obtained against three H5
   LPAI subtypes recently identified in Italy. In conclusion, the survey
   indicated that assessing seroprevalence can be an important tool in risk
   assessment and health surveillance of poultry workers.}},

Title = {{Intestinal parasite infections in immigrant children in the city of

Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Parasitic diseases can represent a social and economic
   problem among disadvantaged people - even in developed countries. Due to
   the limited data available concerning Europe, the aims of the present
   study were to evaluate the presence of parasites in immigrant children
   and the risk factors favouring the spread of parasites. Subsequently,
   the possible correlation between nutritional status and parasitic
   infections was also investigated.
   Findings: A convenience sample of two hundred and forty seven immigrant
   children (aged 0-15) attending the Poliambulatorio della Medicina
   Solidale in Rome was examined. Data were collected using structured
   questionnaires, and parasitological and anthropometric tests were
   applied. Chi-squared test and binary logistic multiple-regression models
   were used for statistical analysis.
   Thirty-seven children (15\%) tested positive to parasites of the
   following species: Blastocystis hominis, Entamoeba coli, Giardia
   duodenalis, Enterobius vermicularis, Ascaris lumbricoides and
   Strongyloides stercoralis. A monospecific infection was detected in 30
   (81\%) out of 37 parasitized children, while the others (19\%) presented
   a polyparasitism. The major risk factors were housing, i.e. living in
   shacks, and cohabitation with other families (p<0.01). Children
   classified in the lower height Z-scores had a significantly greater
   prevalence of parasites (30.9\%) than the others (p<0.01).
   Conclusions: This study shows that parasite infection in children is
   still quite common, even in a developed country and that children's
   growth and parasitism may be related. Extensive improvements in the
   living, social and economic conditions of immigrants are urgently needed
   in order to overcome these problems.}},

   Upper-Limb Ischemia Improve Outcomes?}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF VASCULAR SURGERY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{Background: Since 1963, Fogarty balloon catheter thromboembolectomy is
   usually adopted as the gold standard treatment for acute limb ischemia.
   As the success of the procedure depends on complete removal of all
   thromboembolic material, intraoperative arteriography can be used after
   arterial thromboembolectomy as a guide for extension of the procedure.
   It is still a matter of debate whether intraoperative angiography should
   be routinely performed in all cases or only in selected cases, depending
   on intraoperative findings, when the surgeon suspects an incomplete
   disobstruction. Most published evidence derives from analysis of
   lower-limb thromboembolectomies. The aim of our retrospective study was
   to elucidate the value of routine completion angiogram in acute arterial
   embolism of the upper limb.
   Methods: Clinical and demographic data of 100 patients with acute
   embolic upper-limb ischemia were prospectively recorded during an
   18-year period in a central hospital vascular unit setting. The
   relevance of intraoperative angiography was retrospectively analyzed.
   The procedures were divided into two groups: group A, when
   intraoperative angiography was performed in selected cases (selective
   angiography); and group B, when angiography was performed as a routine
   procedure in all cases (routine angiography). All factors associated
   with reocclusion and mortality were investigated to produce meaningful
   information that could assist the surgeon to predict outcomes.
   Results: Cumulative reocclusion and mortality rates at 24 months were
   14.0\% and 70.0\%, respectively. After upper-limb arterial embolectomy,
   the rate of extension of the procedure was significantly higher in group
   B than in group A (26.0\% vs. 4.0\%, P = 0.002). At 24 months after
   embolectomy, group B resulted in a lower incidence of reocclusion
   compared with group A (12.0\% vs. 2.0\%, P=0.05), whereas there was no
   statistical difference between the two groups in terms of mortality
   (P>0.05). On univariate analysis, the factor associated with increased
   2-year reocclusion rate was only the avoidance of completion
   angiography, although it lost some of its predictive value on
   multivariate analysis. Factors associated with increased 2-year
   mortality rate on univariate analysis included age >80 years, diabetes
   mellitus {[}DM], and antiplatelet drug use. Only DM was significantly
   associated on multivariate analysis.
   Conclusion: Routine use of intraoperative angiography influences outcome
   after embolectomy for upper-limb acute arterial occlusion. Routine use
   of intraoperative angiography, compared with selective use, results in a
   higher rate of extension of the procedure for residual lesion and in a
   lower rate of reocclusion at 24 months. In prevention of reocclusion,
   completion angiogram has a hazard ratio of 5.44 on multivariate
   analysis. Postoperative late mortality is mainly affected by old age and
   DM.}},

Abstract = {{Degradation of the extracellular matrix and angiogenesis are associated
   with tumour invasion and metastasis in human and canine neoplasia.
   Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), tissue inhibitors of
   metalloproteinases (TIMPs) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A
   (VEGF-A) are key mediators of these respective processes. Mast cell
   tumour (MCT) is the most common malignant cutaneous tumour in dogs. MCTs
   are always considered potentially malignant, but their true metastatic
   potential is unknown. In the present study, samples from seven grade 1,
   22 grade 2 and six grade 3 MCTs were subjected to quantitative real-time
   polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to evaluate
   MMP-2, MMP-9, membrane-type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP), TIMP-2 and VEGF-A mRNA and
   protein expression. Gelatin zymography (GZ) was also performed to
   evaluate MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity. MMP-9 and VEGF-A mRNA increased with
   histological grade, while TIMP-2 decreased with increasing grade. Gene
   expression data obtained for MMP-9, VEGF-A and TIMP-2 were confirmed by
   IHC for evaluation of the respective proteins. In contrast, MMP-2 and
   MT1-MMP had variable, but similar, expression for both mRNA and protein.
   Despite the high variability observed, there was correlation between
   MMP-2 and MT1-MMP mRNA expression (r= +0.91, P < 0.0001). The
   MMP-2:TIMP-2 and MMP-9:TIMP-1 mRNA ratios showed an imbalance between
   MMPs and their specific inhibitors in MCTs, which increased with the
   histological grade. Finally, the activities of both latent and active
   forms of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were evaluated by GZ and there were significant
   increases in their activities with increasing histological grade and
   immunohistochemical expression. This study demonstrates that MMP-9,
   TIMP-2 and VEGF-A expression is related to histological grade and
   suggests that these markers are possible indicators of malignancy and
   targets for therapeutic strategies. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Salmonella enterica 4,{[}5],12:i:- is a monophasic variant of
   S.Typhimurium. In the last decade, its prevalence rose sharply. Although
   S. 4,{[}5],12:i:- and S.Typhimurium are known to pose a considerable
   public health risk, there is no detailed information on the circulation
   of these serovars in Italy, particularly as far as veterinary isolates
   are concerned. For this reason, a data set of 877 strains isolated in
   the north-east of Italy from foodstuffs, animals and environment was
   analysed during 20052010. The Random Forests (RF) method was used to
   identify the most important epidemiological and phenotypic variables to
   show the difference between the two serovars. Both descriptive analysis
   and RF revealed that S. 4,{[}5],12:i:- is less heterogeneous than
   S.Typhimurium. RF highlighted that phage type was the most important
   variable to differentiate the two serovars. The most common phage types
   identified for S. 4,{[}5],12:i:- were DT20a, U311 and DT193. The same
   phage types were also found in S.Typhimurium isolates, although with a
   much lower prevalence. DT7 and DT120 were ascribed to the two serovars
   at comparable levels. DT104, DT2 and DT99 were ascribed exclusively to
   S.Typhimurium, and almost all the other phage types identified were more
   related to the latter serovar. Such data confirm that phage typing can
   provide an indication of the biphasic or monophasic state of the strains
   investigated and could therefore support serotyping results. However,
   phage typing cannot be used as the definitive method to differentiate
   the two serovars, as part of the phage types were detected for both
   serovars and, in particular, all phage types found for S. 4,{[}5],12:i-
   were found also for S.Typhimurium.}},

   for pregnane X receptor (NR1I2) and constitutive androstane receptor
   (NR1I3) mRNAs, while a time-dependent increase of retinoid X receptor
   alpha (NR2B1) was noticed. Cytochrome P450 gene expression profiles were
   down-regulated as a function of time. In the induction study, an
   increase of NR1I2. NR1I3 and NR2B1 mRNAs was observed in
   dexamethasone-exposed CPHs. About CYPs, an overall up-regulation was
   seen in CPHs exposed to phenobarbital, while dexamethasone and
   rifampicin up-regulated only CYP3A. In both studies, transcriptional CYP
   results were confirmed at the post-translational level (immunoblotting
   and enzyme activities), except for CYP2B immunoblotting in the induction
   study. The present data demonstrate that long-term stored CPHs may be
   used to investigate mechanisms involved in CYPs regulation, expression
   and function; provide further info about NR regulation of CYPs, and
   confirm species-differences in these mechanisms of regulation; finally,

Abstract = {{This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different intensities and
   durations of ultrasound on the composition, oxidation, cheese-making
   properties and sensory traits of raw milk. Moreover, the effects of the
   addition of CO2 and HCl prior to the sonication were tested to determine
   whether these chemicals could reduce the production of off-flavours.
   Treating milk with ultrasound led to certain changes in milk
   composition. We observed significant increases in free fatty acid
   levels, oxidation, and decreases in somatic cell count and pH; improved
   coagulation traits were also observed. The results of sensory
   evaluations revealed a significant increase in a burnt off-flavour with
   increasing intensity and duration of the ultrasound treatment. The
   addition of CO2 appeared to significantly reduce the disruptive effect
   of ultrasound, the formation of oxidation products and the detection of
   the burnt off-flavour, whereas the sour flavour was increased.
   Industrial relevance: Among the new technologies that are used to
   improve milk sanitisation and shelf life, ultrasound treatment has been
   demonstrated to inactivate many bacterial species and to be a viable
   sanitisation procedure.
   In this study the milk coagulation properties of sonicated milk were
   dramatically improved following the ultrasound (US) treatments,
   indicating a possible use for US in the cheese-making industry.
   Moreover, despite the evident production of off-flavours caused by US in
   milk, the use of CO2 to reduce pyrolytic processes and thus the
   formation of oxidation products, appeared to be promising with respect
   to the increased use of sonication on food and other organic matrices.

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate the hygiene performance of a
   camel (Camelus dromedarius) slaughtering process as carried out with the
   traditional method in the Sahrawi refugee camps located in southwestern
   Algeria. The camel slaughtering process in this region differs
   significantly from that carried out in commercial abattoirs.
   Slaughtering is performed outdoors in desert areas, and dehiding of the
   carcass is approached via the dorsoventral route rather than the classic
   ventrodorsal route. Samples were taken from 10 camel carcasses from
   three different areas: the hide, the carcass meat immediately after
   dehiding, and the meat after final cutting. Enterobacteriaceae counts
   (EC) were enumerated employing conventional laboratory techniques.
   Carcass meat samples resulted in EC below the detection limit more
   frequently if the hide samples from the same carcass had also EC counts
   below the detection limit. Because of the low number of trials, the
   calculation of statistical significance of the results was not possible.
   Further experimental research is needed in order to validate the results
   presented in this study. The comparison of the microbiological hygiene
   performance between dorsal dehiding and traditional ventral dehiding of
   slaughtered animals could serve to validate the hypothesis of the
   potential positive impact of the dorsal dehiding method in carcass meat
   hygiene.}},

Abstract = {{Polish Friesian male calves (n = 78) were used to investigate the
   effects of innovative feeding plans based on the provision of large
   amounts of solid feeds on growth performance, welfare, and carcass
   characteristics of veal calves. Groups of calves (initial BW 71.5 +/-
   3.7 kg) were fed 1 of 3 treatments (26 calves/treatment): 1) milk
   replacer plus corn grain (CG), 2) milk replacer plus an 80: 20 mixture
   (as-fed basis) of corn grain and wheat straw (CGS), or 3) milk replacer
   plus a 72: 20: 8 mixture (as-fed basis) of corn grain, wheat straw, and
   extruded soybean, respectively (CGSES). All the treatments provided at
   least 170 kg DM/calf from solid feed throughout the 206 d of fattening.
   Type and concentration of milk replacer were the same for all calves
   throughout fattening. Calves fed CGSES received 96\% of the daily amount
   of milk replacer delivered to CG and CGS to balance the dietary CP
   content. No differences (P >= 0.063) among treatments were observed for
   growth performance and DMI. Health status of CG calves was less than
   CGSES calves, as indicated by the greatest (P < 0.001) proportion of
   milk replacer refusal events and the greatest (P< 0.001) incidence of
   treatments for respiratory disorders. Inclusion of straw and soybean in
   the solid feeds increased (P < 0.001) the daily intake of iron in CGS
   and CGSES as compared with CG; however, blood hemoglobin concentrations
   measured at d 5 and 31 were greater (P < 0.05) than when measured on d
   80, 122, and 206 of fattening. Feeding treatment did not (P >= 0.107)
   affect HCW, dressing percentage, or carcass color. Calves fed CG had
   heavier (P < 0.001) reticulorumens and more (P < 0.001) developed rumens
   than CGS and CGSES calves, but 84\% and 68\% of CG rumens (P < 0.001)
   showed overt signs of hyperkeratinization and plaques, respectively.
   These alterations of rumen mucosa were not detected in CGSES calves, and
   only 8\% of CGS calves had rumen plaques. Regardless of feeding
   treatment, postmortem inspection recorded a prevalence of more than 84\%
   abomasal lesions. When feeding veal calves with large amounts of solids,
   it is advisable to avoid the provision of corn grain alone and replace
   part of the cereal with a roughage source to improve calf health and
   prevent rumen mucosa alterations.}},

   routine administration of one antibiotic around parturition (category
   2); routine administration of multiple antimicrobials around parturition
   (category 3). Bacteriological cultures and antibiotic susceptibility
   tests were performed on vaginal specimens, prepartum mammary secretions,
   and postpartum milk. Stillbirths and neonatal deaths were recorded for
   each whelping and analyzed as ``within-litter stillbirths{''} and
   ``within-litter neonatal deaths{''} according to kennel category, by
   Pearson chi(2) test and the Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test,
   respectively. The frequency of isolation and antimicrobial resistance of
   bacteria were analyzed according to kennel category by Pearson chi(2)
   test. Kennel category was not significantly associated with differing

   of isolation of potentially pathogenic bacteria in the three kennel
   categories significantly different. Kennel category 3 had a
   significantly higher frequency of isolation of multiresistant

Abstract = {{Salmonella remains a major public health concern worldwide.
   Microbiological methods are the gold standard for Salmonella detection.
   These methods are highly specific, but their sensitivity is variable.
   Moreover, they are lengthy, labour intensive and not always consistent
   with the speed of food manufacturing processes. Thus, in the food
   industry, there is the need for more rapid, sensitive and accurate
   detection methods. The purpose of this study is to describe a
   Salmonella-monitoring scheme in different food processing plants based
   on a screening approach by a commercial real-time polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) kit and subsequent confirmation of positive molecular
   results by the reference microbiological method. This scheme was tested
   on a total of 4,693 samples, 90 of which were positive with the
   real-time PCR screening; 52 of the positive samples were eventually
   confirmed by the microbiological method. The real-time PCR kit was
   tested in comparison to the microbiological method in order to evaluate
   its performances and drawbacks. The comparison between cycle threshold
   (Ct) values of real-time PCR and the microbiological results (Wilcoxon
   rank sum test) showed a statistically significant difference between the
   Ct values of bacteriological positive and bacteriological negative
   samples (p value, < 0.05). Furthermore, receiver operating
   characteristic curve analysis was used to identify the Ct value ensuring
   the lowest level of misclassification between Salmonella-positive and
   negative samples. The present study confirms that the real-time PCR kit
   tested could be used as a screening tool, leading to a rapid and
   sensitive identification of Salmonella and confining bacteriological
   confirmation to samples previously identified as positive.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 28}},
Abstract = {{Heterogeneity in the transmission rates of pathogens across hosts or
   environments may produce disease hotspots, which are defined as specific
   sites, times or species associations in which the infection rate is
   consistently elevated. Hotspots for avian influenza virus (AIV) in wild
   birds are largely unstudied and poorly understood. A striking feature is
   the existence of a unique but consistent AIV hotspot in shorebirds
   (Charadriiformes) associated with a single species at a specific
   location and time (ruddy turnstone Arenaria interpres at Delaware Bay,
   USA, in May). This unique case, though a valuable reference, limits our
   capacity to explore and understand the general properties of AIV
   hotspots in shorebirds. Unfortunately, relatively few shorebirds have
   been sampled outside Delaware Bay and they belong to only a few
   shorebird families; there also has been a lack of consistent
   oropharyngeal sampling as a complement to cloacal sampling. In this
   study we looked for AIV hotspots associated with other shorebird species
   and/or with some of the larger congregation sites of shorebirds in the
   old world. We assembled and analysed a regionally extensive dataset of
   AIV prevalence from 69 shorebird species sampled in 25 countries across
   Africa and Western Eurasia. Despite this diverse and extensive coverage
   we did not detect any new shorebird AIV hotspots. Neither large
   shorebird congregation sites nor the ruddy turnstone were consistently
   associated with AIV hotspots. We did, however, find a low but widespread
   circulation of AIV in shorebirds that contrast with the absence of AIV
   previously reported in shorebirds in Europe. A very high AIV antibody
   prevalence coupled to a low infection rate was found in both first-year
   and adult birds of two migratory sandpiper species, suggesting the
   potential existence of an AIV hotspot along their migratory flyway that
   is yet to be discovered.}},

Abstract = {{Information technology has embraced the ontological approach to expand
   its capacity to deal with knowledge of different kinds. The subsequent
   combination of formal concerns and philosophical considerations has led
   to the development of new knowledge systems that rely on foundational
   distinctions of entity type such as object, process, property and role.
   This change has attracted attention to the distinction between types of
   entity in the enterprise. The result is a compartmentalisation of the
   information, which, although well motivated and technically fruitful, is
   not always optimal for knowledge management (KM) tasks where one aims at
   an integrated view of information. This paper focuses on the notion of
   knowledge object understood as a formal construct for knowledge
   modelling and KM systems. The approach starts from formal and
   ontological analysis with an eye to modelling knowledge at large. The
   paper motivates the introduction of a notion of knowledge object as a
   new type of entity that emerges from the explicit interaction of
   material entities, information entities and roles within an enterprise.
   The main goals of this work are: to discuss the capacity of knowledge
   objects to tie knowledge and roles in an (enterprise) context; to model
   aspects of enterprise knowledge that escape standard ontological
   approaches; and to describe knowledge objects as a conceptual tool that
   can be integrated within existing formal systems. Knowledge Management

Abstract = {{Aims To investigate Norovirus (NoV) contamination of mussels, clams and
   oysters harvested in two class B harvesting areas of the delta of the Po
   river, to choose a species as an indicator. Methods and Results
   Environmental parameters (temperature and salinity) and hydrometric
   levels of the tributary river were measured. Seventy shellfish samples
   (35 samples per area) were examined for Escherichia coli and NoV (GI and
   GII). NoV contamination was found in 51.4\% of samples, of which, 2.9\%
   contained only NoV GI, 14.3\% only NoV GII, while the majority of the
   samples (34.3\%) contained both genogroups. Most of the positive results
   (90.0\%) were obtained in the period between November 2008 and April
   2009. Conclusions No significant differences were found between the
   results from the two harvesting areas and the three shellfish species.
   However, on the basis of the average Ct values, the recovery rate (from
   0.46 to 1.15\%) and the distribution of positive results in the
   samplings, mussels seem to be a suitable indicator species to monitor
   viral contamination in these areas. Significance and Impact of the Study
   The data allow the optimization of monitoring plans to improve the
   prevention strategies in terms of money and time, by the intensification
   of controls in the cold season and the use of one species as indicator.}},

Abstract = {{The assessment of fox immunity following oral rabies vaccination (ORV)
   is commonly applied to assess the efficacy of an ORV campaign in the

   techniques (NT), such as the fluorescent antibody virus neutralization
   test (FAVN) and the rapid fluorescent foci inhibition test (RFFIT). At a
   European level. NT and ELISA tests are used interchangeably and on
   different types of samples collected for vaccination follow-up. This has
   resulted in a difficulty in comparing the results generated with
   different diagnostic tools. We have evaluated (a) the effect of two
   different matrices commonly used for serology in red foxes on the
   results of the FAVN and (b) the performance of two commercially
   available ELISAs in comparison with the FAVN, as a gold standard, using
   a panel of over 700 field fox samples. Moderate agreement was observed
   when comparing results from different matrices. We found a very low
   level of agreement and low values of relative sensitivity and
   specificity of the ELISAs tested in comparison with the FAVN. Our
   findings confirm, using a vast collection afield samples obtained during
   post-vaccination surveillance campaigns in Italy, the need for improved

Abstract = {{A West Nile virus (WNV) strain belonging to lineage 2 was for the first
   time detected in two pools of Culex pipiens collected in the province of
   Udine and in tissues of a wild collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto)

   molecularly identified by group and WNV lineage specific RT-PCRs and
   characterized by partial sequencing of the NS3 and NS5 genes. When
   compared with the sequences of same fragments of NS3 and NS5 of the WNV
   lineage 2 strain isolated from birds of prey in Hungary (2004), the
   phylogenetic analysis of these sequences revealed 100\% and 99\%
   similarity, respectively. As the Hungarian strain, the NS3 selected
   sequence differed from the 2010 Greek isolate by one amino-acid located
   at 249 site which is the site involved in genetic modulation of WNV
   pathogenicity. The Italian and Hungarian strains have histidine rather
   than proline at this site. The presence of a lineage 2 strain in regions
   where the lineage 1 strain is still circulating, creates a new scenario
   with unpredictable consequences. In this situation comprehensive
   investigations on the occurrence, ecology, and epidemiology of these
   different WNV strains circulating in Italy become the highest priority.

   indirect biomarkers to detect low-dose dexamethasone illegal treatment
   in beef cattle}},
Journal = {{BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Corticosteroids are illegally used in several countries as
   growth promoters in veal calves and beef cattle, either alone or in
   association with sex steroids and beta-agonists, especially at low
   dosages and primarily through oral administration, in order to enhance
   carcasses and meat quality traits. The aim of the present study is to
   evaluate the reliability of the histological evaluation of the thymus,
   as well as the serum cortisol determination, in identifying beef cattle,
   treated with two different dexamethasone-based growth-promoting
   protocols and the application of different withdrawal times before
   slaughter.
   Results: Our findings demonstrate that low dosages of dexamethasone
   (DXM), administered alone or in association with clenbuterol as growth
   promoter in beef cattle, induce morphologic changes in the thymus,
   resulting in increase fat infiltration with concurrent cortical atrophy
   and reduction of the cortex/medulla ratio (C/M). In fact, the C/M value
   was significantly lower in treated animals than in control ones, with
   both the protocols applied. The cut off value of 0.93 for the
   cortex/medulla ratio resulted to be highly effective to distinguish
   control and treated animals. The animals treated with DXM showed
   inhibition of cortisol secretion during the treatment period, as well as
   at the slaughterhouse, 3 days after treatment suspension. The animals
   treated with lower doses of DXM in association with clenbuterol, showed
   inhibition of cortisol secretion during the treatment period, but serum
   cortisol concentration was restored to physiological levels at
   slaughterhouse, 8 days after treatment suspension.
   Conclusions: The histological evaluation of thymus morphology, and
   particularly of the C/M may represent a valuable and reproducible method
   applicable to large-scale screening programs, due to the easy sampling
   procedures at slaughterhouse, as well as time and cost-saving of the
   analysis. Serum cortisol determination could be considered as an useful
   in vivo biomarker of dexamethasone illegal treatment in beef cattle
   during the fattening period, whilst it does not appear to be a good
   biomarker at the slaughterhouse, since the protocol of DXM
   administration, as well as the withdrawal period could affect the
   reliability of the method.}},

Abstract = {{Selling fish products as fresh when they have actually been frozen and
   thawed is a common fraudulent practice in seafood retailing. Unlike fish
   products frozen to protect them against degenerative changes during
   transportation and to extend the product's storage life, fish intended
   for raw consumption in European countries must be previously frozen at
   -20 degrees C for at least 24 h to kill parasites. The aim of this study
   was to use histological analysis to distinguish between fresh and
   frozen-thawed fish and to evaluate this method for use as a routine
   screening technique in compliance with the requirements of European
   Commission Regulation No. 882/2004 on official food and feed controls.
   Method performance (i.e., accuracy and precision) was evaluated on
   tissue samples from three common Mediterranean fish species; the
   evaluation was subsequently extended to include samples from 35 fish
   species in a second experiment to test for method robustness. Method
   accuracy was tested by comparing histological results against a ``gold
   standard{''} obtained from the analysis of frozen and unfrozen fish
   samples prepared for the study. Method precision was evaluated according
   to interrater agreement (i.e., three laboratories with expertise in
   histopathology in the first experiment and three expert analysts in the
   second experiment) by estimating Cohen's kappa (and corresponding 95\%
   confidence intervals) for each pair of laboratories and experts and the
   combined Cohen's kappa for all three experts and laboratories. The
   observed interrater agreement among the three laboratories and the three
   experts indicated high levels of method accuracy and precision (high
   sensitivity and specificity) and method reproducibility. Our results
   suggest that histology is a rapid, simple, and highly accurate method
   for distinguishing between fresh and frozen-thawed fish, regardless of
   the fish species analyzed.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Consumer awareness of food safety and nutrition is a major issue in
   relation to healthy lifestyles and disease prevention. Improper consumer
   food management has been implicated in a large number of cases of
   foodborne illnesses. To reduce the risk of foodborne illness, consumers
   must be willing to change behaviours that are not consistent with safe
   food storage and preparation practices. Change in such behaviours is
   strongly related to consumer knowledge of proper food handling
   practices. At the same time there is public consciousness of the role of
   diet in contributing to the health status, but this awareness has not
   led to sufficient improvement of eating habits. What people buy and eat
   and the way they manage food depends not only on the individual but also
   on social, cultural, economic, and environmental factors. Identifying an
   effective strategy to improve consumers' behaviour is a concern for
   politicians and health promoters. Non-targeted spreading of generic
   information is one strategy, but seems to be relatively unsuccessful.
   This paper describes an innovative and effective methodology to improve
   the level of consumer awareness towards healthier food choices and safer
   behaviours based on a holistic approach. This strategy could be adopted
   to better disseminate information regarding healthy foods on a large
   scale and at a relatively low cost, obtaining significant benefits in
   terms of primary prevention and contributing to the amelioration of food
   management at the consumer level. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   Overall, the genetic sequence of guinea fowl astroviruses was related to
   turkey astrovirus type 2 (TastV2), although a marked genetic distance
   was revealed based on ORF2, which might indicate the circulation of a
   distinct virus genotype and serotype in guinea fowl. Furthermore, the
   genetic data presented herein suggest that either recombination between
   different astroviruses infecting distinct hosts or adaptation of a given
   astrovirus to a new host had occurred. In either case, direct or

   occurred between turkey and guinea fowl, indicating the ability of

Abstract = {{A retrospective telephone survey (n=3490) was conducted in Italy between
   2008 and 2009 to estimate the occurrence of self-reported acute
   gastrointestinal illness (AGI) and to describe subjects' recourse to
   healthcare, using a symptom-based case definition. Three hundred and ten
   AGI cases were identified. The annual incidence rate was 1.08
   episodes/person-year (95\% confidence interval 0.90-1.14). The
   proportion of subjects consulting physicians was 39.5\% while only 0.3\%
   submitted a specimen for laboratory investigation. Risk factors for AGI
   and medical care-seeking were identified using logistic regression
   analysis. Females, children and young adults had a significantly higher
   incidence rate of AGI. Factors associated with medical care-seeking were
   age < 10 years, presence of fever, diarrhoea, and duration of illness >
   3 days. Our results provide a relevant contribution towards estimating
   the global burden of AGI using standard methods that ensure a good level
   of comparability with other studies.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing diversity among H5 hemagglutinin (HA) subtype avian influenza
   (AI) viruses has resulted in the need of novel sensitive and specific
   molecular assays. In this study, an SYBR Green-based real-time reverse
   transcription-PCR (RRT-PCR) assay was developed for the detection of H5
   subtype AI virus. Sequence analysis of the Mexican lineage H5N2 isolates
   (subgroup B) revealed several mismatches in the primer/hydrolysis probe
   set reported in the commonly used RRT-PCR assay for the detection of H5
   North American lineage. The present assay was designed to circumvent the
   challenge that these viruses represent for the specific detection of H5
   subtype AI viruses. This RRT-PCR assay successfully detected a range of
   different H5 subtype AI strains from both Eurasian and North American
   lineages representing different avian H5 HA clades from diverse
   geographical locations. The sensitivity of the present method was
   determined by using in vitro-transcribed RNA and 10-fold serial
   dilutions of titrated AI viruses. High sensitivity levels were obtained,
   with limits of detection of 10(0) 50\% egg infectious dose (EID50)/mL
   and 4.2 gene copies/mu l. The linear ranges of the assay span within
   10(6)-10(0) EID50/mL and 10(6)-10(0) gene copies/mu l. The results
   obtained from this method were directly compared with those of the H5
   RRT-PCR assay recommended by the OIE. The comparison was performed with
   110 tracheal and cloacal swabs from various bird species collected
   during field and laboratory investigations in Eurasia and Africa in 2006
   and 2008 and showed 100\% agreement. This assay is recommended as an
   alternative method, also allowing a `double check' approach detection,
   to be use mainly in outbreak scenarios with higher risk of poultry
   infections by Central American/Caribbean H5 AI viruses. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Background: Sand flies are the only biologically adapted vectors of
   Leishmania parasites, however, a possible role in the transmission of
   Leishmania has been proposed for other hematophagous ectoparasites such
   as ticks. In order to evaluate natural infection by Leishmania infantum
   in Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks, taking into account its close
   association with dogs, 128 adult R. sanguineus ticks removed from 41
   dogs living in endemic areas of canine leishmaniosis were studied.
   Methods: Individual DNA extraction was performed from each tick and
   whole blood taken from dogs. Dog sera were tested for IgG antibodies to
   L. infantum antigen by ELISA and L. infantum real-time PCR was performed
   from canine whole blood samples and ticks.
   Results: Leishmania infantum PCR was positive in 13 ticks (10.1\%)
   including one female, (2.0\%) and 12 males (15.2\%), and in only five
   dogs (12.2\%). Male ticks had a significantly higher infection rate when
   compared to female R. sanguineus. The percentage of L. infantum
   seroreactive dogs was 19.5\%. All but two PCR positive dogs were
   seroreactive. Leishmania infantum PCR positive ticks were removed from
   seropositive and seronegative dogs with a variety of PCR results.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates high prevalence of L. infantum DNA
   in R. sanguineus ticks removed from L. infantum seropositive and
   seronegative dogs. The presence of L. infantum DNA was detected mainly
   in male ticks possibly due to their ability to move between canine hosts
   and feed on several canine hosts during the adult life stage. Additional
   studies are needed to further explore the role of R. sanguineus ticks
   and in particular, male adults, in both the epidemiology and immunology
   of L. infantum infection in dogs in endemic areas.}},

Abstract = {{Clostridium botulinum types C and D, as well as their mosaic variants

   study reports on the development of low-density macroarrays based on the
   GeneDisc cycler platform (Pall-Gene-Disc Technologies) applied to the
   simultaneous detection of the C. botulinum subtypes C, C-D, D, and D-C.
   The limit of detection of the PCR assays was 38 fg of total DNA,
   corresponding to 15 genome copies. Artificially contaminated samples of
   cecum showed a limit of detection below 50 spores/g. The tests were
   performed with a large variety of bacterial strains, including C.
   botulinum types C (n = 12), C-D (n = 29), D (n = 5), and D-C (n = 10),
   other botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT)-producing Clostridium strains (n =
   20), non-BoNT-producing clostridia (n = 20), and other bacterial species
   (n = 23), and showed a high specificity. These PCR assays were compared
   to previously published real-time PCRs for the detection of C. botulinum
   in 292 samples collected from cases of botulism events in four European
   regions. The majority of the samples originated from wild birds (n =
   108), poultry (n = 60), and bovines (n = 56). Among the 292 samples, 144
   were positive for either the bont/C-D or the bont/D-C gene by using the
   GeneDisc arrays. The reliability of the results tallied to 97.94\%.
   Interestingly, only BoNT mosaics, types C-D and D-C, were found in
   naturally contaminated samples whatever their animal origin and their
   geographical location. Further investigations should now be performed in
   order to check that mosaic types dominate in Europe and that acquisition
   of mosaic types helps in survival or adaptation to particular niche.}},

   Pathogenicity Avian Influenza Infections}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 24}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, the early detection of low pathogenicity avian
   influenza (LPAI) viruses in poultry has become increasingly important,
   given their potential to mutate into highly pathogenic viruses. However,
   evaluations of LPAI surveillance have mainly focused on prevalence and
   not on the ability to act as an early warning system. We used a
   simulation model based on data from Italian LPAI epidemics in turkeys to
   evaluate different surveillance strategies in terms of their performance
   as early warning systems. The strategies differed in terms of sample
   size, sampling frequency, diagnostic tests, and whether or not active
   surveillance (i.e., routine laboratory testing of farms) was performed,
   and were also tested under different epidemiological scenarios. We
   compared surveillance strategies by simulating within-farm outbreaks.
   The output measures were the proportion of infected farms that are
   detected and the farm reproduction number (Rh). The first one provides
   an indication of the sensitivity of the surveillance system to detect
   within-farm infections, whereas Rh reflects the effectiveness of
   outbreak detection (i.e., if detection occurs soon enough to bring an
   epidemic under control). Increasing the sampling frequency was the most
   effective means of improving the timeliness of detection (i.e., it
   occurs earlier), whereas increasing the sample size increased the
   likelihood of detection. Surveillance was only effective in preventing
   an epidemic if actions were taken within two days of sampling. The
   strategies were not affected by the quality of the diagnostic test,
   although performing both serological and virological assays increased
   the sensitivity of active surveillance. Early detection of LPAI
   outbreaks in turkeys can be achieved by increasing the sampling
   frequency for active surveillance, though very frequent sampling may not
   be sustainable in the long term. We suggest that, when no LPAI virus is
   circulating yet and there is a low risk of virus introduction, a less
   frequent sampling approach might be admitted, provided that the
   surveillance is intensified as soon as the first outbreak is detected.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Dirofilaria immitis and Dirofilaria repens are transmitted
   by bloodsucking culicid mosquitoes belonging to Culex, Aedes,
   Ochlerotatus, Anopheles and Mansonia genera.
   The detection of filarioids in mosquitoes for assessing distribution of
   vectors and/or of pathogens in a given area (also known as
   ``xenomonitoring{''}), when based on individual dissection of
   wild-caught female mosquitoes is time consuming and hardly applicable in
   large epidemiological surveys. Our study aimed to evaluate the recently
   developed duplex real-time PCR for screening large number of culicids
   and to assess their positivity for D. immitis and D. repens in an area
   where both species are endemic.
   Methods: A duplex real-time PCR was used to detect and differentiate D.
   immitis and D. repens in mosquitoes collected in six provinces of the
   Veneto region using 43 carbon dioxide-baited traps under the frame of an
   entomological surveillance program to monitor the vectors of West Nile
   disease. From early May till October 2010, unfed female mosquitoes (n =
   40,892) were captured in 20 selected sites.
   Results: Mosquitoes identified as Culex pipiens, Ochlerotatus caspius,
   Aedes vexans and Culex modestus were grouped into 995 pools according to
   species, day and site of collection (from minimum of 1 to maximum of
   57). Out of 955 pools, 23 (2.41 \%) scored positive for Dirofilaria spp.
   of which, 21 (2.2 \%) for D. immitis and two (0.21 \%) for D. repens. An
   overall Estimated Rate of Infection (ERI) of 0.06 \% was recorded, being
   higher in Och. caspius and Ae. vexans (i.e., 0.18 \% and 0.14 \%,
   respectively). At least one mosquito pool was positive for Dirofilaria
   spp. in each province with the highest ERI recorded in Vicenza and
   Padova provinces (i.e., 0.42\% and 0.16 \%, respectively). Mosquitoes
   collected in all provinces were positive for D. immitis whereas, only
   two (i.e., Padova and Rovigo) provinces scored positive for D. repens.
   All mosquito species, except for Cx. modestus, were positive for D.
   immitis, whereas D. repens was only found in Cx. pipiens.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that both Dirofilaria species are
   endemic and may occur in sympatry in the examined area. The molecular
   approach herein used represents a powerful tool for surveillance
   programs of D. immitis and D. repens in the culicid vectors towards a
   better understanding of the epidemiology of the infections they cause
   and their seasonal transmission patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Influenza viruses of gallinaceous poultry and wild aquatic birds usually
   have distinguishable receptor-binding properties. Here we used a panel
   of synthetic sialylglycopolymers and solid-phase receptor-binding assays
   to characterize receptor-binding profiles of about 70 H7 influenza
   viruses isolated from aquatic birds, land-based poultry, and horses in
   Eurasia and America. Unlike typical duck influenza viruses with non-H7
   hemagglutinin (HA), all avian H7 influenza viruses, irrespective of the
   host species, displayed a poultry-virus-like binding specificity, i.e.,
   preferential binding to sulfated oligosaccharides Neu5Ac alpha 2-3Gal
   beta 1-4(6-O-HSO3)GlcNAc and Neu5Ac alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4(Fuc alpha
   1-3)(6-O-HSO3)GlcNAc. This phenotype correlated with the unique amino
   acid sequence of the amino acid 185 to 189 loop of H7 HA and seemed to
   be dependent on ionic interactions between the sulfate group of the
   receptor and Lys193 and on the lack of sterical clashes between the
   fucose residue and Gln222. Many North American and Eurasian H7 influenza
   viruses displayed weak but detectable binding to the human-type receptor
   moiety Neu5Ac alpha 2-6Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc, highlighting the potential of
   H7 influenza viruses for avian-to-human transmission. Equine H7
   influenza viruses differed from other viruses by preferential binding to
   the N-glycolyl form of sialic acid. Our data suggest that the
   receptor-binding site of contemporary H7 influenza viruses in aquatic
   and terrestrial birds was formed after the introduction of their common
   precursor from ducks to a new host, presumably, gallinaceous poultry.
   The uniformity of the receptor-binding profile of H7 influenza viruses
   in various wild and domestic birds indicates that there is no strong
   receptor-mediated host range restriction in birds on viruses with this
   HA subtype. This notion agrees with repeated interspecies transmission
   of H7 influenza viruses from aquatic birds to poultry.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: Eating raw or insufficiently cooked bivalve molluscs contaminated
   with human noroviruses (NVs) can result in acute cases of
   gastroenteritis in humans. Manila clams (Ruditapes philippinarum) are
   particularly prone to exposure to NVs due to the brackish environment in
   which they are farmed which is known to be susceptible to human faecal
   contamination. High hydrostatic pressure processing (HHP) is a food
   treatment technique that has been shown to inactivate NV.
   Methods and results: In this study we investigated the ability of HHP to
   inactivate murine norovirus (MNV-1), a recognised surrogate for NV, in
   experimentally contaminated manila clams. Pools of contaminated live
   clams were subjected to hydrostatic pressure ranging from 300 to 500 MPa
   for different time intervals of between one and 10 min. The trial was
   repeated three times, at monthly intervals.
   Conclusions: Virus vitality post-treatment was assessed and the data
   obtained indicates that the use of high hydrostatic pressures of at
   least 500 MPa for 1 min was effective in inactivating MNV-1.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: HHP results to be an effective
   technique that could be applied to industrial process to obtain safe
   Manila clams ready to eat.}},

Abstract = {{Following a resurgence of fox rabies in northeastern Italy in 2008-2009,
   two emergency oral rabies vaccination (ORV) campaigns were performed in
   the Alpine mountain ranges in 2009 and 2010 using aerial distribution to
   prevent the disease from spreading further inland. Vaccine baits were
   distributed only below the freezing point altitude, 1000 m above sea
   level (a.s.l.) in December 2009-January 2010 and 1500 m a.s.l. in
   April-May 2010, to avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Spatial analysis
   unexpectedly identified fox rabies hotspots above the threshold
   altitudes, probably representing local residual rabies foci which may
   have contributed to maintaining the infectious cycle in areas not
   vaccinated at higher altitudes. Based on the results obtained, in May
   2010, the second ORV campaign was extended to include threshold
   altitudes of up to 2300 m a.s.l. to eliminate residual foci. The
   observations made may help in the formulation of ORV strategies in
   countries sharing similar topographical features.}},

Title = {{Occurrence and identification of risk areas of Ixodes ricinus-borne
   pathogens: a cost-effectiveness analysis in north-eastern Italy}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Ixodes ricinus, a competent vector of several pathogens, is
   the tick species most frequently reported to bite humans in Europe. The
   majority of human cases of Lyme borreliosis (LB) and tick-borne
   encephalitis (TBE) occur in the north-eastern region of Italy. The aims
   of this study were to detect the occurrence of endemic and emergent
   pathogens in north-eastern Italy using adult tick screening, and to
   identify areas at risk of pathogen transmission. Based on our results,
   different strategies for tick collection and pathogen screening and
   their relative costs were evaluated and discussed.
   Methods: From 2006 to 2008 adult ticks were collected in 31 sites and
   molecularly screened for the detection of pathogens previously reported
   in the same area (i.e., LB agents, TBE virus, Anaplasma phagocytophilum,
   Rickettsia spp., Babesia spp., ``Candidatus Neoehrlichia
   mikurensis{''}). Based on the results of this survey, three sampling
   strategies were evaluated a-posteriori, and the impact of each strategy
   on the final results and the overall cost reductions were analyzed. The
   strategies were as follows: tick collection throughout the year and
   testing of female ticks only (strategy A); collection from April to June
   and testing of all adult ticks (strategy B); collection from April to
   June and testing of female ticks only (strategy C).
   Results: Eleven pathogens were detected in 77 out of 193 ticks collected
   in 14 sites. The most common microorganisms detected were Borrelia
   burgdorferi sensu lato (17.6\%), Rickettsia helvetica (13.1\%), and
   ``Ca. N. mikurensis{''} (10.5\%). Within the B. burgdorferi complex,
   four genotypes (i.e., B. valaisiana, B. garinii, B. afzelii, and B.
   burgdorferi sensu stricto) were found. Less prevalent pathogens included
   R. monacensis (3.7\%), TBE virus (2.1\%), A. phagocytophilum (1.5\%),
   Bartonella spp. (1\%), and Babesia EU1 (0.5\%). Co-infections by more
   than one pathogen were diagnosed in 22\% of infected ticks. The
   prevalences of infection assessed using the three alternative strategies
   were in accordance with the initial results, with 13, 11, and 10 out of
   14 sites showing occurrence of at least one pathogen, respectively. The
   strategies A, B, and C proposed herein would allow to reduce the
   original costs of sampling and laboratory analyses by one third, half,
   and two thirds, respectively. Strategy B was demonstrated to represent
   the most cost-effective choice, offering a substantial reduction of
   costs, as well as reliable results.
   Conclusions: Monitoring of tick-borne diseases is expensive,
   particularly in areas where several zoonotic pathogens co-occur.
   Cost-effectiveness studies can support the choice of the best monitoring
   strategy, which should take into account the ecology of the area under
   investigation, as well as the available budget.}},

Abstract = {{Despite considerable effort for surveillance of wild birds for avian
   influenza viruses (AIVs), empirical investigations of ecological drivers
   of AIV prevalence in wild birds are still scarce. Here we used a
   continental-scale dataset, collected in tropical wetlands of 15 African
   countries, to test the relative roles of a range of ecological factors
   on patterns of AIV prevalence in wildfowl. Seasonal and geographical
   variations in prevalence were positively related to the local density of
   the wildfowl community and to the wintering period of Eurasian migratory
   birds in Africa. The predominant influence of wildfowl density with no
   influence of climatic conditions suggests, in contrast to temperate
   regions, a predominant role for inter-individual transmission rather
   than transmission via long-lived virus persisting in the environment.
   Higher prevalences were found in Anas species than in non-Anas species
   even when we account for differences in their foraging behaviour
   (primarily dabbling or not) or their geographical origin (Eurasian or
   Afro-tropical), suggesting the existence of intrinsic differences
   between wildfowl taxonomic groups in receptivity to infection. Birds
   were found infected as often in oropharyngeal as in cloacal samples, but
   rarely for both types of sample concurrently, indicating that both
   respiratory and digestive tracts may be important for AIV replication.}},

Title = {{Vector-Borne Diseases - constant challenge for practicing veterinarians:
   recommendations from the CVBD World Forum}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR 20}},
Abstract = {{The human-animal bond has been a fundamental feature of mankind's
   history for millennia. The first, and strongest of these, man's
   relationship with the dog, is believed to pre-date even agriculture,
   going back as far as 30,000 years. It remains at least as powerful
   today. Fed by the changing nature of the interactions between people and
   their dogs worldwide and the increasing tendency towards close
   domesticity, the health of dogs has never played a more important role
   in family life. Thanks to developments in scientific understanding and
   diagnostic techniques, as well as changing priorities of pet owners,
   veterinarians are now able, and indeed expected, to play a fundamental
   role in the prevention and treatment of canine disease, including canine
   vector-borne diseases (CVBDs).
   The CVBDs represent a varied and complex group of diseases, including
   anaplasmosis, babesiosis, bartonellosis, borreliosis, dirofilariosis,
   ehrlichiosis, leishmaniosis, rickettsiosis and thelaziosis, with new
   syndromes being uncovered every year. Many of these diseases can cause
   serious, even life-threatening clinical conditions in dogs, with a
   number having zoonotic potential, affecting the human population.
   Today, CVBDs pose a growing global threat as they continue their spread
   far from their traditional geographical and temporal restraints as a
   result of changes in both climatic conditions and pet dog travel
   patterns, exposing new populations to previously unknown infectious
   agents and posing unprecedented challenges to veterinarians. In response
   to this growing threat, the CVBD World Forum, a multidisciplinary group
   of experts in CVBDs from around the world which meets on an annual
   basis, gathered in Nice (France) in 2011 to share the latest research on
   CVBDs and discuss the best approaches to managing these diseases around
   the world.
   As a result of these discussions, we, the members of the CVBD Forum have
   developed the following recommendations to veterinarians for the
   management of CVBDs.}},

Abstract = {{Evidences of oseltamivir resistant influenza patients raised the need of
   novel neuraminidase inhibitors. In this study, five oseltamivir analogs
   PMC-31-PMC-36, synthesised according to the outcomes of a rational
   design analysis aimed to investigate the effects of substitution at the
   5-amino and 4-amido groups of oseltamivir on its antiviral activity,
   were screened for their inhibition against neuraminidase N1 and N3. The
   enzymes used as models were from the avian influenza A H7N1 and H7N3
   viruses. The neuraminidase inhibition assay was carried out by using
   recombinant species obtained from a baculovirus expression system and
   the fluorogenic substrate MUNANA. The assay was validated by using
   oseltamivir carboxylate as a reference inhibitor. Among the tested
   compounds, PMC-36 showed the highest inhibition on N1 with an IC50 of
   14.6 +/- 3.0 nM (oseltamivir 25 +/- 4 nM), while PMC-35 showed a
   significant inhibitory effect on N3 with an IC50 of 0.1 +/- 0.03 nM
   (oseltamivir 0.2 +/- 0.02 nM). The analysis of the inhibitory properties
   of this panel of compounds allowed a preliminary assessment of a
   structure-activity relationship for the modification of the 4-amido and
   5-amino groups of oseltamivir carboxylate. The substitution of the
   acetamido group in the oseltamivir structure with a 2-butenylamido
   moiety reduced the observed activity, while the introduction of a
   propenylamido group was well tolerated. Substitution of the free 5-amino
   group of oseltamivir carboxylate with an azide, decreased the activity
   against both N1 and N3. When these structural changes were both
   introduced, a dramatic reduction of activity was observed for both N1
   and N3. The alkylation of the free 5-amino group in oseltamivir
   carboxylate introducing an isopropyl group seemed to increase the
   inhibitory effect for both N1 and N3 neuraminidases, displaying a more
   pronounced effect against N1. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Salmonella is one of the most common pathogens in the European Union
   which can spread in the domestic environment due to incorrect food
   handling practices. This study has investigated the efficacy of the
   Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to uncover the processes that lead to
   the formation of the intentions and thus to a specific behavior, i.e.
   consuming meat and fresh sausages only if well cooked. Two parallel
   longitudinal studies comprising Italian young adults and adults were
   carried out. In a two week period, participants were administered two
   questionnaires measuring behavioral intentions and their antecedents in
   the first wave, and self-reported behavior toward the target behavior in
   the second one.
   Results showed the superior predictive power of the TPB plus past
   behavior. From a cognitive perspective, the samples differed: the actual
   behavior of young adults derives from intentions and perceived control,
   whereas the behavior of adults depends only on past behavior. Findings
   suggest that food risk-communication should consider the differences in
   behavior models. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   data provided by the National Infectious Diseases Notification System
   (SIMI) and the National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT), in order to
   provide additional information about the epidemiology of these diseases

   regional systems showed a significant increase in notification rates of
   non-typhoid salmonellosis and infectious diarrhoea other than
   non-typhoid salmonellosis, but for food-borne disease outbreaks, the
   increase was not statistically significant. Although the two regional
   systems have different objectives and structures, they showed improved
   sensitivity regarding notification of cases of acute infectious

Volume = {{67}},

Abstract = {{Aim. The aim of this study was to analyze factors influencing outcomes
   of surgical management for lower limb acute ischemia.
   Methods. A retrospective analysis of 490 thromboembolectomies performed
   in 468 patients was conducted. Perioperative and follow-up results were
   analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analysis of clinical variables and
   patients' characteristics for the risk of reocclusion, amputation and
   mortality at 2 years were performed. Statistical significance was
   defined as a P value <0.05.
   Results. Cumulative reocclusion, amputation and mortality rates at 24
   months were 22.6\%, 14.3\% and 42.8\%, respectively. At univariate
   analysis, the factors associated with increased 2-year reocclusion rate
   were severity of clinical presentation, current smoking habit, arterial
   thrombosis rather than embolism, atrial fibrillation and the avoidance
   of completion angiography. All these factors except clinical
   presentation maintained significance at multivariate analysis. Factors
   associated with increased 2-year amputation rate at univariate analysis
   included severity of clinical presentation, smoke, arterial thrombosis,
   atrial fibrillation and valvulopathy. All these factors except clinical
   presentation and valvular defects maintained significance at
   multivariate analysis. Factors associated with increased 2-year
   mortality rate at univariate analysis included age >80 years, arterial
   thrombosis, history of peripheral arterial disease and antiplatelet
   drugs. The same factors, except antiplatelet treatment, were found to be
   significant at multi-variate analysis.
   Conclusion. Surgical intervention for lower limb ischemia is associated
   with high 2-year mortality but offers good 2-year limb salvage. The
   pattern of risk factors for reocclusion and amputation rates is quite
   different from those affecting mortality. Only thrombotic aetiology is a
   significant risk factor for all the three outcomes.}},

   positively and more negatively. Second, intentions to eat raw or rare
   meat were weaker in those who read the prevention message compared with

   Objective: Validate the use of recombinant neuraminidase expressed in

   Materials and methods: Recombinant baculovirus particles displaying
   neuraminidase N1 and N3 were used as enzyme sources. The assay set-up
   required the use of 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-D-acetyl neuraminic

   10\%. The 50\% inhibitory concentration values of the inhibitor were in
   good agreement with those determined by independent kinetic experiments.

Abstract = {{Aims: To predict the risk of incursion of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic
   fever virus (CCHFV) in livestock in Europe introduced through immature
   Hyalomma marginatum ticks on migratory birds under current conditions
   and in the decade 20752084 under a climate-change scenario. Methods and
   Results: A spatial risk map of Europe comprising 14 282 grid cells (25 x
   25 km) was constructed using three data sources: (i) ranges and
   abundances of four species of bird which migrate from sub-Saharan Africa
   to Europe each spring, namely Willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus),
   Northern wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe), Tree pipit (Anthus trivialis) and
   Common quail (Coturnix coturnix); (ii) UK Met Office HadRM3 spring
   temperatures for prediction of moulting success of immature H.
   marginatum ticks and (iii) livestock densities. On average, the number
   of grid cells in Europe predicted to have at least one CCHFV incursion
   in livestock in spring was 1 04 per year for the decade 2005-2014 and 1
   03 per year for the decade 2075-2084. In general with the assumed
   climate-change scenario, the risk increased in northern Europe but
   decreased in central and southern Europe, although there is considerable
   local variation in the trends. Conclusions: The absolute risk of
   incursion of CCHFV in livestock through ticks introduced by four
   abundant species of migratory bird (totalling 120 million individual
   birds) is very low. Climate change has opposing effects, increasing the
   success of the moult of the nymphal ticks into adults but decreasing the
   projected abundance of birds by 34\% in this model. Significance and
   Impact of the Study: For Europe, climate change is not predicted to
   increase the overall risk of incursion of CCHFV in livestock through
   infected ticks introduced by these four migratory bird species.}},

   transmission, experimental infections were carried out in turkeys and
   guinea fowl with two genetically distinct avian astroviruses, namely
   TK-6363 and GF-5497, originating respectively from diseased turkey
   poults and guinea fowl. Data obtained in our study show that both of the
   viruses selected were able to infect young birds of the species in which
   they were originally detected. Additionally, these viruses were able to
   infect young birds of different species causing clinical signs, thus
   providing experimental evidence for the infection of distinct avian
   astroviruses in different avian species.}},

   effects on dry matter intake, milk yield, milk quality traits, milk

   mid-lactating Holstein Friesian cows were assigned to one of two
   experimental groups and fed according to cross-over design (2 diets x 2
   periods). Diets were isoenergetic, isofibrous and isonitrogenous and had
   the same content of choline. Dry matter intake, milk yield and the 3.5\%
   fat-corrected milk (FCM) were not affected by the diet. The milk choline
   content and the milk quality did not differ between treatments, with the
   exception of milk fat (P<0.05) and urea (P<0.01), which resulted lower
   for the L-group. Milk fat, protein and choline yields remained
   unaffected. With regard to the haematological profile, all of the
   parameters fell within the physiological range of lactating dairy cows,
   and the only difference was represented by the lower urea level of the L
   fed cows (P<0.01), that could be explained by a better N metabolic
   efficiency. Results indicated that soy lecithins can be used as an
   available source of choline in mid-lactating dairy cows.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate the variations of vitamin B12
   and homocysteine in blood of dairy cows during subacute ruminal acidosis
   (SARA). On 228 subjects ruminal liquid was collected through
   rumenocentesis technique and rumen pH was immediately measured by a
   portable pH-meter. On the basis of pH values all cows were classified
   (bovine class) in Group A (animals with rumen pH>5.7), Group B (animals
   with rumen pH between 5.6 and 5.7) and Group C (animals with rumen
   pH<5.6). In relation to the acidosis risk depending on the rumen pH
   (herd class), the herds were classified in Group 1 (normal herds: less
   than 33\% cows with rumen pH<5.8), Group 2 (critical herds: more than
   33\% cows with rumen pH between 5.5 and 5.8) and Group 3 (acidosis
   herds: more than 33\% cows with rumen pH<5.5). On blood samples,
   collected by jugular venipuncture, vitamin B12 and homocysteine were
   measured by chemiluminescent immunological tests. One-way analysis of
   variance (ANOVA), followed by Bonferroni test, showed significant
   differences (P<0.05) for vitamin B12 in bovine class and significant
   differences (P<0.05) for homocysteine in herd class. The influence of
   rumen pH values resulted in adequate vitamin B12 and homocysteine levels
   to meet microbial and cow requirements and fatty acids modifications in
   dairy cows affected by SARA. Moreover, the increase of vitamin B12 could
   be due to the presence of analogues which interfere with the transport
   of the vitamin. These findings provide more information on blood
   modifications during SARA.}},

Abstract = {{Cutaneous mast cell tumors (MCTs) are among the most common neoplasms in
   dogs and show a highly variable biologic behavior. Histological grading,
   cell proliferation markers, and KIT immunohistochemistry are typically
   used to predict post-surgical prognosis. In the present study, c-KIT
   messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was measured in canine MCTs and its
   relationship with tumor grade, immunohistochemical staining pattern,
   post-surgical prognosis, and mutations was investigated. A significant
   increase of c-KIT mRNA was observed in MCTs versus healthy skin and
   surgical margins. Mutations were observed in 8.3\% of cases. The KIT
   staining pattern was investigated for both grading systems. In
   particular, staining pattern III was associated with grade II (G2) and
   G3 MCTs, while staining patterns I and II were associated with G1 and G2
   MCTs. Considering the 2-tier histological grading, the high grade was
   mainly associated with pattern III (71\%) while the low grade was
   associated with patterns II (70\%) and I (28\%). A weak association
   between the KIT staining pattern and outcome was also observed. The
   results obtained suggest that c-KIT mRNA is overexpressed in canine MCT,
   although the fold variations were not associated with the protein
   localization or complementary DNA mutations. These observations
   suggested that the 3 events were independent. The histological grading
   and the KIT staining pattern have prognostic value as previously
   published. Staining pattern I could be especially helpful in predicting
   a good prognosis of G2 MCTs. Sequence mutations were not necessarily
   suggestive of a worse prognosis, but might be useful in choosing a
   chemotherapy protocol.}},

Abstract = {{Viral encephalopathy and retinopathy (VER) is one of the most
   devastating diseases for marine aquaculture, and similarly represents a
   threat to wild fish populations because of its high infectivity and
   broad host range. Betanodavirus, the causative agent of VER, is a small
   non-enveloped virus with a bipartite RNA genome comprising the RNA1 and
   RNA2 segments. We partially sequenced both RNA1 and RNA2 from 120 viral
   strains isolated from 2000 to 2009 in six different countries in
   Southern Europe. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of the
   red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) (n = 96) and striped
   jack nervous necrosis virus (SJNNV) (n = 1) genotypes in Southern
   Europe, with 23/120 samples classified as RGNNV/SJNNV reassortants.
   Viruses sampled from individual countries tended to cluster together
   suggesting a major geographic subdivision among betanodaviruses,
   although some phylogenetic evidence for viral gene flow was also
   obtained. Rates of nucleotide substitution were similar to those
   observed in a broad array of RNA viruses, and revealed a significantly
   higher evolutionary rate in the polymerase compared to the coat protein
   gene. This may reflect temperature adaptation of betanodaviruses,
   although a site-specific analysis of selection pressures identified
   relatively few selected sites in either gene. Overall, our analyses
   yielded novel data on the evolutionary dynamics and phylogeography of
   betanodaviruses and therein provides a more complete understanding of
   the distribution and evolution of different genotypes in Southern
   Europe. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In 2008 the COLOSS network was formed by honey bee experts from Europe
   and the USA. The primary objectives set by this scientific network were
   to explain and to prevent large scale losses of honey bee (Apis
   mellifera) colonies. In June 2008 COLOSS obtained four years support
   from the European Union from COST and was designated as COST Action
   FA0803 - COLOSS (Prevention of honey bee COlony LOSSes). To enable the
   comparison of loss data between participating countries, a standardized
   COLOSS questionnaire was developed. Using this questionnaire information
   on honey bee losses has been collected over two years. Survey data
   presented in this study were gathered in 2009 from 12 countries and in
   2010 from 24 countries. Mean honey bee losses in Europe varied widely,
   between 7-22\% over the 2008-9 winter and between 7-30\% over the
   2009-10 winter. An important finding is that for all countries which
   participated in 2008-9, winter losses in 2009-10 were found to be
   substantially higher. In 2009-10, winter losses in South East Europe
   were at such a low level that the factors causing the losses in other
   parts of Europe were absent, or at a level which did not affect colony
   survival. The five provinces of China, which were included in 2009-10,
   showed very low mean (4\%) A. mellifera winter losses. In six Canadian
   provinces, mean winter losses in 2010 varied between 16-25\%, losses in
   Nova Scotia (40\%) being exceptionally high. In most countries and in
   both monitoring years, hobbyist beekeepers (1-50 colonies) experienced
   higher losses than practitioners with intermediate beekeeping operations
   (51-500 colonies). This relationship between scale of beekeeping and
   extent of losses effect was also observed in 2009-10, but was less
   pronounced. In Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Poland, 2008-9 mean
   winter losses for beekeepers who reported `disappeared' colonies were
   significantly higher compared to mean winter losses of beekeepers who
   did not report `disappeared' colonies. Mean 2008-9 winter losses for
   those beekeepers in the Netherlands who reported symptoms similar to
   ``Colony Collapse Disorder{''} (CCD), namely: 1. no dead bees in or
   surrounding the hive while; 2. capped brood was present, were
   significantly higher than mean winter losses for those beekeepers who
   reported `disappeared' colonies without the presence of capped brood in
   the empty hives. In the winter of 2009-10 in the majority of
   participating countries, beekeepers who reported `disappeared' colonies
   experienced higher winter losses compared with beekeepers, who
   experienced winter losses but did not report `disappeared' colonies.}},

   disease vectors, is of increasing relevance for human and animal health
   in Europe. The aim of this study was to determine the relative
   contribution of several abiotic and biotic factors potentially affecting
   questing activity and local abundance of I. ricinus in Italy,
   considering the scale at which these factors interact with the
   host-seeking ticks. Within EDEN, a large-scale EU collaborative project
   on eco-epidemiology of vector-borne diseases, we collected questing
   ticks for three consecutive years using a standard protocol at eleven
   sites in the Italian Alps and Apennines. A total of 25 447 I. ricinus
   were collected. All sites showed the same annual pattern of tick
   activity (bimodal for nymphs and unimodal for larvae and adults),
   although the abundance of nymphs was statistically different between
   sites and years. A Generalized Linear Mixed Model and a Linear Mixed
   Model fitted to data for nymphs, showed that while the principal
   variables affecting the local abundance of questing ticks were
   saturation deficit (an index combining temperature and relative
   humidity) and red deer density, the most important variable affecting
   questing nymph activity was saturation deficit. As for the timing of
   seasonal emergence, we confirmed that the threshold temperature at this
   latitude for larvae is 10 degrees C (mean maximum) while that for nymphs
   is 8 degrees C. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 (clade 2.2) was introduced
   into Egypt in early 2006. Despite the control measures taken, including
   mass vaccination of poultry, the virus rapidly spread among commercial
   and backyard flocks. Since the initial outbreaks, the virus in Egypt has
   evolved into a third order clade (clade 2.2.1) and diverged into
   antigenically and genetically distinct subclades. To better understand
   the dynamics of HPAI H5N1 evolution in countries that differ in
   vaccination policy, we undertook an in-depth analysis of those virus
   strains circulating in Egypt between 2006 and 2010, and compared
   countries where vaccination was adopted (Egypt and Indonesia) to those
   where it was not (Nigeria, Turkey and Thailand). This study incorporated
   751 sequences (Egypt n = 309, Indonesia n = 149. Nigeria n = 106, Turkey
   n = 87, Thailand n = 100) of the complete haemagglutinin (HA) open
   reading frame, the major antigenic determinant of influenza A virus. Our
   analysis revealed that two main Egyptian subclades (termed A and B) have
   co-circulated in domestic poultry since late 2007 and exhibit different
   profiles of positively selected codons and rates of nucleotide
   substitution. The mean evolutionary rate of subclade A H5N1 viruses was
   4.07 x 10(-3) nucleotide substitutions per site, per year (HPD 95\%,
   3.23-4.91), whereas subclade B possessed a markedly higher substitution
   rate (8.87 x 10(-3); 95\% HPD 7.0-10.72 x 10(-3)) and a stronger
   signature of positive selection. Although the direct association between
   H5N1 vaccination and virus evolution is difficult to establish, we found
   evidence for a difference in the evolutionary dynamics of H5N1 viruses
   among countries where vaccination was or was not adopted. In particular,
   both evolutionary rates and the number of positively selected sites were
   higher in virus populations circulating in countries applying avian
   influenza vaccination for H5N1, compared to viruses circulating in
   countries which had never used vaccination. We therefore urge a greater
   consideration of the potential consequences of inadequate vaccination on
   viral evolution. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Non-structural 1 (NS1) protein of avian influenza (AI) viruses is
   important for pathogenicity. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized
   tandem PDZ-ligand (TPL) domain in the extreme carboxy terminus of NS1
   proteins from a subset of globally circulating AI viruses. By using
   protein arrays we have identified several human PDZ-cellular ligands of
   this novel domain, one of which is the RIL protein, a known regulator of
   the cellular tyrosine kinase Src. We found that the AI NS1 proteins bind
   and stimulate human Src tyrosine kinase, through their carboxy terminal
   Src homology type 3-binding (SHB) domain. The physical interaction
   between NS1 and Src and the ability of AI viruses to modulate the
   phosphorylation status of Src during the infection, were found to be
   influenced by the TPL arrangement. These results indicate the potential
   for novel host-pathogen interactions mediated by the TPL and SHB domains
   of AI NS1 protein.}},

   wildlife species retrieved in several localities of southern Italy and
   to assess the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Anaplasma

   carried out from January 2000 to December 2009 on wild animals found
   dead within the territories of 11 municipalities from three regions
   (i.e., Apulia, Basilicata, and Calabria). In total, 189 carcasses of
   wild animals belonging to 10 species were checked for tick infestation,
   and 40 animals belonging to seven species were found parasitized. One
   hundred and twenty-five ixodid ticks (11 larvae, 14 nymphs, 77 males,

   species, namely Dermacentor marginatus, Haemaphysalis erinacei, Hyalomma

   ricinus, Rhipicephalus bursa, and Rhipicephalus turanicus. None of the
   36 tick specimens tested by PCR was positive for tick-borne pathogens.
   The results add new information on the tick fauna associated with wild
   animals in Italy, reporting new tick-host associations. Further field
   studies are still needed to ascertain the suitability of certain
   wildlife species as hosts for some tick species, particularly for those
   implicated in the transmission of pathogens to domestic animals and
   humans. Finally, from a conservation perspective, it would be
   interesting to assess whether these wild animals (e.g., Lepus

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Calf dehorning is a routine husbandry practice on dairy farms that is
   justified by safety reasons for stockpersons and by a reduced risk of
   injures among herdmates. In Europe, the practice is regulated by law but
   little is known about the methods applied or about farmers' attitude to
   the practice. This study aimed to broaden the existing information on
   dehorning in dairy holdings by processing results of 639 farm
   questionnaires gathered in a traditional dairy area of northeastern
   Italy. Farm questionnaires were stratified according to herd size, type
   of housing, and productive purpose of the predominant reared breed(s).
   Chi-squared tests were performed to verify the significant association
   between a given practice or opinion and the 3 classification factors,
   and odd ratios were calculated. The outcomes of the study showed that
   dehorning was carried out on 80\% of the surveyed farms, and disbudding
   was the method reported by all the interviewed farmers. Hotiron
   cauterization was the preferred method for disbudding (91\%). On
   average, disbudding was performed at 32 d of age and it was more likely
   in farms with >= 60 cows than in smaller dairy holdings (OR = 7.3). The
   practice was carried out mainly by farm personnel, but the intervention
   of a veterinarian was far more likely (OR = 5.98) on farms with <= 30
   cows than on larger dairies. Most farmers (70\%) stated that they had
   not received any specific training on how to perform disbudding.
   Fifty-two percent of the respondents reported that disbudding causes
   prolonged postoperative pain (>= 6 h) but pain management was rare. Only
   10\% of the farmers used local anesthesia before cauterization, and 5\%
   of the farmers provided calves with postoperative analgesia. Consistent
   with these results, farmers indicated limited willingness to pay the
   cost of analgesia or to call a veterinarian to perform the procedure.
   This low motivation of the respondents toward the adoption of practices
   able to reduce pain related to disbudding might arise from their
   insufficient knowledge on long-term negative effects of early painful
   experiences on behavior and handling of dairy heifers. Farmers in favor
   of keeping horned cows were asked about the reasons for not carrying out
   dehorning. Aesthetic motivations (54\% of respondents) and lack of time
   (24\%) were the main reasons cited. Moreover, a large majority of these
   respondents (74\%) reported no difficulty in handling horned cattle.}},

Title = {{Transmission Dynamics of Low Pathogenicity Avian Influenza Infections in
   Turkey Flocks}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{Low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses of H5 and H7 subtypes
   have the potential to mutate into highly pathogenic strains (HPAI),
   which can threaten human health and cause huge economic losses. The
   current knowledge on the mechanisms of mutation from LPAI to HPAI is
   insufficient for predicting which H5 or H7 strains will mutate into an
   HPAI strain, and since the molecular changes necessary for the change in
   virulence seemingly occur at random, the probability of mutation depends
   on the number of virus replicates, which is associated with the number
   of birds that acquire infection. We estimated the transmission dynamics
   of LPAI viruses in turkeys using serosurveillance data from past
   epidemics in Italy. We fitted the proportions of birds infected in 36
   flocks into a hierarchical model to estimate the basic reproduction
   number (R(0)) and possible variations in R0 among flocks caused by
   differences among farms. We also estimated the distributions of the
   latent and infectious periods, using experimental infection data with
   outbreak strains. These were then combined with the R0 to simulate LPAI
   outbreaks and characterise the resulting dynamics. The estimated mean
   within-flock R0 in the population of infected flocks was 5.5, indicating
   that an infectious bird would infect an average of more than five
   susceptible birds. The results also indicate that the presence of
   seropositive birds does not necessarily mean that the virus has already
   been cleared and the flock is no longer infective, so that seropositive
   flocks may still constitute a risk of infection for other flocks. In
   light of these results, the enforcement of appropriate restrictions, the
   culling of seropositive flocks, or pre-emptive slaughtering may be
   useful. The model and parameter estimates presented in this paper
   provide the first complete picture of LPAI dynamics in turkey flocks and
   could be used for designing a suitable surveillance program.}},

Abstract = {{Aim. The objectives were to review in our series the risk factors,
   management and outcomes of patients who sustained vascular injuries in
   the lower limbs and to determine the effect of risk factors and
   treatment on the outcome of the injured extremity.
   Methods. Fifty-six patients submitted to surgical treatment were
   retrospectively reviewed. Results were analysed in terms of type of
   operation and reconstruction, intraoperative and 30 day complications,
   reconstruction occlusion, major amputation and mortality.
   Results. The mechanism of trauma was blunt in 30.4\% and penetrating in
   69.6\%. The overall primary amputation rate was 5.4\%, the overall
   secondary amputation rate was 1.8\%. The overall intraoperative and
   postoperative mortality were 1.8\% and 5.4\% respectively. At univariate
   analys is, the presence of compartment syndrome and ischemia time >6
   hours were associated with a significantly higher risk of early
   reconstruction thrombosis (both P=0.03). It showed also that the number
   of patent vessels (P=0.0000) and the presence of a MESS score >7
   (P=0.0000) significantly affected primary amputation, and that the
   occurrence of postoperative deep wound infection or sepsis (P=0.0000),
   of tibio-peroneal trunk injury (P=0.003) and of a MESS score >7
   (P=0.004) significantly affected secondary amputation.
   Conclusion. The number of patent arteries (0-1), the presence of a MESS
   score >7, the incidence of tibio-peroneal trunk injury and the
   occurrence of postoperative deep wound infection are significant
   independent factors for limb loss. The presence of compartment syndrome
   and of ischemia time >6 hours are associated with a significantly higher
   risk of early reconstruction thrombosis.}},

Abstract = {{Histophilus somni is able to infect the genital tract of dairy cattle

   describes two outbreaks characterized by reproductive disorders in dairy

   abortion, reproductive failure or vaginal discharge has been
   investigated by means of bacteriological, serological and biomolecular
   techniques. Among the infectious agents investigated a significant
   association (P<0.001) between the positivity for H. somni and reduced
   fertility was observed, with higher prevalence of vaginal discharge and
   poor conception rate among infected animals.
   The second case-report describes the effectiveness of the therapeutic
   approach adopted by the veterinary, based on the execution of vaginal
   washings with an antibiotic solution containing gentamicin, lincomycin
   and spectinomycin, in cows with a muco-purulent vaginal discharge and
   the worsening of the reproductive performance due to H. somni

Abstract = {{The study aimed at comparing three strategies of supplementing selenium

   administration of sodium selenite throughout the finishing (NaSe); (2)
   administration of an Se-enriched yeast strain (Saccharomyces cerevisiae
   NCYC R397) throughout the finishing (Se-Y); (3) administration of sodium
   selenite for 140 days replaced by Se-enriched yeast during the last 70
   days of finishing (Switch). Eighty-four young bulls (mean initial BW =
   434.2 +/- 31.9 kg; mean age = 382 +/- 52 days) were stratified by live
   weight and equally assigned to one of three Se treatments. Experimental
   groups were fed the same diets and the inclusion rate of the different
   treatments was targeted to achieve 0.3 mg of Se/kg of dry matter (DM) in
   the complete feed. The average daily gain of bulls was 1.36 kg/d and no
   differences due to Se treatment were recorded. Dry matter intake and
   feed conversion ratio were not affected by Se treatment resulting in, on
   average, 10.3 kg/d and 7.65, respectively. Repeated blood samples were
   taken at days 0, 120, 180 and 210 of finishing to assess the Se status
   of the animals. As compared to NaSe, both organic Se treatments (Se-Y
   and Switch) increased plasma Se in the last two sampling sessions
   according to a significant treatment X time interaction (P < 0.001). A
   similar trend was observed for serum total antioxidant status of the
   young bulls, whereas there was only a significant time effect (P <
   0.001) on glutathione peroxidase activity that was raised by all Se
   treatments. The finishing period lasted 210 days and at the abattoir
   there were no differences across Se treatments in carcass weight and
   dressing percentage. A higher Se content in the Longissimus thoracis
   (LT) muscle was instead observed in Se-Y samples as compared with NaSe
   (0.85 v. 0.47mg/kg DM; P < 0.05). Meat quality evaluation was carried
   out on LT samples after 6 and 11 days of ageing under a vacuum package.
   Regardless of ageing time, meat from young bulls supplemented with Se
   yeast had higher colour lightness (L{*}) values than those receiving
   NaSe (38.1 v. 36.6; P < 0.01) and showed a significant decrease in shear
   force (3.69 v. 4.22 kg/cm(2); P < 0.01). The outcomes of the study
   suggest that the provision of Se yeast throughout the finishing period
   is a strategy to increase the benefits of the replacement of sodium
   selenite with organic selenium in beef cattle.}},

Abstract = {{Astroviruses are small, non-enveloped, positive sense, single-stranded
   RNA viruses first identified in 1975 in children suffering from diarrhea
   and then described in a wide variety of animals. To date, the list of
   animal species susceptible to astrovirus infection has expanded to 22
   animal species or families, including domestic, synantropic and wild
   animals, avian, and mammalian species in the terrestrial and aquatic
   environments. Astrovirus infections are considered among the most common
   cause of gastroenteritis in children, second only to rotavirus
   infections, but in animals their association with enteric diseases is
   not well documented, with the exception of turkey and mink astrovirus
   infection. Genetic variability has been described in almost all
   astrovirus species sufficiently examined infecting mammals and birds;
   however, antigenic variability has been demonstrated for human
   astroviruses but is far less investigated in animal viruses.
   Interestingly, there is an increasing evidence of recombination events
   occurring in astroviruses, which contributes to increase the genetic
   variability of this group of viruses. A wide variety of species
   infected, the evident virus genetic diversity and the occurrence of
   recombination events indicate or imply either cross-species transmission
   and subsequent virus adaptation to new hosts or the co-infection of the
   same host with different astroviruses. This can also favor the emergence
   of novel astroviruses infecting animals or with a zoonotic potential.
   After more than 30 years from their first description in humans, there
   are many exciting streams of research to be explored and intriguing
   questions that remain to be answered about the relatively under-studied
   Astroviridae family. In the present work, we will review the existing
   knowledge concerning astrovirus infections in humans and animals, with
   particular focus on the molecular biology, interspecies transmission and
   zoonotic potential of this group of viruses. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Paratuberculosis is a chronic granulomatous infection caused by
   Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) that affects multiple
   ruminant species causing important economic losses. Therefore, control
   programmes at herd and regional levels have been established worldwide
   and prevalence estimates are needed for their implementation. Although
   different herd-level prevalence estimations for paratuberculosis have
   been reported in Europe, very few studies provided comparable and
   interpretable values, due to poor study designs and lack of knowledge
   about the accuracy of the diagnostic tests used. To overcome these
   problems we applied a latent class analysis to the results of two
   prevalence studies carried out in two neighbouring Northern Italian
   regions (Lombardy and Veneto) that account for over 50\% of the Italian
   dairy cattle population. Serum samples from a randomly selected number
   of farms in the two regions were analyzed by different ELISA tests. The
   herd-level Apparent Prevalences (AP) were 48\% (190/391) for Lombardy
   and 65\% (272/419) for Veneto. Median within-herd APs were 2.6\% and
   4.0\% for Lombardy and Veneto, respectively. Posterior estimates for the
   herd-level True Prevalences (TP) based on a Bayesian model were very
   similar between the two regions (70\% for Lombardy and 71\% for Veneto)
   and close to previous estimates of infected herds in Europe. The two
   95\% credibility intervals overlap each other, virtually showing only
   one distribution of the herd-level true prevalence for both regions. On
   the contrary, estimates of the within-herd TP distributions differed
   between the two regions (mean values: 6.7\% for Lombardy and 14.3\% for
   Veneto), possibly due to the different age distribution within the herds
   from the two regions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{First report in italy of the exotic mosquito species Aedes (Finlaya)

Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Background: In the Veneto region (north-eastern Italy) an entomological
   surveillance system has been implemented since the introduction of the
   Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) in 1991. During the routine
   monitoring activity in a tiger mosquito-free area, an unexpected
   mosquito was noticed, which clearly did not belong to the recorded
   Italian fauna.
   Findings: At the end of May 2011, twelve larvae and pupae were collected
   in a small village in Belluno province (Veneto region) from a single
   manhole. Ten adults reared in the laboratory were morphologically and
   genetically identified as Aedes (Finlaya) koreicus (Edwards, 1917), a
   species native to Southeast Asia. The subsequent investigations carried
   out in the following months in the same village provided evidence that
   this species had become established locally. Entomological and
   epidemiological investigations are currently ongoing in the surrounding
   area, to verify the eventual extension of the species outside the
   village and to trace back the route of entry into Italy.
   Conclusions: This is the first report in Italy of the introduction of
   the exotic mosquito Ae. koreicus. This species has been shown
   experimentally to be competent in the transmission of the Japanese
   encephalitis virus and of the dog heartworm Dirofilaria immitis and is
   considered a potential vector of other arboviruses. Thus, the
   establishment of this species may increase the current risk or pose new
   potential threats, for human and animal health. This finding
   considerably complicates the entomological monitoring of the Asian tiger
   mosquito Ae. albopictus in Italy and stresses the importance of
   implementing the entomological surveillance for the early detection of
   and the rapid response against invasive mosquito species.}},

Abstract = {{H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus has been endemic in poultry
   in Egypt since 2008, notwithstanding the implementation of mass
   vaccination and culling of infected birds. Extensive circulation of the
   virus has resulted in a progressive genetic evolution and an antigenic
   drift. In poultry, the occurrence of antigenic drift in avian influenza
   viruses is less well documented and the mechanisms remain to be
   clarified. To test the hypothesis that H5N1 antigenic drift is driven by
   mechanisms similar to type A influenza viruses in humans, we generated
   reassortant viruses, by reverse genetics, that harbored molecular
   changes identified in genetically divergent viruses circulating in the
   vaccinated population. Parental and reassortant phenotype viruses were
   antigenically analyzed by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test and
   microneutralization (MN) assay. The results of the study indicate that
   the antigenic drift of H5N1 in poultry is driven by multiple mutations
   primarily occurring in major antigenic sites at the receptor binding
   subdomain, similarly to what has been described for human influenza H1
   and H3 subtype viruses.}},

   control (IQC) procedures as required by accreditation bodies is
   undoubtedly less developed in this analytical field. As an example the
   present study describes the development, the validation and the IQC
   implemented for a commercial enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
   able to detect 17-alpha-19-nortestosterone (alpha-NT) and
   17-beta-19-nortestosterone (beta-NT) isomers in bullock urine. In order
   to select a suitable sample treatment, two SPE purification protocols
   were preliminary compared. The chosen method was therefore fully
   validated determining the mandatory parameters required by Commission
   Decision 2002/657/EC: specificity, detection capability and robustness.
   An in-depth discussion was carried out illustrating the possible
   validation approaches and their implications especially in the
   assessment of the key performance characteristic: detection capability.

Abstract = {{A two year study (2008-2009) was carried out to monitor the Usutu virus
   (USUV) circulation in Italy. Sentinel horses and chickens, wild birds
   and mosquitoes were sampled and tested for the presence of USUV and USUV
   antibodies within the WND National Surveillance plan. Seroconversion
   evidenced in sentinel animals proved that in these two years the virus
   has circulated in Tuscany, Emilia Romagna, Veneto and Friuli Venezia
   Giulia regions. In Veneto USUV caused a severe blackbird die-off disease
   involving at least a thousand birds. Eleven viral strains were detected
   in organs of 9 blackbirds (52.9\%) and two magpies (0.5\%) originating
   from Veneto and Emilia Romagna regions. USUV was also detected in a pool
   of Culex pipiens caught in Tuscany. According to the alignment of the
   NS5 partial sequences, no differences between the Italian USUV strains
   isolated from Veneto. Friuli and Emilia Romagna regions were observed.
   The Italian North Eastern strain sequences were identical to those of
   the strain detected in the brain of a human patient and shared a high
   similarity with the isolates from Vienna and Budapest. Conversely, there
   were few differences between the Italian strains which circulated in the
   North Eastern regions and the USUV strain detected in a pool of C.
   pipiens caught in Tuscany. A high degree of similarity at both
   nucleotide and amino acid level was also found when the full genome
   sequence of the Italian North Eastern isolate was compared with that of
   the strains circulating in Europe. The North Eastern Italian strain
   sequence exhibited 97\% identity to the South African reference strain
   SAAR-1776. The deduced amino acid sequences of the Italian strain
   differed by 10 and 11 amino-acids from the Budapest and Vienna strains,
   respectively, and by 28 from the SAAR-1776 strain. According to this
   study two strains of USUVs are likely to have circulated in Italy
   between 2008 and 2009. They have developed strategies of adaptation and
   evolution to spread into new areas and to become established. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Confidence intervals for blood parameters used for nutritional and
   metabolic profile testing in cattle were calculated for clinically
   normal lactating Holstein cows, taking into account the effects of
   parity, stage of lactation, and season. Blood samples were collected
   from 740 cows in 33 Italian dairy herds according to a predefined
   protocol. Herds were visited during summer and the following winter,
   sampling 12 lactating cows at each visit (4 primiparous and 8
   multiparous). Six cows were selected from the early-lactation group
   (days in milk: 10 to 89) and the other 6 were selected from the
   mid-lactation group (days in milk: 90 to 215). Cow selection criteria
   excluded animals clinically exposed to periparturient diseases as well
   as animals not considered in good health by a veterinary clinical
   examination. For each blood variable, outliers were identified and
   discarded. Data were then analyzed for their Gaussian distribution and
   variables with not normal distribution were log-transformed to adjust
   for lack of normality. Herd mean values were calculated for each blood
   parameter according to 3 main classification factors: parity
   (primiparous vs. multiparous), stage of lactation (early vs. mid) and
   season of production (summer vs. winter). The resulting data set was
   statistically analyzed using a mixed model with the fixed effects of
   these factors, their interactions, and the random effect of herd.
   General 95\% confidence intervals were calculated for blood variables
   that showed a relevant herd variance component such as albumin,
   triglycerides, aspartate, urea, glucose, alanine aminotransferase,
   lactate dehydrogenase, direct and total bilirubin, calcium, magnesium,
   and potassium. For the remaining parameters, specific confidence
   intervals were calculated for each level of the significant main
   factors. Parity affected blood concentration of total protein, globulin,
   creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyl transferase, creatinine
   kinase, and phosphorus. Blood nonesterified fatty acids, aspartate
   aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl transferase, creatinine kinase and
   cholesterol were influenced by stage of lactation. The season of
   production had a significant effect on total protein, globulin,
   creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, phosphorus, sodium, and chlorine. The
   outcomes of this work will improve the accuracy of the biochemical
   profile as a tool for dairy practitioners to assess the metabolic status
   of lactating Holstein cows.}},

Abstract = {{Many assays aimed to test the inhibitory effects of synthetic molecules,
   and naturally occurring products on the neuraminidase activity exploit
   the hydrolysis of 2'-O-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-N-acetylneuraminic acid

   (4-MU), is then measured fluorimetrically. The authors attempted an
   analysis of the inhibitory properties of 35 naturally occurring
   flavonoids on neuraminidase N3, where only 29 of them were sufficiently
   soluble in the assay medium. During the analysis, the authors noticed a
   strong quenching effect due to the test compounds on the fluorescence of
   4-MU. The quenching constants for the flavonoids were determined
   according to the Stern-Volmer approach. The extent of fluorescence
   reduction due to quenching and the magnitude of the fluorescence
   reduction measured in the inhibition assays were comparable: for 11 of
   29 compounds, the two values were found to be coincident within the
   experimental uncertainty. These data were statistically analyzed for
   correlation by calculating the pertinent Pearson correlation
   coefficient. Inhibition and quenching were found to be positively
   correlated (r = 0.71, p(uncorr) = 1.5 x 10(-5)), and the correlation was
   maintained for the whole set of tested compounds. Altogether, the

Abstract = {{Avian influenza viruses of the H9N2 subtype have seriously affected the
   poultry industry of the Far and Middle East since the mid-1990s and are
   considered one of the most likely candidates to cause a new influenza
   pandemic in humans. To understand the genesis and epidemiology of these
   viruses, we investigated the spatial and evolutionary dynamics of
   complete genome sequences of H9N2 viruses circulating in nine Middle
   Eastern and Central Asian countries from 1998 to 2010. We identified
   four distinct and cocirculating groups (A, B, C, and D), each of which
   has undergone widespread inter- and intrasubtype reassortments, leading
   to the generation of viruses with unknown biological properties. Our
   analysis also suggested that eastern Asia served as the major source for
   H9N2 gene segments in the Middle East and Central Asia and that in this
   geographic region within-country evolution played a more important role
   in shaping viral genetic diversity than migration between countries. The
   genetic variability identified among the H9N2 viruses was associated
   with specific amino acid substitutions that are believed to result in
   increased transmissibility in mammals, as well as resistance to
   antiviral drugs. Our study highlights the need to constantly monitor the
   evolution of H9N2 viruses in poultry to better understand the potential
   risk to human health posed by these viruses.}},

Title = {{Matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors in canine mammary tumors}},
Journal = {{BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2011}},

Month = {{JUL 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Malignant canine mammary tumors represent 50\% of all
   neoplasms in female dogs. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue
   inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are thought to be involved in
   tumor progression, and they are also associated with the reactive
   stroma, which provides structural and vascular support for tumor growth.
   Results: MMP-2, MMP-9 and MT1-MMP were expressed at both the mRNA and
   protein levels in tumor samples. MMP-2 and MMP-9 immunohistochemical
   reactions were evident both in the epithelial tumor cells and in the
   stromal compartment to varying degrees; in particular, the intensity of
   the MMP-2 staining was stronger in the stromal fibroblasts close to
   epithelial tumor cells in simple carcinomas than in adenomas. These data
   were supported by gelatin-zymography; bands for the active form of MMP-2
   were found in 94\% of carcinoma samples, compared with 17\% of benign
   tumor samples. The gene expression and immunohistochemical results for
   MT1-MMP were comparable to those for MMP-2. The immunoreactivity for
   MMP-13 and TIMP-2 was lower in carcinomas than in adenomas, confirming
   the mRNA data for MMP-13 and the other MMP inhibitors that were
   evaluated. The active form of MMP-9, but not the active form of MMP-2,
   was identified in the plasma of all of the tested dogs.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that MMP-9, MMP-2 and MT1-MMP, which
   are synthesized by epithelial cancer cells and cancer-associated
   fibroblasts, play an important role in malignant canine mammary tumors.
   The reduction of MMP-13 and TIMP-2 could also be a significant step in
   malignant transformation. MMP-2 and MT1-MMP could be further evaluated
   as future biomarkers for predicting the progression and prognosis of
   canine mammary tumors.}},

Abstract = {{The genus Aeromonas has been described as comprising several species
   associated with the aquatic environment, which represents their
   principal reservoir. Aeromonas spp. are commonly isolated from diseased
   and healthy fish, but the involvement of such bacteria in human
   infection and gastroenteritis has frequently been reported. The primary
   challenge in establishing an unequivocal link between the Aeromonas
   genus and pathogenesis in humans is the extremely complicated taxonomy.
   With the aim of clarifying taxonomic relationships among the strains and
   phenotypes, a multilocus sequencing approach was developed and applied
   to characterize 23 type and reference strains of Aeromonas spp. and a
   collection of 77 field strains isolated from fish, crustaceans, and
   mollusks. All strains were also screened for putative determinants of
   virulence by PCR (ast, ahh1, act, asa1, eno, ascV, and aexT) and the
   production of acylated homoserine lactones (AHLs). In addition, the
   phenotypic fingerprinting obtained from 29 biochemical tests was
   submitted to the nonparametric combination (NPC) test methodology to
   define the statistical differences among the identified genetic
   clusters. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) achieved precise strain
   genotyping, and the phylogenetic analysis of concatenated sequences
   delineated the relationship among the taxa belonging to the genus
   Aeromonas, providing a powerful tool for outbreak traceability, host
   range diffusion, and ecological studies. The NPC test showed the
   feasibility of phenotypic differentiation among the majority of the MLST
   clusters by using a selection of tests or the entire biochemical
   fingerprinting. A Web-based MLST sequence database
   (http://pubmlst.org/aeromonas) specific for the Aeromonas genus was
   developed and implemented with all the results.}},

Abstract = {{Newcastle disease (ND) remains a constant threat to the poultry industry
   and is a limiting disease for poultry producers worldwide. The variety
   of clinical presentations and the emergence and spread of new genetic
   variants make recognition and diagnosis challenging. The current review
   details the pertinent features of the clinicopathologic disease in the
   main susceptible species, including chicken, turkey, duck, goose,
   pigeon, and other birds such as cormorants, psittacines, and canaries.
   Furthermore, the available and emerging laboratory diagnostic
   methodologies for the detection and typing of the virus are reviewed,
   including traditional techniques such as virus isolation and
   immunohistochemistry as well as rapid procedures based on molecular
   tools, such as real-time polymerase chain reaction, gene sequencing, and
   microarrays. The relevant genetic variability of ND viruses probably
   represents the major limitation in the validation and application of the
   current, advanced diagnostic molecular techniques. This underscores the
   importance of a multidisciplinary and comprehensive diagnostic approach,
   which should include, next to the new generation assays of the genomic
   era, the more traditional techniques such as histopathology,

Abstract = {{The fraudulent treatment of cattle with growth promoting agents (GPAs)
   is a matter of great concern for the European Union (EU) authorities and

   illegally treated in the EU. In contrast, only a much lower percentage
   of animals (< 0.5\%) are actually found as being noncompliant by
   conventional analytical methods. Thus, it has been proposed that methods
   should be developed that can detect the use of the substances via the
   biological effects of these substances on target organs, such as the
   alteration of protein expression profiles. Here we present a study aimed
   at evaluating if a correlation exists between the treatment with GPAs
   and alterations in the two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) protein
   pattern obtained from the biceps brachii skeletal muscle from mixed-bred
   cattle. After image analysis and statistical evaluation, protein spots
   that differentiate between treated and control groups were selected for
   analysis by mass spectrometry. A set of proteins could be defined that
   accurately detect the use of glucocorticoids and beta(2)-agonists as
   growth promoters through the changes caused in muscle differentiation.
   As a further validation, we repeated the analysis using an independent

Abstract = {{P>Surveillance programmes for low pathogenicity (LPAI) and high
   pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) infections in poultry are
   compulsory for EU Member States; yet, these programmes have rarely been
   evaluated. In Italy, following a 1999 HPAI epidemic, control measures,
   including vaccination and monitoring, were implemented in the densely
   populated poultry area (DPPA) where all epidemics in Italy have been
   concentrated. We evaluated the monitoring system for its capacity to
   detect outbreaks rapidly in meat-type turkey flocks. The evaluation was
   performed in vaccination areas and high-risk areas in the DPPA, in
   2000-2005, during which four epidemics occurred. Serum samples and
   cloacal swabs were taken from vaccinated birds and unvaccinated
   (sentinel) birds. We compared the detection rate of active, passive and
   targeted surveillance, by vaccination status, using multinomial logistic
   regression. A total of 13 275 samplings for serological testing and 4889
   samplings for virological testing were performed; 6315 production cycles
   of different bird species were tested. The outbreaks detection rate in
   meat-type turkeys was 61\% for active surveillance (n = 222/363
   outbreaks), 32\% for passive surveillance and 7\% for targeted
   surveillance. The maximum likelihood predicted values for the detection
   rates differed by vaccination status: in unvaccinated flocks, it was
   50\% for active surveillance, 40\% for passive surveillance and 10\% for
   targeted surveillance, compared to respectively 79\%, 17\% and 4\% for
   vaccinated flocks. Active surveillance seems to be most effective in
   detecting infection, especially when a vaccination programme is in
   place. This is the first evaluation of the effectiveness of different
   types of surveillance in monitoring LPAI infections in vaccinated
   poultry using field data.}},

   lesser extent in cattle and wild birds. Simultaneous circulation of

   practices monitoring allowed the definition of an area of WNV
   circulation and the 2008-2009 westward and northward spread of the
   infection. Although a relatively low number of human cases and a low

Abstract = {{Rabies is a fatal zoonosis caused by a nonsegmented negative-strand RNA
   virus, namely, rabies virus (RABV). Apart from RABV, at least 10
   additional species are known as rabies-related lyssaviruses (RRVs), and
   some of them are responsible for occasional spillovers into humans. More
   lyssaviruses have also been detected recently in different bat
   ecosystems, thanks to the application of molecular diagnostic methods.
   Due to the variety of the members of the genus Lyssavirus, there is the
   necessity to develop a reliable molecular assay for rabies diagnosis
   able to detect and differentiate among the existing rabies and
   rabies-related viruses. In the present study, a pyrosequencing protocol
   targeting the 3' terminus of the nucleoprotein (N) gene was applied for
   the rapid characterization of lyssaviruses. Correct identification of
   species was achieved for each sample tested. Results from the
   pyrosequencing assay were also confirmed by those obtained using the
   Sanger sequencing method. A pan-lyssavirus one-step reverse
   transcription (RT)-PCR was developed within the framework of the
   pyrosequencing procedure. The sensitivity (Se) of the one-step RT-PCR
   assay was determined by using in vitro-transcribed RNA and serial
   dilutions of titrated viruses. The assay demonstrated high analytical
   and relative specificity (Sp) (98.94\%) and sensitivity (99.71\%). To
   date, this is the first case in which pyrosequencing has been applied
   for lyssavirus identification using a cheaper diagnostic approach than
   the one for all the other protocols for rapid typing that we are
   acquainted with. Results from this study indicate that this procedure is

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to assess a protocol of study
   of carotid atherosclerosis coupling vascular wall imaging and luminal
   imaging in the same examination and to evaluate the accuracy of
   high-resolution MRI with a neurovascular coil in carotid plaque
   characterization.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Thirty-two consecutive patients with 34 carotid
   artery stenoses were prospectively enrolled. MRI was performed on a
   1.5-T unit. Plaque assessment was performed starting with a
   diffusion-weighted sequence and followed by a fat-suppressed T1-weighted
   sequence; after contrast-enhanced MR angiography (CE-MRA), all patients
   were evaluated with a T1-weighted 3D high-resolution sequence. Carotid
   plaques were classified as type A, having a large lipid-necrotic core;
   type B, being a complex fibrotic-calcified plaque with soft content
   (mixed plaque); or type C, being a fibrotic-calcified plaque (hard).
   Additional features indicative of vulnerable plaque such as intraplaque
   hemorrhage (IPH), ulceration, and severe stenosis were registered. MR
   findings were compared with surgical specimens.
   RESULTS. MRI correctly identified 11 of 13 type A, eight of 11 type B,
   and eight of 10 type C plaques (sensitivity, 84.6\%, 72.7\%, and 80\%,
   respectively). In the identification of lipid-necrotic core plaque, MRI
   showed a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and
   negative predictive value (NPV) of 84.6\%, 100\%, 100\%, and 91.3\%,
   respectively (kappa = 0.87). For reordering all plaques in two groups
   (i.e., soft vs nonsoft) in the identification of soft plaques, MRI had a
   sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 83.3\%, 80\%, 90.9\%, and
   66.7\%, respectively (kappa = 0.59). IPH, ulcers, and severe stenosis
   were detected in eight of eight, 11 of 13, and 25 of 25 cases,
   respectively.
   CONCLUSION. In patients with carotid atherosclerosis, ongoing CE-MRA
   with a neurovascular coil for the simultaneous detection of unstable
   plaques is feasible. Our MR protocol accurately identifies the major
   features of vulnerable plaque.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing demand for avian influenza diagnostic reagents worldwide,
   has included requests for significant supplies of product to developing
   countries. Difficulties in dispatching to remote areas and tropical
   countries are a major concern to suppliers, international organisations
   and donors as delays in forwarding parcels often result in storage at
   non-optimal or inadequate temperatures results in loss in titre and thus
   wastage of resources.
   In this study we demonstrate that the heat stability of avian influenza
   haemagglutination inhibition antigens of the H5, H7 and H9 subtype
   following 14 days of exposure to 37 degrees C and 45 degrees C is
   significantly increased by adding D-(+)-Trehalose to the freshly
   prepared antigen. Increased stability was detected both for freeze-dried
   antigens over an extended period of 6 months and also in heat exposed
   antigens that were then stored at +4 C for up to 35 days post
   reconstitution. (C) 2011 The International Alliance for Biologicals.

   Veneto region in north-eastern Italy. Its implementation required (i)
   collection of data and information; (ii) building a geodatabase; and
   (iii) development of a WebGIS application. Tools for the management,
   collection, validation and dissemination of the results (public access
   and limited access) were developed. The modular concept facilitates the
   updating and development of the system according to user needs and data
   availability. The GIS management practices that were followed to develop
   the system are outlined, followed by a detailed discussion of the key
   elements of the GIS implementation process (data model, technical

Abstract = {{Longitudinal studies evaluating the evolution of clinical,
   haematological, biochemical findings in young dogs exposed for the first
   time to multiple vector-borne pathogens have not been reported. With the
   objective of assessing the evolution of clinical, haematological and
   biochemical findings, these parameters were serially monitored in
   naturally infected dogs throughout a 1-year follow-up period. Young
   dogs, infected by vector-borne pathogens based on cytology or polymerase
   chain reaction, were examined clinically and blood samples were obtained
   at seven different follow-up time points. Dogs were randomized to group
   A (17 dogs treated with a spot-on formulation of imidacloprid 10\% and
   permethrin 50\%) or to group B (17 dogs untreated). In addition, 10
   4-month-old beagles were enrolled in each group and used as sentinel
   dogs. At baseline, Anaplasma platys was the most frequently detected
   pathogen, followed by Babesia vogeli, Bartonella spp., Ehrlichia canis
   and Hepatozoon cants. Co-infections with A. platys and B. vogeli,
   followed by E. canis and B. vogeli, A. platys and H. cants and A. platys
   and Bartonella spp. were also diagnosed. In dogs from group B. abnormal
   clinical signs were recorded at different time points throughout the
   study. No abnormal clinical signs were recorded in group A dogs.
   Thrombocytopenia was the most frequent haematological alteration
   recorded in A. platys-infected dogs, B. vogeli-infected dogs and in dogs
   co-infected with A. platys and B. vogeli or A. platys and Bartonella
   spp. Lymphocytosis was frequently detected among dogs infected with B.
   vogeli or co-infected with A. platys and B. vogeli. Beagles were often
   infected with a single pathogen rather than with multiple canine
   vector-borne pathogens. There was a significant association (p < 0.01)
   between tick infestation and A. platys or B. vogeli, as single
   infections, and A. platys and B. vogeli or A. platys and Bartonella spp.
   co-infections. This study emphasizes the clinical difficulties
   associated with assigning a specific clinical sign or haematological
   abnormality to a particular canine vector-borne disease. (C) 2010

Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Hepatozoon canis is a widespread tick-borne protozoan
   affecting dogs. The diagnosis of H. canis infection is usually performed
   by cytology of blood or buffy coat smears, but this method may not be
   sensitive. Our study aimed to evaluate the best method to achieve a
   parasitological diagnosis of H. canis infection in a population of
   receptive young dogs, previously negative by cytology and exposed to
   tick infestation for one summer season.
   Results: A total of 73 mongrel dogs and ten beagles younger than 18
   months of age, living in an animal shelter in southern Italy where dogs
   are highly infested by Rhipicephalus sanguineus, were included in this
   study. In March-April 2009 and in October 2009, blood and bone marrow
   were sampled from each dog. Blood, buffy coat and bone marrow were
   examined by cytology only (at the first sampling) and also by PCR for H.
   canis (second sampling). In March-April 2009, only one dog was positive
   for H. canis by cytological examination, whereas in October 2009 (after
   the summer season), the overall incidence of H. canis infection by
   cytological examinations was 43.9\%. Molecular tests carried out on
   samples taken in October 2009 showed a considerably higher number of
   dogs positive by PCR (from 27.7\% up to 51.2\% on skin and buffy coat
   tissues, respectively), with an overall positivity of 57.8\%. All
   animals, but one, which were positive by cytology were also
   PCR-positive. PCR on blood or buffy coat detected the highest number of
   H. canis-positive dogs displaying a sensitivity of 85.7\% for both
   tissues that increased up to 98\% when used in parallel. Twenty-six
   (74.8\%) out of the 28 H. canis-positive dogs presented hematological
   abnormalities, eosinophilia being the commonest alteration observed.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that PCR on buffy coat and blood is the
   best diagnostic assay for detecting H. canis infection in dogs, although
   when PCR is not available, cytology on buffy coat should be preferred to
   blood smear evaluation. This study has also demonstrated that H. canis
   infection can spread among young dogs infested by R. sanguineus and be
   present in the majority of the exposed population within 6 months.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the effect of illicit growth promoters (GPs) upon the cattle
   transcriptome has drawn the increasing attention of the scientific
   community. In the present study, the pre-transcriptional effects of
   three different illicit protocols on a set of target genes, including
   steroidogenic enzymes and three related transcription factors, were
   estimated in cattle testis.
   Beef cattle were administered with dexamethasone (DEX) orally (group
   D-1) or intramuscularly in experiment 1 (group DIM). In experiment 2,
   DEX was orally administered alone (group D-2) or with 17 beta-estradiol
   (group DE), and in experiment 3, dehydroepiandrosterone and boldione
   were orally administered alone (group DHEA and group ADD) or in
   combination (group DHAD). The GP effects were measured by quantitative
   real time RT-PCR.
   The results of our study were significant but not univocal. A
   GP-dependent effect on target gene mRNA levels was noticed for 3
   beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD3 beta 1, p < 0.05 and p <
   0.01 for the D-2, DE and DHAD groups, respectively), the cytochrome P450
   side chain cleavage (DHAD, p < 0.05), the cytochrome P450 17A1 (DIM and
   D-2, p < 0.05), HSD17 beta 3 (DE, p < 0.05), aromatase (DHEA, p < 0.05),
   the androgen receptor (DHAD, p < 0.05) and the mineralocorticoid
   receptor-like (DIM, p < 0.05).
   Our present results suggest that different GP schedules are likely to
   affect genes involved in steroid synthesis and regulation in cattle
   testis. Thus, this tissue might be considered a potential surrogate
   tissue that warrants further study into its usefulness in the screening
   of GP abuse. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is the etiologic agent
   of paratuberculosis, a chronic granulomatous enteric disease of
   ruminants. MAP detection by faecal culture provides the definitive
   diagnosis of the infection. Automated liquid systems for MAP culture are
   more sensitive and rapid than culture on solid media. but they are
   expensive and require specialised equipment. In this study, a
   non-automated culture method using a modified Middlebrook 7H9 liquid
   medium (7H9+) was compared with Herrold's solid medium (HEYM) and direct
   real-time PCR on dairy cattle faeces. MAP growth in 7H9+ was monitored
   weekly by real-time PCR until the 12th week post-inoculation. The
   analytical sensitivity of the three methods was evaluated using faecal
   samples from a healthy cow spiked with ten-fold dilutions of MAP
   organisms (10(4)-10(-1)) and naturally MAP-infected faeces serially
   diluted 1 to 10 in negative faecal samples. The limits of detection of
   the solid culture and direct real-time PCR were 10(2) and 10(3) MAP/g,
   respectively. In comparison, the 7H9+ culture revealed as few as 1
   MAP/g. A marked reduction in time to detection of the pathogen, compared
   with HEYM culture, was obtained. In addition, the three methods were
   applied to environmental faecal samples collected from a high- and a
   low-prevalence herd. The culture in 7H9+ showed to be the most sensitive
   test in the low-prevalence herd and provided faster results than HEYM.
   In the high-prevalence herd the three methods showed the same
   sensitivity and the real-time PCR had the shortest turnaround time. In
   conclusion, the use of 7H9+ for MAP-detection from cattle faeces
   maximizes diagnostic sensitivity and reduces turnaround time and,
   therefore, could replace culture in solid medium. Hence, we propose a
   two-step protocol for the assessment of MAP faecal excretion based on:
   1) direct real-time PCR on all samples: and 2) inoculation of negative
   samples into 7H9+ and analysis after 3 and, if necessary, 6 weeks by
   real-time PCR. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) are pathogens of global concern, but
   there has been little previous research on avian influenza in southern
   Africa and almost nothing is known about the dynamics of AIVs in the
   region. We counted, captured and sampled birds regularly at five sites,
   two in South Africa (Barberspan and Strandfontein) and one in each of
   Botswana (Lake Ngami), Mozambique (Lake Chuali) and Zimbabwe (Lakes
   Manyame and Chivero) between March 2007 and May 2009. The South African
   and Zimbabwean sites were visited every 2 months and the sites in
   Botswana and Mozambique every 4 months. During each visit we undertook
   5-7 days of standardised bird counts followed by 5-10 days of capturing
   and sampling water-associated birds. We sampled 4,977 birds of 165
   different species and completed 2,503 half-hour point counts. We found
   125 positive rRT-PCR cases of avian influenza across all sites. Two
   viruses (H1N8 and H3N8) were isolated and additional H5, H6 and H7
   strains were identified. We did not positively identify any highly
   pathogenic H5N1. Overall viral prevalence (2.51\%) was similar to the
   lower range of European values, considerable spatial and temporal
   variation occurred in viral prevalence, and there was no detectable
   influence of the annual influx of Palearctic migrants. Although
   waterbirds appear to be the primary viral carriers, passerines may link
   wild birds and poultry. While influenza cycles are probably driven by
   the bird movements that result from rainfall patterns, the epidemiology
   of avian influenza in wild birds in the subregion is complex and there
   appears to be the possibility for viral transmission throughout the
   year.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies carried out in the last years have demonstrated the
   presence of a wide range of contaminants in some areas of the Venice
   Lagoon. Many of these contaminants are able to drive free radical
   reactions, which lead to oxidative stress and can potentially affect
   fish health. In the present study, oxidative stress biomarkers were
   examined in three different sites (Porto Marghera, Val di Brenta and
   Caroman) of the Venice Lagoon and their levels monitored in
   Zosterisessor ophiocephalus, one of the most common fish species present
   in the lagoon. Schmorl's staining revealed the presence of
   melanomacrophage centres in spleen and head kidney, and the highest
   number of melanomacrophage centres was observed in the animals sampled
   at the Porto Marghera (Porto Marghera vs Val di brenta and Caroman: p <
   0.01). The cellular localization of HNE and NT, investigated through an
   immunohistochemical approach, showed that immunopositivity was mainly
   localized in melanomacrophage centres of spleen and kidney. It is
   relevant that the animals of the detoxified control group did not
   exhibit any immunoreactivity.
   By Western blot, the antibodies against HNE and NT recognized in the
   liver polypeptides damaged by oxidative stress with molecular weights
   under 66 kDa. Comparing the relative densities, animals from the Val di
   Brenta site exhibited the lowest levels of HNE adducts (p < 0.05).

   doi:10.1152/ajpgi.00141.2010.-Following liver injury, the wound-healing
   process is characterized by hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation from
   the quiescent fat-storing phenotype to a highly proliferative
   myofibroblast-like phenotype. Snail1 is a transcription factor best
   known for its ability to trigger epithelial-mesenchymal transition, to
   influence mesoderm formation during embryonic development, and to favor
   cell survival. In this study, we evaluated the expression of Snail1 in
   experimental and human liver fibrosis and analyzed its role in the HSC
   transdifferentiation process. Liver samples from patients with liver
   fibrosis and from mice treated by either carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) or
   thioacetamide (TAA) were evaluated for mRNA expression of Snail1. The
   transcription factor expression was investigated by immunostaining and
   real-time quantitative RTPCR (qRT-PCR) on in vitro and in vivo activated
   murine HSC. Snail1 knockdown studies on cultured HSC and on CCl4-treated
   mice were performed by adenoviral delivery of short-hairpin RNA;
   activation-related genes were quantitated by real-time qRT-PCR and
   Western blotting. Snail1 mRNA expression resulted upregulated in murine
   experimental models of liver injury and in human hepatic fibrosis. In
   vitro studies showed that Snail1 is expressed by HSC and that its
   transcription is augmented in in vitro and in vivo activated HSC
   compared with quiescent HSC. At the protein level, we could observe the
   nuclear translocation of Snail1 in activated HSC. Snail1 knockdown
   resulted in the downregulation of activation-related genes both in vitro
   and in vivo. Our data support a role for Snail1 transcription factor in
   the hepatic wound-healing response and its involvement in the HSC
   transdifferentiation process.}},

Title = {{Effect of non-forage roughage replacement on feeding behaviour and milk
   production in dairy cows}},
Journal = {{ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine whether the partial
   replacement of roughage from forage with non-forage fiber sources, in a
   total mixed ration (TMR), could reduce feed sorting by dairy cows
   without modifying behaviour and milk production. Twelve Holstein cows
   were fed two TMR maize silage based diets in a cross-over experiment.
   Compared to the control diet (C-diet), experimental diet (E-diet) was
   formulated by replacing 8\% neutral detergent fibre (NDF) from straw and
   alfalfa hay with soybean hulls and wheat bran. E-diet had a lower
   physical effectiveness factor (pef) (0.37 vs 0.34; P<0.001) and physical
   effective NDF (peNDF) (15.5 vs 14.6\%; P<0.01). Feeding and sorting
   behaviour, ruminal activity, milk yield and composition and blood
   metabolites were measured. The results indicated that dry matter intake
   was not affected by diet. Cows fed the experimental TMR spent less time
   eating (192 vs 178 min/d; P<0.05) but showed the same number of meals
   per day. C-diet fed cows sorted against peNDF in a greater extent (98.3
   vs 100.9\%; P<0.05). Treatments did not affect cows time budget of
   general behaviours, with particular regard to ruminating activity.
   Despite different forage sources in TMR, no significant differences in
   milk yield and quality were detected.
   (NDF) requirement (NRC, 2001) is not met develop metabolic disorders
   that influence milk production and health status, leading to displaced
   abomasum, ruminal parakeratosis, laminitis, acidosis and fat cow
   syndrome (Keunen et al., 2002). Along with NDF content, adequate
   physical characteristics of fibre, such as particle size and density,
   are necessary for proper ruminal fermentation, utilisation, metabolism
   and milk fat production (Mertens, 1997). Reduced forage particle size
   and non-forage fibre sources have been shown to decrease chewing time
   and saliva production, which buffers the rumen. Thus, reduced forage
   particle size and non-forage fibre sources lead to a low ruminal pH
   (<5.8) (Dohme et al., 2007). However, when fibre is provided in total
   mixed ration (TMR), and the proportion of particles longer than 19 mm is
   high, cows are more likely to sort the ration and the diet that is
   actually consumed by them is very different than the one originally
   formulated (Leonardi and Armentano, 2007). If cows are allowed to sort
   their ration, ruminal pH may fluctuate and affect feed intake,
   fermentation and overall digestion (DeVries et al., 2008). To achieve
   optimal diet utilisation leading to maximal rumen functionality, health
   status and milk yield, adequate particle length/size of forage should be
   maintained (Lammers et al., 1996), and feed sorting by cows should be
   minimised. In spite of different ration compositions and particle size
   distributions, many authors found that dairy cows were able to sort out
   the fibrous component of the feed (Kononoff et al., 2003b; DeVries et
   al., 2007). Replacing a portion of high-roughage forage in the TMR and a
   portion of concentrates with short, readily digestible NDF-rich
   by-products may reduce sorting by animals. Moreover, dry matter (DM) and
   NDF intake may be more homogenous and improve milk yield through a
   simultaneous utilisation of energy and proteins by rumen bacteria
   (Halachmi et al., 2004).
   The objective of this study was to characterise feeding, sorting,
   ruminal function, behaviour, milk yield and quality of dairy cows fed a
   ration with a roughage component based on both forage and readily
   digestible NDF-rich by-products.}},

   sulfadimethoxine and doxycycline were administered for 10 days to
   chickens in poultry feed incurred at the contamination levels frequently
   found during national feed monitoring programmes (1-5mg kg(-1)).
   Sulfadimethoxine and doxycycline residual concentrations detected in
   muscle (<LOD and 31 mu g kg(-1), respectively), liver (13 and 56 mu g
   kg(-1), respectively) and kidney (56 and 115 mu g kg(-1), respectively)
   were compared with their maximum residue limits (MRLs) fixed by EC
   470/2009 and EU 37/2010 Regulations for a preliminary risk evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular diagnostic tests are widely implemented in animal and human
   health microbiology. Efficient nucleic acid extraction methods are
   essential in diagnostic laboratories and automation is a valuable tool
   for those with high throughput activity. Nucleic acid extraction
   protocols present variable efficiency depending on the composition of
   the specimen and the chemical-physical characteristics of the target
   pathogen. In the present study, we compared the DNA extraction
   performances of four automated methods (kits I, M, P, Q) adapted on a
   Hamilton Robotics ``Microlab Starlet{''} extraction unit, and one manual
   method (kit R). Ten-fold dilutions of Mycobacterium avium subsp.
   paratuberculosis (MAP) were used to contaminate bovine central nervous
   system (CNS) and lung-spleen-liver pools (LSL). In consideration of its
   chemical-physical characteristics, MAP was selected as a template for
   pathogen DNA detection. Analytical performance and repeatability were
   assessed through downstream real-time PCR amplification, hands-on time
   (HOT), total turnaround time (TAT) and costs of all kits. MAP was
   detected differently depending on extraction kit and type of matrix
   analysed. Kits M and I showed the highest analytical performance on CNS
   (1 MAP/ml) and LSL (10 MAP/ml), respectively. Besides analytical
   results, kits I and M displayed high repeatability, the same HOT, very
   similar TAT, and were inexpensive. In conclusions, different
   standardized automated systems have been established with high
   throughput, sensitivity and repeatability for CNS and LSL. Our results
   also demonstrated that is necessary to assess the effectiveness of
   extraction kits in matrices not previously tested to avoid the risk of
   unreliable diagnostic outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{For several years eel farms situated in NW Greece, kept reporting, lack
   of appetite and alarming losses among growing eels of various size
   classes. The problems usually occurred subsequent to handling, such as
   grading. During the recent years 2008-2010 these problems intensified.
   Necropsy, bacteriology and parasitology performed on diseased specimens
   often resulted in mixed findings, such as Aeromonas spp. infections or
   Dactylogyrus spp., Trichodina spp. and Myxidium spp. infestations, none
   of which was deemed sufficiently intense to explain the severity of
   symptoms and the persistence of losses. Antibiotic treatments and/or
   antiparasitic baths did not help. Common lesions comprised gill
   inflammation and often bleeding of the gills and red sore like dermal
   lesions around the head and opercular regions. The pectoral fins were
   frequently haemorrhagic. These lesions and the frequency and persistence
   of morbidity suggested the possibility of infection by Herpes Virus
   Anguillae (HVA). Frozen samples at -20 degrees C of diseased whole eels
   of three different batches from the same farm were collected in spring
   and summer of 2010 and sent to a virology laboratory. Virus isolations
   were performed on eel kidney (EK-1) and Bluegill fry (BF-2) cell lines,
   where cytopathic effects were observed. Both the IPNV and the HVA agents
   were isolated and identified by IFAT and the viral particles were
   observed by transmission electron microscopy. This is the first
   published report of HVA and IPN viruses infecting farmed eels in Greece.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of animal health Strategy for the European Union (2007-2013)
   where ``Prevention is better than cure{''} covers not only the absence
   of disease in animals, but also the critical relationship between the
   health of animals and their welfare. It is also a pillar for the EU
   Commission's policy on public health and food safety. Partnership and
   communication to the public are the two key underlying principles of the
   AHS and in particular the spreading of the concept of `` Animals +
   Humans = One health{''}. In this framework EU Parliament aims at
   promoting the work of EU veterinarians and at explaining the importance
   of animal health within the context of the EU's AHS. The overall aim is
   to increase the public's interest in EU animal health and food safety
   matters. According to this strategy, the present work aims at applying
   the two principles of partnership and communication to the public,
   through the implementation of a public health education programme in
   secondary schools. Schools in fact can make a substantial contribution
   to a student's health and well being. Moreover, students represents
   future citizens and there is a developing understanding on the
   interlinked relationships between school education and health and
   behaviour. A range of strategies and programmes have been implemented in
   the last 10 years, sharing the connecting thread that all aspects of
   life are potentially important in the promotion of health. Moreover
   school programmes, that are integrated with public health topics and in
   which practical scientific experiences are applied, are more likely to
   produce better education outcomes, health, public awareness and
   confidence and holistic culture than those which are mainly
   information-based and implemented only in classrooms. According to these
   considerations, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie
   (IZSVe) aims at implementing an education programme in public health,
   structured by means of a `` blended learning model{''}, addressed to
   secondary schools of the Veneto Region (north eastern of Italy). This
   geographical area is characterized by an important agricultural and
   livestock production. The occurrence of several animal and food-borne
   emergencies have, in the last decade, caused drastic economic losses due
   to the policy measures applied and a reduction in consumer confidence
   hence negatively influencing consumption of food of animal origin. The
   objectives of this public health education programme are: promote a
   scientific and public health culture; increase public perception and
   understanding of the scientific methods applied in public health and
   research institutions like IZSVe, via the implementation of practical
   experiments supported by contextualized and theoretical explanations
   targeted to the school audience; increase public awareness and knowledge
   on sanitary risks related to the animal-human relationship and to
   consumption of food of animal origin; highlight the important role
   played by veterinary public health institutions and veterinarians in
   society.}},

Abstract = {{Taking into account the sanitary consequences of the food crisis which
   hit Europe in the `90s, well summarized by Bovine Spongiform
   Encephalopathy (BSE), the collection and exchange of data along all the
   steps of the food production chain ({''}from farm to fork{''}) is
   essential {[}4].
   The aim of this paper is to describe a practical use of the information
   system technologies applied to food safety and beef traceability in the
   Veneto Region (Northern Italy).
   Since 1994, the regional veterinary service has been developing a
   Regional Information System (RIS) with the aim of creating and
   maintaining an effective and structured communication network among all
   the stakeholders (health authorities, producers, consumers). The core of
   the RIS is the Regional Data Bank (RDB) which stores all data about
   farms and related industries and is linked to a geographical information
   system for spatial data management. The RDB also manages the regional
   register of individual bovine animals, containing information on cattle
   movements, slaughtering, births and deaths. The RDB is linked to the
   National Data Bank and provides it with the information required by the
   Italian and European legislations. An important node of the RIS is the
   Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie (IZSVe), a
   veterinary public health institute that conducts official laboratory
   controls and research activities in the areas of animal health and
   welfare, food safety, and environmental protection. The IZSVe
   headquarters also house the Regional Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology
   (CREV) which is responsible for the implementation and management of the
   RIS.
   The ongoing consolidation of RDB archives has recently allowed the
   development of a procedure (GESVET) for the management of the activities
   performed by the Veterinary Services of the 21 Local Public Health Units
   (LPHUs) operating in the region. Inter alia a specific module for the
   management of the veterinary activities at slaughterhouses has been
   implemented. The RIS is also integrated with the IZSVe laboratories
   (IZILAB) information system.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Partial genome sequences were determined and subjected to
   comparative analyses from two fish herpesviruses (HVs). Acipenserid
   (Aci) HV-2, originating from the white sturgeon (Acipenser
   transmontanus), and ictalurid (Ic) HV-2, isolated from the black
   bullhead (Ameiurus melas), are recently approved species of the genus
   Ictalurivirus of the family Alloherpesviridae. Methods: An almost
   8,000-base-pair fragment, spanning between the genes of the DNA
   polymerase and the ATPase subunit of the terminase, was sequenced from
   each virus. Results: The size, position and orientation of 2 partial and
   3 full open reading frames, contained in the studied genome fragment,
   proved to be similar to their counterparts in IcHV-1, the type species
   of the genus Ictalurivirus. Thus, a well-conserved genus-specific gene
   block was identified. In the members of two other genera (Cyprinivirus
   and Batrachovirus) of the family Alloherpesviridae, no such gene block
   could be found; the location and orientation of the homologous genes
   showed significant divergence. Conclusion: The results of phylogenetic
   calculations were in good agreement with the genome arrangements
   inasmuch as AciHV-2, IcHV-1 and -2 are monophyletic and separated from
   the lineages of the other two genera. The new sequence enabled the
   inclusion of a hitherto unassigned HV, that of the Australian pilchard,

Abstract = {{The overuse of antimicrobials can select resistant bacteria strains;
   staphylococci have the ability to become resistant to all beta-lactam
   antimicrobials and are a significant concern in human medicine and a
   growing issue for veterinary medicine. Because antimicrobials are
   sometimes incorrectly used in breeding kennels, the objective of the
   work was to assess the occurrence of methicillin-resistant
   coagulase-positive staphylococci in breeding dogs. The research was
   carried out in 13 kennels that were allotted to three categories
   according to the intensity of antimicrobial use. Vaginal and milk swabs
   were taken from 87 healthy bitches around parturition and also from
   multiple organs of 27 of their pups that died within the first 2 weeks.
   Standard bacteriological examinations were carried out and
   coagulase-positive staphylococci were identified. All the
   coagulase-positive Staphylococci resulted to be Staphylococcus
   pseudintermedius. Susceptibility to oxacillin and the presence of the
   mecA gene were tested. Nine out of 89 strains (six isolated from the
   bitches' milk and three from dead puppies, all belonging to kennels
   characterized by an excessive use of antimicrobials) were
   multidrug-resistant, methicillin-resistant and mecA positive.
   Our results confirm that excessive use of antimicrobials entails the
   risk of selecting resistant staphylococci strains. Our data also
   indicate that the bacterial flora of healthy dogs belonging to specific
   populations may act as a reservoir of resistance genes. (C) 2011

   several amino acid substitutions in comparison with the progenitor

Abstract = {{Pseudorabies virus (PrV) infections appear to be more widely distributed
   in the European wild boar (Sus scrofa) population than assumed. In
   Europe, attempts to isolate and characterize the causative agents have
   been limited so far. We therefore collected and examined a total of 35
   PrV isolates obtained from wild boar or hunting dogs in Germany, France,
   Spain, Italy, Slovakia and Hungary between 1993 and 2008. Restriction
   enzyme analysis of genomic DNA using BamHI showed that all isolates,

   For further investigations of the phylogenetic relationships, a 732-bp
   fragment of the glycoprotein C (gC) gene was amplified by PCR. Sequence
   analysis revealed about 40 variant positions within this fragment.
   Comparison of the nucleotide sequences supported the separation into a

Abstract = {{During June and July of 2009, sudden deaths, tremulous movements and
   population declines of adult honey bees were reported by the beekeepers
   in the region of Peloponnesus (Mt. Mainalo), Greece. A preliminary study
   was carried out to investigate these unexplained phenomena in this
   region. In total, 37 bee samples, two brood frames containing honey bee
   brood of various ages, eight sugar samples and four sugar patties were
   collected from the affected colonies. The samples were tested for a
   range of pests, pathogens and pesticides. Symptomatic adult honey bees
   tested positive for Varroa destructor, Nosema ceranae, Chronic bee
   paralysis virus (CBPV), Acute paralysis virus (ABPV), Deformed wing
   virus (DWV), Sacbrood virus (SBV) and Black queen cell virus (BQCV), but
   negative for Acarapis woodi. American Foulbrood was absent from the
   brood samples. Chemical analysis revealed that amitraz, thiametoxan,
   clothianidin and acetamiprid were all absent from symptomatic adult
   bees, sugar and sugar patty samples. However, some bee samples, were
   contaminated with imidacloprid in concentrations between 14 ng/g and 39
   ng/g tissue. We present: the infection of Greek honey bees by multiple
   viruses: the presence of N. ceranae in Greek honey bees and the first
   record of imidacloprid (neonicotonoid) residues in Greek honey bee
   tissues. The presence of multiple pathogens and pesticides made it
   difficult to associate a single specific cause to the depopulation
   phenomena observed in Greece, although we believe that viruses and N.
   ceranae synergistically played the most important role. A follow up
   in-depth survey across all Greek regions is required to provide context
   to these preliminary findings. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   in hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and fluorescent antibody test (FAT)
   Two seropositive dogs had antibodies to H3 hemagglutinin proteins

Abstract = {{Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of subtype H7N1 that emerged
   during an outbreak in 1999 and 2000 in Italy differ from their
   low-pathogenicity precursor viruses by changes in several genes,
   including three mutations in the NS1 protein. Two of them involve amino
   acid exchanges located within or closely adjacent to the nuclear export
   signal of NS1. The third mutation resulted in a new stop codon and
   thereby a C-terminal truncation of the NS1 protein of the highly
   pathogenic viruses. To find out whether these mutations contribute to
   the phenotypic differences between the highly pathogenic and low
   pathogenic viruses, we generated recombinants of the highly pathogenic
   A/ostrich/Italy/984/00 strain that contained the nuclear export signal
   and/or the extended C terminus of NS1 of a low pathogenic virus
   (A/chicken/Italy/1082/99). Using these recombinants we could demonstrate
   that replication rate and spread of infection in chicken fibroblast
   cultures, as well as infectivity for chicken embryos is reduced, whereas
   the mean death time for chicken embryos is increased, when the highly
   pathogenic virus acquires the NS1 motifs of the low pathogenic virus.
   Analysis of beta interferon transcription in chicken fibroblasts
   infected with the recombinants revealed that the mutations observed in
   the nuclear export signal of the highly pathogenic viruses were
   responsible for the enhanced interferon antagonism of these viruses.
   Cell fractionation and immunofluorescence studies in chicken fibroblasts
   showed that the nuclear export signal of the highly pathogenic viruses
   is responsible for cytoplasmic accumulation of NS1, whereas the
   C-terminal truncation promotes transport into the nucleoli. Comparative
   analysis in human A549 cells indicated that intracellular distribution
   of NS1 is host specific. Taken together, these observations support the
   concept that compartmentalization of NS1 within the cell contributes to
   the pathogenicity of avian influenza viruses.}},

   Italy) in order to investigate the occurrence and risk factors
   associated with dermatophytoses in breeding rabbits. Dermatophytes were
   isolated from 86.9\% (20/23) of the farms and from 51.8\% (420/810) of
   the animals sampled. Trichophyton mentagrophytes (47.9\%) and
   Microsporum canis (3.2\%) were isolated from diseased (71.7\%) and
   healthy (48.4\%) animals as well from the surrounding environment
   (7.5\%). The occurrence of lesions, the age of rabbits, and farm
   management (e. g., temperature, humidity and methods and frequency of
   disinfection practices) were identified as the most significant risk
   factors (P < 0.05) for the occurrence of dermatophytes. Animals in
   fattening and finishing stages were the most frequently infected (i.e.,
   58.2 and 61.6\% respectively). Dermatophyte prevalence was significantly
   (P < 0.05) higher in areas with higher temperature (>20 degrees C) and
   relative humidity ranging from 62-65\%. The results of the present
   investigation suggest that zoonotic dermathophytes are present in rabbit
   farms and highlight the importance of correct management procedures for
   the control of the infections.}},

Abstract = {{Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) infection in ruminants
   is a significant problem due to the high prevalence of the infection and
   to recent research data strengthening the link between the pathogen and
   some human inflammatory bowel disease. Control through
   hygiene-management measures and test and culling of positive animals is
   the approach generally applied with certain success in western
   countries. Nonetheless, these measures are not systematically applied
   among territories and standardised protocols are still absent.
   Therefore, an increase of the prevalence of paratuberculosis have been
   observed in the recent years, and eradication is a challenge. For these
   reasons, the identification of new control methods is needed. On the
   light of recent studies, the application of vaccination plans in dairy
   cattle is reconsidered, since it provides benefits in terms of milk
   production, extension of the life of the animals and reduction of
   environmental contamination. These reflections have a positive impact on
   the farmers, but interferences with the diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis
   have been limiting the use of vaccination. A new and promising approach
   for paratuberculosis control, is based on the recent identification of
   specific genetic loci associated with susceptibility to the disease.
   Once determined in larger cohorts of animals, it would be possible to
   select the animals on the basis of the genetic resistance to the
   disease. In this article, the implementation of current control programs
   based on sanitary risks management in the farm with these new approaches
   is discussed.}},

Title = {{The Posterior Approach in the Treatment of Popliteal Artery Aneurysm:
   Feasibility and Analysis of Outcome}},

Abstract = {{Background: This review evaluates the results of our 18-year experience
   with surgical treatment of popliteal artery aneurysms (PAAs), examining
   the effects of the variables of clinical presentations, surgical
   technique, graft material, and runoff on operative results in the
   management of popliteal aneurysms.
   Methods: We reviewed 49 PAAs consecutively repaired in 35 patients. We
   preferentially use, if possible, the posterior approach for repair of
   popliteal aneurysms. We repaired aneurysms passing above the Hunter
   canal using a medial approach to allow for adequate exposure of the
   proximal neck of the aneurysm. We separately analyzed the results of
   patients who underwent the posterior approach (group A) and those that
   underwent the medial approach (group B). Primary, primary assisted, and
   secondary patency were established using life-tables analysis.
   Results: In our experience, the posterior approach was used in 38
   repairs (77.6\%), followed by graft interposition (group A). PAAs were
   asymptomatic in 29 (59.2\%) of 49 cases. Among 20 symptomatic PAAs, nine
   (18.4\%) caused intermittent claudication, one (2.0\%) caused rest pain
   and trophic wound, and the remaining 10 limbs (20.4\%) presented with
   acute ischemia and limb threat. A total of 11 popliteal aneurysms
   (22.4\%) required repair with a medial approach (group B) because the
   extension of the aneurysm was proximal to the adductor hiatus. The
   primary patency rates at 6 and 8 years were 94.3 and 83.8\%,
   respectively, for group A and 100\% (p = .43) and 19.1\% (p = .001) for
   group B, the respective assisted primary patency rates were 97.3 and
   86.3\%, in group A and 100\% (p = .43) and 19.1\% (p = .001) for group
   B. The secondary patency rates at 6 months and 8 years were 97.3 and
   97.3\%, respectively, in group A and 90.9\% (p - .34) and 77.9\% (p -
   .05) in group B. Amputation occurred in two (4.1\%) of 49 limbs and
   30-day postoperative mortality was 2.0\% (1/49 patients). There was no
   statistical difference in amputation rate in symptomatic and
   asymptomatic limbs, and in group A and B.
   Conclusion: We believe that the posterior approach is the gold standard
   surgical therapy to treat PPAs not extending above the Hunter canal. In
   our experience, the posterior approach was possible in 77.6\% of cases.
   It has excellent patency and prevents further aneurysm expansion by
   completely interrupting the collateral circulation to the aneurysm sac.
   In contrast, the posterior approach had a slightly higher tibial nerve
   injury (p = .43), especially during the learning curve. The preoperative
   symptoms and the use of venous material for reconstruction affect
   significantly long-term patency.}},

Abstract = {{Canine vector-borne diseases (CVBDs) are highly prevalent and increasing
   in distribution worldwide. A longitudinal study was conducted in
   southern Italy to determine the incidence of and protection against
   CVBD-causing pathogens in dogs treated with a combination of
   imidacloprid 10\% and permethrin 50\% (ImPer). One hundred eleven
   autochthonous young dogs were divided into group A (n = 63) and group B
   (n = 48), both groups containing dogs positive and negative for one or
   more CVBD-causing pathogens. Additionally, 10 naive male beagles were
   introduced in each group in May 2008. Group A was treated with ImPer on
   day 0 and every 21 2 days whereas group B was left untreated. Blood and
   skin samples were collected at baseline (March-April 2008) and at the
   first, second and third follow-up times (July and October 2008 and April
   2009). Bone marrow was sampled at baseline and at the third follow-up.
   Serological, cytological and molecular tests were performed to detect
   Anaplasma platys, Babesia spp., Bartonella spp., Dirofilaria immitis,
   Ehrlichia canis, Hepatozoon canis and Leishmania infantum. Ectoparasites
   (fleas, ticks, and sand flies) were monitored throughout the study. The
   baseline prevalence of CVBDs was 39.6\% with 44 dogs positive for at
   least one pathogen. A. platys (27.5\%) and Babesia spp. (15.6\%) were
   the most prevalent species and co-infections with up to two pathogens
   were detected in 16 (14.7\%) individuals. At the end of the evaluation
   period, there was a 90.7\% reduction in overall CVBD incidence density
   rate (IDR) in group A, as following: 100\% reduction in L infantum;
   94.6\% in E. canis; 94.4\% in Babesia spp.; and 81.8\% in A. platys.
   Initially positive treated dogs showed significantly lower pathogen
   prevalence at the third follow-up than untreated ones. At the end of the
   evaluation period, 8 of the 10 untreated beagles were infected with at
   least one pathogen whereas one of the treated beagles was A. platys
   positive at a single time point (second follow-up). Overall efficacy
   against ticks was 97.9\%. In October 2009, samples were collected from
   the remaining 83 dogs (44 from group A and 39 from group B) to
   investigate the annual incidence of CVBDs in the same, at this time
   untreated, dog population. A high year incidence for tick-borne diseases
   (78.1\%) and for L infantum (13.6\%) was detected in dogs from group A.
   seven months after the treatment had been withdrawn. The results
   demonstrate that ImPer preventive treatment against arthropods protects
   autochthonous and naive beagle dogs against CVBD-causing pathogens. (C)

Abstract = {{The proportion of Campylobacter spp. isolates that are resistant to
   fluoroquinolones, the drugs of choice for campylobacteriosis, has been
   increasing worldwide. We developed an innovative method based on a
   Luminex xMAP (TM) DNA suspension array that allows the identification of
   Campylobacter species and, simultaneously, the detection of the most
   common point mutation in the gyrA gene (substitution from threonine 86
   to isoleucine 86) that is responsible for fluoroquinolone resistance.
   Ninety-six Campylobacter coli and Campylobacter jejuni isolates
   collected from turkeys were first investigated by microdilution test to
   characterize the antimicrobial resistance patterns. The isolates,
   amplified for the quinolone resistance determining region of the gyrA
   gene, were then tested using Luminex suspension array. The reliability
   of the method was demonstrated by the total concordance between the
   results obtained using Luminex and those of the sequencing of gyrA
   polymerase chain reaction products. The genotypic characterization of
   fluoroquinolone resistance using Luminex was also consistent with the
   data on phenotypical resistance obtained by microdilution test. The
   results of this study strongly support the potential of Luminex xMAP
   technology as an efficient molecular method for the rapid and accurate
   identification of C. coli and C. jejuni isolates and the
   characterization of the major determinant of fluoroquinolone resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Canine vector-borne diseases (CVBDs) pose a diagnostic challenge,
   particularly when a dog is coinfected with more than one pathogen. The
   purpose of this study was to generate information about the diagnosis of
   CVBDs in young dogs following their first exposure to flea, tick, sand
   fly, louse, and mosquito vectors. From March 2008 to May 2009, 10
   purpose-bred young naive beagle dogs and a cohort of 48 mixed-breed dogs
   living in an area to which CVBD is endemic in southern Italy were
   monitored using different diagnostic tests (cytology, serology, and
   PCR). Overall, PCR detected the highest number of dogs infected with
   Anaplasma platys, Babesia vogeli, and Ehrlichia canis, whereas
   seroconversion was a more sensitive indicator of exposure to Leishmania
   infantum. For A. platys infection, combining blood and buffy coat
   cytology in parallel enhanced the relative sensitivity (SE(rel))
   (87.3\%). For B. vogeli, the best diagnostic combination was buffy coat
   cytology and serology used in parallel (SE(rel), 67.5\%), whereas
   serology and PCR used in parallel (SE(rel), 100\%) was the best
   combination for L. infantum. Overall, 12 (20.7\%) dogs were coinfected;
   however, the percentage of new coinfections decreased from baseline
   (50\%) to the first (33.3\%) and second (16.6\%) follow-up time points.
   Numbers of coinfections with A. platys and B. vogeli were significantly
   higher (P < 0.05) than coinfections with other pathogen combinations.
   The data generated in this study provide insights on the incidence of
   certain pathogens infecting young dogs in southern Italy, highlight
   important diagnostic testing limitations, and support the use of
   multiple diagnostic modalities when attempting to confirm a tick-borne
   infection in an individual dog or in a canine population.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the seasonal dynamics of Rhipicephalus sanguineus
   (Latreille) (Acari: Ixodidae) on naturally infested dogs in a private
   shelter in southern Italy. From March to May 2008, 39 autochthonous
   mixed-breed young dogs and 10 beagles were enrolled in the study. From
   March 2008 until March 2009, every 21 +/- 2 days, 11 body sites of each
   dog were checked for ticks. At each follow-up, the number of ticks,
   their developmental stage, sex and location on the dog's body were
   recorded. Adult ticks were found throughout the year, but immatures were
   absent in January and February. The adult tick population increased from
   July to August, whereas the load of immatures increased in early July
   and peaked in September, which suggests that R. sanguineus develops one
   generation per year in this area. The mean number of immature ticks per
   infested dog was higher than that of adults from March to October 2008.
   Ears, interdigital areas and armpits were the most frequent attachment
   sites of adult ticks. At the last follow-up, a total of 2266 ticks were
   collected and identified as R. sanguineus. The results suggest that R.
   sanguineus develops one generation per year in the study area, but that
   it infests dogs in all seasons. This information should be taken into
   account when planning control programmes against this tick species and
   the pathogens it transmits.}},

Abstract = {{Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses of the H5 and H7

   H5 HPAI viruses to infect and to be transmitted from infected BALB/c
   mice to contact sentinels. Previous experiments have shown that viruses
   belonging to both H5 and H7 subtypes replicate in the respiratory tract
   and central nervous system of experimentally infected mice. In this
   study we show that selected H7N1 and H5N1 HPAI viruses can be
   transmitted from mouse-to-mouse by direct contact, and that in
   experimentally infected animals they exhibit a different pattern of
   replication and transmission. Our results can be considered as a
   starting point for transmission experiments involving other influenza A
   viruses with alpha 2-3 receptor affinity in order to better understand
   the viral factors influencing transmissibility of these viruses in

   being capable of detecting as low as 10 TCID(50)/ml. For clinical
   validation, samples from 100 marine fish were collected during a natural
   outbreak of disease and tested by three distinct laboratory methods,
   namely real-time TaqMan PCR, RT-seminested PCR and virus isolation. The
   results indicated optimal agreement between tests. The assay that was
   developed is capable of detecting members of all of the betanodavirus
   genetic groups currently described and can be considered a valid
   alternative to the time-consuming and contamination-prone nested PCR.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure to the risk of neighbourhood infection was estimated for the
   H7N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) epidemic that affected
   Northern Italy between 1999 and 2000. The two most affected regions
   (Lombardy and Veneto) were analyzed and the epidemic was divided into
   three phases. Q statistics were used to evaluate exposure to the risk of
   neighbourhood infection using two measures. First, a local Q statistic
   (Q(ikt)) assessed daily exposure for each farm as a function of the
   number of neighbouring infected farms that were in their infectious
   period, weighted by the distance between farms. This allowed us to
   identify the daily time course of risk for each farm and, at any given
   time, local groups of farms defined by high risk. Second, for each farm
   a summary statistic of exposure risk within each phase (Q(i)(ph)) was
   obtained by summing Q(ikt) over the duration of each phase. This allowed
   identification of farms defined by persistent, high exposure risk within
   each phase of the epidemic. Statistical significance was evaluated using
   conditional Monte Carlo simulation, and significant values of Q(i)(ph)
   were mapped to assess the variation of the risk of neighbourhood
   infection through the phases. Q(ikt) was larger for farms in Lombardy
   and the reduction of exposed farms was more marked for Veneto. Although
   the highest value of Q(i)(ph) was observed in Veneto, in each phase most
   of the significant values were in Lombardy. In the last phase of the
   epidemic, a large reduction in the number of farms significantly exposed
   to the risk of neighbourhood infection was observed in the Veneto
   region, along with generally low values of Q(i)(ph). This may be
   explained by differences in control measures in the two regions,
   including pre-emptive slaughtering of farms considered at high risk of
   infection. The Q statistic allowed us to quantify geographic,
   time-dynamic variations in exposure to neighbourhood infection, and to
   generate hypotheses on the efficacy of control measures. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Honey, produced by Apis mellifera from nectar or honeydew, contains a
   discrete quantity of water (about 17\%). The variability of water
   content influences the quality, the stability, the workability and the
   storage of honey. Moisture in honey is usually measured via
   determination of refractive index (111): from the value measured, the
   percentage is calculated by an empirical formula or by ``conversion{''}
   table. A possible alternative approach is the Karl Fischer Titration
   (KFT). The objective of this work was to find the optimal parameters for
   water determination in honey with KFT without any heat treatment of
   sample or working medium and the measurement of water content in more
   than 100 honeys of different botanical origin, using RI and KFT
   determinations. The water content, obtained with KFT, was usually higher
   than that determined by RI analysis. According to our results KFT seems
   to be the most reliable method. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{P>Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is one of the most
   widespread of all medically important arboviruses with ticks of the
   Hyalomma spp. serving as the main vectors. Infection of livestock by
   CCHFV serves as a route of exposure to humans, as a reservoir of disease
   and as a route of importation. This study discusses the pathways and
   data requirements for a qualitative risk assessment for the emergence of
   CCHFV in livestock in Europe. A risk map approach is proposed based on
   layers that include the potential routes of release (e.g. by migrating
   birds carrying infected ticks) together with the main components for
   exposure, namely the distributions of the tick vectors, the small
   vertebrate host reservoirs and the livestock. A layer on landscape
   fragmentation serves as a surrogate for proximity of livestock to the
   tick cycle. Although the impact of climate change on the emergence of
   CCHF is not clear, comparing the distribution of risk factors in each
   layer currently with those predicted in the 2080s with climate change
   can be used to speculate how potential high-risk areas may shift.
   According to the risk pathway, transstadial and/or transovarial
   transmission in the tick vector are crucial for CCHFV spread. Vector
   competence and tick vector switching, however, remain critical factors
   for CCHFV colonization of new regions in Europe. The species of
   migratory bird is also an important consideration in the release
   assessment with greater abundance and biodiversity of ground-dwelling
   birds in southern Europe than in northern Europe.}},

Abstract = {{In 1999, Italy experienced a devastating epidemic of high-pathogenicity
   avian influenza (HPAI) caused by an H7N1 virus subtype. After this
   epidemic, a ministerial decree was passed to implement control measures
   for low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) due to H5 and H7 subtypes.
   We investigated whether these control measures have decreased the public
   expenditure associated with epidemics of LPAI and HPAI by comparing the
   direct and consequential losses of the 1999 epidemic to the losses
   associated with successive epidemics. The estimated total economic
   burden of the epidemics was about (sic)650 million ((sic)217 million in
   direct losses and (sic)433 million in consequential losses). The 1999
   epidemic accounted for most of these losses ((sic)507 million: (sic)112
   million in direct losses and (sic)395 million in consequential losses),
   whereas the total economic burden for the 5 successive LPAI was (sic)143
   million ((sic)105 million in direct losses and (sic)38 million in
   consequential losses). These results demonstrate that the implementation
   of a coordinated set of disease-control measures, which included both
   emergency and prophylactic vaccination, was able to reduce the overall
   costs associated with avian influenza epidemics. The results also show
   that the application of adequate LPAI control measures may limit the
   risk of emergence of an HPAI virus in an area with a high poultry
   density, allowing the complete disruption of the poultry market and its
   huge associated costs to be avoided.}},

Abstract = {{Complete genome sequences were determined for two strains of avian
   paramyxovirus serotype 6 (APMV-6): the prototype Hong Kong (HK) strain
   and a more recent isolate from Italy (IT4524-2). The genome length of
   strain HK is 16236 nucleotide (nt), which is the same as for the other
   two APMV-6 strains (FE and 7W) that have been reported to date, whereas
   that of strain IT4524-2 is 16230 nt. The length difference in strain
   IT4524-2 is due to a 6-nt deletion in the downstream untranslated region
   of the F gene. All of these viruses follow the ``rule of six{''}. Each
   genome consists of seven genes in the order of 3'N-P-M-F-SH-HN-L5',
   which differs from other APMV serotypes in containing an additional gene
   encoding the small hydrophobic (SH) protein. Sequence comparisons
   revealed that strain IT4524-2 shares an unexpectedly low level of genome
   nt sequence identity (70\%) and aggregate predicted amino acid (aa)
   sequence identity (79\%) with other three strains, which in contrast are
   more closely related to each other with nt sequence 94-98\% nt identity
   and 90-100\% aggregate aa identity. Sequence analysis of the F-SH-HN
   genome region of two other recent Italian isolates showed that they fall
   in the HK/FE/TW group. The predicted signal peptide of IT4524-2 F
   protein lacks the N-terminal first 10 aa that are present in the other
   five strains. Also, the F protein cleavage site of strain IT4524-2, (R)
   under bar EP (R) under bar down arrow L, has two dibasic aa (arginine,
   R) compared to the monobasic F protein cleavage site of PEP (R) under
   bar down arrow L. in the other strains. Reciprocal
   cross-hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays using post-infection
   chicken sera indicated that strain IT4524-2 is antigenically related to
   the other APMV-6 strains, but with 4- to 8-fold lower HI tiers for the
   test sera between strain IT4524-2 and the other APMV-6 strains. Taken
   together, our results indicated that the APMV-6 strains represents a
   single serotype with two subgroups that differ substantially based on nt
   and aa sequences and can be distinguished by HI assay. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Newcastle disease (ND) is an OIE listed disease caused by virulent avian
   paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1) strains, which affect many species of
   birds and may cause severe economic losses in the poultry sector. The
   disease has been officially and unofficially reported in many African
   countries and still remains the main poultry disease in commercial and
   rural chickens of Africa. Unfortunately, virological and epidemiological
   information concerning ND strains circulating in the Western and Central
   regions of Africa is extremely scarce. In the present study, sequence
   analysis, pathotyping and detailed genetic characterization of virulent
   ND strains detected in rural poultry in West and Central Africa revealed
   the circulation of a new genetic lineage, distinguishable from the
   lineages described in the Eastern and Southern parts of the continent.
   Several mismatches were observed in the segment of the matrix gene
   targeted by the primers and probe designed for the molecular detection
   of APMV-1, which were responsible for the false negative results in the
   diagnostic test conducted. Furthermore, deduced amino acid sequences of
   the two major antigens eliciting a protective immune response (F and HN
   glycoprotein) revealed protein similarities <90\% if compared to some
   common vaccine strains. Distinct mutations located in the neutralizing
   epitopes were revealed, indicating the need for detailed assessment of
   the efficacy of the current vaccines and vaccination practices in
   Africa. The present investigation provides important information on the
   epidemiology, diagnosis and control of NDV in Africa and highlights the
   importance of supporting surveillance in developing countries for
   transboundary animal diseases. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Honey bee and colony mortality have been reported for several years in
   many countries as well as in Italy. In the last years this phenomenon
   has become increasingly serious, and several hypotheses have been
   proposed to explain honey bee and colony losses. These hypotheses relate
   to pests and diseases, pesticides, apicultural practices, climate
   change, electromagnetic fields, GMO crops, etc. Honey bee colony losses
   are being surveyed in several European countries, but these surveys are
   not sufficiently structured. Based on beekeepers' reports, honey bee
   losses in Italy follow a clear seasonal pattern: a) during spring and
   summer colonies lose many foragers due to agrochemicals (bee losses); b)
   from late summer to winter, the impact of pests (including Varroa) and
   pathogens becomes more important (colony losses). To assess the extent
   and investigate the possible causes of honey bee and colony losses in
   Italy a national monitoring network needs to be established. Target
   apiaries will be distributed in selected sites (modules), ideally one
   per region, to cover the national territory. Each module, composed of
   five apiaries with ten non-migratory, colonies each, will be chosen
   based on environmental characteristics with a distance to the center a
   the module of bout 50 km. Colonies will be visually inspected four times
   a year (right after winter spring, Runnier and just before winter). In
   each inspection several parameters of each colony will be considered
   health and nutritional condition, number of bees and brood, and queen's
   age. The person in charge of each module will input the information
   obtained in a real-time database available on the Internet. In addition,
   dead and live bees, as well as several beehive matrices (brood, pollen,
   wax) will be collected during each inspection for chemical, pollen and
   disease analyses. The information collected through this honey-bee
   monitoring network will provide a broad database from which to explore
   patterns of disease, toxic exposure and management practices that may be
   linked to the occurrence of honey bee and colony losses. APENET aims at
   providing an accurate assessment of the overall health condition of
   honey bees at the national level.}},

   functional adjustments and heritable adaptive changes. In order to
   investigate possible differences in immune system capabilities, we
   analyzed by qPCR the expression levels of 4 immune genes (defensin,

   Mytilus galloprovincialis collected in 3 European farming areas
   \{Atlantic Ocean-Ria de Vigo-Spain (RV), French Mediterranean Gulf of

   (VI)\} in response to one injection of one of the 3 bacterial species
   (Vibrio splendidus LGP32. Vibrio anguillarum, Micrococcus
   lysodeikticus), and to heat shock or cold stress. We confirmed that the
   5 genes are constitutively expressed in hemocytes, defensin being the
   less expressed, myticin B the highest. As suspected, the same gene
   resulted differently expressed according to mussel group, with the
   biggest difference being for HSP70 and lysozyme and lowest expression of
   all the 5 genes in mussels from RV. In addition, gene expression levels
   varied according to the challenge. Most frequent effect of bacterial
   injections was down-regulation, especially for mytilin B and myticin B.
   Heat shock enhanced transcript levels, particularly in mussels from RV,
   whereas cold stress had no effect. In situ hybridization of labelled
   probes on mussel hemocytes indicated that bacterial injections did not
   change the mRNA patterns of defensin and myticin B whereas mytilin B
   mRNA almost disappeared. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that
   constitutive level, nature and intensity of immune gene expression
   regulations strongly depended from mussel group, and support the concept
   of gene environment interactions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Highly pathogenic A/H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI H5N1) viruses have
   seriously affected the Nigerian poultry industry since early 2006.
   Previous studies have identified multiple introductions of the virus
   into Nigeria and several reassortment events between cocirculating
   lineages. To determine the spatial, evolutionary, and population
   dynamics of the multiple H5N1 lineages cocirculating in Nigeria, we
   conducted a phylogenetic analysis of whole-genome sequences from 106
   HPAI H5N1 viruses isolated between 2006 and 2008 and representing all 25
   Nigerian states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) reporting
   outbreaks. We identified a major new subclade in Nigeria that is
   phylogenetically distinguishable from all previously identified
   sublineages, as well as two novel reassortment events. A detailed
   analysis of viral phylogeography identified two major source populations
   for the HPAI H5N1 virus in Nigeria, one in a major commercial poultry
   area (southwest region) and one in northern Nigeria, where contact
   between wild birds and backyard poultry is frequent. These findings
   suggested that migratory birds from Eastern Europe or Russia may serve
   an important role in the introduction of HPAI H5N1 viruses into Nigeria,
   although virus spread through the movement of poultry and poultry
   products cannot be excluded. Our study provides new insight into the
   genesis and evolution of H5N1 influenza viruses in Nigeria and has
   important implications for targeting surveillance efforts to rapidly
   identify the spread of the virus into and within Nigeria.}},

Abstract = {{The ongoing animal and human health crises caused by influenza viruses
   of H5N1 subtype have focused the attention of international
   organizations and donors on the need for improved veterinary
   infrastructure in developing countries and the need for improved
   communication between the human and animal health sectors. The
   circulation and re-emergence of high-pathogenicity avian influenza
   viruses of H5N1 subtype are still major concerns because of potential
   effects on human health, on the profitability of poultry industries, and
   on the livelihood of the rural environment. Significant improvements
   toward the management of these outbreaks have occurred worldwide,
   including new legislative tools, intervention strategies, and
   investments in capacity building in both developed and developing
   countries. This has led to a greater understanding of certain aspects of
   this infection and of its pandemic potential, although we are still far
   from certainties and from resolving the situation. Given that genetic
   analysis of the viruses causing human pandemics since the beginning of
   the 20th century have indicated that at least the hemagglutinin gene was
   donated from an avian progenitor virus, it would seem reasonable to
   exploit the information we have from an animal health perspective to
   support public health policies. Possibly the biggest challenge we have
   is to find novel ways to maximize the use of the information that is
   generated as a result of the improved networking and diagnostic
   capacities. In the era of globalization, emerging and re-emerging
   diseases of public health relevance are a concern to developing and
   developed countries and are a real threat because of the interdependence
   of the global economy. Communication and analysis systems currently
   available should be tailored to meet global health priorities, and used
   to develop and constantly improve novel systems for the exploitation of
   information to generate knowledge. Another fundamental task the
   veterinary community needs to deliver on is that of bringing relevant
   information to international discussion tables at which international
   control and prevention are presented and optimized. The veterinary
   community has knowledge and areas of expertise that should undoubtedly
   be part of strategic decisions and are essential to manage the human and
   animal health implications of avian influenza infections.}},

Abstract = {{Since 1999, the Italian poultry production system has experienced
   several outbreaks of avian influenza (AI), mainly located in
   northeastern Italy. This paper describes the low pathogenicity (LP) AI
   outbreaks detected during the surveillance activities implemented in
   2007-08. From May to October 2007, ten rural and hobby poultry farms
   were infected by an LPAI virus of the H7N3 subtype. In August-October
   2007, the H7N3 LPAI virus was introduced into the industrial poultry
   sector with the involvement of six meat turkey farms. Phylogenetic
   analysis of the hemagglutinin gene indicated that all but one of the
   H7N3 virus strains had a high level of homology (98.7\%-99.8\%).
   Furthermore, in August 2007, an LPAI H5N2 virus was identified in a
   free-range geese and duck breeder flock. The hemagglutinin and
   neuraminidase genes showed a high level of homology (99.8\% and 99.9\%,
   respectively) with H5N2 LPAI viruses isolated from mallards in July 2007
   in the same area, suggesting a possible introduction from the wild
   reservoir. All the birds (in total 129:386) on the infected poultry
   farms were culled. The prompt implementation of AI control measures,
   including the enforcement of a targeted emergency vaccination plan,
   allowed the rapid eradication of infection. In 2008, three LPAI viruses
   (two H7N1 and one H5N1) were identified in dealer/rural farms. The
   surveillance activity implemented in this area allowed the prompt
   detection of LPAI viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes in the rural sector,
   which, as observed in the 2007 epidemic, might be the source of
   infection for industrial poultry.}},

   PQGERRRKKR{*}GLE typical of El PAL molecular markers associated with
   increased adaptation and virulence in mammals, as well as susceptibility
   to neuraminidase inhibitors, were revealed in the HA, neuraminidase

   HA and NA genomic segments. H5N1 viruses circulating in Poland all
   belong to lineage 2.2. However, isolates isolated in 2006 were
   genetically distinct from those isolated in 2007 and grouped in
   different sublineages. H5N1 viruses isolated from wild birds in 2006 are
   almost identical to each other (99.9\% HA; 99.6\%-100\% NA), and they
   are grouped within a cluster of viruses isolated in Germany from wild
   and domestic birds and mammals in 2006. Isolates from 2007 are also
   closely related to each other (nucleotide homologies 99.9\% and 100\%
   for HA and NA, respectively), and they are grouped together with
   isolates from wild and domestic birds collected in Eastern and Central
   Europe (Romania, Germany), and the Middle East (Kuwait, Saudi Arabia).
   Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences related to the internal proteins
   confirmed the results obtained for the HA and NA genes. Overall, the
   results indicate that HPAI H5N1 in Poland in 2006-07 was caused by at
   least two separate incursions of genetically distinct viruses.}},

   samples collected from a previously infected group. Quails and turkeys
   were susceptible to infection for 10 serial passages, whereas chickens
   were susceptible to two cycles of infection only. Infection of chicken
   with the quail- and turkey-adapted viruses showed an increased

   North Sea. From the treatment parameters studied, a combination of 300
   MPa for 5 min resulted as being capable of inactivating 100\% of the
   larvae present in the tissues of the fish treated. Biomolecular
   examination confirmed their main belonging to the species Anisakis
   simplex sensu stricto.
   The use of this technology is for the treatment of other fatty fish such
   as sardines and anchovies prior to marinating. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A 6-year-old ferret (Mustela putorius furo) was presented with abdominal
   enlargement. Clinical examination revealed an intra-abdominal mass
   measuring approximately 5 cm in diameter. Abdominal survey radiographs
   revealed a sharply marginated mass with multifocal radiodense foci,
   suggestive of pathologic calcification. A complete blood cell count
   revealed a moderate, normocytic, normochromic, nonregenerative anemia.
   The mass was surgically removed en bloc, fixed in 10\% neutral buffered
   formalin solution, and routinely processed for histologic and
   immunohistochemical investigation. The neoplastic tissue consisted of a
   mixed neoplastic cell population, including osteosarcoma and
   librosarcoma components. Immunohistochemistry revealed that both
   neoplastic cell populations were positive for vimentin and negative for
   actin (smooth and striated), desmin, and myoglobin. Nonabsorbable suture
   material was admixed with the neoplastic tissue in the histologic
   section. This material was birefringent when viewed microscopically

   the database allows us to analyse the pathways of distribution in Europe
   over time. The results suggest that in most of the recent cases, spread

Title = {{Avian influenza virus monitoring in wintering waterbirds in Iran,
   2003-2007}},
Journal = {{VIROLOGY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: Virological, molecular and serological studies were carried
   out to determine the status of infections with avian influenza viruses
   (AIV) in different species of wild waterbirds in Iran during 2003-2007.
   Samples were collected from 1146 birds representing 45 different species
   with the majority of samples originating from ducks, coots and
   shorebirds. Samples originated from 6 different provinces representative
   for the 15 most important wintering sites of migratory waterbirds in
   Iran.
   Results: Overall, AIV were detected in approximately 3.4\% of the
   samples. However, prevalence was higher (up to 8.3\%) at selected
   locations and for certain species. No highly pathogenic avian influenza,
   including H5N1 was detected. A total of 35 AIVs were detected from
   cloacal or oropharyngeal swab samples. These positive samples originated
   mainly from Mallards and Common Teals. Of 711 serum samples tested for
   AIV antibodies, 345 (48.5\%) were positive by using a
   nucleoprotein-specific competitive ELISA (NP-C-ELISA). Ducks including
   Mallard, Common Teal, Common Pochard, Northern Shoveler and Eurasian
   Wigeon revealed the highest antibody prevalence ranging from 44 to 75\%.
   Conclusion: Results of these investigations provide important
   information about the prevalence of LPAIV in wild birds in Iran,
   especially wetlands around the Caspian Sea which represent an important
   wintering site for migratory water birds. Mallard and Common Teal
   exhibited the highest number of positives in virological and serological
   investigations: 43\% and 26\% virological positive cases and 24\% and
   46\% serological positive reactions, respectively. These two species may
   play an important role in the ecology and perpetuation of influenza
   viruses in this region. In addition, it could be shown that both
   oropharyngeal and cloacal swab samples contribute to the detection of
   positive birds, and neither should be neglected.}},

Abstract = {{The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence of total and

   different geographical areas of the Adriatic Sea and to determine their
   serotypes, toxigenic profiles and pandemic potential. Out of 559 samples
   analysed during 2007, 65 (11.6\%) were positive for V. parahaemolyticus.
   None of the isolates had the genes for thermostable direct haemolysin
   (tdh) and pandemic marker (toxRS), while five strains (7.7\%) had that
   for TDH-related haemolysin (trh). Regarding geographical location of the
   toxigenic strains, three were from the Adriatic coast of Puglia, one
   from Veneto, and one from the Marches. The trh-positive V.
   parahaemolyticus isolates from Puglia belonged to O1:KUT (2/3) and
   O1:K37(1/3) serotypes, the trh-positive isolate from the Marches to
   OUT(O untypeable):KUT serotype, and that from Veneto to O3:KUT. The
   prevalence of trh-positive V. parahaemolyticus obtained from mussels in
   this study was higher respect to that reported in previous studies from

Abstract = {{Naive sea bass juveniles (38.4 +/- 4.5 g) were intramuscularly infected
   with a sublethal dose of betanodavirus isolate 378/103, followed after
   43 days by a similar boosting. This infection resulted in an overall
   mortality of 7.6\%. At various intervals, sampling of fish tissues was
   performed to investigate: i) B and T lymphocyte content in organs and
   tissues; ii), proliferation of leucocytes re-stimulated in vitro with
   inactivated virus; iii) presence of serum antibody specific for
   betanodavirus; iv) expression of genes coding for the following
   immunoregulatory molecules involved in innate and acquired responses:
   type I IFN, Mx, IL-1, Cox-2; IL-10, TGF-beta, TCR beta, CD4, CD8 alpha,
   IgM, by using a quantitative PCR array system developed for sea bass.
   The obtained results showed a detectable increase of T cells and B cells
   in PBL during betanodavirus infection. Furthermore, leucocytes obtained
   from blood, head kidney, and gills showed a detectable ``in vitro{''}
   increase in viability upon addition of inactivated viral particles, as
   determined by measuring intracellular ATP concentration. ELISA analysis
   of sera showed that exposure to nodavirus induced a low, but specific
   antibody titer measured 43 days after infection, despite the presence of
   measurable levels of natural antibody. Finally, a strong upregulation of
   genes coding for type I IFN, Mx, and IgM was identified after both
   infection and boosting. interestingly, an upregulation of Cox-2 until
   boosting, and of TGF-beta and IL-10 after boosting was also observed,
   while the other tested genes did not show any significant variations
   with respect to mock-treated fish. Overall, our work represents a first
   comprehensive analysis of cellular and molecular immune parameters in a
   fish species exposed to a pathogenic virus. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is employed as a human vaccine
   vector for the high expression of heterologous genes and the lack of
   replication in mammalian cells. This study demonstrates that cells
   infected by recombinant viruses can be obtained by
   fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Recombinant viruses are generated
   by a swapping event between a red fluorescent protein gene in the
   acceptor virus and a plasmid cassette coding for both a green
   fluorescent marker and a transgene. To prevent the carry-over of
   parental virus, due to superinfection of the cells harbouring
   recombinant viruses, the sorting is performed on cells infected at low
   m.o.i. in the presence of a reversible inhibitor of viral particle
   release. Terminal dilution cloning is then used to isolate both green
   and marker-free recombinant viruses, which can be identified by
   whole-plate fluoroimaging. The differential visualization of all the
   viral types involved allows a stepwise monitoring of all recombinations
   and leads to a straightforward and efficient flow cytometry-based cell
   sorting purification protocol. As an example of the efficacy of this
   sorting procedure, the construction of rMVA's coding for the rat nuclear
   protein HMGB1 and H5N1 influenza A virus hemagglutinin is reported. The
   entire recombinant MVA production process is carried out in serum-free
   media employing primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF), which are
   certified for the preparation of human vaccines. This rMVA production
   method is faster, simpler and more reliable than any other available
   procedure for obtaining safe vaccine stocks for human use. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{In cattle fattening, the illicit use of growth promoters (GPs)
   represents a major problem. The synthetic corticosteroid dexamethasone
   (DEX) is the GP mostly used, alone or in combination with other steroids
   or beta-agonists. Recently, GPs were shown to disrupt some cattle
   cytochromes P450 (CYPs) at the post-transcriptional level; therefore,
   the effects of two illicit protocols containing DEX (alone or together
   with 17 beta-estradiol, 17 beta E) upon main cattle liver drug
   metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) mRNAs and related transcription factors were
   investigated by quantitative real time RTPCR. Eleven genes, out of the
   18 considered, were significantly modulated by GPs.
   Corticosteroid-responsive genes did not respond univocally, whereas
   retinoic X receptor alpha (RXR alpha) and estrogen receptor alpha (ER
   alpha) were upregulated depending on the illicit protocol used.
   Nowadays, an increasing interest has been noticed toward the detection
   of biomarkers of response (BMRs) to be used in the screening of GPs
   misuse in cattle farming. In the present study, CYP2B6-like, CYP2E1,
   glutathione S-transferase A1- and sulfatransferase A1-like (GSTA1- and
   SULT1A1-like) mRNAs were significantly modulated regardless of the GP,
   the illicit protocol, and the animal breed, representing promising BMRs.
   The usefulness of,these BMRs needs to be characterized more in depth.}},

   Hadar is known to colonise only the gut and is classified as

Abstract = {{A new approach to define education tools for public health communication
   was set up by the Veneto Region since 2008, in collaboration with the
   Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie, in order to
   implement a network of expertise and knowledge that could be useful for
   the citizens. Actions were planned in order to increase people's
   knowledge adults and school-aged children of food risks and nutritional
   aspects of products, to promote correct food practices, and to encourage
   healthy lifestyle, through effective messages to consumers. Training
   programmes and information interventions in which safety food and
   nutrition topics were aptly illustrated also with practical labs, were
   performed by public health operators and nutritionists, for adult
   consumers by means of public seminars held in all the Provinces of the
   Veneto Region. Primary and middle schools were involved in workshops in
   which teachers and students designed media products on food safety and
   nutrition. Workshops were conducted by the staff of the Department of
   Education Sciences of University of Padua. Finally, a website -
   www.alimentinsalute.it - was created for the complete availability of
   the information and to gather all the experiences. This website was
   intended as a meeting place for consumers to interact to each other, as
   well as a trust-building place to strengthen the public health
   information policies for consumers. Actions and training programmes made
   participants either more aware of food safety and more responsive to
   alimentary behaviours, through an enduring strategy tailored to the
   consumer and his needs. The project will continue through 2011.}},

Abstract = {{Since 2006 Egypt has been facing an extensive epidemic of H5N1 highly
   pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) with a huge number of outbreaks both
   in rural and intensively reared poultry areas. The use of efficacious
   vaccines in this country has been, and still remains, essential for the
   control and possible eradication of HPAI. The present study was
   performed to establish whether the administration of inactivated
   vaccines containing an H5 virus belonging to a different lineage to the
   Eurasian H5N1 HPAI viruses guarantees protection from clinical signs,
   provides significant immune response and is able to achieve a reduction
   of viral shedding in the face of a challenge with a contemporary H5N1
   virus isolated in Egypt. Despite the genetic and antigenic differences
   between the vaccine strain (H5N2/Mexico) and the challenge strain
   (H5N1/Egypt), confirmed by molecular and serological (haemagglutination
   inhibition) tests, it was established that the immune response induced
   by these conventional vaccines is sufficient to prevent infection in the
   majority of birds challenged with a contemporary H5N1 Egyptian strain.
   The data reported in this study also indicate that there may be a low
   degree of correlation between haemagglutination inhibition titres,
   clinical protection and reduction of shedding.}},

Abstract = {{Vaccination against avian influenza (AI) is now included amongst the
   prevention and control measures recommended by international animal
   health organizations to combat the disease in poultry. For optimal
   control of human influenza infections, the antigenic variability within
   subtypes requires the annual update of seed strains for inclusion in
   vaccines. The decisions taken are based on serological cross-reactivity
   of viral strains measured by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests.
   The reason for this is to ensure that the vaccine contains strains that
   are related antigenically to the current circulating field strain as
   field viruses evolve or are substituted by variants of distinct
   antigenicity. Such an annual approach is not viable economically for the
   poultry industry. In the current study, we have applied a similar
   HI-based approach to demonstrate, as proof of principle, that
   cross-reactive strains can be identified. Applying the same approach
   used by the World Health Organization to investigate antigenic
   differences among human influenza viruses, we assessed the serological
   cross-reactivity of a selection of natural H5 and H7 subtype viruses.
   Analysing HI data, we have identified strains that are cross-reactive
   and may have the potential to act as seed viruses for future vaccine
   development. This study should be considered a starting point for a more
   informed approach to the selection of seed strains for the development
   of avian influenza vaccines against field infections caused by viruses
   of H5 and H7 subtypes.}},

Abstract = {{A rapid fowl adenovirus (FAdV) classification method based on a 30-bp
   sequence of the hexon loop (L1) was developed using the pyrosequencing
   technique. FAdV identification is relevant for epidemiological studies
   and for the adoption of a correct strategy where vaccination is to be
   used for the control of the disease. FAdV typing is usually performed
   using polymerase chain reaction coupled with either conventional DNA
   sequencing or restriction enzyme analysis; however, both methods can be
   time consuming and/or very expensive to be used as a routine tool. In
   the present study, polymerase chain reaction and subsequent pyrosequence
   analysis of the variable hexon L1 region were assessed in order to
   rapidly differentiate FAdV species. Forty-nine FAdV samples (22
   reference strains and 27 field isolates) were tested and the results
   were compared with those obtained by conventional DNA sequencing. The
   results clearly demonstrated that pyrosequence analysis provides a new
   approach for a rapid differentiation and classification of the FAdV
   species that is faster, more cost-effective and easier to interpret than
   other techniques commonly used.}},

Abstract = {{Fish pasteurellosis is an infectious disease that affects several fish
   species living in marine temperate waters. Its causative agent is the
   Gram-negative bacterium Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp).
   Fish pasteurellosis represents a serious health problem for the majority
   of intensive sea bream hatcheries, with 90-100\% mortality during
   disease outbreaks. Larvae and juveniles are the most susceptible stages.
   A potential strategy to prevent fish pasteurellosis is to select for
   animals that are genetically resistant to it. The aim of this work was
   to evaluate the genetic variation of disease resistance and growth in
   the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata L.). An experimental population,
   approximately 3500 animals originating from mass spawning of four
   broodstocks, was experimentally infected with a highly virulent strain
   of Phdp. Mortality was monitored daily for 19 days. Upon completion of
   the challenge experiment, genetic profiles at nine microsatellite loci
   were obtained for 1753 animals and for all (256) broodstock fish, for
   parentage assignment. A subset of families defined by means of genetic
   analysis was used to calculate heritability for survival to infection.
   For body length (measured post-mortem), heritability was 0.38 +/- 0.07.
   The heritability for disease resistance varied depending on how
   resistance was defined. Heritability was 0.12 +/- 0.04 for days of
   survival post challenge, defined as a continuous trait. while it ranged
   from 0.45 +/- 0.04 to 0.18 +/- 0.08 for the binary trait dead/alive at a
   specific day. The genetic correlation between body length and survival
   was positive and significant (r = 0.61 +/- 0.16). These results confirm
   the existence of genetic variation for growth and resistance against
   Phpd and highlight also the potential for selective breeding programs to
   improve these traits. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Chlamydophila abortus (C. abortus) infection is related to reproductive
   failure in domestic ruminants. Although it has not been well
   characterized worldwide, this pathogen has already been identified in
   some European countries and in the USA. In Brazil, preliminary studies
   have shown serological evidence of C. abortus infection in herds with
   low antibody prevalence. Until now, the identification of C. abortus in
   biological samples from females presenting reproductive failures has not
   been described in Brazilian herds of domestic ruminants. The aim of this
   study was to evaluate the presence of the C. abortus in a collection of
   abortions from cattle (n=85), sheep (n=12), and goats (n=8), in samples
   of vaginal mucus from cows (n=13), sheep (n=90), and goats (n=20), and
   in semen from sheep (n=10) and goats (n=5). The specimens (n=243) were
   evaluated using a PCR assay developed to amplify the 16S-23S rRNA
   intergenic space of C. abortus. A PCR assay with an internal control,
   which amplifies a fragment from the ND5 gene of bovine mitochondrial
   DNA, was used in order to evaluate the efficiency of the DNA extraction
   and of the PCR reaction. All biological samples (n=243) included in this
   study were negative for C. abortus in the PCR assay. The internal
   control enabled the amplification of a product from the bovine
   mitochondrial ND5 gene in all cattle abortion samples (n=85). Given the
   serological evidence indicating the presence of C. abortus infection in
   Brazilian herds of domestic ruminants, and considering the wide sampling
   evaluated, the failure to identify C. abortus in this survey suggests
   that the frequency of clinical signs in infected animals may be low or
   even absent.}},

Title = {{Use of serum amyloid A and milk amyloid A in the diagnosis of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF DAIRY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{76}},

Abstract = {{Mastitis is the most frequent and costly disease in dairy herds, as it
   negatively affects yield and milk quality. The presence of clinical
   mastitis is quite easy to asses, whereas the diagnosis of the
   subclinical form can be more difficult and requires laboratory assays.
   Somatic cell count (SCC) is widely used as a rapid and low-cost
   indicator of mastitis, even if is not useful in discriminating between
   the clinical and subclinical form. As amyloid A has been investigated as
   a marker of mastitis, the aim of this study was to assess the potential
   value of measuring amyloid A in serum and milk and the correlation with
   SCC in the diagnosis of subclinical mastitis. The reliability of two
   different ELISA kits for the measurement of amyloid A in milk was also
   tested. During a 1-month trial period, 21 cows were assigned to three
   experimental groups according to their health status: 6 cows with
   clinical mastitis (CM), 10 cows with subclinical mastitis (SM) and 5
   healthy cows (HE). Amyloid A was measured both in serum (SAA) and in
   quarter milk samples (mAA) with a serum ELISA kit, and in quarter milk
   samples (MAA) with a milk ELISA kit. SCC, total microbial count (TMC)
   and bacterial examination of the milk were also carried out. After a log
   transformation, the data were submitted to ANOVA and linear regression.
   TMC was significantly higher in cows with clinical mastitis, while no
   differences were observed between the other two experimental groups. SCC
   and MAA levels were significantly different among the three groups. mAA
   concentrations were similar between cows with subclinical and clinical
   mastitis, and SAA was not affected by mastitis. A significant
   correlation between SCC and MAA or mAA was detected, while no
   correlation was recorded between SAA and mAA. A close relationship
   between MAA and mAA was noticeable even at low concentrations,
   suggesting MAA as a potential physiological marker of subclinical
   mastitis.}},

Abstract = {{A 1-year-old, intact, male dwarf rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) was
   vaccinated against myxomatosis and rabbit viral hemorrhagic disease in
   February 1999, and a localized reaction appeared in the same anatomic
   site within a few days. No regression was observed after subcutaneous
   antibiotic treatment. The rabbit was kept under observation, and the
   swelling apparently disappeared in 3 months. The owner then decided to
   avoid any further subcutaneous drug administration. The referring
   veterinarian examined the animal on July 2006 for the sudden appearance
   of a nodular, 4.5 cm x 3.5 cm x 2.0 cm, subcutaneous mass located over
   the interscapular space. Fine-needle aspiration was performed, and a
   population of neoplastic spindle cells, rare pleomorphic multinucleated
   cells, and rare leukocytes were observed. The mass was surgically
   removed, fixed in 10\% neutral buffered formalin, and routinely
   processed for histologic, histochemical, and immunohistochemical
   diagnostic investigation. The neoplastic tissue exhibited fascicles
   composed of malignant spindle-shaped cells with elongated to oval
   hyperchromatic nuclei and scant cytoplasm. Occasional multinucleated
   cells were also observed. The neoplastic cells were immunoreactive for
   vimentin but did not stain for smooth muscle actin, desmin, myoglobin,
   and cytokeratins (AE1/AE3). Moreover, the histochemical stain for
   aluminum was positive. The diagnosis was fibrosarcoma based on
   morphologic and immunohistochemical results. The histologic features of
   this neoplasm were remarkably similar to feline injection-site sarcoma.}},

Abstract = {{Astroviruses have been described in several animals species frequently
   associated with diarrhoea, especially in young animals. In dogs,
   astrovirus-like particles have been observed sporadically and very
   little is known about their epidemiology and characteristics. In this
   paper, we describe the detection of astrovirus-like particles in
   symptomatic puppies. Furthermore, for the first time in this species,
   the presumptive identification made by electron microscopy was confirmed
   by genetic analysis of the viral RNA conducted directly on the clinical
   specimens. Genetic sequences of ORF2 (2443 nt), encoding for the capsid
   protein, and partial sequence of ORF1b (346 nt), encoding for the viral
   polymerase, identified the viruses as member of the family Astroviridae.
   The phylogenetic analysis clearly clustered canine astroviruses in the
   genus Mamastrovirus. Relative closest similarities were revealed with a
   cluster comprising human, porcine and feline astroviruses, based on the
   ORF2 sequences available. Based on the species definition for
   astroviruses and on the data obtained in this study, we suggest a new
   species of astrovirus - canine astrovirus, CaAstV - to be included in
   the genus Mamastrovirus. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Animal tumour registry of two provinces in northern Italy: incidence of
   spontaneous tumours in dogs and cats}},
Journal = {{BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Cancer is a major cause of death in domestic animals.
   Furthermore, many forms of pet neoplasm resemble that of their human
   counterparts in biologic behaviour, pathologic expression, and
   recognised risk factors. In April 2005, a pilot project was activated so
   as to establish a dog and cat tumour registry living in the Venice and
   Vicenza provinces (Veneto Region, north-eastern Italy), with the aim of
   estimating the incidence of spontaneous tumours.
   Results: Through a telephone survey, the estimates of canine and feline
   populations of the catchment area turned out to be of 296,318 (CI +/-
   30,201) and 214,683 (CI +/- 21,755) subjects, respectively. During the
   first three years, overall 2,509 canine and 494 feline cases of
   neoplasia were diagnosed. In dogs, the estimated annual incidence rate
   (IR) per 100,000 dogs for all tumours was 282 in all the catchment area,
   whereas in cats the IR was much lower (IR = 77). Malignant and benign
   tumours were equally distributed in male and female dogs, whereas cats
   had a 4.6-fold higher incidence of malignant tumours than benign. In
   both dogs and cats, purebreds had an almost 2-fold higher incidence of
   malignant tumours than mixed breeds. Tumour incidence increased with age
   in both dog and cat populations.
   Conclusion: This study has provided estimates of incidence of
   spontaneous neoplasm in companion animals. Further attempts will be made
   to increase the accuracy in the population size assessment and to
   ascertain the real gap with the official regional canine demographic
   registry. Veterinary practitioners may also benefit from the tumour
   registry insofar they may obtain data for specific breeds, age groups or
   geographical areas.}},

Abstract = {{Dermatophytes are fungi that can be contagious and cause infections in
   the keratinized skin of mammals, including humans. The etiological
   diagnosis of dermatophytosis relies on a combination of in vitro-culture
   and microscopic methods. Effective molecular tools could overcome the
   limitations of conventional methods of identification. In the present
   study, following phenetic identification as M. canis, M. fulvum, M.
   gypseum, T mentagrophytes and T terrestre, we genetically characterized
   key dermatophytes, employing the sequences of the first and second
   internal transcribed spacers of nuclear ribosomal DNA as well as part of
   the chitin synthase-1 gene, and assessed the utility of these DNA
   regions (based on levels of nucleotide variation within and among
   species/taxa) as markers for the classification of species and
   genotypes. Employing partial chitin synthase-1 gene as the marker, we
   also established a PCR-coupled SSCP approach as a diagnostic/analytical
   mutation-scanning tool. This tool should facilitate fundamental
   investigations of the ecology, epidemiology and population genetics of
   dermatophytes and, importantly, should assist in allowing a more rapid
   diagnosis of dermatophytoses in humans and other animals, thus
   overcoming the significant delays in targeted chemotherapy following
   diagnosis using conventional methods. (Nucleotide sequence data reported

Abstract = {{Ulcerative enteritis or ``quail disease{''} is an acute clostridial
   infection of young birds reported in many avian species, chicken and
   turkey included. Clostridium colinum is the causative agent of
   ulcerative enteritis and because of the difficulties bound to the
   isolation and identification of this bacterium by means of classic
   bacteriological techniques, its detection appears very hard and the
   prevalence of this disease could be underestimated. To investigate the
   diffusion of C. colinum in enteric disease of birds, a recently
   developed PCR protocol was applied to 42 cultural broths previously
   inoculated with organs and intestinal samples collected from diseased
   subjects. PCR-positive broths were cultivated to attempt the isolation
   of C. colinum. Samples collected from positive birds were subjected to
   histological examinations. 4 birds (3 broilers chickens and 1 pigeon)
   resulted PCR-positive and, in one case, C. colinum was isolated. Gross
   and histological lesions of positive birds were compatible with those
   described in other ulcerative enteritis outbreaks. These preliminary
   results demonstrates that C. colinum is sporadically implicated in
   enteric diseases of broiler chickens (14.2\%). In addition, the PCR
   assay proved to be an useful and reliable instrument to support the
   diagnosis of ulcerative enteritis and to facilitate the isolation of C.

   isolated from chickens affected by NE, 54 from subjects affected by

   was NetB positive and 93\% (27/29) of these was isolated from birds
   affected by intestinal disorders. 16 NetB positive strains were obtained
   from chickens affected by NE (16/30), 9 from animals affected by other
   intestinal disorders (9/54) and 4 from healthy animals (4/22). A
   significant difference between the number of NetB positive strains
   isolated from animals affected by NE and healthy chickens has been
   observed (P=0.014). However, the finding that the 17.4\% of strains
   isolated from healthy chickens was also positive for NetB, confirm that
   other virulence factors could play an important role on NE appearance.}},

   Sperimentale delle Venezie (IZSVe) started an interlaboratory comparison
   program for food microbiological tests, known as ``Aqua, interlaboratory

   applies statistical methods to estimate homogeneity and stability,
   processes and evaluates the results. The proficiency testing results
   allow to evaluate the performance of the laboratories, to identify
   possible differences and non-conformity, to demonstrate the competence
   and the quality of results, in order to take suitable corrective and/or
   preventive action after the individuation of the causes. Moreover,
   elaborating the results of several proficiency testing by using the
   control chart method, it is possible to evaluate the trend of the
   laboratory and to verify that the results are in statistical quality
   control.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Salmonella is an important pathogen in domestic livestock, for the
   severity of the disease mid the risk of transmission to humans. Signs of
   clinical salmonellosis in cattle can include septicaemia, diarrhoea and
   abortion. Salmonellosis can affect cattle of every age, although the
   clinical disease is more common in calves. Laboratory diagnosis can be
   performed with bacteriological culture, PCR or serology. The main risk
   for introduction of Salmonella infection in a farm is the purchasing of
   asymptomatic shedders, consequently all the new cattle introduced in the
   farm should be isolated for 3 weeks and tested with a bacteriological
   culture. Another important risk factor, associated with Salmonella
   entrance in dairy farm, is the environmental contamination by
   synanthropic animals. The control measures to be applied include
   minimizing the possibility of contacts between all these animals and the
   cattle, and the use of rodent proof and bird proof feed storage, to
   avoid faecal contamination of feed. When the infection is recognized in
   a farm, several control measures should be adopted, but they can be
   summarized in the following points: test all the cattle of the farm,
   clean and sanitize all the barns and the equipment, improve housing and
   management of cattle, initiate control programs for rodents, flies, and
   feral cats. These measures, that should be adopted during an outbreak,
   follow two paths: to apply the risk analysis to all the steps of farm
   activity, and to control the risk, changing the housing systems and the
   management activities that can increase the risk of wide spreading and
   persistence of Salmonella in the farm.}},

Abstract = {{In 1999-2000, Italian poultry production was disrupted by an H7N1 virus
   subtype epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). The
   objectives of the present study were to identify risk factors for
   infection on poultry farms located in regions that had the highest
   number of outbreaks (Veneto and Lombardia) and the impact of pre-emptive
   culling as a complementary measure for eradicating infection. A Cox
   regression model that included spatial factors, such as the G index, was
   used. The results confirmed the relationship between risk of infection
   and poultry species, production type and size of farms. The
   effectiveness of pre-emptive culling was confirmed. An increased risk of
   infection was observed for poultry farms located near an infected farm
   and those at altitudes less than 150 in above sea level. The measures
   for the control and eradication of AI virus infection need to consider
   species differences in susceptibility, the types of production and the
   density of poultry farms in the affected areas. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The influence of unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) supplement on productive
   performance, physiochemical properties and fatty acid (FA) profile of
   milk, was investigated in lactating dairy cows fed with high fibre
   diets. According to a cross-over design, twelve cows were assigned to
   two experimental settings characterized by different FA profiles. Cows
   received a high fibre diet (similar to 42\% NDF on DM basis)
   supplemented with soybean based mixtures with these FA compositions:
   92.0\% of saturated FA (SFA), 2.8\% of monounsaturated FA (MUFA) and
   5.2\% of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) in the control diet (C-diet); 19.1\%
   of SFA, 20.9\% of MUFA and 60.0\% of PUFA in the experimental diet
   (E-diet).
   The E-diet did not affect dry matter intake nor milk yield. Milk
   composition and coagulation traits resulted similar between treatments,
   except for the lactose level, which was lower in the E-diet (5.0 vs
   4.8\%; P<0.05) and the freezing point (-0.546 vs -0.535 degrees C;
   P<0.05). As respects the milk FA profile, the E-diet significantly
   increased the percentage of UFA because of their greater amount in the
   ration; however the ``transfer{''} of UFA in milk was limited by the
   high level of FA biohydrogenation (BH) at the ruminal level. UFA showed
   low values of carry over in milk (67.5 vs 39.7\%; P<0.001) due to the
   saturation process; on the contrary SFA had a threefold increment (124
   vs 323\%; P<0.001), mostly due to a peak in the production of stearic
   acid. In this study, the percentage of CLA in milk (0.50 vs 0.62\%;
   P<0.05) was quite low for both diets, if compared with other studies,
   and this was probably due to a low vaccenic acid supply at duodenal
   level.}},

Abstract = {{When outbreaks of avian influenza (AI) occur in poultry populations, the
   main goal to achieve is the control and eradication of the infection.
   However, quantitative information on risk factors for AI spread and
   efficacy of AI control measures such as vaccination in the field is
   limited. From 2000 to 2005, H5 and H7 low pathogenicity (LP) AI viruses
   caused four epidemics in poultry in northeastern Italy. Italian
   veterinary authorities implemented emergency vaccination in the
   2000-2001 and 2002-2003 LPAI epidemics and prophylactic vaccination from
   July 2004.
   The aim of this study is to quantitatively evaluate the efficacy of AI
   vaccination in the field, taking into account the different strategies
   (emergency and prophylactic) implemented, Moreover, risk factors for
   LPAI spread in domestic poultry were studied.
   By survival analysis, we observed a two-fold increase in survival
   probability for vaccinated poultry farms compared to unvaccinated ones.
   In meat turkeys, vaccination protocols changed in the different
   epidemics, and a relationship between protection and the number of
   vaccinations was observed; two or three vaccine administrations
   protected flocks from LPAI, whilst four administrations did not
   significantly reduce the risk of infection.
   In meat turkeys the risk of AI infection increased also with the
   increase in both farm size and proximity to an infected farm. In
   general, we observed a lower number of outbreaks and a faster
   eradication of the infection when LPAI viruses introduced in a
   preventively vaccinated poultry population.
   This study provides insights on LPAI vaccination efficacy and on risk
   factors involved in LPAI infection at farm level. To our knowledge, this
   is the first study which quantitatively evaluates AI vaccination
   efficacy and compares different vaccination strategies and protocols
   using field data. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   profiles, and genetic relatedness of 125 ExPEC strains recovered from
   humans (61 were ciprofloxacin susceptible and 64 were ciprofloxacin
   resistant) and 113 E. coli strains recovered from poultry (47 were
   ciprofloxacin susceptible and 66 were ciprofloxacin resistant).
   Results. Ciprofloxacin-resistant strains of both human and avian origin
   harbored fewer virulence genes than did ciprofloxacin-susceptible
   strains, but ciprofloxacin-resistant strains from humans were found to
   be clearly distinct from ciprofloxacin-resistant avian strains, based on
   their phylogenetic backgrounds and virulence gene profiles. The
   phylogenetic background of ciprofloxacin-susceptible and
   ciprofloxacin-resistant strains of human origin was not different, and
   no shift from the phylogenetic group B2 toward other groups was detected
   in association with ciprofloxacin resistance. No genetic relatedness was
   observed among human and avian strains that belonged to the major
   virulence profile (traT-iucD-iutA).
   Conclusions. Our results did not support the hypothesis of an avian
   origin for the ciprofloxacin-resistant human ExPEC strains analyzed.
   Nevertheless, prudent use of fluoroquinolones in both human and
   veterinary medicine is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Rabbit meat breeding may be heavily affected by enterotoxaemia due to
   Clostridium spiroforme. Data on its antimicrobial susceptibility are
   insufficient, presumably because of difficulties in cultivating and
   identifying the pathogen. Our aim is therefore to provide this
   information to veterinary practitioners by focusing on a panel of
   therapeutics used in intensive rabbit units. Lincomycin was also checked
   in order to investigate the origin of resistance to macrolides. Minimal
   inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined with the agar dilution
   method according to the CLSI M11-A7 protocol (2007). MIC(50) and MIC(90)
   were, respectively, 64 and 64 mu g/ml for tiamulin, 32 and 32 mu g/ml
   for norfloxacin, 0.063 and 0.125 mu g/ml for amoxicillin, and 8 and 16
   mu g/ml for doxycycline. MIC(50) and MIC(90) were 256 mu g/ml for
   sulphadimethoxine, spiramycin and lincomycin. Our results have shown
   that intrinsic or acquired antimicrobial resistances are diffuse in the
   C spiroforme population and suggest focusing on prevention rather than
   on treatment of clostridial overgrowth, by reducing risk factors and
   using antimicrobials prudently. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   phylogeographical structure of this Africa 2 lineage revealed strong
   population subdivision at the country level, with only limited movement
   of virus among localities, including a possible east-to-west spread
   across Africa. In addition, Bayesian coalescent analysis suggested that
   the Africa 2 lineage was introduced into this region of Africa only
   recently (probably <200 years ago), in accordance with the timescale of
   expanding European colonial influence and urbanization, and then spread
   relatively slowly, perhaps occupying the entire region in a 100 year

   Cross-reactive antibodies elicited by different flaviviruses can make
   difficult the interpretation of ELISA and hemagglutination-inhibition
   (HI) tests for the diagnosis of TBE. Neutralization tests, which are
   more specific, are not in common use because they are difficult to
   perform and standardize. A plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT),
   optimized previously in vaccinated children, was evaluated in sera from
   acute cases of TBE, collected for diagnostic purposes, and from healthy
   human population and wild ruminants, collected for serosurvey purposes.
   The PRNT results were compared with the results of ELISA and HI tests.
   In acute TBE disease, most sera were positive for IgM antibodies by
   ELISA and with high HI antibody titers; neutralizing antibodies were
   detected in 71.4\% of patients, at a very low titer (1: 10 NT(50)) in
   almost all cases. Seroprevalences of 8\% and 6.5\% for anti-TBE ELISA

Abstract = {{Influenza A viruses infecting poultry can be divided into 2 groups. The
   extremely virulent viruses cause highly pathogenic avian influenza
   (HPAI), with flock mortality as great as 100\%. These viruses have been
   restricted to subtypes H5 and H7, although not all H5 and H7 viruses
   cause HPAI. All other viruses cause a milder, primarily respiratory,
   disease (LPAI) unless exacerbated. Until recently, HPAI viruses were
   rarely isolated from wild birds, but for LPAI viruses, extremely great
   isolation rates have been recorded in surveillance studies. Influenza
   viruses may infect all types of domestic or captive birds in all areas
   of the world, with the frequency with which primary infections occur in
   any type of bird usually depending on the degree of contact of the bird
   with feral birds. Secondary spread is usually associated with human
   involvement, either by bird or bird product movement, or by transferring
   infective feces from infected to susceptible birds, but potentially wild
   birds could be involved. In recent years, the frequency of HPAI
   outbreaks appears to have increased, and there have been particularly
   costly outbreaks of HPAI in densely populated poultry areas in Italy,
   the Netherlands, and Canada. In each, millions of birds were slaughtered
   to bring the outbreaks under control. Since the 1990s, avian influenza
   infections attributable to 2 subtypes have been widespread in poultry
   across a large area of the world. The LPAI H9N2 virus appears to have
   spread across the whole of Asia in that time and has become endemic in
   poultry in many of the affected countries. However, these outbreaks have
   tended to be overshadowed by the H5N1 HPAI virus, which, although
   initially isolated in China, has now spread in poultry, wild birds, or
   both throughout Asia and into Europe and Africa, resulting in the death
   or culling of hundreds of millions of poultry and posing a significant
   zoonotic threat. To date, control methods seem to have been unsuccessful
   on the larger scale, and HPAI H5N1 outbreaks continue to be reported.}},

Abstract = {{In late 2000, Italy was the first country of the European Union (EU) to
   implement an emergency vaccination programme against notifiable avian
   influenza. Vaccination with a conventional vaccine containing a seed
   strain with a different neuraminidase subtype from that of the field
   virus was used to complement biosecurity and restriction measures as
   part of an overall eradication strategy. This vaccination technique, in
   line with the Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals system
   (DIVA), was applied several times until March 2008. This strategy
   enabled the identification of field exposed flocks and ultimately the
   eradication of low pathogenic H7N1, H7N3 and H5N2 infections. Italy was
   also the first country to implement a bivalent H5/H7 prophylactic
   vaccination programme of defined poultry populations, which was
   discontinued in December 2006.
   Following the incursion of highly pathogenic H5N1 into Europe, in 2005
   and 2006, two other EU Member States, namely France and the Netherlands,
   implemented preventive vaccination programmes in 2006 but they targeted
   selected poultry populations different from those targeted in Italy and
   were implemented for short periods of time.
   Data generated during six years of experience with vaccination against
   avian influenza in Italy indicate that it is a useful tool to limit
   secondary spread and possibly prevent the introduction of low pathogenic
   avian influenza viruses in a susceptible population. The experience of
   France and the Netherlands provides data on vaccination of ducks and
   hobby poultry respectively and monitoring programmes associated with
   vaccination and difficulties related to their application. The
   advantages and disadvantages of vaccination need to be considered in the
   decision-making process, including the financial aspects of vaccination.}},

Abstract = {{Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A/H5N1 was first officially
   reported in Africa in early 2006. Since the first outbreak in Nigeria,
   this virus spread rapidly to other African countries. From its emergence
   to early 2008, 11 African countries experienced A/H5N1 outbreaks in
   poultry and human cases were also reported in three of these countries.
   At present, little is known of the epidemiology and molecular evolution
   of A/H5N1 viruses in Africa. We have generated 494 full gene sequences
   from 67 African isolates and applied molecular analysis tools to a total
   of 1,152 A/H5N1 sequences obtained from viruses isolated in Africa,
   Europe and the Middle East between 2006 and early 2008. Detailed
   phylogenetic analyses of the 8 gene viral segments confirmed that 3
   distinct sublineages were introduced, which have persisted and spread
   across the continent over this 2-year period. Additionally, our
   molecular epidemiological studies highlighted the association between
   genetic clustering and area of origin in a majority of cases. Molecular
   signatures unique to strains isolated in selected areas also gave us a
   clearer picture of the spread of A/H5N1 viruses across the continent.
   Mutations described as typical of human influenza viruses in the genes
   coding for internal proteins or associated with host adaptation and
   increased resistance to antiviral drugs have also been detected in the
   genes coding for transmembrane proteins. These findings raise concern
   for the possible human health risk presented by viruses with these
   genetic properties and highlight the need for increased efforts to
   monitor the evolution of A/H5N1 viruses across the African continent.
   They further stress how imperative it is to implement sustainable
   control strategies to improve animal and public health at a global
   level.}},

Abstract = {{The most frequently used diagnostic methods were compared in a

   from an area of Italy where leishmaniasis is endemic. In February and
   March 2005, 845 asymptomatic dogs were tested by an immunofluorescence
   antibody test (IFAT), a dipstick assay (DS), and an enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for L. infantum and by IFAT for Ehrlichia
   canis. Dogs seronegative for L. infantum were further parasitologically
   evaluated by microscopic examination of lymph node tissues and PCR of
   skin samples. A total of 204 animals both serologically and
   parasitologically negative for L. infantum at the first sampling were
   enrolled in the trial and were further examined for canine leishmaniasis
   (CanL) and canine monocytic ehrlichiosis in November 2005 (i.e., the end
   of the first sandfly season) and March 2006 and 2007 (1- and 2-year
   follow-ups, respectively). At the initial screening, the overall rates
   of L. infantum seroprevalence were 9.5\% by IFAT, 17.1\% by ELISA, and
   9.8\% by DS and the overall rate of E. canis seroprevalence was 15\%.
   The rates of concordance between the results of IFAT and DS were almost
   equal, whereas the rate of concordance between the results of IFAT and
   DS and those of the ELISA was lower. The results of the annual incidence
   of Leishmania infection were variable, depending on the test employed,
   with the highest values registered for PCR (i.e., 5.7\% and 11.4\% at
   the 1- and 2-year follow-ups, respectively), followed by ELISA, IFAT,

Abstract = {{Spoligotyping and exact tandem repeat (ETR) analysis of Mycobacterium
   bovis and M. caprae isolated strains has been routinely carried out in
   Italy since 2000 to obtain a database of genetic profiles and support
   traditional epidemiological investigations. In this study, we
   characterized 1,503 M. bovis and 57 M. caprae isolates obtained from
   2000 to 2006 in 747 cattle herds mainly located in northern Italy. We
   identified 81 spoligotypes and 113 ETR profiles, while the combination
   of spoligotyping/ETR analysis differentiated 228 genotypes, with
   genotypic diversity indices of 0.70 (spoligotyping), 0.94 (ETR-A to -E
   typing), and 0.97 (spoligotyping/ETR-A to -E typing), respectively.
   Despite the high degree of resolution obtained, the spoligotyping/ ETR
   methods were not discriminative enough in the case of genotypes
   characterized by the combination of SB0120, the predominant spoligotype
   in Italy, with the most common ETR profiles. To obtain a more
   informative subset of typing loci, 24 mycobacterial interspersed
   repetitive unit-variable-number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) markers were
   evaluated by analyzing a panel of 100 epidemiologically unrelated SB0120
   isolates. The panel was differentiated into 89 profiles with an overall
   genotypic diversity of 0.987 that could be also achieved by using a
   minimal group of 13 loci: ETR-A, -B, and -E; MIRU 26 and 40; and VNTR
   2163a, 2163b, 3155, 1612, 4052, 1895, 3232, and 3336. The allelic
   diversity index and the stability of single loci was evaluated to
   provide the most discriminative genotyping method for locally prevalent
   strains.}},

   Sons A/S.
   Carbon monoxide (CO) interferes with inflammatory and apoptotic
   processes associated with ischemia-reperfusion injury and graft
   rejection. Here, the in vitro effects of carbon monoxide releasing
   molecule-3 (CORM-3), a novel water-soluble carbonyl CO carrier, have
   been investigated on porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAEC) and primate
   peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Furthermore, the
   pharmacodynamics and pharmacotolerance of CORM-3 after administration of
   single and multiple doses in the primate have been assessed in view of
   its potential application in pig-to-primate xenotransplantation models.
   For in vitro studies, PAEC and primate PBMC were exposed for 24, 48 and
   72 h to CORM-3 (20 to 1000 mu m) and viability was measured using an MTS
   assay. PAEC and primate PBMC proliferation after exposure to CORM-3 was
   assessed by CFSE labelling. Proliferation of primate PBMC against
   irradiated pig lymphocytes was also assessed. Tumor necrosis factor
   alpha (TNF-alpha) production and Caspase-3 and -7 activity in
   Concanavalin A (conA)-stimulated primate PBMC were measured following
   treatment with CORM-3. In vivo, CORM-3 was administered i.v. to
   cynomolgus monkeys at 4 mg/kg, as single or multiple doses for up to 30
   days. The effect of CORM-3 was evaluated by the assessment of production
   of TNF-alpha and interleukin 1 beta following PBMC stimulation with LPS
   by species-specific ELISA. Complete hematologic and biochemical analyses
   were routinely performed in treated primates.
   At concentrations < 500 mu m, CORM-3 did not alter the viability of PAEC
   or primate PBMC cultures in vitro, nor did it induce significant levels
   of apoptosis or necrosis. Interestingly, at concentrations of 300 and
   500 mu m, significant PAEC proliferation was observed, whilst
   concentrations >= 50 mu m inhibited conA-activated primate lymphocyte
   proliferation (IC50 of 345.8 +/- 51.9 mu m) and the primate xenogeneic
   response against pig PBMC. Such responses were demonstrated to be
   CO-dependent. In addition, CORM-3 significantly inhibited caspase-3 and
   -7 activity at concentrations between 200 and 500 mu m and caused a
   significant reduction in TNF-alpha production (IC50 332.8 +/- 33.9 mu
   m). In vivo, following the administration of multiple doses, TNF-alpha
   production was significantly reduced in comparison to pre-treatment
   responses, with decreased levels maintained throughout the study.
   Moreover, a slight and transient increase in transaminases and bilirubin
   was observed in animals exposed to multiple doses of CORM-3.
   These studies suggest that CORM-3 has anti-inflammatory and
   immunomodulatory properties in primates that may result in clinical
   benefit to allo- and xenografted organs.}},

Abstract = {{DNA vaccines encoding the glycoprotein genes of the salmonid
   rhabdoviruses VHSV and IHNV are very efficient in eliciting protective
   immune responses against their respective diseases in rainbow trout
   (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The early anti-viral response (EAVR) provides
   Protection by 4 days post vaccination and is non-specific and transient
   while the specific anti-viral response (SAVR) is long lasting and highly
   specific. Since both VHSV and IHNV are endemic in rainbow trout in
   several geographical regions of Europe and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)
   on the Pacific coast of North America, co-vaccination against the two
   diseases would be a preferable option. In the present study we
   demonstrated that a single injection of mixed DNA vaccines induced
   long-lasting protection against both individual and a simultaneous virus
   challenge 80 days post vaccination. Transfected muscle cells at the
   injection site expressed both G proteins. This study confirms the

Abstract = {{Background: Although Bivalves are among the most studied marine
   organisms due to their ecological role, economic importance and use in
   pollution biomonitoring, very little information is available on the
   genome sequences of mussels. This study reports the functional analysis
   of a large-scale Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) sequencing from different
   tissues of Mytilus galloprovincialis (the Mediterranean mussel)
   challenged with toxic pollutants, temperature and potentially pathogenic
   bacteria.
   Results: We have constructed and sequenced seventeen cDNA libraries from
   different Mediterranean mussel tissues: gills, digestive gland, foot,
   anterior and posterior adductor muscle, mantle and haemocytes. A total
   of 24,939 clones were sequenced from these libraries generating 18,788
   high-quality ESTs which were assembled into 2,446 overlapping clusters
   and 4,666 singletons resulting in a total of 7,112 non-redundant
   sequences. In particular, a high-quality normalized cDNA library (Nor01)
   was constructed as determined by the high rate of gene discovery
   (65.6\%). Bioinformatic screening of the non-redundant M.
   galloprovincialis sequences identified 159 microsatellite-containing
   ESTs. Clusters, consensuses, related similarities and gene ontology
   searches have been organized in a dedicated, searchable database
   http://mussel.cribi.unipd.it.
   Conclusion: We defined the first species-specific catalogue of M.
   galloprovincialis ESTs including 7,112 unique transcribed sequences.
   Putative microsatellite markers were identified. This annotated
   catalogue represents a valuable platform for expression studies, marker
   validation and genetic linkage analysis for investigations in the
   biology of Mediterranean mussels.}},

Abstract = {{Equine rhinitis A and B viruses (ERAV and ERBV) are respiratory viruses
   of horses belonging to the family Picornaviridae. Although these viruses
   are considered to cause respiratory disease in horses and are
   potentially infectious for humans, little is known about their
   prevalence and pathogenesis. Virus isolation is often unsuccessful due
   to their inefficient growth and lack of cytopathic effect in cell
   cultures, Therefore, molecular assays should be considered as the method
   of choice to detect infection in symptomatic or apparently healthy
   horses. In the present study, a novel real-time duplex PCR was developed
   for the detection and differentiation of both ERAV and ERBV. The method
   was evaluated for its ability to detect viral RNA in cell culture
   supernatants and nasal swabs, and lung and urine spiked with known
   quantities of virus. The assay demonstrated high analytical specificity,
   sensitivity and good reproducibility, with coefficients of variation
   (CV\%) ranging from 1\% to 7.4\% and from 1.2\% to 12\% for intra- and
   inter-assay variability respectively. The assay detected ERBV in 14 of
   86 nasal swabs collected from horses with respiratory disease. The
   real-time duplex PCR is a useful new diagnostic method for the rapid
   detection and differentiation of ERAV and ERBV. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

   (Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii) is a solitary bird that inhabits
   semi-desert regions. It is known to be susceptible to avianpox, avian
   paramyxovirus type 1, and low-pathogenicity avian influenza H9N2. We
   report an outbreak of H5N1 HPAIV in Houbara bustards, which were
   introduced into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for falconry purposes.
   Ninety-three per cent mortality (38 out of 41 birds) in the infected
   Houbara bustard flock and about 62.5\% mortality (10 out of 16 birds) in
   falcons that came in contact with these birds were observed. Pooled
   cloacal and tracheal swabs from Houbara bustards as well as visceral
   organ homogenates collected in Houbara bustards and falcons were tested
   by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and virus
   isolation was attempted in specific pathogen free hens' eggs. The
   viruses isolated were characterized as HPAIV H5N1. Phylogenetic analysis
   of the haemagglutinating and Neuraminidase (NA) genes revealed that the
   viruses isolated from Houbara bustards and falcons were closely related
   to each other and to Kuwaiti H5N1 strains isolated in 2007.
   Interestingly, they were genetically distinguishable from the
   co-circulating A/H5N1 viruses in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia causing

Journal = {{FOOD ADDITIVES \& CONTAMINANTS PART B-SURVEILLANCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{52-58}},
Abstract = {{Antibacterial drugs are used worldwide for the control of American and,
   less often, European foulbrood. Their administration is mostly
   uncontrolled and applied without approved protocols and instructions for
   use as well as precautionary recommendations. Consequently, this
   practice is responsible for the contamination of beehive products and
   contributes to the problem of food safety. According to this situation,
   4672 analyses were carried out on 5303 honeys collected from 2001 to
   2007. These samples were investigated for antibacterial residues of
   tetracyclines, sulphonamides, streptomycin, chloramphenicol and tylosin.
   Honeys were classified according to their origin: imported honey and
   honey from the Italian market. In the last group (only for samples
   collected from 2001 to 2004), another type of honey was distinguished:
   that of local honey. A total of 6.3\% of all samples were positive for
   the antibacterial drugs analysed; in particular, 6.8\% of imported
   honeys and 6.1\% of honeys on the Italian market. Only 1.7\% of local
   honey had antibacterial residues. These results are indicative of a
   rather frequent presence of antibacterial drug residues in both Italian
   and imported honeys. Furthermore, the data showed that among the active
   substances analysed, sulphonamides are the most used antibacterial
   substance followed by tetracyclines, streptomycin, tylosin, and
   chloramphenicol. Finally, a continuous monitoring programme is needed,
   accompanied by an education programme to beekeepers on proper hive
   management.}},

Abstract = {{Background Infections of wild birds with highly pathogenic avian
   influenza (AI) subtype H5N1 virus were reported for the first time in
   the European Union in 2006.
   Objectives To capture epidemiological information on H5N1 HPAI in wild
   bird populations through large-scale surveillance and extensive data
   collection.
   Methods Records were analysed at bird level to explore the epidemiology
   of AI with regard to species of wild birds involved, timing and location
   of infections as well as the applicability of different surveillance
   types for the detection of infections.
   Results In total, 120,706 records of birds were sent to the Community
   Reference Laboratory for analysis. Incidents of H5N1 HPAI in wild birds
   were detected in 14 EU Member States during 2006. All of these incidents
   occurred between February and May, with the exception of two single
   cases during the summer months in Germany and Spain.
   Conclusions For the detection of H5N1 HPAI virus, passive surveillance
   of dead or diseased birds appeared the most effective approach, whilst
   active surveillance offered better detection of low pathogenic avian
   influenza (LPAI) viruses. No carrier species for H5N1 HPAI virus could
   be identified and almost all birds infected with H5N1 HPAI virus were
   either dead or showed clinical signs. A very large number of Mallards
   (Anas platyrhynchos) were tested in 2006 and while a high proportion of
   LPAI infections were found in this species, H5N1 HPAI virus was rarely
   identified in these birds. Orders of species that appeared to be very
   clinically susceptible to H5N1 HPAI virus were swans, diving ducks,
   mergansers and grebes, supporting experimental evidence. Surveillance
   results indicate that H5N1 HPAI virus did not establish itself
   successfully in the EU wild bird population in 2006.}},

   higher at the end of the fattening for calves fed the mix diet, as
   expected. Values remained, however, within ranges that allowed
   acceptable carcass paleness. Haematic iron, unsaturated iron binding
   capacity (UIBC) and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) levels were not
   significantly different between the two solid feeds. Lower copper and

   be explained by water loss and N-soluble compounds concentration, which
   could alter protein matrix. a{*} and b{*} reduction was probably related

Abstract = {{Rickettsia felis is an obligate intracellular bacterium belonging to the

   from dogs and cats in different areas of Italy. Two species of fleas
   were identified, Ctenocephalides felis (80.3\%) and Ctenocephalides
   canis (19.7\%).
   Overall, 320 fleas (257 C. felis and 63 C. canis) collected from 117
   animals (73 dogs and 44 cats) were tested. Thirty-eight (11.9\%) C.
   felis fleas, 13 from cats (17.6\%) and 25 from dogs (10.2\%) were
   positive for R. felis. No C. canis was positive. Fleas from cats showed
   a tendency to be more positive than fleas from dogs. Prevalence of R.
   felis among areas and within provinces of the same area was extremely
   variable, ranging from 0 to 35.3\%. Overall, prevalence in north-eastern

Abstract = {{Ecological and climatic changes, human and animal population dynamics
   are among the several factors that have favoured the spread or the (re)
   introduction and establishment of ``novel{''} vector species and
   pathogens they transmit in previously disease-free geographical areas.
   As key examples of the changing pattern of distribution of canine vector
   borne diseases (CVBDs), the current distribution of canine leishmaniosis
   (CanL) by Leishmania infantum and dirofilariosis by Dirofilaria immitis
   causing heart worm disease (HW) in Italy is discussed on the basis of
   retrospective historical reports until the 90's and later on until 2009.
   For long time, D. immitis has been considered mainly present along the
   Po River Valley and northward areas, while L. infantum in south-central
   Italy and Sicily and Sardinia. Comparison of current available and
   historical data (up to 1989) confirms that HW and CanL, although with
   different prevalence rates, have been changing their distribution
   patterns in Italy as a result of many biological and ecological factors,
   including those related to vector distribution and introduction of new
   species (e. g. the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus, a competent
   vector of D. immitis). New autochthonous foci of HW in southern Italy
   (i.e. Apulia and Calabria regions) have recently been reported.
   Although analysing retrospective data may represent a difficult task,
   the ``paradigm{''} about the dual distribution of HW and CanL in
   northern and southern Italy cannot yet be considered valid. The research
   needs for managing HW and CanL in previously uninfected areas are

Abstract = {{The notion of knowledge object is central to the modern company due to
   the increasing awareness of the need of properly managing knowledge.
   Still, there is no clear idea on how to understand this notion, let
   alone characterize it. Information technology (IT) is of little help on
   this issue. It has been focussing almost exclusively toward the
   regulation of data types, data flows and their management; the complex
   interaction between information and the human agents, one of the
   characteristics of knowledge, is unfortunately disregarded. If we aim to
   develop systems for intellectual capital and knowledge management, we
   need to study notions like knowledge object, knowledge transfer and
   knowledge measurement. Here we make a first step in this direction by
   setting the basis for an analysis of (a class of) knowledge objects with
   which we highlight some interesting behaviour and dependences. The
   approach we follow is based on the ontological perspective and is driven
   by questions like: what is a knowledge object, what composes a knowledge
   object, how do knowledge objects change? These topics are complex for a
   variety of reasons and we make some simplifying assumptions by working
   in a standardized environment where the relationship between data and
   knowledge is fairly intuitive. Clearly, the general framework that we
   want to develop has to do justice of a series of elements (from
   activities to data, from physical entities to agents' role) that cannot
   be introduced in a single paper. We limit our presentation to just a few
   basic notions designed for a generic domain and take advantage of our
   guiding scenario to show how these can be exploited in specific
   contexts. The case study is given by the Istituto Zooprofilattico
   Sperimentale delle Venezie (IZSVE), a veterinary public health institute
   that conducts laboratory controls and research activities in three main
   areas: animal health and welfare, food safety, and environmental
   protection. Ideally, the IZSVE receives samples of material with some
   accompanying information (date, owner, typology etc.) and decides to run
   analyses to establish properties of the material or to detect infectious
   agents. In our theoretical perspective, the IZSVE receives a complex
   object in the form of a pair (M,D) constituted by a piece of material
   (M) and relative data (D), and exercises its knowledge with the goal of
   extracting new data. The process relies in manipulations of M and of D
   causing a variety of changes in M (from reduction in size to biochemical
   alteration to complete destruction) while data D evolve. Calling (M',D')
   the material and relative information we have at the end of an activity,
   our aim is to understand and describe the relationship between (M,D) and
   (M',D') in the perspective of organization IZSVE. Thus, we view
   knowledge objects as triples (M,D,O), where O is an agent, e.g. IZSVE, a
   department or a technician, and focus on the relationship between the
   first two components in the perspective of the third.
