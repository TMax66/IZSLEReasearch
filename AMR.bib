abstract={Increasing reports of antimicrobial resistance in wildlife highlight the significance of a One Health approach to managing resistance. We investigated the prevalence and diversity of class 1 integrons, a genetic determinant of resistance, in grey-headed flying foxes, a large fruit bat species belonging to the order Chiroptera. Class 1 integrons were detected in both wild flying foxes (5.3%) and captive flying foxes (41.2%) housed in wildlife rehabilitation facilities. Genes encoding resistance to aminoglycosides, trimethoprim and beta-lactams, and Qac efflux pumps were detected. Analysis of conserved integron elements and gene cassette arrays indicate the direction of integron transfer is from humans to flying foxes. The detection of two novel gene cassette arrays (5′CS-qacH-aacA34-bla OXA-21 -3′CS and 5′CS-qacF-3′CS strongly suggests acquisition of genes from the environmental resistome into class 1 integrons within the flying fox microbiota. The dynamics of class 1 integrons in flying foxes indicates bats have a role in the emergence of novel antibiotic resistance determinants. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Today a growing number of studies are focusing on antibiotic resistance in wildlife. This is due to the potential role of wild animals as reservoirs and spreaders of pathogenic and resistant bacteria. This study focused on isolating and identifying Escherichia coli from the feces of wild animals living in the Apuan Alps Regional Park (Tuscany, Italy) and evaluating some of their antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity traits. Eighty-five fecal samples from different species were studied. Seventy-one E. coli were identified by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry analysis, subjected to antibiograms and polymerase chain reaction for the detection of antibiotic resistance genes and pathogenicity factors. The highest resistance rates were found against cephalothin (39.4%) and ampicillin (33.8%), followed by amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (15.5%), streptomycin (12.7%), and tetracycline (5.6%). Regarding resistance genes, 39.4% of the isolates were negative for all tested genes. The remaining isolates were positive for blaCMY-2, sul2, strA-strB and aadA1, tet(B), and tet(A), encoding resistance to beta-lactams, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, streptomycin, and tetracycline, respectively. With regard to virulence factors, 63.4% of the isolates were negative for all genes; 21.1% carried astA alone, which is associated with different pathotypes, 9.9% carried both escV and eaeA (aEPEC); single isolates (1.4%) harbored escV (aEPEC), escV associated with astA and eaeA (aEPEC), astA with stx2 and hlyA (EHEC) or astA and stx1, stx2, and hlyA (EHEC). These results show that wildlife from nonanthropized environments can be a reservoir for antibiotic-resistant microorganisms and suggest the need for a deeper knowledge on their origin and diffusion mechanisms through different ecological niches. © 2019 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.},

abstract={Colonization of gut microbiomes during early life can shape metabolism and immunity of adult animals. However, most data are derived from antibiotic-treated or germ-free laboratory mammals. Furthermore, few studies have explored how microbial colonization during critical windows influences a suite of other fitness-related traits in wild animals. This study tested whether hatching constitutes a critical developmental window for gut microbiome colonization in wild-caught amphibians and whether perturbations to gut microbiota at hatching shape fitness-related traits of larval growth, metabolism, metamorphosis and disease susceptibility. We sterilized wood frog eggs and then inoculated them with microbes from differing sources, including from another species (bullfrogs) that differ in disease resistance and life history. We measured development, growth and metabolic rates through metamorphosis among individuals from each microbial treatment. A separate group was exposed to an LD50 dose of ranavirus—an emerging disease—to test for microbiome effects on disease susceptibility. We also quantified rates of deformities to test for microbial treatment effects on overall health. Manipulation of microbiota on eggs altered the trajectory of gut microbiome communities across larval ontogeny, though disruption appeared to be transitory. While microbiome structure converged among the treatments by metamorphosis, the effects of disruption on host phenotypes persisted. Larvae inoculated with the bullfrog gut microbiota exhibited accelerated growth and development rates compared to controls. By contrast, sterilized larvae maintained in sterile water for several days after hatching exhibited greater disruption to their gut microbiota across ontogeny, as well as altered metabolism, more tail deformities, and were more likely to die when exposed to an LD50 dose of ranavirus compared to the other treatments. These results suggest perturbations to the microbiota during critical developmental windows can alter the trajectory of the gut microbiome, and have long-term effects on fitness-related traits in larval amphibians. These results suggest that explicit tests of how changes in the composition and abundance of the microbial community shape phenotypes across ontogeny in amphibians could shed light on host–microbe interactions in wildlife, as well as inform conservation efforts to mitigate emerging diseases. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={Background: The monitoring of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in microorganisms that circulate in the environment is an important topic of scientific research and contributes to the development of action plans to combat the spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. As a synanthropic vector for multiple pathogens and a reservoir for AMR, flies can be used for surveillance. Methods: We collected 163 flies in the inner city of Berlin and examined them for extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli genotypically and phenotypically. Results: The prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli in flies was 12.9%. Almost half (47.6%) of the ESBL-positive samples showed a co-resistance to ciprofloxacin. Resistance to carbapenems or colistin was not detected. The predominant ESBL-type was CTX-M-1, which is associated with wildlife, livestock, and companion animals as a potential major source of transmission of MDR E. coli to flies. Conclusions: This field study confirms the permanent presence of ESBL-producing E. coli in an urban fly population. For continuous monitoring of environmental contamination with multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, flies can be used as indicators without much effort. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={Background: Antibiotic resistance is rendering common bacterial infections untreatable. Wildlife can incorporate and disperse antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the environment, such as water systems, which in turn serve as reservoirs of resistance genes for human pathogens. Anthropogenic activity may contribute to the spread of bacterial resistance cycling through natural environments, including through the release of human waste, as sewage treatment only partially removes antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, empirical data supporting these effects are currently limited. Here we used bulk RNA-sequencing (meta-transcriptomics) to assess the diversity and expression levels of functionally viable resistance genes in the gut microbiome of birds with aquatic habits in diverse locations. Results: We found antibiotic resistance genes in birds from all localities, from penguins in Antarctica to ducks in a wastewater treatment plant in Australia. Comparative analysis revealed that birds feeding at the wastewater treatment plant carried the greatest resistance gene burden, including genes typically associated with multidrug resistance plasmids as the aac(6)-Ib-cr gene. Differences in resistance gene burden also reflected aspects of bird ecology, taxonomy, and microbial function. Notably, ducks, which feed by dabbling, carried a higher abundance and diversity of resistance genes than turnstones, avocets, and penguins, which usually prey on more pristine waters. Conclusions: These transcriptome data suggest that human waste, even if it undergoes treatment, might contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance genes to the wild. Differences in microbiome functioning across different bird lineages may also play a role in the antibiotic resistance burden carried by wild birds. In summary, we reveal the complex factors explaining the distribution of resistance genes and their exchange routes between humans and wildlife, and show that meta-transcriptomics is a valuable tool to access functional resistance genes in whole microbial communities. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={Wild birds inhabit in a wide variety of environments and can travel great distances. Thus, wild birds can possibly spread antimicrobial resistance along the way, and this may represent a potential public health concern. We characterized antimicrobial resistance in fecal Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis in wild raptors in the southeastern US. Cloacal samples were collected from 118 wild raptors of 17 species from 18 counties in Alabama and 15 counties in Georgia. A total of 112 E. coli and 76 E. faecalis isolates were recovered, and we found significantly more antimicrobial-resistant E. coli (20/112, 18%) than E. faecalis (6/76, 8%; P=0.05). Five antimicrobial-resistant genes: blaTEM-1, blaCTX-M-1, tet(M), cmlA, cat, and gyrA, were identified in antimicrobial-resistant E. coli isolates. Five of 13 (38%) ampicillin-resistant E. coli harbored both bla-TEM-1 and blaCTX-M-1 genes, indicating they are extended-spectrum β-lactamase–carrying strains. Both of the tetracycline resistance genes, tet(M) and tet(L), were identified in E. faecalis isolates. Wild raptors seem to be a reservoir host of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli and E. faecalis and may represent a hazard to animal and human health by transmission of these isolates. © Wildlife Disease Association 2019.},

abstract={Soils in tropical and temperate locations are known to be a sink for the genetic potential of anthropogenic-driven acquired antibiotic resistance (AR). In contrast, accumulation of acquired AR is less probable in most Polar soils, providing a platform for characterizing background resistance and establishing a benchmark for assessing AR spread. Here, high-throughput qPCR and geochemistry were used to quantify the abundance and diversity of both antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and selected mobile genetic elements (MGEs) across eight soil clusters in the Kongsfjorden region of Svalbard in the High Arctic. Relative ARG levels ranged by over two orders of magnitude (10 −6 to 10 −4 copies/16S rRNA gene copy), and showed a gradient of potential human and wildlife impacts across clusters as evidenced by altered geochemical conditions and increased “foreign” ARG abundances (i.e., allochthonous), including bla NDM-1 . Impacted clusters exhibited 100× higher total ARGs and MGEs in tandem with elevated secondary nutrients, especially available P that is typically low and limiting in Arctic soils. In contrast, ARGs in less-impacted clusters correlated strongly to local soil lithology. The most plausible source of exogenous P and allochthonous ARGs in this region is bird and other wildlife guano, disseminated either by local human wastes or via direct carriage and deposition. Regardless of pathway, accumulation of apparent allochthonous ARGs and MGEs in High Arctic soils is concerning, highlighting the importance of characterizing Arctic sites now to establish benchmarks for tracking AR spread around the world. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Reports of enteric bacteria in Antarctic wildlife have suggested its spread from people to seabirds and seals, but evidence is scarce and fragmentary. We investigated the occurrence of zoonotic enteric bacteria in seabirds across the Antarctic and subantarctic region; for comparison purposes, in addition to seabirds, poultry in a subantarctic island was also sampled. Three findings suggest reverse zoonosis from humans to seabirds: the detection of a zoonotic Salmonella serovar (ser. Enteritidis) and Campylobacter species (e.g. C. jejuni), typical of human infections; the resistance of C. lari isolates to ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin, antibiotics commonly used in human and veterinary medicine; and most importantly, the presence of C. jejuni genotypes mostly found in humans and domestic animals but rarely or never found in wild birds so far. We also show further spread of zoonotic agents among Antarctic wildlife is facilitated by substantial connectivity among populations of opportunistic seabirds, notably skuas (Stercorarius). Our results highlight the need for even stricter biosecurity measures to limit human impacts in Antarctica. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Intensive clinical use of antibiotics together with inadequate sanitation in an urban environment may contribute to the dissemination of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria in the community. Wild birds living in these areas may become colonized with such organisms and further disseminate these resistant bacteria. In this study, we examined Escherichia coli isolates from the intestine of wild birds in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for those expressing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), carbapenemase, and other drug resistances. We obtained 353 E. coli isolates from 112 birds admitted to three wildlife centers in Rio de Janeiro state, from July 2010 to December 2013. MDR isolates were found in 43 (38%) birds, including 14 carrying E. coli isolates that expressed ESBL. All ESBL-encoding genes were blaCTX-M type, and no carbapenemase-producing isolates were found. MDR isolates belonged to a variety of lineages. Multilocus sequence type clonal complexes 648 and 155 accounted for carriage in 9 (21%) of 43 birds with MDR isolates. The study birds were nonmigratory, and the bacteria obtained from them likely mirrored urban circulating genotypes. Altogether, these findings indicate a high level of environmental contamination with clinically relevant drug resistance genes in Rio de Janeiro. A large proportion of the MDR strains belonged to clonal lineages. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract={Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are zoonotic pathogens that live in the gastrointestinal tract of wildlife and cattle without causing disease. In humans, their colonization and infection lead to life-threatening disease. We investigated the occurrence of STEC in wild ungulates (wild boar, red deer and roe deer) inhabiting areas differently impacted by anthropogenic activities. STEC were detected in 9% (n = 6) of the samples and were recovered from the three species: 1 of wild boar, 4 of red deer and 1 of roe deer. All the isolates (n = 7) were non-O157 STEC encoding stx1 (n = 2; 29%) and/or stx2 genes (n = 6; 86%). O27:H30 was the most frequent serotype identified, followed by O146:H21 and O146:H28. Two STEC were O-untypable: ONT:H28 and ONT:H52. The phylo-groups identified were B1 (n = 3), E (n = 3) and F (n = 1). All the isolates recovered were susceptible to the different classes of antibiotics tested, although resistance genes were found in two strains. Apart from stx, all STEC encode many virulence factors (VF), particularly adhesins and/or other toxins. A strain with 13 VF collected from roe deer has a high enterohemorrhagic risk due to the presence of intimin, hemolysin and protease effectors genes. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) are implicated in the major cases of human infection and mortality, highlighting the zoonotic potential of wildlife-associated STEC. Wild ungulates are reservoirs of STEC potentially pathogenic to humans. Therefore, following the One Health concept, it is crucial to establish worldwide local monitoring programs that will benefit human, animal and environmental health. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The isolation of antimicrobial resistant bacteria (ARB) from wildlife living adjacent to humans has led to the suggestion that such antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is anthropogenically driven by exposure to antimicrobials and ARB. However, ARB have also been detected in wildlife living in areas without interaction with humans. Here, we investigated patterns of resistance in Escherichia coli isolated from 408 wild bird and mammal faecal samples. AMR and multi-drug resistance (MDR) prevalence in wildlife samples differed significantly between a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP; wastes of antibiotic-treated humans) and a Farm site (antibiotic-treated livestock wastes) and Central site (no sources of wastes containing anthropogenic AMR or antimicrobials), but patterns of resistance also varied significantly over time and between mammals and birds. Over 30% of AMR isolates were resistant to colistin, a last-resort antibiotic, but resistance was not due to the mcr-1 gene. ESBL and AmpC activity were common in isolates from mammals. Wildlife were, therefore, harbouring resistance of clinical relevance. AMR E. coli, including MDR, were found in diverse wildlife species, and the patterns and prevalence of resistance were not consistently associated with site and therefore different exposure risks. We conclude that AMR in commensal bacteria of wildlife is not driven simply by anthropogenic factors, and, in practical terms, this may limit the utility of wildlife as sentinels of spatial variation in the transmission of environmental AMR. © 2018},

abstract={Antimicrobial resistance is a major global public health challenge threatening the utility of antibiotics. Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing and sales, using outside of the health sectors, and genetic factors are mainly influencing the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Antibiotics abuse in human, wildlife, and farming practices have an enormous health impact. Recently approved antibiotics are anticipated to help stem this crisis. To fight against antibiotic resistance crisis, development of collaboration among concerned stakeholders to establish policies, initiatives, and investments for new agents can be auspicious. New methods of antibacterial drug identification and strategies, neutralize virulence factors, are the substitute approaches to address the AMR threat. Some novel approaches have also been taken to develop alternatives to typical antibiotics for bacterial infection. Here, we tried to highlight some of the key reasons behind antibiotic resistance, management, and burden. Moreover, this paper also discusses recent developments in this area and a brief overview of future antibacterial agents. © 2019 Alam MM et al.},

abstract={Chlamydia are a genus of successful obligate intracellular pathogens spread across humans, wildlife, and domesticated animals. The most common species reported in livestock in this genus are Chlamydia abortus, Chlamydia psittaci, Chlamydia suis, and Chlamydia pecorum. Chlamydial infections trigger a series of inflammatory disease-related sequelae including arthritis, conjunctivitis, pneumonia, and abortion. Other bacteria in the phylum Chlamydiae have also been reported in livestock and wildlife but their impact on animal health is less clear. Control of chlamydial infections relies on the use of macrolides, fluoroquinolones, and tetracyclines. Tetracycline resistance (TETR) reported for porcine C. suis strains in association with the use of tetracycline feed is a potentially significant concern given experimental evidence highlighting that the genetic elements inferring TETR may be horizontally transferred to other chlamydial species. As documented in human Chlamydia trachomatis infections, relapse of infections, bacterial shedding post-antibiotic treatment, and disease progression despite chlamydial clearance in animals have also been reported. The identification of novel chlamydiae as well as new animal hosts for previously described chlamydial pathogens should place a renewed emphasis on basic in vivo studies to demonstrate the efficacy of existing and new antimicrobial treatment regimes. Building on recent reviews of antimicrobials limited to C. trachomatis and C. suis, this review will explore the use of antimicrobials, the evidence and factors that influence the treatment failure of chlamydial infections in animals and the future directions in the control of these important veterinary pathogens.

abstract={Introduction: Goiás State, which is in the midwest region of Brazil, has several urban forests. This fact, along with the expansion of urban areas within the limits of Forest Conservation Units, increases the contact between humans and wildlife, such as capuchin monkeys. The impulsive behavior of these animals and the scarcity of food cause them to vigorously search for food, leading to direct encounters with Park visitors, which can result in scratches and bites and making them potential disseminators of pathogenic microorganisms. Methods: Ten specimens of bearded capuchin monkey (Sapajus libidinosus) were captured at the Onofre Quinan Environmental Park in Anápolis, Goiás, Brazil. Samples were collected from the monkeys, and the bacteria and fungi present in the samples were isolated and identified. Then, the identified microorganisms were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing. Results: A total of 111 bacteria and 12 fungi were isolated, including two strict anaerobic bacteria of the genus Peptostreptococcus, 109 facultative anaerobic bacteria, and 12 yeasts. Among the facultative bacteria, enterobacteria and Staphylococcus were common. Resistance to tetracycline and ampicillin antibiotics was detected in the enterobacteria, and resistance to tetracycline, erythromycin, and clindamycin was detected in the Staphylococci. The other strains were sensitive to all tested antimicrobials. Cefoxitin showed 100% efficacy in all isolated bacteria. Conclusions: For bites from capuchin monkeys, we recommend performing complete hygiene and antibiotic therapy, according to medical recommendations. Given the 100% effectiveness of cefoxitin, it should be considered for this type of injury, especially in the study region. © 2019, Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: Wild birds using livestock facilities for food and shelter may contribute to dissemination of enteric pathogens or antimicrobial resistant bacteria. However, drivers of microbial exchange among wildlife and livestock are not well characterized. Predisposition for acquiring and retaining environmental bacteria may vary among species because of physiologic or behavioral differences, complicating selection of a bacterial model that can accurately characterize microbial connections among hosts of interest. This study compares the prevalence and antibiotic resistance phenotypes of two potential model bacterial organisms isolated from wild birds and their environments. Methods: We compared prevalence and resistance profiles of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus species isolated from environmental swabs and bird feces on a residential control site, a confinement dairy, a pasture-based beef farm, and a confinement beef farm. Results: Bird feces at all sites had low-to-moderate prevalence of Escherichia coli (range: 17-47%), despite potential for exposure on farms (range: 63-97%). Few Escherichia coli were isolated from the control environment. Enterococcus faecalis was dominant in birds at both beef farms (62% and 81% of Enterococcus isolates) and low-to-moderately prevalent at the dairy and control sites (29% and 23% of isolates, respectively). Antimicrobial resistance prevalence was higher in farm samples compared to those from the residential control, but distribution of resistant isolates varied between the bacterial genera. Birds on all farms carried resistant Enterococcus at similar rates to that of the environment, but resistance was less common in bird-associated Escherichia coli despite presence of resistant isolates in the farm environment. Discussion: Bacterial species studied may affect how readily bacterial exchange among populations is detected. Selection of microbial models must carefully consider both the questions being posed and how findings might influence resulting management decisions. © Copyright 2019 Tormoehlen et al.},

abstract={Farmed salmon has become an important export commodity for many countries and regions. The expanding salmon aquaculture industry has, due to its rapid increase, resulted in environmental concerns, most notably relating to the interaction with wildlife, effects of effluents and discharges in local ecosystems, in some regions overuse of antibiotics and development of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)and high dependence on fish resources in feeds. As a response to these concerns, the industry has strengthened their efforts to improve practices and private led sustainability initiatives, including certification and eco-labelling, has become increasingly important. This study examines the differences between salmon farming governance policies in the four largest salmon producing regions; Norway, Chile, Scotland (UK)and British Columbia (Canada)and the Aquaculture Stewardship Council's (ASC)salmon standard. The purpose of the study is to clarify how the standard from a well-established eco-certification program compares to national or regional conventional standards, using additionality as measuring method. The paper concludes that at present the ASC standard has mainly three strong advantages over existing regional/national standards and these relate to; escape numbers allowed, antibiotic usage and fish resources in feed. Changing these three main divergences in the national/regional regulations would significantly improve some of the main sustainability issues with uncertified salmon farming. The study also finds that the potential additionality of the ASC standard can differ between regions, with the highest difference in Chile and lowest in Norway. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Probiotics can ameliorate diseases of humans and wildlife, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Host responses to interventions that change their microbiota are largely uncharacterized. We applied a consortium of four natural antifungal bacteria to the skin of endangered Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frogs, Rana sierrae, before experimental exposure to the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). The probiotic microbes did not persist, nor did they protect hosts, and skin peptide sampling indicated immune modulation. We characterized a novel skin defense peptide brevinin-1Ma (FLPILAGLAANLVPKLICSITKKC) that was downregulated by the probiotic treatment. Brevinin-1Ma was tested against a range of amphibian skin cultures and found to inhibit growth of fungal pathogens Bd and B. salamandrivorans, but enhanced the growth of probiotic bacteria including Janthinobacterium lividum, Chryseobacterium ureilyticum, Serratia grimesii, and Pseudomonas sp. While commonly thought of as antimicrobial peptides, here brevinin-1Ma showed promicrobial function, facilitating microbial growth. Thus, skin exposure to probiotic bacterial cultures induced a shift in skin defense peptide profiles that appeared to act as an immune response functioning to regulate the microbiome. In addition to direct microbial antagonism, probiotic-host interactions may be a critical mechanism affecting disease resistance. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Over the last few decades, worldwide detection of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in aquatic environments and the associated toxicological effects on wildlife and human health have become a matter of public and scientific debate. While life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) models are increasingly used to assess the potential eco- and human-toxicological effects of chemical emissions, few studies have looked into the issue of modeling pharmaceutical emissions specifically and their toxicity-related effects in an LCA context. This paper reviews the state of the art to inventory and characterize API emissions in LCA with the goal to identify relevant gaps and challenges. A search for 208 environmentally relevant APIs in 2 life cycle inventory (LCI) databases revealed a meager representation of this group of chemicals. Similarly, the LCIA model USEtox was found to include characterization factors (CFs) for less than 60 APIs. First approaches to model API emissions in LCA were identified on the basis of an examination of 40 LCA case studies in the pharmaceutical sector and in the field of wastewater treatment. Moreover, CFs for 79 additional APIs, expressing their ecotoxicity and/or human toxicity potential, were gathered from literature. An analysis of the variability of API-CFs in different LCIA models showed a variation of about 2–3 orders of magnitude. Based on the review results, 3 main gaps in the modeling and characterization of API emissions in an LCA context were identified: (1) incomplete modeling of API flows and API emissions along the life cycle of human pharmaceuticals, especially during their use and end-of-life phase, (2) limited API coverage in existing LCIA toxicity models, and (3) missing pharma-specific impact pathways (e.g., endocrine disruption and antibiotic resistance) in existing LCIA models. Recommendations to tackle these gaps are provided, and priority action steps are discussed. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2019;15:6–18. © 2018 SETAC. © 2018 SETAC},

abstract={In the past few decades, the medical community has faced a rising problem in the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and the difficulty of treating related infections. The presence of these bacteria in high-traffic bodies of water, as well as the presence of the antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) floating freely in the water, pose the threat of antibiotic-resistant related infections in individuals living and recreating in these areas of southeast Louisiana. Water samples from coastal waters of southeast Louisiana were analyzed using chemical, microbial, and molecular methods to determine the presence of ARB and ARG. The main species analyzed include Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Enterobacter spp. They were tested for resistance to carbapenem, monobactam, penicillin, tetracycline, sulfonamide, and cephalosporin antibiotics. The results indicated significant numbers of ARBs were consistently found in the coastal waters, and ARGs were found throughout testing. These results show that these high-traffic recreational bodies of water may be putting wildlife and humans at risk for antibiotic-resistant-related illnesses. © 2018 IWA Publishing.},

abstract={Antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria are a threat to global health. Epidemiological studies are necessary to gain a more detailed understanding of the transmission modality of resistant bacteria to wild animals and their diffusion into the environment to ensure a broader evaluation of the epidemiological role of wildlife. The study aimed to identify little-known epidemiological aspects by focusing on the isolation of Enterobacteriaceae in order to bring knowledge on the bacterial flora of wild mammals living in the National Park of Aspromonte (Calabria, Italy). Two hundred twenty-five faecal samples of wild mammals were collected and submitted to standard bacteriological examination for Enterobacteriaceae detection. Isolates were identified by mass spectrometry MALDI-TOF (matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation - time of fligt mass spectrometry). The 30 isolates showing the highest number of resistances were screened for Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase (ESBL) production. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the bacterial isolates was performed by the disk diffusion method. Two hundred sixty-three strains were isolated. The most frequently recovered bacterial species were Hafnia alvei, Escherichia coli and Citrobacter spp. Potentially pathogenic species including Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica and Serratia marcescens have also been identified. Isolates displayed significant frequencies of antibiotic resistance. The resistance to amoxicillin (71.4%) was the most frequent, followed by amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (55.5%), ampicillin (49.8%), streptomycin (35.7%), doxycycline (16.3%), tobramycin (15.2%), tetracycline (13.3%) and gentamicin (10.6%). Nine strains showed resistance to imipenem and 1 to meropenem. All isolates were negative for the presence of ESBL-encoding genes. Wild animals can be regarded as sentinel species and used as environmental health indicators. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Escherichia coli is a major pathogen leading to systemic and enteric illnesses in wild giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). To investigate the characteristics and distribution of E. coli in wild giant pandas across four different nature reserves in Sichuan, Republic of China, we researched serotypes, phylogenetic groups, antimicrobial resistance, and resistance genes of E. coli not previously reported for wild giant pandas. A total of 82 E. coli isolates were identified from 40 fecal samples in August 2016 to May 2017. The most-prevalent serogroups were O15 (4%, 3/82), O28 (2%, 2/82), and O44 (2%, 2/82). Antimicrobial resistance was highest for streptomycin (61%, 50/82) followed by amikacin (30%, 25/82). Among the four nature reserves, the proportion of streptomycin (86%, 12/14) and amikacin (57%, 8/14) was highest in Liziping. The frequencies of resistant genes aph(30 )-IIa, ant(300 )-Ia, aac(3)-IIa, aadA1, and StrB were 28, 23, 5, 21, and 32%, respectively, while none of the strains had the tetracycline gene. In Qianfoshan, the phylogenetic group B2 was the most common, comprising the highest percentage of isolates compared with the other seven phylogenetic groups. Furthermore, many variables such as phylogenetic groups, antimicrobial susceptibility, and resistance genes differed significantly (P,0.05) among the four nature reserves. In facilitating the safe discharge of captive giant pandas into the wild, as well as to support existing wild populations, the data from this research will prove invaluable to scientists and ecologists in their endeavors. © 2018, Wildlife Disease Association, Inc..

abstract={Escherichia coli sequence type 131 (ST131) is currently one of the leading causes of multidrug-resistant extraintestinal infections globally. Here, we analyzed the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of 169 ST131 isolates from various sources (wildlife, wastewater, companion animals, community, and hospitals) to determine whether wildlife and the environment share similar strains with humans, supporting transmission of ST131 between different ecological niches. Susceptibility to 32 antimicrobials was tested by disc diffusion and broth microdilution. Antibiotic resistance genes, integrons, plasmid replicons, 52 virulence genes, and fimH-based subtypes were detected by PCR and DNA sequencing. Genomic relatedness was determined by pulsedfield gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The genetic context and plasmid versus chromosomal location of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and AmpC beta-lactamase genes was determined by PCR and probe hybridization, respectively. The 169 ST131 study isolates segregated predominantly into blaCTX-M-15 H30Rx (60%) and blaCTX-M-27 H30R1 (25%) subclones. Within each subclone, isolates from different source groups were categorized into distinct PFGE clusters; genotypic characteristics were fairly well conserved within each major PFGE cluster. Irrespective of source, the blaCTX-M-15 H30Rx isolates typically exhibited virotype A (89%), an F2:A1:B-replicon (84%), and a 1.7-kb class 1 integron (92%) and had diverse structures upstream of the blaCTX-M region. In contrast, the blaCTX-M-27 H30R1 isolates typically exhibited virotype C (86%), an F1:A2:B20 replicon (76%), and a conserved IS26-ΔISEcp1-blaCTX-M-like structure. Despite considerable overall genetic diversity, our data demonstrate significant commonality between E. coli ST131 isolates from diverse environments, supporting transmission between different sources, including humans, environment, and wildlife. © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.},

abstract={Little is known about the role of surface water in the propagation of antibiotic resistance (AR), or the relationship between AR and water quality declines. While healthcare and agricultural sectors are considered the main contributors to AR dissemination, few studies have been conducted in their absence. Using linear models and Bayesian kriging, we evaluate AR among Escherichia coli water isolates collected bimonthly from the Chobe River in Northern Botswana (n = 1997, n = 414 water samples; July 2011-May 2012) in relation to water quality dynamics (E. coli, fecal coliform, and total suspended solids), land use, season, and AR in wildlife and humans within this system. No commercial agricultural or large medical facilities exist within this region. Here, we identify widespread AR in surface water, with land use and season significant predicators of AR levels. Mean AR was significantly higher in the wet season than the dry season (p = 0.003), and highest in the urban landscape (2.15, SD = 0.098) than the protected landscape (1.39, SD = 0.051). In-water E. coli concentrations were significantly positively associated with mean AR in the wet season (p < 0.001) but not in the dry season (p = 0.110), with TSS negatively associated with mean AR across seasons (p = 0.016 and p = 0.029), identifying temporal and spatial relationships between water quality variables and AR. Importantly, when human, water, and wildlife isolates were examined, similar AR profiles were identified (p < 0.001). Our results suggest that direct human inputs are sufficient for extensive dispersal of AR into the environment, with landscape features, season, and water quality variables influencing AR dynamics. Focused and expensive efforts to minimize pollution from agricultural sources, while important, may only provide incremental benefits to the management of AR across complex landscapes. Controlling direct human AR inputs into the environment remains a critical and pressing challenge. © 2018 Sanderson, Fox, Dougherty, Cameron and Alexander.},

abstract={Multidrug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria have been increasingly reported in humans, companion animals and farm animals. The growing trend of plasmid-mediated resistance to antimicrobial classes of critical importance is attributed to the emergence of epidemic plasmids, rapidly disseminating resistance genes among the members of Enterobacteriaceae family. The use of antibiotics to treat humans and animals has had a significant impact on the environment and on wild animals living and feeding in human-influenced habitats. Wildlife can acquire MDR bacteria selected in hospitals, community or livestock from diverse sources, including wastewater, sewage systems, landfills, farm facilities or agriculture fields. Therefore, wild animals are considered indicators of environmental pollution by antibiotic resistant bacteria, but they can also act as reservoirs and vectors spreading antibiotic resistance across the globe. The level of resistance and reported plasmid-mediated resistance mechanisms observed in bacteria of wildlife origin seem to correlate well with the situation described in humans and domestic animals. Additionaly, the identification of epidemic plasmids in samples from different human, animal and wildlife sources underlines the role of horizontal gene transfer in the dissemination of resistance genes. The present review focuses on reports of plasmid-mediated resistance to critically important antimicrobial classes such as broad-spectrum beta-lactams and colistin in Enterobacteriaceae isolates from samples of wildlife origin. The role of plasmids in the dissemination of ESBL-, AmpC- and carbapenemase-encoding genes as well as plasmid-mediated colistin resistance determinants in wildlife are discussed, and their similarities to plasmids previously identified in samples of human clinical or livestock origin are highlighted. Furthermore, we present features of completely sequenced plasmids reported from wildlife Enterobacteriaceae isolates, with special focus on genes that could be associated with the plasticity and stable maintenance of these molecules in antibiotic-free environments. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Occurrence of Salmonella spp. in captive wild animal species in India is largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the occurrence of different Salmonella serotypes, antimicrobial resistance patterns and genotypic relatedness of recovered isolates. A total of 370 samples including faecal (n = 314), feed and water (n = 26) and caretakers stool swabs (n = 30) were collected from 40 different wild animal species in captivity, their caretakers, feed and water in four zoological gardens and wildlife enclosures in India. Salmonellae were isolated using conventional culture methods and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility with the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Salmonella isolates were serotyped and genotyping was performed using enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) PCR and 16S rRNA sequencing. Animal faecal samples were also subjected to direct PCR assay. Salmonella was detected in 10 of 314 (3.1%) faecal samples by isolation and 18 of 314 (5.7%) samples by direct PCR assay; one of 26 (3.8%) feed and water samples and five of 30 (16.7%) caretakers stool swabs by isolation. Salmonella was more commonly isolated in faecal samples from golden pheasants (25%; 2/8) and leopard (10%; 2/20). Salmonella enterica serotypes of known public health significance including S. Typhimurium (37.5%; 6/14), S. Kentucky (28.5%; 4/14) and S. Enteritidis (14.3%; 2/14) were identified. While the majority of the Salmonella isolates were pan-susceptible to the commonly used antibiotics. Seven (43.7%; 7/16) of the isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic and one isolate each among them exhibited penta and tetra multidrug-resistant types. Three S. Kentucky serotype were identified in a same golden pheasants cage, two from the birds and one from the feed. This serotype was also isolated from its caretaker. Similarly, one isolate each of S. Typhimurium were recovered from ostrich and its caretaker. These isolates were found to be clonally related suggesting that wildlife may serve as reservoir for infections to humans and vice versa. These results emphasise the transmission of Salmonella among hosts via environmental contamination of feces to workers, visitors and other wildlife. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2018.},

abstract={Background: The aim of the present study was to screen for the presence of mcr-1 gene in Enterobacteriaceae isolated from Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus) in Algeria. Materials and Methods: From January to April 2016, a total of 86 fresh stool samples from Barbary macaques were collected in the Toudja forest (Bejaia, Algeria). After isolation, the isolates were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion method, and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of colistin was determined by E-test. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing were used to identify mcr-1gene. The sequence type (ST) was done using multilocus sequence typing. Phylogenetic groups of Escherichia coli and the presence of virulence genes were determined by PCR. Transfer of mcr-1 and extended-spectrum β-lactamase genes was assessed by conjugation and transformation experiments. Results: E. coli M076 isolate was found resistant to colistin with a MIC of 4 mg/L and to other antibiotic families, including β-lactams, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. PCR and sequencing revealed that this isolate harbored the mcr-1, blaCTX-M-15, blaTEM-1, and qnrB19 genes. This isolate was assigned to ST405, belonged to phylogroup D, and contains only one virulence gene fyuA (siderophore uptake receptor). Neither transconjugants nor transformants were obtained for this isolate. Conclusion: In this study, we report the detection of mcr-1 gene producing E. coli from wild animals. © 2018 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract={The spread of antimicrobial resistance from human activity derived sources to natural habitats implicates wildlife as potential vectors of antimicrobial resistance transfer. Wild birds, including corvid species can disseminate mobile genetic resistance determinants through faeces. This study aimed to determine the occurrence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. isolates obtained from winter roosting sites of American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) and common ravens (Corvus corax) in Canada. Faecal swabs were collected at five roosting sites across Canada. Selective media isolation and multiplex PCR screening was utilized to identify PMQR genes followed by gene sequencing, pulse-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing to characterize isolates. Despite the low prevalence of E. coli containing PMQR (1·3%, 6/449), qnrS1, qnrB19, qnrC, oqxAB and aac(6′)-Ib-cr genes were found in five sequence types (ST), including E. coli ST 131. Conversely, one isolate of Klebsiella pneumoniae contained the plasmid-mediated resistance gene qnrB19. Five different K. pneumoniae STs were identified, including two novel types. The occurrence of PMQR genes and STs of public health significance in E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae recovered from corvids gives further evidence of the anthropogenic derived dissemination of antimicrobial resistance determinants at the human activity-wildlife-environment interface. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study examined large corvids as possible vector species for the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance in indicator and pathogenic bacteria as a means to assess the anthropogenic dissemination of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes. Although rare, PMQR genes were found among corvid populations across Canada. The clinically important Escherichia coli strain ST131 containing aac(6′)-Ib-cr gene along with a four-class phenotypic antimicrobial resistance (AMR) pattern as well as one Klebsiella pneumoniae strain containing a qnrB19 gene were identified in one geographical location. Corvids are a viable vector for the circulation of PMQR genes and clinically important clones in wide-ranging environments. © 2018 The Society for Applied Microbiology},

abstract={The dissemination of human-associated bacteria into the marine environment has the potential to expose wildlife populations to atypical microbes that can alter the composition of the gut microbiome or act as pathogens. The objective of the study was to determine whether endangered Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea) pups from two South Australian colonies, Seal Bay, Kangaroo Island and Dangerous Reef, Spencer Gulf, have been colonised by human-associated Escherichia coli. Faecal samples (n = 111) were collected to isolate E. coli, and molecular screening was applied to assign E. coli isolates (n = 94) to phylotypes and detect class 1 integrons; mobile genetic elements that confer resistance to antimicrobial agents. E. coli phylotype distribution and frequency differed significantly between colonies with phylotypes B2 and D being the most abundant at Seal Bay, Kangaroo Island (55% and 7%) and Dangerous Reef, Spencer Gulf (36% and 49%), respectively. This study reports the first case of antimicrobial resistant E. coli in free-ranging Australian sea lions through the identification of class 1 integrons from an individual pup at Seal Bay. A significant relationship between phylotype and total white cell count (WCC) was identified, with significantly higher WCC seen in pups with human-associated phylotypes at Dangerous Reef. The difference in phylotype distribution and presence of human-associated E. coli suggests that proximity to human populations can influence sea lion gut microbiota. The identification of antimicrobial resistance in a free-ranging pinniped population provides crucial information concerning anthropogenic influences in the marine environment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Actinobacteria are often known to be great producers of antibiotics. The rapid increase in the global burden of antibiotic-resistance with the concurrent decline in the discovery of new antimicrobial molecules necessitates the search for novel and effective antimicrobial metabolites from unexplored ecological niches. The present study investigated the antimicrobial producing actinobacterial strains isolated from the soils of two microbiologically unexplored forest ecosystems, viz. Nameri National Park (NNP) and Panidehing Wildlife Sanctuary (PWS), located in the Eastern Himalayan Biodiversity hotspot region. Results: A total of 172 putative isolates of actinobacteria were isolated, of which 24 isolates showed strong antimicrobial bioactivity. Evaluation of the ethyl acetate extracts of culture supernatants against test microbial strains revealed that isolates PWS22, PWS41, PWS12, PWS52, PWS11, NNPR15, NNPR38, and NNPR69 were the potent producers of antimicrobial metabolites. The antimicrobial isolates dominantly belonged to Streptomyces, followed by Nocardia and Streptosporangium. Some of these isolates could be putative novel taxa. Analysis of the antimicrobial biosynthetic genes (type II polyketide synthase and nonribosomal peptide synthetase genes) showed that the antimicrobial metabolites were associated with pigment production and belonged to known families of bioactive secondary metabolites. Characterization of the antimicrobial metabolites of Streptomyces sp. PWS52, which showed lowest taxonomic identity among the studied potent antimicrobial metabolite producers, and their interaction with the test strains using GC-MS, UHPLC-MS, and scanning electron microscopy revealed that the potential bioactivity of PWS52 was due to the production of active antifungal and antibacterial metabolites like 2,5-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl) phenol, benzeneacetic acid and nalidixic acid. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the unexplored soil habitats of NNP and PWS forest ecosystems of Northeast India harbor previously undescribed actinobacteria with the capability to produce diverse antimicrobial metabolites that may be explored to overcome the rapidly rising global concern about antibiotic-resistance. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Bluffer’s Park Beach in the Toronto and Region Area of Concern had a history of beach postings often exceeding 80% of the beach season since the 1980s. A study applied expanded E. coli surveillance and microbial source tracking techniques in 2005–2007 to identify fecal pollution sources contributing to beach postings. Expanded surveillance in the beach vicinity identified significant E. coli hotspots in the foreshore beach sand (pore water max E. coli = 255,000 CFU 100 ml−1) and associated with a marsh inland of the beach. During rain events, streams from the marsh (max E. coli = 173,000 CFU 100 ml−1) and runoff from the parking lot (max E. coli = 4100 CFU 100 ml−1) were observed to overflow across the beach to contaminate beach waters. Microbial source tracking using library-dependent (antibiotic resistance and rep-PCR DNA fingerprinting of E. coli isolates) and library-independent (human HF183 bacterial DNA marker) methods indicated the prevalence of animal fecal pollution sources at the beach rather than human sewage. These results were consistent with sanitary survey information, observations of wildlife in the marsh area, and Gulls and Canada Geese on the beach. In 2006, a bird management program was initiated, and remedial actions continued in advance of the 2008 bathing season to engineer a berm to prevent marsh runoff into beach water and re-direct parking lot drainage into the marsh. Since these remediation actions, Bluffer’s Park Beach has been posted less than 20% of each beach season, and it was awarded a Blue Flag accreditation in 2011. © 2018, Copyright © 2018 AEHMS.},

abstract={Antimicrobial resistance was tested in Escherichia coli isolated from feces (n = 660) of red deer, roe deer, fallow deer, European bison, and wild boar shot in regional forests in Poland during two winter hunting seasons. Indicator E. coli (n = 542) was resistant against 11 of 14 tested compounds, mostly sulfamethoxazole, streptomycin, ampicillin, trimethoprim, and tetracycline (1.3-6.6% range). No significant differences were observed between boar and ruminant isolates. Most of deer and bison isolates showed no resistance. Selective screening of wildlife samples revealed 1.7% prevalence of cephalosporin-resistant E. coli found mostly in wild boars. They produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-15) and plasmid-mediated AmpC-type cephalosporinase (blaCMY-2). The majority of the isolates originated from boars shot in a narrow time frame and space; therefore, common antimicrobial selection pressure in the environment was assumed. Three E. coli isolates carried plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes (qnrS1/S3). No transferable colistin resistance mechanisms were found in two resistant E. coli. Transferability of resistance was proved in a single pAmpC-positive isolate carrying IncI1-alpha 95 kb plasmid. No cephalosporin-resistant E. coli harbored pathogenicity markers; therefore, they might be considered a vector of resistance determinants, but not a pathogen themselves. © 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2018.},

abstract={Background: Environmentally growing pathogens present an increasing threat for human health, wildlife and food production. Treating the hosts with antibiotics or parasitic bacteriophages fail to eliminate diseases that grow also in the outside-host environment. However, bacteriophages could be utilized to suppress the pathogen population sizes in the outside-host environment in order to prevent disease outbreaks. Here, we introduce a novel epidemiological model to assess how the phage infections of the bacterial pathogens affect epidemiological dynamics of the environmentally growing pathogens. We assess whether the phage therapy in the outside-host environment could be utilized as a biological control method against these diseases. We also consider how phage-resistant competitors affect the outcome, a common problem in phage therapy. The models give predictions for the scenarios where the outside-host phage therapy will work and where it will fail to control the disease. Parameterization of the model is based on the fish columnaris disease that causes significant economic losses to aquaculture worldwide. However, the model is also suitable for other environmentally growing bacterial diseases. Results: Transmission rates of the phage determine the success of infectious disease control, with high-transmission phage enabling the recovery of the host population that would in the absence of the phage go asymptotically extinct due to the disease. In the presence of outside-host bacterial competition between the pathogen and phage-resistant strain, the trade-off between the pathogen infectivity and the phage resistance determines phage therapy outcome from stable coexistence to local host extinction. Conclusions: We propose that the success of phage therapy strongly depends on the underlying biology, such as the strength of trade-off between the pathogen infectivity and the phage-resistance, as well as on the rate that the phages infect the bacteria. Our results indicate that phage therapy can fail if there are phage-resistant bacteria and the trade-off between pathogen infectivity and phage resistance does not completely inhibit the pathogen infectivity. Also, the rate that the phages infect the bacteria should be sufficiently high for phage-therapy to succeed. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Antibiotic resistance mediated by bacterial production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) is a global threat to public health. ESBL resistance is most commonly hospital-acquired; however, infections acquired outside of hospital settings have raised concerns over the role of livestock and wildlife in the zoonotic spread of ESBL-producing bacteria. Only limited data are available on the circulation of ESBL-producing bacteria in animals. Here, we report ESBL-producing Escherichia coli in wild common vampire bats Desmodus rotundus and livestock near Lima, Peru. Molecular analyses revealed that most of this resistance resulted from the expression of bla CTX-M-15 genes carried by plasmids, which are disseminating worldwide in hospital settings and have also been observed in healthy children of Peru. Multilocus sequence typing showed a diverse pool of E. coli strains carrying this resistance that were not always host species-specific, suggesting sharing of strains between species or infection from a common source. This study shows widespread ESBL resistance in wild and domestic animals, supporting animal communities as a potential source of resistance. Future work is needed to elucidate the role of bats in the dissemination of antibiotic-resistant strains of public health importance and to understand the origin of the observed resistance. © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Wild birds have repeatedly been highlighted as vectors in the dissemination of livestock and human pathogens. Here, the occurrence, serotypes and antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella were assessed in adult Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus), to test the hypothesis that infection is associated with the consumption of swine carcasses provided at supplementary feeding stations (SFSs). Faeces of year-round resident griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) were also tested to assess whether infection was acquired in the breeding grounds of both species or in the African wintering quarters of Egyptian vultures. Depending on the shedding rate criteria considered, the occurrence of infection in Egyptian vultures varied between the three consecutive sampling days in a range with a minimum of 23%–41% and a maximum of 64%–92% of individuals (n = 11–14 individuals, 27–39 faeces). The occurrence in the single sampling of griffon vultures was 61% of faeces (n = 18). Vultures mostly fed on pig carcasses, which together with their predominant infection with multiresistant serotypes (mostly the monophasic 4,12:i:- variant resistant to aminopenicillins, aminoglycosides and tetracyclines) typically found in pigs from Spain, strongly supports a carcass-to-vulture transmission and cross-infection routes at SFSs. Efforts are encouraged to avoid discarding carcasses of pigs with Salmonella at SFSs established for the conservation of threatened scavengers. This could contribute to reducing the long-distance transmission of resistant pathogens with an impact on livestock and human health while avoiding infection risk and its effects on wildlife. © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Antimicrobial resistance of Staphylococcus aureus is a major problem in human and veterinary medicine. The aim of this study was to characterise S. aureus isolates from wild and zoo animals mainly associated with bacterial infections. In total, 23 S. aureus isolates, including nine from wild animals and 14 from zoo animals, were obtained during routine diagnostics. All isolates were subjected to multilocus sequence typing (MLST), spa typing, macrorestriction analysis with subsequent SmaI pulsed-field gelelectrophoresis (PFGE), antimicrobial susceptibility testing and S. aureus-specific DNA-microarray analysis. Resistant isolates were also tested for their respective resistance genes by PCR. Isolates from zoo animals and wildlife showed a high diversity of MLST types, spa types and PFGE patterns. Nineteen different spa types were identified, including three novel types and 16 main macrorestriction patterns. Only few isolates were resistant to members of four classes of antimicrobial agents and harboured the respective resistance genes (β-lactams [blaZ, mecA, mecC], tetracyclines [tet(K), tet(L)] and chloramphenicol [cat pC221 ]) or mutations (fluoroquinolones). The DNA microarray analysis identified one isolate from a zoo animal harbouring the toxic shock syndrome toxin gene tst1. Moreover, several enterotoxin genes were detected in five S. aureus isolates. All isolates were negative for Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes, but the animal-associated leukocidin genes lukM/lukF-P83 were found in three isolates from two animals. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={There is a worldwide problem of disease caused by Mycoplasma (M.) bovis in cattle; it has a significant detrimental economic and animal welfare impact on cattle rearing. Infection can manifest as a plethora of clinical signs including mastitis, pneumonia, arthritis, keratoconjunctivitis, otitis media and genital disorders that may result in infertility and abortion. Current diagnosis and control information are reviewed and analysed to identify gaps in knowledge of the causative organism in respect of the disease pathology, diagnosis and control methods. The main considerations are as follows: no vaccines are commercially available; antimicrobial resistance is increasing; diagnostic and antimicrobial sensitivity testing needs to be improved; and a pen-side test would facilitate more rapid diagnosis and implementation of treatment with antimicrobials. More data on host susceptibility, stress factors, immune response and infectious dose levels are required. The impact of asymptomatic carriers, M. bovis survival in the environment and the role of wildlife in transmitting the disease also needs investigation. To facilitate development of vaccines, further analysis of more M. bovis genomes, its pathogenic mechanisms, including variable surface proteins, is required, along with reproducible disease models. © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={We assessed the antibiotic resistance and genetic diversity of 27 Enterococcus faecalis isolates from 25 wild bird species in Poland. Resistance to lincomycin (100%) was most common followed by tetracycline (48%), erythromycin (44%), and ciprofloxacin (22%). High-level resistance to streptomycin and kanamycin was observed in 19% and 15% of isolates, respectively. One isolate (4%) exhibited low-level resistance to penicillin and vancomycin, and all isolates were susceptible to gentamicin and chloramphenicol. Antibiotic resistance was linked to the tet(M), tet(L), erm(A), erm(B), msr(A/B), ant(6)-Ia, and aph(3′)-IIIa genes. None of the tested van (vanA, vanB, vanC1, vanC2/C3, vanD, vanE, vanG) genes were found in the vancomycin-resistant isolate. Based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing analysis, the E. faecalis population from wild birds revealed high genetic diversity. All isolates were divided into 22 pulsotypes and 18 sequence types (STs), among which seven STs were newly assigned (ST748-ST753 and ST764). The most-prevalent STs were ST290 and ST374 followed by ST287 and ST34. The coexistence of strains assigned to the same STs in wild birds and in nonwildlife populations strongly indicated that many wild bird species could constitute a source of E. faecalis for infections in humans, pets, and farm animals. © Wildlife Disease Association 2018.},

abstract={The aim of the present study was to screen for the presence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) isolates from wild boars and Barbary macaques in Algeria. Fecal samples were collected from wild boars (n = 168) and Barbary macaques (n = 212), in Bejaia, Algeria, between September 2014 and April 2016. The isolates were identified and antimicrobial susceptibility was determined. Carbapenem resistance determinants were studied using PCR and sequencing, while clonal relatedness was performed using multilocus sequence typing (MLST). PCR was used to investigate certain virulence genes. Three CPE isolates from three different samples (1.8%) recovered from wild boars were identified as Escherichia coli (two isolates) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (one isolate). These isolates were resistant to amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, tobramycin, ertapenem, and meropenem. The results of PCR and sequencing analysis showed that all three isolates produced the OXA-48 enzyme. The MLST showed that the two E. coli isolates were assigned to the same sequence type, ST635, and belonged to phylogroup A, whereas K. pneumoniae strain belonged to ST13. The K. pneumoniae strain was positive for multiple virulence factors, whereas no virulence determinants were found in E. coli isolates.

abstract={The emergence and spread of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) in wildlife and livestock animals pose an important safety concern for public health. With our in vivo broiler chicken infection study, we investigated the transfer and experimental microevolution of the blaNDM-1-carrying IncA/C 2 plasmid (pRH-1238) introduced by avian native Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Corvallis without inducing antibiotic selection pressure. We evaluated the dependency of the time point of inoculation on donor (S. Corvallis [12-SA01738]) and plasmid-free Salmonella recipient [D-tartrate-fermenting (D-Ta + ) S. Paratyphi B (13- SA01617), referred to here as S. Paratyphi B (D-Ta + )] excretion by quantifying their excretion dynamics. Using plasmid profiling by S1 nuclease-restricted pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, we gained insight into the variability of the native plasmid content among S. Corvallis reisolates as well as plasmid acquisition in S. Paratyphi B (D-Ta + ) and the enterobacterial gut microflora. Whole-genome sequencing enabled us to gain an in-depth insight into the microevolution of plasmid pRH-1238 in S. Corvallis and enterobacterial recipient isolates. Our study revealed that the fecal excretion of avian native carbapenemase-producing S. Corvallis is significantly higher than that of S. Paratyphi (D-Ta + ) and is not hampered by S. Paratyphi (D-Ta + ). Acquisition of pRH-1238 in other Enterobacteriaceae and several events of plasmid pRH-1238 transfer to different Escherichia coli sequence types and Klebsiella pneumoniae demonstrated an interspecies broad host range. Regardless of the microevolutionary structural deletions in pRH-1238, the single carbapenem resistance marker blaNDM-1 was maintained on pRH-1238 throughout the trial. Furthermore, we showed the importance of the gut E. coli population as a vector of pRH-1238. In a potential scenario of the introduction of NDM-1-producing S. Corvallis into a broiler flock, the pRH-1238 plasmid could persist and spread to a broad host range even in the absence of antibiotic pressure. © Copyright 2018 Hadziabdic et al.},

abstract={Background: Antibiotic treatments are indispensable for human and animal health. However, the heavy usage of antibiotics has led to the emergence of resistance. Antibiotic residues, antibiotic-resistant bacteria and genes are introduced into the terrestrial and aquatic environments via application of human and animal wastes. The emergence and the spread of antibiotic resistance in environmental reservoirs (i.e., soil, water, wildlife) threatens the efficacy of all antibiotics. Therefore, there is an urgent need to determine what effective solutions exist to minimize the dissemination of antibiotic resistance in the environment. The aim of this article is to describe the protocol of a systematic review of the literature considering these solutions. Methods: The primary questions addressed by the systematic review protocol are: how antibiotic resistance in the environment is impacted by changes in practice concerning (i) the use of antibiotics, (ii) the management of wastes or (iii) the management of the natural compartment. Bibliographic searches will be made in eleven publication databases as well as in specialist databases. Grey literature will also be searched. Articles will be screened regarding the inclusion and exclusion criteria at title, abstract and full-text levels. Studies where a causal relationship between the intervention and the outcome is made will be retained. After critical appraisal, data from the selected articles will be extracted and saved in a database validated by the expert panel. Study quality will be assessed by critical appraisal. Data will be compiled into a qualitative synthesis. If data availability and quality allow it, a quantitative synthesis will be carried out. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={One Health is the collaborative effort of multiple health science professions to attain optimal health for people, domestic animals, wildlife, plants, and our environment. The drivers of antimicrobial resistance include antimicrobial use and abuse in human, animal, and environmental sectors and the spread of resistant bacteria and resistance determinants within and between these sectors and around the globe. Most of the classes of antimicrobials used to treat bacterial infections in humans are also used in animals. Given the important and interdependent human, animal, and environmental dimensions of antimicrobial resistance, it is logical to take a One Health approach when addressing this problem. This includes taking steps to preserve the continued effectiveness of existing antimicrobials by eliminating their inappropriate use and by limiting the spread of infection. Major concerns in the animal health and agriculture sectors are mass medication of animals with antimicrobials that are critically important for humans, such as third-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, and the long-term, in-feed use of medically important antimicrobials, such as colistin, tetracyclines, and macrolides, for growth promotion. In the human sector it is essential to prevent infections, reduce over-prescribing of antimicrobials, improve sanitation, and improve hygiene and infection control. Pollution from inadequate treatment of industrial, residential, and farm waste is expanding the resistome in the environment. Numerous countries and several international agencies have included a One Health approach within their action plans to address antimicrobial resistance. Necessary actions include improvements in antimicrobial use regulation and policy, surveillance, stewardship, infection control, sanitation, animal husbandry, and alternatives to antimicrobials. WHO recently has launched new guidelines on the use of medically important antimicrobials in food-producing animals, recommending that farmers and the food industry stop using antimicrobials routinely to promote growth and prevent disease in healthy animals. These guidelines aim to help preserve the effectiveness of antimicrobials that are important for human medicine by reducing their use in animals. © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.},

abstract={Objectives The incidence of multidrug-resistant bacteria in wildlife animals has been investigated to improve our knowledge of the spread of clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance genes. The aim of this study was to report the first draft genome sequence of an extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa ST644 isolate recovered from a Magellanic penguin with a footpad infection (bumblefoot) undergoing rehabilitation process. Methods The genome was sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq® platform using 150-bp paired-end reads. De novo genome assembly was performed using Velvet v.1.2.10, and the whole genome sequence was evaluated using bioinformatics approaches from the Center of Genomic Epidemiology, whereas an in-house method (mapping of raw whole genome sequence reads) was used to identify chromosomal point mutations. Results The genome size was calculated at 6 436 450 bp, with 6357 protein-coding sequences and the presence of genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, β-lactams, phenicols, sulphonamides, tetracyclines, quinolones and fosfomycin; in addition, mutations in the genes gyrA (Thr83Ile), parC (Ser87Leu), phoQ (Arg61His) and pmrB (Tyr345His), conferring resistance to quinolones and polymyxins, respectively, were confirmed. Conclusion This draft genome sequence can provide useful information for comparative genomic analysis regarding the dissemination of clinically significant antibiotic resistance genes and XDR bacterial species at the human–animal interface. © 2017 International Society for Chemotherapy of Infection and Cancer},

abstract={Bats are economically important animals and serve as food sources in some African regions. They can be colonized with the Staphylococcus aureus complex, which includes Staphylococcus schweitzeri and Staphylococcus argenteus. Fecal carriage of S. aureus complex in the straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) has been described. However, data on their transmission and adaptation in animals and humans are limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the population structure of the S. aureus complex in E. helvum and to assess the geographical spread of S. aureus complex among other animals and humans. Fecal samples were collected from E. helvum in Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. The isolates were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, spa typing and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Isolates were screened for the presence of lukS/lukF-PV and the immune evasion cluster (scn, sak, chp) which is frequently found in isolates adapted to the human host. A Neighbor-Joining tree was constructed using the concatenated sequences of the seven MLST genes. A total of 250 fecal samples were collected and 53 isolates were included in the final analysis. They were identified as S. aureus (n = 28), S. schweitzeri (n = 11) and S. argenteus (n = 14). Only one S. aureus was resistant to penicillin and another isolate was intermediately susceptible to tetracycline. The scn, sak, and chp gene were not detected. Species-specific MLST clonal complexes (CC) were detected for S. aureus (CC1725), S. argenteus (CC3960, CC3961), and S. schweitzeri (CC2463). STs of S. schweitzeri from this study were similar to STs from bats in Nigeria (ST2464) and Gabon (ST1700) or from monkey in Côte d'Ivoire (ST2058, ST2072). This suggests host adaptation of certain clones to wildlife mammals with a wide geographical spread in Africa. In conclusion, there is evidence of fecal carriage of members of S. aureus complex in E. helvum. S. schweitzeri from bats in Nigeria are closely related to those from bats and monkeys in West and Central Africa suggesting a cross-species transmission and wide geographical distribution. The low antimicrobial resistance rates and the absence of the immune evasion cluster suggests a limited exposure of these isolates to humans. © 2018 Olatimehin, Shittu, Onwugamba, Mellmann, Becker and Schaumburg.},

abstract={High-risk ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) have been described in wild birds and rodents worldwide. Rats are of special interest not only due to their indicator role for environmental pollution with multi-resistant bacteria but also as possible infection source. Data on the presence of high-risk ESBL-E in urban wildlife from Africa remain scarce, however. Twenty-nine animals from three different rat (Rattus) species were captured in the city of Conakry (Guinea, West Africa) in 2015. Rectal swabs were analyzed for ESBL-E using selective media. Species typing and phenotypic antimicrobial resistance analysis to broad-spectrum beta-lactams and other classes of antimicrobials was performed for Enterobacteriaceae-like isolates using the VITEK®2 system (BioMérieux, Germany). Confirmed ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae were whole-genome sequenced and resistance genes, phylogenetic background and genes related to bacterial fitness and virulence were analyzed. In total, six of twenty-nine rats (20%) carried ESBL-E (K. pneumoniae and E. coli). All ESBL-producers were multi-drug resistant with blaCTX-M-15 as the dominating ESBL-type. Interestingly, ESBL-associated clonal lineages E. coli ST38 and K. pneumoniae ST307 were found. The ESBL-plasmid in K. pneumoniae ST307 revealed high sequence similarities to pKPN3-307_TypeC, a &gt; 200 kbp IncFII plasmid originating from a human clinical ST307 isolate. This was in contrast to the core genome: the rat isolate was distantly related to the human clinical ST307 isolate (27 SNPs/Mbp). In addition, we identified p-fimbrial, capsule 2, and glycogen synthesis clusters in the rodent ST307 isolate, whose involvement in the adaptation to survival outside the host and in human urinary tracts has been suggested. Our results demonstrate the presence of clinically relevant, ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae ST307 and E. coli ST38 clonal lineages in an urban West African rat population. The human community is likely the initial source of ESBL-E however, rats might function as infection source and transmission hub, accelerated by frequent interactions at a human-wildlife interface. © 2018 Schaufler, Nowak, Düx, Semmler, Villa, Kourouma, Bangoura, Wieler, Leendertz and Guenther.},

abstract={Antimicrobial resistance is an emerging worldwide concern, as the use of antibiotics is crucial for human and animal health protection. Evaluations of the antimicrobial susceptibility of enteric microbiota can be used as an indicator of resistance dispersion in the environment. Commensal intestinal bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp., often act as reservoirs for antimicrobial resistance determinants and may allow gene transfer to animal or human pathogens present in the same habitats, including contaminated water. As contact between wild animals and human and domestic animal populations is increasing, the potential for dissemination of resistant pathogens to wildlife can be considered an emerging problem. This study aimed to confirm the potential of the intestinal commensal bacteria of otters as a model for assessing antimicrobial resistance dissemination in the environment. We evaluated the presence of antimicrobial-resistant enterococci in spraints from Eurasian and Neotropical otters, collected in Portugal and Brazil during 2015 and 2016 in different climatic seasons. We isolated Enterococcus spp., and then determined their clonal diversity and antimicrobial resistance profiles. The bacterial collection studied revealed high genomic diversity, ensuring its representativeness regarding the diversity of enterococci eliminated to the environment via otter spraints. Only one isolate, collected in Portugal, was susceptible to all the antimicrobial compounds tested, and the majority showed resistance to more than one antibiotic. We found high resistance levels to clindamycin in isolates from spraints collected in both countries, representing a particular concern for human health, as lincosamides are frequently used in cases of therapeutic failure. Antimicrobial resistance was higher in enterococci obtained from otter spraints collected in Brazil. However, significant correlations between antimicrobial resistance to individual compounds and country were only observed for Enrofloxacin and Vancomycin, which may be due to enrofloxacin use in animal production near the sample areas, particularly in poultry and cattle farms. Our results confirm the potential for these microorganisms to be used as indicators for monitoring antimicrobial resistance dissemination. These findings suggest that aquatic habitats occupied by otters may act as reservoirs of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, the presence of which could impact human health through exposure to contaminated waters during fishing or recreational activities. Appropriate management and monitoring plans must be established to protect the environment and public health against the adverse effects of antibiotics, with this being particularly important in countries where antibiotics are increasingly being administered in veterinary settings. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Plant diseases are a serious threat to the health and functionality of both natural and man-made ecosystems. Diverse methods and strategies are being employed to prevent, ameliorate or control plant diseases. Unsustainable practices such as use and misuse of synthetic fungicides have caused severe harm to human health, wildlife and the environment. However, sustainable and eco-friendly approaches such as use of beneficial fungi have gained significant attention worldwide due to their remarkable antagonistic properties against plant pathogens and copious successful applications. Trichoderma species, arbuscular mycorrhizas, ectomycorrhizas, endophytes, yeasts, and avirulent/hypovirulent strains of certain pathogens are among the main beneficial fungi with biocontrol capacity, some of which have been mass-produced and extensively applied. Understanding the mechanisms linked with the protective effects of beneficial fungi is essential for achieving favorable outcomes and development of novel strategies. The biocontrol mechanisms of beneficial fungi can be categorized into five classes: i) competing with pathogens for space and nutrients, ii) mycoparasitism, iii) antibiosis, iv) mycovirus-mediated cross protection (MMCP), and v) induced systemic resistance (ISR). Bearing in mind the technical advances in genetics and biotechnology over the past decades, it is now more feasible to manipulate the biocontrol-related features in fungi or host plants, which include: incorporation of fungal genes encoding antimicrobial compounds (such as chitinases) into the plant genome, overexpression or disruption of certain fungal genes to improve the biocontrol efficiency or broaden the pathogen target spectrum, development of avirulent/hypovirulent strains for fungal pathogens using hypovirulence-associated mycoviruses, and conferring ISR to plants via fungus-based elicitors. In this review, we explore the biocontrol mechanisms in beneficial fungi and conclude by highlighting the potential practical implications. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes among Bacteria are a serious threat to global health. Their occurrence in animals which are in contact with humans is also important. The Chinese cobra (Naja atra, Elapidae), though a highly venomous species, is appreciated as food and as a source of materials used in traditional Chinese medicine. We are here reporting the isolation of multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (Enterobacteriaceae) from the lung of Naja atra, obtained from a snake farm in a Beijing suburb. Our study analyzed, using gene sequencing, the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in three K. pneumoniae isolates from two snakes. In addition, bacterial clones were identified by biochemical tests and phylogenetic analysis. Tests of antimicrobial susceptibility showed that all K. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to a host of antibiotics (piperacillin, cefazolin, gentamicin, tetracycline, doxycyclin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin, nalidixic acid, chloramphenicol, nitrofurantoin, sulfamethoxazole, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim) but were susceptible to cefotaxime, cefixime, aztreonam, bramycin, amikacin, kanamycin, netilmicin, and streptomycin. Eighteen ARGs were detected in total DNA extracted from the isolates. Results showed three quinolone resistance genes (oqxA, oqxB, qnrB), the gyrA gene that confers resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, and the emerging aac(3)-II gene that confers resistance to aminoglycosides. K. pneumoniae is an important opportunistic human pathogen and the emergence of multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae in N. atra suggests the increasing risk of pathogen transmission between humans, livestock, and wildlife. Given the close association between foodborne pathogenic microorganisms and humans, it is key factor to identify these antibiotic resistance genes profile thereby minimize the risk of K. pneumoniae transmission. © 2018, Centro Regional de Invest.

abstract={Background: The global threat of antimicrobial resistance is undoubtedly on the increase and most researches in this area have concentrated on effects of drug exposure and usage on resistance. Little attention has been given to natural environments apparently devoid of direct anthropogenic impact as possible reservoirs of drug resistance traits. Objectives: This research was undertaken to determine possible similarities between drug resistance traits in species of Klebsiella and Citrobacter obtained from wild animals and 2 human groups. Methods: Human samples were collected from Humans free from antibiotics (HN) and Human on antibiotics (HA) while samples from wildlife (WL) were taken from rats (Rattus spp), grasscutters (Thryonomys swinderianus), squirrels (Xerus erythropus), antelopes (Tragelephus scriptus), rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), and farm lizards (Agama spp). Samples were analyzed using basic microbiological methods. The Disc diffusion technique was used for drug sensitivity testing while plasmid analysis was based on gel electrophoresis. Results: Members of the genus Klebsiella isolated from HA exhibited more resistance to ampicillin (AMP) and augmentin (AUG) than those isolated from HN. However, Klebsiella isolated from HN displayed higher resistance to ceftriaxone (CTN), clarithromycin (CMN), ofloxacin (OFL), and pefloxacin (PEF) than those from HA. WL isolates were mostly resistant to AMP, CMN, and AUG, and less resistant to PEF,CTN, andciprofloxacin. Correlation analysis of the antimicrobial resistance patternona 2 tailed test P_0.01and P_ 0.05, revealed a high correlation (ranging from 0.715 to 0.917) amongall the microorganisms from both sources. Gel electrophoretic analysis of plasmid DNA extracted from the isolates revealed the presence of a 23.1 kb plasmid DNA in 6 strains of Citrobacter and 3 strains of Klebsiella. Conclusions: These results indicate that wild life may be important reservoirs of drug resistance genes and pathogens that have public health relevance. © 2017, Jundishapur Journal of Microbiology.},

abstract={Antibiotic resistance (ABR) is regarded as one of today's major global health challenges. The development of ABR in nature is a complex phenomenon with many influencing factors, of which the farming industry is labelled a significant contributor. The transfer of ABR to humans, which usually occurs via the food chain, is of concern for human health. A food source that is increasing in popularity is game meat, which is farmed widely in South Africa. The natural environment, including wildlife, is not isolated from the rest of the farm, and thus could be a source of ABR or possibly a transfer vector. It is therefore important to assess the ABR situation in wildlife species and the factors that influence its emergence and transfer. Elements that play a part in the development of ABR in game species include certain harvesting and slaughtering and other farming practices and closer contact with humans and other farm animals. Additionally, natural transfer vectors include wind, water, manure, crops and animals. Worryingly, there is lack of knowledge of this situation owing to inadequate monitoring, documentation and control of antibiotics in the farming industry. The objective of this review was to gain better understanding of this situation, which would aid in the development of surveillance systems and methods to prevent or hinder the development of ABR in wildlife species. © 2012 South African Society for Animal Science.},

abstract={Background. The "One Health" concept recognizes that human health and animal health are interdependent and bound to the health of the ecosystem in which they (co)exist. This interconnection favors the transmission of bacteria and other infectious agents as well as the flow of genetic elements containing antibiotic resistance genes. This problem is worsened when pathogenic bacteria have the ability to establish as biofilms. Therefore, it is important to understand the characteristics and behaviour of microorganisms in both planktonic and biofilms states from the most diverse environmental niches to mitigate the emergence and dissemination of resistance. Methods. The purpose of this work was to assess the antibiotic susceptibility of four bacteria (Acinetobacter spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Shewanella putrefaciens) isolated from wild animals and their ability to form biofilms. The effect of two antibiotics, imipenem (IPM) and ciprofloxacin (CIP), on biofilm removal was also assessed. Screening of resistance genetic determinants was performed by PCR. Biofilm tests were performed by a modified microtiter plate method. Bacterial surface hydrophobicity was determined by sessile drop contact angles. Results. The susceptibility profile classified the bacteria as multidrug-resistant. Three genes coding for β-lactamases were detected in K. pneumoniae (TEM, SHV, OXAaer) and one in P. fluorescens (OXA-aer). K. pneumoniae was the microorganism that carried more β-lactamase genes and it was the most proficient biofilm producer, while P. fluorescens demonstrated the highest adhesion ability. Antibiotics at their MIC, 5 × MIC and 10 × MIC were ineffective in total biofilm removal. The highest biomass reductions were found with IPM (54% at 10 × MIC) against K. pneumoniae biofilms and with CIP (40% at 10 × MIC) against P. fluorescens biofilms. Discussion. The results highlight wildlife as important host reservoirs and vectors for the spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria and genetic determinants of resistance. The ability of these bacteria to form biofilms should increase their persistence. © 2018 Dias et al.},

abstract={Background: The increasing burden of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria causes morbidity and mortality, especially among patients affected by healthcare-associated infections. Limited treatment options challenge clinicians in both human and veterinary medicine. Objectives: To summarize current evidence for the occurrence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and their zoonotic transmission between humans and animals with a focus on data from Germany. Materials and methods: Review of scientific literature and publications from German national public health institutions. Results and Conclusions: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and extended-spectrum β‑lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae are frequently transmitted between animals and humans. The rates of asymptomatic carriage are increased among persons with livestock contact compared with the general population. The occurrence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae has been documented on German pig and chicken farms, but investigations into their prevalence and zoonotic importance are pending. Colistin is frequently used in veterinary medicine to treat diarrhoea and causes selection pressure for colistin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria harbouring mcr genes. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), oxazolidinone-resistant Gram-positive bacteria and multiresistant staphylococci are further antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms, which might have a zoonotic potential. Besides human healthcare and livestock, the problem of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria also affects companion animals (e. g. dogs, cats and horses), wildlife and the environment, which underlines the need to prevent antimicrobial resistance in a One Health approach. © 2018, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.},

abstract={Wild boars (Sus scrofa) are increasing in several European countries, including Italy. In areas with intensive animal farming, like the Italian Emilia-Romagna region, they are likely to be exposed to antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria of livestock origin. In 2017-2018, 108 mesenteric lymph nodes samples were collected from 108 wild boars hunted in Parma province, Emilia-Romagna region, to be tested for ESBL-and carbapenemase-producing Escherichia coli. One isolate (WB-21L) out of 108 (0.9%) was phenotypically confirmed as ESBL-producing E. coli. The strain WB-21L was tested by PCR for the genes bla SHV, bla CTX-M, bla TEM , bla AmpC, bla KPC, bla NDM, bla VIM, bla IMP, bla OXA-48, bla SPM, bla BIC, bla SIM, bla DIM, bla GIM, bla AIM , resulting positive for TEM β-lactamase. Resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, streptomycin, sulfasomidine, tetracycline and trimethoprim confirmed the multi-resistance nature of the strain WB-21L. Nine E.coli isolates showed resistance to meropenem by the Kirby Bauer test but none of them showed Meropenem MIC values indicative of resistance. In conclusion, the present study shows the presence of ESBL E. coli in wild boars and the possible risk of transfer to game meat handlers and consumers. Future studies are needed to better evaluate the sources of AMR bacteria in wildlife. © S. Bonardi et al., 2018.},

abstract={Background: In sub-Saharan Africa, efforts to control antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are aggravated by unregulated drug sales and use, and high connectivity between human, livestock, and wildlife populations. Our previous research indicates that Maasai agropastoralists-who have high exposure to livestock and livestock products and self-administer veterinary antibiotics-harbor antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli). Here, we report the results of a public health intervention project among Maasai aimed at reducing selection and transmission of E. coli bacteria. Methods: Research was conducted in two Maasai communities in Northern Tanzania. Participants were provided with health knowledge and technological innovations to facilitate: 1) the prudent use of veterinary antibiotics (tape measures and dosage charts to calculate livestock weight for more accurate dosage), and, 2) the pasteurization of milk (thermometers), the latter of which was motivated by findings of high levels of resistant E. coli in Maasai milk. To determine knowledge retention and intervention adoption, we conducted a two-month follow-up evaluation in the largest of the two communities. Results: Retention of antimicrobial knowledge was positively associated with retention of bacterial knowledge and, among men, retention of bacterial knowledge was associated with greater wealth. Bacterial and AMR knowledge were not, however, associated with self-reported use of the innovations. Among women, self-reported use of the thermometers was associated with having more children and greater retention of knowledge about the health benefits of the innovations. Whereas 70% of women used their innovations correctly, men performed only 18% of the weight-estimation steps correctly. Men's correct use was associated with schooling, such that high illiteracy rates remain an important obstacle to the dissemination and diffusion of weight-estimation materials. Conclusion: Our results indicate that dietary preferences for unboiled milk, concerns over child health, and a desire to improve the health of livestock are important cultural values that need to be incorporated in future AMR-prevention interventions that target Maasai populations. More generally, these findings inform future community-health interventions to limit AMR. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Anthropogenic activity in Antarctica constitutes a continuous risk for the introduction of infectious diseases into indigenous wildlife populations. Penguin colonies living close to human settlements or inhabiting in areas considered for tourism could be facing a greater threat of infection. Fecal samples from Pygoscelis penguins (Pygoscelis spp.) were collected from different sites within Antarctic Peninsula and South Shetlands Islands in order to assess the presence of Salmonella enterica. Bacterial identification and characterization was performed applying biochemical and molecular techniques. Isolates were tested for antimicrobial resistance by the disk diffusion method, and PCR analyses were used for detection of resistance and virulence-associated genes. Four samples (1.74%) from P. papua were found to be positive to S. enterica serovar Enteritidis strains. All of them showed phenotypic antimicrobial resistance to at least three antimicrobials, and shared a similar gene profile through PCR. Results in this study urgently call for improvements in sanitary standards for waste disposal and sewage treatment in Antarctica.

abstract={ESBL-producing bacteria are present in wildlife and the environment might serve as a resistance reservoir. Wild gulls have been described as frequent carriers of ESBL-producing E. coli strains with genotypic characteristics similar to strains found in humans. Therefore, potential dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes and bacteria between the human population and wildlife need to be further investigated. Occurrence and characterization of ESBL-producing E. coli in Swedish wild gulls were assessed and compared to isolates from humans, livestock and surface water collected in the same country and similar time-period. Occurrence of ESBL-producing E. coli in Swedish gulls is about three times higher in gulls compared to Swedish community carriers (17% versus 5%) and the genetic characteristics of the ESBL-producing E. coli population in Swedish wild gulls and Swedish human are similar. ESBL-plasmids IncF- and IncI1-type carrying ESBL-genes blaCTX-M-15 or blaCTX-M-14 were most common in isolates from both gulls and humans, but there was limited evidence of clonal transmission. Isolates from Swedish surface water harbored similar genetic characteristics, which highlights surface waters as potential dissemination routes between wildlife and the human population. Even in a low-prevalence country such as Sweden, the occurrence of ESBL producing E. coli in wild gulls and the human population appears to be connected and the occurrence of ESBL-producing E. coli in Swedish gulls is likely a case of environmental pollution. © 2017 Atterby et al.

abstract={Amphibians are a highly threatened vertebrate group, and populations of these animals have declined drastically. An important global threat to amphibians is the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which causes the disease chytridiomycosis. However, not all species develop chytridiomycosis when exposed to Bd. We compared susceptibility to disease in two species of marsupial frogs and found that Gastrotheca nebulanastes is susceptible, whereas its congeneric G. excubitor is resistant. Since Bd is a skin pathogen, it is possible that cutaneous defenses like symbiotic bacteria and antimicrobial peptides protect the resistant species. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the anti-Bd abilities of cutaneous defenses between the two Gastrotheca species. Cultivable bacteria and peptides were isolated from the skin and tested for their abilities to inhibit Bd with in vitro co-culture assays. Twenty-six bacteria were identified by sequencing their 16S rRNA gene and 19 peptides were profiled by MALDI TOF mass spectrometry. We found that bacteria, but not peptides, differed between the two species in their ability to inhibit Bd growth. The resistant G. excubitor harbored more isolates of cultivable anti-Bd bacteria both in number and proportion (6/15 vs. 1/11). Also, the one anti-Bd isolate from G. nebulanastes demonstrated the weakest ability to inhibit Bd growth. Our results highlight the importance of anti-Bd skin bacteria in providing frog species with protection from Bd and can inform mitigation strategies for other wildlife diseases. © 2017 The Zoological Society of London},

abstract={The aim of this study was to generate a reference set of Salmonella enterica genomes isolated from wildlife from the United States and to determine the antimicrobial resistance and virulence gene profile of the isolates from the genome sequence data. We sequenced the whole genomes of 103 Salmonella isolates sampled between 1988 and 2003 from wildlife and exotic pet cases that were submitted to the Oklahoma Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Stillwater, Oklahoma. Among 103 isolates, 50.48% were from wild birds, 0.9% was from fish, 24.27% each were from reptiles and mammals. 50.48% isolates showed resistance to at least one antibiotic. Resistance against the aminoglycoside streptomycin was most common while 9 isolates were found to be multi-drug resistant having resistance against more than three antibiotics. Determination of virulence gene profile revealed that the genes belonging to csg operons, the fim genes that encode for type 1 fimbriae and the genes belonging to type III secretion system were predominant among the isolates. The universal presence of fimbrial genes and the genes encoded by pathogenicity islands 1-2 among the isolates we report here indicates that these isolates could potentially cause disease in humans. Therefore, the genomes we report here could be a valuable reference point for future traceback investigations when wildlife is considered to be the potential source of human Salmonellosis. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={The spread of antimicrobial resistant E. coli within the environment is a global concern. Wildlife such as feral pigs have been identified as a possible reservoir of antimicrobial resistant bacteria. A cross-sectional survey of free-ranging, feral pigs within the Kimberley region of northwestern Australia was conducted to estimate the prevalence of antimicrobial and disinfectant resistant E. coli in this population. Of the 493 faecal samples collected, 115 E. coli isolates were randomly selected and their identity confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Isolates were screened for susceptibility to 14 veterinary antimicrobials (including antimicrobials not permitted for use in Australia) using MIC broth microdilution using Sensititre™ (BOPO6F) and breakpoints according to CLSI and EUCAST guidelines. Isolates also underwent disinfectant susceptibility testing to six disinfectants at their recommended concentration for use as well as at a twofold dilution, based on methods adapted from the CLSI agar plate dilution method. A moderate prevalence of resistance was observed to sulfadimethoxine (50.4%; 58/115) and florfenicol (27.0%; 31/115). A low prevalence of resistance was estimated to chlortetracycline (5.2%; 6/115) and multi-drug resistance was only identified in 1.7% (2/115) of E.coli isolates tested. Isolates were susceptible to five of the six disinfectants screened. Feral pigs could potentially act as a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance in the environment with possible implications for domestic livestock. The role that feral pigs might play in transmission of antimicrobial resistance requires further investigation, and the occurrence of resistance in such isolated populations needs to be considered when attempting to infer source attribution of antimicrobial resistance in livestock and human populations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Wetlands are known for providing important ecosystem services, such as reduction of eutrophication. However, less research has focused on public health service of wetlands: their ability to protect microbial quality of water for downstream while they attract wildlife populations. For urban surface water, transmission of antibiotic resistance is also an important concern. Under anticipated climate change scenarios, more extreme precipitation patterns are emerging. Thus, runoff and flooding from increased precipitation will impair surface water quality more significantly. The objectives of this study were to 1) evaluate the dynamics of bacteria of public health concern in urban wetlands, including: Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), Arcobacter, and two antibiotic resistance genes (sulfonamide, sul1 and tetracycline, tetQ); and 2) identify the major fecal contamination sources using microbial source tracking (MST). Water samples were collected across the urban wetlands in central Ohio from June 2013 to June 2014 and tested with a culture-based (E. coli) and quantitative PCR (the rest) methods. Since Canada geese were the most observed wildlife at the study sites and they are known to carry an array of infectious disease agents, their fecal samples were also collected. From the water samples, E. coli (fecal indicator) had the highest occurrence in 99.2% of the total samples, followed by sul1 (98.3%), Arcobacter (94.9%), STEC (74.6%), tetQ (58.5%), and Campylobacter (1.7%). Overall reduction in E. coli was 22.3% across the wetlands, but variation was observed depending on the season. Microbial source tracking suggested a high prevalence of avian- (44.9%) and ruminant- (38.1%) originated fecal contaminations (e.g., Canada geese and deer). From the geese fecal samples, STEC (93.2%) and Arcobacter (4.5%) were detected, which could potentially compromise wetlands’ functions in reductions in bacteria of public health concern and antibiotic resistance. The results suggest that careful wildlife management together with long-term monitoring of microorganisms of concern are needed for making urban wetlands as a sustainable frontline safeguard of pathogen and antibiotic resistance spread in surface water. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The rapid spreading of polymyxin E (colistin) resistance among bacterial strains through the horizontally transmissible mcr-1 and mcr-2 plasmids has become a serious concern. The emergence of these genes in Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), a group of human pathogenic bacteria was even more worrisome, urging us to investigate the prevalence of mcr genes among STEC isolates. A total of 1000 STEC isolates, recovered from livestock, wildlife, produce and other environmental sources in a major production region for leafy vegetables in California during 2006–2014, were screened by PCR for the presence of plasmid-borne mcr-1 and mcr-2. All isolates tested yielded negative results, indicating if any, the occurrence rate of mcr-1/mcr-2 among STEC was very low in this agricultural region.

abstract={Dissemination of antibiotic resistance is a major concern, especially in aquatic environments, where pollution contributes for resistant bacteria selection. These strains may have serious health implications, especially for endangered species, including the sea turtles’ hawksbill Eretmochelys imbricata and green turtles Chelonia mydas. We aimed to evaluate the presence of antibiotic resistant pseudomonads in wild sea turtles from Príncipe Island, São Tomé and Príncipe, Guinea Gulf. Isolates were obtained from oral and cloacal swabs of free-living turtles by conventional techniques. Pseudomonads screening was performed by multiplex-PCR (oprI/oprL) and biochemical identification and antibiotic resistance profiling were achieved using Vitek2. All pseudomonad isolates were genotyped by Rep-PCR. Thirteen isolates were oprI-positive and classified as pseudomonads, eight from the genus Pseudomonas with the species P. aeruginosa, P. stutzeri, and P. mendocina, and five co-isolated Alcaligenes faecalis. The P. aeruginosa isolate was also oprL-positive. Regarding isolates susceptibility profile, 38.5% were susceptible to all antibiotics tested, and multidrug resistant (MDR) strains were not identified. DNA fingerprinting did not show any specific clonal-cluster similarity. Data on the worldwide incidence of antibiotic resistance among wildlife is still very scarce, especially concerning remote tropical areas. Since Pseudomonas genus has emerged as a group of increasingly reported opportunistic microorganisms in human and veterinary medicine with high resistance levels, it could be used as a tool for environmental resistance surveillance, particularly considering their ubiquity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Globally, water resources are under constant threat of being polluted by a diverse range of man-made chemicals, and South Africa is no exception. These contaminants can have detrimental effects on both human and wildlife health. It is increasingly evident that several chemicals may modulate endocrine system pathways in vertebrate species, and these are collectively referred to as endocrine disrupting contaminants (EDCs). Although the endocrine-disrupting effect of water pollutants has been mainly linked to agricultural pesticides and industrial effluents, other pollutants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are largely unnoticed, but also pose a potentially significant threat. Here we present for the first time in a South African context, a summarised list of PPCPs and other EDCs detected to date within South African water systems, as well as their possible endocrine-disrupting effect in-vitro and in-vivo. This review addresses other factors which should be investigated in future studies, including endocrine disruption, PPCP metabolites, environmental toxicology, and antibiotic resistance. The challenges of removing EDCs and other pollutants at South African wastewater treatment works (WWTWs) are also highlighted. The need for focused research involving both in-vitro and in-vivo studies to detect PPCPs in water systems, and to delineate adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) of priority PPCPs to aid in environmental impact assessment (EIA), are discussed. © 2017, South African Water Research Commission.

abstract={Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an important issue for both wildlife conservation and public health. The purpose of this study was to screen for AMR in fecal bacteria isolated from northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), a species that is an ecologically and economically important natural resource in the southern United States. The antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of 45 Escherichia coli isolates, 20 Enterococcus faecalis isolates, and 10 Enterococcus faecium isolates were determined using the Sensititer TM microbroth dilution minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) plate, AVIAN1F. Overall, E. coli isolates had high MIC values for the following classes of antimicrobials: Aminocoumarins, beta-lactams, lincosamides, macrolides, florfenicol, and sulfonamides. Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium isolates had high MICs for aminocyclitols, aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, lincosamides, and sulfonamides. Enterococcus faecalis isolates also showed high MICs for aminocoumarins, while E. faecium isolates had high MICs for trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline. Based on available veterinary interpretive criteria, 15% and 33% of E. coli isolates were resistant to sulphathiazole and sulphadimethoxine, respectively. Intermediate susceptibility to florfenicol was seen with 17.8% of E. coli isolates. Twenty percent of E. faecalis and 80% of E. faecium isolates were resistant to high-concentration streptomycin. One third of E. faecalis and 70% of E. faecium isolates were intermediately susceptible to erythromycin. Ten percent of E. faecium isolates were resistant to tetracycline and oxytetracycline. A comparison of available MIC suggests that AMR in wild bobwhite is less severe than in domestic poultry. Further investigation is needed to determine the source of AMR in wild bobwhite.},

abstract={Attachment of pathogenic bacteria to food contact surfaces and the subsequent biofilm formation represent a serious threat for the food industry, since these bacteria are more resistant to antimicrobials or possess more virulence factors. The main aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between antibiotic resistance against 13 antibiotics, distribution of 10 virulence factors and biofilm formation in 105 Escherichia coli strains according to their origin. The high prevalence of antibiotic resistance that we have found in wildlife isolates could be acquired by horizontal transfer of resistance genes from human or domestic or farm animals. Consequently, these commensal bacteria might serve as indicator of antimicrobial usage for human and veterinary purposes in the Czech Republic. Further, 46 out of 66 resistant isolates (70%) were able to form biofilm and we found out statistically significant correlation between prevalence of antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation ability. The highest prevalence of antibiotic resistance was observed in weak biofilm producers. Biofilm formation was not statistically associated with any virulence determinant. However, we confirmed the correlation between prevalence of virulence factors and host origin. Chicken isolates possessed more virulence factors (66%), than isolates from wildlife (37%). We can conclude that the potential spread of antibiotic resistance pattern via the food chain is of high concern for public health. Even more, alarming is that E. coli isolates remain pathogenic potential with ability to form biofilm and these bacteria may persist during food processing and consequently lead to greater risks of food contamination. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The closer contact with wildlife due to the growing human population and the destruction of natural habitats emphasizes the need of gaining insight into the role of animals as source of antimicrobial resistance. Here, we aim at characterizing the antimicrobial resistance genes and phylogenetic distribution of commensal Escherichia coli from 62 wild mammals. Isolates exhibiting resistance to ≥1 antibiotic were detected in 25.8% of the animals and 6.4% carried an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)/AmpC-producing E. coli. Genetic mechanisms involved in third-generation cephalosporin resistance were as follows: (i) hyperproduction of chromosomal AmpC (hedgehog), (ii) production of acquired CMY-2 β-lactamase (hedgehog), (iii) production of SHV-12 and CTX-M-14 ESBLs (n = 2, mink and roe-deer). ESBL genes were transferable by conjugation, and blaCMY-2 was mobilized by a 95kb IncI1 plasmid. The distribution of the phylogenetic groups in the E. coli collection studied was B1 (44.6%), B2 (24.6%), E (15.4%), A (4.6%) and F (3.1%). Five isolates (7.7%) were cryptic Escherichia clades (clade IV, 4 mice; clade V, 1 mink). ESBL/AmpC-E. coli isolates showed different sequence types (STs): ST1128/B1, ST4564/B1 (new), ST4996/B1 (new) and a non-registered ST. This study contributes to better understand the E. coli population and antimicrobial resistance flow in wildlife and reports new AmpC-E. coli STs and a first described ESBL-producing Escherichia clade V isolate. © FEMS 2017.

abstract={The antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of E. coli, Salmonella spp. and thermophilic Campylobacter spp. isolated from wild birds in the Austrian–Czech border region, predominantly within the vicinity of Vienna and Brno, was determined. Bacteria were isolated from cloacal swabs taken from 53 avian species belonging to 14 orders, the majority being feral pigeons and various songbirds. Consequently, 1978 E. coli, 24 Salmonella and 99 Campylobacter isolates were tested by microdilution method against a panel of 14 (E. coli and Salmonella spp.) or ten antimicrobial substances (Campylobacter spp.). The AMR varied greatly between Austrian and Czech isolates, between different bird and bacterial species and between the different antimicrobials without consistent trends being recognizable. In 331 from 664 birds, differences in the AMR profile between the two or three E. coli isolates from the same bird were observed. Concerning E. coli, the least effective antimicrobial was cephalotin (90.8% of isolates resistant); for Campylobacter it was trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (71.4% of isolates resistant). None of the antimicrobials was effective against all E. coli or Campylobacter isolates. In contrast, more than half of the antimicrobials were effective against all Salmonella isolates, but 71.4% of the Czech Salmonella isolates and all of the Austrian Salmonella isolates were multi-resistant (resistant to three or more antimicrobial substances); streptomycin being the least effective antimicrobial substance (90.5% of isolates resistant). It is concluded that AMR in zoonotic bacteria from wild birds in the investigated densely populated areas is widespread and diverse, arguing for certain care at the wildlife–human interface, but AMR to clinically important and critical antimicrobials is relatively low. © 2017, The Author(s).},

Serotyping was performed employing all available O (O1–O185) and H (H1-H56) antisera. Genetic diversity was analyzed by XbaI-PFGE and phylotyping. Thirteen STEC (4.3%) and 10 EPEC (3.3%) were identified among 12 deer, 3 mouflon, 6 wild boars and 2 birds. Nine STEC showed seropathotypes B (O145:[H28]) and C (O22:H8, O128:[H2]) associated with HUS, and D (O110:H28, O146:H21, O146:[H28], ONT:H8) associated with human diarrhea. Although most isolates harbored stx 2b and stx 1c variants, stx 2a and stx 1a (related with severe disease) were also detected. Additionally, the eae gene was present in one stx 2a –positive O145:[H28] STEC from a deer and 11 STEC harbored subAB genes (mainly the subAB 2 variant). EPEC isolates showed 7 different intimin variants (β1, β2, γ1, ε1, ζ1, ι1-A, κ). Interestingly, the O49:[H10] eae-κ EPEC isolated from a wild boar was bfpA-positive showing a combination of serotype/virulence profile previously detected among human clinical tEPEC. Based on present results, wild ruminants, wild boars and to a lesser extent birds would be carriers of potentially pathogenic STEC and EPEC strains. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Free-living raptors (birds of prey) can act as reservoirs of potentially zoonotic agents, but they also can be affected by microorganisms as target hosts. In this retrospective study, microbiological results (n = 663) and antibiotic sensitivity profiles (n = 108) of bacterial isolates were analysed from diseased free-living raptors. Sixty-nine percent of cases (n = 457) yielded bacteria: 58% were in pure culture and 42% were of different species. Remarkably, samples from necropsies (47%) had higher percentage of pure isolations than those obtained from clinical (31%) samples (P < 0.001). Among bacterial isolates, Escherichia coli was the most common agent (35%), principally recovered from necropsied birds with clinical signs of septicaemia or respiratory disorders. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%) was isolated from birds with systemic infection and from oral lesions, especially in nocturnal raptors (P < 0.001). Staphylococcus spp. (5%), mainly Staphylococcus aureus, was found to be the most prevalent cause of pododermatitis (35%) and Staphylococcus hyicus was isolated from conjunctivitis (18.2%). Interestingly, 8% of samples with lesions compatible with avian tuberculosis were positive to the Mycobacterium avium complex. The most frequent fungi associated with pneumonic lesions and ingluvitis were Aspergillus spp. and Candida spp., respectively. More than 50% of the 108 isolates (34 different bacterial spp.) demonstrated resistance to clindamycin, ampicillin, tetracycline, cefuroxime, enrofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole. Among the E. coli strains, 71% (27/38) presented a multidrug-resistance pattern to >3 antimicrobials. Detection in wildlife of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens that might be significant at the animal–human–ecosystem interface is of great relevance under the ‘One Health’ approach. © 2017 Houghton Trust Ltd.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to determine the resistance phenotypes of selected enteric bacteria isolated from non-human primates at a wildlife-human interface. Bacterial isolates from faecal samples of non-human primates at two wildlife rehabilitation centres in South Africa were screened for the presence of Escherichia coli. The biochemical characterisation of E. coli and E. coli-like bacteria revealed both adonitol positive and sorbitol negative strains – a unique characteristic of Escherichia fergusonii and Escherichia coli K99. Further tests were carried out to identify the isolates, namely growth on Simmons citrate agar supplemented with 2% adonitol and biochemical tests based on their ability to ferment cellobiose and D-arabitol. Antimicrobial sensitivity was determined with microbroth dilution tests employing microtitre plates with 21 different antimicrobial drugs. Molecular characterisation was done with a duplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that targeted the yliE and EFER_1569 genes. E. fergusonii strains were confirmed by the presence of a 233 bp segment of the yliE gene and a 432 bp segment of the EFER_1569 gene. Twenty-three E. coli-like bacteria were confirmed as E. fergusonii based on the confirmatory tests and they were in 100% agreement. Approximately 87% of them were resistant to polymyxins B and E (colistin) as well as the carbapenem group with occasional resistance to amikacin. This is the first reported isolation and identification of E. fergusonii strains in non-human primates. The findings point to E. fergusonii as a possible emerging pathogen of zoonotic importance. © 2017},

abstract={The Vibrionaceae are Gram-negative bacteria present in marine and estuarine environments worldwide, including several species known as important pathogens to humans and aquatic organisms. The aim of this research was to investigate the occurrence and virulence properties of Vibrio and Salinivibrio isolated from lagoons at Cuare Wildlife Refuge and Margarita Island in the southern Caribbean Sea. Water, plankton and oyster samples were collected during October 2011 and March 2012 and examined by specific PCR and culture methods. Vibrio genus DNA was detected in 95% of samples, while the intergenic spacer region (ISR) of Vibrio cholerae and the genes that code for the thermolabile direct haemolysin (tl) of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and the haemolysin/cytolysin (vvhA) of Vibrio vulnificus were absent or amplified in low proportions (23, 5, and 0%, respectively). Nine isolates from water and plankton were confirmed as Vibrio or Salinivibrio by phenotypic tests, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. All the isolates presented similar patterns of virulence factors, in which the genes ctxA (encoding for cholera toxin), tl and vvhA were lacking, whereas seven isolates displayed antibiotic resistance against ampicillin and cephalosporins. The 16S rRNA phylogenetic analysis showed the clustering of Vibrio isolates in three main clades: the plankton isolate from Cuare Wildlife Refuge formed a group with V. cholerae and Vibrio mimicus while the Margarita isolates clustered with sequences from the harveyi clade and Salinivibrio. This is the first time that Salinivibrio species are reported in tropical lagoons of the Caribbean Sea with antibiotic resistance. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={The objectives of this study were to (i) compare the carriage of Campylobacter and antimicrobial-resistant Campylobacter among livestock and mammalian wildlife on Ontario farms, and (ii) investigate the potential sharing of Campylobacter subtypes between livestock and wildlife. Using data collected from a cross-sectional study of 25 farms in 2010, we assessed associations, using mixed logistic regression models, between Campylobacter and antimicrobial-resistant Campylobacter carriage and the following explanatory variables: animal species (beef, dairy, swine, raccoon, other), farm type (swine, beef, dairy), type of sample (livestock or wildlife) and Campylobacter species (jejuni, coli, other). Models included a random effect to account for clustering by farm where samples were collected. Samples were subtyped using a Campylobacter-specific 40 gene comparative fingerprinting assay. A total of 92 livestock and 107 wildlife faecal samples were collected, and 72% and 27% tested positive for Campylobacter, respectively. Pooled faecal samples from livestock were significantly more likely to test positive for Campylobacter than wildlife samples. Relative to dairy cattle, pig samples were at significantly increased odds of testing positive for Campylobacter. The odds of isolating Campylobacter jejuni from beef cattle samples were significantly greater compared to dairy cattle and raccoon samples. Fifty unique subtypes of Campylobacter were identified, and only one subtype was found in both wildlife and livestock samples. Livestock Campylobacter isolates were significantly more likely to exhibit antimicrobial resistance (AMR) compared to wildlife Campylobacter isolates. Campylobacter jejuni was more likely to exhibit AMR when compared to C. coli. However, C. jejuni isolates were only resistant to tetracycline, and C. coli isolates exhibited multidrug resistance patterns. Based on differences in prevalence of Campylobacter spp. and resistant Campylobacter between livestock and wildlife samples, and the lack of similarity in molecular subtypes and AMR patterns, we concluded that the sharing of Campylobacter species between livestock and mammalian wildlife was uncommon. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Antimicrobial resistance is an urgent global health challenge in human and veterinary medicine. Wild animals are not directly exposed to clinically relevant antibiotics; however, antibacterial resistance in wild animals has been increasingly reported worldwide in parallel to the situation in human and veterinary medicine. This underlies the complexity of bacterial resistance in wild animals and the possible interspecies transmission between humans, domestic animals, the environment, and wildlife. This review summarizes the current data on expanded-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL), AmpC β-lactamase, carbapenemase, and colistin resistance genes in Enterobacteriaceae isolates of wildlife origin. The aim of this review is to better understand the important role of wild animals as reservoirs and vectors in the global dissemination of crucial clinical antibacterial resistance. In this regard, continued surveillance is urgently needed worldwide.},

abstract={The presence of antibiotics and their metabolites in natural waters has raised some concern among scientists around the world because it can lead to bacterial resistance and other unknown consequences to mankind and wildlife. Persulfate (PS)-driven oxidation is a new technology that has been used successfully to remediate contaminated sites, but its use to treat wastewater, especially sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent, is still scarce. This paper describes the effect of several persulfate activation methods for degrading sulfathiazole (STZ) in Milli-Q water and in STP effluent. Some parameters, such as pH, persulfate concentration, presence of Mn2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+, as well as copper and iron organic complexes, were studied in STZ degradation. Raising the pH from 5 to 9, as well as the persulfate concentration, resulted in increased STZ degradation. Among the transition metals evaluated, only Fe2+ and Cu2+ were able to activate persulfate molecules. Copper was a better activator than iron since its effect lasts longer. Citrate was the best ligand evaluated increasing Fe(II) activation capacity at pH 7. Hydroxylamine addition to Fe(II) on persulfate system extended the Fe(II) effect. The presence of bicarbonate or humic acid did not affect PS-driven degradation of STZ. Finally, the degradation of STZ in STP effluent promoted by PS-driven oxidation (25 °C) was as fast as in Milli-Q water, proving to be successful. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Acquired carbapenemases currently pose one of the most worrying public health threats related to antimicrobial resistance. A NDM-1-producing Salmonella Corvallis was reported in 2013 in a wild raptor. Further research was needed to understand the role of wild birds in the transmission of bacteria resistant to carbapenems. Our aim was to investigate the presence of carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli in gulls from southern France. In 2012, we collected 158 cloacal swabs samples from two gull species: yellow-legged gulls (Larus michahellis) that live in close contact with humans and slender-billed gulls (Chroicocephalus genei) that feed at sea. We molecularly compared the carbapenem-resistant bacteria we isolated through culture on selective media with the carbapenem-susceptible strains sampled from both gull species and from stool samples of humans hospitalized in the study area. The genes coding for carbapenemases were tested by multiplex PCR. We isolated 22 carbapenem-resistant E. coli strains from yellow-legged gulls while none were isolated from slender-billed gulls. All carbapenem-resistant isolates were positive for blaVIM -1 gene. VIM-1-producing E. coli were closely related to carbapenem-susceptible strains isolated from the two gull species but also to human strains. Our results are alarming enough to make it urgently necessary to determine the contamination source of the bacteria we identified. More generally, our work highlights the need to develop more bridges between studies focusing on wildlife and humans in order to improve our knowledge of resistant bacteria transmission routes. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={Wildlife is a natural reservoir of Salmonella and Campylobacter, the most important human foodborne pathogens worldwide. Free-living birds have the potential to transport, over large distances, such zoonotic bacteria that may harbor antimicrobial resistance traits. On the northeastern Iberian coast, we assessed the role of Yellow-legged Gulls (Larus michahellis) as reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella and thermophilic Campylobacter isolates recovered from gulls at three colonies, with varying degrees of dependence on refuse dumps as food sources. Of the 39 Salmonella isolates we tested, 17 were multiresistant (resistance to three antimicrobial families), with eight being Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Other clinically relevant Salmonella serovars showing multiresistance included Hadar, Bredeney, and Virchow. Relevant Campylobacter antimicrobial resistances were detected among three Campylobacter jejuni isolates, of which all three showed resistance to nalidixic acid, two were resistant to ciprofloxacin, one was resistant to enrofloxacin, and one was resistant to tetracycline. Our results highlight the importance of free-living gulls with opportunistic feeding habits in the dissemination of enteric pathogens resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents of public health concern. © Wildlife Disease Association 2017.},

abstract={Infectious diseases affect people, domestic animals and wildlife alike, with many pathogens being able to infect multiple species. Fifty years ago, following the wide-scale manufacture and use of antibiotics and vaccines, it seemed that the battle against infections was being won for the human population. Since then, however, and in addition to increasing antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens, there has been an increase in the emergence of, mostly viral, zoonotic diseases from wildlife, sometimes causing fatal outbreaks of epidemic proportions. Concurrently, infectious disease has been identified as an increasing threat to wildlife conservation. A synthesis published in 2000 showed common anthropogenic drivers of disease threats to biodiversity and human health, including encroachment and destruction of wildlife habitat and the human-assisted spread of pathogens. Almost two decades later, the situation has not changed and, despite improved knowledge of the underlying causes, little has been done at the policy level to address these threats. For the sake of public health and wellbeing, human-kind needs to work better to conserve nature and preserve the ecosystem services, including disease regulation, that biodiversity provides while also understanding and mitigating activities which lead to disease emergence.We consider that holistic, One Health approaches to the management and mitigation of the risks of emerging infectious diseases have the greatest chance of success. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Since ancient times, wild animals have been used as a food source. While meat from these animals has always contributed to human nutrition, nowadays it is either as a cheap or affordable source of protein and fat in the form of bushmeat or it be processed into luxury foods in developed regions. Humans can be exposed to health hazards during the handling of wild animals and during the processing and consumption of the meat of these animals. Processing will also vary in qualitative as well as in quantitative terms from region to region. Codes of good practice and surveillance systems should help to control these hazards, and the farming of “wild” animals will introduce a level of biosecurity comparable to that of extensively 188kept (ranched) domestic animals. The wildlife-domestic animal interface has been studied extensively in terms of transmission of infectious agents or of antibiotic resistance. Likewise, wild animals can be used as sentinels or bioindicators for biotic and abiotic hazards in the ecosphere. The role of wildlife as a reservoir for emerging infectious diseases, and their impact on human health as well as on trade and food security requires a close observation of wildlife trade and translocation not only in a regional, but also in a global context. © 2018 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Objectives: ESBL genes in Escherichia coli are mainly plasmid encoded, although recent studies have also shown chromosomal integration, e.g. in clinical E. coli isolates of ST38. As ESBL-producing E. coli are also found in nonclinical settings, we were interested in determining whether chromosomally integrated ESBL genes occur in ST38 isolates from non-clinical habitats, e.g. wildlife. Methods: Four ESBL-producing E. coli isolates of ST38 originating from Mongolian birds of prey sampled in 2015 were subjected to a detailed analysis in terms of phenotypic resistance, plasmid profiling and WGS, followed by the determination of genotypic resistance factors including the chromosomal integration of ESBL and carbapenemase genes. Results: Results based on phenotypic and genotypic plasmid profiling, contiguous sequence (contig) sizes and PCR analysis of flanking insertion site regions showed that three of four ST38 isolates harboured chromosomally encoded blaCTX-M genes of three different types (blaCTX-M-14, blaCTX-M-15 and blaCTX-M-24) that were inserted into three different chromosomal locations. A comparison of WGS data with ST38 isolates from a clinical outbreak in the UK indicated only low numbers of core-genome SNPs detected among one Mongolian wild bird isolate and eight clinical isolates from the UK. Conclusions: The chromosomal integration of blaCTX-M genes in E. coli isolates of ST38 appears to be common and is likely independent of antimicrobial selective pressure in clinical environments. Our data corroborate the zoonotic potential of environmental isolates of ESBL-producing E. coli, which harbour stably integrated, chromosomally encoded resistance factors. © The Author 2017.

abstract={We present a comprehensive scientific assessment of the environmental impacts of an Antarctic wastewater ocean outfall, at Davis station in East Antarctica. We assessed the effectiveness of current wastewater treatment and disposal requirements under the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. Macerated wastewater has been discharged from an outfall at Davis since the failure of the secondary treatment plant in 2005. Water, sediment and wildlife were tested for presence of human enteric bacteria and antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Epibiotic and sediment macrofaunal communities were tested for differences between sites near the outfall and controls. Local fish were examined for evidence of histopathological abnormalities. Sediments, fish and gastropods were tested for uptake of sewage as measured by stable isotopes of N and C. Escherichia coli carrying antibiotic resistance determinants were found in water, sediments and wildlife (the filter feeding bivalve Laternula eliptica). Fish (Trematomus bernacchii) within close proximity to the outfall had significantly more severe and greater occurrences of histopathological abnormalities than at controls, consistent with exposure to sewage. There was significant enrichment of 15 N in T. bernacchii and the predatory gastropod Neobuccinum eatoni around the outfall, providing evidence of uptake of sewage. There were significant differences between epibiotic and sediment macrofaunal communities at control and outfall sites (&lt;1.5 km), when sites were separated into groups of similar habitat types. Benthic community composition was also strongly related to habitat and environmental drivers such as sea ice. The combined evidence indicated that the discharge of wastewater from the Davis outfall is causing environmental impacts. These findings suggest that conditions in Antarctic coastal locations, such as Davis, are unlikely to be conducive to initial dilution and rapid dispersal of wastewater as required under the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. Current minimum requirements for wastewater treatment and disposal in Antarctica are insufficient to ameliorate these risks and are likely to lead to accumulation of contaminants and introduction of non-native microbes and associated genetic elements. This new understanding suggests that modernised approaches to the treatment and disposal of wastewater are required in Antarctica. The most effective solution is advanced levels of wastewater treatment, which are now possible, feasible and a high priority for installation. As a direct outcome of the study, a new advanced treatment system is being installed at Davis, effectively avoiding environmental risks. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Antimicrobial resistance is a global threat to livestock, human and environmental health. Although resistant bacteria have been detected in wildlife, their role in the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance is not clear. Our objective was to investigate demographic, temporal and climatic factors associated with carriage of antimicrobial resistant Escherichia coli in raccoons and the environment. We collected samples from raccoon paws and feces and from soil, manure pit and dumpsters on five swine farms and five conservation areas in Ontario, Canada once every five weeks from May to November, 2011-2013 and tested them for E. coli and susceptibility to 15 antimicrobials. Of samples testing positive for E. coli, resistance to ≥ 1 antimicrobials was detected in 7.4% (77/1044; 95% CI, 5.9-9.1) of raccoon fecal samples, 6.3% (23/365; 95% CI, 4.0-9.3) of paw samples, 9.6% (121/1260; 8.0-11.4) of soil samples, 57.4% (31/54; 95% CI, 43.2-70.8) of manure pit samples, and 13.8% (4/29; 95% CI, 3.9-31.7) of dumpster samples. Using univariable logistic regression, there was no significant difference in the occurrence of resistant E. coli in raccoon feces on conservation areas versus farms; however, E. coli isolates resistant to ≥ 1 antimicrobials were significantly less likely to be detected from raccoon paw samples on swine farms than conservation areas and significantly more likely to be detected in soil samples from swine farms than conservation areas. Resistant phenotypes and genotypes that were absent from the swine farm environment were detected in raccoons from conservation areas, suggesting that conservation areas and swine farms may have different exposures to resistant bacteria. However, the similar resistance patterns and genes in E. coli from raccoon fecal and environmental samples from the same location types suggest that resistant bacteria may be exchanged between raccoons and their environment. © 2016 Bondo et al.

abstract={Unlike Escherichia coli strains belonging to phylogroup B2, the clinical significance of strains belonging to phylogroup F is not well understood. Here we report on a collection of phylogroup F strains recovered in Australia from faeces and extra-intestinal sites from humans, companion animals and native animals, as well as from poultry meat and water samples. The distribution of sequence types was clearly non-random with respect to isolate source. The antimicrobial resistance and virulence trait profiles also varied with the sequence type of the isolate. Phylogroup F strains tended to lack the virulence traits typically associated with phylogroup B2 strains responsible for extra-intestinal infection in humans. Resistance to fluoroquinolones and/or expanded-spectrum cephalosporins was common within ST648, ST354 and ST3711. Although ST354 and ST3711 are part of the same clonal complex, the ST3711 isolates were only recovered from native birds being cared for in a single wildlife rehabilitation centre, whereas the ST354 isolates were from faeces and extra-intestinal sites of dogs and humans, as well as from poultry meat. Although ST354 isolates from chicken meat in Western Australia were distinct from all other ST354 isolates, those from poultry meat samples collected in eastern Australia shared many similarities with other ST354 isolates from humans and companion animals. © 2016 The Authors.},

abstract={Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a worldwide problem with serious health and economic repercussions. Since the 1940s, underuse, overuse, and misuse of antibiotics have had a significant environmental downside. Large amounts of antibiotics not fully metabolized after use in human and veterinary medicine, and other applications, are annually released into the environment. The result has been the development and dissemination of antibiotic-resistant bacteria due to many years of selective pressure. Surveillance of AMR provides important information that helps in monitoring and understanding how resistance mechanisms develop and disseminate within different environments. Surveillance data is needed to inform clinical therapy decisions, to guide policy proposals, and to assess the impact of action plans to fight AMR. The Functional Genomics and Proteomics Unit, based at the University of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro in Vila Real, Portugal, has recently completed 10 years of research surveying AMR in bacteria, mainly commensal indicator bacteria such as enterococci and Escherichia coli from the microbiota of different animals. Samples from more than 75 different sources have been accessed, from humans to food-producing animals, pets, and wild animals. The typical microbiological workflow involved phenotypic studies followed by molecular approaches. Throughout the decade, 4,017 samples were collected and over 5,000 bacterial isolates obtained. High levels of AMR to several antimicrobial classes have been reported, including to β-lactams, glycopeptides, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, sulphonamides, and quinolones. Multi-resistant strains, some relevant to human and veterinary medicine like extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing E. coli and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, have been repeatedly isolated even in non-synanthropic animal species. Of particular relevance are reports of AMR bacteria in wildlife from natural reserves and endangered species. Future work awaits as this threatening yet unsolved problem persists. © 2016 Marinho, Santos, Gonçalves, Poeta and Igrejas.},

abstract={The illegal wildlife trade may increase the risk of infectious disease transmission, and it may not only cause disease outbreaks in humans but also threaten livestock, native wild populations, and ecosystems’ health. Bird species may act as carriers in the transmission of enteric pathogens. However, epidemiological studies on zoonotic bacteria in wild birds are rare in Brazil. From March 2011 to March 2012, we investigated the frequency of Enterobacteriaceae in cloacal swab samples from 109 birds of the passerine and Psittacidae families. These birds were recovered from illegal trade in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and sent to a rehabilitation center. Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from 86 wild birds (78.9%). A mean (±SD) of 1.68 (±1.30) different bacterial species were isolated per bird, with a maximum of five bacterial species from three bird species. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli, followed by Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae and other enteric bacteria. Salmonella ser. Typhimurium was isolated from a Temminck's seedeater (Sporophila falcirostris), and two Salmonella ser. Panama were isolated from two specimens of chestnut-capped blackbird (Chrysomus ruficapillus). Of the 70 selected bacterial isolates, 60 exhibited antibiotic resistance. The resistance patterns varied from one to nine of the antibiotics tested. Resistance to ceftiofur was the most prevalent, followed by ampicillin and ceftriaxone. The dissemination potential of resistant strains in situations typically seen in the management of captive birds may become a problem for the conservation of natural bird populations and for public health. © 2016 Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia},

abstract={Manure application is a source of pathogens to the environment. Through overland runoff and tile drainage, zoonotic pathogens can contaminate surface water and streambed sediment and could affect both wildlife and human health. This study examined the environmental occurrence of gene markers for livestock-related bacterial, protozoan, and viral pathogens and antibiotic resistance in surface waters within the South Fork Iowa River basin before and after periods of swine manure application on agricultural land. Increased concentrations of indicator bacteria after manure application exceeding Iowa's state bacteria water quality standards suggest that swine manure contributes to diminished water quality and may pose a risk to human health. Additionally, the occurrence of HEV and numerous bacterial pathogen genes for Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Salmonella sp., and Staphylococcus aureus in both manure samples and in corresponding surface water following periods of manure application suggests a potential role for swine in the spreading of zoonotic pathogens to the surrounding environment. During this study, several zoonotic pathogens were detected including Shiga-toxin producing E. coli, Campylobacter jejuni, pathogenic enterococci, and S. aureus; all of which can pose mild to serious health risks to swine, humans, and other wildlife. This research provides the foundational understanding required for future assessment of the risk to environmental health from livestock-related zoonotic pathogen exposures in this region. This information could also be important for maintaining swine herd biosecurity and protecting the health of wildlife near swine facilities. © 2016},

abstract={One of the major public health problems facing the world today is the occurrence and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) in the environment. The main reservoir for ARB is the aquatic ecosystems. Culture based methods and qualitative molecular techniques were used to screen and determine the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) and ARB in three different salinity gradients of wetland marsh in the southeast Louisiana of USA. The bacteria of interest include Enterobacter cloacae/aerogenes, Enterococci spp. and Escherichia coli. The antibiotic resistance genes of interest include ermB, sul1, tetA, tetX, tetW, and mecA that are responsible for resistance to erythromycin, sulfonamide, tetracycline, and methicillin antibiotics. The water salinity ranged from 0 to 12 parts per thousand (ppt). Monthly samples were taken for a six-month period and analyzed for the presence of ARB and ARGs along with carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous levels in the water samples. The results indicated salinity did not have significant difference in the presence of ARB and ARGs in the wetlands. Significant numbers of ARB were found in all three salinity levels (0, 6, and 12 ppt) in the marshes of Southeast Louisiana. ARGs were more prevalent in site 2 with the salinity of 6 ppt followed by site 1 with the salinity of 12 ppt and site 3 with 0 ppt salinity. Bacterial load and the pollution load varied from month to month and among the three salinities. This study indicates the presence of ARB and ARGs in the wetland habitat is a cause for concern as the potential threat of the spread of ARGs into native bacteria and into fish and wildlife exists due to human activities even under high salinity habitat. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Salmonella has been detected in the feces of many wildlife species, including raccoons (Procyon lotor), but little is known about the epidemiology of Salmonella in wildlife living in different habitat types. Our objective was to investigate demographic, temporal, and climatic factors associated with the carriage of Salmonella in raccoons and their environment on swine farms and conservation areas. Using a repeated cross-sectional study design, we collected fecal samples from raccoons and environmental samples (soil, manure pits, dumpsters) on 5 swine farms and 5 conservation areas in Ontario, Canada once every five weeks from May to November, 2011-2013. Salmonella was detected in 26% (279/1093; 95% CI 22.9-28.2) of raccoon fecal samples, 6% (88/1609; 95% CI 4.5-6.8) of soil samples, 30% (21/69; 95% CI 20.0-42.7) of manure pit samples, and 23% (7/31; 95% CI 9.6-41.0) of dumpster samples. Of samples testing positive for Salmonella, antimicrobial resistance was detected in 5% (14/ 279; 95% CI 2.8-8.3) of raccoon fecal, 8% (7/89; 95% CI 3.2-15.5) of soil, 10% (2/21; 95% CI 1.2-30.4) of manure pit, and 0/7 dumpster samples. Using multi-level multivariable logistic regression analyses, we found location type (swine farm or conservation area) was not a significant explanatory variable for Salmonella occurrence in raccoon feces or soil (p > 0.05). However, detection of Salmonella in raccoon feces was associated with rainfall, season, and sex with various interaction effects among these variables. We detected a variety of Salmonella serovars that infect humans and livestock in the feces of raccoons indicating that raccoons living near humans, regardless of location type, may play a role in the epidemiology of salmonellosis in livestock and humans in southwestern Ontario. © 2016 Bondo et al.

abstract={β-Lactam antibiotics like cefotaxime are the most commonly used antibacterial agents. Escherichia coli strains 5 A, 10 A, 12 A and 23B isolated from Seagulls feces, are cefotaxime-resistant strains that produces extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Bacterial resistance to these antibiotics occurs predominantly through structural modification on the penicillin-binding proteins and enzymatic inactivation by extended-spectrum β-lactamases. Using classical proteomic techniques (2D-GE) coupled to mass spectrometry and bioinformatics extended analysis, in this study, we report several significant differences in cytoplasmic proteins expression when the strains were submitted to antibiotic stress and when the resistant strains were compared with a non-resistant strain. A total of 79 differentially expressed spots were collected for protein identification. Significant level of expression was found in antibiotic resistant proteins like β-lactamase CTX-M-1 and TEM and also in proteins related with oxidative stress. This approach might help us understand which pathways form barriers for antibiotics, another possible new pathways involved in antibiotic resistance to devise appropriate strategies for their control already recognized by the World Health Organization and the European Commission. Biological Significance This study highlights the protein differences when a resistant strain is under antibiotic pressure and how different can be a sensible and resistant strain at the protein level. This survey might help us to understand the specifics barriers for antibiotics and which pathways are involved in its resistance crosswise the wildlife. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been detected in the microbiota of many wildlife species, including long-distance migrants. Inadequately treated wastes from humans and livestock dosed with antimicrobial drugs are often assumed to be the main sources of AMR towildlife. Whilewildlife populations closely associated with human populations are more likely to harbour clinically important AMR related to that found in local humans and livestock, AMR is still common in remote wildlife populations with little direct human influence. Most reports of AMR in wildlife are survey based and/or small scale, so researchers can only speculate on possible sources and sinks of AMR or the impact of wildlife AMR on clinical resistance. This lack of quantitative data on the flow of AMR genes and AMR bacteria across the natural environment could reflect the numerous AMR sources and amplifiers in the populated world. Ecosystems with relatively simple and well-characterized potential inputs of AMR can provide tractable, but realistic, systems for studying AMR in the natural environment. New tools, such as animal tracking technologies and high-throughput sequencing of resistance genes and mobi-lomes, should be integrated with existing methodologies to understand how wildlife maintains and disperses AMR. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={Objectives: To describe the prevalence and diversity of IncX plasmids with antibiotic resistance genes in Enterobacteriaceae and to identify the most disseminated lineages of the plasmid family. Methods: IncX plasmids were screened in 1894 Enterobacteriaceae isolates resistant to cefotaxime (2 mg/L) or with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (0.05 mg/L) obtained from various sources in five continents using PCR. IncX plasmid-harbouring isolates were identified using MALDI-TOF or biochemical tests, and screened for antibiotic resistance genes using PCR and sequencing; their clonality was determined by PFGE. Horizontal transfer of plasmids was tested using transformation and conjugation. IncX plasmids were characterized by S1-nuclease and PFGE, RFLP and hybridization. Results: A total of 164 Escherichia coli isolates (8.7%, n = 1894) carried at least one IncX subgroup. Seven isolates harboured two distinct subgroups. IncX1 subgroup was found in 93 isolates, followed by IncX2 (35 isolates), IncX4 (28) and IncX3 (15). IncX4 plasmids were not transferred horizontally as single plasmids and therefore excluded from further analysis. The most disseminated lineages of IncX plasmids included IncX1 harbouring qnrS1 and blaTEM-1,-135 found in 36 E. coli from different sources in Europe and Australia and IncX2 carrying qnrS1 and tet(A) detected in nine E. coli from wildlife in Europe. IncX3 plasmids harboured predominantly blaSHV-12 and qnrS1 or qnrB7. Conclusions: IncX plasmids were widely distributed in E. coli from wildlife in Europe and were predominantly associated with fluoroquinolone resistance genes. Plasmids showing indistinguishable restriction profiles were identified in E. coli from different sources and countries suggesting wide dissemination of certain plasmid lineages. © The Author 2016.

abstract={More than 70% of new human pathogens are zoonotic and many originate from the wildlife reservoir. Wildlife rehabilitation centres (WRC) are an easily accessible source for sample and data collection for preventive surveillance, but data collected this way may be biased. We use white storks (Ciconia ciconia) as a model to compare pathogen prevalence obtained in the field and WRC. We address factors that may affect disease prevalence data like origin, the age group and the “diseased” state of WRC admissions. In this study we compared prevalence of Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. in the digestive tract; antibodies against West Nile virus, avian influenza and Newcastle disease virus, and antimicrobial resistance patterns of E. coli between nestling and adult wild storks established in different habitats (n = 90) and storks admitted to two different WRC (n = 30) in the same region. When age groups and colonies of origin were disregarded, the mean enterobacteria (E. coli, Salmonella) and viral antibody prevalence of the wild population (n = 90) were similar to prevalence observed in the individuals admitted to WRC (n = 30). However, in fledgling juvenile storks admitted to WRC, the prevalence of Salmonella spp. (13.3%), E. coli showing resistance to cefotaxime (37.9%) and against two antimicrobials at once (41.4%) were more similar to the prevalence in stork nestlings from landfill-associated colonies (7.9%, 37.1% and 48.6%, respectively for prevalence of Salmonella spp. and E. coli displaying, cefotaxime resistance and resistance against two antimicrobials), and significantly higher than in colonies located in natural habitats (0%; 10.5% and 15.8%, respectively). Thus, pathogen surveillance in individuals from an abundant species admitted to WRC is useful to monitor overall mean prevalence, but for certain pathogens may not be sufficient to detect differences between local populations. In addition, the ecology of the tested species and the specific temporal, spatial and age group distribution of WRC admissions have to be taken into account. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background Improper disposal of medication has several possible consequences such as childhood poisoning, environmental pollution, a negative impact on wildlife, and antibiotic resistance. The number of studies conducted to characterize pharmaceutical disposal practices is limited, particularly in the Middle East. Objective The aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine the behaviour of individuals with respect to the disposal of expired and unused medications. Furthermore, we aimed to identify the best methods of education regarding appropriate, safe disposal of medication. Setting The study was carried out in King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH), and King Saud University (KSU), during a 3-month period from February 2015 to April 2015. Method Twelve hundred patients were randomly selected from KKUH and KSU. Participants were invited to complete paper-based questionnaire with self enumeration. Pilot testing was conducted and involved 50 randomly selected participants. Main outcome measures The proportion of expired medications present in the home and their therapeutic groups, disposal methods of expired and unused medications, and preferred educational methods regarding safe and proper disposing of medications. Results A substantial proportion (79.15 %) of respondents disposed of unwanted medication via household waste, while a small proportion (1.70 %) returned unwanted medication to a pharmacy. Although currently practised disposal methods are undoubtedly unsuitable, 70.20 % of respondents considered finding appropriate, safe methods via which to dispose of unwanted medication their responsibility, and 78.6 % expressed an interest in receiving information concerning the correct disposal of unwanted medication. Conclusion We have demonstrated that a low percentage of respondents have ever received information regarding correct medication disposal. Moreover, the results have shown that over half of the respondents store antibiotics in their households. Additionally, respondents weren’t aware of the consequences of keeping expired medication at home. It is quite clear that the awareness of proper and safe drug disposal among the Saudi population is quite low making it a priority of concerned authorities to implement educational programs. © 2016, Springer International Publishing.},

abstract={The epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance is extremely complex and involves humans, domestic animals (companion and agricultural) and wildlife. In North America there have been very few investigations targeting antimicrobial-resistant organisms in wildlife. In this study, we characterized the susceptibility of Escherichia coli isolated from 75 birds including great horned owls, crows and American robins from the region of Saskatoon, Canada. The recovery rate of E. coli varied significantly between species from 44·8% of robins to 92% of crows. The majority (88·2%) of colonized birds carried only pan-susceptible organisms. Among isolates resistant to at least one antimicrobial, ampicillin resistance was most commonly identified. Three birds carried multidrug-resistant isolates (resistant to ≥3 drug classes), and extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms (CTX-M-15 and SHV2a) were grown from two. We identified a significant relationship between the presence of drug-resistant E. coli and an urban (vs rural) origin of the bird. Our findings suggest that crows, due to their ubiquity and high rate of colonization with E. coli, may be efficient targets for future resistance surveillance studies targeting urban wildlife. Significance and Impact of the Study: Antimicrobial resistance is a global problem affecting people and animals. Few investigations describing the presence drug-resistant organisms in wildlife in North America have been published. In this study, resistant Escherichia coli, including extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing strains, were isolated from wild birds in the Saskatoon region of Canada. We found that the recovery rate of E. coli varied significantly by species and was highest among crows. There was also a significant association between drug resistance and urban vs rural birds. Our results suggest that crows may be a good target for future studies investigating antimicrobial resistance in urban wildlife. © 2016 The Society for Applied Microbiology},

abstract={Herein we describe a protocol for a systematic review of the evidence on whether point sources of anthropogenic effluent are associated with an increase in antibiotic resistance in the adjacent environment. The review question was based on the Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcome, Study Design (PECOS) framework as follows: Is the prevalence or concentration of antibiotic resistant bacteria or resistance genes (O) in soil, water, air or free-living wildlife (P) higher in close proximity to, or downstream from, known or suspected sources of anthropogenic effluent (E) compared to areas more distant from or upstream from these sources (C)? A comprehensive search strategy was created to capture all relevant, published literature. Criteria for two stages of eligibility screening were developed to exclude publications that were not relevant to the question, and determine if the study used a design that permitted estimation of an association between a source and levels of resistance. A decision matrix was created for assessment of risk of bias to internal validity due to sample selection bias, information bias, and confounding. The goal of this protocol is to provide a method for determining the state of knowledge about the effect of point sources on antibiotic resistance in the environment. © Cambridge University Press 2016.},

abstract={The spread of antimicrobial resistance is of major concern for human health and leads to growing economic costs. While it is increasingly hypothesized that wildlife could play an important role in antimicrobial-resistant bacteria dynamics, empirical data remain scarce. The present work builds on a systematic review of the available data in order to highlight the main information we have and to suggest research pathways that should be followed if we aim to fill the gaps in our current knowledge. To achieve this goal, we address four questions: (i) Which resistant bacteria are the most frequently observed in wildlife? (ii) How are resistant bacteria exchanged between wildlife and the other hosts involved? (iii) In which habitats are those resistant bacteria found? (iv) Are resistances associated with certain ecological traits of the host? Synthesis and applications. We highlight the strong link existing between the impact of human activities on natural habitats and the carriage of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria by wildlife. Furthermore, we underline that omnivorous, anthropophilic and carnivorous species are at high risk of being carriers and potentially spreaders of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Identifying among those groups key sentinel species may be of particular interest to implement ecosystem contamination surveillance. Finally, we discuss possible exchange routes for antimicrobial-resistant bacteria between humans and wildlife. Considering that water is of major importance in those exchanges, a critical way to control antimicrobial resistance spread may be to limit aquatic environment contamination by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and antibiotics.

During annual migration, they potentially play a role in the epidemiology of human associated zoonoses. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of isolation and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of Enterobacteriaceae members isolated from cloacal swabs of common European wild birds. Fifty-five cloacal swabs were taken during birds’ entrance evaluation in a rescue centre for injured wild birds in the Province of Messina (Sicily, Italy). All samples were examined for the presence of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae using standard methods and on the isolated strains antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed. Eighty three Enterobacteriaceae strains were isolated from raptors, waterbirds and passerines. The bacterial species isolated were: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Salmonella Typhimurium, Escherichia vulneris, Enterobacter amnigenus biogroup 2, Salmonella Duesseldorf and Hafnia alvei. The isolates showed significant frequencies of antibiotic resistance. Multiresistance to three or more groups of antibiotics also occurred. None of them have shown a phenotypic Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase (ESBL) profile. © 2016, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell’Abruzzo e del Molise “G.Caporale”. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The aim of the study was molecular analysis of coagulase-positive isolates of Staphylococcus bacteria obtained from wild animals and evaluation of their resistance to antimicrobial agents.A total of 76 rectal swabs were taken from wild animals. The species of the Staphylococcus isolates was determined by MALDI TOF MS, susceptibility to antimicrobials was evaluated by phenotypic and molecular methods, epidemiological analysis (ADSRRS-fingerprinting) was also carried out. MRSA isolate was typed by MLST and spa-typing. The animals tested, were carriers (= 38) of coagulase-positive Staphylococcus (S. aureus, S. pseudintermedius and S. delphini B). Analyzed isolates were resistant to 1 or 2 antimicrobials, which was confirmed by the presence of genes (blaZ, ermA, ermB, msrA, tetK and tetM). A multi-drug resistant and methicillin-resistant isolate of S. aureus was obtained as well (MRSA, ST8, t1635, PVL-positive and ACME-negative).The ADSRRS-fingerprinting method enabled interspecific and intraspecific differentiation of coagulase-positive Staphylococcus isolates, revealing a certain degree of correlation between the species of the isolate, and the degree of similarity between the isolates. The presence of resistance genes in 13% (5/38) of the isolates obtained from wild animals, including one methicillin-resistant isolate, is relatively small in comparison to the degree of colonization by resistant strains in humans, livestock or pets. Nevertheless, due to the possibility of contact between wild animals, domestic animals and humans, transmission of resistant strains is possible, as suggested by our isolation of a MRSA strain typed as ST8 and specific spa type t1635, which had previously been isolated exclusively from humans. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Antibiotic resistant and multiple-antibiotic resistant bacteria (MARB) have become increasingly widespread,primarily due to overuse of antibiotics in clinical therapeutics and in growth promotion for livestock. This undermines the usefulness of the drugs and presents a serious problem for human health. Compounding the problem,resistance determinants can spread between different bacteria via transfer of genetic material,so that the digestive tracts of farm animals,for example,have become breeding grounds for MARB. Antibiotics and resistant bacteria enter the environment in both treated and untreated sewage,via wastewater streams from hospitals and pharmaceutical plants,and through agricultural runoff from feedlots and fields fertilized with manure. This has led to contamination of groundwater,lakes,rivers and coastal sea water,and high levels of MARB in wildlife which indicates pollution of these habitats. Here we propose that the level of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in wildlife,for example sea turtles and fish,could be used as a bioindicator to monitor pollution and to evaluate the success of efforts to curtail it. © Paulson et al.},

abstract={This study was conducted to detect the presence of Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) and screen for its antibiotic susceptibility characteristic from wildlife and water samples at Kubah National Park, Sarawak, Malaysia. Samples collected were incubated and streaked on selective medium PALCAM agar to confirm the presence of Listeria spp. before they were further tested using molecular analysis. Specific Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay were performed to target specific virulence gene, haemolysin gene, hlyA to further distinguish the presence of this pathogenic bacteria in the samples. Overall, out of the 30 samples tested, 10 samples were confirmed as to contain L. monocytogenes strains and selected to subsequent antibiotic susceptibility test. Susceptibility patterns to 10 antibiotics were investigated among the L. monocytogenes strains. All strains were uniformly resistant to tetracycline and erythromycin. On the other hand, all strains were sensitive to gentamycin and tobramycin. The multiple antibiotic resistance shown by the strains in this study indicate the potential health hazard associated with the possible transmission between wildlife and water to its surrounding environment especially visitors and workers of Kubah National Park, Sarawak, Malaysia. © All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={In recent decade, aquaculture species, including fish are under danger from bio-aggressors like viruses, bacteria, parasites and fungi. These organisms harm either spontaneously or through aquatic animal husbandry practices or both. The chemicals employed in aquaculture are drugs like antibiotics used to treat diseases, chemicals introduced through construction materials and hormones used to alter the reproductive viability, sex and growth rates. Drugs used to treat disease are the most dangerous to the fish. These persistent antibiotics tend to increase antibiotic-resistant free-living bacteria, thereby altering the composition of normal marine and freshwater bacterial flora. Evidence suggests that these antibiotic-resistant organisms in the marine environment will, in turn, pass their antibiotic resistance genes to other bacteria including human and animal pathogens. Antibiotic treatment in aquaculture is achieved by medicated baths and medicated food. In both cases, the probability exists for antibiotics to pass into the environment, affecting wildlife, remaining in the environment for extended periods of time and exerting their antibiotic effects to human. In this manner, potential alterations of the diversity of the marine micro-biota produced by antibiotics may alter the homeostasis of the marine environment and affect complex forms of life including fish, shellfish, marine mammals, and human beings. The contamination of surface waters with antimicrobials has become an increasing public health concern because of the emergence of multi-resistant pathogens. Efforts to make progress on these issues require us to raise, confront and enact some difficult ethical decisions that will affect the living standard of human. Nevertheless, excessive antibiotic use in aquaculture should be of high concern to the aquaculture industry and its regulators, to public officials dealing with human and animal health and with the preservation of the environment, and to non-governmental organizations dealing with these issues. © 2019 Default.},

abstract={At a human/livestock/wildlife interface, Escherichia coli populations were used to assess the risk of bacterial and antibiotic resistance dissemination between hosts. We used phenotypic and genotypic characterization techniques to describe the structure and the level of antibiotic resistance of E. coli commensal populations and the resistant Enterobacteriaceae carriage of sympatric African buffalo (Syncerus caffer caffer) and cattle populations characterized by their contact patterns in the southern part of Hwange ecosystem in Zimbabwe. Our results (i) confirmed our assumption that buffalo and cattle share similar phylogroup profiles, dominated by B1 (44.5%) and E (29.0%) phylogroups, with some variability in A phylogroup presence (from 1.9 to 12%); (ii) identified a significant gradient of antibiotic resistance from isolated buffalo to buffalo in contact with cattle and cattle populations expressed as the Murray score among Enterobacteriaceae (0.146, 0.258, and 0.340, respectively) and as the presence of tetracycline-, trimethoprim-, and amoxicillin-resistant subdominant E. coli strains (0, 5.7, and 38%, respectively); (iii) evidenced the dissemination of tetracycline, trimethoprim, and amoxicillin resistance genes (tet, dfrA, and blaTEM-1) in 26 isolated subdominant E. coli strains between nearby buffalo and cattle populations, that led us (iv) to hypothesize the role of the human/ animal interface in the dissemination of genetic material from human to cattle and toward wildlife. The study of antibiotic resistance dissemination in multihost systems and at anthropized/natural interface is necessary to better understand and mitigate its multiple threats. These results also contribute to attempts aiming at using E. coli as a tool for the identification of pathogen transmission pathway in multihost systems. © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

abstract={Background: Antibiotic-resistant bacteria pose challenges to healthcare delivery systems globally; however, limited information is available regarding the prevalence and spread of such bacteria in the environment. The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in large-bodied gulls (Larus spp.) at urban and remote locations in Southcentral Alaska to gain inference into the association between antibiotic resistance in wildlife and anthropogenically influenced habitats. Methods: Escherichia coli was cultured (n±115 isolates) from fecal samples of gulls (n±160) collected from a remote location, Middleton Island, and a more urban setting on the Kenai Peninsula. Results: Screening of E. coli from fecal samples collected from glaucous-winged gulls (Larus glaucescens) at Middleton Island revealed 8% of isolates were resistant to one or more antibiotics and 2% of the isolates were resistant to three or more antibiotics. In contrast, 55% of E. coli isolates derived from fecal samples collected from large-bodied gulls (i.e. glaucous, herring [Larus argentatus], and potentially hybrid gulls) on the Kenai Peninsula were resistant to one or more antibiotics and 22% were resistant to three or more antibiotics. In addition, total of 16% of the gull samples from locations on the Kenai Peninsula harbored extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant E. coli isolates (extended-spectrum beta-lactamases [ESBL] and plasmid-encoded AmpC [pAmpC]), in contrast to Middleton Island where no ESBL- or pAmpC-producing isolates were detected. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that increased prevalence of antibiotic resistance is associated with urban environments in Southcentral Alaska and presumably influenced by anthropogenic impacts. Further investigation is warranted to assess how migratory birds may maintain and spread antimicrobial-resistant bacteria of relevance to human and animal health. © 2016 Clara Atterby et al.},

This study investigated the presence of Salmonella in wild birds that were rescued and admitted to the Wildlife First Aid Station of the Endemic Species Research Institute from March 2011 to February 2012 in Taiwan. Fecal samples from the wild birds were collected and cultivated for Salmonella. Salmonella isolates were further subjected to serotype, antimicrobial resistance, and DNA fingerprint analyses. Of the 237 fecal samples, 23 (9.7%) were positive for Salmonella using the method described in ISO 6579. Twenty-four Salmonella isolates were collected as two isolates were simultaneously obtained from one Accipiter trivirgatus. Salmonella Albany at 54.2% was the most isolated serotype, followed by S. Newport (12.5%) and S. Montevideo (8.3%). Other identified serotypes included S. Schwarzengrund, Weltevreden, and Itami. Multiple-drug resistance was detected in 62.5% of the isolates; meanwhile, only 20.8% of the isolates were susceptible to five classes of all tested antibiotics. The DNA fingerprints derived from pulse-field gel electrophoresis revealed a high level of similarity among S. Albany isolates.

abstract={Sewage spills can release antibiotic-resistant bacteria into surface waters, contributing to environmental reservoirs and potentially impacting human health. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are nosocomial pathogens that have been detected in environmental habitats, including soil, water, and beach sands, as well as wildlife feces. However, VRE harboring vanA genes that confer high-level resistance have infrequently been found outside clinical settings in the United States. This study found culturable Enterococcus faecium harboring the vanA gene in water and sediment for up to 3 days after a sewage spill, and the quantitative PCR (qPCR) signal for vanA persisted for an additional week. Culturable levels of enterococci in water exceeded recreational water guidelines for 2 weeks following the spill, declining about five orders of magnitude in sediments and two orders of magnitude in the water column over 6 weeks. Analysis of bacterial taxa via 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed changes in community structure through time following the sewage spill in sediment and water. The spread of opportunistic pathogens harboring high-level vancomycin resistance genes beyond hospitals and into the broader community and associated habitats is a potential threat to public health, requiring further studies that examine the persistence, occurrence, and survival of VRE in different environmental matrices. © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

Panama were isolated from passerine species and all of them showed resistance to multiple antimicrobial drugs, like ampicillin, ceftriaxone, ceftiofur, tetracycline, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, and enrofloxacin. PFGE showed 100% similarity among the Salmonella ser. Typhimurium strain isolated from a Temminck's seedeater (Sporophila falcirostris) and the strains isolated from a human outbreak, in southern Brazil. The two Salmonella ser. Panama strains isolated from two chestnut-capped blackbirds (Chrysomus ruficapillus) present in the same catch showed the same clonal origin and have never been associated with epizooties and human outbreaks.

abstract={Clinically relevant extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing multi-resistant Escherichia coli have been on the rise for years. Initially restricted to mostly a clinical context, recent findings prove their prevalence in extraclinical settings independent of the original occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in the environment. To get further insights into the complex ecology of potentially clinically relevant ESBL-producing E. coli, 24 isolates from wild birds in Berlin, Germany, and 40 ESBL-producing human clinical E. coli isolates were comparatively analyzed. Isolates of ST410 occurred in both sample groups (six). In addition, three ESBL-producing E. coli isolates of ST410 from environmental dog feces and one clinical dog isolate were included. All 10 isolates were clonally analyzed showing almost identical macrorestriction patterns. They were chosen for whole-genome sequencing revealing that the whole-genome content of these 10 E. coli isolates showed a very high genetic similarity, differing by low numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms only. This study gives initial evidence for a recent interspecies transmission of a new successful clone of ST410 E. coli between wildlife, humans, companion animals and the environment. The results underline the zoonotic potential of clinically relevant multi-resistant bacteria found in the environment as well as the mandatory nature of the 'One Health' approach. © FEMS 2015.

abstract={The emerging foodborne and waterborne pathogen, Arcobacter, has been linked to various gastrointestinal diseases. Currently, 19 species are established or proposed; consequently, there has been an increase in the number of publications regarding Arcobacter since it was first introduced in 1991. To better understand the potential public health risks posed by Arcobacter, this review summarizes the current knowledge concerning the global distribution and the prevalence of Arcobacter in food and water. Arcobacter spp. were identified in food animals, food-processing environments and a variety of foods, including vegetables, poultry, beef, dairy products, seafood, pork, lamb and rabbit. A wide range of waterbodies has been reported to be contaminated with Arcobacter spp., such as wastewater, seawater, lake and river water, drinking water, groundwater and recreational water. In addition, Arcobacter has also been isolated from pets, domestic birds, wildlife, zoo and farm animals. It is expected that advancements in molecular techniques will facilitate better detection worldwide and aid in understanding the pathogenicity of Arcobacter. However, more extensive and rigorous surveillance systems are needed to better understand the occurrence of Arcobacter in food and water in various regions of the world, as well as uncover other potential public health risks, that is antibiotic resistance and disinfection efficiency, to reduce the possibility of foodborne and waterborne infections. © 2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={Background: Extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), a group of enzymes conferring resistance to third generation cephalosporins have rapidly increased in Enterobacteriacae and pose a major challenge to human health care. Resistant isolates are common in domestic animals and clinical settings, but prevalence and genotype distribution varies on a geographical scale. Although ESBL genes are frequently detected in bacteria isolated from wildlife samples, ESBL dissemination of resistant bacteria to the environment is largely unknown. To address this, we used three closely related gull species as a model system and collected more than 3000 faecal samples during breeding times in nine European countries. Samples were screened for ESBL-producing bacteria, which were characterized to the level of ESBL genotype groups (SHV, TEM), or specific genotypes (CTX-M). Results: ESBL-producing bacteria were frequently detected in gulls (906 of 3158 samples, 28.7 %), with significant variation in prevalence rates between countries. Highest levels were found in Spain (74.8 %), The Netherlands (37.8 %) and England (27.1 %). Denmark and Poland represented the other extreme with no, or very few positive samples. Genotyping of CTX-M isolates identified 13 different variants, with blaCTX-M-1 and blaCTX-M-14 as the most frequently detected. In samples from England, Spain and Portugal, blaCTX-M-14 dominated, while in the rest of the sampled countries blaCTX-M-1 (except Sweden where blaCTX-M-15 was dominant) was the most frequently detected genotype, a pattern similar to what is known from studies of human materials. Conclusions: CTX-M type ESBLs are common in the faecal microbiota from gulls across Europe. The gull ESBL genotype distribution was in large similar to published datasets from human and food-production animals in Europe. The data suggests that the environmental dissemination of ESBL is high from anthropogenic sources, and widespread occurrence of resistant bacteria in common migratory bird species utilizing urban and agricultural areas suggests that antibiotic resistance genes may also be spread through birds. © 2015 Stedt et al.},

abstract={Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is a pathogen that infects both animals and humans worldwide. The epidemiology of infection caused by Y. pseudotuberculosis is poorly understood; however, its outbreaks have been traced back to a probable source in wildlife. This study aimed to characterise Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates collected from animals with yersiniosis. This study included 90 isolates of Y. pseudotuberculosis collected from different animals with yersiniosis between 1996 and 2013 in Italy. The isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility and were biotyped. Genes associated with virulence plasmid pYV and those encoding O-antigen, high pathogenicity island (HPI), and superantigenic toxin (YPM) were determined by performing PCR. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed using NotI and SpeI enzymes, and 3 dendrograms were generated. No antibiotic resistance was found. The presence of pYV was shown in 57 out of 90 isolates. Virulence profiles of majority of the isolates indicated that they belonged to O:1a and O:1b serotypes, biotype 1, and genetic type 2. Isolates belonging to O:2a serotype were detected in sheep and cattle and were found to be associated (for the first time) with septicemia in hares. Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates belonging to O:5a and O:12-O13 serotypes were also detected in hares. To our knowledge, this is the first study to detect Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates belonging to the O:12-O13 serotype from a clinical case in Europe. Results of PFGE indicated that it was a reliable method for investigating the genetic relatedness of Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates. Thus, characterisation of Y. pseudotuberculosis infection in animals should be considered a possible tool for the surveillance of pseudotuberculosis. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={To establish a possible role for the natural environment in the transmission of clinically relevant AMR bacteria to humans, a literature review was conducted to systematically collect and categorize evidence for human exposure to extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. in the environment. In total, 239 datasets adhered to inclusion criteria. AMR bacteria were detected at exposure-relevant sites (35/38), including recreational areas, drinking water, ambient air, and shellfish, and in fresh produce (8/16). More datasets were available for environmental compartments (139/157), including wildlife, water, soil, and air/dust. Quantitative data from exposure-relevant sites (6/35) and environmental compartments (11/139) were scarce. AMR bacteria were detected in the contamination sources (66/66) wastewater and manure, and molecular data supporting their transmission from wastewater to the environment (1/66) were found. The abundance of AMR bacteria at exposure-relevant sites suggests risk for human exposure. Of publications pertaining to both environmental and human isolates, however, only one compared isolates from samples that had a clear spatial and temporal relationship, and no direct evidence was found for transmission to humans through the environment. To what extent the environment, compared to the clinical and veterinary domains, contributes to human exposure needs to be quantified. AMR bacteria in the environment, including sites relevant for human exposure, originate from contamination sources. Intervention strategies targeted at these sources could therefore limit emission of AMR bacteria to the environment. © 2015 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Increasing interactions between humans, domestic animals and wildlife may result in inter-species transmission of infectious agents. To evaluate the presence of pathogenic E. coli and Salmonella spp. and to test the antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates, rectal swabs from 36 different free-ranging wild mammals were taken from two distinct natural sites in Brazil: Cantareira State Park (CSP, state of São Paulo) and Santa Isabel do Rio Negro Region (SIRNR, state of Amazonas). The swabs were randomly collected and processed for bacterial isolation, identification, characterization and antimicrobial resistance. Eighteen E. coli strains from CSP and 20 from SIRNR were recovered from 14 and 22 individuals, respectively. Strains from animals captured in CSP, the site with the greatest anthropization, exhibited a higher range and percentage of virulence genes, including an eae+/bfpA+ strain. Antimicrobial resistance was verified in strains originating from both sites; however, in strains from SIRNR, aminopenicillins were almost the exclusive antimicrobial class to which strains exhibited resistance, whereas in CSP there were strains resistant to cephalosporins, sulfonamide, aminoglycoside, tetracycline and fluoroquinolone, in addition to strains exhibiting multidrug resistance. Two strains of Salmonella enterica that are known to be associated with reptiles, serotypes Belem and 60:r:e,n,z15, were recovered only from Amazonian animals and showed susceptibility to all classes of antimicrobials that were tested. Although the potential impact of these pathogens on wildlife remains unknown, bacteria isolated from free-ranging wild animals may provide relevant information about environmental health and should therefore be more deeply studied. © 2015, Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia.},

abstract={Summary: Wildlife can contribute to environmental contamination with bacterial pathogens and their transfer to the human food chain. Global usage and frequent misuse of antimicrobials contribute to emergence of new antimicrobial resistant (AMR) strains of foodborne pathogens. We conducted a scoping review of published research to identify and characterize the evidence on wildlife's role in transmission of AMR and/or bacterial pathogens to the food chain. An advisory group (AG) of 13 North American experts from diverse disciplines was surveyed to solicit insight in the review scope, priority topics and research characteristics. A pre-tested search strategy was implemented in seven bibliographic databases (1990 to January 2013). Citations were relevance screened, and key characteristics on priority topics extracted independently by two reviewers. Analysis identified topic areas with solid evidence and main knowledge gaps. North America reported 30% of 866 relevant articles. The prevalence of five targeted bacterial pathogens and/or AMR in any pathogen in wildlife was reported in 582 articles. Transmission risk factors for selected bacteria or AMR in any bacteria were reported in 300. Interventions to control transmission were discussed in 124 articles and formally evaluated in 50. The majority of primary research investigated birds, cervids, rodents, feral pigs, opossums, E. coli (n = 329), Salmonella (n = 293) and Campylobacter (n = 124). An association between wildlife and transmission of bacterial pathogens and/or AMR to the food chain was supported in 122 studies. The scoping review identified a significant body of research on the role of wild birds in the prevalence and transmission of E. coli, Salmonella and Campylobacter. There was little research employing molecular methods contributing to the evidence concerning the importance and direction of transmission of wildlife/pathogen combinations. Given the advancements of these methods, future research should focus in this area to help prioritize future intervention studies and risk mitigation strategies. © 2014 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada Reproduced with the permission of the Minister of the Public Health Agency of Canada.},

abstract={This study evaluated the potential concentrations of four antibiotics: ciprofloxacin (CIP), sulfamethoxazole (SUF), trimethoprim (TRI) and erythromycin (ERY) throughout the rivers of Europe. This involved reviewing national consumption rates together with assessing excretion and sewage treatment removal rates. From this information, it was possible to construct best, expected and worst case scenarios for the discharge of these antibiotics into rivers. Consumption data showed surprising variations, up to 200-fold in the popularity of different antibiotics across different European nations. Using the water resources model GWAVA which has a spatial resolution of approximately 6. ×. 9. km, river water concentrations throughout Europe were predicted based on 31-year climate data. The modelled antibiotic concentrations were within the range of measurements reported previously in European effluents and rivers. With the expected scenario, the predicted annual-average antibiotic concentrations ranged between 0 and 10. ng/L for 90% by length of surface waters. In the worst case scenario concentrations could reach between 0.1 and 1. μg/L at the most exposed locations. As both predicted and observed sewage effluent concentrations were below reported effect levels for the most sensitive aquatic wildlife, no direct toxicity in rivers is expected. Predicted river concentrations for CIP and ERY were closest to effect levels in wildlife, followed by SUF which was 2-3 orders of magnitude lower. TRI appeared to be of the least concern with around 6 orders of magnitude difference between predicted and effect levels. However, mixture toxicity may elevate this risk and antibiotic levels of 0.1-1. μg/L in hotspots may contribute to local environmental antibiotic resistance in microorganisms. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a growing public health concern and has serious implications for both human and veterinary medicine. The nature of the global economy encourages the movement of humans, livestock, produce, and wildlife, as well as their potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria, across international borders. Humans and livestock can be reservoirs for antibiotic-resistant bacteria; however, little is known about the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria harbored by wildlife and, to our knowledge, limited data has been reported for wild-caught reptiles that were specifically collected for the pet trade. In the current study, we examined the antibiotic resistance of lactose-positive Enterobacteriaceae isolates from wild-caught Tokay geckos (Gekko gecko) imported from Indonesia for use in the pet trade. In addition, we proposed that the conditions under which wild animals are captured, transported, and handled might affect the shedding or fecal prevalence of antibiotic resistance. In particular we were interested in the effects of density; to address this, we experimentally modified densities of geckos after import and documented changes in antibiotic resistance patterns. The commensal enteric bacteria from Tokay geckos (G. gecko) imported for the pet trade displayed resistance against some antibiotics including: ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin and tetracycline. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria after experimentally mimicking potentially stressful transportation conditions reptiles experience prior to purchase. There were, however, some interesting trends observed when comparing Tokay geckos housed individually and those housed in groups. Understanding the prevalence of antibiotic resistant commensal enteric flora from common pet reptiles is paramount because of the potential for humans exposed to these animals to acquire antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the potential for released pets to disseminate these bacteria to native wildlife. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The emergence of antimicrobial resistance is arguably the most important threat to human and animal health. The impacts of antimicrobial use can reach far from the site of prescription and wildlife may serve as a conduit for the movement of resistance across landscapes, contributing to the spread of antimicrobial resistance within and between different reservoirs. We compared antimicrobial resistance and life history among wild and domestic species in Chobe, Botswana to explore key attributes and behaviors that may increase exposure and allow resistance to move between humans, animals, and ecosystems. Among 150 fecal samples evaluated from African animals, 41.3% contained Escherichia coli isolates that were resistant to one or two of 10 tested antibiotics, and 13.3% of isolates demonstrated multidrug resistance (three or more antibiotics). Resistance to each of the 10 tested antibiotics was detected among wildlife fecal samples. Resistance was widespread, but not ubiquitous, and isolates from wildlife demonstrated similar patterns of resistance to human E. coli from environmental and clinical sources in the study area. Multidrug resistance was significantly higher in carnivores, water-associated species, and species inhabiting urban areas, suggesting that life history may be key to understanding exposure patterns and transmission dynamics in heterogeneous landscapes. © Wildlife Disease Association 2015.},

abstract={Greater interaction between humans and wildlife populations poses significant risks of anthropogenic impact to natural ecosystems, especially in the marine environment. Understanding the spread of microorganisms at the marine interface is therefore important if we are to mitigate adverse effects on marine wildlife. We investigated the establishment of Escherichia coli in the endangered Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea) by comparing fecal isolation from wild and captive sea lion populations. Fecal samples were collected from wild colonies March 2009– September 2010 and from captive individuals March 2011–May 2013. Using molecular screening, we assigned a phylotype to E. coli isolates and determined the presence of integrons, mobile genetic elements that capture gene cassettes conferring resistance to antimicrobial agents common in fecal coliforms. Group B2 was the most abundant phylotype in all E. coli isolates (n537), with groups A, B1, and D also identified. Integrons were not observed in E. coli (n521) isolated from wild sea lions, but were identified in E. coli from captive animals (n516), from which class I integrases were detected in eight isolates. Sequencing of gene cassette arrays identified genes conferring resistance to streptomycin-spectinomycin (aadA1) and trimethoprim (dfrA17, dfrB4). Class II integrases were not detected in the E. coli isolates. The frequent detection in captive sea lions of E. coli with resistance genes commonly identified in human clinical cases suggests that conditions experienced in captivity may contribute to establishment. Identification of antibiotic resistance in the microbiota of Australian sea lions provides crucial information for disease management. Our data will inform conservation management strategies and provide a mechanism to monitor microorganism dissemination to sensitive pinniped populations. © Wildlife Diase Association 2015.},

abstract={The manner and extent to which birds associate with humans may influence the genetic attributes and antimicrobial resistance of their commensal Escherichia communities through strain transmission and altered selection pressures. In this study, we determined whether the distribution of the different Escherichia coli phylogenetic groups and cryptic clades, the occurrence of 49 virulence associated genes, and/or the prevalence of resistance to 12 antimicrobials differed between four groups of birds from Australia with contrasting types of human association. We found that birds sampled in suburban and wilderness areas had similar Escherichia communities. The Escherichia communities of backyard domestic poultry were phylogenetically distinct from the Escherichia communities sourced from all other birds, with a large proportion (46%) of poultry strains belonging to phylogenetic group A and a significant minority (17%) belonging to the cryptic clades. Wild birds sampled from veterinary and wildlife rehabilitation centers (in-care birds) carried Escherichia isolates that possessed particular virulence-associated genes more often than Escherichia isolates from birds sampled in suburban and wilderness areas. The Escherichia isolates from both the backyard poultry and in-care birds were more likely to be multidrug resistant than the Escherichia isolates from wild birds. We also detected a multidrug-resistant E. coli strain circulating in a wildlife rehabilitation center, reinforcing the importance of adequate hygiene practices when handling and caring for wildlife. We suggest that the relatively high frequency of antimicrobial resistance in the in-care birds and backyard poultry is due primarily to the use of antimicrobials in these animals, and we recommend that the treatment protocols used for these birds be reviewed. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.},

abstract={Staphylococci are commensal organisms of animals, but some species are opportunistic pathogens that are resistant to almost all antimicrobial agents in clinical use. Bacterial resistance to β-lactam antimicrobial agents is widespread and has been investigated in species isolated from humans in addition to food production and companion animals. However, minimal progress has been made towards identifying reservoirs of β-lactam-resistant staphylococci in wildlife. This study was aimed at investigating and characterising β-lactamase resistance from staphylococci of wallaby origin. Staphylococci from free-ranging and captive wallabies were assessed for their phenotypic susceptibility to β-lactam antimicrobial agents prior to sequence analysis of their blaZ and blaR1 genes. Deduced amino acid sequences were classified according to the Ambler molecular characterisation method, assigned a protein signature type and compared with sequences generated from previous studies involving isolates from humans, cattle and companion animals. All BlaZ sequences identified in this study were assignable to a pre-existing β-lactamase class and protein signature type, including the more recently discovered protein signature type 12. Three major phylogenetic groups were resolved upon phylogenetic analysis against published BlaZ sequences. This study has found antibiotic-resistant staphylococci both in free-ranging and captive wallaby populations and these bacteria harbour blaZ variants that are different to those recovered from humans, cattle and companion animals. Further studies of staphylococci from non-traditional sources are required in order to enhance our knowledge of the epidemiology of antibiotic resistance genes. © 2015 International Society for Chemotherapy of Infection and Cancer.

abstract={Summary: It is well understood that Salmonella is carried by animals and in majority of cases as asymptomatic hosts. Surveillance efforts have focused on the role of agriculture and contamination points along the food chain as the main source of human infection; however, very little attention has been paid to the contribution of wildlife in the dissemination of Salmonella and what effect anthropogenic sources have on the circulation of antibiotic resistant Salmonella serovars in wildlife species. A purposive survey was taken of large corvids roosting yearly between November and March in Europe and North America. Two thousand and seven hundred and seventy-eight corvid faecal specimens from 11 countries were submitted for Salmonella spp. culture testing. Presumptive positive isolates were further serotyped, susceptibility tested and analysed for antibiotic resistance genes. Overall, 1.40% (39/2778) (CI = 1.01, 1.90) of samples were positive for Salmonella spp. Salmonella Enteritidis was the most prevalent serovar followed by S. Infantis, S. Montevideo and S. Typhimurium. No significant difference (P > 0.05) was found in the proportion of Salmonella recovered in Europe versus North America. The most variability of serovars within a site was in Kansas, USA with five different serovars recovered. European sites were significantly more likely to yield Salmonella resistant to more than one antibiotic (OR 71.5, P < 0.001, CI = 3.77, 1358) than North American sites, where no resistance was found. Resistance to nalidixic acid, a quinolone, was recovered in nine isolates from four serovars in four different sites across Europe. Large corvids contribute to the transmission and dissemination of Salmonella and resistance genes between human and animal populations and across great distances. This information adds to the knowledge base of zoonotic pathogen prevalence and antibiotic resistance ecology in wild birds. © 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={To determine the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles and prevalence of resistance genes in Escherichia coli isolated from yaks (Bos grunniens) and herdsmen in nine plateau pastures in Tibet, we isolated 184 nonidentical strains of E. coli from yaks and herdsmen. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 15 antimicrobials was conducted and the prevalence of sulfonamide resistance genes (sul1, sul2, and sul3) and florfenicol resistance genes (floR, cfr, cmlA, fexA, pexA, and estDL136) was determined. Escherichia coli isolated from yaks had a high resistance rate to sulfamethoxazole (44%), sulphafurazole (40.4%), and florfenicol (11.4%). Escherichia coli isolated from herdsmen had a high resistance rate to sulfamethoxazole (57%) and sulphafurazole (51%). In addition, sul genes were present in 93% of sulfonamide-resistant isolates (84/90), and 17 floR genes and four cmlA genes were found in 19 florfenicol-resistant isolates. Even though florfenicol is prohibited from use in humans, three floR genes were detected in strains isolated from herdsmen. The three floR-positive isolates from herdsmen had pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns similar to isolates from yaks. In addition to documenting the sul and floR genes in E. coli isolated from yaks and herdsmen in the Tibetan pasture, we demonstrated the potential risk that antimicrobial-resistant E. coli could spread among herdsmen and yaks. © Wildlife Disease Association 2015.},

abstract={Wildlife can act as long-term asymptomatic reservoirs for zoonotic bacteria, such as Salmonella. The prevalence and anti-microbial-susceptibility profiles of Salmonella spp. were assessed in 263 cases in wildlife from 22 animal orders from a wildlife rehabilitation center in Catalonia (NE Spain), September 2013–May 2014. Eleven of 263 tested animals were positive for Salmonella spp., representing an overall prevalence of 4.2%. Prevalences by taxonomic categories were 2% in mammals, 4.7% in birds, and 4.5% in reptiles. By species, one each of European hedgehog (Erinaceus europeus; from a sample of n=26), Eurasian Eagle Owl (Bubo bubo; n=2), Barn Owl (Tyto alba; n=3), Tawny Owl (Strix aluco; n=20), Egyptian Vulture (Neophron percnopterus; n=1), Griffon Vulture (Gyps fulvus; n=1), and Hoopoe (Upupa epops; n=2), and two each Common Kestrels (Falco tinnunculus; n=16) and pond sliders (Trachemys scripta; n=25) were positive for Salmonella. By serotyping, seven of eleven isolates were classified as S. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium, and five of seven belonged to the monophasic variant 4,12:i:-. All the monophasic variants were isolated from birds (4/5 in raptors) and showed a multidrug-resistance (MDR) profile to at least ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamide, and tetracycline (R-type ASSuT), and up to 12 antibiotics. The large proportion of S.

A total of 115 E. coli isolates were isolated from 81 of 146 samples. Confirmed E. coli isolates were tested for their susceptibility to seven antimicrobial agents by disc diffusion. In total, 5.4% (8/146) of samples exhibited multidrug-resistant phenotypes. The phylogenetic group and AMR-encoding genes of all multidrug resistance isolates were determined by PCR. Tetracycline-, ampicillin- and streptomycin-resistant isolates were the most common resistant phenotypes. The following genes were identified in E. coli: blaTEM, strA, tet(A) and tet(B). Plasmids were identified in all samples that exhibited multidrug-resistant phenotypes.

abstract={The purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence, antimicrobial resistance patterns, phenotypic and genotypic relatedness of Salmonella enterica recovered from captive wildlife host species and in the environment in Ohio, USA. A total of 319 samples including faecal (n = 225), feed (n = 38) and environmental (n = 56) were collected from 32 different wild and exotic animal species in captivity and their environment in Ohio. Salmonellae were isolated using conventional culture methods and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility with the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Salmonella isolates were serotyped, and genotyping was performed using the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Salmonella was detected in 56 of 225 (24.9%) faecal samples; six of 56 (10.7%) environmental samples and six of 38 (15.8%) feed samples. Salmonella was more commonly isolated in faecal samples from giraffes (78.2%; 36/46), cranes (75%; 3/4) and raccoons (75%; 3/4). Salmonella enterica serotypes of known public health significance including S. Typhimurium (64.3%), S. Newport (32.1%) and S. Heidelberg (5.3%) were identified. While the majority of the Salmonella isolates were pan-susceptible (88.2%; 60 of 68), multidrug-resistant strains including penta-resistant type, AmStTeKmGm (8.8%; six of 68) were detected. Genotypic diversity was found among S. Typhimurium isolates. The identification of clonally related Salmonella isolates from environment and faeces suggests that indirect transmission of Salmonella among hosts via environmental contamination is an important concern to workers, visitors and other wildlife. Results of this study show the diversity of Salmonella serovars and public health implications of human exposure from wildlife reservoirs. © 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={Salmonella spp. are zoonotic enteric bacteria able to infect humans, livestock and wildlife. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of Salmonella (spp.) and to determine antibiotic susceptibility, serogrouping and presence of invA gene (Salmonella Invasion Gene A) in the detected strains in wild captive herbivores in Iran. The fecal samples of 103 animals from 8 different species were evaluated for presence of the Salmonella. Results indicated that 9.7% of animals were positive for Salmonella, all of these strains belonged to D serogroup, also all the Salmonella strains harbored invA gene. In vitro antibiotic activities of 10 antibiotic substances against the isolates were determined by disc diffusion test. The highest rate of resistance was against Amoxicillin (100%), Tetracycline (80%), Neomycin (60%), Lincospectin (50%) and Enrofloxacin (40%), Resistance to Furazolidone wasn't observed. In conclusion, these species can act as a reservoir for Salmonella. Also, since the study was conducted in some parts of Iran, a more accurate conclusion needs more distributed sampling. To our knowledge this is the first study which reports the fecal shedding of Salmonella from Cervus elaphus, Capra aegarus, Oryx leucoryx, Ammotragus lervia and Lama glama in Iran. © 2015 by Razi Vaccine & Serum Research Institute.},

abstract={Although rat feces are widely suspected to be a source of pathogenic bacteria, few investigators have studied fecal pathogens in rats. We investigated the prevalence and characteristics of Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. in Norway and black rats (Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus, respectively) from an urban neighborhood of Vancouver, Canada, collected September 2011–August 2012. Colon content was cultured for E. coli and Salmonella spp. and screened for the seven most-common enteropathogenic Shiga toxin–producing E. coli (STEC) serotypes by PCR. Isolates were tested for antimicrobial resistance and Salmonella isolates were serotyped. We detected E. coli in 397/633 (62.7%) urban rats. Forty-one of 397 (6.5%) E. coli isolates were resistant to ≥1 antimicrobial while 17 (4.3%) were multidrug resistant (including two isolates demonstrating extended-spectrum b-lactamase resistance). Ten of 633 (1.6%) urban rats were carrying STEC serotypes including O145, O103, O26, and O45. Norway rats were more likely to be carrying E. coli compared to black rats, and there was geographic clustering of specific resistance patterns and STEC serotypes. Salmonella spp. were detected in 3/633 (0.5%) rats including serotypes Derby, Indiana, and Enteritidis. In contrast to zoonotic pathogens for which rats are the natural reservoir (e.g., Leptospira interrogans, Rickettsia typhi, Seoul virus), rats likely acquired E. coli and Salmonella spp. from their environment. The ability of rats to be a ‘sponge’ for environmental pathogens has received little consideration, and the ecology and public health significance of these organisms in rats requires further investigation. © Wildlife Diase Association 2015.},

Eight isolates of Salmonella were found, belonging to Agona and Enteritidis serotypes, with an infection rate of 0.38%. Resistance to ampicillin, cefotaxime, ceftiofur and tetracycline antimicrobials were detected, and some of these strains showed genotypic similarity with Salmonella strains isolated from humans and gulls, suggesting inter-species transmission cycles and strengthening the role of penguins as sanitary sentinels in the Patagonian ecosystem. © Cambridge University Press 2014.},

abstract={Klebsiella pneumoniae is an important emerging pathogen in humans, particularly the invasive hypermucoviscosity (HMV) phenotype. In addition, the organism is an important public health concern because of nosocomial infections and antimicrobial resistance. Nonhuman primates in captivity are susceptible to Klebsiella, particularly when a stress factor is involved. Infections vary depending on the species but can cause significant morbidity and mortality in these animals. The objective of this study was to describe a case of bronchopneumonia and bacteremia caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae in a free-ranging golden-headed lion tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysomelas) caught and maintained in quarantine during a translocation program for conservation purposes. An adult male, that had showed emaciation and apathy, was clinically examined and, despite being provided supportive therapy, died 2 days after onset of clinical signs. At postmortem examination, generalized bilateral pneumonia and pericarditis were observed. Tissue samples were fixed in 10% formalin for histology, and pulmonary tissues and cardiac blood were collected for microbiologic diagnostic procedures. Bacteria that were shown to be HMV K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae strains were isolated from the pulmonary fluids and cardiac blood in pure cultures. Severe bronchopneumonia was the main pathological finding. The consequences of the confirmed presence of the HMV phenotype of K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae in this wildlife species for human, animal, and ecosystem health should be determined. These results demonstrate the importance of quarantine and potential pathogen screening during wildlife translocation procedures. © 2015 The Author(s).},

abstract={Antimicrobial resistance genes can be found in all ecosystems, including those where antibiotic selective pressure has never been exerted. We investigated resistance genes in a collection of faecal samples of wildlife (non-human primates, mice), people and domestic animals (dogs, cats) in Cô te d'Ivoire; in the chimpanzee research area of Taï National Park (TNP) and adjacent villages. Single bacteria isolates were collected from antibiotic-containing agar plates and subjected to molecular analysis to detect Enterobacteriaceae isolates with plasmid-mediated genes of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR). While the prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli in the villages was 27% in people (n577) and 32% in dogs (n538), no ESBL-producer was found in wildlife of TNP (n575). PMQR genes, mainly represented by qnrS1, were also present in human-and dog-originating isolates from the villages (36% and 42% in people and dogs, respectively), but no qnrS has been found in the park. In TNP, different variants of qnrB were detected in Citrobacter freundii isolates originating non-human primates and mice. In conclusion, ESBL and PMQR genes frequently found in humans and domestic animals in the villages were rather exceptional in wildlife living in the protected area. Although people enter the park, the strict biosecurity levels they are obliged to follow probably impede transmission of bacteria between them and wildlife. © 2014 Albrechtova et al.},

abstract={There are a growing number of reports of antibiotic resistance (ATBR) in bacteria living in wildlife. This is a cause for concern as ATBR in wildlife represents a potential public health threat. However, little is known about the factors that might determine the presence, abundance and dispersion of ATBR bacteria in wildlife. Here, we used culture and molecular methods to assess ATBR in bacteria in fecal samples from howler monkeys (Alouatta palliata), spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi), tapirs (Tapirus bairdii) and felids (jaguars, Panthera onca; pumas, Puma concolor; jaguarundis, Puma yagouaroundi; and ocelots, Leopardus pardalis) living freely in two regions of the Mexican state of Veracruz under different degrees of human influence. Overall, our study shows that ATBR is commonplace in bacteria isolated from wildlife in southeast Mexico. Most of the resistances were towards old and naturally occurring antibiotics, but we also observed resistances of potential clinical significance. We found that proximity to humans positively affected the presence of ATBR and that ATBR was higher in terrestrial than arboreal species. We also found evidence suggesting different terrestrial and aerial routes for the transmission of ATBR between humans and wildlife. The prevalence and potential ATBR transfer mechanisms between humans and wildlife observed in this study highlight the need for further studies to identify the factors that might determine ATBR presence, abundance and distribution.

abstract={Along with zoonotic influenza and antimicrobial resistance, rabies has been identified as a key One Health issue by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), World Health Organization (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). It provides an excellent example of a disease that has an impact on public, animal and environmental health, and therefore benefits from a One Health approach to management. Regrettably, this zoonotic disease is still neglected despite the fact that, annually, it kills as many as 70,000 people worldwide (chiefly children in Asia and Africa), millions of dogs suffer and die, and the disease threatens some populations of endangered wildlife. This is particularly unfortunate, given that effective means of prevention exist. As Her Royal Highness Princess Haya of Jordan pointed out in a video to mark World Rabies Day on 28 September 2013, rabies is a serious world public health problem that is all too often underestimated and even neglected. Yet we know it can be eliminated. By combatting rabies at its source in animals and vaccinating 70% of dogs, we can eradicate it.},

abstract={Antimicrobial resistance is a worldwide concern of public health. Unfortunately, resistant bacteria are spreading to all ecosystems, including the strictly protected ones. We investigated antimicrobial resistance in gastrointestinal Enterobacteriaceae of wild mammals and people living within Dzangha-Sangha Protected Areas, Central African Republic, with an emphasis on extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes. We compare resistance genes found in microbiota of humans, gorillas habituated and unhabituated to humans and other wildlife. In gorillas, we additionally investigate the presence of ESBL resistant isolates after treatment by ceftiofur. We found a considerable prevalence of multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates with ESBL and PMQR genes in humans (10% and 31%, respectively). Among wildlife the most significant findings were CTX-M-15-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in a habituated gorilla and a multiresistant Escherichia coli isolate with gene qepA in an unhabituated gorilla. Other isolates from wildlife were mostly represented by qnrB-harboring Citrobacter spp. The relatedness of resistant E. coli was investigated in a PFGE-based dendrogram; isolates from gorillas showed less than 80% similarity to each other and less than 80% similarity to human isolates. No ESBL-producing isolates were found in animals treated by ceftiofur. Although we did not detect any bacterial clone common to wildlife and humans, we detected an intersection in the spectrum of resistance genes found in humans and gorillas, represented by blaCTX-M-15 and qepA. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Antibiotic resistance among wild animals represent an emerging public health concern. The objective of this study was to analyze the staphylococcal nasal microbiota in birds of prey and their content in antimicrobial resistance determinants. Nasal samples from 16 birds of prey were collected, swabs were dipped and incubated into BHI broth [6.5% NaCl] and later seeded on manitol salt agar and oxacillin-resistance screening agar base media. Staphylococcal colonies were isolated from both media and were identified by biochemical and molecular methods. Susceptibility testing to 18 antimicrobial agents was performed by disk-diffusion method. Six of the 16 tested animals carried staphylococci (37.5%) and 7 isolates of the following species were recovered: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus sciuri rodentium, Staphylococcus cohnii urealitycum, and Staphylococcus gallinarum. The S. aureus isolate was penicillin-resistant (with blaZ gene) but methicillin-susceptible and was ascribed to spa-type t012, sequence-type ST30 and agr-type III. The S. epidermidis isolate carried blaZ, mecA, mrs(A/B), mphC, tet(K), drfA, and fusC genes, ica operon, and was typed as ST35. The genes ant6'-Ia, tet(K), tet(L), dfrG, cat221, cat194, and cat223 were detected in S. saprophyticus or S. gallinarum isolates. Birds of prey seem to be a natural reservoir of S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci resistant to multiple antibiotics. Due to the convergence between habitats, the contact between wildlife, other animals and humans is now more common and this involves an increased possibility of interchange of these microorganisms in the different ecosystems. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Contamination of coastal waters can carry pathogens and contaminants that cause diseases in humans and wildlife, and these pathogens can be transported by water to areas where they are not indigenous. Marine mammals may be indicators of potential health effects from such pathogens and toxins. Here we isolated bacterial species of relevance to humans from wild bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus and assayed isolated bacteria for antibiotic resistance. Samples were collected during capture-release dolphin health assessments at multiple coastal and estuarine sites along the US mid-Atlantic coast and the Gulf of Mexico. These samples were transported on ice and evaluated using commercial systems and aerobic culture techniques routinely employed in clinical laboratories. The most common bacteria identified were species belonging to the genus Vibrio, although Escherichia coli, Shewanella putrefaciens, and Pseudomonas fluorescens/ putida were also common. Some of the bacterial species identified have been associated with human illness, including a strain of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) identified in 1 sample. Widespread antibiotic resistance was observed among all sites, although the percentage of resistant isolates varied across sites and across time. These data provide a baseline for future comparisons of the bacteria that colonize bottlenose dolphins in the southeastern USA. © Inter-Research 2014.},

abstract={Microbial communities can augment host immune responses and probiotic therapies are under development to prevent or treat diseases of humans, crops, livestock, and wildlife including an emerging fungal disease of amphibians, chytridiomycosis. However, little is known about the stability of host-associated microbiota, or how the microbiota is structured by innate immune factors including antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) abundant in the skin secretions of many amphibians. Thus, conservation medicine including therapies targeting the skin will benefit from investigations of amphibian microbial ecology that provide a model for vertebrate host-symbiont interactions on mucosal surfaces. Here, we tested whether the cutaneous microbiota of Panamanian rocket frogs, Colostethus panamansis, was resistant to colonization or altered by treatment. Under semi-natural outdoor mesocosm conditions in Panama, we exposed frogs to one of three treatments including: (1) probiotic - the potentially beneficial bacterium Lysinibacillus fusiformis, (2) transplant - skin washes from the chytridiomycosis-resistant glass frog Espadarana prosoblepon , and (3) control - sterile water. Microbial assemblages were analyzed by a culture-independent T-RFLP analysis. We found that skin microbiota of C. panamansis was resistant to colonization and did not differ among treatments, but shifted through time in the mesocosms. We describe regulation of host AMPs that may function to maintain microbial community stability. Colonization resistance was metabolically costly and microbe-treated frogs lost 7-12% of body mass. The discovery of strong colonization resistance of skin microbiota suggests a well-regulated, rather than dynamic, host-symbiont relationship, and suggests that probiotic therapies aiming to enhance host immunity may require an approach that circumvents host mechanisms maintaining equilibrium in microbial communities.},

In this study two unrelated wildlife species herring gulls (Larus argentatus) and a hybrid deer (Cervus elaphus x Cervus nippon) were investigated for the presence of Escherichia coli expressing an AMR phenotype. Findings: Bacterial isolates resistant to β-lactam compounds were identified in both animal species and the production of functional β-lactamase was confirmed using nitrocefin. The prevalence of resistant isolates was higher in herring gulls (87%) compared to deer (31%). Resistance to this class of antibiotic was found only in non-pathogenic E. coli in herring gulls and in both pathogenic and non-pathogenic E. coli strains in deer. Conclusions: The presence of AMR in wildlife has implications for public health, food safety and potable water source protection among others. © 2014 Smith et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Wildlife traded has the potential to carry or transmit potentially pathogenic and high resistant bacteria, that could have an important impact on human health. In this study, Gram-negative bacteria, associated antibiotic resistance and the presence of extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL/AmpC) producing organisms in wild animals presenting at live animal market were investigated. Results revealed that 154 Gramnegative bacteria belong to eleven genera were recovered. Multiple drug resistance phenotypes were exhibited by 24% of tested isolates, the most common being against ampicillin, cephalothin, sulfonamide, aminoglycosides, tetracycline, and quinolones. Maximum resistance to extended-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics occurred in 14.9% of isolates. The presence of ESBL/AmpC phenotype was detected in 11.0% of isolates as confirmed by combination disk method (CDM). The entire positive ESBL/AmpC producers were subjected to plasmid curing to ascertain the location of resistant marker. The result of the plasmid curing indicated that the resistance was chromosomally borne. Molecular analysis identified class 1 and 2 integrons among ESBL positive isolates. The findings have therefore established the presence of multidrug resistant bacteria and ESBL/AmpC producing organisms along with antibiotic resistant determinants in the fecal samples from wild animals and highlights the potential spread of pathogens and resistance between wild animals, environment and human.},

abstract={The selective pressure generated by the clinical misuse of antibiotics has been the major driving force leading to the emergence of antibiotic resistance among bacteria. Antibiotics or even resistant bacteria are released into the environment and contaminate the surrounding areas. Human and animal populations in contact with these sources are able to become reservoirs of these resistant organisms. Then, due to the convergence between habitats, the contact of wild animals with other animals, humans, or human sources is now more common and this leads to an increase in the exchange of resistance determinants between their microbiota. Indeed, it seems that wildlife populations living in closer proximity to humans have higher levels of antibiotic resistance. Now, the Iberian Lynx (Lynx pardinus) is a part of this issue, being suggested as natural reservoir of acquired resistant bacteria. The emerging public health concern regarding microbial resistance to antibiotics is becoming true: the bacteria are evolving and are now affecting unintentional hosts. (Figure presented.)

abstract={Free-flying turkey vultures (Cathartes aura) were sampled in California to investigate the fecal shedding prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter spp., and Escherichia coli. Nine different serotypes of Salmonella enterica were detected in cloacal swabs from turkey vultures, and 6% of vultures were shedding Campylobacter spp.. Turkey vultures sampled at a location with range sheep were more likely to shed tetracycline-resistant E. coli, suggesting that proximity to livestock facilities could facilitate acquisition of drug-resistant bacteria in avian scavengers. These findings illustrate the importance of assessing drug-resistant pathogen transfer at the livestock-wildlife interface. © Copyright 2014 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.},

abstract={The effects of antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance are now spreading beyond hospitals and human-dominated landscapes to encompass the whole biosphere. Antibiotics disseminated by waste streams pollute aquatic systems worldwide. These waste streams are also contaminated by bacteria that carry genes for resistance to antibiotics on mobile DNA elements. This circumstance means that aquatic ecosystems are now an evolutionary reactor for DNA rearrangements where novel genes can be assembled into ever more complex DNA elements, and then transferred into a growing diversity of bacterial species. As a consequence, bacteria containing antibiotic resistance genes have now been identified in a range of marine and terrestrial organisms, including wild species and species harvested for human consumption. The dissemination of these resistance genes will have unpredictable consequences for both native organisms and human welfare. Introduction Water bodies connect soils, oceans and the atmosphere, and provide essential ecosystem services, but are mostly no longer naturally regulated, since the water cycle has been fundamentally altered by human activity. Further deterioration of water quality is caused by sedimentation, salinisation, eutrophication and contamination with chemical and microbial pollutants (Meybeck 2003). Management of water sources in Australia faces unique challenges as it is the driest inhabited continent on Earth, and is subject to unpredictable variations in rainfall. Extraction of water for human activities is having serious ecological consequences in Australia (Kingsford 2000). Furthermore, water bodies are subject to both diffuse and point sources of pollution from industry, sewage and urban run-off (Francey et al. 2010). © Cambridge University Press 2015.},

abstract={To assess implications for public health we compared the resistance of Enterococcus spp. strains to antibacterial drugs in wild and exotic animals with strains originating in domesticated animals and characterized correlations between Enterococcus species, the source of the isolate, and the degree of resistance to selected antibiotics. All strains, regardless of source, were susceptible to blactams, gentamicin, linezolid, and teicoplanin; the highest resistance was to kanamycin, quinupristin, and rifampicin. Thirteen strains from undomesticated animals were resistant to vancomycin, and one strain, from a fox, was resistant to streptomycin (high-dose). Multidrug- resistant strains accounted for 46% of the strains from wild animals and 59%of the strains from an exotic animal (the Russian tortoise; Testudo horsfieldii). Despite the relatively low level of resistance in the strains isolated from wild and exotic animals, the large number of intermediately susceptible strains in these groups is an indication of the evolutionary character of the development of resistance, suggesting that these animals may be potential reservoirs of Enterococcus strains resistant to a wide panel of currently used antibiotics. © Wildlife Disease Association 2014.},

Some drugs are consequently also detected in tap water, but given the extremely low concentrations, risks for direct effects on humans are currently considered negligible. Much higher environmental discharges of pharmaceuticals are found at certain manufacturing sites. Of particular concern for human health are environmental pollution with antibiotics that can promote the development and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. More effective effluent treatment is in many cases an option for management, but economic incentives are key for sparking initiatives.

abstract={Along with zoonotic influenza and antimicrobial resistance, rabies has been identified as a key One Health issue by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), World Health Organization (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). It provides an excellent example of a disease that has an impact on public, animal and environmental health, and therefore benefits from a One Health approach to management. Regrettably, this zoonotic disease is still neglected despite the fact that, annually, it kills as many as 70,000 people worldwide (chiefly children in Asia and Africa), millions of dogs suffer and die, and the disease threatens some populations of endangered wildlife. This is particularly unfortunate, given that effective means of prevention exist. As Her Royal Highness Princess Haya of Jordan pointed out in a video to mark World Rabies Day on 28 September 2013, rabies is a serious world public health problem that is all too often underestimated and even neglected. Yet we know it can be eliminated. By combatting rabies at its source in animals and vaccinating 70% of dogs, we can eradicate it.},

abstract={Wild birds and rodents may play an important role in the dynamics of subclinical pig salmonellosis, either as the introducers of the bacteria into the farm or as receptors of an infection already established in the farm. We tried to gain further insight into the epidemiology of this infection by studying the phenotypic (i.e., serotype and antimicrobial resistance patterns) and molecular characteristics of Salmonella strains isolated from samples collected from pigs and wildlife captured in the vicinity of pig farms. Salmonella-positive pig fecal samples were identified in 56.1% of the 41 farms investigated. Birds shedding Salmonella spp. were detected in 21.4% of the farms despite the low numbers of birds captured in many farms. Most Salmonella isolates from birds (74%) did not show any antimicrobial resistance (AR) pattern and belonged to phage types rarely seen in the pig population (U310, DT56, DT137, DT164), supporting the likely avian source of infection for most birds. The proportion of farms showing Salmonella-infected rodents was higher (46.2%), with Salmonella isolates showing a high homology with those likely originated from pigs. Salmonella-positive environmental samples were found in >50% of the farms, and the characteristics of these Salmonella strains supported the idea of pigs as a major source of Salmonella contamination of the farm environment. Dissemination of Salmonella in pig farms from areas of high Salmonella prevalence appeared to depend to some extent upon rodents and wild birds present in the farm, but the role of rodents in its maintenance seemed to be somewhat more relevant than that of birds. In conclusion, activities aimed at reducing the contact of these wild species with pigs will probably assist in the control of pig salmonellosis. Strict hygienic measures should be considered in areas of high prevalence of infection to lower the high load of environmental contamination. © 2014 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract={Humans have been using plants and extracts from plants containing pharmaceutically active ingredients for thousands of years to treat different kinds of diseases and to improve medical conditions. But, it took some time until the first chemicals were isolated and identified (e.g., salicylic acid from the bark of the willow by J.A. Buchner in 1826) that are responsible for the pharmacological effect. At end of the 19th century, the first chemically synthesized pharmaceuticals, such as the analgesics and fever-reducing drugs phenacetin and aspirin, were introduced into the market and sold to the public. In the 20th century the discovery and production of some other compounds and very important compound classes such as antibiotics increased exponentially. Pharmaceuticals are extensively administered in human and veterinary medicine, also resulting in over- or misuse and undesired side effects, including antibiotic resistance. It was recognized that the application of pharmaceuticals to food-producing animals may also result in residues that remain in the tissues intended for human consumption. Maximum residue levels and suitable withdrawal times were set to avoid potential risks to human health. On the other hand, for many years residues of pharmaceuticals excreted by humans and animals and their potential threat to the environment, wildlife, and humans were not even recognized. It took until the 1990s for this issue to be recognized by the public. And it was by chance that the first pharmaceutically active compound, clofibric acid, was detected in drinking water. This chapter tells the story of the detection of clofibric acid in the environment and in drinking water and how it initiated today’s extensive research activities on pharmaceuticals in the environment. © 2014 by Taylor & Francis Group LLC.},

abstract={Soil and water are suggested to represent pivotal niches for the transmission of Listeria monocytogenes to plant material, animals, and the food chain. In the present study, 467 soil and 68 water samples were collected in 12 distinct geological and ecological sites in Austria from 2007 to 2009. Listeria was present in 30% and 26% of the investigated soil and water samples, respectively. Generally, the most dominant species in soil and water samples were Listeria seeligeri, L. innocua, and L. ivanovii. The human- and animal-pathogenic L. monocytogenes was isolated exclusively from 6% soil samples in regions A (mountainous region) and B (meadow). Distinct ecological preferences were observed for L. seeligeri and L. ivanovii, which were more often isolated from wildlife reserve region C (Lake Neusiedl) and from sites in proximity to wild and domestic ruminants (region A). The higher L. monocytogenes detection and antibiotic resistance rates in regions A and B could be explained by the proximity to agricultural land and urban environment. L. monocytogenes multilocus sequence typing corroborated this evidence since sequence type 37 (ST37), ST91, ST101, and ST517 were repeatedly isolated from regions A and B over several months. A higher L. monocytogenes detection and strain variability was observed during flooding of the river Schwarza (region A) and Danube (region B) in September 2007, indicating dispersion via watercourses. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

abstract={An outbreak of salmonellosis in wild passerines caused mass mortality of Eurasian Tree Sparrows (Passer montanus) in Hokkaido, Japan, 2005-06; however, the etiology was poorly understood. In winter 2008-09, sparrow mortality again occurred in Hokkaido, and 202 deaths in 100 incidents at 94 sites were reported. We conducted a comprehensive investigation to evaluate the cause and impact on sparrow populations. We collected 26 carcasses at 13 sites, including a zoological park. In addition, Salmonella screening of zoo animals was conducted as a biosecurity measure. Salmonella Typhimurium was isolated from multiple organs in all examined sparrows; they were diagnosed with septicemic salmonellosis. Eleven sites (85%) were related to wild bird feeding and six of eight sparrow fecal samples, including from the zoo, were S. Typhimuriumpositive. No infection was detected in zoo animals. Isolates belonged to three phage types: DT40 (88%), DT110 (8%), and DT120 (4%). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns were the same in all isolates, regardless of phage type. Biochemical characteristics and antibiotic-resistance profiles of DT40 were similar in all isolates, indicating a single origin. The mortality was likely associated with that in 2005-06 because the isolates had the same profiles. Tissue levels of sodium, calcium, and magnesium (the main components of chemical deicer suspected to be the major cause of poisoning deaths in 2005-06 mortality) were not higher in the affected sparrows. We conclude that an emerging epidemic infection with S. Typhimurium DT40 related to bird feeding was the cause of sparrow mortality in 2008-09 and suggest that this causative strain is host-adapted to sparrows in Japan. The mortality might have had some impact on the local population, but its influence was limited. © Wildlife Disease Association 2014.},

The aim of this study was to determine antimicrobial resistance and provide molecular characterization of MRSA and methicillin-resistant non-Staphylococcus aureus staphylococci (MRnSA) isolated from wildlife that carried the gene mecC.Methods: Five S. aureus and one coagulase-negative Staphylococcus isolate displaying phenotypic oxacillin resistance, but not recognized with conventional PCRformecA,were furthercharacterized byapolyphasic approach. The presence of mecC in all isolates was determined using specific PCR. PCR targeting Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) genes of MRSA was performed. MRSA isolates were genotyped by spa typing and multilocus sequence typing. All isolates.Results: were genotyped by staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing. 16S rDNA sequence analysis for MRnSA identificationwas performed. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for all isolates. All five MRSA isolates contained the mecC gene, were PVL negative, carried SCCmec type XI and belonged to ST130 (where ST stands for sequence type), with spa types t843, t10513 or t3256, or to ST2620, with spa type t4335. TheMRnSAisolate, mostclosely related to Staphylococcus stepanovicii, carriedmecAand blaZgenes related to SCCmec XI. MRSA isolates exhibited resistance to the β-lactams only.Conclusions: The MRSA isolates described in this study represent the first detection of mecC-positive MRSA in a European otter (Lutra lutra) and a European brown hare (Lepus europaeus). The MRnSA isolate represents the first isolation of MRnSA from a Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx). © The Author 2013.

abstract={A primary challenge to managing emerging infectious disease is identifying pathways that allow pathogen transmission at the human-wildlife interface. Using Escherichia coli as a model organism, we evaluated fecal bacterial transmission between banded mongoose (Mungos mungo) and humans in northern Botswana. Fecal samples were collected from banded mongoose living in protected areas (n = 87, 3 troops) and surrounding villages (n = 92, 3 troops). Human fecal waste was collected from the same environment (n = 46). Isolates were evaluated for susceptibility to 10 antibiotics. Resistant E. coli isolates from mongoose were compared to human isolates using rep-PCR fingerprinting and MLST-PCR. Antimicrobial resistant isolates were identified in 57 % of the mongoose fecal samples tested (range 31-78% among troops). At least one individual mongoose fecal sample demonstrated resistance to each tested antibiotic, and multidrug resistance was highest in the protected areas (40.9%). E. coli isolated from mongoose and human sources in this study demonstrated an extremely high degree of genetic similarity on rep-PCR (AMOVA, F ST = 0.0027, p = 0.18) with a similar pattern identified on MLST-PCR. Human waste may be an important source of microbial exposure to wildlife. Evidence of high levels of antimicrobial resistance even within protected areas identifies an emerging health threat and highlights the need for improved waste management in these systems. © 2013 International Association for Ecology and Health.},

abstract={Salmonella is an important zoonotic pathogen of economic importance. In Europe, salmonellosis is the second food-borne infection, in Italy, Salmonella is still the major cause of food-borne outbreaks. In Europe, there are many Salmonella surveillance plans on farmed animals, while Salmonella survey of wild animals is occasionally performed. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of Salmonella including the antibiotic-resistant strains in wild animals. Between 2002 and 2010, 2,713 wild animals (canids, mustelids, birds, rodents, ungulates), were collected in north-western Italy and tested for Salmonella by classical microbiological culture method followed by serological and biochemical typing. One hundred and seventeen wild animals (63 canids, 25 mustelids, 24 birds, 5 ungulates) were found positive for Salmonella (4.3%). One hundred and thirty strains, belonging to several serotypes were isolated, and S. Typhimurium was the most common serotype found. Antibiotic susceptibility was tested by disk-diffusion test on 88 strains. Almost all the analyzed strains (97.7%) showed resistance/intermediate resistance to at least one class of antibiotics and the highest resistance values were observed for the tetracycline class. In conclusion, zoonotic and antibiotic-resistant serotypes were found in many species of wildlife.},

abstract={Escherichia coli isolated from co-lon, cecal, and fecal samples are commonly used as indicator organisms to monitor antimi-crobial resistance (AMR) in wild animals. The effect of sample type on E. coli recovery and AMR detection is unknown. We compared the prevalence of E. coli, the frequency of AMR, and the level of agreement between cecal, colon, and fecal samples collected from indi-vidual wild house mice (Mus musculus). Samples were collected from 49 mice trapped at swine farms, May-October 2008. We found no difference in the proportion of E. coli-positive samples (82%) among sample types and the agreement among sample types for E. coli recovery ranged from moderate to almost perfect. The percentage of E. coli positive samples resistant to one or more antimicrobial varied from 53% for colon samples to 71% for cecum samples; however, there was no signif-icant difference in the proportion of resistant samples among sample types. The agreement among sample types for resistance to one or more antimicrobial ranged from fair to sub-stantial. These findings indicate that there is no definitive sample type for studies of AMR in house mice. However, we suggest that fecal samples, which have direct contact with the environment, are likely the best sample to use in studies assessing the potential impact of AMR in wildlife on environmental and public health. © Wildlife Disease Association 2013.},

abstract={Defining enteric bacterial flora of clinically healthy capitive houbara bustard and their resistance to antibiotics are an important step in understanding the epidemiology of bacterial diseases. These diseases may affect their population in captivity and so the environment after their release. The study amied to identify the intestinal bacterial flora associated with houbara bustard in captivity and their resistance to currently used antibiotics in Saudi Arabia. Samples from capitive houbara and their environment were cultured for enteric bacteria, tested for resistance to antibiotics and screend for integrons by polymerase chain reaction. A culture based method recoverd a total of 118 bacterial isolates and bacteriological identification revealed that the most encountered species were Escherichia coli 66 (55.9%), followed by Enterococcus sp. 19 (16.1%). The Salmonella sp. Was only detected in 6 (5.1%) samples. All tested samples were negative for Campylobacter sp. The antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed that 18 (15.2%) strains showed multidrug resistance phenotypes against various combinations of antimicrobials tested. Positive screening test for extended spectrum beta-lactams was obtained in eleven strains. Integron detection by PCR identified class 1 and class 2 integrons in nine and two isolates respectively. These results suggest that captive bustard colonized with commensal or potentially pathogenic enteric bacteria and multi-resistance may be likely to contribute to disseminate these multiresistant bacteria to wildlife and local environment. This study provides researchers, wildlife managers and animal ethics committees with information to assist the captive measures and control. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.},

abstract={Enteric bacteria are considered important potential pathogens in avian clinical medicine, causing either primary or opportunistic infections. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of enterobacteria in the intestinal microbiota of psittacine birds and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of the Escherichia coli isolates cultured. Fecal samples were collected from 300 parrots captured from the illegal wildlife trade in Goiás, Brazil and were processed using conventional bacteriological procedures. A total of 508 isolates were obtained from 300 fecal samples: 172 E. coli (33.9% of isolates; 57.3% of individuals); 153 Enterobacter spp. (30.1% of isolates; 51.0% of individuals); 89 Klebsiella spp. (17.7% of isolates; 29.7% of individuals); 59 Citrobacter spp. (11.6% of isolates; 19.7% of individuals), 21 Proteus vulgaris (4.2% of isolates; 7.0% of individuals), 5 Providencia alcalifaciens (0.98% of isolates; 1.67% of individuals), 5 Serratia sp. (0.98% of isolates; 1.67% of individuals), 3 Hafnia aivei (0.59% of isolates; 1.00% of individuals), and 1 Salmonella sp. (0.20% of isolates; 0.33% of individuals). Escherichia coli isolates were subsequently tested for susceptibility to the following antibiotics: amoxicillin (70.93% of the isolates were resistant), ampicillin (75.58%), ciprofloxacin (23.25%), chloramphenicol (33.14%), doxycycline (64.53%), enrofloxacin (41.28%), tetracycline (69.19%), and sulfonamide (71.51%). Multi-resistance to three and four groups of antibiotics occurred in 40 samples (23.25%) and 4 samples (2.32%), respectively. These results demonstrate that illegally traded birds are carriers of potentially pathogenic bacteria, including E. coli strains with antimicrobial resistance.

abstract={Non-typhoidal salmonellosis is an important zoonotic disease caused by Salmonella enterica. This work focuses on the identification of Salmonella enterica clonal strains which, presenting a wide distribution potential, express resistance determinants that compromise effectiveness of the antimicrobial therapy. The screening was performed on 506 Salmonella enterica isolates from animals and humans, which were characterized by serovar and phage typing, genome macrorestriction and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and detection of phenotypic and genotypic traits for antimicrobial resistance. A Salmonella Enteritidis strain with strong quinolone resistance is spread on three host environments carrying one of the four variants found for the GyrA protein: (1) Asp87Tyr, the major polymorphism found in 39 Salmonella isolates from human origin and six from poultry; (2) Ser83Phe, with four isolates from human origin and one from white stork (Ciconia ciconia); and (3) Asp87Asn or (4) Asp87Gly, with two isolates each from human origins. Several Salmonella Typhimurium strains that presented int1 elements and the classically associated pentaresistance (ACSSuT) phenotype were found distributed between two host environments: domestic animals and humans, domestics and wild animals, or wild fauna plus humans. This study points out the importance of monitoring gut microbiota and its antimicrobial resistance from wildlife, in parallel to livestock animals and humans, especially for animal species that are in close contact with people. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract={This study examined the distribution of antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli and E. coli O157 isolated from water, sediment and biofilms in an intensive agricultural watershed (Elk Creek, British Columbia) between 2005 and 2007. It also examined physical and chemical water parameters associated with antibiotic resistance. Broth microdilution techniques were used to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for E. coli (n = 214) and E. coli O157 (n = 27) recovered isolates for ampicillin, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin and tetracycline. Both E. coli and E. coli O157 isolates showed highest frequency of resistance to tetracycline, ampicillin, streptomycin and nalidixic acid; respectively. For E. coli, the highest frequency of resistance was observed at the most agriculturally-impacted site, while the lowest frequency of resistance was found at the headwaters. Sediment and river rock biofilms were the most likely to be associated with resistant E. coli, while water was the least likely. While seasonality (wet versus dry) had no relationship with resistance frequency, length of biofilm colonization of the substratum in the aquatic environment only affected resistance frequency to nalidixic acid and tetracycline. Multivariate logistic regressions showed that water depth, nutrient concentrations, temperature, dissolved oxygen and salinity had statistically significant associations with frequency of E. coli resistance to nalidixic acid, streptomycin, ampicillin and tetracycline. The results indicate that antibiotic resistant E. coli and E. coli O157 were prevalent in an agricultural stream. Since E. coli is adept at horizontal gene transfer and prevalent in biofilms and sediment, where ample opportunities for genetic exchange with potential environmental pathogens present themselves, resistant isolates may present a risk to ecosystem, wildlife and public health. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Purpose: The study is aimed at finding new antibiotic therapy for aquaculture due to potential of bacteria to develop resistance to the existing therapies. Use of large quantities of synthetic antibiotics in aquaculture thus has the potential to be detrimental to fish health, to the environment and wildlife and to human health. Methods: Antimicrobial potential of volatile oil and fractions of chloroform extract of Oreganum vulgare was evaluated alone and in the presence of standard antimicrobials against common fish pathogens by disc-diffusion, agar well assay and two fold microdilution method by nanodrop spectrophotometric method. Results: The best results were represented by volatile oil followed by phenolic fraction by disc-diffusion, agar well and microdilution assays (Minimum inhibitory concentration). By the interaction studies, it was observed that the volatile oil and phenolic fraction were able to inhibit the pathogens at very low concentration compared to standard drugs. The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was calculated and volatile oil and phenolic fractions were found to be synergistic against Pseudomonas fluorescens and Candida albicans. Conclusion: The experimental data suggests the use of volatile oil and phenolic fraction in combination with standard antimicrobials to maintain healthy aquaculture with lesser adverse effects as compared to synthetic antibiotic therapy. © 2013 by Tabriz University of Medical Sciences.},

abstract={Salmonella is distributed worldwide and is a pathogen of economic and public health importance. As a multi-host pathogen with a long environmental persistence, it is a suitable model for the study of wildlife-livestock interactions. In this work, we aim to explore the spill-over of Salmonella between free-ranging wild boar and livestock in a protected natural area in NE Spain and the presence of antimicrobial resistance. Salmonella prevalence, serotypes and diversity were compared between wild boars, sympatric cattle and wild boars from cattle-free areas. The effect of age, sex, cattle presence and cattle herd size on Salmonella probability of infection in wild boars was explored by means of Generalized Linear Models and a model selection based on the Akaike's Information Criterion. Prevalence was higher in wild boars co-habiting with cattle (35.67%, CI 95% 28.19-43.70) than in wild boar from cattle-free areas (17.54%, CI 95% 8.74-29.91). Probability of a wild boar being a Salmonella carrier increased with cattle herd size but decreased with the host age. Serotypes Meleagridis, Anatum and Othmarschen were isolated concurrently from cattle and sympatric wild boars. Apart from serotypes shared with cattle, wild boars appear to have their own serotypes, which are also found in wild boars from cattle-free areas (Enteritidis, Mikawasima, 4:b:- and 35:r:z35). Serotype richness (diversity) was higher in wild boars co-habiting with cattle, but evenness was not altered by the introduction of serotypes from cattle. The finding of a S. Mbandaka strain resistant to sulfamethoxazole, streptomycin and chloramphenicol and a S. Enteritidis strain resistant to ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid in wild boars is cause for public health concern. © 2012 Navarro-Gonzalez et al.},

abstract={Brucellosis, leptospirosis and Q fever are important livestock diseases, commonly responsible for significant production losses, yet their epidemiology in sub-Saharan Africa is largely unknown. Animal reservoirs pose the main risk of transmission to humans, where serious disease can occur. In the developing world setting, the flu-like symptoms of the acute stages of these diseases can be misdiagnosed as malaria, which can result in the administration of the wrong treatment, prolonged disease and increase in antibiotic resistance. Multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression models in this study revealed potential risk factors associated with the aforementioned pathogens in cattle in the Adamawa Region of Cameroon, with wildlife, namely, buffaloes, playing a major role in both Brucella and Coxiella burnetii seropositivity. Cattle mixing with other herds at night and cattle grazing in an area on a route taken by herds on transhumance appear to be positively associated with Leptospira seropositivity, while female cows and whether buffaloes are seen during grazing or transhumance are positively associated with C. burnetii seropositivity. On the other hand, animals that have been on transhumance in the past year and animals belonging to herdsmen of the Fulbe ethnic group appear to be protected against Leptospira and C. burnetii, respectively. Cattle of more than 2 years old appear to have increased odds of being seropositive to either pathogen. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and improve the knowledge of the epidemiology of these three pathogens in Africa, taking particular consideration of the wildlife involvement in the disease transmission. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Livestock and pets have been identified as carriers of Staphylococcus aureus; however, the role of wild animals as a reservoir of S. aureus strains has not yet been examined. We conducted a pilot study to determine the prevalence of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in 37 species of wild animals rehabilitated at a university clinic. Nasal, wing, wound, and cloacal swabs were collected. Of 114 animals, seven (6.1%) were MSSA-positive and three (2.6%) were MRSA-positive. The MRSA isolates were obtained from two eastern cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus) and a Lesser Yellowlegs (Tringa flavipes), a migratory shorebird. Antibiotic resistance testing of the MRSA isolates revealed that two were additionally resistant to tetracycline and erythromycin, and the third isolate was also resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin, and levofloxacin. All three isolates were positive for the Panton- Valentine leukocidin (PVL) gene. Sequence typing of the staphylococcal protein A (spa) region revealed one MRSA isolate to be t002, whereas the other two MRSA isolates were found to be t008. Our results suggest that S. aureus, including MRSA, is being carried by wild animals, although at a low prevalence with the limited number of animals tested. Additional studies are needed to determine how this may impact human health.},

abstract={Methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in particular, have become a public and veterinary health concern. The search for MRS reservoirs outside human hospitals is needed in order to understand the reasons for their persistence and to control their spread. MRS have been isolated from rats, but little is known about their occurrence in foxes. In view of the perceived increasing proximity between people and foxes in the U.K. and the well-documented potential of foxes as hosts for zoonotic pathogens, this study examined whether foxes can be a reservoir for MRS. This study examined the carriage of staphylococci and their antimicrobial resistance patterns in 38 foxes (Vulpes vulpes) from rural and semirural areas in the U.K. Staphylococci were isolated by enrichment culture from nasal, oral, axillary, and perineal swabs and speciated by standard bacteriological tests and API ID32 STAPH (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Antimicrobial resistance was investigated by disc diffusion tests and identification of mecA. Thirty-seven staphylococcal isolates were identified from 35 of the 38 foxes. All isolates were coagulase-negative and most frequently included species from the S. sciuri group (35%), S. equorum (27%), and S. capitis (22%). All were phenotypically resistant to methicillin, and mecA was detected in 33 (89%) of isolates, but only 10 (27%) showed broad β-lactam antibiotic resistance. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus was not identified. These results indicate that foxes are a potential wildlife reservoir for mecA-positive staphylococci. Selection pressure from environmental contamination with antimicrobials should be considered. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract={Wildlife harbor a variety of Campylobacter spp. and may play a significant role in the transmission of Campylobacter to livestock. Although studies have been conducted on wildlife-associated Campylobacter isolates from farms in other countries, there are little data available for livestock farms in the United States. In addition, the critical questions of whether wildlife harbor Campylobacter that is pathogenic to ruminants and/or antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter have yet to be addressed. We captured wild small mammals (n= 142) and small birds (n= 188) at livestock farms in central Iowa and sampled them for thermophilic Campylobacter during autumn 2009, spring 2010, and autumn 2010. Overall prevalence was 4.79%, with isolates found only in wild birds. Molecular typing revealed four multilocus sequence types (STs), three of which are novel. The remaining ST (ST-806) was found in two house sparrows and is an ST previously associated with ruminant abortion cases. Further analysis of ST-806 wild bird and ruminant abortion isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, resistance gene location, and antibiotic susceptibility tests indicated that the isolates are nearly identical. This is the first account of isolation of Campylobacter types from wild birds that are known to be pathogenic to ruminants. Furthermore, these same two wild bird isolates are resistant to the antibiotic fluoroquinolone. Our results indicate there is an overall low prevalence of Campylobacter in selected wildlife in Iowa, but suggest that wildlife may play a role in the epidemiology of pathogenic Campylobacter for domestic livestock, and may also serve as a reservoir for antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Triclocarban (3,4,4′-trichlorocarbanilide, TCC) is used as a broad-based antimicrobial agent that is commonly added to personal hygiene products. Because of its extensive use in the health care industry and resistance to degradation in sewage treatment processes, TCC has become a significant waste product that is found in numerous environmental compartments where humans and wildlife can be exposed. While TCC has been linked to a range of health and environmental effects, few studies have been conducted linking exposure to TCC and induction of xenobiotic metabolism through regulation by environmental sensors such as the nuclear xenobiotic receptors (XenoRs). To identify the ability of TCC to activate xenobiotic sensors, we monitored XenoR activities in response to TCC treatment using luciferase-based reporter assays. Among the XenoRs in the reporter screening assay, TCC promotes both constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) activities. TCC treatment to hUGT1 mice resulted in induction of the UGT1A genes in liver. This induction was dependent upon the constitutive active/androstane receptor (CAR) because no induction occurred in hUGT1Car-/- mice. Induction of the UGT1A genes by TCC corresponded with induction of Cyp2b10, another CAR target gene. TCC was demonstrated to be a phenobarbital-like activator of CAR in receptor-based assays. While it has been suggested that TCC be classified as an endocrine disruptor, it activates ERα leading to induction of Cyp1b1 in female ovaries as well as in promoter activity. Activation of ERα by TCC in receptor-based assays also promotes induction of human CYP2B6. These observations demonstrate that TCC activates nuclear xenobiotic receptors CAR and ERα both in vivo and in vitro and might have the potential to alter normal physiological homeostasis. Activation of these xenobiotic-sensing receptors amplifies gene expression profiles that might represent a mechanistic base for potential human health effects from exposure to TCC. © 2012 Yueh et al.},

abstract={The intensification of human activities within the habitats of wild animals is increasing the risk of interspecies disease transmission. This risk is particularly important for great apes, given their close phylogenetic relationship with humans. Areas of high human density or intense research and ecotourism activities expose apes to a high risk of disease spillover from humans. Is this risk lower in areas of low human density? We determined the prevalence of Escherichia coli antibiotic-resistant isolates in a population of the critically endangered western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and other wild mammals in Lopé National Park (LNP), Gabon, and we tested whether the observed pattern could be explained by bacterial transmission from humans and domestic animals into wildlife populations. Our results show a high prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial isolates in humans and low levels in gorillas and other wildlife. The significant differences in the genetic background of the resistant bacteria isolated from humans and gorillas suggest that transmission is low or does not occur between these two species. These findings indicate that the presence of antibiotic-resistant strains in wildlife do not imply direct bacteria transmission from humans. Thus, in areas of low human density, human-wildlife E. coli transmission seems to be low. The presence of antibiotic-resistant isolates in gorillas may be better explained by other mechanisms for resistance acquisition, such as horizontal gene exchange among bacteria or naturally acquired resistance. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.},

In this study a total of 100 Mongolian Y. pestis strains isolated from wild mammals and their parasites between the years 1960 and 2007 were analyzed for their phenotype. All strains grew well on selective Cefsulodin-Irgasan- Novobiocin agar and were positive for the F1-antigen, the F1-gene (caf1), and the plasminogen activator gene ( pla). Biochemical analyses using the API20E- system identified 93% of the strains correctly as Y. pestis. The BWY in-house system consisting of 38 biochemical reactions was used to differentiate among Y. pestis subspecies pestis biovars Antiqua and Medievalis and also between the subspecies microtus biovars Ulegeica and Caucasica. Antibiotic susceptibility testing according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute-guidelines identified one strain as being multiresistant.

abstract={Increased overlap between humans and wildlife populations has increased the risk for novel disease emergence. Detecting contacts with a high risk for transmission of pathogens requires the identification of dependable measures of microbial exchange.We evaluated antibiotic resistance as a molecular marker for the intensity of human-wildlife microbial connectivity in the Galápagos Islands. We isolated Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica from the feces of land iguanas (Conolophus sp.), marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus), giant tortoises (Geochelone nigra), and seawater, and tested these bacteria with the use of the disk diffusion method for resistance to 10 antibiotics. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were found in reptile feces from two tourism sites (Isla Plaza Sur and La Galapaguera on Isla San Cristóbal) and from seawater close to a public use beach near Puerto Baquerizo Moreno on Isla San Cristóbal. No resistance was detected at two protected beaches on more isolated islands (El Miedo on Isla Santa Fe and Cape Douglas on Isla Fernandina) and at a coastal tourism site (La Lobería on Isla San Cristóbal). Eighteen E. coli isolates from three locations, all sites relatively proximate to a port town, were resistant to ampicillin, doxycycline, tetracycline, and trimethoprin/sulfamethoxazole. In contrast, only five S. enterica isolates showed a mild decrease in susceptibility to doxycycline and tetracycline from these same sites (i.e., an intermediate resistance phenotype), but no clinical resistance was detected in this bacterial species. These findings suggest that reptiles living in closer proximity to humans potentially have higher exposure to bacteria of human origin; however, it is not clear from this study to what extent this potential exposure translates to ongoing exchange of bacterial strains or genetic traits. Resistance patterns and bacterial exchange in this system warrant further investigation to understand better how human associations influence disease risk in endemic Gala ́pagos wildlife. © Wildlife Disease Association 2012.},

abstract={The orange-spined hairy dwarf porcupine (Sphiggurus villosus) is a rodent species common in most parts of South America, and little is known about the pathologies that can afflict it. A specimen was delivered at the Wildlife Research and Medical Center (CEMPAS), School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Husbandry, UNESP, Botucatu, SP, Brazil. The animal showed intense apathy, with purulent secretion in the nasal cavity and fracture of the lumbar spine. Due to the unfavorable prognosis, the porcupine was euthanized and microbiological culture of nasal discharge showed Staphylococcus epidermidis. The antimicrobial resistance test revealed sensitivity to all tested antimicrobials (ampicillin, oxacillin, tetracycline, penicillin G, neomycin, cephalexin, gentamicin, enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, cotrimoxazol, cefoxitin and cephalothin). This bacterium is part of the nasal flora of humans and other animals, and may cause infection under certain conditions. In the present study, the infection and colonization by S. epidermidis was the probable cause of the inflammatory process. The sensitivity to all tested antimicrobials suggests that this strain has not been previously exposed to such drugs. © CEVAP 2012.},

abstract={Michigan has had an ongoing outbreak of endemic Mycobacterium bovis which has been recognized within and sustained by its free-ranging white-tailed deer population since 1994. Worldwide, organisms within the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex have exhibited the ability to develop resistance to antimicrobial agents, resulting in both the multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains of human tuberculosis. Michigan's Bovine Tuberculosis Working Group has conducted active antimicrobial susceptibility testing on wildlife isolates of the endemic M. bovis organism at five-year intervals to detect any emerging drug resistance patterns. The results of 33 white-tailed deer origin isolates collected from the 2009 hunting season are reported here. There continues to be no evidence of any drug resistance except for pyrazinamide resistance. These results are likely due to the lack of antibacterial treatment applied to either wildlife or domestic animals which would provide selection pressure for the development of drug resistance.

abstract={Pharmaceuticals are designed to stimulate a response in humans and animals at low doses, with a very specific target. Tons of them are produced annually worldwide to be consumed by humans and animals. Pharmaceuticals and their metabolites have been recently recognized as environmental emerging organic contaminants. Patients, in case of drugs for human use, or animals for veterinary drugs, are the main sources of contamination. In the environment, pharmaceuticals can be ranked according to environmental loads. Priority pharmaceuticals of concert for the environment can be measured in waste and surface water. However, their resistance to inactivation before exerting their therapeutic effect is paradoxically responsible of bioaccumulation and toxic effects in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Pollution of the aquatic environment by waste pharmaceuticals is an increasing area of concern but little is known about their ecotoxicological effects on the wildlife. In the aquatic environment can be determined non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, analgesics, steroids and regulated hormones, blood-lipid regulators, antibiotics, antidepressants, antineoplasics, drugs of abuse and their metabolites. So, the implications of all of them on environment stability need to be assessed. Assessment of their concentration in different environmental compartments is essential to evaluate their potential ecotoxicological effects. In vitro and in vivo assays suggest that pharmaceutical principles, taken singularly or in combinations, and concentrations close to those detected in the environment, may have ecotoxicological effects. Further knowledge of the causes, occurrence and effects of drugs as environmental pollutants is necessary for a better understanding of this ecological issue, as well as to improve abatement strategies, and to mitigate subtle environmental consequences. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract={Several studies have shown that migratory birds play an important role in the ecology, circulation and dissemination of pathogenic organisms. In October 2006, a health status evaluation was performed on a large population of migratory birds passing through the territory of Ustica (Italy), an island located on the migration route of many species of birds to Africa, and various laboratory tests were conducted. In total, 218 faecal swabs and the internal organs of 21 subjects found dead in nets were collected for bacteriological and virological examination, including avian influenza and Newcastle disease. In addition, 19 pooled fresh faecal samples were collected for mycological examination. The bacteriological analysis produced 183 strains belonging to 28 different species of the Enterobacteriaceae family. In particular, Salmonella bongori, Yersinia enterocolitica and Klebsiella pneumonia strains were isolated. Almost all of the isolates were susceptible to sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprime (99.4%), cefotaxime (98.9%), nalidixic acid (96.7%), chloramphenicol (95.6%), and tetracycline (93.4%). Alternatively, many strains were resistant to ampicillin (42.6%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (42.6%), and streptomycin (43.7%). According to reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction analysis, all of the samples were negative for the M gene of avian influenza virus. Moreover, isolation tests conducted on specific pathogen free eggs were negative for avian influenza and Newcastle disease. Several hyphomycetes and yeasts belonging to different genera were present in the specimens, and Cryptococcus neoformans was observed in a pooled faecal sample. Antibiotic resistance in wildlife can be monitored to evaluate the impact of anthropic pressure. Furthermore, migratory birds are potential reservoirs of pathogenic agents; thus, they can be regarded as sentinel species and used as environmental health indicators. © 2011 Houghton Trust Ltd.},

In this pilot study, the prevalence and patterns of antimicrobial resistance in Escherichia coli cultured from wild herring gull (Larus argentatus) feces and human wastewater at Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA, was compared. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested using Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion with seven antimicrobial agents. A high proportion of antimicrobial agent-resistant E. coli isolates (59.2%) were detected in wastewater samples compared with a lower prevalence of 17.5% in gull feces. In addition, there was a large proportion of isolates with intermediate susceptibility (93.0%) in gull feces. Although similar resistance patterns and shared resistance genes suggest possible wastewater contamination of the local environment, the relatively low frequency of resistance and high prevalence of intermediate susceptibility detected in E. coli cultured from gull feces depict a complex model of antimicrobial resistance among E. coli strains of wildlife origin. © 2011 American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.},

abstract={Aims: Isolate and characterize water enterococci from the South Nation River drainage basin, an area dominated by agriculture.Methods and Results: A total of 1558 enterococci were isolated from 204 water samples from the South Nation River obtained over a 3-year period. PCR was used to identify isolates to the species level and characterize them for carriage of 12 virulence determinants. Antibiotic resistance was evaluated phenotypically. Enterococcus faecalis (36·4%), Enterococcus faecium (9·3%) and Enterococcus durans (8·5%) were the major enterococci species isolated. Enterococci carrying more than two virulence determinants were more frequently detected in the summer (59·6%) than in other seasons (≤37·6%). Very few isolates (≤2·0%) were resistant to category I antibiotics ciprofloxacin and vancomycin.Conclusions: Comparison of major water enterococci species with major faecal enterococci species obtained from various host groups (human, domesticated mammals and birds, wildlife) in this drainage basin suggest that water enterococci may have varied faecal origins. The low level of antibiotic resistance among enterococci suggests that dispersion of antibiotic resistance via waterborne enterococci in this watershed is not significant.Significance and Impact of the Study: The data obtained in this study suggests that water enterococci in the SNR have a faecal origin and that their potential impact on public health regarding antibiotic resistance and virulence determinants is minimal. © 2010 Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.

abstract={Wildlife may facilitate the spread of antibiotic resistance (AR) between human-dominated habitats and the surrounding environment. Here, we use functional metagenomics to survey the diversity and genomic context of AR genes in gulls. Using this approach, we found a variety of AR genes not previously detected in gulls and wildlife, including class A and C β-lactamases as well as six tetracycline resistance gene types. An analysis of the flanking sequences indicates that most of these genes are present in Enterobacteriaceae and various Gram-positive bacteria. In addition to finding known gene types, we detected 31 previously undescribed AR genes. These undescribed genes include one most similar to an uncharacterized gene inVerrucomicrobium and another to a putative DNA repair protein in Lactobacillus. Overall, the study more than doubled the number of clinically relevant AR gene types known to be carried by gulls or by wildlife in general. Together with the propensity of gulls to visit human-dominated habitats, this high diversity of AR gene types suggests that gulls could facilitate the spread of AR. © 2011 Martiny,Martiny, Weihe,Field and Ellis.},

abstract={Bacterial infections are an important cause of sea otter (Enhydra lutris) mortality, and some of these infections may originate from terrestrial and anthropogenic sources. Antimicrobials are an important therapeutic tool for management of bacterial infections in stranded sea otters and for prevention of infection following invasive procedures in free-ranging otters. In this study, susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobials was determined for 126 isolates of 15 bacterial species or groups from necropsied, live-stranded injured or sick, and apparently healthy wild sea otters examined between 1998 and 2005. These isolates included both gram-positive and gramnegative strains of primary pathogens, opportunistic pathogens, and environmental flora, including bacterial species with proven zoonotic potential. Minimal evidence of antimicrobial resistance and no strains with unusual or clinically significant multiple-drug resistance patterns were identified. Collectively, these findings will help optimize selection of appropriate antimicrobials for treatment of bacterial diseases in sea otters and other marine species. © Wildlife Disease Association 2011.},

abstract={Escherichia coli was isolated from wild and captive Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) to investigate the risk of zoonotic infections and the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli in the wild macaque population in Shimokita Peninsula, a rural area of Japan. We collected 265 fresh fecal samples from wild macaques and 20 samples from captive macaques in 2005 and 2006 for E. coli isolation. The predominant isolates were characterized by serotyping, virulence gene profiling, plasmid profiling, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and microbial sensitivity tests. In total, 248 E. coli strains were isolated from 159 fecal samples from wild macaques, and 42 E. coli were isolated from 17 samples from captive macaques. None of the virulence genes eae, stx, elt, and est were detected in any of the isolates. The relatedness between wild- and captive-derived isolates was low by serotyping, PFGE, and plasmid profiling. Serotypes O8:H6, O8:H34, O8:H42, O8:HUT, O103:H27, O103:HNM, and OUT:H27 were found in wild macaque feces; serotypes O157:H42 and O119:H21 were recovered from captive macaques. Oand H-serotypes of the 26 isolates were not typed by commercial typing antisera and were named OUT and HUT, respectively. Twenty-eight isolates had no flagellar antigen, and their H-serotypes were named HNM. Similarity of PFGE patterns between wild-derived isolates and captivederived isolates was,70%. No plasmid profile was shared between wild-derived and captivederived isolates. The prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli was 6.5% (n562) in wild macaques, and these isolates were resistant to cephalothin. We conclude that wild Japanese macaques in Shimokita Peninsula were unlikely to act as a reservoir of pathogenic E. coli for humans and that antimicrobial-resistant E. coli in wild macaques may be derived from humans. © Wildlife Disease Association 2011.},

abstract={Cracids are wildlife Galliformes which inhabits the America's tropical forests. Fifty one cloacal swabs were collected from 10 different species of captive cracids from the Rio Grande do Sul State during 2007. The cloacal swab samples were submitted to bacterial isolation, identification and, subsequently; antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Ninety three bacterial isolates were obtained from the cracid population examined. The most prevalent among the isolates were Escherichia coli, and bacteria from the Staphylococcus and Streptococcus genera. All samples tested in this study were negative for Salmonella spp. The antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed that none of the 93 strains presented resistance to the antimicrobial imipinem. In addition, the lower percentages of resistance were observed against cloranfenicol and ciprofloxacine. The bacteria genus and species with the highest percentage of resistance to the different antimicrobials examined were E. coli, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. In conclusion, the data presented in this article demonstrate that the cloacal microbiota of the reported cracid population is composed of several bacterial genera and species and multi-drug resistance may be a problem for the future, since some strains showed elevated percentage of resistance against several different antimicrobials.},

abstract={Enterococci are gastrointestinal tract residents and also an important cause of nosocomial infections. To understand which species, virulence determinants, and antibiotic resistances are prevalent in enterococci shed by various hosts groups, a total of 1460 strains isolated from 144 fecal samples obtained from wastewater, domesticated mammals and birds, and wildlife were characterized. Identification of isolates to the species level showed that Enterococcus faecalis was dominant in domesticated mammals and birds and wildlife feces, whereas Enterococcus faecium was dominant among wastewater isolates, and that no single Enterococcus species could be associated with a specific host group. The frequency of 12 virulence determinants was evaluated among isolates, but no single virulence determinant could be associated with a specific host group. Resistance to 12 antibiotics was evaluated among isolates, and it was shown that the highest frequency of resistance at breakpoint concentration was found in domesticated mammals and birds (P ≤ 0.05 for 4 antibiotics). Our results suggests that (1) species identification and virulence typing of Enterococcus spp. isolates are not useful for the identification of the host groups responsible for fecal contamination of water by microbial source tracking and that (2) antibiotic use for clinical, veterinary, or animal husbandry practices is promoting resistance.},

abstract={The high concentration of swine production in southeastern North Carolina generates public health concerns regarding the potential transport of pathogens from these production systems to nearby surface waters. The microbial source tracking (MST) tool, antibiotic resistance analysis (ARA), was used to identify sources of E. coli in a segment of Six Runs Creek in Sampson County, North Carolina. Among 52 water samples, fecal coliform (FC) counts averaged 272.1 ± 181.6 CFU/100 mL. Comparisons of isolates from water samples to an ARA library with an average rate of correct classification (ARCC) of 94.3% indicated an average of 64% and 27.1% of 1,961 isolates from Six Runs Creek were associated with lagoon effluent and cattle manure respectively. The potential for aerosol transport of bacteria during lagoon spray events, as well as, the potential for wildlife to serve as a vehicle of transport for bacteria from fields and lagoons to nearby surface waters should be investigated further. © 2010 by the authors.},

abstract={Wild rodents can be carriers of antimicrobial resistant Escherichia coli. As rodents are known to be involved in the transmission of bacteria of human and animal health concern, they could likewise contribute to the dissemination of antimicrobial resistant bacteria in the environment. The aim of this study was therefore to get first insights into the antimicrobial resistance status among E. coli isolated from wild small mammals in rural areas. We tested 188 faecal isolates from eight rodent and one shrew species originating from Germany. Preselected resistant isolates were screened by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing or agar diffusion test and subsequent PCR analysis of resistance genes. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistant isolates was low with only 5.5% of the isolates exhibiting resistant phenotypes against at least one antimicrobial compound including beta-lactams, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides and sulfonamides.These results suggest a minor role of wild rodents from rural areas in the cycle of transmission and spread of antimicrobial resistant E. coli into the environment. Nevertheless E. coli with multiple antimicrobial resistances were significantly more often detected in wildlife rodents originating from areas with high livestock density suggesting a possible transmission from livestock to wild rodents. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The burden of diseases caused by food-borne pathogens remains largely unknown. Importantly data indicating trends in food-borne infectious intestinal disease is limited to a few industrialised countries, and even fewer pathogens. It has been predicted that the importance of diarrhoeal disease, mainly due to contaminated food and water, as a cause of death will decline worldwide. Evidence for such a downward trend is limited. This prediction presumes that improvements in the production and retail of microbiologically safe food will be sustained in the developed world and, moreover, will be rolled out to those countries of the developing world increasingly producing food for a global market. In this review evidence is presented to indicate that the microbiological safety of food remains a dynamic situation heavily influenced by multiple factors along the food chain from farm to fork. Sustaining food safety standards will depend on constant vigilance maintained by monitoring and surveillance but, with the rising importance of other food-related issues, such as food security, obesity and climate change, competition for resources in the future to enable this may be fierce. In addition the pathogen populations relevant to food safety are not static. Food is an excellent vehicle by which many pathogens (bacteria, viruses/prions and parasites) can reach an appropriate colonisation site in a new host. Although food production practices change, the well-recognised food-borne pathogens, such as Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli, seem able to evolve to exploit novel opportunities, for example fresh produce, and even generate new public health challenges, for example antimicrobial resistance. In addition, previously unknown food-borne pathogens, many of which are zoonotic, are constantly emerging. Current understanding of the trends in food-borne diseases for bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens has been reviewed. The bacterial pathogens are exemplified by those well-recognized by policy makers; i.e. Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Antimicrobial resistance in several bacterial food-borne pathogens (Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella and Vibrio spp., methicillin resistant Staphylcoccus aureas, E. coli and Enterococci) has been discussed as a separate topic because of its relative importance to policy issues. Awareness and surveillance of viral food-borne pathogens is generally poor but emphasis is placed on Norovirus, Hepatitis A, rotaviruses and newly emerging viruses such as SARS. Many food-borne parasitic pathogens are known (for example Ascaris, Cryptosporidia and Trichinella) but few of these are effectively monitored in foods, livestock and wildlife and their epidemiology through the food-chain is poorly understood. The lessons learned and future challenges in each topic are debated. It is clear that one overall challenge is the generation and maintenance of constructive dialogue and collaboration between public health, veterinary and food safety experts, bringing together multidisciplinary skills and multi-pathogen expertise. Such collaboration is essential to monitor changing trends in the well-recognised diseases and detect emerging pathogens. It will also be necessary understand the multiple interactions these pathogens have with their environments during transmission along the food chain in order to develop effective prevention and control strategies. © 2010.},

abstract={Antibiotic resistance in bacteria is a growing problem in both human and veterinary medicine. Several studies documented the presence of resistant bacteria in humans, livestock, and domestic animals; however, limited research is available on the presence of antibiotic drug resistance in wildlife species. A cross-sectional study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of resistant bacteria collected from wild-caught, marine predatory fishes. Seven species of sharks and a single teleost species were opportunistically sampled from six different study sites in coastal Belize, coastal and nearshore waters of Louisiana, the Florida Keys, and Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. A total of 134 viable bacteria samples were isolated from the cloacal swabs of predatory fishes. Isolates were characterized by Gram-stain morphology and tested for resistance by using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Thirteen drugs (penicillin G, piperacillin, ticarcillin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftiofur, amikacin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol, and sulfamethoxazole) were selected for this study. Prevalence was calculated as the total number of isolates resistant to one or more drugs against the total number of samples in that study area or fish population. Sharks sampled in the Florida Keys exhibited the greatest resistance to a wide selection of drugs. Resistance to at least one drug was found in each of the six study sites and in all of the fish species sampled. Multidrug resistance was also documented in most of the study sites. Interspecific comparisons between redfish, Sciaenops ocellata, and sharks from Louisiana offshore waters (which represent species of the Carcharhinus genus) demonstrated a significantly higher prevalence in redfish, which may be because of the older age of the population. The findings of this study confirmed the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in marine predatory fishes from multiple taxa and multiple geographic locations.

abstract={Background: Antibiotic resistance, evolving and spreading among bacterial pathogens, poses a serious threat to human health. Antibiotic use for clinical, veterinary and agricultural practices provides the major selective pressure for emergence and persistence of acquired resistance determinants. However, resistance has also been found in the absence of antibiotic exposure, such as in bacteria from wildlife, raising a question about the mechanisms of emergence and persistence of resistant strains under similar conditions, and the implications for resistance control strategies. Since previous studies yielded some contrasting results, possibly due to differences in the ecological landscapes of the studied wildlife, we further investigated this issue in wildlife from a remote setting of the Galapagos archipelago. Methodology/Principal Findings: Screening for acquired antibiotic resistance was carried out in commensal enterobacteria from Conolophus pallidus, the terrestrial iguana of Isla Santa Fe, where: i) the abiotic conditions ensure to microbes good survival possibilities in the environment; ii) the animal density and their habits favour microbial circulation between individuals; and iii) there is no history of antibiotic exposure and the impact of humans and introduced animal species is minimal except for restricted areas. Results revealed that acquired antibiotic resistance traits were exceedingly rare among bacteria, occurring only as non-dominant strains from an area of minor human impact. Conclusions/Significance: Where both the exposure to antibiotics and the anthropic pressure are minimal, acquired antibiotic resistance traits are not normally found in bacteria from wildlife, even if the ecological landscape is highly favourable to bacterial circulation among animals. Monitoring antibiotic resistance in wildlife from remote areas could also be a useful tool to evaluate the impact of anthropic pressure. © 2010 Thaller et al.},

abstract={Avian salmonellosis is a disease caused by bacteria of the genus Salmonella that can cause three distinct diseases in birds: pullorum diseases, fowl typhoid, and paratyphoid infection. Various wildlife species are susceptible to infections by Salmonella, regardless of whether they live in captivity or freely in the wild. The present study verified the presence of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis in three captive specimens of Amazona aestiva. The study involved a total of 103 birds undergoing rehabilitation to prepare for living in the wild, after having been captured from animal traffickers and delivered to the Centrofauna Project of the Floravida Institute in Sao Paulo, Brazil. This is the first report of Salmonella Enteritidis isolation in A. aestiva that originated from capture associated with animal trafficking; Salmonella was detected during the study by the serologic method of rapid serum agglutination on a plate with bacterial isolate. The antimicrobial profile exam of the isolated samples demonstrated sensitivity to ampicillin, cefaclor, ciprofloxacin, and cloranfenicol. The three samples also presented resistance to more than four antibiotics. The presence of the genes invA and spvC was verified by PCR technique and was associated with virulence and absence of class 1 integron, a gene related to antimicrobial resistance. The commercial antigen for pullorum disease was shown to be a useful tool for rapid detection in the screening of Salmonella of serogroup D1 in Psittaciformes. New studies on Salmonella carriage in birds involved in trafficking must be performed to better understand their participation in the epidemiologic cycle of salmonellosis in humans and other animals.},

abstract={Bacterial antimicrobial resistance is a well recognized problem for human and animal health. Evaluation of antimicrobial resistance in enteric microbiota is a owerful tool to monitor selective pressure from drugs used for treating animal and human infectious diseases, or from compounds used in farming practices for ophylaxis. Screening antibiotic susceptibility patterns of wildlife animal isolates provides useful information on environmental contamination by resistant strains, deriving from contaminated effluents or from free-ranging animals that are potential vectors of resistance determinants. Recently, we examined the antimicrobial resistance of Escherichia coli (n=7) and Enterococcus spp. (n=26) isolates obtained from 35 fecal samples from Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra Linnaeus, 1758) free-living in Pego do Altar and Monte Novo reservoirs and associated river stretches in Alentejo region, South Portugal. The 12 antimicrobials, tested as recommended in the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines, belonged to different antimicrobial drug classes, acting through inhibition of transduction (n=6), cell wall synthesis (n=4), DNA gyrase (n=1) and folate synthesis (n=1). Levels of resistance were different for the two bacterial genera considered. All E. coli isolates were susceptible to 5 of the antimicrobials tested, while none of Enterococcus spp. isolates was susceptible to all compounds. All enterococci were esistant to cephalexin, cephotaxim, enrofloxacin and streptomycin. With exception of one E. coli isolate, all bacteria presented a multiresistant profile, being resistant to more than one antimicrobial drug class.The animals sampled were not likely to have been subject to antibiotherapy. Therefore, low resistance levels were expected, since antimicrobial treatment exposure is still considered the major reason for emergence, selection, and dissemination of resistant bacteria. The multiresistant profile found in most isolates supports the hypothesis that environmental exposure of intestinal microbiota to antimicrobial agents may select for resistant bacterial strains, but the occurrence of point mutations or acquisition of transmissible mobile DNA elements responsible for antimicrobial resistance must also be taken into consideration. The antimicrobial resistance profile of E. coli and Enterococcus spp. isolates from otters' fecal samples may provide useful information to assess the potential of antimicrobial resistance transmission from the environment contaminated by humans and domestic and wild animals, being particularly relevant in dams and rivers where human activities, such as farming or outdoor recreational activities, occur near or in the water. Resistance profiles should be taken upon consideration in future plans regarding management and conservation of otters, particularly in environments where cattle density near aquatic systems is high. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

abstract={In the early 1990s different studies highlighted the relationship between pharmaceuticals, human health and the environment. Among the emerging contaminants, antibiotics are obviously of high concern, because of their potential for inducing antibiotic resistance. In addition, natural and synthetic hormones are relevant because of their potential endocrine-disrupting effects on wildlife. This investigation focuses on the analysis of four classes of veterinary and human pharmaceuticals (sulfonamides, tetracyclines, analgesics and hormones) in surface water and wastewater in Luxembourg. The selected eleven pharmaceuticals include four sulfonamides (sulfathiazole, sulfamethoxazole, sulfadimethoxine and sulfamethazine), two tetracyclines (tetracycline and oxytetracycline), two analgesics (ibuprofen and diclofenac), and three hormones (2 naturals, estrone and β-estradiol, and a synthetic one, 17-α-ethinyl estradiol). The most innovative parts of this study are the simultaneous extraction of the above-mentioned pharmaceuticals as well as tracking their behaviour during flood events in a small river catchment. The method includes pre-concentration by solid phase extraction using Oasis® HLB (Hydrophilic Lipophilic Balance) which gave superior results compared to Chromabond® C-18EC, Chromabond® EASY and Bond Elut® PLEXA cartridges, also evaluated in this investigation. The analysis of the investigated pharmaceutical compounds is carried out by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The limits of quantification were 1 ng L- 1, except for β-estradiol (2 ng L- 1) and 17-α-ethinyl estradiol (6 ng L- 1). Recovery rates range from 70 to 94%, with relative standard deviations between 4 and 19%. Application of this method to river concentration and flood events revealed high concentrations of ibuprofen (10-4000 ng L- 1), with highest levels during flood events, while concentrations of estrogens (1-240 ng L- 1) and sulfonamides (1-20 ng L- 1) were comparatively low. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The spread of pathogens in the environment due to human activities (pathogen pollution) may be involved in the emergence of many diseases in humans, livestock and wildlife. When manure from medicated livestock and urban effluents is spread onto agricultural land, both residues of antibiotics and bacteria carrying antibiotic resistance may be introduced into the environment. The transmission of bacterial resistance from livestock and humans to wildlife remains poorly understood even while wild animals may act as reservoirs of resistance that may be amplified and spread in the environment. We determined bacterial resistance to antibiotics in wildlife using the red-billed chough Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax as a potential bioindicator of soil health, and evaluated the role of agricultural manuring with waste of different origins in the acquisition and characteristics of such resistance. Agricultural manure was found to harbor high levels of bacterial resistance to multiple antibiotics. Choughs from areas where manure landspreading is a common agricultural practice harbor a high bacterial resistance to multiple antibiotics, resembling the resistance profile found in the waste (pig slurry and sewage sludge) used in each area. The transfer of bacterial resistance to wildlife should be considered as an important risk for environmental health when agricultural manuring involves fecal material containing multiresistant enteric bacteria including pathogens from livestock operations and urban areas. The assessment of bacterial resistance in wild animals may be valuable for the monitoring of environmental health and for the management of emergent infectious diseases influenced by the impact of different human activities in the environment. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Aspergillosis is a fungal disease caused by fungi of the genus Aspergillus, in particular A. fumigatus and A. flavus. This paper focuses on anatomopathological aspects resulting from a chronic infection from Aspergillus spp in the chicken (Gallus domesticus), in the herring gull (Larus cachinnans micaelli) and in the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa rufa). Microscopically, we observed some histological lesions that are related to the two typical forms of Aspergillosis: a deep nodular form, typical of organs with a non-aerated parenchyma, and a non-encapsulated superficial diffuse form typical of the serosae and the lung. The observed forms of aspergillosis have been found in animals raised in poor hygienic environmental conditions or malnourished animals (chicken); in wild birds from wildlife recovery centres (herring gull), which underwent some forms of stress, such as traumas, detention, starvation, extended antibiotic treatments; in game birds (red-legged partridge) used for restocking natural areas that had been negatively affected by such stressors as captivity in aviaries, containment and transport in cages, release in unsuitable environments and malnutrition. The observed anatomopathological and istopathological aspects can therefore be regarded as the outcome of a number of factors that have reduced the typical resistance of the species and impaired the efficiency of their immune systems. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

abstract={Due to their predatory nature, raptor species may serve as important indicators of environmental contamination with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Raptors prey on small rodents and birds that have diverse habitat ranges, including urban and rural environments, and their intestinal microflora can reflect that of the animals on which they feed. Enterococcus spp. were selected as target organisms because they have been isolated from the avian gastrointestinal tract, can be conferred by prey items, and because they are capable of multiple resistance patterns. They are also a concerning source of human antimicrobial resistance. In this study fecal cultures were obtained from 15 May 2004 to 31 August 2004, from 21 free-living raptors and four captive raptors. Enterococcus was isolated from 21 (84%) of the 25 birds, and 54 isolates were chosen for further study based upon unique colony morphology. The most common isolate recovered was Enterococcus faecalis (95%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 89-100). One bird in the study was determined to have Enterococcus gallinarum. Two distinct ribotypes of E. faecalis were identified, one with unique bands at 11 and 13 kb and the other with unique bands at 14 and 20 kb. Both ribotypes were found in free-living and captive birds. The Enterococcus isolates in this study demonstrated a variety of antimicrobial-resistance characteristics, including almost complete resistance to amikacin, first-generation cephalosporins, spectinomycin, and sulphadimethoxime. Isolates demonstrated variable resistance to chloramphenicol, gentamicin, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, and ticarcillin, No phenotypically vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis isolates were recovered from any of the raptors; three isolates had intermediate level susceptibility. A significantly higher number of isolates collected from captive birds demonstrated resistance to chloramphenicol than those obtained from free-living birds. This trend was not duplicated with any of the remaining 18 antimicrobial drugs tested. The results of this study suggest that raptors in central Illinois are coming into contact with antimicrobials, prey exposed to antimicrobials, or bacteria that are capable of transferring resistance genes. Further study is needed to determine the source of antimicrobial-resistant Enterococcus in free-living raptors but the limited data reflecting few differences between birds with and without antimicrobial exposure suggests that treatment and release of treated wild raptors is not contributing significantly to antimicrobial resistance in the environment. © Wildlife Disease Association 2009.},

abstract={Viability of multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria (MARB) in tertiary treated sewage effluent (TTSE) used for irrigation, was investigated at the Sultan Qaboos University sewage treatment plant (STP). This water recycle system is used here as a model for the systems commonly used throughout Oman and the Gulf region. Samples of TTSE were collected weekly from four sites, 1.5 km from each other. Chlorine levels declined gradually at the three sites with increasing distance from the STP. Viable bacteria, coliforms and nitrate concentrations increased significantly while biological oxygen demand (BOD) declined after STP chlorination. Mean values of turbidity changed slightly. Trace elements values were insignificant. A total of 336 bacteria from 8 genera revealed that the dominant isolates were Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas spp., and Aeromonas spp. Among the isolates 59.8% were multiply resistant to several antibiotics. Resistance was higher to ampicillin followed by sulphamethoxazole, carbenicillin, streptomycine and minocycline. Frequency of resistance to the 14 antibiotics varied among the isolates. The present system related to the viability of MARB in TTSE used for irrigation may have serious implications for public health and wildlife. Results of this investigation will be of value in modifying current STPs systems and thus avoiding serious health issues. © IWA Publishing 2009.},

abstract={The recurrence of reports citing water quality impairments in watersheds is evidence that tools are needed to identify pollution sources and facilitate restoration efforts such as implementing total maximum daily limits (TMDLs) or best management practices (BMPs). Fecal bacteria in surface waters are one of the most commonly cited impairments to water quality. This study evaluated microbial source tracking (MST), specifically multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) analysis, as a management tool to differentiate nonpoint source pollution into source groups. A library containing Escherichia coli (E. coli, EC) and fecal streptococci (FS) isolates from poultry (EC n∈=∈282, FS n∈=∈650), human (EC n∈=∈152, FS n∈=∈240), wildlife (EC n∈=∈17, FS n∈=∈43), horse (EC n∈=∈79, FS n∈=∈82), dairy cattle (EC n∈=∈38, FS n∈=∈42), and beef cattle (EC n∈=∈49, FS n∈=∈46) sources was created. The MAR analysis was conducted on the isolates using a profile of seven antibiotics. The antibiotic signatures of unknown source isolates from Elkhorn and Hickman Creek watersheds were evaluated against the library to determine the contributions of potential fecal inputs from the respective sources. Correct classification was >60% when analyzed at the human and non-human-level of classification. On a watershed basis, both watersheds produced similar results; inputs from non-human sources were the greatest contributors to nonpoint source pollution. The results from the multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) analysis revealed that the information produced, coupled with knowledge of the watershed and its associated land uses, would be helpful in allocating resources to remediate impaired water quality in such watersheds. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={A total of 133 E. coli strains isolated from different food animals and wildlife sources in Sarawak, Malaysia were screened to determine their antibiotic-resistance pattern using the disk diffusion methods. The animal sources were broiler and village chickens, cattle, bats and rodents. All E. coli isolates were tested for their resistance patterns towards 12 commonly used antibiotics: ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, neomycin, nitrofurantoin, ofloxacin, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tetracycline. In general, the most frequently encountered form of resistance in all samples was resistance to tetracycline (41.35%) and sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim (19.55%). Low levels of resistance were for gentamicin, nitrofurantoin and ofloxacin, which demonstrated less than 7% resistance of the total samples being assessed. The Multiple Antibiotic Resistance (MAR) indices were highest for broiler chicken isolates (0.479) and low for bat isolates (0.013). All isolates from both broiler chicken samples were multidrug-resistant E. coli. A high percentage of the isolates from bat (84.62%) and rodent (68.57%) samples were not resistant (totally susceptible) to all the antibiotics tested. The results in this study thus suggest that wildlife do not present a high risk of spreading antibiotic-resistant E. coli to the environment. The higher value of MAR indices as well as prevalence of multiple-resistance patterns of E. coli isolates from food animals demonstrated that indiscriminate use of antibiotics should be discouraged in food animals to overcome future resistance problem. © 2008 Academic Journals Inc.},

abstract={Surveillance of zoonotic pathogens in marine birds and mammals in the Northwest Atlantic revealed a diversity of zoonotic agents. We found amplicons to sequences from Brucella spp., Leptospira spp., Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. in both marine mammals and birds. Avian influenza was detected in a harp seal and a herring gull. Routine aerobic and anaerobic culture showed a broad range of bacteria resistant to multiple antibiotics. Of 1460 isolates, 797 were tested for resistance, and 468 were resistant to one or more anti-microbials. 73% (341/468) were resistant to 1-4 drugs and 27% (128/468) resistant to 5-13 drugs. The high prevalence of resistance suggests that many of these isolates could have been acquired from medical and agricultural sources and inter-microbial gene transfer. Combining birds and mammals, 45% (63/141) of stranded and 8% (2/26) of by-caught animals in this study exhibited histopathological and/or gross pathological findings associated with the presence of these pathogens. Our findings indicate that marine mammals and birds in the Northwest Atlantic are reservoirs for potentially zoonotic pathogens, which they may transmit to beachgoers, fishermen and wildlife health personnel. Conversely, zoonotic pathogens found in marine vertebrates may have been acquired via contamination of coastal waters by sewage, run-off and agricultural and medical waste. In either case these animals are not limited by political boundaries and are therefore important indicators of regional and global ocean health. © Inter-Research 2008.},

abstract={Listeria monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular pathogen that can be carried asymptomatically in various animals and can be shed in feces. We investigated the prevalence and characteristics of L. monocytogenes isolated from livestock, wildlife, and human potential sources of contamination in 2 areas in Ontario, Canada. From February 2003 to November 2005, a total of 268 fecal samples were collected from different animals. Listeria monocytogenes was isolated using selective enrichment, isolation, and confirmation procedures, and 15 samples (6%) yielded to the isolation of 84 confirmed strains. Listeria monocytogenes was isolated from livestock (beef and dairy), wildlife (deer, moose, otter, and raccoon), and human (biosolids and septic) fecal sources. Thirty-two isolates were from serovar 1/2a, 34 from serovar 1/2b, 1 from serovar 3a, and 17 from serovar 4b. Listeria monocytogenes populations were resolved into 13 EcoRI ribotypes, and 18 ApaI and 18 AscI pulsotypes, with Simpson indexes of discrimination of 0.878 and 0.907, respectively. A majority (59%) of L. monocytogenes isolates exhibited potential virulence linked to the production of a functional internalin A, which was supported by higher entry into Caco-2 cells (9.3%) than isolates producing truncated and secreted internalin A (1.3% of entry). Listeria monocytogenes fecal isolates were on average resistant to 6.4 ± 2.5 antibiotics out of 17 tested, and potentially virulent isolates exhibited an enhanced resistance to kanamycin, gentamicin, streptomycin, and rifampicin. Livestock, wildlife, and human L. monocytogenes fecal communities exhibited overlapping but distinct populations, and some genotypes and phenotypes were similar to those previously described for surface water isolates in the same area. © 2007 NRC.},

abstract={Public pressure to reduce or eliminate antimicrobials as ingredients of feed for poultry and other agricultural animals is mounting, primarily due to the fear of multidrug-resistant bacteria in clinical infections in both animals and humans. Exploration of the occurrence of antibiotic resistance in the gut flora of wildlife avian flocks that presumptively do not receive antimicrobials will determine the rate of resistance in a naïve population. Fecal samples collected from a healthy population of the yellow-headed blackbirds (YHB) (Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus) in North Dakota were cultured to determine what genera and species of gram-negative facultative anaerobic bacteria these wild birds carry in their intestinal flora and to evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles. Isolates of Escherichia coli were further characterized for the presence of putative virulence factors and for pathogenic potential using the chicken embryo lethality assay (ELA). The ELA was performed in chicken embryos with challenges at both 12 days and 16 days of incubation to determine whether the 16-day-old embryos were better able to fight the infection and subsequent disease and also to determine whether the ELA could distinguish between primary and secondary avian Escherichia coli pathogens. After screening 33 isolates from the 21 fecal samples, only two E. coli isolates were identified. The predominant genus and species of bacterium identified was Pantoea agglomerans. Collectively, 12 of the 33 isolates (36%) exhibited no resistance to any antimicrobial tested. However, several multidrug-resistant isolates of varying genera were identified. Among the antimicrobial resistances observed, the most common was to ampicillin (60%), followed by cephalothin (33%). Neither E. coli isolate belonged to serogroups that are notorious for causing major outbreaks of colibacillosis in poultry, and only one E. coli isolate retained resistance to any antibiotics; nevertheless, the ELA results indicate that at least one of these E. coli may be a primary pathogen of chickens. This study demonstrates that antibiotic resistance occurs in the gut flora of natural populations of YHB despite the absence of antibiotic pressure. In addition, these results indicate that YHB will harbor E. coli isolates that are potentially pathogenic in poultry. However, these E. coli isolates are not a significant reservoir for multiple antibiotic resistances nor are they widespread in the population of YHB surveyed in North Dakota.},

abstract={Aims: Four bacterial source tracking (BST) methods, enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence polymerase chain reaction (ERIC-PCR), automated ribotyping using HindIII, Kirby-Bauer antibiotic resistance analysis (KB-ARA) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were directly compared using the same collection of Escherichia coli isolates. The data sets from each BST method and from composite methods were compared for library accuracy and their ability to identify water isolates. Methods and Results: Potential sources of faecal pollution were identified by watershed sanitary surveys. Domestic sewage and faecal samples from pets, cattle, avian livestock, other nonavian livestock, avian wildlife and nonavian wildlife sources were collected for isolation of E. coli. A total of 2275 E. coli isolates from 813 source samples were screened using ERIC-PCR to exclude clones and to maximize library diversity, resulting in 883 isolates from 745 samples selected for the library. The selected isolates were further analysed using automated ribotyping with HindIII, KB-ARA and PFGE. A total of 555 E. coli isolates obtained from 412 water samples were analysed by the four BST methods. A composite data set of the four BST methods gave the highest rates of correct classification (RCCs) with the fewest unidentified isolates than any single method alone. RCCs for the four-method composite data set and a seven-way split of source classes ranged from 22% for avian livestock to 83% for domestic sewage. Two-method composite data sets were also found to be better than individual methods, having RCCs similar to the four-method composite and identification of the same major sources of faecal pollution. Conclusions: The use of BST composite data sets may be more beneficial than the use of single methods. Significance and Impact of the Study: This is one of the first comprehensive comparisons using composite data from several BST methods. While the four-method approach provided the most desirable BST results, the use of two-method composite data sets may yield comparable BST results while providing for cost, labour and time savings. © 2007 The Authors.},

abstract={The impact on wildlife health of the increase in the use of antimicrobial agents with the intensification of livestock production remains unknown. The composition, richness and prevalence of cloacal microflora as well as bacterial resistance to antibiotics in nestlings and full-grown Egyptian vultures Neophron percnopterus were assessed in four areas of Spain in which the degree of farming intensification differs. Differences in diet composition, especially the role of stabled livestock carrion, appear to govern the similarities of bacterial flora composition among continental populations, while the insular vulture population (Fuerteventura, Canary Islands) showed differences attributed to isolation. Evidence of a positive relationship between the consumption of stabled livestock carrion and bacterial resistance to multiple antibiotics was found. Bacterial resistance was high for semisynthetic penicillins and enrofloxacin, especially in the area with the most intensive stabled livestock production. The pattern of antibiotic resistance was similar for the different bacterial species within each area. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics may be determined by resistance of bacteria present in the livestock meat remains that constituted the food of this species, as indicated by the fact that resistance to each antibiotic was correlated in Escherichia coli isolated from swine carrion and Egyptian vulture nestlings. In addition, resistance in normal faecal bacteria (present in the microflora of both livestock and vultures) was higher than in Staphylococcus epidermidis, a species indicator of the transient flora acquired presumably through the consumption of wild rabbits. Potential negative effects of the use of antimicrobials in livestock farming included the direct ingestion of these drug residues and the effects of bacterial antibiotic resistance on the health of scavengers. © 2007 The Authors.},

abstract={Campylobacter lari is a rare human pathogen most commonly associated with birds and shellfish. Little information has been published regarding its prevalence in other environments, or on its potential role as a reservoir of antibiotic resistance. In this study, we characterized 109 C. lari isolated from a range of hosts using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of macro-restricted chromosomal DNA, and by determining their susceptibility to a panel of four antibiotics. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis showed C. lari to be genetically diverse, particularly in isolates from wild birds and environmental water. The most common composite macro-restriction profile (cMRP) was found in multiple hosts (cattle, badgers, wild birds and rabbits), and seven other cMRPs were recovered from more than one host. All isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin. Resistance to erythromycin and ampicillin was uncommon, but was observed in isolates from wild birds, cattle, wild mammals and water samples. The presence of the same cMRP in multiple hosts provides further evidence of transmission between livestock, wildlife and the environment, or for a common source of infection. © 2007 The Authors.},

abstract={Providing sufficiently clean water to the public has become a challenging issue worldwide as the quality of water sources increasingly deteriorates. 1 As a consequence, treated wastewater has attracted attention as an alternative water resource, provided appropriate treatment can be applied. 2 Therefore, the removal of microcontaminants, such as pharmaceuticals and personal-care products, in wastewater is critical because many of these compounds survive conventional treatment. 3 In general, these compounds are present at parts per billion (ppb) levels or less in wastewater. 4,5 Although these concentrations are much lower than the levels of traditionally known organic pollutants (such as the persistent organic pollutants DDT, PCBs, and the like) the potential long-term effects of these compounds to humans and wildlife cannot be neglected. For example, several studies have shown that even parts per trillion (ppt) levels of ethinyl estradiol (the active ingredients of birth control pills) and natural estrogens can disrupt the hormone system of aquatic species. 6,7 In addition, low levels of antibiotics from the effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) can promote antibiotic resistance in microorganisms that are exposed constantly to these compounds. 8–10 © 2008 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The state of Michigan has recognized the presence of Mycobacterium bovis in its free-ranging white-tailed deer population since 1994. This endemic infection is primarily located in a 12-county area in the northeastern lower peninsula of Michigan. A statewide surveillance and eradication program of the disease has been in effect since 1994. Worldwide, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex organisms have a known predilection toward development of antimicrobial resistance. The objective of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of M. bovis isolates from white-tailed deer in Michigan and detect any changes in susceptibility over time. M. bovis isolates from 2 fall hunting seasons (1999 and 2004) were used in this study. The fall season of 2004 marked the first documented case of direct transmission of M. bovis from a wild deer to a human in Michigan. Since M. bovis is a zoonotic disease, knowledge of susceptibility can expedite treatment options in humans. M. bovis isolates were obtained from 58 deer, 4 coyotes, 3 cattle, 2 raccoons, and 1 human case from the 2 years combined. Methods of susceptibility testing included 1% proportion agar plates and Bactec radiometric broth testing. M. bovis was found to be uniformly resistant to the antibiotic pyrazinamide; this resistance is common to all M. bovis isolates. No other antimicrobial resistance was found in any of the tested M. bovis isolates, which may be, in part, attributed to the lack of any significant treatment pressure in wildlife.},

abstract={Chytridiomycosis is an emerging infectious disease of amphibians caused by a chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. This panzootic does not equally affect all amphibian species within an assemblage; some populations decline, others persist. Little is known about the factors that affect disease resistance. Differences in behavior, life history, biogeography, or immune function may impact survival. We found that an innate immune defense, antimicrobial skin peptides, varied significantly among species within a rainforest stream amphibian assemblage that has not been exposed to B. dendrobatidis. If exposed, all amphibian species at this central Panamanian site are at risk of population declines. In vitro pathogen growth inhibition by peptides from Panamanian species compared with species with known resistance (Rana pipiens and Xenopus laevis) or susceptibility (Bufo boreas) suggests that of the nine species examined, two species (Centrolene prosoblepon and Phyllomedusa lemur) may demonstrate strong resistance, and the other species will have a higher risk of disease-associated population declines. We found little variation among geographically distinct B. dendrobatidis isolates in sensitivity to an amphibian skin peptide mixture. This supports the hypothesis that B. dendrobatidis is a generalist pathogen and that species possessing an innate immunologic defense at the time of disease emergence are more likely to survive. © Wildlife Disease Association 2006.},

abstract={Vaccination is without doubt the most useful single measure available to prevent animal infectious diseases. The advantages of vaccination are numerous. It is the only available method to prevent, or sometimes cure, viral animal infections in the absence of broad spectrum antivirals and avoids the alternative of mass slaughtering of livestock. Antibiotic or anthelmintic resistance, and the problem of pharmaceutical residues, promote the use of vaccines rather than chemotherapy. Vaccines are environmentally friendly and increase animal welfare by preventing suffering from disease resulting from treatment for a cure which may result in antibiotic resistance and pharmaceutical residues in food. For the management of livestock health vaccines are the best tool to achieve sustainability. Veterinary vaccines cannot only be used to protect animal health but also human health from zoonotic infections through animal vaccination as exemplified by wildlife vaccination against rabies. In animal health the focus is now on animal infections rather than on animal diseases. Vaccines should be designed to prevent infection rather than to prevent clinical signs of disease and should, wherever possible, produce sterile immunity. Available technologies allow us to design "marker" vaccines together with their companion diagnostic tests which permit the distinction between vaccinated and infected animals even if the latter were previously vaccinated. Examples will be given of foot-and-mouth disease, classical swine fever, and herpesvirus infections of livestock such as pseudorabies or infectious bovine rhinotracheitis where carrier state or latency remain an issue after vaccination.},

I will also present my own research regarding potential sources of fecal bacteria in the Upper Arkansas River Watershed of Western Kansas. My work has utilized sampling networks to isolate sources of bacteria geographically and bacterial source tracing (BST) with antibiotic resistance analysis (ARA) of Enterococcus bacteria to identify sources of contamination within functional groups: e.g. humans, pets, wildlife, and livestock. I will review the challenges in implementing BST in a watershed with a diversity of potential sources, as well as recent successes suggesting that BST is more effective, and more cost effective, when applied to specific sources in a small part of a watershed.},

abstract={The State of Kansas has implemented a high-priority fecal-bacterial TMDL on Upper Wakarusa River (HUC 10270104010) watershed near Topeka, Kansas. This watershed drains a 942.8 km2 watershed, which is predominately rangeland, and has designated uses of aquatic life support, primary contact recreation, domestic water supply, food procurement and livestock watering. The TMDL process set a bacterial-load curve by multiplying stream flow values by the target fecal-bacteria concentration to derive a daily load-duration curve that shows the probability of exceedance vs. colonies of bacteria per day. Excursions from the water quality criterion are seen as points plotted above the daily load-duration curve. Streams at multiple locations within the watershed were monitored weekly during the growing season and monthly outside the growing season. On each date, stream flow and concentration of fecal bacteria (E. coli and fecal coliforms) were determined and bacterial source (human, livestock, urban pets, and wildlife) estimated using antibiotic resistance methods. Fecal bacteria data for the sampling site were categorized for each of three defined seasons (with characteristic flow conditions): Spring to Early-Summer (Apr-Jul), Late-Summer to fall (Aug-Oct) and winter (Nov-Mar). This presentation will present one year of stream sampling and antibiotic-resistance source-tracking data, and demonstrate methods being used to identify the source species and their locations within the watershed. Strategies for utilizing these data to target educational and cost-share efforts to achieve TMDL targets will be discussed.},

abstract={A repeated cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the patterns of antimicrobial resistance in 1,286 Escherichia coli strains isolated from human septage, wildlife, domestic animals, farm environments, and surface water in the Red Cedar watershed in Michigan. Isolation and identification of E. coli were done by using enrichment media, selective media, and biochemical tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing by the disk diffusion method was conducted for neomycin, gentamicin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, ofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, ampicillin, nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, cephalothin, and sulfisoxazole. Resistance to at least one antimicrobial agent was demonstrated in isolates from livestock, companion animals, human septage, wildlife, and surface water. In general, E. coli isolates from domestic species showed resistance to the largest number of antimicrobial agents compared to isolates from human septage, wildlife, and surface water. The agents to which resistance was demonstrated most frequently were tetracycline, cephalothin, sulfisoxazole, and streptomycin. There were similarities in the patterns of resistance in fecal samples and farm environment samples by animal, and the levels of cephalothin-resistant isolates were higher in farm environment samples than in fecal samples. Multidrug resistance was seen in a variety of sources, and the highest levels of multidrug-resistant E. coli were observed for swine fecal samples. The fact that water sample isolates were resistant only to cephalothin may suggest that the resistance patterns for farm environment samples may be more representative of the risk of contamination of surface waters with antimicrobial agent-resistant bacteria.

abstract={Thermotolerant fecal indicator organisms carried by migratory waterfowl may serve as reservoirs of antibiotic resistance. To determine the extent to which such antibiotic resistance markers were present in migratory Canada geese (Branta canadensis) on the Maryland Eastern Shore, we isolated Enterococcus spp. and Escherichia coli from fresh feces and examined the antibiotic resistance profiles of these bacteria. Samples were obtained in October 2002, January 2003, and March 2003. Thermotolerant E. coli counts ranged from 0 to 1.0×107 colony forming units (CFU)/0.1g (g-1) wet weight of feces, whereas Enterococcus spp. counts ranged from 1.0×102-1.0×107 CFU g-1 wet weight of feces. Primary isolates of each indicator organism were tested against a panel of 10 antibiotics. Greater than 95% of E. coli isolates were resistant to penicillin G, ampicillin, cephalothin, and sulfathiazole; no E. coli were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Enterococcal isolates showed highest resistance to cephalothin, streptomycin, and sulfathiazole; no enterococci were resistant to chloramphenicol. The tetracyclines, streptomycin, and gentamycin provided the greatest discrimination among E. coli isolates; chlortetracycline, cephalothin, and gentamycin resistance patterns provided the greatest discrimination between enterococcal strains. Multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) profiles were calculated: fall (E. coli = 0.499; enterococci = 0.234), winter (E. coli = 0.487; enterococci = 0.389), and spring (E. coli = 0.489; enterococci = 0.348). E. faecalis and E. faecium, which are recognized human nosocomial pathogens, were cultured from winter (44 and 56%, respectively) and spring (13 and 31%, respectively) fecal samples. © Wildlife Disease Association 2005.},

These along with an ECOSAR scan of all pharmaceuticals (n = 2848) were then classified according to the OECD aquatic toxicity classification system. The predicted species susceptibility is: daphnid > fish > algae, and the predicted rank order of relative toxicity: sex hormones > cardiovascular = antibiotics > antineoplastics (Table 1). Generally, a relatively large proportion (1/3) of all pharmaceuticals are potentially very toxic to aquatic organisms (Table 2). The qualitative risk assessment ranking relative to probability and potential severity for human and environmental health effects is: antibiotics > sex hormones > cardiovascular > antineoplastics. (Q)SARs and pharmacodynamic information should be used to prioritize and steer experimental risk assessments of pharmaceuticals, and potentially, also be used in new drug discovery optimizing efficacy and in minimising environmental hazards of new products. Nuclear receptors are relatively well conserved in evolution. Currently, antibacterial resistance represents the most significant human health hazard, and potentially the largest non-target organism hazard is sex hormones acting as endocrine modulators in wildlife.

abstract={Fecal pollution from nonhuman (pets, livestock or wildlife) and human sources is often one of the major factors associated with urbanization that contribute to the degradation of water quality. Methods to differentiate animal from human sources of fecal coliform contamination could assist resource managers in developing strategies to protect shellfish harvesting areas and recreational waters. In this study, surface water samples were collected from both a developed and an undeveloped watershed in coastal South Carolina. Influent and effluent samples from several wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the same area were also collected. Most Probable Numbers (MPNs) of fecal coliforms were determined for all samples. Escherichia coli isolates were analyzed for antibiotic resistance (AR) to 10 antibiotics. Then, AR indices (no. of resistant/total no. of antibiotics tested), were calculated for each isolate and site. Results indicated that MPNs from the WWTP samples were significantly higher than those from the developed watershed which were significantly higher than those from the undeveloped watershed (p<0.0001). The AR analyses suggested that there was a trend toward increased antibiotic resistance in samples for the urbanized Broad Creek (BC) watershed. In the Okatee River (OR), E. coli isolates from three sites (20%) showed resistance to a single antibiotic (penicillin) but in BC, isolates from seven sites (47%) were resistant to multiple antibiotics, and the predominant resistance pattern was chlortetracycline-oxytetracycline-tetracycline. Raw sewage isolates from most WWTPs contained E. coli that exhibited resistance to multiple antibiotics. Cluster analysis indicated that all resistant OR sites had antibiotic resistant isolates that matched AR patterns found in isolates from WWTPs. Similarly, six of the seven sites in BC had AR patterns that matched with resistance patterns in WWTPs. These results suggest that AR testing may be a useful tool for differentiating E. coli from human and wildlife sources. Further testing of bacterial isolates from known animal sources is necessary to better assess the utility of this approach.},

abstract={Sources of fecal pollution in the Blackwater River in south-central Virginia were identified. The study area encompassed intensive dairy and beef farming, abundant wildlife populations, homes with on-site septic systems, and four stream segments listed as impaired due to high-fecal coliform concentrations. A library of antibiotic resistance profiles was developed for 1,451 Enterococcus isolates from human, wildlife, and livestock. A discriminant analysis model was used to classify the isolates by source and calculate rates of correct classification (RCC) for each source. RCCs for the known source library were 82.3% for human, 86.2% for livestock, and 87.4% for wildlife. Profiles were determined for Enterococcus isolates from stream samples collected periodically from August 1999 to August 2001 (a total of 8,542 isolates) and compared against the known source library. Livestock contributed the highest percentage of isolates (47.6%) in the four segments studied, followed by wildlife (29.1%), and human (24.9%). The results indicate that reducing fecal pollution will require consideration of all three source categories. The results from this research are being used to develop total maximum daily load project allocations for fecal coliforms in the Blackwater River.},

abstract={Antibiotic resistance analysis (ARA) was used to determine if enterococci of human origin were present in a stream (Spout Run) that passes through a rural nonsewered community (Millwood, VA). Millwood consists of 82 homes, all served by individual septic systems, and Spout Run drains a 5800-ha karst topography watershed that contains large populations of livestock and wildlife. Periodic monitoring by state regulatory officials had resulted in Spout Run being placed on the Virginia impaired stream list and Millwood being categorized as an at-risk community. Stream samples were collected monthly and analyzed for fecal coliforms and enterococci (May 1999-May 2000); ARA was performed on enterococci stream isolates on a quarterly basis. All 117 stream samples were positive for fecal coliforms, and 32% exceeded the Virginia recreational water standard (1000 fecal coliforms/100 mL). A library of 1174 known source Enterococcus isolate antibiotic resistance profiles was constructed, and yielded correct classification rates of 94.6% for 203 human isolates, 93.7% for 734 livestock isolates, and 87.8% for 237 wildlife isolates. Antibiotic resistance analysis of 2012 enterococcal isolates recovered from stream samples indicated isolates of human origin appeared throughout the stream as it passed through Millwood, with a yearly average of approximately 10% human, 40% wildlife, and 50% livestock. There were no human origin isolates in samples collected upstream from Millwood, and the percent human origin isolates declined downstream from Millwood. While a human signature was found in Spout Run, it was small compared with the proportion of isolates from livestock and wildlife.},

abstract={Counts of Escherichia coli cells in water indicate the potential presence of pathogenic microbes of intestinal origin but give no indication of the sources of the microbial pollution. The objective of this research was to evaluate methods for differentiating E. coli isolates of livestock, wildlife, or human origin that might be used to predict the sources of fecal pollution of water. A collection of 319 E. coli isolates from the feces of cattle, poultry, swine, deer, goose, and moose, as well as from human sewage, and clinical samples was used to evaluate three methods. One method was the multiple-antibiotic-resistance (MAR) profile using 14 antibiotics. Discriminant analysis revealed that 46% of the livestock isolates, 95% of the wildlife isolates, and 55% of the human isolates were assigned to the correct source groups by the MAR method. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis, the second test, was applied to 105 of the E. coli isolates. The AFLP results showed that 94% of the livestock isolates, 97% of the wildlife isolates, and 97% of the human isolates were correctly classified. The third method was analysis of the sequences of thel6S rRNA genes of the E. coli isolates. Discriminant analysis of 105 E. coli isolates indicated that 78% of the livestock isolates, 74% of the wildlife isolates, and 80% of the human isolates could be correctly classified into their host groups by this method. The results indicate that AFLP analysis was the most effective of the three methods that were evaluated.},

abstract={Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium phagetype DT104 (DT104) is a multiple antibioticresistant pathogen. DT104 infections have been reported in a multitude of hosts including humans, companion animals, livestock and wildlife. Recently, several isolates of DT104 were recovered from veal calves exhibiting abomasitis, a finding that is inconsistent with classic salmonellosis. One of these isolates was used in murine ligated loop experiments where it was observed that multiresistant DT104 can elaborate a putative cytotoxin. Thus it appears that DT104 has the ability to evade pharmacologic interventions, via antibiotic resistance, and elaborate a toxin that can damage cells.},

abstract={The number of human visitors to Antarctica is increasing rapidly, and with it a risk of introducing infectious organisms to native animals. To study the occurrence of salmonella serotypes in sub-Antarctic wildlife, faecal samples were collected from gentoo penguins, macaroni penguins, gray-headed albatrosses, black-browed albatrosses and Antarctic fur seals on Bird Island in the South Georgian archipelago during the austral summer of 1996 and 1998. In 1996, S. havana, S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis were isolated from 7% of gentoo penguins and 4% of fur seals. In 1998, however, 22% of fur seals were found to be infected with S. havana, S. enteritidis and S. newport. All isolates, except one, showed identical pulsed-field gel electrophoresis-patterns within each serotype, irrespective of sampling year and animal reservoir. No significant antibiotic resistance was found. The very low heterogeneity in the salmonella isolates found could either indicate a high genetic adaptation of the bacteria to the environment or a recent introduction of salmonella into the area.},

abstract={Morbidity and mortality of captive wildlife at the Emperor Valley Zoo, Trinidad from 1993 to 1996 were analysed to determine involvement of Salmonella spp. A 6 mo longitudinal study was conducted to determine the frequency of isolation of Salmonella spp. from apparently healthy, sick and dead wild mammals, birds, and reptiles. The antibiograms of Salmonella isolates were determined using the disc diffusion method. Fecal samples randomly selected from animal enclosures and cloacal swabs of snakes were cultured for Salmonella spp. following enrichment in tetrathionate and selenite cystine broths. For the 1993-96 period, Salmonella spp. was implicated in 17 (12%) of 141 sick or dead animals and the predominant serotype was S. typhimurium. During the 6 mo prospective study in a mean animal population of 1,186, there were 20 (2%) and 14 (1%) animals that were sick and died respectively; Salmonella spp. was implicated in only one mortality. Overall, of 1,012 samples from apparently healthy wildlife cultured, 66 (7%) yielded 24 serotypes of Salmonella. The predominant serotype were S. seigburg (16 isolates), S. gaminara (6 isolates), and S. thompson (6 isolates). None of the samples yielded S. typhimuriurn. The frequency of isolation of Salmonella spp. in reptiles (14%) was significantly higher than found in either mammals (7%) or birds (3%). Sixty-five (99%) of 66 Salmonella spp. isolates exhibited resistance to one or more of the nine antimicrobial agents tested. Resistance was high to cephalothin (92%), moderate to streptomycin (35%) and tetracycline (29%), but significantly low to gentamicin (2%), chloramphenicol (0%), and sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (0%). The prevalence of asymptomatic infections by Salmonella spp. in zoo animals was high and the very high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance could be a problem when treating salmonellosis.},

abstract={Nonpoint sources of pollution that contribute fecal bacteria to surface waters have proven difficult to identify. Knowledge of pollution sources could aid in restoration of the water quality, reduce the amounts of nutrients leaving watersheds, and reduce the danger of infectious disease resulting from exposure to contaminated waters. Patterns of antibiotic resistance in fecal streptococci were analyzed by discriminant and cluster analysis and used to identify sources of fecal pollution in a rural Virginia watershed. A database consisting of patterns from 7,058 fecal streptococcus isolates was first established from known human, livestock, and wildlife sources in Montgomery County, Va. Correct fecal streptococcus source identification averaged 87% for the entire database and ranged from 84% for deer isolates to 93% for human isolates. To field test the method and the database, a watershed improvement project (Page Brook) in Clarke County, Va., was initiated in 1996. Comparison of 892 known-source isolates from that watershed against the database resulted in an average correct classification rate of 88%. Combining all animal isolates increased correct classification rates to ≥95% for separations between animal and human sources. Stream samples from three collection sites were highly contaminated, and fecal streptococci from these sites were classified as being predominantly from cattle (>78% of isolates), with small proportions from waterfowl, deer, and unidentified sources (≃7% each). Based on these results, cattle access to the stream was restricted by installation of fencing and in-pasture watering stations. Fecal coliforms were reduced at the three sites by an average of 94%, from prefencing average populations of 15,900 per 100 ml to postfencing average populations of 960 per 100 ml. After fencing, <45% of fecal streptococcus isolates were classified as being from cattle. These results demonstrate that antibiotic resistance profiles in fecal streptococci can be used to reliably determine sources of fecal pollution, and water quality improvements can occur when efforts to address the identified sources are made.},

abstract={Antibiograms of Escherichia coli isolates from free-ranging and captive wildlife (mammals, avian and reptiles) were determined using the disc diffusion method; the prevalence of enteropathogenic serogroups amongst isolates was also investigated. Out of a total of 472 isolates of E. coli tested using 8 antimicrobial agents, 451 (95.6%) exhibited resistance to one or more antimicrobial agents. Resistance was high to cephalothin (88.1%), moderate to ampicillin (34.3%), streptomycin (33.7%) and neomycin (22.1%) and relatively low to chloramphenicol (7.8%) and gentamycin (6.8%), regardless of source. Prevalence of resistance amongst E. coli isolates from captive mammals was statistically significantly (P&lt;0.0; χ2) higher than for isolates from free-ranging mammals to streptomycin, sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SXT), and chloramphenicol. However, the prevalence of resistance amongst E. coli isolates from free-ranging mammals, was significantly (P&lt;0.05; χ2) higher than those from captive mammals for ampicillin and cephalothin. Eshierichia coli isolates from racing pigeons were statistically significantly (P&lt;0.01; χ2) and more resistant than isolates from wild birds for ampicillin, streptomycin, nalidixic acid, sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim and chloramphenicol. Prevalence of resistance amongst E. coli isolates from captive birds were, however, statistically significantly (P&lt;0.05; χ2) lower than those of isolates from wild birds for ampicillin, neomycin and gentamicin. Amongst 200 randomly selected E. coli isolates tested, 46 (23.0%) belong to enteropathogenic serogroups, with 22 (11.0%), 21 (10.5%) and 3 (1.5%) agglutinated by E. coli polyvalent antiserum serogroups A, B and C, respectively. The prevalence of enteropathogenic serogroups amongst E. coli isolates from free-ranging mammals (20.4%) was statistically significantly (P&lt;0.05; χ2) lower than those found in isolates from captive mammals (48.0%). Similarly, E. coli isolates from wild birds had a statistically significantly (P&lt;0.05; χ2) higher (50%) frequency of enteropathogenic serogroups than isolates from either racing pigeons (7.4%) or captive birds (12.5%). It was concluded that the high prevalence of resistance to antimicrobial agents amongst. E. coli isolates poses potential therapeutic problems to captive wildlife, while the occurrence of enteropathogenic serogroups amongst isolates could pose a health hazard to consumers of wildlife meat.},
