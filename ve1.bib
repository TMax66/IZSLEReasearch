Abstract = {{Vespa velutina Lepeletier, 1836 (Hymenoptera: Vespidae), the
   yellow-legged hornet, is a social wasp native to North of India, China
   and tropical and subtropical areas of Southeast Asia. Adults are
   predators of a wide variety of arthropods, including honey bees. Vespa
   velutina has been unintentionally introduced in southwestern France
   before 2004 and its widely spreading across the country was followed by
   an impressive colonization of several areas within mainland Europe and
   overseas. In Italy, V. velutina has been officially reported in June
   2013 in Imperia province, Liguria region (northern Italy) and is now
   well established in the western part of this region and occasionally
   reported in Piedmont region. More recently, it has been spotted in
   Veneto, Lombardy and Tuscany regions. In order to investigate the
   phylogenetic relationships and the origin of Italian V. velutina
   nigrithorax specimens, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of
   thirty-three samples, collected in 2012, 2016, 2017 and 2018 from
   different sites (Veneto, Piedmont and Liguria regions) based on
   mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene sequence
   analysis. The phylogenetic analysis as well the haplotypes study
   confirmed the placement of 33 Italian specimens within a cluster
   containing the other European samples plus Chinese specimens collected
   in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Our results strongly supported the view that
   the Italian specimens of V. velutina nigrithorax derived from the
   spreading southward of the V. velutina nigrithorax population initially
   established in France, which is also moving northward (Belgium, The
   Netherlands, Germany, United Kingdom). Graphic abstract}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated which information sources Italian consumers use
   most frequently when they have a question about food safety in order to
   obtain useful insights to inform food risk communication. In 2011, a
   national survey was conducted targeting Italian people responsible for
   purchasing and preparing food for their households. Respondents' choices
   of information sources on food safety were correlated with their
   socio-demographic and behavioural characteristics, their levels of
   objective knowledge, their levels of trust towards some authorities and
   their levels of self-perception regarding risk exposure. Our data
   analysis identified those information channels that are most likely to
   reach Italians actively seeking information. Mass media
   (radio/television/newspapers) were the most frequently used information
   source, followed by the Internet. Age, educational qualification,
   employment status, geographical area, family status and objective
   knowledge were the variables that influenced the choice for information
   sources used by the Italian population. The frequency of buying food
   products, the frequency of eating put and the frequency of cooking also
   showed a dependency relation. The profiles of those who actively seek
   information were also outlined. Among these, the Mass media users' and
   the Internet users' profiles were further analysed. Results show that
   Italian consumers do actively seek information about food safety,
   revealing that food safety continues to be a concern for the Italian
   consumers. Their interest in this topic represents an opportunity for
   public health authorities to address an audience of receptive consumers.
   Such information will be valuable in the design of targeted
   communication campaigns to increase consumers' knowledge and awareness
   of food safety issues and will help authorities to choose the most
   effective channels through which to deliver key messages.}},

Abstract = {{Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a mycotoxin mainly produced by Fusarium

   Urinary DON levels can be used as biomarker for exposure assessment
   purposes. This study assessed urinary DON concentrations in Italian

   and the elderly. In addition, vulnerable groups, namely vegetarians and
   pregnant women, were included in the study. To determine the urinary
   DON, its glucuronide and de-epoxydated (DOM-1) forms, an indirect
   analytical approach was used, measuring free DON and total DON (as sum
   of free and glucuronides forms), before and after enzymatic treatment,
   respectively. Morning urine samples were collected on two consecutive
   days, from six different population groups, namely children, adolescent,
   adults, elderly, vegetarians and pregnant women. Total DON was measured
   in the 76\% of the collected samples with the maximum incidences in
   children and adolescent age group. Urine samples from children and
   adolescent also showed the highest total DON levels, up to 17.0
   ng/mg(creat). Pregnant women had the lowest positive samples per
   category (40\% for day 1 and 43\% for day 2, respectively), low mean
   levels of total DON (down to 2.84 ng/mg(creat)) and median equal to 0
   ng/mg(creat). Estimation of DON dietary intake reveals that 7.5\% of the
   total population exceeds the TDI of 1 mu g/kg bw/day set for DON, with
   children showing 40\% of individuals surpassing this value (male, day

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In Northern Italy, a hastening of hare population decline was noticeable
   from 2008. In the same year hunters reported a sudden increase of hares
   infected by Taenia sp. larvae, whose morphology was consistent with T.
   pisiformis cysticerci. The aim of the survey was: i)to identify the
   parasites through morphological features and molecular techniques; ii)to
   quantify the prevalence and abundance of cysticerci in hunted hares;
   iii)to describe pathological aspects of parasite-induced lesions; iv)to
   evaluate the short-term trend of the infection comparing two different
   hunting seasons; v)to highlight possible relationship between T.
   pisiformis infection and hare-related variables.
   In 2013, 2015 the viscera of 54 and 61 hares legally hunted in
   agro-ecosystems of the Po Plain were collected.
   Peritoneum, liver and lungs were examined for cysticercosis; abundance
   was estimated counting superficial parasites in liver; parasites were
   microscopically identified by shape and measure of both large and small
   hooks. One cysticercus from each hare was analized by a PCR targeting
   Taeniid species and then sequenced. Frozen liver, lungs and
   gastrointestinal peritoneum were macroscopically observed and, after
   thawing, representative samples from the available organs were collected
   for histologic examination to verify parasitic cysts and the subsequent
   damage of the involved organs. Sex, weight and age class of the animals
   were recorded. Generalized linear models were used for statistical
   analysis.
   T. pisiformis was isolated in 8 hares in 2013 (prevalence 14.8\%;
   abundance range: 0-400; mean abundance 17.8) and in 2 hares in 2015
   (prevalence 3.28\%; abundance range: 0-180; mean abundance 3.22).
   Identification was confirmed morphologically and by PCR. The DNA
   sequencing confirmed T. pisiformis in all samples. The sequences were
   all identical each-other. Infection was significantly related with adult
   age class, sampling year and low full-weight.
   Epidemiological and pathological pattern suggest both a possible role on
   host population health and a tendency toward host-parasite equilibrium.}},

Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundAdenosine deaminase enzymes of the ADAR family are conserved
   in metazoans. They convert adenine into inosine in dsRNAs and thus alter
   both structural properties and the coding potential of their substrates.
   Acting on exogenous dsRNAs, ADAR1 exerts a pro- or anti-viral role in
   vertebrates and Drosophila.ResultsWe traced 4 ADAR homologs in 14
   lophotrochozoan genomes and we classified them into ADAD, ADAR1 or
   ADAR2, based on phylogenetic and structural analyses of the enzymatic
   domain. Using RNA-seq and quantitative real time PCR we demonstrated the
   upregulation of one ADAR1 homolog in the bivalve Crassostrea gigas and
   in the gastropod Haliotis diversicolor supertexta during Ostreid
   herpesvirus-1 or Haliotid herpesvirus-1 infection. Accordingly, we
   demonstrated an extensive ADAR-mediated editing of viral RNAs. Single
   nucleotide variation (SNV) profiles obtained by pairing RNA- and DNA-seq
   data from the viral infected individuals resulted to be mostly
   compatible with ADAR-mediated A-to-I editing (up to 97\%). SNVs occurred
   at low frequency in genomic hotspots, denoted by the overlapping of
   viral genes encoded on opposite DNA strands. The SNV sites and their
   upstream neighbor nucleotide indicated the targeting of selected
   adenosines. The analysis of viral sequences suggested that, under the
   pressure of the ADAR editing, the two Malacoherpesviridae genomes have
   evolved to reduce the number of deamination targets.ConclusionsWe
   report, for the first time, evidence of an extensive editing of
   Malacoherpesviridae RNAs attributable to host ADAR1 enzymes. The
   analysis of base neighbor preferences, structural features and
   expression profiles of molluscan ADAR1 supports the conservation of the
   enzyme function among metazoans and further suggested that ADAR1 exerts
   an antiviral role in mollusks.}},

   between Aureobasidium pullulans and A. melanogenum to explain the
   observed differences in frequency in infection. Degrees of melanisation
   and thermotolerance were measured, and virulence of strains from
   different sources was examined in Galleria mellonela and murine
   infection models. Aureobasidium melanogenum responds with increased
   melanisation to temperature stress and generally survives at 37 degrees
   C, A. pullulans on average scored less on these parameters. In the
   murine model, differences between species were not significant, but the
   melanised A. melanogenum group showed the highest virulence. This result
   was not reproducible in Galleria mellonella larvae at 25 degrees C. The
   A. melanogenum black group showed higher pathogenicity in murine model,
   indicating that the combination of melanisation and thermotolerance
   rather than species affiliation is instrumental. Galleria larvae did not

Abstract = {{The increasing number of exotic arbovirus cases imported in Europe and
   the 2017 chikungunya outbreak in central/southern Italy highlight the
   urgency of evidence-based outbreak management plans to predict, prevent
   or interrupt spreading of these arboviruses to non-endemic countries in
   temperate regions. We here present the results of three
   mark-release-recapture experiments conducted in a peri-urban area of
   North-East Italy to estimate the spatio-temporal dynamics of the
   dispersal of Aedes albopictus females looking for oviposition sites. The
   Flight Range of 90\% of the mosquito population (FR90) was found to
   exceed 200 m, consistently with data obtained from a previous study
   conducted in a highly urbanised area in Rome (Central Italy). Modelling
   results showed that dispersal can be so rapid that insecticide spraying
   within a 200m-radius around a potential infected case leaves >10\%
   probability that a potentially infected mosquito escapes the treatment,
   even if this is carried out after only 2-3 days since the importation of
   a viremic case. These data provide evidence in favour of an update of
   guidelines for the control of exotic autochthonous arbovirus
   transmission in temperate areas and highlight the need of effective
   surveillance approaches and rapid response to contain the risks

Abstract = {{Several studies based on histopathology or molecular investigations

   data on distribution of viral DNA for different F. catus papillomavirus
   types (FcaPV-1, 2, 3, 4, 5) in precancerous skin lesions are lacking. In
   this study, incisional and excisional skin biopsies from 18 cats with
   BISC were investigated for the presence of FcaPV DNA by quantitative
   polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and chromogenic in situ hybridization
   (CISH) using specific probes to detect each of the FcaPVs that have been
   identified so far. By qPCR analysis, 15 of 18 samples were positive for
   FcaPV-2, 2 were positive for FcaPV-4, and 1 sample was negative for all
   FcaPVs studied. Two cases were positive for FcaPV-5 by qPCR only.
   FcaPV-1 and FcaPV-3 were not detected by either method. CISH positivity
   for FcaPV-2 and FcaPV-4 was 100\% concordant with qPCR. FcaPV-2 CISH
   signal was observed as nuclear dots within grouped neoplastic
   keratinocytes in 12 BISCs and in the perilesional skin of 9 biopsies. In
   3 of these 9 cases, the signal was not observed within the BISC. FcaPV-4
   CISH positivity was detected only within BISCs in 2 cases. The overall
   rate of concordance for FcaPV detection between PCR and CISH was 97.8\%.
   This study suggests that CISH is a reliable method to detect FcaPV-2 and
   FcaPV-4 infection in cats and provides useful information on the type,

Abstract = {{Aphanomyces astaci causes crayfish plague, which is a devastating
   disease of European freshwater crayfish. The likely first introduction
   of A. astaci into Europe was in the mid-19th century in Italy,
   presumably with the introduction of North American crayfish. These
   crayfish can carry A. astaci in their cuticle as a benign infection.
   Aphanomyces astaci rapidly spread across Europe causing the decline of
   the highly susceptible indigenous crayfish species. Random amplified
   polymorphic DNA-PCR analysis of A. astaci pure cultures characterized
   five genotype groups (A, B, C, D and E). Current A. astaci genotyping
   techniques (microsatellites and genotype-specific regions, both
   targeting nuclear DNA) can be applied directly to DNA extracted from

Abstract = {{In recent years, the role of Listeria monocytogenes as a foodborne
   pathogen in public health has increased. Its presence poses a risk for
   humans, especially in ready-to-eat foods, such as ham. Understanding the
   presence and distribution of Listeria spp. on swine carcasses meant for
   Italian dry-cured hams can be a useful tool to improve food safety. This
   study assessed the distribution of Listeria spp. (as a marker of
   contamination with L. monocytogenes) on slaughtered pig carcasses
   intended for the production of high-quality, Italian, dry-cured ham and
   examined the roles of the site sampled on the carcass, farming cycle
   (open versus closed), farm-to-slaughterhouse distance, and time spent in
   lairage. Samples were collected from swine carcasses (n = 150) before
   refrigeration, from three different carcass locations (head, shoulder,
   and thigh), and assessed for the presence of listeriae. A total of 115
   carcasses were contaminated with Listeria spp. in at least one location.
   In all, 178 listeriae were isolated and identified: 130 Listeria
   innocua, 28 Listeria welshimeri, 17 Listeria ivanovii, and 3 L.
   monocytogenes. Listeriae were detected on 62.7\% of heads, on 25.3\% of
   shoulders, and on 30.7\% of thighs, with significant differences between
   heads versus shoulders and thighs. Animals reared in closed-cycle farms
   were more contaminated (P, 0.05) than were animals from opencycle farms
   (90 versus 71.8\%). The distance between farms and slaughterhouse was
   not related to the contamination rate. Carcasses of swine that stayed in
   lairage before slaughtering for more than 10 h showed a higher degree of
   contamination (90\%) and were positive for Listeria spp. in more sample
   sites (55\%) compared with those held for less than 2 h (73\% of
   carcasses and 33.3\% of samples). Our results show that heads should be
   detached from carcasses immediately after slaughter for meat-safety
   purposes and the amount of time animals stay in lairage should be
   limited. These results will be useful for a more-valid implementation of
   good manufacturing processes for slaughtering.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an emerging zoonosis caused by a positive RNA
   single stranded virus of the Hepeviridae family. In developed countries,
   pigs and wild boars are the main reservoir for zoonotic genotypes 3 and
   4. In spring 2017, for the first time HEV was detected in wild boars
   captured in the Regional Park of the Euganean Hills, in north-eastern
   Italy. Phylogenetic analysis of two complete viral genomes and seven
   partial ORF1 and ORF2 sequences of HEV viruses, selected from twelve
   positive animals, showed that the viruses grouped together within
   genotype 3 but clustered separately from previously identified subtypes,
   thus suggesting the identification of a novel genotype 3 subtype. The
   phylogenetic analysis of nine partial ORF2 sequences showed the closest
   similarity with wild boar/human viruses identified in central-northern
   Italy in 2012. The circulation of HEVs in this area, characterized by a
   vast man-made environment, an overpopulation of wild boars and > 150
   swine farms, should be considered in a public health perspective.
   Further investigations at the wild/domestic species and human interface
   are therefore necessary to gain a deeper understanding of HEV dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Between November 2017 and February 2018, Ghanaian poultry producers
   reported to animal health authorities a dramatic increase in mortality
   rate and a relevant drop in egg production in several layer hen farms.
   Laboratory investigations revealed that the farms had been infected by
   the H9N2 influenza subtype. Virological and molecular characterization
   of the viruses identified in Ghana is described here for the first time.
   Whole genome analysis showed that the viruses belong to the G1-lineage
   and cluster with viruses identified in North and West Africa. The low
   pathogenicity of the virus was confirmed by the intravenous
   pathogenicity index assay. Further investigations revealed co-infection
   with infectious bronchitis virus of the GI-19 lineage, which very likely
   explained the severity of the disease observed during the outbreaks. The
   H9N2 outbreaks in Ghana highlight the importance of performing a
   differential diagnosis and an in-depth characterization of emerging
   viruses. In addition, the detection of a potentially zoonotic subtype,
   such as the H9N2, in a region where highly pathogenic avian influenza
   H5Nx is currently circulating highlights the urgency of implementing
   enhanced monitoring strategies and supporting improved investments in
   regional diagnostic technologies.}},

Title = {{A Longitudinal Case Study on Dissemination of ST398
   Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Within a Dairy Cow Herd}},
Journal = {{FOODBORNE PATHOGENS AND DISEASE}},
Abstract = {{The study was conducted to describe the dynamics of ST398
   methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) on a dairy herd in
   northeastern Italy. MRSA was first identified in this herd of 120 cows
   in 2016, after which the herd was sampled once every 3 months for 1 year
   (April 2016-May 2017). Samples collected included nasal swabs and milk
   samples from cows and nasal swabs from farmworkers. In addition, pen
   fencing and teat milk liners were swabbed and air samples from cow pens
   and the milking parlor were collected. All samples were tested for MRSA
   using a selective medium; positive isolates were confirmed by mecA PCR.
   A representative set of MRSA isolates was genotyped using spa typing and
   multilocus sequence typing. Overall, 34 (mean 23\%, range 16-30\%)
   milking cows were found harboring MRSA in the mammary gland and only 6
   recovered from infection or colonization. The mean incidence rate was
   14\% (range 8-20\%), mean cure rate was 23\% (range 13-43\%), and
   estimated basic reproduction number (R-0) was 1.08. The average of
   positive quarters found was 35.1\% and most of the positive quarters
   (82.4\%) developed subclinical mastitis. The mean duration of MRSA
   colonization in quarters during the study was 247 days, but quarters
   affected by subclinical mastitis harbored MRSA for a longer time than
   healthy ones (285 days vs. 131 days). After the second sampling, the
   farmer segregated MRSA-positive cows from the uninfected cows and milked
   them last. Despite segregation, 25 newly infected or colonized cows were
   detected. MRSA isolates from cows, environment, and two farmworkers
   belonged to the same sequence type (ST398) and spa type (t034). This
   study highlights the ability of ST398 MRSA to cause a persistent
   infection of the mammary gland and to survive in the farm environment.}},

Abstract = {{Clostridium difficile is a major cause of infectious diarrhea associated
   to healthcare settings. Community-acquired infections are increasingly
   reported in the last decade and exposure other than to symptomatic
   patients rather to contaminated foods or animals is feasible. Occurrence
   of C. difficile in shellfish raises concern because spores can survive
   the cooking temperatures given that shellfish is often consumed poorly
   cooked or raw. Aim of our study was to investigate whether shellfish
   represents a reservoir of C. difficile human PCR-ribotypes (RTs). 702
   shellfish samples of farmed and wild bivalve mollusc species were
   collected over the 2015-2017 period in North Adriatic Italian Sea to
   investigate contamination with C. difficile and characterize the
   isolates in terms of genotypic variability and antimicrobial resistance
   profile. C. difficile was detected in 16.9\% (CI: 14.1\%-19.8\%)
   samples: 11.6\% mussels and 23.2\% clams. Compared to mussels, clams
   were significantly associated with detection of C. difficile (OR = 2.4,
   P < 0.01). Overall 113 C. difficile isolates were genotyped and 75
   (66.4\%) were toxigenic. Fifty-three different RTs were identified.
   40.7\% C. difficile isolates were among the RTs most commonly involved
   in human infection in Europe. The profile of antimicrobial
   susceptibility was determined by E-test; microbiological resistance was
   frequent against clindamycin (17\%), erythromycin (23\%), rifampicin
   (8.8\%) and moxifloxacin (10.6\%). All isolates were susceptible to
   metronidazole and one showed MIC > ECOFF for vancomycin. C. difficile
   strains showed high variety in RTs, most of them already detected in
   other animals or known as highly virulent and epidemic in humans. These
   results prompt towards investigating on specific risk mitigation
   measures against C. difficile and are preliminary for any source

   Salmonella spp. and quantification of Escherichia coli in water and fish
   were investigated using standard bacteriological methods. Antimicrobial
   resistance was determined using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
   method. A total of 352 samples were analysed including Nile perch, lake
   water and swabs from surfaces of facilities used for fish
   transportation. A total of 10 different Salmonella serovars were
   isolated. Salmonella enterica subsp. salamae with antigenic formula
   42:r:- had a prevalence of 10.0\% (n = 60) in Nile perch from fishing
   grounds which were significant different (P < 0.05) to the prevalence of
   this serovar at landing sites and domestic markets 1.7\% (n = 60 each).
   The prevalence of Salmonella Waycross (41:z4, z23:-) in Nile perch from
   fishing grounds was 18.3\% (n = 60) with no significant difference (P >
   0.05) compared to the ones at landing sites 10\% (n = 60) and markets
   13.3\% (n = 60). The prevalence of S. enterica subsp. salamae 42:r:- in
   water from fishing grounds was 6.7\% (n = 60). Two out of 12 S. enterica
   subsp. salamae 42:r:- were resistant to sulfamethoxazole, while one was
   resistance to azithromycin. S. Waycross were resistant to
   sulfamethoxazole (6/30), azithromycin (6/30) and ampicillin (4/30).
   Seven S. Waycross carried plasmids, but none of S. enterica subsp.
   salamae 42:r:- carried plasmids. E. coli mean counts were 2.51 log cfu/g
   in fish intestines, 2.38 log cfu/g in gills, and 2.02 log cfu/ml in
   water. The frequent findings of S. enterica subsp. salamae 42:r:- and S.
   Waycross in Nile perch are surprising as these serovars are rarely
   associated with human diseases. Follow-up studies of their ecology in
   Nile perch and Lake Victoria are needed.}},

Abstract = {{This short article presents loss rates of honey bee colonies over winter
   2017/18 from 36 countries, including 33 in Europe, from data collected
   using the standardized COLOSS questionnaire. The 25,363 beekeepers
   supplying data passing consistency checks in total wintered 544,879
   colonies, and reported 26,379 (4.8\%, 95\% CI 4.7-5.0\%) colonies with
   unsolvable queen problems, 54,525 (10.0\%, 95\% CI 9.8-10.2\%) dead
   colonies after winter and another 8,220 colonies (1.5\%, 95\% CI
   1.4-1.6\%) lost through natural disaster. This gave an overall loss rate
   of 16.4\% (95\% CI 16.1-16.6\%) of honey bee colonies during winter
   2017/18, but this varied greatly from 2.0 to 32.8\% between countries.
   The included map shows relative risks of winter loss at regional level.
   The analysis using the total data-set confirmed findings from earlier
   surveys that smaller beekeeping operations with at most 50 colonies
   suffer significantly higher losses than larger operations (p < .001).
   Beekeepers migrating their colonies had significantly lower losses than
   those not migrating (p < .001), a different finding from previous
   research. Evaluation of six different forage sources as potential risk
   factors for colony loss indicated that intensive foraging on any of five
   of these plant sources (Orchards, Oilseed Rape, Maize, Heather and
   Autumn Forage Crops) was associated with significantly higher winter
   losses. This finding requires further study and explanation. A table is
   included giving detailed results of loss rates and the impact of the
   tested forage sources for each country and overall.}},

Abstract = {{Escherichia coli causes a significant number of clinical mastitis cases

   is important for both human and animal health. Surveillance reports
   recorded that the efficacy of most antibiotics is substantially
   preserved but detection of E. coli from clinical mastitis cases
   producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and plasmid-encoded AmpC
   beta-lactamases has been reported. These resistance determinants have
   frequently been associated with multidrug resistance. The aim of this
   study was to determine if a MacConkey agar medium supplemented with 8
   mg/L of ceftiofur (MC-CEF) could be a useful tool to identify
   cephalosporin-resistant and multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. coli among
   bovine mastitis isolates. During the period 2010-2011, 773 E. coli were
   isolated from bovine clinical mastitis milk samples collected in 80
   dairy farms in Northern Italy. A total of 105 E. coli were selected and
   assigned either to group randomly selected E. coli (RSEC; n = 53), based
   on a random selection among the whole collection of 773 E. coli, or to
   group ceftiofur-resistant E. coli (CEFREC; n = 52). CEFREC isolates were
   identified by spreading the 773 E. coli isolates on MC-CEF. Minimum
   inhibitory concentration (MIC) was used to test the phenotypic
   antimicrobial susceptibility to 16 antibiotics. The MIC results
   confirmed the ceftiofur resistance in 73.1\% (38/52) of CEFREC isolates,
   whereas all RSEC isolates were susceptible to ceftiofur. The comparison
   of MIC values for each antibiotic tested between the two groups revealed
   significantly higher frequencies of resistance to antimicrobials other
   than ceftiofur in the CEFREC group. Resistance profiles highlighted a
   significantly higher frequency of MDR isolates among CEFREC (73.1\%)
   than RSEC (17\%) E. coli. The results showed that MC-CEF may be a useful
   selective medium to identify cephalosporin-resistant and MDR E. coli on
   dairy farms, without performing MIC on all the isolates.}},

Abstract = {{Since late `80 s Avian metapneumovirus subtype A causes sufficient
   disease in Europe for commercial companies to have started developing

   Sequences comparison shows that the attenuation of field strain \#8544
   was associated with no common substitutions between the two derived
   vaccines. This finding suggests that the attenuation of field viruses
   via serial passage on cell cultures or tissues is the result of a random
   process, rather than a mechanism aiming to achieve a specific sequence.
   Furthermore, field vaccination strategies would greatly benefit by the
   unambiguous vaccine markers identified in this study, enabling a prompt

Title = {{Jet-Setting Koalas Spread Cryptococcus gattii VGII in Australia}},
Journal = {{MSPHERE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Cryptococcus gattii molecular type VGII is one of the etiologic agents
   of cryptococcosis, a systemic mycosis affecting a wide range of host
   species. Koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) exhibit a comparatively high
   prevalence of cryptococcosis (clinical and subclinical) and nasal
   colonization, particularly in captivity. In Australia, disease
   associated with C. gattii VGII is typically confined to Western
   Australia and the Northern Territory (with sporadic cases reported in
   eastern Australia), occupying an enigmatic ecologic niche. A cluster of
   cryptococcosis in captive koalas in eastern Australia (five confirmed
   cases, a further two suspected), caused predominantly by C. gattii VGII,
   was investigated by surveying for subclinical disease, culturing koala
   nasal swabs and environmental samples, and genotyping cryptococcal
   isolates. URA5 restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis,
   multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and whole-genome sequencing (WGS)
   provided supportive evidence that the transfer of koalas from Western
   Australia and subsequently between several facilities in Queensland
   spread VGII into uncontaminated environments and environments in which
   C. gattii VGI was endemic. MLST identified VGII isolates as
   predominantly sequence type 7, while WGS further confirmed a limited
   genomic diversity and revealed a basal relationship with isolates from
   Western Australia. We hypothesize that this represents a founder effect
   following the introduction of a koala from Western Australia. Our
   findings suggest a possible competitive advantage for C. gattii VGII
   over VGI in the context of this captive koala environment. The ability
   of koalas to seed C. gattii VGII into new environments has implications
   for the management of captive populations and movements of koalas
   between zoos.
   IMPORTANCE Cryptococcus gattii molecular type VGII is one of the causes
   of cryptococcosis, a severe fungal disease that is acquired from the
   environment and affects many host species (including humans and koalas).
   In Australia, disease caused by C. gattii VGII is largely confined to
   western and central northern parts of the country, with sporadic cases
   reported in eastern Australia. We investigated an unusual case cluster
   of cryptococcosis, caused predominantly by C. gattii VGII, in a group of
   captive koalas in eastern Australia. This research identified that the
   movements of koalas between wildlife parks, including an initial
   transfer of a koala from Western Australia, introduced and subsequently
   spread C. gattii VGII in this captive environment. The spread of this
   pathogen by koalas could also impact other species, and these findings
   are significant in the implications they have for the management of
   koala transfers and captive environments.}},

Abstract = {{Illegal use of growth promoter compounds in food production exposes
   consumers to health risk. Surveillance of such practices is based on
   direct detection of drugs or related metabolites by HPLC-MS/MS.
   Screening strategies focusing on indirect biological responses are
   considered promising tools to improve surveillance. In this study, an
   untargeted shotgun proteomics approach based on tandem mass tags (TMTs)
   is carried out to identify proteins altered in bovine liver after
   different anabolic treatments. Three controlled pharmacological
   treatments with dexamethasone, a combination of dexamethasone and
   clenbuterol, or a combination of sexual steroids (trenbolone and
   estradiol) are analyzed. Untargeted TMT analysis of liver digests by
   high resolution MS allowed for the relative quantification of proteins.
   Thanks to partial least squarediscriminant analysis, a set of proteins
   capable to classify animals treated with dexamethasone alone (11
   proteins), or in combination with clenbuterol (13 proteins) are
   identified. No significant difference is found upon administration of
   sexual steroids. After relative quantification of candidate markers by
   parallel reaction monitoring (PRM), two predictive models are trained to
   validate protein markers. Finally, an independent animal set of control
   bulls and bulls treated with dexamethasone is analyzed by PRM to further
   validate a predictive model giving an accuracy of 100\%.}},

Abstract = {{Small hive beetles (SHBs) are parasites of social bee colonies endemic
   to sub-Saharan Africa and have become a widespread invasive species. In
   the new ranges, SHBs can cause damage to apiculture and wild bees.
   Although the further spread seems inevitable, eradication of new
   introductions and containment of established ones are nevertheless
   urgently required to slow down the invasion speed until better
   mitigation options are available. However, at present there is no
   adequate action plan at hand. Here, we propose to take advantage of SHB
   invasion history and biology to enrol a feasible plan involving all
   stakeholders. Raising awareness, education and motivation of
   stakeholders (incl. adequate and timely compensation of beekeepers) is
   essential for success. Moreover, sentinel apiaries are recommended in
   areas at risk, because early detection is crucial for the success of
   eradication efforts. Given that introductions are detected early, SHB
   eradication is recommended, incl. destruction of all infested apiaries,
   installation of sentinel colonies to lure escaped SHBs and a ban on
   migratory beekeeping. If wild perennial social bee colonies are
   infested, eradication programs are condemned to fail and a strategic
   switch to a containment strategy is recommended. Containment includes
   adequate integrated pest management and a strict ban on migratory
   beekeeping. Despite considerable gaps in our knowledge of SHBs, the
   proposed action plan will help stakeholders to slow down the global
   spread of SHBs.}},

Abstract = {{The cellular prion protein (PrPC), whose misfolded conformers are
   implicated in prion diseases, localizes to both the presynaptic membrane
   and postsynaptic density. To explore possible molecular contributions of
   PrPC to synaptic transmission, we utilized a mass spectrometry approach
   to quantify the release of glutamate from primary cerebellar granule
   neurons (CGN) expressing, or deprived of (PrP-KO), PrPC, following a
   depolarizing stimulus. Under the same conditions, we also tracked
   recycling of synaptic vesicles (SVs) in the two neuronal populations. We
   found that in PrP-KO CGN these processes decreased by 40 and 60\%,
   respectively, compared to PrPC-expressing neurons. Unbiased quantitative
   mass spectrometry was then employed to compare the whole proteome of CGN
   with the two PrP genotypes. This approach allowed us to assess that,
   relative to the PrPC-expressing counterpart, the absence of PrPC
   modified the protein expression profile, including diminution of some
   components of SV recycling and fusion machinery. Subsequent quantitative
   RT-PCR closely reproduced proteomic data, indicating that PrPC is
   committed to ensuring optimal synaptic transmission by regulating genes
   involved in SV dynamics and neurotransmitter release. These novel
   molecular and cellular aspects of PrPC add insight into the underlying
   mechanisms for synaptic dysfunctions occurring in neurodegenerative
   disorders in which a compromised PrPC is likely to intervene.}},

   antimicrobial resistance, Multiple-Locus Variable-number tandem-repeat
   Analysis (MLVA) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). All isolates
   demonstrated the same multidrug resistant genotype (ASSuT isolates),

Abstract = {{In 2016-2017, the H5N8 strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza
   (HPAI) spread worldwide and Uganda reported the first occurrence of the
   disease in its poultry and wild birds. Genetic analysis revealed that
   the virus clusters with 2.3.4.4 group B strains from birds in central
   and southern Asia, and thus forms part of the 2.3.4.4 group B Glade.
   Since Uganda is in the path of two major migratory bird flyways, it is
   likely that infected migratory wild birds played a crucial role in the
   introduction of H5N8 HPAI viruses into Uganda. The outbreaks happened in
   the districts of Wakiso, Masaka and Kalangala and affected domestic and
   wild birds. A One Health Multisectoral Coordination Committee,
   consisting of a National Task Force, Technical Working Groups and
   District Disaster Management Committees, was immediately activated to
   coordinate the preparedness and response efforts to control the disease.
   In all the affected districts, surveillance was intensified on both
   domestic and wild birds; biosecurity measures were increased; and
   movement controls, culling, cleaning, disinfection and safe disposal of
   carcasses were implemented. Awareness of the disease was raised through
   education materials, leaflets and brochures distributed to farmers.
   Finally, Uganda successfully controlled the H5N8 outbreak, using its
   national preparedness and response mechanisms and through collaboration
   with international partners. The emergence and spread of this virus
   strain in Uganda and other parts of Africa poses a significant threat to
   the poultry industry and food security.}},

   host species. Many previous studies have highlighted the lack of a
   surveillance system for CE, its persistence in Italy, and endemicity in
   several Italian regions. Because of the absence of a uniform
   surveillance program for both humans and animals, disease occurrence is
   widely underestimated. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of
   ovine CE in Italy. Survey data on the prevalence of Echinococcus
   granulosus complex infections in Italian sheep farms from 2010 to 2015
   were obtained in collaboration with Regional Veterinary Epidemiology
   Observatories (OEVRs). Bayesian analysis was performed to estimate the
   true CE farm prevalence. The prior true CE prevalence was estimated
   using data from Sardinia. Second, Bayesian modelling of the observed
   prevalence in different regions and the true prevalence estimation from
   the first step were used to ultimately estimate the prevalence of ovine
   CE in Italy. We obtained survey data from 10 OEVRs, covering 14 Italian
   regions. We observed that the risk of CE infection decreased over the
   years, and it was strictly correlated with the density of susceptible
   species. Using Sardinia as prior distribution, where the disease farm
   prevalence was approximately 19\% (95\% CI, 18.82-20.02), we estimated
   that the highest endemic CE farm prevalence was in Basilicata with a
   value of 12\% (95\% BCI: 7.49-18.9\%) and in Piemonte 7.64\%(95\% BCI:
   4.12-13.04\%). Our results provide spatially relevant data crucial for
   guiding CE control in Italy. Precise information on disease occurrence
   location would aid in the identification of priority areas for disease
   control implementation by the authorities. The current underestimation
   of CE occurrence should urge the Italian and European governments to
   become aware of the public health importance of CE and implement
   targeted interventions for high-risk areas.}},

Abstract = {{Salmonella enterica serovar 1,4,{[}5],12:i:- has emerged over the last
   two decades as one of the most common serovars causing human
   salmonellosis in Europe. It is supposed to originate from Salmonella
   enterica serovar Typhimurium due to antigenic and genotypic similarities
   between the two serovars. Due to the high level of similarity, the
   multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) protocol
   designed for Salmonella Typhimurium routine typing is commonly used also
   for the characterization of S. 1,4,{[}5],12:i. Nevertheless, the
   Salmonella Typhimurium-based MLVA protocol often shows poor
   discriminatory power for S. 1,4,{[}5],12:i. Indeed, only a limited
   number of MLVA profiles have been described for S. 1,4,{[}5],12:i:-.
   Moreover, based on the MLVA clustering, S. 1,4,{[}5],12:i:- is supposed
   to display high clonality. The aim of the present work was to assess
   whether the five loci of Salmonella Typhimurium investigated by MLVA are
   sufficiently accurate to correctly assign S. 1,4,{[}5],12:i:- isolates.
   For this purpose, 38 epidemiologically unrelated S. 1,4,{[}5],12:i:-
   were subjected to whole-genome sequencing. Isolates were selected among
   a collection of monophasic strains isolated in Italy from different
   sources over the period 2014-2016 and belonging to the five most
   commonly detected MLVA profiles. Results confirmed the possible
   clonality for S. 1,4,{[}5],12:i:- serovar in the light of the scarce
   difference observed in terms of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
   among investigated isolates. Nevertheless, unrelated isolates on the
   basis of the difference of SNP number were characterized as
   indistinguishable by MLVA profile, thus suggesting an insufficient
   resolution of MLVA. Hence, we can conclude that MLVA-based approach does
   not seem a valuable proxy to deepen into the epidemiological
   relationship among S. 1,4,{[}5],12:i:- isolates. These evidences can be
   useful to avoid incorrect assignment especially when surveillance data
   are used for outbreak investigations.}},

Title = {{The invasive mosquito Aedes japonicus japonicus is spreading in

Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{MAR 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: The invasive mosquito species, Aedes japonicus japonicus,
   was detected in northeastern Italy for the first time in 2015, at the
   border with Austria. After this finding, a more intensive monitoring was
   carried out to assess its distribution and to collect biological data.
   Herein, we report the results of four years (2015-2018) of activity.
   Methods: The presence of Ae. j. japonicus was checked in all possible
   breeding sites through collections of larvae. The monitoring started
   from the site of the first detection at the Austrian border and then was
   extended in all directions. The mosquitoes were identified
   morphologically and molecularly.
   Results: Aedes j. japonicus was found in 58 out of 73 municipalities
   monitored (79.5\%). In total (2015-2018), 238 sampling sites were
   monitored and 90 were positive for presence of Ae. j. japonicus larvae
   (37.8\%). The mosquito was collected mainly in artificial containers
   located in small villages and in rural areas. Cohabitation with other
   mosquito species was observed in 55.6\% of the samplings.
   Conclusions: Aedes j. japonicus is well established in Italy and in only
   four years has colonised two Italian Regions, displaying rapid spreading
   throughout hilly and mountainous areas. Colonization towards the south
   seems limited by climatic conditions and the occurrence of a large
   population of the larval competitor, Ae. albopictus. The further spread
   of Ae. j. japonicus has the potential to pose new threats of zoonotic
   agents (i.e. Dirofilaria spp. and West Nile virus) within areas at
   altitudes previously considered at negligible risk in Italy.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundTroglostrongylus brevior, a lungworm usually affecting wild
   felids, has been recently recorded in a number of cases in domestic
   cats, mainly in Mediterranean areas. Although feline troglostrongylosis
   is a severe and life-threatening disease, especially in young cats,
   treatment options are very limited. The present study evaluated the
   efficacy and safety of a spot-on formulation containing emodepside 2.1\%
   and praziquantel 8.6\% (Profender((R)), Bayer), which is licensed for
   treatment of the more common cat lungworm Aelurostrongylus abstrusus,

   enrolled in the study were 1:1 allocated to two groups, i.e. Group T,
   treated with Profender((R)) spot-on on days 0 and 14 (2) at the
   recommended clinical dose, and Group C which remained untreated. After
   study completion, the control cats received two rescue treatments with
   Profender((R)) on days 28 (2) and 42 (+/- 2). The primary efficacy
   criterion was the absence of T. brevior L1 following treatment. Other
   efficacy parameters were the quantitative comparison of L1 presence
   before (baseline) and after treatment in both groups, and the comparison
   of clinical signs pre- and post-treatment.Results p id=Par3 In terms of

Abstract = {{Information on the population dynamics of a reservoir species have been
   increasingly adopted to understand and eventually predict the dispersal
   patterns of infectious diseases throughout an area. Although potentially
   relevant, to date there are no studies which have investigated the
   genetic structure of the red fox population in relation to infectious
   disease dynamics. Therefore, we genetically and spatially characterised
   the red fox population in the area stretching between the Eastern and
   Dinaric Alps, which has been affected by both distemper and rabies at
   different time intervals. Red foxes collected from north-eastern Italy,
   Austria, Slovenia and Croatia between 2006-2012, were studied using a
   set of 21 microsatellite markers. We confirmed a weak genetic
   differentiation within the fox population using Bayesian clustering
   analyses, and we were able to differentiate the fox population into
   geographically segregated groups. Our finding might be due to the
   presence of geographical barriers that have likely influenced the
   distribution of the fox population, limiting in turn gene flow and
   spread of infectious diseases. Focusing on the Italian red fox
   population, we observed interesting variations in the prevalence of both
   diseases among distinct fox clusters, with the previously identified
   Italy 1 and Italy 2 rabies as well as distemper viruses preferentially
   affecting different sub-groups identified in the study. Knowledge of the
   regional-scale population structure can improve understanding of the
   epidemiology and spread of diseases. Our study paves the way for an
   integrated approach for disease control coupling pathogen, host and
   environmental data to inform targeted control programs in the future.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background Methicillin resistance in staphylococci is conferred by an
   alternative PBP (PBP2a/2) with low affinity for most -lactam
   antibiotics. PBP2a is encoded by mecA, which is carried on a mobile
   genetic element known as SCCmec. A variant of mecA, mecC, was described
   in 2011 and has been found in Staphylococcus aureus from humans and a
   wide range of animal species as well as a small number of other
   staphylococcal species from animals.
   Objectives We characterized a novel mecC allotype, mecC3, encoded by an
   environmental isolate of Staphylococcus caeli cultured from air sampling
   of a commercial rabbit holding.
   Methods The S. caeli isolate 82B(T) was collected in Italy in 2013 and
   genome sequenced using MiSeq technology. This allowed the assembly and
   comparative genomic study of the novel SCCmec region encoding mecC3.
   Results The study isolate encodes a novel mecA allotype, mecC3, with
   92\% nucleotide identity to mecC. mecC3 is encoded within a novel SCCmec
   element distinct from those previously associated with mecC, including a
   ccrAB pairing (ccrA5B3) not previously linked to mecC.
   Conclusions This is the first description of the novel mecC allotype
   mecC3, the first isolation of a mecC-positive Staphylococcus in Italy
   and the first report of mecC in S. caeli. Furthermore, the SCCmec
   element described here is highly dissimilar to the archetypal SCCmec XI
   encoding mecC in S. aureus and to elements encoding mecC in other
   staphylococci. Our report highlights the diversity of mecC allotypes and
   the diverse staphylococcal species, ecological settings and genomic
   context in which mecC may be found.}},

Abstract = {{In Morocco in early 2016, a low pathogenic avian influenza virus
   serotype H9N2 caused large economic losses to the poultry industry, with
   specific clinical symptoms and high mortality rates on infected farms.
   Subsequent to the H9N2 outbreak, the causal agent was successfully
   isolated from chicken flocks with high morbidity and mortality rates,
   propagated on embryonated eggs, and fully sequenced. The phylogenetic
   analysis suggested that the Moroccan isolate could have derived from the
   Middle East isolate A/chicken/Dubai/D2506. A/2015. This study was
   designed to assess the pathogenicity of the Moroccan isolate H9N2 in
   experimentally infected broiler and specific-pathogen-free (SPF)
   chickens. At 22 days of age, one broiler and two SPF chicken groups were
   inoculated by dropping 0.2 ml of the H9N2 isolate (10(7.5) EID50/ml) in
   both nostrils and eyes. Clinically inoculated chickens with H9N2
   displayed mild lesions, low mortality rates, and an absence of clinical
   signs. The H9N2 virus was more pathogenic in broiler chickens and
   produced more severe tissue lesions compared to SPF chickens. The viral
   shedding was detected up to 6 days postinoculation (pi) in oropharyngeal
   and cloacal swabs in infected birds with a maximum shedding in the
   oropharynges of the broiler group. All experimental chickens
   seroconverted and registered high hemagglutination inhibition titers as
   early as day 7 pi. The present study indicates that the H9N2 virus
   isolated from a natural outbreak was of low pathogenicity under
   experimental conditions. However, under field conditions infection with
   other pathogens might have aggravated the disease.}},

Abstract = {{The G1-H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV) has caused significant economic
   losses in the commercial poultry industry due to reduced egg production
   and increased mortality. The field observations have shown that H9N2
   viruses circulate and naturally mix with other pathogens and these
   simultaneous infections can exacerbate disease. To avoid an incorrect
   virus characterization, due to co-infection, isolates were purified by
   in vitro plaque assays. Two plaque purified G1-H9N2 clones, selected on
   different cell types, named MDCK-and CEF-clone in regards to the cell
   culture used, were studied in vivo, revealing two different virulence
   phenotypes. Subsequently, the underlying mechanisms were studied.
   Specifically, the phenotypical outcome of SPF bird infection by the two
   clones resulted in completely different clinical outcomes. These
   differences in clinical outcome were used to study the factors behind
   this output in more detail. Further studies demonstrated that the more
   severe disease outcome associated with the MDCK-clone involves a strong
   induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a lack of type I interferon
   production, whereas the mild disease outcome associated with the
   CEF-clone is related to a greater antiviral cytokine response. The
   immunosuppressive effect of the MDCK-clone on splenocytes was further
   demonstrated via ChIFN-gamma lack production after ex vivo mitogenic
   stimulation. Genome sequencing of the two clones identified only four
   amino acid differences including three in the HA sequence (HA-E198A,
   HA-R234L, HA-E502D-H9 numbering) and one in the NA sequence (NA-V33M).
   In the present study, valuable insights on the mechanisms responsible
   for AI pathogenicity and molecular mechanisms of H9N2 infections in
   chicken were obtained while highlighting the impact of the cells viruses
   are grown on their virulence.}},

Abstract = {{In human breast cancer, both circulating tumour cells (CTCs) in
   peripheral blood and disseminated tumour cells (DTCs) in the bone marrow
   are predictive of short survival and may be used as liquid biopsy to
   guide therapy. Herein we investigate, for the first time, the
   feasibility to quantify CTCs and DTCs in canine metastatic mammary
   carcinoma (MMC) with the automated CellSearch platform, which identifies
   tumour cells by immune-magnetic enrichment and fluorescent labelling.
   Using this approach before start of treatment, we could detect at least
   1 CTC per 7.5 mL of peripheral blood in 12 out of 27 evaluable samples
   (44.4\%) and at least 1 DTC per 1 mL of bone marrow in 11 out of 14
   evaluable samples (78.6\%). Conversely, we did not find any CTCs in the
   healthy, negative control dogs (n = 5) that we analysed in parallel.
   Interestingly, the levels of CTCs/DTCs and the prevalence of positive
   dogs closely resemble results obtained by CellSearch assay in metastatic
   breast cancer patients at diagnosis. Moreover, in the canine cohort, the
   presence of CTCs was significantly associated with poor outcome. These
   observations identify the first actionable marker in veterinarian
   oncology to guide treatment of canine MMC. Furthermore, our findings
   have important implications for human research, since it reinforce the
   value of canine MMC as model useful to speed up pharmacological studies
   with primary endpoint of overall survival, given the reduced life-span

Abstract = {{This review summarizes the available knowledge on the immune defences of
   European sea bass against antigenic preparations derived from the viral
   encephalopathy and retinopathy virus (betanodavirus), which represents a
   major threat to the health of this fish species. The nodavirus is widely
   present and differentiates into several strains that infect
   invertebrates (in insects, alphanodavirus) and teleost fish, and thus
   may represent a great problem for farmed fish species. Many efforts have
   been directed to discovering new immunizations to induce protection in
   sea bass, especially at young stages, and these efforts have included
   employing diverse betanodavirus strains, antigen preparation,
   vaccination routes, and the addition of adjuvants and/or
   immunostimulants. The obtained results showed that inactivated
   preparations of betanodavirus that were administered intraperitoneally
   may induce both immune recognition and protection. Attempts at
   performing mucosal immunization by immersion and/or oral administration,
   which is a vaccination route that is highly preferred for sea bass, have
   shown intriguing results, and more studies are necessary for its
   improvement. Overall, the objective of identifying a reliable vaccine
   that also cross-protects against different genotypes or reassortant
   viruses for use in European sea bass against betanodavirus appears to be
   an attainable goal in the near future.}},

Abstract = {{Viral encephalopathy and retinopathy (VER) is a severe infective disease
   characterized by neuropathological changes in several fish species
   associated with high mortality. The etiological agent is a virus
   belonging to the Nodaviridae family, genus Betaraodavirus. To date, four
   different betanodavirus species have been officially recognized by
   International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), namely the
   red-spotted grouper-(RGNNV), the striped jack- (SJNNV), the barfin
   flounder- (BFNNV) and the tiger puffer nervous necrosis virus (TPNNV).
   Moreover, two reassortants RGNNV/SJNNV and SJNNV/RGNNV have been
   described.
   Betanodaviruses can be classified into three different serotypes (A, B
   and C) that are antigenically different, so none (between serotype A and
   C) or partial (between serotype B and C) cross-immunoreactivity has been
   detected in vitro.
   In this study we investigated the in vivo cross-protection of the two
   main betanodavirus species (RGNNV and SJNNV), which belong to distinct
   serotype, by immunizing intraperitoneally (IP) juvenile sea bass with
   formalin inactivated RGNNV and SJNNV vaccines, followed by a challenge
   with RGNNV.
   Fish IP vaccinated with inactivated RGNNV showed a high protection value
   (85\%). Serological analyses highlighted a great specific anti-NNV
   immunoglobulin M (IgM) production against the homologous virus, while a
   good seroconversion with low neutralization property was highlighted
   against the heterologous virus. In fish IP vaccinated with inactivated
   SJNNV the protection recorded was equal to 25\%, significantly lower
   respect to the one provided by RGNNV IP vaccine. ELISA test detected
   good IgM production against the homologous virus, and a lower, but still
   detectable IgM production against the heterologous one. By contrast,
   serum neutralization test highlighted a poorly detectable antibody
   production unable to neutralize either the homologous or the
   heterologous virus.
   These results confirm that the two serotypes are not cross-protective in
   vivo. According to these findings, the production of multivalent
   formulation, or at least the provision of different types of vaccines
   based on both fish and virus species requirement, should be recommended
   in order to broaden the range of protection.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundBartonella henselae, Bartonella clarridgeiae and the rare
   Bartonella koehlerae are zoonotic pathogens, with cats being regarded as
   the main reservoir hosts. The spread of the infection among cats occurs
   mainly via fleas and specific preventive measures need to be
   implemented. The effectiveness of a 10\% imidacloprid/4.5\% flumethrin
   polymer matrix collar (Seresto (R), Bayer Animal Health), registered to
   prevent flea and tick infestations, in reducing the risk of Bartonella
   spp. infection in privately owned cats, was assessed in a prospective
   longitudinal study.MethodsIn March-May 2015 {[}Day 0 (D0)], 204
   privately-owned cats from the Aeolian Islands (Sicily) were collared
   (G1, n = 104) or left as controls (G2, n = 100). The bacteraemia of
   Bartonella spp. was assessed at enrolment (D0) and study closure (D360)
   by PCR and DNA sequencing both prior to and after an enrichment step,
   using Bartonella alpha proteobacteria growth medium (BAPGM).ResultsA
   total of 152 cats completed the study with 3 in G1 and 10 in G2 being
   positive for Bartonella spp. Bartonella henselae genotype I ZF1 (1.35\%)
   and genotype II Fizz/Cal-1 (6.76\%) as well as B. clarridgeiae (5.41\%)
   were detected in cats of G2. Bartonella clarridgeiae was the only
   species detected in G1. Based on the yearly crude incidence of
   Bartonella spp. infection (i.e. 3.85\% in G1 and 13.51\% in G2; P =
   0.03) the Seresto (R) collar achieved a preventative efficacy of
   71.54\%. The incidence of Bartonella spp. infection was more frequent in
   flea-infested cats (6/33, 18.18\%) than in uninfested ones (7/112,
   5.88\%) (P = 0.036).ConclusionsCats living in the Aeolian Islands are
   exposed to B. henselae and B. clarridgeiae. The Seresto (R) collar
   provided significant risk reduction against Bartonella spp. infection in
   outdoor cats under field conditions. Such a preventative tool could be a
   key contribution for decreasing the risk of Bartonella spp. infection in
   cats and thus ultimately to humans.}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide bivalve production has increased significantly in recent
   years. Bivalve meat is recommended in dietary regimens due to the
   benefits associated with their consumption but, at the same time, is
   internationally recognized as a potential vehicle for outbreaks of

   consumers' food practices and risk perceptions regarding molluscs. Four
   focus groups involving 42 consumers were conducted in Veneto and Marche
   region. The core analysis was then applied to each focus group
   discussion in order to identify, categorize and rank the information

   purchasing bivalves; the bivalve preparation, cooking and storage
   conditions at home; the consumption of raw molluscs and the health

   females and 11 males, aged from 8 months to 5 years, weighing 1.2-5.2
   kg) of different breeds, naturally infected by T. callipaeda. At study
   inclusion (Day 0), animals were physically examined and the infection
   level was assessed by examination of both eyes for clinical score and
   live adult T. callipaeda count. Each cat was weighed and randomly
   assigned to one of the treatment groups (G1: Advocate, G2: untreated
   control). Clinical assessments and T. callipaeda adult counts were
   performed on Day 14. At the study completion visit on Day 28, clinical
   assessments and counts of T. callipaeda adults and larvae were
   performed. All cats were daily observed by their owners and general
   health conditions were recorded during the entire period of the
   study.ResultsThe primary effectiveness variable was the percentage of
   animals in G1 group (Advocate) showing a complete elimination
   (parasitological cure) of adult eye worms at Day 14 and Day 28 . The
   effectiveness of the treatment in the G1 group was 93.3 and 100\% at Day
   14 and Day 28 , respectively, when compared to group G2. Total worm
   count reduction from both eyes for Advocate was 96.3\% on Day 14 and
   100\% on Day 28. Clinical data were confirmed by the examination of
   conjunctival pouch flushing. An overall reduction in the number of cats
   with lacrimation and conjunctivitis was observed following treatment
   despite the fact that in a few cats treated with Advocate clinical signs
   persisted due to the chronic nature of the disease.ConclusionsBased on

Abstract = {{We conducted a survey of attitudes towards antimicrobial use and
   awareness of antimicrobial resistance among turkey and rabbit farmers (N
   = 117 and N = 41, respectively) in Italy's utmost turkey- and
   rabbit-producing region. We found either similarities or significant
   differences between these two livestock sectors. Most farmers of both
   groups (72\% of turkey farmers vs 76\% of rabbit farmers) reported that
   antimicrobials are properly used in their farms. Almost three-quarters
   of the farmers reported that antimicrobials solve the health problem
   treated for. However, 47\% of turkey farmers and 78\% of rabbit farmers
   reported that antimicrobial use could be decreased, with a 20-30\%
   reduction being the most frequently chosen range. Genetic improvement
   was reported to be the main factor able to reduce antimicrobial use in
   turkeys, whereas improvements in feed quality and microclimate were the
   main factors for rabbits. Most farmers reported that high antimicrobial
   use may affect the quality of meat products and be hazardous to human
   health, but they also reported that antimicrobial resistance is mainly
   related to antimicrobial use in humans. In conclusion, turkey and rabbit
   farmers have a generally positive opinion on veterinary antimicrobial
   use, but also low levels of awareness of the negative impact on public
   health. Economic and structural factors of rabbit production industry
   may explain the differences observed. Farm veterinarians will be crucial
   to support farmers' education and the expected transition to lower
   antimicrobial use while maintaining high animal health/welfare
   standards.}},

Abstract = {{Various ticks exist in the temperate hilly and pre-alpine areas of
   Northern Italy, where Ixodes ricinus is the more important. In this area
   different tick-borne pathogen monitoring projects have recently been
   implemented; we present here the results of a two-year field survey of
   ticks and associated pathogens, conducted 2009-2010 in North-eastern
   Italy. The cost-effectiveness of different sampling strategies,
   hypothesized a posteriori based on two sub-sets of data, were compared
   and analysed. The same two subsets were also used to develop models of
   habitat suitability, using a maximum entropy algorithm based on remotely
   sensed data. Comparison of the two strategies (in terms of number of
   ticks collected, rates of pathogen detection and model accuracy)
   indicated that monitoring at many temporary sites was more
   cost-effective than monthly samplings at a few permanent sites. The two
   model predictions were similar and provided a greater understanding of
   ecological requirements of I. ricinus in the study area. Dense
   vegetation cover, as measured by the normalized difference vegetation
   index, was identified as a good predictor of tick presence, whereas high
   summer temperatures appeared to be a limiting factor. The study suggests
   that it is possible to obtain realistic results (in terms of pathogens
   detection and development of habitat suitability maps) with a relatively
   limited sampling effort and a well-planned monitoring strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Due to its multifunctional and complex role in the honey bee colony
   functioning and health (construction material allowing food storage,
   brood rearing, thermoregulation, mediation in chemical and mechanical
   communication, substrate for pathogens, toxins and waste), Apis
   mellifera beeswax has been widely studied over the last five decades.
   This is supported by a comprehensive set of scientific reports covering
   different aspects of beeswax research. In this article, we present an
   overview of the methods for studying chemical, biological,
   constructional, and quality aspects of beeswax. We provide a detailed
   description of the methods for investigating wax scales, comb
   construction and growth pattern, cell properties, chemical composition
   of beeswax using different analytical tools, as well as the analytical
   procedures for provenancing beeswax and beeswax-derived compounds based
   on the hydrogen isotope ratio (IRMS). Along with classical
   physico-chemical and sensory analysis, we describe more precise and
   accurate methods for detection of adulterants in beeswax (GC-MS and
   FTIR-ATR). Moreover, we present methods for studying the influence of
   beeswax (comb foundation) adulteration on comb construction. Analytical
   protocols for determining the pesticide residues using different
   chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques are also described. As
   beeswax is an agent of high risk for the transmission of bee diseases,
   we present methods for detection of pathogens in beeswax. To ensure the
   reproducibility of experiments and results, we present best practice
   approaches and detailed protocols for all methods described, as well as
   their advantages and disadvantages.}},

Abstract = {{High neutrophil (PMN, Polymorphonuclear neutrophil) counts in the
   endometrium of cows affected by endometritis, suggests the involvement
   of oxidative stress (OS) among the causes of impaired fertility. Protein
   oxidation, in particular, advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP),
   are OS biomarkers linked to PMN activity. To test this hypothesis, the
   relationship between protein oxidation and uterus health was studied in
   thirty-eight dairy cows during the puerperium. The animals were found to
   be cycling, without any signs of disease and pharmacological treatments.
   PMN count was performed either through a cytobrush or a uterine horn
   lavage (UHL). Cows were classified into four groups, based on the
   uterine ultrasonographic characteristics and the PMN percentage in the
   uterine horns with a higher percentage of high neutrophil horn (HNH).
   They were classified as: Healthy (H); Subclinical Endometritis (SCE);
   Grade 1 Endometritis (EM1); and Grade 2 Endometritis (EM2). AOPP and
   carbonyls were measured in plasma and UHL. UHL samples underwent Western
   blot analysis to visualize the carbonyl and dityrosine formation. Plasma
   AOPP were higher (p < 0.05) in EM2. AOPP and carbonyl group
   concentrations were higher in the HNH samples (p < 0.05). Protein
   concentration in the UHL was higher in the EM2 (p < 0.05). Carbonyl and
   dityrosine formation was more intense in EM1 and EM2. Protein oxidation
   observed in the EM2 suggests the presence of an inflammatory status in
   the uterus which, if not adequately hindered, could result in low
   fertility.}},

   groups, were used for the experiment. Miticide efficacy, average daily
   mortality rate of adult bees, and number of bees present in the hives at

   Api-Bioxal((R)) combined with queen caging. High adult honey bee
   mortality was recorded after treatment with Maqs((R)), showing that
   average daily mortality was 82.4\% higher than natural daily mortality.
   Daily mortality for Api-Bioxal((R)) and queen caging was instead 30.1\%
   lower than in non-treated colonies. The average decrease in the colony
   population of the treated groups was higher in the Maqs((R)) (-38\%)

Title = {{Active and passive surveillance for bat lyssaviruses in Italy revealed

Journal = {{EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{147}},
Abstract = {{The wide geographical distribution and genetic diversity of
   bat-associated lyssaviruses (LYSVs) across Europe suggest that similar
   viruses may also be harboured in Italian insectivorous bats. Indeed,
   bats were first included within the passive national surveillance
   programme for rabies in wildlife in the 1980s, while active surveillance
   has been performed since 2008. The active surveillance strategies
   implemented allowed us to detect neutralizing antibodies directed
   towards European bat 1 lyssavirus in six out of the nine maternity
   colonies object of the study across the whole country. Seropositive bats
   were Myotis myotis, M. blythii and Tadarida teniotis. On the contrary,
   the virus was neither detected through passive nor active surveillance,
   suggesting that fatal neurological infection is rare also in
   seropositive colonies. Although the number of tested samples has
   steadily increased in recent years, submission turned out to be rather
   sporadic and did not include carcasses from bat species that account for
   the majority of LYSVs cases in Europe, such as Eptesicus serotinus, M.
   daubentonii, M. dasycneme and M. nattereri. A closer collaboration with
   bat handlers is therefore mandatory to improve passive surveillance and
   decrypt the significance of serological data obtained up to now.}},

   eosinophils, mast cells, cluster of differentiation (CD) 3-, CD79
   alpha-, CD68-positive cells were determined on immunohistochemically
   stained skin sections using a semiautomatic analysis system. Forty
   (20.9, 40/191) chamois were positive for trombiculid larvae on skin
   scrapings. Of the positive animals, 15 were from Lombardy and 25 from
   Piedmont, with similar prevalences. Macroscopic lesions were light with
   involvement of body regions that had contact with the ground, especially
   head (pinnae and areas around eyes and mouth) and limbs, where
   stylostome was easily formed due to thin skin. Histologically,
   trombiculosis caused a focal moderate dermatitis with epidermal
   necrosis, thin crusts, and hyperkeratosis. Inflammatory infiltrates were
   suggestive of a granulomatous reaction centered on a stylostome, formed
   by mite saliva and necrotic host tissue debris. However, we detected
   some difference in cutaneous immune response with some chamois showing a
   prevalent T-cell response and others having an increased B-cell count

Abstract = {{Between October 2016 and December 2017, several European Countries had
   been involved in a massive Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI)
   epidemic sustained by H5N8 subtype virus. Starting on December 2016,
   also Italy was affected by H5N8 HPAI virus, with cases occurring in two
   epidemic waves: the first between December 2016 and May 2017, and the
   second in July-December 2017. Eighty-three outbreaks were recorded in
   poultry, 67 of which (80.72\%) occurring in the second wave. A total of
   14 cases were reported in wild birds. Epidemiological information and
   genetic analyses were conjointly used to get insight on the spread
   dynamics. Analyses indicated multiple introductions from wild birds to
   the poultry sector in the first epidemic wave, and noteworthy lateral
   spread from October 2017 in a limited geographical area with high
   poultry densities. Turkeys, layers and backyards were the mainly
   affected types of poultry production. Two genetic sub-groups were
   detected in the second wave in non-overlapping geographical areas,
   leading to speculate on the involvement of different wild bird
   populations. The integration of epidemiological data and genetic
   analyses allowed to unravel the transmission dynamics of H5N8 virus in
   Italy, and could be exploited to timely support in implementing tailored

Title = {{Recent advances on Dirofilaria repens in dogs and humans in Europe}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 19}},
Abstract = {{Dirofilaria repens is a nematode affecting domestic and wild canids,
   transmitted by several species of mosquitoes. It usually causes a
   non-pathogenic subcutaneous infection in dogs and is the principal agent
   of human dirofilariosis in the Old World. In the last decades, D. repens
   has increased in prevalence in areas where it has already been reported
   and its distribution range has expanded into new areas of Europe,
   representing a paradigmatic example of an emergent pathogen. Despite its
   emergence and zoonotic impact, D. repens has received less attention by
   scientists compared to Dirofilaria immitis. In this review we report the
   recent advances of D. repens infection in dogs and humans, and
   transmission by vectors, and discuss possible factors that influence the
   spread and increase of this zoonotic parasite in Europe. There is
   evidence that D. repens has spread faster than D. immitis from the
   endemic areas of southern Europe to northern Europe. Climate change
   affecting mosquito vectors and the facilitation of pet travel seem to
   have contributed to this expansion; however, in the authors' opinion,
   the major factor is likely the rate of undiagnosed dogs continuing to
   perpetuate the life-cycle of D. repens. Many infected dogs remain
   undetected due to the subclinical nature of the disease, the lack of
   rapid and reliable diagnostic tools and the poor knowledge and still low
   awareness of D. repens in non-endemic areas. Improved diagnostic tools
   are warranted to bring D. repens diagnosis to the state of D. immitis
   diagnosis, as well as improved screening of imported dogs and promotion
   of preventative measures among veterinarians and dog owners. For
   vector-borne diseases involving pets, veterinarians play a significant
   role in prevention and should be more aware of their responsibility in
   reducing the impact of the zoonotic agents. In addition, they should
   enhance multisectorial collaboration with medical entomologists and the
   public health experts, under the concept and the actions of One
   Health-One Medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Toxoplasmosis is a zoonotic disease causing severe symptoms
   in pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals. On average,
   worldwide, around 30\% of people are seropositive. The oral transmission
   route is of great significance and food, particularly meat, is an
   important transmission vehicle for T. gondii. However, the role of
   different food matrices is debated. Objectives: The aim of this review
   was to assess the risk of humans developing acute T. gondii infection
   via the foodborne route. Study eligibility criteria: Case-control
   studies including acute cases of T. gondii infection were included after
   literature searches, without time limits, in several databases. All
   studies estimating the risk of acquiring T. gondii infection after
   consumption of specific food categories were included. Results: Three
   risk factors proved to be significantly associated with acute T. gondii
   infection in humans: consumption of raw/undercooked meat, Odds Ratio
   (OR) 3.44 (1.29-9.16), consumption of raw/undercooked beef, OR 2.22
   (1.57-3.12), and consumption of raw/undercooked sheep meat, OR 3.85
   (1.85-8.00). Consumption of raw/undercooked pork, raw eggs, and
   unpasteurized milk proved to be non-significant risk factors.
   Limitations: Limitations in the present review and meta-analysis are due
   to the low number of case-control studies available for analysis and the
   lack of a search strategy targeting gray literature. Conclusion:
   Consumption of raw/undercooked beef and sheep meat are important risk
   factors for T. gondii infection. Their consumption should be avoided in
   order to prevent toxoplasmosis, particularly by those in at-risk
   categories, including pregnant women. The review protocol is registered
   in PROSPERO database (CRD42016043295).}},

Abstract = {{Context: Recent studies have suggested that influenza A virus (IAV)
   might be involved in the etiology of diabetes.
   Objective and Methods: To address this question, we tested the ability
   of H1N1 pandemic IAV to infect, replicate, and damage human beta
   cells/pancreatic islets in vitro and induce pancreatic damage and/or
   glucose metabolism alterations in chemical and autoimmune models of b
   cell damage in vivo. Moreover, we looked for direct and/or indirect
   evidence of correlation between IAV infection and autoimmunity/diabetes
   in humans.
   Results: Human H1N1 A/California/2009-derived viruses infected human
   pancreatic islets in vitro, inducing a proinflammatory response
   associated with substantial increases of CXCL9 and CXCL10 release. In
   vivo, infected mice showed a clear susceptibility to the virus, with its
   localization also found in extrapulmonary organs, including the
   pancreas. Infection was able to induce mild modifications of glycemia in
   C57B6 mice after chemical damage of islets but did not modulate the
   autoimmune damage of islets in NOD mice. One of 69 nasopharyngeal swabs
   collected from patients at the onset of type 1 diabetes yielded positive
   results for IAV. Pancreas sections from 17 organ donors available from
   the Network for Pancreatic Organ Donors With Diabetes showed the
   persistence of CXCL10-positive cells in islet autoimmunity-positive
   subjects; however, extremely rare cells stained for viral RNA and not
   preferentially in autoimmune subjects.
   Conclusion: Influenza H1N1 pdm strains are able to infect and replicate
   in mammalian pancreatic cells both in vitro and in vivo but did not
   cause any functional impairment consistent with diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{Cherax destructor is a crayfish endemic to south-eastern Australia and
   one of the last alien crayfish to be introduced in Italy. In the Laghi
   di Ninfa Natural Reserve (Latium region, Central Italy), the species was
   probably introduced in 1999, but only reported for the first time in
   2008. Nearby this area, the most widespread alien crayfish is the red
   swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii. In the Natural Reserve, between 2008
   and 2013 and during spring and summer, crayfish sampling was carried out
   with baited traps to assess the distribution of C. destructor and its
   possible relationship with P. clarkii. Cherax destructor was first
   recorded in 2008; few P. clarkii were detected in the cultivation ponds
   where C. destructor was present in 2012 and 2013. Moreover, crayfish
   plague analyses evidenced a positive result in two out of the 12 sampled
   P. clarkii. Cherax destructor is now completely absent from the Natural
   Reserve, while P. clarkii has spread in the area and was probably
   responsible for this eradication since C. destructor is vulnerable to
   crayfish plague which was also detected in the area. An ecosystem
   restoration project in the area favoured the spread of. P. clarkii; the
   implications of this intervention are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Honey bees are pollinators that play a key-role in plant biodiversity
   conservation and crop production. This unique insect species has been
   managed in hives by beekeepers for millennia, even though such a
   peculiar animal production system never resulted in the domestication of
   the western honey bee. The western honey bee was originally distributed
   throughout most of Europe, Africa, the Middle East, part of the Arabian
   Peninsula and some parts of Central Asia. From Europe, the honey bee was
   introduced to America, Asia and Oceania. This adaptation to a range of
   environmental conditions, together with geological and climatic changes
   in past eras, has resulted in grouping of Apis mellifera into 31
   subspecies. In the last 150 years, technological advances in beekeeping
   and globalisation have heavily endangered conservation of the native
   subspecies of A. mellifera in Europe, with an impact on honey bee
   production and health status. Evaluation of the impact of this
   phenomenon on the ecological equilibrium is still ongoing, but there is
   already scientific evidence of negative effects that this problem is
   having on beekeeping. This document sets forth the scientific arguments
   in support of the conservation of native subspecies, and lists the
   existing Italian legislation in terms of subspecies protection
   initiatives. It also lists the main factors that are contributing to
   loss of genetic diversity and of local adaptations. This document does
   not intend to oppose the actions of the beekeeping industry, but rather
   to contribute to a more global vision of the very serious problem of
   honey bee decline.}},

Abstract = {{Dogs may be useful sentinels for public health monitoring of spotted
   fever group rickettsioses (SFGR). The aim of this study was to determine
   the exposure to SFGR among dogs and feeding ticks in central Italy. A
   total of 344 dogs and 607 adult ticks (395 Rhipicephalus sanguineus and
   212 Ixodes ricinus specimens) collected from the coats of sampled
   animals were included in the study. Canine serum samples were analyzed
   by indirect fluorescent antibody technique (IFAT) for IgG antibodies
   against Rickettsia conorii and Rickettsia rickettsii. All the ticks and
   buffy coats were processed by a PCR targeting a fragment of gltA
   followed by sequencing. Overall, 56 dogs (16.3\%) tested positive for
   one or both rickettsial antigens by IFAT with endpoint titers ranging
   from 1:64 to 1:2048; 38 (11\%) serum samples reacted against R. conorii,
   46 (13.4\%) reacted against R. rickettsii, and 28 (8.1\%) reacted
   simultaneously against both rickettsial agents. All buffy coats were PCR
   negative. Rickettsial DNA was revealed in 39 (18.4\%) I. ricinus and in
   10 (2.5\%) R. sanguineus specimens. The amplicons sequencing showed
   three SFGR, that is, R. conorii detected in 10 R. sanguineus specimens
   and Rickettsia helvetica and Rickettsia monacensis detected in 7 and 32
   I. ricinus ticks. Nine out of the 10 R. conorii isolates were obtained
   from ticks collected from seronegative dogs, and one specimen from a dog
   tested positive for both R. rickettsii and R. conorii by
   immunofluorescence assay. Among the seven ticks tested positive for R.
   helvetica, six were recovered from the coats of seronegative dogs and
   one from a dog having antibodies against R. conorii; the 32 isolates of
   R. monacensis were obtained from 28 seronegative and 4 R. conorii/R.
   rickettsii-positive dogs. The results highlight the non-negligible

Abstract = {{In dogs, inflammatory mammary carcinoma is a clinicopathological entity
   characterized by rapid progression and aggressive behavior from onset of
   disease. Reported median survival time is short, with no effective
   treatment options. The aims of this prospective, noncontrolled clinical
   trial were to investigate outcome variables and safety profile of
   toceranib, thalidomide and piroxicam with or without hypofractionated
   radiation therapy in dogs with measurable histologically confirmed
   inflammatory mammary carcinoma that underwent a complete staging.
   Eighteen dogs were enrolled: 14 received medical treatment, and 4 were
   treated with hypofractionated radiation therapy and medical therapy.
   Overall, median time to progression was 34 days and median survival time
   was 109 days. In dogs treated with medical therapy, overall response
   rate was 21\%, and clinical benefit rate (CBR) was 64\%; median time to
   progression was 28 days and median survival time was 59 days. In dogs
   receiving medical therapy and undergoing radiation therapy, overall
   response rate and clinical benefit rate were 100\%, with significantly
   longer time to progression (156 days) and survival time (180 days).
   Overall, treatment was well tolerated, with mild gastrointestinal and
   dermatological adverse events. Although the optimal treatment to this
   disease remains uncertain, the current approach consisting of systemic
   anti-angiogenic drugs with or without hypofractionated radiation
   therapy, provided clinical benefit in a significant proportion of dogs

Abstract = {{To manage a stressful stimulus animals react both behaviorally and
   physiologically to restore the homeostasis. In stable horses, a
   stressful stimulus can be represented by social separation, riding
   discomfort or the presence of novel objects in their environment.
   Although Heart Rate Variability is a common indicator of stress levels
   in horses, the behavioral mechanisms concurrently occurring under
   stressful conditions are still unknown. The sudden inflation of a
   balloon was administered to 33 horses. Video-recording of self-directed
   behaviors (snore, vacuum chewing, snort, head/body shaking) and
   monitoring of heart activity (HR and SDRR) were conducted for five
   minutes before (Pre-test) and after the stimulus administration
   (Stress-test). During the Stress-test, only snore and vacuum chewing
   increased and a significant increase was also recorded in both HR and
   SDRR. Moreover, the snore variation between the two conditions showed a
   significant correlation with the variation of both HR and SDRR. With the
   snore acting as stress-releasing behavior to restore basal condition,
   the homeostasis recovered via the enactment of such behavior could be
   physiologically expressed by an increasing vagal activity. Hence, the
   capacity to maintain homeostasis (resilience) could correspond to a
   prevalence of parasympathetic control on heart activity, intervening
   when certain behaviors are performed.}},

   Vertical transmission of the infection may also occurs in other species

Abstract = {{A multiclass screening method to detect fifty-three forbidden substances
   by liquid-chromatography coupled to hybrid high-resolution mass
   spectrometry (LC-Q-Orbitrap) was developed and validated in bovine bile
   and urine. Eight classes of compounds were included in the method's
   scope (beta-agonists, corticosteroids, nitroimidazoles, progestins,
   resorcylic acid lactones (RALs), sedatives, steroids and stilbenes) plus
   chloramphenicol and dapsone. After hydrolysis, the sample was divided in
   two aliquots, which followed two parallel purification steps. The
   reunified extracts were injected and two chromatographic runs performed
   in positive and negative ionization mode, respectively. The validation
   data (60 different samples per matrix) proved that the method was fit
   for purpose with detection capabilities lower than 1 mg L-1 in both
   matrices. The combined application of accurate mass acquisition and
   two-stage mass spectrometry (parallel reaction monitoring) was crucial
   to achieve suitable selectivity, which is the most critical parameter
   mainly for urines. Finally, the long-standing problem of the high rate
   of false positive results for RALs, due to the natural ingestion of
   mycotoxin, zearalenone, was taken on including all their labelled
   standards. That allowed a very satisfactory management of this screening
   test. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Application of different laboratory techniques to monitor the behaviour
   of a Mycoplasma synoviae vaccine (MS-H) in broiler breeders}},
Journal = {{BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundMycoplasma synoviae (MS) is a major poultry pathogen which
   causes severe economic losses in all the productive sectors. The
   prevalence of MS in European countries has increased in the last few
   years, leading to greater attention to the available methods to prevent
   its spread. The main strategy currently applied for its containment is
   the development and maintenance of MS-free breeder flocks. A live MS
   vaccine (MS-H) obtained by mutagenizing an Australian field strain has
   recently been introduced in Italy. The aim of the present study was to
   evaluate the vaccine behaviour in broiler breeder groups at different
   production stages and the effectiveness of the available laboratory
   tests in discriminating the MS-H from a field strain.ResultsThe vaccine
   diffused extensively through the population, shown by the wide
   serological response (over 80\% of positive samples in RSA and 85\% in
   ELISA), the high serological titres, the positivity of all the tracheal
   samples collected during the production phase by MS PCR and the
   positivity by cultivation from tracheal swabs at the end-point (55weeks
   after vaccination). In contrast, only one swab from a sternal bursa was
   positive in MS PCR, while all the joint and oviduct samples were
   negative. There was no evidence of vertical transmission. Different
   genotyping techniques were used to achieve a clear classification of the
   MS positive samples. The vlhA and the obg gene analysis showed that most
   of the strains were homologous with the vaccine, but some ambiguous
   samples were further investigated with the multi locus sequence typing
   (MLST) scheme which confirmed the homology.ConclusionsThe development of
   a multi-technique approach to monitor vaccinated avian flocks, based
   both on serological and biomolecular methods, is advised as well as the
   use of effective genotyping techniques to analyse the MS strains
   circulating in high densely populated poultry areas.}},

Journal = {{BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{NOV 13}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundStreptococcus agalactiae is pathogenic for both animals and
   humans. In dairy cattle it commonly causes mastitis, with great economic
   losses, and there is scientific evidence of mastitis, caseous
   lymphadenitis, contagious skin necrosis and purulent infections
   associated with S. agalactiae in camels (Camelus dromedarius) as well.
   In humans, it is a common component of the respiratory and
   gastrointestinal microflora, but it can also act as a pathogen,
   especially in elderly people and immunocompromised patients, as well as
   in pregrant women and newborns.Case presentationA 10-year old
   non-pregnant female llama (Lama glama) was conferred to the Institute
   for Animal Health Control, in Bolzano for necropsy after sudden death.
   The animal had not shown unusual behaviour and had a low to normal
   nutritional condition (body condition score 2/5). The breeder had
   reported a chronic suppurative subcutaneous infection in the
   intermandibular area, resistant to therapy (therapy unknown). After
   necropsy, several samples were processed for histological,
   bacteriological and parasitological examinations.ConclusionsThis report
   describes, to the best of our knowledge, the first isolation of S.
   agalactiae in llamas (Lama glama). The animal came from a herd that
   counts approximately 200 South American camelids (llamas, alpacas) along
   with several horses, chicken, rabbits, cats and dogs; this farm offers
   services, such as trekking and pet therapy activities.}},

Abstract = {{Lutzomyia migonei is incriminated as a vector of Leishmania
   braziliensis, the main causative agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis in
   Brazil. Recently, this phlebotomine sand fly species has been suggested
   as a vector for Leishmania infantum, which causes zoonotic visceral
   leishmaniasis. Considering the widespread distribution of Lu. migonei in
   South America, the existence of isolated populations has been
   hypothesized. Three Lu. migonei populations, two from north-eastern
   Brazil (Machados, Pernambuco State, and Baturite, Ceara State) and other
   from the south-eastern region (Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro State) were
   analysed both morphologically and genetically. Though no significant
   morphological differences were found amongst the sand fly specimens
   analysed, discriminant analysis based on specific morphometric
   characters (i.e., length of wing, antennal segment 3 and coxite for
   males, and length of wing and antennal segment 3 for females), showed
   that specimens from Machados were closer to Baturite than to NiterOi.
   The molecular analysis of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene sequences
   also supported this observation by the distinct separation of two
   monophyletic clades, grouping specimens from Machados and Baturite
   separately from those of Niteroi. Our results suggest the existence of
   different populations within the distribution range of Lu. migonei.
   Whether these populations are reproductively isolated and/or present
   differences in terms of vector competence/capacity for L. braziliensis
   and L. infantum needs to be further investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Control of one of the most important avian mycoplasmas, Mycoplasma
   synoviae, and tracing the spread of the infection can be challenging as
   the pathogen is transmissible by both horizontal and vertical routes,
   and it can be disseminated through long distances via the hatching eggs,
   day-old chicks or pullets during intensive international trade. Genetic
   information provided by molecular typing methods support control
   programmes and epizootiologic studies. The aims of the present study
   were to develop a multi-locus variable number of tandem repeats analysis
   (MLVA) method for the typing of M. synoviae isolates and to evaluate the
   currently used molecular typing methods which are applicable directly on
   clinical samples.
   Tandem repeat (TR) regions were selected from the whole genome sequence
   of the M. synoviae type strain (WVU1853) to characterise the genetic
   diversity of 86 M. synoviae strains originating from 15 countries. The
   strains were also submitted to multi-locus sequence typing (MLST)
   assays, vlhA gene sequence analysis and to assays designed to
   differentiate live vaccine strains from field strains.
   The developed MLVA involves the examination of seven TR regions and
   provides similar genetic resolution as the tested MLST assays by
   identifying 35 genotypes among the tested strains. Differentiation of
   the live vaccine strains from field strains was also successful with the
   developed assay.
   The provided MLVA method proved to be a highly discriminative, rapid and
   cost-effective alternative typing technique for the genetic
   characterisation of M. synoviae and it is also suitable for the
   complementation of live vaccine strain differentiating assays in
   ambiguous cases.}},

Abstract = {{Massive antimicrobial use in animal farming is considered as the
   greatest contributor to the presence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria
   (ARB) in food of animal origin. Nevertheless, sewage from treated
   animals may impact on vegetables grown on fertilised fields, but it is
   largely unknown whether and to what extent ARB are transferred to
   vegetables and the human gut. It could be hypothesised that food of
   animal and vegetal origin have a different role in ARB transfer to the
   human gut and that different diets could be characterised by different
   antimicrobial resistance gene (ARG) loads. This study included three
   groups comprising vegans (n=26), vegetarians (n=32) and omnivores (n =
   43). Metadata regarding food consumption and anthropometric parameters
   were collected. Gut microbial communities were investigated by 16S rDNA
   analysis. Four ARGs (sul2, tetA, bla TEm and strB) were quantified by
   qPCR. The results showed a lower total load of investigated ARGs in
   vegan diet (pairwise comparison adjusted results: omnivorous-vegan, P=
   0.0119; omnivorous-vegetarian, P= 0.7416; and vegan-vegetarian, P =
   0.0119). No significant differences in abundance of each gene separately
   were found between the three groups. Neither the amount of animal
   protein nor the occurrence of ARGs was significant in explaining
   differences in the gut microbial community of individuals, and a large
   proportion of the differences between community composition (PERMANOVA,
   46.87\%) was not explained by the analysed variables. The results
   support the role of omnivorous and vegetarian diets in accumulating
   ARGs, suggesting a possible role for animal-derived food consumption.

Journal = {{BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Background: Multi-drug methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
   pseudintermedius (MRSP) detection is rapidly increasing in microbial
   specimens from pets across Europe. MRSP has also been isolated from
   bitches and newborns in dog breeding kennels. This study assessed
   whether MRSP lineage differs between breeding kennels and is maintained
   over time. Post-partum bitches (at day 3 vaginal and day 3, 9 and 35
   milk samples) and their litters (at day 3, 9 and 35 oral and abdominal
   skin samples) from two Italian breeding kennels (A and B) were sampled
   and MRSP was subsequently characterized via whole-genome sequencing and
   antibiotic susceptibility testing. The study was carried out from
   October 2014 to March 2016 and included successive parturitions from the
   same animals.
   Results: The analysis revealed different situations in both investigated
   kennels. In kennel A, circulating strains were from 7-locus sequence
   types ST688, ST258 and closely related isolates of ST71, which included
   most isolates. In kennel B, only a new isolate, ST772, was detected. In
   addition, most isolates from both kennels had multi-resistant antibiotic
   profiles. MRSP was only isolated from litters of MRSP-positive bitches,
   thus suggesting that bitch-litter transmission is likely.
   Conclusions: Our data show that MRSP circulation can differ in different
   settings, that several clonal lineages can circulate together, and that
   vertical transmission appears common. MRSP colonization did not affect
   the health conditions of the bitches or of their litters.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction - A few large surveys on tumour prevalence in goats
   indicate that tumours in general are quite common in this species.
   Reviews of neoplastic diseases in goats indicate a prevalence ranging
   from 0,8 to 11\%. However, osteogenic tumours arising from facial bones
   in goats are rare. Regarding oral localization only a few mesenchymal
   tumours have been described arising from the gengiva.
   Case presentation - A 4-year old, female crossbred goat was referred
   with a history of dysorexia and a slow growing painful mass on the face.
   On physical examination the animal showed poor body condition and the
   left side of the face was deformed by a voluminous mass which, at the
   inspection of the oral cavity, displaced the maxillary teeth.
   Differential diagnoses included osteomyelitis and benign (osteoma,
   chondroma, ossifying and non ossifying fibroma, odontogenic tumours) as
   well as malignant (osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma) mesenchymal tumours
   arising from either the connective tissue and bone. The goat was
   euthanized because of the extension of the lesion and a complete
   necropsy was performed. Grossly, the face was deformed by the presence
   of a hard mass arising from the branch of the left mandible.
   Histologically the oral mass was composed of heterogeneous proliferation
   of malignant osteoblasts intermigled with brightly eosinophilic strands
   or island of osteoid matrix. Neoplastic cells, interpreted as malignant
   osteoblasts, were characterized by plump to round or spindle-shape
   morphology, with moderate basophilic cytoplasm and an eccentrically
   located voluminous nucleus containing a large prominent nucleolus.
   Mitotic figures were found and were either bipolar and atypical. At
   necropsy no metastases were found and the final diagnosis was
   non-metastasizing mandibular osteoblastic osteosarcoma.
   Conclusion - In conclusion, regardless the type of tumour, the goat was
   euthanized because of the extension and the severity of the lesion.
   Necropsy and histological examination were necessary to correctly
   classify the tumour as a non-metastasizing mandibular osteosarcoma.}},

Abstract = {{In February 2017 a case of Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS) was reported
   to the National Registry of HUS in an adult living in Northern Italy.
   Stool specimens from the patient and his family contacts were collected
   and the analyses led to the isolation of a Locus of Enterocyte
   Effacement (LEE)-negative Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2)-producing Escherichia
   coll. The epidemiological investigations performed brought to collect
   fecal samples from the animals reared in a farm held by the case's
   family and a mixture of bovine and swine feces proved positive for Shiga
   toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) and yielded the isolation of a
   LEE-negative stx2-positive E. coli strain. Further characterization by
   whole genome sequencing led to identify the isolates as two identical
   O2:H27 hybrid Enterotoxigenic Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (ETEC-STEC).
   Sequencing of a high molecular weight plasmid present in the human
   isolate disclosed a peculiar plasmid harboring virulence genes
   characteristic for both pathotypes, including the enterohemolysin-coding
   gene and sta1, encoding the heat stable enterotoxin. Moreover, a
   complete fae locus encoding the ETEC F4 fimbriae could be identified,
   including a novel variant of faeG gene responsible for the production of
   the main structural subunit of the fimbriae. This novel faeG showed
   great diversity in the nucleotidic sequence when compared with the
   reference genes encoding the swine F4 allelic variants, whereas at the
   amino acid sequence level the predicted protein sequence showed some
   similarity with FaeG from E. coli strains of bovine origin. Further
   investigation on the plasmid region harboring the newly identified faeG
   allelic variant allowed to identify similar plasmids in NCBI sequence
   database, as part of the genome of other previously uncharacterized
   ETEC-STEC strains of bovine origin, suggesting that the novel F4-like
   fimbriae may play a role in bovine host specificity.}},

Abstract = {{There is currently an increased interest in the use of serological
   approaches in combination with traditional cell- mediated immunity-based
   techniques to improve the detection of tuberculosis (TB)-infected
   animals. In the present study, we developed and validated two different
   serological TB-detection assays using four antigens, MPB70, MPB83, ESAT6
   and CFP10, and the tuberculin PPDb. A conventional multi-antigen
   TB-ELISA method and a novel TB multiplex test, based on Luminex
   technology, were developed to detect antibodies to multiple antigen
   targets. The performance levels of the two tests were evaluated and
   compared using selected panels of samples having known TB states. The
   TB-ELISA test (containing five antigens, including PPDb) had a
   sensitivity (Se) of 74.2\% and a specificity (Sp) of 94.9\%, while the
   TB-Luminex test had higher Se (79.0\%) and Sp (99.1\%) rates even when
   only one reactive antigen was used to classify the test as positive. If
   a more restrictive criterion, requiring two positive antigens to
   classify the test as positive, was used, then the TB-ELISA's Sp rate
   increased to 99.8\% but the Se decreased to 61.3\%, while the TB-Luminex
   test's Sp rate increased to 100\% but the Se decreased to 51.2\%.
   TB-ELISA and TB-Luminex were applied to a panel of 257 sera collected
   from bTB-positive herds, as determined by a post-mortem inspection. They
   showed good performance levels, identifying 49 (80.3\%) and 48 (78.7\%),
   respectively, of 61 samples that had tested positive by the intradermal
   tuberculin (IDT) test and/or interferon-gamma assay. In addition,
   TB-ELISA and TB-Luminex were able to identify 60 and 42 samples as
   positive, respectively, out of the 196 samples that tested negative to
   IDT and interferon-gamma at the time of serum collection. Subsequent IDT
   tests performed after 1-2 months, confirmed the positivity of 18
   samples, indicating the strategic value of having two serological assays
   to detect TB-infected herds that were not reactive to initial IDT
   testing, thereby allowing for the rapid control of outbreaks and
   eradication of the disease.}},

Abstract = {{Prompt and accurate diagnosis is warranted for infectious diseases of
   domestic animals which may have a significant impact on animal
   production or clinical practice. In this study, the identification and
   genetic characterization of a bovine enterovirus (BEV) strain isolated
   from a calf with diarrhea, are described. Two different next generation
   sequencing platforms were employed. Shotgun metagenomic accomplished by
   MinION sequencing (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) allowed the
   identification of BEV RNA from a cell-culture isolate. BEV was then
   confirmed by a specific real time RT-PCR assay. To achieve the whole
   genome of this isolate, sequence reads obtained by MinION were coupled
   with those originating from NextSeq500 (Illumina). Genomic relatedness
   and phylogeny with extant BEV strains is also reported. Overall, this
   manuscript highlights the use of the portable MinION sequence technology
   as a tool for support diagnostics in veterinary practice.}},

Title = {{West Nile virus transmission and human infection risk in Veneto (Italy):
   a modelling analysis}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{SEP 18}},
Abstract = {{An intensified and continuous West Nile virus (WNV) spread across
   northern Italy has been observed since 2008, which caused more than one
   hundred reported human infections until 2016. Veneto is one of the
   Italian regions where WNV is considered endemic, and the greatest
   intensity of circulation was observed during 2013 and 2016. By using
   entomological data collected across the region in those years, we
   calibrated a temperature-driven mathematical model through a Bayesian
   approach that simulates the WNV infection in an avian population with
   seasonal demography. We considered two alternative routes of life cycle
   re-activation of the virus at the beginning of each vector breeding
   season: in the first one the virus is maintained by infected birds, in
   the other by diapausing mosquitoes previously infected. Afterwards, we
   computed seasonal risk curves for human infection and quantified how
   they translate into reported symptomatic cases. According to our
   results, WNV is more likely to be re-activated each year via previously
   infected mosquitoes. The highest probability of human infection is
   expected to occur in August, consistently with observations. Our
   epidemiological estimates can be of particular interest for public
   health authorities, to support decisions in term of designing efficient
   surveillance plans and preventive measures.}},

Abstract = {{Edible insects are expected to become an important nutrient source for
   animals and humans in the Western world in the near future. However,
   before insects can be put on the market, the safety of their use for
   feed and food is warranted. This literature study was prepared to
   provide an overview of the actual knowledge of possible food safety
   hazards, including chemical, microbiological, and allergenic agents and
   prions, to human and animal health upon the use of insects for food and
   feed, and to highlight data gaps and suggest the way forward. From the
   data available, heavy metals of concern are cadmium in black soldier fly
   and arsenic in yellow mealworm larvae. Investigated mycotoxins do not
   seem to accumulate. Residues of pesticides, veterinary drugs, and
   hormones, as well as dioxins and PCBs, are sometimes found in insects.
   Contamination of insects with pathogens to human health is a consequence
   of a combination of the substrates used and the farming and processing
   steps applied. Insects harbor a wide variety of microorganisms, and some
   human pathogenic bacteria may be present. In addition, insects may
   harbor and transmit parasites. There is no evidence so far insects may
   harbor pathogenic viruses or prions, but they may act as vectors.
   Insects and insect-derived products may have allergenic potential. In
   this review, evidence on some safety aspects is displayed, and data gaps
   are identified. Recommendations are given for future research to fill
   the most relevant data gaps.}},

Journal = {{VETERINARY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{49}},
Month = {{AUG 29}},
Abstract = {{Since 1997, G1-lineage H9N2 avian influenza viruses have been
   circulating in Asia and later on in the Middle East, and they have been
   associated to mild respiratory disease, drops in egg production and
   moderate mortality in chickens, in particular in the presence of
   concurrent infections. In this study, we investigated the importance of
   the G1-lineage H9N2 A/chicken/Israel/1163/2011 virus as a primary
   pathogen in layers, analyzing its tropism and binding affinity for the
   oviduct tissues, and investigating the long-term impact on egg
   production. Besides causing a mild respiratory infection, the virus
   replicated in the oviduct of 60\% of the hens causing different degrees
   of salpingitis throughout the organ, in particular at the level of the
   infundibulum, where the detection of the virus was associated with
   severe heterophilic infiltrate, and necrosis of the epithelium. Binding
   affinity assays confirmed that the infundibulum was the most receptive
   region of the oviduct. The drop in egg production was at its peek at 2
   weeks post-infection (pi) (60\% decrease) and continued up to 80 days pi
   (35\% decrease). On day 80 pi, non-laying birds showed egg yolk
   peritonitis, and histopathological analyses described profound
   alteration of the infundibulum architecture, duct ectasia and thinning
   of the epithelium, while the rest of the oviduct and ovary appeared
   normal. Our results show that this H9N2 virus is a primary pathogen in
   layer hens, and that its replication in the infundibulum is responsible
   for acute and chronic lesions that limits the effective functionality of
   the oviduct, compromising the commercial life of birds.}},

Abstract = {{Antibiotic resistance is a rising threat for human health. Although in
   clinical settings and terrestrial environments the rise of antibiotic
   resistant bacteria is well documented, their dissemination and spread in
   the marine environment, covering almost two-thirds of the Earth's
   surface, is still poorly understood. In this study, the presence and
   abundance of sulphonamide resistance gene (sul2) and class 1
   integron-integrase gene (intI1), used as markers for the occurrence and
   spread of antibiotic resistance genes since the beginning of the
   antibiotic era, were investigated. Twenty-nine archived formalin-fixed
   samples, collected by the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey in
   the Atlantic Ocean and North Sea from 1970 to 2011, were analysed using
   Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) applied for the first time on CPR samples.
   The two marker genes were present in a large fraction of the samples
   (48\% for sul2 and 76\% for intI1). In contrast, results from Real-Time
   PCR performed on the same samples greatly underestimate their occurrence
   (21\% for sul2 and 52\% for intI1). Overall, besides providing
   successful use of ddPCR for the molecular analysis of CPR samples, this

Abstract = {{Drinking water for poultry is not subject to particular microbiological,
   chemical and physical requirements, thereby representing a potential
   transmission route for pathogenic microorganisms and contaminants and/or
   becoming unsuitable for watera-dministered medications. This study
   assessed the microbiological, chemical and physical drinking water
   quality of 28 turkey farms in North-Eastern Italy: 14 supplied with tap
   water (TW) and 14 with well water (WW). Water salinity, hardness, pH,
   ammonia, sulphate, phosphate, nitrate, chromium, copper and iron levels
   were also assessed. Moreover, total bacterial count at 22'C, presence
   and enumeration of Enterococcus spp. and E. coli, presence of Salmonella
   spp. and Campylobacter spp. were quantified. A water sample was
   collected in winter and in summer at 3 sampling sites: the water source
   (A), the beginning (B) and the end (C) of the nipple line (168 samples
   in total). Chemical and physical quality of both TW and WW sources was
   mostly within the limits of TW for humans. However, high levels of
   hardness and iron were evidenced in both sources. In WW vs. TW, sulphate
   and salinity levels were significantly higher, whilst pH and nitrate
   levels were significantly lower. At site A, microbiological quality of
   WW and TW was mostly within the limit of TW for humans. However, both
   sources had a significantly lower microbiological quality at sites B and
   C. Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype Kentucky was isolated
   only twice from WW. Campylobacter spp. were rarely isolated (3.6\% of
   farms); however, Campylobacter spp. farm-level prevalence by real-time
   PCR was up to 43\% for both water sources. Winter posed at higher risk
   than summer for Campylobacter spp. presence in water, whereas no
   significant associations were found with water source, site,
   recirculation system, and turkey age. Low salinity and high hardness
   were significant risk factors for C. coli and C. jejuni presence,
   respectively. These results show the need of improving sanitization of
   drinking water pipelines for commercial turkeys.}},

Abstract = {{During oestrus, fattening female pigs are more prone to lameness,

   age (180 +/- 10 kg) for dry-cured ham production. An immunocastrated
   control group was used for comparison. In all, 56 15-week-old female
   pigs, individually identifiable by back tattoos were equally distributed
   among four pens. All animals from two pens were subject to a three-dose
   immunocastration schedule at 16, 20 and 32 weeks of age. Skin lesions

   ovaries were weighed, measured and histologically examined; stomachs,
   carcasses and lungs were scored for lesions and a further blood sample
   was taken. Immunocastrated pigs did not significantly differ from
   controls in growth rate, feed efficiency and slaughter performances

   lower frequency of aggressive interactions at 33 and 36 weeks, lower
   front lesions at 28 weeks, but higher at 30 weeks; a lower haptoglobin
   level at 28 weeks, a lower level of cortisol and back lesions at

   isolated from different sources in an artisanal dairy plant in Italy
   were identified and typed using MALDI-TOF and compared with their
   multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed field gel electrophoresis
   (PFGE) profiles found in previous studies. MALDI-TOF correctly
   identified all the isolates to species level. No clearly delineated
   clusters appeared on dendrograms based on either the complete spectra or
   the significant peaks, but nine clusters were defined using the
   cophenetic correlation. Interestingly, MALDI-TOF proved able to
   discriminate A. butzleri strains below species level, confirming its
   potential use for epidemiological surveys. As expected, the comparative
   analysis with PFGE and MLST showed that the discriminatory index was
   lower for MALDI-TOF but roughly comparable to sequence types and
   pulsotypes. MALDI-TOF appears to be a relatively low cost answer to the
   urgent need for more rapid, less expensive typing tools suitable for
   source attribution studies, readily allowing multiple typing methods to
   be combined. This study provides insights into MALDI-TOF as potential
   epidemiological tool. Its application in healthcare surveillance systems
   awaits further exploration to encourage interaction and convergence

Title = {{Biological compatibility between two temperate lineages of brown dog

Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JUL 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: The brown dog tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus (sensu stricto)
   is reputed to be the most widespread tick of domestic dogs worldwide and
   has also been implicated in the transmission of many pathogens to dogs
   and humans. For more than two centuries, Rh. sanguineus (s.s.) was
   regarded as a single taxon, even considering its poor original
   description and the inexistence of a type specimen. However, genetic and
   crossbreeding experiments have indicated the existence of at least two
   distinct taxa within this name: the so-called temperate and tropical
   lineages of Rh. sanguineus (sensu lato). Recent genetic studies have
   also demonstrated the existence of additional lineages of Rh. sanguineus
   (s.l.) in Europe and Asia. Herein, we assessed the biological
   compatibility between two lineages of Rh. sanguineus (s.l.) found in
   southern Europe, namely Rhipicephalus sp. I (from Italy) and
   Rhipicephalus sp. II (from Portugal).
   Methods: Ticks morphologically identified as Rh. sanguineus (s.l.) were
   collected in southern Portugal and southern Italy. Tick colonies were
   established and crossbreeding experiments conducted. Morphological,
   biological and genetic analyses were conducted.
   Results: Crossbreeding experiments confirmed that ticks from the two
   studied lineages were able to mate and generate fertile hybrids. Hybrid
   adult ticks always presented the same genotype of the mother, confirming
   maternal inheritance of mtDNA. However, larvae and nymphs originated
   from Rhipicephalus sp. I females presented mtDNA genotype of either
   Rhipicephalus sp. I or Rhipicephalus sp. II, suggesting the occurrence
   of paternal inheritance or mitochondrial heteroplasmy. While
   biologically compatible, these lineages are distinct genetically and
   phenotypically.
   Conclusions: The temperate lineages of Rh. sanguineus (s.l.) studied
   herein are biologically compatible and genetic data obtained from both
   pure and hybrid lines indicate the occurrence of paternal inheritance or
   mitochondrial heteroplasmy. This study opens new research avenues and
   raises question regarding the usefulness of genetic data and
   crossbreeding experiments as criteria for the definition of cryptic
   species in ticks.}},

   and 2019), 15 (for the years 2020-2024) and 10 (starting from 2025) of
   50 neck skin samples of broiler carcasses could be an effective measure
   to reduce the incidence of human campylobacteriosis. In order to
   stimulate the poultry industry to improve the control of Campylobacter
   along the slaughter-line, the quantification of indicator bacteria such
   as Escherichia coli or Enterobacteriaceae could be a useful strategy.
   The aims of this study were: a) to investigate the possible relationship
   between Campylobacter and indicator bacteria counts at two different
   points of the broiler slaughter-line and b) to evaluate the probability
   that carcasses have Campylobacter counts above 10(3) CFU/g in relation
   to indicator bacteria counts. E. coli, Enterobacteriaceae and
   Campylobacter were simultaneously enumerated on neck skin samples of
   broiler carcasses sampled at the post-evisceration (n = 75) and at the
   post-chilling points (n = 75) of three Italian poultry slaughterhouses.
   In general, the log counts of all the investigated microorganisms were
   significantly lower at the post-chilling point, and the indicator
   bacteria (E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae) counts were significantly
   higher than Campylobacter counts at both sampling points. A multilevel
   linear mixed model, relating the Campylobacter log(10) counts with the
   E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae log(10) counts, showed that the
   Campylobacter log(10) counts increased significantly for every
   additional E. coli log(10) count, and this was more evident at the
   post-chilling than at the post-evisceration sampling point. With regards
   to the Enterobacteriaceae, the increase was similar at the two sampling
   points. An additional model, developed to assess the probability that
   carcasses would have Campylobacter counts above 3 log(10) CFU/g, showed
   that this probability increased significantly if the level of E. coli
   count also increased. Carcasses classified as Campylobacter > 3 log(10)
   CFU/g according to the observed results of E. coli >= 4 log(10) CFU/g
   did have high Campylobacter counts. Conversely, it was not possible to
   conclude anything for carcasses with E. coli < 4 log(10) CFU/g. These
   findings support the hypothesis that the monitoring of poultry carcasses
   for E. coli load could be useful to identify those heavily contaminated
   with Campylobacter, in order to implement control measures on the farms
   of origin of such batches, or improving the slaughter process of the
   plants where the heavily contaminated batches are found.}},

Abstract = {{Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) is a naked double-stranded
   RNA virus with a bi-segmented genome that is classified within the
   family Birnaviridae, genus Aquabirnavirus. IPNV was first detected in
   Italian trout farms in the late 1970s and ultimately became endemic. To
   characterize the evolution of IPNV circulating in Italy, particularly
   whether there is a link between evolutionary rate and virulence, we
   obtained and analyzed the VP1 (polymerase) and the pVP2 (major capsid
   protein precursor) sequences from 75 IPNV strains sampled between 1978
   and 2017. These data revealed that the Italian IPNV exhibit relatively
   little genetic variation over the sampling period, falling into four
   genetic clusters within a single genogroup (group 2 for VP1 and
   genogroup V for pVP2) and contained one example of inter-segment
   reassortment. The mean evolutionary rates for VP1 and pVP2 were
   estimated to be 1.70 and 1.45 x 10(-4) nucleotide substitutions per
   site, per year, respectively, and hence significantly lower than those
   seen in other Birnaviruses. Similarly, the relatively low ratios of
   non-synonymous (d(N)) to synonymous (d(S)) nucleotide substitutions per
   site in both genes indicated that IPNV was subject to strong selective
   constraints, again in contrast to other RNA viruses infecting salmonids
   that co-circulate in the same area during the same time period. Notably,
   all the Italian IPNV harbored a proline at position 217 (P-217) and a
   threonine at position 221 (T-221) in pVP2, both of which are associated
   with a low virulence phenotype. We therefore suggest the lower virulence
   of IPNV may have resulted in reduced rates of virus replication and
   hence lower rates of evolutionary change. The data generated here will
   be of importance in understanding the factors that shape the evolution
   of Aquabirnaviruses in nature.}},

Abstract = {{The virulence gene profile of 26 rabbit enteropathogenic Escherichia
   coli strains, isolated from 17 colibacillosis outbreaks located in two
   regions of Northern Italy, was determined using an Echerichia coli
   virulence DNA microarray. All strains were classified according to their
   determined biotype, sero-and phylo-group. The distribution of virulence
   genes encoding for the Locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), LEE type
   III secretion system (T3SS), non-LEE T3SS translocated proteins and
   adherence factors was also determined. All strains but one belonged to
   phylogroups A and B1. A prevalent association between the O103 serogroup
   with the rhamnose-negative phenotype (biotype 12 or 14) was found. The
   most prevalent LEE profile found in tested strains was
   ler/cesT/espA-1/espB-3/tir-1/eae(beta)/espD-2/escN/eprJ. All strains
   possessed either the adhesive factor rabbit-2 (afr/2) or the plasmid
   Rabbit adherence locus (ral) gene and 24 of them an additional
   individual or combined set of colonization factors efa1/lifA, lpfA and
   paa genes. Finally, the combined or single presence of a set of LEE
   and/or non-LEE effector proteins encoding genes, namely espG, cif, map
   and nle family genes, attested to the genetic potential of investigated
   strains to induce pathologic lesions to the host. The application of
   microarray-based technologies in assessing the genetic profile of rabbit
   E. coli is a reliable, cost-effective candidate for large scale
   investigations in monitoring programs aimed to survey the circulation of
   pathogenic strains within rabbit production units, their zoonotic
   genetic potential and to select E. coli strains eligible for vaccinal
   prophylaxis in fattening rabbit production.}},

   culture allowed the subsequent identification of a rhabdovirus,
   tentatively named ictalurid rhabdovirus (IcRV), through electron
   microscopy, immunofluorescence and whole genome sequencing (WGS). The
   newly isolated virus, together with 14 additional viral strains stored

   period 1993-2016, was phylogenetically analysed on the basis of the
   nucleoprotein and the glycoprotein nucleotide and amino acid sequences.
   The genetic distances among Italian IcRV strains were also estimated.
   Our results show that all the IcRV strains belong to the genus
   Sprivivirus and are closely related to the tench rhabdovirus (TenRV).
   Italian catfish production is constantly decreasing, mainly due to viral
   infections, which include the newly characterized IcRV. Data presented

Abstract = {{The oomycete Aphanomyces astaci causes crayfish plague, the most
   important disease of European freshwater crayfish species. Presumably
   introduced into Europe 150 years ago with the import of North American
   crayfish, A. astaci is highly pathogenic to European crayfish species.
   Five genotypes (A, B, C, D, and E) have been defined based on random
   amplified polymorphic DNA analysis (RAPD-PCR) from A. astaci pure
   cultures. The distinction of genotypes is an essential tool to conduct
   molecular epidemiological studies on crayfish plague and it has been
   used to clarify and better understand the history and spread of this
   disease in Europe. Whereas RAPD-PCR requires DNA from pure culture
   isolates, the development of genotyping tools that can be applied to DNA
   extracted from clinical samples allows a much wider application of
   genotyping studies, including revisiting historic samples. In this
   study, we present a new approach that adds to currently available
   methods for genotyping A. astaci strains directly from clinical crayfish
   samples. Whole-genome sequencing of A. astaci strains representing all
   currently known genotypes was employed, genomic regions unique to the
   respective genotype identified, and a PCR-based genotyping assay
   designed, which focuses on the presence/absence of PCR product after
   amplification with the genotype-specific primers. Our diagnostic
   methodology was tested using DNA extracts from pure A. astaci cultures,
   other Aphanomyces species and additional oomycetes, samples from a
   recent Italian crayfish plague outbreak and additional historical
   samples available in the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and
   Aquaculture Science laboratory. The new markers were reliable for pure
   culture and clinical samples from a recent outbreak and successfully
   discriminated genotype A, B, D, and E. The marker for genotype C
   required an additional sequencing step of the generated PCR product to
   confirm genotype.}},

Abstract = {{The human microbiota is a complex ecological community of commensal,

   Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, in particular targeted
   amplicon sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (16S-seq), are
   enabling the identification and quantification of human-resident
   microorganisms at unprecedented resolution, providing novel insights
   into the role of the microbiota in health and disease. Once microbial
   abundances are quantified through NGS data analysis, diversity indices
   provide valuable mathematical tools to describe the ecological
   complexity of a single sample or to detect species differences between
   samples. However, diversity is not a determined physical quantity for
   which a consensus definition and unit of measure have been established,
   and several diversity indices are currently available. Furthermore, they
   were originally developed for macroecology and their robustness to the
   possible bias introduced by sequencing has not been characterized so
   far. To assist the reader with the selection and interpretation of
   diversity measures, we review a panel of broadly used indices,

   characterize their behaviour and criticalities in dependence of the data
   features using simulated data as ground truth. In addition, we make

   stated that labels must be accurate and provide detailed information on
   the ingredients, mislabeling of pet food has been documented by several
   authors. This phenomenon is of particular concern when related to
   products used as elimination diets for the diagnosis of adverse food
   reaction (AFR) in dogs and cats because the presence of undeclared
   ingredients may negatively interfere with the trial and prevent the
   veterinarian from making an appropriate diagnosis. The aim of this study
   was to shed light upon the problem of contamination and mislabeling in
   both dry and wet novel protein diets (NPDs) and hydrolyzed protein diets
   (HPDs) using a microarray-based commercial kit which tests for the
   presence of 19 animal species.
   Results: Of the 40 analyzed products (9 dry NPDs, 22 wet NPDs, 6 dry
   HPDs and 3 wet HPDs), ten presented a content that correctly matched the
   label, while five did not contain the declared animal species,
   twenty-three revealed the presence of undeclared animal species, and two
   had a vague label that did not allow the evaluation of its accuracy. The
   most frequently contaminants identified in both dry and wet pet foods
   were pork, chicken and turkey. The presence of undeclared animal species
   was higher in dry than wet pet foods; furthermore, a lower number of
   contaminating animal species was identified in HPDs than NPDs (4 vs 10),
   and a lower number of contaminated HPDs (6 out of 9, 67\%) than
   contaminated NPDs was detected (24 out of 31, 77\%). Thirteen out of 14
   brands tested presented at least one mislabeled product.
   Conclusions: Mislabeling seems to be a widespread issue in pet foods
   used as elimination diets. Contamination can occur in all types of
   products used for the purpose, although dry NPDs are the main issue. Due
   to the high risk of contamination, particular attention should be given
   to both the selection of raw material suppliers and the production
   process.}},

Abstract = {{The implementation of the European Union strategy for
   polychlorodibenzo-dioxins and -furans (PCDD/Fs), and dioxin-like
   polychlorobiphenyls (DL-PCBs) is determining a general reduction of
   their presence in the environment and in the food chain. The most
   important route for human exposure to these substances is food
   consumption and, as a consequence, a progressive decrease of their
   dietary intake has been observed in the last decades. In this context,
   it seemed worth updating the PCDD/F and DL-PCB intake estimation for the
   Italian population. A total of 2659 samples of food of animal and
   vegetable origin analyzed for PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs in the period
   2013-2016 by accredited official laboratories and the national food
   consumption database were considered for the dietary intake assessment
   in different age groups of the Italian general population The median
   cumulative intake estimates expressed as pg WHO-TEQ/kg body weight per
   day and computed with a deterministic and a probabilistic approach were
   1.40-1.52 for children, 0.82-0.85 for adolescents, and 0.64-0.61 for
   adults, respectively. Such results confirm the decreasing trend of
   PCDD/F and DL-PCB dietary intake even though the Tolerable Daily
   Intake(TDI) value of 2 WHO-TEQ/kg body weight per day is exceeded at the
   95th percentile for all age groups, with children as sensitive group.
   Most contributing food categories to the intake resulted fish, food of
   vegetable origin, and cheese. A sensitivity analysis was also performed
   to calculate the target contamination levels able to keep the dietary
   exposure below the TDI. Computed target levels fall between P50 and P97
   of the occurrence distribution of the main food groups, meaning that
   most of the Italian food production can be considered safe. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{The arrival of infected travelers from endemic regions can trigger
   sustained autochthonous transmission of mosquito-borne pathogens in
   Europe. In 2007 a Chikungunya outbreak was observed in central Italy,
   mostly affecting two villages characterised by a high density of Aedes
   albopictus. The outbreak was mitigated through intervention strategies
   reducing the mosquito abundance. Ten years later, in 2017, sustained
   Chikungunya transmission was documented in both central and southern
   Italy. The proposed analysis identifies suitable reactive measures for
   the containment and mitigation of future epidemics by combining
   epidemiological modeling with a health economic approach, considering
   different arrival times of imported infections and possible delays in
   the notification of cases. Obtained estimates suggest that, if the first
   notification will occur in the middle of the mosquito breeding season,
   the combination of larvicides, adulticides and breeding sites removal
   represents the optimal strategy. In particular, we found that
   interventions implemented in 2007 were cost-effective, with about 3200
   prevented cases, 1450 DALYs averted and (sic)13.5 M saved. Moreover,
   larvicides are proven to be more cost beneficial in early summer and
   warmer seasons, while adulticides should be preferred in autumn and
   colder seasons. Our results provide useful indications supporting urgent
   decision-making of public health authorities in response to emerging
   mosquito-borne epidemics.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: This work characterised the antimicrobial susceptibility of
   uropathogens isolated from empirically treated dogs and cats.
   Within-household transmission of uropathogens can involve humans and
   companion animals. Knowledge on the prevalence and susceptibility
   pattern of isolates from canine and feline urine samples and the impact
   of prior antimicrobial treatment is important to prevent the
   dissemination of antimicrobial resistance.
   Methods: A retrospective study was conducted selecting
   antibiotic-treated companion animals. Urine samples were collected by
   cystocentesis and were submitted to an Italian diagnostic laboratory
   over a 2-year period (2013-2015). The antimicrobial susceptibility of
   the isolates was analysed both using Clinical and Laboratory Standards
   Institute (CLSI) guidelines and a formula to help select rational
   antimicrobial therapy.
   Results: Gram-negative bacteria were clearly prevalent. Gentamicin had
   the highest impact factors. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and doxycycline
   appeared to be the most effective compounds against Grampositive
   infections, whilst marbofloxacin may be a useful option against
   Gram-negative urinary tract infections (UTIs) as well as doxycycline and
   trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in cats and dogs, respectively. Consulting
   published studies, a comparable overall trend regarding bacterial
   species incriminated in canine and feline UTIs and their
   susceptibilities seems likely, despite different circumstances where the
   studies were conducted.
   Conclusions: Companion animals are potential reservoirs of
   drug-resistant uropathogens. Judicious use of antibiotics is necessary
   to maintain the efficacy of antimicrobials in human and veterinary
   medicine. Antimicrobial susceptibility monitoring programmes are
   therefore essential to facilitate the choice of antimicrobial agent that
   is most likely to be effective, particularly in cases of prior
   antimicrobial treatment. (C) 2018 International Society for Chemotherapy

Abstract = {{The presence of botulinum neurotoxin-producing Clostridia (BPC) in food
   sources is a public health concern. In favorable environmental
   conditions, BPC can produce botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) outside or
   inside the vertebrate host, leading to intoxications or
   toxico-infectious forms of botulism, respectively. BPC in food are
   almost invariably detected either by PCR protocols targeted at the known
   neurotoxin-encoding genes, or by the mouse test to assay for the
   presence of BoNTs in the supernatants of enrichment broths inoculated
   with the tested food sample. The sample is considered positive for BPC
   when the supernatant contains toxic substances that are lethal to mice,
   heat-labile and neutralized in vivo by appropriate polyclonal antibodies
   raised against purified BoNTs of different serotypes. Here, we report
   the detection in a food sample of a Clostridium tetani strain that
   produces tetanus neurotoxins (TeNTs) with the above-mentioned
   characteristics: lethal for mice, heat-labile and neutralized by
   botulinum antitoxin type B. Notably, neutralization occurred with two
   different commercially available type B antitoxins, but not with type A,
   C, D, E and F antitoxins. Although TeNT and BoNT fold very similarly,
   evidence that antitoxin B antiserum can neutralize the neurotoxic effect
   of TeNT in vivo has not been documented before. The presence of C.
   tetani strains in food can produce misleading results in BPC detection
   using the mouse test.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUNDAedes albopictus has spread during the last few decades all
   over the world. This has increased significantly the risk of exotic
   arbovirus transmission (e.g. chikungunya, dengue, and Zika) also in
   temperate areas, as demonstrated by the Chikungunya 2007 and 2017
   outbreaks in northeastern and central Italy. Insecticides are an
   important tool for limiting the circulation of these mosquito-borne
   viruses. The aim of the present study was to address the gap in current
   knowledge of pyrethroid insecticide resistance of European Ae.
   albopictus populations, focusing on populations from Italy, Albania and
   Greece.
   RESULTSBioassays for resistance to permethrin (0.75\%), -cypermethrin
   (0.05\%) or deltamethrin (0.05\%) were performed according to World
   Health Organization (WHO) protocols and showed reduced susceptibility
   (<90\% mortality) of some Italian populations to permethrin and
   -cypermethrin, but not to deltamethrin.
   CONCLUSIONThis study reports the first evidence of resistance to
   pyrethroids in adult Italian Ae. albopictus populations. Results refer
   to the season preceding the Chikungunya 2017 outbreak in central Italy
   and highlight the need to increase efforts to monitor the spread of
   insecticide resistance and the need to develop strategies to limit the
   spread of insecticide resistance, particularly in areas where extensive
   treatments have been carried out to contain disease outbreaks. (c) 2017

Abstract = {{Despite the well-known importance of an adequate colostral
   immunoglobulin (Ig) transfer to calf health and survival, failed
   transfer of passive immunity (FTPI) remains a widespread problem in
   dairy farming. The aim of this study was to investigate the management
   factors associated with FTPI in newborn calves, evaluating particularly
   the combined effect of delivery time, amount and quality of the first
   colostrum meal. The study was conducted from March to August 2014 on 21
   Italian dairy farms. Farmers were asked as first to answer a farm-level
   questionnaire on calf management. Blood sampling was then performed on
   overall 244 calves (1 to 5 days of age) born from Holstein cows, and a
   sample of the first colostrum meal of each calf was collected.
   Individual information on calves and the respective colostrum management
   were recorded. Serum and colostrum Ig concentrations were assessed by
   electrophoresis. A mixed effects multivariable logistic regression model
   was used to investigate the association of the variables obtained from
   both the management questionnaire and the individual calf data with FTPI
   (calf serum Ig concentration <10.0 g/l). A cumulative colostrum
   management score (CMS) that considered delivery time, amount and quality
   of the first colostrum meal was generated for 236 calves, with higher
   values indicating better colostrum management. Overall, 41.0\% of the
   calves were found having FTPI, and within-farm percentage of FTPI was
   over 20.0\% in 71.4\% of the farms. The risk of having FTPI was higher
   both for Holstein purebred calves compared with Holstein-beef crossbreds
   and for females compared with males. Moreover, it increased by 13\% with
   every hour of delay of the first colostrum meal provision since birth,
   whereas it decreased by 59\% and 3\%, respectively, with every
   additional liter of colostrum given and every additional gram of Ig per
   liter contained in the colostrum fed. Calf serum Ig concentration varied
   significantly according to the CMS, increasing by 1.53 g/l with every
   additional CMS point. In order to completely avoid FTPI, calves should
   receive at least 2.5 l of high-quality colostrum (Ig concentration >87.6
   g/l) within 1.0 h from birth. Considerable improvements are still needed
   about colostrum management for newborn calves in dairy farms. The
   results of this study will help in developing farm-specific programs for
   reducing the occurrence of FTPI.}},

   Overall, OsHV-1-PT displays typical microvariant OsHV-1 genome features,
   while few polymorphisms (0.08 \%) determine its uniqueness. As little is
   known about the genetic determinants of OsHV-1 virulence, comparing

Abstract = {{BackgroundOptimal procedure for storage of feline blood is needed.
   Open-collection systems have been employed in feline medicine, thus
   limiting the possibility for storage.
   ObjectivesTo evaluate indicators of quality of feline blood stored for
   35 days at +4 degrees C in a closed-collection system specifically
   designed for cats.
   AnimalsEight healthy adult European domestic shorthair cats with a
   weight of 5-6.8 kg.
   MethodsThis is a case series study. A bacteriological test, CBC, blood
   smear, pH, osmotic fragility, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), and
   adenosine triphosphate (ATP) measurement were performed weekly on whole
   blood (WB) units from day 1 to day 35 after donation. The hemolysis
   index, lactate and potassium concentrations, prothrombin time (PT),
   activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and fibrinogen were
   measured on plasma aliquots.
   ResultsOne out of eight blood units (BUs) had bacterial growth (Serratia
   marcescens) at day 35. No significant differences were found regarding
   CBC, morphology, pH, and osmotic fragility. Despite high
   inter-individual variability and low starting levels, significant
   decreases in the mean concentrations of 2,3-DPG (T0 1.99 mmol/g Hb, SD
   0.52, T35 1.25 mmol/g Hb, SD 1.43; P=.003) and ATP (T0 1.45 mmol/g Hb,
   SD 0.71, T35 0.62 mmol/g Hb, SD 0.51; P<.001) were detected during the
   study, as opposed to an increase in hemolysis (T0 0.11 mmol/L, SD 0.07,
   T35 0.84 mmol/L, SD 0.19; P<.001), lactate (T0 3.30 mmol/L, SD 0.86, T35
   13.36 mmol/L, SD 2.90; P<.001), and potassium (T0 3.10 mmol/L, SD 0.21,
   T35 4.12 mmol/L, SD 0.35; P<.001) concentrations.
   Conclusions and Clinical ImportanceThe commercial BU kit is appropriate
   for blood collection and conservation of WB in cats. The maintenance of
   WB quality indicators during storage is essential for future
   improvements of feline transfusion medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella Typhimurium) and its
   monophasic variant (Salmonella 4,{[}5],12 i:-) are the major causes of
   gastroenteritis in both humans and animals. Pulsed-field gel
   electrophoresis and multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis
   have been used widely as subtyping methods for these pathogens in
   molecular epidemiological analyses, but the results do not precisely
   reflect phylogenetic information. In this study, we performed a
   phylogenetic analysis of these serovars using whole-genome sequencing
   data and identified nine distinct genotypic clades. Then, we established
   an allele-specific PCR-based genotyping method detecting a
   clade-specific single nucleotide polymorphism to rapidly identify the
   clade of each isolate. Among a total of 815 isolates obtained from
   cattle in Japan between 1977 and 2017, clades 1, 7, and 9 contained 77\%
   of isolates. Obvious replacement of the dominant clone was observed five
   times in this period, and clade 9, which mostly contains Salmonella
   4,{[}5],12:i:-, is currently dominant. Among 140 isolates obtained from
   swine in Japan between 1976 and 2017, clades 3 and 9 contained 64\% of
   isolates. Clade 9 is the latest clone as is the case in cattle isolates.
   Clade 9 is similar to an epidemic clone from Europe, which is
   characterized by sequence type 34 (ST34), chromosomal Salmonella genomic
   island 3, and a composite transposon containing antimicrobial resistance
   genes. The increased prevalence of clade 9 among food animals in Japan
   might be a part of the pandemic of the European Salmonella 4,{[}5],12:i:

Abstract = {{Over the past decades, Salmonella 4,{[}5],12:i:- has rapidly emerged and
   it is isolated with high frequency in the swine food chain. Although
   many studies have documented the epidemiological success of this
   serovar, few investigations have tried to explain this phenomenon from a
   genetic perspective. Here a comparative whole-genome analysis of 50
   epidemiologically unrelated S. 4,{[}5],12:i:-, isolated in Italy from
   2010 to 2016 was performed, characterizing them in terms of genetic
   elements potentially conferring resistance, tolerance and persistence
   characteristics. Phylogenetic analyses indicated interesting
   distinctions among the investigated isolates. The most striking genetic
   trait characterizing the analyzed isolates is the widespread presence of
   heavy metals tolerance gene cassettes: most of the strains possess genes
   expected to confer resistance to copper and silver, whereas about half
   of the isolates also contain the mercury tolerance gene rnerA. A
   functional assay showed that these genes might be useful for preventing
   the toxic effects of metals, thus supporting the hypothesis that they
   can contribute to the success of S. 4,{[}5],12:i:- in farming
   environments. In addition, the analysis of the distribution of type II
   toxin-antitoxin families indicated that these elements are abundant in
   this serovar, suggesting that this is another factor that might favor
   its successful spread.}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to identify risk factors associated with AIV
   infections in live bird retail stalls (LBRS) in Lahore District,
   Pakistan. A cross-sectional survey of LBRS was conducted from December
   2009-February 2010 using two-stage cluster sampling based on probability
   proportional to size. A total of 280 oropharyngeal swab sample pools
   were collected from 1400 birds in 8 clusters and tested by qRT-PCR for
   the matrix (M) gene of type A influenza virus and HA gene subtypes H9,
   H5 and H7. Thirty-four (34) samples were positive for the M gene, of
   which 28 were also positive for H9. No sample was found positive for H5
   or H7. Data for 36 potential risk factors, collected by questionnaire,
   were analyzed by survey-weighted logistic regression and prevalence odds
   ratios (OR) for associated risk factors were calculated. A final
   multivariable model identified three risk factors for H9 infection in
   LRBS, namely obtaining birds from mixed sources (OR 2.28, CI95\%:
   1.4-3.7), keeping birds outside cages (OR 3.10, CI95\%: 1.4-7.0) and
   keeping chicken breeds other than broilers (OR 6.27, CI95\%: 1.7-23.2).
   Sourcing birds from dealers/wholesalers, keeping birds inside cages and
   avoiding mixing different breeds in cages could reduce the risk of H9
   infections in LRBS.}},

Abstract = {{Background: In 2012/13, the Federal government of Nigeria approved the
   surveillance of salmonellae in commercial poultry farms with the aim of
   generating baseline data for the development of a control programme.
   That baseline provided an opportunity to investigate potential risk
   factors in commercial layer farms.
   Methods: Five hundred and twenty-three farms were evaluated for the
   presence of Salmonella. Each farmer was interviewed through a structured
   questionnaire. Univariate analysis identified 26 variables potentially
   associated with Salmonella presence on the farms, with different levels
   of significance. To simultaneously evaluate the effect of these
   variables, a multivariable logistic regression model was implemented.
   Results: Farmers that are member of the Poultry Association of Nigeria
   (PAN) emerged as a risk factor, as well as being farmer as exclusive
   occupation. The risk of Salmonella increased in farms with a combined
   housing system as compared to farms with a single housing system.
   Moreover, in terms of farm management the use of plastic egg crates had
   a higher risk of Salmonella presence compared to paper crates. Higher
   risk of contamination was also identified in farms having regular
   contact with animal health workers, since this could be indicative of
   animal health problems requiring continuous assistance. Farms with no
   previous outbreak of salmonellosis were associated with an increase
   risk, since most of the farms in this category were newly established.
   With regard to feeding, the use of coccidiostats and commercial feeds
   were associated with the spread of Salmonella. Unexpectedly, the
   presence of other farms at distances further than 1 km away was
   associated with an increase in Salmonella presence as compared to farms
   which were in closer proximity. Close proximity among farms could favour
   the application of stricter biosecurity measures.
   Conclusions: The results of the survey can be considered a baseline for
   implementing effective measures aimed at reducing the Salmonella
   prevalence in Nigerian laying hen farms.}},

Abstract = {{Paratuberculosis (or Johne's disease) is an infectious disease which
   affects mainly ruminants and it is caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp.
   paratuberculosis (MAP). During a culling program (years 2011-2015) aimed
   at controlling the red deer (Cervus elaphus) population in Stelvio
   National Park (Italian Alps), where paratuberculosis was already
   described in this species, 382 tissue samples from the Lombardy Region
   and 102 fecal specimens from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano were
   analyzed by PCR. Of these, 77 samples (20.16\%) from the Lombardy area
   and 19 specimens (18.63\%) from the Bolzano area resulted PCR positive.
   The cultural test was carried out on PCR positive samples (n = 96),
   enabling the isolation of 19 MAP field strains which were genotyped
   using MIRU-VNTR typing and Short Sequence repeats (SSRs).
   Our results suggest that all isolates share an identical VNTR profile
   corresponding to the INMV1 genotype. The only variation was on the locus
   SSR2, but the utility of this last locus has already been questioned
   because of its instability. Overall, these data suggest a common clonal
   origin and host adaptation during the diffusion of paratuberculosis in
   this population. Finally, this profile is the same as that which has
   already been described in the cattle population in Northern Italy,
   suggesting a possible inter-species disease transmission pattern from
   wildlife to domestic ruminants and vice versa.}},

Abstract = {{Pre-slaughter transportation of rabbits under commercial conditions may
   influence their mortality, routinely recorded at the slaughterhouse as
   DOA ('dead-on-arrival' rate). The aim of this study was to identify
   potential risk factors for DOA, including batch size (number of rabbits
   loaded), season, stocking density, and transport and lairage duration. A
   retrospective analysis of 6411 fattening rabbit and 450 breeding rabbit
   batches transported in a 3-year period to a major abattoir of Northeast
   Italy was performed. At least one dead animal was recorded in 62\% of
   fattening batches and 14\% of breeding batches. Average DOA was 0.08\%
   for fattening rabbits, but in transports with at least one dead rabbit
   the average DOA was 0.13\%. For fattening rabbits, significantly
   increased DOAs were observed in batches with < 1201 or > 3508 rabbits,
   mainly during the summer, and at a stocking density higher than 29.3
   kg/crate. The highest number of batches at high stocking density was
   found in winter (61\% of all batches). Batches with high stocking
   density showed a higher DOA even in winter, suggesting that the
   reduction of space availability does not protect against low
   temperatures. Regarding travel duration, transports longer than 3 h
   increased significantly DOA by approximate to 40\% compared to
   transports shorter than 1 h. A lairage longer than 7 h doubled the DOA
   compared to a lairage shorter than 2 h. The interaction between travel
   and lairage duration showed that a journey shorter than 1 h can
   significantly reduce DOA associated with a long lairage. For breeding
   rabbits, the average DOA in batches with at least one dead rabbit (n =
   65), was 1.79\%; no significant association with variables was detected.}},

Abstract = {{Calves are highly susceptible to disease and mortality occurrence within
   the first month of life. Even if failed transfer of passive immunity
   (FTPI) is commonly recognized as a main factor affecting calf health and
   survival, conflicting results are reported in literature about the
   association between passive immunity (PI) and calf health, especially
   regarding enteric diseases. Therefore, a prospective cohort study was
   conducted on 78 calves of three Italian dairy farms during winters of
   years 2014-2016, with the specific aim of evaluating the association
   between PI and health status of calves within 30 days of age under field
   conditions. Blood samples were collected between 1 and 5 days of age
   from each calf included in the study, and disease and mortality
   occurrence was monitored throughout the first month of life.
   Additionally, fecal samples were collected from calves with scours
   before treatment. Blood serum samples were tested by an electrophoretic
   method for the assessment of immunoglobulin (Ig) concentration, whereas
   fecal samples were submitted to ELISA test for positivity to Escherichia
   coli K99, rotavirus, coronavirus, and Cryptosporidium spp. Only enteric
   diseases occurred in calves of this study. Calves that suffered from
   diarrhea or died within the first month of life had lower serum Ig
   concentrations than those that remained healthy or survived (P < .05).
   Even if not significantly (P = .127), lower serum Ig concentrations were
   observed in sick calves that had been treated with antibiotics compared
   to those that had not been treated. The odds of disease and mortality
   occurrence were 24 (95\% CI = 3-231) and 11 (95\% CI = 1-111) times
   higher, respectively, for calves with FTPI (serum Ig concentration <
   10.0 g/L) than for those with an adequate PI transfer (P < .05). Calves
   with adequate PI transfer had also a 6-day delay in the age at first
   disease onset compared to those with FTPI (P < .01). Even if estimated
   on a small number of calves, those with FTPI had higher risks of enteric
   infections by rotavirus (odds ratio = 12; 95\% CI = 1-137) and
   Cryptosporidium spp. (odds ratio = 9; 95\% CI = 1-72) (P < .05). In this
   study, the PI level influenced the occurrence of enteric diseases and
   mortality in calves under one month of age, confirming the importance of
   a proper colostrum provision to calf health and, consequently, to the
   reduction of antimicrobial use in dairy farming. However, further
   investigations are needed, particularly focusing on the relationship
   between PI and specific enteropathogen infections in calves.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, consumers have been increasingly interested in the
   quality and safety of specialty food products that are perceived as
   healthy and wholesome. However, few studies have been carried out to
   assess the effects of domestic cooking on the fate of pathogens in
   meat-based products. The present study aimed to assess the shelf life of
   ready-to-cook Ascoli-style olives, an Italian specialty food
   preparation, through accelerated shelf life tests. A challenge test was
   also carried out to test the efficacy of cooking methods on the survival
   of Salmonella Senftenberg strains. Accelerated shelf life assays,
   including physico-chemical assays (investigating the total volatile
   basic nitrogen and pH), microbiological counts (Enterobacteriaceae
   counts) and sensory parameters (appearance, color, odor, flavor and
   texture) allowed us to obtain sound information on the durability of
   pre-cooked Ascoli-style olives in an affordable and efficient manner.
   This is therefore an effective method that could be exploited by food
   business operators hoping to provide scientific information on product
   shelf life assessments. The challenge tests demonstrated that fan-baking
   in an electric oven at 200 A degrees C for 12 min and deep frying for 4
   min are the more effective treatments needed to inactivate the
   artificially inoculated Salmonella Senftenberg strains.}},

Abstract = {{Betanodaviruses are small ssRNA viruses responsible for viral
   encephalopathy and retinopathy, otherwise known as viral nervous
   necrosis, in marine fish worldwide. These viruses can be either
   horizontally or vertically transmitted and have been sporadically
   detected in invertebrates, which seem to be one of the possible viral
   sources. Twenty-eight new betanodavirus strains were retrieved in three
   molluscs species collected from different European countries between
   2008 and 2015. The phylogenetic analyses revealed that strains retrieved
   from bivalve molluscs are closely related to viruses detected in finfish
   in Southern Europe in the period 2000-2009. Nevertheless, a new
   betanodavirus strain, markedly different from the other members of the
   RGNNV genotype, was detected. Such a massive and varied presence of
   betanodaviruses in bivalve molluscs greatly stresses the risks of
   transmission previously feared for other invertebrates. Bivalve molluscs
   reared in the same area as farmed and wild finfish could act as a
   reservoir of the virus. Furthermore, current European regulations allow
   relaying activities and the sale of live bivalve molluscs, which could
   pose a real risk of spreading betanodaviruses across different
   geographic regions. To our knowledge, this is the first study, which
   focuses on the detection and genetic characterization of betanodaviruses

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{269}},
Pages = {{1-11}},
Month = {{MAR 23}},
Abstract = {{Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread zoonotic parasite with a high
   seroprevalence in the human population and the ability to infect almost
   all warm blooded animals. Humans can acquire toxoplasmosis from
   different transmission routes and food plays a critical role. Within the
   food category, meat is of utmost importance, as it may contain
   bradyzoites inside tissue cysts, which can potentially cause infection
   after ingestion if parasites are not inactivated through freezing or
   cooking before consumption. In Italy, the most commonly consumed meat
   producing animal species are bovines and pigs. However, T. gondii
   prevalence and consumption habits for meat of these animal species are
   very different. There is debate within the scientific community
   concerning which of these animal species is the main source of
   meat-derived human toxoplasmosis. The aim of this work was to build a
   quantitative risk assessment model to estimate the yearly probability of
   acquiring toxoplasmosis infection due to consumption of bovine meat and
   pork (excluding cured products) in Italy, taking into account the
   different eating habits. The model was fitted with data obtained from
   the literature regarding: bradyzoite concentrations, portion size,
   dose-response relation, prevalence of T. gondii in bovines and swine,
   meat consumption and meat preparation habits. Alternative handling
   scenarios were considered. The model estimated the risk per year of
   acquiring T. gondii infection in Italy from bovine and swine meat to be
   0.034\% and 0.019\%, respectively. Results suggest that, due to existing
   eating habits, bovine meat can be a not negligible source of
   toxoplasmosis in Italy.}},

Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{MAR 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Northeastern Italy is a hotspot for several tick-borne
   pathogens, transmitted to animals and humans mainly by Ixodes ricinus.
   Here we compare the results of molecular monitoring of ticks and
   zoonotic TBPs over a six-year period, with the monitoring of red foxes
   (Vulpes vulpes) in an endemic area.
   Results: In the period 2011-2016, 2,578 ticks were collected in 38 sites
   of 20 municipalities of Belluno Province. Individual adults (264),
   pooled larvae (n = 330) and nymphs (n = 1984) were screened for
   tick-borne encephalitis virus, Borrelia burgdorferi (s.l.), Rickettsia
   spp., Babesia spp., Anaplasma phagocytophilum and ``Candidatus
   Neoehrlichia mikurensis{''} by specific SYBR green real-time PCR assays
   and sequencing. The spleens of 97 foxes, culled in the period 2015-2017
   during sport hunting or population control programs, were also screened.
   Overall, nine different pathogens were found in I. ricinus nymph and
   adult ticks: Rickettsia helvetica (3.69\%); R. monacensis (0.49\%); four
   species of the B. burgdorferi (s. l.) complex {[}B. afzelii (1.51\%); B.
   burgdorferi (s. s.) (1.25\%); B. garinii (0.18\%); and B. valaisiana
   (0.18\%)]; A. phagocytophilum (3.29\%); ``Candidatus N. mikurensis{''}
   (1.73\%); and Babesia venatorum (0.04\%). Larvae were collected and
   screened in the first year only and two pools (0.6\%) were positive for
   R. helvetica. Tick-borne encephalitis virus was not found in ticks
   although human cases do occur in the area. The rate of infection in
   ticks varied widely according to tick developmental stage, site and year
   of collection. As expected, adults were the most infected, with 27.6\%
   harboring at least one pathogen compared to 7.3\% of nymphs. Pathogens
   with a minimum infection rate above 1\% were recorded every year. None
   of the pathogens found in ticks were detectable in the foxes, 52 (54\%)
   of which were instead positive for Babesia cf. microti (also referred to
   as Babesia microti-like, ``Theileria annae{''}, ``Babesia annae{''} and
   ``Babesia vulpes{''}).
   Conclusions: The results show that foxes cannot be used as sentinel
   animals to monitor tick-borne pathogens in the specific epidemiological
   context of northeastern Italy. The high prevalence of Babesia cf.
   microti in foxes and its absence in ticks strongly suggests that I.
   ricinus is not the vector of this pathogen.}},

Title = {{First detection of Borrelia miyamotoi in Ixodes ricinus ticks from
   northern Italy}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{MAR 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Borrelia miyamotoi is a spirochete transmitted by several
   ixodid tick species. It causes a relapsing fever in humans and is
   currently considered as an emerging pathogen. In Europe, B. miyamotoi
   seems to occur at low prevalence in Ixodes ricinus ticks but has a wide
   distribution. Here we report the first detection of B. miyamotoi in
   Ixodes ricinus ticks collected in two independent studies conducted in
   2016 in the north-eastern and north-western Alps, Italy.
   Results: Three out of 405 nymphs (0.74\%) tested positive for Borrelia
   miyamotoi. In particular, B. miyamotoi was found in 2/365 nymphs in the
   western and in 1/40 nymphs in the eastern alpine area. These are the
   first findings of B. miyamotoi in Italy.
   Conclusions: Exposure to B. miyamotoi and risk of human infection may
   occur through tick bites in northern Italy. Relapsing fever caused by
   Borrelia miyamotoi has not yet been reported in Italy, but misdiagnoses
   with tick-borne encephalitis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis or other
   relapsing fever can occur. Our findings suggest that B. miyamotoi should
   be considered in the differential diagnosis of febrile patients
   originating from Lyme borreliosis endemic regions. The distribution of
   this pathogen and its relevance to public health need further
   investigation.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Diet and lifestyle have a strong influence on gut microbiota, which in
   turn has important implications on a variety of health-related aspects.
   Despite great advances in the field, it remains unclear to which extent
   the composition of the gut microbiota is modulated by the intake of
   animal derived products, compared to a vegetable based diet. Here the
   specific impact of vegan, vegetarian, and omnivore feeding type on the
   composition of gut microbiota of 101 adults was investigated among
   groups homogeneous for variables known to have a role in modulating gut
   microbial composition such as age, anthropometric variables, ethnicity,
   and geographic area. The results displayed a picture where the three
   different dietetic profiles could be well distinguished on the basis of
   participant's dietetic regimen. Regarding the gut microbiota;
   vegetarians had a significantly greater richness compared to omnivorous.
   Moreover, counts of Bacteroidetes related operational taxonomic units
   (OTUs) were greater in vegans and vegetarians compared to omnivores.
   Interestingly considering the whole bacterial community composition the
   three cohorts were unexpectedly similar, which is probably due to their
   common intake in terms of nutrients rather than food, e.g., high fat
   content and reduced protein and carbohydrate intake. This finding
   suggests that fundamental nutritional choices such as vegan, vegetarian,
   or omnivore do influence the microbiota but do not allow to infer
   conclusions on gut microbial composition, and suggested the possibility
   for a preferential impact of other variables, probably related to the
   general life style on shaping human gut microbial community in spite of
   dietary influence. Consequently, research were individuals are
   categorized on the basis of their claimed feeding types is of limited
   use for scientific studies, since it appears to be oversimplified.}},

Abstract = {{Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been documented in almost every species of bat

   geographic range, indicative of a long-standing host association.
   Despite this, the respective roles of long-term virus-host co-divergence
   and cross-species transmission (host-jumping) in the evolution of bat
   coronaviruses are unclear. Using a phylogenetic approach we provide
   evidence that CoV diversity in bats is shaped by both species richness
   and their geographical distribution, and that CoVs exhibit clustering at
   the level of bat genera, with these genus-specific clusters largely
   associated with distinct CoV species. Co-phylogenetic analyses revealed
   that cross-species transmission has been more common than co-divergence
   across coronavirus evolution as a whole, and that cross-species
   transmission events were more likely between sympatric bat hosts.
   Notably, however, an analysis of the CoV RNA polymerase phylogeny
   suggested that many such host-jumps likely resulted in short-term
   spill-over infections, with little evidence for sustained onward

   proportion of indoor Culicoides of the total midge catch, thus
   indicating that lower outdoor temperatures drive Culicoides midges
   indoors. High rates of engorged females were recorded indoors, possibly
   as the result of the propensity of C.obsoletus females to feed indoors.
   Higher proportions of parous females were found in indoor than in

Journal = {{VIROLOGY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{FEB 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Rhabdoviridae is one of the most ecologically diverse
   families of RNA viruses which can infect a wide range of vertebrates and
   invertebrates. Bats, among mammals, are pointed to harbor a
   significantly higher proportion of unknown or emerging viruses with
   zoonotic potential. Herein, we report the isolation of a novel
   rhabdovirus, detected in the framework of a virological survey on bats
   implemented in North Italy.
   Methods: Virus isolation and identification were performed on samples of
   635 bats by using cell cultures, negative staining electron microscopy
   and PCRs for different viruses. NGS was commonly performed on cell
   culture supernatants showing cytopathic effect or in case of samples
   resulted positive by at least one of the PCRs included in the diagnostic
   protocol.
   Results: A rhabdovirus was isolated from different organs of a
   Pipistrellus kuhlii. Virus identification was obtained by electron
   microscopy and NGS sequencing. The complete genome size was 11,774 nt
   comprised 5 genes, encoding the canonical rhabdovirus structural
   proteins, and an additional transcriptional unit (U1) encoding a
   hypothetical small protein (157aa) (3'-N-P-M-G-U1-L-5'). The genome
   organization and phylogenetic analysis suggest that the new virus, named
   Vaprio virus (VAPV), belongs to the recently established genus
   Ledantevirus (subgroup B) and it is highly divergent to its closest
   known relative, Le Dantec virus (LDV) (human, 1965 Senegal). A specific
   RT-PCR amplifying a 350 bp fragment of the ORF 6 gene, encoding for L
   protein, was developed and used to test retrospectively a subset of 76
   bats coming from the same area and period, revealing two more VAPV
   positive bats.
   Conclusions: VAPV is a novel isolate of chiropteran rhabdovirus. Genome
   organization and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that VAPV should be
   considered a novel species within the genus Ledantevirus for which viral
   ecology and disease associations should be investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Flavobacterium psychrophilum, the etiological agent of rainbow trout fry
   syndrome and bacterial cold-water disease in salmonid fish, is currently
   one of the main bacterial pathogens hampering the productivity of
   salmonid farming worldwide. In this study, the genomic diversity of the
   F. psychrophilum species is analyzed using a set of 41 genomes,
   including 30 newly sequenced isolates. These were selected on the basis
   of available MLST data with the two-fold objective of maximizing the
   coverage of the species diversity and of allowing a focus on the main
   clonal complex (CC-ST10) infecting farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus
   mykiss) worldwide. The results reveal a bacterial species harboring a
   limited genomic diversity both in terms of nucleotide diversity, with
   similar to 0.3\% nucleotide divergence inside CDSs in pairwise genome
   comparisons, and in terms of gene repertoire, with the core genome
   accounting for similar to 80\% of the genes in each genome. The
   pan-genome seems nevertheless ``open{''} according to the scaling
   exponent of a power-law fitted on the rate of new gene discovery when
   genomes are added one-by-one. Recombination is a key component of the
   evolutionary process of the species as seen in the high level of
   apparent homoplasy in the core genome. Using a Hidden Markov Model to
   delineate recombination tracts in pairs of closely related genomes, the
   average recombination tract length was estimated to similar to 4.0 Kbp
   and the typical ratio of the contributions of recombination and
   mutations to nucleotide-level differentiation (r/m) was estimated to
   similar to 13. Within CC-ST10, evolutionary distances computed on
   non-recombined regions and comparisons between 22 isolates sampled up to
   27 years apart suggest a most recent common ancestor in the second half
   of the nineteenth century in North America with subsequent
   diversification and transmission of this clonal complex coinciding with
   the worldwide expansion of rainbow trout farming. With the goal to
   promote the development of tools for the genetic manipulation of F.
   psychrophilum, a particular attention was also paid to plasmids. Their
   extraction and sequencing to completion revealed plasmid diversity that
   remained hidden to classical plasmid profiling due to size similarities.}},

   (AMR) at herd level are necessary to target antimicrobial misuse in
   food-producing animals. AMC data in 2010-2015 in 32 Italian industrial
   rabbit holdings weighted with semester production and standardised with
   animal daily doses (ADDs) were collected. Herd-level AMR against eight
   antimicrobials was assessed in Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis
   and Enterococcus hirae collected in 2014-2015. Escherichia coli were
   assessed for mcr-1 and mcr-2 genes. To produce 1 kg of live rabbit, a
   mean of 71.8 ADDs was used. Overall AMC reduced over time (P < 0.05)
   owing to lowering consumption of tetracyclines (P < 0.05) and colistin
   (P < 0.01), but consumption of quinolones (P < 0.05), bacitracin (P <
   0.01) and sulfonamides (P = 0.017) increased. All except one indicator
   E. coli were wildtype for cefotaxime, whereas 97\% displayed reduced
   susceptibility to tetracyclines, 89\% to trimethoprim, 63\% to
   enrofloxacin, 24\% to chloramphenicol and 21\% to colistin. mcr-1 was
   detected in 50/320 E. coli isolates from 15/32 holdings; mcr-2 was not
   detected in 58 isolates with colistin MIC >= 2 mg/L. All 305 enterococci
   were wild-type for ampicillin, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin and
   displayed reduced tetracycline susceptibility. The mean antimicrobial
   resistance index (ARI) was 0.5 for E. coli and 0.3 for enterococci. ARI
   was significantly correlated with AMC at herd level for enterococci (P =
   0.008) but not E. coli where high ARI levels were found in a few

   stratified study with five surveys provided the serological evidence
   that the avian influenza H5 subtype circulates in the domestic duck
   population and spreads to almost all the newly housed (and negative)
   flocks in the time span of a seasonal production cycle. Virological
   investigation was negative. The survival analysis showed that the
   probability of seroconversion increased rapidly over the study period,
   without significant difference among different agro-ecosystems. The
   analysis suggests that viral spread in the new cycle could be limited if
   control measures were adopted at the time new flocks are housed. The

Abstract = {{After more than 10years of absence, sylvatic rabies re-appeared in Italy
   in 2008. To prevent disease spread, three oral rabies vaccination (ORV)
   campaigns targeting red foxes were performed through manual distribution
   of vaccine baits between January and September 2009. As these campaigns
   proved unsuccessful, at the end of December 2009, baits started being
   distributed using helicopters, allowing uniform coverage of larger areas
   in a shorter time period. From winter 2009 to autumn 2016, a total of 15
   ORV campaigns (four emergency, four regular and seven preventive ORV)
   were implemented through aerial distribution of baits. In this study, we
   assessed the costs of the aerial ORV campaigns, which were aimed at
   eradicating the disease and reobtaining the rabies-free status.
   Cumulative costs per km(2) were estimated at Euro59.45 during emergency
   campaigns and ranged between Euro51.94 and Euro65.67 in the regular
   vaccinations. The main portion of costs for ORV programmes were related
   to baits supply and distribution: Euro49.24 (82.83\%) in emergency
   campaigns and from Euro40.33 to Euro 43.35 in regular ORVs (71.97\% and
   66.02\%, respectively). At the end of each ORV campaign, the efficacy of
   vaccination activities was estimated by assessing the proportion of
   foxes testing positive for tetracycline biomarker in jawbone, indicating
   bait intake. Results revealed that the proportion of foxes that ingested
   baits varied between 70.97\% and 95.51\%. Statistical analysis indicated
   that reducing the density of dropped baits could potentially lead to a
   cost-saving of 22.81\%, still maintaining a satisfactory level of bait
   intake by the fox population.}},

   damsela, is essential for managing fish pasteurellosis outbreaks in

   simultaneous detection and quantification of P.damselae was designed
   targeting partial of the sequence of the bamB gene and tested for
   specificity and sensitivity on laboratory-generated samples as well as
   on experimentally infected seabream tissue samples. With a limit of
   detection (LOD) of one copy in pure bacterial DNA, the sensitivity was
   higher than all methods previously reported. Validation in target and
   non-target bacterial species proved the assay was able to discriminate
   Phdd-Phdp subspecies from diverse hosts/geographical origins and between
   non-target species. In addition, two SNPs in the target amplicon region
   determine two distinctive qPCR dissociation curves distinguishing
   between Phdp-Phdd. This is the first time that a molecular method for

Abstract = {{A sexual dimorphism in liver inflammation and repair was previously

   and 8 days. Histological and hepatic cell population analyses were
   performed. The correlation between androgen receptor (AR) expression and
   liver recruited inflammatory cells was investigated by treatment with
   the AR antagonist flutamide. Additionally, patients with a diagnosis of
   drug induced liver injury (DILI) were included in the study, with a
   particular focus on gender dimorphism in circulating monocytes. A
   delayed resolution of necrotic damage and a higher expression of
   proinflammatory cytokines were apparent in male mice along with a slower
   recruitment of inflammatory monocytes. F4/80(+)CD11b(+) macrophages and
   CD11b(high)Gr-1(high) monocytes expressed AR and were recruited later in
   male compared with female livers after CCl4 treatment. Moreover,
   CD11b(high)AR+Gr-1(high) recruitment was negatively modulated by
   flutamide in males. Analysis of DILI patients showed overall a
   significant reduction in circulating mature monocytes compared with
   healthy subjects. More interestingly, male patients had higher numbers
   of immature monocytes compared with female patients.
   A stronger cytotoxic tissue response was correlated with an impaired
   recruitment of CD11b(high)AR+Gr-1(high) cells and F4/80(+)CD11b(+)
   macrophages in the early inflammatory phase under AR signaling. During
   DILI, a dimorphic immune response was apparent, characterized by a
   massive recruitment of monocytes to the liver both in males and females,

Abstract = {{Due to favourable climate condition, Italy is a prominent producer of

   the most typical Italian foods, like pasta, pizza and bread, are made of
   durum and common wheat flour. Because of the great importance of wheat

   unconventional non-targeted method for the discrimination of Triticum
   species using direct analysis real time-high-resolution mass
   spectrometry (DART-HRMS). For this purpose, 60 wheat samples including
   durum, common and hulled wheat varieties were collected over two
   consecutive harvest years. Chemometric evaluation revealed an optimal
   sample clustering according to the wheat species and the presence of 18
   significant markers able to discriminate the groups. The discrimination
   power obtained is promising since the use of DART-HRMS can significantly
   reduce the analysis time compared to chromatographic techniques. A

   swabs from backyard chickens, namely APMV-1/Libya/15VIR5368/2015 and
   APMV-1/Libya/15VIR5371/2015. Genetic sequencing of these viruses
   revealed the presence of velogenic APMV-1 belonging to genotype VIIi
   genetically similar to the viruses isolated on 2013. During the same
   period, neurologic signs and mortality were noticed in pigeons. Samples
   of brain tissue were tested by rRT-PCR which revealed presence of

   VIb. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the
   detection and molecular characterization of APMV-1 in a pigeon in Libya.
   The phylogenetic analysis of the F gene showed 86\% identity to isolates

Abstract = {{This trial evaluates the feasibility of using passive injectable

   farming conditions. Commercial PITs of 3.85 +/- 0.05 mm x 31.2 mm were
   used at two application sites, the armpit and the retro-auricular
   region. The two application sites were compared taking into account the
   ease of injection, animal reaction, injection duration, inflammatory
   response, PIT readability at up to 12 months post-injection and PIT
   recovery at the slaughterhouse. The injection site influenced the
   reaction of the animal and the ease and duration of the injection, but
   it did not affect the palpation and the reading findings during the
   rearing period. The injection site also influenced the PIT retrieval at
   the slaughterhouse depending on the operator who recovered the PIT. The
   readability values observed at the end of the observation period for
   both injection sites (83\% in the retro-auricular region and 79\% in the
   armpit region) were too low to be suitable for long-term animal
   identification. In addition, the failed retrieval of PITs at slaughter,
   determined the destruction of 40 (22\%) carcases to avoid any risks in
   the food chain. These findings suggest that the limited use of PITs is
   indicated when other methods of electronic identification cannot be
   employed, while a wider application of the device tested in the present

   pleural adhesions and the percentage of affected parenchyma. Moreover,
   individual antimicrobial dosages were acquired from the farm registries.
   64\% of animals had at least one lung lesion; a negative association
   between lung lesions and carcass weight was found. No association
   between lung lesions and antimicrobial use was identified. The
   appropriateness of each antimicrobial treatment was evaluated based on
   the ratio between each actual daily dose used and the correspondent
   defined daily dose available in the Summary of Product Characteristics
   (SPC). Three methods based on different estimation of
   live-weight-at-treatment were applied and provided significantly
   different results for some antimicrobial classes. Aminoglycosides and
   high-priority critical anti-microbials like macrolides were those most
   frequently administered (20\% and 42\% of treatments, respectively).
   Evaluation of dosage appropriateness showed that aminoglycosides were
   administered properly in 60-75\% of treatments, while macrolides were
   underdosed in 30-60\% of treatments. In conclusion, this study shows a
   high prevalence of BDR-associated lung lesions at slaughter associated
   with carcass weight, and that antimicrobial use is frequently
   inconsistent with recommended doses.}},

Abstract = {{In May 2016, highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of the subtype
   A/H5N1 was detected in Cameroon in an industrial poultry farm at
   Mvog-Betsi, Yaounde (Centre region), with a recorded sudden increase of
   deaths among chickens, and an overall mortality rate of 75\%. The virus
   spread further and caused new outbreaks in some parts of the country. In
   total, 21 outbreaks were confirmed from May 2016 to March 2017 (six in
   the Centre, six in the West, eight in the South and one in the Adamaoua
   regions). This resulted in an estimated total loss of 138,252 birds
   (44,451 deaths due to infection and 93,801 stamped out). Only domestic
   birds (chickens, ducks and geese) were affected in farms as well as in
   poultry markets. The outbreaks occurred in three waves, the first from
   May to June 2016, the second in September 2016 and the last wave in
   March 2017. The topology of the phylogeny based on the haemagglutinin
   gene segment indicated that the causative H5N1 viruses fall within the
   genetic clade 2.3.2.1c, within the same group as the A/H5N1 viruses
   collected in Niger in 2015 and 2016. More importantly, the gene
   constellation of four representative viruses showed evidence of
   H5N1/H9N2 intra-clade reassortment. Additional epidemiological and
   genetic data from affected countries in West Africa are needed to better
   trace the origin, spread and evolution of A/H5N1 in Cameroon.
   RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS
   HPAI A/H5N1 was detected in May 2016 in domestic chickens in
   Yaounde-Cameroon.
   Twenty-one outbreaks in total were confirmed from May 2016 to March
   2017.
   The causative H5N1 viruses fall within the genetic clade 2.3.2.1c.
   The viral gene constellation showed evidence of H5N1/H9N2 intra-clade
   reassortment.}},

Abstract = {{Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a Fusarium toxin, to which humans are frequently
   exposed via diet. Although the elderly are speculated to be sensitive to
   the toxic effects of DON as a result of age-related conditions, disease
   and altered DON metabolism, there is lack of available data on DON
   biomarkers in this age group. This study characterised urinary DON
   concentrations and its metabolites in elderly aged 65years (n=20)
   residing in Hull, UK. Morning urinary specimens were collected over two
   consecutive days together with food records to assess dietary intake
   over a 24h-period prior to each urinary collection. Free DON
   (un-metabolised), total DON (sum of free DON and DON-glucuronides or
   DON-GlcA) and de-epoxy deoxynivalenol (DOM-1) were analysed using a
   validated LC-MS/MS methodology. Total DON above the limit of
   quantification 0.25ng/mL was detected in the urine from 90\% of elderly
   men and women on both days. Mean total DON concentrations on day 1 were
   not different from those on day 2 (elderly men, day 1: 22.2 +/-
   26.3ng/mg creatinine (creat), day 2: 28.0 +/- 34.4ng/mg creat, p=0.95;
   elderly women, day 1: 22.4 +/- 14.6ng/mg creat, day 2: 29.1 +/-
   22.8ng/mg creat, p=0.58). Free DON and DON-GlcA were detected in 60-70\%
   and 90\% of total urine samples, respectively. DOM-1 was absent from all
   samples; the LoQ for DOM-1 was 0.50ng/mL. Estimated dietary intake of
   DON suggested that 10\% of the elderly exceeded the maximum provisional
   tolerable daily intake for DON. In this single-site, UK-based cohort,
   elderly were frequently exposed to DON, although mean total DON
   concentrations were reported at moderate levels. Future larger studies
   are required to investigate DON exposure in elderly from different
   regions of the UK, but also from different counties worldwide.}},

Abstract = {{The illegal use of glucocorticoids (GCs) as growth-promoters (GPs) is
   prohibited in farm animals in the European Union because the strong
   pharmacological activity of most synthetic GCs produces residues that
   are dangerous for human consumption. Among the alternative methods
   proposed to increase the efficacy of official controls, histology was
   the technique of choice in Italy on account of its high performance
   level. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of
   immunohistochemistry (IHC) using anti-cleaved-Lamin A antibody to
   enhance the performance of the histological test applied to GC-related
   microscopic changes in the thymus. Veal calves (VC) and beef cattle (BC)
   were raised and both underwent different growth-promoting protocols or
   were left untreated. The morphology of the thymus parenchyma was
   evaluated for cortical atrophy with concurrent adipose tissue
   infiltration, and a score of 1 to 3 was attributed. A semi-quantitative
   IHC analysis was also performed by counting the number of positive
   thymocytes in 5 randomly selected high-power fields (HPFs). The
   distribution of the thymus atrophy scores was significantly different
   among the subgroups in both BC and VC. The IHC values were higher in
   untreated than in treated animals, for both BC and VC. The association
   between thymus atrophy score and IHC positivity showed higher median
   values in control than in treated animals (independently of the
   treatment protocol), for both BC and VC. Our data shows that IHC against
   anti-cleaved-Lamin A antibody is a reliable marker to detect illegal GC
   treatments, administered either alone or in association with other
   growth promoters, in both BC and VC. Combining IHC with the thymus
   atrophy score improves the accuracy of the histological method in
   correctly identifying treated animals and could represent a valuable,
   reproducible method to be applied to large-scale screening programmes.}},

   colonies (1.6\%, 95\% CI 1.5-1.7\%). This results in an overall loss
   rate of 20.9\% (95\% CI 20.6-21.3\%) of honey bee colonies during winter

Abstract = {{Improving the knowledge on the distribution and status of the wild
   populations is desirable to inform strategies for disease surveillance,
   early detection and control. This is the case for the red fox in
   North-Eastern Italy, where rabies has been eradicated after a recent
   epizootic but the risk of its re-introduction through the eastern border
   is still acknowledged. Nevertheless, the systematic collection of data
   concerning fox distribution and dynamics remains difficult for many
   reasons, among which the very limited interest for this species and the
   land use changes. Since specific research performed by trained
   personnel, needed for providing accurate estimates of the population
   size and density, implies high expenses and can be maintained only for
   limited periods of time in small sample areas, a possible option is to
   exploit methods as cost-effective as possible, with the aim of a
   continuous monitoring at least of the fox population trend in time. For
   this aim, in this paper we explore the use of the spring night censuses
   for the red deer as a tool for the systematic collection of fox counts.
   This five-year study was carried out in the alpine province of Belluno,
   along the course of two subsequent epizootics in the fox population: the
   first caused by rabies and the second by canine distemper. The fox
   relative abundance (in terms of index ok kilometric abundance - IKA) was
   examined in the light of the consecutive presence of these two viral
   diseases by the passive disease surveillance data, in order to approach
   the use of spring night counts in detecting significant variations in
   the fox population size. The method herein proposed appears promising in
   the detection of these variations, such as those caused by severe
   epizootics, and further investigation aimed at its validation is
   worthwhile for both informing passive surveillance on disease and
   research in fox ecology.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Nanotechnology is a promising area in industry with a broad
   range of applications including in the agri-food sector. Several studies
   have investigated the potential benefits deriving from use of
   nanomaterials in the context of the whole food chain drawing scenarios
   of benefits but also potential for concerns. Among the agri-food sector,
   animal production has potential for nanomaterial application but also
   for safety concerns due to the possibility of nanomaterial accumulation
   along the farm-to-fork path.
   Scope and Approach: The aim of this work was to define the state of the
   art of nanomaterial applications in the animal production sector by
   assessing data belonging to recently publishes studies. To do this, a
   qualitative synthesis approach was applied to build a fit-for-purpose
   framework and to summarise relevant themes in the context of
   effectiveness, feasibility and health concerns.
   Key findings and conclusions: Nanomaterials have potential for use in a
   wide range of applications from feed production and farming to food
   packaging, including several detection tools designed for the benefit of
   consumer protection. The current high degree of variability in
   nanomaterials tested and in study designs impairs external validation of
   research results. Further research is required to clearly define which
   safe nanomaterial applications have the potential to reach the market.}},

   rumination in young bulls and to assess whether these data can be used
   as indicators of health status and average daily weight gain (ADG). Two
   groups of animals (period 1: n = 108 animals; period 2: n = 106 animals)
   were fitted with sensors to measure daily activity and rumination, were
   weighed on arrival and at the end of the trial (70 days) and were
   checked twice daily to verify their health condition. Any clinical signs
   and therapies were recorded. The dishomogeneity index of rumination
   (DR), and the daily dishomogeneity indices of activity (DDA) and
   rumination (DDR), were calculated. Bulls had an ADG of 1.42 +/- 0.38
   kg/day and showed an average duration of daily rumination of 404 +/- 63
   min and an average activity of 474 +/- 46 bits, respectively. Animals
   characterised by low ADG had lower values of minimum daily rumination (P
   = 0.01) and DDA (P < 0.001), and a greater rumination range (P = 0.007)
   and DR (P = 0.003). Bovine respiratory disease and lameness were
   detected 31 and five times, respectively; among affected animals, the
   average daily activity, rumination and DDA were lower (P < 0.05) at 3-6
   days before the onset of visible clinical signs, whereas DDR increased
   compared to the values when individuals were apparently healthy. The use
   of individual sensors appears promising for the early diagnosis of
   disease in beef cattle and for improving herd management. (C) 2017 The

Abstract = {{The microsporidiosis of the endangered white-clawed crayfish
   Austropotamobius pallipes complex has generally been attributed to only
   one species, Thelohania contejeani, the agent of porcelain disease.
   Species identification was mostly assessed by macroscopic examination or
   microscopic evaluation of muscle samples rather than by molecular or
   ultrastructural analyses. A survey conducted on A. pallipes complex
   populations in Northern Italy highlighted the presence of two different
   microsporidia causing similar muscular lesions, T. contejeani and an
   undescribed octosporoblastic species Vairimorpha austropotamobii sp.
   nov. Mature spores and earlier developmental stages of V.
   austropotamobii sp. nov. were found within striated muscle cells of the
   thorax, abdomen, and appendages of the crayfish. Only octosporoblastic
   sporogony within sporophorous vesicles (SPVs) was observed.
   Diplokaryotic sporonts separated into two uninucleate daughter cells,
   which gave rise to a rosette-shaped plasmodium, and eight uninucleate
   spores were produced within the persistent SPV. Ultrastructural features
   of stages in the octosporoblastic sequence were similar to those
   described for Vairimorpha necatrix, the type species. Mature spores were
   pyriform in shape and an average of 3.9 x 2.2 mu m in size. The polar
   filament was coiled 11-14 times, lateral to the posterior vacuole. The
   small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rRNA) and the large subunit RNA
   polymerase II gene (RPB1) of V. austropotamobii sp. nov. were sequenced
   and compared with other microsporidia. The highest sequence identity of
   SSU rRNA (99\%) and RPB1 (74\%) genes was with the amphipod parasite
   Nosema granulosis and subsequently with V. cheracis, which infects the
   Australian yabby Cherax destructor. In our work we discuss about the
   reasons for placing this new species in the genus Vairimorpha. In
   addition, we provide for T. contejeani a RPB1 gene sequence,
   supplemental sequences of SSU rRNA gene and ultrastructural details of
   its sporogony in the host A. pallipes complex.}},

Abstract = {{In rabbit, P. multocida is considered a predominant pathogenic agent;
   despite this, few data on the molecular epidemiology are available so
   far. The aim of this work was to characterize P. multocida isolates from
   rabbit affected by various diseases in Italy. Comparison was made to
   reference strains from other countries. Thirty-nine isolates were tested
   using PCRs to detect the genes coding capsular antigens, virulence
   factors and lipopolysaccharide structures (LPS). Multilocus sequence
   typing (MLST) was performed and 19 STs registered that belonged to 9
   clonal complexes. Italian isolates were all related to P. multocida
   subsp. P. multocida. Three sequence types dominated (ST9, ST50 and
   ST74). The isolates were assigned to capsular types A (20/39), D (9/39)
   and F (10/39), to virulence genes pfhA (13/39), hgbB (21/39) and pjhA +
   hgbB (4/39) (one without virulence factors) and the isolates either
   belonged to the LPS genotypes 3 (22/39) or 6 (17/39). The clonal
   relationships of the Italian strains from rabbit had similarity to
   previously reported rabbit isolates that belonged to ST9, ST74, ST204
   and ST206, however, they differed from other rabbit references strains
   that belonged to six other STs. In particular, ST9 with capsular type F
   has been previously reported from diseased rabbit in Czech Republic and
   ST74 has been observed for older rabbit isolates. ST50 has probably been
   reported from Spain. ST9 and ST50 have previously also been reported
   from birds and pig, respectively, whereas ST74 has exclusively been
   reported from pig. It remains to be investigated if the isolates
   obtained from diseased rabbit in Italy represent introductions from
   other host or they are primarily of rabbit origin.}},

Abstract = {{Small ruminant lentivirus infections in goats affect both production and
   animal welfare. This represents a threat to the qualitative and
   quantitative growth of goat farming, recently observed in mountainous
   regions such as the Autonomous Province of Bolzano - South Tyrol
   (Italy). To monitor and eradicate the caprine arthritis encephalitis
   virus in this goat population, a compulsory eradication campaign was
   launched, based on a strict census of small ruminants and yearly
   serological testing of all animals, followed by the consequent culling
   of seropositive individuals. The campaign succeeded in completely
   eliminating cases of clinical disease in goats, while drastically
   reducing the seroprevalence at the herd as well as individual animal
   level. The serological outcome of the introduced control measures was
   determined using commercially available ELISA kits, demonstrating their
   suitability for use in this type of campaign, aimed at reducing
   seroprevalence as well as clinical manifestations of these infections.
   However, this clear success is diminished by the failure to achieve a
   complete eradication of these viruses. The reasons leading to the
   observed tailing phenomenon and the occurrence of new infections in
   already sanitised flocks are discussed and implementation of further
   measures are proposed.}},

Title = {{Data distribution in public veterinary service: health and safety
   challenges push for context-aware systems}},
Journal = {{BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Today's globalised and interconnected world is characterized
   by intertwined and quickly evolving relationships between animals,
   humans and their environment and by an escalating number of accessible
   data for public health. The public veterinary services must exploit new
   modeling and decision strategies to face these changes. The organization
   and control of data flows have become crucial to effectively evaluate
   the evolution and safety concerns of a given situation in the territory.
   This paper discusses what is needed to develop modern strategies to
   optimize data distribution to the stakeholders.
   Main text: If traditionally the system manager and knowledge engineer
   have been concerned with the increase of speed of data flow and the
   improvement of data quality, nowadays they need to worry about data
   overflow as well. To avoid this risk an information system should be
   capable of selecting the data which need to be shown to the human
   operator. In this perspective, two aspects need to be distinguished:
   data classification vs data distribution. Data classification is the
   problem of organizing data depending on what they refer to and on the
   way they are obtained; data distribution is the problem of selecting
   which data is accessible to which stakeholder. Data classification can
   be established and implemented via ontological analysis and formal logic
   but we claim that a context-based selection of data should be integrated
   in the data distribution application. Data distribution should provide
   these new features: (a) the organization of situation types
   distinguishing at least ordinary vs extraordinary scenarios
   (contextualization of scenarios); (b) the possibility to focus on the
   data that are really important in a given scenario (data
   contextualization by scenarios); and (c) the classification of which
   data is relevant to which stakeholder (data contextualization by users).
   Short conclusion: Public veterinary services, to efficaciously and
   efficiently manage the information needed for today's health and safety
   challenges, should contextualize and filter the continuous and growing
   flow of data by setting suitable frameworks to classify data, users'
   roles and possible situations.}},

Abstract = {{Cats that have outdoor access are highly exposed to ticks, fleas, mites
   and flying insects, though the risk to become infested by arthropods is
   less perceived in cats than in dogs. This has resulted in fewer
   treatment and prevention options being available for cats than for dogs.
   A collar containing a combination of 10\% imidacloprid and 4.5\%
   flumethrin (Seresto (R) Bayer Animal Health) is available for cats and
   licensed with claims against ticks and fleas for 7-8 months. Following
   the assessment of the efficacy of the collar against Leishmania infanlum
   infection in privately owned cats living in the Aeolian archipelago,
   herein we report the efficacy of the collar in the treatment and
   prevention of tick and flea infestations in the same population of cats
   over a period of one year of observation. At the inclusion day (Study
   Day 0, SD 0), cats were visited and examined for ectoparasites (i.e.,
   flea combing and tick thumb counts) and allocated to group 1 (G1; n =
   104; cats treated with Seresto (R) collar) or group 2 (G2; n = 100;
   untreated controls) and further checked at SDs 210, 270 and 360 (study
   closure). At SD 0, G1 and G2 had a comparable percentage of cats
   infested by fleas (45.2\% and 49.0\%; chi(2) = 0.164; P = 0.6859) and
   ticks (6.7\% and 14.0\%; chi(2) = 2.946; P = 0.0861). The number of cats
   infested by fleas was reduced in G1, being 8.3\%, 0\% and 3.8\% on SDs
   210, 270 and 360, respectively, resulting in efficacies against fleas of
   79.4\%, 100\% and 93.6\% on SDs 210, 270 and 360. None of the cats in G1
   was found infested by ticks after the application of the collar, whereas
   in G2 ticks were observed on 15.7\%, 4.8\%, 17.5\% of the cats at the
   different follow up visits, leading to an overall efficacy against ticks
   of 100\%. A total of 375 ectoparasites were collected from cats, being
   249 fleas (six Ctenocephalides canis, 240 Ctenocephalides fells and
   three Nosopsyllus fasciatus) and 126 ticks (87 Ixodes ventalloi and 39
   Rhipicephalus pusillus). Field data gathered herein confirm a high
   efficacy of the collar in the prevention of tick and flea infestations
   on cats. This is of great importance both for the primary role of fleas
   and ticks as blood feeding parasites and, more importantly, because of
   their role as vectors of pathogens causing diseases of veterinary and
   medical importance.}},

Abstract = {{Poxvirus was the causative agent of two unusual outbreaks of
   proliferative glossitis in canary (Serinus canaria forma domestica)
   breeders in the Northern Italy. A total of 45, 7-9-mo-old canaries were
   submitted in fair postmortem conditions to the Istituto Zooprofilattico
   Sperimentale delle Venezie at the beginning of November 2005 for
   diagnostic investigation. Birds belonged to two unrelated and
   geographically distant aviaries in northern Italy, herein identified as
   Aviary A and Aviary B. The two breeder flocks had both attended the same
   bird exposition held at the beginning of October and started
   experiencing an onset of high mortality 3 wk after the show. Twelve red
   factor-melanin canaries from Aviary A (Mantua) and 33 dominant white and
   recessive white canaries from Aviary B (Vicenza) were submitted for
   laboratory investigations. Clinical signs were unspecific and consisted
   of depression, ruffling of the feathers, epistaxis, and anorexia due to
   decreased feed and water intake. Postmortem findings revealed a severe
   increase in volume, thickening, and hardening of the tongue, which had
   turned pinkish to dark brown. No apparent gross lesions were noticed in
   integumentary, respiratory, and digestive systems or other internal
   organs. Histopathologic evaluation of the tongue revealed severe
   proliferation of the stratified squamous epithelium containing numerous
   large eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies (Bollinger bodies)
   displacing the nuclei of the cells peripherally. Severe ulceration of
   the surface epithelium, fibrinoheterophilic plaque formation, and
   moderate basal lymphoplasmacytic infiltrations were also associated with
   the proliferative lesion. Poxvirus was successfully isolated from the
   lesions in tissue cultures but not in specific-pathogen-free chicken
   embryonated eggs. Typical large, brick-shaped viral particles of 300-450
   nm were also observed in affected tongues by transmission electron
   microscopy. This is the first report of multiple outbreaks of ``poxvirus
   glossitis'' in canaries.}},

Abstract = {{Animal botulism is primarily due to botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) types C,
   D or their chimeric variants C/D or D/C, produced by Clostridium
   botulinum group III, which appears to include the genetically
   indistinguishable Clostridium haemolyticum and Clostridium novyi.
   In the present study, we used matrix-assisted laser
   desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF MS) to
   identify and characterize 81 BoNT-producing Clostridia isolated in 47
   episodes of animal botulism.
   The instrument's default database, containing no entries for Clostridium
   botulinum, permitted reliable identification of 26 strains at the genus
   level. Although supplementation of the database with reference strains
   enhanced the instrument's ability to identify the neurotoxic strains at
   the genus level, resolution was not sufficient to recognize field
   strains at species level.
   Characterization by MALDI TOF confirmed the well-documented phenotypic
   and genetic differences between Clostridium botulinum strains of
   serotypes normally implicated in human botulism (A, B, E, F) and other
   Clostridium species able to produce BoNTs type C and D. The chimeric and
   non-chimeric field strains grouped separately. In particular, very low
   similarity was found between two non-chimeric type C field strains
   isolated in the same outbreak and the other field strains. This
   difference was comparable with the differences among the various
   Clostridia species included in the study.
   Characterization by MALDI TOF confirmed that BoNT-producing Clostridia
   isolated from animals are closely related and indistinguishable at the
   species level from Clostridium haemolyticum and Clostridium novyi
   reference strains. On the contrary, there seem to be substantial
   differences among chimeric and some non-chimeric type C strains. (C)

Abstract = {{We determined the hepatitis E virus (HEV) seroprevalence and detection
   rate in commercial swine herds in Italy's utmost pig-rich area, and
   assessed HEV seropositivity risk in humans as a function of occupational
   exposure to pigs, diet, foreign travel, medical history and hunting
   activities. During 2011-2014, 2700 sera from 300 swine herds were tested
   for anti-HEV IgG. HEV RNA was searched in 959 faecal pools from
   HEV-seropositive herds and in liver/bile/muscle samples from 179 pigs
   from HEV-positive herds. A cohort study of HEV seropositivity in swine
   workers (n = 149) was also performed using two comparison groups of
   people unexposed to swine: omnivores (n = 121) and vegetarians/vegans (n
   = 115). Herd-level seroprevalence was 756\% and was highest in
   farrow-to-feeder herds (816\%). Twenty-six out of 105 (248\%) herds had
   HEV-positive faecal samples (25 HEV-3, one HEV-4). Only one bile sample
   tested positive. HEV seropositivity was 123\% in swine workers, 09\% in
   omnivores and 30\% in vegetarians/vegans. Factors significantly
   associated with HEV seropositivity were occupational exposure to pigs,
   travel to Africa and increased swine workers' age. We concluded that HEV
   is widespread in Italian swine herds and HEV-4 circulation is alarming
   given its pathogenicity, with those occupationally exposed to pigs being
   at increased risk of HEV seropositivity.}},

Title = {{First report of a fish kill episode caused by pyrethroids in Italian
   freshwater}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Fish kills are events of strong emotional impact on the
   population because of the frequent suspicion that they can be the result
   of serious pollution accidents. As a matter of fact, they are often due
   to natural occurrences, such as low levels of dissolved oxygen in the
   water, but in many cases the causes remain unknown. Fish are
   particularly sensitive to pesticides and pyrethroids are reported to be
   the most ecotoxicologically active in the aquatic environment.
   Nevertheless, the reported cases of massive wild fish mortalities due to
   these toxicants are very few. This paper describes a fish kill episode
   occurred in the Padua Province (Veneto Region - North Eastern Italy)
   which involved several fish species and for which it was possible to
   identify the cause in the presence of pyrethroids in the water.
   Case presentation: When a whitish liquid coming from the rainwater drain
   of an industrial area was seen to be spilling into a drainage channel, a
   fish massive mortality was noticed and investigated. The collected water
   samples showed the presence of relevant concentrations of cypermethrin,
   permethrin, deltamethrin and tetramethrin. Analyses on the fish tissues
   revealed the presence of cypermethrin and permethrin at a concentration
   range of 476-2834 mg/kg and 346-2826 mg/kg on a lipid basis,
   respectively.
   Discussion: According to the results of the performed analyses, we can
   reasonably state that the described episode had been caused by the
   exposure of biota to high concentrations of pyrethroids. The present
   case report significantly contributes to the limited literature
   available on pesticides-related fish kills. Moreover, it highlights the
   importance of sharing protocols for fish kill management at a national
   level, as this would help to better define the roles of the different
   institutions involved and to improve the investigation and the reporting
   of these events. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pre-slaughter transportation may affect poultry welfare and mortality
   rates. A retrospective analysis was conducted to examine the effect of
   environmental, management and individual factors on the percentage of
   dead birds during pre-slaughter transportation (dead-on-arrival, DOA).
   The variables accounted for in the analyses included: environmental
   temperature, travel duration, genetic line, gender, crate type and crate
   stocking density. Among the 41 452 loads of turkeys (34 696 388 birds)
   and 3241 of end of lay hens (21 788 124 birds) transported to three
   large abattoirs in northern Italy in a 3-year period, the median DOA was
   0.14\% in turkeys, and 0.38\% in hens. In turkeys, travel duration
   longer than 30 min, temperature higher than 26 degrees C and high
   in-crate densities were associated with increased DOA. In winter (2
   degrees C), high stocking densities did not reduce the mortality risk
   from cold stress; on the contrary, for stocking densities either near to
   or just above the maximum density in EC Reg. 1/2005, the DOA risk was
   greater than for loads with densities of 10 kg/m(2) less than the EC
   maximum. Male birds and specific genetic lines also showed a higher DOA.
   In hens, transportation lasting longer than 2 h and the brown-feathered
   breed were associated with higher DOA. Dead-on-arrival progressively
   increased with travel duration, remaining constant between 4 and 6 h and
   peaking at 8 h (median: 0.57\%). The maximum DOA increase was detected
   during winter. These results show that several species-specific factors
   may lead to increased risk of mortality.}},

Abstract = {{During recent decades, ornamental fish have proven to be one of the
   fastest growing categories of pets in Europe. In this framework, we
   evaluated both the potential pathogenic and zoonotic risks caused by 53
   Vibrio cholerae non-O1/non-O139 and a Vibrio mimicus strain isolated
   from ornamental fish species mostly originating from South-East Asia
   countries between 2000 and 2015 in Italy. All the strains were firstly
   identified at species level by biochemical, phylogenetic and mass
   spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of
   flight) methods, and then studied to reveal the presence of the main
   virulence and colonization-associated factors, as ctxA, ace, zot,
   stn/sto, toxR, rtxA, hlyA and tcpA by multiplex and single endpoint PCR
   assays. Findings showed that 21 of 54 strains harboured at least one
   virulence factor with a predominance for the toxR(+), rtxA(+) and
   hlyAET(+) genotype. Interestingly, the V.mimicus strain harboured the
   colonization factor and the CTX prophage receptor, tcpA, indicating the
   ability to capture and integrate it in its genome increasing its
   pathogenicity. Although these enterotoxins can sporadically cause
   gastroenteritis, the results highlight their probable involvement in
   causing severe implications for public health, suggesting the need for
   an European microbiological monitoring.}},

Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: The prevalence of dog erythrocyte antigen (DEA 1) in canine
   population is approximately 40-60\%. Often data are limited to a small
   number of breeds and/or dogs. The aims of this study were to evaluate
   frequency of DEA 1 in a large population of purebred and mongrel dogs
   including Italian native breeds and to recognize a possible association
   between DEA 1 and breed, sex, and genetic and phenotypical/functional
   classifications of breeds. Frequencies of DEA 1 blood group collected
   from screened/enrolled blood donors and from healthy and sick dogs were
   retrospectively evaluated. The breed and the sex were recorded when
   available. DEA 1 blood typing was assessed by immunocromatographic test
   on K3EDTA blood samples. The prevalence of DEA 1 antigen was
   statistically related to breed, gender, Federation Cynologique
   Internationale (FCI) and genotypic grouping.
   Results: Sixty-two per cent dogs resulted DEA 1+ and 38\% DEA 1-. DEA 1-
   was statistically associated with Dogo Argentino, Dobermann, German
   Shepherd, Boxer, Corso dogs, the molossian dogs, the FCI group 1, 2 and
   3 and the genetic groups ``working dogs{''} and ``mastiff{''}. DEA 1+
   was statistically associated with Rottweiler, Briquet Griffon Vendeen,
   Bernese mountain dog, Golden Retriever, the hunting breeds, the FCI
   group 4, 6, 7 and 8 and the genetic groups ``scent hounds{''} and
   ``retrievers{''}. No gender association was observed.
   Conclusions: Data obtained by this work may be clinically useful to
   drive blood donor enrollment and selection among different breeds.}},

Title = {{Ethnic food consumption: Habits and risk perception in Italy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FOOD SAFETY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This study aims to provide an overview of the consumption of ethnic food
   in Italy and to analyze the perception of risk associated with this kind
   of food. A sample of 1,317 Italian consumers was surveyed. The
   consumption of ethnic food products is growing. Such food items are
   consumed at restaurants and as take-out food and are purchased and
   cooked at home. Ethnic food consumers are mainly women, younger than
   non-consumers, have higher educational qualifications, are employed and
   have children. The ethnic food consumers live mainly in the south part
   of Italy or in the Islands, are inhabitants of larger cities and meet
   their financial responsibilities more easily than non-consumers. The
   motivations connected with ethnic food consumption were analyzed. The
   perception of risk associated with ethnic food appears to be higher than
   that related to Italian food. The perceptions regarding the riskiest
   foods and the associated rationale were explored.
   Practical applicationsEthnic food consumption is a growing phenomenon
   that deserves attention not only to analyze changes in Italian food
   consumption habits but also because these foods bring about specific
   food safety issues. Associated risk factors are related to preparation
   practices in retail and food service establishments as well as the use
   of particular ingredients that pose specific biological chemical and
   nutritional issues that need to be considered. The definition of the
   characteristics of ethnic food consumers and the study of their
   practices and perceptions of risk can help in the understanding of
   aspects that may limit or encourage the acceptance of these products
   thus fostering the comprehension of the potential impact of these foods
   on consumer health. Moreover, these data can be useful for institutions
   that address the protection of public health to analyze the food safety
   issues related to the introduction of ethnic products into Italian
   consumption habits.}},

Abstract = {{Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a life-threatening fungal disease that
   can occur in dogs. The aim of this study was to provide a preliminary
   genetic characterisation of Pneumocystis carinii f. sp. `canis' (P.
   canis) in dogs and thereby develop a reliable molecular protocol to
   definitively diagnose canine PCP. We investigated P. canis in a variety
   of lung specimens from dogs with confirmed or strongly suspected PCP
   (Group 1, n = 16), dogs with non-PCP lower respiratory tract problems
   (Group 2, n = 65) and dogs not suspected of having PCP or other lower
   respiratory diseases (Group 3, n = 11). Presence of Pneumocystis DNA was
   determined by nested PCR of the large and small mitochondrial subunit
   rRNA loci and by a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction
   (qPCR) assay developed using a new set of primers. Molecular results
   were correlated with the presence of Pneumocystis morphotypes detected
   in cytological/histological prepa rations. Pneumocystis DNA was
   amplified from 13/16 PCP-suspected dogs (Group 1) and from 4/76 dogs of
   control Groups 2 and 3 (combined). The latter four dogs were thought to
   have been colonized by P. canis. Comparison of C-T values in `infected'
   versus `colonized' dogs was consistent with this notion, with a distinct
   difference in molecular burden between groups (C-T <= 26 versus C-T
   range (26 < C-T < 35), respectively). Phylogenetic analyses showed that
   P. canis is specifically `canine' associated, being separated from other
   mammalian Pneumocystis species, thereby confirming the accuracy of qPCR
   amplicon for Pneumocystis in dogs. Using qPCR, Pneumocystis DNA can be
   detected in specimens from the respiratory tract and a C-T value can be
   interpreted to distinguish infection versus colonization.}},

Abstract = {{Carp edema virus disease (CEVD), also known as koi sleepy disease, is
   caused by a poxvirus associated with outbreaks of clinical disease in
   koi and common carp Cyprinus carpio. Originally characterised in Japan
   in the 1970s, international trade in koi has led to the spread of CEV,
   although the first recognised outbreak of the disease outside of Japan
   was not reported until 1996 in the USA. In Europe, the disease was first
   recognised in 2009 and, as detection and diagnosis have improved, more
   EU member states have reported CEV associated with disease outbreaks.
   Although the structure of the CEV genome is not yet elucidated,
   molecular epidemiology studies have suggested distinct geographical
   populations of CEV infecting both koi and common carp. Detection and
   identification of cases of CEVD in common carp were unreliable using the
   original PCR primers. New primers for conventional and quantitative PCR
   (qPCR) have been designed that improve detection, and their sequences
   are provided in this paper. The qPCR primers have successfully detected
   CEV DNA in archive material from investigations of unexplained carp
   mortalities conducted > 15 yr ago. Improvement in disease management and
   control is possible, and the principles of biosecurity, good health
   management and disease surveillance, applied to koi herpesvirus disease,
   can be equally applied to CEVD. However, further research studies are
   needed to fill the knowledge gaps in the disease pathogenesis and
   epidemiology that, currently, prevent an accurate assessment of the
   likely impact of CEVD on European koi and common carp aquaculture and on
   wild carp stocks.}},

Title = {{First characterization of a Middle-East GI-23 lineage (Var2-like) of

Abstract = {{Variants assigned to GI-23 lineage of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV),
   formerly called Var2, have circulated for nearly 20 years only in
   countries of the Middle East. Strains of this lineage were first
   identified in Israel in 1998. More severe form of the virus appeared in
   2006, when the second wave of Var2 epidemic has spread over the Middle
   East region. The present study describes the detection and detailed
   genetic characterization of the GI-23 viruses in Poland. The full-length
   genome of gammaCoV/Ck/Poland/G052/2016 strain consists of 27596
   nucleotides and has typical organization for IBV
   (UTR5'-POl-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-UTR3'). The phylogenetic analysis
   of the complete sequence showed that it formed separate branch distinct
   from all of the full-length genome sequences analyzed in this study.
   Recombination analyses with other gammacoronaviruses revealed that
   Polish GI-23 strain may originate from recombination events and
   potential donors of build-in sequences are IBV of GI-1, GI-13 and G-19
   lineages (Mass-, 793B- and QX-like strains, respectively). The 1a, 1b
   and N genes were involved in these recombination events. The source of
   virus introduction to the chicken population in Poland is unknown.}},

Abstract = {{Limited information is available on suitable height of transport crates
   for turkeys. We compared behaviors and physiological indicators of four
   groups of 10 female turkeys each confined in either conventional (38.5
   cm height) or experimental (77 cm height) crates during six commercial
   pre-slaughter transportations for 86 km (76 +/- 4 min) along two tracts
   with one-lane streets, crossroads, bends, roundabouts (S1 and S2) and a
   highway tract (H) between S1 and S2. Only 36\% of birds in the higher
   crates maintained a standing position. In conventional versus
   experimental crates, the frequency of rising attempts was five/bird/hour
   versus less than one/bird/hour, while wing flapping was seven/bird/hour
   versus 20/bird/hour, and balance loss was one versus four/bird/hour. The
   behaviors of both groups differed significantly according to the route
   tract, with a lower frequency of stress-related behaviors at H. No
   scratches, fractures or hematomas were detected in any birds after
   transportation. Crate height had no significant effect on
   hemato-biochemical markers. These results suggest that crates enabling a
   standing position may increase potentially dangerous behaviors.
   Moreover, busy and curvy routes should be avoided, as they may
   contribute to increasing the frequency of stressrelated behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{The Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) is the aetiological agent of
   chronic bee paralysis, a contagious disease associated with nervous
   disorders in adult honeybees leading to massive mortalities in front of
   the hives. Some of the clinical signs frequently reported, such as
   trembling, may be confused with intoxication syndromes. Therefore,
   laboratory diagnosis using real-time PCR to quantify CBPV loads is used
   to confirm disease. Clinical signs of chronic paralysis are usually
   associated with viral loads higher than 108 copies of CBPV genome copies
   per bee (8 log(10) CBPV/bee). This threshold is used by the European
   Union Reference Laboratory for Bee Health to diagnose the disease. In
   2015, the accuracy of measurements of three CBPV loads (5, 8 and 9
   log(10) CBPV/bee) was assessed through an inter-laboratory study.
   Twenty-one participants, including 16 European National Reference
   Laboratories, received 13 homogenates of CBPV-infected bees adjusted to
   the three loads. Participants were requested to use the method usually
   employed for routine diagnosis. The quantitative results (n = 270) were
   analysed according to international standards NF ISO 13528 (2015) and NF
   ISO 5725-2 (1994). The standard deviations of measurement
   reproducibility (S-R) were 0.83, 1.06 and 1.16 at viral loads 5, 8 and 9
   log(10) CBPV/bee, respectively. The inter-laboratory confidence of viral
   quantification (+/- 1.96 S-R) at the diagnostic threshold (8 log(10)
   CBPV/bee) was +/- 2.08 log(10) CBPV/bee. These results highlight the
   need to take into account the confidence of measurements in
   epidemiological studies using results from different laboratories.
   Considering this confidence, viral loads over 6 log(10) CBPV/bee may be
   considered to indicate probable cases of chronic paralysis.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the characteristics and diseases associated with

   and surveillance specimens (n = 1) from dwarf (Helogale parvula) and
   yellow mongooses (Cynictis penicillata) from a United Kingdom zoo, were
   analyzed by PCR for detection of mecA and mecC-mediated methicillin
   resistance, and virulence genes. Isolates were genotyped by multilocus
   sequence typing (MLST) and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec
   (SCCmec) and spa sequence typing. Three isolates, obtained from the
   dwarf mongooses, carried mecA, tetK, and fexA resistance and virulence
   genes (icaA, icaD, and sec) and were typed to SCCmec IVa, spa type t899,
   and clonal complex (CC) 398. The fourth MRSA isolate, obtained from the
   femoral bone marrow of a yellow mongoose showing postmortem findings
   consistent with septicemia, carried mecC and was oxacillin/cefoxitin
   susceptible, when tested at 37 degrees C but showed a characteristic
   MRSA susceptibility profile at 25 degrees C +/- 2 degrees C.
   Furthermore, this isolate exhibited a different genetic background
   (SCCmecXI/t843/CC130) and had biofilm-associated genes (bap, icaA, and
   icaD) and tetK tetracycline resistance genes. This work describes the
   first isolation of livestock-associated MRSA CC398 from two zoo mongoose
   species where it was associated with both clinical disease and
   colonization, and the first isolation of mecC MRSA from a zoo species in
   the United Kingdom. Both reports highlight the potential for zoo species
   to act as reservoirs for these zoonotic agents.}},

Journal = {{PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{In the last decades, several European countries where arboviral
   infections are not endemic have faced outbreaks of diseases such as
   chikungunya and dengue, initially introduced by infectious travellers
   from tropical endemic areas and then spread locally via mosquito bites.
   To keep in check the epidemiological risk, interventions targeted to
   control vector abundance can be implemented by local authorities. We
   assessed the epidemiological effectiveness and economic costs and
   benefits of routine larviciding in European towns with temperate
   climate, using a mathematical model of Aedes albopictus populations and
   viral transmission, calibrated on entomological surveillance data
   collected from ten municipalities in Northern Italy during 2014 and
   2015. We found that routine larviciding of public catch basins can limit
   both the risk of autochthonous transmission and the size of potential
   epidemics. Ideal larvicide interventions should be timed in such a way
   to cover the month of July. Optimally timed larviciding can reduce
   locally transmitted cases of chikungunya by 20\% - 33\% for a single
   application (dengue: 18-22\%) and up to 43\% - 65\% if treatment is
   repeated four times throughout the season (dengue: 31-51\%). In larger
   municipalities (> 35,000 inhabitants), the cost of comprehensive
   larviciding over the whole urban area overcomes potential health
   benefits related to preventing cases of disease, suggesting the adoption
   of more localized interventions. Small/medium sized towns with high
   mosquito abundance will likely have a positive cost-benefit balance.
   Involvement of private citizens in routine larviciding activities
   further reduces transmission risks but with disproportionate costs of
   intervention. International travels and the incidence of mosquito-borne
   diseases are increasing worldwide, exposing a growing number of European
   citizens to higher risks of potential outbreaks. Results from this study
   may support the planning and timing of interventions aimed to reduce the
   probability of autochthonous transmission as well as the nuisance for
   local populations living in temperate areas of Europe.}},

Abstract = {{Aedes (Hulecoeteomyia) koreicus (Edwards) and Aedes (Stegomyia)
   albopictus (Skuse) are two invasive mosquito species well established in
   northeastern Italy, and these two species may co-occur in artificial
   larval habitats such as tires, buckets, drums, and catch basins. Because
   Ae. albopictus has been shown experimentally to be a superior competitor
   to several mosquito species, we investigated larval competition between
   Ae. koreicus and Ae. albopictus using two diet levels (low level and
   high level) and 10 Ae. albopictus: Ae. koreicus density combination
   levels (30: 0, 60: 0, 15: 15, 30: 30, 10: 20, 20: 10, 20: 40, 40: 20, 0:
   60, and 0: 30). A multivariate analysis (MANOVA) demonstrated a
   significant effect of the density combination on Ae. koreicus
   survivorship, female development time, and female wing length considered
   simultaneously in low-level diet and high-level diet treatments.
   Pairwise comparisons across low-level diet treatments showed a
   significant reduction of Ae. koreicus survivorship in 20: 10 combination
   treatments (i.e. 20 Ae. albopictus and 10 Ae. koreicus larvae) compared
   to 10: 20, 20: 40, and 30: 30 combination treatments, while no
   difference was detected for Ae. albopictus between density combination
   treatments. Furthermore, Ae. albopictus developed faster than Ae.
   koreicus regardless of diet and density combination treatments. Our
   results show weak larval competition between Ae. koreicus and Ae.
   albopictus with a slight advantage of the latter species. On the other
   hand, the presence of Ae. albopictus seems to favor the emergence of
   larger Ae. koreicus females. We suggest that factors such as habitats
   preferences or seasonal distributions may be determinant for the
   invasion success of Ae. koreicus.}},

   stunning, jugulation). The protocol has been applied in 9 Italian
   abattoirs, to highlight possible margins of improvement and to define
   reference values for some important animal based indicators. In the
   unloading area, the levels of fear, slipping, lameness, space, thermal
   comfort, sick and dead animals were assessed. At lairage, space
   allowance, drinking points and level of thermal comfort were considered.
   Vocalisations were counted by means of two measurements (continuous and
   instantaneous) when pigs were moved from lairage to the stunning system.
   Stunning effectiveness by means of 4 parameters, level of skin lesions
   and signs of diseases (pneumonia, pericarditis, liver parasites) were
   evaluated in the stunning area and after slaughtering the animals,

Title = {{Medical practitioners' attitudes towards animal assisted interventions.
   An Italian survey}},
Journal = {{COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{33}},
Pages = {{20-26}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: The present study had a dual purpose: to obtain a
   comprehensive picture of the Italian medical practitioners' opinions,
   professional experiences, training needs and knowledge of Animal
   Assisted Interventions (AAI); and to provide a detailed description of
   the medical practitioners who are characterized by a strongly positive
   attitude towards AAI.
   Methods: An online survey addressed to Italian medical practitioners was
   carried out using a 35-items structured questionnaire. Data obtained
   from the survey were analysed through appropriate summary statistics,
   analysis of variance (ANOVA) and logistic regression analysis.
   Results: 670 medical practitioners participated in the online survey.
   Among them, 508 stated that they knew of AM. 93.7\% of these described
   themselves fully favourable towards the use of the human-animal
   relationship for therapeutic purposes, 84.4\% defined themselves as
   confident and interested in studying the theme. A positive attitude
   towards AAI was greater in females, in people between 45 and 54 years
   old, in those who are pet owners and in those who believe that
   conferences are the most suitable tool to share information on AAI.
   Conclusions: The chance of having a positive attitude towards AAI is
   higher in respondents with specific characteristics. Data collected
   could be used as a starting point to promote and implement communication
   and training activities on AAI addressed to medical practitioners.}},

   diversity of EqHV in Italian equids. The RNA of EqHV was detected in
   91/1932 sera (4.7\%) whilst it was not detectable in 134 donkey sera
   screened by a TaqMan-based quantitative assay. Upon sequencing and
   phylogenetic analysis of genomic portions located in the NS5B, 5'UTR and

Journal = {{FOODBORNE PATHOGENS AND DISEASE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{14}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: Vibrio parahaemolyticus is an emerging foodborne pathogen in
   the Mediterranean, usually associated with shellfish consumption. The
   increase in the number of outbreaks in Europe is primarily associated
   with the global warming of the ocean that has a great impact on the
   spread and genetic selection of waterborne pathogens. The primary role
   of Italy in Europe's mollusk production, together with the fact that
   cases of infections with V. parahaemolyticus are not always notified to
   the European community, highlighted the necessity of acquiring new
   information about the epidemiological involvement of shellfish products.
   Objective: The aim of the study was to provide useful insights into the
   first steps of the Risk Assessment associated with V. parahaemolyticus
   through the molecular characterization of isolates from commercialized
   mollusks.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 102 strains identified as V.
   parahaemolyticus were investigated as part of a larger sampling (1-year
   survey) from several shellfish species collected from the Venice lagoon
   and the North Adriatic sea. All strains were characterized by multilocus
   sequence typing and tested for the presence of virulence genes (trh and
   tdh). The study of sampling/environmental factors and epidemiological
   analyses was performed to describe the behaviors of the different
   genetic populations.
   Results: The population structure analysis highlighted three genetic
   clusters that could be subject to temperature selection during cold (<=
   15 degrees C) and warm (>16 degrees C) seasons. Moreover, other factors,
   such as molluscan species (clams/mussels), probably played a role in the
   distribution of genetic clusters. Although few strains carried the
   virulence factors (n = 6 trh +), epidemiological links with clinical
   isolates and a local dissemination of some sequence types were
   underlined.
   Conclusion: This work provides a useful background on the genotype
   spread as a first step in the Hazard Identification in light of future
   climate changes.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{803-814}},

Abstract = {{Growing global food demand has generated a greater interest in the
   consumption of new and diversified protein sources. Novel foodstuffs
   represent a challenge for food law as they need proper safety
   assessments before obtaining market permission. The case of edible
   insects and European law is a good representation of this issue because
   a selection of food grade insect species may be available on the
   European market in the coming years. However, European legislation does
   not explicitly address edible insects. Consequently, this has left a
   grey area, allowing different interpretations of the legislation among
   Member States. The aim of this paper is to analyse the challenge of the
   safe management of edible insects in the context of the current legal
   framework. The current Novel Food legislation, as well as the
   forthcoming version of the legislation, will be analysed and discussed
   in relation to edible insects. Particular attention will be paid to the
   evolution of legislation and to the experiences of both EU and non-EU
   countries. In recent years, a number of different stakeholders have
   supported the legalization of edible insect consumption in Europe, but
   market permission is just the first step towards a new framework for a
   novel food in a regulatory context. Once admitted, edible insects
   require proper rules to assure consumers and stakeholders of their
   benefits and safety. This overview highlights the need to develop
   clearer legislation to govern the future production and consumption of
   new food in Europe, provide guarantees to producers, and achieve
   consumer protection.}},

   molluscs: Involving stakeholders in the prioritization process based on
   consensus methods}},
Journal = {{FOOD CONTROL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{426-435}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The most recent data show that shellfish farming represents
   approximately 60\% of the total aquaculture production in Europe.
   Bivalves molluscs are internationally recognized as a potential vehicle
   for food borne diseases especially when consumed raw or improperly
   cooked. Bivalves are filter-feeding animals that may accumulate
   particles present in the surrounding water, including viruses and
   pathogenic microorganisms. For these reasons consumers have to be
   careful during purchasing, handling and cooking of this food. In Europe
   several regulations have been adopted to protect consumers' health.
   However in the development of new food safety strategies it is also
   crucial to find an effective approach to guide authorities' decisions on
   priorities for controlling foodborne risks. In the article a study for
   the selection and ranking of behavioural information on bivalve risks is
   reported. The ``consensus methods{''} provide a means of synthesising
   information and of harnessing the insights of experts to enable
   decisions shared and validated by the scientific community. The Delphi
   method and Nominal Group technique (NGT) were applied for their
   capability to assess the level of agreement and to develop consensus
   among participants. In the article, the NGT is presented as a way to
   involve relevant stakeholders in the ranking of risky behaviours from
   the production to the consumption of bivalve molluscs previously
   selected by scientific experts through the Delphi method. The inclusion
   of a full range of experts and stakeholders in a community participatory
   research project regarding food risk management represents an innovative
   approach in the Italian public health context, especially in the
   analysis of bivalve risks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{With the exception of Aelurostrongylus abstrusus, feline lungworms have
   been poorly studied. Information on their distribution is patchy and
   mostly limited to case reports. In this study, the occurrence of feline
   lungworms and co-infecting gastrointestinal parasites has been
   investigated in 12 European countries (i.e. Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria,
   France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Switzerland
   and the United Kingdom). An average of 10 domestic cats, with regular
   outdoor access, was sampled each month for 12 months, and freshly passed
   faeces were collected. Stools were processed using a McMaster assay and
   a quantitative Baermann-Wetzel method. Animals positive for lungworms
   and/or gastrointestinal parasites were treated with a formulation
   containing fipronil, (S)-methoprene, eprinomectin, and praziquantel
   (Broadline (R), Merial), and re-sampled 28 days post-treatment. The
   association between lungworm infection and risk factors was analysed
   using statistical medians/means and the efficacy of the treatment
   against each lungworm species was assessed. Of 1990 cats sampled, 613
   (30.8\%) were positive for at least one parasite, while 210 (10.6\%)
   were infected by lungworms. The prevalence of lung worm infection varied
   between the sampled sites, with the highest recorded in Bulgaria
   (35.8\%) and the lowest in Switzerland (0.8\%). None of the cats from
   Austria or the United Kingdom were infected by lungworms.
   Aelurostrongylus abstrusus was the species most frequently detected
   (78.1\%), followed by Troglostrongylus brevior (19.5\%), Eucoleus
   aerophilus (14.8\%) and Oslerus rostratus (3.8\%). The overall efficacy
   of the treatment was 99\% for A. abstrusus and 100\% for T. brevior, O.
   rostratus and E. aerophilus. Data presented provide a comprehensive
   account of the diagnosis, epidemiology and treatment of feline lungworms
   in Europe, as well as of the occurrence of co-infections by
   gastrointestinal parasites. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by

   cats the infection may be subclinical, or present as chronic bronchitis
   with various respiratory clinical signs. In Europe there is no licensed

   to deliver further evidence of the efficacy and safety of a spot-on
   formulation containing moxidectin 1 \% (w/v) and imidacloprid 10 \%
   (w/v) (Advocate (R), Advantage (R) Multi, Bayer) in the treatment of C.
   aerophila infection in cats when administered once at the approved dose
   (one pipette 0.4 ml for cats weighing 1-4 kg, one pipette 0.8 ml for
   cats weighing 4-8 kg). Efficacy was tested on days 7 +/- 1 and 11 +/- 1
   following treatment on day 0 and compared to pre-treatment faecal egg
   counts on days -6 +/- 2 and -2 +/- 2. Overall, 41 cats were enrolled in
   two groups: G1, treated with Advocate (R) (n=20 cats) and G2, left
   untreated (n=21 cats). All G1 cats were negative for C. aerophila faecal
   egg output at the post-treatment evaluation (efficacy: 100 \%) while all
   G2 cats were persistently infested with an average of 195.2 EPG.
   Differences in mean EPG values were statistically significant (p<
   0.001). Of the eleven G1 cats that showed respiratory signs at
   pre-treatment enrolment, nine fully recovered after the administration
   of Advocate (R). No adverse events occurred in treated cats. This trial
   confirmed that Advocate (R) is safe and effective in the treatment of
   feline lung capillariosis in naturally infected cats.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{113}},
Pages = {{56-61}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Mycoplasmas of humans and animals are usually associated with
   respiratory, autoimmune, genital and joint diseases. Human mycoplasmas
   have also been known to affect the brain. Severe central nervous system
   (CNS) diseases, such as encephalitis, have been linked to Mycoplasma
   pneumoniae and ureaplasma infections. Less well known is the sheep and
   goat pathogen, Mycoplasma agalacdae, which has been found in large
   quantities in the brain where it may be responsible for non-purulent
   encephalitis as well as ataxia in young animals. Experimental
   intra-mammary infections of sheep with this mycoplasma have resulted in
   histopathological changes in the CNS. The cattle pathogen, M. bovis, has
   been reported occasionally in the brains of calves and adult cattle
   showing a range of histopathological lesions including abscesses and
   fibrinous meningitis. Two avian pathogens, M. gallisepticum and M.
   synoviae have been isolated from the brains of poultry showing meningeal
   vasculitis and encephalitis. There have been no reported detections of
   two other avian pathogens, M. meleagridis or M. iowae in the CNS. Over
   the last few decades, mycoplasmas have been isolated from the brains of
   sea mammals dying in large numbers in the North Sea although it was
   concluded that their role may be secondary to underlying viral disease.

Abstract = {{Integrated tilapia-pig farming, which uses manure from pigs as
   fertilizers in fish pond, is a traditional and common production system
   practised by small-scale farmers in South-east Asia. Although such
   systems may be environmentally sustainable, they also pose potential
   food safety hazards including transmission of faecal zoonotic pathogens
   and accumulation of antimicrobial and other chemical residues. This
   study aimed to determine differences in occurrence and characteristics
   of Salmonella spp. isolated from tilapiapig and non-integrated
   aquaculture systems in Guangdong province, China. A total of 77 samples
   (9 pig feed, 19 fish feed, 9 pig faeces, 20 fish mucus and 20 fish
   intestine) from 10 tilapia-pig ponds and 10 non-integrated ponds were
   analysed. Salmonella spp. was found in fish mucus (20.0\%), fish
   intestine (40.0\%) and pig faeces (11.1\%) from integrated ponds, and
   from fish mucus (40.0\%) and fish intestine (40.0\%) from non-integrated
   ponds. S. Weltevreden (76.5\%) was by far the most common serovar
   showing limited antimicrobial resistance. One pig faeces sample
   contained S. Typhimurium whereas feed samples were found free of
   Salmonella spp.. DNA fingerprinting by the PFGE method showed a clonal
   relationship of S. Weltevreden which was supported by similar
   antimicrobial resistance patterns (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim
   resistance) as well as most isolates harbouring a 147-kb sized plasmid.
   The common finding of S. Weltevreden in both tilapia production systems
   indicates that this serovar may have a different ecology and increased
   survival in aquaculture environments in comparison with other Salmonella
   serovars. Further in vivo studies of the ecology of S. Weltevreden in
   aquaculture environments are needed. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial environmental and surgical site infection (SSI) surveillance
   was implemented from 2011-2016 in a UK Equine Referral Veterinary
   Hospital and identified 81 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
   (MRSA) isolates. A cluster of MRSA SSIs occurred in early 2016 with the
   isolates confirmed as ST398 by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), which
   prompted retrospective analysis of all MRSA isolates obtained from the
   environment (n = 62), SSIs (n = 13) and hand plates (n = 6) in the past
   five years. Sixty five of these isolates were typed to CC398 and a
   selection of these (n = 38) were further characterised for resistance
   and virulence genes, SCCmec and spa typing. Overall, MRSA was identified
   in 62/540 (11.5\%) of environmental samples, 6/81 of the hand-plates
   (7.4\%) and 13/208 of the SSIs (6.3\%). spa t011 was the most frequent
   (24/38) and Based Upon Repeat Pattern (BURP) analysis identified spa
   t011 as one of the two group founders of the main spa CC identified
   across the five years (spa CC011/3423). However, 3 singletons (t073,
   t786, t064) were also identified suggesting separate introductions into
   the hospital environment. This long-term MRSA surveillance study
   revealed multiple introductions of MRSA CC398 in a UK Equine Hospital,

Title = {{Prevention of feline leishmaniosis with an imidacloprid 10\%/flumethrin
   4.5\% polymer matrix collar}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JUL 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Leishmaniosis caused by Leishmania infantum is one of the
   most important vector-borne diseases affecting animals and humans
   worldwide. Dogs are considered main reservoirs of the zoonotic forms,
   though in the last years the role of cats as reservoirs has been
   increasingly investigated. Feline leishmaniosis (FeL) occurs in endemic
   areas and no specific preventive measures have been investigated so far.
   In this study the efficacy of a 10\% imidacloprid/4.5\% flumethrin
   polymer matrix collar, licensed for tick and flea prevention, has been
   assessed against FeL in a longitudinal study on 204 privately owned cats
   from the Aeolian islands (Sicily), an area highly endemic for the
   disease. From March to May 2015 {[}Study Day 0 (SD 0)], cats negative
   for FeL were collared (G1, n = 104) or left untreated (G2, n = 100).
   Diagnosis consisted of serology and qPCR on blood and conjunctival
   swabs, which were collected at baseline (SD 0) and at the end of the
   study (SD 360). Interim clinical examinations were performed on SD 210
   (when collars were replaced in G1) and SD 270.
   Results: Of the 159 cats which completed the study, 5 in G1 and 20 in G2
   were positive for L. infantum infection, in at least one of the
   diagnostic tests leading to a yearly crude incidence of 6.3\% and 25.0\%
   in G1 and G2, respectively (P = 0.0026). This translates into an
   efficacy of the collar of 75.0\% in preventing feline Leishmania
   infection. The collar was generally well tolerated with no systemic
   adverse reactions and few local skin reactions were observed in the
   application area in four out of 104 treated cats (3.8\%).
   Conclusions: The 10\% imidacloprid/4.5\% flumethrin collar significantly
   reduced the risk of L. infantum infection in cats. To our knowledge,
   this is the first study in which a preventative strategy against feline
   Leishmania infection is assessed under natural conditions. These
   findings close a gap in veterinary medicine, in that they confirm this
   collar as a tool in reducing the risk of Leishmania infection in cats.
   Such a preventative tool could contribute to the reduction of the risk
   of the disease in animal and in human populations when included in
   integrated leishmaniosis control programmes.}},

Abstract = {{West Nile virus lineage 2 (WNV-2) was mainly confined to sub-Saharan
   Africa until the early 2000s, when it was identified for the first time
   in Central Europe causing outbreaks of human and animal infection. The
   aim of this study was to reconstruct the origin and dispersion of WNV-2
   in Central Europe and Italy on a phylodynamic and phylogeographical
   basis. To this aim, discrete and continuous space phylogeographical
   models were applied to a total of 33 newly characterised full-length
   viral genomes obtained from mosquitoes, birds and humans in Northern
   Italy in the years 2013-2015 aligned with 64 complete sequences isolated
   mainly in Europe. The European isolates segregated into two highly
   significant clades: a small one including three sequences and a large
   clade including the majority of isolates obtained in Central Europe
   since 2004. Discrete phylogeographical analysis showed that the most
   probable location of the root of the largest European clade was in
   Hungary a mean 12.78 years ago. The European clade bifurcated into two
   highly supported subclades: one including most of the Central/East
   European isolates and the other encompassing all of the isolates
   obtained in Greece. The continuous space phylogeographical analysis of
   the Italian clade showed that WNV-2 entered Italy in about 2008,
   probably by crossing the Adriatic sea and reaching a central area of the
   Po Valley. The epidemic then spread simultaneously eastward, to reach
   the region of the Po delta in 2013, and westward to the border area
   between Lombardy and Piedmont in 2014; later, the western strain changed
   direction southward, and reached the central area of the Po valley once
   again in 2015. Over a period of about seven years, the virus spread all
   over an area of northern Italy by following the Po river and its main
   tributaries.}},

Abstract = {{Drug addiction is a major care and safety challenge in prison context.
   Nowadays, rehabilitation and specific therapeutic programs are suggested
   to improve health and well-being of inmates during their detention time
   and to reduce substance abuse relapse after release from prison. Among
   these programs, several studies reported the benefits for inmates coming
   from animal assisted interventions. In this pilot controlled study, we
   investigated the efficacy of a dog assisted therapy program addressed to
   22 drug addicted male inmates housed in an attenuated custody institute
   in Italy. The study lasted six months, the treated group (12 inmates)
   was involved once a week for one hour in 20 dog assisted therapy
   sessions, whereas the control group (10 inmates) followed the standard
   rehabilitation program. One week before the beginning and one week after
   the end of the sessions, all inmates involved were submitted to symptom
   checklist-90-revised and Kennedy axis V. Inmates involved in the dog
   assisted therapy sessions significantly improved their social skills,
   reducing craving, anxiety and depression symptoms compared to the
   control group. Despite the limitation due to the small number of inmates
   enrolled and to the absence of follow up, we found these results
   encouraging to the use of dog assisted therapy as co-therapy in drug
   addicted inmates rehabilitation programs, and we claim the need of more
   extensive study on this subject.}},

Abstract = {{Given the growing risk of arbovirus outbreaks in Europe, there is a
   clear need to better describe the distribution of invasive mosquito
   species such as Aedes albopictus. Current challenges consist in
   simulating Ae. albopictus abundance, rather than its presence, and
   mapping its simulated abundance at a local scale to better assess the
   transmission risk of mosquito-borne pathogens and optimize mosquito
   control strategy. During 2014-2015, we sampled adult mosquitoes using 72
   BG-Sentinel traps per year in the provinces of Belluno and Trento,
   Italy. We found that the sum of Ae. albopictus females collected during
   eight trap nights from June to September was positively related to the
   mean temperature of the warmest quarter and the percentage of artificial
   areas in a 250 m buffer around the sampling locations. Maps of Ae.
   albopictus abundance simulated from the most parsimonious model in the
   study area showed the largest populations in highly artificial areas
   with the highest summer temperatures, but with a high uncertainty due to
   the variability of the trapping collections. Vector abundance maps at a
   local scale should be promoted to support stakeholders and policy-makers
   in optimizing vector surveillance and control.}},

   present study, a total of 1734 raw milk samples were collected, and
   qualitatively screened with two different tests, the Delvotest SP assay
   and an enzyme-linked receptor-binding assay (SNAP). Overall, 106
   (6.11\%) out of 1734 samples examined with Delvotest SP contained
   possible drug residues (5.12\% and 7.51\% of samples from 2009 and 2010,

   distinct enzyme-linked receptor-binding assays specific for beta-lactams
   (new beta-lactam test), tetracyclines (SNAP tetracycline test), and
   sulfonamides (SNAP sulfamethazine test). Only the new SNAP beta-lactam
   test detected residues in 40 out of 52 samples in 2009 and 54 out of 54
   suspect samples in 2010. A confirmatory method based on liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to confirm the presence
   of beta-lactam drug residues in samples detected by the enzyme-linked

   the most frequently detected residues and were in a concentration range
   between 2.1 mu g/kg and 1973 mu g/kg. Seventeen of the positive samples
   exceeded the maximum residue levels for one or more beta-lactam drug.
   The highest number of positive milk samples came from the Peje Region

Abstract = {{Introduction The surveillance of illegal anabolic practices in bovine
   meat production is necessary to guarantee consumers' health. Screening
   strategies based on the recognition of indirect biological effects are
   considered by the community as promising tools to overcome some
   limitations of classical analytical methods and might therefore concur
   to ensure safer food for the consumer.
   Objectives The present work aims at characterizing the metabolic profile
   induced in liver by administration of anabolic steroids, and at
   identifying potential disturbances in the hepatic metabolism.
   Methods A total of 32 liver samples, 16 from untreated bulls and 16 from
   bulls treated with an ear implant (Revalor-XS (R)) containing trenbolone
   acetate (200 mg) and beta-estradiol (40 mg), were analyzed following a
   LC-MS-based metabolomic analysis combining RP and HILIC chromatographic
   separations. Different multivariate statistical tools were applied to
   the datasets to select common metabolites that may be considered as
   potential markers based on their significant changes in concentrations
   after administration of sexual steroids.
   Results Eight candidate markers were identified. Moreover, a subset of
   four markers was also validated by a different laboratory that performed
   the same analysis using an independent instrumental and elaboration
   platform, confirming the robustness of the results achieved.
   Conclusion This study was performed mimicking experimental conditions
   that may be used during a potential misuse practice. It is promising in
   the objective of setting up an analytical strategy to highlight sexual
   steroids abuse in livestock animals.}},

Title = {{Ticks and associated pathogens in dogs from Greece}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JUN 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: With the aim to assess the occurrence of hard ticks and the
   pathogens they may carry in dogs from Greece, ixodid specimens (n = 757)
   were collected from 310 animals living in six provinces across the Greek
   peninsula. All ticks were morphologically identified, and genomic DNA
   was extracted from 344 (45.5\%) representative specimens, according to
   their species, engorgement status and sampling area. The occurrence of
   Anaplasma spp., Ehrlichia spp., Hepatozoon spp., Rickettsia spp.,
   Babesia spp., Theileria spp. and Cercopithifilaria spp. was assessed by
   conventional and quantitative real-time PCR.
   Results: Overall, 150 dogs (48.4\%) were infested by ticks, with
   Rhipicephalus sanguineus (sensu lato) being the most prevalent (70.1\%),
   followed by Haemaphysalis parva (14.7\%), Rhipicephalus turanicus
   (11.4\%), and Haemaphysalis concinna (2.4\%). Out of 344 specimens
   molecularly examined, 41 (11.1\%) were positive for at least one
   microorganism (i.e. 5.5\% for Cercopithifilaria bainae, 2.9\% for
   Hepatozoon canis, 1.7\% for Rickettsia hoogstraalii, 1.2\% for
   Hepatozoon felis, 0.6\% for Rickettsia massiliae, 0.6\% for Theileria
   ovis, 0.3\% for Anaplasma platys and 0.3\% for Coxiella
   like-endosymbiont).
   Conclusions: The results of this study show that different tick species

Abstract = {{Background: Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) have been increasingly reported
   in dogs and cats worldwide. However, no data are currently available
   regarding canine and feline VBDs in Qatar and limited information is
   available from other Persian Gulf countries.
   Methods: Blood samples from 98 client-owned animals (i.e. 64 dogs and 34
   cats) living in Doha (Qatar) were collected and the presence of genomic
   DNA of Anaplasma spp., Babesia spp., Dirofilaria spp., Ehrlichia spp.,
   Hepatozoon spp., Mycoplasma spp. and Rickettsia spp. was assessed by
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real time-PCR (rt-PCR) and sequence
   analysis.
   Results: Of the 64 dogs, 12 (18.8\%) were infected with at least one
   pathogen (i.e. 7.8\% with Mycoplasma spp., 4.7\% with Babesia vogeli,
   3.1\% with Ehrlichia canis, and 1.6\% with Anaplasma platys, Babesia
   gibsoni and Hepatozoon canis, each). One of the 12 dogs was co-infected
   with B. vogeli and E. canis. Of the 34 cats, seven (20.6\%) animals were
   infected with at least one pathogen (i.e. 5.9\% were positive for
   Mycoplasma spp., and 2.9\% for Babesia felis, B. vogeli, E. canis,
   ``Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum{''} and Mycoplasma haemofelis,
   each). No dogs or cats were positive for Dirofilaria spp. or Rickettsia
   spp.
   Conclusions: Although the sample sizes of dogs and cats herein analysed
   was moderately small, data from this study report the occurrence of A.
   platys, B. vogeli, B. gibsoni, E. canis, H. canis and Mycoplasma spp. in
   domestic dogs and of B. felis, B. vogeli, ``Candidatus M.
   haemominutum{''}, E. canis and M. haemofelis in domestic cats from
   Qatar. Further investigations along with prophylactic measures are
   strongly recommended in order to reduce the risk of dogs and cats
   acquiring VBDs in Qatar.}},

Abstract = {{After the H7N7 highly pathogenic (HP) avian influenza (AI) outbreak in
   2013, and a single case of H5N8 HPAI in 2014, in April 2016, a H7N7 HPAI
   virus was detected in northeastern Italy. The case occurred in an
   organic free-range laying hen farm located in proximity with one of the
   highest densely populated poultry areas (DPPAs) in Italy. Control
   measures provided by the Council of the European Union in directive
   2005/94/CE were promptly applied, and enhanced surveillance activities
   were implemented in the DPPAs. On May 16, 2016, a second case was
   confirmed in a fattening turkey farm within the protection zone of the
   previous outbreak. Following an epidemiologic inquiry, another turkey
   farm was considered at risk of transmission and was subjected to
   preemptive culling. Epidemiologic data and phylogenetic analyses
   indicated that the virus was likely introduced from wild birds as a low
   pathogenicity AI strain, through direct contact. The rapid containment
   of the outbreak proves the level of preparedness of the veterinary
   public health sector in Italy. Nevertheless, the recurrent introductions
   from wild birds indicate the need of improving both the biosecurity
   levels in the DPPA and the surveillance activities in wild birds to
   quickly detect the presence of AI in the territory.}},

Abstract = {{In the early 2000s, Italian beekeepers began to report bee mortality

   (fipronil) used for seed dressing that were dispersed in the environment
   during sowing. Following these events and based on the precautionary
   principle, in September 2008, the Italian Ministry of Health suspended
   these four active ingredients as maize seed dressing. Here we show that
   in Italy after the precautionary suspension, the number of bee mortality
   events linked to maize sowing drastically declined. At the same time,
   the average annual maize production per hectare remained unchanged. This
   finding is indicative of the possibility to maintain stable maize
   productions without affecting honey bee health status. The

Title = {{Analysis of domestic refrigerator temperatures and home storage time
   distributions for shelf-life studies and food safety risk assessment}},
Journal = {{FOOD RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{171-181}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In the framework of food safety, when mimicking the consumer phase, the
   storage time and temperature used are mainly considered as single point
   estimates instead of probability distributions. This singlepoint
   approach does not take into account the variability within a population
   and could lead to an overestimation of the parameters. Therefore, the
   aim of this study was to analyse data on domestic refrigerator
   temperatures and storage times of chilled food in European countries in
   order to draw general rules which could be used either in shelf life
   testing or risk assessment. In relation to domestic refrigerator
   temperatures, 15 studies provided pertinent data. Twelve studies
   presented normal distributions, according to the authors or from the
   data fitted into distributions. Analysis of temperature distributions
   revealed that the countries were separated into two groups: northern
   European countries and southern European countries. The overall
   variability of European domestic refrigerators is described by a normal
   distribution: N (7.0, 2.7) degrees C for southern countries, and, N
   (6.1, 2.8) degrees C for the northern countries. Concerning storage
   times, seven papers were pertinent. Analysis indicated that the storage
   time was likely to end in the first days or weeks (depending on the
   product use-by-date) after purchase. Data fitting showed the exponential
   distribution was the most appropriate distribution to describe the time
   that food spent at consumer's place. The storage time was described by
   an exponential distribution corresponding to the use-by date period
   divided by 4. In conclusion, knowing that collecting data is time and
   money consuming, in the absence of data, and at least for the European
   market and for refrigerated products, building a domestic refrigerator
   temperature distribution using a Normal law and a time-to-consumption
   distribution using an Exponential law would be appropriate. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are of interest due to their antimicrobial
   activity and are seen as potential candidates to replace antibiotics in
   animal husbandry. A few studies have focused on this new application,
   but they lack any considerations about residual accumulation of AgNPs in
   edible animal tissues and animal products. In this research, a 22 day in
   vivo study was carried out by oral administration of 20 nm spherical PVP
   coated AgNPs to hens. Six doses of approximately 1 mg kg(-1) of
   AgNPs-PVP each were administered to animals throughout the
   experimentation. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) was used for
   quantitative determination of residual total Ag in different organs and
   matrices. The analyses showed that Ag accumulates in livers
   (concentration ranging from 141 mu g kg(-1) to 269,mu g kg(-1)) and
   yolks (concentration ranging from 20 mu g kg(-1) to 49 mu g kg(-1)) but
   not in muscles, kidneys, and albumen belonging to hens of the treated
   group (tG2). Ag was not detected in animals of the control group (uG1)
   (i.e., total Ag < LOD = 10 mu g kg(-1)). Single particle inductively
   coupled plasma mass spectrometry (spICP-MS) and scanning electron
   microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray detection (SEM-EDX) were
   employed to elucidate the presence of AgNPs in livers and yolks
   belonging to tG2 animals. spICP-MS highlighted that part of residual Ag
   found in livers (about 5-20\%) is in NP form with an average dimension
   of approximately 20 nm. SEM-EDX technique confirmed the presence of
   AgNPs only in livers of treated animals. The results show that feeding
   AgNPs to hens may become a source of consumer exposure to AgNPs. As far
   as we know this is the first study showing transfer of AgNPs or reaction
   products thereof from animal feed to animal products.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{Viral nervous necrosis (VNN) certainly represents the biggest challenge
   for the sustainability and the development of aquaculture. A large
   number of economically relevant fish species have proven to be
   susceptible to the disease. Conversely, gilthead sea bream has generally
   been considered resistant to VNN, although it has been possible to
   isolate the virus from apparently healthy sea bream and sporadically
   from affected larvae and postlarvae. Unexpectedly, in 2014-2016 an
   increasing number of hatcheries in Europe have experienced mass
   mortalities in sea bream larvae. Two clinical outbreaks were monitored
   over this time span and findings are reported in this paper. Despite
   showing no specific clinical signs, the affected fish displayed high
   mortality and histological lesions typical of VNN. Fish tested positive
   for betanodavirus by different laboratory techniques. The isolates were
   all genetically characterized as being reassortant strains RGNNV/SJNNV.
   A genetic characterization of all sea bream betanodaviruses which had
   been isolated in the past had revealed that the majority of the strains
   infecting sea bream are actually RGNNV/SJNNV. Taken together, this
   information strongly suggests that RGNNV/SJNNV betanodavirus possesses a
   particular tropism to sea bream, which can pose a new and unexpected
   threat to the Mediterranean aquaculture.}},

Abstract = {{Aedes koreicus (Edwards) is an invasive mosquito species, like Aedes
   albopictus (Skuse) and Aedes japonicus japonicus (Theobald), that has
   already colonized a large part of northeastern Italy and other European
   countries. Despite its rapid expansion, information about adult
   distribution and trapping is lacking. Here, we conducted a 2-yr
   longitudinal survey using adult traps to investigate the spatiotemporal
   distribution of Ae. koreicus and evaluated the effectiveness of three
   trapping devices in Latin square experiments conducted in an urban site
   and a forested site. The following three different traps were compared:
   a CO2-baited Biogents (BG) Sentinel trap, a CO2-baited Centers for
   Disease Control and Prevention light trap (CDC trap), and a grass
   infusion-baited gravid trap.
   In northern Italy, Ae. koreicus was collected from late April to early
   November, with peak of abundance observed in August. Aedes koreicus was
   more abundant in 2015 than in 2014 because of higher temperatures during
   summer. Unlike Ae. albopictus, the abundance of Ae. koreicus was not
   related to the altitude of the sampling locations in the range 241-660 m
   above sea level. The BG Sentinel and gravid traps collected
   significantly more Ae. koreicus than the CDC trap in the urban site,
   whereas there was no significant difference between the three traps in
   the forested site. In the urban site, the BG Sentinel trap and the
   gravid trap were the most effective for collecting Ae. albopictus and
   Culex pipiens L., respectively. In the forested site, Cx. pipiens was
   primarily collected by the CDC trap.}},

Abstract = {{Cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3) is the aetiological agent of a serious
   infective, notifiable disease affecting common carp and varieties. In
   survivors, infection is generally characterized by a subclinical latency
   phase with restricted viral replication. The CyHV-3 genome is difficult
   to detect in such carrier fish that represent a potential source of
   dissemination if viral reactivation occurs. In this study, the
   analytical and diagnostic performance of an alternative serum
   neutralization (SN) method based on the detection of CyHV-3-specific
   antibodies was assessed using 151 serum or plasma samples from healthy
   and naturally or experimentally CyHV-3-infected carp. French CyHV-3
   isolate 07/108b was neutralized efficiently by sera from carp infected
   with European, American and Taiwanese CyHV-3 isolates, but no
   neutralization was observed using sera specific to other aquatic
   herpesviruses. Diagnostic sensitivity, diagnostic specificity and
   repeatability of 95.9\%, 99.0\% and 99.3\%, respectively, were obtained,
   as well as a compliance rate of 89.9\% in reproducibility testing.
   Neutralizing antibodies were steadily detected in infected carp
   subjected to restrictive or permissive temperature variations over more
   than 25months post-infection. The results suggest that this non-lethal
   diagnostic test could be used in the future to improve the
   epidemiological surveillance and control of CyHV-3 disease.}},

Abstract = {{Usutu (USUV) and West Nile (WNV) are mosquito-borne Flavivirus emerged
   in Italy in 1996 and 1998, respectively, and reappeared 10 years later.
   The aim of this work is to review the Italian mosquito species found
   positive for WNV and USUV between 2008 and 2014. Moreover, the role of
   mosquitoes in promoting the overwintering of these viruses is discussed,
   as a result of the mosquito collections performed in Molise region
   between September 2010 and April 2011. Overall 99,000 mosquitoes were
   collected: 337 and 457 mosquito pools tested positive by real time
   reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (real time RT-PCR) for
   WNV and USUV, respectively. West Nile virus was detected in pools of
   Culex pipiens s.l. (329), Ochlerotatus caspius (4), Culex modestus (2),
   and Culex spp. (2). Positive USUV pools were from Cx. pipiens s.l.
   (435), Aedes albopictus (12), Oc. caspius (5), Culex spp. (2), Anopheles
   maculipennis s.l. (1), Culiseta annulata (1), and Ochlerotatus detritus
   (1). In Molise region, 1,694 mosquitoes were collected, and USUV was
   identified in Cx. pipiens s.l., Cs. annulata, and Oc. detritus pools.
   This paper shows that Cx. pipiens s.l. is the mosquito species most
   involved in the WNV and USUV circulation in Italy, although other
   species would also support the spread of both the viruses during Winter.}},

Abstract = {{Edema disease (ED), caused by Escherichia coli has a huge economic
   impact on swine breeding. The capability to colonize hosts and survive
   in the environment is linked to biofilm formation. Biofilm is defined as
   a structured community of bacterial cells enclosed in a self-produced
   polymer matrix that is attached to a surface. Bacteria within biofilms
   can withstand host immune responses, and are much less susceptible to
   antibiotics and to disinfectants when compared with their planktonic
   counterparts. Many bacterial surface structures, including curli,
   flagella, pili and exopolysaccharide, play a role in various aspects of
   biofilm development. In this study we have examined the biofilm
   formation in 65 E. coli field strains, isolated from ED affected pigs.
   Using phenotypic assays, curli fimbriae and cellulose, two extracellular
   structures contributing to biofilm formation were investigated. Results
   showed that 23\% of the strains were classified as strong biofilm
   producers while 71\% were regarded as weak biofilm producers. All the
   O-138 serotypes were weak producers, while the majority (73\%) of the
   O-139 types were strong biofilm producer strains. Moreover, there is a
   different expression of both the studied structures, at the two tested
   temperatures. Noteworthy, 75\% of the E. coli strains isolated during
   episodes of ED produced curli fimbriae at 37 degrees C. A significant
   association has been observed between the O-type and the production of
   the biofilm and a significant difference in the morphotype results was
   observed on the basis of the used temperature. Our observations reveal
   E. coli from ED are biofilm formers, with different expression of the
   both studied structures, which may be linked to a role in virulence.}},

Abstract = {{Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm) and its monophasic variant
   4,{[}5],12:i-: (VMSTm) have been responsible for an increased number of
   foodborne infections in humans in Europe in recent years. The aim of
   this study was to investigate the origin of three foodborne
   salmonellosis outbreaks that occurred in Pavia Province (Lombardy
   region, northern Italy) in 2010. Phenotypic and genetic characteristics
   of the STm and VMSTm isolates from patients and from food that were
   recovered in the framework of the three outbreaks were evaluated through
   serotyping, phage typing, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, pulsed
   field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and multiple-locus variable-number
   tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). Salami from three artisan producers,
   which had all purchased meat from the same slaughterhouse, was the food
   source of infection in outbreak I. STm isolates were recovered from
   salami and patients with symptoms of gastroenteritis. These isolates had
   the same PFGE type and the same rare MLVA profile (3-18-9-NA-211). The
   same molecular profiles were found in an STm isolate from a salami,
   which likely was the source of another family outbreak (II). A VMSTm
   strain with common phenotypic and molecular profiles was isolated from
   three hospitalized patients and identified as the cause of another
   putative outbreak (111). During the following 3 years (2011 through
   2013), 360 salami produced in Pavia Province were monitored for the
   presence of S. enterica. In 2011, no STm and VMSTm isolates were
   recovered from 159 salami tested. During 2012 and 2013, 13.9\% of 201
   tested salami harbored S. enterica, and half of the isolates were VMSTm,
   mainly in salami from those artisan producers involved in the previous
   outbreaks. These isolates were genetically variable, especially in terms
   of MLVA profiles. The data collected suggest that from 2012, VMSTm has
   replaced STm in the environments of the salami producers monitored in
   this study, and these data confirm the dominance of this emergent
   serovar along the pork supply chain.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the food risk perceptions of people living in
   the Triveneto area (Northeast Italy), a territory characterized by a
   particular interest in the production of quality foodstuffs, to
   determine what aspects people associate with food risk and to understand
   what beliefs underlie these perceptions.
   Four focus groups were conducted in the major towns of the target area
   (N = 45). A semi-structured interview was used that focused on beliefs
   about food risks, the use of information and media sources in relation
   to food risk, and the behaviours adopted when eating outside the home.
   A homogeneous view of food risk emerged among the respondents, and a
   common definition of risky food was identified. The concept of risk was
   in opposition to the quality and controllability of food, which emerged
   as major strategies to cope with food risks. Quality was linked to
   freshness and local origin, whereas controllability reflected a direct
   (e.g., checking labels, having a relationship with the vendor,
   cultivating one's own vegetable garden) or indirect (e.g., control
   guarantees provided by suppliers and the government) means to check the
   safety and quality of food. Although people seemed quite informed about
   food risks, a common sense of impotence with regard to one's own
   protection prevailed, together with a fatalistic sense of incomplete
   control over risk.
   The results identified food concerns for consumers living in this
   specific territory and might represent a starting point for public
   health authorities to increase compliance with responsible behaviours
   for risk mitigation and to define successful food policies for this
   area. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are prevalently investigated in dogs.
   Studies on feline VBDs are scant, though feline leishmaniosis (FeL) is
   increasingly recognised as a disease of cats in endemic areas.
   Comprehensive investigations on the distribution of VBDs in populations
   of cats and dogs living in relatively small geographical areas, such as
   islands, are currently lacking. In this study the prevalence of
   Leishmania infantum and other VBD pathogens was assessed in cohorts of
   cats and dogs living in the Aeolian Islands.
   Autochthonous animals (330 cats and 263 dogs) of different age and sex
   were sampled. Blood and conjunctival samples were collected from cats
   and dogs for serological and molecular testing. Eighty-five (25.8\%)
   cats were positive for L. infantum, 13 (3.9\%) for Bartonella spp. and 1
   (0.3\%) for Hepatozoon felis. One-hundred and ten dogs (41.8\%) were
   positive for L. infantum and three (1.1\%) for Hepatozoon canis. The
   incidence of L. infantum infection in cats positive after one season of
   exposure to sand fly was 14.7\%. Leishmania infantum prevalence and year
   incidence were higher in dogs than in cats (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.0003,
   respectively). Thirty-four cats (10.3\%) scored positive for ticks (mean
   intensity rate of infestation, 2.03 +/- 1.4), which were identified to
   the species level as Ixodes ventalloi and Rhipicephalus pusillus.
   Conversely, Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (s.I.) was the only
   species identified in dogs (10.6\%). A larger prevalence of infestation
   by Ctenocephalides felis was recorded in cats (n = 91; 27.6\%) than in
   dogs (n = 33; 12.5\%) (p = 0.0001). In addition, one female Nosopsyllus
   fasciatus (syn. Ceratophyllus fasciatus) and one male Spilopsyllus
   cuniculi were also identified in flea-infected cats. VBDs are endemic in
   the Aeolian Islands being L. infantum the most prevalent vector-borne
   pathogen circulating between cats and dogs. The overall seroprevalence
   of FeL herein recorded is higher than that assessed, only by IFAT, in
   populations of cats in Greece and in Spain. Because L infantum and VBDs
   are more commonly associated with dogs, the recognition of cats as hosts
   of different vector-borne pathogens is of paramount importance towards a
   better management of these diseases in both animals and humans. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Background: Hemotropic mycoplasmas (hemoplasmas), the agents of
   infectious anemia, have been reported in dogs and cats. Little data are
   available on hemoplasma infections in Italy. The aim of this study was
   to evaluate the species of hemoplasmas and their prevalence in dogs and
   cats of northern Italy.
   Methods: Blood samples were obtained from 117 candidate blood donor
   dogs, 278 free-roaming dogs and 227 free-roaming cats in 2014 and 2015.
   Samples were first screened for hemoplasmas with a SYBR green real time
   PCR. The positive samples were confirmed by a second SYBR green real
   time PCR and sequencing. Co-infections were detected using
   species-specific SYBR green real time PCR.
   Results: The overall prevalence in dogs was 4.5\% (18/395). Among the
   donors only one dog was positive for Mycoplasma haemocanis (0.8\%). The
   overall prevalence of infection in free-roaming dogs was 6.1\% (17/278),
   which was significantly higher than in candidate donors (P < 0.05). Both
   M. haemocanis (13/278; 4.7\%) and ``Candidatus M. haematoparvum{''}
   (4/278; 1.4\%) were identified. In dogs, no significant association was
   found between hemoplasma infection and gender, age or origin. The
   overall prevalence in cats was 13.2\% (30/227). All three feline
   hemoplasma species were detected, i.e. ``Candidatus Mycoplasma
   haemominutum{''} (28; 12.3\%), ``Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis{''}
   (11; 4.8\%) and Mycoplasma haemofelis (9; 4.0\%). Half of the infected
   cats were co-infected (15; 6.6\%) with different species of hemoplasmas.
   Risk factor analysis confirmed that older age, male gender and FIV
   positivity are predisposing factors for hemoplasma infection in cats.
   Conclusion: This study found that candidate blood donor dogs in northern
   Italy show a negligible risk for hemoplasma infection, confirming the
   appropriateness of the candidate selection criteria and the low
   prevalence in the study area. Accordingly, testing for hemoplasma should
   be considered optional for canine blood donor screening. Hemoplasma
   infection was instead common in free-roaming cats, and is expected to be
   non-negligible in owned cats with outdoor access. Feline candidates for
   blood donation will therefore need to be carefully selected.}},

Title = {{Salmonella serovars and their distribution in Nigerian commercial
   chicken layer farms}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 9}},
Abstract = {{Commercial poultry farms (n degrees 523), located in all the six regions
   of Nigeria were sampled with a view to generate baseline information
   about the distribution of Salmonella serovars in this country. Five
   different matrices (litter, dust, faeces, feed and water) were collected
   from each visited farm. Salmonella was isolated from at least one of the
   five matrices in 228 farms, with a farm prevalence of 43.6\%
   (CI95{[}39.7-48.3\%]). Altogether, 370 of 2615 samples collected
   (14.1\%, CI95{[}12.8; 15.5\%]) contained Salmonella. Considering the
   number of positive farms and the number of positive samples, it was
   evident that for the majority of the sampled farms, few samples were
   positive for Salmonella. With regard to the matrices, there was no
   difference in Salmonella prevalence among the five matrices considered.
   Of the 370 isolates serotyped, eighty-two different serotypes were
   identified and Salmonella Kentucky was identified as having the highest
   isolation rate in all the matrices sampled (16.2\%), followed by S.
   Poona and S. Elisabethville. S. Kentucky was distributed across the
   country, whereas the other less frequent serovars had a more
   circumscribed diffusion. This is one of few comprehensive studies on the
   occurrence and distribution of Salmonella in commercial chicken layer
   farms from all the six regions of Nigeria. The relatively high
   prevalence rate documented in this study may be attributed to the
   generally poor infrastructure and low biosecurity measures in
   controlling stray animals, rodents and humans. Data collected could be
   valuable for instituting effective intervention strategies for
   Salmonella control in Nigeria and also in other developing countries
   with a similar poultry industry structure, with the final aim of
   reducing Salmonella spread in animals and ultimately in humans.}},

Month = {{MAR 9}},
Abstract = {{Reports of honey bee population decline has spurred many national
   efforts to understand the extent of the problem and to identify
   causative or associated factors. However, our collective understanding
   of the factors has been hampered by a lack of joined up trans-national
   effort. Moreover, the impacts of beekeeper knowledge and beekeeping
   management practices have often been overlooked, despite honey bees
   being a managed pollinator. Here, we established a standardised active
   monitoring network for 5 798 apiaries over two consecutive years to
   quantify honey bee colony mortality across 17 European countries. Our
   data demonstrate that overwinter losses ranged between 2\% and 32\%, and
   that high summer losses were likely to follow high winter losses.
   Multivariate Poisson regression models revealed that hobbyist beekeepers
   with small apiaries and little experience in beekeeping had double the
   winter mortality rate when compared to professional beekeepers.
   Furthermore, honey bees kept by professional beekeepers never showed
   signs of disease, unlike apiaries from hobbyist beekeepers that had
   symptoms of bacterial infection and heavy Varroa infestation. Our data
   highlight beekeeper background and apicultural practices as major
   drivers of honey bee colony losses. The benefits of conducting
   trans-national monitoring schemes and improving beekeeper training are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Skeletal muscle fibers contain different isoforms of myosin heavy chain
   (MyHC) that define distinctive contractile properties. In light of the
   muscle capacity to adapt MyHC expression to pathophysiological
   conditions, a rapid and quantitative assessment of MyHC isoforms in
   small muscle tissue quantities would represent a valuable diagnostic
   tool for (neuro)muscular diseases. As past protocols did not meet these
   requirements, in the present study we applied a targeted proteomic
   approach based on selected reaction monitoring that allowed the absolute
   quantification of slow and fast MyHC isoforms in different mouse
   skeletal muscles with high reproducibility. This mass-spectrometry-based
   method was validated also in a pathological specimen, by comparison of
   the MyHC expression profiles in different muscles from healthy mice and
   a genetic mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) expressing
   the SOD1(G93A) mutant. This analysis showed that terminally ill ALS mice
   have a fast-to-slow shift in the fiber type composition of the tibialis
   anterior and gastrocnemius muscles, as previously reported. These
   results will likely open the way to accurate and rapid diagnoses of
   human (neuro)muscular diseases by the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Rabbit meat has outstanding dietetic and nutritional properties.
   However, few data on microbiological hazards associated with rabbit
   productions are available. In this study, the presence of Listeria
   monocytogenes was determined in 430 rabbit carcasses, 256 rabbit meat
   cuts and products, and 599 environmental sponges collected from four
   Italian rabbit slaughterhouses over a period of 1 year. Prevalence of L.
   monocytogenes among the 1285 rabbit meat and environmental samples was
   11\%, with statistically significant differences between
   slaughterhouses. The highest prevalence (33.6\%) was observed in rabbit
   meat cuts and products; the majority of positive environmental samples
   were collected from conveyor belts. Overall, 27.9\% and 14.3\% of rabbit
   cuts and carcasses, respectively, had L. monocytogenes counts higher
   than 1 colony-forming unit (CFU)/10g. A selection of 123 isolates from
   positive samples was genotyped and serotyped to determine genetic
   profiles and diversity among L. monocytogenes isolates contaminating
   different slaughterhouses and classes of products investigated.
   Discriminatory power and concordance among the results obtained using
   multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA), multilocus
   sequence typing (MLST), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE),
   automated EcoRI ribotyping, and serotyping were assessed. The isolates
   selected for typing were classified into serotypes 1/2a (52.8\%), 1/2c
   (32.5\%), and 1/2b (14.6\%). The majority of the isolates were
   classified as ST14 (34.1\%), ST9 (35.5\%), ST121 (17.9\%), and ST224
   (14.6\%). The greatest discriminatory power was observed with the MLVA
   typing, followed by MLST, PFGE, and ribotyping. The best bidirectional
   concordance was achieved between PFGE and MLST. There was 100\%
   correlation between both MLST and MLVA with serotype. Moreover, a high
   unidirectional correspondence was observed between MLVA and both MLST
   and PFGE, as well as between PFGE and both MLST and serotyping. The
   results of this study show for the first time in Italy prevalence and
   genetic profiles of L. monocytogenes isolated in rabbit products and

Abstract = {{The current European Union (EU) legislation decrees that pets entering
   the EU from a rabies-infected third country have to obtain a
   satisfactory virus-neutralizing antibody level, while those moving
   within the EU require only rabies vaccination as the risk of moving a
   rabid pet within the EU is considered negligible. A number of factors
   driving individual variations in dog vaccine response have been
   previously reported, including a high rate of vaccine failure in
   puppies, especially those subject to commercial transport. A total of
   21001 observations collected from dogs (2006-2012) vaccinated in
   compliance with the current EU regulations were statistically analysed
   to assess the effect of different risk factors related to rabies vaccine
   efficacy. Within this framework, we were able to compare the vaccination
   failure rate in a group of dogs entering the Italian border from EU and
   non-EU countries to those vaccinated in Italy prior to international
   travel. Our analysis identified that cross-breeds and two breed
   categories showed high vaccine success rates, while Beagles and Boxers
   were the least likely to show a successful response to vaccination
   (88.82\% and 90.32\%, respectively). Our analysis revealed diverse
   performances among the commercially available vaccines, in terms of
   serological peak windows, and marked differences according to
   geographical area. Of note, we found a higher vaccine failure rate in
   imported dogs (13.15\%) than in those vaccinated in Italy (5.89\%). Our
   findings suggest that the choice of vaccine may influence the likelihood
   of an animal achieving a protective serological level and that time from
   vaccination to sampling should be considered when interpreting
   serological results. A higher vaccine failure in imported compared to
   Italian dogs highlights the key role that border controls still have in
   assessing the full compliance of pet movements with EU legislation to
   minimize the risk of rabies being reintroduced into a disease-free area.}},

Abstract = {{Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR) occurs worldwide, requiring
   significant resources for eradication programs or surveillance purposes.
   The status of infection is usually detected by serological methods using
   the virus neutralization test (VNT) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   (ELISA) on individual sera. The gE DIVA (Differentiating Infected from
   Vaccinated Animals) vaccines approach, adopted in order to reduce the
   virus circulation and prevent clinical signs, have tightened the range
   of available methods for the serological diagnosis. Different gE
   blocking ELISA could be performed to detect specific antibodies in sera
   of infected or whole virus-vaccinated animals but with less sensitivity
   if applied to bulk milk samples, especially in marker-vaccinated herds.
   A new rec-gE ELISA was recently developed in Italy and applied with good
   performances on blood serum samples. The present paper focuses on the
   application of a rapid protocol for purification/concentration of
   immunoglobulin G (IgG) from bulk milk and on the use of the new rec-gE
   indirect ELISA. The study involved three different partners and 225
   herds (12,800 lactating cows) with different official IBR diagnostic
   statuses. The diagnostic specificity of the method was demonstrated
   closed to 100\% while the diagnostic sensitivity was strictly related to
   the herd-seroprevalence. Considering 2.5\% as the limit of detection of
   within-herd seropositivity prevalence, the diagnostic sensitivity showed
   by the proposed method was equal to 100\%. A single reactivation of a
   whole strain vaccine in an old cow was detected inside a group of 67
   lactating cows, showing the field applicability of the method. (C) 2017

Title = {{The effect of interspecific competition on the temporal dynamics of
   Aedes albopictus and Culex pipiens}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{FEB 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Aedes albopictus and Culex pipiens larvae reared in the same
   breeding site compete for resources, with an asymmetrical outcome that
   disadvantages only the latter species. The impact of these interactions
   on the overall ecology of these two species has not yet been assessed in
   the natural environment. In the present study, the temporal patterns of
   adult female mosquitoes from both species were analysed in north-
   eastern Italy, and substantial temporal shifts between abundance curves
   of Cx. pipiens and Ae. albopictus were observed in several sites. To
   understand which factors can drive the observed temporal shifts, we
   developed a mechanistic model that takes explicitly into account the
   effect of temperature on the development and survival of all mosquito
   stages. We also included into the model the effect of asymmetric
   interspecific competition, by adding a mortality term for Cx. pipiens
   larvae proportional to the larval abundance of Ae. albopictus within the
   same breeding site. Model calibration was performed through a Markov
   Chain Monte Carlo approach using weekly capture data collected in our
   study sites during 2014 and 2015.
   Results: In almost half of observation sites, temporal shifts were due
   to competition, with an early decline of Cx. pipiens caused by the
   concurrent rise in abundance of its competitor, and this effect was
   enhanced by higher abundance of both species. We estimate that
   competition may reduce Cx. pipiens abundance in some sites by up to
   about 70\%. However, in some cases temporal shifts can also be explained
   in the absence of competition between species resulting from a
   ``temporal niche{''} effect, when the optimal fitness to environmental
   conditions for the two species are reached at different times of the
   year.
   Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the importance of considering
   ecological interactions and, in particular, competition between mosquito
   species in temperate climates, with important implications for risk
   assessment of mosquito transmitted pathogens, as well as the
   implementation of effective control measures.}},

Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{Background: The mosquito-borne filarial nematodes Dirofilaria immitis
   and Dirofilaria repens primarily affect dogs but also cats, causing
   heartworm disease or subcutaneous dirofilariosis, respectively, and both
   may also cause zoonotic diseases in humans. Several mosquito species
   have been reported as competent vectors for these nematodes, but no data
   are available for the invasive mosquito species Aedes japonicus
   (Theobald, 1901). The objective of this study was to describe the
   development of both D. immitis and D. repens under standardised
   experimental laboratory conditions in mosquitoes.
   Methods: For this purpose, both a laboratory strain and field-collected
   individuals of the invasive mosquito species Ae. japonicus and, for
   comparative purposes, a laboratory strain of Aedes geniculatus, a rare
   indigenous species sharing habitats with Ae. japonicus, and of the
   tropical species Aedes aegypti were used. Anticoagulated
   microfilariaemic blood was fed at a density of 3000 mf/ml to mosquitoes
   with a hemotek system. Blood-fed mosquitoes were incubated at 27
   C-degrees and 85\% relative humidity, and specimens were dissected under
   the microscope at pre-set time points to observe developmental stages of
   both Dirofilaria species. Additionally, real-time PCRs were carried out
   in some microscopically negative samples to determine the infection
   rates.
   Results: In field-collected Ae. japonicus infectious L3 larvae of both
   D. immitis and D. repens developed, rendering this mosquito species an
   efficient vector for both filarial species. Additionally, Ae.
   geniculatus was shown to be an equally efficient vector for both
   filarial species. Aedes japonicus mosquitoes from a laboratory colony
   were refractory to D. immitis but susceptible to D. repens, whereas Ae.
   aegypti was refractory to both filarial species.
   Conclusions: To our knowledge, Aedes japonicus was for the first time
   shown to be an efficient vector for both D. immitis and D. repens,
   indicating that this invasive and locally highly abundant species may
   contribute to a transmission of filarial worms. The data emphasize the
   necessity to perform vector competence studies with local mosquito
   populations as basis for risk assessments. We further demonstrated that
   detection of filarial DNA in a mosquito species alone does not allow to
   draw reliable conclusions with regard to its vector competence.}},

Title = {{Laboratory colonization of the European invasive mosquito Aedes
   (Finlaya) koreicus}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Aedes (Finlaya) koreicus (Edwards) is a mosquito that has
   recently entered Europe from Asia. This species is considered a
   potential threat to newly colonized territories, but little is known
   about its capacity to transmit pathogens or ability to compete with
   native mosquito species. The establishment of a laboratory colony is a
   necessary first step for further laboratory studies on the biology,
   ecology and vector competence of Ae. koreicus.
   Results: A self-mating colony was established at QIMR Berghofer Medical
   Research Institute (Brisbane, Australia) from eggs of the F1 progeny of
   individuals collected as free-living larvae in northeastern Italy
   (Belluno province). Mosquitoes are currently maintained on both
   defibrinated sheep blood provided via an artificial membrane system and
   human blood from volunteers. Larvae are maintained in rain water and fed
   with Tetramin (R) fish food ((c) 2015 Spectrum Brands - Pet, Home and
   Garden Division, Tetra-Fish). Morphometric measurements related to body
   size were taken and a fecundity index, based on wing length, was
   calculated. An in vivo technique for differentiating male and female
   pupae has been optimized. Our findings provide the basis for further
   studies on the ecology and physiology of Ae. koreicus.
   Conclusion: We describe the establishment of an Ae. koreicus colony in
   the laboratory and identify critical requirements for the maintenance of
   this mosquito species under artificial conditions. The laboratory colony
   will facilitate studies investigating the vector potential of this
   species for human pathogens.}},

Title = {{Prevalence and characterization of Salmonella among humans in Ghana}},
Journal = {{TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{45}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) is a public health problem
   worldwide and particularly in Africa with high disease burden. This
   study characterized Salmonella isolates from humans in Ghana to
   determine serovar distribution, phage types, and antimicrobial
   resistance. Further, the clonal relatedness among isolates was
   determined.
   Methods: One hundred and thirty-seven Salmonella isolates (111 clinical
   and 26 public toilet) were characterized using standard serotyping,
   phage typing, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods. The
   molecular epidemiology of common serovars (Salmonella Typhimurium and
   Salmonella Enteritidis) was established by pulsed field gel
   electrophoresis (PFGE).
   Results: Twenty-two serovars were identified with S. Enteritidis, S.
   Typhimurium, and Salmonella Derby as the most dominant. One hundred and
   twelve isolates showed resistance to more than one antimicrobial.
   Fifty-eight (n = 58/112; 54.5\%) strains were multi-resistant with low
   resistance to cephalosporins ceftazidime (8.0\%), cefotaxime (4.5\%),
   and cefoxitin (2.7\%) with synergy to clavulanic acid indicating
   possible ESBLs. Isolates showed high resistance to trimethoprim
   (66.1\%), tetracycline (61.6\%), ampicillin (57.1\%), sulfamethoxazole
   (46.4\%), chloramphenicol (33.9\%), and ciprofloxacin (25.0\%). The most
   common resistance pattern of multi-resistant serovars was to ampicillin,
   chloramphenicol, sulphonamide, and trimethoprim. S. Enteritidis (18/43)
   strains reacted with typing phages but did not conform to any phage type
   with PT14B and PT4 as predominant definitive phage types. Six S.
   Typhimurium strains reacted but did not conform to any recognized phage
   type while seven were non-typable. The predominant definitive phage
   types were DT1 and DT22. PFGE patterns of human S. Enteritidis were
   closely related to patterns of poultry isolates obtained in a previous
   study in Ghana.
   Conclusions: Cephalosporin resistance is uncommon among Salmonella from
   humans in Ghana. Poultry may be an important source of human
   salmonellosis. There is an urgent need for the implementation of routine
   surveillance of antimicrobial use and bacterial resistance among humans
   in Ghana.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The high incidence of foodborne disease among children
   suggests the value of health promotion. Children are a high-risk group
   so far as foodborne disease is concerned, although they may be hard to
   reach with training programmes. This research investigated the use of
   drawings, compared with questionnaires, to evaluate the impact of a
   health promotion programme to improve knowledge and habits in the
   context of food handling and personal hygiene.
   Setting: Children (184) attending primary school and living in the north
   of Italy were enrolled in the programme.
   Methods: Qualitative and quantitative tools: pre- and post-intervention
   questionnaires were administered, and children were asked to produce
   pre- and post-intervention drawings about microorganisms and their
   effects on humans. An observation grid was built to code key features in
   the drawings.
   Results: Results clearly showed that some drawing features correlated
   with and predicted high scores in the questionnaire on knowledge of
   microorganisms. These were the use of captions, the representation of a
   natural context and the presence of a causal link between depicted
   elements.
   Conclusion: Study findings highlight the potential of the use of drawing
   as an effective evaluation tool. The use of drawing can support the
   design of strategies for the validation of health campaigns aimed at the
   amelioration of children's food contamination-related (and perhaps
   other) risks.}},

Abstract = {{Seven hundred seventy-eight samples of packaged smoked fish (774 smoked
   salmon and 4 smoked swordfish) on sale in Italy, from 50 different
   manufacturers located in 12 European Union countries, were purchased
   from the Italian market between May and December 2011. The surface
   temperatures of the samples on sale ranged from 0 to 130 degrees C (3.4
   +/- 1.5 degrees C, mean +/- SD). Six hundred eighty (87.4\%) of 778
   samples were stored at <= 4 degrees C. One hundred fifty-seven samples
   (20.2\%, 95\% confidence interval 17.5 to 23.1\%) were contaminated by
   Listeria monocytogenes, with 26 samples (3.3\%, 95\% confidence interval
   2.3 to 4.8\%) at levels >100 CFU/g. The maximum level of contamination
   was 1.3 X 10(6) CFU/g. The differences in the level of contamination of
   smoked fish between countries (chi(2) = 91.54, P < 0.05) and
   manufacturers (chi(2) = 193.22, P < 0.05) were significant. The
   frequency of detection for products from different manufacturing
   premises ranged from 0 to 76.9\%. Serotyping by serological
   agglutination revealed that the main serotypes detected were 1/2a
   (65.3\%) and 1/2b (22.4\%). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing with
   restriction enzymes AscI and ApaI yielded 36 pulsotypes from 144
   isolates, clustering into 17 groups. Eight main pulsotypes accounted for
   70.8\% of the isolates. Three of the main pulsotypes were exclusively
   from products of a single manufacturer. In general, products from the
   same manufacturer showed genetic homogeneity, with one strongly
   prevalent pulsotype. Different manufacturers usually showed very
   different levels of contamination of the final product, confirming the
   importance of the management of process hygiene for controlling L.
   monocytogenes contamination.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUNDThe increase in seafood consumption and the presence of
   different species of bivalves on the global markets has given rise to
   several commercial frauds based on species substitution. To prevent and
   detect wilful or unintentional frauds, reliable and rapid techniques are
   required to identify seafood species in different products. In the
   present work, a pyrosequencing-based technology has been used for the
   molecular identification of bivalve species.
   RESULTSProcessed and unprocessed samples of 15 species belonging to the
   bivalve families Pectinidae, Mytilidae, Donacidae, Ostreidae, Pharide
   and Veneridae were analysed and correctly identified by the developed
   pyrosequencing-based method according to the homology between query
   sequences of the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) and cytochrome c oxidase I
   (COI) genes and their correspondent reference libraries. This technique
   exhibits great potential in automated and high-throughput processing
   systems, allowing the simultaneous analysis of 96 samples in shorter
   execution and turnaround times.
   CONCLUSIONSThe correct identification of all the species shows how
   useful this technique may prove to differentiate species from different
   products, providing an alternative, simple, rapid and economical tool to
   detect seafood substitution frauds. (c) 2016 Society of Chemical

Abstract = {{Since November 2016, Europe witnesses another wave of incursion of
   highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5) viruses of the Asian
   origin goose/Guangdong (gs/GD) lineage. Infections with H5 viruses of
   clade 2.3.4.4b affect wild bird and poultry populations. H5 viruses of
   clades 2.2, 2.3.1.2c and 2.3.4.4a were detected previously in Europe in
   2006, 2010 and 2014. Clades 2.2.1.2 and 2.3.2.1.c are endemic in Egypt
   and Western Africa, respectively and have caused human fatalities.
   Evidence exists of their co-circulation in the Middle East. Subtype H5
   viruses of low pathogenicity (LPAI) are endemic in migratory wild bird
   populations. They potentially mutate into highly pathogenic phenotypes
   following transmission into poultry holdings. However, to date only the
   gs/GD H5 lineage had an impact on human health. Rapid and specific
   diagnosis marks the cornerstone for control and eradication of HPAI
   virus incursions. We present the development and validation of five
   real-time RT-PCR assays (RT-qPCR) that allow sequencing-independent
   pathotype and clade-specific distinction of major gs/GD HPAI H5 virus
   clades and of Eurasian LPAI viruses currently circulating. Together with
   an influenza A virus-generic RT-qPCR, the assays significantly speed up
   time-to-diagnosis and reduce reaction times in a OneHealth approach of
   curbing the spread of gs/GD HPAI viruses.}},

Abstract = {{In spring there is often a rise in honey bee mortality incidents. The
   aim of this study was to investigate the potential correlation, in the
   reported incidents, between exposure to pesticide treatments and virus
   infections. Here we summarize the situation in northeastern Italy during
   spring 2014, evaluated by monitoring 150 active ingredients and three
   honey bee viruses in dead honey bees and other matrices. At least one
   active ingredient was found in 72.2\% of the 79 dead honey bee samples,
   with the most abundant (59.4\%) being insecticides, mainly belonging to
   the class of neonicotinoids (41.8\%), followed by fungicides (40.6\%).
   Imidacloprid, chlorpyrifos, tau-fluvalinate, and cyprodinil were the
   most frequently detected active ingredients. Multiple virus infections
   were monitored, revealing a high prevalence of chronic bee paralysis
   virus (CBPV) and deformed wing virus (DWV), detected in all samples
   except one. 71 and 37\% of the CBPV- and DWV positive samples,
   respectively, showed a high number of viral copies per bee (> 10(7)).
   This work emphasizes possible relationship between spring mortality in

   synergistically exacerbate the negative impact of pesticides on honey
   bee health, endangering the survival of colonies.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUNDIn Europe, Aedes albopictus is an invasive mosquito species
   known to be a major nuisance as well as a vector of a range of
   arboviruses. A number of studies have indicated that community
   participation programmes are an effective pest control tool to reduce
   mosquito populations. However, few studies have evaluated the
   effectiveness of a community-based approach in Europe. In this study, we
   examined two Ae. albopictus control strategies that implemented a
   community-based approach in northern Italy: one was a partial
   intervention that included a public education campaign and the
   larviciding of public spaces, and the other was a full intervention that
   additionally included a door-to-door campaign. This latter consisted of
   going door to door actively to educate residents about control measures
   and deliver larvicide tablets for treating catch basins at home. A site
   where no intervention measures were carried out was used as a control.
   RESULTSIn the site where a full intervention was carried out, Ae.
   albopictus egg density was 1.6 times less than at the site that received
   partial intervention, and 1.9 times less than at the non-intervention
   site. No significant reduction in egg density was achieved in the
   partial intervention site.
   CONCLUSIONSIn our study, Ae. albopictus populations were most
   effectively reduced by larviciding both public and private catch basins.
   Door-to-door education was effective in convincing residents to apply
   control measures on their property; however, this method was labour
   intensive and costly. It may be possible to reduce personnel costs by
   involving volunteers or using a hot spot' approach. (c) 2016 Society of

Abstract = {{Botulinum neurotoxins are diverse proteins. They are currently
   represented by at least seven serotypes and more than 40 subtypes. New
   clostridial strains that produce novel neurotoxin variants are being
   identified with increasing frequency, which presents challenges when
   organizing the nomenclature surrounding these neurotoxins. Worldwide,
   researchers are faced with the possibility that toxins having identical
   sequences may be given different designations or novel toxins having
   unique sequences may be given the same designations on publication. In
   order to minimize these problems, an ad hoc committee consisting of over
   20 researchers in the field of botulinum neurotoxin research was
   convened to discuss the clarification of the issues involved in
   botulinum neurotoxin nomenclature. This publication presents a
   historical overview of the issues and provides guidelines for botulinum
   neurotoxin subtype nomenclature in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Geospatial database of farm locations and biosecurity measures are
   essential to control disease outbreaks. A study was conducted to
   establish geospatial database on poultry farms in Al-Jabal Al-Gharbi
   region of Libya, to evaluate the biosecurity level of each farm and to
   determine the seroprevalence of mycoplasma and its relation to
   biosecurity level. A field team of 7 Veterinarians belongs to the
   National Center of Animal Health was assigned for data recording and
   collection of blood samples. Personal information of the producers,
   geographical locations, biosecurity measures and description of the
   poultry farms were recorded. The total number of poultry farms in
   Al-Jabal Al-Gharbi Region is 461 farms distributed in 13 cities. Out of
   these, 102 broiler farms and one broiler breeder farm (10 houses) which
   were in operation during team visit were included in this study.
   Following collection of blood, sera were separated and tested by
   Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the presence of antibodies
   against Mycoplasma (General antigen for M. gallisepticum and M.
   synoviae). The seroprevalence of Mycoplasma in the region was 28\% (29
   poultry farms out of 103 were infected). About 50\% (23 out of 47) of
   poultry farms located in Garian city were infected with Mycoplasma and
   one significant cluster of Mycoplasma infection in the city was
   identified. Low level of biosecurity was found in poultry farms of the
   region. Out of the 103 farms included, 63\% of poultry houses has a
   ground of soil and 44\% of them has uncoated walls which may influence
   the proper cleaning and disinfection. Almost 100\% of the farms are at
   risk of exposure to diseases transmitted by wild birds such as avian
   influenza and Newcastle disease due to absence of wild birds control
   program. Although, 81\% of the farms have entry restrictions, only 20\%
   have disinfectants at entry which increase the risk of exposure to
   pathogens. The results of this study highlight the weakness points of
   biosecurity measures in poultry farms of Al-Jabal Al-Gharbi region and
   high seroprevalence of mycoplasma. Data collected in this study will
   assist the Veterinary authorities to apply effective disease control
   strategies.}},

   of the disease and time of death. Interestingly, the presence and degree
   of these seemingly contrasting effects were dose-dependent and not

Abstract = {{Pasteurella multocida is a widespread pathogen associated with major
   animal diseases of economic significance. Despite this, little is known
   about the capsular types, virulence gene pattern, and antimicrobial
   susceptibility of isolates from hosts affected by different diseases,
   and no data are available in Italy. One hundred eighty six isolates of
   P. multocida, were taken from different species in different states of
   health in several Italian regions, and were tested for genes encoding
   for capsular types (cap) and major virulence factors (tbpA, toxA, hgbB
   and pfhA). Antimicrobial susceptibility was investigated with the agar
   diffusion test. The majority of isolates was capA+. However, the
   distribution differed according to species and disease of origin, with a
   greater heterogeneity in isolates from rabbits; capE was never found,
   while capB was detected once. Only capA+ and capF+ strains tested
   positive for pfhA. Conversely, almost all capD+ isolates were hgbB+. In
   bovine respiratory disease, pfhA+/tbpA+/capA+ isolates predominated,
   while tbpA+/toxA+/capD+ isolates predominated in sheep. Overall, low
   levels of resistance were found, with full susceptibility to ceftiofur
   and florfenicol. Lower susceptibility to older antimicrobials was
   recorded, since only approximately 1/3 of the isolates showed
   susceptibility to tylosin and erythromycin, and resistance to
   tetracycline (7.5\%), and trimethoprim - sulphametoxazole (4.8\%) was
   also observed.}},

Abstract = {{Following the discovery of the small hive beetle (Aethina tumida) (SHB)

   SHB non-infested areas. Freezing is appropriate as a sanitary measure
   for hive products such as pollen, but honey has a low thermal
   conductivity, so long periods of time are necessary to freeze whole
   supers. Supers containing two different honey crops (chestnut and
   eucalyptus) were placed in a freezing facility to determine the optimum
   times for SHB control. We found that supers full of honey should be
   stored in a -20 degrees C freezer for at least 71 (chestnut honey) and
   83 (eucalyptus honey) hours respectively, to fulfil OIE recommendations
   for sanitization, but considering eucalyptus honey the worst scenario,
   we would recommend an 83-h-treatment generally.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses
   (HPAI-H5N1) has resulted in the appearance of a number of diverse groups
   of HPAI-H5N1 based on the presence of genetically similar clusters of
   their haemagglutinin sequences (clades). An H5 antigen encoded by a
   recombinant baculovirus and expressed in insect cells was used for
   oil-emulsion-based vaccine prototypes. In several experiments,
   vaccination was performed at 10 days of age, followed by challenge
   infection on day 21 post vaccination (PV) with HPAI-H5N1 clades 2.2,
   2.2.1, and 2.3.2. A further challenge infection with HPAI-H5N1 clade
   2.2.1 was performed at day 42 PV. High haemagglutination inhibition
   titres were observed for the recH5 vaccine antigen, and lower
   haemagglutination inhibition titres for the challenge virus antigens.
   Nevertheless, the rate of protection from mortality and clinical signs
   was 100\% when challenged at 21 days PV and 42 days PV, indicating
   protection over the entire broiler chicken rearing period without a
   second vaccination. The unvaccinated control chickens mostly died
   between two and five days after challenge infection. A low level of
   viral RNA was detected by reverse transcription followed by a
   quantitative polymerase chain reaction in a limited number of birds for
   a short period after challenge infection, indicating a limited spread of
   HPAI-H5N1 at flock level. Furthermore, it was observed that the vaccine
   can be used in a differentiation infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA)
   approach, based on the detection of nucleoprotein antibodies in
   vaccinated/challenged chickens. The vaccine fulfilled all expectations
   of an inactivated vaccine after one vaccination against challenge with
   different clades of H5N1-HPAI and is suitable for a DIVA approach.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we investigated the circulation of methicillin-resistant
   Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in 2 dairy cattle farms (farm A and B),
   previously identified as MRSA-positive in bulk tank milk samples, and
   epidemiologically related to swine farms. Collected specimens included
   quarter milk samples and nasal swabs from dairy cows, pig nasal swabs
   collected at both the farm and slaughterhouse level, environmental dust
   samples, and human nasal swabs from the farms' owners and workers. The
   prevalence of MRSA was estimated at the herd level by testing quarter
   milk samples. The prevalence of MRSA was 4.8\% (3/63; 95\% confidence
   interval = 0-10.2\%) and 60\% (33/55; 95\% confidence interval =
   47.05-72.95) in farm A and B, respectively. In farm A, MRSA was also
   isolated from humans, pigs sampled at both farm and slaughterhouse
   level, and from environmental samples collected at the pig facilities.
   The dairy cattle facilities of farm A tested negative for MRSA. In farm
   B, MRSA was isolated from environmental dust samples in both the cattle
   and pig facilities, whereas nasal swabs collected from cows and from
   humans tested negative. Sixty-three selected MRSA isolates obtained from
   different sources in farm A and B were genetically characterized by
   multilocus sequence typing, spa-typing, ribosomal spacer-PCR, and also
   tested for the presence of specific virulence genes and for their
   phenotypical antimicrobial susceptibility by broth microdilution method.
   Different clonal complex (CC) and spa-types were identified, including
   CC398, CC97, and CC1, CC already reported in livestock animals in Italy.
   The MRSA isolates from quarter milk of farm A and B mostly belonged to
   CC97 and CC398, respectively. Both lineages were also identified in
   humans in farm A. The CC97 and CC398 quarter milk isolates were also
   identified as genotype GTBE and GTAF by ribosomal spacer-PCR
   respectively, belonging to distinct clusters with specific virulence and
   resistance patterns. The GTBE and GTAF clusters also included swine,
   environmental, and human isolates from both farms. A high heterogeneity
   in the genetic and phenotypic profiles was observed in environmental
   isolates, in particular from farm B. These results demonstrate the
   possibility of a dynamic sharing and exchange of MRSA lineages or
   genotypes between different species and farm compartments in
   mixed-species farms. The risk of transmission between swine and related
   dairy cattle herds should be considered. Our findings also confirm the
   zoonotic potential of livestock-associated MRSA and underline the
   importance of applying biosecurity measures and good hygiene practices
   to prevent MRSA spread at the farm level and throughout the food
   production chain.}},

   +/- 5 days prepartum (T0), 10 +/- 2 days postpartum (T1), 30 +/- 2 days
   postpartum (T2) and 50 +/- 2 days postpartum (T3). Two-way
   repeated-measure ANOVA was applied to assess statistical significance of
   sampling time and between groups for all variables. Pearson's
   correlation coefficient was used to investigate the relationship between
   all variables. Results showed BCS loss from T0 to T3 in SG and a
   significant increase of NEFA and BHB at T1. The GdL began to be mild at
   T0 increasing and becoming moderate to severe at T1, fairly regressing,
   but not disappearing, at T2 and T3, in both groups. This study showed
   that high lipomobilisation with a mild to moderate fat infiltration does
   not imply that ketosis or other periparturient diseases might be
   present. Our results suggest that hepatic lipidosis is associated with
   long-term histological and metabolic changes in dairy cows.}},

Abstract = {{Iridoviridae are known to cause disease in sturgeons in North America.
   Here, histological and molecular methods were used to screen for this
   family of virus in sturgeons from various European farms with
   low-to-high morbidity. Some histological samples revealed basophilic
   cells in the gill and labial epithelia, strongly suggesting the
   accumulation of iridovirus particles. Newly developed generic PCR tests
   targeting the major capsid protein (MCP) gene of sturgeon iridoviruses
   identified in North America, namely the white sturgeon iridovirus and
   the Namao virus (NV), produced positive signals in most samples from
   four sturgeon species: Russian (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii), Siberian (A.
   baerii), Adriatic (A. naccarii) and beluga (Huso huso). The sequences of
   the PCR products were generally highly similar one another, with
   nucleotide identities greater than 98\%. They were also related to
   (74-88\%), although distinct from, American sturgeon iridoviruses. These
   European viruses were thus considered variants of a single new virus,
   provisionally named Acipenser iridovirus-European (AcIV-E). Moreover,
   three samples infected with AcIV-E showed genetic heterogeneity, with
   the co-existence of two sequences differing by five nucleotides. One of
   our European samples carried a virus distinct from AcIV-E, but closely
   related to NV identified in Canada (95\%). This study demonstrates the
   presence of two distinct sturgeon iridoviruses in Europe: a new genotype
   AcIV-E and an NV-related virus.}},

Title = {{Dystrophic mineralization of the arterial fibrovascular tissue
   associated with a vitamin D hypervitaminosis in an 8-year-old female
   Alpaca (Vicugna pacos)}},
Journal = {{IRISH VETERINARY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{69}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Prophylactic Vitamin D supplementation is a common practice
   in Alpaca breeding in many regions around the world. An overdosage can
   lead to dystrophic mineralization of soft tissues. In this paper we
   illustrate a suspected case of hypervitaminosis D in an 8-year-old
   female Alpaca.
   Case presentation: In June 2015, the carcass of an 8-year-old female
   Alpaca (Vicugna pacos) was submitted to the diagnostic laboratory of the
   Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie (IZSVe) for
   necropsy. The animal had undergone a spontaneous abortion with uterine
   prolapse and delivery of the placenta, and had died shortly thereafter.
   Death occurred due to internal haemorrhage related to dystrophic
   mineralization of the left renal artery with subsequent rupture and
   damage of the renal hilum. During the necropsy, histopathological and
   serum biochemical analyses were performed. After laboratory analyses and
   the history of mineral and vitamin supplementation reported by the
   breeder, a hypervitaminosis D was suspected to be the most probable
   cause of the dystrophic mineralization observed in the left renal
   artery.
   Conclusions: Most of the information regarding Llamas and Alpacas comes
   from the South American and Australian regions. It is therefore
   important to provide scientific information about these animals in other
   regions of the world in order to have a better and wider understanding
   of the nutritional and environmental conditions necessary for optimal
   breeding.}},

Journal = {{Epidemics}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Pages = {{27-34}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses
   emerge through mutation of precursor low pathogenic avian influenza
   (LPAI) viruses in domestic poultry populations. The potential for
   immunological cross-protection between these pathogenic variants is
   recognised but the epidemiological impact during co-circulation is not
   well understood. Here we use mathematical models to investigate whether
   altered flock infection parameters consequent to primary LPAI infections
   can impact on the spread of HPAI at the population level. First we used
   mechanistic models reflecting the co-circulatory dynamics of LPAI and
   HPAI within a single commercial poultry flock. We found that primary
   infections with LPAI led to HPAI prevalence being maximised under a
   scenario of high but partial cross-protection. We then tested the
   population impact in spatially-explicit simulations motivated by a major
   avian influenza A(H7N1) epidemic that afflicted the Italian poultry
   industry in 1999-2001. We found that partial cross-protection can lead
   to a prolongation of HPAI epidemic duration. Our findings have
   implications for the control of HPAI in poultry particularly for
   settings in which LPAI and HPAI frequently co-circulate. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{Pain alleviation associated with castration of piglets is an important
   welfare issue. The present study compares the effect of different
   approaches and products suitable for farmer use, with the aim to
   alleviate pain due to castration in piglets. A randomized within-litter
   design, with 28 replicate litters, compared 7 treatments: handling (H)
   restraint of the piglet and manipulation of the scrotum, castration
   without pain relief (C), 2 treatments (T2, T6) with different
   concentrations of tetracaine (2 and 6\%) applied topically 10 min before
   and immediately post-surgery, and 3 treatments with i. m. injection of
   different nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) 10 min prior to
   surgery (M-meloxicam, K-ketoprofen, TA-tolfenamic acid). Efficacy of
   pain relief was assessed during a 300 min period after castration by
   serum cortisol, behavior (walking, lying, suckling, in the nest,
   isolated and pain related: tremors, rubbing the rear, hunching, wagging
   of the tail), facial expression and scrotal skin pressure sensitivity. C
   pigs had greater serum cortisol concentration than all other groups at
   60 min post-surgery (P < 0.001), while H pigs had lower concentrations
   than pigs given topical anesthesia (P < 0.001) though not injected
   analgesia. No treatment differences were significant at 180 min, but at
   300 min cortisol concentration was greater in T2 and T6 piglets than
   those given NSAIDs (P = 0.03). These treatment differences were mirrored
   by the pressure sensitivity of the scrotum; in comparison with C
   piglets, those given NSAIDs showed a reduced sensitivity (P = 0.003) but
   those given local anesthesia did not (P = 0.15). C pigs showed increased
   frequency of pain-related behavior in the first 30 min in comparison
   with all other treatments, more time isolated than H or NSAID
   treatments, and more time standing inactive than H or K treatments. No
   behavioral differences were apparent after 60 min. No differences in
   facial expressions were observed among treatments. In conclusion,
   on-farm methods for pain relief can provide some, though not complete,
   pain alleviation in the hours after castration. The use of topical
   anesthesia gave only minor benefit in comparison to NSAID agents
   injected prior to castration. Since the main differences in indicators
   of pain between positive and negative controls were observed within the
   first h after castration, it is important to select drugs that act
   quickly after administration to facilitate practical processing
   schedules on farm.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE
   To create an atlas of the normal CT anatomy of the head of blue-and-gold
   macaws (Ara ararauna), African grey parrots (Psittacus erithacus), and
   monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus).
   ANIMALS
   3 blue-and-gold macaws, 5 African grey parrots, and 6 monk parakeets and
   cadavers of 4 adult blue-and-gold macaws, 4 adult African grey parrots,
   and 7 monk parakeets.
   PROCEDURES
   Contrast-enhanced CT imaging of the head of the live birds was performed
   with a 4-multidetector-row CT scanner. Cadaveric specimens were stored
   at -20 degrees C until completely frozen, and each head was then sliced
   at 5-mm intervals to create reference cross sections. Frozen cross
   sections were cleaned with water and photographed on both sides.
   Anatomic structures within each head were identified with the aid of the
   available literature, labeled first on anatomic photographs, and then
   matched to and labeled on corresponding CT images. The best CT
   reconstruction filter, window width, and window level for obtaining
   diagnostic images of each structure were also identified.
   RESULTS
   Most of the clinically relevant structures of the head were identified
   in both the cross-sectional photographs and corresponding CT images.
   Optimal visibility of the bony structures was achieved via CT with a
   standard soft tissue filter and pulmonary window. The use of contrast
   medium allowed a thorough evaluation of the soft tissues.
   CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE
   The labeled CT images and photographs of anatomic structures of the
   heads of common pet parrot species created in this study may be useful
   as an atlas to aid interpretation of images obtained with any imaging
   modality.}},

Abstract = {{The most effective and sustainable method to control and eliminate
   rabies in wildlife is the oral rabies vaccination (ORV) of target
   species, namely foxes and raccoon dogs in Europe. According to WHO and
   OIE, the effectiveness of oral vaccination campaigns should be regularly
   assessed via disease surveillance and ORV antibody monitoring. Rabies
   antibodies are generally screened for in field animal cadavers, whose
   body fluids are often of poor quality. Therefore, the use of alternative
   methods such as the enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been
   proposed to improve reliability of serological results obtained on
   wildlife samples. We undertook an international collaborative study to
   determine if the commercial BioPro ELISA Rabies Ab kit is a reliable and
   reproducible tool for rabies serological testing. Our results reveal
   that the overall specificity evaluated on naive samples reached 96.7\%,
   and the coefficients of concordance obtained for fox and raccoon dog
   samples were 97.2\% and 97.5\%, respectively. The overall agreement
   values obtained for the four marketed oral vaccines used in Europe were
   all equal to or greater than 95\%. The coefficients of concordance
   obtained by laboratories ranged from 87.2\% to 100\%. The results of

Abstract = {{Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infection continues to cause
   economically important diseases in poultry while different geno-and
   serotypes continue to circulate globally. Two infectious bronchitis
   viruses (IBV) were isolated from chickens with respiratory disease in
   Sudan. Sequence analysis of the hypervariable regions of the S1 gene
   revealed a close relation to the QX-like genotype which has not been
   detected in Sudan before. Whole genome analysis of
   IBV/Ck/Sudan/AR251-15/2014 isolate by next generation sequencing
   revealed a genome size of 27,646 nucleotides harbouring 13 open reading
   frames: 5'-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3'. Highest nucleotide
   sequence identity of 93\% for the whole genome was found with the
   Chinese IBV strain Ck/CH/LHLJ/140906, the Italian IBV isolate
   ITA/90254/2005 and the 4/91 vaccine strain. Phylogenetic analysis of the
   S1 gene revealed that the IBV/Ck/Sudan/AR251-15/2014 isolate clustered
   togetherwith viruses of the GI-19 lineage. Recombination analysis gave
   evidence for distinct patterns of origin of RNA in the Sudanese isolate
   in multiple genes. Several sites of recombination were scattered
   throughout the genome suggesting that the Sudan-QX like strain emerged
   as a unique recombinant from multiple recombination events of parental
   viruses from 4/91, H120 and ITA/90254/2005 genotypes. The Sudanese
   QX-like isolate is plausibly genetically different from IBV strains

Abstract = {{In August 2012 repeated respiratory outbreaks caused by swine influenza
   A virus (swIAV) were registered for a whole year in a breeding farm in
   northeast Italy that supplied piglets for fattening. The virus,
   initially characterized in the farm, was a reassortant Eurasian
   avian-like H1N1 (H1(av)N1) genotype, containing a haemagglutinin segment
   derived from the pandemic H1N1 (A(H1N1)pdm09) lineage. To control
   infection, a vaccination program using vaccines against the
   A(H1N1)pdm09, human-like H1N2 (H1(hu)N2), human-like H3N2 (H3N2), and
   H1(av)N1 viruses was implemented in sows in November 2013. Vaccine
   efficacy was assessed by sampling nasal swabs for two months in 35-75
   day-old piglets born from vaccinated sows. Complete genome sequencing of
   eight swIAV-positive nasal swabs collected longitudinally from piglets
   after the implementation of the vaccination program was conducted to
   investigate the virus characteristics.
   Over the two-month period, two different genotypes involving multiple
   reassortment events were detected. The unexpected circulation of
   multiple reassortant genotypes in such a short time highlights the
   complexity of the genetic diversity of swIAV and the need for a better
   surveillance plan, based on the combination of clinical signs,
   epidemiological data and whole genome characterization. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The illegal use of pharmacologically active compounds for growth
   promotion in food-producing species poses risks for consumer health and
   animal welfare. Surveillance relies on the quantification of drug
   residues in animal fluids or tissues, but the efficacy can be negatively

   matrices. Consequently, techniques focusing on the indirect biological
   effects of exogenous compound administration have been proposed as more
   sensitive detection methods. The purpose of the present study is to
   develop a tandem mass spectrometry analytical method based on low-energy
   collision-induced dissociation (CID-MS/MS) using multiple reaction
   monitoring (MRM) for the quantification of 12 potential protein markers
   of skeletal muscle to detect anabolic treatments with dexamethasone.
   Protein markers identified in a previous study applying a 2D-DIGE
   proteomics approach have been quantified using the signature peptide
   method. A group of proteins were confirmed as reliable markers.
   Quantitative results enabled a predictive model to be defined based on

Abstract = {{The objective of the present study is to assess the variability of the
   measures used in the welfare quality (WQ) protocol for pigs among
   slaughterhouses in five different countries and to propose alarm and
   critical thresholds for the calculation of scores for future development
   of an animal welfare certification scheme. The WQ protocol was
   applied,in 52,468 pigs in 42 slaughterhouses in 5 countries (Portugal,
   Italy, Finland, Brazil and Spain). The welfare assessment started in the
   unloading area, where measures of general fear, thermoregulation,
   slipping and falling, lameness, sickness and mortality were taken.
   Concerning lairage, space allowance, drinking points, thermoregulation
   and mortality were considered, and the human-animal relationship was
   assessed by means of high-pitched vocalisations when pigs were moved
   from lairage to the stunning system. Finally, stunning effectiveness,
   skin lesions and presence of pneumonia, pleurisy, pericarditis and white
   spots on the liver were assessed in the stunning area and after
   slaughtering the animals. There was a large degree of variability among
   slaughterhouses for measurements made. For instance, the percentage of
   animals slipping ranged from 0.4\% to 57\%. Pigs with signs of recovery
   after stunning ranged from 0\% to 90\% and the percentage of carcasses
   that were severely damaged with skin lesions ranged from 0\% to 48\%.
   The data obtained can be useful to establish some thresholds for future
   uses of the WQ protocol. Electric stunning was associated with more
   animals recovering consciousness than from CO2.}},

Abstract = {{Poultry are possible sources of non-typhoidal Salmonella serovars which
   may cause foodborne human disease. We conducted a cross-sectional study
   to determine the prevalence of Salmonella serovars in egg-laying hens
   and broilers at the farm level and their susceptibility to
   antimicrobials commonly used in the poultry industry in Ghana. Sampling
   of faeces by a sock method (n = 75), dust (n=75), feed (n = 10) and
   drinking water (n = 10) was performed at 75 commercial egg-laying and
   broiler farms in two regions of Ghana and skin neck (n = 30) at a local
   slaughterhouse from broilers representing different flocks. Salmonella
   was detected in 94/200 (47\%) samples with an overall flock prevalence
   of 44.0\%. Sixteen different serovars were identified with S. Kentucky
   (18.1\%), S. Nima (12.8\%), S. Muenster (10.6\%), S. Enteritidis
   (10.6\%) and S. Virchow (9.6 \%) the most prevalent types. The
   predominant phage type of S. Enteritidis was PT1. All strains were
   susceptible to cefotaxime, ceftazidime and cefoxitin. Fifty-seven
   (60.6\%) strains were resistant to one or more of the remaining nine
   antimicrobials tested by disk diffusion, of which 23 (40.4\%) showed
   multi-resistance (resistance to >= 3 classes of antimicrobials). Of the
   resistant strains (n=57), the most significant were to nalidixic acid
   (89.5\%), tetracycline (80.7\%), ciprofloxacin (64.9\%), sulfamethazole
   (42.1\%), trimethoprim (29.8\%) and ampicillin (26.3\%). All S. Kentucky
   strains were resistant to more than two antimicrobials and shared common
   resistance to nalidixic acid or ciprofloxacin and tetracycline, often in
   combinations with other antimicrobials. PFGE analysis using XbaI of S.
   Kentucky demonstrated one dominant clone in the country. In conclusion,
   poultry produced in Ghana has a high prevalence of multi-resistant
   Salmonella and the common finding of clonal S. Kentucky in the Kumasi
   area warrants further investigations into the epidemiology of this
   serovar. There is an urgent need for surveillance and control programmes
   on Salmonella and use of antimicrobials in the Ghanaian poultry industry
   to protect the health of consumers.}},

Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: Sarcoptic mange is a contagious skin disease caused by the
   mite Sarcoptes scabiei, affecting different mammalian species worldwide
   including the Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica), in which mortalities over
   90 \% of the population have been reported. No efficient diagnostic
   methods are available for this disease, particularly when there are low
   mite numbers and mild or no clinical signs. In this study, three
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) developed for dog (ELISA A),
   Cantabrian chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica parva) (ELISA B) and Alpine
   chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) (ELISA C), were evaluated to detect
   specific antibodies (IgG) to sarcoptic mange in Iberian ibex sera.
   Methods: Serum samples from 131 Iberian ibexes (86 healthy and 45
   scabietic) were collected from 2005 to 2012 in the Sierra Nevada Natural
   and National Parks (southern Spain). Based on visual inspection, ibexes
   were classified into one of three categories, namely healthy (without
   scabietic compatible lesions), mildly affected (skin lesions over less
   than 50 \% of the body surface) and severely affected (skin lesions over
   more than 50 \% of the body surface). The optimal cut-off point,
   specificity, sensitivity and the area under the curve (AUC) were
   calculated, and the agreement between tests was determined. Moreover,
   differences in the optical density (OD) related to scabies severity have
   been evaluated for the best test.
   Results: ELISA C showed better performance than the two other tests,
   reaching higher values of sensitivity (93.0 \%) and specificity (93.5
   \%) against the visual estimation of the percentage of affected skin,
   chosen as the gold standard. Significantly higher concentrations of
   specific antibodies were observed with this test in the mildly and
   severely infested ibexes than in healthy ones.
   Conclusions: Our results revealed that ELISA C was an optimal test to
   diagnose sarcoptic mange in the Iberian ibex. Further studies
   characterizing immune response during the course of the disease,
   including spontaneous or drug induced recovery, should follow in order
   to better understand sarcoptic mange in Iberian ibex populations.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetables are an important source of nutrients, but they can host a
   large microbial population, particularly bacteria. Foodborne pathogens
   can contaminate raw vegetables at any stage of their production process
   with a potential for human infection. Appropriate washing can mitigate
   the risk of foodborne illness consequent to vegetable consumption by
   reducing pathogen levels, but few data are available to assess the
   efficacy of different practices. In the present work, six different
   washing methods, in the presence or absence of sanitisers (peracetic
   acid and percitric acid, sodium bicarbonate, sodium hypochlorite) and
   vinegar, were tested for their effectiveness in reducing Salmonella and
   Listeria counts after artificial contamination of raw rocket (Eruca
   vesicaria). Results showed that washing with sodium hypochlorite (200
   mg/L) was the only method able to produce a significant 2 Log reduction
   of Salmonella counts, but only in the case of high initial contamination
   (7 Log CFU/g), suggesting potential harmful effects for consumers could
   occur. In the case of Listeria rnonocytogenes, all the examined washing
   methods were effective, with 200 mg/L sodium hypochlorite solution and a
   solution of peracetic and percitric acids displaying the best
   performances (2 and 1.5 Log reductions, respectively). This highlights
   the importance of targeting consumers on fit for purpose and safe
   washing practices to circumvent vegetable contamination by foodborne
   pathogens.}},

   Meat-Processing Environments}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT 19}},
Abstract = {{The emergence of microorganisms exerting resistance to biocides is a
   challenge to meat-processing environments. Bacteria can be intrinsically
   resistant to biocides but resistance can also be acquired by adaptation
   to their sub-lethal concentrations. Moreover, the presence of biocide
   resistance determinants, which is closely linked to antibiotic
   resistance determinants, could lead to co-selection during disinfection
   practices along the food chain, and select cross-resistant foodborne
   pathogens. The purpose of this work was to test the resistance of wild
   strains of Listeria monocytogenes, isolated from pork meat processing
   plants, toward benzalkonium chloride (BC), used as proxy of quaternary
   ammonium compounds. Furthermore, the expression of two non-specific
   efflux pumps genes (Ide and mdrL) under biocide exposure was evaluated.
   L. monocytogenes were isolated from five processing plants located in
   the Veneto region (northeast of Italy) before and after cleaning and
   disinfection (C\&D) procedures. A total of 45 strains were collected: 36
   strains before and nine after the C\&D procedures. Collected strains
   were typed according to MLST and ERIC profiles. Strains sampled in the
   same site, isolated before, and after the C\&D procedures and displaying
   the same MLST and ERIC profiles were tested for their sensitivity to
   different concentrations of BC, in a time course assay. The expression
   of non-specific efflux pumps was evaluated at each time point by qPCR
   using tufA gene as housekeeping. A differential expression of the two
   investigated genes was observed: Ide was found to be more expressed by
   the strains isolated before C\&D procedures while its expression was
   dose-dependent in the case of the post C\&D procedures strain. On the
   contrary, the expression of mdrL was inhibited under low biocidal stress
   (10 ppm BC) and enhanced in the presence of high stress (100 ppm BC).
   These findings suggests a possible role for C\&D procedures to select L.
   monocytogenes persisters, pointing out the importance of dealing with
   the identification of risk factors in food plants sanification
   procedures that might select more tolerant strains.}},

   poultry in South Korea in January 2014, rapidly spread worldwide in
   2014-2015. Our analysis of H5N8 viral sequences, epidemiological
   investigations, waterfowl migration, and poultry trade showed that
   long-distance migratory birds can play a major role in the global spread
   of avian influenza viruses. Further, we found that the hemagglutinin of
   clade 2.3.4.4 virus was remarkably promiscuous, creating reassortants
   with multiple neuraminidase subtypes. Improving our understanding of the
   circumpolar circulation of avian influenza viruses in migratory
   waterfowl will help to provide early warning of threats from avian
   influenza to poultry, and potentially human, health.}},

Abstract = {{AimThe aim of this work was to evaluate the efficacy of domestic cooking
   in inactivating Manila clams experimentally infected with human
   hepatitis A virus (HAV).
   Methods and ResultsElectronic temperature probes were positioned to
   measure the internal temperature of Manila clams during domestic
   cooking. Two batches were infected with 10(7) and 10(5) TCID(50)ml(-1)
   of HAV. The infected whole-in-shell clams were divided into three
   replicates and cooked on a conventional stove both singularly and in
   group and removed from the pan at fixed intervals. Pools of three
   digestive glands were examined by virus isolation for three blind
   passages and cell culture supernatant tested with real-time PCR.
   ConclusionResults showed that 2-min cooking by a traditional domestic
   method at a temperature close to 100 degrees C, after the opening up of
   the valves of all the clams, can completely devitalize the HAV in high
   viral load-infected clams.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyThis is the first study on
   inactivation of HAV in experimentally infected Manila clams subjected to
   domestic cooking. At present, labelling all lagoon products as requiring
   cooking before consumption' is highly recommended, but no specifications
   are given on how long and at what temperature they should be cooked.
   Considering the high commercial value of Manila clams, our results can
   provide both the producers and the consumer with useful indications on
   how to cook clams to prevent the risk of HAV foodborne illness.}},

   products and cheese}},
Journal = {{FOOD CONTROL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{68}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In the framework of a European Union (EU) Coordinated Monitoring
   Programme, different types of ready-to eat (RTE) products, including
   soft and semi-soft cheese (n = 398) and cooked meat products (n = 403),
   were collected at retail in Italy and tested for detection and
   enumeration of Listeria monocytogenes. An Integrative Survey of 2696
   samples, including soft and semi-soft cheese (n = 894) and cooked meat
   products (n = 1802) was carried out to have statistically representative
   results at the national level. Considering the results obtained both
   from the EU and the national Integrative Survey, prevalence of
   contamination of meat products was 1.66\% (95\% CL: 1.02-2.73\%) at the
   arrival of the samples at the laboratory and 1.92\% (95\% CL:
   1.31\%-2.82\%) at the end of shelf-life. Spalla cotta was the most
   frequently contaminated meat product. Prevalence of contamination in
   cheese was 2.13\% (95\% CL: 1.37\%-3.3\%) at the arrival at the
   laboratory and 1.01\% (95\% CL: 0.41\%-2.55\%) at the end of shelf-life.
   To get information about differences between cheese rinds and pastes,
   these two parts were separately analysed in the Integrative Survey
   samples. L. monocytogenes was detected in 4.02\% (95\% CL:
   2.60\%-6.19\%) of cheese rinds (n = 473), whereas only the 0.34\% (95\%
   CL: 0.12\%-0.98\%) of cheese pastes (n = 894) were contaminated. This
   difference was statistically significant (chi(2) = 10.026, P < 0.05).
   Gorgonzola and Taleggio were the most frequently contaminated cheeses.
   Non-compliance with EU official criteria (100 CFU/g) was reported in
   0.55\% of meat products at arrival at the laboratory, in 0.46\% at the
   end of shelf-life, and in 1.9\% of cheese rinds. PFGE showed that cheese
   rinds could have been the origin of the few pastes' contamination,
   highlighting genetic similarity between isolates found in these two
   cheese components. Genetic subtyping also showed the presence of
   different pulsotypes, usually belonging to different clusters, in
   isolates from different food types. The presence of some pulsotypes
   predominantly prevalent over the others, in products from the same
   manufacturer, could suggest environmental strains as the main source of
   contamination. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Two strains of Mycoplasma synoviae from chicken flocks on the same layer

Volume = {{193}},

Abstract = {{Mycoplasma synoviae (Ms) is considered to be an economically important
   poultry pathogen. Although the full economic costs of infection in layer
   chickens are still under debate, the prevalence of Ms is known to be
   high in some countries and earlier reports have shown a correlation
   between infection and Eggshell Apex Abnormality (EAA). This work is a
   continuation of an earlier study of a clinical case of EAA on a layer
   hen farm where the presence of two different strains of Ms, based on the
   sequence of the 5' end of the vlhA gene, was demonstrated. Both strains
   could be detected in the trachea but only one (designated strain PASC8)
   appeared able to colonize the oviduct, while the other (designated
   TRACH) was not found in the oviduct and has not been related to EAA. The
   PASC8 partial vlhA gene sequence differs from that of the TRACH in
   having a 39 nucleotide deletion in the proline rich region and three
   point mutations in the RIII region. Based on this information an
   experimental infection was performed in SPF chickens using groups
   infected with either the PASC8 or the TRACH strain and a non-infected
   control group. Both Ms strains were detected in the trachea of infected
   birds, but only the PASC8 strain was found in the oviduct. Furthermore,
   EAA developed only in the group infected with PASC8 strain. Compared to
   the control group, both strains produced an adverse impact on egg
   production: a decrease in the numbers laid and in their average weight
   (P < 0.05) This work demonstrates a difference in oviduct tropism
   between two Ms strains and a possible relationship to the production of
   EAA in experimental conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 14}},
Abstract = {{Repeated introductions and spread of invasive mosquito species (IMS)
   have been recorded on a large scale these last decades worldwide. In
   this context, members of the mosquito genus Aedes can present serious
   risks to public health as they have or may develop vector competence for
   various viral diseases. While the Tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) is a
   well-known vector for e.g. dengue and chikungunya viruses, the Asian
   bush mosquito (Ae. j. japonicus) and Ae. koreicus have shown vector
   competence in the field and the laboratory for a number of viruses
   including dengue, West Nile fever and Japanese encephalitis. Early
   detection and identification is therefore crucial for successful
   eradication or control strategies. Traditional specific identification
   and monitoring of different and/or cryptic life stages of the invasive
   Aedes species based on morphological grounds may lead to
   misidentifications, and are problematic when extensive surveillance is
   needed. In this study, we developed, tested and applied an environmental
   DNA (eDNA) approach for the detection of three IMS, based on water
   samples collected in the field in several European countries. We
   compared real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays specific for these
   three species and an eDNA metabarcoding approach with traditional
   sampling, and discussed the advantages and limitations of these methods.
   Detection probabilities for eDNA-based approaches were in most of the
   specific comparisons higher than for traditional survey and the results
   were congruent between both molecular methods, confirming the
   reliability and efficiency of alternative eDNA-based techniques for the
   early and unambiguous detection and surveillance of invasive mosquito
   vectors. The ease of water sampling procedures in the eDNA approach
   tested here allows the development of large-scale monitoring and
   surveillance programs of IMS, especially using citizen science projects.}},

Title = {{Information and organization in public health institutes: an
   ontology-based modeling of the entities in the reception-analysis-report
   phases}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL SEMANTICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{SEP 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Ontologies are widely used both in the life sciences and in
   the management of public and private companies. Typically, the different
   offices in an organization develop their own models and related
   ontologies to capture specific tasks and goals. Although there might be
   an overall coordination, the use of distinct ontologies can jeopardize
   the integration of data across the organization since data sharing and
   reusability are sensitive to modeling choices.
   Results: The paper provides a study of the entities that are typically
   found at the reception, analysis and report phases in public institutes
   in the life science domain. Ontological considerations and techniques
   are introduced and their implementation exemplified by studying the
   Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie (IZSVe), a public
   veterinarian institute with different geographical locations and several
   laboratories. Different modeling issues are discussed like the
   identification and characterization of the main entities in these
   phases; the classification of the (types of) data; the clarification of
   the contexts and the roles of the involved entities. The study is based
   on a foundational ontology and shows how it can be extended to a
   comprehensive and coherent framework comprising the different
   institute's roles, processes and data. In particular, it shows how to
   use notions lying at the borderline between ontology and applications,
   like that of knowledge object. The paper aims to help the modeler to
   understand the core viewpoint of the organization and to improve data
   transparency.
   Conclusions: The study shows that the entities at play can be analyzed
   within a single ontological perspective allowing us to isolate a single
   ontological framework for the whole organization. This facilitates the
   development of coherent representations of the entities and related
   data, and fosters the use of integrated software for data management and
   reasoning across the company.}},

   immunological and protection effects}},
Journal = {{VETERINARY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{The European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) is an important farmed fish
   species in the Mediterranean area, very sensitive to the infection by
   encephalopathy and retinopathy virus (VERv), or Betanodavirus, which
   causes massive mortalities. Effective vaccines to fight the pathology
   are not yet available and in this work we describe a promising
   intraperitoneal immunization route against VERv of sea bass juveniles.
   We performed intraperitoneal and immersion immunization trials with a
   VERv (isolate 283.2009 RGNNV) inactivated by formalin,
   beta-propiolactone and heat treatment. Interestingly, the
   intraperitoneal immunization with formalin-inactivated VERv induced a
   significant antigen-specific IgM production, differently from other
   inactivation protocols. However, the same formalin-inactivated antigen
   resulted in very low IgM antibodies when administered by immersion.
   Following the intraperitoneal injection with formalin-inactivated virus,
   the quantitative expression of the antiviral MxA gene showed a
   modulation of transcripts in the gut after 48 h and on head kidney after
   24 h, whereas ISG12 gene was significantly up-regulated after 48 h on
   both tissues. In immersion immunization with formalin-inactivated VERv,
   a modulation of MxA and ISG12 genes after 24 h post-treatment was
   detected in the gills. An effective uptake of VERv particles in the
   gills was confirmed by immunohistochemistry using anti-VERv antibodies.
   Lastly, in challenge experiments using live VERv after intraperitoneal
   immunization with formalin-inactivated VERv, we observed a significant
   increase (81.9\%) in relative survival percentage with respect to
   non-immunized fish, whereas immersion immunization resulted in no
   protection. Our results suggest that intraperitoneal immunization with
   formalin-inactivated VERv could be a safe and effective strategy to
   fight Betanodavirus infection in European sea bass.}},

Journal = {{FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{266}},

Abstract = {{In the present paper we analyze and discuss about the records referring
   to animal poisonings and poisoned baits cases covering the period
   between 2007 and 2013 and submitted for diagnostic investigations to the
   Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie (IZSVe), which is
   the public veterinary health institute competent for the north eastern
   Italian regions.
   All data were gathered by a passive surveillance system based on
   voluntary reporting, which became mandatory in 2009 after a decree of
   the Italian Ministry of Health had come into force. This prohibited the
   use and detention of poisoned baits and ordered to selected institutions
   and professionals to carry out standardized surveys to assess suspect
   and/or confirmed reported cases; all the necessary anatomopathological
   and toxicological investigations to confirm the reported cases were then
   performed for free by public veterinary health institutes whenever a
   veterinarian diagnosis or clinical suspicion were provided.
   Totally, 1831 suspected animals poisoning and 698 cases of supposed
   poisoned baits recovery episodes were registered. 642/1831 (35.1\%)
   animal poisoning cases were confirmed and the presence of toxic agents
   was verified in 292/698 baits (41.8\%). The most severely affected
   territories were the ones with the highest level of urbanization and
   those most densely populated in the study area. Dogs and cats seemed to
   be greatly affected by poisoning cases and a characteristic seasonal
   trend was noticed, with an increase of episodes in late Winter/early
   Spring and in Autumn. Carbamate insecticides resulted to be the main
   cause for animal poisoning, while anticoagulants rodenticides played a
   primary role among toxicants found in poisoned baits. The presented
   results emphasize thatmalicious animal poisoning is a widespread problem
   in north-eastern Italy. The still relevant number of reported poisoning
   events caused by some banned pesticides poses the problem of identifying
   where these substances come from and brings to light the popular
   knowledge about the high toxicity of these compounds. Moreover, the
   noticeable increase of the number of episodes registered in 2009 pointed
   out how the above mentioned decree may have contributed to reveal a

Abstract = {{Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is one of the leading causes of
   cancer-related deaths worldwide and the development of new treatment
   strategies for PDA patients is of crucial importance. Virotherapy uses
   natural or engineered oncolytic viruses (OVs) to selectively kill tumour
   cells. Due to their genetic heterogeneity, PDA cells are highly variable
   in their permissiveness to various OVs. The avian influenza A virus
   (IAV) H7N3 A/turkey/Italy/2962/03 is a potent inducer of apoptosis in
   PDA cells previously shown to be resistant to other OVs (Kasloff et al.,
   2014), suggesting that it might be effective against specific subclasses
   of pancreatic cancer. To improve the selectivity of the avian influenza
   isolate for PDA cells, here confirmed deficient for IFN response, we
   engineered a truncation in the NS1 gene that is the major virus-encoded
   IFN antagonist. The recombinant virus (NS1-77) replicated efficiently in
   PDA cells, but was attenuated in non-malignant pancreatic ductal cells,
   in which it induced a potent IFN response that acted upon bystander
   uninfected cancer cells, triggering their death. The engineered virus
   displayed an enhanced ability to debulk a PDA-derived tumour in
   xenograft mouse model. Our results highlight the possibility of
   selecting an IAV strain from the diverse natural avian reservoir on the
   basis of its inherent oncolytic potency in specific PDA subclasses and,
   through engineering, improve its safety, selectivity and debulking
   activity for cancer treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Viral encephalopathy and retinopathy (VER) is one of the most
   devastating and economically relevant diseases for marine aquaculture.
   The presence of betanodavirus in freshwater fish is recorded, but very
   little is known about VER outbreaks in marine species reared in
   freshwater. Our study investigated the ability of betanodavirus to cause
   disease in European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, reared at different
   salinity levels. Fish were challenged with RGNNV or mock infected by
   bath at different salinity levels (freshwater, 25 parts per thousand and
   33 parts per thousand). Fish were checked twice a day and the dead ones
   were examined by standard virological techniques, by rRT-PCR and by
   histochemical and immunohistochemical analyses. All the infected groups
   showed a significant higher mortality rate than the one of the
   mock-infected group. VERv presence was confirmed by rRT-PCR.
   Histochemical and immunohistochemical analyses highlighted the typical
   lesions associated with VER. Our results highlight that salinity does
   not affect the ability of betanodavirus to induce clinical signs and
   mortality in European sea bass infected under experimental conditions.
   These results underline the great adaptation potential of VERv, which in
   combination with its already known high environmental resistance and
   broad host range, may explain the diffusion of this disease and the
   threat posed to aquaculture worldwide.}},

Abstract = {{Thelazia callipaeda (Spirurida, Thelaziidae) has been documented as
   agent of ocular infection in domestic animals (dogs and cats), wildlife
   (e.g., foxes, hares, rabbits), and humans. In the last two decades, this
   parasitosis has been increasingly reported in several European
   countries. Both adult and larval stages of the eyeworm are responsible
   for symptoms ranging from mild (e.g., lacrimation, ocular discharge,
   epiphora) to severe (e.g., conjunctivitis, keratitis, and corneal
   opacity or ulcers). The present study evaluated the clinical efficacy
   and safety of imidacloprid 10\% and moxidectin 2.5\% spot on (Advocate,
   Bayer Animal Health) in comparison to milbemycin oxime/praziquantel
   tablets (Milbemax, Novartis-Animal Health), as positive control, in the
   treatment of canine thelaziosis in naturally infected dogs and, a third
   group was used as an untreated control. Forty-seven dogs (27 females and
   20 males) harbouring at least one live adult worm of T. callipaeda in
   one eye were enrolled from an endemic area of southern Italy. Each dog
   was then weighed and assigned in accordance with a random treatment
   allocation plan to one of the treatment groups (G1: imidacloprid 10\%
   and moxidectin 2.5\% spot on, G2: Untreated control and G3: milbemycin
   oxime/praziquantel tablets). On Day (D) 7, 14, 28 and 35 dogs were
   physically examined and the infection level was assessed by examination
   of both eyes, including conjunctival pouch and third eyelid for live
   adult T. callipaeda count and clinical scores. Dogs in G1 were treated
   on DO and D28, whereas those in G3 on DO and D7. Efficacy in Cl was
   100\% at each day post treatment (p < 0.01). For the G3 group efficacy
   was 57.39\% on D7 (p < 0.05), 92.79\% on D14 and 100\% on D28 and D35 (p
   < 0.01). The application of the spot on formulation moxidectin 2.5\% and
   imidacloprid 10\% was highly effective in the treatment of canine
   thelaziosis caused by T. callipaeda. Advocate spot on can be recommended
   for the control of T. callipaeda infection, considering that this
   formulation is currently licensed in Europe for the treatment of a wide
   range of parasites affecting dogs. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) and viral haemorrhagic
   septicaemia virus (VHSV) are the most important viral pathogens
   impacting rainbow trout farming. These viruses are persistent in Italy,
   where they are responsible for severe disease outbreaks (epizootics)
   that affect the profitability of the trout industry. Despite the
   importance of IHNV and VHSV, little is known about their evolution at a
   local scale, although this is likely to be important for virus
   eradication and control. To address this issue we performed a detailed
   molecular evolutionary and epidemiological analysis of IHNV and VHSV in
   trout farms from northern Italy. Full-length glycoprotein gene sequences
   of a selection of VHSV (n = 108) and IHNV (n = 89) strains were
   obtained. This revealed that Italian VHSV strains belong to sublineages
   la1 and la2 of genotype la and are distributed into 7 genetic clusters.
   In contrast, all Italian IHNV isolates fell within genogroup F. for
   which only a single genetic cluster was identified. More striking was
   that IHNV has evolved more rapidly than VHSV (mean rates of 11 and 7.3 x
   10(-4) nucleotide substitutions per site, per year, respectively),
   indicating that these viruses exhibit fundamentally different
   evolutionary dynamics. The time to the most recent common ancestor of
   both IHNV and VHSV was consistent with the first reports of these
   pathogens in Italy. By combining sequence data with epidemiological
   information it was possible to identify different patterns of virus
   spread among trout farms, in which adjacent facilities can be infected
   by either genetically similar or different viruses, and farms located in
   different water catchments can be infected by identical strains.
   Overall, these findings highlight the importance of combining molecular
   and epidemiological information to identify the determinants of IHN and
   VHS spread, and to provide data that is central to future surveillance
   strategies and possibly control.}},

Journal = {{IRISH VETERINARY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{69}},
Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is an important bacterial
   infectious disease in Albania of concern to animal and human health; its
   prevalence is poorly documented.
   Methods: In this longitudinal study, we tested by ELISA 2661 serum
   samples, from 154 herds, with the aim of establishing the suitability of
   this approach to screen the bovine population for bTB. In a follow-on
   survey of 87 animals in three villages, we assessed the usefulness of
   the Mycobacterium bovis IDEXX ELISA (IDEXX M. bovis Antibody (Ab) Test.
   IDEXX Europe B. V P.O. Box 1334, 2130 EK Hoofddorp, The Netherlands)
   assay by comparing IDEXX results with the results of the single
   intradermal cervical skin test. Skin tests were performed either after
   or at the time of collection of blood samples, and therefore cattle were
   not sensitized by tuberculin before serological testing.
   Results: The proportion of herds in which serologically positive cattle
   were found was 18.2 \% (95 \% CI, 1.9-25.8 \%) and the prevalence of
   seropositive cattle was 1.4 \% (95 \% CI, 0.8-2.1 \%). In the follow-up
   study, two of the 87 animals reacted positively to the skin test and two
   produced inconclusive reactions. No overlap was found between the four
   animals with positive IDEXX ELISA results and the four animals with
   non-negative skin test results.
   Conclusion: The lack of agreement between the results of the two tests
   may reflect different elements of the immune response (humoral and
   cell-mediated immunity). In future, cattle should be sensitized by the
   intradermal injection of tuberculin 14 days prior to the collection of
   blood samples, which would then be tested by the Mycobacterium bovis
   IDEXX ELISA Test in order to determine more accurately the prevalence of
   infection.}},

Abstract = {{In the past, milk whey was only a by-product of cheese production, but

   Generation Sequencing (NGS) technique was applied to several whey
   samples used for Ricotta production to evaluate the microbial community
   composition in depth using both RNA and DNA as templates for NGS library
   construction. Whey samples demonstrating a high microbial and aerobic
   spore load contained mostly Firmicutes; although variable, some samples
   contained a relevant amount of Gamrnaproteobacteria. Several lots of
   whey acquired as raw material for Ricotta production presented defective
   organoleptic properties. To define the volatile compounds in normal and
   defective whey samples, a headspace gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
   (GC/MS) analysis was conducted. The statistical analysis demonstrated
   that different microbial communities resulted from DNA or cDNA library

   multifocal, oedematous, dark red cutaneous plaques or nodules. Histology
   showed unencapsulated, infiltrating and densely cellular neoplasms
   composed of spindle cells arranged in bundles, rows and whorls
   frequently centred on capillaries. Immunohistochemistry for smooth
   muscle actin labelled neoplastic cells in all cases. Ultrastructure
   showed neoplastic cells with slender cytoplasmic processes encircling
   the capillaries, a thin basal membrane and occasional plasmalemmal
   vesicles.
   Conclusions and clinical importance - All of the data supported a
   neoplastic process producing perivascular wall tumours. Immunoreactivity
   to smooth muscle actin and the ultrastructural features were indicative
   of a pericyte origin (haemangiopericytoma). This is the first report
   dealing with Hikui disease that has achieved a conclusive diagnosis. The
   neoplastic nature of this condition suggests the potential usefulness of
   a surgical approach in the clinical management of less severe cases.}},

Abstract = {{Mastitis is the most important disease of dairy small ruminants
   affecting animal welfare, agricultural economy, and food safety. Only a
   few investigations on the bacterial epidemiology of udder infections
   have been performed. Aim of the study was to describe the Italian
   epidemiology of bacterial mastitis in small ruminant dairy herds. An ad
   hoc electronic data collection module was created by the National
   Reference Center for Sheep and Goat Mastitis (C.Re.N.M.O.C). Public
   health veterinary laboratories of the Experimental Zooprophylactic
   Institutes (EE.ZZ.II) (n=10) were selected. Nine (90.0\%) EE.ZZ.II.
   participated to the survey and 8 (87.5\%) provided a full report.
   Bacteriological culture results from 30,232 sheep and goat milk samples
   collected in 1,795 herds between 2013 and 2014 were analyzed.
   Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were the most frequently isolated
   bacteria in dairy sheep and goats, followed by Staphylococcus aureus;
   other bacterial species were Pseudomonas spp., Streptococcus uberis,
   Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus spp. and
   Coryneiforms. Italian results confirm previous findings described in
   other countries; CNS are the most prevalent bacteria, probably due to
   sub clinical symptoms, whereas Staphyloccocus aureus is the most
   prevalent clinical mastitis etiological agent. The present survey, based
   on the first, Italian standardized data electronic collection focused on
   small ruminant mastitis, may represent the backbone for future control
   and preventive strategies nationwide. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published

Abstract = {{Straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum), which have been identified as
   natural hosts for several zoonotic pathogens, such as lyssaviruses,
   henipaviruses, and ebolavirus, are associated with human settlements in
   Nigeria where they are commonly consumed as a delicacy. However,
   information on the viruses harbored by these bats is scarce. In this
   study, coronavirus sequences were detected using a nested RT-PCR
   targeting 440 bp of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in six of 79
   fecal samples collected from an urban colony of E. helvum in Ibadan,
   Nigeria. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all six sequences were
   monophyletic and clustered in lineage D of Betacoronavirus. The
   extension of two fragments allowed us to classify our sequences within
   the RdRp Group Unit defined for Kenyan Betacoronavirus from the same
   host species. These findings are consistent with the previous suggestion
   on the existence of a single epidemiological unit of E. helvum across
   sub-Saharan Africa. This theory, which is supported by the genetic
   structure of continental E. helvum, could facilitate viral mixing
   between different colonies across the continent.}},

Abstract = {{The study objective was to compare 2 commercial dry cow mastitis
   products at the quarter level, with concurrent internal teat sealant
   application, evaluating the cure risk difference, odds of a cure, odds
   of a new intramammary infection (NIMI) during the dry period, and risk
   for a clinical mastitis (CM) case between calving and 60 d in milk
   (DIM). A total of 590 cows (2,360 quarters) from 8 commercial dairy
   herds in Italy were enrolled and randomized to 1 of the 2 treatments at
   dry off: Cefovet A (CF; 250 mg of cephazoline; Merial Italia SpA, Milan,
   Italy), and Cepravin (CP; 250 mg of cephalonium dehydrate MSD Animal
   Health Srl, Segrate, Italy). Quarter milk samples were collected before
   dry cow therapy treatment at dry off, 2 to 9 DIM, and 10 to 17 DIM.
   Quarter milk samples from CM cases were collected during the first 60
   DIM. Noninferiority analysis was used to evaluate the effect of
   treatment on the risk difference of a bacteriological cure during the
   dry period, the primary outcome. The odds of cure, developing a NIMI
   during the dry period, and the risk of a CM event within 60 DIM were
   evaluated with multivariable logistic regression and hazard analysis,
   respectively. The overall crude quarter-level prevalence of NIMI at dry
   off was 15.3\%. The most common pathogen isolated from milk samples at
   dry-off was coagulase-negative staphylococci. Noninferiority analysis
   showed no effect of treatment on the risk difference for a cure between
   dry off and both postpartum samples, difference was 0.013. The least
   squares means from the multivariable model evaluating the odds of cure
   was 94\% for CF and 95\% for CP. We observed no effect of treatment on
   the odds for the presence of a NIMI at 2 to 9 DIM (least squares means:
   CF = 0.09 and CP = 0.07), nor did we note a difference in risk of
   experiencing a CM event between calving and 60 DIM (hazard ratio = 0.8).
   In conclusion, no difference was observed between the 2 products
   evaluated when assessing the aforementioned outcomes in quarters also
   receiving an internal teat sealant.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to assess the in vitro antimicrobial
   susceptibility of 73 isolates of Mycoplasma bovis isolated from milk of
   dairy cattle herds of Belgium, Germany, and Italy. Minimal inhibitory
   concentration (MIC) values were determined by the microbroth dilution
   method for the following antimicrobials: erythromycin, spiramycin,
   tilmicosin, tylosin, lincomycin, enrofloxacin, doxycycline,
   oxytetracycline, florfenicol, and tiamulin. Macrolides, florfenicol,
   oxytetracycline, and enrofloxacin, were chosen because they represent
   antimicrobials families commonly used in several countries for treatment
   of M. bovis, and their MIC values in cattle population are reported in
   several studies, allowing a comparison with previous data. Doxycycline
   and tiamulin were selected to assess the susceptibility of M. bovis to
   new antimicrobials, because they are not registered in the European
   Union for the treatment of dairy cattle. Among the agents of the
   different antimicrobial classes, the macrolides showed the highest
   concentration to inhibit 90\% of isolates (MIC90), all above the highest
   concentration tested: >8 mu g/mL for erythromycin, >16 mu g/mL for
   spiramycin, and >32 mu g/mL for tilmicosin and tylosin. Also the MIC90
   of lincomycin was above the highest concentration tested (>32 mu g/mL),
   but the distribution of the MIC values was almost perfectly bimodal: 41
   isolates had a MIC = 0.5 mu g/mL and 30 isolates >32 mu g/mL.
   Oxytetracycline had a 2-fold higher concentration to inhibit 50\% of
   isolates (2 vs. 0.5 mu g/mL) and 1-fold higher MIC90 (4 vs. 2 mu g/mL)
   than doxycycline. Enrofloxacin and florfenicol had both a MIC90 of 2 mu
   g/mL, whereas tiamulin had a MIC90 of 0.5 mu g/mL. Significant
   differences on the MIC values were found among the 3 countries for
   several antimicrobials: compared with Germany, Belgium and Italy showed
   significantly higher MIC for lincomycin, spiramycin, and tylosin, and
   lower for oxytetracycline and florfenicol. The Belgian isolates showed
   the lowest MIC for enrofloxacin compared with Germany and Italy. The MIC
   results obtained in our study suggest the presence of a high level of
   resistance of M. bovis isolates originating from milk to macrolides in
   all countries involved in this study. On the contrary, a low level of
   resistance was found against the antimicrobials that are not used in
   cattle, such as tiamulin and doxycycline, highlighting a possible link
   between antimicrobial treatments and development of resistance in the
   studied M. bovis population.}},

   (Rupicapra rupicapra subspecies rupicapra) living in the Italian Alps
   were characterized immunohistochemically. Seven primary antibodies
   (against human CD3, CD79 alpha cy, CD68, or ovine CD4, CD8, CD21 and
   gamma delta T-cell receptor {[}TCR] epitopes) were tested on tissues
   fixed either in formalin or in zinc salts (ZS) and cross-reactivity with

   identification of immune cells, without the need for antigen retrieval.
   CD4(+) and CD21(+) cells were labelled only in ZS-fixed tissues.
   Reagents specific for human CD3, CD79 and CD68 antigens successfully
   detected chamois immune cells, both in ZS-fixed and formalin-fixed
   tissues. The reactivity and distribution of immune cells in lymph nodes

Abstract = {{In the last decades, molecular techniques have gradually been adopted
   for the rapid confirmation of results obtained through gold standard
   methods. However, international organisations discourage their use in
   routine laboratory investigations for rabies post-mortem diagnosis, as
   they may lead to false positive results due to cross-contamination.
   Cleaning and disinfection are essential to prevent cross contamination
   of samples in the laboratory environment. The present study evaluated
   the efficacy of selected disinfectants on rabies-contaminated necropsy
   equipment under organic challenge using a carrier-based test. The
   occurrence of detectable Rabies virus (RABV) antigen, viable virus and
   RNA was assessed through the gold standard Fluorescent Antibody Test,
   the Rabies Tissue Culture Infection Test and molecular techniques,
   respectively.
   None of the tested disinfectants proved to be effective under label
   conditions. Off label disinfection protocols were found effective for
   oxidizing agents and phenolic, only. Biguanide and quaternary ammonium
   compound were both ineffective under all tested conditions. Overall,
   discordant results were obtained when different diagnostic tests were
   compared, which means that in the presence of organic contamination
   common disinfectants may not be effective enough on viable RABV or RNA.
   Our results indicate that an effective disinfection protocol should be
   carefully validated to guarantee staff safety and reliability of
   results. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an

   Reveals New Patterns and Associations with Agro-Ecological Factors}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus has been
   circulating in Asia since 2003 and diversified into several genetic
   lineages, or clades. Although the spatial distribution of its outbreaks
   was extensively studied, differences in clades were never previously
   taken into account. We developed models to quantify associations over
   time and space between different HPAI H5N1 viruses from clade 1, 2.3.4
   and 2.3.2 and agro-ecological factors. We found that the distribution of
   clades in the Mekong region from 2004 to 2013 was strongly regionalised,
   defining specific epidemiological zones, or epizones. Clade 1 became
   entrenched in the Mekong Delta and was not supplanted by newer clades,
   in association with a relatively higher presence of domestic ducks. In
   contrast, two new clades were introduced (2.3.4 and 2.3.2) in northern
   Viet Nam and were associated with higher chicken density and more
   intensive chicken production systems. We suggest that differences in
   poultry production systems in these different epizones may explain these
   associations, along with differences in introduction pressure from
   neighbouring countries. The different distribution patterns found at the
   clade level would not be otherwise apparent through analysis treating
   all outbreaks equally, which requires improved linking of disease
   outbreak records and genetic sequence data.}},

Title = {{Molecular Basis for Antigenic Diversity of Genus Betanodavirus}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 20}},
Abstract = {{Betanodaviruses are the causative agents of viral nervous necrosis
   (VNN), a devastating disease for the Mediterranean mariculture. Four
   different betanodavirus species are recognized, Striped jack-,
   Redspotted grouper-, Tiger puffer-, and Barfin flounder nervous necrosis
   virus (SJNNV, RGNNV, TPNNV and BFNNV), but there is little knowledge on
   their antigenic properties. In order to describe the serological
   relationships among different betanodavirus genotypes, serum
   neutralization assays were performed using rabbit polyclonal antisera
   against eight fish nodaviruses that cover a wide species-, temporal-,
   spatial- and genetic range. The results indicate that the SJNNV and
   RGNNV are antigenically distinct, constituting serotypes A and C,
   respectively. The TPNNV and BFNNV, the latter representing cold-water
   betanodaviruses, are antigenically related and cluster within serotype
   B. The reassortant viruses RGNNV/SJNNV and SJNNV/RGNNV group within
   serotypes A and C, respectively, indicating that the coat protein
   encoded by RNA2 acts as major immunoreactivity determinant.
   Immunostaining of in vitro expressed wild type and chimeric capsid
   proteins between the RGNNV and the SJNNV species indicated that the
   C-terminal part of the capsid protein retains the immunoreactive
   portion. The amino acid (aa) residues determining RGNNV and SJNNV
   antigenic diversity were mapped to aa residues 217-256 and aa 257-341,
   respectively. Neutralization of reverse genetics derived chimeric
   viruses indicated that these areas determine the neutralizing epitopes.
   The data obtained are crucial for the development of targeted
   serological tests for the diagnosis of VNN, and informative for
   development of cross-protective vaccines against various betanodavirus
   genotypes.}},

Abstract = {{The present study was conducted on 428 moribund mullet fish samples to
   isolate and identify the causative agent of a mysterious acute mortality
   which recently occurred in wild mullets in Iranian waters of Caspian
   Sea, suspected to be due to viral nervous necrosis (VNN) disease.
   Disease investigation was carried out employing various diagnostic
   procedures such as virology, bacteriology, parasitology, haematology,
   histopathology, IFAT, IHC and nested RT-PCR. Brain and eye samples of
   affected fishes were collected in sterile conditions and then kept at
   -80 degrees C for cell culture isolation and nested RT-PCR detection of
   the causative agent. Other tissue samples were also collected and fixed
   for histopathology, IHC and EM examinations. CPE was observed in cell
   cultures at 6 days after inoculation. Nine samples were found positive
   with virological assay. Nested RT-PCR, performed on suspected tissues
   and CPE positive samples, showed that about 21 tissue samples and all
   the CPE positive samples were positive for VNN virus (VNNV). IFAT was
   selected as a confirmatory method for detecting the presence of
   Betanodavirus antigen, cell culture isolation results and nested RT-PCR
   findings. Moreover, VNNV particles with 25-30 nm in diameter were also
   visualized in the infected brain and retina. In pathogenicity studies,
   guppy fishes bathed in VNNV-infected tissue culture (10(-4) TCID50)
   showed clinical signs similar to naturally infected mullet after 15 days
   post infection (dpi), with mortality rates reaching up to 100\% at 30
   dpi. Affected organ samples as examined by cell culture isolation, IFAT,
   IHC and histopathology, revealed the presence of VNNV in the guppy
   fishes. In conclusion, it was confirmed that VNNV was the main causative
   agent for the disease outbreak in mullet fish in the Caspian Sea, and
   this is such first official report of VNN disease from Iran. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Neural transplantation is a promising therapeutic approach for
   neurodegenerative diseases; however, many patients receiving
   intracerebral fetal allografts exhibit signs of immunization to donor
   antigens that could compromise the graft. In this context, we
   intracerebrally transplanted mesencephalic pig xenografts into primates
   to identify a suitable strategy to enable long-term cell survival,
   maturation, and differentiation. Parkinsonian primates received WT or
   CTLA4-Ig transgenic porcine xenografts and different durations of
   peripheral immunosuppression to test whether systemic plus
   graft-mediated local immunosuppression might avoid rejection. A striking
   recovery of spontaneous locomotion was observed in primates receiving
   systemic plus local immunosuppression for 6 mo. Recovery was associated
   with restoration of dopaminergic activity detected both by positron
   emission tomography imaging and histological examination. Local
   infiltration by T cells and CD80/86+ microglial cells expressing
   indoleamine 2,3-dioxigenase were observed only in CTLA4-Ig recipients.
   Results suggest that in this primate neurotransplantation model,
   peripheral immunosuppression is indispensable to achieve the long-term
   survival of porcine neuronal xenografts that is required to study the
   beneficial immunomodulatory effect of local blockade of T cell
   costimulation.
   The intragraft expression of CTLA4-Ig, a costimulation blocker, and the
   duration of the peripheral immunosuppressive treatment can improve cell
   survival and delay local xenogeneic T cell activation following
   intracerebral transplantation of transgenic CTLA4-Ig+/+ pig xenografts

Abstract = {{Viral encephalopathy and retinopathy disease caused by betanodavirus,
   genus of the family Nodaviridae, affects marine, wild and farmed species
   including sea bass, one of the most important farmed species in Europe.
   This work describes a reliable and sensitive indirect ELISA assay to
   detect betanodavirus in biological samples using a polyclonal antiserum
   (pAb 283) against the 283/I09 virus strain, the most common red-spotted
   grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) genotype in the Mediterranean
   area, and a capture-based ELISA using a monoclonal antibody (mAb 4C3)
   specific to a common epitope present on the capsid protein. Using
   adsorbed, purified VERv preparation, the detection limit of indirect
   ELISA was 2gmL(-1) (3x10(5) TCID50 per mL), whereas for capture-based
   ELISA, the sensitivity for the antigen in solution was 17gmL(-1)
   (35x10(5) TCID50 per mL). The capture-based ELISA was employed to detect
   VERv in brain homogenates of invivo infected sea bass and resulted
   positive in 22 of 32 samples, some of these with a high viral load
   estimates (about 1.1x10(8)TCID50 per mL). The ELISA system we propose
   may be helpful in investigations where coupling of viral content in fish
   tissues with the presence of circulating VERv-specific IgM is required,
   or for use in samples where PCR is difficult to perform.}},

Abstract = {{Next-generation sequencing technology is now being increasingly applied
   to study the within-and between-host population dynamics of viruses.
   However, information on avian influenza virus evolution and transmission
   during a naturally occurring epidemic is still limited. Here, we use
   deep-sequencing data obtained from clinical samples collected from five
   industrial holdings and a backyard farm infected during the 2013 highly
   pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H7N7 epidemic in Italy to unravel (i)
   the epidemic virus population diversity, (ii) the evolution of virus
   pathogenicity, and (iii) the pathways of viral transmission between
   different holdings and sheds. We show a high level of genetic diversity
   of the HPAI H7N7 viruses within a single farm as a consequence of
   separate bottlenecks and founder effects. In particular, we identified
   the cocirculation in the index case of two viral strains showing a
   different insertion at the hemagglutinin cleavage site, as well as nine
   nucleotide differences at the consensus level and 92 minority variants.
   To assess interfarm transmission, we combined epidemiological and
   genetic data and identified the index case as the major source of the
   virus, suggesting the spread of different viral haplotypes from the
   index farm to the other industrial holdings, probably at different time
   points. Our results revealed interfarm transmission dynamics that the
   epidemiological data alone could not unravel and demonstrated that delay
   in the disease detection and stamping out was the major cause of the
   emergence and the spread of the HPAI strain.}},

Abstract = {{Type II Toxin-Antitoxin systems (TAs), known for their presence in

Abstract = {{Organic pig production differs in many ways from conventional production

   access to outdoor areas and space allowance per pig. This study
   investigated if these differences result in a lower occurrence of
   antibiotic resistance in organic slaughter pigs in Denmark, France,
   Italy and Sweden. Samples were taken from the colon content and/or
   faeces and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of ten antibiotics
   were determined in isolates of Escherichia coli. In addition, the
   proportion of tetracycline (TET) resistant E. coli in colon content
   and/or faeces from individual pigs was determined. In all four countries
   the percentage resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin, sulphonamides or
   trimethoprim was significantly lower in E. coli from organic pigs. In
   France and Italy, the percentage of isolates resistant to
   chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid or gentamicin was also
   significantly lower in the E. coli from organic pigs. Resistance to
   cefotaxime, was not found in any country. The percentage of E. coli
   isolates resistant to TET as well as the proportion of TET-resistant E.
   coli was significantly lower in organic than in conventional pigs,

   types. There were also differences between countries within production
   type in the percentage resistance to individual antibiotics as well as
   the proportion of TET-resistant E. coli with lower median proportions in

Abstract = {{Background: Many vector-borne pathogens including viruses, bacteria,
   protozoa and nematodes occur in northeast Italy, representing a
   potential threat to animal and human populations. Little information is
   available on the circulation of the above vector-borne pathogens in
   dogs. This work aims to (i) assess exposure to and circulation of
   pathogens transmitted to dogs in northeast Italy by ticks, sandflies,
   and mosquitoes, and (ii) drive blood donor screening at the newly
   established canine blood bank of the Istituto Zooprofilattico
   Sperimentale delle Venezie.
   Methods: Blood samples from 150 privately-owned canine candidate blood
   donors and 338 free-roaming dogs were screened by serology (IFA for
   Leishmania infantum, Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma phagocythophilum,
   Babesia canis, Rickettsia conorii, R. rickettsii), microscopic blood
   smear examination, and blood filtration for Dirofilaria spp. All
   candidate donors and seropositive free-roaming dogs were tested by PCR
   for L. infantum, E. canis, A. phagocythophilum, Babesia/Theileria and
   Rickettsia spp. The dogs had no clinical signs at the time of sampling.
   Results: Overall, 40 candidate donors (26.7 \%) and 108 free-roaming
   dogs (32 \%) were seroreactive to at least one vector-borne pathogen.
   Seroprevalence in candidate donors vs free-roaming dogs was: Leishmania
   infantum 6.7 vs 7.1 \%; Anaplasma phagocytophilum 4.7 vs 3.3 \%; Babesia
   canis 1.3 vs 2.7 \%; Ehrlichia canis none vs 0.9 \%; Rickettsia conorii
   16 vs 21.3 \% and R. rickettsii 11 vs 14.3 \%. Seroreactivity to R.
   rickettsii, which is not reported in Italy, is likely a cross-reaction
   with other rickettsiae. Filariae, as Dirofilaria immitis (n = 19) and D.
   repens (n = 2), were identified in free-roaming dogs only. No
   significant differences were observed between candidate donors and
   free-roaming dogs either in the overall seroprevalence of vector-borne
   pathogens or for each individual pathogen. All PCRs and smears performed
   on blood were negative.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated that dogs are considerably exposed
   to vector-borne pathogens in northeast Italy. Although the dog owners
   reported regularly using ectoparasiticides against fleas and ticks,
   their dogs had similar exposure to vector-borne pathogens as
   free-roaming dogs. This prompts the need to improve owner education on
   the use of insecticidal and repellent compounds in order to reduce the
   risk of arthropod bites and exposure to vector-borne pathogens. Based on
   the absence of pathogens circulating in the blood of healthy dogs, the
   risk of transmission of these pathogens by blood transfusion seems to be
   low, depending also on the sensitivity of the tests used for screening.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction - Bovine mastitis represents a major cause of economic loss
   in dairy production. As well as the financial implication of this
   disease, the importance of mastitis in public health should not be
   overlooked. The extensive use of antibiotics in mastitis treatment has
   possible implications for human health through an increased risk of
   antibiotic resistant strains that may enter the food chain.
   Aim - The aim of this study was the assessment of the main
   antimicrobial-resistance (AMR) patterns of bovine mastitis pathogens
   isolated in the north-east of Italy from 2010 to 2014 during the usual
   diagnostic activity.
   Materials and methods - The isolates tested were identified from
   individual quarter milk samples, which were collected from cows with
   clinical and subclinical mastitis and from dairy calves with scour. Milk
   culture was carried out according to the National Mastitis Council
   guidelines and the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated
   using agar disk diffusion method as described by NCLSI guide Vet01-A4.
   E. coli isolated from calves fecal samples were tested for antimicrobial
   susceptibility with the same method. All isolates were tested with the
   following antimicrobials: penicillin, ampicillin,
   clavulanate-amoxicillin, oxacillin, cefoxitin, cephalothin,
   cefoperazone, cefquinome, spiramycin, kanamycin, tylosin, tylmicosin,
   trimethoprim + sulphametoxazole, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, and
   rifampicin.
   Results and discussion-In this study, out of 15.926 strains, isolated
   from bovine milk, 29.5\% were Coagulase-positive Staphylococci (CPS),
   28.6\% Streptococcus uberis and Enterococcus spp., 19.5\%
   Coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CNS), 9.2\% E. coli, 7.6\%
   Streptococcus dysgalactiae, 5.6\% Streptococcus agalactiae. Overall,
   more than 90\% of isolates were Gram-positive bacteria with
   significantly (p<0.05) higher average susceptibility percentages than
   Gram-negative strains (79.8\% vs 72.5\%). For CPS, the lowest
   susceptibility values were reported towards betalactams (84.6\%),
   tetracycline (88.7\%) and macrolides (89.7\%). Within betalactams, the
   susceptibility range was wide (57.8-99\%): penicillin G (57.8\%) and
   ampicillin (65.9\%) had the lowest susceptibility values, whereas
   oxacillin (95.8\%), clavulanate-amoxicillin (92.7\%) and cephalothin
   (99\%) showed higher susceptibility. For CNS the least effective
   antibiotics were tetracycline (80.6\%), betalactams (82.2\%), macrolides
   (88.8\%) and quinolones (90\%). Betalactams showed a wide range of
   susceptibility: penicillin (53\%), ampicillin (60.9\%),
   clavulanate-amoxicillin (96.8\%), oxacillin (78.1\%), cephalothin
   (97.6\%), cefoperazone (95.6\%), cefquinome (97.9\%). In CNS high in
   vitro susceptibility was found also towards trimethoprim +
   sulphametoxazole (95.9\%), and aminoglycosides (95.5\%). The lowest
   susceptibility percentages for Streptococcus uberis and Enterococcus
   spp. were found towards aminoglycosides (19.9\%), quinolones (35.5\%)
   and tetracycline (37.2\%). Higher percentages were found for macrolides
   (65.7\%) and trimethoprim + sulphametoxazole (76.7\%), while the
   susceptibility patterns towards betalactams members were the following:
   oxacillin (51.6\%), penicillin G (86.3\%), ampicillin (82.2\%),
   amoxicillin-clavulanate (98.5\%), cephalothin (90.3\%), cefoperazone
   (91.7\%) and cefquinome (93.8\%). For E. coli the enteric isolates
   showed lower susceptibility levels compared to mammary ones towards
   tetracycline (27.3 vs 70.5\%), ampicillin (17.4 vs 56.0\%),
   clavulanate-amoxicillin (32.3 vs 66.7\%), cefquinome (86.1 vs 94.6\%)
   trimethoprim + sulphametoxazole (55 vs 87.3\%).
   Conclusions-The assessment of routine laboratory data can provide useful
   and costless information in order to improve therapeutic protocols and
   represents an important surveillance tool to investigate the level of
   antimicrobial resistance in dairy cows population.}},

Abstract = {{Rabies is a neglected zoonotic disease that causes an estimated 60,000
   human deaths annually. The main burden lies on developing countries in
   Asia and Africa, where surveillance and disease detection is hampered by
   absence of adequate laboratory facilities and/or the difficulties of
   submitting samples from remote areas to laboratories. Under these
   conditions, easy-to-use tests such as immunochromatographic assays, i.e.
   lateral flow devices (LFD), may increase surveillance and improve
   control efforts. Several LFDs for rabies diagnosis are available but,
   except for one, there are no data regarding their performance.
   Therefore, we compared six commercially available LFDs for diagnostic
   and analytical sensitivity, as well as their specificity and their
   diagnostic agreement with standard rabies diagnostic techniques using
   different sample sets, including experimentally infected animals and
   several sets of field samples. Using field samples the sensitivities
   ranged between 0\% up to 100\% depending on the LFD and the samples,
   while for experimentally infected animals the maximum sensitivity was
   32\%. Positive results in LFD could be further validated using RT-qPCR
   and sequencing. In summary, in our study none of the tests investigated
   proved to be satisfactory, although the results somewhat contradict
   previous studies, indicating batch to batch variation. The high number
   of false negative results reiterates the necessity to perform a proper
   test validation before being marketed and used in the field. In this
   respect, marketing authorization and batch release control could secure
   a sufficient quality for these alternative tests, which could then
   fulfil their potential.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid invasion and spread of Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1894) within
   new continents and climatic ranges has created favorable conditions for
   the emergence of tropical arboviral diseases in the invaded areas. We
   used mosquito abundance data from 2014 collected across ten sites in
   northern Italy to calibrate a population model for Aedes albopictus and
   estimate the potential of imported human cases of chikungunya or dengue
   to generate the condition for their autochthonous transmission in the
   absence of control interventions. The model captured intra-year
   seasonality and heterogeneity across sites in mosquito abundance, based
   on local temperature patterns and the estimated site-specific mosquito
   habitat suitability. A robust negative correlation was found between the
   latter and local late spring precipitations, indicating a possible
   washout effect on larval breeding sites. The model predicts a
   significant risk of chikungunya outbreaks in most sites if a case is
   imported between the beginning of summer and up to mid-November, with an
   average outbreak probability between 4.9\% and 25\%, depending on the
   site. A lower risk is predicted for dengue, with an average probability
   between 4.2\% and 10.8\% for cases imported between mid-July and
   mid-September. This study shows the importance of an integrated
   entomological and medical surveillance for the evaluation of arboviral
   disease risk, which is a precondition for designing cost-effective
   vector control programs.}},

Abstract = {{Ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) is a significant pathogen affecting the
   young Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, worldwide. A new variant, OsHV-1
   mu Var, has been associated with recurrent mortality events in Europe
   since 2008. Epidemiological data collection is key for global risk
   assessment; however little is known about health status and genotypes
   present in European wild oyster beds. Most studies to date have involved
   only cultivated individuals during mortality events, and reported low
   genotype diversity. With this study, conducted along the Italian coasts,
   we investigated for the first time the presence of OsHV-1 in European
   natural oyster beds. Analysis of three genomic regions revealed the
   presence of at least nine different genotypes, including two variants
   close to the OsHV-1 reference, known since the early 1990s but with no
   European record reported since 2010, and highlights relevant genotype
   diversity in natural environment. Phylogenetic analysis distinguished
   two distinct clusters and geographical distribution of genotypes, with
   the exception of a variant very closely related to the mu Var, which
   appeared the single genotype present in all the Adriatic sites.
   Interestingly, these wild symptom free populations could represent, in
   Europe, an accessible alternative to the import of OsHV-1-resistant
   oyster strains from the East Pacific, the native area of C. gigas,
   avoiding the high-risk of non-native marine species and new pathogen
   introductions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Gene expression analyses have been recently used in cancer research to
   identify genes associated with tumorigenesis and potential prognostic
   markers or therapeutic targets. In the present study, the transcriptome
   of dogs that had died because of mast cell tumours (MCTs) was
   characterised to identify a fingerprint having significant influence on
   prognosis determination and treatment selection. A dataset (GSE50433)
   obtained using a commercial canine DNA microarray platform was used. The
   transcriptome of seven biopsies obtained from dogs with histologically
   confirmed, surgically removed MCTs, treated with chemotherapy, and dead
   for MCT-related causes, was compared with the transcriptional portrait
   of 40 samples obtained from dogs with histologically confirmed,
   surgically removed MCTs and that were still alive at the end of the
   follow-up period. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), eight
   transcripts were validated by quantitative real time PCR and their mRNA
   levels were measured in a cohort of 22 additional MCTs.
   Statistical analysis identified 375 DEGs (fold change 2, false discovery
   rate 5\%). The functional annotation analysis indicated that the DEGs
   were associated with drug metabolism and cell cycle pathways.
   Particularly, members of solute carrier transporter (SLC) and UDP
   glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) gene families were identified as
   dysregulated. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the 22 additional
   MCTs identified the separate cluster dogs dead for MCT-related causes.
   SLCs and UGTs have been recently recognised in human cancer as important
   key factors in tumour progression and chemo-resistance. An in-depth
   analysis of their roles in aggressive canine MCT is warranted in future
   studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Betanodaviruses are the causative agents of a highly infectious disease
   of fish known as viral nervous necrosis (VNN). To date, 4 different
   nervous necrosis virus (NNV) genotypes have been described, but natural
   reassortant viruses have also been detected, which further increase
   viral variability. Water temperature plays an important role in
   determining the appearance and the severity of VNN disease. We assessed
   the effect of temperature (20 degrees, 25 degrees and 30 degrees C) on
   mortality and virus load in the brain of European sea bass Dicentrarchus
   labrax experimentally infected with 4 genetically different
   betanodaviruses, namely red-spotted grouper NNV (RGNNV), striped jack
   NNV (SJNNV) and the reassortant strains RGNNV/SJNNV and SJNNV/RGNNV. The
   RGNNV/SJNNV virus possesses the polymerase gene of RGNNV and the coat
   protein gene of SJNNV, and vice versa for the SJNNV/RGNNV virus. The
   obtained results showed that the RGNNV strain is the most pathogenic for
   juvenile sea bass, but clinical disease and mortality appeared only at
   higher temperatures. The SJNNV strain is weakly pathogenic for D. labrax
   regardless of the temperature used, while virus replication was detected
   in the brain of survivors only at 20 degrees C. Finally, reassortant
   strains caused low mortality, independent of the temperature used, but
   the viral load in the brain was strongly influenced by water temperature
   and the genetic type of the polymerase gene. Taken together, these data
   show that nodavirus replication in vivo is a composite process regulated
   by both the genetic features of the viral strain and water temperatures.}},

Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Background: In 2011 we identified the Asian bush mosquito, Aedes
   japonicus japonicus (Theobald, 1901) (Diptera: Culicidae) for the first
   time in northern Slovenia and in the bordering Austrian federal state of
   Styria. Between May and July 2012 the distribution area of Ae. j.
   japonicus was already found to be extended westwards into Carinthia and
   eastwards towards Burgenland and bordering Hungary. In August 2012 the
   species was first detected in a western province of Hungary. In
   subsequent years, follow-up field studies demonstrated an active spread
   westwards throughout Carinthia, reaching the border to northern Italy.
   Findings: In July 2015 several aquatic-stage specimens of the species
   were discovered at three different sites in the Friuli Venezia Giulia
   region, north-eastern Italy. In September 2015, co-occurrence of Ae. j.
   japonicus and Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1895) was observed in the same
   sample in that region.
   Conclusions: Ae. j. japonicus actively extended its geographic range
   from an established population in Carinthia (Austria) southwards to
   northern Italy by crossing Alpine ranges. Since Ae. albopictus and Aedes
   koreicus (Edwards, 1917) are already well established in northern Italy,
   it will be pivotal to monitor the consequences of a third invasive
   mosquito species trying to populate the same geographic region.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 16}},
Abstract = {{In Italy a nation-wide monitoring network was established in 2009 in
   response to significant honey bee colony mortality reported during 2008.
   The network comprised of approximately 100 apiaries located across
   Italy. Colonies were sampled four times per year, in order to assess the
   health status and to collect samples for pathogen, chemical and pollen
   analyses. The prevalence of Nosema ceranae ranged, on average, from
   47-69\% in 2009 and from 30-60\% in 2010, with strong seasonal
   variation. Virus prevalence was higher in 2010 than in 2009. The most
   widespread viruses were BQCV, DWV and SBV. The most frequent pesticides
   in all hive contents were organophosphates and pyrethroids such as
   coumaphos and tau-fluvalinate. Beeswax was the most frequently
   contaminated hive product, with 40\% of samples positive and 13\% having
   multiple residues, while 27\% of bee-bread and 12\% of honey bee samples
   were contaminated. Colony losses in 2009/10 were on average 19\%, with
   no major differences between regions of Italy. In 2009, the presence of
   DWV in autumn was positively correlated with colony losses. Similarly,
   hive mortality was higher in BQCV infected colonies in the first and
   second visits of the year. In 2010, colony losses were significantly
   related to the presence of pesticides in honey bees during the second
   sampling period. Honey bee exposure to poisons in spring could have a
   negative impact at the colony level, contributing to increase colony
   mortality during the beekeeping season. In both 2009 and 2010, colony
   mortality rates were positively related to the percentage of
   agricultural land surrounding apiaries, supporting the importance of
   land use for honey bee health.}},

Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Leishmania infantum is a canine zoonotic vector-borne
   protozoan pathogen transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies, whereas
   Anaplasma platys is a bacterium most likely transmitted by ticks. While
   vertical transmission of L. infantum from pregnant bitches to their
   offspring has been documented, thus far no studies have explored the
   possibility of vertical transmission of A. platys in dogs. This study
   investigated the occurrence of vertical transmission of L. infantum and
   A. platys in sheltered dogs during the first half of gestation, in an
   area of southern Italy characterised by a high incidence of infection by
   both pathogens.
   Methods: The study population included 20 bitches (n = 10 pregnant, at
   25-35 days of pregnancy; n = 10 nonpregnant), all subjected to
   ovariohysterectomy, which were examined for the presence of L. infantum
   and A. platys via cytological screening of bone marrow and whole blood
   samples. Infection by L. infantum and A. platys was also tested by
   immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and quantitative real-time PCR
   (qPCR) targeting both pathogens. Selected tissue samples (n = 210)
   collected during surgical procedures from bitches and foetuses (n = 20)
   were assessed for the presence of L. infantum and A. platys by qPCR
   targeting a fragment of the kinetoplast minicircle DNA (kDNA) and the
   16S rRNA gene, respectively.
   Results: Leishmania infantum DNA was not amplified from either uteri or
   ovaries from pregnant bitches or foetal tissue samples, whereas a subset
   of ovarian (n = 2) and uterine (n = 4) tissue samples from non-pregnant
   bitches were infected, with parasite loads of up to 3.09 x 10 and 7.51
   parasite/PCR reaction, respectively. Conversely, uterine (n = 10) and
   ovarian (n = 8) tissues from both pregnant and non-pregnant bitches,
   together with a subset (n=5) of foetal tissue samples were qPCR positive
   for A. platys. Leishmania infantum and A. platys nucleic acids were
   amplified from two uteri from nonpregnant bitches, with parasite loads
   of up to 2.32 x 10(-3) and 2.05 parasite/per PCR reaction, respectively.
   Conclusions: Results from this study suggest that, in contrast to L.
   infantum, A. platys can be transmitted from pregnant dogs to their
   offspring during the first half of gestation. This hypothesis remains to
   be verified, for instance via direct observation of parasites in
   postpartum foetal tissues.}},

Abstract = {{Vaccination against H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (AI) virus
   (HPAIV) is one of the possible complementary means available for
   affected countries to control AI when the disease has become, or with a
   high risk of becoming, endemic. Efficacy of the vaccination against AI
   relies essentially, but not exclusively, on the capacity of the vaccine
   to induce immunity against the targeted virus (which is prone to undergo
   antigenic variations), as well as its capacity to overcome interference
   with maternal immunity transmitted by immunized breeding hens to their
   progeny. This property of the vaccine is a prerequisite for its
   administration at the hatchery, which assures higher and more reliable
   vaccine coverage of the populations than vaccination at the farm. A
   recombinant vector vaccine (Vectormune (R) AI), based on turkey
   herpesvirus expressing the hemagglutinin gene of an H5N1 HPAIV as an
   insert, has been used in several experiments conducted in different
   research laboratories, as well as in controlled field trials. The
   results have demonstrated a high degree of homologous and cross
   protection against different genetic clades of the H5N1 HPAIV.
   Furthermore, vaccine-induced immunity was not impaired by the presence
   of passive immunity, but on the contrary, cumulated with it for improved
   early protection. The demonstrated levels of protection against the
   different challenge viruses exhibited variations in terms of
   postchallenge mortality, as well as challenge virus shedding. The data
   presented here highlight the advantages of this vaccine as a useful and
   reliable tool to complement biosecurity and sanitary policies for better
   controlling the disease due to HPAIV of H5 subtypes, when the
   vaccination is applied as a control measure.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the importance of Neospora caninum in veterinary medicine,
   knowledge of distribution of neosporosis in dog populations in some
   countries is still poor. The aims of the present study were to determine
   the occurrence of anti-N. caninum antibodies in one-hundred dogs living
   in cattle farms or dog breedings in central Italy and to evaluate the
   risk factors associated with seropositivity. The incidence of
   reproductive system disorders (e.g. infertility after first pregnancy)
   was also evaluated. Serum from breeding and farm dogs was tested to an
   indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) to assess the occurrence
   of seropositivity. Management and individual data were collected and
   analysed both by linear and logistic multiple-regression models to find
   reliable predictors of seroprevalence and anti-N. caninum antibody
   level. The seropositivity for N. caninum was 32\%. Dogs reared for
   breeding and presence of cattle on the farm were associated with
   seropositivity for N. caninum. Dogs living in the cattle farms showed a
   higher seropositivity for N. caninum (46\%) compared with those living
   in dogs breeding (18\%) (P < 0.05). The high presence of seropositive
   dogs in cattle farms of the study region demonstrates the potential risk
   of horizontal transmission of N. caninum between dogs and cattle,
   regardless the occurrence of reproductive system disorders or with
   infectious bovine tissues contact. Although the Neospora seropositivity
   in dog breedings may appear relatively low if compared with that found
   in dogs living with livestock, this infection, apparently
   underestimated, should be considered as a potential serious problem in
   canine medicine. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has dramatically changed
   bacterial typing technologies, increasing our ability to differentiate
   bacterial isolates. Despite it is now possible to sequence a bacterial
   genome in a few days and at reasonable costs, most genetic analyses do
   not require whole-genome sequencing, which also remains impractical for
   large population samples due to the cost of individual library
   preparation and bioinformatics. More traditional sequencing approaches,
   however, such as MultiLocus Sequence Typing (mlst) are quite laborious
   and time-consuming, especially for large-scale analyses. In this study,
   a genotyping approach based on restriction site-associated (RAD) tag
   sequencing, 2b-RAD, was applied to characterize Listeria monocytogenes
   strains. To verify the feasibility of the method, an in silico analysis
   was performed on 30 available complete genomes. For the same set of
   strains, in silico mlst analysis was conducted as well. Subsequently,
   2b-RAD and mlst analyses were experimentally carried out on 58 isolates
   collected from food samples or food-processing sites. The obtained
   results demonstrate that 2b-RAD predicts mlst types and often provides
   more detailed information on population structure than mlst. Moreover,
   the majority of variants differentiating identical sequence type
   isolates mapped against accessory fragments, thus providing additional
   information to characterize strains. Although mlst still represents a
   reliable typing method, large-scale studies on molecular epidemiology
   and public health, as well as bacterial phylogenetics, population
   genetics and biosafety could benefit of a low cost and fast turnaround
   time approach such as the 2b-RAD analysis proposed here.}},

Abstract = {{The first pan-European harmonized active epidemiological surveillance
   program on honeybee colony mortality (EPILOBEE) was set up across 17
   European Member States to estimate honeybee colony mortality over winter
   and during the beekeeping season. In nine Member States, overwinter
   losses were higher and statistically different from the empirical level
   of 10 \% under which the level of overwinter mortality was considered as
   acceptable with usual beekeeping conditions. In four other countries,
   these losses were lower. Using multivariable Poisson regression models,
   it was showed that the size of the operation and apiary and the
   clinically detected varroosis, American foulbrood (AFB), and nosemosis
   before winter significantly affected 2012-2013 overwinter losses.
   Clinically detected diseases, the size of the operation and apiary, and
   the non-participation to a common veterinary treatment significantly
   affected 2013 summer losses. EPILOBEE was a prerequisite to implement

   analysis of Manila clam collected in different Venice lagoon areas and
   exposed to heavy metal}},
Journal = {{AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{174}},
Pages = {{123-133}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Chronic exposure to environmental pollutants can exert strong selective
   pressures on natural populations, favoring the transmission over
   generations of traits that enable individuals to survive and thrive in
   highly impacted environments. The lagoon of Venice is an ecosystem
   subject to heavy anthropogenic impact, mainly due to the industrial
   activities of Porto Marghera (PM), which led to a severe chemical
   contamination of soil, groundwater, and sediments. Gene expression
   analysis on wild Manila clams collected in different Venice lagoon areas
   enabled to identify differences in gene expression profiles between
   clams collected in PM and those sampled in clean areas, and the
   definition of molecular signatures of chemical stress. However, it
   remains largely unexplored to which extent modifications of gene
   expression patterns persists after removing the source of contamination.
   It is also relatively unknown whether chronic exposure to xenobiotics
   affects the response to other chemical pollutants. To start exploring
   such issues, in the present study a common-garden experiment was coupled
   with transcriptomic analysis, to compare gene expression profiles of PM
   clams with those of clams collected in the less impacted area of
   Chioggia (CH) during a period under the same control conditions. Part of
   the two experimental groups were also exposed to copper for seven days
   to assess whether different ``ecological history{''} does influence
   response to such pollutant.
   The results obtained suggest that the chronic exposure to chemical
   pollution generated a response at the transcriptional level that
   persists after removal for the contaminated site. These transcriptional
   changes are centered on key biological processes, such as defense
   against either oxidative stress or tissue/protein damage, and
   detoxification, suggesting an adaptive strategy for surviving in the
   deeply impacted environment of Porto Marghera. On the other hand, CH
   clams appeared to respond more effectively to copper exposure than PM
   animals, proposing that chronic exposure to chemical toxicants either
   lowers the sensitivity to additional toxicants or blunts the capacity to
   respond to novel chemical challenges in PM clams. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Characterization of Newcastle disease virus isolates obtained from
   outbreak cases in commercial chickens and wild pigeons in Ethiopia}},
Journal = {{SPRINGERPLUS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{APR 18}},
Abstract = {{Newcastle disease (ND), caused by virulent avian paramyxovirus type 1,
   is one of the most important diseases responsible for devastating
   outbreaks in poultry flocks in Ethiopia. However, the information about
   genetic characteristics of the Newcastle disease viruses (NDVs)
   circulating in commercial chickens and wild birds is scarce. In this
   study, we characterized isolates obtained from ND suspected outbreaks
   during 2012-2014 from poultry farms (n = 8) and wild pigeons (n = 4).
   The NDVs isolated from pathological specimens, through inoculation in
   embryonated chicken eggs, were characterized biologically by
   conventional intracerebral pathogenicity indices (ICPI), and genetically
   on the basis of Phylogenic analysis of partial F-gene sequences (260 bp)
   encompassing the cleavage site. The ICPI values of isolates from
   chickens ranged from 0.9 to 1.8; whereas, the ICPI of pigeon isolates
   was 1.4. All isolates contained multiple basic amino acids at the
   deduced cleavage site of fusion protein, which is a typical feature of
   virulent viruses. Phylogenic analysis of the partial cleavage site of
   F-gene (260 bp) indicated that all the sequences of viruses obtained
   from pigeons were identical and clustered within the genotype VIh while
   the sequences of viruses obtained from chickens were clustered together
   within the genotype VIf. The similarity between the viruses obtained
   from chickens and those obtained from pigeons ranged from 82.5 to 85.6
   \%. This suggests that different sub genotypes of genotype VI are
   circulating in chicken and wild pigeon population in Ethiopia. This
   warrants further study to understand the role of wild birds in the
   epidemiology of NDV in Ethiopia and as well highlights the importance of
   continuous surveillances both in wild birds and domestic poultry.}},

Title = {{Investigating the Determinants of Toxoplasma gondii Prevalence in Meat:
   A Systematic Review and Meta-Regression}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Toxoplasma gondii is one of the most widespread parasites in humans and
   can cause severe illness in immunocompromised individuals. However, its
   role in healthy people is probably under-appreciated. The complex
   epidemiology of this protozoan recognizes several infection routes but
   consumption of contaminated food is likely to be the predominant one.
   Among food, consumption of raw and undercooked meat is a relevant route
   of transmission, but the role of different meat producing animal species
   and meats thereof is controversial.
   Objectives
   The aim of the present work is to summarize and analyse literature data
   reporting prevalence estimates of T. gondii in meat animals/meats.
   Data Sources
   We searched Medline, Web of Science, Science Direct (last update
   31/03/2015).
   Eligibility Criteria
   Relevant papers should report data from primary studies dealing with the
   prevalence of T. gondii in meat from livestock species as obtained
   through direct detection methods. Meta-analysis and meta-regression were
   performed.
   Results
   Of 1915 papers screened, 69 papers were included, dealing mainly with
   cattle, pigs and sheep. Pooled prevalences, based on random-effect
   models, were 2.6\% (CI95 {[}0.5-5.8]) for cattle, 12.3\% (CI95
   {[}7.6-17.8]) for pigs and 14.7\%(CI95 {[}8.9-21.5]) for sheep. Due to
   the high heterogeneity observed, univariable and multivariable
   meta-regression models were fitted showing that the geographic area for
   cattle (p = 0.032), the farming type for pigs (p = 0.0004) and the
   sample composition for sheep (p = 0.03) had significant effects on the
   prevalences of Toxoplasma detected/estimated. Moreover, the role of
   different animal species was dependent on the geographic location of
   animals' origin.
   Limitations
   Limitations were due mainly to a possible publication bias.
   Conclusions and Implications
   The present work confirms the role of meat, including beef, as T. gondii
   sources, and highlights the need for a control system for this parasite
   to be implemented along the meat production chain. Moreover, consumer
   knowledge should be strengthened in order to reduce the impact of
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{In 1979, an avian influenza virus of the H1N1 subtype began to circulate
   in European swine herds, rapidly replacing classical swine H1N1 viruses.
   Spill-back transmissions to turkeys were recorded occasionally, but they
   might have been underreported due to the asymptomatic nature of the
   infection and the lack of specific surveillance. In our study, we
   evaluated the infectivity and transmissibility in turkeys of seven
   strains of H1N1 avian-like swine viruses isolated from 1979 to 2006, and
   compared them with their closest progenitor A/duck/Bavaria/1/77 (H1N1),
   to establish whether the adaptation to pigs has gradually decreased
   their fitness in turkeys. Our data indicate that the circulation of
   European H1N1 in pigs might have impaired the possibility of infecting
   turkeys. Nevertheless, the two swine-origin strains, which showed the
   ability to replicate and transmit in turkeys, possess typical swine-like
   genetic traits, not different from the rest of the tested isolates,
   suggesting replication of avian-like swine H1N1 viruses in turkeys as a
   strain-dependent polygenic feature. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Although mammary gland tumors (MT) are the most-common type of tumor in
   intact female dogs, there is little information about their incidence in
   dog population. Data on MT in female dogs was retrieved from the Animal
   Tumor registry of dogs and cats of Venice and Vicenza provinces during
   2005-2013 and was analyzed to visualize crude incidence rates by breed
   and across age categories. Overall, 2744 mammary tumors were reported
   accounting for 54\% of all tumors in female dogs. The annual incidence
   rate (IR) was 250 cases per 100,000 dogs. The most frequent malignant
   tumors were complex carcinomas, consisting of both epithelial and
   myoepithelial tissues (IR= 71.89), and simple carcinomas (IR= 62.59).
   The MT incidence rate increased through the study period; particularly
   in the last 4 years, and malignant neoplasms occurred more frequently
   (70\%) than the benign counterparts (30\%). Seventy-four percent of
   tumors were diagnosed in intact females, and the mean age at diagnosis
   was significantly higher for spayed dogs than for intact ones. MT were
   less frequent in dogs younger than 6 years and increased up to
   approximately 60\% for ages between 8 and 13 years. The purebred dogs
   had a higher probability to have a malignant neoplasm than mixed-breed
   dogs, particularly in dogs younger than 7 years, and the Samoyed,
   Dobermann, Schnauzer and Yorkshire Terrier breeds were more inclined to
   develop malignant MT. The incidence of MT in dogs is increasing, and IRs
   are comparable to that in women. The epidemiological similarities
   between dogs and women support the validity of canine MT as a model for
   human breast cancer. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To assess public health hazards associated with the occurrence of AFM1
   residues in milk a survey was carried out, during 2009-2010 in six
   different major regions of Kosovo (Prishtina, Prizren, Peja, Gjakova,
   Mitrovica and Gjilan). In the present study a total of 895 milk samples
   were collected, 656 raw milk and 39 UHT milk were analyzed in 2009,
   while in 2010 the research materials consisted of 170 raw milk, and 30
   UHT milk. The occurrence and concentration range of AFM1 in the samples
   were investigated by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   (ELISA) method. From 895 samples examined, 25(2.8\%) samples were
   contaminated with AFM1; none of contaminated samples did not exceed the
   maximum tolerable limit of the EC according to the European Union
   regulation limits of 50 ng/L. In 2009, 20 out of 695 samples (2.9\%)
   were positive, and in 2010, 5 out of 200 samples examined (2.5\%) were

Abstract = {{Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the causative agent of a highly
   contagious disease that results in severe economic losses to the global
   poultry industry. The virus exists in a wide variety of genetically
   distinct viral types, and both phylogenetic analysis and measures of
   pairwise similarity among nucleotide or amino acid sequences have been
   used to classify IBV strains. However, there is currently no consensus
   on the method by which IBV sequences should be compared, and
   heterogeneous genetic group designations that are inconsistent with
   phylogenetic history have been adopted, leading to the confusing
   coexistence of multiple genotyping schemes. Herein, we propose a simple
   and repeatable phylogeny-based classification system combined with an
   unambiguous and rationale lineage nomenclature for the assignment of IBV
   strains. By using complete nucleotide sequences of the S1 gene we
   determined the phylogenetic structure of IBV, which in turn allowed us
   to define 6 genotypes that together comprise 32 distinct viral lineages
   and a number of inter-lineage recombinants. Because of extensive rate
   variation among IBVs, we suggest that the inference of phylogenetic
   relationships alone represents a more appropriate criterion for sequence
   classification than pairwise sequence comparisons. The adoption of an
   internationally accepted viral nomenclature is crucial for future
   studies of IBV epidemiology and evolution, and the classification scheme
   presented here can be updated and revised novel S1 sequences should
   become available. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{62}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Raising consumers' awareness about food safety issues is one of the
   primary objectives of Italian public health organizations. New dynamic
   and interactive tools, based on web applications, are already playing a
   leading role in health promotion campaigns targeted at adolescents.
   Among the web-based tools specifically designed for young people,
   educational videogames have proved especially effective in furthering
   learning and disseminating information, as they arouse adolescents'
   interest and curiosity. When a number of cases of Haemolytic-uraemic
   syndrome (HUS) were reported in 2010, particularly among children, the
   Italian Ministry of Health stressed the need to implement communication
   initiatives aimed at raising consumers' awareness of the potential risks
   associated with raw milk consumption at home. The pilot study described
   in the article is a relevant example of educational projects implemented
   in Italy, oriented to transmit knowledge about food risks to young
   consumers (aged 16-18). To provide correct information on safe milk
   handling practices and to reduce health issues, including serious ones,
   the videogame ``A mysterious poisoning{''} was developed. This tool was
   administered online to 359 upper secondary school students from four
   different provinces in Italy. The videogame covered all stages of the
   milk supply chain, from stable to table, and enabled players to identify
   the crucial moments when milk can be contaminated and to discover safe
   milk handling practices. By completing a series of tasks, students
   helped a detective discover the cause of a food poisoning outbreak. This
   videogame provided an opportunity for students to test their knowledge
   of the product and to receive more detailed and accurate information.
   Data collected through two structured questionnaires that were
   administered before and after the controlled use of the videogame showed
   that this serious game was capable of changing players' perception of
   risk exposure and their cognitive associations, particularly increasing
   their levels of knowledge about the risks associated with raw milk
   consumption. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   isolated from a lesser flamingo (Phoeniconaias minor)}},
Journal = {{BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{MAR 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: The role of wild birds in the transmission and spread of
   mycoplasmas is not clear. Up to now different Mycoplasma species have
   been isolated from wild birds many of which are not considered pathogens
   sensu stricto for domestic flocks. This report describes the first
   isolation of Mycoplasma synoviae in a captive lesser flamingo
   (Phoeniconaias minor) held in a zoo in Italy and the laboratory
   investigations performed to elucidate its origin. Results showed that
   the strain was similar to the MS-H vaccine strain using the vlhA methods
   although no vaccination with this product was used in the zoo.
   Case presentation: This paper describes investigations into a case in
   which 10 of 12 adult lesser flamingos (Phoeniconaias minor) died after
   having recently been moved from the Netherlands to a new zoo in Northern
   Italy. While most of the birds appeared to have died from the stress of
   movement and poor adaptation to their new environment, Mycoplasma
   synoviae, an important poultry pathogen in the layer and meat industry,
   was isolated for the first time from the trachea of one animal
   presenting catarrhal tracheitis and fibrinous airsacculitis. Genetic
   analysis of the conserved region of the vlhA was not able to
   differentiate the flamingo strain from the MS-H vaccine strain. However
   differences in the sequences of the obg gene of the flamingo and vaccine
   strain were detected. A test for temperature-sensitivity (ts) gave a
   ts(-) phenotype for the flamingo strain, in contrast to the ts(+) status
   of the MS-H strain. Based on this information and knowing that the
   flamingos were not vaccinated against M. synoviae, it is highly likely
   that the flamingo was infected with a genetically similar wild strain by
   contact with infected birds.
   Conclusions: This case provides evidence for the potential role of
   international trade of ornamental birds as a possible route of
   introduction of new mycoplasma strains between countries, and moreover
   highlight that vlhA gene sequencing was not sufficient to discriminate
   the wild strain isolated from the flamingo from the MS-H vaccine strain.}},

Abstract = {{Infections due to the pathogenic human vibrios, Vibrio parahaemolyticus,
   Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio vulnificus, are mainly associated with
   consumption of raw or partially cooked bivalve molluscs. At present,
   little is known about the presence of Vibrio species in crustaceans and
   the risk of vibriosis associated with the consumption of these products.
   The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence and
   concentration of the main pathogenic Vibrio spp. in samples of
   crustaceans (n = 143) commonly eaten in Italy, taking into account the
   effects of different variables such as crustacean species, storage
   conditions and geographic origin. Subsequently, the potential
   pathogenicity of V. parahaemolyticus strains isolated from crustaceans
   (n = 88) was investigated, considering the classic virulence factors
   (tdh and trh genes) and four genes coding for relevant proteins of the
   type III secretion systems 2 (T3SS2 alpha and T3SS2 beta).
   In this study, the presence of V. cholerae and V. vulnificus was never
   detected, whereas 40 samples (28\%) were positive for V.
   parahaemolyticus with an overall prevalence of 41\% in refrigerated
   products and 8\% in frozen products. The highest prevalence and average
   contamination levels were detected in Crangon crangon (prevalence 58\%
   and median value 3400 MPN/g) and in products from the northern Adriatic
   Sea (35\%), with the samples from the northern Venetian Lagoon reaching
   a median value of 1375 MPN/g. While genetic analysis confirmed absence
   of the tdh gene, three of the isolates contained the trh gene and,
   simultaneously, the T3SS2 beta genes. Moreover three possibly clonal
   tdh-negative/trh-negative isolates carried the T3SS2 alpha apparatus.
   The detection of both T3SS2 alpha and T3SS2 beta apparatuses in V.
   parahaemolyticus strains isolated from crustaceans emphasised the
   importance of considering new genetic markers associated with virulence
   besides the classical factors. Moreover this study represents the first
   report dealing with Vibrio spp. in crustaceans in Italy, and it may
   provide useful information for the development of sanitary surveillance
   plans to prevent the risk of vibriosis in seafood consumers. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In December 2011, the European Food Safety Authority awarded a Grant for
   the implementation of the FLURISK project. The main objective of FLURISK
   was the development of an epidemiological and virological evidence-based
   influenza risk assessment framework (IRAF) to assess influenza A virus
   strains circulating in the animal population according to their
   potential to cross the species barrier and cause infections in humans.
   With the purpose of gathering virological data to include in the IRAF, a
   literature review was conducted and key findings are presented here.
   Several adaptive traits have been identified in influenza viruses
   infecting domestic animals and a significance of these adaptations for
   the emergence of zoonotic influenza, such as shift in receptor
   preference and mutations in the replication proteins, has been
   hypothesized. Nonetheless, and despite several decades of research, a
   comprehensive understanding of the conditions that facilitate
   interspecies transmission is still lacking. This has been hampered by
   the intrinsic difficulties of the subject and the complexity of
   correlating environmental, viral and host factors. Finding the most
   suitable and feasible way of investigating these factors in laboratory
   settings represents another challenge. The majority of the studies
   identified through this review focus on only a subset of species,
   subtypes and genes, such as influenza in avian species and avian
   influenza viruses adapting to humans, especially in the context of
   highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1. Further research applying a
   holistic approach and investigating the broader influenza genetic
   spectrum is urgently needed in the field of genetic adaptation of
   influenza A viruses.}},

Abstract = {{The methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has recently
   frequently been reported in dairy cattle, usually with low prevalence.
   The livestock associated MRSA (LA-MRSA) ST398 is especially involved in
   cases of subclinical and clinical mastitis. Swine carry LA-MRSA without
   clinical symptoms and are considered its reservoir and shedder. People
   exposed to swine are particularly at risk of LA-MRSA colonization.
   Environments with relevant livestock density are a demonstrated risk
   factor for humans to be carriers of a LA-MRSA. This work investigated
   dairy farms located in an area with a high livestock density, mainly
   represented by swine. Bulk tank milk samples from 224 dairy farms were
   collected, and their status was defined as MRSA-positive or
   MRSA-negative based on culture on chromogenic medium. The number of
   fattening swine and of fattening swine herds was calculated in an area
   of 3 km around each dairy farm through georeferencing. The probability
   of a Staphylococcus aureus-positive dairy farm to be MRSA positive based
   on the extent of potential infective pressure due to swine density was
   calculated. Both the number of swine herds and the number of swine were
   associated with the MRSA status of dairy herds. The 9 MRSA isolated were
   typed by multi-locus sequence typing and spa-typing, and characterized
   for their virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance profiles. The
   ST and spa-types detected are consistent with those present in the
   Italian swine population. Virulence and resistance profiles are mostly
   consistent with the types detected. This work provides the first
   evidence of the epidemiological challenge exerted by the density of the
   swine population on MRSA in dairy cows.}},

Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{FEB 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Invasive alien species represent a growing threat for
   natural systems, economy and human health. Active surveillance and
   responses that readily suppress newly established colonies are effective
   actions to mitigate the noxious consequences of biological invasions.
   However, when an exotic species establishes a viable population in a new
   area, predicting its potential spread is the most effective way to
   implement adequate control actions. Emerging invasive species, despite
   monitoring efforts, are poorly known in terms of behaviour and capacity
   to adapt to the new invaded range. Therefore, tools that provide
   information on their spread by maximising the available data, are
   critical.
   Methods: We apply three different approaches to model the potential
   distribution of an emerging invasive mosquito, Aedes koreicus, in
   Northeast Italy: 1) an automatic statistical approach based on
   information theory, 2) a statistical approach integrated with prior
   knowledge, and 3) a GIS physiology-based approach. Each approach
   possessed benefits and limitations, and the required ecological
   information increases on a scale from 1 to 3. We validated the model
   outputs using the only other known invaded area in Europe. Finally, we
   applied a road network analysis to the suitability surface with the
   highest prediction power to highlight those areas with the highest
   likelihood of invasion.
   Results: The GIS physiological-based model had the highest prediction
   power. It showed that localities currently occupied by Aedes koreicus
   represent only a small fraction of the potentially suitable area.
   Furthermore, the modelled niche included areas as high as 1500 m a.s.l.,
   only partially overlapping with Aedes albopictus distribution.
   Conclusions: The simulated spread indicated that all of the suitable
   portion of the study area is at risk of invasion in a relatively short
   period of time if no control policies are implemented. Stochastic events
   may further boost the invasion process, whereas competition with Aedes
   albopictus may limit it. According to our analysis, some of the major
   cities in the study area may have already been invaded. Further
   monitoring is needed to confirm this finding. The developed models and
   maps represent valuable tools to inform policies aimed at eradicating or
   mitigating Aedes koreicus invasion in Northeast Italy and Central
   Europe.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Introduction - The Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD), in intensive beef
   cattle system of breeding, is, with diseases of the musculoskeletal
   system (breech and joint diseases) and clostridial disease, a major
   cause of illness and economic losses. BRD has a complex multi-factorial
   etiology (viral and bacterial), conditioned by a large amount of risk
   factors, that increase the probability and severity of the disease. In
   this regard, the identification of risk factors and the implementation
   of specific management strategies, associated with an effective protocol
   of vaccination and a specific targeted therapeutic treatment, and, if
   necessary, a metaphylactic or prevention treatment, against the
   bacterial component, it is the basis for success in the management of
   BRD.
   Aim - The purpose of this survey was to assess the overall cost of
   treatment, against the BRD, executed in the loop of fattening period of
   animals introduced into a fattening operation located in Veneto, and
   subjected to a antibiotic mass treatment ({''}in prevention{''}), with
   three different active ingredients.
   Materials and methods - Three groups of animals (group 1, 2 and 3)
   imported from France, respectively of 56, 56 and 32 animals, for a total
   of 144 animals, were included in the study, between January 2014 and
   April 2014. Within the protocol for the antibiotic treatment on arrival
   the animals of every group were randomly treated with three different
   formulations, respectively based on tulathromycin (n = 49), tildipirosin
   (n = 46) and tilmicosin (n = 49).
   Results - The morbidity rate for BRD was lower in the group tilmicosin
   (12.2\%), compared to tulathromycin (18.4\%) and to tildipirosin
   (26.1\%), although not with statistically significant values. The cost
   per head, relative to the preventive and curative treatment for BRD, was
   lower in the group tilmicosin ((sic) 26.82), compared with values
   observed in the groups tulathromycin ((sic) 38.65) and tildipirosin
   ((sic) 40.48), with a reduction of about 30\% of costs for control of
   BRD.
   Discussion and conclusions - The data obtained during the study,
   demonstrate that the use of a formulation containing tilmicosin (within
   the protocol of control and prevention) has enabled a control of BRD at
   least similar to that induced by formulations set up with two other
   molecules (tulathromycin and tildipirosin), but with a reduction in
   costs per head of the animals introduced in the fattening unit.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The slaughtering process consists of a highly coordinated
   system of different operations and is of critical importance for meat
   hygiene. The evaluation of the impact of different stages on bacterial
   counts is useful to monitor carcass contamination and to improve the
   hygiene of different stages. Escherichia coli and Enterobacteriaceae are
   considered an interesting target for microbiological analysis.
   Objectives: The aim of this review was to summarize literature data
   about the influence of slaughter stage on E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae
   counts along the poultry slaughterline.
   Results: Systematic review of the available literature and the
   meta-analysis of the data collected revealed that scalding resulted in a
   significant reduction of E. coli counts. Washing and chilling were able
   to decrease E. coli counts in a statistically significant way; however,
   the observed reductions were of no practical importance.
   Enterobacteriaceae were reduced only by defeathering and washing but no
   practical significance was observed. None of the other stages of the
   slaughterline resulted in significant changes of indicator bacteria
   counts.
   Conclusions and implications: Information provided would be useful to
   suggest suitable ways for the implementation of processes hygiene in
   poultry slaughterhouses in particular GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices)

Journal = {{VIROLOGY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{JAN 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Since the 1990s, influenza A viruses of the H9N2 subtype
   have been causing infections in the poultry population around the globe.
   This influenza subtype is widely circulating in poultry and human cases
   of AI H9N2 have been sporadically reported in countries where this virus
   is endemic in domestic birds. The wide circulation of H9N2 viruses
   throughout Europe and Asia along with their ability to cause direct
   infection in mammals and humans, raises public health concerns. H9N2 AI
   was reported for the first time in Iran in 1998 and at present it is
   endemic in poultry. This study was carried out to evaluate the exposure
   to H9N2 AI viruses among poultry workers from the Fars province.
   Methods: 100 poultry workers and 100 healthy individuals with no
   professional exposure to poultry took part in this study. Serum samples
   were tested for antibodies against two distinct H9N2 avian influenza
   viruses, which showed different phylogenetic clustering and important
   molecular differences, such as at the amino acid (aa) position 226 (Q/L)
   (H3 numbering), using haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and
   microneutralization (MN) assays.
   Results: Results showed that 17 \% of the poultry workers were positive
   for the A/chicken/Iran/10VIR/854-5/2008 virus in MN test and 12 \% in HI
   test using the titer >= 40 as positive cut-off value. Only 2 \% of the
   poultry workers were positive for the A/chicken/Iran/12VIR/9630/1998
   virus. Seroprevalence of non exposed individuals for both H9N2 strains
   was below 3 \% by both tests. Statistical analyses models showed that
   exposure to poultry significantly increases the risk of infection with
   H9N2 virus.
   Conclusions: The results have demonstrated that exposure to avian H9N2
   viruses had occurred among poultry workers in the Fars province of Iran.
   Continuous surveillance programmes should be implemented to monitor the
   presence of avian influenza infections in humans and to evaluate their
   potential threat to poultry workers and public health.}},

Abstract = {{Significant economic losses in the poultry industries have resulted from
   H9N2 low pathogenic avian influenza virus infections across North
   Africa, the Middle East and Asia. The present study investigated the
   evolutionary dynamics of H9N2 viruses circulating in Korea from 1996 to
   2012. Our analysis of viral population dynamics revealed an increase in
   genetic diversity between the years 2003 and 2007, corresponding to the
   spread and diversification of H9N2 viruses into multiple genetic groups
   (named A and B), followed by a sudden decrease in 2007, which was
   associated with implementation of vaccination using a Clade A virus.
   Implementation of the H9N2 vaccination program in Korea has dramatically
   reduced the diversity of H9N2 virus, and only one sub-lineage of Glade B
   has survived, expanded, and currently circulates in Korea. In addition,
   the antigenic drift of this new genetic group away from the current
   vaccine strain suggests the need to update the vaccine seed strain.

Abstract = {{Honey, in particular monofloral varieties, is a valuable commodity.
   Here, we present proton transfer reaction-time of flight-mass
   spectrometry, PTR-ToF-MS, coupled to chemometrics as a successful tool
   in the classification of monofloral honeys, which should serve in fraud
   protection against mispresentation of the floral origin of honey. We
   analyzed 7 different honey varieties from citrus, chestnut, sunflower,
   honeydew, robinia, rhododendron and linden tree, in total 70 different
   honey samples and a total of 206 measurements. Only subtle differences
   in the profiles of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the
   headspace of the different honeys could be found. Nevertheless, it was
   possible to successfully apply 6 different classification methods with a
   total correct assignment of 81-99\% in the internal validation sets. The
   most successful methods were stepwise linear discriminant analysis (LDA)
   and probabilistic neural network (PNN), giving total correct assignments
   in the external validation sets of 100 and 90\%, respectively. Clearly,
   PTR-ToF-MS/chemometrics is a powerful tool in honey classification. (C)

Title = {{A New ELISA Using the ANANAS Technology Showing High Sensitivity to
   diagnose the Bovine Rhinotracheitis from Individual Sera to Pooled Milk}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 13}},
Abstract = {{Diagnostic tests for veterinary surveillance programs should be
   efficient, easy to use and, possibly, economical. In this context,
   classic Enzyme linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) remains the most
   common analytical platform employed for serological analyses. The
   analysis of pooled samples instead of individual ones is a common
   procedure that permits to certify, with one single test, entire herds as
   ``disease-free{''}. However, diagnostic tests for pooled samples need to
   be particularly sensitive, especially when the levels of disease markers
   are low, as in the case of anti-BoHV1 antibodies in milk as markers of
   Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR) disease. The
   avidin-nucleic-acid-nanoassembly (ANANAS) is a novel kind of signal
   amplification platform for immunodiagnostics based on colloidal
   polyavidin nanoparticles that, using model analytes, was shown to
   strongly increase ELISA test performance as compared to monomeric
   avidin. Here, for the first time, we applied the ANANAS reagent
   integration in a real diagnostic context. The monoclonal 1G10
   anti-bovine IgG1 antibody was biotinylated and integrated with the
   ANANAS reagents for indirect IBR diagnosis from pooled milk mimicking
   tank samples from herds with IBR prevalence between 1 to 8\%. The
   sensitivity and specificity of the ANANAS integrated method was compared
   to that of a classic test based on the same 1G10 antibody directly
   linked to horseradish peroxidase, and a commercial IDEXX kit recently
   introduced in the market. ANANAS integration increased by 5-fold the
   sensitivity of the 1G10 mAb-based conventional ELISA without loosing
   specificity. When compared to the commercial kit, the 1G10-ANANAS
   integrated method was capable to detect the presence of anti-BHV1
   antibodies from bulk milk of gE antibody positive animals with 2-fold
   higher sensitivity and similar specificity. The results demonstrate the
   potentials of this new amplification technology, which permits improving
   current classic ELISA sensitivity limits without the need for new
   hardware investments.}},

Title = {{Ecological Distribution and CQ11 Genetic Structure of Culex pipiens
   Complex (Diptera: Culicidae) in Italy}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 7}},
Abstract = {{Mosquitoes in the Culex pipiens complex are considered to be involved in
   the transmission of a range of pathogens, including West Nile virus
   (WNV). Although its taxonomic status is still debated, the complex
   includes species, both globally distributed or with a more limited
   distribution, morphologically similar and characterised by different
   physiological and behavioural traits, which affect their ability as
   vectors. In many European countries, Cx. pipiens and its sibling species
   Culex torrentium occur in sympatry, exhibiting similar bionomic and
   morphological characters, but only Cx. pipiens appears to play a vector
   role in WNV transmission. This species consists of two biotypes, pipiens
   and molestus, which can interbreed when in sympatry, and their hybrids
   can act as WNV-bridge vectors, due to intermediate ecological features.
   Considering the yearly WNV outbreaks since 2008 and given the
   morphological difficulties in recognising species and biotypes, our aim
   was to molecularly identify and characterised Cx. pipiens and Cx.
   torrentium in Italy, using recently developed molecular assays. Culex
   torrentium was not detected; as in other European countries, the pipiens
   and molestus biotypes were widely found in sympatry with hybrids in most
   environments. The UPGMA cluster analysis applied to CQ11 genotypic
   frequencies mainly revealed two groups of Cx. pipiens populations that
   differed in ecological features. The high propensity of the molestus
   biotype to exist in hypogean environments, where the habitat's physical
   characteristics hinder and preclude the gene flow, was shown. These
   results confirmed the CQ11 assay as a reliable diagnostic method,
   consistent with the ecological and physiological aspects of the
   populations analysed. Since the assessment of the actual role of three
   biotypes in the WNV circulation remains a crucial point to be
   elucidated, this extensive molecular screening of Cx. pipiens
   populations can provide new insights into the ecology of the species and
   may give useful indications to plan and implement WNV surveillance
   activities in Italy.}},

   Revalor-XS (R) Implant}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL METHODS IN CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Despite the European ban of using anabolics in food-producing animals,
   growth promoters might still be illegally used in the European Union. To
   control the food chain and guarantee consumers' health, there is a need
   of highly sensitive analytical methods for the identification of marker
   residues of such treatments. In the present study, a group of bulls (n =
   16) received trenbolone acetate (200mg) and estradiol (40mg) by a
   commercial ear implant during a time range of 71 days, and a second
   group (n = 16) was kept for control. The aim of the research was to
   measure the residual urinary concentrations of the administered drugs
   (beta-trenbolone and beta-estradiol), their main metabolites
   (alpha-trenbolone and alpha-estradiol), and possible alterations of the
   urinary profile of other endogenous hormones metabolically related. The
   analytical method was based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass
   spectrometry. Results showed average urinary concentrations of
   alpha-trenbolone and alpha-estradiol during treatment in the range of
   (0.81 divided by 2.1) ng mL(-1) and (0.96 divided by 4.4) ng mL(-1),
   respectively, whereas beta-trenbolone and beta-estradiol exhibit urinary
   concentrations lower than 0.22 ng mL(-1) in both cases. Data obtained
   from the urinary profiles of endogenous steroids indicate that they
   could be useful to indirectly detect the ongoing treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Sera from 221 cattle were collected in 25 farms in Morocco to
   investigate the evidence and circulation of some of the main bovine
   abortive agents in the dairy cattle farming, where abortions are often
   reported. All sera were examined for brucellosis, 176 for neosporosis,
   88 for leptospirosis, and 42 for Bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD/MD), Bovine
   Herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) (Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, IBR/IPV), and
   Bovine Herpesvirus 4 (BHV-4) infections (at least 1 sample per herd).
   Abortions were reported in 23 (10.4\%) of the 221 tested cattle.
   Antibodies against the investigated pathogens were detected in all
   samples tested, with an overall seroprevalence of 33.48\% for Brucella,
   9.09\% for Leptospira, 8.52\% for Neospora, 37.71\% for BVDV, 50\% for
   BHV-1, 9.52\% for BHV-4. As for Leptospira antibodies against serovars
   Hardjo, Pomona, and Tarassovi were identified. Mixed infections were
   common. The lack of evidence of non-infectious factors epidemiologically
   related to abortions suggested that the investigated agents are to be
   considered important risk factors in the dynamic of the abortion
   syndrome, even if further investigations are necessary to identify the
   abortion cause. Particular attention should be paid on brucellosis,
   considering the high seroprevalence and its zoonotic relevance.}},

Abstract = {{Foodborne diseases are a major public health problem. Improper storage
   and food preparation at home can favour microbial contamination of food.
   Consumers play a crucial role in controlling this risk. To reduce
   exposure to risk, it is essential to provide information and guidance on
   contamination management in the home. The aim of this study was to pilot
   a method of participatory communication addressed to young consumers and
   designed to reduce the microbiological risks associated with the
   consumption of meat products. The methodology was based on application
   of the consensus conference' model on food safety issues. The consensus
   conference served not only as a participatory strategy to share
   knowledge but also as a method for sharing in the development of risk
   communication content (guidelines) to be disseminated to the reference
   target. Young people's perceptions, habits and behaviour in the kitchen
   were explored in the preparatory stage of the consensus conference by
   means of a survey and a focus group. Three consensus conferences were
   held in Italy attended by 60 university students (19 and 22years old).
   Application of the consensus conference model as a communication process
   proved to be an effective opportunity to engage young consumers and
   experts on the topic of food safety. This discursive participation
   approach was broadly welcomed by the participants. Specifically, direct
   interaction with the experts was considered to be an important part of
   the communication process. The findings of the project were used to
   select concise communication content based on the perceptions,
   behaviours and fact-finding needs of the selected target. Publication of
   this content in the form of guidelines on microbiological risk
   management at home has enabled the results of the consensus conferences
   to be extended and the targeted communication material on risk reduction
   in daily food handling practices to be disseminated.}},

   silvestris in Italy, in order to enhance the comprehension of its
   pattern distribution among domestic cat populations. In addition,
   wildcats were tested for other endemic vector-borne pathogens in Italy.
   The carcasses of 21 F. s. silvestris were collected from central and
   northern regions of Italy. All the animals were submitted to necropsy
   and samples of the spleens were collected. Cytauxzoon infection was
   surveyed by a conventional PCR amplifying a portion of the SSU-rDNA of
   species of Piroplasmida. The samples were also screened for Anaplasma
   spp., Ehrlichia spp., Rickettsia spp., Babesia spp., Theileria spp., and
   Leishmania spp. using SYBR Green Real-Time PCR (rPCR) assays. Four
   animals (19\%) were positive for Piroplasmida-PCR assay and three
   sequenced amplicons were obtained (14.3\%), clustering with the Italian,
   Spanish, French and Romanian Cytauxzoon spp. isolates and with C manul

Title = {{Histological Lesions and Cellular Response in the Skin of Alpine Chamois
   (Rupicapra r. rupicapra) Spontaneously Affected by Sarcoptic Mange}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Population dynamics of chamois (genus Rupicapra, subfamily Caprinae) can
   be influenced by infectious diseases epizootics, of which sarcoptic
   mange is probably the most severe in the Alpine chamois (Rupicapra
   rupicapra rupicapra). In this study, skin lesions and cellular
   inflammatory infiltrates were characterized in 44 Alpine chamois
   affected by sarcoptic mange. Dermal cellular responses were evaluated in
   comparison with chamois affected by trombiculosis and controls. In both
   sarcoptic mange and trombiculosis, a significantly increase of
   eosinophils, mast cells, T and B lymphocytes, and macrophages was
   detected. Moreover, in sarcoptic mange significant higher numbers of T
   lymphocytes and macrophages compared to trombiculosis were observed.
   Lesions in sarcoptic mange were classified in three grades, according to
   crusts thickness, correlated with mite counts. Grade 3 represented the
   most severe form with crust thickness more than 3.5 mm, high number of
   mites, and severe parakeratosis with diffuse bacteria. Evidence of
   immediate and delayed hypersensitivity was detected in all three forms
   associated with diffuse severe epidermal hyperplasia. In grade 3, a
   significant increase of B lymphocytes was evident compared to grades 1
   and 2, while eosinophil counts were significantly higher than in grade
   1, but lower than in grade 2 lesions. An involvement of nonprotective
   Th2 immune response could in part account for severe lesions of grade 3.}},

Pages = {{376-380}},
Abstract = {{One hundred and six Clostridium perfringens field strains, isolated from
   diseased turkeys in Italy between 2006 and 2015, were toxinotyped by
   polymerase chain reaction. Strains were derived from intestines (87),
   livers (17) and subcutaneous tissues (2). In addition to the four major
   toxins, strains were also screened for NetB toxin, enterotoxin and beta2
   toxin encoding genes. The intestinal gross lesions of turkeys with
   enteric disorders were statistically studied with respect to the
   presence of C. perfringens beta2 toxin encoding gene and coccidia in the
   gut. All the isolates belonged to the toxinotype A and were netB
   negative. Enterotoxin (cpe) and beta2 toxin (cpb2) encoding genes were
   detected in two (2.63\%) and 76 (71.69\%) strains, respectively.
   Toxinotype results agree with the few published reports concerning the
   genetic characterization of C. perfringens of turkey origin. On the
   contrary, the presence of netB and cpb2 genes differs from the results
   of a previous study where these genes were detected respectively in
   6.6\% and in 0.5\% of the tested strains. Necrotic enteritis in turkeys
   was not statistically correlated either to the presence of cpb2 gene, or
   to the synergistic effect operated by coccidia, even though a high
   percentage of birds with these protozoa in the gut showed necrotic
   enteritis lesions (64.29\%).}},

   On the other hand, microbiological tests (total microbial count,

Abstract = {{Bacterial proteases are involved in food spoilage and shelf-life

   metallo-protease AprX, which is produced by various strains of
   Pseudomonas fluorescens. Differences in AprX enzyme activity among
   different strains were highlighted, but the most proteolytic strains

   evaluated in 69 strains isolated from food matrices and 18 reference
   strains belonging to the P. fluorescens group, which had been previously
   typed by the multi locus sequence typing method. Subsequently, a subset
   of reference strains was inoculated in ultra-high temperature milk, and
   the expression of the aprX gene was evaluated at 22 and 6 degrees C. On
   the same milk samples, the proteolytic activity was then evaluated
   through Azocasein and trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid solution assays.
   Finally, to assess the applicability of the former assay directly on
   dairy products the proteolityc activity was tested on industrial ricotta
   samples using the Azocasein assay. These results demonstrate the spread

Journal = {{BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Background: Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV1) is a member of the viral
   subfamily of Alphaherpesvirinae that infects various species, including
   cattle, sheep, and goats. The virus causes infectious bovine
   rhinotracheitis (IBR), which is included in a European list of diseases
   that may require control and eradication programs. The lack of
   confirmatory tests affects the validity of diagnostic tools, especially
   those used for vaccinated herds. In this study, we report the
   development and validation of an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent
   assay (ELISA) based on BoHV1 glycoprotein E, which was expressed as a
   secreted recombinant antigen in a mammalian cell system. The performance
   of the new rec-gE ELISA was compared with that of commercially available
   indirect and/or blocking ELISAs.
   Results: The sample set included blood sera from animals from
   IBR-positive farms, IBR-free farms, and marker-vaccinated farms. The
   indirect ELISA proposed in this study is based on antibody reactivity
   against BoHV1 gE, and showed high sensitivity and specificity (98.41 and
   99.76 \%, respectively).
   Conclusions: The ELISA performed well, in terms of both its diagnostic
   sensitivity and specificity, and as a confirmatory methodology, and
   therefore should improve the diagnostic protocols used for IBR
   surveillance.}},

Abstract = {{For the treatment of rabbit dysentery and bacterial enteritis,
   veterinary practitioners often adopt veterinary medicinal products
   authorised for other food-producing species, but in some cases
   non-authorised drugs frequently used in the past, such as carbadox and

   olaquindox distribution and persistence in rabbit tissues, two
   independent in vivo studies were carried out. In the first study, 24
   healthy rabbits received water medicated with carbadox at 100mgl(-1)
   over a period 28days, whereas in the second one, 24 healthy rabbits were
   administered water containing olaquindox at 100mgl(-1). In each study
   rabbits were randomly assigned to four groups to be sacrificed
   respectively at 0, 5, 10 and 20days from treatment withdrawal, for
   depletion studies. A control group of six animals was adopted for
   control and as a reservoir of blank tissues. Muscle and liver samples
   collected from each treated animal were stored at -20 degrees C pending
   the analysis. Sensitive and robust liquid chromatography-tandem mass
   spectrometry analytical methods were set up for the parent compounds and
   their main metabolites quinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid, desoxycarbadox and
   3-methylquinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid to verify their residual. Data
   collected demonstrate that the combination of liver as target matrix,
   quinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid and 3-methylquinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid
   as marker residue and enzymatic digestion is strategic to evidence
   carbadox and/or olaquindox illegal treatments in rabbits, even 20days

Abstract = {{Clostridium difficile is an important cause of enteric disease in humans
   and animals. Recent studies demonstrated a genetic overlap between C.
   difficile isolated from animals and humans suggesting animals as
   possible reservoir for human pathogenic strains.
   This study was a preliminary investigation on the occurrence of C.
   difficile in rabbits raised in industrial holdings for food production
   and aimed to characterise isolates and estimate their antimicrobial
   susceptibility.
   C. difficile isolates were characterized by toxin profiles, toxinotyping
   and PCR-ribotyping. The MICs of six antibiotics were determined using
   E-test.
   Between 2007 and 2013, 285 industrial holdings (representing 40\% of the
   national census) submitted rabbits to our laboratory for diagnostic
   purposes, among these holdings, groups of three to five post weaned
   rabbits were sampled once by convenience. 1279 samples of caecal content
   were collected. The overall isolation rate of C. difficile from the
   enteric specimen was 3\% (38/1279), with no difference among animals
   affected or not by enteric disorders. Among isolates 66\% (25/38) were
   toxigenic. Sixteen different PCR-ribotypes (RTs) were identified. Among
   the toxigenic strains RT-014/020, RT-078 and RT-012 were found in at
   least three rabbit holdings. According to the ECOFF threshold, 82\%
   (31/38) C. difficile isolates displayed a reduced susceptibility to at
   least one and 18\% (7/38) to three tested antimicrobials.
   Rabbits are colonized by heterogeneous C. difficile ribotypes many of
   which are commonly isolated in humans. One third of isolates displayed a
   reduced susceptibility to MTZ, the first choice antimicrobial for human
   CDI treatment. According to our findings rabbits are a potential source
   of C. difficile for humans. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ANAEROBE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{25-29}},

Abstract = {{Bovine botulism is a sporadic acute disease that, usually causes
   catastrophic losses in the herds. The unusual clinical evolution of a
   persistent mild outbreak in a dairy herd, prompted us to characterize
   the neurotoxin gene profile of the strain involved and to evaluate
   whether seroconversion had occurred.
   Diagnosis was based on mild classical symptoms and was supported by PCR
   and bacteriological findings, which revealed the involvement of a
   non-mosaic type C strain.
   An in-house ELISA was developed to detect antibodies to botulinum
   neurotoxin type C and its performance was evaluated in a vaccination
   study.
   Fifty days after the index case, fecal and serum samples were collected
   from the 14 animals of the herd and screened for Clostridium botulinum
   and anti-botulinum neurotoxin antibodies type C, respectively. The
   in-house developed ELISA was also used to test 100 sera samples randomly
   collected from 20 herds.
   Strong ELISA reactions were observed in 3 convalescent and 5
   asymptomatic animals involved in the studied outbreak. The
   ELISA-positive cows all tested positive for non-mosaic C. botulinum type
   C in the feces and the same strain was also detected in the alfalfa hay,
   suspected to be the carrier source. Ten out of the 100 randomly
   collected sera tested positive for anti-botulinum neurotoxin type C
   antibodies: 7 had borderline values and 3 from the same herd showed
   titers three times higher than the cut-off.
   We concluded that type C botulism in cattle may occur with variable
   severity and that prolonged exposure to sublethal doses of botulinum
   neurotoxin C may occur, resulting in detectable antibodies. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Among consumer food handling practices, time-temperature abuse has been
   reported as one of the most common contributory factors in salmonellosis
   outbreaks where the evidence is strong. The present study performed
   storage tests of burgers, sausages, and kebabs and investigated (i) the
   effect of refrigerator temperatures (4 degrees C versus 8 or 12 degrees
   C, which were the temperatures recorded in 33 and 3\%, respectively, of
   domestic refrigerators in Italy), with or without prior temperature
   abuse (25 degrees C for 2 h, simulating transport of meats from shop to
   home), and (ii) the impact of the thawing method (overnight in the
   refrigerator at 8 degrees C versus on the kitchen countertop at 23
   degrees C) on the presence and numbers of Salmonella bacteria. Storage
   tests were carried out on naturally or artificially (Salmonella enterica
   serovar Typhimurium at ca. 10 CFU/g) contaminated products, while
   freezing-thawing tests were conducted only on artificially contaminated
   products (Salmonella Typhimurium at ca. 10, 100, and 1,000 CFU/g). The
   results from the artificially contaminated products showed significant
   (P < 0.05) growth of Salmonella Typhimurium at 12 C (i.e., from ca. 8
   most probable number {[}MPN]g to >710 MPN/g) in kebabs after 7 and 10
   days but more moderate growth in sausages (i.e., from ca. 14 MPN/g to a
   maximum of 96 MPN/g after 9 days of storage). Storage of naturally
   contaminated burgers or sausages (contamination at or below 1 MPN/g) at
   4, 8, or 12 degrees C and a short time of temperature abuse (2 h at 25
   degrees C) did not facilitate an increase in the presence and numbers of
   Salmonella bacteria. Thawing overnight in the refrigerator led to either
   a moderate reduction or no change of Salmonella Typhimurium numbers in
   burgers, sausages, and kebabs. Overall, this study showed that domestic
   storage and thawing practices can affect food safety and that
   time-temperature abuse can cause a substantial increase of Salmonella
   numbers in some types of poultry-based meat preparations, highlighting
   that efforts for the dissemination of consumer guidelines on the correct
   storage and handling of meats need to be continued.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism responsible for acquired decreased susceptibility to
   macrolides (14-membered erythromycin {[}Ery], 16-membered tylosin {[}Ty]
   and tilmicosin {[}Tm]) and to lincosamides (lincomycin {[}Ln]) was
   investigated in Mycoplasma synoviae, a pathogen that causes respiratory
   infections and synovitis in chicken and turkey. Sequence analysis of
   domains II and V of the two 23S rRNA alleles and ribosomal proteins L4
   and L22 was performed on 49 M. synoviae isolates, M. synoviae type
   strain WVU1853, and reference strain FMT showing minimal inhibitory
   concentrations (MICs) to Ty (0.015 to 2g/ml), Tm (0.03 to 8g/ml), and Ln
   (0.125 to 8g/ml); MICs to Ery ranged from 32 to 128g/ml. Our results
   showed that the nucleotide substitution G748A (Escherichia coli
   numbering) in domain II of one or both 23S rRNA alleles may account for
   a slight increase in MICs to Ty and Tm (up to 0.5 and 2g/ml,
   respectively). No correlation between the presence of G748A and
   decreased susceptibility to Ln was found. However, the presence of the
   point mutations A2058G or A2059G in domain V of one or both alleles of
   the 23S rRNAs was correlated with a more significant decrease in
   susceptibility to Ty (1-2g/ml), Tm (8g/ml), and Ln (8g/ml). All M.
   synoviae isolates tested had a G2057A transition in the 23S rRNAs
   consistent with previously described intrinsic resistance to Ery.
   Mutations G64E (one isolate) and Q90K/H (two isolates) were identified
   in the L4 and L22 proteins, respectively, but their impact on decreased
   susceptibility to macrolides and lincomycin was not clear.}},

Title = {{Current distribution of the invasive mosquito species, Aedes koreicus
   {[}Hulecoeteomyia koreica] in northern Italy}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: The invasive species Aedes (Finlaya) koreicus was first
   identified in north-eastern Italy in 2011, during the ongoing
   surveillance activity of Aedes albopictus. Following this finding, a
   more intensive monitoring was carried out to assess the distribution of
   the species and to collect biological data. Herein, we report the new
   records obtained by four years of surveillance.
   Findings: The presence of Ae. koreicus was checked using ovitraps,
   adults traps and by larval collections in all possible breeding sites
   from May 2011 to July 2015. The monitoring started in the site of the
   first detection (Province of Belluno) and was then extended in the
   neighbouring Provinces belonging to four Regions. Aedes koreicus was
   found in 73 municipalities out of 155 monitored (47.1 \%), including 23
   municipalities (14.8 \%) previously not infested. The area of first
   detection of Ae. koreicus (Province of Belluno) was also the most
   infested (68 \%). However the mosquito has also been found to the west
   (Province of Trento) and to the south and south-west (Provinces of
   Vicenza and Treviso) of the initially infested area.
   Conclusions: The spread of Ae. koreicus is directed towards south and
   west from the original infested area, likely due to the dense road
   connections and the habitat suitability of the new areas. According to
   these records, northern Italy has a high probability to be invaded by
   Ae. koreicus in the next decade. These data can be useful to validate
   predictive models of potential distribution and dispersal of this
   species in Italy or in Europe.}},

Abstract = {{Glycerophospholipids have been highlighted as the major lipids class
   affected by trenbolone acetate/estradiol implant administration in
   bovines. Non-targeted hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) and
   reverse phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) coupled to high resolution
   mass spectrometry have been successfully applied for characterizing
   lipid profile disruption in serum of implanted bovines. HILIC data
   pointed towards significant decrease of C22 fatty acids in implanted
   animals, i.e., C22:3 (p < 0.05), C22:4 (p < 0.05) and C22:6 (p < 0.01),
   whilst RPLC data confirmed depletion of glycerophospholipids
   (phosphatidylglycerols, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidic acid and
   phosphatidylethanolamine) with C22 fatty acid chains. Using these two
   complementary methods, complex lipids with the same alkyl chain have
   been putatively characterized and could further serve to understand the
   biological mechanism of illicit administration of trenbolone
   acetate/estradiol implant. These metabolites underpin
   glycerophospholipid metabolism as potential pathway, which was
   identified using metabolomic pathway analysis and MetExplore platforms.
   We hypothesized that implantation of exogenous androgenic and estrogenic
   steroids induces a depletion of glycerophospholipids with C22 FA chains,
   by decreasing high-density lipoproteins, the main transporters of
   glycerophospholipids in plasma.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of common respiratory parasites of domestic cats (the

   trichuroid Capillaria aerophila) and of neglected respiratory nematodes
   of felids (Troglostrongylus brevior, Angiostrongylus chabaudi and
   Oslerus rostratus) was here evaluated in two and three geographical
   sites of Northern and Central Italy, respectively. In 2014-2015,
   individual fecal samples of 868 domestic cats were examined
   microscopically and genetically, and epidemiological data related to
   parasitic infections were evaluated as possible risk factors by binary
   logistic regression models. The most common parasite was A. abstrusus in
   both mono- and poli-specific infections, followed by T. brevior and C.
   aerophila, while cats scored negative for other parasites. Cats positive
   for A. abstrusus (1.9-17 \% infection rate) and C. aerophila (0.9-4.8 \%
   infection rate) were found in all examined sites, while cats scored
   positive for T. brevior (1-14.3 \% infection rate) in four sites. Also,
   T. brevior was here found for the first time in a domestic cat from a
   mountainous area of Northern Italy. The occurrence of lungworms was
   statistically related to the presence of respiratory signs and more
   significant in cats with mixed infection by other lungworms and/or
   intestinal parasites. Cats living in site C of Central Italy resulted
   statistically more at risk of infection for lungworms than cats living
   in the other study sites, while animals ageing less than 1 year were at
   more risk for troglostrongylosis. Finally, the presence of lungworms was
   more significant in cats with mixed infection by other lungworms and/or

Abstract = {{Following the identification of a case of severe clinical mastitis in a
   Saanen dairy goat (goat A), an average of 26 lactating goats in the herd
   was monitored over a period of 11 months. Milk microbiological analysis
   revealed the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 7 of the goats. Among
   these 7 does, only goat A showed clinical signs of mastitis. The 7 P.
   aeruginosa isolates from the goat milk and 26 P. aeruginosa isolates
   from environmental samples were clustered by RAPD-PCR and PFGE analyses
   in 3 genotypes (G1, G2, G3) and 4 clusters (A, B, C, D), respectively.
   PFGE clusters A and B correlated with the G1 genotype and included the 7
   milk isolates. Although it was not possible to identify the infection
   source, these results strongly suggest a spreading of the infection from
   goat A. Clusters C and D overlapped with genotypes G2 and G3,
   respectively, and included only environmental isolates. The outcome of
   the antimicrobial susceptibility test performed on the isolates revealed
   2 main patterns of multiple resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics and
   macrolides. Virulence related phenotypes were analyzed, such as swarming
   and swimming motility, production of biofilm and production of secreted
   virulence factors. The isolates had distinct phenotypic profiles,
   corresponding to genotypes G1, G2 and G3. Overall, correlation analysis
   showed a strong correlation between sampling source, RAPD genotype, PFGE
   clusters, and phenotypic clusters. The comparison of the levels of
   virulence related phenotypes did not indicate a higher pathogenic
   potential in the milk isolates as compared to the environmental
   isolates.}},

Abstract = {{In order to investigate the pancreatic lesions caused by the infection
   with either H7N1 or H7N3 low-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses, 28
   experimentally infected turkeys were submitted for histopathology,
   immunohistochemistry, haematobiochemistry and real-time reverse
   transcriptase polymerase chain reaction after different days
   post-infection (DPI). The localization of viral antigen and the
   measurement of insulin and glucagon expression in the pancreas were
   assessed to verify the progression from pancreatitis to metabolic
   disorders, such as diabetes. At the early infection phase (4-7 DPI), a
   severe acute necrotizing pancreatitis was recognized. During the
   intermediate phase (8-17 DPI), a mixed acute/chronic change associated
   with regenerative ductular proliferation was observed. A loss of
   pancreatic islets was detected in most severe cases and viral antigen
   was found in the pancreas of 11/28 turkeys (4-10 DPI) with the most
   severe histological damage. In turkeys euthanized at 39 DPI (late
   phase), a chronic fibrosing pancreatitis was observed with the
   reestablishment of both the exocrine and the endocrine pancreas. Insulin
   and glucagon expression manifested a progressive decrease with
   subsequent ductular positivity. Haematobiochemistry revealed increased
   lipasemia in the first week post-infection and hyperglycaemia in the
   second, with a progressive normalization within 21 DPI. This study
   allowed the identification of progressive virus-associated exocrine and
   endocrine pancreatic damage, suggesting that influenza virus might be
   responsible for metabolic derangements. Moreover, it highlighted a
   remarkable post-damage hyperplastic and reparative process from a
   presumptive common exocrine/endocrine precursor. This potential
   regeneration deserves further investigation for its relevance in a
   therapeutic perspective to replace lost and non-functional cells in

Abstract = {{Q fever is a worldwide zoonotic disease caused by Coxiella burnetii (C.
   burnetii), an obligate intracellular bacterium. In ruminants, shedding
   into the environment mainly occurs during parturition or abortion, but
   the bacterium is shed also in milk, vaginal mucus, stools and urine. In
   Italy few surveys have been conducted and reported seroprevalence values
   ranged between 10\% and 60\%, even if few human cases have been
   described. Genotyping of bacteria is crucial for enhancing diagnostic
   methods and for epidemiological surveillance. The objective of this
   study was to investigate genotypic differences of C. burnetii genotypes
   directly in 34 samples, collected during a 3-years survey among 11 dairy
   cattle and 11 goat farms in the north-eastern part of Italy using a
   6-locus multiple loci variable number of tandem repeat analysis (MLVA)
   method. The samples analysed included 13 bulk tank milk (BTM), 6
   individual milk, 11 vaginal swabs and 4 foetal spleens. MLVA-type 2 was
   determined as the most prevalent in cattle in this study. C. burnetii
   strains circulating in the studied cattle population are very similar to
   genotypes previously described, while genotypes from goats showed an
   important variability. Further investigation are needed to understand
   the reason of this pattern. (C) 2015 Institut Pasteur. Published by

Abstract = {{Reference limits for metabolic profiles in Holstein late-pregnant
   heifers and dry cows were determined considering the effects of parity,
   days relative to calving, and season. Blood samples were collected from
   104 pregnant heifers and 186 dry cows (68 primiparous and 118
   pluriparous) from 60 to 10 d before the expected calving date in 31
   dairy farms in northeastern Italy. Sampling was performed during summer
   (182 samples) and the following winter (108 samples). All the animals
   were judged as clinically healthy at a veterinary visit before sampling.
   Outliers were removed from data of each blood analyte, and variables
   that were not normally distributed were log transformed. A mixed model
   was used to test the fixed effects of parity (late-pregnant heifers,
   primiparous or pluriparous dry cows), class of days relative to calving
   (60-41 d, 40-21 d, 20-10 d), season (summer or winter), and the
   interactions between parity and class of days relative to calving and
   between parity and season, with farm as random effect. Single general
   reference limits and 95\% confidence intervals were generated for
   analytes that did not vary according to fixed effects. Whenever a fixed
   effect included in the model significantly affected a given analyte,
   specific reference limits and 95\% confidence intervals were generated
   for each of its levels. Albumin, urea, triglycerides, alanine
   aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine kinase,
   conjugated bilirubin, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium,
   chloride, zinc, copper, and iron concentrations were not influenced by
   any of the fixed effects. Total protein, globulins, creatinine, glucose,
   alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyltransferase, lactate dehydrogenase,
   and sodium plasma concentrations were affected by parity. The class of
   days relative to calving had a significant effect on the concentrations
   of total protein, globulins, fatty acids, cholesterol, total bilirubin,
   and sodium. Season affected plasma concentrations of creatinine,
   glucose, fatty acids, lactate dehydrogenase, and sodium. Interactions
   between parity and class of days relative to calving and between parity
   and season did not significantly affect any of the blood analytes
   tested. The reference limits and the 95\% confidence intervals for blood
   analytes determined in the study could help dairy practitioners to
   improve the accuracy of metabolic profile interpretation in Holstein
   late-pregnant cattle.}},

   exotic pathogens such as dengue and chikungunya viruses. As they are a
   growing public health concern, methods to control these mosquitoes need
   to be implemented to reduce their biting and their potential for disease
   transmission. There is a crucial need to evaluate methods as part of an
   integrated invasive mosquito species control strategy in different
   European countries, taking into account local Aedes infestations and
   European regulations. This review presents the control methods available
   or in development against invasive Aedes mosquitoes, with a particular
   focus on those that can be implemented in Europe. These control methods
   are divided into five categories: environmental (source reduction),
   mechanical (trapping), biological (e.g. copepods, Bacillus thuringiensis
   var. israelensis, Wolbachia), chemical (insect growth regulators,
   pyrethroids) and genetic (sterile insect technique and genetically
   modified mosquitoes). We discuss the effectiveness, ecological impact,
   sustainability and stage of development of each control method. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{Although rabies incidence has fallen sharply over the past decades in
   Europe, the disease is still present in Eastern Europe. Oral rabies
   immunization of wild animal rabies has been shown to be the most
   effective method for the control and elimination of rabies. All rabies
   vaccines used in Europe are modified live virus vaccines based on the
   Street Alabama Dufferin (SAD) strain isolated from a naturally-infected
   dog in 1935. Because of the potential safety risk of a live virus which
   could revert to virulence, the genetic composition of three commercial
   attenuated live rabies vaccines was investigated in two independent
   laboratories using next genome sequencing. This study is the first one
   reporting on the diversity of variants in oral rabies vaccines as well
   as the presence of a mix of at least two different variants in all

   to use new robust methodologies in the context of their routine vaccine

Abstract = {{Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is a pathogen that infects both animals and
   humans worldwide. The epidemiology of infection caused by Y
   pseudotuberculosis is poorly understood; however, its outbreaks have
   been traced back to a probable source in wildlife. This study aimed to
   characterise Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates collected from animals with
   yersiniosis. This study included 90 isolates of Y pseudotuberculosis
   collected from different animals with yersiniosis between 1996 and 2013
   in Italy. The isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility and
   were biotyped. Genes associated with virulence plasmid pYV and those
   encoding O-antigen, high pathogenicity island (HPI), and super-antigenic
   toxin (YPM) were determined by performing PCR. Pulsed-field gel
   electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed using NotI and SpeI enzymes, and 3
   dendrograms were generated. No antibiotic resistance was found. The
   presence of pYV was shown in 57 out of 90 isolates. Virulence profiles
   of majority of the isolates indicated that they belonged to O:1a and
   O:1b serotypes, biotype 1, and genetic type 2. Isolates belonging to
   O:2a serotype were detected in sheep and cattle and were found to be
   associated (for the first time) with septicemia in hares. Y
   pseudotuberculosis isolates belonging to O:5a and 0:12013 serotypes were
   also detected in hares. To our knowledge, this is the first study to
   detect Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates belonging to the O:12-O13 serotype
   from a clinical case in Europe. Results of PFGE indicated that it was a
   reliable method for investigating the genetic relatedness of Y.
   pseudotuberculosis isolates. Thus, characterisation of Y
   pseudotuberculosis infection in animals should be considered a possible
   tool for the surveillance of pseudotuberculosis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{West Nile virus (WNV) is a recently re-emerged health problem in Europe.
   In Italy, an increasing number of outbreaks of West Nile disease, with
   occurrences of human cases, have been reported since 2008. This is
   particularly true in northern Italy, where entomological surveillance
   systems have been implemented at a regional level. The aim of this study
   was to use, for the first time, all the entomological data collected in
   the five regions undergoing surveillance for WNV in northern Italy to
   characterize the viral circulation (at a spatial and temporal scale),
   identify potential mosquito vectors, and specify relationships between
   virus circulation and meteorological conditions. In 2013, 286 sites
   covering the entire Pianura Padana area were monitored. A total of
   757,461 mosquitoes were sampled. Of these, 562,079 were tested by
   real-time PCR in 9,268 pools, of which 180 (1.9\%) were positive for
   WNV. The largest part of the detected WNV sequences belonged to lineage
   II, demonstrating that, unlike those in the past, the 2013 outbreak was
   mainly sustained by this WNV lineage. This surveillance also detected
   the Usutu virus, a WNV-related flavivirus, in 241 (2.6\%) pools. The WNV
   surveillance systems precisely identified the area affected by the virus
   and detected the viral circulation approximately two weeks before the
   occurrence of onset of human cases. Ninety percent of the sampled
   mosquitoes were Culex pipiens, and 178/180 WNV-positive pools were
   composed of only this species, suggesting this mosquito is the main WNV
   vector in northern Italy. A significantly higher abundance of the vector
   was recorded in the WNV circulation area, which was characterized by
   warmer and less rainy conditions and greater evapotranspiration compared
   to the rest of the Pianura Padana, suggesting that areas exposed to
   these conditions are more suitable for WNV circulation. This observation
   highlights warmer and less rainy conditions as factors able to enhance
   WNV circulation and cause virus spillover outside the sylvatic cycle.}},

Title = {{Food safety concerns deriving from the use of silver based food
   packaging materials}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 9}},
Abstract = {{The formulation of innovative packaging solutions, exerting a functional
   antimicrobial role in slowing down food spoilage, is expected to have a
   significant impact on the food industry, allowing both the maintenance
   of food safety criteria for longer periods and the reduction of food
   waste. Different materials are considered able to exert the required
   antimicrobial activity, among which are materials containing silver.
   However, challenges exist in the application of silver to food contact
   materials due to knowledge gaps in the production of ingredients,
   stability of delivery systems in food matrices and health risks caused
   by the same properties which also offer the benefits. Aims of the
   present study were to test the effectiveness and suitability of two
   packaging systems, one of which contained silver, for packaging and
   storing Stracchino cheese, a typical Italian fresh cheese, and to
   investigate if there was any potential for consumers to be exposed to
   silver, via migration from the packaging to the cheese. Results did not
   show any significant difference in the effectiveness of the packaging
   systems on packaged Stracchino cheese, excluding that the active
   packaging systems exerted an inhibitory effect on the growth of spoilage
   microorganisms. Moreover, silver migrated into the cheese matrix
   throughout the storage time (24 days). Silver levels in cheese finally
   exceeded the maximum established level for the migration of a
   non-authorised substance through a functional barrier (Commission of the
   European Communities, 2009). This result poses safety concerns and
   strongly suggests the need for more research aimed at better
   characterizing the new packaging materials in terms of their potential
   impacts on human health and the environment.}},

   pachydermatis. A variant of the disk diffusion procedure utilizing a
   9-mm tablet was used to test 31 isolates against clotrimazole and
   miconazole using MH-GM as test medium. The MH-GM agar optimally
   supported the growth of all M. pachydermatis isolates, provided that the
   yeast inoculum was prepared with a lipid source (Tween 40 and 80). Zone
   edges were frequently definite and clear, facilitating the measurement
   of zone size and minimizing subjectivity. The inhibition zones
   correlated with MIC values obtained in a broth dilution assay. The agar
   diffusion method with MH-GM as the test medium appears as a suitable
   procedure for testing the susceptibility of M. pachydermatis to CTZ and
   MCZ in clinical laboratories. This test format may allow processing a

Abstract = {{The use of anabolic agents in livestock production is a subject of much
   concern. Although prohibited for more than 20 years within the EU,
   growth promoting practices are still widely suspected. To meet the
   current challenges for detecting illicit practices, `omics' strategies
   have recently been demonstrated as important new investigative tools.
   These investigations, based on the observation of physiological
   disturbances, mainly in urine, demonstrated the possibility to monitor
   biomarkers enabling high throughput determination of animal status in
   terms of hormonal treatment. In this context, serum was investigated for
   the first time as an alternative and potential complementary sample
   type. A metabolomic approach based on liquid chromatography coupled to
   high resolution mass spectrometry, was exploited in order to, highlight
   metabolic perturbations in serum of Revalor-XSA (R) (trenbolone
   acetate/estradiol) implanted bovines. Univariate and multivariate
   statistical analyses were carried out to establish descriptive and
   predictive models. These models enabled the discrimination of anabolised
   from control animals, and highlighted a number of metabolites which
   contributed the most in the observed discrimination. Further, a
   screening model combining a set of selected markers intensities was
   generated and it successfuly classified animals according to their
   status, up to 4 weeks post Revalor-XSA (R) implant. This research
   indicates, for the first time, that serum metabolomics has an important
   role in screening to detect for anabolic misuse in bovines.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last few decades, the world has witnessed radical changes in
   climate, landscape, and ecosystems. These events, together with other
   factors such as increasing illegal wildlife trade and changing human
   behaviour towards wildlife, are resulting into thinning boundaries
   between wild canids and felids and their domestic counterparts. As a
   consequence, the epidemiology of diseases caused by a number of
   infectious agents is undergoing profound readjustements, as pathogens
   adapt to new hosts and environments. Therefore, there is a risk for
   diseases of wildlife to spread to domestic carnivores and vice versa,
   and for zoonotic agents to emerge or re-emerge in human populations.
   Hence, the identification of the hazards arising from the co-habitation
   of these species is critical in order to plan and develop adequate
   control strategies against these pathogens. In the first of this
   two-part article, we review the role that wild canids and felids may
   play in the transmission of protozoa and arthropod-borne agents to dogs
   and cats in Europe, and provide an account of how current and future
   progress in our understanding of the ecology and epidemiology of
   parasites, as well as of host-parasite interactions, can assist efforts
   aimed at controlling parasite transmission. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Experimental studies on comparison of the vector competence of four
   Italian Culex pipiens populations for West Nile virus}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{SEP 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: West Nile virus (WNV) is a vector-borne disease responsible
   for causing epidemics in many areas of the world. The virus is
   maintained in nature by an enzootic bird-mosquito-bird cycle and
   occasionally transmitted to other hosts, such as equines and humans.
   Culex species, in particular the ubiquitous species Culex pipiens is
   thought to play a major vector role both in enzootic and epizootic
   maintenance and transmission of WNV. Introduced in Europe in recent
   years, since 2008 WNV has been stably circulating mainly in the
   Northeastern regions of Italy, although sporadic equine and/or human
   cases, as well as WNV infected Cx. pipiens pools, have been recorded in
   other Italian areas. The scope of our study was to evaluate the
   potential competence of some Italian populations of Cx. pipiens to
   transmit WNV and to assess their ability for vertical transmission of
   the virus. For this purpose four Italian populations, from different
   areas, were experimentally infected.
   Methods: After the infectious blood meal, fed females were monitored for
   32 days to determine the length of viral extrinsic incubation period.
   WNV titre of infected mosquitoes was evaluated both by quantitative Real
   Time PCR and viral titration by Plaque Forming Units/ml (PFU/mL) in VERO
   cells. Potential Infection, Dissemination, Transmission rates (IR, DR,
   TR) were assessed by detection of the virus in body, legs plus wings and
   saliva of the fed females, respectively.
   Results: All tested populations were susceptible to the WNV infection.
   The viral presence in legs and wings demonstrated the ability of WNV to
   disseminate in the mosquitoes. Viral RNA was detected in the saliva of
   tested populations. No significant differences in TR values were
   observed among the four studied populations. The offspring of the Cx.
   pipiens infected females were WNV negative.
   Conclusions: Our study addressed an important issue in the knowledge on
   the complex WNV-vector relationships in Italy, indicating that all
   Italian Cx. pipiens populations tested exhibited vector competence for
   WNV. Further studies should be performed in order to better clarify the
   role of other factors (vector density, climatic conditions, reservoir
   presence etc.) in order to predict where and when WNV outbreaks could
   occur.}},

Abstract = {{On March 2013, the Libyan poultry industry faced severe outbreaks due to
   mixed infections of APMV-1 (Newcastle disease) and low pathogenic avian
   influenza (AI) of the H9N2 subtype which were causing high mortality and
   great economic losses. APMV-1 and H9N2 were isolated and characterized.
   Genetic sequencing of the APMV-1/chicken/Libya/13VIR/7225-1/2013 isolate
   revealed the presence of a velogenic APMV-1 belonging to lineage 5
   (GRRRQKR{*}F Lin.5) or genotype VII in class II, according to the
   nomenclature in use. Three AI viruses of the H9N2 subtype, namely
   A/avian/Libya/13VIR7225-2/2013, A/avian/Libya/13VIR7225-3/2013, and
   A/avian/Libya/13VIR7225-5/2013, were isolated and found to belong to the
   G1 lineage. Analysis of amino acid sequences showed that the analyzed
   H9N2 viruses contained the amino acid Leu at position 226 (H3 numbering)
   at the receptor binding site of the HA, responsible for human virus-like
   receptor specificity. On March 2014, an outbreak of highly pathogenic
   avian influenza (HPAI) virus of the H5N1 subtype was diagnosed in a
   backyard poultry farm in an eastern region of Libya. The H5N1 isolate
   (A/chicken/Libya/14VIR2749-16/2014) was detected by real time RT-PCR
   (rRT-PCR). Genetic characterization of the HA gene revealed that the
   identified subtype was highly pathogenic, belonged to the 2.2.1 lineage,
   and clustered with recent Egyptian viruses. This study revealed the
   presence of a velogenic APMV-1 genotype and of two influenza subtypes,
   namely HPAI H5N1 and H9N2, which are of major interest for public and
   animal health. Considering these findings, more investigations must be
   undertaken to establish and implement adequate influenza surveillance
   programs; this would allow better study of the epidemiology of APMV-1
   genotype VII in Libya and evaluation of the current vaccination
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The scientific understanding of the driving factors behind zoonotic and
   pandemic influenzas is hampered by complex interactions between viruses,
   animal hosts and humans. This complexity makes identifying influenza
   viruses of high zoonotic or pandemic risk, before they emerge from

   towards assessing zoonotic risk of influenza, we demonstrate a risk
   assessment framework to assess the relative likelihood of influenza A
   viruses, circulating in animal populations, making the species jump into
   humans. The intention is that such a risk assessment framework could
   assist decision-makers to compare multiple influenza viruses for
   zoonotic potential and hence to develop appropriate strain-specific
   control measures. It also provides a first step towards showing proof of
   principle for an eventual pandemic risk model. We show that the spatial
   and temporal epidemiology is as important in assessing the risk of an
   influenza A species jump as understanding the innate molecular
   capability of the virus. We also demonstrate data deficiencies that need
   to be addressed in order to consistently combine both epidemiological
   and molecular virology data into a risk assessment framework.}},

Journal = {{FOOD CONTROL}},

Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{115-126}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Indicator bacteria are considered an interesting target for
   microbiological analysis in order to obtain information about the
   hygiene of processes and products. Quantitative analysis targeting
   indicator bacteria offers several advantages over pathogenic bacteria
   since indicator bacteria prevalence and counts are higher, and their
   distribution is more homogeneous, than pathogens. However, although
   microbiological criteria addressing indicator bacteria are already in
   place in industrialised countries such as the EU and US, information on
   factors affecting their counts on carcasses at slaughter is scattered.
   Objectives: The aim of this review was to provide valuable information
   about the variability of indicator bacteria along the pig slaughterline,
   and to suggest suitable means for the implementation of GMP (Good
   Manufacturing Practices) and process hygiene in pig slaughterhouses.
   Conclusions: Along the slaughterline, scalding and chilling stages
   effectively reduce both Escherichia coli and Enterobacteriaceae counts
   on pig carcasses and have to be considered in the implementation of
   HACCP systems. Surface pasteurisation under experimental slaughter
   conditions was also effective; in contrast, washing did not reduce
   microbial contamination on pig carcasses. Evisceration was confirmed as
   a key contamination point, in particular regarding Enterobacteriaceae,
   but it has been suggested that bacterial load can be controlled by anal
   plugging if it is performed according to good manufacturing practices

Abstract = {{Q fever is a widespread zoonotic disease caused by Coxiella burnetii. In
   cattle the bacterial shedding can persist without symptoms for several
   months and the shedders identification is a critical issue in the
   control of the infection at herd level. Following the example of the
   human protocols for the assessment of Q fever infection status, the aim
   of this study was the evaluation of the antibody response dynamics to
   phase land phase II antigens in C. burnetii shedder dairy cows by means
   of a phase-specific serology, to verify the suitability of the
   investigated tools in recognising milk shedders. A total of 99 cows were
   monitored during time and classified on the basis of serological and PCR
   results in five groups identifying different shedding patterns. The 297
   sera collected in three sampling times were tested by means of ELISA IgG
   for differential phase I and phase II antibodies detection, while a
   selection of 107 sera were tested by means of phase specific IgM and IgG
   IFAT. Both ELISA IgG and IFAT IgG highlighted a low reactivity in
   non-shedder seropositive animals compared to chronic milk shedder
   animals. ELISA IgG seemed to perform better than IFAT IgG-IgM, showing
   significant serological differences among groups that allowed
   recognising specific serological group patterns, in particular for
   chronic and occasional milk shedders. These results supported the
   hypothesis that an animal classification based on phase patterns is
   reasonable, although it needs to be further investigated. (C) 2015

   weakness and diarrhea and, 2 days later, four of them died. At the same
   time, the bitch showed high hyperthermia (40 degrees C) and
   endometritis. The necropsy of a puppy revealed a severe lobar pneumonia
   accompanied with a bilateral nephrosis. No gross lesions were detected
   in other organs. Histopathology of the lung revealed severe multifocal
   fibrino-suppurative necrotizing bronchiolar-alveolitis associated with
   rod-shaped bacterial aggregates and diffuse interstitial lymphocytic
   infiltration. The kidney showed severe multifocal necrosis of the
   tubular epithelium and diffuse severe congestion of the parenchyma. A

   strains, Cnf positive and Cdt negative and Cnf and Cdt negative,
   respectively.
   Some E. coil pathogenic strains may cause enteric or extraintestinal
   disease. In dogs and cats, strains of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli
   (ExPEC) produce specific virulent factors such as hemolysis and
   cytotoxin necrotizing factors (Cnf). In this episode, we hypothesize
   that the bitch's milk could be the main source of ExPEC infection
   causing high puppies mortality. The role of the bitch as a carrier could
   not be excluded: stressful conditions, such as pregnancy and delivery,
   would change the host-pathogen dynamics possibly increasing the release
   of the infectious burden. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{207}},
Pages = {{30-39}},
Month = {{AUG 17}},
Abstract = {{European legislation has defined as process hygiene criteria for the
   main livestock species (cattle, sheep, goats, horses and pigs) the
   monitoring of aerobic colony count and Enterobacteriaceae. Detected
   values above the defined criteria require an improvement in slaughter
   hygiene and the review of process control. The main source of
   microbiological contamination of beef carcasses along the slaughterline
   is of fecal origin, therefore Escherichia coli and Enterobacteriaceae
   seem to be the most suitable indicators to assess the hygienic status of
   the slaughter process. Although microbiological criteria addressing
   indicator bacteria have been in place in industrialized countries for
   several years, scattered information still exists on factors affecting
   their counts on beef carcasses along the slaughterline. Therefore, a
   systematic literature review, covering the period 2000-2012, was
   conducted to gather information concerning: 1) counts of E. coli and
   Enterobacteriaceae on beef carcasses linked to different stages of the
   slaughterline; 2) factors influencing presence/counts of E. coli and
   Enterobacteriaceae on beef carcasses; and 3) the relationship between
   indicator bacteria (E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae) counts and visual
   fecal contamination of beef carcasses. According to the 41 retrieved
   papers the following conclusions were drawn. A decrease of the indicator
   bacteria counts was recorded after sequential decontamination
   treatments, such as pasteurization and hot water washing. Slaughterhouse
   characteristics influenced bacterial load of beef carcasses, although it
   was difficult to assess which factors (i.e., slaughterhouse throughput,
   design of the plant, surveillance system in place) had the greatest
   effect. Finally, carcasses from fecal contaminated animals had higher
   bacterial loads than those from clean animals. Therefore, the
   development of a visual classification system of the level of dirtiness
   of carcasses and the application of effective treatments on the
   carcasses classified as dirty along the slaughterline can lead to a
   contamination level for these carcasses comparable to or lower than that
   of originally clean ones at the end of the slaughterline. (C) 2015

Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Background: West Nile virus (WNV) is a Flavivirus transmitted to
   vertebrate hosts by mosquitoes, maintained in nature through an enzootic
   bird-mosquito cycle. In Europe the virus became of major public health
   and veterinary concern in the 1990s. In Italy, WNV re-emerged in 2008,
   ten years after the previous outbreak and is currently endemic in many
   areas of the country. In particular, the northeastern part of Italy
   experience continuous viral circulation, with human outbreaks caused by
   different genovariants of WNV lineage 1, Western-European and
   Mediterranean subcluster, and WNV lineage 2, Hungarian clade. Alongside
   the WNV National Surveillance Program that has been in place since 2002,
   regional surveillance plans were implemented after 2008 targeting
   mosquitoes, animals and humans.
   Findings: In July and September 2014, West Nile virus lineage 2 was
   detected in pools of Culex pipiens s.l. mosquitoes from northeastern
   Italy. Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of two
   representative samples identified the presence of WNV lineage 2 related
   to the Volgograd 2007 strain (99.3\% nucleotide sequence identity), in
   addition to WNV lineage 2 Hungarian clade.
   Conclusions: This is the first evidence of the circulation of a WNV
   lineage 2 strain closely related to the Volgograd 2007 outside Eastern
   Europe, where it has caused large human outbreaks. This strain may pose
   a new threat to animal and human health in Italy.}},

   Treviso province, Italy (2009-2012): an assessment of the potential
   impact of Schmallenberg virus epidemic}},
Journal = {{BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{AUG 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: Schmallenberg virus (SBV) has spread across Europe since
   mid-2011, causing unspecific and transitory symptoms in ruminants and
   congenital malformations in their offspring. Evidence for the impact of
   SBV on cattle (re) productive performance is limited. Using a
   comprehensive data set from a SBV-affected province in North-East Italy,
   this study aimed at assessing the potential impact of SBV emergence on
   11 productive and reproductive performance indicators of dairy cattle
   herds, accounting for weather conditions and other herd-level factors
   that could also influence these indicators.
   Results: A total of 127 farms with an average of 71 cows per farm (range
   29-496) were monitored monthly from January 2009 to June 2012.
   Mixed-effects linear models for longitudinal data were used to assess
   the average variation in herds' performance indicators over semesters
   (Jan-Jun 2009, Jul-Dec 2009, Jan-Jun 2010, Jul-Dec 2010, Jan-Jun 2011,
   Jul-Dec 2011, Jan-Jun 2012) and trimesters therein. Taking the second
   semester of 2011 as reference, significant decreases in the average
   lactation length (-6 days, on average) and calving-to-conception
   interval (-4 days, on average) were observed relative to the same
   semesters of the years 2010 and 2009, respectively. Similarly, during
   the last trimester of 2011, which is most likely to cover the SBV
   infection period in the study area, there was an average decrease of -4
   days (lactation length) and -7 days (calving-to-conception interval)
   compared to the same trimesters of the years 2010 and 2009,
   respectively. However, the observed decreases actually represent a
   positive outcome that is not as such imputable to SBV emergence, but
   rather reflects other beneficial changes in farm management. None of the
   other indicators showed significant variations, confirming the
   relatively mild expression of SBV infection in cattle.
   Conclusions: Although the emergence of SBV might have significantly
   affected the (re) productive performance of some individual farms, we
   concluded that overall at the province level there were no significant
   variations attributable to SBV, at least not in a way that would lead to
   negative effects on farm profitability.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical analysis has an essential role in proficiency test (PT)
   evaluation, especially when the distribution of results of the
   enumeration of microbiological bacteria is multimodal or strongly
   asymmetric, outliers aside. In these specific cases, the median or the
   robust mean of the PT results, calculated using the algorithm described
   in ISO 13528 Annex C, is not entirely appropriate for estimating the
   assigned value. A possible solution is to estimate the modes of kernel
   density function of data distribution and its uncertainty by using the
   nonparametric bootstrap technique. This method allows estimation of the
   sampling distribution of a statistic empirically without making
   assumptions about the form of the population. In the context of the PT
   for the enumeration of sulfite-reducing bacteria growing under anaerobic
   conditions organized in 2012 by QUAlity Assurance, although all
   participants used equivalent methods, the results showed high
   variability, which supported the hypothesis that two discrepant
   populations occurred in the test samples. When a bimodal distribution
   occurs, it is reasonable to suppose that at least one of the modes could
   be correct, but unless independent grounds for preferring one over the
   other are available, it is not possible to determine the assigned value
   and calculate the z-score. In the case of the sulfite-reducing bacteria
   PT, the true mode was not identified and the performance evaluation was
   not provided. For this reason, the PT provider (IZSVe) asked that the
   participants report every unusual situation for this test, should they
   occur during the next PTs. In this way, it may be possible to identify a
   plausible assigned value and its uncertainty as bootstrap mode of kernel
   density and standard error, respectively, and to provide the z-score as
   value of performance evaluation in the case of negligible uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{Salmonella is one of the main causes of foodborne illnesses in humans
   worldwide. More than 2500 different serotypes have been described so
   far. Correct identification of the serotype is essential, since the
   identification of different serotypes in animal populations and
   foodstuffs can lead to the application of different corrective measures
   according to current European food and animal legislation. Since 2007,
   Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie, in its capacity as
   Italian National Reference Laboratory for Salmonella, has organised one
   proficiency test (PT) for Salmonella serotyping per year. The
   performance of the participant laboratories is assessed based on their
   capability to correctly identify serotypes of 20 selected Salmonella
   strains. To evaluate the overall PT performance, a detailed descriptive
   analysis of all results (identification of serotype by somatic and
   flagellar antigens for each strain) has been performed. Moreover, the
   performance of each participant is assessed using the generalised
   Cohen's kappa statistic for multiple categories. The aim of the present
   study is to describe the Salmonella serotyping PT, focusing on the
   statistical approach followed to analyse the data collected. As an
   example, analysis of data obtained during the last PT (2013) is
   reported. All participants (12 laboratories) obtained kappa values
   indicative of substantial or almost perfect agreement with the expected
   results. The overall performance of the PT also indicated perfect
   agreement among participants (kappa value equal to 0.8767). Moreover,
   from 2007 to 2013, the kappa value over time was always significantly
   higher than 0.75, indicating a substantial agreement among all
   participants in the qualitative PT for Salmonella serotyping.}},

Abstract = {{Influenza A virus can quickly acquire genetic mutations that may be
   associated with increased virulence, host switching or antigenic
   changes. To provide new insights into the evolutionary dynamics and the
   adaptive strategies of distinct avian influenza lineages in response to
   environmental and host factors, we compared two distinct avian influenza
   epidemics caused by the H7N1 and H7N3 subtypes that circulated under
   similar epidemiological conditions, including the same domestic species
   reared in the same densely populated poultry area for similar periods of
   time.
   The two strains appear to have experienced largely divergent evolution:
   the H7N1 viruses evolved into a highly pathogenic form, while the H7N3
   did not. However, a more detailed molecular and evolutionary analysis
   revealed several common features: (i) the independent acquisition of 32
   identical mutations throughout the entire genome; (ii) the evolution and
   persistence of two sole genetic groups with similar genetic
   characteristics; (iii) a comparable pattern of amino acid variability of
   the HA proteins during the low pathogenic epidemics; and (iv) similar
   rates of nucleotide substitutions. These findings suggest that the
   evolutionary trajectories of viruses with the same virulence level
   circulating in analogous epidemiological conditions may be similar. In
   addition, our deep sequencing analysis of 15 samples revealed that 17 of
   the 32 parallel mutations were already present at the beginning of the
   two epidemics, suggesting that fixation of these mutations may occur
   with different mechanisms, which may depend on the fitness gain provided
   by each mutation. This highlighted the difficulties in predicting the
   acquisition of mutations that can be correlated to viral adaptation to
   specific epidemiological conditions or to changes in virus virulence.

Abstract = {{One of the recent trends in animal production is the revival of interest
   in organic farming. The increased consumer interest in organic animal
   farming is mainly due to concerns about animal welfare and the use of
   antibiotics in conventional farming. On the other hand, providing
   animals with a more natural lifestyle implies their increased exposure
   to environmental sources of different microorganisms including
   pathogens. To address these concerns, we determined the abundance of
   antibiotic resistance and diversity within fecal microbiota in pigs kept
   under conventional and organic farming systems in Sweden, Denmark,
   France and Italy. The abundance of sul1, sul2, strA, tet(A), tet(B) and
   cat antibiotic resistance genes was determined in 468 samples by
   real-time PCR and the fecal microbiota diversity was characterized in 48
   selected samples by pyrosequencing of V3/V4 regions of 16S rRNA.
   Contrary to our expectations, there were no extensive differences
   between the abundance of tested antibiotic resistance genes in
   microbiota originating from organic or conventionally housed pigs within
   individual countries. There were also no differences in the microbiota
   composition of organic and conventional pigs. The only significant
   difference was the difference in the abundance of antibiotic resistance
   genes in the samples from different countries. Fecal microbiota in the
   samples originating from southern European countries (Italy, France)
   exhibited significantly higher antibiotic resistance gene abundance than
   those from northern parts of Europe (Denmark, Sweden). Therefore, the
   geographical location of the herd influenced the antibiotic resistance
   in the fecal microbiota more than farm's status as organic or
   conventional.}},

Abstract = {{H5N1 avian influenza viruses remain a threat to public health mainly
   because they can cause severe infections in humans. These viruses are
   widespread in birds, and they vary in antigenicity forming three major
   clades and numerous antigenic variants. The most important features of
   the human monoclonal antibody FLD194 studied here are its broad
   specificity for all major clades of H5 influenza HAs, its high affinity,
   and its ability to block virus infection, in vitro and in vivo. As a
   consequence, this antibody may be suitable for anti-H5 therapy and as a
   component of stockpiles, together with other antiviral agents, for
   health authorities to use if an appropriate vaccine was not available.
   Our mutation and structural analyses indicate that the antibody
   recognizes a relatively conserved site near the membrane distal tip of
   HA, near to, but distinct from, the receptor-binding site. Our analyses
   also suggest that the mechanism of infectivity neutralization involves
   prevention of receptor recognition as a result of steric hindrance by
   the Fc part of the antibody. Structural analyses by EM indicate that
   three Fab fragments are bound to each HA trimer. The structure revealed
   by X-ray crystallography is of an HA monomer bound by one Fab. The
   monomer has some similarities to HA in the fusion pH conformation, and
   the monomer's formation, which results from the presence of isopropanol
   in the crystallization solvent, contributes to considerations of the
   process of change in conformation required formembrane fusion.}},

Title = {{Isolation of coagulase-positive staphylococci from bitches' colostrum
   and milk and genetic typing of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
   pseudintermedius strains}},
Journal = {{BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Background: Among the coagulase-positive, potentially pathogenic
   staphylococci, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius has been frequently
   isolated from bitches' milk. This organism colonizes the mammary gland
   or causes infection, while S. aureus has been only occasionally
   reported. The objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence
   and persistence of coagulase-positive staphylococci in the colostrum and
   milk of postpartum bitches, either treated or untreated with
   antimicrobials, and to assess the incidence, antibiotic resistance
   profile and genetic type of the methicillin-resistant strains.
   On postpartum D1, D7 and D15, drops of secretion were collected from the
   mammary glands of 27 postpartum bitches, nine of which were treated with
   antimicrobials. Coagulase-positive staphylococci were identified,
   antimicrobial susceptibility and the presence of mecA were tested and
   the genetic profile of methicillin-resistant strains was assessed.
   Results: Staphylococcus pseudintermedius was the only coagulase-positive
   staphylococcus isolated, and its presence was detected in 21 out of 27
   bitches and in 66 out of 145 swabs. In a single bitch, it caused
   puerperal mastitis. In untreated bitches, the frequency of isolation was
   lower in colostrum than in milk. All of the isolates except one were
   resistant to at least three antimicrobial classes, while 14 out of 66 S.
   pseudintermedius strains were methicillin-resistant mecA positive (MRSP)
   and were isolated from eight bitches housed in the same breeding kennel.
   A significant association was found between antimicrobial treatment and
   the presence of MRSP. Six of the 12 typed isolates belonged to spa-type
   t02 carrying SCCmec II/III, and another six were non-typeable with spa
   carrying SCCmec IV. The t02-SCCmec II/III isolates were sequence type
   (ST) 71; four NT-SCCmec IV isolates were ST258 and two were ST369. PFGE
   showed that isolates from the same dog had identical band patterns,
   while isolates from different dogs had unique band patterns. MRSP
   strains showed multidrug resistance profiles.
   Conclusions: Our results confirm that S. pseudintermedius is the most
   frequently isolated coagulase-positive staphylococcus from bitches'
   milk. The isolation of several different strains of MRSP with different
   genetic characteristics in the same kennel and the fact that two of the
   strains belonged to a sequence type (ST) described for the first time
   are noteworthy findings.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the ban by the European Union, anabolic steroids might still be
   illicitly employed in bovine meat production. The surveillance of misuse
   of such potentially harmful molecules is necessary to guarantee
   consumers' health. Analytical methods for drug residue control are based
   on LC-MS/MS, but their efficacy can be hindered due to undetectable
   residual concentrations as a result of low-dosage treatments. Screening
   methods based on the recognition of indirect biological effects of
   growth promoters' administration, such as the alteration of protein
   expression, can improve the efficacy of surveillance. The present study
   was aimed at identifying modifications in the muscle protein expression
   pattern between bulls treated with an ear implant (Revalor-XS (R))
   containing trenbolone acetate (200 mg) and estradiol (40 mg), and
   untreated animals. The analysis of skeletal muscle was carried out using
   a tandem mass tags shotgun proteomics approach. We defined 28 candidate
   protein markers with a significantly altered expression induced by
   steroids administration. A subset of 18 candidate markers was validated
   by SRM and allowed to build a predictive model based on partial least
   square discriminant analysis. Our findings confirm the effectiveness of
   the proteomics approach as potential tool to overcome analytical

Title = {{Epidemiological survey on bovine piroplasmoses in an area of Eastern

Journal = {{LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{107-114}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Introduction - Bovine Piroplasmoses are parasitic diseases caused by
   different species of Babesia and Theileria genera, with a paramount
   importance at global level and an emerging zoonotic potential. In
   northern Italy, piroplasmoses clinical cases and outbreaks are rare and
   therefore these diseases are scarcely investigated by researchers and
   poor attention is paid by veterinary practitioners. Nevertheless,
   outbreaks of piroplasmoses were reported in north-eastern Italy
   recently.
   Aim - The present study consists of an epidemiological survey, aimed to
   detect and describe the presence of different species of piroplasms, and
   to suggest hypotheses on potential risk factors, in a small mountainous
   area of north-eastern Italy, where the use of pasture is very common
   among bovine farmers.
   Materials and methods - Ticks were collected through dragging and
   investigated by means of bimolecular analysis for the presence of
   piroplasms, whereas blood samples were retrieved from 79 cattle and
   analysed with direct (blood smear and PCR) and indirect examinations
   (IFAT for Babesia bovis and B. bigemina; ELISA for B. divergens). A
   phylogenetic tree was constructed using sequences of samples positive to
   bio-molecular analysis and a risk factor analysis was performed by
   univariate approach.
   Results and discussion - One pool of nymphs, out of 12 analyzed pools
   (n=98 Ixodes ricinus ticks collected), resulted positive for B.
   venatorum (syn. Babesia EU1). Cattle showed high sero-prevalence values
   against B. bovis (43.0\%) and B. divergens (12.7\%), but only one animal
   resulted positive to B. bigemina. Totally, 10 animals were positive to
   PCR, all identified in the Theileria buffeli/sergenti/orientalis group.
   At phylogenetic analysis, some sequences were identical to isolates
   described as potentially pathogenetic in Australia. No clear indication
   was provided by risk factor analysis, even if farms using pasture with
   high tick density appear to be at major risk for some piroplasm species.
   Conclusions - Different piroplasm species are circulating in the study
   area, such as probably in many areas of the Alps. In order to obtain
   better information on the epidemiological features of circulating
   species, it is recommendable to perform a detailed ethiological
   investigation of possible new piroplasmoses outbreaks in the mountainous
   areas of northern Italy.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to describe the prevalence and risk factors of
   Clostridium difficile shedding in six farms belonging to two companies
   in Northern Italy. Four hundred and twenty veal calves, randomly
   selected and individually identified, were sampled three times: at 0-16,
   90-120, and 150 days after introduction. C difficile was isolated at
   least once from 87 out of the 420 calves (20.7\%). The prevalence of
   shedding was 20.24\% at the first sampling and dropped to 0.72\% at the
   second sampling. None of the samples obtained at 150 days tested
   positive. Sampling of cecal contents and carcass swabs at slaughter was
   stratified according to the herd of origin of the animals. C difficile
   was never isolated at slaughter, excluding a prevalence higher than
   3.5\% on the basis of previous investigations. Therefore, in this work,
   the veal calf could not be confirmed as a potential source of C.
   difficile for the consumer. Eight different ribotypes (RT) have been
   described, but the vast majority of the isolates (87.8\%) belonged to
   three ribotypes only: RT-078, RT-012 and RT-126, which are also among
   the most common of the ribotypes detected in humans in Europe. Most
   isolates, and all the RT-078 isolates, harbored genes coding for toxins
   A and B, the binary toxin, and showed a deletion in the gene encoding
   toxin C, suggesting that the veal calf was a reservoir for epidemic
   hyper-virulent strains. A correlation between age and shedding was
   found: the odds ratio (OR) ranged from 2.79 for 36-45 days of age to
   4.57 for 13-28 days of age. The presence of diarrhea at first sampling
   was significantly associated with the recovery of C difficile in feces
   (OR 3.26). A correlation was found between the administration of
   antimicrobials and shedding: an increased risk was shown when the number
   of antimicrobials used was higher than 4 (OR 4.02) or 5-6 (OR 5.83) or
   when polymyxin E or beta-lactams were administered. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Recombinant bovine somatotrophin (rbST) is widely used in some countries
   to increase milk production. Since 1994, both marketing and use of this
   substance have been prohibited within the European Union. In this
   context, the targeted plasma biochemical and hormonal profiling was
   assessed as a potential screening strategy to highlight rbST (ab)use in
   cattle. Twenty-one routinely measured clinical blood parameters,
   representative of main biological profiles (energetic, proteic, etc.),
   were measured in the plasma of six lactating cows before and after rbST
   treatment throughout a 23-day study period. Appropriate multivariate
   statistical analyses {[}principal component analysis (PCA) and
   orthogonal partial least square (OPLS)] enabled discriminating animal
   samples before and after treatment (days 0 vs. 2 to 9, P = 2.10(-9)) and
   highlighted the five most relevant blood parameters in this
   discrimination. Based on each five-analyte contribution, a simple
   mathematically weighted equation was suggested to predict the status of
   samples. A suspicious threshold was proposed, and the model was further
   tested with the status prediction of the supplementary samples from
   untreated (n = 20) and treated cows (n = 22). The calculated
   false-positive (10 \%) and false-negative (4.5 \%) rates were in
   accordance with the EU requirements for screening methods. Although the
   model needs to be further validated with additional samples, such
   targeted plasma biochemical and hormonal profiling already appears as a
   potential promising screening strategy to highlight rbST (ab)use in

Abstract = {{In the present study, the peripheral blood leukocyte phenotypes,
   lymphocyte subset populations, and oxidative stress parameters were
   studied in cognitively characterized adult and aged dogs, in order to
   assess possible relationships between age, cognitive decline, and the

   years) dogs underwent two testing procedures, for the assessment of
   spatial reversal learning and selective social attention abilities,
   which were shown to be sensitive to aging in pet dogs. Based on age and
   performance in cognitive testing, dogs were classified as adult not
   cognitively impaired (ADNI, N=12), aged not cognitively impaired (AGNI,
   N=19) and aged cognitively impaired (AGCI, N=10). Immunological and
   oxidative stress parameters were compared across groups with the
   Kruskal-Wallis test. AGCI dogs displayed lower absolute CD4 cell count

   (p<0.05) than AGNI whereas these parameters were not different between
   AGNI and ADNI. AGNI dogs had higher CD8 cell percentage than ADNI

Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{This study aims to analyse the elements which, according to Italian
   consumers, contribute most to defining the quality of a food product. A
   sample of 1000 consumers, in charge of purchases for the household, was
   interviewed by telephone. The data analysis has made it possible to
   categorise Italian consumers into two main groups: on the one hand those
   who mainly use criteria associated with organoleptic elements, and, on
   the other, those who make their choice based on place and methods of
   production. Both categories were studied with a view to identifying
   their distinctive socio-demographic and behavioural features.
   Geographical provenance, age, propensity to read the label on products,
   scientific knowledge and self-assessment of knowledge on food
   safety-related issues emerged as the main differences between the two
   groups. The perception of quality appears to affect purchase decisions
   and dietary patterns. The description of the consumer groups who use the
   same elements to define quality provided a useful insight into consumer
   choices and potential risk-exposure behaviours. The study of these
   aspects is therefore relevant for the purpose of designing effective and
   targeted communication actions, not only for companies but also for
   public institutions in charge of safeguarding public health. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Porcine circovirus type 2 is one of the most widespread and economically
   relevant infections of swine. Four genotypes have been recognized, but
   currently, only three (PCV2a, PCV2b and PCV2d) are effectively
   circulating. The widespread livestock trade and rapid viral evolution
   have contributed to determining the high heterogeneity of PCV2 and the
   dispersal of potentially more virulent strains. Italian swine farming
   and the related processing industry are relevant in the national
   economy. Despite the noteworthy losses associated with direct and
   control measure costs, no data are currently available on the molecular
   epidemiology of PCV2 in Italy. Our study, which was intended to fill
   this gap, considered 75 completed genome PCV2 sequences, which were
   obtained from samples collected from the highly densely populated area
   of Northern Italy between 2007 and 2014. Phylogenetic analysis and
   comparison with reference sequences demonstrated the co-circulation,
   with different prevalences, of PCV2a, PCV2b and PCV2d within the
   national borders, with PCV2b being the most prevalent. Recombination
   between different genotypes was also proven to be frequent.
   Phylogeographic analysis demonstrated that the marked variability of
   Italian PCV2 strains can be attributable to multiple introduction
   events. The comparison of the phylogenetic analysis results, the
   location of different haplotypes and the international commercial routs
   of live pigs allow the speculation of several links as well as the role
   of Italy as both an importer and exporter of PCV2 haplotypes, mainly
   from and to European and Asian countries. A similarly intricate contact
   network was demonstrated within national borders, with different
   haplotypes being detected in the same province and different provinces
   harbouring the same haplotype. Overall, this paper represents the first
   description of PCV2 in Italy and demonstrates that the high variability
   of circulating Italian strains is due to multiple introduction events,
   wide circulation within national boundaries and rapid viral evolution.

Abstract = {{The study of influenza type A (IA) infections in wild mammals
   populations is a critical gap in our knowledge of how IA viruses evolve
   in novel hosts that could be in close contact with avian reservoir
   species and other wild animals. The aim of this study was to evaluate
   the susceptibility to infection, the nasal shedding and the
   transmissibility of the H7N1 and H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza
   (HPAI) viruses in the bank vole (Myodes glareolus), a wild rodent common
   throughout Europe and Asia. Two out of 24 H5N1-infected voles displayed
   evident respiratory distress, while H7N1-infected voles remained
   asymptomatic. Viable virus was isolated from nasal washes collected from
   animals infected with both HPAI viruses, and extra-pulmonary infection
   was confirmed in both experimental groups. Histopathological lesions
   were evident in the respiratory tract of infected animals, although
   immunohistochemistry positivity was only detected in lungs and trachea
   of two H7N1-infected voles. Both HPAI viruses were transmitted by direct
   contact, and seroconversion was confirmed in 50\% and 12.5\% of the
   asymptomatic sentinels in the H7N1 and H5N1 groups, respectively.
   Interestingly, viable virus was isolated from lungs and nasal washes
   collected from contact sentinels of both groups. The present study
   demonstrated that two non-rodent adapted HPAI viruses caused
   asymptomatic infection in bank voles, which shed high amounts of the
   viruses and were able to infect contact voles. Further investigations
   are needed to determine whether bank voles could be involved as silent
   hosts in the transmission of HPAI viruses to other mammals and domestic
   poultry.}},

Abstract = {{The pronounced fragility that characterizes swine erythrocytes is likely
   to produce a variable degree of hemolysis during blood sampling, and the
   free hemoglobin may then unpredictably bias the quantification of
   several analytes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the degree of
   acceptability of values obtained for several biochemical parameters at
   different levels of hemolysis. Progressively increased degrees of
   physical hemolysis were induced in 3 aliquots of 30 nonhemolytic sera,
   and the relative effects on the test results were assessed. To define
   the level of hemolysis, we used both visual estimation (on a scale of 0
   to 3+) and analytical assessment (hemolytic index) and identified the
   best analytical cutoff values for discriminating the visual levels of
   hemolysis. Hemolysis led to a variable and dose-dependent effect on the
   test results that was specific for each analyte tested. In mildly
   hemolyzed specimens, C-reactive protein, haptoglobin, 1-globulin,
   2-globulin, 1-globulin, -globulin, sodium, calcium, and alkaline
   phosphatase were not significantly biased, whereas 2-globulin, albumin,

   and total protein were unbiased even in markedly hemolyzed samples.
   Analytical interference was hypothesized to be the main source of this
   bias, leading to a nonlinear trend that confirmed the difficulty in

Title = {{Clinical investigation on Theileria equi and Babesia caballi infections
   in Italian donkeys}},
Journal = {{BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{APR 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: Interest in the welfare and diseases of donkeys is
   constantly increasing in several countries. Despite this, clinical
   research into donkeys needs to be in continual development since they
   show different reactions compared to horses in many conditions,
   including infectious diseases, and need specific clinical and
   therapeutic approaches. No reports are currently available on clinical
   and clinical pathology data regarding donkeys with natural piroplasms
   infection.
   Results: Venous blood samples were taken from one hundred and thirty
   eight donkeys and underwent indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) to
   detect IgG antibodies against Theileria equi and Babesia caballi and
   real-time polimerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect Babesia spp. and
   Theileria spp. Clinical examinations, haematological analyses and serum
   bilirubin evaluation were also performed and compared with positive or
   negative status. A seroprevalence of 40.6\% and 47.8\% was found for T.
   equi and B. caballi, respectively; double positivity was detected in
   19.6\% of the animals. PCR results showed that 17.4\% of the animals
   tested positive for T. equi and 3.6\% for B. caballi with no double
   positivity. Twelve donkeys (8.7\%) had clinical signs consistent with
   chronic forms of the disease and no acute forms were detected.
   Fifty-eight donkeys had haematological and serum bilirubin alterations
   and 56 (96.6\%) of them were IFAT and/or PCR positive. Changes in
   erythrocyte number, packed cell volume, hemoglobin concentration, mean
   corpuscular hemoglobin, platelets number and total bilirubin were
   significantly associated with positive and symptomatic animals.
   Conclusion: Nonspecific clinical presentation seems to be very common in
   donkeys and several clinical pathology alterations persist after natural
   infection. Therefore, apparently healthy donkeys can have masked but
   severe clinical pathology alterations. Acute forms are very seldom
   observed in donkeys. Clinical monitoring of chronically infected donkeys
   is recommended since such animals represent a risk both for transmission
   to other animals and for their own health; furthermore, their production
   performances could be reduced. The study should also be intended as a
   contribution for veterinary practitioners because it describes the most
   usual clinical presentations and laboratory findings of equine
   piroplasmosis in naturally infected donkeys in endemic areas.}},

   Single isolates from 268 human sporadic cases and 325 veterinary

   different non-human sources were very close to those which were
   responsible for human infections, suggesting that source attribution by
   MLVA typing should be possible. However, using the Asymmetric Island
   Model it was not possible to obtain a confident ranking of sources
   responsible for human infections based on MLVA profiles. The source
   assignments provided by the model could have been jeopardized by the
   high heterogeneity found within each source and the negligible
   divergence between sources as well as by the limited source data

   feeding preference in a hotspot of virus emergence}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{APR 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Understanding wildlife disease ecology is becoming an urgent
   need due to the continuous emergence and spread of several wildlife
   zoonotic diseases. West Nile Virus (WNV) is the most widespread
   arthropod-borne virus in the world, and in recent decades there has been
   an increase both in geographic range, and in the frequency of
   symptomatic infections in humans and wildlife. The principal vector for
   WNV in Europe is the common house Culex pipiens mosquito, which feeds on
   a wide variety of vertebrate host species. Variation in mosquito feeding
   preference has been described as one of the most influential parameters
   driving intensity and timing of WNV infection in the United States, but
   feeding preferences for this species have been little studied in Europe.
   Methods: Here, we estimated feeding preference for wild Cx. pipiens in
   northern Italy, using molecular analysis to identify the origin of blood
   meals, and avian census to control host abundance variations.
   Additionally, we used host bird odour extracts to test experimentally
   mosquito preferences in the absence of environmental variations.
   Results: For the first time, we demonstrate a clear feeding preference
   for the common blackbird (Turdus merula), both for wild collected
   specimens and in the lab, suggesting a potential important role for this
   species in the WNV epidemiology in Europe. A seasonal decrease in
   abundance of blackbirds is associated with increased feeding on Eurasian
   magpies (Pica pica), and this may be linked to seasonal emergence of WNV
   in humans. Feeding preferences on blackbirds are more marked in rural
   areas, while preference for magpies is higher in peridomestic areas.
   Other species, such as the house sparrow (Passer domesticus) appear to
   be selected by mosquitoes opportunistically in relation to its
   abundance.
   Conclusions: Our findings provide new insights into the ecology of Cx.
   pipiens in Europe and may give useful indications in terms of
   implementing targeted WNV surveillance plans. However, a clearer
   understanding of spatio-temporal variations of Cx. pipiens feeding
   preferences, and targeted studies on reservoir competence for WNV for
   these species are therefore now urgently needed as this is essential to
   describe disease dynamics and quantify virus transmission risk.}},

   technology represents a strategic approach used to achieve highly
   reliable and specific diagnostic tests in veterinary diseases control:
   in particular this aspect is crucial for confirming mycoplasma infection
   and for maintaining mycoplasma-free breeder flocks. In this study, we
   identified a component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase dihydrolipoamide
   acetyltransferase (i.e., E2) protein by 2-dimensional electrophoresis
   (2-DE), characterized it in immunoblotting assays, and analyzed its
   recombinant (r-E2) in a rec-ELISA test. For full-length protein
   expression in Escherichia coli (EC) a point mutation was introduced. A
   rabbit antiserum produced against r-E2 was tested in a Western Blot
   using different samples of Mycoplasma species. The results showed the
   applicability of site-directed mutagenesis, with a good yield of the
   r-E2 after purification. Also, anti-E2 serum reacted with all the tested
   MG strains showing no cross reaction with other mycoplasmas. The

Abstract = {{We report the development of real-time PCR assays for genotyping
   Clostridium botulinum group III targeting the newly defined C. novyi
   sensu lato group; the nontoxic nonhemagglutinin (NTNH)-encoding gene
   ntnh; the botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT)-encoding genes bont/C, bont/C/D,
   bont/D, and bont/D/C; and the flagellin (fliC) gene. The genetic
   diversity of fliC among Clostridium botulinum group III strains resulted
   in the definition of five major subgroups named fliC-I to fliC-V.
   Investigation of fliC subtypes in 560 samples, with various European
   origins, showed that fliC-I was predominant and found exclusively in
   samples contaminated by Clostridium botulinum type C/D, fliC-II was
   rarely detected, no sample was recorded as fliC-III or fliC-V, and only
   Clostridium botulinum type D/C samples tested positive for fliC-IV. The
   lack of genetic diversity of the flagellin gene of Clostridium botulinum
   type C/D would support a clonal spread of type C/D strains in different
   geographical areas. fliC-I to fliC-III are genetically related (87\% to
   92\% sequence identity), whereas fliC-IV from Clostridium botulinum type
   D/C is more genetically distant from the other fliC types (with only
   50\% sequence identity). These findings suggest fliC-I to fliC-III have
   evolved in a common environment and support a different genetic
   evolution for fliC-IV. A combination of the C. novyi sensu lato, ntnh,
   bont, and fliC PCR assays developed in this study allowed better
   characterization of Clostridium botulinum group III and showed the group
   to be less genetically diverse than Clostridium botulinum groups I and
   II, supporting a slow genetic evolution of the strains belonging to
   Clostridium botulinum group III.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, heavy metal levels detected in molluscs produced in the
   Veneto Region (north-western Adriatic Sea) are presented and discussed.
   A descriptive analysis was conducted on data collected in the framework
   of official monitoring activities in shellfish production areas between
   2007 and 2012. Concentrations of lead (Pb), mercury (Hg) and cadmium
   (Cd) in about 2000 samples of 17 different species of marine bivalve
   molluscs, echinoderms and gastropods were checked by means of atomic
   absorption spectrometry. Hg and Pb concentrations were always below the
   maximum levels set by the European legislation; 2.2\% of the analysed
   samples exceeded the threshold level for Cd, 86.7\% of witch belonging
   to purple dye murex (Bolinus brandaris). The highest mean levels of Hg
   and Cd were found in purple dye murex, with 0.10 mg kg(-1) and 0.88 mg
   kg(-1) respectively, while rayed trough shell (Mactra stultorum) and
   truncate donax (Donax trunculus) were the species with the highest mean
   value of Pb (0.25 mg kg-1). Species of major consumption showed mean
   values almost ten times lower than the limits set by the European
   legislation (Manila clam: Pb: 0.20 mg kg(-1); Hg: 0.04 mg kg(-1); Cd:
   0.07 mg kg(-1); Mediterranean mussel: Pb: 0.22 mg kg(-1); Hg: 0.03 mg
   kg(-1); Cd: 0.13 mg kg(-1)). A preliminary evaluation of the impact on
   human health of shellfish according to the detected levels indicates
   that the species of major consumption are safe for the average
   consumers, although a potential risk cannot be ruled out for vulnerable
   groups, such as women of childbearing potential and children, as well as
   for regular or high-level shellfish consumers, particularly those who
   frequently eat species such as murex. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Legislation introduced under European Commission Regulation (EC) n
   degrees 2073/2005 and later amendments (Reg. 1441/2007/EC, Reg.
   365/2010/EC, Reg. 1089/2011/EC, Reg. 209/2013/EC) mandates that food
   business operators carry out microbiological analyses on meat carcass
   surfaces after slaughter procedures as part of hygiene monitoring of
   production. Besides setting forth general rules for sampling and sample
   preparation, Regulation EC 2073/2005 requires that operators comply with
   ISO 17604, which lists destructive and non-destructive sampling methods,
   selection of sampling sites, and rules for sample storage and transport.
   This study compares the effectiveness of destructive (excision) and
   non-destructive (sponge and wet-dry swabbing) methods for the recovery
   of total viable count (TVC) and Enterobacteriaceae on carcass surfaces.
   To do this, we pooled samples collected from carcasses of four animal
   species (cattle, n = 120; pigs, n = 130; horses, n = 84; and small
   ruminants {[}sheep and goats], n = 121). TVC and Enterobacteriaceae were
   enumerated and compared for each sampling method. Microbiological
   analyses were performed according to ISO 4833:2003 for TVC and ISO
   21528:2004 for Enterobacteriaceae. The effectiveness of the sampling
   methods was analyzed by comparing the differences between the median of
   colony forming units per square centimeter (CFU/cm(2)) for TVC and
   Enterobacteriaceae recovered by each method. Non-parametric analysis of
   variance for repeated measures was applied for each species separately.
   Excision was the most effective method. The relationship between the CFU
   recovered by swabbing, by sponge, and by excision, for all species, was
   generally better than 1:5. This is in contrast with the Italian Ministry
   of Health Memorandum (23 December 2002), which states that
   non-destructive methods recover 20\% of the destructive method. (C) 2014

   koreicus, a new invasive species for Europe}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{MAR 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Over the recent decades, container-breeding mosquito species
   belonging to the genus Aedes have frequently been recorded far from
   their place of origin. Aedes koreicus was first reported in
   north-eastern Italy in 2011, in a region endemic for Dirofilaria
   immitis, the agent of canine heartworm disease. The vector competence of
   Ae. koreicus for D. immitis was here tested under laboratory conditions,
   by infecting mosquitoes with a local strain of D. immitis.
   Methods: Blood containing 3000 microfilariae/ml was offered to 54
   mosquitoes (T group) while 29 were left as a control (C group).
   Mosquitoes killed at scheduled days post infection (dpi) and naturally
   dead were divided in head, thorax and abdomen and examined for D.
   immitis larval stages by dissection under a microscope and molecularly.
   Results: Of the 45 engorged mosquitoes in T, 32 (71.1\%) scored positive
   for D. immitis larval stages. L3 were found as early as 8 dpi in the
   Malpighian tubules and then in the thorax, salivary glands, palp and
   proboscis. At the end of the study a total of 18 mosquitoes developed L3
   giving an estimated infection rate at 12 dpi of 68.2\% and a vector
   efficiency index of 25.2\%. The rate of mortality in T group within the
   first 9 days post infection was significantly higher in T group (47.6\%)
   than in C group (8.3\%) (p < 0.01). The concordance between microscopy
   and PCR was high (0.8-0.9), however, a positivity for D. immitis in the
   head was found molecularly at 13 dpi, three days before microscopy.
   Conclusions: Aedes koreicus, a new invasive species for Europe, is most
   likely a competent vector of D. immitis being of potential relevance in
   the natural cycle of the parasite. This poses a new threat for animal
   and human health in endemic areas for dirofilariosis and enhances the
   risk of spreading the infection in previously non-endemic areas. These
   results stress the importance of active surveillance and control
   strategies to minimize the risk of introduction of invasive alien
   species.}},

Abstract = {{The burden of food-borne diseases still represents a threat to public
   health; in 2012, the domestic setting accounted for 57.6\% of
   strong-evidence EU food-borne Salmonella outbreaks. Next to
   cross-contamination, inadequate cooking procedure is considered as one
   of the most important factors contributing to food-borne illness. The
   few studies which have assessed the effect of domestic cooking on the
   presence and numbers of pathogens in different types of meat have shown
   that consumer-style cooking methods can allow bacteria to survive and
   that the probability of eating home-cooked poultry meat that still
   contains surviving bacteria after heating is higher than previously
   assumed. Thus, the main purpose of this study was to reproduce and
   assess the effect of several types of cooking treatments (according to
   label instructions and not following label instructions) on the presence
   and numbers of Salmonella Typhimurium DT 104 artificially inoculated in
   five types of poultry-based meat preparations (burgers, sausages,
   ready-to-cook-kebabs, quail roulades and extruded roulades) that are
   likely to be contaminated by Salmonella. Three contamination levels (10
   cfu/g; 100 cfu/g and 1000 cfu/g) and three cooking techniques (grilling,
   frying and baking) were applied.
   Cooking treatments performed according to label instructions eliminated
   Salmonella Typhimurium (absence per 25 g) for contamination levels of 10
   and 100 cfu/g but not for contamination levels of 1000 cfu/g. After
   improper cooking, 26 out of 78 samples were Salmonella-positive, and 23
   out of these 26 samples were artificially contaminated with bacterial
   loads between 100 and 1000 cfu/g. Nine out of 26 samples provided
   quantifiable results with a minimum level of 1.4 MPN/g in kebabs
   (initial inoculum level: 100 cfu/g) after grilling and a maximum level
   of 170 MPN/g recorded in sausages (initial inoculum level: 1000 cfu/g)
   after grilling. Kebabs were the most common Salmonella-positive meat
   product after cooking, followed by sausages, burgers and extruded
   roulades; in relation to the type of cooking treatment applied,
   Salmonella Typhimurium was detected mostly after frying.
   Thus, following label instructions mostly, but not always, produced safe
   cooked poultry-based meat preparations, while the application of
   inadequate cooking treatments was not able to assure complete
   elimination of Salmonella from the products even with a low
   contamination level (10 cfu/g). Consequently, there is a need to develop
   guidelines for producers and consumers and promote a multidisciplinary
   educational campaign in order to provide information on safe cooking and
   time-temperature combinations able to maintain the organoleptic
   qualities of meat. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Animal-assisted interventions (AAIs) with dogs are becoming popular
   worldwide, but there is a lack of scientific data on dog selection
   procedures, which prevents the organizations involved from adopting a
   uniform assessment method. In the absence of legal regulations and
   common guidelines, dogs currently engage in diverse activities, some of
   which may pose more of a concern for their welfare than others. The
   present study sought to standardize and validate a selection protocol of
   dogs involved in AAIs and to make it available to interested Italian
   institutions. To meet this aim, we enrolled dogs already working in AAIs
   and qualified by their handlers as fully suitable (N = 20) or suitable
   with reserve (N = 20) and nonworker pet dogs (N = 20) in this study.
   Each dog underwent a behavioral examination followed by role-playing,
   simulating an AAI session, presenting various conditions, and unexpected
   stimuli possibly occurring in AAIs. In both procedures, blinded experts
   judged the suitability of dogs evaluating controllability, reliability,
   and predictability of their social behavior and considering possible
   concerns regarding safety or welfare of patients and of the dogs
   themselves. Concurrent validity between procedures was fair, whereas
   reasons for dogs' allocation resulted in moderate accordance for dogs
   being aggressive, fearful, or avoidant of an unknown person. Moreover,
   dogs judged suitable, suitable with reserve, or not suitable by the
   experts significantly differed for the relative duration of negative
   interactions with unknown person, fear, and aggressiveness expressed in
   the role-playing. Differences in the ability to cope with stressful
   situations possibly occurring in AAIs were unnoticeable with the present
   protocol, and stress signals shown by dogs during the role-playing were
   judged by the experts or by the handlers not to differ between dogs.
   Given our results, the present protocol could be easily and properly
   adopted to identify dogs' behavioral prerequisites for AAIs. For the
   procedure to work properly, each dyad (dog and handler) should undergo
   behavioral examination and role-playing simulation in sequence. (C) 2015

   was developed and applied to the characterization of 137 M. bovis
   isolates from diverse geographical origins, obtained from healthy or
   clinically infected cattle. After in silico analysis, a final set of 7
   housekeeping genes was selected (dnaA, metS, recA, tufA, atpA, rpoD, and
   tkt). MLST analysis demonstrated the presence of 35 different sequence
   types (STs) distributed in two main clonal complexes (CCs), defined at
   the double-locus variant level, namely, CC1, which included most of the
   British and German isolates, and CC2, which was a more heterogeneous and
   geographically distant group of isolates, including European, Asian, and
   Australian samples. Index of association analysis confirmed the clonal

Abstract = {{Consumption of raw or insufficiently cooked mussels contaminated with
   hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a major cause of infection to humans. The
   origin of mussels commonly used for the preparation of marinated seafood
   salads is often unknown, since different producers worldwide undergo a
   precooking treatment at the original collection site with methods and
   parameters not always indicated. These treatments could be insufficient
   for the inactivation of HAV, which is characterized by a high
   temperature resistance. Both high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) and
   marinade treatments have been shown to affect HAV vitality. In this
   study, two treatments (HHP and marinating) were combined in order to
   assess a potential synergistic effect on the virus vitality. A kinetic
   test was conducted by subjecting the experimentally-contaminated mussels
   (HAV titre: 10(6)/ml TCID50) to marinating, and to different HHP
   treatment (4,000; 5,000; and 6,000 bar for 1, 5, and 9 min). Virus
   post-treatment vitality was assessed by its ability to grow on cell
   cultures and by quantitative real-time RT-PCR to evaluate virus
   resistance under such conditions. Marinating treatment alone (final pH
   4.3, and NaCl 2 \%) did not inactivate the virus. On the other hand, the
   use of HHP treatment alone on non-marinated HAV-contaminated mussels was
   effective only above 5,000 bar for 5 min. The results of the present
   study elucidate the synergistic effect of a combination between
   marination and HHP treatments on the inactivation of the virus.}},

Abstract = {{This study was performed to investigate the effect of tail docking in
   the weaner and finishing phase in 448 heavy pigs (slaughtered at 40
   weeks of age and 170 kg) reared under challenging conditions that were
   previously considered as risk factors for tail biting (e.g., male
   gender, high stocking density, fully slatted floor and poor health). The
   finishing unit had a history of mortality higher than 5\%, mainly due to
   Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome, Influenza and
   Actinobacillus pleuroptteumoniae circulation. In both units, a rack with
   straw and a metal chain were constantly available in all pens. A 2 x 2
   factorial design was adopted to test the effects of gender and tail
   presence on blood measures (cortisol, haptoglobin, and albumin/globulin
   ratio), behaviour and skin lesions. Tail docking did not have an effect
   on the physiological measures, conflicts, and ear and tail biting
   behaviours at the weaner phase or at fattening. However, in the last
   days of the weaner phase, an outbreak of tail biting triggered by a
   ``biter{''} was recorded in one pen of barrows. At fattening, tail
   docking did not produce any significant difference regarding skin
   lesions on the ears, the front, the middle and the back third of the
   animals. Nevertheless, undocked animals showed a higher prevalence of
   mild tail lesions (P < 0.01) and a lower frequency of belly nosing
   behaviour (P=0.04). In undocked animals, the average frequency of severe
   tail lesions was 3.6\%, whereas the average frequency of mild tail
   lesions was 18.57\%. Two peaks were detected at 12 and 32 weeks of age
   (P=0.01), i.e., at the beginning and in the middle of the fattening
   period. Overall, the behavioural activities of exploring chain decreased
   throughout the fattening cycle (P=0.02), whereas the activity of
   exploring straw in the rack increased according to age (P=0.05). The
   frequency of ear biting showed a decrease (P=0.02), whereas the
   frequency of lying behaviour increased (P=0.04). The mortality was
   approximately 5\%: 4.5\% in undocked vs. 5.5\% in docked pigs; 6.5\% in
   barrows vs. 3.5\% in females. The straw consumption was 5 g/pig/day at
   the weaner phase and 30 g/pig/day at fattening. The results did not
   demonstrate a generalised welfare endangerment directly related to tail
   biting in undociced heavy pigs housed under challenging conditions. (C)

Title = {{Evaluation of plasma level of some mineral elements in French beef

Journal = {{LARGE ANIMAL REVIEW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{3-11}},

Abstract = {{Introduction - Mineral elements are considered essential for the normal
   function of several biochemical pathways. In cattle, mineral
   deficiencies can occur but rarely they are associated to clinical
   disease even if it can affect the host immunity system as well as some
   production parameters.
   Aim - The aim of this study was to evaluate plasma levels of some
   mineral elements in French beef cattle (Charolaise and Limousine) on
   arrival in Italian fattening farms.
   Materials and methods - Blood samples (lithium heparin) were collected
   by coccigea venipuncture in 167 Charolaise beef and 147 Limousine. These
   samples were submitted for several analysis such as PCV in micro
   hematocrit tubes, analyses for glutathione peroxidases (GPx) with Ransel
   Randox (R) test and quantification of plasmatic concentrations of
   calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, zinc and copper with Roche
   Diagnostics (R) test. Moreover the same analysis were repeated only in
   19 Charolaise animals before their delivery to the slaughterhouse.
   Results and discussion - The analysis of PCV revealed that 95\% of
   animal presented normal physiologic hematocrit demonstrating proper
   hydration level after transport. Plasmas analysis revealed normal levels
   of macro-minerals whereas micro-elements pointed out sub-deficiencies or
   deficiency states for all the trace elements tested. The cattle of both
   breed that have physiologic mineral status were 89\% for calcium, 97\%
   for phosphorus, 98\% for magnesium, 35\% for iron, 60\% for zinc, 17\%
   for copper and 30\% for GpX. Lower levels of iron, copper and zinc were
   demonstrated in Charolaise breed if compared with the Limousine animals.
   Basing on our data this discrepancy seemed to be more related to the
   geographical origin of animals (French district) than to the animal
   breed (Charolaise or Limousine). The analysis repeated at the end of the
   fattening in 19 Charolaise animals revealed normal levels of both
   macro-and micro-elements with the exception of copper, showing an
   improvement of the general mineral status of beef cattle during the
   Italian rearing.
   Conclusion - Basing on our results macro and micro-mineral
   sub-deficiency/deficiency were observed in imported cattle on arrival in
   Italian farms. In particular the specific trace-minerals sub-deficiency
   seemed to be correlated to the geographical French area. Further studies
   should be recommended to confirm this preliminary results and it could
   useful to plan a feeding strategy (mineral integrated diet-challenge) to
   correct rapidly this mineral sub-deficiency in beef cattle after arrival
   in the fattening farms.}},

Abstract = {{The use of anabolic agents in meat producing animals is forbidden in
   Europe since 1988. Nevertheless, the possibility of widespread abuse of
   hormonal substances still exists, mainly due to economical benefits. The
   use of ``omics{''} approach is a promising strategy to highlight
   anabolic hormone abuse by indirectly detecting their physiological
   action. In this context, the aim of this work was to set up a liquid
   chromatography - high resolution mass spectrometry based metabolomics
   workflow for the screening of a combined trenbolone acetate/estradiol
   implant abuse in cattle urine. Therefore, an untargeted metabolomics
   approach combining the information provided by reverse-phase liquid
   chromatography and hydrophilic interaction chromatography both coupled
   to high resolution mass spectrometry was developed and applied to
   characterize and compare cattle urinary metabolic profiles from
   non-implanted and implanted animals. The combination of both separation
   modes improved the metabolite information richness. Discrimination
   between treated and untreated animals was observed by application of
   multivariate statistical analysis. Moreover, OPLS models permitted to
   highlight the candidate biomarkers appearing as the ions which
   contribute the most in the observed discrimination. From the results
   obtained, metabolomics approaches can be considered as a powerful
   strategy for the detection of fraudulent anabolic treatments in cattle
   since global urinary metabolic response provides helpful discrimination.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies suggest animals, in particular farm and companion
   animals, as possible reservoir for Clostridium difficile human
   pathogenic strains. The aim of this study was to give a first
   characterization of C. difficile isolates from Italian swine and dogs.
   In total, 10 different PCR-ribotypes were identified among porcine
   strains and six among canine strains. The predominant type found among
   porcine strains was 078 (50\%), whereas the most frequently detected
   among canine strains was the non-toxinogenic 010 (64\%). Considering the
   CLSI breakpoints, 60\% of porcine isolates was resistant to ERY, 35\% to
   MXF, 15\% to CLI, 5\% to RIF, and none to MTZ or VAN. Among dogs, 51\%
   of strains was resistant to CLI, 46\% to ERY, 21\% to MTZ and 5\% to MXF
   or RIF, and none to VAN. Five porcine strains (10\%) and 9 canine
   isolates (41\%) were MDR. Interestingly, 8 MDR canine strains were
   highly resistant to MTZ, with MICs >= 32 mg/L Considering the EUCAST
   cut-off for MTZ (MIC >2 mg/L), 13 canine isolates and one porcine strain
   were found with reduced susceptibility to MTZ (MICs ranging from 3 to >=
   256 mg/L). Swine and canine strains showing resistance or reduced
   susceptibility to MTZ belonged to PCR-ribotype 010 and 078. These
   PCR-ribotypes have been associated to reduced susceptibility to MTZ also
   in human, suggesting a potential risk for the emergence of C. difficile
   strains resistant to the current first-line antibiotic for CDI
   treatment. The agar incorporation method (AIM) was confirmed as the best
   method to detect C. difficile strains with this phenotype also after
   strains manipulations. The results obtained add further evidences about
   the possible role of animals as source of MDR C. difficile strains and
   reservoir of antibiotic resistance determinants. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Sequence-based genotyping was recently used to distinguish between the
   BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 species of the bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV).
   Quite recently, a new putative species, BVDV-3, was also detected. The
   phylogenetic analysis of the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) and Npro
   region has revealed at least 17 distinct subtypes for BVDV-1 to date.
   The aim of this study was to further investigate the genetic
   heterogeneity of BVDV-1 in Italy, by analysing 173 virus sequences from
   isolates collected over an 18-year period (1997-2014). Viral RNA was
   extracted from the original biological samples identified as
   BVDV-1-positive. Reverse transcription (RT) and polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) assays targeting a 288-base pair (bp) region of the
   5'-UTR and a 428-bp region encoding the autoprotease Npro were
   performed, and the RT-PCR products were sequenced. The phylogenetic
   analysis of the 5'-UTR and Npro sequences re-confirmed the circulation
   of ten out of eleven subtypes previously discovered in Italy.
   Interestingly, four isolates differed significantly from all of the
   bovine pestiviruses identified so far, thereby providing evidence for
   the circulation of three novel subtypes that have not been documented so
   far. The growing number of reports on BVDV-1 heterogeneity, including
   the recent findings reported herein, raises concern related to the
   emergence and spread of new BVDV variants, with possible implications
   for animal health and disease control. This global issue needs to be
   addressed with the highest priority.}},

Abstract = {{The Pseudomonas fluorescens group comprises several closely related
   species that are involved in food contamination and spoilage.
   Specifically, the interest in P. fluorescens as a spoiler of dairy
   products increased after the cases of ``blue mozzarella{''} that
   occurred in Italy in 2010.
   A Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) scheme was developed and applied to
   characterise 136 isolates (reference strains and food borne isolates) at
   strain level, to reveal the genetic relationships among them and to
   disclose any possible genetic clustering of phenotypic markers involved
   in food spoilage (protease, lipase, lecithinase activities and pigmented
   or fluorescent molecule production). The production of dark blue
   diffusible pigment was evaluated on several bacterial culture media and
   directly on mozzarella cheese.
   The MLST scheme provided precise genotyping at the strain level, and the
   population analyses of the concatenated sequences allowed major taxa to
   be defined. This approach was revealed to be suitable for tracking the
   strains according to their origin, such as dairy plants or food
   matrices. The genetic analysis revealed the presence of a connection
   between the blue pigment production and a specific phylogenetic cluster.
   The development of the online database specific to the P. fluorescens

Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: The invasive Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus has
   dramatically expanded its distribution range, being catalogued as one of
   the world's 100 worst invasive alien species. As vectors of pathogens,
   Ae. albopictus may create novel epidemiological scenarios in the invaded
   areas.
   Methods: Here, the frequency of encounters of Ae. albopictus with the
   avian malaria parasite Plasmodium and the related Haemoproteus was
   studied in an area with established populations in northeastern Italy
   and compared with those from four native mosquito species, Anopheles
   maculipennis s. l., Culex hortensis, Culex pipiens, and Ochlerotatus
   caspius. The abdomens of mosquitoes with a recent blood meal were used
   to identify both the blood meal source and the parasites harboured.
   Results: Aedes albopictus had a clear antropophilic behaviour while An.
   maculipennis and Oc. caspius fed mainly on non-human mammals. Birds were
   the most common hosts of Cx. pipiens and reptiles of Cx. hortensis.
   Parasites were isolated from three mosquito species, with Cx. pipiens
   (30\%) showing the highest parasite prevalence followed by Cx. hortensis
   (9\%) and Ae. albopictus (5\%).
   Conclusions: These results are the first identifying the avian malaria
   parasites harboured by mosquitoes in Italy and represent the first
   evidence supporting that, although Ae. albopictus could be involved in
   the transmission of avian malaria parasites, the risk of avian malaria
   parasite spread by this invasive mosquito in Europe would be minimal.}},

   foulbrood (AFB), a widespread and severe bacterial brood disease of
   honey bees. The genomic characterization of P. larvae strains by
   enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-polymerase chain
   reaction (ERIC-PCR) is able to differentiate four genotypes (ERIC I,
   ERIC II, ERIC III, ERIC IV). The information on the presence of P.
   larvae ERIC genotypes worldwide is few.
   Objectives: We have characterized P. larvae strains isolated in Italy
   from AFB outbreaks to obtain information on ERIC genotypes and
   phenotypes of the strains circulating in the country.
   Methods: A total of 117 P. larvae isolates from 115 AFB outbreaks
   occurring in 2008-2012 were subjected to phenotypic and genetic
   characterization.
   Results: The genomic characterization allowed the identification of ERIC
   I and ERIC II genotypes. Examining the data of Northern and Central
   Italy separately it was noted that in Northern Italy most outbreaks were
   caused by the ERIC I genotype (78.6\%), followed by the ERIC II genotype
   (18.6\%) and by co-infections (ERIC I + ERIC II) (2.6\%). In Central
   Italy, only outbreaks caused by the ERIC I genotype were observed. With
   regard to phenotypic characteristics all examined strains of ERIC II
   genotype fermented fructose while no strains of ERIC I genotype
   possessed this ability.
   Conclusion: Both P. larvae ERIC I and ERIC II genotypes were isolated
   from the AFB outbreaks, but ERIC II genotype was isolated only in
   Northern Italy. The fermentation of fructose seems to be a
   genotype-specific biochemical marker.}},

   every industrial sector. The production of food of animal origin
   recognizes several possibilities for technological development through

Abstract = {{Studies carried out during an Italian outbreak of the Thousand Cankers
   Disease of walnut, demonstrated that non-coalescing cankers on host

   incompatible strains of Geosmithia morbida. Confirmation of the
   vegetative incompatibility of paired fungal isolates, randomly collected
   from black walnuts, was obtained from observations of a clear separation
   zones and the absence of anastomoses. Pairing tests with two
   incompatible monoconidial strains indicated differences in morphology
   and growth rates. Electron microscopy revealed the presence of
   icosahedral mycovirus-like particles in one of the monoconidial strains
   that demonstrated low degrees of virulence in planta compared with a
   particle-free monoconidial strain. The occurrence of a vegetative
   incompatibility system in recently introduced populations of G. morbida

Abstract = {{Subclinical mastitis in dairy cows is a big economic loss for farmers.
   The monitoring of subclinical mastitis is usually performed through
   Somatic Cell Count (SCC) in farm but there is the need of new diagnostic
   systems able to quickly identify cows affected by subclinical infections
   of the udder. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential
   application of thermographic imaging compared to SCC and bacteriological
   culture for infection detection in cow affected by subclinical mastitis
   and possibly to discriminate between different pathogens. In this study
   we evaluated the udder health status of 98 Holstein Friesian dairy cows
   with high SCC in 4 farms. From each cow a sample of milk was collected
   from all the functional quarters and submitted to bacteriological
   culture, SCC and Mycoplasma spp. culture. A thermographic image was
   taken from each functional udder quarter and nipple. Pearson's
   correlations and Analysis of Variance were performed in order to
   evaluate the different diagnostic techniques. The most frequent pathogen
   isolated was Staphylococcus aureus followed by Coagulase Negative
   Staphylococci (CNS), Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus agalactiae and
   others. The Somatic Cell Score (SCS) was able to discriminate (p<0.05)
   cows positive for a pathogen from cows negative at the bacteriological
   culture except for cows with infection caused by CNS. Infrared
   thermography was correlated to SCS (p<0.05) but was not able to
   discriminate between positive and negative cows. Thermographic imaging
   seems to be promising in evaluating the inflammation status of cows
   affected by subclinical mastitis but seems to have a poor diagnostic
   value.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of pre-partum versus
   post-partum periods on the biochemical profile in dairy cows. The effect
   of glucose tolerance test (GTT) on glucose (Glu(on-farm)) and
   beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHBon-farm) levels was also assessed. 42 Holstein
   cows from two different farms (farm A and farm B) were enrolled in the
   study. Body Condition Score (BCS) was determined for both groups. The
   GTT was carried out 7 +/- 5 days pre-partum and 7 +/- 5 days
   post-partum. In both periods blood samples were taken at T0 (pre-glucose
   administration), at T10 and T80 (10 and 80 minutes post-glucose
   administration). All samples were analysed for total protein, albumin,
   globulin, glucose, urea, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine
   aminotransferase (ALT), calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), sodium (Na),
   chloride (Cl), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg) and BHBon-farm. Two-way
   ANOVA was applied to determine significant effects of the transition
   period (pre-partum vs. post-partum) and farm (A vs. B) on the studied
   parameters as well as the effect of time before and after the GTT on
   Glu(on-farm). The average values of BCS, glucose, urea, Ca, Cl and K are
   significantly lower in the post-partum when compared to the pre-partum
   period (P<0.05). The increase in AST concentrations during the
   post-partum period (P<0.05) is considered a suitable indicator of
   hepatic steatosis. The glucose tended to increase significantly at T10
   (P<0.05) and returned to pre-infusion concentrations at T80. These
   results confirm that the transition period is an important metabolic
   challenge to high-yielding dairy cows. Therefore, this study provides
   useful information in order to prevent the outset of nutritional
   imbalance that typically occurs in high production dairy cows.}},

Abstract = {{The seasonal and daily activity of mosquito vectors of pathogens

   May until the beginning of July and then decreased, disappearing at the
   beginning of October. The diel host-seeking patterns and oviposition
   site-seeking patterns were species specific and were differentially

Abstract = {{The knowledge of the size and demographic structure of animal
   populations is a necessary prerequisite for any population-based
   epidemiological study, especially to ascertain and interpret prevalence
   data, to implement surveillance plans in controlling zoonotic diseases
   and, moreover, to provide accurate estimates of tumours incidence data
   obtained by population-based registries. The main purpose of this study
   was to provide an accurate estimate of the size and structure of the
   canine population in Veneto region (north-eastern Italy), using the
   Lincoln-Petersen version of the capture-recapture methodology. The
   Regional Canine Demographic Registry (BAC) and a sample survey of
   households of Veneto Region were the capture and recapture sources,
   respectively. The secondary purpose was to estimate the size and
   structure of the feline population in the same region, using the same
   survey applied for dog population. A sample of 2465 randomly selected
   households was drawn and submitted to a questionnaire using the CATI
   technique, in order to obtain information about the ownership of dogs
   and cats. If the dog was declared to be identified, owner's information
   was used to recapture the dog in the BAC. The study was conducted in
   Veneto Region during 2011, when the dog population recorded in the BAC
   was 605,537. Overall, 616 households declared to possess at least one
   dog (25\%), with a total of 805 dogs and an average per household of
   1.3. The capture-recapture analysis showed that 574 dogs (71.3\%, 95\%
   CI: 68.04-74.40\%) had been recaptured in both sources, providing a dog
   population estimate of 849,229(95\% CI: 814,747-889,394), 40\% higher
   than that registered in the BAC. Concerning cats, 455 of 2465 (18\%,
   95\% CI: 17-20\%) households declared to possess at least one cat at the
   time of the telephone interview, with a total of 816 cats. The mean
   number of cats per household was equal to 1.8, providing an estimate of
   the cat population in Veneto region equal to 663,433 (95\% CI:
   626,585-737,159). The estimate of the size and structure of owned canine

Abstract = {{The detection of betanodavirus genomic components is a major issue for
   diagnostics and control of viral nervous necrosis (VNN), a devastating
   disease affecting fish worldwide. Despite a number of published
   molecular-based tests, most of them targeting the RNA2 molecule of the
   virus, diagnostics is still a challenge due to the high genetic
   diversity within this genus. In the present study, a new one-step
   real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR), targeting RNA1 of most genotypes of
   betanodaviruses, was proposed and validated. The test detected
   successfully various isolates of betanodavirus representatives of the
   four species RGNNV, SJNNV, TPNNV and BFNNV, either produced on cell
   culture or from clinical samples. It was specific as shown by the
   absence of signal on samples from healthy sea bass or from field samples
   of six other fish species without clinical signs of VNN. The assay
   detected reliably 50-100 copies of plasmids containing the targeted
   cloned RNA1 region, as well as an infectious dose of virus of
   10(2.5)-10(2.85) TCID50/ml. A set of samples was tested by two different
   laboratories, with similar results, demonstrating the robustness of the
   test. This is the first one step generic rRT-PCR method for
   betanodaviruses. It is simple to perform and may be used for first
   intention diagnostics as well as for confirmation in case of doubtful
   results obtained with other published tests targeting RNA2. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{To characterize the clinicopathologic features of recently described
   genotypes of Newcastle disease virus (NDV), 1 representative strain of

   used to infect groups of ten 4-week-old specific pathogen-free chickens.
   The pathobiology of these 3 strains was compared to a South African NDV
   strain classified within genotype VII. All chickens infected with the 4
   viruses died or were euthanized by day 4 postinfection due to the
   severity of clinical signs. Gross and histologic lesions in all infected
   chickens included extensive necrosis of lymphoid tissues (thymus,
   spleen, bursa of Fabricius, cecal tonsils, gut-associated lymphoid
   tissue), gastrointestinal necrosis and hemorrhages, and severe
   hemorrhagic conjunctivitis. Immunohistochemical staining revealed
   systemic viral distribution, and the most intense staining was in the
   lymphoid organs. Results demonstrate that the 3 West African strains
   from the previously uncharacterized genotypes XIV and XVII are typical
   velogenic viscerotropic NDV strains with lesions similar to the South
   African strain. Under experimental conditions, QV4 and LaSota NDV
   vaccine strains successfully protected chickens from morbidity and
   mortality against the genotype VII and one genotype XVII NDV strain,
   with no significant differences in the amount of virus shed when 2

   space-time scan statistics, to detect the presence of recurrent WNV
   infection hotspots. Linear models were fit to detect the possible
   relationships between WNV occurrence in humans and its activity in
   mosquitoes. Clusters were detected for all of the hosts, defining a
   limited area on which to focus surveillance and promptly identify WNV
   reactivation. Positive relationships were identified between WNV in
   humans and in mosquitoes; although it was not possible to define precise
   spatial and temporal scales at which entomological surveillance could
   predict the increasing risk of human infections. This stresses the
   necessity to improve entomological surveillance by increasing both the
   density of trapping sites and the frequency of captures.}},

Abstract = {{The marble trout Salmo marmoratus (Cuvier, 1829) is an endemic species
   of great conservation concern, given its geographical restricted
   distribution and the high risk of hybridization with brown trout Salmo
   trutta L. Viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) and infectious
   hematopoietic necrosis (IHN) are predominantly diseases of freshwater
   salmonids, which may trigger off severe disease outbreaks causing high
   mortality. Marble trout has not been inserted in the vector species list
   for those pathogens, but at present, little information on its
   susceptibility and on the possible carrier status is available. The aim
   of the present study was to assess the ability of European strains of
   VHSV and IHNV to cause disease and associated mortality in
   experimentally infected marble trout, and to determine whether a carrier
   status can result after experimental infection. Three genetically
   different strains of marble trout were challenged with VHSV and IHNV by
   immersion. Rainbow trouts were used as positive controls. Fish were
   checked twice a day, and dead fish were removed and sampled for
   subsequent virological analyses. With respect to rainbow trout, results
   demonstrated a very low susceptibility of marble trout to both VHSV and
   IHNV under simulated natural conditions. The presence of a certain
   number of chronically infected marble trout confirms that some
   individuals can survive the infection and eventually act as carrier of
   the disease, suggesting that marble trout should be definitely added to
   the list of susceptible species according to the European legislation.
