abstract={The majority of tuberculosis cases in ruminants are caused by Mycobacterium bovis (MB). However, in this study, the authors reported the isolation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT) from bovine milk, nasal swabs and post-mortem tissue samples (n = 841) collected from cattle and buffaloes in the states of Telangana, Maharashtra and Gujarat in India in the period from 2010 to 2015. The isolates (n = 7) were confirmed as Mycobacterium due to their growth characteristics and colony morphology in a commercial liquid medium Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT)™ employing the BD BACTEC™ MGIT™ 960 system and the Löwenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium supplemented with glycerol but not with sodium pyruvate, and BD-DIFCO™ Middlebrook 7H10 agar containing oleic albumin dextrose catalase (OADC). These isolates were initially identified as members of the M. tuberculosis complex (MTC) using a commercial nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) kit based on the IS6110 MTC specific nucleotide sequence. The isolates were confirmed as MT using three commercial line probe assay kits, were further genotyped, and the spoligotypes identified were of East African Indian (EAI) 3_IND, EAI5, Central-Asian (CAS) 1_DELHI, U and T1 lineages. Two MT isolates from one antelope (Antilope cervipara) andone gazelle (Gazella bennettii) from Gujarat, which were identified previously, were spoligotyped during this study and identified as belonging to EAI3_IND and EAI5 lineages, respectively. The epidemiological significance and zoonotic implications of regional presence and documentation of the same or two differents poligotypes in different species within the family Bovidae as well as humans is discussed.
La majorité des cas de tuberculose chez les ruminants sont dus à Mycobacterium bovis. Néanmoins, les auteurs rapportent les résultats d’une étude réalisée de 2010 à 2015 en Inde (états de Telangana, Maharashtra et Gujarat), au cours de laquelle Mycobacterium tuberculosis a été isolé à partir de lait de vache ainsi que d’écouvillons nasaux et de prélèvements tissulaires postmortem (n = 841) collectés sur des bovins et des buffles. L’appartenance des isolats au genre Mycobacterium a été confirmée par l’observation des caractéristiques de croissance des colonies et de leur morphologie dans un milieu de culture liquide du commerce (Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube [MGIT]™ : tube avec indicateur de croissance mycobactérienne) en utilisant l’automate BD BACTEC™MGIT™ 960 et un milieu de Lowenstein-Jensen additionné de glycérol mais sanspyruvate de sodium, ainsi qu’une gélose BD-DIFCO™ Middlebrook enrichie en acide oléique, albumine, dextrose et catalase (OADC). Dans un premier temps, les isolats ont été identifiés comme étant des membres du complexe M. tuberculosisau moyen d’une amplification en chaîne par polymérase nichée ciblant la séquence nucléotidique spécifique IS6110 du complexe M. tuberculosis. Trois kits commerciaux d’analyse de souches ont permis d’identifier les isolats comme étant M. tuberculosis ; il a ensuite été procédé à l’analyse des génotypes des souches de spoligotypes, lesquelles appartenaient aux lignées East African Indian (EAI) 3_IND,EAI5, Central-Asian (CAS) 1_DELHI, U et T1. Les spoligotypes de deux isolats de M. tuberculosis obtenus précédemment, provenant respectivement d’une antilope(Antilope cervipara) et d’une gazelle (Gazella bennettii) de l’état de Gujarat ont été analysés lors de la présente étude et identifiés comme étant respectivement de lignée EAI3_IND et EAI5. Les auteurs analysent l’importance épidémiologique et la portée zoonotique de la présence rapportée dans la région du même spoligotype ou de deux spoligotypes différents chez des espèces différentes de la famille des Bovidés ainsi que chez l’homme.
La mayoría de los casos de tuberculosis que afectan a los rumiantes son causados por Mycobacterium bovis (MB). En este estudio, sin embargo, los autores dan cuenta del aislamiento de Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT) en muestras de leche, frotis nasales y tejidos obtenidos post-mortem (n = 841) de ganado vacuno y búfalos de los estados de Telangana, Maharashtra y Gujarat (India) entre 2010 y 2015. Se confirmó que los microorganismos aislados(n = 7) eran micobacterias por sus características de crecimiento y la morfología de las colonias cultivadas en medio líquido comercial Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT)™ empleando el sistema BD BACTEC™ MGIT™ 960 y el medio Löwenstein-Jensen (LJ) suplementado con glicerol, pero no con piruvato sódico, y agar BD-DIFCO™ Middlebrook 7H10 con ácido oleico, albúmina, dextrosa y catalasa (OADC). Mediante una PCR (reacción en cadena de la polimerasa) anidada comercial basada en la secuencia nucleotídica IS6110 específica del complejo, se empezó por determinar que esos microorganismos pertenecían al complejo M. tuberculosis (MTC). Tras confirmar que se trataba de M. tuberculosis empleando tres ensayos comerciales con sondas en línea, se procedió a caracterizar su genotipo, lo que sirvió para identificar espoligotipos correspondientes a los siguientes linajes: East African Indian (EAI) 3_IND, EAI5, Central-Asian (CAS) 1_DELHI, U y T1. Durante el estudio se caracterizaron asimismo los espoligotipos de dos M. tuberculosis aislados previamente a partir de un antílope (Antilope cervipara) y una gacela (Gazella bennettii) de Gujarat, lo que permitió adscribirlos respectivamente a los linajes EAI3_IND y EAI5. Los autores exponen la importancia desde el punto de vista epidemiológico que tiene la presencia comprobada en la región del mismo espoligotipo o de dos espoligotipos diferentes en distintas especies de la familia Bovidae, así como en el ser humano, y las consecuencias que de ahí se siguen por lo que respecta a posibles zoonosis.},

abstract={Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex is the cause of tuberculosis (TB) in humans and other animals. Specifically, Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) are highly pathogenic mycobacteria that may infect different animal species and are the sources of TB in humans. The objective of this paper was to review the epidemiology of M. bovis and M. tuberculosis in animals. The review also highlighted the transmission dynamics of M. bovis and M. tuberculosis in humans and animals and control challenges of zoonotic TB in Ethiopia. The literature review focused on scientific peer-reviewed articles from studies exclusively conducted in Ethiopia that were published from 1998 to 2017. Husbandry system, breed and herd size have significant role in the epidemiology of bovine tuberculosis (BTB) in Ethiopia. The information presented reveals that different strains of M. bovis are widely distributed in domestic animals predominantly in the Ethiopian cattle and the main strain was found to be SB1176. In addition, the isolation of M. tuberculosis from domestic animals in different settings signifies the circulation of the agent between humans and animals in Ethiopia. The life styles of the Ethiopian communities, close contact with domestic animals and/or the habit of consuming raw animal products, are suggested as the main factors for transmission of M. bovis and M. tuberculosis between human and animal which may have impact on the TB control program in human. In Ethiopia, a human TB control program has been widely implemented, however, the role of animal in the transmission of the causative agent has been neglected which could be one of the challenges for an effective control program. This warrants the need for incorporating animal TB control programs using “One Health” approach for effective TB control for both human and animal. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Zoonotic tuberculosis (TB) is a significant public health disease, but has long been neglected. Information on knowledge and practices of its prevention and influencing factors amongst occupationally exposed individuals is required for designing all-inclusive, informed control programmes. We investigated knowledge and practices related to zoonotic TB prevention and associated determinants amongst herdsmen and abattoir workers in southwestern, south-eastern and north-western Nigeria using semi-structured questionnaire. Data were analysed with STATA 12. A total of 510 respondents (196 herdsmen; 314 abattoir workers) participated in the survey, of which 58.6% and 46.9% respectively were knowledgeable and demonstrated good practices about zoonotic TB prevention. Almost 60% knew that zoonotic TB transmission was preventable and 49.8% knew transmission could be through consumption of infected animal products. However, only 16.7% knew the disease could be transmitted by aerosol. Just 49.4% sought medical check-up when ill, 37.8% used protective clothing and only 29.2% usually condemned TB infected cattle. Respondents with post-primary education were about three times more likely to be knowledgeable (OR = 2.70, 95%CI: 1.68–4.33) and two times more likely to demonstrate good practice (OR = 2.23, 95%CI: 1.45–3.42) than those without formal education. Similarly, abattoir workers were about 6.4 times more likely to be knowledgeable (OR: 6.39, 95%CI: 4.31–9.47) and two times more likely to demonstrate good practice (OR: 2.03, 95%CI: 1.40–2.92) than the herdsmen. There were important knowledge gaps with poor practices about zoonotic TB prevention amongst livestock workers in Nigeria. Strong predictors of knowledge and practice were being an abattoir worker and having post-primary education. Well-designed grassroots enlightenment programmes addressing modes of transmission, handling infected cattle and seeking medical check-up are urgently needed among high risk settings considering the recently launched Road Map for Zoonotic Tuberculosis which resonates that every tuberculosis case counts towards 2030 End-TB Strategy. © 2018 Adesokan et al.

abstract={The close association of cattle/buffaloes to farmers and their family members is a well-known phenomenon in rural India. Cattle are major contributors to the income for the sustenance of families, and for many landless farmers, often the only source of livelihood. The animals are sheltered under the same roof where the family members sleep, cook and eat. This close proximity of humans to cattle/buffaloes exposes farmers and family members to tuberculosis (TB), especially if they are vulnerable (e.g. malnourished children along with adults, diabetics, people with HIV/AIDS, people with addiction to alcohol, or smokers). Several studies have examined the risk factors that are associated with TB, such as crowding (slum dwellers), poor living conditions, alcohol, and tobacco. Other studies have found a significant proportion of diabetic patients with coexistent TB. This study examines the spread of TB from animals to humans and its public health significance. To achieve this, selected numbers of cattle/buffaloes were tested for TB and the association with humans and animals was examined. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={In the present study, we aimed to estimate the occurrence of bovine tuberculosis (TB) and examine the determinants of distribution of the disease in three high-risk populations of Central India. A prospective cohort study was conducted in Central India between March 2014 and June 2015. Based on the requisite inclusion criteria, we recruited a total of 301 participants whose blood samples were subjected to polymerase chain reaction-based detection and differentiation of Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. M. bovis was detected in 11.4%, 8.9%, and 12.6% of the recruited participants belonging to three distinct population groups (Groups A, B, and C, respectively). The highest proportion of cases infected with M. bovis was observed in Group C, who lived in the high TB endemic region. Previous contact with active TB cases (odds ratio = 3.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.9612–14.4533) and raw milk consumption (odds ratio = 5.3472; 95% confidence interval, 1.9590–14.5956) were found to be important determinants of bovine TB in this population. The high incidence rates of bovine TB in the Central Indian populations indicate the substantial consequences of this disease for some population groups and settings. However, more research is necessary to identify the main transmission drivers in these areas. © 2017},

abstract={A cross-sectional study was carried out from April 2015 to June 2016 to estimate the status of bovine tuberculosis (BTB), assessment of community’s current knowledge, and zoonotic importance on this disease in Borana zone, southern Ethiopia. In this study, comparative intradermal tuberculin (CIDT) test, structured questionnaires, and retrospective data were used, while the result indicated 3.8% prevalence at individual animal level with 5.6% (31/554) of doubtful reactors. Among related risk factors included, old animals were significantly infected by BTB than young one (χ 2 = 32.005, P = 0.001). Parity number again showed significant difference (χ 2 = 29.163, P = 0.001) where animals with many parity were more reactive to conducted test than few parity numbers. Animals born in the breeding center managed under semi-intensive production system were more infected (χ 2 = 10.795, P = 0.029) than those brought from outside of the center. Questionnaire survey in this study indicated that out of 130 interviewed respondents, only 30% pastoralists knew what BTB mean; whereas the level of individual knowledge from interviewed showed about 72.3% of respondents had poor understanding of BTB and only about 11.5% of them knew its zoonotic importance. Meat eating habit of communities in the area were culturally inhabited to eat cooked meat and only 12.3% (16/130) of respondents gave response on habit of eating both raw and cooked meat. Milk drinking habit of pastoralist in the area showed about 79.2% drunk raw milk and the rest 20.8% used both raw and boiled milk. A retrospective data from Yabello Hospital indicated that current prevalence of human TB as 38.79% and showing the disease was highly increasing from year to year in the study area. This implies a great importance of human tuberculosis and its future concern in Borana zone. From this, there should be detail awareness of communities on BTB, its zoonotic importance, and the need of further investigation to develop control and prevention strategies according to the pastoral settings. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Bovine tuberculosis (BTB) is an endemic zoonosis in Morocco caused by Mycobacterium bovis, which infects many domestic animals and is transmitted to humans through consumption of raw milk or from contact with infected animals. The prevalence of BTB in Moroccan cattle is estimated at 18%, and 33% at the individual and the herd level respectively, but the human M. bovis burden needs further clarification. The current control strategy based on test and slaughter should be improved through local context adaptation taking into account a suitable compensation in order to reduce BTB prevalence in Morocco and decrease the disease burden in humans and animals. We established a simple compartmental deterministic mathematical model for BTB transmission in cattle and humans to provide a general understanding of BTB, in particular regarding transmission to humans. Differential equations were used to model the different pathways between the compartments for cattle and humans. Scenarios of test and slaughter were simulated to determine the effects of varying the proportion of tested animals (p) on the time to elimination of BTB (individual animal prevalence of less than one in a thousand) in cattle and humans. The time to freedom from disease ranged from 75 years for p = 20% to 12 years for p = 100%. For p > 60% the time to elimination was less than 20 years. The cumulated cost was largely stable: for p values higher than 40%, cost ranged from 1.47 to 1.60 billion euros with a time frame of 12 to 32 years to reach freedom from disease. The model simulations also suggest that using a 2mm cut off instead of a 4mm cut off in the Single Intradermal Comparative Cervical Tuberculin skin test (SICCT) would result in cheaper and quicker elimination programs.

abstract={Mycobacterium tuberculosis is recognised as the primary cause of human tuberculosis worldwide. However, substantial evidence suggests that the burden of Mycobacterium bovis, the cause of bovine tuberculosis, might be underestimated in human beings as the cause of zoonotic tuberculosis. In 2013, results from a systematic review and meta-analysis of global zoonotic tuberculosis showed that the same challenges and concerns expressed 15 years ago remain valid. These challenges faced by people with zoonotic tuberculosis might not be proportional to the scientific attention and resources allocated in recent years to other diseases. The burden of zoonotic tuberculosis in people needs important reassessment, especially in areas where bovine tuberculosis is endemic and where people live in conditions that favour direct contact with infected animals or animal products. As countries move towards detecting the 3 million tuberculosis cases estimated to be missed annually, and in view of WHO's end TB strategy endorsed by the health authorities of WHO Member States in 2014 to achieve a world free of tuberculosis by 2035, we call on all tuberculosis stakeholders to act to accurately diagnose and treat tuberculosis caused by M bovis in human beings. © 2017 World Health Organization.

abstract={Objective/background To determine the occurrence of active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) due to Mycobacterium bovis in abattoir workers, butchers, livestock farmers, and veterinarians and to document their knowledge and practices regarding bovine TB (bTB). Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among abattoir workers, butchers, livestock farmers, veterinary doctors, and veterinary assistants. Sputum samples were collected from the respondents with a chronic cough and data on sociodemographic conditions, knowledge, and practices regarding TB were obtained. The chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. Results A total of 141 abattoir workers, 317 butchers, 50 livestock farmers, five veterinary doctors, and three veterinary assistants took part. Four of 16 coughing abattoir workers and one of 50 coughing livestock farmers were positive for M. bovis by polymerase chain reaction analysis. Duration of work as an abattoir worker was significantly associated (p < 0.05) with prevalence of zoonotic TB. Age, education, and type of work carried out by workers were not significantly associated with zoonotic TB. None of the abattoir workers, butchers, and livestock farmers had undergone any sort of formal training related to their work. The knowledge of abattoir workers, butchers, livestock farmers, and veterinary assistants regarding transmission of bTB from animals to humans and the symptoms of TB in humans was very poor. Most of these workers did not use protective equipment and appropriate safe working techniques and were considered at high risk of acquiring zoonotic TB. Conclusion Zoonotic TB is a significant public health issue among professionally exposed groups in Peshawar, Pakistan, and suggests a need for further detailed investigations of the disease in this and similar areas. © 2016},

abstract={Background: Ethiopia, a high tuberculosis (TB) burden country, reports one of the highest incidence rates of extra-pulmonary TB dominated by cervical lymphadenitis (TBLN). Infection with Mycobacterium bovis has previously been excluded as the main reason for the high rate of extrapulmonary TB in Ethiopia. Methods: Here we examined demographic and clinical characteristics of 953 pulmonary (PTB) and 1198 TBLN patients visiting 11 health facilities in distinct geographic areas of Ethiopia. Clinical characteristics were also correlated with genotypes of the causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Results: No major patient or bacterial strain factor could be identified as being responsible for the high rate of TBLN, and there was no association with HIV infection. However, analysis of the demographic data of involved patients showed that having regular and direct contact with live animals was more associated with TBLN than with PTB, although no M. bovis was isolated from patients with TBLN. Among PTB patients, those infected with Lineage 4 reported "contact with other TB patient" more often than patients infected with Lineage 3 did (OR = 1.6, CI 95% 1.0-2.7; p = 0.064). High fever, in contrast to low and moderate fever, was significantly associated with Lineage 4 (OR = 2.3; p = 0.024). On the other hand, TBLN cases infected with Lineage 4 tended to get milder symptoms overall for the constitutional symptoms than those infected with Lineage 3. Conclusions: The study suggests a complex role for multiple interacting factors in the epidemiology of extrapulmonary TB in Ethiopia, including factors that can only be derived from population-based studies, which may prove to be significant for TB control in Ethiopia. © Berg et al.; licensee BioMed Central.},

While M. tuberculosis affects primarily humans, Mycobacterium bovis has a wide range of host species including wild and domestic animals and humans. This chapter investigates the role of different host species in the transmission of tuberculosis at various animal/human interfaces. While drivers and modes of zoonotic TB transmission are reviewed, a broad spectrum of complexities hampering the eradication of this disease are highlighted. The most important constraints, next to factors related to pathogen-host interactions such as HIV co-infection and multidrug resistance of MTBC strains, are socio-economic shortcomings in the control of bovine tuberculosis in the cattle population as well as traditional customs and habits related to the consumption of milk and other animal products. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.},

abstract={Tuberculosis is a disease of humans and animals that is caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC). Tuberculosis is typically spread through the airborne route via droplet nuclei that are inhaled into the lungs. The majority of exposed hosts do not become infected, and the majority of infected hosts do not progress to clinically evident tuberculosis disease. However, when active tuberculosis disease does occur, it results in severe illness that is often highly contagious, commonly results in permanent damage to the lungs and other tissues, and frequently is eventually fatal without appropriate treatment. Although intraspecies (i.e., human-to-human and animal-to-animal) transmission is most common in tuberculosis epidemiology, interspecies (e.g., animal-to-human or human-to-animal) transmission is an important source of tuberculosis infections, particularly in developing areas of the world without fully developed bovine tuberculosis eradication programs and widespread pasteurization of milk. Zoonotic tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium bovis is more common than zoonotic tuberculosis caused by other species of MTC, and tuberculosis disease caused by M. bovis infections often involve the alimentary tract, reflecting the role of ingestion in the transmission of M. bovis. Although rare, M. tuberculosis does play a role in transmission of tuberculosis to humans from animals such as nonhuman primates and elephants. As M. tuberculosis is host adapted to humans, infections with this MTC species in animals are generally considered to be the result of transmission from humans to animals. Prevention and control of both intraspecies and zoonotic transmission of MTC is important to eventually eliminating tuberculosis in human and domestic animal populations. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

abstract={Bovine tuberculosis (BTB) is an endemic disease in the cattle population in Nigeria. This is reflected by the continuous observation of tuberculous lesions in slaughtered cattle at various abattoirs across the country. More importantly, BTB remains a persistent problem in Nigerian cattle herds because of the deplorable state of the livestock sub-sector; a situation that has contributed immensely to lack of coordination in the control of the disease, and hence its public health concern. Furthermore, since there are no control measures put in place especially on farm and among slaughtered cattle, BTB remains an intractable problem, and hence, its spillover to humans due to lack of public health awareness. Consequently, several cases of undiagnosed, unreported/under reported M. bovis infections occur among exposed individuals given the poor health care system. In addition, due to poor BTB control, wildlife/zoo animals' infections have been reported; thereby further endangering public health. Resulting from unrestricted animal movement in Nigeria, diverse strains of M. bovis have been isolated from farm and abattoir animals; and some of these are linked to strains from neighbouring African countries. In conclusion, with the gradual introduction of modern diagnostic tools and methods in the epidemiological investigations of BTB in Nigeria, tracking of the disease will become easier. Finally, through coordinated approach by the government, and strategic involvement of major stakeholders, it is anticipated that BTB will be controlled in Nigerian cattle herds, thereby safeguarding public health. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

In New Zealand, and in the less remote arid and/or tropical parts of Australia, there was limited or no use of whole-herd depopulation to clear infection from livestock. In northern and central Australia, depopulation did, however, become a crucial tool in quickly eliminating TB from the most difficult areas.

The occurrence of TB in animals in India has been reviewed, reflecting a definite prevalence of TB in animals in India. According to the RNTCP report, India is the second-most populous country in the world, adding more new human TB cases annually than any other country.

Much of what is known about tuberculosis and its transmission, the route of infection, diagnosis, clinical course, progression of disease, and pathology, were discovered through evaluation of a naturally occurring infection. In nonhuman primates the clinical presentation of tuberculosis is similar for both M. tuberculosis and M. bovis. Gross and microscopic lesions in NHPs with tuberculosis can vary in duration and degree of the disease.

abstract={Bovine tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium bovis, remains one of the most important zoonotic health concerns worldwide. The transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from humans to animals also occurs especially in countries where there is close interaction of humans with the animals. In the present study, thirty bovine lung tissue autopsy samples from an organized dairy farm located in North India were screened for the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex by smear microscopy, histopathological findings and PCR. Differential diagnosis of M. tuberculosis and M. bovis was made based on the deletion of mce-3 operon in M. bovis. The present study found eight of these samples positive for M. tuberculosis by multiplex PCR. Sequencing was performed on two PCR-positive representative samples and on annotation, and BLAST analysis confirmed the presence of gene fragment specific to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The presence of M. tuberculosis in all the positive samples raises the possibility of human-to-cattle transmission and possible adaptation of this organism in bovine tissues. This study accentuates the importance of screening and differential diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in humans and livestock for adopting effective TB control and eradication programmes. © 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={Milk production using local cattle breed-types is an age-old practice in Malawi. Although dairy farming is becoming more common as a result of the increasing population and demand for milk and milk products, there is limited knowledge of the farmers' awareness of zoonotic disease risks, their preventative practices and the disease burden in animals. This study determined dairy farmers' general knowledge of zoonoses, assessed their risks for infection with zoonotic bovine tuberculosis (bTB) and brucellosis, and evaluated farm practices to prevent disease transmission. A questionnaire was drawn up and administered by the authors. It was used to collect information about the knowledge and preventive practices of 140 out of 684 registered dairy farmers at Mzuzu Agricultural Development Division, northern Malawi. During a second visit to 60 out of the 140 farms, a total of 156 and 95 cattle were tested for brucellosis and tuberculosis, respectively. Most farmers (77.1%) knew or had heard of zoonotic diseases, whilst 75.0% correctly named at least one zoonotic disease. More survey participants named tuberculosis as a zoonotic disease compared to brucellosis (74.3% versus 2.9%). The most commonly named means of transmission were milk (67.0%) and meat (56.0%). Almost all survey participants (96.4%) practised at least one farm activity that could lead to potential transmission of brucellosis or bTB, including sale (67.0%) and consumption (34.0%) of unpasteurised milk. Antibodies against brucellosis were found in 12 cattle (7.7%), whilst one animal (1.1%) reacted to the tuberculin skin test. General knowledge about possible transmission of diseases between humans and animals was high, although most farmers practised risk behaviours that could potentially expose the public to milk-borne zoonotic diseases such as brucellosis and bTB. Furthermore, some animals had positive results for brucellosis and tuberculosis tests. Therefore, improvement of zoonotic disease prevention programmes, as well as further investigation into the prevalence and risk factors for zoonoses, is recommended. © 2014. The Authors.},

abstract={The expression One Health refers to the unified human and veterinary approach to zoonoses, an approach that used to be identified with Medicine throughout the 20th Century. Zoonotic tuberculosis (TB), a disease due to bacteria of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, is a recognized global public veterinary health problem. The significance of the health and economic threats posed by zoonotic TB has been recognized by several global health agencies, which have called for control and eradication programs for zoonotic TB. The interplay between humans, livestock, wildlife, and ecology in the epidemiology of zoonotic TB make arduous the control of the disease, as such zoonotic TB is the ideal target for the application of the One Health approach. This article argues that a successful One Health response to TB will consider the effects of disease on socio-economic well-being, and allow for addressing the social, cultural and economic conditions that facilitate spread and maintenance of this disease. The One Health approach will also enable the development of disease control programs involving both animal and human populations, fostering the participation of various stakeholders. One Health approach will also allow for expanding scientific knowledge, improve medical education and clinical care, and develop effective disease control programs for both human and animal populations.},

In regions outside Africa included in this study, overall median proportions of zoonotic TB of ≤1.4% in connection with overall TB incidence rates ≤71/100,000 population/year suggested low incidence rates. For countries of Africa included in the study, we multiplied the observed median proportion of zoonotic TB cases of 2.8% with the continental average overall TB incidence rate of 264/100,000 population/year, which resulted in a crude estimate of 7 zoonotic TB cases/100,000 population/year.

Transmission from Humans to cows can also occur, in both developed and developing countries. In countries or groups where "Human" Tb is frequent, M. tuberculosis can be transmitted from Humans to different animal species, including cows, pets and elephants, especially Asian elephants. Transmission of M. tuberculosis from elephants to Humans has also been demonstrated. Cows seem capable to transmit M. tuberculosis to Humans, while less efficiently than M. bovis. Pet dogs and cats are exceptionally involved. In order to control zoonotic Tb, a "One Health" approach is needed and should include more specific measures targeting zoonotic transmission.},

abstract={Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most devastating infectious diseases worldwide. Whilst global burden estimates for M. tuberculosis infection (MtTB) are well established, accurate data on the contribution of zoonotic TB (zTB) caused by M. bovis or M. caprae to human TB are scarce. The association of M. bovis infection with extrapulmonary tuberculosis has been suggested repeatedly, though there is little scientific evidence available to support this relationship. The present study aimed to determine globally the occurrence of extrapulmonary TB and the primary site (i.e. primary body location affected) of zTB in comparison with MtTB, based on previously published reports. A systematic literature review was conducted in 32 different bibliographic databases, selecting reports on zTB written in English, French, German, Spanish or Portuguese. Data from 27 reports from Africa, America, Europe and the Western Pacific Region were extracted for analyses. Low income countries, in Africa and South-East Asia, were highly underrepresented in the dataset. The median proportion of extrapulmonary TB cases was significantly increased among zTB in comparison with data from registries of Europe and USA, reporting mainly MtTB cases (47% versus 22% in Europe, 73% versus 30% in the USA). These findings were confirmed by analyses of eight studies reporting on the proportions of extrapulmonary TB in comparable populations of zTB and MtTB cases (median 63% versus 22%). Also, disparities of primary sites of extrapulmonary TB between zTB and MtTB were detected. Our findings, based on global data, confirm the widely suggested association between zTB and extrapulmonary disease. Different disability weights for zTB and MtTB should be considered and we recommend separate burden estimates for the two diseases. © 2013 Dürr et al.},

abstract={There are significant achievements in the control of animal tuberculosis (TB) in Argentina. The percentage of bovines with apparent TB lesions at the slaughterhouse inspection decreased from 6.7% to 0.6% between 1969 and 2011. On the other hand, the mean percentage of human TB cases due to M. bovis among all those bacteriologically confirmed, was in Santa Fe, an agro-industrial province, 2.3% in the period 1977-2001. It fell to 1.6% by 2011. In the Cetrángolo Hospital (Buenos Aires), it was 0.34% in the period 2001-2005, and 0.36% in 2006-2011. At the Muñiz Hospital, these percentages decreased from 1.75% in 1971 to 0.22% in 2006. Frequency of HIV infection among M. bovis cases varied from 5.9% in Santa Fe to 11.1% and 20.5% respectively, in Cetrángolo and Muñiz Hospitals (a reference institution for aids) in Buenos Aires. According to these data M. bovis infection predominates in agro- industrial/ rural areas, showing a slow decrease there as well as in Buenos Aires. Co-infection with HIV is more frequent among patients with M. bovis that in all cases of TB. The situation of M. bovis in Argentina is here compared with that in USA and in several European and Latin American countries. Trends followed by TB in cattle, in humans, and the percentages of M. bovis among them, are not always closely related. To move towards the common goal of eradicating TB, the employment of appropriate strategies and the strengthening of control measures are critical in both programs.},

abstract={A case of pulmonary tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis was diagnosed in a horse. Clinical evaluation performed prior to euthanasia did not suggest tuberculosis, but postmortem examination provided pathological and bacteriological evidence of mycobacteriosis. In the lungs, multiple tuberculoid granulomas communicating with the bronchiolar lumen, pleural effusion, and a granulomatous lymphadenitis involving mediastinal and tracheobronchial lymph nodes were found. Serologic response to M. tuberculosis antigens was detected in the infected horse, but not in the group of 42 potentially exposed animals (18 horses, 14 alpacas, 6 donkeys, and 4 dogs) which showed no signs of disease. Diagnosis of tuberculosis in live horses remains extremely difficult. Four of 20 animal handlers at the farm were positive for tuberculous infection upon follow-up testing by interferon-gamma release assay, indicating a possibility of interspecies transmission of M. tuberculosis. © 2012 Konstantin P.

abstract={Despite huge global efforts in tuberculosis (TB) control, pastoral areas remain under-investigated. During two years sputum and fine needle aspirate (FNA) specimens were collected from 260 Ethiopian pastoralists of Oromia and Somali Regional States with suspected pulmonary TB and from 32 cases with suspected TB lymphadenitis. In parallel, 207 suspected tuberculous lesions were collected from cattle, camels and goats at abattoirs. All specimens were processed and cultured for mycobacteria; samples with acid-fast stained bacilli (AFB) were further characterized by molecular methods including genus and deletion typing as well as spoligotyping. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) were sequenced at the 16S rDNA locus. Culturing of AFB from human sputum and FNA samples gave a yield of 174 (67%) and 9 (28%) isolates, respectively. Molecular typing was performed on 173 of these isolates and 160 were confirmed as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, three as M. bovis, and the remaining 10 were typed as NTMs. Similarly, 48 AFB isolates (23%) yielded from tuberculous lesions of livestock, of which 39 were molecular typed, including 24 M. bovis and 4 NTMs from cattle, 1 M. tuberculosis and 1 NTM from camels and 9 NTMs from goats. Isolation of M. bovis from humans and M. tuberculosis from livestock suggests transmission between livestock and humans in the pastoral areas of South-East Ethiopia. © 2012 The Author(s).},

abstract={SETTING: The epidemiology of zoonotic tuberculosis (ZTB) in humans in Mexico is poorly known. OBJECTIVE: To identify isolates of Mycobacterium bovis in humans and cattle by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and establish the clinical and epidemiological importance of ZTB in humans. DESIGN: From 1995 to 2009, 124 isolates from patients with TB and 60 isolates from cattle were analysed. PCR identification was performed using the oxyR gene, and the clinical and epidemiological aspects of ZTB in humans were investigated. RESULTS: PCR identified 93 M. bovis isolates: 35 (28%) from the 124 human isolates and 58 (97%) from the 60 cattle isolates. The sensitivity and specificity of the method were 100%. ZTB in the 35 patients presented as extra-pulmonary TB (EPTB) in 74%: 51% were children, 69% had malnutrition, 51% had consumed unpasteurised milk and 6% had contact with animals; 11% were relapses and 31% died. CONCLUSIONS: PCR using the oxyR gene is highly sensitive, specific and rapid for the identification of M. bovis. ZTB is a serious public health problem, and presented as EPTB in children with malnutrition and those who had consumed unpasteurised milk. ZTB provokes relapses and a high mortality rate. © 2011 The Union.},

abstract={Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death worldwide from a single infectious agent. An ability to detect the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) in clinical material while simultaneously differentiating its members is considered important. This allows for the gathering of epidemiological information pertaining to the prevalence, transmission and geographical distribution of the MTC, including those MTC members associated with zoonotic TB infection in humans. Also differentiating between members of the MTC provides the clinician with inherent MTC specific drug susceptibility profiles to guide appropriate chemotherapy. Methodology/Principal Findings: The aim of this study was to develop a multiplex real-time PCR assay using novel molecular targets to identify and differentiate between the phylogenetically closely related M. bovis, M. bovis BCG and M. caprae. The lpqT gene was explored for the collective identification of M. bovis, M. bovis BCG and M. caprae, the lepA gene was targeted for the specific identification of M. caprae and a Region of Difference 1 (RD1) assay was incorporated in the test to differentiate M. bovis BCG. The multiplex real-time PCR assay was evaluated on 133 bacterial strains and was determined to be 100% specific for the members of the MTC targeted. Conclusions/Significance: The multiplex real-time PCR assay developed in this study is the first assay described for the identification and simultaneous differentiation of M. bovis, M. bovis BCG and M. caprae in one internally controlled reaction. Future validation of this multiplex assay should demonstrate its potential in the rapid and accurate diagnosis of TB caused by these three mycobacteria. Furthermore, the developed assay may be used in conjunction with a recently described multiplex real-time PCR assay for identification of the MTC and simultaneous differentiation of M. tuberculosis, M. canettii resulting in an ability to differentiate five of the eight members of the MTC. © 2011 Reddington et al.},

abstract={The article reviews the steadily increasing literature on tuberculosis outbreaks involving Mycobacterium bovis, a bacillus traditionally associated with cattle and dairy products but in fact syndemic in a wide range of other animals including humans. Six major categories of journals cover this story: human infectious diseases and epidemiology, general human medicine, general veterinary practice, veterinary management of zoonoses and wildlife diseases, major multiscience journals, and microbiology. The journal literature is highly concentrated: Twelve high-impact journals account for more than half the citations, while sixty-seven others account for the remainder. While the incidence of food-borne TB has declined in most of the economically developed Western world, there remains a serious potential for dairy-based flares along the U.S.-Mexican border, for venison-associated outbreaks at the U.S.-Canadian border, and for continuing infection of herds in the United Kingdom due to a stubborn residual pool of infected grazing lands. While the consumption of unpasteurized raw milk and artisanal cheeses is generally inadvisable in many parts of the world, small-scale organic dairy farmers in economically developed countries who are particularly scrupulous in maintaining the health of their herds and cleanliness of the production process pose only a limited threat to public health, although occasional small-scale outbreaks will inevitably occur without pasteurization. However, in poorer countries, and especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, the confluence of wildlife, cattle, dairy operations, and rampant TB involving HIV/AIDS-compromised farm workers and consumers has created a nightmare cycle of infection and reinfection.

The presence of Mycobacterium avium-II was directly related to the death of birds kept in the original enclosure, and of 50% of a group of sentinel birds. Failure to detect the organism in a control group of birds outside the enclosure indicated that the infection was limited to the original enclosed area.

abstract={Late in 2007, veterinary, medical and anthropological professionals from Europe and Africa met in a 2-day workshop in Pretoria, South Africa, to evaluate the burden, surveillance and control of zoonotic tuberculosis and brucellosis in sub-Saharan Africa. Keynote presentations reviewed the burden of these diseases on human and livestock health, the existing diagnostic tools, and the available control methods. These presentations were followed by group discussions and the formulation of recommendations. The presence of Mycobacterium bovis and Brucella spp. in livestock was considered to be a serious threat to public health, since livestock and animal products are the only source of such infections in human beings. The impact of these pathogens on human health appears to be relatively marginal, however, when compared with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections and drug resistance, HIV and malaria. Appropriate diagnostic tools are needed to improve the detection of M. bovis and Brucella spp. in humans. In livock, the 'test-and-slaughter' approach and the pasteurization of milk, which have been used successfully in industrialized countries, might not be the optimal control tools in Africa. Control strategies should fit the needs and perceptions of local communities. Improved intersectoral and international collaboration in surveillance, diagnosis and control, and in the education of medical and veterinary personnel, are advocated. © The Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine 2009.},

abstract={Tuberculosis is an important disease among many zoonoses, because both Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis, which are the major causes of tuberculosis, are highly pathogenic, infect many animal species and thus are likely to be the source of infection in humans. In particular, monkeys are highly susceptible to these bacteria and are important spreaders. Recently, two outbreaks of M. tuberculosis occurred in four different kinds of monkeys and humans were also infected with the disease in Japan. In zoos, tuberculosis was reported not only in monkeys, but also in several different kinds of animals, including elephants. Pets such as dogs and cats are believed to be generally less susceptible to M. tuberculosis, but in this article we introduce a case of infection from man to dog by close contact. Japan is one of the few countries that have been able to control M. bovis infection. In other countries, however, cases of bovine tuberculosis and human M. bovis infection have been reported, and thus further attention is still required in the future. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Introduction: The elimination of tuberculosis among cattle in Czechoslovakia was announced in the middle of the sixties. The experiences from other countries that eliminated tuberculosis among cattle earlier than Cechoslovakia, indicated a sporadic occurence of tuberculosis caused by M. bovis in human population. Long term follow-up of the occurence of diminishing zoonosis was conducted by a special group of experts. Patiens: During 1971 a group of reference centres was created in Slovakia including: Reference centre for epidemiology of tuberculosis Reference centre for veterinary microbiology of tuberculosis Reference centre for epizootology of tuberculosis. Methods: The individual reference centres collected the data about the occurence of diseases caused by mycobacterium of other than human type (M. tbc.) Over the whole followed-up period the circulation of M. bovis in human population, animal population and the environment was followed up. Results: In 1990 two cases caused by M. bovis were discovered, 2 cases caused by MAI-complex, 5 cases caused by M. xenopi and 3 cases caused by M. kansasii. In 2004 no case caused by M. bovis was found, 1 case caused by MAI-complex was detected, 2 new cases caused by M. kansasii, 2 new cases caused by M. fortuitum, 1 new case caused by X. xenopi, M. smegmatis, M. parafortuitum and M. marinum were detected. Conclusion: Over the period of 15 years the occurence of new cases caused by Mycobacterium of other than human type had a decreasing and stabilizing trend. Cases caused by M. bovis disappeared. The cases caused by M. marinum pose a newly emerging problem in Slovakia.},

abstract={There are more than 700 different kinds of major zoonosis. Among them, tuberculosis is important, since mycobacteriosis, including tuberculosis, is common among nonhuman primates and ruminants. Although the natural host of tubercle bacilli is human, many kinds of animals are susceptible to Mycobacterium spp., including Mycobacterium bovis and other non-tuberculous Mycobacteria. In Japan, the prevalence of the recurrent infection between human and pet animals leads to increasing trends of, and mycobacteriosis of exhibition animals sometimes present a severe problem in a zoo. International standards for the control of infections caused by animals and foods are established by the Office International des Epizootics (OIE), which was founded in 1927. Member nations are required to ensure the protection of human and animal life and health on the basis of the international standards. Owing to the standards, animal diseases have been relatively well controlled in Japan. For example, the occurrence of bovine tuberculosis in dairy cattle is extremely limited, and the incidence rate of human tuberculosis in imported laboratory monkeys is quite low. At present, there is the political plan that the Tuberculosis Prevention Law will be incorporated into the Infectious Diseases Control Law without consideration of the notification procedures of the infected animals or certification of nonaffected animals. Not only veterinarians but also physicians should be aware of this problem.},

abstract={The paucibacillary nature of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been a major obstacle in the diagnosis of human tuberculous meningitis (TBM). This study shows that with molecular techniques direct precise determination to the species level of mycobacterial pathogens can be made. The present report describes the utility of a nested PCR (N-PCR) assay (A. Mishra, A. Singhal, D. S. Chauhan, V. M. Katoch, K. Srivastava, S. S. Thakral, S. S. Bharadwaj, V. Sreenivas, and H. K. Prasad, J. Clin. Microbiol. 43:5670-5678, 2005) in detecting M. tuberculosis and M. bovis in human CSF. In 2.8% (6/212) of the samples, M. tuberculosis was detected, and in 17% (36/212), M. bovis was detected. Mixed infection was observed in 22 samples. Comparative analysis of clinical diagnosis, smear microscopy, and N-PCR in 69 patients (TBM, 25; non-TBM, 44) showed that the sensitivity of N-PCR (61.5%) was greater than that of smear microscopy (38.4%). Determination to the species level is important from the viewpoint of determining the prevalence of these mycobacteria in a community and would influence strategies currently adopted for the prevention of tuberculosis.

abstract={Amongst the members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), M. tuberculosis is mainly a human pathogen, whereas M. bovis has a broad host range and is the principal agent responsible for tuberculosis (TB) in domestic and wild mammals. M. bovis also infects humans, causing zoonotic TB through ingestion, inhalation and, less frequently, by contact with mucous membranes and broken skin. Zoonotic TB is indistinguishable clinically or pathologically from TB caused by M. tuberculosis. Differentiation between the causative organisms may only be achieved by sophisticated laboratory methods involving bacteriological culture of clinical specimens, followed by typing of isolates according to growth characteristics, biochemical properties, routine resistance to pyrazinamide (PZA) and specific non-commercial nucleic acid techniques. All this makes it difficult to accurately estimate the proportion of human TB cases caused by M. bovis infection, particularly in developing countries. Distinguishing between the various members of the MTBC is essential for epidemiological investigation of human cases and, to a lesser degree, for adequate chemotherapy of the human TB patient. Zoonotic TB was formerly an endemic disease in the UK population, usually transmitted to man by consumption of raw cows' milk. Human infection with M. bovis in the UK has been largely controlled through pasteurization of cows' milk and systematic culling of cattle reacting to compulsory tuberculin tests. Nowadays the majority of the 7000 cases of human TB annually reported in the UK are due to M. tuberculosis acquired directly from an infectious person. In the period 1990-2003, between 17 and 50 new cases of human M. bovis infection were confirmed every year in the UK. This represented between 0.5% and 1.5% of all the culture-confirmed TB cases, a proportion similar to that of other industrialized countries. Most cases of zoonotic TB diagnosed in the UK are attributed to (i) reactivation of long-standing latent infections acquired before widespread adoption of milk pasteurization, or (ii) M. bovis infections contracted abroad. Since 1990, only one case has been documented in the UK of confirmed, indigenous human M. bovis infection recently acquired from an animal source. Therefore, for the overwhelming majority of the population, the risk of contracting M. bovis infection from animals appears to be extremely low. However, bovine TB is once again a major animal health problem in the UK. Given the increasing numbers of cattle herds being affected each year, physicians and other public health professionals must remember that zoonotic TB is not just a disease of the past. A significant risk of M. bovis infection remains in certain segments of the UK population in the form of (i) continuing on-farm consumption of unpasteurized cows' milk, (ii) retail sales by approved establishments of unpasteurized milk and dairy products and (iii) occupational exposure to infectious aerosols from tuberculous animals and their carcases. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The impact of bovine tuberculosis (BTB) on humans is poorly documented. However, BTB remains a major problem for livestock in developing countries particularly in Africa and wildlife is responsible for the failure of TB eradication programs. In Africa, the consumption of raw milk and raw meat, and the development of bushmeat consumption as a cheap source of proteins, represent one of the principal routes for human contaminations with BTB. The exploration of these different pathways using tools as participatory epidemiology allows the risk analysis of the impact of BTB on human health in Africa. This analysis represents a management support and decision tool in the study and the control of zoonotic BTB. © 2006 New York Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={Our laboratory has designed a specific nested-PCR (N-PCR) assay, based on the hupB gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Rv2986c) and Mycobacterium bovis (Mb3010c) as a method to differentiate these closely related species. The present paper deciphers the utility of this assay for identification of pathogenic Mycobacteria in clinical samples. Extra-pulmonary clinical samples obtained from cattle and humans were investigated. Pre-dominance of M. tuberculosis (15.7%) and M. bovis (26.8%) was seen in humans and cattle, respectively. However, more importantly, both mycobacterial pathogens (mixed infection) were identified in a number of samples. In humans 8.7% of the samples and 35.7% in cattle were classified as mixed infection. The detection of mixed infection with the mycoabcterial pathogenic duo in humans and bovines denotes the prospect of potential transmission of these pathogens from humans to cattle (zoonosis) and vice versa (reverse zoonosis). © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The authors focused on the incidence of tuberculosis transfer from animals to humans. Patients: The population living in Slovakia during 1970 - 2002. Methods: The surveillance method was used. The information was obtained through departments for tuberculosis and pulmonary diseases and verified with the data of the the registry and the data of the reference centre for tuberculosis microbiology. Results: In 2002 in Slovakia 8 new cases of disease induced by other than human type of mycobacterium were detected. None of the new diseases was caused by M. bovis. Conclusion: Longterm surveillance facilitates early detection of the symptoms of potential unfavourable changes. The experiences with migration of population and its possible consequences prompt us to alertness.},

abstract={Tuberculosis is an infectious disease that is found throughout the world and which can have a dramatic impact on the economy and on human and animal health. In humans, the principal cause of infection is Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but the animal-specific pathogen, M. bovis, is arguably the most important zoonotic agent in human history. Despite the fact that several countries have implemented control programmes for M. bovis infection in animals, which has resulted in a reduction in the number of human cases as well, recent years have witnessed a re-emergence of tuberculosis. This is due to the appearance of strains that are resistant to the main antibiotics used to treat the infection in humans, the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus, the maintenance of wild reservoirs and the persistence of the infection in livestock, particularly in developing regions. Coordinated efforts by human and animal health services, the improvement of diagnostic techniques and the development of more effective vaccines to prevent the infection are the main strategies for controlling this disease.},

They traced bacteria in municipal milk supplies, mapped the locations of infected animals, and sought regulatory power to destroy them.

Many condemned pasteurization as too costly and as masking tubercular contamination and poor sanitation. They saw milk-borne tuberculosis as an environmental as well as a bacteriological problem. Similar to other zoonotic diseases such as BSE, bovine tuberculosis blurred the boundaries between urban and rural, production and consumption, and human and animal bodies.},
