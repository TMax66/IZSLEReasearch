ABSTRACT: Today a growing number of studies are focusing on antibiotic resistance in wildlife. This is due to the potential role of wild animals as reservoirs and spreaders of pathogenic and resistant bacteria. This study focused on isolating and identifying Escherichia coli from the feces of wild animals living in the Apuan Alps Regional Park (Tuscany, Italy) and evaluating some of their antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity traits. Eighty-five fecal samples from different species were studied. Seventy-one E. coli were identified by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry analysis, subjected to antibiograms and polymerase chain reaction for the detection of antibiotic resistance genes and pathogenicity factors. The highest resistance rates were found against cephalothin (39.4%) and ampicillin (33.8%), followed by amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (15.5%), streptomycin (12.7%), and tetracycline (5.6%). Regarding resistance genes, 39.4% of the isolates were negative for all tested genes. The remaining isolates were positive for blaCMY-2, sul2, strA-strB and aadA1, tet(B), and tet(A), encoding resistance to beta-lactams, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, streptomycin, and tetracycline, respectively. With regard to virulence factors, 63.4% of the isolates were negative for all genes; 21.1% carried astA alone, which is associated with different pathotypes, 9.9% carried both escV and eaeA (aEPEC); single isolates (1.4%) harbored escV (aEPEC), escV associated with astA and eaeA (aEPEC), astA with stx2 and hlyA (EHEC) or astA and stx1, stx2, and hlyA (EHEC). These results show that wildlife from nonanthropized environments can be a reservoir for antibiotic-resistant microorganisms and suggest the need for a deeper knowledge on their origin and diffusion mechanisms through different ecological niches. © 2019 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.

ABSTRACT: Wild birds inhabit in a wide variety of environments and can travel great distances. Thus, wild birds can possibly spread antimicrobial resistance along the way, and this may represent a potential public health concern. We characterized antimicrobial resistance in fecal Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis in wild raptors in the southeastern US. Cloacal samples were collected from 118 wild raptors of 17 species from 18 counties in Alabama and 15 counties in Georgia. A total of 112 E. coli and 76 E. faecalis isolates were recovered, and we found significantly more antimicrobial-resistant E. coli (20/112, 18%) than E. faecalis (6/76, 8%; P=0.05). Five antimicrobial-resistant genes: blaTEM-1, blaCTX-M-1, tet(M), cmlA, cat, and gyrA, were identified in antimicrobial-resistant E. coli isolates. Five of 13 (38%) ampicillin-resistant E. coli harbored both bla-TEM-1 and blaCTX-M-1 genes, indicating they are extended-spectrum β-lactamase–carrying strains. Both of the tetracycline resistance genes, tet(M) and tet(L), were identified in E. faecalis isolates. Wild raptors seem to be a reservoir host of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli and E. faecalis and may represent a hazard to animal and human health by transmission of these isolates. © Wildlife Disease Association 2019.

ABSTRACT: In the past few decades, the medical community has faced a rising problem in the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and the difficulty of treating related infections. The presence of these bacteria in high-traffic bodies of water, as well as the presence of the antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) floating freely in the water, pose the threat of antibiotic-resistant related infections in individuals living and recreating in these areas of southeast Louisiana. Water samples from coastal waters of southeast Louisiana were analyzed using chemical, microbial, and molecular methods to determine the presence of ARB and ARG. The main species analyzed include Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Enterobacter spp. They were tested for resistance to carbapenem, monobactam, penicillin, tetracycline, sulfonamide, and cephalosporin antibiotics. The results indicated significant numbers of ARBs were consistently found in the coastal waters, and ARGs were found throughout testing. These results show that these high-traffic recreational bodies of water may be putting wildlife and humans at risk for antibiotic-resistant-related illnesses. © 2018 IWA Publishing.

ABSTRACT: Antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria are a threat to global health. Epidemiological studies are necessary to gain a more detailed understanding of the transmission modality of resistant bacteria to wild animals and their diffusion into the environment to ensure a broader evaluation of the epidemiological role of wildlife. The study aimed to identify little-known epidemiological aspects by focusing on the isolation of Enterobacteriaceae in order to bring knowledge on the bacterial flora of wild mammals living in the National Park of Aspromonte (Calabria, Italy). Two hundred twenty-five faecal samples of wild mammals were collected and submitted to standard bacteriological examination for Enterobacteriaceae detection. Isolates were identified by mass spectrometry MALDI-TOF (matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation - time of fligt mass spectrometry). The 30 isolates showing the highest number of resistances were screened for Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase (ESBL) production. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the bacterial isolates was performed by the disk diffusion method. Two hundred sixty-three strains were isolated. The most frequently recovered bacterial species were Hafnia alvei, Escherichia coli and Citrobacter spp. Potentially pathogenic species including Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica and Serratia marcescens have also been identified. Isolates displayed significant frequencies of antibiotic resistance. The resistance to amoxicillin (71.4%) was the most frequent, followed by amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (55.5%), ampicillin (49.8%), streptomycin (35.7%), doxycycline (16.3%), tobramycin (15.2%), tetracycline (13.3%) and gentamicin (10.6%). Nine strains showed resistance to imipenem and 1 to meropenem. All isolates were negative for the presence of ESBL-encoding genes. Wild animals can be regarded as sentinel species and used as environmental health indicators. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Escherichia coli is a major pathogen leading to systemic and enteric illnesses in wild giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). To investigate the characteristics and distribution of E. coli in wild giant pandas across four different nature reserves in Sichuan, Republic of China, we researched serotypes, phylogenetic groups, antimicrobial resistance, and resistance genes of E. coli not previously reported for wild giant pandas. A total of 82 E. coli isolates were identified from 40 fecal samples in August 2016 to May 2017. The most-prevalent serogroups were O15 (4%, 3/82), O28 (2%, 2/82), and O44 (2%, 2/82). Antimicrobial resistance was highest for streptomycin (61%, 50/82) followed by amikacin (30%, 25/82). Among the four nature reserves, the proportion of streptomycin (86%, 12/14) and amikacin (57%, 8/14) was highest in Liziping. The frequencies of resistant genes aph(30 )-IIa, ant(300 )-Ia, aac(3)-IIa, aadA1, and StrB were 28, 23, 5, 21, and 32%, respectively, while none of the strains had the tetracycline gene. In Qianfoshan, the phylogenetic group B2 was the most common, comprising the highest percentage of isolates compared with the other seven phylogenetic groups. Furthermore, many variables such as phylogenetic groups, antimicrobial susceptibility, and resistance genes differed significantly (P,0.05) among the four nature reserves. In facilitating the safe discharge of captive giant pandas into the wild, as well as to support existing wild populations, the data from this research will prove invaluable to scientists and ecologists in their endeavors. © 2018, Wildlife Disease Association, Inc..

ABSTRACT: Multi-drug-resistant Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis were isolated from the tissue samples of a giant panda. The E. coli strain SH-YH-DH that we isolated carried a self-transferable plasmid associated with multi-drug-resistant genes (bla CTX-M-55 , bla TEM-1 , sul1, floR, strB, aac(6ʹ)- Ib, and tetA/R). This strain exhibited phenotypic resistance to gentamicin, cefotaxime, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline. We report the participation of multi-drug-resistant E. coli in a extraintestinal polyinfection in giant pandas and that further research is warranted to pay attention to the threat of multi-drug-resistant bacteria in the panda population. © Wildlife Disease Association 2018.

ABSTRACT: Antimicrobial resistance was tested in Escherichia coli isolated from feces (n = 660) of red deer, roe deer, fallow deer, European bison, and wild boar shot in regional forests in Poland during two winter hunting seasons. Indicator E. coli (n = 542) was resistant against 11 of 14 tested compounds, mostly sulfamethoxazole, streptomycin, ampicillin, trimethoprim, and tetracycline (1.3-6.6% range). No significant differences were observed between boar and ruminant isolates. Most of deer and bison isolates showed no resistance. Selective screening of wildlife samples revealed 1.7% prevalence of cephalosporin-resistant E. coli found mostly in wild boars. They produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-15) and plasmid-mediated AmpC-type cephalosporinase (blaCMY-2). The majority of the isolates originated from boars shot in a narrow time frame and space; therefore, common antimicrobial selection pressure in the environment was assumed. Three E. coli isolates carried plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes (qnrS1/S3). No transferable colistin resistance mechanisms were found in two resistant E. coli. Transferability of resistance was proved in a single pAmpC-positive isolate carrying IncI1-alpha 95 kb plasmid. No cephalosporin-resistant E. coli harbored pathogenicity markers; therefore, they might be considered a vector of resistance determinants, but not a pathogen themselves. © 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2018.

ABSTRACT: Wild boars (Sus scrofa) are increasing in several European countries, including Italy. In areas with intensive animal farming, like the Italian Emilia-Romagna region, they are likely to be exposed to antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria of livestock origin. In 2017-2018, 108 mesenteric lymph nodes samples were collected from 108 wild boars hunted in Parma province, Emilia-Romagna region, to be tested for ESBL-and carbapenemase-producing Escherichia coli. One isolate (WB-21L) out of 108 (0.9%) was phenotypically confirmed as ESBL-producing E. coli. The strain WB-21L was tested by PCR for the genes bla SHV, bla CTX-M, bla TEM , bla AmpC, bla KPC, bla NDM, bla VIM, bla IMP, bla OXA-48, bla SPM, bla BIC, bla SIM, bla DIM, bla GIM, bla AIM , resulting positive for TEM β-lactamase. Resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, streptomycin, sulfasomidine, tetracycline and trimethoprim confirmed the multi-resistance nature of the strain WB-21L. Nine E.coli isolates showed resistance to meropenem by the Kirby Bauer test but none of them showed Meropenem MIC values indicative of resistance. In conclusion, the present study shows the presence of ESBL E. coli in wild boars and the possible risk of transfer to game meat handlers and consumers. Future studies are needed to better evaluate the sources of AMR bacteria in wildlife. © S. Bonardi et al., 2018.

ABSTRACT: The increased presence of clinically relevant multidrug resistant bacteria in natural environments is an emerging challenge for global health care. Little is known regarding the occurrence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-E. coli) from environmental sentinels in Pakistan. The goal of the current study was to gain insights into the prevalence and phylogenetic relationships of ESBL-E. coli recovered from wild birds in Pakistan during winter migration. After initial screening of fecal samples on selective chromogenic agar, ESBL-E.coli were analyzed phenotypically using the Vitek-2 automated system. Genotypic characterization was performed using whole genome sequencing (WGS) followed by an in-depth in silico analysis. Of 150 birds screened, 26 (17.3%) were fecal carriers of ESBL-E. coli. Of these, 88.4% isolates exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotypes. Resistance to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ampicillin, doxycycline, tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (CTX-CAZ-AM-DC-TE-SXT) represented the most common pattern of MDR (76.9%). WGS data analysis found blaCTX-M-15 as the predominant ESBL genotype (92.3%). Other genes encoding resistance to sulfonamides (sul1/sul2/sul3), aminoglycosides (strA, strB, aadA1, aadA2, aadA5, aac(3)-IId-like, aac(3)-IVa-like and aph(4)-Ia), trimethoprim (dfrA14 or dfrA17), tetracyclines [tet(A)/tet(B)], and fluoroquinolones (qnrS1) were detected commonly, often encoded on IncF-type plasmids (76.9%). ESBL-E. coli were assigned to 17 different sequence types (STs) of which ST10 and ST7097 (4 isolates each) were the most abundant followed by ST4720, ST93, and ST1139 (2 isolates each). Core-genome phylogeny of the isolates found low numbers (0-29) of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in isolates belonged to ST7097 originated from two different locations (Chashma barrage and Rasul barrage). Similar trends were found among isolates belong to ST1139.

ABSTRACT: Wetlands are known for providing important ecosystem services, such as reduction of eutrophication. However, less research has focused on public health service of wetlands: their ability to protect microbial quality of water for downstream while they attract wildlife populations. For urban surface water, transmission of antibiotic resistance is also an important concern. Under anticipated climate change scenarios, more extreme precipitation patterns are emerging. Thus, runoff and flooding from increased precipitation will impair surface water quality more significantly. The objectives of this study were to 1) evaluate the dynamics of bacteria of public health concern in urban wetlands, including: Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), Arcobacter, and two antibiotic resistance genes (sulfonamide, sul1 and tetracycline, tetQ); and 2) identify the major fecal contamination sources using microbial source tracking (MST). Water samples were collected across the urban wetlands in central Ohio from June 2013 to June 2014 and tested with a culture-based (E. coli) and quantitative PCR (the rest) methods. Since Canada geese were the most observed wildlife at the study sites and they are known to carry an array of infectious disease agents, their fecal samples were also collected. From the water samples, E. coli (fecal indicator) had the highest occurrence in 99.2% of the total samples, followed by sul1 (98.3%), Arcobacter (94.9%), STEC (74.6%), tetQ (58.5%), and Campylobacter (1.7%). Overall reduction in E. coli was 22.3% across the wetlands, but variation was observed depending on the season. Microbial source tracking suggested a high prevalence of avian- (44.9%) and ruminant- (38.1%) originated fecal contaminations (e.g., Canada geese and deer). From the geese fecal samples, STEC (93.2%) and Arcobacter (4.5%) were detected, which could potentially compromise wetlands’ functions in reductions in bacteria of public health concern and antibiotic resistance. The results suggest that careful wildlife management together with long-term monitoring of microorganisms of concern are needed for making urban wetlands as a sustainable frontline safeguard of pathogen and antibiotic resistance spread in surface water. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an important issue for both wildlife conservation and public health. The purpose of this study was to screen for AMR in fecal bacteria isolated from northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), a species that is an ecologically and economically important natural resource in the southern United States. The antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of 45 Escherichia coli isolates, 20 Enterococcus faecalis isolates, and 10 Enterococcus faecium isolates were determined using the Sensititer TM microbroth dilution minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) plate, AVIAN1F. Overall, E. coli isolates had high MIC values for the following classes of antimicrobials: Aminocoumarins, beta-lactams, lincosamides, macrolides, florfenicol, and sulfonamides. Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium isolates had high MICs for aminocyclitols, aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, lincosamides, and sulfonamides. Enterococcus faecalis isolates also showed high MICs for aminocoumarins, while E. faecium isolates had high MICs for trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline. Based on available veterinary interpretive criteria, 15% and 33% of E. coli isolates were resistant to sulphathiazole and sulphadimethoxine, respectively. Intermediate susceptibility to florfenicol was seen with 17.8% of E. coli isolates. Twenty percent of E. faecalis and 80% of E. faecium isolates were resistant to high-concentration streptomycin. One third of E. faecalis and 70% of E. faecium isolates were intermediately susceptible to erythromycin. Ten percent of E. faecium isolates were resistant to tetracycline and oxytetracycline. A comparison of available MIC suggests that AMR in wild bobwhite is less severe than in domestic poultry. Further investigation is needed to determine the source of AMR in wild bobwhite.

ABSTRACT: Free-living raptors (birds of prey) can act as reservoirs of potentially zoonotic agents, but they also can be affected by microorganisms as target hosts. In this retrospective study, microbiological results (n = 663) and antibiotic sensitivity profiles (n = 108) of bacterial isolates were analysed from diseased free-living raptors. Sixty-nine percent of cases (n = 457) yielded bacteria: 58% were in pure culture and 42% were of different species. Remarkably, samples from necropsies (47%) had higher percentage of pure isolations than those obtained from clinical (31%) samples (P < 0.001). Among bacterial isolates, Escherichia coli was the most common agent (35%), principally recovered from necropsied birds with clinical signs of septicaemia or respiratory disorders. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%) was isolated from birds with systemic infection and from oral lesions, especially in nocturnal raptors (P < 0.001). Staphylococcus spp. (5%), mainly Staphylococcus aureus, was found to be the most prevalent cause of pododermatitis (35%) and Staphylococcus hyicus was isolated from conjunctivitis (18.2%). Interestingly, 8% of samples with lesions compatible with avian tuberculosis were positive to the Mycobacterium avium complex. The most frequent fungi associated with pneumonic lesions and ingluvitis were Aspergillus spp. and Candida spp., respectively. More than 50% of the 108 isolates (34 different bacterial spp.) demonstrated resistance to clindamycin, ampicillin, tetracycline, cefuroxime, enrofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole. Among the E. coli strains, 71% (27/38) presented a multidrug-resistance pattern to >3 antimicrobials. Detection in wildlife of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens that might be significant at the animal–human–ecosystem interface is of great relevance under the ‘One Health’ approach. © 2017 Houghton Trust Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a worldwide problem with serious health and economic repercussions. Since the 1940s, underuse, overuse, and misuse of antibiotics have had a significant environmental downside. Large amounts of antibiotics not fully metabolized after use in human and veterinary medicine, and other applications, are annually released into the environment. The result has been the development and dissemination of antibiotic-resistant bacteria due to many years of selective pressure. Surveillance of AMR provides important information that helps in monitoring and understanding how resistance mechanisms develop and disseminate within different environments. Surveillance data is needed to inform clinical therapy decisions, to guide policy proposals, and to assess the impact of action plans to fight AMR. The Functional Genomics and Proteomics Unit, based at the University of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro in Vila Real, Portugal, has recently completed 10 years of research surveying AMR in bacteria, mainly commensal indicator bacteria such as enterococci and Escherichia coli from the microbiota of different animals. Samples from more than 75 different sources have been accessed, from humans to food-producing animals, pets, and wild animals. The typical microbiological workflow involved phenotypic studies followed by molecular approaches. Throughout the decade, 4,017 samples were collected and over 5,000 bacterial isolates obtained. High levels of AMR to several antimicrobial classes have been reported, including to β-lactams, glycopeptides, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, sulphonamides, and quinolones. Multi-resistant strains, some relevant to human and veterinary medicine like extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing E. coli and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, have been repeatedly isolated even in non-synanthropic animal species. Of particular relevance are reports of AMR bacteria in wildlife from natural reserves and endangered species. Future work awaits as this threatening yet unsolved problem persists. © 2016 Marinho, Santos, Gonçalves, Poeta and Igrejas.

ABSTRACT: The illegal wildlife trade may increase the risk of infectious disease transmission, and it may not only cause disease outbreaks in humans but also threaten livestock, native wild populations, and ecosystems’ health. Bird species may act as carriers in the transmission of enteric pathogens. However, epidemiological studies on zoonotic bacteria in wild birds are rare in Brazil. From March 2011 to March 2012, we investigated the frequency of Enterobacteriaceae in cloacal swab samples from 109 birds of the passerine and Psittacidae families. These birds were recovered from illegal trade in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and sent to a rehabilitation center. Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from 86 wild birds (78.9%). A mean (±SD) of 1.68 (±1.30) different bacterial species were isolated per bird, with a maximum of five bacterial species from three bird species. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli, followed by Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae and other enteric bacteria. Salmonella ser. Typhimurium was isolated from a Temminck's seedeater (Sporophila falcirostris), and two Salmonella ser. Panama were isolated from two specimens of chestnut-capped blackbird (Chrysomus ruficapillus). Of the 70 selected bacterial isolates, 60 exhibited antibiotic resistance. The resistance patterns varied from one to nine of the antibiotics tested. Resistance to ceftiofur was the most prevalent, followed by ampicillin and ceftriaxone. The dissemination potential of resistant strains in situations typically seen in the management of captive birds may become a problem for the conservation of natural bird populations and for public health. © 2016 Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia

ABSTRACT: One of the major public health problems facing the world today is the occurrence and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) in the environment. The main reservoir for ARB is the aquatic ecosystems. Culture based methods and qualitative molecular techniques were used to screen and determine the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) and ARB in three different salinity gradients of wetland marsh in the southeast Louisiana of USA. The bacteria of interest include Enterobacter cloacae/aerogenes, Enterococci spp. and Escherichia coli. The antibiotic resistance genes of interest include ermB, sul1, tetA, tetX, tetW, and mecA that are responsible for resistance to erythromycin, sulfonamide, tetracycline, and methicillin antibiotics. The water salinity ranged from 0 to 12 parts per thousand (ppt). Monthly samples were taken for a six-month period and analyzed for the presence of ARB and ARGs along with carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous levels in the water samples. The results indicated salinity did not have significant difference in the presence of ARB and ARGs in the wetlands. Significant numbers of ARB were found in all three salinity levels (0, 6, and 12 ppt) in the marshes of Southeast Louisiana. ARGs were more prevalent in site 2 with the salinity of 6 ppt followed by site 1 with the salinity of 12 ppt and site 3 with 0 ppt salinity. Bacterial load and the pollution load varied from month to month and among the three salinities. This study indicates the presence of ARB and ARGs in the wetland habitat is a cause for concern as the potential threat of the spread of ARGs into native bacteria and into fish and wildlife exists due to human activities even under high salinity habitat. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: β-Lactam antibiotics like cefotaxime are the most commonly used antibacterial agents. Escherichia coli strains 5 A, 10 A, 12 A and 23B isolated from Seagulls feces, are cefotaxime-resistant strains that produces extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Bacterial resistance to these antibiotics occurs predominantly through structural modification on the penicillin-binding proteins and enzymatic inactivation by extended-spectrum β-lactamases. Using classical proteomic techniques (2D-GE) coupled to mass spectrometry and bioinformatics extended analysis, in this study, we report several significant differences in cytoplasmic proteins expression when the strains were submitted to antibiotic stress and when the resistant strains were compared with a non-resistant strain. A total of 79 differentially expressed spots were collected for protein identification. Significant level of expression was found in antibiotic resistant proteins like β-lactamase CTX-M-1 and TEM and also in proteins related with oxidative stress. This approach might help us understand which pathways form barriers for antibiotics, another possible new pathways involved in antibiotic resistance to devise appropriate strategies for their control already recognized by the World Health Organization and the European Commission. Biological Significance This study highlights the protein differences when a resistant strain is under antibiotic pressure and how different can be a sensible and resistant strain at the protein level. This survey might help us to understand the specifics barriers for antibiotics and which pathways are involved in its resistance crosswise the wildlife. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: More than 70% of new human pathogens are zoonotic and many originate from the wildlife reservoir. Wildlife rehabilitation centres (WRC) are an easily accessible source for sample and data collection for preventive surveillance, but data collected this way may be biased. We use white storks (Ciconia ciconia) as a model to compare pathogen prevalence obtained in the field and WRC. We address factors that may affect disease prevalence data like origin, the age group and the “diseased” state of WRC admissions. In this study we compared prevalence of Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. in the digestive tract; antibodies against West Nile virus, avian influenza and Newcastle disease virus, and antimicrobial resistance patterns of E. coli between nestling and adult wild storks established in different habitats (n = 90) and storks admitted to two different WRC (n = 30) in the same region. When age groups and colonies of origin were disregarded, the mean enterobacteria (E. coli, Salmonella) and viral antibody prevalence of the wild population (n = 90) were similar to prevalence observed in the individuals admitted to WRC (n = 30). However, in fledgling juvenile storks admitted to WRC, the prevalence of Salmonella spp. (13.3%), E. coli showing resistance to cefotaxime (37.9%) and against two antimicrobials at once (41.4%) were more similar to the prevalence in stork nestlings from landfill-associated colonies (7.9%, 37.1% and 48.6%, respectively for prevalence of Salmonella spp. and E. coli displaying, cefotaxime resistance and resistance against two antimicrobials), and significantly higher than in colonies located in natural habitats (0%; 10.5% and 15.8%, respectively). Thus, pathogen surveillance in individuals from an abundant species admitted to WRC is useful to monitor overall mean prevalence, but for certain pathogens may not be sufficient to detect differences between local populations. In addition, the ecology of the tested species and the specific temporal, spatial and age group distribution of WRC admissions have to be taken into account. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Objectives: To describe the prevalence and diversity of IncX plasmids with antibiotic resistance genes in Enterobacteriaceae and to identify the most disseminated lineages of the plasmid family. Methods: IncX plasmids were screened in 1894 Enterobacteriaceae isolates resistant to cefotaxime (2 mg/L) or with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (0.05 mg/L) obtained from various sources in five continents using PCR. IncX plasmid-harbouring isolates were identified using MALDI-TOF or biochemical tests, and screened for antibiotic resistance genes using PCR and sequencing; their clonality was determined by PFGE. Horizontal transfer of plasmids was tested using transformation and conjugation. IncX plasmids were characterized by S1-nuclease and PFGE, RFLP and hybridization. Results: A total of 164 Escherichia coli isolates (8.7%, n = 1894) carried at least one IncX subgroup. Seven isolates harboured two distinct subgroups. IncX1 subgroup was found in 93 isolates, followed by IncX2 (35 isolates), IncX4 (28) and IncX3 (15). IncX4 plasmids were not transferred horizontally as single plasmids and therefore excluded from further analysis. The most disseminated lineages of IncX plasmids included IncX1 harbouring qnrS1 and blaTEM-1,-135 found in 36 E. coli from different sources in Europe and Australia and IncX2 carrying qnrS1 and tet(A) detected in nine E. coli from wildlife in Europe. IncX3 plasmids harboured predominantly blaSHV-12 and qnrS1 or qnrB7. Conclusions: IncX plasmids were widely distributed in E. coli from wildlife in Europe and were predominantly associated with fluoroquinolone resistance genes. Plasmids showing indistinguishable restriction profiles were identified in E. coli from different sources and countries suggesting wide dissemination of certain plasmid lineages. © The Author 2016.

ABSTRACT: The epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance is extremely complex and involves humans, domestic animals (companion and agricultural) and wildlife. In North America there have been very few investigations targeting antimicrobial-resistant organisms in wildlife. In this study, we characterized the susceptibility of Escherichia coli isolated from 75 birds including great horned owls, crows and American robins from the region of Saskatoon, Canada. The recovery rate of E. coli varied significantly between species from 44·8% of robins to 92% of crows. The majority (88·2%) of colonized birds carried only pan-susceptible organisms. Among isolates resistant to at least one antimicrobial, ampicillin resistance was most commonly identified. Three birds carried multidrug-resistant isolates (resistant to ≥3 drug classes), and extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms (CTX-M-15 and SHV2a) were grown from two. We identified a significant relationship between the presence of drug-resistant E. coli and an urban (vs rural) origin of the bird. Our findings suggest that crows, due to their ubiquity and high rate of colonization with E. coli, may be efficient targets for future resistance surveillance studies targeting urban wildlife. Significance and Impact of the Study: Antimicrobial resistance is a global problem affecting people and animals. Few investigations describing the presence drug-resistant organisms in wildlife in North America have been published. In this study, resistant Escherichia coli, including extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing strains, were isolated from wild birds in the Saskatoon region of Canada. We found that the recovery rate of E. coli varied significantly by species and was highest among crows. There was also a significant association between drug resistance and urban vs rural birds. Our results suggest that crows may be a good target for future studies investigating antimicrobial resistance in urban wildlife. © 2016 The Society for Applied Microbiology

ABSTRACT: At a human/livestock/wildlife interface, Escherichia coli populations were used to assess the risk of bacterial and antibiotic resistance dissemination between hosts. We used phenotypic and genotypic characterization techniques to describe the structure and the level of antibiotic resistance of E. coli commensal populations and the resistant Enterobacteriaceae carriage of sympatric African buffalo (Syncerus caffer caffer) and cattle populations characterized by their contact patterns in the southern part of Hwange ecosystem in Zimbabwe. Our results (i) confirmed our assumption that buffalo and cattle share similar phylogroup profiles, dominated by B1 (44.5%) and E (29.0%) phylogroups, with some variability in A phylogroup presence (from 1.9 to 12%); (ii) identified a significant gradient of antibiotic resistance from isolated buffalo to buffalo in contact with cattle and cattle populations expressed as the Murray score among Enterobacteriaceae (0.146, 0.258, and 0.340, respectively) and as the presence of tetracycline-, trimethoprim-, and amoxicillin-resistant subdominant E. coli strains (0, 5.7, and 38%, respectively); (iii) evidenced the dissemination of tetracycline, trimethoprim, and amoxicillin resistance genes (tet, dfrA, and blaTEM-1) in 26 isolated subdominant E. coli strains between nearby buffalo and cattle populations, that led us (iv) to hypothesize the role of the human/ animal interface in the dissemination of genetic material from human to cattle and toward wildlife. The study of antibiotic resistance dissemination in multihost systems and at anthropized/natural interface is necessary to better understand and mitigate its multiple threats. These results also contribute to attempts aiming at using E. coli as a tool for the identification of pathogen transmission pathway in multihost systems. © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

ABSTRACT: Increasing interactions between humans, domestic animals and wildlife may result in inter-species transmission of infectious agents. To evaluate the presence of pathogenic E. coli and Salmonella spp. and to test the antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates, rectal swabs from 36 different free-ranging wild mammals were taken from two distinct natural sites in Brazil: Cantareira State Park (CSP, state of São Paulo) and Santa Isabel do Rio Negro Region (SIRNR, state of Amazonas). The swabs were randomly collected and processed for bacterial isolation, identification, characterization and antimicrobial resistance. Eighteen E. coli strains from CSP and 20 from SIRNR were recovered from 14 and 22 individuals, respectively. Strains from animals captured in CSP, the site with the greatest anthropization, exhibited a higher range and percentage of virulence genes, including an eae+/bfpA+ strain. Antimicrobial resistance was verified in strains originating from both sites; however, in strains from SIRNR, aminopenicillins were almost the exclusive antimicrobial class to which strains exhibited resistance, whereas in CSP there were strains resistant to cephalosporins, sulfonamide, aminoglycoside, tetracycline and fluoroquinolone, in addition to strains exhibiting multidrug resistance. Two strains of Salmonella enterica that are known to be associated with reptiles, serotypes Belem and 60:r:e,n,z15, were recovered only from Amazonian animals and showed susceptibility to all classes of antimicrobials that were tested. Although the potential impact of these pathogens on wildlife remains unknown, bacteria isolated from free-ranging wild animals may provide relevant information about environmental health and should therefore be more deeply studied. © 2015, Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia.

ABSTRACT: The emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria in natural environments is a major concern with serious implications for human and animal health. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of AMR Escherichia coli (E. coli) in wild birds and mammalian species. Thirty faecal samples were collected from each of the following wildlife species: herring gulls (Larus argentatus), black-headed gulls (Larus ridibundus), lesser black-back gulls (Larus fuscus), hybrid deer species (Cervus elaphus x Cervus nippon) and twenty-six from starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). A total of 115 E. coli isolates were isolated from 81 of 146 samples. Confirmed E. coli isolates were tested for their susceptibility to seven antimicrobial agents by disc diffusion. In total, 5.4% (8/146) of samples exhibited multidrug-resistant phenotypes. The phylogenetic group and AMR-encoding genes of all multidrug resistance isolates were determined by PCR. Tetracycline-, ampicillin- and streptomycin-resistant isolates were the most common resistant phenotypes. The following genes were identified in E. coli: blaTEM, strA, tet(A) and tet(B). Plasmids were identified in all samples that exhibited multidrug-resistant phenotypes. This study indicates that wild birds and mammals may function as important host reservoirs and potential vectors for the spread of resistant bacteria and genetic determinants of AMR. © 2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

ABSTRACT: Antimicrobial resistance is a worldwide concern of public health. Unfortunately, resistant bacteria are spreading to all ecosystems, including the strictly protected ones. We investigated antimicrobial resistance in gastrointestinal Enterobacteriaceae of wild mammals and people living within Dzangha-Sangha Protected Areas, Central African Republic, with an emphasis on extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes. We compare resistance genes found in microbiota of humans, gorillas habituated and unhabituated to humans and other wildlife. In gorillas, we additionally investigate the presence of ESBL resistant isolates after treatment by ceftiofur. We found a considerable prevalence of multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates with ESBL and PMQR genes in humans (10% and 31%, respectively). Among wildlife the most significant findings were CTX-M-15-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in a habituated gorilla and a multiresistant Escherichia coli isolate with gene qepA in an unhabituated gorilla. Other isolates from wildlife were mostly represented by qnrB-harboring Citrobacter spp. The relatedness of resistant E. coli was investigated in a PFGE-based dendrogram; isolates from gorillas showed less than 80% similarity to each other and less than 80% similarity to human isolates. No ESBL-producing isolates were found in animals treated by ceftiofur. Although we did not detect any bacterial clone common to wildlife and humans, we detected an intersection in the spectrum of resistance genes found in humans and gorillas, represented by blaCTX-M-15 and qepA. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Enteric bacteria are considered important potential pathogens in avian clinical medicine, causing either primary or opportunistic infections. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of enterobacteria in the intestinal microbiota of psittacine birds and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of the Escherichia coli isolates cultured. Fecal samples were collected from 300 parrots captured from the illegal wildlife trade in Goiás, Brazil and were processed using conventional bacteriological procedures. A total of 508 isolates were obtained from 300 fecal samples: 172 E. coli (33.9% of isolates; 57.3% of individuals); 153 Enterobacter spp. (30.1% of isolates; 51.0% of individuals); 89 Klebsiella spp. (17.7% of isolates; 29.7% of individuals); 59 Citrobacter spp. (11.6% of isolates; 19.7% of individuals), 21 Proteus vulgaris (4.2% of isolates; 7.0% of individuals), 5 Providencia alcalifaciens (0.98% of isolates; 1.67% of individuals), 5 Serratia sp. (0.98% of isolates; 1.67% of individuals), 3 Hafnia aivei (0.59% of isolates; 1.00% of individuals), and 1 Salmonella sp. (0.20% of isolates; 0.33% of individuals). Escherichia coli isolates were subsequently tested for susceptibility to the following antibiotics: amoxicillin (70.93% of the isolates were resistant), ampicillin (75.58%), ciprofloxacin (23.25%), chloramphenicol (33.14%), doxycycline (64.53%), enrofloxacin (41.28%), tetracycline (69.19%), and sulfonamide (71.51%). Multi-resistance to three and four groups of antibiotics occurred in 40 samples (23.25%) and 4 samples (2.32%), respectively. These results demonstrate that illegally traded birds are carriers of potentially pathogenic bacteria, including E. coli strains with antimicrobial resistance.

ABSTRACT: This study examined the distribution of antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli and E. coli O157 isolated from water, sediment and biofilms in an intensive agricultural watershed (Elk Creek, British Columbia) between 2005 and 2007. It also examined physical and chemical water parameters associated with antibiotic resistance. Broth microdilution techniques were used to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for E. coli (n = 214) and E. coli O157 (n = 27) recovered isolates for ampicillin, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin and tetracycline. Both E. coli and E. coli O157 isolates showed highest frequency of resistance to tetracycline, ampicillin, streptomycin and nalidixic acid; respectively. For E. coli, the highest frequency of resistance was observed at the most agriculturally-impacted site, while the lowest frequency of resistance was found at the headwaters. Sediment and river rock biofilms were the most likely to be associated with resistant E. coli, while water was the least likely. While seasonality (wet versus dry) had no relationship with resistance frequency, length of biofilm colonization of the substratum in the aquatic environment only affected resistance frequency to nalidixic acid and tetracycline. Multivariate logistic regressions showed that water depth, nutrient concentrations, temperature, dissolved oxygen and salinity had statistically significant associations with frequency of E. coli resistance to nalidixic acid, streptomycin, ampicillin and tetracycline. The results indicate that antibiotic resistant E. coli and E. coli O157 were prevalent in an agricultural stream. Since E. coli is adept at horizontal gene transfer and prevalent in biofilms and sediment, where ample opportunities for genetic exchange with potential environmental pathogens present themselves, resistant isolates may present a risk to ecosystem, wildlife and public health. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Increased overlap between humans and wildlife populations has increased the risk for novel disease emergence. Detecting contacts with a high risk for transmission of pathogens requires the identification of dependable measures of microbial exchange.We evaluated antibiotic resistance as a molecular marker for the intensity of human-wildlife microbial connectivity in the Galápagos Islands. We isolated Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica from the feces of land iguanas (Conolophus sp.), marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus), giant tortoises (Geochelone nigra), and seawater, and tested these bacteria with the use of the disk diffusion method for resistance to 10 antibiotics. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were found in reptile feces from two tourism sites (Isla Plaza Sur and La Galapaguera on Isla San Cristóbal) and from seawater close to a public use beach near Puerto Baquerizo Moreno on Isla San Cristóbal. No resistance was detected at two protected beaches on more isolated islands (El Miedo on Isla Santa Fe and Cape Douglas on Isla Fernandina) and at a coastal tourism site (La Lobería on Isla San Cristóbal). Eighteen E. coli isolates from three locations, all sites relatively proximate to a port town, were resistant to ampicillin, doxycycline, tetracycline, and trimethoprin/sulfamethoxazole. In contrast, only five S. enterica isolates showed a mild decrease in susceptibility to doxycycline and tetracycline from these same sites (i.e., an intermediate resistance phenotype), but no clinical resistance was detected in this bacterial species. These findings suggest that reptiles living in closer proximity to humans potentially have higher exposure to bacteria of human origin; however, it is not clear from this study to what extent this potential exposure translates to ongoing exchange of bacterial strains or genetic traits. Resistance patterns and bacterial exchange in this system warrant further investigation to understand better how human associations influence disease risk in endemic Gala ́pagos wildlife. © Wildlife Disease Association 2012.

ABSTRACT: Wild rodents can be carriers of antimicrobial resistant Escherichia coli. As rodents are known to be involved in the transmission of bacteria of human and animal health concern, they could likewise contribute to the dissemination of antimicrobial resistant bacteria in the environment. The aim of this study was therefore to get first insights into the antimicrobial resistance status among E. coli isolated from wild small mammals in rural areas. We tested 188 faecal isolates from eight rodent and one shrew species originating from Germany. Preselected resistant isolates were screened by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing or agar diffusion test and subsequent PCR analysis of resistance genes. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistant isolates was low with only 5.5% of the isolates exhibiting resistant phenotypes against at least one antimicrobial compound including beta-lactams, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides and sulfonamides.These results suggest a minor role of wild rodents from rural areas in the cycle of transmission and spread of antimicrobial resistant E. coli into the environment. Nevertheless E. coli with multiple antimicrobial resistances were significantly more often detected in wildlife rodents originating from areas with high livestock density suggesting a possible transmission from livestock to wild rodents. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Escherichia coli is a bacteria of the Enterobacteriacea family and it is part of the enterical microflora of mammals and of many species of birds. Salmonella spp. also belongs to the family Enterobacteriacea, it is responsible for human feed toxinfection outbreaks and usually isolated from domestic and wild birds. The present study analyzed the frequency of both agents in Psittaciformes in rehabilitation process for wildlife reintroduction. In 89 birds analyzed, 19% were infected with E. coli and 1,12% with Salmonella spp. It was carried out an analysis of the profile of antibiotic resistance in which was observed the efficiency of estreptomicin, tetraciclin, trimetoprim and gentamicin over the samples. The samples of E. coli were submitted to the Congo Red Binding test and to the Hemolisis test and 70,6% of positive samples for the first test and 53% for the second one were observed.

ABSTRACT: Bacterial antimicrobial resistance is a well recognized problem for human and animal health. Evaluation of antimicrobial resistance in enteric microbiota is a owerful tool to monitor selective pressure from drugs used for treating animal and human infectious diseases, or from compounds used in farming practices for ophylaxis. Screening antibiotic susceptibility patterns of wildlife animal isolates provides useful information on environmental contamination by resistant strains, deriving from contaminated effluents or from free-ranging animals that are potential vectors of resistance determinants. Recently, we examined the antimicrobial resistance of Escherichia coli (n=7) and Enterococcus spp. (n=26) isolates obtained from 35 fecal samples from Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra Linnaeus, 1758) free-living in Pego do Altar and Monte Novo reservoirs and associated river stretches in Alentejo region, South Portugal. The 12 antimicrobials, tested as recommended in the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines, belonged to different antimicrobial drug classes, acting through inhibition of transduction (n=6), cell wall synthesis (n=4), DNA gyrase (n=1) and folate synthesis (n=1). Levels of resistance were different for the two bacterial genera considered. All E. coli isolates were susceptible to 5 of the antimicrobials tested, while none of Enterococcus spp. isolates was susceptible to all compounds. All enterococci were esistant to cephalexin, cephotaxim, enrofloxacin and streptomycin. With exception of one E. coli isolate, all bacteria presented a multiresistant profile, being resistant to more than one antimicrobial drug class.The animals sampled were not likely to have been subject to antibiotherapy. Therefore, low resistance levels were expected, since antimicrobial treatment exposure is still considered the major reason for emergence, selection, and dissemination of resistant bacteria. The multiresistant profile found in most isolates supports the hypothesis that environmental exposure of intestinal microbiota to antimicrobial agents may select for resistant bacterial strains, but the occurrence of point mutations or acquisition of transmissible mobile DNA elements responsible for antimicrobial resistance must also be taken into consideration. The antimicrobial resistance profile of E. coli and Enterococcus spp. isolates from otters' fecal samples may provide useful information to assess the potential of antimicrobial resistance transmission from the environment contaminated by humans and domestic and wild animals, being particularly relevant in dams and rivers where human activities, such as farming or outdoor recreational activities, occur near or in the water. Resistance profiles should be taken upon consideration in future plans regarding management and conservation of otters, particularly in environments where cattle density near aquatic systems is high. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

ABSTRACT: A total of 133 E. coli strains isolated from different food animals and wildlife sources in Sarawak, Malaysia were screened to determine their antibiotic-resistance pattern using the disk diffusion methods. The animal sources were broiler and village chickens, cattle, bats and rodents. All E. coli isolates were tested for their resistance patterns towards 12 commonly used antibiotics: ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, neomycin, nitrofurantoin, ofloxacin, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tetracycline. In general, the most frequently encountered form of resistance in all samples was resistance to tetracycline (41.35%) and sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim (19.55%). Low levels of resistance were for gentamicin, nitrofurantoin and ofloxacin, which demonstrated less than 7% resistance of the total samples being assessed. The Multiple Antibiotic Resistance (MAR) indices were highest for broiler chicken isolates (0.479) and low for bat isolates (0.013). All isolates from both broiler chicken samples were multidrug-resistant E. coli. A high percentage of the isolates from bat (84.62%) and rodent (68.57%) samples were not resistant (totally susceptible) to all the antibiotics tested. The results in this study thus suggest that wildlife do not present a high risk of spreading antibiotic-resistant E. coli to the environment. The higher value of MAR indices as well as prevalence of multiple-resistance patterns of E. coli isolates from food animals demonstrated that indiscriminate use of antibiotics should be discouraged in food animals to overcome future resistance problem. © 2008 Academic Journals Inc.

ABSTRACT: Antimicrobial resistance to a panel of ten agents was determined by the disc diffusion technique for 83 Escherichia coli isolates, 29 Enterococcus faecium isolates and 62 Enterococcus faecalis isolates from faecal samples of apparently healthy pastoral cattle in the wildlife/livestock interface areas. Of all the E. coli isolates, 8% were diarrhoeagenic E. coli strains, 6% were enteropathogenic E. coli strains and 2% were enterotoxigenic E. coli strains. A high frequency of E. coli resistance to penicillin, erythromycin, cotrimoxazole and nitrofurantoin was observed. Enterococci showed the highest percentage of resistance to gentamycin, amoxycillin, ampicillin and tetracycline. None of the E. coli strains and Enterococci strains was resistant to tetracycline and vancomycin respectively. The results of this study underscore the presence of an animal reservoir of antibiotic resistant microorganisms that have the potential to enter the food chain.

ABSTRACT: Public pressure to reduce or eliminate antimicrobials as ingredients of feed for poultry and other agricultural animals is mounting, primarily due to the fear of multidrug-resistant bacteria in clinical infections in both animals and humans. Exploration of the occurrence of antibiotic resistance in the gut flora of wildlife avian flocks that presumptively do not receive antimicrobials will determine the rate of resistance in a naïve population. Fecal samples collected from a healthy population of the yellow-headed blackbirds (YHB) (Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus) in North Dakota were cultured to determine what genera and species of gram-negative facultative anaerobic bacteria these wild birds carry in their intestinal flora and to evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles. Isolates of Escherichia coli were further characterized for the presence of putative virulence factors and for pathogenic potential using the chicken embryo lethality assay (ELA). The ELA was performed in chicken embryos with challenges at both 12 days and 16 days of incubation to determine whether the 16-day-old embryos were better able to fight the infection and subsequent disease and also to determine whether the ELA could distinguish between primary and secondary avian Escherichia coli pathogens. After screening 33 isolates from the 21 fecal samples, only two E. coli isolates were identified. The predominant genus and species of bacterium identified was Pantoea agglomerans. Collectively, 12 of the 33 isolates (36%) exhibited no resistance to any antimicrobial tested. However, several multidrug-resistant isolates of varying genera were identified. Among the antimicrobial resistances observed, the most common was to ampicillin (60%), followed by cephalothin (33%). Neither E. coli isolate belonged to serogroups that are notorious for causing major outbreaks of colibacillosis in poultry, and only one E. coli isolate retained resistance to any antibiotics; nevertheless, the ELA results indicate that at least one of these E. coli may be a primary pathogen of chickens. This study demonstrates that antibiotic resistance occurs in the gut flora of natural populations of YHB despite the absence of antibiotic pressure. In addition, these results indicate that YHB will harbor E. coli isolates that are potentially pathogenic in poultry. However, these E. coli isolates are not a significant reservoir for multiple antibiotic resistances nor are they widespread in the population of YHB surveyed in North Dakota.

ABSTRACT: The impact on wildlife health of the increase in the use of antimicrobial agents with the intensification of livestock production remains unknown. The composition, richness and prevalence of cloacal microflora as well as bacterial resistance to antibiotics in nestlings and full-grown Egyptian vultures Neophron percnopterus were assessed in four areas of Spain in which the degree of farming intensification differs. Differences in diet composition, especially the role of stabled livestock carrion, appear to govern the similarities of bacterial flora composition among continental populations, while the insular vulture population (Fuerteventura, Canary Islands) showed differences attributed to isolation. Evidence of a positive relationship between the consumption of stabled livestock carrion and bacterial resistance to multiple antibiotics was found. Bacterial resistance was high for semisynthetic penicillins and enrofloxacin, especially in the area with the most intensive stabled livestock production. The pattern of antibiotic resistance was similar for the different bacterial species within each area. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics may be determined by resistance of bacteria present in the livestock meat remains that constituted the food of this species, as indicated by the fact that resistance to each antibiotic was correlated in Escherichia coli isolated from swine carrion and Egyptian vulture nestlings. In addition, resistance in normal faecal bacteria (present in the microflora of both livestock and vultures) was higher than in Staphylococcus epidermidis, a species indicator of the transient flora acquired presumably through the consumption of wild rabbits. Potential negative effects of the use of antimicrobials in livestock farming included the direct ingestion of these drug residues and the effects of bacterial antibiotic resistance on the health of scavengers. © 2007 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: A repeated cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the patterns of antimicrobial resistance in 1,286 Escherichia coli strains isolated from human septage, wildlife, domestic animals, farm environments, and surface water in the Red Cedar watershed in Michigan. Isolation and identification of E. coli were done by using enrichment media, selective media, and biochemical tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing by the disk diffusion method was conducted for neomycin, gentamicin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, ofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, ampicillin, nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, cephalothin, and sulfisoxazole. Resistance to at least one antimicrobial agent was demonstrated in isolates from livestock, companion animals, human septage, wildlife, and surface water. In general, E. coli isolates from domestic species showed resistance to the largest number of antimicrobial agents compared to isolates from human septage, wildlife, and surface water. The agents to which resistance was demonstrated most frequently were tetracycline, cephalothin, sulfisoxazole, and streptomycin. There were similarities in the patterns of resistance in fecal samples and farm environment samples by animal, and the levels of cephalothin-resistant isolates were higher in farm environment samples than in fecal samples. Multidrug resistance was seen in a variety of sources, and the highest levels of multidrug-resistant E. coli were observed for swine fecal samples. The fact that water sample isolates were resistant only to cephalothin may suggest that the resistance patterns for farm environment samples may be more representative of the risk of contamination of surface waters with antimicrobial agent-resistant bacteria.

ABSTRACT: Thermotolerant fecal indicator organisms carried by migratory waterfowl may serve as reservoirs of antibiotic resistance. To determine the extent to which such antibiotic resistance markers were present in migratory Canada geese (Branta canadensis) on the Maryland Eastern Shore, we isolated Enterococcus spp. and Escherichia coli from fresh feces and examined the antibiotic resistance profiles of these bacteria. Samples were obtained in October 2002, January 2003, and March 2003. Thermotolerant E. coli counts ranged from 0 to 1.0×107 colony forming units (CFU)/0.1g (g-1) wet weight of feces, whereas Enterococcus spp. counts ranged from 1.0×102-1.0×107 CFU g-1 wet weight of feces. Primary isolates of each indicator organism were tested against a panel of 10 antibiotics. Greater than 95% of E. coli isolates were resistant to penicillin G, ampicillin, cephalothin, and sulfathiazole; no E. coli were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Enterococcal isolates showed highest resistance to cephalothin, streptomycin, and sulfathiazole; no enterococci were resistant to chloramphenicol. The tetracyclines, streptomycin, and gentamycin provided the greatest discrimination among E. coli isolates; chlortetracycline, cephalothin, and gentamycin resistance patterns provided the greatest discrimination between enterococcal strains. Multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) profiles were calculated: fall (E. coli = 0.499; enterococci = 0.234), winter (E. coli = 0.487; enterococci = 0.389), and spring (E. coli = 0.489; enterococci = 0.348). E. faecalis and E. faecium, which are recognized human nosocomial pathogens, were cultured from winter (44 and 56%, respectively) and spring (13 and 31%, respectively) fecal samples. © Wildlife Disease Association 2005.

ABSTRACT: Fecal pollution from nonhuman (pets, livestock or wildlife) and human sources is often one of the major factors associated with urbanization that contribute to the degradation of water quality. Methods to differentiate animal from human sources of fecal coliform contamination could assist resource managers in developing strategies to protect shellfish harvesting areas and recreational waters. In this study, surface water samples were collected from both a developed and an undeveloped watershed in coastal South Carolina. Influent and effluent samples from several wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the same area were also collected. Most Probable Numbers (MPNs) of fecal coliforms were determined for all samples. Escherichia coli isolates were analyzed for antibiotic resistance (AR) to 10 antibiotics. Then, AR indices (no. of resistant/total no. of antibiotics tested), were calculated for each isolate and site. Results indicated that MPNs from the WWTP samples were significantly higher than those from the developed watershed which were significantly higher than those from the undeveloped watershed (p<0.0001). The AR analyses suggested that there was a trend toward increased antibiotic resistance in samples for the urbanized Broad Creek (BC) watershed. In the Okatee River (OR), E. coli isolates from three sites (20%) showed resistance to a single antibiotic (penicillin) but in BC, isolates from seven sites (47%) were resistant to multiple antibiotics, and the predominant resistance pattern was chlortetracycline-oxytetracycline-tetracycline. Raw sewage isolates from most WWTPs contained E. coli that exhibited resistance to multiple antibiotics. Cluster analysis indicated that all resistant OR sites had antibiotic resistant isolates that matched AR patterns found in isolates from WWTPs. Similarly, six of the seven sites in BC had AR patterns that matched with resistance patterns in WWTPs. These results suggest that AR testing may be a useful tool for differentiating E. coli from human and wildlife sources. Further testing of bacterial isolates from known animal sources is necessary to better assess the utility of this approach.

ABSTRACT: Antibiograms of Escherichia coli isolates from free-ranging and captive wildlife (mammals, avian and reptiles) were determined using the disc diffusion method; the prevalence of enteropathogenic serogroups amongst isolates was also investigated. Out of a total of 472 isolates of E. coli tested using 8 antimicrobial agents, 451 (95.6%) exhibited resistance to one or more antimicrobial agents. Resistance was high to cephalothin (88.1%), moderate to ampicillin (34.3%), streptomycin (33.7%) and neomycin (22.1%) and relatively low to chloramphenicol (7.8%) and gentamycin (6.8%), regardless of source. Prevalence of resistance amongst E. coli isolates from captive mammals was statistically significantly (P&lt;0.0; χ2) higher than for isolates from free-ranging mammals to streptomycin, sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SXT), and chloramphenicol. However, the prevalence of resistance amongst E. coli isolates from free-ranging mammals, was significantly (P&lt;0.05; χ2) higher than those from captive mammals for ampicillin and cephalothin. Eshierichia coli isolates from racing pigeons were statistically significantly (P&lt;0.01; χ2) and more resistant than isolates from wild birds for ampicillin, streptomycin, nalidixic acid, sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim and chloramphenicol. Prevalence of resistance amongst E. coli isolates from captive birds were, however, statistically significantly (P&lt;0.05; χ2) lower than those of isolates from wild birds for ampicillin, neomycin and gentamicin. Amongst 200 randomly selected E. coli isolates tested, 46 (23.0%) belong to enteropathogenic serogroups, with 22 (11.0%), 21 (10.5%) and 3 (1.5%) agglutinated by E. coli polyvalent antiserum serogroups A, B and C, respectively. The prevalence of enteropathogenic serogroups amongst E. coli isolates from free-ranging mammals (20.4%) was statistically significantly (P&lt;0.05; χ2) lower than those found in isolates from captive mammals (48.0%). Similarly, E. coli isolates from wild birds had a statistically significantly (P&lt;0.05; χ2) higher (50%) frequency of enteropathogenic serogroups than isolates from either racing pigeons (7.4%) or captive birds (12.5%). It was concluded that the high prevalence of resistance to antimicrobial agents amongst. E. coli isolates poses potential therapeutic problems to captive wildlife, while the occurrence of enteropathogenic serogroups amongst isolates could pose a health hazard to consumers of wildlife meat.
