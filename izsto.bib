abstract={The present study aimed at verifying labelling compliance to the current EU legislation, as well as the products' identity against substitution incidents, of processed herring currently available on the Italian market. Totally, one hundred and twenty-two herring samples including whole smoked exemplars, smoked fillets, pickled and canned products were collected. The labels were analyzed against the requirements of Regulation No.1169/2011 and No. 1379/2013 and the product identity was verified by the use of a full and a mini-DNA barcoding protocol. Shortcomings and labelling issue included the absence of a clear allergens highlight in 9.8% of the products analyzed, the incomplete mention to the catching area and the lack of fishing gear declaration in 40% and 33% of the products falling within the scope of Regulation No. 1379/2013. The COI barcodes selected in the study allowed the univocal species identification of all the products which were confirmed belonging to the species Clupea harengus. The substantial labelling compliance and the absence of mislabelling incidents confirmed a high level of food business operators training and control along the herring supply chain and a strong will to protect and enhance the consumers’ informed choice. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Since 2005, two cases of natural bovine spongiform encephalopathies (BSE) have been reported in goats. Furthermore, experimental transmissions of classical (C-BSE) and atypical (L-BSE) forms of BSE in goats were also reported. To minimize further spreading of prion diseases in small ruminants the development of a highly sensitive and specific test for ante-mortem detection of infected animals would be of great value. Recent studies reported high diagnostic value of a second generation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Real-Time Quaking-Induced Conversion (RT-QuIC) assay across a wide spectrum of human prions. Here, we applied this improved QuIC (IQ-CSF) for highly efficient detection of TSEs prion protein in goat cerebrospinal fluid. IQ-CSF sensitivity and specificity were evaluated on CSF samples collected at disease endpoint from goats naturally and experimentally infected with scrapie or bovine isolates of C-BSE and L-BSE, respectively. Next, CSF samples collected from L-BSE infected goats during pre-symptomatic stage were also analysed. PrP L-BSE associated seeding activity was detected at early time points after experimental inoculation, with an average time of 439 days before clinical symptoms appeared. Taken together these data are indicative of the great potential of this in vitro prion amplification assay as ante-mortem TSE test for live and asymptomatic small ruminants. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={Between 2015 and the beginning of 2018 (January-March), 30 cetaceans were found stranded along the Ligurian Sea coast of Italy. Necropsies were performed in 22 cases and infectious diseases resulted the most common cause of death. Three striped dolphins, showed a severe coinfection involving the monophasic variant of Salmonella Typhimurium (Salmonella 1,4,[5],12:i:-). The isolates were characterized based on antimicrobial resistance, Multiple-Locus Variable-number tandem-repeat Analysis (MLVA) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). All isolates demonstrated the same multidrug resistant genotype (ASSuT isolates), showed three different MLVA profiles, two of which closely related, and were identified as Sequence Type 34. Moreover, Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) analysis confirmed strong correlations between two out of the three isolates. To our knowledge, S. 1,4,[5],12:i:-, one of the most common serovars in cases of human infection and food sources worldwide, has not previously been described in marine mammals, and reports of Salmonella-associated disease in free-ranging cetaceans are rare. These results highlight the role of cetaceans as sentinel species for zoonotic and terrestrial pathogens in the marine environment, suggest a potential risk for cetaceans and public health along the North Western Italian coastline and indicate cetaceans as a novel potential reservoir for one of the most widespread Salmonella serovars. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={Rare earth elements (REEs), also called lanthanides, are emerging contaminants worldwide, due to their unique physical and chemical characteristics that make them essential in a variety of industrial applications. However, there is still a gap in the knowledge of occurrence and accumulation of REEs in biota, and no investigations have yet been performed in penguin feathers, which have already been widely utilized as a non-invasive tool for the biomonitoring of trace elements. The concentrations of 16 REEs were investigated in a colony of Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti)housed at the Acquario di Cattolica (Italy). Multielement determination of REEs was performed by an Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer after a microwave digestion of feathers. As this colony lives indoors in a controlled environment, it was the ideal choice for studying lanthanide occurrence in penguin feathers. Since there is a strict link between metal levels in feathers and the diet of penguins, their food (capelin)was also tested for REEs. Chondrite normalized values revealed the same pattern for REEs in feathers and fish, but REE concentrations were an order of magnitude higher in penguin feathers, demonstrating the suitability of this tissue as a bioindicator of REEs. © 2019},

abstract={Fighting food frauds is a ceaseless challenge because of the constant evolution of fraudulent practices and for the consequences both on consumers’ and on globalized trade. In Italy fish is a vulnerable commodity for frauds thanks to the high national production, importation and consumption and it is important to monitor the entire food chain in order to detect and prevent fraudulent actions, such as species substitutions, which is considered the most common fraud in seafood. Aim of this study was to realise a targeted Monitoring Plan to estimate the prevalence of fish species substitutions in Italy. As a first step, Italian fish supply chain, from production to selling, was analysed, in order to identify products and chain points at risk, by reviewing literature and by involving, in two focus groups, food inspectors and representatives of the large scale food distribution system. Then a monitoring plan was designed by sampling three fish species considered at major risk for their economic value and/or large consumption, i.e. tuna, grouper and flat fishes, at different selling points (wholesale markets, retail markets, fish shops and supermarkets). From February to March 2017, 242 samples from fresh, frozen or transformed whole fishes or fillets were sampled in 13 Italian cities (5 in Northern Italy, 2 in Central Italy, 3 in Southern Italy and 3 in the main Islands). Samples were analysed by “FINS” (Forensically Informative Nucleotide Sequencing), using two markers: cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene (COI) as first option and then mitochondrial cytochrome B gene (cytb), if necessary to identify uncertain or unassigned samples. Species substitutions were uncovered in 8.7% of analysed samples, principally related to grouper (prevalence of 14.71%). Supermarkets resulted the selling points with a major number of frauds (prevalence of 12.79%). Substituted species were taxonomically related to those declared on the label and no species harmful for consumers were detected. Results obtained can give to National Authorities a detailed frame of trends in fish substitution frauds in Italy, providing also relevant information to put into effect control measures. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Adding undeclared species in meat-based food is an illicit practice with possible commercial, ethical and consumer health consequences. DNA-based quantitative methods are the most promising ones and their performance can be deeply affected by the quality of the input DNA. In this study, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of the DNA obtained using four common methodologies. DNA was isolated from three experimental food matrices (minced meat, ravioli filling and ragout) prepared with different percentages of beef and pork meat. Hundred and eighty DNA preps, including all matrix/percentage/kit combinations, were obtained and submitted to downstream quality assessment. Mean values and their statistical significance, obtained by parameter analysis and pairwise comparison, were used to calculate a DNA Quality Score (DQS), integrating quality parameters. DQS identified the salting-out based protocol as the best performing method for all the considered food matrices (p < 0.05); in DNA purification from ragout, the Cetyl-trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) reagent-based protocol showed comparable results to those obtained by the salting-out method (p < 0.05). An optimal DNA purification is the first step for accurate species quantification in complex meat food. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a contagious viral pathogen that usually causes a mild, self-limiting respiratory disease. More recently, highly virulent FCV strains have emerged and have been associated with severe systemic infection, referred to as virulent systemic disease (VSD). The objective of this study is to report VSD cases in Italian cats along with the molecular characterization of two detected FCV strains. Three client-owned cats showed clinical signs resembling to those described for VSD cases. The cats were subjected to molecular investigations for detection of FCV and other feline pathogens. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry were performed on internal organs of one cat; molecular characterization of two detected FCV strains was obtained through sequence and phylogenetic analyses. Putative VS-FCV strains were detected in all three cats, which were co-infected with feline panleukopenia virus. The cat submitted to histopathology and immunohistochemistry displayed severe histological changes and FCV antigens in internal organs. Two Italian FCV strains, for which amplification of ORF2 was successful, were strictly related and formed a unique phylogenetic cluster. These viruses did not show consistent changes in the amino acid sequences with respect to reference VS-FCVs. The results of our study confirm that VS-FCV strains are circulating in Italy and that VSD diagnosis is complicated since both genetic and clinical markers have not been identified so far. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Swine brucellosis due to Brucella suis biovar 2 (bv2) is enzootic in wild boar and hare in continental Europe and may cause major economic losses to the pig industry, mainly in free-ranged pig farms. The high nucleotide identity found among the B. suis biovar 2 isolates has long hindered the full understanding of the epidemiology and the phylogeography of the disease. Here, we used multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA) and whole-genome analysis to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in order to gain insights from the largest B. suis bv2 dataset analyzed so far composed of domestic pigs and wildlife isolates collected throughout Europe since the 1970s. We found four major clades with a specific phylogeographic pattern. The Iberian clade contains isolates exclusively from the Iberian Peninsula. The Central European clade includes most isolates from France, Northern Italy, Switzerland and an important proportion of those of Northern Spain. The Eastern European clade clustered isolates from Croatia and Hungary mainly but also from areas of France, Germany, Italy and Poland. Finally, a separated Sardinian clade grouped three isolates from this island. At fine scale, MLVA demonstrated an endemic status of the infection in Europe and it allowed tracking a large outbreak formed by different farms from Spain linked to the same infection source. The whole genome SNP analysis showed that the strains form genetically distinct clades, shared between wild boar and pigs, in agreement with the MLVA clades. Interestingly, all hare isolates clustered together within two groups composed exclusively of wildlife isolates.

abstract={A simple procedure for field fish sample pretreatment was developed. This treatment in combination with square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SW-ASV) with solid gold electrodes (SGE) and gold nanoparticle-modified glassy carbon electrodes (AuNPs-GCE) was applied for the determination of total mercury content. A certified reference material (CRM, Tuna Fish BCR 463), ten freeze-dried samples of canned tuna and two fresh fish samples were analysed both with a bench-top voltammetric analyser after microwave digestion and with a portable potentiostat after mild eating using a small commercial food warmer. The results obtained by the two SW-ASV approaches and by a Direct Mercury Analyser (DMA), the official method for mercury determination, were in very good agreement. In particular, (i) the results obtained with in field procedure are consistent with those obtained with the conventional microwave digestion; (ii) the presence of gold nanoparticles on the active electrode surface permits an improvement of the analytical performance in comparison to the SGE: the Limit of Quantification (LOQ) for mercury in fish-matrix was 0.1 µg L −1 (Hg cell concentration), corresponding to 0.06 mg kg −1 wet fish, which is a performance comparable to that of DMA. The pretreatment proposed in this study is very easy and applicable to fresh fish; in combination with a portable potentiostat, it proved to be an interesting procedure for on-site mercury determination. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Rare earth elements (REEs) are central in several critical technologies; their use is constantly increasing as is their release into the environment. For this reason, it is important to investigate REE concentrations in different matrices to evaluate human exposure and environmental risk of these emerging contaminants. REEs were measured by ICP-MS in matrices of terrestrial (plant feed, fruit, honey, wildlife livers) and marine origin (seaweeds, zooplankton, bivalves, fish) collected from Northwestern Italy. Highest REE concentrations were measured at low trophic levels, both in terrestrial and marine environments, such as plants (ΣREE 1.8 mg kg −1 ) and seaweed (ΣREE 12 mg kg −1 ), the major source of exposure and transfer of REEs to food webs. REE concentrations were several orders of magnitude lower in fruit, honey, and livers from terrestrial wildlife, suggesting a negligible risk of exposure by these matrices. Marine biota, such as bivalves (ΣREE 0.16 mg kg −1 ) and fish (ΣREE 0.21 mg kg −1 ) may constitute a pathway for human or animal dietary exposure. The study confirmed that REEs have low potential for biomagnification, but instead are subject to trophic dilution. However, given the numerous sources of dietary introduction of REEs, they should be monitored for a possible harmful cumulative effect. Owing to the scarcity of data regarding REEs worldwide, our results contribute to assessment of the occurrence of these emerging contaminants. © 2019},

abstract={Purpose: Sesame can cause food allergy and according to European legislation, its presence in food must be declared on the label. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the presence of sesame in food products carrying no mention of sesame on the ingredient label and in food products carrying the voluntary labelling statement “may contain traces of sesame”. Design/methodology/approach: Packaged bakery and non-bakery food items were collected at retail. Sample size was calculated according to estimated prevalence of 2 per cent and precision of 5 per cent: in total 32 samples of packaged bakery and non-bakery food were collected for each food category. The RIDASCREEN®FAST Sesame test (R-Biopharm AG, Darmstadt, Germany) was used for the analysis: its limit of detection was fixed in the laboratory at 0.5 ppm. Findings: Of the 32 food samples that did not mention sesame seed on the ingredient label, one (3.1 per cent) breadsticks sample tested positive at a concentration (326 ppm). Of the 32 food samples that carried the precautionary label statement “may contain traces of sesame”, one (3.1 per cent) breadcrumbs sample tested positive (305 ppm). Comparison between the allergen concentration and the published eliciting dose (ED5) for sesame proteins (1 mg) was performed. The calculated exposure was more than 2 the ED05 reported in the literature. Originality/value: To date, few studies investigating compliance with food-allergen labelling requirements are available. This survey provides data for preliminary risk assessment for sesame allergenic consumers. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neural disorder gradually leading to paralysis of the whole body. Alterations in superoxide dismutase SOD1 gene have been linked with several variants of familial ALS. Here, we investigated a transgenic (Tg) cloned swine model expressing the human pathological hSOD1 G93A allele. As in patients, these Tg pigs transmitted the disease to the progeny with an autosomal dominant trait and showed ALS onset from about 27 months of age. Post mortem analysis revealed motor neuron (MN) degeneration, gliosis and hSOD1 protein aggregates in brainstem and spinal cord. Severe skeletal muscle pathology including necrosis and inflammation was observed at the end stage, as well. Remarkably, as in human patients, these Tg pigs showed a quite long presymptomatic phase in which gradually increasing amounts of TDP-43 were detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Thus, this transgenic swine model opens the unique opportunity to investigate ALS biomarkers even before disease onset other than testing novel drugs and possible medical devices. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a complex zoonosis with domestic and sylvatic life-cycles, involving different intermediate and definitive host species. Many previous studies have highlighted the lack of a surveillance system for CE, its persistence in Italy, and endemicity in several Italian regions. Because of the absence of a uniform surveillance program for both humans and animals, disease occurrence is widely underestimated. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of ovine CE in Italy. Survey data on the prevalence of Echinococcus granulosus complex infections in Italian sheep farms from 2010 to 2015 were obtained in collaboration with Regional Veterinary Epidemiology Observatories (OEVRs). Bayesian analysis was performed to estimate the true CE farm prevalence. The prior true CE prevalence was estimated using data from Sardinia. Second, Bayesian modelling of the observed prevalence in different regions and the true prevalence estimation from the first step were used to ultimately estimate the prevalence of ovine CE in Italy. We obtained survey data from 10 OEVRs, covering 14 Italian regions. We observed that the risk of CE infection decreased over the years, and it was strictly correlated with the density of susceptible species. Using Sardinia as prior distribution, where the disease farm prevalence was approximately 19% (95% CI, 18.82–20.02), we estimated that the highest endemic CE farm prevalence was in Basilicata with a value of 12% (95% BCI: 7.49–18.9%) and in Piemonte 7.64%(95% BCI: 4.12–13.04%). Our results provide spatially relevant data crucial for guiding CE control in Italy. Precise information on disease occurrence location would aid in the identification of priority areas for disease control implementation by the authorities. The current underestimation of CE occurrence should urge the Italian and European governments to become aware of the public health importance of CE and implement targeted interventions for high-risk areas. © 2019 Loi et al.

The genome showed a mean nt/aa similarity of 91.2/95.0% with three Swiss genomes closely related to the BDV‑8 5'‑UTR and Npro sequences. The identification of divergent BDV‑8 isolates in North‑Western Italy and in Switzerland suggests that this genotype may have been circulating in a wider area than previously supposed, and may have a high host adaptability.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Peanuts and tree nut allergies pose an increasing food safety problem. The aim of our study was to test the accuracy of different commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits in the detection of the presence of walnuts in untreated and heat exposed food samples. The effects of thermal treatment of samples were evaluated by exposing walnuts to different heat treatments. All samples were first analysed by two different commercial ELISA assays. Then, we performed a skin prick test (SPT) on nine patients with proven nut allergy using small walnut pieces from raw and treated samples. RESULTS: The presence of nuts proteins in thermally processed foods was not accurately detected by ELISA kits. All patients had a positive SPT reaction with raw walnut, while thermal treatments affected walnut allergenicity. The ELISA test gives a negative result in the case of strong thermal treatment, but at the same time allergic subjects react positively to stimulation with the same sample. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that commercial ELISA kits may not be able to accurately determine the amount of proteins present in thermally processed foods due to changes in the solubility and immunoreactivity of the target proteins. Finally, the clinical results highlight that thermal treatment might induce a reduction in walnut allergenicity. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry},

abstract={Berries have repeatedly been associated with outbreaks of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection. The fruits are usually minimally processed in the food industry due to their delicate nature. While washing treatments partially remove enteric viruses, the commonly used chemical additives produce toxic by-products. A valid alternative to preserve the food safety of these products could be the use of essential oils (EOs). EOs exert antimicrobial activity and do not interfere with the nutritional characteristics of food products. We investigated the efficacy of four essential oils, lemon (Citrus limon), sweet orange (Citrus sinensis), grapefruit (Citrus paradisi), and rosemary cineole (Rosmarinus officinalis chemotype 1.8 cineole) in reducing viral loads of HAV in soft fruits. Mixed fruit berries were inoculated with 10 6.74 TCID 50 /ml of HAV, and treated with four different EOs (0.5% lemon, 0.1% sweet orange and grapefruit, and 0.05% rosemary) for 1 h at room temperature. Virus infectivity was then assessed by titration assays for its ability to grow on cell cultures. A statistically significant reduction in HAV titer on the fruit surface was observed after treating the berries with EOs of lemon (2.84 log TCID 50 /ml), grapefruit (2.89 log TCID 50 /ml), and rosemary cineole (2.94 log TCID 50 /ml). Rosemary cineole was the most effective EO in reducing viral titer on berries, followed by grapefruit EO. These results improve our knowledge about the antiviral activity of these EOs and highlight their potential use in fresh produce sanitation. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Member States of the EU are required to monitor the use of pharmacologically active substances in food-producing animals. There is evidence, however, that the target-based approach currently applied in official monitoring plans might under-estimate the real incidence of growth promoter abuse in livestock. As demonstrated for sex hormones, the association of effect-oriented biological screening with chemical confirmatory techniques could be the best strategy in revealing the abuse of veterinary drugs. Here we demonstrate the reliability of a cell-based assay to screen calf urine samples for synthetic glucocorticoids. The validation included the most widely used synthetic drugs (flumethasone, dexamethasone, betamethasone, methylprednisolone and prednisolone) and was developed according to the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC, thus including the verification of cut-off level, the β error, the specificity, ruggedness and stability. The study was carried out using prednisolone as representative substance at 5 ng mL −1 concentration. All blank and spiked urine fulfilled the EU criteria, moreover the method resulted in being specific and sound, and the analytes in urine were stable for at least 30 days. The assay results indicated its suitability for a qualitative analysis of calf urine samples. This method enabled the detection of low doses of synthetic glucocorticoids (GCs) in matrix (&lt;2 ng mL −1 for flumethasone, dexamethasone, betamethasone; &lt; 4 ng mL −1 for methylprednisolone; 5 ng mL −1 for prednisolone), with the possibility of detecting new or unknown molecules and cumulative effects of low-level mixtures with glucocorticoid bioactivity. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={We compared results of a serum immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and lymph node quantitative PCR (qPCR) in dogs classified as exposed, infected, or sick because of leishmaniasis. We also determined how IFA or qPCR results changed in response to treatment and reflected different clinical and clinicopathologic improvement of dogs. We included 108 dogs in our retrospective study: 12 exposed, 25 infected, and 71 sick, as classified according to Canine Leishmaniasis Working Group standards. Between-group comparison showed higher IFA values (p < 0.01) for sick dogs; qPCR values were higher for sick than infected dogs (p < 0.01). A novel clinical and clinicopathologic score was created and applied to 50 sick dogs. Using this score, 41 were reclassified as partially recovered (PR) within 3 mo, and 37 as totally recovered (TR) 3–6 mo after presentation. Statistically significant differences in IFA values were found between the sick and TR dogs (p < 0.01), but not between sick and PR dogs (p = 0.98). During follow-up, qPCR revealed a progressive decrease in parasite load, with a statistically significant difference in sick versus PR (p < 0.01), sick versus TR (p < 0.01), and PR versus TR (p < 0.01) dogs. A decrease of 1 point in the clinical score corresponded to 1.3 Leishmania/μL qPCR decrease (p < 0.01) and decrease of 1:42 in IFA (p < 0.01). Our findings confirm that the clinical status of dogs affected by leishmaniasis is closely related to parasite load and antibody level, both before and after treatment. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={Avian feathers have the potential to accumulate trace elements originating from contaminated food and polluted environments. In fact, in feathers, metals bind to keratin, a sulphur-containing protein for which several metals have a strong affinity. Here, the concentrations of 18 essential and non-essential elements were investigated in a Humboldt penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) colony housed at the Acquario di Cattolica (Italy). This species is listed as vulnerable in the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature. According to the literature, there is usually a link between metal levels in the diet of birds and levels detected in their feathers. Thus, metals were also determined in the penguins’ food (capelin, Mallotus villosus). We hypothesize that the controlled conditions in which birds are kept in captivity, and the homogeneous diet that they follow could allow a better understanding of metal bioaccumulation (such as mercury) or bio-dilution (such as arsenic) in the marine food chain, indicated by penguins’ feathers. Moreover, comparisons with our previous investigations performed on an ex-situ African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) colony suggest that penguins living indoors have lower body burden of metals than those living outdoors. Indeed, environmental contaminants usually found in areas subjected to anthropogenic impact, where zoos and aquaria are often located, are not accumulated to levels of concern. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

With this study we describe the results of screening for bacterial infections during monitoring campaigns carried out from 2014 to 2017. A total of 402 sturgeons from six sturgeon farms with one or more reared sturgeon species among five species and two hybrids were analysed. Bacteriological exam was positive in 93 individuals (23%) and negative in the remaining 309 (77%). Generally, no external or internal macroscopic lesions were present, though some specimens showed skin lesions, liver anaemia or splenomegaly, which are non-pathognomonic signs of bacterial infection. The majority of the isolated bacteria were opportunistic. This knowledge base is important to help create a bacterial profile of sturgeons reared in Italy. © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Interspecific differences in arsenic bioaccumulation and organ distribution (muscle, liver, kidney and gills) in three predator fish (creole perch, rainbow trout and brown trout) from a Patagonian lake impacted by volcanic eruptions were studied. Arsenic in fish organs were compared analyzing: 1) temporal (before and after volcanic eruption) and spatial (near and far from the volcano) influence of Puyehue-Cordón Caulle volcanic complex activity on arsenic concentrations; 2) the influence of growth (as total length), organ type and their interactions over arsenic accumulation; and 3) arsenic speciation and total arsenic relationship with carbon to nitrogen ratios (C:N), as a proxy of lipid presence, in fish muscle. In general, total arsenic concentrations in creole perch organs were 2–7 times higher than those recorded in the corresponding organs of salmonids. Arsenic was preferentially accumulated in liver and kidney in the three fish species. The influence of the volcanic activity over arsenic concentrations was more evident in creole perch: organs from creole perch captured closest to the volcano exhibited higher arsenic concentrations. Temporal variations were not so consistent. No clear relationship between arsenic and fish length was observed. Positive and linear relationship between arsenic in all pair of organs was found in creole perch, while rainbow trout showed a quadratic relationship between muscle and the remaining organs, indicating different arsenic assimilation-elimination relationships between organs and fish. The arsenic liver:muscle ratio in the three fish species was greater than 1, suggesting some level of arsenic stress. Arsenobetaine (AB) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) were the dominant arsenic species in muscle of these fish, having creole perch 3–4 times higher AB than rainbow trout. A positive relationship between C:N ratio and total arsenic concentrations was found, with higher C:N in creole perchs near the volcano. In terms of food safety, no inorganic arsenic compound were detected, therefore arsenic levels in fish from Lake Nahuel Huapi does not represent any health risk to consumers. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={An unusual mortality event (UME) of striped dolphins Stenella coeruleoalba occurred in the period July to December 2016 along the Italian Ionian coastline. We conducted a complete postmortem examination on 28 specimens and detected dolphin morbillivirus (DMV), by means of biomolecular analyses, in the target tissues of 17 animals. Unlike previous outbreaks occurring in the Mediterranean Sea in 2011 and 2013, we observed typical pathological changes suggestive of morbilliviral infection in an acute/subacute phase and immunohistochemical reactivity. The same findings were observed in 13 other specimens beached along the Italian coastline during 2016 with no temporal and geographical relationship with the ongoing epidemic outbreak. Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis showed that DMV sequences detected in Italy in 2016 clustered with those identified in Portugal and Galicia (Spain), representing a novel DMV strain of Atlantic origin which entered the Mediterranean Sea and affected a naïve striped dolphin population. DMV sequences detected in the previous Mediterranean outbreaks exhibited a marked genetic relatedness and diverged from those detected in cetaceans stranded along the Galician and Portuguese coasts since 2007. © Inter-Research 2019.},

abstract={Cystidicola farionis is a nematode of the swim bladder that parasitizes Salmonidae and Osmeridae families, with a range of diffusion in Europe, Asia, and North America. During a fish health monitoring performed in July 2017 in a trout farm located in northwest Italy, a prevalence of 70% for C. farionis was recorded in rainbow trout from a unique tank. In order to clarify the first occurrence of this parasite in northwest Italy, a total of 180 specimens were analysed in different seasons to obtain prevalence, mean intensity, and mean abundance of infestation. Moreover, amphipods were also sampled during each fish sampling campaign. Only fish sampled in August 2017 were positive for C. farionis, since fish were then sold and replaced with a new batch. All isolated nematodes were identified by morphological criteria as subadults (L4), but not sexually matured. All examined amphipods (genus Gammarus) resulted negative for the presence of the parasite. The most probable explanation of this report was due to the movement of a single fish batch from northeast Italy, previously described as an endemic area for this parasite. The absence of the parasite in the amphipods and consequently in other fish batches from other tanks are due to the lifetime cycle of the parasite that had no time to infect new hosts. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Histological analysis revealed a severe meningoencephalitis characterized by lymphocytic and plasmacellular infiltration, gliosis, perivascular cuffs, and leptomeningitis at the level of brain and brain stem. Laboratory investigations included polymerase chain reaction, sequencing and characterization by phylogenetic analysis, and evaluation of the internal ribosome entry site secondary structure in the 5’ untranslated region. These tests identified the pathological agent as border disease virus, a known health risk in domestic small ruminants. Genetic characteristics of the isolated strains, closely related to ovine and caprine strain sequences from neighboring regions of Piedmont, France, and Switzerland, suggested geographic segregation and micro-evolutive steps within the species. © 2019, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tripoli.

abstract={Background. The zoo is a unique environment in which to study animals. Zoos have a long history of research into aspects of animal biology, even if this was not the primary purpose for which they were established. The data collected from zoo animals can have a great biological relevance and it can tell us more about what these animals are like outside the captive environment. In order to ensure the health of all captive animals, it is important to perform a post-mortem examination on all the animals that die in captivity. Methods. The causes of mortality of two hundred and eighty two mammals which died between 2004 and 2015 in three different Italian zoos (a Biopark, a Safari Park and a private conservation center) have been investigated. Results. Post mortem findings have been evaluated reporting the cause of death, zoo type, year and animal category. The animals frequently died from infectious diseases, in particular the causes of death in ruminants were mostly related to gastro-intestinal pathologies. pulmonary diseases were also very common in each of the zoos in the study. Moreover, death was sometimes attributable to traumas, as a result of fighting between conspecifics or during mating. Cases of genetic diseases and malformations have also been registered. Discussion. This research was a confirmation of how conservation, histology and pathology are all connected through individual animals. These areas of expertise are extremely important to ensure the survival of rare and endangered species and to learn more about their morphological and physiological conditions. They are also useful to control pathologies, parasites and illnesses that can have a great impact on the species in captivity. Finally, this study underlines the importance of a close collaboration between veterinarians, zoo biologists and pathologists. Necropsy findings can help conservationists to determine how to support wild animal populations. © 2019 Scaglione et al.},

abstract={The increasing global need to find alternative protein/energy sources has triggered research in the field of non-conventional feed ingredients, with insects and former foodstuffs being the most promising. Insects contain high level of protein and fat, whereas former foodstuffs contain high energy in the form of carbohydrates and fats; therefore, both should be considered as promising alternative feed ingredients for livestock production. In addition to the nutritional value, they also represent a way by which food waste biomasses/streams can be upgraded to valuable feed ingredients. This review outlines the main nutritional and safety issues of insects and former foodstuffs, and also considers the legal framework involved. The importance of the type of insect metamorphosis and tailored substrates that could lead to the production of a premium feed is also described. This is also the first time that a review discusses the nutritional quality of former foodstuffs. Energy and the main nutrient content of former foodstuff are compared with the composition of common cereals as the principal energy sources in animal feed. For both ingredients a critical review of the safety issues is provided. Based on the current data available, both insects and former foodstuffs have an excellent potential use as alternative feed ingredients for livestock production. When produced in line with the criteria set by major feed/food authorities, they are characterized by high quality and safety standards. This makes them comparable to other feed materials and ingredients currently available on the market, although their full nutritional, functional, safety and sustainability evaluation cannot be considered complete. © The Animal Consortium 2019.},

abstract={Disease incursion and transmission modelling can play an important role in elucidating important pathways and dynamics of transboundary diseases. It is an important pre-requisite for preparedness and rapid response. A model framework has been developed which makes use of global datasets to predict the probability of entry of exotic animal pathogens to European Union (EU)member states (MSs)via some of the most likely routes of introduction: legal trade of livestock and meat products, illegal trade of red meat, wild animal dispersion, windborne vector dispersion and human introduction of pets. The model was designed to be applicable for a wide range of pathogens, many of which have limited data. We demonstrate its application through four case study pathogens: African swine fever, Classical swine fever, Bluetongue and classical rabies. The model results highlight the differences in probability between EU MSs; the absolute values for entry via a given route differed across MSs whilst different pathogens were predicted as having the highest probability of entry for the same route across MSs. Scenario analyses suggested that the probability of entry was heavily influenced by the pathogen prevalence in the country of origin and the extent to which EU MSs pose a risk to each other; the greatest risk was predominantly from countries within the EU. While we believe the input data are obtained from high quality sources, there are still big issues with regards uncertainty in some areas, in particular with regards to prevalence of pathogens in vector populations and consistency of reporting of pathogen prevalence in animals across all countries of the world. Thus, it is inevitable that there is a high degree of uncertainty associated with the absolute values. However, the main strength of the model is the broad range of analyses over pathogens, EU MSs and routes of entry. The model is also relatively easy to update with new data and a web based visualisation tool has been developed which allows users to interrogate the results of the model. As such, we believe that the model proposed here can be a useful quantitative complement to current qualitative early warning systems, helping to drive risk-based surveillance activities, by providing detailed quantitative comparisons to indicate which pathogens are most likely to enter the EU, by which route and into which areas within Europe. © 2019},

abstract={Staphylococcal food poisoning outbreaks are a major cause of food-borne illness in the European Union and their notification has been mandatory since 2005. Criteria for the enumeration of coagulase-positive Staphylococci (CPS) and the detection of staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) in cheese have been set down in Commission Regulation EC 2073/2005. Currently, few information are available about the distribution of SEs in naturally contaminated cheeses, including raw-milk and artisanal dairy products. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate at both the CPS enumeration and the succession of the enterotoxigenic Staphylococcus aureus and produced enterotoxins levels on the rind and the core of a raw-milk semi-hard cheese, produced on farm. The study has been conducted in three steps: (I) seven wheels at different time of ripening where tested for the presence of SEs. (II) from each wheel, four portions were subsequently sampled from four different areas (peripheral rind, central rind, peripheral core and central core). (III) two cheese wheels, characterized by the highest and lowest CPS numbers and SEs quantification, based on the second step of the study, were further analyzed. A significant difference has been observed in the distribution of CPS and SEs in the four areas sampled, irrespectively of the batch and the time of ripening. The results of this study provided a set of previously unknown information on the influence of natural conditions on the distribution of CPS and SEs thereof in the cheese matrix, filling a gap in the understanding of SEs biosynthesis process. © 2019 Bellio, Chiesa, Gallina, Bianchi, Macori, Bossi, Nia, Mutel, Messio, Hennekinne and Decastelli.},

abstract={Timely and reliable data and information availability and sharing is essential for early warning, prevention and control of transboundary diseases. While there are a growing number of global datasets capable of providing information for use in early warning systems and risk assessment (RA) tools, there are currently time-consuming data cleansing and harmonisation activities which need to be carried out before they can be reliably used and combined. Thus, using global datasets as they stand can lead to errors in RA parameterisation and results due to inherent biases in the data, e.g. missing disease prevalence data treated as a zero may inadvertently penalise those countries which do report disease outbreaks as opposed to those countries which are affected by a pathogen but do not report outbreak data. It is therefore of great importance that data are clearly provided and easy to understand and that data providers strive for greater harmonisation of database standards. In this paper the datasets utilised in the SPARE (’Spatial risk assessment framework for assessing exotic disease incursion and spread through Europe’) project are described and discussed in terms of key criteria: accessibility, availability, completeness, consistency and quality. It is evident that most databases exist as information portals and not exclusively for RA purposes. Another striking issue from this assessment is the need for enhanced data sharing specifically with regards to data on illegal seizures, arthropod vector/wildlife abundance, intra-country livestock movement and national animal disease surveillance. It is hoped that the outcomes of this work will promote discussion and exchange between data providers, including the development of standardised data exchange protocols. The transformation of datasets to a common format is a considerable challenge but recommendations could and should be made on the standardisation of datasets and reporting in order to achieve a unified approach across Europe. © 2019},

abstract={Exotic animal diseases are transboundary hazards, characterized by their capability to cover global distances, affecting animal health and welfare with significant economic losses. Their prevention is complex and requires the dynamic management of potential entry points, transmission pathways, and preventative barriers. The well-timed detection of an undefined or unexpected (exotic or re-emerging) threat could minimize the consequences due to onward transmission. As a fit for purpose framework, OIE developed the import risk assessment i.e. a risk assessment model focusing on the entrance of an exotic disease into a geographical area with naïve hosts. In this paper, we propose an improvement of the model by integrating it with Social Network Analysis (SNA) accounting for within-country animal movements. Our integrated model has been used as a combined tool to better estimate the spatial probability of the introduction of at least one affected animal in Italian provinces using Bluetongue (BT) as an example. Starting from international country-specific BT prevalence data, the model estimated the probability of introduction to Italy via two different routes of release i.e. the import of infected animals or the release of infected vectors either associated with imported livestock or through windborne dispersion from Africa. The conventional OIE model estimating the probability of BT entering Italy assuming the same release probability for every Italian province was paralleled by a model integrated with outputs from SNA to account for different release probability among provinces based on animal movements. The conventional model predicted a remarkable homogeneity in the risk among the provinces with some peaks only visible during the warmest months. The model incorporating the network analysis predicted the highest risk to be in the North Eastern region of Italy but also highlighted the likely occurrence in a couple of Southern provinces, an output mirroring past occurrence of BT in Italy. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis highlighted the main role for a couple of model parameters i.e. the probability for a vector to become infected and the vaccine coverage, thus suggesting that an extra effort in vaccine campaigns could be envisaged. The ability to measure animal movements by SNA can allow the identification of geographical risk hot spots and therefore the risk-based targeting of the surveillance system. © 2019},

abstract={The niche concept was originally developed to describe the location of normal neural stem cells (NSCs) in the subependymal layer of the sub-ventricular zone. In this paper, its significance has been extended to the location of tumor stem cells in glioblastoma (GB) to discuss the relationship between GB stem cells (GSCs) and endothelial cells (ECs). Their interaction is basically conceived as responsible for tumor growth, invasion and recurrence. Niches are described as the points of utmost expression of the tumor microenvironment (TME), therefore including everything in the tumor except for tumor cells: NSCs, reactive astrocytes, ECs, glioma-associated microglia/macrophages (GAMs), myeloid cells, pericytes, fibroblasts, etc. and all intrinsic and extrinsic signaling pathways. Perivascular (PVNs), perinecrotic (PNNs) and invasive niches were described from the pathological point of view, highlighting the basic significance of the EC/tumor stem cell couple. PNN development was reinterpreted based on the concept that hyperproliferative areas of GB are composed of GSCs/progenitors. TME was depicted in its function as the main regulator of everything that happens in the tumor. A particular emphasis was given to GAMs, pericytes and reactive astrocytes as important elements affecting proliferation, growth, invasion and resistance to therapies of tumor cells. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={BACKGROUND: The highly invasive mosquito species Aedes albopictus has become a major health concern in temperate areas due to its role as vector of exotic arboviruses. Pyrethroid insecticides represent the main tools for limiting the circulation of such mosquito-borne viruses. The present work aim to extend previous reports on phenotypic pyrethroid-resistance in European Ae. albopictus, to identify its genetic basis and to monitor the geographical distribution of resistant genotypes, with a particular focus on sites experiencing the 2017 chikungunya outbreak in Italy. RESULTS: Bioassays, performed according to World Health Organization protocols, showed full susceptibility to deltamethrin (concentration = 0.05%) and varying levels of resistance to permethrin (0.75%) and/or α-cypermethrin (0.05%) across Italy, with highest levels in the core of the 2017 chikungunya outbreak. Partial genotyping of the VSSC gene revealed widespread distribution of V1016G mutation and confirmed its association with pyrethroid resistance. CONCLUSION: The results obtained show that the condition for the spread of pyrethroid resistance in Ae. albopictus in Europe exists under strong selective pressure due to intensive insecticide spraying to control exotic arbovirus outbreak or high levels of nuisance. The results draw attention to the need for an evidence-based implementation of mosquito nuisance control, taking insecticide resistance management into consideration. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry},

abstract={Seafood freshness is a quality key parameter due to the short shelf life of this highly perishable foodstuff in relation to safety, nutritional value, availability, and edibility. A variety of physical, microbiological, and chemical methods are used for assessing and predicting seafood quality. Chemical analyses to assess seafood freshness quality are based on the determination of substances like volatile amines that are structurally similar to ammonia and responsible for the fishy odour fish give off several days after catch. Here we report the results of a method to detect and quantify trimethylamine (TMA) by means of direct sampling analysis (DSA) coupled with a high-resolution mass spectrometer with a time of flight detector (TOF). Three different seafood products, Sea bream (Sparus aurata), Octopus (Octopus vulgaris), and Red mullet (Mullus barbartus) purchased fresh from a wholesale fish market (Savona, Ligurian Sea, Italy) were analyzed. The TMA adduct was correctly identified in all samples. Monitoring of TMA levels in the wholesale products from day 0 to day 20 showed an increase in all samples, confirming deterioration of freshness quality. This innovative, simple, and rapid method may prove useful for routine screening analysis and holds promise as a tool to evaluate seafood freshness quality and protect consumers from potential health risks. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The Dolphin Morbillivirus (DMV) genome from the first Mediterranean epidemic (1990-'92) is the only cetacean Morbillivirus that has been completely sequenced. Here, we report the first application of next generation sequencing (NGS) to morbillivirus infection of aquatic mammals. A viral isolate, representative of the 2006-'08 Mediterranean epidemic (DMV-IZSPLV-2008), efficiently grew on Vero.DogSLAMtag cells and was submitted to whole genome characterization by NGS. The final genome length was 15,673 nucleotides, covering 99.82% of the DMV reference genome. Comparison of DMV-IZSPLV-2008 and 1990-'92 DMV strain sequences revealed 157 nucleotide mutations and 47 amino acid changes. The sequence similarity was 98.7% at the full genome level. Whole-genome phylogeny suggested that the DMV strain circulating during the 2006-'08 epidemics emerged from the 1990-'92 DMV strain. Viral isolation is considered the "gold standard" for morbillivirus diagnostics but efficient propagation of infectious virus is difficult to achieve. The successful cell replication of this strain allowed performing NGS directly from the viral RNA, without prior PCR amplification. We therefore provide to the scientific community a second DMV genome, representative of another major outbreak. Interestingly, genome comparison revealed that the neglected L gene encompasses 74% of the genetic diversity and might serve as "hypervariable" target for strain characterization. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={The spread of non-native species in the Mediterranean Sea, due to Lessepsian migration and tropicalization, as well as the use of “non-selective” fishing practices, causes frequently the capture of uncommon and abyssal species, that can be sold in seafood market. This could represent a risk for food safety, since some of these species are not listed in the European Union (EU) regulations for human consumption. Heavy metal contamination (lead, cadmium, mercury and arsenic) was evaluated, for the first time, in 12 uncommon lessepsian and abyssal finfish and cephalopod species, caught in the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea. Mercury exceeded the maximum limit set by the EU in some species, while lead and cadmium concentrations were compliant. Total inorganic arsenic was detected in all species, in a wide concentration range. Therefore, inclusion in the EU regulations of all these species is suggested to reduce the risk of consumer exposition to heavy metals. © 2018, Bundesamt für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit (BVL).},

abstract={Metformin is an antidiabetic drug which possesses antiproliferative activity in cancer cells when administered at high doses, due to its unfavorable pharmacokinetics. The aim of this work was to develop a pharmacological tool for the release of metformin in proximity of the tumor, allowing high local concentrations, and to demonstrate the in vivo antitumor efficacy after a prolonged metformin exposition. A 1.2% w/w metformin thermoresponsive parenteral formulation based on poloxamers P407 and P124, injectable at room temperature and undergoing a sol-gel transition at body temperature, has been developed and optimized for rheological, thermal and release control properties; the formulation is easily scalable, and proved to be stable during a 1-month storage at 5 °C. Using NOD/SCID mice pseudo-orthotopically grafted with MDA-MB-231/luc + human breast cancer cells, we report that multiple administrations of 100 mg of the optimized metformin formulation close to the tumor site cause tissue accumulation of the drug at levels significantly higher than those observed in plasma, and enough to exert antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activities. Our results demonstrate that this formulation is endowed with good stability, tolerability, thermal and rheological properties, representing a novel tool to be pursued in further investigations for adjuvant cancer treatment. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={In summer 2017, a foodborne outbreak occurred in Central Italy, involving 26 workers employed in the post-earthquake reconstruction. After eating a meal provided by a catering service, they manifested gastrointestinal symptoms; 23 of them were hospitalized. The retrospective cohort study indicated the pasta salad as the most likely vehicle of poisoning. Foods, environmental samples, and food handlers’ nasal swabs were collected. Bacillus cereus (Bc) and coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS) including S. aureus, together with their toxins, were the targets of the analysis. CPS, detected in all the leftovers, exceeded 105 CFU/g in the pasta salad, in which we found Staphylococcal Enterotoxins (SEs) (0.033 ng SEA/g; 0.052 ng SED/g). None of the environmental and human swabs showed contamination. We characterized 23 S. aureus from foods. They all belonged to the human biotype, showed the same toxigenic profile (sea, sed, sej, and ser genes), and had the same Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern; none of them harbored mecA or mupA genes. We also detected Bc contamination in the pasta salad but none of the isolates harbored the ces gene for the emetic toxin cereulide. The EU Reference Laboratory for CPS confirmed the case as a strong-evidence outbreak caused by the ingestion of SEs produced by a single strain of S. aureus carried by the same human source. This outbreak was successfully investigated despite the emergency situation in which it occurred. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Chronic wasting disease (CWD) persists in cervid populations of North America and in 2016 was detected for the first time in Europe in a wild reindeer in Norway. We report the detection of CWD in 3 moose (Alces alces) in Norway, identified through a large-scale surveillance program. The cases occurred in 13–14-year-old female moose, and we detected an abnormal form of prion protein (PrPSc) in the brain but not in lymphoid tissues. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the moose shared the same neuropathologic phenotype, characterized by mostly intraneuronal deposition of PrPSc. This pattern differed from that observed in reindeer and has not been previously reported in CWD-infected cervids. Moreover, Western blot revealed a PrPSc type distinguishable from previous CWD cases and from known ruminant prion diseases in Europe, with the possible exception of sheep CH1641. These findings suggest that these cases in moose represent a novel type of CWD. © 2018, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). All rights reserved.},

abstract={Mass strandings of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) are rare in the Mediterranean Sea. Nevertheless, in 2014 a pod of 7 specimens stranded alive along the Italian coast of the Central Adriatic Sea: 3 individuals died on the beach after a few hours due to internal damages induced by prolonged recumbency; the remaining 4 whales were refloated after great efforts. All the dead animals were genetically related females; one was pregnant. All the animals were infected by dolphin morbillivirus (DMV) and the pregnant whale was also affected by a severe nephropathy due to a large kidney stone. Other analyses ruled out other possible relevant factors related to weather conditions or human activities. The results of multidisciplinary post-mortem analyses revealed that the 7 sperm whales entered the Adriatic Sea encountering adverse weather conditions and then kept heading northward following the pregnant but sick leader of the pod, thereby reaching the stranding site. DMV infection most likely played a crucial role in impairing the health condition and orientation abilities of the whales. They did not steer back towards deeper waters, but eventually stranded along the Central Adriatic Sea coastline, a real trap for sperm whales. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={Insects have recently emerged as a new protein source for both food and feed. Some studies have already demonstrated that insects’ meal can be successfully added to animal feed without threaten animals’ growth indices. However, effective and validated tests to individuate insects’ meal in feed are strongly needed to meet traceability and safety concerns and to support the European legislation under development. Spectroscopic techniques represent valuable rapid and non-destructive methods that can be applied for in-situ analysis in feed production plants or in farms. In this work a Fourier Transform Near Infrared spectroscopy imaging (FT NIR) as a potential screening method for the detection and quantification of insects’ meal in feed is presented. Discriminant analysis was used for the automatic recognition of insects’ meal fragments into the feed matrix. Moreover, the possibility to quantify insect's meal in feed sample was successfully tested. The proposed method is a rapid and green strategy for feed contamination screening analysis. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Currently, a strict gluten-free diet is the only treatment for celiac disease. In Italy, food service establishments and restaurants can be certified for providing gluten-free foods, including pizza restaurants that make both gluten-free pizza and traditional wheat-based pizza. With this study we analyzed the gluten content in samples of gluten-free pizza prepared and purchased at certified restaurants in the Turin metropolitan area. All samples, from 28 pizzas and 28 cooked dough bases, produced results below the test limit of detection, except for one sample of cooked dough, that tested positive for gluten but still below the warning level for celiac consumers (<20 ppm). Gluten-free pizza, as advertised in the restaurants surveyed, can be considered a safe option for gluten-free consumption. Attention to and compliance with good manufacturing practices, a requisite for obtaining gluten-free certification for restaurants, were noted to have a positive effect on the final product. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={The anthropogenic contamination of water bodies with metals via fertilizer, industrial sewage and urban wastewater has resulted in widespread problems in aquatic organisms, but also poses a risk to consumer health. Shellfish from coastal and estuarine environments bioaccumulate toxic metals in their tissues due to their ability to concentrate inorganic contaminants several orders of magnitude above ambient levels. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of trace elements in adult specimens of indigenous clams (Ruditapes decussatus). To this end, wild clams were collected from four different brackish areas of Sardinia (Western Mediterranean Sea, Italy) devoted to extensive aquacultural practices. The concentration of 16 trace elements (Al, Ag, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, Sn, Tl and Zn) in the tissues of the clams was quantified. The legal limits set by European Regulations for cadmium; mercury and lead were never exceeded. However, unexpectedly high values for aluminium and iron (mean 207 mg kg⁻1 and 113 mg kg⁻1 wet weight) were found in Santa Gilla lagoon, which is close to industrial settlements and had the highest values for the majority of chemical elements investigated. The highest values of the metalloid arsenic (As) were reported in the Porto Pozzo and San Teodoro lagoons (9.6 and 6.8 mg kg⁻1 w.w., respectively). The clam R. decussatus confirmed the capacity of bivalves as suitable bioindicators of trace elements pollution. Further investigations are necessary for constant monitoring of clams, 32 which constitute an important traditional resource for the fishing activity in Sardinia. Ruditapes decussatus revealed environmental pollution of lagoons. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The acute course of disease in young oysters infected by OsHV-1 and the rapid tissue degradation often preclude histological examination of specimens collected during outbreaks in field. Herein, live spat originated from two geographical areas were sampled just at the onset of a mortality event that occurred in Normandy (France) in June 2016. The lesions, associated with high OsHV-1 DNA quantities, were characterized by severe and diffuse haemocytosis mainly involving blast-like cells, myocyte degeneration and large, irregularly shaped degenerate eosinophilic cells in the connective tissue. The herpesvirus was identified by negative staining TEM and real-time PCR. Sequencing of the C region and ORFs 42/43 confirmed that the variants met the definition of OsHV-1 μVar. We sequenced 30 other ORFs in twenty OsHV-1-positive individuals and compared them to the μVar specimens isolated between 2009 and 2011. The ORFs encoding putative membrane proteins showed the highest number of variations. Seven different genotypes were identified, confirming the presence of relevant genetic diversity. Phylogenetic analysis provided evidence for a well-separated μVar new group, with an evolutionary divergence estimated at 0.0013 from the other μVar variants. The geographical distribution of these newly described variants and their effective virulence should be investigated in future. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Within the particular context of controlling chemical residues in food, an alternative to targeted approaches has emerged; it consists in the characterisation of physiological perturbations induced upon exposure of animals to a given chemical substance/class of substances to highlight suitable biomarkers addressing safety and/or regulatory issues. Metabolomics in particular has been investigated in the hope of identifying such biomarkers, and a range of studies have demonstrated the efficiency of the strategy. Until very recently, steps remained to be taken towards official or commercial implementation of corresponding tools. In particular, the lack of guidelines and criteria to validate such methods that do not target specific chemical species per se, constituted a bottleneck. In the present work, a metabolomics model dedicated to the detection of β-agonist administration in bovines has been developed and fully validated; criteria (selectivity, robustness, stability, suspicion threshold definition, false positive and false negative rates) have been proposed in agreement with EU expectations (Dec 2002/657), enabling demonstration that performances comply with screening requirements. Although some of the biomarkers involved in the prediction model remain un-elucidated, the corresponding LC-HRMS method has recently been ISO17025 accredited, allowing for the very first official implementation of a metabolomics based strategy within French National Monitoring Plans. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Introduction-A few large surveys on tumour prevalence in goats indicate that tumours in general are quite common in this species. Reviews of neoplastic diseases in goats indicate a prevalence ranging from 0,8 to 11%. However, osteogenic tumours arising from facial bones in goats are rare. Regarding oral localization only a few mesenchymal tumours have been described arising from the gengiva. Case presentation-A 4-year old, female crossbred goat was referred with a history of dysorexia and a slow growing painful mass on the face. On physical examination the animal showed poor body condition and the left side of the face was deformed by a voluminous mass which, at the inspection of the oral cavity, displaced the maxillary teeth. Differential diagnoses included os-teomyelitis and benign (osteoma, chondroma, ossifying and non ossifying fibroma, odontogenic tumours) as well as malignant (osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma) mesenchymal tumours arising from either the connective tissue and bone. The goat was euthanized because of the extension of the lesion and a complete necropsy was performed. Grossly, the face was deformed by the presence of a hard mass arising from the branch of the left mandible. Histologically the oral mass was composed of heterogeneous proliferation of malignant osteoblasts intermigled with brightly eosinophilic strands or island of osteoid matrix. Neoplastic cells, interpreted as malignant osteoblasts, were characterized by plump to round or spindle-shape morphology, with moderate basophilic cytoplasm and an eccentrically located voluminous nucleus containing a large prominent nucleolus. Mitotic figures were found and were either bipolar and atypical. At necropsy no metastases were found and the final diagnosis was non-metastasizing mandibular osteoblastic osteosarcoma. Conclusion-In conclusion, regardless the type of tumour, the goat was euthanized because of the extension and the severity of the lesion. Necropsy and histological examination were necessary to correctly classify the tumour as a non-metastasizing mandibular osteosarcoma. © 2018, Massimo Morgante. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Neuron glial antigen 2 (NG2) is a chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) that occurs in developing and adult central nervous systems (CNSs) as a marker of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) together with platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα). It behaves variably in different pathological conditions, and is possibly involved in the origin and progression of human gliomas. In the latter, NG2/CSPG4 induces cell proliferation and migration, is highly expressed in pericytes, and plays a role in neoangiogenesis. NG2/CSPG4 expression has been demonstrated in oligodendrogliomas, astrocytomas, and glioblastomas (GB), and it correlates with malignancy. In rat tumors transplacentally induced by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU), NG2/CSPG4 expression correlates with PDGFRα, Olig2, Sox10, and Nkx2.2, and with new vessel formation. In this review, we attempt to summarize the normal and pathogenic functions of NG2/CSPG4, as well as its potential as a therapeutic target. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Fishing activities are considered one of the most relevant threats for cetaceans and sea turtles conservation since these animals are sometimes found dead entangled in fishing gears. Currently, postmortem diagnosis is based mainly on the presence of nets and lines on the body and the related marks and injuries evident at gross examination. A more detailed and objective evidence is needed to clarify doubts cases and the diatoms technique, used in forensic human medicine, could support drowning diagnosis also in this field. Diatoms’ investigation was implemented to be applied in marine vertebrate on 8 striped (Stenella coeruleoalba) and 1 bottlenose (Tursiops truncatus) dolphins and 5 sea turtles (Caretta caretta) stranded along the Italian coastlines with a likely cause of death hypothized on necropsies carried out by veterinary pathologists. Diatoms were microscopically searched in the bone marrow collected from long bones implementing protocols used in human medicine and their presence was observed in 4 cetaceans and 2 sea turtles. Despite a clear relation between diatoms’ presence and amount and the likely cause of death was not proved due to the poor number of samples, the higher burden of diatoms was found in 3 animals deemed to be death for the interaction with human activity. Despite more studied are necessary to identify the possible relation between the cause of death and diatoms’ findings, the present study implemented this technique to be adapted to marine animals, confirming its possible application also in veterinary forensic medicine. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The substitution and sale of frozen-thawed fish labeled as fresh is a widespread, difficult to unmask commercial fraud and a potential risk for consumer health. Proteomics could help to identify markers for the rapid screening of food samples and the identification of frozen-thawed seafood. Using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and high-resolution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we identified biomarkers that are able to discriminate between fresh and frozen-thawed tissue samples of curled octopus (Eledone cirrhosa). The 2-DE analysis showed a significant reduction in two protein spots (molecular weight of 45–50 kDa, isoelectric point of 6.5–7) identified as transgelin. At shotgun analysis, nine proteins resulted modulated and transgelin was confirmed as down-regulated, making it a potentially useful marker for differentiating between fresh and frozen-thawed fish product samples. Biological significance: This work, based on two different proteomics approaches, investigated differentially expressed proteins in the tentacles of the curled octopus (E. cirrhosa) after freezing-thawing processes. We were able to characterize the proteome of the tentacles, increasing our knowledge on this species, and a common down-regulated protein was identified by 2-DE and shotgun analysis, a calponin-like protein called transgelin, suggesting a potential use as a marker to distinguish different states of conservation in this species. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The occurrence of trace elements, REE and iAs was investigated in macroalgae collected from Giglio Island (Grosseto, Italy), 3 years after the Costa Concordia shipwreck recovery operations. There was a high variability of metals and REE between species, even those belonging to the same phylum. Arsenic level was found within the range of the Tuscany marine environment; the inorganic fraction was from 9% to 31%. Al, Be, Pb and Zn levels in seaweeds from Giglio Island were found to be significantly higher than in macroalgae from other islands of the Tuscany archipelago. REE were double the values found in the Tuscan islands of Elba and Capraia. We suggest that concentrations of metals and REE were influenced by the 3-year-long naval operations carried out for the Costa Concordia shipwreck rescue, and that macroalgae could be suitable bioindicators of perturbations in metal concentrations in the marine environment.

abstract={Arthropod vectors are responsible for the transmission of human pathogens worldwide. Several arthropod species are bird ectoparasites, however, no study to date has characterized their microbiota as a whole. We sampled hematophagous ectoparasites that feed on migratory birds and performed 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding to characterize their microbial community. A total of 194 ectoparasites were collected from 115 avian hosts and classified into three groups: a) Hippoboscidae diptera; b) ticks; c) other arthropods. Metabarcoding showed that endosymbionts were the most abundant genera of the microbial community, including Wolbachia for Hippoboscidae diptera, Candidatus Midichloria for ticks, Wolbachia and Arsenophonus for the other arthropod group. Genera including pathogenic species were: Rickettsia, Borrelia, Coxiella, Francisella, Bartonella, Anaplasma. Co-infection with Borrelia-Rickettsia and Anaplasma-Rickettsia was also observed. A global overview of the microbiota of ectoparasites sampled from migratory birds was obtained with the use of 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding. A novel finding is the first identification of Rickettsia in the common swift louse fly, Crataerina pallida. Given their possible interaction with pathogenic viruses and bacteria, the presence of endosymbionts in arthropods merits attention. Finally, molecular characterization of genera, including both pathogenic and symbiont species, plays a pivotal role in the design of targeted molecular diagnostics. © 2018 Cerutti et al.

abstract={The domestic cat (Felis catus) was used as a sentinel of exposure to polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) in indoor urban environments y. Sera from 120 cats were pooled to form 30 different groups selected by age (&lt;2 years; &gt; 2 ≤ 8 years; &gt; 8 years), sex, municipality (Bologna and Turin) and environment (indoor vs. outdoor). Test portions of 1 mL were analyzed by means of gas chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS) for six selected indicators non-dioxin-like PCBs (∑6 PCBs: congeners #28, #52, #101, #132, #153 and #180) and the results were computed in the upper-bound mode. The internal dose of PCBs attributable to the cats' alimentary lipid intake ranged from 32.4 to 1,446 ng/g (P50 165; mean 258). The Wilcoxon test revealed significantly lower PCB burden in “outdoor” groups than in “indoor” groups. Age correlated well with the heptachlorinated and most bio-accumulative congener, PCB #180, and slightly with hexachlorinated PCBs #138 and #153. Contamination attributable to house dust collected in 15 living-rooms ranged from 10.0 to 279 ng/g dry weight (P50 97.4; mean 94.4). Exposure estimates indicated a 0.6–16 ng/kg bw range of daily ∑6 PCB intake from a default value of 200 mg/cat of dust ingestion. The intake of PCBs due to dust ingestion fell within the same order of magnitude as that computed from a 60 g daily intake of commercial dry pet foods, while inhalation accounted for 0.21–8.2 ng/kg bw/day, on setting the nominal ∑6 PCB contamination in outdoor and indoor air at 0.37 and 15 ng/m3, respectively. Italian indoor cats could be exposed to higher levels of ∑6 PCBs than the Reference Dose (RfD) of 10 ng/kg/bw/day; this supports the World Health Organization's statement that the quality of the indoor environment is a major determinant of health. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The study summarises the results obtained over the period 2002-2013 by the Italian IT-Enter-Vet network, aimed at collecting data on Salmonella isolates from non-human sources. A total of 42,491 Salmonella isolates were reported with a progressive decrease over the years. S. Typhimurium was the most frequent serovar up to 2011, but then, it was overtaken by S. 4,[5],12,:i:-, S. Derby, S. Livingstone and S. Enteritidis alternated as the third most commonly isolated serovars. With regard to the sources of isolation, S. Typhimurium was distributed ubiquitously among the animal species. On the contrary, S. 4,[5],12,:i:- and S. Derby were strictly associated with pigs, whereas S. Livingstone, S. Enteritidis and S. Infantis were clearly related to poultry. Intriguingly, when the frequency of serovar distribution along the food chain was considered, it was evident that S. Typhimurium and S. Derby tended to persist along the chain, as they were isolated even more frequently from foods than from animals. A similar distribution was found for S. Enteritidis and S. Hadar. Despite limitations related to non-mandatory participation of laboratories in the network, the data presented are valuable to obtain a picture of the evolution of Salmonella from non-human sources over time in Italy. © British Veterinary Association (unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

abstract={The primary production of fresh soft fruits was considered to be a suspected critical point for the contamination of frozen berries that were responsible for the large 2013-2014 Hepatitis A virus (HAV) outbreak in Europe. In this study, an Italian berries' production area was studied for its agro-technical characteristics, and the fresh fruits were analyzed for the presence of enteric viruses (HAV and Norovirus (NoV) genogroup I and genogroup II (GGI and GGII)), the enumeration of hygienic quality parameters, and the prevalence of bacterial pathogens. A total of 50 producers were sampled, who specialized in the exclusive or shared cultivation of berries. Escherichia coli was detected in two blackberry samples, whereas HAV and Norovirus were not detected. The samples were negative for Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). The farms' attributes were not associated with positive samples, apart from the presence of E. coli and the aerobic mesophilic bacteria for blackberry that were statistically correlated. In blueberries, the high aerobic mesophilic count could likely be associated with the resistance of the outer layer to handling. However, the two pathogens (Salmonella spp. and STEC) and the targeted viruses (HAV, NoV GGI and GGII) were not detected, highlighting the low risk of foodborne pathogens and viral contamination at the primary production stage of the berry food chain in the area considered in this pilot study. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={Recently, the concept of niches as sites of tumor progression, invasion, and angiogenesis in glioblastoma (GB) has been extensively debated. Niches, considered the sites in which glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) reside, have been classified as perivascular, perinecrotic, and invasive. However, from a neuropathological point of view, it is not easy to establish when a tumor structure can be considered a niche. The relevant literature has been reviewed in the light of our recent experience on the subject. As for perinecrotic niches, the occurrence of GSCs around necrosis is interpreted as triggered by hypoxia through HIF-1α. Our alternative hypothesis is that, together with progenitors, they are the cell constituents of hyper-proliferative areas of GB, where perinecrotic niches have developed, and they would, therefore, represent the remnants of GSCs/progenitors spared by the developing necrosis. Perivascular structures originate from both transport vessels and exchange vessels, i.e., venules, arterioles, or the undefinable neo-formed small vessels, but only those in which a direct contact between GSCs/progenitors and endothelial cells occurs can be called niches. Both pericytes and microglia/macrophages play a role in niche function: Macrophages of blood origin invade GB only after the appearance of “mother vessels” with consequent blood-brain barrier disruption. Not all vessel/tumor cell structures can be considered niches, that is, crucial sites of tumor progression, invasion, and angiogenesis. © 2018, Springer-Verlag Italia S.r.l., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a zoonotic infectious disease with a severe impact on humans and animals. Infection is transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies, and several domestic and wild mammals act as reservoirs for the infection, so the prompt detection of infected hosts is crucial to preventing and controlling the spread of the disease and its transmission to humans. A rapid and portable tool for VL diagnosis based on the lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) technology is described herein. The device exploits a highly specific chimeric recombinant antigen as the recognition element for capturing anti-leishmanial antibodies, and protein A labelled with gold nanoparticles as the signal reporter. The LFIA shows excellent diagnostic sensitivity (98.4%), specificity (98.9%), and agreement with serological reference methods for diagnosing canine VL. The long-term stability of the LFIA device was confirmed based on six months of storage at room temperature or 4 °C, and the qualitative response of the device was not affected by limited thermal stress. The use of the broadly specific protein A means that the LFIA can be readily adapted to diagnose VL in dogs (the main reservoir for human infection) and other mammals, thus further assisting efforts to control the spread of VL.

abstract={Scarce data are currently available about the ecology of canine adenoviruses (CAdVs) in wild carnivores. In this paper, the consecutive circulation of CAdV-1 and CAdV-2 in wild carnivores maintained in a French zoological park is reported. A fatal CAdV-1 infection was observed in a Eurasian wolf (Canis lupus lupus), which displayed gross lesions, histopathological changes and immunohistochemical findings suggestive of CAdV-1 infection. The virus was isolated on cell cultures and its genome was determined through next-generation sequencing, resulting genetically related to a recent Italian CAdV-1 strain detected in an Italian wolf. Subsequently, subclinical circulation of CAdV-2 was demonstrated by molecular methods in wild carnivores maintained in the same zoological park, some of which had been previously vaccinated with a CAdV-2 vaccine. Virus detection at a long distance from vaccination and by unvaccinated animals was suggestive of infection by a CAdV-2 field strain, although no data are available about the extent and duration of shedding of CAdV-2 modified-live virus in wild or domestic carnivores. The present paper provides new insights into the CAdV ecology in wildlife, although future studies are needed to fully understand the pathogenic potential of both CAdVs especially in endangered carnivore species. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The implementation of the European Union strategy for polychlorodibenzo-dioxins and -furans (PCDD/Fs), and dioxin-like polychlorobiphenyls (DL-PCBs) is determining a general reduction of their presence in the environment and in the food chain. The most important route for human exposure to these substances is food consumption and, as a consequence, a progressive decrease of their dietary intake has been observed in the last decades. In this context, it seemed worth updating the PCDD/F and DL-PCB intake estimation for the Italian population. A total of 2659 samples of food of animal and vegetable origin analyzed for PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs in the period 2013–2016 by accredited official laboratories and the national food consumption database were considered for the dietary intake assessment in different age groups of the Italian general population The median cumulative intake estimates expressed as pg WHO-TEQ/kg body weight per day and computed with a deterministic and a probabilistic approach were 1.40–1.52 for children, 0.82–0.85 for adolescents, and 0.64–0.61 for adults, respectively. Such results confirm the decreasing trend of PCDD/F and DL-PCB dietary intake even though the Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) value of 2 WHO-TEQ/kg body weight per day is exceeded at the 95th percentile for all age groups, with children as sensitive group. Most contributing food categories to the intake resulted fish, food of vegetable origin, and cheese. A sensitivity analysis was also performed to calculate the target contamination levels able to keep the dietary exposure below the TDI. Computed target levels fall between P50 and P97 of the occurrence distribution of the main food groups, meaning that most of the Italian food production can be considered safe. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The concentrations of rare earth elements (REEs) were determined by ICP-MS in feed for farm animals in three regions of Northwestern Italy. This is the first study aimed at defining the levels and patterns of REEs in feed for different animal species. REEs are in fact emerging as contaminants worldwide, following their applications in industry, technology, medicine, and agriculture. Moreover, in 2016, the first REE-based feed additive—a zootechnical additive for weaned piglets—was authorized in the EU. Therefore, information about the natural content of REEs in animal feed of vegetal origin is required to evaluate the potential use of REEs as a growth promoter. There was a high variability in the REEs content of the animal feed in three different Italian regions, and REEs content varied according to the different animal species for which the feed was intended. Concentrations of light REE (LREE) were higher than those of heavy REE (HREE) in each feed typology. Raw materials were shown to have higher ΣREE concentrations (mean concentration 2.4 mg kg−1) than complete or complementary feed. Considering the animal species, mean ΣREE concentrations were as follows: horse feed (2.7 mg kg−1) &gt; poultry feed &gt; bovine feed &gt; swine feed (0.61 mg kg−1). REE levels in feed were in line with values available in the literature on vegetables; thus, REE concentrations in feed do not constitute a concern for animal health. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={This study was conducted to describe the cheese-making procedure of Fontina Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) cheese and to evaluate the behavior of Escherichia coli O157:H7 during cheese manufacture and ripening. The study was divided into 2 phases: the production of Fontina PDO cheese was monitored at 3 different dairies in the Aosta Valley and an E. coli O157 challenge was conducted at a fourth dairy. The dairies employ different commercial starter cultures for cheese making. The growth of lactic acid bacilli (LAB) and the decrease in pH were slower in the first hours and the LAB concentrations were overall higher in dairy A than in the other 2 dairies. The pH remained substantially unchanged during ripening (range 5.2 to 5.4) in all dairies. Water activity remained constant at around 0.98 until d 21, when it decreased to around 0.97 until d 80 in dairies A and B and 0.95 in dairy E. Whole raw cow milk was used for making Fontina cheese according to the standard procedure. For the experimental production, the milk was inoculated with E. coli O157:H7 at a concentration of approximately 5 log10 cfu/mL and commercial starter cultures were used according to the Fontina PDO regulation. An increase of 2.0 log10 cfu/g in E. coli O157:H7 was observed during the first 9.5 h of cheese making, followed by a decrease at 46 h when pH decreased to 5.4 in all trials. Fresh cheeses were salted and held at 10°C for ripening for 80 d. Water activity was decreased to 0.952 at the end of the ripening stage. The LAB concentrations declined gradually; this trend was more marked for the lactobacilli than either the thermophilic or the mesophilic lactococci. The increase in LAB count and the decrease in pH in the first hours did not seem to affect E. coli O157 growth. Ripening was found to inhibit pathogen survival, however, as seen in the reduction of 3 log10 from the maximum concentration measured during the earlier stages of production. © 2018 American Dairy Science Association},

abstract={Small Ruminant Lentivirus (SRLV) subtype E1, also known as Roccaverano strain, is considered a low pathogenic virus on the basis of natural genetic deletions, in vitro properties and on-farm observations. In order to gain more knowledge on this atypical lentivirus we investigated the in vivo tropism of Roccaverano strain in both, experimentally and naturally infected goats. Antibody responses were monitored as well as tissue distribution and viral load, evaluated by real time PCR on single spliced (gag/env) and multiple spliced (rev) RNA targets respectively, that were compared to histopathological lesions. Lymph nodes, spleen, alveolar macrophages and mammary gland turned out to be the main tissue reservoirs of genotype E1-provirus. Moreover, mammary gland and/or mammary lymph nodes acted as active replication sites in dairy goats, supporting the lactogenic transmission of this virus. Notably, a direct association between viral load and concomitant infection or inflammatory processes was evident within organs such as spleen, lung and testis. Our results validate the low pathogenicity designation of SRLV genotype E1 in vivo, and confirm the monocyte-macrophage cell lineage as the main virus reservoir of this genotype. Accordingly, SRLV genotype E displays a tropism towards all tissues characterized by an abundant presence of these cells, either for their own anatomical structure or for an occasional infectious/inflammatory status. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Leigh syndrome (LS) associated with cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency is an early onset, fatal mitochondrial encephalopathy, leading to multiple neurological failure and eventually death, usually in the first decade of life. Mutations in SURF1, a nuclear gene encoding a mitochondrial protein involved in COX assembly, are among the most common causes of LS. LSSURF1 patients display severe, isolated COX deficiency in all tissues, including cultured fibroblasts and skeletal muscle. Recombinant, constitutive SURF1−/− mice show diffuse COX deficiency, but fail to recapitulate the severity of the human clinical phenotype. Pigs are an attractive alternative model for human diseases, because of their size, as well as metabolic, physiological and genetic similarity to humans. Here, we determined the complete sequence of the swine SURF1 gene, disrupted it in pig primary fibroblast cell lines using both TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing systems, before finally generating SURF1−/− and SURF1−/+ pigs by Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer (SCNT). SURF1−/− pigs were characterized by failure to thrive, muscle weakness and highly reduced life span with elevated perinatal mortality, compared to heterozygous SURF1−/+ and wild type littermates. Surprisingly, no obvious COX deficiency was detected in SURF1−/− tissues, although histochemical analysis revealed the presence of COX deficiency in jejunum villi and total mRNA sequencing (RNAseq) showed that several COX subunit-encoding genes were significantly down-regulated in SURF1−/− skeletal muscles. In addition, neuropathological findings, indicated a delay in central nervous system development of newborn SURF1−/− piglets. Our results suggest a broader role of sSURF1 in mitochondrial bioenergetics. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Aedes albopictus has spread during the last few decades all over the world. This has increased significantly the risk of exotic arbovirus transmission (e.g. chikungunya, dengue, and Zika) also in temperate areas, as demonstrated by the Chikungunya 2007 and 2017 outbreaks in northeastern and central Italy. Insecticides are an important tool for limiting the circulation of these mosquito-borne viruses. The aim of the present study was to address the gap in current knowledge of pyrethroid insecticide resistance of European Ae. albopictus populations, focusing on populations from Italy, Albania and Greece. RESULTS: Bioassays for resistance to permethrin (0.75%), α-cypermethrin (0.05%) or deltamethrin (0.05%) were performed according to World Health Organization (WHO) protocols and showed reduced susceptibility (<90% mortality) of some Italian populations to permethrin and α-cypermethrin, but not to deltamethrin. CONCLUSION: This study reports the first evidence of resistance to pyrethroids in adult Italian Ae. albopictus populations. Results refer to the season preceding the Chikungunya 2017 outbreak in central Italy and highlight the need to increase efforts to monitor the spread of insecticide resistance and the need to develop strategies to limit the spread of insecticide resistance, particularly in areas where extensive treatments have been carried out to contain disease outbreaks. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry},

abstract={Arsenic (As) is a global contaminant of terrestrial and aquatic environments posing concern for environmental and human health. The effects of subacute concentrations of arsenic trioxide (As III ) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA V ) were examined using Crandell Rees feline kidney (CRFK), human hepatocellular carcinoma (PLC/PRF/5), and epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC). Whole monolayer with suffering cells (confluence 100%, pyknosis and refractive cells; value scale = 2) led to identification of subacute As concentrations for the three cell lines. The selected As III concentrations were 1.33 µM for CRFK and 33.37 µM for PLC/PRF/5 and EPC, at 48 hr time point. The selected DMA V concentrations were 0.67 mM for PLC/PRF/5, 1.33 mM for CRFK, and 2.67 mM for EPC for 48 hr. Unlike the As III test, the three cell lines did not exhibit marked susceptibility to DMA V -mediated toxicity. Several oxidative stress biomarker levels, directly or indirectly associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination including superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidases, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase, glyoxalase I, glyoxalase II, and total glutathione, were determined in the three cell lines at 24 and 48 hr. Antioxidant responses in metal-treated cells were significantly altered compared to controls, suggesting a perturbation of redox state. The weakening of antioxidant pathway in either healthy or tumoral cells was greater using As III than DMA V . Differences in level of several oxidative stress biomarkers suggest that the oxidative stress mechanism induced by As III is distinctly different from DMA V . Multifaceted mechanisms of action underlying ROS generation in tumor and nontumor cells versus As III and DMA V exposure are thus involved. Since As-mediated toxicity is quite complex, more data regarding both oxidant-enhancement and oxidant-lowering strategies may be useful to improve knowledge regarding the influence of As on human and animal cells. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis is the causative agent of caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) in domestic and wild ruminants. Here we describe CLA in alpine chamois (Rupicapra r. rupicapra) based on a series of 98 cases of C. pseudotuberculosis infection confirmed by bacteriology and gene sequence analysis. The population included 53 males and 45 females distributed within three age groups: up to 18 months (n = 14), 18 months to 4 years (n = 11) and over 4 years (n = 73). Four different gross lesion distribution patterns, observed individually or variably combined in the same animal, were defined: (1) cutaneous/external (i.e. subcutaneous lymph nodes with or without muscle involvement, n = 34); (2) abdominal visceral (i.e. only abdominal organs involved: liver and/or spleen and/or kidney and/or lymph nodes, n = 35); (3) thoracic visceral (i.e. only thoracic organs involved: lung and/or heart and/or lymph nodes, n = 26); and (4) generalized visceral (i.e. abdominal and thoracic organs involved, n = 26). In six particularly severe cases, mammary gland, testis, vertebral bone and the central nervous system were also affected. Macroscopically, most abscesses were characterized by fluid pus, confirmed by microscopy that showed the absence of distinct concentric layers and coagulative necrosis, which are typically seen in sheep and goats raised in areas where the infection is endemic. In three cases amyloid deposits were observed in the liver and kidney. The C. pseudotuberculosis strains isolated were highly homologous to the reference strain ATCC 19410, except for some variability in their ability to ferment maltose and mannitol. Based on the production of nitrate reductase, 95 strains were attributed to the ovis biovar (nitrate reduction negative) and three to the equi biovar (nitrate reduction positive). All strains were sensitive to antibiotics, except to ampicillin (62.3% resistant strains) and gentamicin (83.7% resistant strains). Using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay designed for CLA in sheep and goats, seven (58.3%) of 12 serum samples tested positive for antibodies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={We tested cadmium (Cd2+) effects on porcine IPEC-J2 cells, which represent an in vitro model of the interaction between intestinal cells and both infectious and non-infectious stressors. Accordingly, we investigated the effects of low (2 μM) to moderate (20 μM) concentrations of Cd2+, in terms of pro-inflammatory gene expression and protein release, as well as of infectivity in a Salmonella typhimurium penetration model. Our data showed a significant (P <.001) increase of intracellular Cd2+ after 3, 6 and 24 h of exposure with respect to levels at 1 h. These data showed the ability of IPEC-J2 to absorb Cd2+ as a function of both time and concentration. Also, the absorption of this heavy metal was related to a significant modulation of important pro-inflammatory messengers. In particular, down-regulation of IL-8 was associated with a significant decrease of Salmonella typhimurium ability to penetrate into IPEC-J2 cells, in agreement with a previous study in which an anti-IL 8 antibody could significantly inhibit Salmonella penetration into the same cells (Razzuoli et al., 2017). This finding demonstrates the ability of Cd2+ to affect the outcome of an important host-pathogen relationship. In conclusion, our study highlighted the ability of an environmental pollutant like Cd2+ to modulate innate immune responses in terms of chemokine release and gene expression, and susceptibility to microbial infections. © 2018},

abstract={This article summarizes the 2016 update of the DISCONTOOLS project gap analysis on bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), which was based on a combination of literature review and expert knowledge. Uncertainty still exists in relation to the pathogenesis, immunology and epidemiology of BSE, but provided that infected material is prohibited from entering the animal feed chain, cases should continue to decline. BSE does not appear to spread between cattle, but if new strains with this ability appear then control would be considerably more difficult. Atypical types of BSE (L-BSE and H-BSE) have been identified, which have different molecular patterns and pathology, and do not display the same clinical signs as classical BSE. Laboratory transmission experiments indicate that the L-BSE agent has zoonotic potential. There is no satisfactory conclusion regarding the origin of the BSE epidemic. C-BSE case numbers declined rapidly following strict controls banning ruminant protein in animal feed, but occasional cases still occur. It is unclear whether these more recent cases indicate inadequate implementation of the bans, or the possibility that C-BSE might occur spontaneously, as has been postulated for H- and L-BSE. All of this will have implications once existing bans and levels of surveillance are both relaxed. Immunochemical tests can only be applied post-mortem. There is no immunological basis for diagnosis in the live animal. All aspects of disease control are expensive, particularly surveillance, specified risk material removal and feed controls. There is pressure to relax feed controls, and concurrent pressure from other sources to reduce surveillance. While the cost benefit argument can be applied successfully to either of these approaches, it would be necessary to maintain the ban on intraspecies recycling and some baseline surveillance. However, the potential risk is not limited to intraspecies recycling; recycling with cross-species transmission may be an ideal way to select or/and modify properties of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies agents in the future. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Monitoring of small ruminants for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) has recently become more relevant after two natural scrapie suspected cases of goats were found to be positive for classical BSE (C-BSE). C-BSE probably established itself in this species unrecognized, undermining disease control measures. This opens the possibility that TSEs in goats may remain an animal source for human prion diseases. Currently, there are no data regarding the natural presence of the atypical BSE in caprines. Here we report that C-BSE and L-type atypical BSE (L-BSE) isolates from bovine species are intracerebrally transmissible to goats, with a 100% attack rate and a significantly shorter incubation period and survival time after C-BSE than after L-BSE experimental infection, suggesting a lower species barrier for classical agentin goat. All animals showed nearly the same clinical features of disease characterized by skin lesions, including broken hair and alopecia, and abnormal mental status. Histology and immunohistochemistry showed several differences between C-BSE and L-BSE infection, allowing discrimination between the two different strains. The lymphoreticular involvement we observed in the C-BSE positive goats argues in favour of a peripheral distribution of PrPSc similar to classical scrapie. Western blot and other currently approved screening tests detected both strains in the goats and were able to classify negative control animals. These data demonstrate that active surveillance of small ruminants, as applied to fallen stock and/or healthy slaughter populations in European countries, is able to correctly identify and classify classical and L-BSE and ultimately protect public health. © 2018 Vallino Costassa et al.

abstract={Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is a neurological disorder characterized by cerebellar dysfunction. The possible association between metals and neurodegenerative diseases is under constant investigation, with particular focus on their involvement in oxidative stress and their potential role as biomarkers of these pathologies. Whole blood samples of SCA2 patients and of healthy individuals were subjected to multi-elemental analysis by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Reduced levels of manganese and copper were found in SCA2 patients, while zinc and vanadium concentrations were significantly higher in patients compared to controls. Copper, manganese and zinc are cofactors of many enzymes (such as superoxide dismutase, SOD) involved in the cellular antioxidant response, whereas vanadium is a transition metal able to produce reactive radicals. A marked decrease of the antioxidant response has been previously reported in SCA2 patients. We suggest that an unbalance of transitional elements in the blood may reflect altered antioxidant homeostasis in SCA2 patients and could constitute a future peripheral biomarker for this disease. In addition, we suggest a possible role of vanadium in the altered lipid metabolism of SCA2 patients. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={We present a novel approach of using the multi-criteria pathogen prioritisation methodology as a basis for selecting the most appropriate case studies for a generic risk assessment framework. The approach uses selective criteria to rank exotic animal health pathogens according to the likelihood of introduction and the impact of an outbreak if it occurred in the European Union (EU). Pathogens were evaluated based on their impact on production at the EU level and international trade. A subsequent analysis included criteria of relevance to quantitative risk assessment case study selection, such as the availability of data for parameterisation, the need for further research and the desire for the case studies to cover different routes of transmission. The framework demonstrated is flexible with the ability to adjust both the criteria and their weightings to the user's requirements. A web based tool has been developed using the RStudio shiny apps software, to facilitate this. © 2018},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Donkey milk is considered as a functional food for sensitive consumers, such as children who are allergic to cow milk. No information is available regarding the effect of farming systems on the quality of donkey milk. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of the farming system and lactation stage on donkey milk with respect to gross composition, as well as fat-soluble vitamins and fatty acids (FA). RESULTS: Individual milk samples were collected from lactating jennies (n = 53) on the six of the largest farms located in North West Italy. The performance of lactating jennies, herd characteristics and feeding strategies were recorded at each milk sampling. The gross composition of the milk, along with the fat-soluble vitamin content, differed in accordance with the farming system. The lactation stage had limited effects on milk quality. A higher milk fat content corresponded to a higher amount of fresh herbage proportion in the diet, with the highest polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), C18:1c9, C18:3n-3, n-3 FA, retinol and α-tocopherol content and the lowest concentrations of the FA that are less favorable for human health in the milk of animals fed on only forage diets. CONCLUSION: Extensive farming of dairy donkeys increased the fat content and fat-soluble vitamin concentration of milk and also altered the FA composition to a more favorable profile for human nutrition. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry},

abstract={Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of food-borne intoxications. Several staphylococcal food poisoning outbreaks have been linked to consumption of raw milk cheeses and artisanal cheese production. However, information on Staph. aureus isolated from artisanal raw milk cheeses and small-scale dairy production environments is very limited. Therefore, we aimed to characterize Staph. aureus isolated along the artisanal raw milk production chain by determining (1) the population structure, and (2) the presence/absence of enterotoxin genes, mecA/C, and pvl. We collected 276 samples from different production stages (raw milk, whey, curd, brine, drying worktops, and cheese) at 36 artisan dairies in Italy. A total of 102 samples from 25 dairies tested positive for Staph. aureus, with 80% positive samples among the tested artisan cheeses. All isolates were further characterized by spa typing and PCR screening for staphylococcal enterotoxin genes, the mecA/mecC genes characteristic for methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus, and the pvl gene encoding Panton-Valentine leukocidin. The 102 isolates represented 15 different spa types and were assigned to 32 different Staph. aureus strains. The spa type most frequently detected was t2953 (30%), which is associated with genotype B strains causing high within-herd levels of bovine mastitis. In addition, 3 novel spa types (t13269, t13277, and t13278) were identified. Although none of the strains harbored mecA/mecC or pvl, 55% of the isolates exhibited at least one enterotoxin gene. Many strains were present in samples from multiple dairies from different regions and years, highlighting the spread of Staph. aureus in small-scale cheese production plants. Our findings demonstrate that enterotoxigenic Staph. aureus and in particular t2953 (genotype B) isolates commonly occur in artisanal dairies and raw milk cheeses in Italy. It is particularly alarming that 80% of the artisan cheeses sampled in our study were positive for Staph. aureus. These findings stress the need for effective measures preventing staphylococcal food poisoning by limiting Staph. aureus growth and enterotoxin formation along the production chain and in the final product. © 2018 American Dairy Science Association},

abstract={Seaweeds have been used as animal feed since a long time and are consumed as food in several cultures. In fact, macroalgae are a source of protein, fiber, polyunsaturated fat, and minerals. The concentration of trace elements was determined in dominant macroalga species from three sites of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. A high interspecies variability was observed, with higher metal levels in brown and green than those in red seaweeds. The maximum values set by European regulations for arsenic, mercury, and cadmium in food and feed were never exceeded, but a few samples were very close to limits set for mercury. Conversely, the maximum limit for lead in feed was exceeded in all species from one of the considered sites. Analogously, lead in seaweeds could constitute a potential risk for human health, due to the exceeding of the maximum value set for food supplements. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

No histologic lesions were found in 47% (28/60) of the specimens. Five (8%, 5/60) samples were unsuitable for analysis. Analysis with PCR detected Brucella spp., morbillivirus, and Toxoplasma gondii infection in one, six, and seven individuals, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed positivity for morbillivirus and for T. gondii infection in three cases each. No evidence of the scrapie-associated prion protein PrPSc was detected. Our findings underscore the importance of an adequate surveillance system for monitoring aquatic mammal pathologies and for protecting both animal and human health. © Wildlife Disease Association 2018.},

abstract={Background: Sarcoptic mange has recently emerged in wild boar in Switzerland, raising the question of the origin of the infection. The main aim of this study was to assess the extent of exposure of the wild boar populations to Sarcoptes scabiei in Switzerland, prior to and after the detection of mange cases, to determine whether the mite has been recently introduced into the populations concerned. We performed a serological survey using a commercially available ELISA and 1056 archived blood samples of free-ranging wild boar from Switzerland. To facilitate the interpretation of the obtained data, we additionally estimated seroprevalence in wild boar populations of four other European countries (1060 samples), both from areas with confirmed clinical cases of mange and from areas without reported cases in wild boar. Lastly, we revised the evaluation of the commercial ELISA when used with wild boar sera. Results: Seropositive reactions were observed for samples from all five countries and from 15 of the 16 study areas. The obtained apparent seroprevalences ranged from 0.0% (0/82; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.0-4.4) to 17.4% (8/46; 95% CI: 7.8-31.4). Wild boar from study areas with known clinical cases and those ≤60 kg were four times more likely to be seropositive than wild boar from areas without reported cases and > 60 kg, respectively. Optical density values did not differ between the two types of study areas among seropositive samples but were significantly lower among seronegative samples from areas without than from areas with clinical cases. No difference was observed between the two sampling periods in Switzerland. The revised ELISA specificity was 96.8% (984/1017; 95% CI: 95.5-97.7) when wild boar from areas without history of mange were considered truly negative. Conclusions: Seropositivity to S. scabiei is more frequent and occurs over a larger geographic range than expected. Data suggest that the parasite is endemic within the wild boar populations of Switzerland and other European countries but that its presence is not necessarily associated with disease occurrence. Extrinsic factors which trigger disease emergence in infected populations remain to be investigated. The applied ELISA represents a promising tool for future studies. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: Caprine herpesvirus 1 (CpHV-1) causes neonatal mortality and reproductive failure in goats. Despite its impact on herd reproductive performance, few studies have investigated the risk factors associated with CpHV-1 infection. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to identify potential herd- and host-level risk factors associated with CpHV-1 prevalence in a goat population with heterogeneous seropositivity for CpHV-1. Results: Blood samples and individual data from 4542 goats were collected from 255 herds in Piedmont, Italy. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and serum neutralization tests were carried out to detect antibodies against CpHV-1. A mixed-effects model was applied to identify any statistical association between CpHV-1 seropositivity and a set of putative host-level and herd-level risk factors. A total of 630 samples tested were found positive by ELISA (prevalence = 13.9%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 12.9-14.9). Of the 255 tested herds, 85 were classified as positive for the presence of at least one gB-positive animal (herd prevalence 33.3%, 95% CI 27.5-39.2), with a within-herd prevalence between 0.7 and 100% (Q1 = 17.6%; median = 32.3%; Q3 = 50%) (Q = quartiles). The prevalence ratios showed a statistical association with the following risk factors: breeds other than Saanen, older age, larger herd size, meat and extensive herds, and co-existence of CAEV-infected animals. Conclusions: Results from this cross sectional study may help to elucidate the natural history of the infection and inform targeted strategies to control a disease with a potentially important impact on animal health and goat farming economy. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={In May 2016, two separate clusters of febrile gastroenteritis caused by Listeria monocytogenes were detected by the local health authority in Piedmont, in northern Italy. We carried out epidemiological, microbiological and traceback investigations to identify the source. The people affected were students and staff members from two different schools in two different villages located in the Province of Turin; five of them were hospitalised. The epidemiological investigation identified a cooked beef ham served at the school canteens as the source of the food-borne outbreak. L. monocytogenes was isolated from the food, the stools of the hospitalised pupils and the environment of the factory producing the cooked beef ham. All isolates except one were serotype 1/2a, shared an indistinguishable PFGE pattern and were 100% identical by whole genome sequencing (WGS). By combining a classical epidemiological approach with both molecular subtyping and WGS techniques, we were able to identify and confirm a Listeria gastroenteritis outbreak associated with consumption of sliced cold beef ham. © 2018, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

abstract={Currently, although the prevalence of brucellosis in Kazakhstan remains high, there are limited data available on the genetic diversity of circulating Brucella strains. Here, MLVA was employed to genotype a panel of 102 Brucella isolates collected from eight Kazakh regions and neighboring countries (Russia, Kyrgyzstan) during the period 1935–2017. MLVA-11 analysis classified 64 B. abortus strains into genotypes 72, 82, 331, 71, 341 and 69, while one genotype was novel, having no correspondence within the MLVA international database. MLVA-11 analysis of 37 B. melitensis strains showed 100% identity with genotypes 116, 114 and 11. One B. suis strain was classified into genotype 33. Phylogeography based on MLVA-15 demonstrated that all B. abortus and B. melitensis strains belonged to “Abortus C” and “East Mediterranean” lineages, respectively. B. abortus strains from Kazakhstan and Russia resulted genetically related to Portuguese, Brazilian and US isolates, suggesting ancient spread of these lineages from Europe westwards to South America and eastwards to Turkey, Russia and Asia. Most of Kazakh B. melitensis isolates were related to strains circulating in China, likely due to long-term trading partnerships between the two countries. In fine-scale MLVA-15 analysis, 17 B. abortus and 12 B. melitensis genotypes were identified; among them 12 are novel. Interestingly, epidemiological information supporting molecular data were retrieved for two clusters within the B. abortus group, thus proving that MLVA is an appropriate tool for effective traceback analyses. Our findings suggest that molecular genotyping should be applied systematically to support control plans for eradication of brucellosis in Kazakhstan. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The prevalence and genetic diversity of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) in a geographic area are largely influenced by live animal trade and management practices. Despite control and eradication programs currently underway in several European countries, the risk of BVDV spread within and among countries is still present. BVDV-1 is the predominant type circulating in European cattle population. In this study, a phylogeographic analysis was applied to the BVDV-1 highest prevalent subtypes in Italy to reconstruct the origin and spatial-temporal distribution and to trace main viral flows between different locations to highlight priority areas for BVDV control. A comprehensive dataset of BVDV-1b (n = 173) and 1e (n = 172) 5′ UTR sequences was analysed, including both novel and published sequences from Italy and from European countries bordering and/or with commercial cattle flows with Italy. A common phylogeographic pattern was observed for BVDV-1b and 1e subtypes: interspersion from multiple Italian areas and European countries was widespread until the end of the last century, whereas significant local clusters were observed starting from 2000. These findings support a continuous viral flow among different areas over long time scales with no evidence of significant geographical structure, while local transmission networks are limited to more recent years. Northern Italy has been confirmed as the area of origin of the main clades of both BVDV subtypes at national level, acting both as a crucial area for introduction and a maintenance source for other areas. Piedmont, Central and Southern Italian regions contributed to limited geographical distribution and local BVDV-1b and 1e persistence. On the whole, priority control measures for BVDV-1b and 1e in Italy should be focused on: i) implementation of BVDV systematic control in all Northern Italian regions to break the viral flow from larger to smaller animal populations; and ii) breaking the dynamics of infections in regions with self-maintenance of BVDV by voluntary control programs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The concentrations of trace and non-trace elements were determined in blood and fibers of alpacas (Vicugna pacos) from a north Italian area, as well as in their pasture forages. This is the first investigation regarding this species in Italy, and the first considering alpaca’s fiber as bioindicator worldwide. Metal contents in blood were in the decreasing order: copper &gt; zinc &gt; aluminum &gt; selenium &gt; lead &gt; nickel &gt; manganese &gt; chromium &gt; arsenic and cadmium, while in fiber, metal levels were in the following order: aluminum &gt; zinc &gt; copper &gt; manganese &gt; chromium &gt; nickel &gt; selenium &gt; lead &gt; arsenic and cadmium. Antimony, beryllium, mercury, tin, and thallium were below the limit of quantification (0.010 mg kg−1). The analysis of the alpacas’ forage confirmed the same trend found in fiber, suggesting that metal bioaccumulation was affected by diet. These preliminary results have shown that all the trace elements studied bioaccumulated to a greater extent in the fibers of the alpaca than in the blood. Accordingly, we may suggest that alpaca fibers could be used for monitoring exposure especially to non-essential metals like aluminum, cadmium, and lead, and could constitute a suitable non-invasive method for measuring trace and non-trace element exposure in camelids. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Canine kobuviruses (CaKoVs) were first identified in diarrhoeic and asymptomatic dogs in 2011 in the USA. Subsequent studies have demonstrated a worldwide distribution of these viruses, but it is not clear if CaKoVs play a role as enteric pathogens of dogs. More recently, CaKoV RNA has been detected in wild carnivores, including red fox, golden jackal, side-striped jackal and spotted hyena. In this study, we addressed the hypothesis that wolves are susceptible to CaKoV infections. A total of 185 wolf stool samples were collected from necropsied animals and from transects in the Liguria, Piemonte and Valle D’Aosta regions of Italy, and CaKoV RNA was identified in two of these specimens. Both samples were obtained from necropsied wolves, with a prevalence rate of 4.9% (2/41). Sequence analysis of the full-length VP1 region showed that these strains displayed the highest nucleotide (nt) sequence identity (86.3-98.5%) to canine strains identified in the UK and Africa, and to kobuviruses that were previously detected in other African wild carnivores. This suggests that genetically related CaKoV strains circulate in domestic and wild carnivores, with interspecies transmission being not uncommon among carnivores of different ecosystems. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Summer mortality episodes in adult Pacific oysters have been described since the 1950s in various farming areas. Starting in 2012, a recrudescence of mortalities in commercial-sized oysters was first observed in France and then in Italy, with seasonality extension and translation later in the year. Moribund individuals collected during an event in Italy in December 2014 showed yellowish lesions of the mantle and adductor muscle. Histological examination revealed filamentous bacteria associated with necrotic areas. Quantitative PCRs targeting OsHV-1 and Vibrio aestuarianus detected only high loads of the pathogenic bacteria in tissues of symptomatic individuals. A lower diversity of the hemolymph microbiota was also evidenced in moribund individuals, with a predominance of Vibrio and Arcobacter species. A strain of Flavobacteriaceae was isolated from all the symptomatic individuals. Sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene identified the strain as Tenacibaculum soleae. When strain pathogenicity was tested by injection in adult individuals, it induced mortality rates of up to 45%, even in the absence of V. aestuarianus. As mortality occurred only 11 days post-infection, further investigation is needed to determine its effective virulence in natural conditions. This is the first description of a Tenacibaculum strain associated with bivalve mortalities. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Cancer stem cell (CSC) self-renewing and drug resistance cause treatment failure and tumor recurrence. Osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone tumor characterized by biological and molecular heterogeneity, possibly dependent on CSCs. CSC identification in osteosarcoma and their efficient targeting are still open questions. Spontaneous canine osteosarcoma shares clinical and biological features with the human tumors, representing a model for translational studies. We characterized three CSC-enriched canine osteosarcoma cultures. In serum-free conditions, these CSC cultures grow as anchorage-independent spheroids, show mesenchymal-like properties and in vivo tumorigenicity, recapitulating the heterogeneity of the original osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma CSCs express stem-related factors (Sox2, Oct4, CD133) and chemokine receptors and ligands (CXCR4, CXCL12) involved in tumor proliferation and self-renewal. Standard drugs for osteosarcoma treatment (doxorubicin and cisplatin) affected CSC-enriched and parental primary cultures, showing different efficacy within tumors. Moreover, metformin, a type-2 diabetes drug, significantly inhibits osteosarcoma CSC viability, migration and self-renewal and, in co-treatment with doxorubicin and cisplatin, enhances drug cytotoxicity. Collectively, we demonstrate that canine osteosarcoma primary cultures contain CSCs exhibiting distinctive sensitivity to anticancer agents, as a reliable experimental model to assay drug efficacy. We also provide proof-of-principle of metformin efficacy, alone or in combination, as pharmacological strategy to target osteosarcoma CSCs. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

funding_text 1={OSA is a mesenchymal malignancy of bones that shares genetic and molecular alterations, histopathology, frequency of microscopic metastases at diagnosis, and clinical behavior in humans and dogs [31] . Conventional chemotherapeutic agents (including cisplatin and doxorubicin) prolong OSA patient's lifespan without increasing survival rate, which remains poor due to development of microscopic or diffuse chemotherapy-resistant metastases [75] . Therefore, alterative adjuvant therapies for improving management of OSA progression are urgently warranted. CSC model proposes that a subset of tumorigenic cells endowed with stem-like properties drives tumor initiation, metastasis, drug resistance, and recurrence. This model gained increasing relevance in many solid cancers, including OSA, likely representing a biological correlate for the aggressive clinical behavior of these tumors. Isolation and characterization of CSCs represents a key step to study OSA pathogenesis and biology and develop more efficacious therapies. In particular, the identification of human and canine CSCs derived from surgical tissues of OSA contributed to clarify their stem-like features and, prospectively, to develop targeted drugs to eradicate this cell subpopulation [30,76,77] . In the current study we assessed the biological and pharmacological properties of three patient-derived canine OSA cultures. All cultures showed ability to grow as spheroids in growth factor-containing medium, forming either compact spheres or loose aggregates, which retained self-renewal ability for multiple passages. Spherogenesis has been indeed exploited as one of the methods to identify CSCs in vitro , reflecting the capacity of cells endowed with stem-like properties to grow under non-adherent conditions. In particular, spherogenesis was used to identify, by self renew ability, CSC subsets in cell lines and primary tumors from human and canine OSA [11,38,77] , as well as from several other cancer types [78,79] . In vitro self-renewal ability is not exclusive for CSCs [80] , thus in vivo tumorigenicity of OSA CSC cultures assessed after various enrichment approaches (expression and activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase, side population isolation, spherogenesis, differential marker expression) [81–84] , represents the crucial method to validate putative CSCs. In particular, the serial transplantation of low number of CSC candidates into immunocompromised mice (tumor-initiating activity) is, to date, considered the only definitive proof of the presence of CSCs in a given culture. We report that cells isolated from canine primary OSA, and grown in vitro as sarcospheres, possess high tumorigenic capacity in vivo . OSA1, OSA2 and OSA3 cultures xenotransplanted in mice, achieved 100% engraftment and developed tumors which recapitulate the original tumor histology. Tumor development was obtained using significantly lower cells (15×10 4 ) than reported in other studies ( e.g. 3×10 6 cells of human osteosarcoma 3AB-OS CSCs isolated from human osteosarcoma MG63 cells, [85] , or a subset of OSA cells sorted from OS99-1 cell line for ALDH enzymatic activity, in which tumor formation was highly dependent on the number of injected cells, likely suggesting that tumorigenic cells were extremely rare [86] ). The tumor-initiating ability of sarcosphere cells, also considering that the parental primary cultures were not able to consistently give rise to tumors in the same experimental conditions, definitely demonstrates the stem nature of these OSA cultures. Moreover, OSA cells obtained from excised xenografts re-cultured in vitro exhibited stem-cell like functional characteristics such as spherogenesis. Second transplant of OSA1 CSCs successfully engrafts and initiates tumor in new recipient mice, preserving the original histopathologic appearance of original canine OSA, also observed in the primary xenografts, indicating that the in vitro experimental conditions we adopted do not impair tumor-initiating potential of these cells. OSA1 non-CSCs derived from primary xenograft tumors formed secondary neoplasms with a higher efficiency than the first injection (in which only small tumors developed) suggesting that in vivo growth favors the amplification of the CSC-like population, as also shown by the increased detection of stem cell markers in histological preparations from the tumors developed after the second injection. The observation that, differently from CSCs, the first injection of non-CSCs failed to form consistent tumors suggests that sarcosphere cells are essentially different from their original counterparts, and initial OSA primary cultures contain a limited number of CSCs among the large number of non-CSCs; conversely, CSC subpopulations are enriched in vitro by stem-permissive culturing and in vivo by transplantation in mice, and can be found in both conditions after the second mouse transplant. By enriching the cultures in OSA CSC subpopulation, xenografts enhance the aggressive and self-renewing potential of these cells, and amplify the proportion of cells expressing proteins able to sustain tumor growth and stemness ( i.e. Oct4, CD117, STAT3, CXCR4, CXCL12). The differential tumor-initiating ability between CSCs and non-CSCs was previously reported, nevertheless a direct confrontation between the two populations derived from the same primary tumor was rarely performed. Murase et al. detected higher tumorigenic ability of sorted side population cells from the bone malignant fibrous histiocytoma cell line MFH2003 compared to the main population cells [82] . Mesenchymal tumor transplantation (1 osteosarcoma, and 2 malignant fibrous histocytomas, 1 synovial sarcoma) into NOD/SCID mice showed that tumors were generated with higher frequency and smaller numbers of side population cells as compared with main population cells [87] . Although a definitive panel of antigens unequivocally identifying CSCs in OSA and other solid cancers is not available [88] , we combined tumorigenic and spherogenic activities with the analysis of the expression of some stem-related markers, to assess changes in CSC content after in vivo growth. We show the concomitant expression of CD133, Oct4, and Sox2 in OSA spheroids, suggestive of stem-cell like [83,89,90] including canine OSA [77,91] . In particular, CD133 expression has been correlated with the gain of tumorigenic activity by OSA cells [84] , although it has to be remarked that both CD133-positive and -negative cells are able to propagate tumors in vivo [92,93] . On the whole, these results support that a combination of CD133 + with other pluripotency factors characterize the stem-like phenotype of OSA CSCs. CSCs are also responsible for the formation of metastasis. Among proliferation- and metastasis-associated proteins in CSCs, the cytokine CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 contribute to bone sarcoma progression and metastatic diffusion [94] . Few studies explored the biological relevance of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in canine OSA [95] , showing high expression of both proteins similarly to other canine solid tumors [55] . In the present study, CXCL12/CXCR4 expression within sarcospheres well-matches with their diffuse detection in tumor xenografts and original OSA tissues of the corresponding dogs (see Tables), suggesting that the regulation of CSC invasive behavior by this chemokine system involve autocrine/paracrine activity besides the chemokinergic stimuli produced by tumor microenvironment. This hypothesis is supported by our observation that CXCL12 stimulates OSA CSC proliferation and migration, representing a chemotactic factor likely directing the migration of CXCR4-positive CSCs toward CXCL12 producing organs. The complexity of OSA CSC characterization also resides in the originating cell types: mesenchymal cells are one of the cell populations which drive OSA development [13] , since these cells are involved in normal bone formation by differentiation into osteoblasts and possibly also into adipocytes and chondrocytes. We show that canine OSA sarcosphere cells possess multipotency, with OSA1 CSCs able to differentiate in all the three lineages, and OSA2 and OSA3 CSCs showing higher propensity to differentiate into osteoblasts than in chondrocytes and adypocytes. Overall these findings suggest that OSA CSCs retain a different degree of mesenchymal features, correlated with the stage of differentiation of parental cells or the histologic subtype, highlighting that intrinsic heterogeneity of individual tumors may reflect the diverse properties of CSCs. The mesenchymal phenotype of canine OSA CSCs is also suggested by vimentin expression, the most widely accepted mesenchymal marker that is down-regulated in fully differentiated osteoblasts [96] . Moreover, all OSA sarcosphere cells also express osterix, an early/middle osteogenic regulator, which indicates that canine OSA CSCs are likely derived by osteogenic progenitors [97] . The presence of scattered positive cells for type 1 collagen, a late osteogenic marker, in OSA1 and OSA2 spheroids, further confirms the predominance of non-terminally differentiated OSA cells. We therefore propose that CSC cultures isolated form the three OSAs are composed of tumor-initiating cells at distinct differentiation stage, but showing a common, although not identical, phenotype. The prediction of treatment response in aggressive tumors is still an unmet need also because cytotoxicity in vitro assays routinely performed on established cancer cell lines or, rarely, on primary cultures deriving from bulk tumor cells, which have a low translational value [52] . In particular, these models neglect the chemo-sensitivity profile of the minority CSC population which may significantly differ from that of other tumor cell populations. Indeed, although chemo-resistance is not a defining feature for CSC isolation, it could be considered as a relevant CSC property [98] . This issue is even more critical in OSA whose lethality is mainly due to the early onset of metastases and drug resistance. In our study, IC 50 calculations of doxorubicin and cisplatin cytotoxicity, the chemotherapy regimen used in both humans and dogs, showed that canine OSA CSCs are generally less sensitive than the corresponding parental cells, although the difference was significantly higher for cisplatin than for doxorubicin. Previous studies reported that CSCs isolated from OSA cell lines are more resistant to doxorubicin [99] . CSC originating cell type may contribute to the drug responsivity ( e.g . CSCs isolated from established, long-term culture cell lines tend to be more resistant to drugs, because of the more differentiated phenotype or adaptation to in vitro culture conditions), as also observed in glioblastoma CSCs [100] . On the contrary, our CSC cultures exhibited a marked resistance to cisplatin, as observed in stem-like populations from human sarcoma cell lines [99] , and in agreement with the observation that cisplatin-resistant OSA cells exhibited stem-like characteristics both in vitro and in vivo, which are not observed in cisplatin-responsive cells [101] . Repositioning of metformin as antitumor drug [40] was related to the ability to preferentially affect CSC proliferation and survival [45–47] . AMPK activation, and the consequent inhibition of mTOR signaling, was the first proposed mechanism of metformin activity on CSCs [102] , but several AMPK-independent pathways have been also suggested [45,103] . Here we report that metformin significantly impairs survival, migration, and spherogenesis of canine OSA1 and OSA2 CSCs, also when CXCL12, a relevant mediator of OSA progression a diffusion in vivo , was used as proliferative and invasive stimulus. These data support that, besides an antiproliferative and antimetastatic effects, metformin exerts also a direct inhibition of self-renewal. Similar results were obtained in stem-like cells derived from the MG63 cell line, canine mammary carcinoma, human hepatocellular carcinoma or human glioblastoma [28,47,49,104] . Unexpectedly, OSA3 CSCs were less sensitive to metformin. We do not have an explanation for this difference, but it is noteworthy that these individual pharmacological diversities are evidenced only using cells isolated from primary tumors, which thus should represent the more reliable model to translate preclinical data to clinical trials. The high level of intra-tumor heterogeneity of OSA and plasticity of CSCs, which dynamically can undergo differentiation and dedifferentiation [105] , highlights how ideal therapeutic compounds or drug combination must suppress the survival and proliferation of both CSCs and non-CSCs, and metformin, targeting both cancer cell subsets, prospectively provides a rationale for novel therapeutic options against cancer progression. The chemo-sensitizing/adjuvant role of metformin has been postulated in various cancers however, beside preliminary encouraging data, its impact on tumor response is still under investigation [106] . For example, metformin co-treatment enhanced anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of trichostatin A and simvastatin on OSA [107,108] . In our experimental model, the treatment with metformin sensitizes OSA1 and OSA2 CSCs to cisplatin and doxorubicin cytotoxic effects, as also reported in stem-like cells derived from human OSA cell lines [50,51] . Moreover, when OSA CSCs are grown as multicellular spheroids into 3D extracellular matrix, to mimic the in vivo tumor invasive growth in a more realistic model to study the effect of cytotoxic drugs [109] , metformin alone or in combination with cisplatin abolished cell invasion into the surrounding matrix, impairing the invasive phenotype of OSA, the prerequisite for its metastatic spreading. These data support the development of novel clinical trials in which the adjuvant activity of metformin on cytotoxic drug activity may represent a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of OSA. 5},

abstract={Background: The primary aim was to evaluate by means of thromboelastometry (ROTEM) the effects of hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 130/0.4 administered as a constant rate infusion (CRI) on hemostasis in hypoalbuminemic dogs. The second aim was to use ROTEM analysis to detect whether all hypoalbuminemic dogs of our population were hypercoagulable. Results: The study sample was 20 hypoalbuminemic dogs (albumin <2g/dl) with normal perfusion parameters and requiring intravenous fluid therapy. In order to support plasma colloid osmotic pressure, in addition to crystalloid, HES 130/0.4 was administered as a constant rate infusion at 1ml/kg/h (group 1, n=11) or 2ml/kg/h for 24h (group 2, n=9). Blood samples were collected at baseline (T0) and 24h postinfusion (T1); coagulation was assessed by standard coagulation profile (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen), and ROTEM analysis (in-TEM®, ex-TEM® and fib- TEM® profile). No statistically significant differences in ROTEM values in group 1 were observed (P>0.05), whereas in group 2 statistically significant differences (P<0.05) were found at T1 in the in-TEM® profile [decrease in clot formation time (P=0.04) and increase in α angle (P=0.02)] and in the ex-TEM® profile [increase in maximum clot firmness (P=0.008) and α angle (P=0.01)]; no changes were identified in the fib-TEM® profile. In both groups, a statistically significant decrease (P=0.007) in hematocrit was noted, whereas no statistically significant differences in platelet count and standard coagulation profile were found. In group 2, a statistically significant increase in TS values (P=0.03) was noted at T1. ROTEM tracings indicating a hypercoagulable state were observed in 7/20 dogs at T0 (5/11 in group 1 and 2/9 in the group 2). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that HES 130/0.4 administered as CRI does not cause hypocoagulability in hypoalbuminemic dogs. A trend toward hypercoagulability, probably related to the underlying diseases, was observed in group 2 at T1. Although all dogs were hyoalbuminemic, only 7/20 were hypercoagulable at T0, confirming the lack of correlation between albumin level and prothrombotic state. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={A juvenile female striped dolphin Stenella coeruleoalba live stranded on 4 March 2016 at Alassio, western Ligurian Sea coast, Italy. The dolphin died shortly after stranding, and a complete postmortem examination was performed. Necropsy revealed severe tracheal occlusion and unilateral bronchial stenosis with luminal accumulation of abundant green-yellow mucousgelatinous material. Histological features suggestive of tracheobronchial aspergillosis were observed. Cultures of lung tissue and tracheo-bronchial exudate isolated Aspergillus fumigatus, identified by a Microseq D2 LSUrDNA fungal sequencing kit. A pan-Herpesvirus nested-PCR assay on frozen samples obtained from multiple organs was positive. Phylogenetic analysis on the partial DNA polymerase gene revealed that the striped dolphin isolate was closely related to known cetacean Alphaherpesvirus sequences from the same host species. Attempted virus isolation was unsuccessful. The tissue levels of different persistent organic pollutants and the toxicological stress, evaluated using a theoretical model, showed a severely impaired immune response.

In rodents, the immature neurons are restricted to the paleocortex, whereas in other mammals, they are also found in neocortex. Here, we analyzed the DCX-expressing cells in the whole sheep brain of both sexes to search for an indicator of structural plasticity at a cellular level in a relatively large-brained, long-living mammal. Brains from adult and newborn sheep (injected with BrdU and analyzed at different survival times) were processed for DCX, cell proliferation markers (Ki-67, BrdU), pallial/subpallial developmental origin (Tbr1, Sp8), and neuronal/glial antigens for phenotype characterization. We found immature-like neurons in the whole sheep cortex and in large populations of DCX-expressing cells within the external capsule and the surrounding gray matter (claustrum and amygdala). BrdU and Ki-67 detection at neonatal and adult ages showed that all of these DCX + cells were generated during embryogenesis, not after birth. These results show that the adult sheep, unlike rodents, is largely endowed with non-newly generated neurons retaining immature features, suggesting that such plasticity might be particularly important in large-brained, long-living mammals. © 2018 the authors.},

abstract={Mycobacterium bovis, the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis, can infect a wide range of domestic and wild animals. The infection has been described in wild boars (Sus scrofa) as well. In the Western Liguria Region (Northern Italy) the first case of tuberculosis in a wild boar was observed in 1989. To understand the relationship between mycobacterial infections existence in livestock vs wildlife, a surveillance activity, targeting hunted animals, has been carried out over the last 25 years. The aim of this work is to show the local evolution of the disease within the wild boar population based on 2002-2016 data. During the study period, about 48,000 animals were submitted to anatomopathological examination. The majority of affected wild boars were caught during hunting seasons, in territories located nearby infected livestock or pastures where cattle from infected livestock used to graze. The observed decreasing trend in wild boars is likely associated with the progressive fading out of tuberculosis in the local cattle (last outbreak in 2012) that led in 2014 to the recognition of official free status of the province. A different trend has been observed for infections associated to M. microti, a microorganism unrelated to cattle. Our data suggest that wild boar could be considered as a sentinel of M. bovis in an area without necessarily acting as a reservoir or a vector of infection. © 2018 L'Association pour l'Etude de l'Epidemiologie des Maladies Animales.

abstract={The illegal use of glucocorticoids (GCs) as growth-promoters (GPs) is prohibited in farm animals in the European Union because the strong pharmacological activity of most synthetic GCs produces residues that are dangerous for human consumption. Among the alternative methods proposed to increase the efficacy of official controls, histology was the technique of choice in Italy on account of its high performance level. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of immunohistochemistry (IHC) using anti-cleaved-Lamin A antibody to enhance the performance of the histological test applied to GC-related microscopic changes in the thymus. Veal calves (VC) and beef cattle (BC) were raised and both underwent different growth-promoting protocols or were left untreated. The morphology of the thymus parenchyma was evaluated for cortical atrophy with concurrent adipose tissue infiltration, and a score of 1 to 3 was attributed. A semi-quantitative IHC analysis was also performed by counting the number of positive thymocytes in 5 randomly selected high-power fields (HPFs). The distribution of the thymus atrophy scores was significantly different among the subgroups in both BC and VC. The IHC values were higher in untreated than in treated animals, for both BC and VC. The association between thymus atrophy score and IHC positivity showed higher median values in control than in treated animals (independently of the treatment protocol), for both BC and VC. Our data shows that IHC against anti-cleaved-Lamin A antibody is a reliable marker to detect illegal GC treatments, administered either alone or in association with other growth promoters, in both BC and VC. Combining IHC with the thymus atrophy score improves the accuracy of the histological method in correctly identifying treated animals and could represent a valuable, reproducible method to be applied to large-scale screening programmes. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC},

abstract={This chapter describes the prion diseases of cattle, or bovine transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (BoTSEs). “Classic” bovine spongiform encephalopathy (C-BSE), the major prion protein disorder of Bovidae, was first described in 1986. We also describe the spatiotemporal correlation of C-BSE to a novel form of human prion disease, variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD), which led to the classification of BSE as a zoonotic disease (and the “cause” of vCJD) in 1996. From isolated cases first identified retrospectively in May 1985, a major bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) epidemic peaked within the British Isles in 1991, and has so far led to over 195,000 confirmed cases in cattle, and several thousand more cases within Europe and a few elsewhere. By 2017, the disease had been essentially eradicated below the level of surveillance detection in Europe, although sporadic cases are still predicted to show up for several years to come. By 2004, other forms of BSE, H-type and L-type, had been recognized and, in the absence of information to the contrary, are also included in the classification of BSE as a zoonotic prion disease of bovine origin. This chapter aims to cover the clinical, epidemiologic, neuropathologic, biochemical, biomarker, and pathogenetic aspects of the bovine prion disease and gives a brief, but important, description of the surveillance of BSE and other animal TSEs in Europe. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Fish consumption is the principal source of intake of organochlorinated compounds in humans. Compared with other types of foods of animal origin, fish contain the highest levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, and polychlorinated dibenzofurans, all of which are classified as highly toxic organochlorine compounds. Currently, lakes and fish farms in northern Italy are not regularly monitored for PCBs and dioxins in areas contaminated by industrial sources, partially because of the high costs of traditional analytical methods that limit the number of samples to be analyzed. The DR-CALUX cell bioassay is based on the uptake of the cellular aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) for dioxins and dioxin-like compounds. The aim of this study was to assess the levels of dioxins and dioxin-like PCB contamination in Lake Maggiore and Lake Como, two lakes in northwestern Italy, and in nearby areas. The levels were quantified using the cell bioassay DR-CALUX and reference controls in two wild fish species, perch (Perca fluviatilis) and roach (Rutilus rutilus), and in a farmed species, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Tissue samples collected from the farmed rainbow trout were also submitted to immunohistochemical analysis of CYP1A expression as a marker for environmental pollutant-induced liver damage. The levels of dioxins, furans, and dioxin-like PCBs were all below the maximum levels and action limits set by European Union Regulation, suggesting no risk for human health associated with the consumption of the fish species caught or farmed in these areas. © 2018 International Association for Food Protection.},

abstract={Genealogical relationships among colony members, inbreeding status, and presence of hybrids are crucial data that can assist zoo curators in captive colony management and decision-making on relocation for reproduction. This study employed molecular markers to study a large colony (n = 56) of African Penguin hosted in an Italian biopark. A panel of 15 STRs (single tandem repeats) was selected, and genotype data were analyzed using COLONY software to determine parentage relationships and compare the existing studbook information to a pedigree built from genetic analyses. The existence of extra-pair mating and the presence of hybrids were investigated: discrepancies in kinship relationships emerged following molecular parentage analysis and 10 unknown genetic relationships were revealed. Infidelity of one member of the pair was observed in 6 cases and extra-pair copulation was assessed by genetic analysis in 2 episodes. One member of the colony was found to be a hybrid (S. Demersus × S. Humboldti); his progeny, derived by extra-pair copulation, was traced. Three other hidden hybrids were discovered and assessed using the identified candidate private alleles. Overall, our results demonstrate that molecular methods to confirm parentage and analyze relatedness among colony members are a valuable tool to complement studbook-based genetic management of African penguin captive populations. Because a variety of behavioral dynamics (e.g., extra-pair mating) can make observations ineffective in some species and because molecular markers outperform studbook in identifying the presence of hybrids, reliance on studbook information alone is not recommended.

abstract={We analyzed the concentrations of 20 trace elements in Eurydice spinigera (Isopoda) and Flaccisagitta enflata (Chaetognatha), which represent a hyperbenthic and a zooplanktonic marine species respectively, sharing the same predaceous feeding strategy, from a highly productive coastal region (Ligurian Sea, Northwestern Mediterranean). The same elements were also quantified in marine sediments, where geological anomalies were found for arsenic, chromium and nickel. Metal transfer seems to be deeply influenced by different habitats. The carnivorous isopod E. spinigera, which spends most of its lifetime on the seabed, was found to have the highest concentrations of most trace elements, such as Al, As, Cd, Ce, Cr, Fe, La, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, V and Zn, and consequently have the highest bioaccumulation factors (BAFs). Moreover, the estimation of biota sediment accumulation factors (BSAFs) revealed that cadmium, copper and zinc concentrations were higher in the isopod than in the sediment. Conversely, in the carnivorous chaetognath F. enflata, which is not a benthonic species, the highest levels of copper and tin were found. Moreover, arsenic speciation analysis confirmed the presence of inorganic As (III + V) in E. spinigera. In the context of utilizing a marine organism as a bio-indicator of metal transfer, it is crucial to consider both feeding behavior and feeding habitat. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The incidence of allergic disease is globally increasing so much that food allergy is actually considered as one of the main diseases of civilization, as well as among the major costs for healthcare worldwide. In such a scenario, the recent legislations introduced from European Union to protect consumers drastically drive the need for rapid, sensitive, and robust techniques to detect allergens within foodstuffs. We here report on an innovative immunorecognition method for β-lactoglobulin milk allergen detection, based on microcantilever resonator arrays, a promising class of biosensors. An original sandwich assay that uses the same polyclonal antibody as capture and secondary immunorecognition agent was proposed to overcome the low affinity of the simple direct method. The developed immunoassay showed better Limit Of Detection (LOD) and Limit Of Quantification (LOQ) than commercial ELISA plates, even after an aging of four months. To our knowledge, this work represents the first example in the literature of successfully immunodetection of milk allergens in low concentrations by microcantilever resonator arrays, thus opening new perspectives on alternative diagnostic tools for milk allergens screening tests. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Modelling the range of prominent vectors of pathogens is a common technique used for planning surveys, building exposure assessment estimations or addressing the impact of future climate scenarios. In most cases the recorded distribution of a target species is used together several environmental variables to capture its potential distribution, ignoring the availability of adequate hosts for the arthropod. In this study we used satellite-recorded, Fourier transformed, environmental variables of ground temperature and vegetation (NDVI) and a large dataset of records of the tick Ixodes ricinus and their hosts. The aim is to evaluate the influence of the contact rates of the ticks with the different hosts and how they impact on the raw, environmental-based distribution of the tick. These effects may alter the estimations of the distribution of the tick under future climate scenarios. This study demonstrated that the relative contribution of the hosts supporting the feeding of the tick life stages dramatically altered the expected distribution of the tick. In the study case, results support that both Passeriformes (Aves) and Rodentia-Soricomorpha contribute in different ways to the colonization of the tick along a large latitudinal gradient. However, Artiodactyla are the main supporters of the tick and enhance its presence in the fringe of its distribution area. Thus, complete data on the distribution of each host contributing to the tick's life cycle and their relative importance for the tick, should be included in the assessment of exposure by arthropods. Other results of the study suggested that more information could be obtained exploring the association of the arthropod to the variables in the environmental niche, instead of the classic approach based on a crude evaluation on the geographical space (maps). © 2018},

abstract={The diagnostic activity on wild animals implies a hard laboratory protocol where multiple disciplines, from biology to pathological anatomy until the biotechnological techniques, must be integrated to establish the causes of death. To demonstrate these concepts, the analytical approach adopted for an alpine ibex (Capra ibex) found dead in a mountain area of North Western Italy was described. The animal showed sub-costal and lymph nodes collections of green-yellow pus, fibrinous pleuropneumonia and catarrhal-hemorrhagic enteritis. Purulent process was ascribed to Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, the causative agent of caseous lymphadenitis or pseudotuberculosis, pleuropneumonia to Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica and enteritis to Mannheimia haemolytica. Parasitic bronchopneumonia in the caudal lobes of the lung, a severe enteric infestation by gastro-intestinal and pulmonary strongyles and coccidia were found. The cause of death in the studied ibex appeared to be a consequence of an association between various pathological processes, with bacteriological and parasitic etiology. © 2017, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tripoli.

abstract={Background: Bat-borne virus surveillance is necessary for determining inter-species transmission risks and is important due to the wide-range of bat species which may harbour potential pathogens. This study aimed to monitor coronaviruses (CoVs) and paramyxoviruses (PMVs) in bats roosting in northwest Italian regions. Our investigation was focused on CoVs and PMVs due to their proven ability to switch host and their zoonotic potential. Here we provide the phylogenetic characterization of the highly conserved polymerase gene fragments. Results: Family-wide PCR screenings were used to test 302 bats belonging to 19 different bat species. Thirty-eight animals from 12 locations were confirmed as PCR positive, with an overall detection rate of 12.6% [95% CI: 9.3-16.8]. CoV RNA was found in 36 bats belonging to eight species, while PMV RNA in three Pipistrellus spp. Phylogenetic characterization have been obtained for 15 alpha- CoVs, 5 beta-CoVs and three PMVs; moreover one P. pipistrellus resulted co-infected with both CoV and PMV. A divergent alpha-CoV clade from Myotis nattereri SpA is also described. The compact cluster of beta-CoVs from R. ferrumequinum roosts expands the current viral sequence database, specifically for this species in Europe. To our knowledge this is the first report of CoVs in Plecotus auritus and M. oxygnathus, and of PMVs in P. kuhlii. Conclusions: This study identified alpha and beta-CoVs in new bat species and in previously unsurveyed Italian regions. To our knowledge this represents the first and unique report of PMVs in Italy. The 23 new bat genetic sequences presented will expand the current molecular bat-borne virus databases. Considering the amount of novel bat-borne PMVs associated with the emergence of zoonotic infections in animals and humans in the last years, the definition of viral diversity within European bat species is needed. Performing surveillance studies within a specific geographic area can provide awareness of viral burden where bats roost in close proximity to spillover hosts, and form the basis for the appropriate control measures against potential threats for public health and optimal management of bats and their habitats. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={An innovative analytical strategy has been applied to identify signature peptides able to distinguish among processed animal proteins (PAPs) derived from bovine, pig, fish, and milk products. Proteomics was first used to elucidate the proteome of each source. Starting from the identified proteins and using a funnel based approach, a set of abundant and well characterized peptides with suitable physical-chemical properties (signature peptides) and specific for each source was selected. An on-target LC-ESI-MS/MS method (MRM mode) was set up using standard peptides and was then applied to selectively identify the PAP source and also to distinguish proteins from bovine carcass and milk proteins. We believe that the method described meets the request of the European Commission which has developed a strategy for gradually lifting the "total ban" toward "species to species ban", therefore requiring official methods for species-specific discrimination in feed. © 2017 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={As reported on RASFF's portal, in the first 9 months of 2016, a total of 13 “alerts/information for attention” were issued concerning the presence of Listeria monocytogenes in mould cheeses throughout Europe. This study analyzes the behaviour of L. monocytogenes in Gorgonzola cheese, a typical Italian soft blue-veined cheese, when contaminated at different time points. In the first challenge test, the pasteurized milk was contaminated and the complete cheese manufacture (cheesemaking, ripening) and shelf life was simulated. After a decrease during the first days of the cheesemaking, the pH remained constant for 35 days (5 weeks) and then it increased rapidly reaching the final values of 6.8 ± 0.02 in the core and 5.8 ± 0.4 on the rind. At the same time, the pathogen concentration decreased (about 2 log CFU/g), although during the last week a rapid pathogen growth was observed after the rise in pH values. When the cheese was stored at thermal abuse condition (8–12 °C), the pathogen concentration on the rind was 4.8 ± 0.3 log CFU/g and after 66 days (about 9 weeks) no significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) was observed; whereas, a growth from 5.4 ± 0.4 to 7.1 ± 0.5 log CFU/g was observed in the core. A second challenge test was performed using three batches of commercial slices of Gorgonzola cheese inoculated by L. monocytogenes and stored at 8 °C. The maximum specific growth rates (μ max , 1/h) of L. monocytogenes estimated ranged from 0.007 to 0.061. The square root model was used to predict the μ max at others temperature and to establish the time necessary to reach the European critical legal limit of 2 log CFU/g, in different storage scenarios. The predictions obtained in this study can be applied to any time-temperature profile, and in particular to the conditions to which the product is most likely to be subject in normal use, up to its final consumption. This study can be considered a valuable contribution also aimed at supporting the monitoring surveys carried out by officers of the Regional Veterinary Authority. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In Piedmontese cattle breed, the sporadic detection of Lipomatous Myopathy (LM) has been reported. The phenotypic disease expression consists in degeneration and infiltration of the muscular tissue characterized by replacement of myofibers with adipose tissue. The aim of this study was to investigate the existence of genetic loci associated with lipomatous myopathy in Piedmontese cattle breed through a genome wide association study based on a DNA pooling design. The samples used for the study were collected from a meat cutting plant, pairing cases and controls within farms. Samples of different muscles (diaphragm, superficial and deep pectoral, intercostal, sternocleidomastoid group and vastus lateralis) were histopathologically and enzymatically classified as cases and controls. DNA pools of cases and controls were constructed. Equal amounts of DNA were pooled from individuals for the constitution of 4 pools (2 independent biological replicates for cases and 2 for controls). Technical duplicates were also built and all pools genotyped with the Illumina BovineHD BeadChip three time each, for a total of 24 chip array positions. SNPs positions were based on the UMB 3.1 bovine assembly. The B-allele frequencies (BAF) for each array replicate were used in a specific pipeline in R software to perform multiple marker tests after excluding the 5% of SNPs showing the highest BAF variability from the replicate arrays within tail, as well as the monomorphic SNPs. A total of 41 QTLRs were identified on the 29 bovine autosomes, and 4 on the X chromosome. A subset of the identified markers fall inside or nearby genes involved in myogenesis, adipogenesis and cell to cell adhesions. The biological role of these genes in the onset of lipomatous myopathy has been identified looking at the known functions of the encoded proteins on the GeneCards database. Gene networks have been identified using STRING. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Introduction: Fish fraud detection is mainly carried out using a genomic profiling approach requiring long and complex sample preparations and assay running times. Rapid evaporative ionisation mass spectrometry (REIMS) can circumvent these issues without sacrificing a loss in the quality of results. Objectives: To demonstrate that REIMS can be used as a fast profiling technique capable of achieving accurate species identification without the need for any sample preparation. Additionally, we wanted to demonstrate that other aspects of fish fraud other than speciation are detectable using REIMS. Methods: 478 samples of five different white fish species were subjected to REIMS analysis using an electrosurgical knife. Each sample was cut 8–12 times with each one lasting 3–5 s and chemometric models were generated based on the mass range m/z 600–950 of each sample. Results: The identification of 99 validation samples provided a 98.99% correct classification in which species identification was obtained near-instantaneously (≈ 2 s) unlike any other form of food fraud analysis. Significant time comparisons between REIMS and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were observed when analysing 6 mislabelled samples demonstrating how REIMS can be used as a complimentary technique to detect fish fraud. Additionally, we have demonstrated that the catch method of fish products is capable of detection using REIMS, a concept never previously reported. Conclusions: REIMS has been proven to be an innovative technique to help aid the detection of fish fraud and has the potential to be utilised by fisheries to conduct their own quality control (QC) checks for fast accurate results. © 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract={RESULTS: The microbiota of the upper (nasal swab [NS]) and the lower (trans-tracheal aspiration [TTA]) respiratory tracts of 19 post-weaned Piedmontese calves with (8/19) and without (11/19) clinical signs of respiratory disease, coming from six different farms, was characterized by 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding. A total of 29 phyla (29 in NS, 21 in TTA) and 305 genera (289 in NS, 182 in TTA) were identified. Mycoplasma (60.8%) was the most abundant genus identified in both the NS (27.3%) and TTA (76.7%) samples, followed by Moraxella (16.6%) in the NS and Pasteurella (7.3%) in the TTA samples. Pasteurella multocida (7.3% of total operational taxonomic units [OTUs]) was the most abundant species in the TTA and Psychrobacter sanguinis (1.1% of total OTUs) in the NS samples. Statistically significant differences between the NS and the TTA samples were found for both alpha (Shannon index, observed species, Chao1 index, and Simpson index; P = 0.001) and beta (Adonis; P = 0.001) diversity. Comparison of the NS and TTA samples by farm origin and clinical signs revealed no statistical difference (P > 0.05), except for farm origin for the NS samples when compared by the unweighted UniFrac metric (P = 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we characterized the microbiota of the upper and lower respiratory tracts of calves, both healthy individuals and those with clinical signs of respiratory disease. Our results suggest that environmental factors may influence the composition of the upper airway microbiota in cattle. While the two microbial communities (upper and lower airways) differed in microbial composition, they shared several OTUs, suggesting that the lung microbiota may be a self-sustaining, more homogeneous ecosystem, influenced by the upper respiratory tract microbiota.
BACKGROUND: The microbiota of the bovine upper respiratory tract has been recently characterized, but no data for the lower respiratory tract are available. A major health problem in bovine medicine is infectious bronchopneumonia, the most common respiratory syndrome affecting cattle. With this study, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize and compare the microbial community composition of the upper and lower respiratory tracts in calves.},

abstract={During the investigations on ticks and tick-borne pathogens (TBP) range expansion in the Northern Apennines, we captured 107 Podarcis muralis lizards. Sixty-eight animals were infested by immature Ixodes ricinus, Haemaphysalis sulcata and H. punctata. Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. was detected in 3.7% of I. ricinus larvae and 8.0% of nymphs. Together with the species-specific B. lusitaniae, we identified B. garinii, B. afzelii and B. valaisiana. Rickettsia spp. (18.1% larvae, 12.0% nymphs), namely R. monacensis, R. helvetica and R. hoogstraalii, were also found in I. ricinus. R. hoogstraalii was detected in H. sulcata nymphs as well, while the two H. punctata did not harbour any bacteria. One out of 16 lizard tail tissues was positive to R. helvetica. Our results support the hypothesis that lizards are involved in the epidemiological cycles of TBP. The heterogeneity of B. burgdorferi genospecies mirrors previous findings in questing ticks in the area, and their finding in attached I. ricinus larvae suggests that lizards may contribute to the maintenance of different genospecies. The rickettsiae are new findings in the study area, and R. helvetica infection in a tail tissue indicates a systemic infection. R. hoogstraalii is reported for the first time in I. ricinus ticks. Lizards seem to favour the bacterial exchange among different tick species, with possible public health consequences. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Decision-makers and risk managers are often called upon to prioritise on and recommend suitable measures to prevent the risk of introduction and spread of pathogens. The main objective of this study was to assess the perceptions of experts in Italy, Switzerland and the United Kingdom concerning the importance, effectiveness, feasibility, costs and acceptability of selected biosecurity measures to prevent the introduction and limit the spread of rabies, blue tongue (BT) and classical swine fever (CSF). After identifying the most relevant measures by the project team, an expert knowledge elicitation was implemented through a questionnaire. After preliminary descriptive analyses, a number of statistical calculations were performed such as weighted medians, Spearman rank correlation tests, Wilcoxon comparison tests and ranking of measures. Three experts from each country completed the questionnaires, one expert for each disease. The mean answer rates for CSF, BT and rabies were 73%, 100% and 99% respectively. “Tracing system for live animal trade” was highlighted as very relevant in all diseases. The implementation of a “restriction zone after a suspicion or confirmation” was also rated as a relevant measure, especially for CSF. We identified generally a small correlation between costs and the other criteria. Among the rabies experts, measures related to “zoonotic risk” were rated highly, supporting the idea of a One Health approach. Disagreement among experts concerned 43 measures for the three pathogens: the debated measures were “control of the wildlife CSF status”, “arthropod-vector control” and “rabies vaccination for domestic animals”. Facing budget restriction, decision-makers need to prioritise their actions and make efficient prevention choices. With this study, we aimed to provide elements for reflection and to inform priority setting. The results can be applied through the implementation of similar surveys or directly from the knowledge already gathered in this study. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this study, arsenic content in 200 cat- and dog-food samples was estimated by means of electro thermal atomic absorption (Z-ETA-AAS), after using the wet digestion method, that were imported or commercialised in Italy from 2007 to 2012. The maximum value of total arsenic (As) in the samples was 12.5 mg kg-1. Some imported pet food was intercepted as a result of the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) and rejected at the border or withdrawn from the Italian market, because they exceeded the maximum level of arsenic content imposed in Italy at the time of this study (2002/32/EC). All the samples with a significant arsenic level were fish-based. Recently, the 2013/1275/EC raised the maximum level of As permitted in fish-based pet food. However, the analysis of As species is required (EFSA 2014) in order to identify correctly the different contributions of dietary exposure to inorganic As and to assure pet food quality. © 2017, Istituto Zooprofilattico dell'Abruzzo e del Molise.

abstract={Natural corticosteroids include two families of substances: mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. Several drugs of similar structure and biological activity have been synthesized and are currently used in the clinical practice. Beside legal pharmacological treatments, these drugs have been consistently misused in animal breeding. One of the most abused corticosteroids is prednisolone. For many years, prednisolone has been considered of exclusive synthetic origin, but nowadays a debate about its possible endogenous production is under way. Several studies have been addressed to ascertain the potential relationship between stressful conditions, such as transportation and slaughtering, and endogenous production of prednisolone. In order to verify further the effect of stressful conditions, our laboratory analysed urine samples collected from the cows participating to the “Batailles des Reines” (a traditional contest based on ritual and spontaneous fights of pregnant cows), to verify if an endogenous prednisolone production may occur in these animals. We developed and validated a LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous determination of cortisol, cortisone, prednisolone and five of its metabolites. The method was applied to the analysis of urine samples collected from “Batailles des Reines” competitions in 2012 and 2013. All these samples had been previously analysed within an anti-doping control program and tested compliant to all screenings. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={An increase in autochthonous hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections has been recorded in Italy suspected to be zoonotically transmitted from pigs; this study was carried out to determinate the seroprevalence and risk factors associated with hepatitis HEV exposition, both in swine and humans working in pig farms, located within a high-density pig farming area in Piedmont region, north-western Italy. The presence of viral RNA in human and swine samples was also evaluated, and phylogenetic analysis was performed on HEV-positive samples. Forty-two swine farms were sampled; 142 workers were enrolled in the study and classified into two groups: (i) 69 workers with occupational contact with swine (including veterinarians and farmers) recruited in the 42 sampled farms; (ii) 73 without occupational contact with swine. Forty-one of 42 (97%) swine farms resulted positive to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test for HEV antibodies (Abs). Overall seroprevalence in swine was 50% (441/879), with seropositivity rate higher in sows (333/469, 71%). HEV RNA in stool samples was detected in animals from 13 of 42 tested farms (31%), and a higher positivity resulted in weaners (40/246, 16.3%). Phylogenetic analysis classified all HEV isolates within genotype 3 (subtypes 3f, 3e, 3c). All humans were negative for HEV viral genome in blood. Five of 142 sera were positive for IgG anti-HEV with an overall prevalence of 3.52% with no statistically significant differences in prevalence rates between workers at zoonotic risk and the control group (5.7% versus 1.3%). In contrast, a significant difference (OR 10.1) was observed within the subgroup including subjects exposed for short periods (veterinarians) compared with those who worked for long periods (farmers) suggesting a correlation between the time of exposure and the likelihood of HEV infection. Reporting HEV infection is not mandatory in Italy, but a constant epidemiological surveillance should be ensured to clarify the epidemiology of this disease. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Between 2007 and 2014, 83 cetaceans were found stranded along the Ligurian coast of Italy, in the Pelagos Sanctuary, the largest marine protected area in the Mediterranean basin. Forty-nine (59%) were submitted to complete or partial necropsy, depending on the conservation status of the carcass. Based on gross and histological pathology and ancillary testing, the cause of death was determined and categorized as anthropogenic or natural (i.e., nonanthropogenic) in origin for 33 animals (67%) and of undetermined origin in the remaining 16 (33%). Natural causes of death, accompanied by either poor or good nutritional status, were attributed to 29 animals (59%), whereas four (8%) were diagnosed with an anthropogenic cause of death, consisting of interaction with fishing activities. Infectious and noninfectious disease was the most common cause of death, involving 29 cetaceans (59%). These data are valuable for understanding health and mortality trends in cetacean populations and can provide information for establishing policies for cetacean conservation and management in such an important protected area of the Mediterranean basin. © Wildlife Disease Association 2017.},

abstract={West Nile virus (WNV) is endemic in the Po valley area, Northern Italy, and within the legal framework of the national plan for the surveillance of human vector-borne diseases, WNV surveillance has over time been implemented. The surveillance plans are based on the transdisciplinary and trans-sectorial collaboration between regional institutions involved in public, animal, and environmental health. This integrated surveillance targets mosquitoes, wild birds, humans, and horses and aims at early detecting the viral circulation and reducing the risk of infection in the human populations. The objective of our study was to assess the degree of One Health (OH) implementation (OH-ness) of the WNV surveillance system in three North Italian regions (Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy, Piedmont) in 2016, following the evaluation protocol developed by the Network for Evaluation of One Health (NEOH). In detail, we (i) described the OH initiative (drivers, outcomes) and its system (boundaries, aim, dimensions, actors, stakeholders) and (ii) scored different aspects of this initiative (i.e., OH-thinking, -planning, -sharing, -learning, transdisciplinarity and leadership), with values from 0 (=no OH approach) to 1 (=perfect OH approach). We obtained a mean score for each aspect evaluated. We reached high scores for OH thinking (0.90) and OH planning (0.89). Lower scores were attributed to OH sharing (0.83), transdisciplinarity and leadership (0.77), and OH learning (0.67), highlighting some critical issues related to communication and learning gaps. The strengths and weaknesses detected by the described quantitative evaluation will be investigated in detail by a qualitative evaluation (process evaluation), aiming to provide a basis for the development of shared recommendations to refine the initiative and conduct it in a more OH-oriented perspective. © 2017 Paternoster, Tomassone, Tamba, Chiari, Lavazza, Piazzi, Favretto, Balduzzi, Pautasso and Vogler.},

abstract={Morbillivirus genus comprises several members related to specific hosts, such as canine distemper virus (CDV) and cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV) in which the dolphin morbillivirus (DMV) is included. Both CDV and DMV are able to cause serious outbreak associated with high morbidity and mortality representing an important conservation threat for terrestrial and aquatic mammalian species. This paper describes a new RT-PCR RFLP technique based on a RT-PCR with degenerate primers targeting a 287 bp fragment located on the conserved N terminus of the morbillivirus NP gene, followed by MseI RFLP, in order both to confirm the detection of the virus and to distinguish DMV from CDV. Both carnivores and cetaceans tissues (brain, lung and lymph node) presenting evidence of morbillivirus infection (MI) were analyzed. RT-PCR positive samples were typed by RFLP analysis and then sequenced to confirm the RFLP results. This method was applied during the last morbillivirus cetacean die-off occurred in the Mediterranean basin in 2013, when there was the urgent need of a rapid and economic method to investigate among causes of death on stranded cetaceans. This new technique has proved to be a valuable, reliable, simple and relatively inexpensive diagnostic tool easily applicable also in limited-resource laboratories. © 2017},

abstract={Infections with Ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) microvariants in young Pacific oysters are associated with massive mortality events and significant economic losses. Previous studies, focusing on few regions of the genome, have revealed the genomic diversity of these genotypes with respect to the reference type. We used a NGS process to sequence the whole genome of the OsHV-1 µVar in infected individuals, collected during mortality events in France and Ireland. The final genome length of OsHV-1 µVar was approximately 205 kbp, shorter than the reference genotype and the overall genome organisation resembled herpes simplex viruses. 94.4% similarity was observed with the OsHV-1 reference genotype. Large indels, including five deletions and three insertions were found to induce the loss and the addition of several ORFs, summed with codon substitutions in 64% of genes shared with the reference type. This diversity raises the question of the exact origin and evolution of OsHV-1 µVar. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Invasive alien species (IAS) are a significant and growing problem worldwide. In Europe, some aspects of IAS have been addressed through existing legal instruments, but these are far from sufficient to tackle the problem comprehensively. The FINS II Conference considered the relevance of Top 20 IAS issues (Top 10 threats and opportunities) for Europe determined at the 1st Freshwater Invasiveness – Networking for Strategy (FINS I) conference held in Ireland in 2013. Using a similar format of sequential group voting, threats from FINS I (lack of funding, of awareness and education; poor communication) and several new threats (lack of lead agencies, of standardized management and of common approach; insufficient monitoring and management on private property) were identified by 80 academics, applied scientists, policy makers and stakeholders from 14 EU and three non-EU countries (including 10 invited speakers) during four workshop break-out sessions (legislation remit in both EU/non-EU countries; best management and biosecurity practice for control; data management and early warning; pathways of introductions and citizen science). Identified opportunities include improved cooperation and communication, education and leadership to enhance public awareness and stakeholder participation, systems establishment for early detection, rapid response, monitoring and management of IAS using standardised methods of data collection, storage and usage. The sets of threats and opportunities identified underline the importance of international cooperation on IAS issues in communication, education and funding as priorities, as well as in standardization of legislation, control methods and best practise of research. © 2017 The Author(s) and 2017 REABIC.},

abstract={The existing European Regulation (EC n° 51/2013) prohibits the use of animals meals in feedstuffs in order to prevent Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy infection and diffusion, however the legislation is rapidly moving towards a partial lifting of the “feed ban” and the competent control organisms are urged to develop suitable analytical methods able to avoid food safety incidents related to animal origin products. The limitations of the official methods (i.e. light microscopy and Polymerase Chain Reaction) suggest exploring new analytic ways to get reliable results in a short time. The combination of spectroscopic techniques with optical microscopy allows the development of an individual particle method able to meet both selectivity and sensitivity requirements (0.1% w/w). A spectroscopic method based on Fourier Transform micro-Raman spectroscopy coupled with Discriminant Analysis is here presented. This approach could be very useful for in-situ applications, such as customs inspections, since it drastically reduces time and costs of analysis. © 2017},

abstract={Valorisation of former foodstuff products (FFP) in feed is part of a long-term strategy for sustainability. An approach to valorise FFP outside the waste value chain is their use as an alternative source of feed materials, with a subsequent optimisation of the environmental impact of products. In the current practice of food production, food packaging is provided to ensure the maintenance of food quality and safety during transport and storage. One of the problems of reusing FFP is how to deal with packaging materials or remains that can become residues in the feed. The aim of this study is to propose a fast and sensitive gravimetric method, fit for routine official controls, for the determination of packaging residues in feed. The developed method can briefly be summarised as: (1) visual selection of the undesired ingredients which can be identified as remnants of packaging materials; (2) weighing of the selected materials; (3) defatting; (4) dehydration; (5) final weighing; and (6) reporting of weight and percentage. Moreover, the method has been validated through the determination of some of the parameters listed in Council Regulation 2004/882/EC (i.e., specificity, limit of quantification (LOQ), recovery, repeatability, within-laboratory reproducibility and measurement uncertainty). © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Ex-food or former food products (FFPs) have been proposed as one of the categories with great promise as alternative feed ingredients. FFPs’ nutritional potential is not yet fully exploited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform a nutritional evaluation of selected FFPs. In particular, six samples of mixed FFPs, all based on bakery products, were analysed for moisture, crude protein, ether extract, crude fibre, neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre, starch and ash. Nitrogen-free extractives and non-structural carbohydrate were also determined. Based on FFPs’ composition data, estimation of digestible energy and metabolisable energy values for pigs were calculated. Further, the in vitro digestibility values of FFPs were investigated using a multi-step enzymatic technique. A wheat sample was included as a control feed ingredient in the study. All data were reported on dry matter basis. FFPs have shown a nutrient composition comparable with cereal grains. In the tested FFPs, the average protein content was 10.0% and the average starch content was 52.4%. Nitrogen-free extractive ranged from 61.2% to 74.7%, whereas non-structural carbohydrate ranged from 58.5% to 79.3%. Compared with wheat, FFPs were characterised by a relative high fat content, averaging about 10.1%. The relatively high nitrogen-free extractive/non-structural carbohydrate/starch and fat concentration designated FFPs as valuable energy sources. Digestible energy and metabolisable energy averages were 17.2 and 16.9 MJ kg–1, respectively. The average in vitro digestibility value of FFPs samples was 88.2% ± 5.8%, comparable with that of wheat (90.6% ± 1.6%). FFPs are a fat-fortified version of common cereals grains. The high energy content and digestibility values elect FFPs as promising non-traditional ingredients for swine. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of light microscopy with differential staining techniques for the discrimination of insect material from marine arthropods–classified as fishmeal. Specifically, three samples of single-species insect material, Hermetia illucens (HI), Bombyx mori (BM) and Tenebrio molitor (TM), and two samples of marine arthropods, shrimp material and krill, were analysed and compared after staining by two reagents to enhance fragment identification. Alizarin Red (AR) and Chlorazol Black (CB), which react respectively with calcium salts and chitin, were tested for their potential efficacy in distinguishing between insect and marine materials. Results indicated that AR failed to stain HI, BM and TM materials. By contrast, the three insect species materials tested were stained by CB. When shrimp fragments and krill were considered, AR and CB stained marine materials reddish-pink and light blue to black, respectively. By combining these results, it can be suggested that CB staining may efficiently be used to mark insect materials; AR does stain shrimp fragments but does not stain the tested insect material, indicating a possible approach for discriminating between insects and marine arthropods. However, since the present study was performed on pure materials and a small set of samples, possible implementation of this technique still needs to be confirmed in complex matrices such as compound feed. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Such methods must be validated if their results are to be used as acceptable evidence in a court of law. Following the validation guidelines of the Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods (SWGDAM), we carried out a validation process for the Low Cost and Density (LCD) Array (MEAT 5.0 version) kit for food forensics based on a DNA biochip technology that simultaneously detects 24 animal species. Mixtures of the animal species the kit is designed to detect were prepared at different concentrations and tested on raw/pasteurized, and heated meat and milk matrices. The LCD Array showed high specificity and high sensitivity and it appeared to be robust and repeatable. As such, it provides a useful tool for detecting common adulterants in food items of animal origin. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Glucocorticoids, used in a wide range of pathologies thank to their therapeutical properties, are also illegally used as growth-promoters in animal breeding even if the European Union regulates their use to protect consumers' health from the adverse effects of residues in food. The first aim of the study was to establish the applicability of two histological parameters – atrophy and cortex-medulla ratio - to detect glucocorticoids misuse in calves. The second aim was to concurrently test the potentiality of both parameters to discriminate between treated and untreated animals. One hundred and seventy-two male Friesian veal calves were raised for six months and divided into two groups: Group A (106 calves) was given dexamethasone per os for twenty days (0.4 mg/day), Group B (66 calves) used as control. Thymic samples were microscopically examined. Fat infiltration was evaluated and a degree of atrophy, ranging from 1 to 3 (mild, moderate, severe) was attributed; thymic cortex-medulla ratio was calculated too. Fisher's exact test and a Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test were performed to investigate the differences in thymic atrophy and cortex-medulla ratio between the groups. Results demonstrate that the thymic atrophy grading was significantly increased in group A (p = 0,006), whereas the cortex-medulla ratio was decreased (p < 0,004) when compared to group B; moreover, the parallel testing with fixed degree of atrophy and cortex-medulla ratio cut-off thresholds optimize the sensitivity (90%) in the detection of glucocorticoids anabolic treatments. These data suggest that microscopic thymus analysis represent a valid tool for the screening and monitoring of glucocorticoid illicit treatments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Gut is often a receptacle for many different pathogens in feed and/or the environment, such as Salmonella spp. The current knowledge about pathogenicity of Salmonella is restricted to few serotypes, whereas other important ones like S. Coeln, S. Thompson, S. Veneziana, have not been investigated yet in human and animal models. Therefore, the aim of our work was to verify the ability of widespread environmental Salmonella strains to penetrate and modulate innate immunity in pig intestinal IPEC-J2 cells. Our results outline the different ability of Salmonella strains to modulate innate immunity; the expression of the IFN-β gene was increased by S. Typhimurium, S. Ablogame and S. Diarizonae 2, that also caused an inflammatory response in terms of Interleukin (IL)-1β and/or IL-8 gene espression. In particular, IL-8 gene expression and protein release were significantly modulated by 5 Salmonella strains out of 7. Interestingly, S. Typhimurium, S. Coeln and S. Thompson strains, characterized by a peculiar ability to penetrate into IPEC-J2 cells, up-regulated both IL-8 and TNF-α gene expression. Accordingly, blocking IL-8 was shown to decrease the penetration of S. Typhimurium. On the contrary, S. Diarizonae strain 1, showing lesser invasion of IPEC-J2 cells, down-regulated the p38-MAPK pathway, and it did not induce an inflammatory response. Our results confirm that IPEC-J2 cells are a useful model to evaluate host-gut pathogen interaction and indicate IL-8 and TNF-α as possible predictive markers of invasiveness of Salmonella strains in enterocytes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The occurrence of pesticides intended for non-agricultural use was investigated in 206 dust samples drawn from vacuum-cleaner bags from residential flats in Italy. The multi-residue analysis targeted on 95 different active principles was performed with UPLC-MS/MS, with a Limit of Quantification (LOQ) of 0.008 mg/g dry weight. The results indicated the presence of imidacloprid (IMI) and carbendazim (CARB) in 30% and 26% of the samples, with a mean and P95 concentration between 1.6 and 39 and between 0.08 and 4.9 mg/g, respectively. Combined presence of two biocides was noted in 19.4% samples, of three biocides in 9.2% samples, of four biocides in 3.4% samples, and of five and six biocides in 0.5% and 1% samples, respectively. According to the estimated dust intake in infants/toddlers aged 6-24 months (16-100 mg d-1) and cats (200 mg d-1), it was possible to obtain risk characterization with respect to the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for IMI of 0.060 mg/kg body weight (bw) proposed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the chronic Population Adjusted Dose (cPAD) of 0.019 mg/kg bw d-1 by US-EPA. Under the worst-case scenario, the presence of IMI in dust indicates potential exceedance of the cPAD in kittens, to be considered as sentinel also accounting for combined exposure. This study highlights the relevance of consumer empowerment about the responsible use of pesticides as biocidal products in indoor environment. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Human exposure to contaminated food is a general health concern worldwide; it is necessary to evaluate food safety with respect to contaminants present in the edible parts of major food crops. This study evaluated the concentrations of 17 trace elements (As, Be, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Sn, Tl, V, and Zn) from 51 potato plantations in the Campania region, inside the area known as the "Triangle of Death," with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis. Results confirm that the potatoes collected from the suburban area of Naples contained concentrations of trace elements below the safe limits prescribed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Health Organization. The concentrations of elements were similar to those reported for potatoes grown in other countries. Monitoring the content of toxic and potentially toxic elements is one of the most important aspects of food quality assurance. The environmental persistence of metals may result in the accumulation of significant levels of these contaminants in plants. They are absorbed to different extents, depending on their source, soil and climatic factors, plant genotype, and agrotechnical conditions, thereby entering the food chain and representing a risk to human health.

abstract={The presence of lysine (K) at codon 222 has been associated with resistance to classical scrapie in goats, but few scrapie cases have been identified in 222Q/K animals. To investigate the contribution of the 222K variant to PrPres formation in natural and experimental Q/K scrapie cases, we applied an immunoblotting method based on the use of two different monoclonal antibodies, F99/97.6.1 and SAF84, chosen for their different affinities to 222K and 222Q PrP variants. Our finding that PrPres seems to be formed nearly totally by the 222Q variant provides evidence that the 222K PrP variant confers resistance to conversion to PrP res formation and reinforces the view that this mutation has a protective role against classical scrapie in goats. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={On August 28, 2015, a staphylococcal food poisoning outbreak occurred in Umbria, Italy, affecting 24 of the 42 customers who had dinner at a local restaurant. About 3 h after ingesting a variety of foods, the customers manifested gastrointestinal symptoms. Within 24 h of notification from the hospital emergency department, Sanitary Inspectors of the local Public Health Unit performed an epidemiological investigation. A retrospective cohort study was conducted among the customers. Food and environmental samples were collected. Due to the rapid onset of symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea), the food samples were analyzed for the presence of toxigenic bacteria and their toxins; nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from the waiters and cooks. Among the food tested, high levels of coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS) (3.4 × 108 CFU/g) and staphylococcal enterotoxins (2.12 ng SEA/g) were only detected in the Chantilly cream dessert. CPS were also detected on the surface of a kitchen table (10 CFU/swab), and five food handlers were positive for Staphylococcus aureus. In total, five enterotoxigenic S. aureus isolates were recovered from three food handlers, a kitchen surface, and the Chantilly cream dessert. These isolates were further characterized by biotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and multiplex polymerase chain reaction assays for the detection of eleven enterotoxin encoding genes (sea, seb, sec, sed, see, seg, seh, sei, sej, sep, and ser) and three genes involved in antibiotic resistance (mecA, mecC, and mupA). Three sea-positive strains, isolated from the dessert, environment, and one of the cooks, had the same pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profile and belonged to the human biotype, suggesting that the contamination causing the outbreak most likely originated from a food handler. Moreover, improper storage of the dessert, at room temperature for about 5 h, permitted microbial growth and SEA production. This study underlines the importance of both laboratory evidence and epidemiological data for outbreak investigation. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.},

abstract={Buccal swabbing is a minimally invasive method to obtain DNA and biological material from humans and animals, including fish. Reports on buccal swabbing in fish are few and only for a limited number of species. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is an important animal model and because the yield of DNA may vary among and within different species in individuals of different sizes, it was selected as useful to optimize the buccal DNA collection in this species. Different storage methods were evaluated, aimed at DNA preservation by limiting DNA degradation and bacterial growth, using commonly available and inexpensive reagents. DNA quality was also tested by amplification of a single-copy nuclear gene and a mitochondrial gene. The results suggest that ethanol is the best storage choice for buccal swab sampling in fish genetic studies, as well as suitable for small-bodied rainbow trout. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Photobacterium damselae subsp. damselae (Pdd) is considered to be an emerging pathogen of marine fish and has also been implicated in cases of histamine food poisoning. In this study, eight strains isolated from mullets of the genera Mugil and Liza captured in the Ligurian Sea were characterized, and a method to detect histamine-producing Pdd from fish samples was developed. The histamine-producing potential of the strains was evaluated in culture media (TSB+) using a histamine biosensor. Subsequently, two strains were used to contaminate mackerel fillets (4 or 40 CFU/g), simulating a cross-contamination on the selling fish stalls. Sample homogenates were enriched in TSB+. The cultures were then inoculated on thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose agar (TCBS) and the dark green colonies were cultured on Niven agar. The violet isolates were characterized using specific biochemical and PCR based tests. All Pdd strains were histamine producers, yielding concentration varying from 167 and 8977 μg/mL in TSB+ cultures incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. Pdd colonies were detected from the inoculated mackerel samples and their histidine decarboxylase gene was amplified using species-specific primer pairs designed for this study. The results indicate that mullets can be source of Pdd and the fish retailers needs to evaluate the risk posed by cross-contamination on the selling fish stalls. © 2017 by the authors.},

abstract={Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of clinical infections in humans and its enterotoxins cause foodborne disease. In the present study, we tested a total of 51 isolates of S. aureus from small-ruminant dairy farms with artisan dairy facilities, all located in Latium, Italy. The farms have a known history of a high prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Most of the MRSA isolates (27 of 51) belonged to spa-type t127 (43.1%), followed by t2678 (3.9%), t044 (2%), t1166 (2%), and t1773 (2%). PFGE performed on mecA positive strains identified one cluster (≥ 80% of similarity), comprising 22 MRSA. Nine of twenty-two MRSA isolates were assigned human host origin, and 13 isolates did not belong to a specific host. During the characterization study, one strain isolated from bulk tank milk samples harbored the pvl gene; the strain was not enterotoxigenic with a non-specific host according to the biotyping scheme, highlighting the possible emerging risk of transmission of bacterial virulence factors by foods, the environment, and foodhandlers. These findings stress the importance of hygienic measures at all processing steps of the food production chain and underline that monitoring for the presence of MRSA throughout the food chain is essential for public health. © 2017 by the authors.

abstract={Introduction: Mosquito-borne diseases (MBDs) are spreading worldwide due to globalization and climate change, representing a threat for both humans and animals. Of great concern are the infections caused by viruses belonging to the Flavivirus genus as West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV) transmitted by Culex sp. or Dengue virus and Zika virus (ZIKV), transmitted by Aedes sp. This work describes the surveillance protocol enforced in Piedmont (Northwestern Italy) to control MBDs spread, focusing on the activities performed on mosquitoes during the 2015 vector season. Materials and Methods: From July to October, mosquitoes were fortnightly sampled in 50 selected sites according to risk factors with CDC dry ice-baited traps and BG-Sentinel traps baited with BG-Lure and dry ice. Adults were counted, identified to species level, pooled, and screened for flaviviruses using different reverse transcription-PCR protocols and sequencing. Finally, phylogenetic analysis was performed on a dataset including 2014 and 2015 WNV sequences and reference sequences retrieved from GenBank. Results and Discussion: A total of 17,000 mosquitoes, grouped in 730 pools, were tested. Five pools of Culex pipiens were positive for WNV Lineage 2 in Novara, Alessandria, Vercelli, and Torino Provinces. One pool of C. pipiens and one pool of Anopheles maculipennis s.l. were positive for USUV in Vercelli and Alessandria Provinces. In Vercelli Province one pool of C. pipiens resulted positive both for WNV and USUV. Control measures were quickly implemented. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the WNV Lin 2 sequences from Piedmont region cluster with those circulating in Northeastern Italy in the previous years. Given the positive trend in WNV activity compared to 2014 and the emergence caused by other flavivirus as ZIKV, the level of attention for the 2016 vector season may be increased and this surveillance protocol could represent an important tool for public health authorities. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.},

abstract={The current circulating swine influenza virus (IV) subtypes in Europe (H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2) are associated with clinical outbreaks of disease. However, we showed that pigs could be susceptible to other IV strains that are able to cross the species barrier. In this work, we extended our investigations into whether different IV strains able to cross the species barrier might give rise to different innate immune responses that could be associated with pathological lesions. For this purpose, we used the same samples collected in a previous study of ours, in which healthy pigs had been infected with a H3N2 Swine IV and four different H3N8 IV strains circulating in different animal species. Pigs had been clinically inspected and four subjects/group were sacrificed at 3, 6, and 21 days post infection. In the present study, all groups but mock exhibited antibody responses to IV nucleoprotein protein. Pulmonary lesions and high-titered viral replication were observed in pigs infected with the swine-adapted virus. Interestingly, pigs infected with avian and seal H3N8 strains also showed moderate lesions and viral replication, whereas equine and canine IVs did not cause overt pathological signs, and replication was barely detectable. Swine IV infection induced interferon (IFN)-alpha and interleukin-6 responses in bronchoalveolar fluids (BALF) at day 3 post infection, as opposed to the other non-swine-adapted virus strains. However, IFN-alpha responses to the swine-adapted virus were not associated with an increase of the local, constitutive expression of IFN-alpha genes. Remarkably, the Equine strain gave rise to a Serum Amyloid A response in BALF despite little if any replication. Each virus strain could be associated with expression of cytokine genes and/or proteins after infection. These responses were observed well beyond the period of virus replication, suggesting a prolonged homeostatic imbalance of the innate immune system. © 2017 Montoya, Foni, Solórzano, Razzuoli, Baratelli, Bilato, Córdoba, del Burgo, Martinez, Martinez-Orellana, Chiapponi, Perlin, del Real and Amadori.},

abstract={The applicability to the determination of mercury in tuna of square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SW-ASV) conducted at both solid gold electrode (SGE) and a gold nanoparticle-modified glassy carbon electrode (AuNPs-GCE) was demonstrated. Mercury content in two certified materials and in ten samples of canned tuna was measured. The performances of the electrodes were compared with one another as well as with two spectroscopic techniques, namely cold vapour atomic absorption spectroscopy (CV-AAS) and a direct mercury analyser (DMA). The results found pointed out that both SW-ASV approaches were suitable and easy-to-use method to monitor mercury concentration in tunas, since they allowed accurate quantification at concentration values lower than the maximum admissible level in this matrix ([Hg] = 1 mg/kgwet weight,ww). In particular, mercury detection at the AuNPs-GCE showed a LOQ in fish-matrix of 0.1 μg/l, corresponding to 0.06 mg/kgww, with performance comparable to that of DMA. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Sudan dyes are synthetic azo dyes used by industry in a variety of applications. Classified as carcinogenic, they are not allowed in foodstuffs; however, their presence as adulterants in food products has been regularly reported. Here, we describe an innovative screening method to detect Sudan I, II, III, and IV in tomato sauce, palm oil, and chilli powder. The method entails minimal sample preparation, completely avoiding the liquid chromatography phase, followed by detection and identification through atmospheric pressure chemical ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, in positive ionization mode. Analytes were efficiently identified and detected in samples, fortified both with individual analytes and with their mixture, with an error in mass identification less than 5 ppm. Limits of identification of the analytes in the fortified samples were 0.5 to 1 mg/kg, depending on the dye and matrix. The method had a linear range of 0.05 to 5 mg/kg and good linear relationships (R2 . 0.98). Repeatability was satisfactory, with a coefficient of variation lower than 20%. The method was applied to detect the dyes in real adulterated chilli samples, previously found positive by confirmatory high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and ELISA, and in commercial products purchased from supermarkets. In all positive samples, analytes were correctly identified with an error in mass identification lower than 5 ppm, while none of the 45 commercial samples analyzed were found to be contaminated. The proposed new assay is sensitive, with a limit of identification, for all the three matrices, complying with the limits defined by the European Union (0.5 to 1 mg/kg) for analytical methods. Compared with conventional methods, the new assay is rapid and inexpensive and characterized by a high throughput; thus, it could be suitable as screening technique to identify Sudan dyes in adulterated food products.

abstract={Listeria monocytogenes causes invasive syndromes with high fatality rates in specific population groups. Cheeses have been commonly implicated in outbreaks worldwide. Gorgonzola is a cheese only produced in Northwestern Italy (it is the third Italian cheese in terms of production and export) and L. monocytogenes is frequently isolated from the production chain. The aims of this study were to assess the distribution of L. monocytogenes Virulence Types (VTs) in isolates collected in Gorgonzola processing plants and to determine the presence of Epidemic Clones (ECs). Fifty-Six L. monocytogenes strains collected between 2004 and 2016 from cheese and environmental samples were subtyped with Multi-Virulence-Locus Sequence Typing (MVLST) and compared to previously typed strains. Most isolates (n = 50) belonged to two new VTs (VT113 and VT114). The remaining isolates belonged to previously identified VTs: VT14-ECVIII (milk chocolate outbreak, 1994, USA) and VT80 (ricotta salata outbreak, 2012, USA). VT14, VT80 and VT113 were shared with isolates from apparently sporadic human cases in the same geographical area and temporal period (Piedmont and Lombardy, 2005–2016). The overall L. monocytogenes population appears to be homogeneous and may be characteristic of Gorgonzola production. Nevertheless, the detection in cheese and environmental samples of VTs observed in clinical isolates or outbreak related strains (VT80, VT14) contributed to better describe the current scenario and pointed out the need for increased surveillance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Copepods are the most numerous taxonomic group in marine mesozooplankton communities. These planktonic organisms have an essential role in the function of marine trophic webs, as they are the link between phytoplankton and secondary consumers. The concentrations of 20 essential and non-essential trace elements were investigated by Inductively Coupled Plasma – Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) in calanoid copepods with different feeding behaviors. The sampling was performed in the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea, at the border between the Northern Tyrrhenian Sea and the Ligurian Sea (Italy). Aluminum, iron, zinc and copper were present in the highest concentrations in herbivorous calanoids (Temora stylifera, Nannocalanus minor, Neocalanus gracilis). Conversely, the nonessential element – arsenic – and the essential elements selenium and molybdenum – were present in the highest levels in carnivores (Pontella mediterranea, Candacia ethiopica). In the omnivorous copepod Centropages typicus, metal concentrations were found at an intermediate level between herbivores and carnivores, reflecting the importance of dietary pathways in metal intake and bioaccumulation. Finally, the bioaccumulation factors (BAFs), expressed as a ratio of the total metal levels in copepods compared to the seawater metal levels, were as follows: herbivores (83699) > omnivores (47855) > carnivores (41648). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

Enhanced human epidemiological and microbiological surveillance together with microbiological monitoring of HAV in food and trace-back investigation were conducted. Results. A total of 1803 HAV cases were identified from 1 January 2013 to 31 August 2014, in Italy. Sequencing was possible for 368 cases (20.4 %), mostly collected between 1 January 2013 and 28 February 2014, and 246 cases (66.8 %) harboured an HAV outbreak strain. Imported frozen berries contaminated with HAV were identified as the vehicle of the outbreak which also involved many other European countries in 2013 and 2014. Epidemiological evidence obtained through a case-control study was supported by the finding of a 100% nucleotide similarity of the VP1/2A sequences of HAVs detected in human and food samples. Trace-back investigation revealed an extremely complex supplying network with no possibility for a point source potentially explaining the vast contamination of berries found in Italy. Conclusion. The investigation benefited from an excellent collaboration among different sectors who shared proactively the available information. Our findings highlight the importance of considering frozen berries among the highest risk factors for HAV. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR) occurs worldwide, requiring significant resources for eradication programs or surveillance purposes. The status of infection is usually detected by serological methods using the virus neutralization test (VNT) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on individual sera. The gE DIVA (Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals) vaccines approach, adopted in order to reduce the virus circulation and prevent clinical signs, have tightened the range of available methods for the serological diagnosis. Different gE blocking ELISA could be performed to detect specific antibodies in sera of infected or whole virus-vaccinated animals but with less sensitivity if applied to bulk milk samples, especially in marker-vaccinated herds. A new rec-gE ELISA was recently developed in Italy and applied with good performances on blood serum samples. The present paper focuses on the application of a rapid protocol for purification/concentration of immunoglobulin G (IgG) from bulk milk and on the use of the new rec-gE indirect ELISA. The study involved three different partners and 225 herds (12,800 lactating cows) with different official IBR diagnostic statuses. The diagnostic specificity of the method was demonstrated closed to 100% while the diagnostic sensitivity was strictly related to the herd-seroprevalence. Considering 2.5% as the limit of detection of within-herd seropositivity prevalence, the diagnostic sensitivity showed by the proposed method was equal to 100%. A single reactivation of a whole strain vaccine in an old cow was detected inside a group of 67 lactating cows, showing the field applicability of the method. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={We report the diagnostic sensitivity of 3 EU-approved rapid tests (ELISAs; 1 from IDEXX and 2 from Bio-Rad) for the detection of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy diseases in goats. Ninety-eight goat brainstem samples were tested. All the rapid tests had 100% specificity and ≥80% sensitivity, with the IDEXX test significantly more sensitive than the 2 Bio-Rad tests. All tests detected 100% of samples from goats with clinical scrapie, but missed 8% (IDEXX) to 33% (Bio-Rad SG) of samples from preclinical goats. Importantly, only IDEXX picked up all samples from clinical bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)-infected goats, whereas the other 2 rapid tests missed 15% (Bio-Rad SG) to 25% (Bio-Rad SAP). These results show that a fraction of preclinical scrapie infections are likely missed by EU surveillance, with sensitivity of detection strongly dependent on the choice of the rapid test. Moreover, a significant proportion of clinical BSE infections are underestimated by using either Bio-Rad test. Assuming that the same sensitivity on preclinical goats would also occur in BSE-infected goats, our data suggest that IDEXX is likely the most sensitive test for detecting preclinical field cases of BSE infection in goats, although with an 8% failure rate. These results raise some concerns about the reliability of current EU surveillance figures on BSE infection in goats. © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Opisthorchis felineus (family Opisthorchiidae) is a parasitic flatworm representing a serious threat to humans in some countries. Opisthorchiasis occurs after consumption of raw or undercooked cyprinid fish infected by the metacercarial stage of the parasite. Due to its small size, detection of the parasite in fish fillet is time-consuming and difficult. Furthermore, isolated metacercariae can be identified to genus but not to species level using morphological features and molecular techniques are necessary. In this work, we describe the development of primers for a diagnostic PCR amplification of a 254-bp fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase I in the mitochondrion of Opisthorchis felineus metacercariae isolated from fish fillet, together with a validation protocol for this method. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Seven hundred seventy-eight samples of packaged smoked fish (774 smoked salmon and 4 smoked swordfish) on sale in Italy, from 50 different manufacturers located in 12 European Union countries, were purchased from the Italian market between May and December 2011. The surface temperatures of the samples on sale ranged from 0 to 13°C (3.4 ± 1.5°C, mean ± SD). Six hundred eighty (87.4%) of 778 samples were stored at ≤4°C. One hundred fifty-seven samples (20.2%, 95% confidence interval 17.5 to 23.1%) were contaminated by Listeria monocytogenes, with 26 samples (3.3%, 95% confidence interval 2.3 to 4.8%) at levels &gt;100 CFU/g. The maximum level of contamination was 1.3×106 CFU/g. The differences in the level of contamination of smoked fish between countries (χ2 = 91.54, P &lt; 0.05) and manufacturers (χ2 = 193.22, P &lt; 0.05) were significant. The frequency of detection for products from different manufacturing premises ranged from 0 to 76.9%. Serotyping by serological agglutination revealed that the main serotypes detected were 1/2a (65.3%) and 1/2b (22.4%). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing with restriction enzymes AscI and ApaI yielded 36 pulsotypes from 144 isolates, clustering into 17 groups. Eight main pulsotypes accounted for 70.8% of the isolates. Three of the main pulsotypes were exclusively from products of a single manufacturer. In general, products from the same manufacturer showed genetic homogeneity, with one strongly prevalent pulsotype. Different manufacturers usually showed very different levels of contamination of the final product, confirming the importance of the management of process hygiene for controlling L. monocytogenes contamination. © 2017 International Association for Food Protection.},

abstract={Dolphin morbillivirus (DMV) has caused several mortality events in Mediterranean striped (Stenella coeruleoalba) and bottlenose (Tursiops truncatus) dolphins populations since 19; in the last 5 years, the virus was reported to infect new hosts in this basin, such as fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus), sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), and even a harbor seal (Phoca vitulina). Very recently, a calf Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris) calf stranded on the Southern Italian coastline with mild pathological findings suggestive of morbilliviral infection, received the first confirmation of DMV infection in this species by biomolecular evidences on lung tissue. This new cross-species infection report, along with 19% of the cetaceans specimens examined by the Italian Stranding Network being found positive to DMV, support the hypothesis of an endemic circulation of this virus among Mediterranean cetaceans. © 2017 Centelleghe, Beffagna, Palmisano, Franzo, Casalone, Pautasso, Giorda, Di Nocera, Iaccarino, Santoro, Di Guardo and Mazzariol.},

As it is also an edible mollusc, concentrations of harmful elements in its tissues must be monitored. For these purposes, 464 wild individuals were collected from 12 sites along the Italian coasts. The concentration of fourteen trace elements (Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, Sn, Tl, and Zn) in their tissues was quantified. Among the three heavy metals, cadmium, lead, and mercury, none exceeded the maximum limit for in food set by European Union regulations but Cd in one sample from the Varano Lagoon resulted extremely close to this value. Contamination by Hg of the northern Adriatic and Orbetello Lagoons was also observed. Moreover, there was a positive association between the lagoon's environmental conditions and the bioaccumulation of this element in oysters. Despite the ban instituted 15 years ago on the use of Sn in antifouling paints, this element is still present in several marine environments, as demonstrated in the oysters sampled from harbour areas. Samples collected from harbours also showed very high concentrations of Cu and Zn due to the ability of oysters to accumulate these elements, which have replaced Sn in antifouling paints. Analysis of the samples from most sites indicated a low risk of human exposure to harmful elements through oyster consumption; nonetheless, chemical sanitary controls should focus primarily on Cd, Cu, and Zn. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={After thirty years, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) still represents the biggest crisis in the field of food safety. Initially detected in the United Kingdom in 1986, BSE spread to many other countries all over the world, involving approximately 200,000 cattle. The origin of BSE is uncertain, but epidemiological studies suggest that the source was cattle feed prepared from prion-infected animal tissues. The implementation of the drastic measures, including the ban of meat and bone meal from livestock feed and the removal of specified risk material from the food chain, has eventually resulted in a significant decline of the epidemic. For many years, it was believed that the disease was caused by transmission of a single prion strain. However, since 2004 two types of BSE, with distinct phenotypical characteristics, have been detected in Italy and France. These atypical types are characterized by distinct Western Blot profiles of abnormal protease-resistant prion protein, named high-type (H-BSE) and low-type (L-BSE). At present, there is no comprehensive information about the origin of the atypical BSEs (sporadic vs. acquired), and data about the pathogenesis of both atypical forms are very limited as compared to the classical type (C-BSE). This chapter will provide a well-organized overview of what is known about classical and atypical BSE. It will review information on the main epidemiological features, pathogenesis, and the criteria for routine diagnosis based on rapid tests, histological, immunohistochemical, and Western blot analysis. Furthermore, a brief overview about the most recently in vitro techniques will be also provided. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Introduction - European animal welfare legislation (2008/119/EC) poses limitations on the current management practices of Valle d'Aosta breeders. Aim - The haematological profiles, salivary cortisol concentrations, and behavioural responses of Valdostana calves housed in either tie-stalls (TS) or multiple pens (MP) were evaluated in relation to the age at enclosure: very young calves (VYC 7-39 days) or young calves (YC 40-80 days). Materials and methods - Twenty-nine calves were divided into two age groups: VYC (12 females and two males) and YC (13 females and two males). Blood and saliva samples were collected at baseline, at 20 (T1) and at 40 days (T2) after enclosure in one of the two housing systems. Behaviour was analyzed by direct closed-circuit TV recording. Results - Salivary cortisol levels measured at 40 days were significantly higher in the VYC housed in TS than those housed in MP (P<0.01). Differences in haematological profiles were observed only in the animals that had entered indoor housing (TS or MP) at age > 40 days. The VYC housed in TS spent more time in vigilant resting, tended to spend less time sleeping, and exhibited significantly more ruminant activity. Discussion - The type of enclosure for housing calves can affect haematological profiles, cortisol concentrations, and behaviours. A multidisciplinary approach is more effective for evaluating animal welfare than assessment investigating a single parameter. Conclusion - In this study, the hypothesis that MP housing could create stressful conditions in a breed selected for fighting behaviour was not confirmed by our data. The socioeconomic implications of different housing systems need to be studied in geographical areas with natural constraints, such as mountainous regions where local breeds are frequently reared. Animal welfare data on minor local breeds can be useful for informing practices and policies for maintaining biodiversity and breeding of local breeds.},

abstract={The term intersex describes alterations in gonadal development with the simultaneous presence of male and female reproductive stages in the same gonad of a gonochoristic species. In coastal and estuarine environments, euryhaline fish living in polluted waters such as Mugilidae can frequently show these sexual anomalies. In this work, we analysed adult specimens of three species of euryhaline mullets (Chelon labrosus, Liza aurata and Mugil cephalus) from two Sardinian lagoons (Marceddì and San Teodoro) devoted to extensive aquacultural practices, in order to identify putative alterations in gonads and in gamete development. Overall, 13 of the 158 mullets examined (8.2%) were affected by gonadal disorders: four subjects (one C. labrosus, two L. aurata and one M. cephalus) exhibiting an intersex condition were found in the Marceddì lagoon and the other nine (five C. labrosus, two L. aurata and two M. cephalus) in the San Teodoro lagoon. Twelve of these gonads were classified as testis-ova (TOs) and one, belonging to a C. labrosus specimen, was a mixed gonadal tissue (MGT). Intersex condition was evaluated using an intersex index and all the recorded values showed a mild Ovotestis Severity Index (OSI). However, our findings suggest that fish gonadal disorders may be underestimated in extensive reared fish species, particularly in coastal brackish environments polluted by intensive agriculture and animal husbandry activities. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a chronic contagious disease caused by Mycobacterium bovis (Mb), which have wide host range in mammalian species, man included. In Italy, bTB is subjected to eradication programs in cattle, that could lead many regions to acquire Officially bovine Tuberculosis Free status (OTF), as recently occurred to Piedmont too [Execu-tion of Decision (EU) 2016/168 of the Commission of 5 February 2016]. Among the causes that may contribute to the persistence of bTB in cattle it is recognized the infection of other susceptible species such as goats, whose role in transmission and maintenance of infection in mixed herd is reported in many European Countries, including Italy. bTB in goats often occurs in subclinical forms, but it is associated to severe gross pathological lesions with a relative high risk of Mb environmental spread and negative impact on the eradication programs. Surveillance in goats is not mandatory, except for raw milk producers (Reg. CE n. 853/2004 del Parlamento Europeo) or outbreak occurrence suspect (D.M. n. 592 del 15/12/1995) and this leads to a lack of data on the role of goat in the epidemiology of bTB. This case report describes the diagnostic procedure adopted for the management of an outbreak of bTB in a Piedmont herd, in which both cattle and goats were reared. The diagnostic protocol included intra-vitam tests as gamma interferon tests (Bovigam® ), Tuberculin Skin Test and indirect Elisa (IDEXX M. bovis Ab Test) and post-mortem exams as gross pathology, histopathology, microbiology and molecular tests (Spoligotyping and VNTR typing of isolated strains). On the basis of the intra-vitam test 13 cattle was declared infected and slaughtered highlighting typical lesions in 10 animals. Gamma interferon testing was extended to goats allowing to identify a positive animal that showed advanced lesions later at slaughter. Spoligotyping and VNTR typing identified the same strain type isolated from cattle (SB0134 VNTR 54534), confirming interspecific transmission. Due to high prevalence of infection, severity of observed lesions and inter-species bTB transmission, stamping out procedure was proposed and approved from Veterinary Services to extinguish the outbreak. Based on epidemiological analysis in this bTB outbreak, infection in small ruminants was fortuitous, even if the goat could have been represented a potential source of infection. The decision to extend intra-vitam tests to goats resulted conclusive for the extinction of the bTB outbreak. Therefore an epidemiological investigation conjugated to an appropriate diagnostic management represent the best ground for all actions targeted to the eradication of bTB outbreaks, especially in an area qualified as OTF.},

abstract={Small molecules like antibiotics or other pharmaceuticals can be detected and quantified,among others,with indirect competitive immunoassays. With regard to multiplex quantification,these tests can be performed as chemiluminescence microarray immunoassays,in which,in principle,the analyte in the sample and the same substance immobilized on the chip surface compete for a limited number of specific antibody binding sites. The amount of the specific primary antibody that has been bound to the surface is visualized by means of a chemiluminescence reaction. Validated quantitative confirmatory methods for the detection of contaminants,for example drug residues,in food samples usually comprise chromatographic analysis and spectrometric detection,e.g.,HPLC-MS,GC-MS,or GC with electron capture detection. Here,we describe a validation procedure (according to the Commission Decision of the European Communities 2002/657/EC) for multiplex immunoassays performed as flow-through chemiluminescence microarrays,using the example of a small molecule microarray for the simultaneous detection of 13 antibiotics in milk. By this means,we suggest to accept multianalyte immunoassays as confirmatory methods as well,to benefit from the advantages of a fast automated method that does not need any pretreatment of the sample. The presented microarray chip is regenerable,so an internal calibration is implemented. Therefore,the analytical results are highly precise,combined with low costs (the aim for commercialization is less than 1 € per analyte per sample,this is significantly less than HPLC-MS). © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2017.},

abstract={The present research studied for the first time the potential application of the fat derived from the black soldier fly larvae fat (BSLF) in substitution to the soybean oil in the diet for broiler chickens: growth performances, feed-choice, blood traits, carcass characteristics and meat quality were considered in this study. A total of 150 male broiler chicks (Ross 308) at one-day of age were randomly allotted to 3 dietary treatments (5 replicates and 10 birds/pen): a basal control diet (C group), and the same diet in which the soybean oil was replaced by 50% (CH group) or 100% (H group) BSLF. Growth performances, feed-choice test, blood traits and slaughtering performances were not influenced by diets. Independently of BSLF inclusion, broiler chickens breast meat had also similar crude protein and ether extract contents and displayed similar thawing loss. Furthermore, pH, L * , a * , b * colour values, and drip loss were unaffected by dietary treatments both at 0 and 9 days of refrigerated storage. As expected, the fatty acid profile of broiler chickens breast was greatly affected by BSLF inclusion level. With increasing BSLF inclusion rate, the proportion of SFA increased (32.2, 37.8, 43.5% for C, CH and H breast meat, respectively, p&lt;.001) to the detriment of the PUFA fraction (22.7, 23.0, 22.9% for C, CH and H breast meat, respectively, p&lt;.001). On the contrary, MUFA fraction was unaffected. BSLF inclusion guaranteed satisfactory productive performances, carcass traits and overall meat quality, thus suggesting that BSLF could be a promising new feed ingredient for chickens. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={In this article, we describe a spatially explicit exposure assessment model developed within the SPARE project (www.spare-europe.eu). In particular we show how we estimated the spatial probability that the introduction of one animal infected with a vector borne disease (in our example Bluetongue) will lead to at least one other infected animal, using the Piedmont region of North Western Italy as an example area. An extensive literature search lead to a systematic and structured inventory of exposure risk factors. This inventory was then used to develop scenario tree pathways, detailing the main exposure pathways, along with the equations and their parametrization. A stochastic model was then implemented and run. Based on the model, we provide maps with a different distribution of the probability of a secondary transmission. This is quite high in the whole region and temperature is the factor most influencing it: districts with smaller temperature peaks around 23°C in the period April-November show the highest risk and the lowest uncertainty.

abstract={Enrofloxacin (E) is commonly used in veterinary medicine. It is necessary to perform pharmacokinetic/dynamic studies to minimize the selection of resistant mutants of bacteria and extend the efficacy of antimicrobial agents. Eight healthy adult Pogona vitticeps were assigned into two groups of equal size and treated with a single intramuscular injection of E at 10 mg/kg. Blood samples were withdrawn at different scheduled times for each group, and rectal swabs were collected. E and ciprofloxacin (active metabolite) blood concentrations were quantified by an HPLC validated method, while the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated by the Kirby–Bauer disc diffusion susceptibility test. The pharmacokinetic profiles of E gave similar pharmacokinetic parameters irrespective of the collection time schedule. Bacteria isolation showed the presence of both E. coli, Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica and subspecies 3a, Proteus spp., and Pseudomonas spp. The majority of isolated colonies were sensitive to E, but the treatment did not reduce the number of bacteria in faeces. Results suggest that E is able to reach blood concentrations high enough to kill susceptible bacteria (MIC < 0.9 μg/mL), but at the same time does not significantly affect intestinal bacteria. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Background. Health of mammary glands is fundamental for milk and dairy products hygiene and quality, with huge impacts on consumers welfare. Methods. This study aims to investigate the microbial agents (bacteria, fungi and lentiviruses) isolated from 89 macroscopically healthy udders of regularly slaughtered small ruminants (41 sheep, 48 goats), also correlating their presence with the histological findings. Multinomial logistic regression was applied to evaluate the association between lesions and positivity for different microbial isolates, animal age and bacteria. Results. Twenty-five samples were microbiologically negative; 138 different bacteria were isolated in 64 positive udders. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most prevalent bacteria isolated (46.42%), followed by environmental opportunists (34.76%), others (10.14%) and pathogens (8.68%). Most mammary glands showed coinfections (75%). Lentiviruses were detected in 39.3% of samples. Histologically, chronic non-suppurative mastitis was observed in 45/89 glands, followed by chronic mixed mastitis (12/89) and acute suppurative mastitis (4/89). Only 28 udders were normal. Histological lesions were significantly associated with the animal species and lentiviruses and coagulase-negative staphylococci infections. Goats had significantly higher risk to show chronic mixed mastitis compared to sheep. Goats showed a significantly lower risk (OR D 0.26; 95% CI [0.06-0.71]) of being infected by environmental opportunists compared to sheep, but higher risk (OR D 10.87; 95% CI [3.69-37.77]) of being infected with lentiviruses. Discussion. The results of the present study suggest that macroscopically healthy glands of small ruminants could act as a reservoir of microbial agents for susceptible animals, representing a potential risk factor for the widespread of acute or chronic infection in the flock. © 2017 Spuria et al.},

abstract={Glioblastoma (GB) is a highly heterogeneous tumor. In order to identify in vivo the most malignant tumor areas, the extent of tumor infiltration and the sites giving origin to GB stem cells (GSCs), we combined positron emission tomography/ computed tomography (PET/CT) and conventional and advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with histology, immunohistochemistry and molecular genetics. Prior to dura opening and tumor resection, forty-eight biopsy specimens [23 of contrastenhancing (CE) and 25 of non-contrast enhancing (NE) regions] from 12 GB patients were obtained by a frameless image-guided stereotactic biopsy technique. The highest values of 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose maximum standardized uptake value (18F-FDG SUVmax), relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), Choline/ Creatine (Cho/Cr), Choline/N-acetylaspartate (Cho/NAA) and Lipids/Lactate (LL) ratio have been observed in the CE region. They corresponded to the most malignant tumor phenotype, to the greatest molecular spectrum and stem cell potential. On the contrary, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) in the CE region were very variable. 18F-FDG SUVmax, Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratio resulted the most suitable parameters to detect tumor infiltration. In edematous areas, reactive astrocytes and microglia/ macrophages were influencing variables. Combined MRI and 18F-FDG PET/CT allowed to recognize the specific biological significance of the different identified areas of GB. © Valentini et al.},

abstract={Iridoviridae are known to cause disease in sturgeons in North America. Here, histological and molecular methods were used to screen for this family of virus in sturgeons from various European farms with low-to-high morbidity. Some histological samples revealed basophilic cells in the gill and labial epithelia, strongly suggesting the accumulation of iridovirus particles. Newly developed generic PCR tests targeting the major capsid protein (MCP) gene of sturgeon iridoviruses identified in North America, namely the white sturgeon iridovirus and the Namao virus (NV), produced positive signals in most samples from four sturgeon species: Russian (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii), Siberian (A. baerii), Adriatic (A. naccarii) and beluga (Huso huso). The sequences of the PCR products were generally highly similar one another, with nucleotide identities greater than 98%. They were also related to (74–88%), although distinct from, American sturgeon iridoviruses. These European viruses were thus considered variants of a single new virus, provisionally named Acipenser iridovirus-European (AcIV-E). Moreover, three samples infected with AcIV-E showed genetic heterogeneity, with the co-existence of two sequences differing by five nucleotides. One of our European samples carried a virus distinct from AcIV-E, but closely related to NV identified in Canada (95%). This study demonstrates the presence of two distinct sturgeon iridoviruses in Europe: a new genotype AcIV-E and an NV-related virus. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Background: DNA extraction is one the most important steps for molecular analysis of food-borne pathogens. In this research, three methods of DNA extractions from beef harboring Sarcocystis spp. were compared for the quality, quantity, safety, as well as cost-effectiveness. Methods: About 100 mg intersostal and diaphragm were collected from 10 slaughtered cattle. After ensuring their contamination with Sarcocyst using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) with the specific primer pair, three methods of salting out, Phenol- Chloroform-Isoamylalcohol (PCI), and commercial kit were performed. Quantification, qualification, and amplification analysis of the extracted DNA was done using spectrophotometer, agarose gel electrophoresis, and PCR, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA test, by SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL software (v.16.0). Results: Qualification in all methods was appropriate but the ones related to salting out and PCI methods were the best in comparison with the ones from commercial kit. Quantification analysis indicated the mean concentration of 249.3±3.94, 67.8±5.1, and 31±2.7 ng/μl for PCI, salting out, and commercial kit, respectively. The purification analysis represented the mean ratios of A (260)/(280), 1.7±0.3, 1.63±0.2, and 1.81±0.6 for PCI, salting out, and commercial kit, respectively. No significant difference (p<0.05) was found between the yielded concentration and purification among three methods. Conclusion: The commercial kit is expensive, but salting out and PCI methods are cost effectiveness, however the last is considered as a toxic method. Because, amplification in all methods was appropriate, we introduced salting out for molecular detection of Sarcocystis in beef. © 2016 Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences.},

abstract={Insects are currently being considered as a novel protein source for animal feeds, because they contain a large amount of protein. The larvae of Tenebrio molitor (TM) have been shown to be an acceptable protein source for broiler chickens in terms of growth performance, but till now, no data on histological or intestinal morphometric features have been reported. This study has had the aim of evaluating the effects of dietary TM inclusion on the performance, welfare, intestinal morphology and histological features of free-range chickens. A total of 140 medium-growing hybrid female chickens were free-range reared and randomly allotted to two dietary treatments: (i) a control group and (ii) a TM group, in which TM meal was included at 75 g/kg. Each group consisted of five pens as replicates, with 14 chicks per pen. Growth performance, haematological and serum parameters and welfare indicators were evaluated, and the animals were slaughtered at the age of 97 days. Two birds per pen (10 birds/treatment) were submitted to histological (liver, spleen, thymus, bursa of Fabricius, kidney, heart, glandular stomach and gut) and morphometric (duodenum, jejunum and ileum) investigations. The inclusion of TM did not affect the growth performance, haematological or serum parameters. The morphometric and histological features were not significantly affected either, thus suggesting no influence on nutrient metabolization, performance or animal health. Glandular stomach alterations (chronic flogosis with epithelial squamous metaplasia) were considered paraphysiological in relation to free-range farming. The observed chronic intestinal flogosis, with concomitant activation of the lymphoid tissue, was probably due to previous parasitic infections, which are very frequently detected in free-range chickens. In conclusion, the findings of this study show that yellow mealworm inclusion does not affect the welfare, productive performances or morphological features of free-range chickens, thus confirming that TM can be used safely in poultry diets.

abstract={PCDDs, PCDFs, and PCBs are persistent organic pollutants (POPs) that accumulate in animal products and may pose serious health problems. Those able to bind the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), eliciting a plethora of toxic responses, are defined dioxin-like (DL) compounds, while the remainders are called non-DL (NDL). An EFSA opinion has highlighted the tendency of ovine liver to specifically accumulate DL-compounds to a greater extent than any other farmed ruminant species. To examine the possible role in such an accumulation of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (XME) involved in DL-compound biotransformation, liver samples were collected from ewes and cows reared in an area known for low dioxin contamination. A related paper reported that sheep livers had about 5-fold higher DL-compound concentrations than cattle livers, while the content of the six marker NDL-PCBs did not differ between species. Specimens from the same animals were subjected to gene expression analysis for AhR, AhR nuclear translocator (ARNT) and AhR-dependent oxidative and conjugative pathways; XME protein expression and activities were also investigated. Both AhR and ARNT mRNA levels were about 2-fold lower in ovine samples and the same occurred for CYP1A1 and CYP1A2, being approximately 3- and 9-fold less expressed in sheep compared to cattle, while CYP1B1 could be detectable in cattle only. The results of the immunoblotting and catalytic activity (most notably EROD) measurements of the CYP1A family enzymes were in line with the gene expression data. By contrast, phase II enzyme expression and activities in sheep were higher (UGT1A) or similar (GSTA1, NQO1) to those recorded in cattle. The overall low expression of CYP1 family enzymes in the sheep is in line with the observed liver accumulation of DL-compounds and is expected to affect the kinetics and the dynamics of other POPs such as many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, as well as of toxins (e.g. aflatoxins) or drugs (e.g. benzimidazole anthelmintics) known to be metabolized by those enzymes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Apart from prion protein genotype, the factors determining the host range and susceptiblity for specific transmissible spongiform encephalopathy agents remain unclear. It is known that bovine atypical L-BSE can transmit to a range of species including primates and humanised transgenic mice. It is important, therefore, that there is as broad an understanding as possible of how such isolates might present in food animal species and how robust they are on inter- and intra-species transmission to inform surveillance sytems and risk assessments. This paper demonstrates that L-BSE can be intracerebrally transmitted to sheep of several genotypes, with the exception of ARR/ARR animals. Positive animals mostly present with a cataplectic form of disease characterized by collapsing episodes and reduced muscle tone. PrP accumulation is confined to the nervous system, with the exception of one animal with lymphoreticular involvement. In Western blot there was maintenance of the low molecular mass and glycoform profile associated with L-BSE, irrespective of ovine host genotype, but there was a substantially higher N-terminal antibody signal relative to the core-specific antibody, which is similar to the ratio associated with classical scrapie. The disease phenotype was maintained on experimental subpassage, but with a shortened survival time indicative of an original species barrier and subsequent adaptation. Passive surveillance approaches would be unlikely to identify such cases as TSE suspects, but current statutory active screening methods would be capable of detecting such cases and classifying them as unusual and requiring further investigation if they were to occur in the field. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) type 1 in Italy is characterized by high genetic diversity, with at least 20 subtypes. Subtype 1f is endemic in a restricted geographic area, meaning that it has local distribution. We investigated the population dynamics of BVDV-1f in Northern Italy and characterized the transmission chains of a subset of samples from Piedmont and Aosta Valley regions. A total of 51 samples from 1966 to 2013 were considered and 5′ UTR sequences were used for phylogeography. A subset of 12 samples was selected for Npro gene sequencing and further characterization of the transmission chains using both molecular and epidemiological data. Phylogeography estimated the root of BVDV-1f tree in Veneto in 1965. Four significant subclades included sequences clustering by region: Lombardy (n = 3), Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna (n = 7), Piedmont (n = 17), Piedmont and Aosta Valley (n = 21). The Piedmont-only subclade has a ladder-like branching structure, while the Piedmont and Aosta Valley subclade has a nearly complete binary structure. In the subset, the outbreak reconstruction identified one sample from Piedmont as the most probable source of infection for the Aosta Valley cases. An ad hoc questionnaire submitted to public veterinarians revealed connections between sampled and non-sampled farms by means of trades, exhibitions and markets. According to the phylogeography, BVDV-1f moved westward, entering from Veneto, and spreading to Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna in the early 1990s, and finally to Piedmont and Aosta Valley in the first decade of 2000s. Both phylogeographic analyses on the whole dataset and on the selection of Npro dataset pointed out that subtype 1f entered Aosta Valley from Piedmont. The integration of molecular and epidemiological data revealed connections between farms, and such approach should be considered in any control plan. In Aosta Valley, the study showed that BVDV1f can be controlled only monitoring the introduction of cattle from Piedmont region. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={One of the most widely European farmed mollusc, the mussel Mytilus sp., has been subjected to massive mortalities located in Charente-Maritime (France) in spring 2014. The national surveillance network for mollusc health has reported a systematic detection of V. splendidus in all dying batches. V. splendidus is the type species of a clade composed of almost 20 known strains with variable pathogenicity on bivalves. In our study, we first developed a Multi Locus Sequence Analysis (MLSA), specific to V. splendidus group, based on fragments of 5 housekeeping genes: atpA, ftsZ, mreB, rpoD and topA. This tool was validated on reference strains and compared with individual gene analyses. It allowed a useful and reliable classification of V. splendidus closely-related strains. Thanks to MLSA, we then tried to classify genetically 23 strains isolated from healthy or dying mussels. 21 were classified within the Splendidus clade: in splendidus cluster (38%), in tasmaniensis cluster (24%), in artabrorum cluster (24%) and on distinct branches (14%). All of them were tested by injection to healthy adult mussels to identify possible pathogenic strains. Experimental trials revealed the presence of a strain called M3H, allied with the splendidus cluster and able to induce mortality in mussels with rates up to 80%. The M3H virulence was demonstrated by the recovery of the injected strain in dying animals, resulting from repeated experimental infections. Further work should be now conducted to explore the pathogenicity of the M3H strain towards different mussel batches and under various conditions. Statement of relevance Our MLSA is useful to identify related V. splendidus strains © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The concentrations of 14 essential and nonessential trace elements were determined in fish from Lake Tshangalele, Katanga province, Democratic Republic of Congo. This province has been a place of intensive mining activities for centuries, which have increased in recent years, due to the use of metals such as copper and cobalt for the industries of fast-growing countries. Lake Tshangalele, which receives effluents from metallurgical and mining plants in Likasi, is home to several fish species that are an important part of the diet of the local population, and, therefore, it constitutes a relevant site for documenting the human exposure to metals as a result of a fish diet. The highest concentrations (median levels, dry weight) of cobalt (7.25 mg kg− 1), copper (88.1 mg kg− 1), iron (197.5 mg kg− 1), manganese (65.35 mg kg− 1), zinc (122.9 mg kg− 1) and aluminum (135.4 mg kg− 1) were found in fish collected closest to the copper mining plant, with decreasing concentrations along the lake, up to the dam. In the most contaminated fish samples, values of up to 270.1 mg kg− 1 for Al, 173.1 mg kg− 1 for Cu, 220.9 mg kg− 1 for Zn, 211.0 mg kg− 1 for Mn, 324.2 mg kg− 1 for Fe, 15.1 mg kg− 1 for Co, 4.2 mg kg− 1 for Cr, 1.6 mg kg− 1 for Cd, 1.9 mg kg− 1 for Pb, and 1.8 mg kg− 1 for Ni were found. Metal contamination from mining activity resulted in being of great concern because of potential health risks to the local inhabitants due to the consumption of heavily contaminated fish.

abstract={Crops intended for human nutrition and food production containing different essential trace elements, such as copper and zinc, could be contaminated by toxic metals like cadmium and lead. The interrelationship between micronutrients and contaminant trace elements in different cereals was investigated in North-western Italy, where both agricultural and industrial activities are present. Elemental concentrations in sampled cereals were assessed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Rice, oats and barley reached the highest median levels for Al, Cd and Pb content, while corn samples were less contaminated by toxic metals. Regarding essential elements highest median values of Cu and Zn were both found in barley, while Ni median content was higher in oats. Rice had the lowest median levels of essential elements. The correlation study between toxic and essential elements seemed to demonstrate fixed trends in analysed samples, corroborating the importance of a different diet to limit potential adverse effects caused by toxic elements. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Hepatitis E virus (HEV) was detected in stools collected from wild boars in Italy, with an overall prevalence of 1.5 % (3/196). The sequence of a ~3.0-kb portion at the 3′ end of the genome of one such strain, HEV/WB/P6-15/ITA, was determined. In the full-length ORF2, which encodes the capsid protein, the virus was genetically closest to wild boar and human HEV strains currently classified as genotype 3 subtype c. Interestingly, the 3’ end of ORF2 of the WB/P6-15/ITA matched the 340-nucleotide (nt) sequence (94.0 % nt identity) of the human strain PeGe, identified in 2015 from a patient with acute hepatitis E in Genoa, Italy, suggesting that similar HEV strains are circulating in the same geographical setting in humans and animals. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.},

abstract={In the framework of a European Union (EU) Coordinated Monitoring Programme, different types of ready-to eat (RTE) products, including soft and semi-soft cheese (n = 398) and cooked meat products (n = 403), were collected at retail in Italy and tested for detection and enumeration of Listeria monocytogenes. An Integrative Survey of 2696 samples, including soft and semi-soft cheese (n = 894) and cooked meat products (n = 1802) was carried out to have statistically representative results at the national level. Considering the results obtained both from the EU and the national Integrative Survey, prevalence of contamination of meat products was 1.66% (95% CL: 1.02–2.73%) at the arrival of the samples at the laboratory and 1.92% (95% CL: 1.31%–2.82%) at the end of shelf-life. Spalla cotta was the most frequently contaminated meat product. Prevalence of contamination in cheese was 2.13% (95% CL: 1.37%–3.3%) at the arrival at the laboratory and 1.01% (95% CL: 0.41%–2.55%) at the end of shelf-life. To get information about differences between cheese rinds and pastes, these two parts were separately analysed in the Integrative Survey samples. L. monocytogenes was detected in 4.02% (95% CL: 2.60%–6.19%) of cheese rinds (n = 473), whereas only the 0.34% (95% CL: 0.12%–0.98%) of cheese pastes (n = 894) were contaminated. This difference was statistically significant (χ2 = 10.026, P &lt; 0.05). Gorgonzola and Taleggio were the most frequently contaminated cheeses. Non-compliance with EU official criteria (100 CFU/g) was reported in 0.55% of meat products at arrival at the laboratory, in 0.46% at the end of shelf-life, and in 1.9% of cheese rinds. PFGE showed that cheese rinds could have been the origin of the few pastes' contamination, highlighting genetic similarity between isolates found in these two cheese components. Genetic subtyping also showed the presence of different pulsotypes, usually belonging to different clusters, in isolates from different food types. The presence of some pulsotypes predominantly prevalent over the others, in products from the same manufacturer, could suggest environmental strains as the main source of contamination. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Cow's milk and egg allergies are two of the most common food allergies. Manufacturers of food products containing milk or eggs or their derivatives as an ingredient are required by European Union regulations to list their presence on the ingredient label. Under European Union legislation, member states are mandated to carry out food safety monitoring programs to verify compliance with food labeling requirements. Through the Regional Integrated Plan for Food Safety, the Piedmont (Italy) regional authority carries out an annual program to determine the presence of undeclared allergens in foods. In the 5-year period from 2010 to 2014, a total of 1,566 food samples were analyzed for the presence of hidden egg and milk proteins. The average positive percentage was 2.8% (3.6% egg and 2% milk proteins). Comparison between the allergen concentration and the published eliciting dose (ED) for egg proteins (0.03 mg) and for total milk proteins (0.1 mg) indicated a high risk of allergen exposure for sensitized consumers. The calculated exposure was up to 135X (for milk) the ED01 reported in the literature. Food manufacturers will need to improve their allergen control programs to reduce allergen exposure and risk.

abstract={Palytoxin (PLTX) and its analogues have been detected as seafood contaminants associated with a series of human foodborne poisonings. Due to a number of fatalities ascribed to the ingestion of PLTX-contaminated marine organisms, the development of methods for its detection in seafood has been recommended by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Due to its feasibility, the spectrophotometric hemolytic assay is widely used to detect PLTX in different matrices, even though a standardized protocol is still lacking. Thus, on the basis of available assay procedures, a new standardized protocol was set up using purified human erythrocytes exposed to PLTX (working range: 3.9 × 10−10–2.5 × 10−8 M) in a K+-free phosphate buffered saline solution, employing a 5 h incubation at 41 °C. An intra-laboratory characterization demonstrated its sensitivity (limit of detection, LOD = 1.4 × 10−10 M and quantitation, LOQ = 3.4 × 10−10 M), accuracy (bias = −0.8%), repeatability (RSDr = 15% and 6% for intra- and inter-day repeatability, respectively) and specificity. However, the standardized method seems not to be suitable for PLTX quantitation in complex matrices, such as mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) extracts, at least below the limit suggested by EFSA (30 μg PLTXs/Kg shellfish meat). Thus, the hemolytic assay for PLTX quantitation in seafood should be used only after a careful evaluation of the specific matrix effects. © 2016},

abstract={Small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLV) globally affect welfare and production of sheep and goats and are mainly controlled through elimination of infected animals, independently of the viral kinetics within the single animal. Control programs are based on highly sensitive serological tests, however the existence of low antibody responders leads to the permanent presence of seronegative infected animals in the flock, thus perpetuating the infection. On the other hand, long-term non-progressors show a detectable antibody response not indicative of a shedding animal, suggesting immune contention of infection. In this study, we analyse two goat populations within the same herd, harbouring low or high proviral SRLV loads respectively, both showing a robust antibody response. In vivo findings were confirmed in vitro since fibroblastic cell lines obtained from one high and one low proviral load representative goats, showed respectively a high and a faint production of virus upon infection with reference and field circulating SRLV strains. Differences in virus production were relieved when strain CAEV-Co was used for experimental infection. We analysed LTR promoter activity, proviral load, entry step and production of virus and viral proteins. Intriguingly, proteasomal activity was higher in fibroblasts from low proviral load animals and proteasome inhibition increased viral production in both cell lines, suggesting the implication of active proteasome-dependent restriction factors. Among them, we analysed relative expression and sequences of TRIM5α, APOBEC3 (Z1, Z2, Z3 and Z2-Z3) and BST-2 (Tetherin) and found a global antiviral status in low proviral carriers that may confer protection against viral shedding and disease onset. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Information regarding chemical pollutant levels in farmed fish and shellfish, along with the risks associated with their consumption is still scarce. This study was designed to assess levels of exposure to 21 trace elements in fish (Dicentrarchus labrax), mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and oysters (Crassostrea gigas) collected from aquaculture marine ecosystems of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Metal concentrations showed great variability in the three species; the highest values of the nonessential elements As and Cd were found in oysters while the highest levels of Al, Pb and V were found in mussels. The essential elements Cu, Mn and Zn were highest in oysters, but Fe, Cr, Ni, Se, Co and Mo levels were highest in mussels. Fish had the lowest concentrations for all trace elements, which were at least one order of magnitude lower than in bivalves. The rare earth elements cerium and lanthanum were found at higher levels in mussels than in oysters, but undetectable in fish. The maximum values set by European regulations for Hg, Cd and Pb were never exceeded in the examined samples. However, comparing the estimated human daily intakes (EHDIs) with the suggested tolerable copper and zinc intakes suggested a potential risk for frequent consumers of oysters. Similarly, people who consume high quantities of mussels could be exposed to concentrations of Al that exceed the proposed TWI (tolerable weekly intake). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Q fever is a zoonosis caused by the bacterium Coxiella burnetii; domestic ruminants, mainly goats and sheep, are the main source of Q fever outbreaks in humans. From both a public and an animal health perspective, providing reliable prevalence data is extremely relevant for the decision processes by policymakers and food producer organizations. Information on Q fever seroprevalence in small ruminants in Italy is currently incomplete and largely based on reports of reproductive disorders in livestock farms. To estimate animal and flock seroprevalence of C. burnetii in small ruminants (sheep, goats and mixed flocks), a cross-sectional study with a two-stage design was carried out in northwest Italy. Between January and December 2012, sera from 5738 animals (2553 sheep and 3185 goats) belonging to 411 flocks (206 goats, 111 sheep, and 94 mixed flocks) were examined for specific anti-C. burnetii IgG antibodies by a commercial ELISA kit. A questionnaire investigating possible associations between farm management and C. burnetii seropositivity was administered. At the flock level, the overall true seroprevalence adjusted for test sensitivity and specificity was 31.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 24.8-37.7). Sheep-farm and goat-farm true seroprevalence was 38.7% (95% CI 25.5-51.9) and 19.5% (95% CI 11.5-27.6), respectively. Interestingly, the true seroprevalence (48.5%; 95% CI 34.7-62.3) was higher in the mixed flocks (sheep and goats). At the animal level, the overall true seroprevalence was 15.9% (95% CI 15.4-16.4). No difference was found between the two species, but the true seroprevalence was significantly higher (χ2 = 7.49; p &lt; 0.007) among the goats in mixed flocks (25.7%; 95% CI 24.4-27.1) than the sheep (16.3%; 95% CI 15.1-17.4), suggesting a potential difference in susceptibility between the two species or the result of factors affecting their immune response or related to the livestock management system as the period of exposure to C. burnetii. A multivariable logistic model that controlled for farm-level clustering identified five main risk factors associated with farm seropositivity (p ≤ 0.05): flock size of more than 12 animals (odds ratio [OR] 4.2; 95% CI 2.6-6.7), contact with other flocks (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.2-3.6), mixed flock type (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.4-4.2), farms located in the western area (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.4-4.2), and infertility during the previous year (OR 2.6; 95% CI 1.2-5.2). The results of this study yielded baseline information that may be useful to set up future epidemiologic, flock management, and public health policies for the prevention and control of Q fever in Italy. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={European Commission Regulation (EU) 1276/2011 requires that fishery products intended for raw consumption be frozen at -20°C for not less than 24 h or at -35°C for at least 15 h in order to kill viable parasites other than trematodes. But because marinating processes are not always effective in destroying nematode larvae, raw marinated fish preparations should be frozen before consumption. This study evaluated the performance of a standardized histological method to distinguish between fresh and frozen-thawed raw marinated fish. Sixty anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) fillets were sampled: 30 were marinated at+4°C for 24 h, and 30 were frozen at 20°C for 24 h before being marinated for 24 h. All 60 samples were fixed in formalin, processed for paraffin embedding, cut, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The slide preparations were examined microscopically by three independent histopathologists and classified as frozen-thawed or negative according to standard operating procedure criteria in use at our laboratory. Performance evaluation of the method showed 100% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI], 88.4 to 100%) and 100% specificity (95% CI, 88.4 to 100%), and the interrater agreement (Cohen's kappa) was 1 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1). Histology proved a valid and reliable tool to distinguish fresh from frozen-thawed marinated fish. It can be applied to deliver safe raw fishery products to consumers in order to minimize the risk of anisakidosis. © 2016 International Association for Food Protection.},

abstract={Bovine papillomavirus type 14 (BPV-14) is a novel Deltapapillomavirus (δPV) which is most closely related to BPV-1, -2, and -13, well-known members of the δPV genus. So far BPV-14 has been detected in cutaneous neoplastic lesions in cattle and in feline sarcoids. As BPV-14 may share biological and pathological properties with BPV-1, -2 and -13, it has been hypothesized that, like other δPVs, BPV-14 could be associated with bovine bladder neoplasia.In this study, 50 tumors of the urinary bladder of cattle were diagnosed. DNA was extracted from all tumor samples as well as from 25 normal bladder samples and submitted to BPV-14 L1 PCR and subsequent amplicon sequencing analysis. BPV-14 L1 DNA sequences of specific 195 bp amplicons were obtained from 17 of 50 (34%) tumor DNA isolates; no BPV-14 DNA was detected from 25 normal samples. Amplicons revealed a 99% homology with the corresponding BPV-14 L1 DNA region (GenBank accession number KP276343.1). Co-infections by two or three δPV types were also seen. This study reveals the presence of BPV-14 DNA alone or in combination with other δPV DNA in bovine bladder tumors alone and suggests that BPV-14 could also be involved in bladder neoplasia as its E5 oncoprotein has the potential to induce cell proliferation. Furthermore, this is the first study to show the presence of BPV-14 in Europe, suggesting that BPV-14, like other δPVs, has a worldwide distribution. © 2016.},

abstract={From 1982 to 2006, seven sampling surveys were performed in Red Bay of the alpine Lake Tovel (Brenta Dolomites, Italy) to investigate the bryozoan fauna. The record of small and round floatoblasts was noteworthy as they were not comparable to those produced by any presently known Bryozoa species. Three different types of floatoblasts characterized by almost circular shape were distinguished using morphological traits. All recorded specimens were attributed to the species Plumatella repens (Linnaeus, 1758). The dimensions of type 1 are the smallest ever recorded for Italy. The particular morphology and smallness of floatoblasts were investigated. The authors deem that the features of type 1 in the geographically isolated population of Plumatella repens from Red Bay may be due to constant low water temperature. Therefore, they are proposing for type 1 the name Plumatella repens type dolomitica. © 2016 Unione Zoologica Italiana.},

In the last 20 years, this area has been the target of important anthropogenic impacts including maritime traffic and substantial industrial activities. Zooplankton contributes to the transfer of trace metals to higher trophic levels and constitute one of the recommended groups for the baseline studies of metals in the marine environment. The essential trace elements (As, Cu, Mn, Zn, Fe, Mo, Co, Cr, Se, Ni) and the nonessential trace elements (Al, Be, Cd, Pb, Sb, Sn, V) were generally found at concentrations of no concern in the analyzed zooplankton samples, but showed important variations between seasons and different water depths. The zooplankton was found to be a significant accumulator of metals, and bioaccumulation factors were in the range of 28 (Co) to 10,9015 (Fe) in marine surficial waters, with increasing values at increasing water depth. Zooplankton is a useful bioindicator to assess metal contamination and its impact in the marine environment. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Food forgery is one of the most articulated socio-economic concerns, which contributed to increase people awareness on what they eat. Identification of species represents a key aspect to expose commercial frauds implemented by substitution of valuable species with others of lower value. Fish species identification is mainly performed by morphological identification of gross anatomical features of the whole fish. However, the increasing presence on markets of new little-known species makes morphological identification of species difficult. In this paper we present FishAPP, a cloud-based infrastructure for fish species recognition. FishAPP is composed of a mobile application developed for the Android and the iOS mobile operating system enabling the user to shot pictures of a whole fish and submit them for remote analysis and a remote cloud-based processing system that implements a complex image processing pipeline and a neural network machine learning system able to analyze the obtained images and to perform classification into predefined fish classes. Preliminary results obtained from the available dataset provided encouraged results. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The behaviour of Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus in raw milk cheese slices packaged under vacuum was evaluated. Artificially contaminated 80-day ripened cheese was portioned, vacuum packaged, and then stored for 28 days at 4 °C and for 56 days at 10 °C. Bacterial counts were obtained before vacuum packaging and then weekly during storage. At the end of ripening, the initial L. monocytogenes count was 4.46 ± 0.89 log cfu g-1; weekly bacterial counts remained substantially unchanged in the samples stored at 4 °C but decreased to 3.54 ± 1.54 log cfu g-1 in those stored at 10 °C. The initial S. aureus count before vacuum packaging was 3.60 ± 0.78 log cfu g-1; it then gradually decreased to 2.60 ± 1.32 log cfu g-1 in the samples stored at 4 °C and to about 1.9 log cfu g-1 in those stored at 10 °C. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Classical bacteriological detection of Brucella species from food, and environment is routinely carried out based on morphological and biochemical characteristics. However, for increasing specificity and sensitivity of species identification methods, development of a molecular assay is necessary that was main aim of this study. Methods: Panel of some reference strains belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria were specifically used in this study. Additionally, the panel was enriched with 20 Brucella field strains isolated from 13 cattle and 7 sheep (West Kazakhstan region), and six strains from three cattle and three sheep (Almaty region). Bacterial identification before designing was carried out based on 16S rRNA sequencing with universal primers. Primer design was implemented using the Primer3 program. Finally, specificity and sensitivity of the PCR assay for Brucella identification were evaluated. Results: The sensitivity of the developed conventional PCR assays was assessed with the range of 2×10 5 to 12 genomic copies isolated from B. abortus 100 and B. melitensis H-12 reference strains. The sensitivity of the developed assays using Ba and Ba-r, Bm and Bm-r primers was determined to be 1.6×10 3 genomic copies. Conclusion: Quick detection and species identification of Brucella strains circulating in Kazakhstan would help local authorities in decision-making and implementation of the most effective strategies for control of these bacteria. Our PCR-based assay was the first step towards developing a novel kit with final aim of standardizing molecular identification of B. abortus and B. melitensis in foods of animal origin in Kazakhstan and other central Asia countries. © 2016, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences.},

abstract={Ingestion of staphylococcal enterotoxins preformed by Staphylococcus aureus in food leads to staphylococcal food poisoning, the most prevalent foodborne intoxication worldwide. There are five major staphylococcal enterotoxins: SEA, SEB, SEC, SED, and SEE. While variants of these toxins have been described and were linked to specific hosts or levels or enterotoxin production, data on sequence variation is still limited. In this study, we aim to extend the knowledge on promoter and gene variants of the major enterotoxins SEB, SEC, and SED. To this end, we determined seb, sec, and sed promoter and gene sequences of a well-characterized set of enterotoxigenic Staphylococcus aureus strains originating from foodborne outbreaks, human infections, human nasal colonization, rabbits, and cattle. New nucleotide sequence variants were detected for all three enterotoxins and a novel amino acid sequence variant of SED was detected in a strain associated with human nasal colonization. While the seb promoter and gene sequences exhibited a high degree of variability, the sec and sed promoter and gene were more conserved. Interestingly, a truncated variant of sed was detected in all tested sed harboring rabbit strains. The generated data represents a further step towards improved understanding of strain-specific differences in enterotoxin expression and host-specific variation in enterotoxin sequences. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Products of animal origin represent the main route of human exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs (DL-compounds). Recently, concerns have been raised about ovine products, particularly the liver, in which relatively high levels of DL-compounds have been reported. We surveyed ovine and bovine livers in areas with no known sources of dioxin or DL-PCB contamination, in order to assess accumulation patterns for both DL-compounds and non-DL (NDL-) PCBs. None of the ovine and bovine samples exceeded the current Maximum Limits (MLs) for DL-compounds. Liver DL-compound TEQ concentrations were up to 5-fold higher in sheep than in cows. No statistically significant differences in total NDL-PCBs levels were found. The main contributors to TEQ levels were the Penta- and Hexa-chlorinated PCDFs and PCB 126. The results confirm the increased bioaccumulation in ovine liver towards specific DL-compounds even in ewes reared in areas with no known sources of PCDD/Fs or DL-PCBs contamination. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) is a significant pathogen affecting the young Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, worldwide. A new variant, OsHV-1 μVar, has been associated with recurrent mortality events in Europe since 2008. Epidemiological data collection is key for global risk assessment; however little is known about health status and genotypes present in European wild oyster beds. Most studies to date have involved only cultivated individuals during mortality events, and reported low genotype diversity. With this study, conducted along the Italian coasts, we investigated for the first time the presence of OsHV-1 in European natural oyster beds. Analysis of three genomic regions revealed the presence of at least nine different genotypes, including two variants close to the OsHV-1 reference, known since the early 1990s but with no European record reported since 2010, and highlights relevant genotype diversity in natural environment. Phylogenetic analysis distinguished two distinct clusters and geographical distribution of genotypes, with the exception of a variant very closely related to the μVar, which appeared the single genotype present in all the Adriatic sites. Interestingly, these wild symptom free populations could represent, in Europe, an accessible alternative to the import of OsHV-1-resistant oyster strains from the East Pacific, the native area of C. gigas, avoiding the high-risk of non-native marine species and new pathogen introductions. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Host-seeking ticks were collected in the Northern Apennines, Italy, by dragging at 35 sites, at altitudes ranging from 680 and 1670 m above sea level (asl), from April to November, in 2010 and 2011. Ixodes ricinus (4431 larvae, 597 nymphs and 12 adults) and Haemaphysalis punctata (11,209 larvae, 313 nymphs, and 25 adults) were the most abundant species, followed by Haemaphysalis sulcata (20 larvae, five nymphs, and 13 adults), Dermacentor marginatus (42 larvae and two adults) and Ixodes hexagonus (one nymph). Greatest numbers of ticks were collected at locations characterised by southern exposure and limestone substratum, at altitudes <1400 m asl; I. ricinus was most abundant in Turkey oak (Quercus cerris) wood, whereas H. punctata was mostly collected in hop hornbeam (Ostrya carpinifolia) wood and on exposed rocks. Ixodes ricinus was also found up to 1670 m asl, in high stand beech (Fagus sylvatica) wood. The overall prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (sl) in 294 host-seeking I. ricinus nymphs was 8.5 %. Borrelia garinii was the most frequently identified genospecies (64.0 % of positive nymphs), followed by B. valaisiana, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. afzelii, and B. lusitaniae. Based upon the comparison with the results of previous studies at the same location, these research findings suggest the recent invasion of the study area by the tick vector and the agents of Lyme borreliosis. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={A simple validated LC-MS/MS-based method was set up to detect milk contamination in bakery products, taking the effects of food processing into account for the evaluation of allergen recovery and quantification. Incurred cookies were prepared at eight levels of milk contamination and were cooked to expose all milk components, including allergenic proteins, to food processing conditions. Remarkable results were obtained in term of sufficiently low LOD and LOQ (1.3 and 4 mg/kg cookies, respectively). Precision was calculated as intra-day repeatability (RSD in the 5-20% range) and inter-day repeatability (4 days; RSD never exceeded 12%). The extraction recovery values ranged from 20% to 26%. Method applicability was evaluated by analysing commercial cookies labelled either as "milk-free" or "may contain milk". Although the ELISA methodology is considered the gold standard for detecting allergens in foods, this robust LC-MS/MS approach should be a useful confirmatory method for assessing and certifying "milk-free" food products. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Data on MT in female dogs was retrieved from the Animal Tumor registry of dogs and cats of Venice and Vicenza provinces during 2005-2013 and was analyzed to visualize crude incidence rates by breed and across age categories. Overall, 2744 mammary tumors were reported accounting for 54% of all tumors in female dogs. The annual incidence rate (IR) was 250 cases per 100,000 dogs. The most frequent malignant tumors were complex carcinomas, consisting of both epithelial and myoepithelial tissues (IR = 71.89), and simple carcinomas (IR = 62.59). The MT incidence rate increased through the study period; particularly in the last 4 years, and malignant neoplasms occurred more frequently (70%) than the benign counterparts (30%). Seventy-four percent of tumors were diagnosed in intact females, and the mean age at diagnosis was significantly higher for spayed dogs than for intact ones. MT were less frequent in dogs younger than 6 years and increased up to approximately 60% for ages between 8 and 13 years. The purebred dogs had a higher probability to have a malignant neoplasm than mixed-breed dogs, particularly in dogs younger than 7 years, and the Samoyed, Dobermann, Schnauzer and Yorkshire Terrier breeds were more inclined to develop malignant MT. The incidence of MT in dogs is increasing, and IRs are comparable to that in women. The epidemiological similarities between dogs and women support the validity of canine MT as a model for human breast cancer. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The immunogenicity of two inactivated bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8) vaccines was evaluated in 880 cattle under field conditions. The effect of selected factors on vaccine performance was also analysed at the herd and animal levels (vaccine, herd size and production, age, sex, time interval between vaccination and blood sampling and veterinary training). The immunogenicity elicited by vaccination with the two vaccines was monitored with the aid of a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA) and serum neutralization test (SNT). To investigate whether the selected factors influenced seroconversion at the herd and animal levels, a multilevel logistic regression model developed in a mixed model was applied. Of the 880 cattle vaccinated, 76.0% yielded BTV c-ELISA antibodies, whereas only 25.0% seroconverted based on SNT. Type of vaccine (odds ratio [OR] 4.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.2-9.0 for SNT and OR 3.5; 95% CI, 2.1-5.9 for c-ELISA), veterinary training in vaccine administration (OR 8.1; 95% CI, 4.7-14.1 for SNT and OR 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.2 for c-ELISA), animal age (OR 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.8 for SNT and OR 1.7; 95% CI, 1.4-2.1 for c-ELISA) and days between first vaccine administration and blood collection (OR 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.1 for SNT and OR 2.6; 95% CI, 1.7-3.8 for c-ELISA) were the major factors affecting vaccine performance under field conditions.

abstract={Prion diseases, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathies (BSE), are transmissible neurodegenerative disorders affecting humans and a wide variety of mammals. Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), a prion disease in humans, has been linked to exposure to BSE prions. This classical BSE (cBSE) is now rapidly disappearing as a result of appropriate measures to control animal feeding. Besides cBSE, two atypical forms (named Hand L-type BSE) have recently been described in Europe, Japan, and North America. Here we describe the first wide-spectrum microarray analysis in whole blood of atypical BSEinfected cattle. Transcriptome changes in infected animals were analyzed prior to and after the onset of clinical signs. The microarray analysis revealed gene expression changes in blood prior to the appearance of the clinical signs and during the progression of the disease. A set of 32 differentially expressed genes was found to be in common between clinical and preclinical stages and showed a very similar expression pattern in the two phases. A 22-gene signature showed an oscillating pattern of expression, being differentially expressed in the preclinical stage and then going back to control levels in the symptomatic phase. One gene, SEL1L3, was downregulated during the progression of the disease. Most of the studies performed up to date utilized various tissues, which are not suitable for a rapid analysis of infected animals and patients. Our findings suggest the intriguing possibility to take advantage of whole blood RNA transcriptional profiling for the preclinical identification of prion infection. Further, this study highlighted several pathways, such as immune response and metabolism that may play an important role in peripheral prion pathogenesis. Finally, the gene expression changes identified in the present study may be further investigated as a fingerprint for monitoring the progression of disease and for developing targeted therapeutic interventions. © 2016 Xerxa et al.

abstract={Animal welfare during transportation has been investigated in several studies, as opposed to post-transportation phases. In this study, we evaluated the effect of a novel environment after transportation on 26 Friesian bulls, 242 ± 42 day-old, from ten different dairy farms. Animals were shipped to a breeding center in different seasons, and selected parameters of innate immunity (serum bactericidal activity, hemolytic complement, serum albumin, α, β, and γ-globulins, interleukin-6, TNF-α) were monitored before and after the arrival at days-4/0/4/15/30. Our results showed significant differences of IL-6 and TNF-α protein levels at destination in December (94 ± 1.3 pg/ml) and June (+788 pg/ml), respectively. Moreover, the serum levels of these cytokines increased between days 0 and 15 after the arrival, the modulation of IL-6 being in agreement with established models of physical and/or psychological stress. Concerning the modulation of albumin, alpha and beta-globulins, the highest levels were detected in April, whereas a significant decrease was observed between day 15 and 30 after arrival; on the contrary, γ-globulin levels significantly increased after day 15. The results of this study highlight the occurrence of innate immune responses of young bulls to the combined effects of climate (season) and novel farming conditions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract={Nowadays, leptospirosis is a re-emerging widespread infectious disease often underestimate worldwide. The National Reference Centre for Leptospirosis (NRCL), at the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell’Emilia Romagna, Brescia (Italy), with the cooperation of all the other Istituti Zooprofilattici Sperimentali (IIZZSS), evaluated the distribution of such important zoonosis in Italy. Serological data obtained between 2010-2011 by each laboratory were collected by the NRCL and discussed. Serum samples collected from 43,935 animal specimens were analysed by the Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT), using a panel of 8 serogroups as antigens (Australis, Ballum, Canicola, Grippotyphosa, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Pomona, Sejroe, Tarassovi). A MAT cut-off of 1:100 was used to identify the serological positivities, 6,279 sera showed positive titers. Bovine (46.9%), swine (27.5%), ovine and goat (7.4%), dog (6.9%), and wild boar (4.5%) samples were delivered to the Laboratories more frequently than equine and other species sera. Data analysis showed that the most common serogroups in Italy are: Australis present in dogs, wild boars, horses, hares, swine, foxes, and rodents; Sejroe detected in cattle, sheep, goats, and buffaloes; Icterohaemorrhagiae present in dogs, goats, and foxes; Pomona detected in swine, cattle, and wild species; Grippotyphosa reported in hares. © 2016, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell’Abruzzo e del Molise “G.Caporale”.

abstract={The Italian Piedmontese cattle breed is traditionally housed in tie-stalls and, to a lesser extent, in loose housing systems with free stalls. The present study has compared the same group of 15 cattle before and after stable renovation (tie-stall vs free-stall housing) funded by Regulation (EU) No. 1305/2013. All the animals remained healthy during the trial, no clinical signs were observed and no mastitis occurred. The tested parameters were: locomotion scoring system, salivary cortisol, blood parameters, serum acute phase protein (albumin, haptoglobin, serum amyloid A and lysozyme). Samples were collected 3 times: before the change (T1), 3 days later (T2), 40 days later (T3). The change in housing determined noteworthy variations in the stress parameters: albumin and total protein displayed the lowest value at T2, while lysozyme displayed the lowest value at T3. Among the App, SAA and Hp were not affected by the sampling time. Salivary cortisol displayed the highest value at T1. This study suggests that tie-stall housing can endanger the welfare of animals, and it is hoped that this farming system will be abandoned in the future. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={amyloid-β (Aβ) deposits are seen in aged individuals of many mammalian species that possess the same aminoacid sequence as humans. This study describes Aβ deposition in 102 clinically characterized cattle brains from animals aged 0 to 20 years. Extracellular and intracellular Aβ deposition was detected with 4G8 antibody in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. X-34 staining failed to stain Aβ deposits, indicating the non β-pleated nature of these deposits. Western blot analysis and surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectrometry revealed in Tris, Triton, and formic acid fractions the presence of different Aβ peptides, characterized mainly by C-terminally truncated forms. Exploration of the genetic variability of APOE, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes involved in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis revealed several previously unreported polymorphisms. This study demonstrates certain similarities between Aβ deposition patterns exhibited in cattle brains and those in the human brain in early stages of aging. Furthermore, the identification of the same Aβ peptides reported in humans, but unable to form aggregates, supports the hypothesis that cattle may be protected against amyloid plaque formation. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={PCDDs/Fs, DL-PCBs and NDL-PCBs are environmentally persistent substances that have been associated with adverse effects on human health. Humans are mainly exposed to these pollutants through ingestion of contaminated fish and fishery products; the consumption of fatty fish such as European catfish can contribute considerably to the intake of dioxins and PCBs.Samples of fish muscle of the top-of-the-food-chain predator Silurus glanis from the northern Italian Lake Varese were analyzed to detect the levels of 17 PCDD/F and 18 PCB congeners. All samples presented detectable levels of PCDD/Fs and PCBs, with concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 1.310pgg-1 wet weight (w.w.) for σ PCDD/Fs, 0.031 to 21.000pgg-1 w. w. for σ DL-PCBs, and 0.397 to 117.910ngg-1 w. w. for σ NDL-PCBs. One sample exceeded the maximum levels of 6.5pgg-1 w. w. for the sum of PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs set by European regulations for fish (1259/2011 EU), while other samples exceeded the action levels of 0.75pgg-1 w. w. for the sum of PCDD/Fs, and 2pgg-1 w. w. for the sum of DL-PCBs (277/2012 EU).Consuming contaminated catfish may pose a risk for human health, especially for the subpopulation traditionally accustomed to eating this fish, as well as sensitive individuals, such as children and pregnant women. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The presence of xenobiotics, such as metals, in ecosystems is concerning due to their durability and they pose a threat to the health and life of organisms. Moreover, mercury can biomagnify in many marine food chains and, therefore, organisms at higher trophic levels can be adversely impacted. Although feathers have been used extensively as a bio-monitoring tool, only a few studies have addressed the effect of both age and sex on metal accumulation. In this study, the concentrations of trace elements were determined in the feathers of all members of a captive colony of African Penguins (Spheniscus demersus) housed in a zoological facility in Italy. Tests were performed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry to detect aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, manganese, nickel, lead, selenium, tin, vanadium, and zinc. Mercury was detected by a direct mercury analyzer. Sexing was performed by a molecular approach based on analyzing the chromo-helicase-DNA-binding1 gene, located on the sex chromosomes. Sex- and age-related differences were studied in order to investigate the different patterns of metal bioaccumulation between male and female individuals and between adults and juveniles. Juvenile females had significantly higher arsenic levels than males, while selenium levels increased significantly with age in both sexes. Penguins kept in controlled environments—given that diet and habitat are under strict control—represent a unique opportunity to determine if and how metal bioaccumulation is related to sex and age. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Pine nuts are a known source of food allergens and several cases of adverse immunological reaction after ingestion have been reported. To protect allergic consumers, methods to unequivocally detect the presence of pine nuts in complex matrices must be developed. A Taqman-based real time PCR method for the detection of Pinus spp. was set up. A homemade pesto spiked at known concentration of pine nut powder was used as model food. Moreover, DNA was purified from commercial foods declaring or not the presence of pine nuts. The method displayed a very high efficiency and specificity for the genus Pinus. The intrinsic LOD was 1 pg of DNA, while the practical LOD evaluated on model foods was 0.1 ppm of pine nuts powder, the lowest ever registered for the detection of food allergens via real-time PCR. Finally, the declared presence/absence of pine nut in commercial foods was confirmed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Listeria monocytogenes, Toxoplasma gondii and Brucella spp. can infect a wide range of species, including humans. In cetaceans, meningoencephalitis has been associated with T. gondii and Brucella spp. infection, whereas to our knowledge, L. monocytogenes infection has not previously been reported. Meningoencephalitis and L. monocytogenes, T. gondii and Brucella spp. were identified by means of both direct and indirect laboratory techniques in an adult female striped dolphin Stenella coeruleoalba found stranded in January 2015 on the Ligurian Sea coast, northwestern Italy. The animal was emaciated, and histopathology disclosed severe meningoencephalitis. The nature of the inflammatory response and intra-lesional protozoa were consistent with a mixed infection by L. monocytogenes, T. gondii and Brucella spp. We believe this is an unprecedented case of infection by 3 zoonotic pathogens and also the first bacteriologically confirmed case report of neurolisteriosis in cetaceans. Cerebral toxoplasmosis and neurobrucellosis may have led to the animal's disorientation and stranding, with L. monocytogenes having likely exacerbated the coinfection leading to the demise of this dolphin. © Inter-Research 2016.},

Genetic typing of BDV has led to the identification of at least seven major genotypes. This study reports the detection of a BDV strain from a goat in northwestern Italy during routine investigations. Sequence analysis revealed mutations in the 5’-UTR of the virus with implications for BDV molecular diagnostics. Moreover, subsequent phylogenetic analysis based on the combined 5’-UTR and Npro/partial C genes, showed divergence from known BDV genotypes, revealing the detection of a novel pestivirus group, for which we propose the name BDV genotype 8. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Wien.},

abstract={In many Italian regions, sheep farming development appear to be backward: So, information about existing problems could be useful to direct support interventions. During 2014 and in the context of a research on scrapie, we conducted a survey on livestock management to identify animal health issues that concern farmers and cost items they consider penalizing. The involved breeders were selected by random sampling and a standardized first-tested questionnaire was administered via telephone interviews. The response rate was 60% (286 contacted eligible farmers and 172 respondents) and the average interview length was 22 minutes. Veterinary health interventions to fight against the causes of mortality and infertility would be particularly appreciated by farmers; similarly a training on good practices for farm management could be helpful. In addition, economic or sanitary interventions should be provided to facilitate the removal of dead animals. © 2016 L'Association pour l'Etude de l'Epidemiologie des Maladies Animales.

abstract={Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are environmental contaminants belonging to a chemical group known as perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), which are very persistent in the environment. PFASs are potential reproductive and developmental toxicants and are considered to be endocrine disrupters. These compounds have been found with greater frequency in fish and other seafood compared to other food groups. In fact, aquatic ecosystems represent the final reservoir for PFASs due to their high affinity for sedimentary and living organic matter. Recommendation161/2010/EU stated that the Member States should carry out analysis of perfluoroalkylated substances in order to detect the presence of PFOS and PFOA by making use of an analytical method that has been proven to generate reliable results. The LC-MS/MS method described here has been developed for detecting PFOS and PFOA in fish and cereals. Validation of this method resulted in limits of quantification (LOQs) varying from 0.50 μg/kg for PFOA to 0.70 μg/kg for PFOS, fulfilling recoveries (95-109%), and showing a good linearity (R2 = 0.99). Precision varied from 4.43% to 8.97% of repeatability for PFOA and from 6.30% to 12.33% of repeatability for PFOS. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Food-borne campylobacteriosis is caused mainly by the handling or consumption of undercooked chicken meat or by the ingestion of contaminated raw milk. Knowledge about the contributions of different food sources to gastrointestinal disease is fundamental to prioritize food safety interventions and to establish proper control strategies. Assessing the genetic diversity among Campylobacter species is essential to our understanding of their epidemiology and population structure. We molecularly characterized 56 Campylobacter jejuni isolates (31 from patients hospitalized with gastroenteritis, 17 from raw milk samples, and 8 from chicken samples) using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) in order to trace the source of the disease. We also used a population genetic approach to investigate the source of the human cases from six different reservoirs of infection. MLST identified 25 different sequence types and 11 clonal complexes (CCs) (21, 658, 206, 353, 443, 48, 61, 257, 1332, 354, 574) and these included several alleles not cited previously in the PubMLST international database. The most prevalent CCs were 21, 206, and 354. PFGE showed 34 pulsotypes divided between 28 different clusters. At the fine scale, by means of PFGE and MLST, only two human cases were linked to raw milk, while one case was linked to chicken meat. The investigation revealed the presence of several genotypes among the human isolates, which probably suggests multiple foci for the infections. Finally, the source attribution model we used revealed that most cases were attributed to chicken (69.75%) as the main reservoir in Italy, followed to a lesser extent by the following sources: Cattle (8.25%); environment (6.28%); wild bird (7.37%); small ruminant (5.35%), and pork (2.98%). This study confirms the importance of correlating epidemiological investigations with molecular epidemiological data to better understand the dynamics of infection. © 2016 Di Giannatale, Garofolo, Alessiani, Di Donato, Candeloro, Vencia, Decastelli and Marotta.},

abstract={Organophosphates (OPs) are derivatives of phosphoric acid widely used in agriculture as pesticides. Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is an OP that is extremely toxic to aquatic organisms. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is considered as a sentinel model species for ecotoxicology assessment in freshwater ecosystems. An exposure study was carried out on rainbow trout to investigate genetic responses to CPF-induced oxidative stress by Real-Time PCR, and to determine the accumulation dynamics of CPF and toxic metabolite chlorpyrifos-oxon (CPF-ox) in edible parts, by HPLC-MS/MS. Among the genes considered to be related to oxidative stress, a significant increase in HSP70 mRNA levels was observed in liver samples up to 14 days after CPF exposure (0.05 mg/L). CPF concentrations in muscle samples reach mean values of 285.25 ng/g within 96 hours of exposure, while CPF-ox concentrations were always under the limit of quantification (LOQ) of the applied method. Our findings lead us to consider HSP70 as a suitable genetic marker in rainbow trout for acute and medium-term monitoring of CPF exposure, complementary to analytical determinations. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In 2008, a 2‑month‑old male German shepherd was presented with fever, depression, and evident organic wasting. The puppy died within 48 hours after the onset of clinical signs. A complete necropsy was performed. Bacteriological examination of samples from the brain, lung, liver, spleen, and bone marrow tested positive for Pasteurella pneumotropica. Histopathology demonstrated inflammatory and vascular lesions in the central nervous system and internal organs. Canine adenovirus type 1 (CAdV‑1) nucleic acid was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the frozen brain but not in the formalin‑fixed, paraffin‑embedded liver and lung samples. The positive PCR was subsequently confirmed by indirect fluorescent antibody testing of the paraffin‑embedded brain and liver sections. Although the liver is the primary site of viral damage, these laboratory findings suggest that CAdV‑1 infection should be included in the differential diagnosis of neuropathological diseases in dogs and that adenoviral infections could promote septicaemia caused by opportunistic pathogens. © 2016, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise “G.Caporale”.

abstract={Cancer stem cells (CSCs) represent a small subpopulation of cells responsible for tumor formation and progression, drug resistance, tumor recurrence and metastasization. CSCs have been identified in many human tumors including osteosarcoma (OSA). CSC distinctive properties are the expression of stem cell markers, sustained growth, self-renewal and tumorigenicity. Here we report the isolation of stem-like cells from two canine OSA cultures, characterized by self-renewal, evaluated by sphere formation ability, differential marker expression, and in vitro proliferation when cultured in a medium containing EGF and bFGF. Current therapies for OSA increased survival time, but prognosis remains poor, due to the development of drug resistance and metastases. Chemotherapy shrinks the tumor mass but CSCs remain unaffected, leading to tumor recurrence. Metformin, a drug for type 2 diabetes, has been shown to possess antitumor properties affecting CSC survival in different human and animal cancers. Here we show that metformin has a significant antiproliferative effect on canine OSA stem-like cells, validating this in vitro model for further pre-clinical drug evaluations. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining CSC-enriched cultures from primary canine OSA cells as a promising model for biological and pharmacological studies of canine and human OSAs. © 2016, Hokkaido University.

abstract={The activity budgets of seven captive tigers (Panthera tigris) housed in four zoological gardens (A, B, C, D) were analysed to assess their welfare and to relate it to several variables, including enclosure type, management, and animal history. Behaviours were recorded by instantaneous focal animal sampling at 2-min intervals. Data were collected by five observers using an ethogram listing 26 behaviours adapted from the literature. To process the data, the activity budgets of each tiger and the overall activity budget were constructed. On the basis of previous literature, some of the behaviours, listed in the ethogram, were labelled as indicators of diminished welfare and some were labelled as indicators of enhanced welfare. Statistical analysis was carried out to determine in which zoo the tigers were more prone to exhibit indicators of enhanced welfare and which feature(s) had a major effect on their welfare. Over 195. h of data were collected and 5867 observations were recorded. The tigers in zoo A (OR = 4.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.2-5.3) and zoo C (OR = 1.83, 95% CI 1.4-2.4) were more prone to express indicators of enhanced welfare with respect to zoo D as the reference. Among the variables describing animal peculiarity, daily routine management, and enclosure features, the presence of a water pool with clean water was significantly associated with enhanced welfare (OR = 2.04, 95% CI 1.4-3.04). The data suggested that none of the tigers displayed consistent signs of stress and that all experienced a basic welfare status. An essential feature that helped to enhance good animal welfare was a water pool in the enclosure containing clean water. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs), the localization of the prion protein in the neuronal membrane lipid rafts (LR) seems to play a role in sustaining the protein misfolding. Changes in membrane properties, due to altered lipid composition, affect their organization and interaction between lipids and protein therein, and consequently also membrane resident protein functionality; dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), gangliosides and cholesterol seem to influence these processes. Aims In this work, the influence of administration of different feed, able to change the composition of lipid membrane, on the clinical progression of prion disease was studied. Main methods The activity of three diets (hyperlipidic with 6% fats; hypolipidic with 0.1% fats; and purified with 4% fats) was tested in CD1 mouse model experimentally infected with RML scrapie strain. Presence and distribution of typical central nervous system (CNS) lesions and deposits of PrPsc were evaluated by histopathological analysis and immunohistochemistry. Analysis of lipids was performed in homogenate and insoluble brain fraction of the neuronal membrane rich in LR. Key findings Results show that a diet with a different lipid level has not a significant role in the development of the scrapie disease. All infected mice fed with different diets died in the same time span. Histology, immunohistochemistry, and neuropathological analyses of the infected brains did not show significant differences between animals subjected to different diets. Significance Independently of the diet, the infection induced a significant modification of the lipid composition in homogenates, and a less noticeable one in insoluble brain fraction. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Background: Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV1) is a member of the viral subfamily of Alphaherpesvirinae that infects various species, including cattle, sheep, and goats. The virus causes infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), which is included in a European list of diseases that may require control and eradication programs. The lack of confirmatory tests affects the validity of diagnostic tools, especially those used for vaccinated herds. In this study, we report the development and validation of an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on BoHV1 glycoprotein E, which was expressed as a secreted recombinant antigen in a mammalian cell system. The performance of the new rec-gE ELISA was compared with that of commercially available indirect and/or blocking ELISAs. Results: The sample set included blood sera from animals from IBR-positive farms, IBR-free farms, and marker-vaccinated farms. The indirect ELISA proposed in this study is based on antibody reactivity against BoHV1 gE, and showed high sensitivity and specificity (98.41 and 99.76 %, respectively). Conclusions: The ELISA performed well, in terms of both its diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, and as a confirmatory methodology, and therefore should improve the diagnostic protocols used for IBR surveillance. © 2015 Bertolotti et al.},

abstract={Over the last few years, low levels of prednisolone have been reported in several cattle urine samples by a number of laboratories within the EU at an average concentration of 2.0 ng mL-1. The occurrence of prednisolone residues together with increased levels of hydrocortisone and cortisone in urine and tissue samples of untreated animals seems to demonstrate that traces of this steroid can be produced endogenously during stressful situations. Therefore, the endogenous origin of prednisolone makes difficult to correlate positive samples to a potential illicit treatment. An experimental study was developed to investigate the presence of natural and synthetic glucocorticoids and to evaluate levels of excreted prednisolone following growth-promoting treatments. Urine samples from calves undergone oral treatment with prednisolone, alone and in association with dexamethasone, were analyzed by a LC-MS/MS method, validated according to the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. We also investigated if urinary free 6β-hydroxyhydrocortisone/hydrocortisone ratio could be a reliable biomarker of illicit treatment with prednisolone and dexamethasone in calves. Our data revealed that urinary levels of prednisolone after both oral prednisolone treatments, never exceeded the value of 1.1 ng mL-1. Similar prednisolone levels were found in urine samples of untreated calves. Moreover the presence of 6β-hydroxyhydrocortisone below the CCα value made possible to estimate the 6β-hydroxyhydrocortisone/hydrocortisone ratio only in a very limited number of samples. Obtained data suggest that further criteria have to be considered to allow correct decisions about the urinary presence of prednisolone during control activities. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Prion protein (PrP) is present at extremely low levels in the blood of animals and its detection is complicated by the poor sensitivity of current standard methodologies. Interesting results have been obtained with recent advanced technologies that are able to detect minute amounts of the pathological PrP (PrP Sc ), but their efficiency is reduced by various factors present in blood. In this study, we were able to extract cellular PrP (PrP C ) from plasma-derived exosomes by a simple, fast method without the use of differential ultracentrifugation and to visualize it by Western blotting, reducing the presence of most plasma proteins. This result confirms that blood is capable of releasing PrP in association with exosomes and could be useful to better study its role in the pathogenesis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={Interferons (IFNs) play a crucial role in the host's immune response and other homeostatic control actions. Three IFN types and several IFN families within the types allow for a plethora of regulatory actions. The number of distinct IFN molecules is highest among type I IFNs and, in particular, within the IFN-α family. In pigs, there are 17 IFN-α subtypes with different antiviral activities and different expression profiles; however, no data are available about biological properties other than the antiviral effector activities. Therefore, 16 porcine IFN-α genes were cloned, expressed in mammalian Chinese hamster ovary cells, and characterized for antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and MHC-modulating activities at a pre-established level of 10 IU/mL. Antiviral activity: IFN-α2, -α5, -α9, and -α10 showed the highest level of activity in a pseudorabies virus yield reduction assay. On the contrary, little, if any, activity was shown by IFN-α3, -α7, -α13, -α4, and -α15. Anti-inflammatory activity: With the exception of IFNs-α2, -α7, -α9, and -α11, all IFN-α subtypes had significant anti-inflammatory control activity in an interleukin-8 (IL-8) yield reduction assay. Gene expression analyses showed that some IFN-α subtypes can significantly downregulate the expression of IL-8, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), IL-6, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), βD1, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-kB) genes, while maintaining or upregulating the expression of βD4. Immunomodulation: A significant upregulation of class I and/or class II MHC was induced by all the IFNs under study, with the exception of IFNs-α11, -α15, and -α16, which instead significantly downregulated class I MHC. Our results indicate that gene duplications in the porcine IFN-α family underlie diverse effector and regulatory activities, being therefore instrumental in host survival and environmental adaptation. This role of IFN-α could be founded on fine-tuning and regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory control actions after exposure to both infectious and noninfectious environmental stressors. © 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract={Following the detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ST398 in food-producing animals, both livestock and wildlife, and derived products, are considered potential sources of MRSA in humans. There is a paucity of data on MRSA in foods in Italy, and the data regarding wild animals are particularly scarce. A total of 2162 food samples collected during official monitoring activities in 2008 were analyzed for the detection of S.aureus. Also, samples from 1365 wild animals collected by the National Reference Center for Wild Animal Diseases in 2003-2009 were subjected to anatomopathological examination. S.aureus isolates were processed for phenotypic and molecular methicillin resistance determinations.S.aureus was found in 2.0% of wild animal carcasses and in 3.2% of wild boar lymph nodes: none showed methicillin resistance. The prevalence of S.aureus in food was 17.1%. Two MRSA strains, both from bulk tank milk (prevalence 0.77%) were isolated: the strains were resistant to tetracycline, had spa-type t899, and were negative for the Panton-Valentine leukocidin gene. The low prevalence of MRSA suggests that the risk of transmission to humans via food is limited. However, attention should be paid to the cattle food chain, which may be a potential route of transmission of LA-MRSA. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Under current European Union legislation the use of anabolic steroids in food-producing livestock is banned because of their long-term adverse effects on human health. We examined the expression profile of the immunohistochemical marker progesterone receptor in veal calves’ sex accessory glands following experimental administration of anabolic compounds. The aim was to confirm the accuracy of the immunohistochemical approach in the detection of the overexpression of the progesterone receptor induced by the administration of sexual steroids at low levels (17β-estradiol and nandrolone alone or in combination). A total of 217 male veal calves were randomly divided into four groups: group A (104 calves) treated with 17β-estradiol (5 mg/ head; 4 weekly injections); group B (20 calves) treated with nandrolone (50 mg/head; 4 weekly injections); group C (20 calves) treated with the association of the two steroids (5 mg estradiol + 50 mg nandrolone; 4 weekly injections); and group K (73 calves) kept as a control. All the sexual accessory glands were collected at the slaughterhouse (15 days after the last administration) and subjected to immunohistochemical staining with anti-progesterone receptor antibody. All the calves treated with 17β-estradiol alone or in association with nandrolone (groups A and C) showed strong positivity, while nandrolone-treated calves and controls (groups B and K) gave negative results to the immunohistochemical investigation. The statistical analysis showed that the progesterone receptor is a significant predictor of 17β-estradiol treatment alone or in association with nandrolone (p < 0.001): the immunohistochemical study resulted in 100% sensitivity (CI = 95%: 97.1–100%) and specificity (CI = 95%: 95.1–100%) for prostate and 99% sensitivity (CI = 95%: 95.6–100%) and 100% specificity (CI = 95%: 95.1–100%) for bulbo-urethral glands. The data confirm that this innovative biological approach offers a reliable tool to enhance the efficacy of the histological test to detect illegal treatments with estrogens alone or in association with androgens. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Mass stranding of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) is a rare event in the Mediterranean Sea. In September 2014, a pod of seven sperm whales became stranded along the Adriatic coast of Southern Italy. This is the seventh occurrence of this type since 1555 in this sea basin.Total concentrations of mercury (T-Hg), methylmercury (MeHg) and selenium (Se) were measured from brain, muscle, liver and kidney of three female sperm whales, which died in this event.Analyses showed considerable, age-dependent variations in Hg and Se concentrations in the different organs. The contamination levels of T-Hg in the liver (up to 200mgkg-1) and brain (up to 21mgkg-1) samples were markedly higher than those in the kidney and muscle samples. The liver and brain also showed the highest Se levels. Se:Hg molar ratios ≥1 were observed in all the organs of the three sperm whales, suggesting that Se could protect the animals from Hg toxicity. The risk of Hg-associated neurotoxicity was assessed by comparing our values to thresholds set for neurotoxicity in mammals, and the role of Se in the detoxification process of T-Hg/MeHg is discussed herein. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Bovine papillomaviruses (BPVs) are group of worldwide-spread DNA virus that infect primarily cattle determining diseases of considerable economic relevance. Recently, research on BPVs, received a great impulse owing to the development of specific biomolecular analysis, mostly based on L1 gene sequencing, that resulted in the identification of new viral types. This work is aimed at the identification and molecular and histopathological characterization of BPVs circulating in North West Italy, one of the main national cattle breeding areas.In this study, 71 bioptic specimens were submitted both to histological examination and to PCR and sequencing analysis. Histopathology revealed various lesion types; however, no connections were demonstrated between involved viral types and histopathological findings. BPV DNA was demonstrated in all the analyzed samples and several viral types were detected. Particularly, molecular investigations revealed a broad diffusion of highly pathogenic BPV1 and 2 Deltapapillomavirus and presence of BPV3 and 9 Xipapillomavirus. Two cases of co-infection were also demonstrated. Phylogenetic analysis revealed presence of different clusters and therefore a noteworthy genetic variety among the analyzed viral types.This study provides information on the main BPVs types in North West Italy and our results demonstrate the complexity of viral epidemiology which is characterized by circulation of multiple viral types even inside single herds. Knowledge of the prevalence and of the variety of BPVs is a milestone for the development of appropriate prophylactic and therapeutic measures. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Meat products from HEV-infected reservoir animal species are capable of transmitting HEV to humans and represent a public health concern. Human HEV cases have been linked to the consumption of raw or undercooked pig liver sausages, pork, and game meats, such as wild boars and deer worldwide. Direct exposure to swine or wild game species might also represent a source of HEV transmission especially for veterinarians, hunters, or butchers. A limited amount of data is available on HEV prevalence in wild boars in Italy and no data are available for other wild game species intended for human consumption. In this study, the circulation of HEV in four different animal species hunted in north-western Italy was evaluated to gain insight into the infection levels and the genetic diversity of the virus in such animal populations. Liver samples of 372 wild boars, 30 roe deer, 47 European hares and 38 coypus were analyzed for HEV RNA by real-time RT-PCR; positive samples were then sequenced and submitted to phylogenetic analysis. HEV RNA was detected in the livers of 7/372 (1.9 %) wild boars tested, while no sample was positive for roe deer, European hare, and coypu. Phylogenetic analysis showed that wild boar HEV sequences belonged to HEV subtypes 3e, 3c, and 3f. Our results indicate that HEV is circulating only in wild boar among the considered game species in north-western Italy and suggest a potential zoonotic risk related to handling and/or consumption of raw or undercooked meat and products made of the liver from this species. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Transition metals are cofactors for a wide range of vital enzymes and are directly or indirectly involved in the response against reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can damage cellular components. Their altered homeostasis has been studied in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but no data are available on rarer conditions. We aimed at studying the role of essential trace elements in ataxia telangiectasia (A-T), a rare form of pediatric autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia with altered antioxidant response. We found an increased level of copper (Cu, p = 0.0002) and a reduced level of zinc (Zn, p = 0.0002) in the blood of patients (n. 16) compared to controls, using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Other trace elements involved in the oxidative stress response, such as manganese (Mn) and selenium (Se), were unaltered. Cu/Zn-dependent superoxide dismutase (SOD1) was shown to have a 30% reduction in gene expression and 40% reduction in enzyme activity upon analysis of lymphoblastoid cell lines of patients (Student's t-test, p = 0.0075). We also found a 30% reduction of Mn-SOD (SOD2; Student's t-test, p = 0.02), probably due to a feedback regulatory loop between the two enzymes. The expression of antioxidant enzymes, such as erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase (GPX1), and SOD2 was unaltered, whereas catalase (CAT) was increased in A-T cells, both at the mRNA level and in terms of enzyme activity (~ 25%). Enhanced CAT expression can be attributed to the high ROS status, which induces CAT transcription. These results suggest that alterations in essential trace elements and their related enzymes may play a role in the pathogenesis of A-T, although we cannot conclude if altered homeostasis is a direct effect of A-T mutated genes (ATM). Altered homeostasis of trace elements may be more prevalent in neurodegenerative diseases than previously thought, and it may represent both a biomarker and a generic therapeutic target for different disorders with the common theme of altered antioxidant enzyme responses associated with an unbalance of metals. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..},

abstract={PCDD/Fs and PCBs are environmentally persistent substances that have been associated with adverse effects on human health. Contamination of soils, animal feed and pastures leads to their bioaccumulation of in food products of animal origin, which are considered the major source of intake of these contaminants in humans. We analyzed eggs from free-range hens, sampled from small farms, located within a distance of 4.5 km from a secondary aluminum smelter in Northern Italy. The concentrations of PCDD/Fs, DL-PCBs and NDL-PCBs were higher in eggs from locations close to the plant, and strongly exceeded the limits set by EU Regulation 1259/2011 (2.5 pg WHO TEQ fat g-1 for PCDD/Fs, 5.0 pg WHO TEQ g-1 for PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs L, 40 ng g-1 for NDL-PCBs).

abstract={In order to evaluate sheep as experimental model to test the efficacy of HoBi-like pestivirus vaccines for cattle, 10 sheep at different stages of pregnancy (30 or 50 days) were experimentally infected with the Italian prototype isolate Italy-1/10-1. Irrespective of the stage of pregnancy, virus inoculation resulted in reproductive failures, consisting of abortion, stillbirths or birth of weak or persistently infected (PI) lambs. Aborted fetuses, stillborn and dead lambs displayed extensive histopathological changes, consisting of hemorrhages, congestion and mononuclear infiltration in major organs. Pestiviral antigens were detected by immunohistochemistry in most tissues with remarkable signals in lungs and kidneys. PI lambs were constantly viremic, shed the virus through the nasal secretions and feces and, in all cases but one, did not have detectable HoBi-like pestivirus antibodies before the assumption of colostrum. The single seropositive infected lamb showed low-titer viremia and viral shedding that ceased only several weeks after the 3-month observation period. The study proves that sheep are susceptible to the reproduction failures caused by HoBi-like pestivirus infection and can serve as a suitable model for the evaluation of the fetal protection induced by homologous experimental vaccines. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract={Perfluoroalkylated substances (PFASs) are highly fluorinated aliphatic compounds with high thermal and chemical stability, used in a range of industrial applications. Extensive screening analyses in biota samples from all over the world have shown the bioaccumulation of PFAS into higher trophic levels in the food chain. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluoroctanoic acid (PFOA) are potential reproductive and developmental toxicants and are considered to be emerging endocrine disrupters. Ingestion of fish and other seafood is considered the main source of exposure of these contaminants. Here, we quantified PFOS and PFOA by LC-MS/MS in muscle samples of European perch from Lake Varese, Italy. PFOS was detected in all samples with concentrations of up to 17.2 ng g−1. Although the reported values were lower than the recommended total daily intake (TDI) proposed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), fish from Lake Varese may be a significant source of dietary PFOS exposure. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={In September 2014, a pod of seven sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) was stranded along the Adriatic coast of Southern Italy. Concentrations of 20 essential and non-essential trace elements were quantified in the brain, muscle, liver and kidneys of three female sperm whales, which died in this event. The essential elements copper, iron, manganese and zinc showed low ranges of variability, suggesting a homeostatic physiological control, while selenium concentrations were associated with age. Molybdenum, nickel and chromium showed low ranges of concentrations and no evidence of preferential accumulation in selected organs. Very low concentrations of the non-essential elements cadmium, lead, tin and vanadium were detected in all tissues, suggesting a minor impact of these pollutants on the sperm whale populations of the Mediterranean Sea. Aluminum was revealed to have relatively high concentrations, together with a high variability between tissues and individuals, reaching the highest values in the kidneys and muscle of the oldest female, which was pregnant; the rare earth elements - lanthanum and cerium - were also detected in the kidneys of this female, indicating that pregnancy probably influenced metal concentrations in body tissues. ©2015 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Classical bovine spongiform encephalopathy (c-BSE) is the only animal prion disease reputed to be zoonotic, causing variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in humans and having guided protective measures for animal and human health against animal prion diseases. Recently, partial transmissions to humanized mice showed that the zoonotic potential of scrapie might be similar to c-BSE. We here report the direct transmission of a natural classical scrapie isolate to cynomolgus macaque, a highly relevant model for human prion diseases, after a 10-year silent incubation period, with features similar to those reported for human cases of sporadic CJD. Scrapie is thus actually transmissible to primates with incubation periods compatible with their life expectancy, although fourfold longer than BSE. Long-term experimental transmission studies are necessary to better assess the zoonotic potential of other prion diseases with high prevalence, notably Chronic Wasting Disease of deer and elk and atypical/Nor98 scrapie.},

abstract={In developed countries, typhoid fever is often associated with persons who travel to endemic areas or immigrate from them. Typhoid fever is a systemic infection caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. Because of the emergence of antimicrobial resistance to standard first-line drugs, fluoroquinolones are the drugs of choice. Resistance to ciprofloxacin by this Salmonella serovar represents an emerging public health issue. Two S. enterica ser. Typhi strains resistant to ciprofloxacin (CIP) were reported to the Italian surveillance system for foodborne and waterborne diseases (EnterNet-Italia) in 2013. The strains were isolated from two Italian tourists upon their arrival from India. A retrospective analysis of 17 other S. enterica ser. Typhi strains isolated in Italy during 2011-2013 was performed to determine their resistance to CIP. For this purpose, we assayed for susceptibility to antimicrobial agents and conducted PCR and nucleotide sequence analyses. Moreover, all strains were typed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to evaluate possible clonal relationships. Sixty-eight percent of the S. enterica ser. Typhi strains were resistant to CIP (MICs, 0.125-16 mg/L), and all isolates were negative for determinants of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance. Analysis of sequences encoding DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV subunits revealed mutations in gyrA, gyrB, and parC. Thirteen different clonal groups were detected, and the two CIP-resistant strains isolated from the individuals who visited India exhibited the same PFGE pattern. Because of these findings, the emergence of CIPresistant S. enterica ser. Typhi isolates in Italy deserves attention, and monitoring antibiotic susceptibility is important for efficiently managing cases of typhoid fever. © 2015 García-Fernández et al.

abstract={Non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (NDL-PCBs) contribute to the dietary intake of total PCBs. They are consumed via ingestion of contaminated fish and fishery products. Thus, it is important to quantify their levels in aquatic organisms in order to evaluate the risks associated with fish consumption by humans. In 2013, an advisory against consumption of fish from the River Roya (IT) was disseminated after NDL PCBs were found to exceed maximum levels set by EU Regulations. We investigated the presence of NDL PCBs in eel, trout and barbel from the River Roya. We found concentrations in the range of 9.2-27.6 ng g- 1 ww in barbel, 9.2-97.0 ng g-1 ww in trout and 9.0-239.5 ng g-1 ww in eel. The distribution of congeners among different species did not show significant variations and was characterized by a higher proportion of 153, 138 and 180 congeners, according to their high resistance to metabolic degradation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered the cell subpopulation responsible for breast cancer (BC) initiation, growth, and relapse. CSCs are identified as self-renewing and tumor-initiating cells, conferring resistance to chemo- and radio-therapy to several neoplasias. Nowadays, th (about 10mM)e pharmacological targeting of CSCs is considered an ineludible therapeutic goal. The antidiabetic drug metformin was reported to suppress in vitro and in vivo CSC survival in different tumors and, in particular, in BC preclinical models. However, few studies are available on primary CSC cultures derived from human postsurgical BC samples, likely because of the limited amount of tissue available after surgery. In this context, comparative oncology is acquiring a relevant role in cancer research, allowing the analysis of larger samples from spontaneous pet tumors that represent optimal models for human cancer. Methods: Isolation of primary canine mammary carcinoma (CMC) cells and enrichment in stem-like cell was carried out from fresh tumor specimens by culturing cells in stem-permissive conditions. Phenotypic and functional characterization of CMC-derived stem cells was performed in vitro, by assessment of self-renewal, long-lasting proliferation, marker expression, and drug sensitivity, and in vivo, by tumorigenicity experiments. Corresponding cultures of differentiated CMC cells were used as internal reference. Metformin efficacy on CMC stem cell viability was analyzed both in vitro and in vivo. Results: We identified a subpopulation of CMC cells showing human breast CSC features, including expression of specific markers (i.e. CD44, CXCR4), growth as mammospheres, and tumor-initiation in mice. These cells show resistance to doxorubicin but were highly sensitive to metformin in vitro. Finally, in vivo metformin administration significantly impaired CMC growth in NOD-SCID mice, associated with a significant depletion of CSCs. Conclusions: Similarly to the human counterpart, CMCs contain stem-like subpopulations representing, in a comparative oncology context, a valuable translational model for human BC, and, in particular, to predict the efficacy of antitumor drugs. Moreover, metformin represents a potential CSC-selective drug for BC, as effective (neo-)adjuvant therapy to eradicate CSC in mammary carcinomas of humans and animals. © Barbieri et al.; licensee BioMed Central.},

abstract={There is a growing interest in donkey's milk as food for sensitive consumers, such as infants with cow's milk protein allergy and elderly people. The aim of this study was to carry out a survey on the dairy donkeys farming in Piedmont, Italy. The research was conducted in order to analyze the farm characteristics as well as the chemical and microbiological quality of milk. All the farms were small-sized, family-run, and, in most cases, animals were farmed semi-extensively. The donkey milk from Piedmont farms was characterized by a protein content around 1.5g/100mL and a fat content lower than 0.1g/100mL. Lysozyme activity was considerably higher than that reported in raw cow milk. The milk microbiological profile greatly differed among the farms. Milk sampled in the farm that performed hand milking showed total viable counts significantly lower than milk collected in the farms equipped with automatic milking. Samples were tested for several pathogens and negative results were observed, except for the detection of Bacillus cereus in one sample. The survey provided useful data for the laying down of recent regional regulation for the production and commercialization of donkey's milk. The results of the survey indicate that further research is needed in order to define the best management and nutritional strategies for the improvement of the quali-quantitative production of dairy donkeys. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Legislation introduced under European Commission Regulation (EC) n° 2073/2005 and later amendments (Reg. 1441/2007/EC, Reg. 365/2010/EC, Reg. 1089/2011/EC, Reg. 209/2013/EC) mandates that food business operators carry out microbiological analyses on meat carcass surfaces after slaughter procedures as part of hygiene monitoring of production. Besides setting forth general rules for sampling and sample preparation, Regulation EC 2073/2005 requires that operators comply with ISO 17604, which lists destructive and non-destructive sampling methods, selection of sampling sites, and rules for sample storage and transport.This study compares the effectiveness of destructive (excision) and non-destructive (sponge and wet-dry swabbing) methods for the recovery of total viable count (TVC) and Enterobacteriaceae on carcass surfaces. To do this, we pooled samples collected from carcasses of four animal species (cattle, n=120; pigs, n=130; horses, n=84; and small ruminants [sheep and goats], n=121). TVC and Enterobacteriaceae were enumerated and compared for each sampling method. Microbiological analyses were performed according to ISO 4833:2003 for TVC and ISO 21528:2004 for Enterobacteriaceae. The effectiveness of the sampling methods was analyzed by comparing the differences between the median of colony forming units per square centimeter (CFU/cm2) for TVC and Enterobacteriaceae recovered by each method. Non-parametric analysis of variance for repeated measures was applied for each species separately.Excision was the most effective method. The relationship between the CFU recovered by swabbing, by sponge, and by excision, for all species, was generally better than 1:5. This is in contrast with the Italian Ministry of Health Memorandum (23 December 2002), which states that non-destructive methods recover 20% of the destructive method. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The diagnosis of astroblastoma is based on a typical histological aspect with perivascular distribution of cells sending cytoplasmic extensions to the vessels and vascular hyalinization. These criteria are useful for standardizing the identification of the tumor, but, in spite of this, there are discrepancies in the literature concerning the age distribution and the benign or malignant nature of the tumor. Three cases are discussed in this study: Case 1 was a typical high-grade astroblastoma; Case 2 was an oligodendroglioma at the first intervention and an oligoastrocytoma at the second intervention with typical perivascular arrangements in the astrocytic component; Case 3 was a gemistocytic glioma with malignant features and typical perivascular arrangements. Genetic analysis showed genetic alterations that are typical of gliomas of all malignancy grades. Using the neurosphere assay, neurospheres and adherent cells were found to have developed in Case 1, while adherent cells only developed in Case 2, in line with the stemness potential of the tumors. The cases are discussed in relation to their diagnostic assessment as astroblastoma, and it is hypothesized that the typical perivascular distribution of cells may not indicate a separate and unique tumor entity, but may be a peculiarity that can be acquired by astrocytic gliomas when an unknown cause from the tumor microenvironment influences the relationship between vessels and tumor cells. © 2015 Mellai et al.},

abstract={Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) is an important cytokine that plays a crucial role in the balance between normal and pathological immune response. Defect of IFN-γ can give a predisposition to infectious disease, autoimmune pathologies and tumours. Different polymorphisms in this gene have been described, in particular the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). +. 874. *. T/A that may affect IFN-γ gene expression. Several techniques can be used for the detection of SNPs. In this work two PCR Real Time assays were developed, an Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS) and a Mismatch Amplification Mutation Assay (MAMA). Twenty-seven samples from patients (tonsillectomy) and 85 from donor's blood bank were considered. As a result, 78/85 controls (91.7%) and 25/27 patients (92.6%) were heterozygosis, considering the ARMS-PCR; 55/85 (64.7%) and 14/27 (51.9%) were heterozygosis using MAMA-PCR assay. Fourteen of 85 (16.5%) and 8/27 (29.6%) were homozygosis A, 16/85 (18.8%) and 5/27 (18.5%) presented homozygosis T, taking into account the MAMA-PCR. There are statistically difference between the two assay with p<. 0.0001 at Chi-square test. Our preliminary data suggest that tonsillectomy patients had a statistical trend to possess the low IFN-γ polymorphism when compared with control subject (. p=. 0.3) but is not statistically significant. In conclusion the Real time MAMA-PCR assay has several advantages over other SNP identification techniques such as rapidity, reliability, easily to perform in one working day and applicable in clinical molecular diagnostic laboratories, although sequencing remains the gold standard. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Challenges to testing for the illicit use of anabolic substances in meat-producing animals stem from the production of new synthetic compounds and the administration of low-dose cocktails to circumvent detection by the surveillance schemes of European Union member states. This work evaluated for the first time GR-CALUX, a highly sensitive reporter gene assay, as a screening tool for the detection of synthetic glucocorticoids in bovine urine. In order to verify the effect of natural corticosteroids on the method, the bioassay was tested first using blank urine samples collected at the farm and the slaughterhouse. Next, the dose–response curves were measured for the most commonly used synthetic glucocorticoids. The bioassay’s ability to detect them in spiked and incurred samples of bovine urine was then evaluated. Finally, its performance was compared against a commercially available ELISA kit ordinarily used in screening activities. GR-CALUX performance did not appear to be influenced by physiological levels of endogenous corticosteroids in the farm samples, whereas an increase in these hormones might invalidate the analysis in samples obtained at the slaughterhouse. Using pure compounds, GR-CALUX showed a high sensitivity toward the synthetic glucocorticosteroids tested in order of relative potencies: flumethasone ≫ dexamethasone > betamethasone > methylprednisolone > prednisolone. As expected, the bioassay failed to detect the prohormone prednisone. The results obtained from analysis of the spiked and incurred specimens reproduced those of the blank samples and the pure compounds. GR-CALUX is a promising screening tool for the detection of illicit treatments in meat-producing bovines.

abstract={In recent years, the alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) population of the Province of Imperia, NW Italy, underwent sanitary monitoring. The monitoring plan was set up to investigate the effects of coexistence between free-range livestock and wildlife in the area, at the provincial and regional scale. Alpine chamois in the Ligurian Alps represents the westernmost and southernmost population of this species in the Alps, demographically distinct from the others and of particular interest from an ecological point of view, as its habitat is influenced by the Mediterranean climate. Our study refers to the results of the sanitary monitoring in the period 2002-2012, based on descriptive epidemiology (distribution of pathologies by place, time and features of the affected individuals).},

In 2012 the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health Safety (ANSES) published a pilot project with an active epidemiological surveillance protocol for honeybee colony mortality in 17 European member states, including Italy. Data for North Western Italy (NWI) were collected and analysed in order to study colonies mortality and apiary management. The colony mortality rate in NWI amounted to 5.8 (CI95% 3.8-7.8). Every region presented an over winter colony mortality rate: 6.2% in Liguria, 3.2% in Piedmont and 11.8% in Valle d'Aosta, respectively. The difference between regions was not statistically significant (χ2: 4.54, p = 0.10). At apiarian level, the highest mortality rate was observed in the spring, as 41.6% of observed apiaries showed at least one dead colony, while in the summer the apiaries with at least one dead colony were only 12.5%. The difference was statistically significant (McNemar test: 3.90 p = 0.0482). No statistically significant association was found between bee colony mortality rate and various factors considered in the questionnaire.},

abstract={Although rare in developed countries, most acquired human cases of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection are associated with travel to developing countries where HEV is endemic. Increasingly, however, sporadic, non-travel-related HEV cases have been reported in developed countries. In Italy, only two studies to date have investigated the presence of HEV in wild boars. Here, we report a serological and virological survey of HEV in wild boar populations in northwestern Italy. During the hunting season, 594 serum and 320 liver samples were collected and screened for antibodies to HEV and HEV RNA. Overall, the seroprevalence was 4.9 %, and HEV RNA was detected in 12 liver samples (p = 3.7 %). No serum samples tested positive for HEV RNA. Phylogenetic analysis of the ORF2 region revealed that the isolates clustered within genotype 3, subtypes 3e and 3f, and were closely related to HEV strains previously detected in domestic pigs farmed in the same geographic area. Although the routes of viral transmission are still poorly understood, our data show that HEV genotypes 3e and 3f circulate in wild boars in northwestern Italy. Also, they provide evidence that autochthonous HEV infections in Italy could also be linked to wild boar populations, suggesting an increased risk for domestically acquired HEV infection in humans through wild animals. The HEV sequences determined in this study may be useful for comparing present and future human isolates to identify transmission events between wild boar, humans, and farmed pigs. Similarly to other more commonly known zoonotic agents, HEV should be included in national or regional disease surveillance programs for wild animals. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Wien.},

abstract={The study of mercury and selenium bioaccumulation in fish is crucially important for evaluating the extent of contamination in freshwater environments, and the possible health risk posed for humans when the antagonistic interactions of these two elements are considered. Several factors affect the risk of mercury intake from fish consumption, including mercury levels, human consumption patterns, and sensitive populations (e.g., pregnant women, foetuses, young children and unknown genetic factors). The protective effects of selenium on mercury toxicity have been extensively publicised in recent years, particularly targeting fish consumers. In this study, mercury (Hg) and selenium (Se) concentrations were determined in the muscle of European catfish (Silurus glanis) collected from North Italian Rivers. Differences in mercury and selenium levels, as a function of size, gender and location were investigated. Hg was strongly related to length, gender and location, while Se levels are not dependent on fish size or location. The mean Se/Hg molar ratio was strongly affected by location, and significantly related to length and age. Selenium was in molar excess of mercury in all sites, with a rank order of mean Se/Hg molar ratio of the Parma River (2.55) >. Po River (1.71) >. Tanaro River (1.66) >. Bormida River (1.36).However, in 37% of analyzed samples, Hg exceeded the maximum level set by 1881/2006/EC and 629/2008/EC in fish muscle. The molar ratio of Se/Hg was <1 only in the presence of significantly high Hg levels (>0.5. mg/kg), and therefore the mean molar ratio cannot be considered as a safety criterion in top predator fish. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this regard, the following parameters were determined: detection capability (CCβ), specificity and ruggedness. The resulted CCβ values were <1ppm for both molecules and no interferences from matrix effects were observed. Slight variations of some critical factors in the sample pre-treatment and clean up were deliberately introduced for ruggedness evaluation and they did not result in any negative effect on the detection of virginiamycin, while ruggedness evaluation on the detection of bacitracin showed some critical factors.

abstract={Objective: Evaluation of hemostasis using thromboelastometry in dogs with leishmaniasis before and after treatment. Design: Longitudinal observational study. Setting: University veterinary teaching hospital. Animals: Eighty-four adult, client-owned dogs. Measurements and Main Results: Whole blood samples for the coagulation profile were collected from symptomatic dogs with leishmaniasis (group S), asymptomatic dogs with leishmaniasis after treatment (group T), and a control group of healthy dogs (group H). Hemostasis was evaluated by means of standard coagulation profile (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen) and by thromboelastometry (ROTEM). Prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were within the upper reference range in all 3 groups. Comparison of the ROTEM variables between the 3 groups showed statistically significant differences between group S versus groups T and H, but remaining within the reference ranges. Statistically significant differences in hematocrit and fibrinogen concentrations were noted between groups (group S vs. H: hematocrit P = 0.001, fibrinogen P = 0.002; Group S vs. T: hematocrit P = 0.001, fibrinogen P = 0.001). These variations have interfered with some parameters of the ROTEM profile. Conclusions: This study showed normal standard coagulation profiles in all 3 groups evaluated. The ROTEM results did not fall outside of the maximum values of the reference ranges. © Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society 2015.},

abstract={Background: Large animals have a relatively high seizure threshold, and in most cases seizures are acquired. No published case series have described this syndrome in cattle. Objectives: To describe clinical findings and outcomes in cattle referred to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the University of Turin (Italy) because of seizures. Animals: Client-owned cattle with documented evidence of seizures. Methods: Medical records of cattle with episodes of seizures reported between January 2002 and February 2014 were reviewed. Evidence of seizures was identified based on the evaluation of seizure episodes by the referring veterinarian or 1 of the authors. Animals were recruited if physical and neurologic examinations were performed and if diagnostic laboratory test results were available. Results: Forty-three of 49 cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 8 months. Thirty-one animals were male and 12 were female. Piedmontese breed accounted for 39/43 (91%) animals. Seizures were etiologically classified as reactive in 30 patients (70%) and secondary or structural in 13 (30%). Thirty-six animals survived, 2 died naturally, and 5 were euthanized for reasons of animal welfare. The definitive cause of reactive seizures was diagnosed as hypomagnesemia (n = 2), hypocalcemia (n = 12), and hypomagnesemia-hypocalcemia (n = 16). The cause of structural seizures was diagnosed as cerebrocortical necrosis (n = 8), inflammatory diseases (n = 4), and lead (Pb) intoxication (n = 1). Conclusion and Clinical Importance: The study results indicate that seizures largely are reported in beef cattle and that the cause can be identified and successfully treated in most cases. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={The knowledge of the size and demographic structure of animal populations is a necessary prerequisite for any population-based epidemiological study, especially to ascertain and interpret prevalence data, to implement surveillance plans in controlling zoonotic diseases and, moreover, to provide accurate estimates of tumours incidence data obtained by population-based registries. The main purpose of this study was to provide an accurate estimate of the size and structure of the canine population in Veneto region (north-eastern Italy), using the Lincoln-Petersen version of the capture-recapture methodology. The Regional Canine Demographic Registry (BAC) and a sample survey of households of Veneto Region were the capture and recapture sources, respectively. The secondary purpose was to estimate the size and structure of the feline population in the same region, using the same survey applied for dog population. A sample of 2465 randomly selected households was drawn and submitted to a questionnaire using the CATI technique, in order to obtain information about the ownership of dogs and cats. If the dog was declared to be identified, owner's information was used to recapture the dog in the BAC. The study was conducted in Veneto Region during 2011, when the dog population recorded in the BAC was 605,537. Overall, 616 households declared to possess at least one dog (25%), with a total of 805 dogs and an average per household of 1.3. The capture-recapture analysis showed that 574 dogs (71.3%, 95% CI: 68.04-74.40%) had been recaptured in both sources, providing a dog population estimate of 849,229 (95% CI: 814,747-889,394), 40% higher than that registered in the BAC. Concerning cats, 455 of 2465 (18%, 95% CI: 17-20%) households declared to possess at least one cat at the time of the telephone interview, with a total of 816 cats. The mean number of cats per household was equal to 1.8, providing an estimate of the cat population in Veneto region equal to 663,433 (95% CI: 626,585-737,159). The estimate of the size and structure of owned canine and feline populations in Veneto region provide useful data to perform epidemiological studies and monitoring plans in this area. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Objective: To evaluate blood coagulation using thromboelastometry in dogs following orthopedic surgery. Design: Longitudinal observational study. Setting: University veterinary teaching hospital. Animals: Thirty-four adult client-owned dogs. Measurements and Main Results: Dogs undergoing elective or emergency orthopedic surgery had whole blood collected before (T0), at 24 hours (T1), and 1 week (T2) after surgery. Whole blood from each dog was collected by jugular venipuncture using a 20-Ga needle and minimum venous stasis. The blood was placed into tubes containing 3.8% trisodium citrate (1 part citrate: 9 parts blood) and rested at 37°C. Coagulation was evaluated by means of thromboelastometry using the in-TEM, ex-TEM, and fib-TEM assays. Statistically significant increases (P < 0.05) in maximum clot firmness (MCF) from T0 to T1 in the in-TEM and fib-TEM profiles (both P = 0.0001), from T0 to T2 in the in-TEM, ex-TEM, and fib-TEM profiles (P = 0.012, P = 0.037, and P = 0.0001, respectively), and from T1 to T2 in the fib-TEM profile (P = 0.039) were noted. The α angle increased from T0 to T2 in the in-TEM and ex-TEM profiles (P = 0.019 and P = 0.036, respectively). All results were, however, within the institutional reference ranges. Conclusions: In this study, unlike the hypercoagulability observed in human orthopedic patients, a hypercoagulable state as measured by thromboelastometry did not develop in dogs following orthopedic surgery. © Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society 2015.},

abstract={The aim of this work was to check the efficacy of bovine lactoferrin hydrolyzed by pepsin (LFH) to prevent blue discoloration of Mozzarella cheese delaying the growth of the related spoilage bacteria. Among 64 Pseudomonas fluorescens strains, isolated from 105 Mozzarella samples, only ten developed blue discoloration in cold-stored Mozzarella cheese slices. When Mozzarella cheese samples from dairy were treated with LFH and inoculated with a selected P.fluorescens strain, no pigmentation and changes in casein profiles were found up to 14 days of cold storage. In addition, starting from day 5, the count of P.fluorescens spoiling strain was steadily ca. one log cycle lower than that of LFH-free samples. ESI-Orbitrap-based mass spectrometry analyses allowed to reveal the pigment leucoindigoidine only in the blue LFH-free cheese samples indicating that this compound could be considered a chemical marker of this alteration. For the first time, an innovative mild approach, based on the antimicrobial activity of milk protein hydrolysates, for counteracting blue Mozzarella event and controlling psychrotrophic pigmenting pseudomonads, is here reported. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={A trial has been performed to evaluate the effects of dietary verbascoside (VB) on the growth performance, blood traits, meat quality and histological features of broiler chickens. Seventy-two male broiler chickens (Ross 708) were divided into three experimental groups (8 replicates): a control group (C; basal diet), a low VB group (LVB; basal diet+2.5 mg VB/kg feed) and a high VB group (HVB; basal diet+5.0 mg VB/kg feed). The animals were kept in cages, three birds per cage. The trial lasted 35 days. Growth performance and carcass yield were recorded. Blood samples were collected at day 35 in order to evaluate the blood, serum and plasma parameters. As a result of this study, growth and slaughter performances were not affected by the dietary treatments. The LVB and HVB groups showed significantly lower concentrations of total protein (P=0.000), albumin (P=0.000), <-globulin (P=0.001) and â-globulin (P=0.023) than C group. The heterophil to lymphocyte ratio was higher in HVB group than in LVB and C groups (P=0.005). The thiobarbituric acid reactive substances results indicated lower lipid oxidation in the LVB group than in C group. The most relevant histological feature was the lymphoid depletion observed in the thymus and bursa of Fabricius in LVB and HVB. Other studies are still needed to identify the optimal dosage and exposure time of VB dietary supplementation and to further investigate the effects of VB on lymphoid tissue as well as to establish the VB antioxidant effect on broiler chickens. © Copyright M.

abstract={The aim of the study was to evaluate markers of the acute phase response (APR) in eventing horses by measuring acute phase proteins (APP) (haptoglobin, Hp, and serum amyloid A, SAA), lysozyme, protein adducts such as pentosidine-like adducts (PENT), malondialdehyde adducts (MDA), hydroxynonenal adducts (HNE) and total advanced glycation/glycoxidation end products (AGEs), complete blood count and lymphocyte subpopulations (CD4+, CD8+ and CD21+) both at rest and at the end of an eventing competition. Blood samples were collected from eight Warmblood horses (medium age 10 ± 3) during an official national 2-day event competition at rest (R) and 10 min after the arrival of the cross-country test on the second day. Exercise caused a significant increase in red blood cell number, haemoglobin, packed cell volume, neutrophils, white blood cell and lymphocyte number; however, these values remained within the normal range. The CD4+ and CD8+ cells significantly increased, whereas the CD21+ lymphocytes decreased; a significant increase in serum SAA, lysozyme and protein carbonyl derivates was also observed. Two-day event causes significant changes in APR markers such as lysozyme, protein carbonyl derivates (HNE, AGEs, PENT) and lymphocyte subpopulations. The data support the hypothesis that 2-day event may alter significantly APR markers. Limitations of the study were the relatively small sample size and sampling time conditioned by the official regulations of the event. Therefore, further studies are needed to investigate the time required for recovery to basal values in order to define the possible effects on the immune function of the athlete horse. © 2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={Thirty-seven goats carrying different prion protein genotypes (PRNP) were orally infected with a classical scrapie brain homogenate from wild-type (ARQ/ARQ) sheep and then mated to obtain 2 additional generations of offspring, which were kept in the same environment and allowed to be naturally exposed to scrapie. Occurrence of clinical or subclinical scrapie was observed in the experimentally infected goats (F0) and in only one (F1b) of the naturally exposed offspring groups. In both groups (F0 and F1b), goats carrying the R154H, H154H, R211Q, and P168Q-P240P dimorphisms died of scrapie after a longer incubation period than wild-type, G37V, Q168Q-P240P, and S240P goats. In contrast, D145D and Q222K goats were resistant to infection. The immunobiochemical signature of the scrapie isolate and its pathological aspects observed in the sheep donors were substantially maintained over 2 goat generations, i.e., after experimental and natural transmission. This demonstrates that the prion protein gene sequence, which is shared by sheep and goats, is more powerful than any possible but unknown species-related factors in determining scrapie phenotypes. With regard to genetics, our study confirms that the K222 mutation protects goats even against ovine scrapie isolates, and for the first time, a possible association of D145 mutation with scrapie resistance is shown. In addition, it is possible that the sole diverse frequencies of these genetic variants might, at least in part, shape the prevalence of scrapie among naturally exposed progenies in affected herds. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.},

abstract={Statutory surveillance of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) indicates that cattle are susceptible to both classical BSE (C-BSE) and atypical forms of BSE. Atypical forms of BSE appear to be sporadic and thus may never be eradicated. A major challenge for prion surveillance is the lack of sufficiently practical and sensitive tests for routine BSE detection and strain discrimination. The real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) test, which is based on prion-seeded fibrillization of recombinant prion protein (rPrPSen), is known to be highly specific and sensitive for the detection of multiple human and animal prion diseases but not BSE. Here, we tested brain tissue from cattle affected by C-BSE and atypical L-type bovine spongiform encephalopathy (L-type BSE or L-BSE) with the RT-QuIC assay and found that both BSE forms can be detected and distinguished using particular rPrPSen substrates. Specifically, L-BSE was detected using multiple rPrPSen substrates, while C-BSE was much more selective. This substrate-based approach suggests a diagnostic strategy for specific, sensitive, and rapid detection and discrimination of at least some BSE forms.

abstract={A male, six-year-old pudu (Pudu puda) from an Italian zoo was submitted for postmortem examination after sudden death. Necroscopy revealed non-suppurative bronchopneumonia and degeneration of the liver and haemorrhagic lesions of the thymus, pericardium and spleen. Microscopically, multifocal perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates were observed in the kidneys, lungs, spleen, and the portal triads of the liver. Histological examination of the brain showed meningitis, vasculitis and perivascular cuffs of mononuclear inflammatory cells. A region of the DNA polymerase gene of malignant catarrhal fever viruses was amplified by real-time PCR and nested PCR. PCR products from the tissue samples were sequenced and analysed. The sequences showed 99% similarity with a portion of the caprine herpesvirus 2 DNA polymerase gene. This is the first report of malignant catarrhal fever in a captive pudu. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) is responsible for foodborne zoonotic infections that, in humans, induce self-limiting gastroenteritis. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the wild-type strain S. Typhimurium (STM14028) is able to exploit inflammation fostering an active infection. Due to the similarity between human and porcine diseases induced by S. Typhimurium, we used piglets as a model for salmonellosis and gastrointestinal research. This study showed that STM14028 is able to efficiently colonize in vitro porcine mono-macrophages and intestinal columnar epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells, and that the colonization significantly increases with LPS pre-treatment. This increase was then reversed by inhibiting the LPS stimulation through LPS antagonist, confirming an active role of LPS stimulation in STM14028-intracellular colonization. Moreover, LPS in vivo treatment increased cytokines blood level and body temperature at 4 h post infection, which is consistent with an acute inflammatory stimulus, capable to influence the colonization of STM14028 in different organs and tissues. The present study proves for the first time that in acute enteric salmonellosis, S. Typhimurium exploits inflammation for its benefit in piglets. © 2015 Chirullo, Pesciaroli, Drumo, Ruggeri, Razzuoli, Pistoia, Petrucci, Martinelli, Cucco, Moscati, Amadori, Magistrali, Alborali and Pasquali.},

abstract={Avian influenza A viruses have gained increasing attention due to their ability to cross the species barrier and cause severe disease in humans and other mammal species as pigs. H3 and particularly H3N8 viruses, are highly adaptive since they are found in multiple avian and mammal hosts. H3N8 viruses have not been isolated yet from humans; however, a recent report showed that equine influenza A viruses (IAVs) can be isolated from pigs, although an established infection has not been observed thus far in this host. To gain insight into the possibility of H3N8 avian IAVs to cross the species barrier into pigs, in vitro experiments and an experimental infection in pigs with four H3N8 viruses from different origins (equine, canine, avian, and seal) were performed. As a positive control, an H3N2 swine influenza virus A was used. Although equine and canine viruses hardly replicated in the respiratory systems of pigs, avian and seal viruses replicated substantially and caused detectable lesions in inoculated pigs without previous adaptation. Interestingly, antibodies against hemagglutinin could not be detected after infection by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) test with avian and seal viruses. This phenomenon was observed not only in pigs but also in mice immunized with the same virus strains. Our data indicated that H3N8 IAVs from wild aquatic birds have the potential to cross the species barrier and establish successful infections in pigs that might spread unnoticed using the HAI test as diagnostic tool. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.},

abstract={Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs) have similar toxic, endocrine-disrupting, and carcinogenic activity. They are classified as persistent organic pollutants accumulating in the environment and the tissues of living organisms. High concentrations of PCDD/F and dl-PCB have been detected in bovine milk collected in a Piedmont valley (Northwestern Italy) since 2004.This geographic study describes the local distribution of pollution from PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs. Since their presence in animal products could be traced back to the ingestion of contaminated fodder, dioxin levels in cow milk were related to the distribution of fodder cropland parcels. Specifically, the aim of the study was to determine, through an exploratory approach, whether the contamination was consistent with one common point source of contamination or different scattered sources.Data for PCDD/F and dl-PCB concentrations in the bulk milk from 27 herds, sampled over a 4-year period (2004-2007), were matched to the georeferenced land parcels the dairy farmers used for growing fodder. Isopleth maps of dioxin concentrations were estimated with ordinary kriging. The highest level of pollution for both PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs was geographically juxtaposed: in both instances, the location of the local steel plant was within this extremely highly polluted area.The study results support the hypothesis for one common point source of contamination in the valley. The exploratory spatial analysis applied in this research may provide a valuable, novel approach to straightforward identification of a highly likely source of dioxin contamination of dairy products (even in the absence of top soil contamination data). © 2014 The Authors.},

abstract={There is very little scientific literature about the impact of Eel virus European X (EVEX) on eels held under artificial reproduction condition, and its effective role in eel decline is uncertain and still unclear. Following a disease outbreak of European eels, farmed in an experimental hatchery in Italy, a sample of the affected animals was analyzed to determine the cause of illness. Virological isolation, PCR assay and molecular characterization revealed the presence of EVEX in the diseased animals. The complete N, P, M and G gene regions were amplified by using novel primers specific for EVEX. The EVEX strain identified in this study was phylogenetically close to the known EVEX isolates; however, this Italian isolate diverges and localizes in a separated branch of this cluster. In addition, some unique amino acid changes in three out of four analyzed viral proteins differentiated the Italian virus from reported EVEX sequences which, although few in number, do cover different geographical areas and a 30-year time span. Molecular data are needed to gain further insight into the genetic variability of EVEX, to better define its phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships and to unravel the existence of different circulating strains. Examination of samples caught in the same area failed to detect the presence of EVEX infection. These results strongly indicate that the presence and risk factors associated with EVEX infection are not well established and further study should be performed in this field, in particular on stress and temperature dependence for disease development. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an elusive model of host/virus relationship in which disease is determined by virus pathogenicity, pig breed susceptibility and phenotype, microbial infectious pressure, and environmental conditions. The disease can be controlled by farm management programs, which can be supported by vaccination or conditioning of animals to circulating PRRS virus (PRRSV) strains. Yet, PRRS still represents a cause of heavy losses for the pig industry worldwide. Immunological control strategies are often compounded by poor and late development of adaptive immunity in both vaccinated and infected animals. Also, there is evidence that results of field trials can be worse than those of experimental studies in isolation facilities. Neutralizing antibody (NA) was shown to prevent PRRSV infection. Instead, the role of NA and adaptive immunity on the whole in virus clearance after established PRRSV infections is still contentious. Pigs eventually eliminate PRRSV infection, which may be correlated with an "educated," innate immune response, which may also develop following vaccination. In addition to vaccination, an immunomodulation strategy for PRRS can be reasonably advocated in pig "problem" farms, where a substantial control of disease prevalence and disease-related losses is badly needed. This is not at odds with vaccination, which should be preferably restricted to PRRSV-free animals bound for PRRSV-infected farm units. Oral, low-dose, interferon-a treatments proved effective on farm for the control of respiratory and reproductive disease outbreaks, whereas the results were less clear in isolation facilities. Having in mind the crucial interaction between PRRSV and bacterial lipopolysaccharides for occurrence of respiratory disease, the strong control actions of low-dose type I interferons on the inflammatory response observed in vitro and in vivo probably underlie the rapid clinical responses observed in field trials. © 2014 Amadori and Razzuoli.},

abstract={Background: Prednisolone was one of the first glucocorticoids to be synthesised, but it is still widely applied to cattle. Illegal uses of prednisolone include its uses for masking a number of diseases before animal sale and, at lower dosages for extended periods of time, for the improvement of feed efficiency and carcass characteristics. Since occasional presence of prednisolone has been detected at trace level in urine samples from untreated cattle, the Italian Ministry of Health introduced a provisional limit of 5 ng/mL to avoid false non-compliances. However, this limit proved ineffective in disclosing prednisolone misuse as a growth-promoter. In the present study, prednisolone acetate was administered to finishing bulls and cows according to a therapeutic protocol (2 × 0.4-0.5 mg/kg bw i.m. at 48 h interval) to further verify the practical impact of this cut-off limit and develop sound strategies to distinguish between exogenous administration and endogenous production. Urinary prednisolone, prednisone, 20β-dihydroprednisolone, 20α-dihydroprednisolone, 20β-dihydroprednisone, 6β-hydroxyprednisolone, cortisol, and cortisone were determined using a validated LC/MS-MS method. Results: The urinary excretion profile showed the simultaneous presence of prednisolone, 20β-dihydroprednisolone, and prednisone, the latter at lower concentrations, up to 33 days after the first dosing. Higher analyte levels were detected in bulls even after correction for dilution in the urine. Prednisolone concentrations below 5 ng/ml were determined in half of the samples collected at 19 days, and in all the samples obtained 26 and 33 days after the first administration. No measurable concentrations of prednisolone or its metabolites were found in the samples collected before the treatment, while cortisol and cortisone levels lower than the respective LOQs were observed upon treatment. Conclusions: The present study confirms the criticism of the coarse quantitative approach currently adopted to ascertain illegal prednisolone administration in cattle. As previously shown for growth-promoting treatments of meat cattle, the simultaneous determination of urinary prednisolone, prednisone, 20β-dihydroprednisolone, along with cortisol and cortisone, may represent a more reliable approach to confirm the exogenous origin of prednisolone. Such a strategy would facilitate unequivocal detection of animals treated with prednisolone acetate using a therapeutical protocol, even 3 to 4 weeks after the treatment. © 2014 Nebbia et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={A rapid and sensitive method to detect melamine in liquid milk based on Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) spectroscopy is presented, exploiting the selective binding of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with this analyte. This interaction promotes the aggregation of the AuNPs inducing a huge enhancement of the melamine signals in the Raman spectrum due to the formation of SERS "hot spots". An external standard calibration method was employed for quantitative analysis and the method was validated for linearity, sensitivity, repeatability and recovery. A good linearity (R2 = 0.99) was found in the concentration range of 0.31-5.0 mg l-1 in milk with a limit of detection of 0.17 mg l-1. This method does not require a long extraction procedure (total analysis time can be lower than 30 min) and can be reliably used for melamine detection in milk matrix in accordance with the European law limits. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={β2-agonists are often abused in cattle breeding because of their effects on animal growth and meat properties. The use of β2-agonists as growth promoters is forbidden in the European Union (Council Directive 96/23/EC classifies them into group A of Annex I), due to their toxicity and carcinogenic properties, as for anabolic steroids, which are often administered in combination with β2-agonists, to promote the storage of proteins and increase muscle size. A unique confirmatory liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the quantitative detection of 13 β2-agonists and anabolic steroids plus the qualitative identification of other three analytes in bovine hair was developed and validated, according to Decision 2002/657/CE. Hair samples were washed with dichloromethane, digested within a NaOH solution and subjected to liquid-liquid extraction. The analysis was performed by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in the selected reaction monitoring mode. The absence of matrix interferents, together with good repeatability of both retention times and relative abundances of diagnostic transitions, allowed the correct identification of all analytes. The quantitative calibrations obtained from spiked blank hair samples proved linear in the range tested. CCα and CCβ ranged from 0.5 ng/g to 30 ng/g. Intralaboratory reproducibility (CV%) ranged between 5.0 and 17.7 and trueness between 96%±7% and 105%±8%. The applicability of the method to real positive samples was demonstrated for both β2-agonists and anabolic steroids. 17α-boldenone was found in most (70%) hair samples obtained from untreated animals, supporting the hypothesis of endogenous production of this steroid.

abstract={Background: The genus Flavivirus comprises several mosquito-borne species, including the zoonotic pathogens West Nile and Usutu virus, circulating in animals and humans in Italy since 1998. Due to its ecological and geographical features, Piedmont is considered a risk area for flavivirus transmission. Here we report the results of a flavivirus survey (detection and genetic characterization) of mosquitoes collected in Piedmont in 2012 and the genetic characterization of three strains detected in 2011. Methods. Pools of 1-203 mosquitoes, upon RNA extraction with TRIzol, were screened by a PCR assay for a 263 bp fragment of the Flavivirus NS5 gene. All positive samples were tested with a specific PCR for the E protein gene of Usutu virus and a generic Flavivirus RT-nested-PCR for a larger tract of the NS5 gene before sequencing. Phylogenetic trees were built with both NS5 fragments of representative Flavivirus species. DNA extracts of part of the positive pools were tested to detect sequences integrated in the host genome. Results: Thirty-four mosquito pools resulted positive for flaviviruses, and twenty-five flavivirus sequences underwent phylogenetic analysis for the short NS5 fragment. Among the 19 sequences correlating with the insect-specific flavivirus group, ten samples, retrieved from Aedes albopictus, clustered within Aedes flavivirus, while the other nine aggregated in a separate clade composed of strains from various mosquito species (mainly Aedes vexans) from Piedmont and the Czech Republic. Six out of these nine also presented a DNA form of the sequence. The remaining sequences belonged to the mosquito-borne group: four, all from Culex pipiens, correlated to Italian Usutu virus strains, whereas two, from Ochlerotatus caspius, were highly similar to Marisma mosquito virus (MMV). Conclusions: Our findings confirm the circulation of Usutu virus and of the potentially zoonotic Marisma mosquito virus in Piedmont. This is the first detection of Aedes flavivirus in Piedmont. Finally, further evidence for the integration of Flavivirus nucleic acid into the host genome has been shown. These results underline the importance of continuing intense mosquito-based surveillance in Piedmont, supported by a mosquito control program in areas at high risk for human exposure. © 2014 Rizzo et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Most amniotes are the hosts of many, distantly related papillomaviruses (PVs). Infection by PVs can be asymptomatic, or lead instead to benign or malignant lesions. However, PVs infecting animals and associated with malignancies are still largely understudied. In the present study, we communicate the complete genome of a novel PV found in a nasal neoplasia of a free-ranging alpine chamois (Rupicapra r. rupicapra) in an Italian national park. Long-PCR and cloning approaches followed for Sanger sequencing were used to identify the first PV found in chamois. The genome of the novel virus - RrupPV1 - of 7256. bp in length, presents the classical PV structure, and lacks the interE2-L2 region that hosts the E5 gene in AlphaPVs and in DeltaPVs. The nucleotide identity percentage of the L1 ORF, places RrupPV1 together with OaPV3 in the same genus. The latter is a PV isolated from a squamous cell carcinoma in sheep in Sardinia. Full-genome phylogenetic reconstructions suggest that these two viruses are sister taxa, and that both of them are very distantly related to any other known PV.Many cetartiodactyl species are infected by non-monophyletic PVs. Our results exemplify further the multiple links between the infection by certain, distantly related PVs and the development of diverse cancers in animals and highlight the need of a systematic search of oncogenic and non-oncogenic animal PVs. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Oral, low-dose IFN-α treatments proved effective in several models of viral infections and immunopathological conditions. Also, they do not give rise to the serious side effects observed after parenteral inoculation of high doses (105U/kg b.w. and higher). There is convincing evidence that such treatments work through an early, effective interaction with oral lymphoid tissues before the IFN-α molecules are rapidly destroyed by gut enzymes. Yet, the paucity of detailed information about these crucial interactions and the lack of recognized in vitro models hamper the development of proper administration protocols. On the basis of a previous study, we developed an in vitro model of interaction between different types of human and porcine IFNs-α at low/moderate concentrations and pig tonsil cells. The IFNs-α under study showed different properties with respect to three fundamental control actions: (1) IgA release in culture, (2) release of natural antimicrobial compounds, and (3) homeostatic regulation of the inflammatory response. This was checked in pig intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2 cell line) treated with supernatants of control and IFN α-treated tonsil cell cultures, respectively, in terms of inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses. Some IFNs-α caused a significant inhibition of IL-8 (protein release and gene expression) and beta-defensin 1 (gene expression) probably through second messengers released by IFN α-treated tonsil cells. Interestingly, a human lymphoblastoid IFN-α under study caused the decrease of polyclonal IgA release by pig tonsil cells and significantly stimulated the in vitro recall antibody response of swine PBMC to Foot-and-Mouth Disease virus. The modulation of IgA and antibacterial compounds was accompanied by an anti-inflammatory control action at the same, low to moderate IFN-α concentrations (1-100U/ml). This highlights the very foundation of the homeostatic control actions performed by Type I IFNs: to promote an effective host response to infectious and non-infectious stressors and to turn off noxious inflammatory responses associated with tissue damage and waste of metabolic energy. The described tonsil cell model in vitro can be conducive to a further development of oral cytokine treatments in humans and animals in the "one health" conceptual framework. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of image analysis measurements in combination with the official analytical method for the detection of constituents of animal origin in feedstuffs, in distinguishing between bovine and swine (bone containing) material. Authentic samples of controlled origin containing bovine or swine meat and bone meals were analysed by the microscopic method, in accordance with the official analytical method. Sediment fractions of each sample were observed with a compound microscope at X40. A total of 362 bone fragment lacunae images were recorded and processed through image analysis software, deriving 30 geometric variables for each lacuna. Results indicated that not only were most variables significantly (P<0.001) different between bovine and swine samples, but also that two thirds of the same variables were bigger in bovine than in swine. This information, however, does not seem to be so effective in practice since bovine and swine features and measurements overlapped. It can be concluded that the microscopic method even when combined with image analysis does not fit all the requirements for accurately identifying prohibited ingredients of animal origin. A combined approach with other methods is therefore recommended. © M. Ottoboni et al., 2014.},

abstract={In Italy, measures against bovine tuberculosis (BTB) were enforced for the first time in 1954, with compulsory slaughtering of bovines showing clinical evidence of TB. Voluntary eradication plans, based on the identification of infected animals by tuberculin test, started in 1964. Mycobacterium bovis in wildlife is mainly reported in wild boar. Biomolecular techniques are determinant to improve the level of understanding for the strategic planning and effective management of public intervention. The potential of M. bovis to be transmitted to man is one of the main reasons of concern associated with the presence of this agent in domestic animals and wildlife. Major losses suffered by farmers in meat production are caused by the anticipated culling of infected cattle, the reduced income for the meat industry being usually less important. Residual prevalence of TB in the final phase of eradication programs is of major concern for the farming industry. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

abstract={Campylobacteriosis was the most frequently reported zoonosis in the European Union (EU) in 2010, with Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli, and Campylobacter lari as the most frequently reported species in foodborne outbreaks (FBOs). Relatively sensitive to environmental factors, these species may be present in low numbers. In line with EU policy for food control and FBO detection and in view of the need to reduce response time, we validated an alternative molecular method according to ISO 16140:2003 which establishes the general principle and technical protocol for the validation of alternative methods in the microbiological analysis of food. We used a qualitative real-time PCR commercial kit for the detection of C. jejuni, C. coli, and C. lari in two food categories "fruit and vegetable-based products" and "dairy products". The validation protocol comprises two phases: the first is a method comparison study of the alternative method against the reference method, and the second is an interlaboratory study of each of the two methods. In the first step, ISO 16140:2003 validation examines the following parameters: limit of detection (LOD); relative accuracy, relative specificity and sensitivity; relative detection level (RDL); and inclusivity and exclusivity. Except for LOD, inclusivity and exclusivity, the other steps were performed against the reference method (ISO 10272:2006).The LOD of the real-time PCR method was set at 4. CFU/25. g or mL for both food categories. Relative accuracy (98.33%), specificity (96.77%), and sensitivity (100%) were recorded for the food category "fruit and vegetable-based products" and 93.3%, 88.24%, 100%, respectively, for "dairy products". The RDL according to Fisher's exact test was p= 1 for both food categories, for each level, and each food/strain combination. The interlaboratory study results showed correct identification of all 24 blind samples with both methods by all the participating laboratories.The results show that this commercial kit is suitable for the rapid detection of C. jejuni, C. coli, and C. lari on fruit, vegetables and dairy products and may aid in official controls. In conclusion, the use of alternative methods is recommended for the rapid identification of positive samples and the identification of the possible bacterial source in a FBO within 48 h. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Staphylococcal foodborne intoxication, occurring after consumption of staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) in food, is considered one of the most common forms of bacterial foodborne outbreaks worldwide. Milk and dairy products account for 5% of all the incriminated foods in staphylococcal outbreaks, referring to Europe. The distribution of genes encoding for enterotoxins in Staphylococcus aureus strains is highly variable, with some carried on stable regions of the chromosome and others carried on mobile genetic elements. The aim of this study was to analyse the distribution of genes encoding for SEs in Staph. aureus strains isolated from milk and dairy products. In the period from January 2010 to June 2011, a total of 1245 dairy samples (848 of raw milk and 397 of dairy products) were collected and analysed for detection of genes encoding for 11 SEs and SEls (SEA, SEB, SEC, SED, SEE, SEG, SEH, SEI, SER SElJ and SElP) according to the procedures of the Italian National Reference Laboratory for coagulase-positive Staphylococci including Staph. aureus. Staphylococcus aureus strains were isolated in 481 (39%) samples. Of the 481 isolates of Staph. aureus tested, 255 (53%) were positive for one or more SE genes, and thirty-five different enterotoxin gene profiles were distinguished among the isolates. ser gene, found in 134 (28%) of the isolates, was the most frequent, followed by sed (25%) and selj genes (25%). The identification of new SEs increased the isolation frequency of enterotoxigenic staphylococci, thus suggesting that the pathogenic potential of Staph. aureus may be of greater importance than previously thought. Further studies are needed to quantify the expression of these new enterotoxins, and to assess their contribution to foodborne disease burden. © 2013 The Society for Applied Microbiology.},

abstract={Soils contaminated with radionuclide pose a long-term radiation hazard to human health through exposure via the food chain and other pathways. Remediation of contaminated soils has become increasingly important. The feasibility to move radionuclides from superficial soil layers to a deeper level using an acid leaching solution was already illustrated previously. As this chemical treatment may influence soil equilibrium, its potential effect on germination and on the development of herbaceous plants was studied. Despite an initial delay in growth of treated plants, the same biomass production in the treated samples is reached after about one month since sowing. Even if germination is damaged by the chemical solution in a first short period, this effect is transitory. Therefore, the treatment based on this solution does not reduce the bioavailability in the uppermost soil horizon and does not compromise the yield of pastures land.

abstract={Pancreatin is a substance containing enzymes, principally amylase, lipase, and protease. It is obtained from bovine or porcine pancreas and used in the treatment of pancreatic endocrine insufficiency in humans. Regulations and safety concerns mandate viral clearance (virus removal or inactivation) in biopharmaceuticals such as pancreatin. A virus validation study was performed to evaluate virus clearance achieved in the final step of drying under vacuum by testing a panel of four animal viruses: Pseudorabies virus (PRV), Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), and Porcine parvovirus (PPV). Because of the product's virucidal effect and high cytotoxicity, the starting material was diluted to a ratio of 0.67. g of dried pancreatin resuspended in 13.5. mL of cell culture medium followed by a 50-fold dilution in cell culture medium before spiking. After heating at 60. ±. 1. °C for 5. h, the samples were diluted about 5-fold in cell culture medium and titered by the plaque assay method. The virus reduction factor ranged from 5.59 (for PPV) to 7.07 (for EMCV) and no viral plaque was observed, indicating that the process step was effective in the reduction and removal of virus contamination. Though no virus contamination events in pancreatin have been reported to date, evaluation of the production process for its ability to inactivate and/or remove virus contamination, particularly from zoonotic viral agents such as hepatitis E virus and Norovirus considered emerging pathogens, is necessary to ensure the viral safety of animal-derived biopharmaceuticals. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Extensive screening analyses of perfluorooctane sulfonate and related perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) in biota samples from all over the world have identified PFCs as global pollutants and have shown their bioaccumulation into higher trophic levels in the food chain. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) are environmental contaminants belonging to a chemical group known as perfluorinated compounds. PFOS and PFOA are very persistent in the environment and bioaccumulate in humans. They are potential reproductive and developmental toxicants and are considered to be emerging endocrine disrupters. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) considers both compounds to be carcinogenic and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recently pointed out that they are associated with adverse health effects. Diet is considered the main source of exposure to PFCs, which have been found more frequently in fish and other seafood, compared to other food groups. In fact, aquatic ecosystems represent the final reservoir for PFCs due to their great affinity for sedimentary and living organic matter. In these systems, measured levels of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) could increase along the trophic web, ultimately affecting humans that consume aquatic species. In this study, PFOS and PFOA was detected by LC-MS/MS in muscle samples of Coregonus lavaretus (European whitefish) and Perca fluviatilis (European perch) collected from Lake Maggiore, a large lake located on the south side of the Italian Alps. PFOA was not found in any of the investigated samples above the limit of quantitation of 0.50ngg-1 fresh weight (fw), whereas PFOS was detected in all 90 samples with concentrations of up to 46.0ngg-1fw. Mean concentrations were 22.2ngg-1fw in P. fluviatilis and 20.0ngg-1fw in C. lavaretus. Comparison of our results with literature data on PFOS intake suggested that fish from Lake Maggiore may be a significant source of dietary PFOS exposure, even if the reported values were lower than the Total Daily Intake (TDI) proposed by EFSA. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Introduction - Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSEs), the most known in the world and the only zoonotic. It is characterized by a long incubation period, a clinical course with progressive neurological symptoms and the absence of inflammatory or immune reactions. BSE poses a serious risk to human and animal health. Several measures have been adopted by the European Community as protection of public health with specific rules for the prevention, control and eradication. Aim - The purpose of this paper is to present the evolution of the surveillance system in Italy and the practical implications of its recent recognition by the OIE as a country recognised as having a negligible BSE risk. Materials and method - The classification of countries according to their BSE risk aims at defining rules to regulate trade for each category of risk, balancing the need to ensure the protection of animal and public health in the importing countries and take preventive measures according to the risk. To this purpose, to gather the main elements to be put in relation with the epidemiological changes a revision of the Italian and European legislation was carried out. Results and discussion - The results obtained in the frame of the surveillance system in Italy since 2001 show a trend of the epidemic in terms of prevalence characterized by a strong and steady decline. Consolidated data shows that the probability of finding the disease among the animals of the risk categories (fallen stock, casualty or emergency slaughter) was 4.3 times higher than the total of the same probability in healthy slaughtered animals. Thus surveillance in the targeted risk categories gives to the surveillance system its maximum sensitivity. Conclusions - The application of effective measures led to a drastic and unquestionable reduction of the Italian cases. Furthermore, the increased average age of the cases indicates that the risk of exposure, higher in the mid-90s, has been gradually decreasing until probably disappear. However, in a global context of increased production and consumption of bovine meat the risk of reintroduction of the disease is real. So in order to establish in the future an early warning system for BSE, it is important to maintain active surveillance in cattle belonging to risk categories in which it is most likely the presence of the disease, ie all animals older than 48 months.},

abstract={Corticosteroids have become the most widespread illegal growth promoters in veal calves and beef cattle. Testing for corticosteroids relies on either direct detection of compounds or their metabolites or indirect detection to identify changes in biological pathways. We used a comparative proteomic approach, based on two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE), to identify plasma protein markers after short-term dexamethasone administration in veal calves. Twenty-three male Friesian veal calves were treated experimentally with dexamethasone sodium phosphate: 10 received low-dose administration of the drug (0.4 mg day-1 per os) for 20 consecutive days (treatment group); 10 received the drug at therapeutic dosage (2-4 mg kg-1 i.m.) for 3 consecutive days (comparison group). Three animals were not treated (control group). Plasma samples were collected from each animal at six time points (T1-T6; treatment and control group) and at four time points (T1-T4; comparison group) and stored at -80°C until analysis. Plasma proteins were quantified and analysed in triplicate by 2DE. The images were analysed with Bionumerics® software. Comparison of 2DE maps obtained from blood samples at T1 (before treatment) and at T6 (final sampling) showed a significant disappearance (p &lt; 0.001) of two protein spots at T6 in the treatment group. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis and immunoblotting identified these isoforms as serum paraoxonase/arylesterase 1 precursor (PON1). Synthesised in the liver and released into the blood, PON1 has an important role in lipid metabolism. The absence of variation of this protein in the comparison group suggests that the marker has good specificity for detecting illicit corticosteroid treatment. © 2014 Taylor &amp; Francis.},

abstract={Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a major concern in environmental studies as many of them have been labeled as probable carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC 1983). Due to their lipophilic properties and resistance to degradation, PAHs can accumulate in organic tissue. As a consequence, alarming concentrations of these compounds have been found in many aquatic species. The European catfish (Silurus glanis) is a top food chain predator that is considered to be a reliable bio-indicator of environmental pollution. From 2009 to 2011, 54 specimens of S. glanis were captured from four different sites covering the area of the Po River basin (Northern Italy). Fish muscles were analyzed in the laboratory to determine the levels of nine PAHs, namely naphthalene, acenaphthene, fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene, pyrene, benz[a]anthracene, chrysene, and benz[a]pyrene (BaP), which were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The total average concentration of PAHs was 26.90±49.50 ng g-1 (min 0.60, max 275.75 ng g-1). Analysis showed that 9.20 % of the fish muscles exceeded the maximum levels of 2 ng g-1 set for BaP by European regulations (Commission Regulation (EC), 2006). Values measured for benz[a]pyrene ranged from 0.05 to 8.20 ng g-1 (mean 1.07±1.58 ng g-1). Chrysene and benz[a]anthracene, both considered potential human carcinogens (PAH2), were found at levels of 4.40 and 0.05 ng g -1 (mean values), respectively. The highest mean concentration was recorded for anthracene (12.92 ng g-1), which has been recently included in the list of substances of very high concern (SVHC) as reported by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA 1-9, 2009). © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate microbiological criteria of a traditional Piedmont cheese, made by two different cheese producers (A and B). Three batches of each cheese were considered. The following seven samples of each batch were collected: raw milk, milk at 38°C, curd, cheese at 7, 30, 60, 90 days of ripening. During cheese making process, training activities dealing with food safety were conducted. Analyses regarding food safety and process hygiene criteria were set up according to the EC Regulation 2073/2005. Other microbiological and chemical-physical analyses [lactic streptococci, lactobacilli, pH and water activity (Aw)] were performed as well. Shiga-toxin Escherichia coli, aflatoxin M1 and antimicrobial substances were considered only for raw milk. All samples resulted negative for food safety criteria; Enterobacteriaceae, E.coli and coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS) were high in the first phase of cheese production, however they decreased at the end of ripening. A high level of CPS in milk was found in producer A, likewise in some cheese samples a count of &gt;5 Log CFU/g was reached; staphylococcal enterotoxins resulted negative. The pH and Aw values decreased during the cheese ripening period. The competition between lactic flora and potential pathogen microorganisms and decreasing of pH and Aw are considered positive factors in order to ensure safety of dairy products. Moreover, training activities play a crucial role to manage critical points and perform corrective action. Responsible application of good manufacturing practices are considered key factors to obtain a high hygienic level in dairy products.},

abstract={Campylobacteriosis was the most commonly reported zoonosis for confirmed human cases in European Union during 2011. Poultry meat was very often implicated in Campylobacter infections in humans. In Italy commerce of raw poultry meat is common in open-air markets: these areas can be considered at high risk of bacterial contamination due to the high presence birds like pigeons. The aim of this study was to collect data about the contamination by thermotolerant Campylobacter of raw poultry meat commercialised in open-air markets, of work-surfaces in contact with poultry meat and of pigeon stools sampled in the market areas in Turin, Northern Italy. Between September 2011 and December 2012, 86 raw poultry meat samples, 86 environmental swabs and 108 animal samples were collected in 38 open-air markets. Analysis were carried out according to ISO10272-1:2006 standard. C.coli was detected in 2.3% (2/86) of raw poultry meat samples, whereas no swab (0/86) resulted positive. Of pigeon stool 28% (30/107) was positive for C.jejuni (83.3% C.jejuni subsp. jejuni and 16.7% C.jejuni subsp. doylei). C.jejuni subsp. jejuni was isolated from 1 dead pigeon. Our results showed lower rates of contamination than those reported at retail in Europe. Although samples were collected in areas at high risk of contamination, raw poultry meat and work surfaces reported a low level of presence of thermotolerant Campylobacter. The high percentage of C.jejuni isolated from pigeon stools showed the importance of a continuous application of preventive measures by the food business operators and the surveillance activity by the Competent Authority.},

abstract={Mycobacterium spp. and Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida are recognized as the most frequent causative agents of granulomatous lesions in fish. Although frequent episodes of mycobacterial infections have been reported in wild fish worldwide, only sporadic cases have been documented to date in Italy. To investigate for the presence of lesions referable to mycobacteriosis and to identify the mycobacterial species involved, a total of 159 wild mullets were fished from the eastern coast of the Ligurian Sea, killed and necropsied. Liver and spleen samples were collected from all fish for histopathological and microbiological analyses. Molecular investigations for identification of Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida were performed. Gross examination revealed granulomatous lesions in one animal; microscopically, 42.14% of fish displayed granulomas with various histological features, 19.50% resulted positive at Ziehl-Neelsen staining, and were confirmed as mycobacterial lesions by culture. The identified colonies were characterized as M. fortuitum, M. abscessus, M. flavescens, M. chelonae, M. septicum and M. nonchromogenicum. In all, 35% of animals resulted positive for Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida. These data suggest widespread mycobacterial infection also by Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida infections in wild fish. Moreover, the pathogenicity of some mycobacterial species, previously considered as saprophytic, was demonstrated. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Choroid plexus papilloma (CPP) is a rare, benign, intracranial neoplasm. The present report described a choroid plexus papilloma of the fourth ventricle with unusual proliferative reaction of ependymal/subependymal cells in a stallion. A single, soft neoformation, red-gray in color, with an irregular surface, resembling a cauliflower, expanding from the fourth ventricle to the cerebellar peduncles was observed. Microscopically, the neoformation was composed of a single layer of simple cuboidal to columnar epithelium with a well-vascularized papillary-arboriform pattern. Multifocal subependymal aggregates forming rosettes were observed near the mesencephalic aqueduct (MA). Glial-fibrillary-acidic-protein (GFAP) was markedly positive only in the neuropil adjacent to the proliferative areas of the MA. Ependymal/subependymal reactions secondary to CPP have never been described in equine or human neuropathology. The capabilities of ependymal cells to regenerate and eventually proliferate are controversial and unclear and, thus, require additional investigation to understand the adaptive mechanisms of this rare pathogenic condition. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Human beings are only accidental hosts that do not allow the normal evolution of the larva. However Anisakids may affect the human health in two ways: by means of a severe intestinal immune response and by an allergic reaction to chemicals released by worms in fish flesh. The objective of our work was to assess the potential risk associated with the consumption of fish from the Ligurian Sea. The sampling was carried out in the Ligurian Sea from October 2010 to February 2013; 902 red mullets were analyzed. Nematodes of the genus Anisakis (subfamily Anisakinae) and Hysterothylacium (subfamily Raphidascarinae) were isolated. Thus, in some fish of the Mediterranean Sea, Anisakids may be a risk for the food safety.},

abstract={A calf persistently infected with Hobi-like pestivirus displayed severe clinical signs and subsequently died. Gross lesions and histopathological changes were suggestive of hemorrhagic and necrotic inflammation involving several tissues. A Hobi-like pestivirus pair was isolated from the dead calf, i.e., cytopathogenic (CP) and noncytopathogenic (NCP) strains strictly related to each other and to Italian prototype isolates at the genetic level. Two biotype-specific real-time reverse transcription-PCR assays determined the time of the emergence of the CP virus as 1 month before the calf's death. This highest RNA titers were reached in lymphoid and nervous system tissues, whereas only traces of CP viral RNA were found in blood. In contrast, great NCP virus loads were present in all tissues and biological fluids.

At this scope, the content of faecal indicators and pathogens as well as the heavy metal concentration of DPs was monitored. The fertilizing performance of the DPs was also investigated. Co-digestion trials were performed using laboratory-scale (LRs) and pilot-scale reactors (PRs). The microbiological analysis of DPs showed the common presence of Salmonella and an inadequate reduction of indicator organisms during the digestion process, both in the LRs and the PRs. Moreover, the presence of pathogens (e.g. Listeria monocytogenes) in some DP samples highlighted the importance of the microbiological quality evaluation of the DPs to study the possible health risks for consumer. In several samples of DPs, the Cu, Ni and Zn contents exceeded the maximum admissible concentration for fertilizer, as specified by Italian law, suggesting possible environmental contamination if the DPs are used for agricultural purposes. Considering the fertilizing performance, significant differences of growth parameters were observed only for the DPs that were produced by LRs. In conclusion, this work can be considered as a preliminary study to evaluate the possible agricultural reuse of the digestate obtained from different organic wastes. © Springer International Publishing 2014.},

abstract={In January 2011, cases of abortion, stillbirth and weak live kids were reported in two goat herds in northern Italy. Samples from 18 kids found dead, 12 fetuses, and two stillborn kids were analyzed for pestivirus antigen using an ELISA kit and a border disease virus (BDV)-specific RT-PCR. Positive results were obtained in six kids and one fetus. Phylogenetic analysis based on 225. bp of the 5'UTR fragment of the BDV genome from positive samples showed that the goats were infected with BDV genotype 3. Serum and blood samples collected from all animals in both herds were analyzed using competitive ELISA to detect p80 antibodies and RT-PCR to detect viraemia.Pestivirus antibodies were detected in 61/67 goats in herd A and in 38/169 in herd B. A persistently infected (PI) goat was found in herd A. The PI animal was submitted to the laboratory for BDV diagnosis with Ag-ELISA, viral isolation, and nested RT-PCR on tissue samples from the spleen, kidney, brain, liver, lung, ileocaecal valve, mesenteric lymph nodes, and skin. All of the tests were positive for BDV in each of the tissues analyzed. The BDV sequence of the PI was identical to BDV sequences found in other positive animals. This is the first description of a BDV PI goat and the first evidence of BDV genotype 3 circulation in Italy. The study raises questions about the real impact this virus has on breeding goats. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={A simple and robust method for the determination of 18 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in fish was developed and validated. A mixture of acetone/n-hexane (1:1, v/v) was selected for accelerated solvent extraction (ASE). After the digestion of fat, the clean-up was carried out using solid phase extraction silica cartridges. Samples were analysed by GC-MS in selected ion monitoring (SIM) using three fragment ions for each congener (one quantifier and two qualifiers). PCB 155 and PCB 198 were employed as internal standards. The lowest limit of detection was observed for PCB 28 (0.4 ng/g lipid weight). The accuracy of the method was verified by means of the Certified Reference Material EDF-2525 and good results in terms of linearity (R2 &gt; 0.994) and recoveries (80-110%) were also achieved. Precision was evaluated by spiking blank samples at 4, 8 and 12 ng/g. Relative standard deviation values for repeatability and reproducibility were lower than 8% and 16%, respectively. The method was applied to the determination of PCBs in 80 samples belonging to four Mediterranean fish species. The proposed procedure is particularly effective because it provides good recoveries with lowered extraction time and solvent consumption; in fact, the total time of extraction is about 12 min per sample and, for the clean-up step, a total solvent volume of 13 ml is required. ©2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Toll-like receptors play a key role in innate immunity by recognizing pathogens and activating appropriate responses. Pathogens express several signal molecules (pathogen-associated molecular patterns, PAMPs) essential for survival and pathogenicity. Recognition of PAMPs triggers an array of anti-microbial immune responses through the induction of various inflammatory cytokines. The objective of this work was to perform a case-control study to characterize the distribution of polymorphisms in three candidate genes (toll-like receptor 2, toll-like receptor 4, toll-like receptor 9) and to test their role as potential risk factors for tuberculosis infection in water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). Results: The case-control study included 184 subjects, 59 of which resulted positive to both intradermal TB test and Mycobacterium bovis isolation (cases) and 125 resulted negative to at least three consecutive intradermal TB tests. The statistical analysis indicated that two polymorphisms exhibited significant differences in allelic frequencies between cases and controls. Indeed, the TT genotype at TLR9 2340 C > T locus resulted significantly associated with susceptibility to bovine tuberculosis (P = 0.030, OR = 3.31, 95% CI = 1.05-10.40). One polymorphism resulted significantly associated with resistance to the disease, and included the CC genotype, at the TLR4 672 A > C locus (P = 0.01, OR = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.08-0.80). Haplotype reconstruction of the TLR2 gene revealed one haplotype (CTTACCAGCGGCCAGTCCC) associated with disease resistance (P = 0.04, OR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.27 0.96), including the allelic variant associated with disease resistance. Conclusions: The work describes novel mutations in bubaline TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 genes and presents their association with M. bovis infection. These results will enhance our ability to determine the risk of developing the disease by improving the knowledge of the immune mechanisms involved in host response to mycobacterial infection, and will allow the creation of multiple layers of disease resistance in herds by selective breeding. © 2014 Alfano et al.},

abstract={Bubaline herpesvirus 1 (BuHV1) is a member of ruminant alphaherpesviruses antigenically related to bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV1). The impact of BuHV1 infection in infectious bovine rhinotracheitis control program is difficult to establish, due to the lack of specific diagnostic test. The ectodomain of glycoprotein E of BuHV1 was expressed as recombinant secreted protein and used in indirect ELISA as well as in a discriminatory test using the BoHV1 counterpart. A panel of monoclonal antibodies was produced against BuHV1; 6 out of 7 anti-gE monoclonal antibodies specifically recognized the BuHV1 gE. Results indicated BuHV1 gE as a sensitive marker of infection compared to seroneutralization (SN) test or blocking ELISA. When BoHV1 and BuHV1 gEs were immobilized in different wells of the same ELISA microplate, bovine and water buffalo sera were more reactive against the respective infecting virus. About one third of seropositive buffaloes with no history of contact with cattle and having higher SN titres, reacted in BoHV1 gE blocking ELISA, possibly because of steric hindrance. Since in two occasions BuHV1 was also isolated from water buffalo scoring gB+/gE+ BoHV1 blocking ELISA, we conclude that the combination of the two blocking ELISAs is not suitable to differentiate between BoHV1 and BuHV1. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that occurs in two clinically indistinguishable forms: sporadic (SALS) and familial (FALS), the latter linked to several gene mutations, mostly inheritable in a dominant manner. Nearly 20% of FALS forms are linked to mutations in the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene. Research on ALS relies on transgenic models and particularly on mice carrying a glycine-to-alanine conversion at the 93rd codon (G93A) of the hSOD1 gene. Although G93A transgenic mice have been widely employed in clinical trials and basic research, doubts have been recently raised from numerous reliable sources about their suitability to faithfully reproduce human disease. Besides, the scientific community has already foreseen swine as an attractive and alternative model to nonhuman primates for modeling human diseases due to closer anatomical, physiological and biochemical features of swine rather than rodents to humans. On this basis, we have produced the first swine ALS model by in vitro transfection of cultured somatic cells combined with somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). To achieve this goal we developed a SOD1G93A (superoxide dismutase 1 mutated in Gly93-Ala) vector, capable of promoting a high and stable transgene expression in primary porcine adult male fibroblasts (PAF). After transfection, clonal selection and transgene expression level assessment, selected SOD1G93A PAF colonies were used as nuclei donors in SCNT procedures. SOD1G93A embryos were transferred in recipient sows, and pregnancies developed to term. A total of 5 piglets survived artificial hand raising and weaning and developed normally, reaching adulthood. Preliminary analysis revealed transgene integration and hSOD1G93A expression in swine tissues and 360° phenotypical characterization is ongoing. We believe that our SOD1G93A swine would provide an essential bridge between the fundamental work done in rodent models and the reality of treating ALS. © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

abstract={A Seafood Frequency Questionnaire (SFQ) broken down in more than 42 items with 8-week coverage was interview-administered to 278 adults aged 19-82. years (167 women, 98 in the reproductive age 19-45. years, and 111 men), resident on the Italian Mediterranean shore and frequent buyer at local fish markets. Methylmercury (MeHg) intake on individual basis was estimated for a selected occurrence equal to the median value. +. Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) in each seafood species reported (conservative scenario). MeHg occurrence was derived from an extensive seafood database referred to years 2009-2011. Accounting for an average body weight of 62.2. kg, 24.6% of women resulted overexposed with respect to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Tolerable Weekly Intake (TWI) for MeHg of 1.3. μg/kg bw, with a mean of 0.92. μg/kg bw. In the vulnerable group aged 19-45. years, 29.6% exceeded the TWI. Rather than the amount of seafood consumed, the seafood choice appears to be the main determinant of the MeHg intake. Risk awareness was reported in the 49% of SFQs. Uncertainties related to such estimates from questionnaires are discussed, in order to give adequate health recommendations without compromising seafood consumption in the Mediterranean region. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={According to Commission Regulation (EU) No 142/2011, animal by-products (ABPs) not intended for human consumption should be excluded from the food chain, as they are a potential source of risks to public and animal health. As an example, in recent years an improper use of certain ABPs brought to a spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Therefore, Commission Regulation (EU) 142/2009 forces producers to mark permanently the ABPs not intended for human consumption (category 1 and category 2), with glyceroltriheptanoate (GTH). All EU Member States have the duty to control the content of GTH in ABPs, which should be present homogenously throughout the substance at a minimum concentration of at least 250mg GTH per kg fat. Starting from a Joint Research Centre procedure (von Holst, Boix, Bellorini, Androni, &amp; Serano, 2009), a method based on gas chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) was studied and validated as stated by Regulation 882/2004, providing an efficient tool for both official and in-house laboratories. Moreover, a monitoring study on seventeen samples collected throughout Italy by the Official Veterinary Service in rendering industries was carried out. Eight samples were not compliant with Commission Regulation (EU) No 142/2011, as their GTH concentration ranged from 224mgkg-1 to values below the lower range limit. Results found satisfied the requirements of European Union analytical methods validation criteria (Regulation (EC) No 882/2004).© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Reverse transcription (RT) quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is the most accurate and easy-to-perform technique to measure the expression level of a selected gene of interest by quantifying mRNA transcripts. The use of reference genes is commonly accepted as the most reliable approach to normalize RT-qPCR data and reduce possible errors generated in the quantification of gene expression. The optimal number and choice of reference genes are experimentally validated for specific tissues or cell types and experimental designs. To date, data on qPCR normalization in goats are scarce and the most suitable reference genes in this species have been identified for only a limited number of tissues. The aim of this study was to determine an optimal combination of stably expressed reference genes in caprine milk somatic cells (MSC) from healthy and infected mammary glands. For the purpose, we performed RT-qPCR for 10 commonly used reference genes from various functional classes and then determined their expression level in MSC from goats intramammary challenged with Staphylococcus aureus and in MSC from healthy controls, with a view to select genes whose stability would be unaffected under infection conditions. The geNorm and NormFinder algorithms were used for validating the reference genes. Furthermore, to demonstrate the importance of normalization of gene expression with appropriate reference genes, we tested the effect of using a combination of the least stable genes for expression analysis evaluation. On the basis of our evaluation, we recommend the use of a panel of reference genes that should include G6PD, YWHAZ, and ACTB for caprine MSC gene expression profiling. The expression of the 2 genes of interest, pentraxin-related protein ( PTX3) and secreted phosphoprotein 1 ( SPP1), was evaluated by RT-qPCR in all samples collected pre- and postinfection, and the recommended reference genes were used to normalize the data. Our study provides a validated panel of optimal reference genes for the identification of genes differentially expressed by qRT-PCR in caprine MSC. Moreover, we provided a set of intron-spanning primer sequences that could be suitable for gene expression experiments using SYBR Green chemistry on other caprine tissues and cells. © 2013 American Dairy Science Association.},

abstract={The transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) to humans, leading to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has demonstrated that cattle transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) can pose a risk to human health. Until recently, TSE disease in cattle was thought to be caused by a single agent strain, BSE, also known as classical BSE, or BSE-C. However, due to the initiation of a large-scale surveillance programme throughout Europe, two atypical BSE strains, bovine amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy (BASE, also named BSE-L) and BSE-H have since been discovered. To model the risk to human health, we previously inoculated these two forms of atypical BSE (BASE and BSE-H) into gene-targeted transgenic (Tg) mice expressing the human prion protein (PrP) (HuTg) but were unable to detect any signs of TSE pathology in these mice. However, despite the absence of TSE pathology, upon subpassage of some BASE-challenged HuTg mice, a TSE was observed in recipient gene-targeted bovine PrP Tg (Bov6) mice but not in HuTg mice. Disease transmission from apparently healthy individuals indicates the presence of subclinical BASE infection in mice expressing human PrP that cannot be identified by current diagnostic methods. However, due to the lack of transmission to HuTg mice on subpassage, the efficiency of mouse-to-mouse transmission of BASE appears to be low when mice express human rather than bovine PrP. © 2013 SGM.},

Staphylococcal FBOs are caused by consuming food contaminated with one or more preformed enterotoxins and are characterised by rapid onset of symptoms. In May 2012, an Italian family made up of five people was involved in a FBO: food sample of arancini (fried rice balls) were analysed and resulted positive for coagulase positive staphylococci (CPS) (>100,000 cfu/g) and for staphylococcal enterotoxins (SE) (types A and C). Laboratory analyses also led to the isolation of Staphylococcus aureus strain carrying the gene encoding for enterotoxin type A and belonging to the human biotype. The FBO described in this paper should be included in the next official FBO report as a strong evidence case: food and toxins responsible for symptoms and enterotoxigenic S. aureus strain were identified and the clinical symptoms matched with the final diagnosis. © D.M.

abstract={The school canteens are public catering services of great interest as they provide meals to a high number of consumers who are particularly susceptible to health risks, therefore surveillance and health control are very important to ensure food safety. To this purpose, a convention between the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale of Piemonte Liguria e Valle d'Aosta, and La Spezia municipality was established for the health control of school canteens. In this article we report the results of analysis performed on food and swab surfaces samples collected during the period 2003-2012 in 22 school canteens and 3 cooking centers. From a total of 1187 samples: 313 raw foods were analyzed for chemical and microbiological parameters to verify compliance with legislation, 71 food preparations were analyzed for bacteria indicators to assess the good manufacturing practices, and 803 surface swabs were tested for total mesophilic count (TMC), Salmonella spp. and Listeria spp. to control cleaning/disinfection conditions. The results show that only 1.3% of raw food samples did not respect the limits imposed by legislation, and 1.4% of food preparations was positive for pathogens. In environmental swabs, pathogenic microorganisms were never isolated and TMC exceeded the limits of acceptability in no more than 27% of cases. The most contaminated surfaces were those in contact with food and the equipment difficult to clean. The results demonstrate that potential hazards are kept to acceptable levels in school canteens and cooking centers investigated. In fact, during the period considered no foodborne diseases were reported among users. However, data obtained may be useful to better define control measures to be adopted to improve the hygienic level production in these structures and to prevent foodborne infections. © L.Serracca et al.},

The use of veterinary medicines may be cause of the presence of drug residues in animal food products if appropriate withdrawal periods are not respected or if contaminated feeds are used. This work presents the development of an high performance liquid chromatography with postcolumn fluorescence derivatization (HPLC-FLD) method for the quantitative detection of eight quinolones - norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, danofloxacin, enrofloxacin, difloxacin, oxolinic acid, nalidixic acid, and flumequine - in bovine milk. After deproteination and extraction with a metaphosphoric acid 1% w/v/methanol/acetonitrile (60/20/20 v/v/v) solution, the sample is partially evaporated and cleaned up on a reversed phase solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridge. The extract is analyzed using an HPLC-FLD. Mean recovery ranged between 65-88%. The method is validated as a confirmatory method according to Decision 2002/657/EC. All the verified parameters (linearity, selectivity/specificity, trueness, precision, CC, CC, ruggedness and stability) were satisfactory and the method is able to quantify all the analytes in milk in the concentration range 15-60 μg/Kg for danofloxacin and 25-150 μg/Kg for the other quinolones. © M.

abstract={Food safety must be guaranteed by the synergic action of all actors in production chain. The consumers cover an important role to ensure good storage conditions according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the influence on microbial parameters of storage temperature during shelf life of sliced vacuum packaged traditional cheese. One wheel of raw milk cheese was produced and ripened for 60 days. The cheese was portioned in 10 slices (200 g) and stored at +4°C for 28 days; then, three of these were stored at +10°C from day 29 to 56 and the others continued the storage at +4°C from day 29 to 56. Analyses on mesophilic aerobic microorganisms, total coliforms, Enterobacte - riaceae, mesophilic lactococci, thermophilic lactococci, thermophilic lactobacilli, pH and Aw were performed at 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 49, 56 days. The aerobic bacteria and lactic flora did not significantly changed during the study; coliforms and Enterobacteriaceae showed a greater reduction in the slices stored at +4 than at +10°C. Data confirm the maintenance of the refrigeration temperature as an important tool for reducing the risk of microbiological growth in food. Introduzione La vita commerciale dei prodotti alimentari è condizionata da molteplici fattori, quali ad esempio le caratteristiche dell'alimento, la tipologia di confezionamento e le condizioni di conservazione. La sicurezza alimentare è frutto dell'azione sinergica di tutti gli attori coinvolti nella filiera alimentare. Infatti, in tale contesto non è da sottovalutare il ruolo del consumatore che, una volta acquistato il prodotto, lo deve conservare secondo le indicazioni del produttore. In Europa, Australia, Nuova Zelanda, Stati Uniti e Canada oltre l'87% delle malattie alimentari ha, infatti, origine a livello domestico (Sharma et al., 2009). In ambiente casalingo, la conservazione dei prodotti deperibili ad una temperatura corretta risulta fondamentale; tuttavia, i dati raccolti nell'ambito di uno studio condotto nell'Italia centro-settentrionale hanno mostrato che nel 70% dei frigoriferi domestici la temperatura è superiore ai +4°C (Vergara et al., 2010). Di seguito sono presentati i dati preliminari di uno studio condotto su un formaggio porzionato e confezionato sottovuoto. Scopo del lavoro è valutarne le caratteristiche microbiologiche durante la shelf-life sia in condizioni di conservazione corretta (+4°C) sia in condizioni di abuso termico (+10°C). © M.Gramaglia et al.},

abstract={Lifting of the ban on the use of processed animal proteins (PAPs) from non-ruminants in non-ruminant feed is in the wind, avoiding intraspecies recycling. Discrimination of species will be performed through polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which is at a moment a merely qualitative method. Nevertheless, quantification of PAPs in feed is needed. The aim of this study was to approach the quantitative determination of PAPs in feed through Real Time (RT)-PCR technique; three different protocols picked up from the literature were tested. Three different kind of matrices were examined: pure animal meals (bovine, chicken and pork); one feed sample certified by the European reference laboratory on animal proteins (EURL AP) in feed spiked with 0.1% bovine meal; and genomic DNAs from bovine, chicken and pork muscles. The limit of detection (LOD) of the three protocols was set up. All the results obtained from the three protocols considered failed in the quantification process, most likely due to the uncertain copy numbers of the analytical targets chosen. This preliminary study will allow us to address further investigations, with the purpose of developing a RT-PCR quantitative method. Introduzione La decima revisione della seconda edizione di TSE roadmap II: a strategy paper on transmissible spongiform encephalopathies for 2010-2015 (Commissione Europea, 2010) riporta come uno degli obiettivi strategici la revisione del feed ban così come previsto ad oggi dalla legislazione europea, sollecitando la reintroduzione delle proteine animali trasformate (PAT) nell'alimentazione dei non-ruminanti. L'utilizzo delle PAT deve necessariamente evitare il riciclo intraspecie. La PCR, identificata dallo European reference laboratory (EURL) on animal proteins (AP) come la metodica di scelta per l'identificazione di specie, fornisce un risultato di tipo qualitativo (presenza/ assenza). L'impossibilità di distinguere tra cross-contaminazioni e possibili frodi commerciali in realtà costituisce un problema di grande rilevanza. In questo studio è stata esplorata la possibilità di utilizzare la real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) per la determinazione quantitativa delle proteine animali trasformate nei mangimi, saggiando tre differenti protocolli, tratti dalla letteratura, verificando i limiti di rivelabilità (LOD) per le differenti specie animali in farine e mangimi contaminati con PAT, e verificandone l'applicabilità in ambito quantitativo. © D.

abstract={Authentication of fish as fresh or frozenthawed is compulsory because of the widespread fraudulent practice of retailing fish products as fresh, when they have actually been frozen. Moreover, according to EC Regulations 853/2004 and 1276/2011, fish intended for raw consumption has to be deepfrozen before usage, to protect consumers against Anisakiasis. In this study, a food business operator set an example of good quality control by collaborating with health authorities and an official laboratory in charge of food control, to evaluate the feasibility of a further integrated regional plan on fish safety. Furthermore, differences in microscopic patterns related to freezing time complying (24 h) and not complying (12 h) with legislation in force were evaluated. Ten samples obtained from red and white-meat fish, and based on real production of the food business, were identified to evaluate the histological method performance in correctly classifying fish as fresh/frozen as well as the microbiological and chemical safety issues possibly related to fishery products. For two samples, species identification was needed. Based on the histological method, one out of ten fish was not fresh, though the supplier claimed all fish to be fresh; the others, after freezing, could be characterised microscopically as frozen and a borderline P-value was found between different freezing times. Microbiological parameters and species identification resulted compliant, while flesh from a tuna fish (Euthynnus alletteratus) contained mercury residues three times higher than the legally permitted level. Our results highlight the reliability of an integrated approach to control fishery products frauds. © G.B. Richelmi et al., 2013 Licensee PAGEPress, Italy.},

abstract={Listeria monocytogenes is a ubiquitous bacterium, widely distributed in the environment; morover, its ability to survive at low temperatures and form protective biofilms makes it colonise and persist in food processing plants. Epidemiological data provided by EFSA in 2009 show that ready-to-eat (RTE) food - in particular, soft and semi-soft cheese, and fishery and meat products subjected to heat treatment -represents the most likely contaminated foodstuff. For this reason, the European Commission has developed (Dec. 2010/678/EU) a monitoring plan designed to evaluate the prevalence of L. monocytogenes in these products. The programme, developed in detail with reference to each member state, involved, among others, the city of Turin and has been set out from June to December 2011. The aim of this paper is to report the results obtained in the city of Turin. In total, 160 samples were analysed; only samples of smoked fish were found to be positive, while the pathogen was absent in cheese and meat products. © A.

abstract={Following the diffusion of new eating habits (consumption of uncooked, undercooked, marinated or cold-smoked fish), some cases of parasitic zoonosis from freshwater fish are recently reappeared in Italy. One of these is tapeworm Diphyllobothrium latum, whose final host could be human. This study aimed to individuate the position of plerocercoid larvae inside perch fillets (Perca fluviatilis) caught in 4 different sites on Como lake in 2011. The fish analyzed were 390. The larvae totally isolated from 112 positive fishes were 164: 85 found in the right fillets and 79 in left ones. According to dorso-ventral disposition in fish, 144 larvae were individuated in dorsal muscles and 20 in ventral ones. Data collected confirm that plerocercoid larvae prefer the upper mass of perch muscle. Dietary education and sanitary care on fish supply are necessary to prevent the diffusion of tapeworm zoonosis in high-risk zones. European legislation establishes freezing to sanitize fish to be eaten raw, marinated or cold-smoked. © M. Prearo et al.},

abstract={17β-estradiol is the most powerful substance with estrogenic effect, commonly used as illegal growth promoter in livestock production. To avoid health risks for consumers, sensitive, reliable and low-cost methods for quantification of extremely low concentrations of such carcinogenic residues in food are needed. Antibody-immobilised microcantilever resonators were proposed as innovative biosensors able to quantify an adsorbed target mass thanks to a shift in resonance frequency. Furthermore, the quantification of masses on the order of few picograms has recently shown to be successfully achievable with very high precision. In this study, we analysed the performance of our microcantilever sensors using extracted samples of bovine muscle from experimental animals, containing variable concentrations of 17β-estradiol (HPLC-MS/MS tested). Preliminary data showed that treated animals are correctly revealed, exhibiting large negative frequency shifts. More experiments, though, are needed to obtain a correct quantification of 17β-estradiol concentration. © D. Pitardi et al.},

abstract={According to the European Community Regulation 1139/2003, a sampling plan based on an appropriate tests to detect the presence of central nervous system (CNS) tissue on the surface of the head muscles had to be implemented in each member state starting from 2003. In previous studies, we showed a medium CNS contamination in head meat from Italian slaughterhouses of 14,7%. Recently, German authors referred about alarming rates (82%) of CNS contamination in para-vertebral muscles after routine carcass splitting and spinal cord removal practices. In that context, the authors intended to assess the percentage of CNS contamination in muscles close to the vertebral column obtained by applying three different removal practices of specific risk material (SRM). Two alternative techniques, by sucking out and by water-jet, were compared to the traditional one; in both situations the removal of spinal cord occurred before the carcass splitting. The percentage of contamination resulted 62% applying the traditional technique, 60% with the sucking out system and 36% using the water-jet. The results show that water-jet ensures the most significant reduction of SRM contamination in para-vertebral meat as it guarantees a rapid and complete extraction of the spinal cord. © D.

In the present study, a liquid chromatography-high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS/MS) instrumental method was developed with a high resolution mass spectrometer (Orbitrap). Real samples of sausages in which caseins were detected by ELISA technique were analysed. A casein-free sample of ham was used as a blank. The analytical characteristics of the instrumental method were compared with those of a commercial ELISA test, declared specific for α- and β-casein. © D.

Residues of xanthophylls in muscle samples were determined by HPLC-MS/MS, reaching levels of 3.70 ± 0.04 mg/kg (astaxanthin) and 1.21 ± 0.06 mg/kg (canthaxanthin) during a 56 day administration period. On the basis of the average fish consumption in the human diet, the highest astaxanthin and canthaxanthin concentrations detected in trout fillets could result in weekly intakes of 1.63 and 0.53 mg, respectively, in humans; these values are not sufficient to achieve the positive effects described by many authors, but their residues could still represent an important source of carotenoids, alternative to the use of synthetic dietary supplements. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Mosquito-borne arboviruses (MBV) represent an important health problem, causing diseases and deaths both in human and animals mainly in tropical and subtropical countries. In recent years, they have emerged also in temperate regions where they have caused epidemics. Of mounting concern among public health authorities in Europe are zoonotic mosquito-borne viruses belonging to the Flavivirus genus. The aim of this study was to carry out active surveillance on mosquitoes in two regions of northwestern Italy (Liguria and Piedmont) to gain a better knowledge of the mosquito populations by identifying potential vectors of arboviruses and to investigate arbovirus infection. A network of 61 CO2 CDC traps was placed in the study area; sampling was conducted from May to October 2011. A total of 46 677 mosquitoes was collected, identified to species level, and classified according to their vector competence. Mosquitoes collected from 16 traps, selected according to risk-based factors, were tested by biomolecular analysis to detect flavivirus infection. This study highlights the importance of entomological surveillance in northwestern Italy because most of the mosquitoes collected were found to have high vector competence. Moreover, the risk-based virological surveillance allowed to detect the presence of mosquito flavivirus RNA, phylogenetically closely related to the MMV Spanish isolate, in three pools and USUV RNA in one pool in new areas where it has not been reported previously. The availability of continuous data on mosquito populations provides invaluable information for use in cases of an epidemic emergency. Maintenance of this integrated system for the next years will provide stronger data that can inform the design of a risk-based surveillance for the early detection of the occurrence of outbreaks of tropical MBDs. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

After a journey of 67 km (75 min) from the farmhouse of origin to the experimental station, ninety hens, divided according to breed, were free-range reared for two months. Body weight (BW), tonic immobility (TI), red and white blood cells, heterophil to lymphocyte (H/L) ratio and 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) were assessed at four different sampling times: at the farmhouse of origin (T1), at 1 day (T2), 15 days (T3) and at 2 months (T4) after arrival at the experimental station. No statistical differences were found between the four sampling times for BW, total red and white blood cells or for AGP. An increase in the H/L ratio (P<0.05) was recorded at time T2 for IBh and BSh, compared to BPh (P<0.05). TI was significantly higher (P<0.05) for the local breeds, BPh and BSh, than for the commercial strain IBh. The results of this study suggest that genetic and adaptive differences can affect both, physiological and ethological parameters. © M. De Marco et al., 2013.},

abstract={Bed bugs (Cimex lectularius) have been a common problem for humans for at least 3,500 years and in Europe their presence was endemic until the end of World War II, when infestations began to decrease. However, since the beginning of the 21st century new cases of infestations have been reported in developed countries. Many theories have been put forward to explain this change of direction, but none has been scientifically proven. The aim of this study is to provide some reports of bed bug infestations in Northern Italy (Liguria, Piedmont and Aosta valley regions) and a brief summary about their identification, clinical significance, bioecology and control. From 2008 to date, 17 bed bug infestations were identified in Northwest Italy. Knowledge about the presence and distribution of bed bugs in Italy is scanty, prior to this work only 2 studies reported the comeback of these arthropods in the Italian territory; further investigations would be necessary to better understand the current situation. © Istituto G.

abstract={Introduction and aim - This paper reports the results of microbiological analysis performed within the plan conducted against bovine mastitis in Aosta Valley Region during the period 2009-2011. The monitoring aimed at the detection of agents causing mammary gland infections, classically contagious bacteria (Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus) and environmental / opportunistic bacteria (principally coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococci and enterobacteria). Material and method - We tested 963 farms (for a total of 12429 cattle) in 2009, 808 farms (9710 cattle) in 2010 and 764 farms (10507 cattle) in 2011. Milk samples (corresponding to the pool of four quarters) were subjected to bacteriological exam using common media as Blood Agar, Baird- Parker - Rabbit Plasma Fibrinogen Agar, Tallium Kristalviolette Tossin Agar and Gassner Agar, with subsequent incubation at 37°C for 24 hours (48 h for BRP-RPF). The identification of isolates was confirmed, (in case of doubt and depending on the genus of the germ), by agglutination, CAMP test, biochemical tests (API Biomerieux Systems) and molecular tests (gene sequencing 16SrRNA), performed according to the routine methods. Each pathogen strain was analysed with Kirby-Bauer method to determine the pattern of sensitivity for the antibiotics mainly used in mastitis' therapy. Results and discussion - The prevalence of positive herds for Streptococcus agalactiae showed a favorable trend, rising from 28.8% in 2009 to 20.7% in 2010 to finally settle on the 18.2% in 2011. The prevalence of positive herds for Staphylococcus aureus was fairly stable during the monitoring period, with values of 39.1% in 2009, 32.4% in 2010, 38.5% in 2011. The data confirm the effectiveness of therapeutic and prophylactic actions carried out against the spread of Streptococcus agalactiae in the herds; instead about Staphylococcus aureus, the lack of a positive trend is probably related to the fact that the strains involved can be sometimes of environmental origin and therefore it's difficult their containment, as well as they frequently highlight a particular resistance (variable depending on the biotype / genotype) to conventional antibiotic therapies. In this regard, the most significant resistance, with more than 10% of the strains not sensitive, relate to the following molecules: cloxacillin, neomycin, and tetracycline for Streptococcus agalactiae, amoxicillin, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, ampicillin, penicillin, cloxacillin, tetracycline and cefoperazone for Staphylococcus aureus. With regard to environmental and opportunistic bacteria, coagulase-negative staphylococci and streptococci, in particular Streptococcus uberis and Streptococcus disgalactiae, are the most common pathogens in the herds not infected by Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus. Conclusions - In conclusion, the decrease of Streptococcus agalactiae diffusion, and also the need to contain the spread of Staphylococcus aureus, which is still present with significant prevalence, encourage the continuation of the program against infectious mastitis in the farms of Aosta Valley Region, integrating bacteriological monitoring, prophylaxys actions and pharmacological treatment.},

abstract={Interferon-alpha (IFN-α) shows potent immunomodulatory properties, which underlies its use for low-dose oral treatments of diverse viral infections and immunopathological conditions. The studies on oral administration have been hampered by the lack of recognized in vitro models, reproducing the in vivo control action of IFN-α over inflammatory cytokine responses. Owing to these reasons, the aim of our study was to validate IPEC-J2 (a continuous cell line of porcine intestinal epithelial cells) as a reporter system of the properties of IFN-α. Three different experimental conditions (oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and amplification of lymphoid cell signals) were selected to evaluate the effects of porcine recombinant IFN-α1 (rIFN-α) and 2 natural porcine IFN-α preparations (nIFN-α). The IFNs under study showed significantly different control actions in IPEC-J2 cells. In particular, rIFN-α was shown to down-regulate interleukin (IL)-8, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and β-defensin 1 genes either directly, or indirectly through second messengers released by IFN-α-treated lymphoid cells. With regard to IL-6, only second messengers from IFN-α-treated lymphoid cells could regulate the expression of this cytokine. Our results suggest that IPEC-J2 cells can be a useful tool for investigating the regulatory actions of type I IFNs and the second messengers thereof. The results provided by this model could be conveniently exploited in studies on enteric diseases sustained by infectious or noninfectious stressors. © 2013 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract={In Italy, since 2005 a breeding plan to increase scrapie resistance has been adopted. The impact of this selection on genetic diversity was assessed on Sambucana, an autochtonous sheep breed reared in southern Piedmont, by analysing the evolution of allele frequencies at different levels: PRNP (prion protein) gene, microsatellite loci on OAR13 (where PRNR maps), and microsatellite loci on other chromosomes, not subjected to selection for scrapie resistance. A total of 147 young rams, 80 born in 2004 and 67 in 2008-2009 were analysed. Evidence of diversity loss was observed for PRNP gene as a consequence of the directional selection. Diversity was affected in the immediate vicinity of PRNP but the effect on more distant loci on the same chromosome was trivial. With regard to neutral markers, lack of heterozygosis with no changeover of allele frequencies was observed suggesting an increase of inbreeding. Mating policies would be sufficient to solve these problems. A selection scheme based on genotyping rams and eliminating carriers of both susceptible and high susceptible alleles is the best way to improve natural resistance to scrapie with low costs and minimal problems in the current conservation programmes targeting rare breeds. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This study aims to investigate the occurrence of Anisakidae larvae (genera Anisakis and Hysterothylacium) in fishes and squids used for human nutrition and increase the knowledge of the distribution of Anisakidae larvae in this area of Mediterranean Sea. Distribution and correct identification of Anisakidae larvae in fish species is important for the assessment of their relative epidemiological role; especially when the fishes are of high commercial value and largely used in human nutrition. The study investigated the occurrence of Anisakidae larvae (genera Anisakis and Hysterothylacium) in 195 fishes owing to 22 different species and 60 squids (Illex coindetii) sampled in northern Ligurian Sea. A combination of morphological and PCR-RFLP methods have been used. A total of 177 anisakid larvae were isolated in 42/195 (21.5%) fish of 11 species and only one larva in one squid. These larvae were identified morphologically as belonging to the genera Anisakis (36/177) or Hysterothylacium (142/177). All Anisakis larvae were isolated from Trachurus trachurus and were identified at species level by PCR-RFLP as belonging to Anisakis pegreffii. Hysterothylacium sp. in short, larvae presence occurred in most of examined fish species with a higher density in Mullus barbatus (mean intensity 5.6 larvae) and Serranus scriba (MI 5.3). © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (NDL-PCBs) highly contribute to the PCB dietary intake of total PCBs. Most of the NDL-PCBs are assumed through ingestion of contaminated fish and fishery products. Therefore, it is important to quantify their presence in aquatic organisms to evaluate human risks associated with fish consumption. The European catfish is a top food-chain predator and is considered a reliable bio-monitoring tool reflecting the state of the environmental organic pollution. From 2006 to 2009, 54 European catfish were captured in four sites covering the area of the Po River (North Italy), and their muscles were analysed to determine the levels of 18 PCBs congeners. All samples presented detectable levels of 18 congeners and, on average, results showed an important presence of NDL-PCBs. The sum of the six congeners (28, 52, 101, 138, 153, 180 IUPAC) was used as indicator of the total PCBs concentration. The 33% of the samples analysed exceeded the maximum levels of 125ngg -1 set by European regulations in fish. The values measured ranged from 19.7 to 1015.4ngg -1 (mean 135.6±149.8ngg -1 ).The concentrations of NDL-PCBs were not related to fish weight or sex, while a significant variability was found among sites (p &lt; 0.05), according to the geographical location of many industrial activities in the catchment area of the Po River. PCB 153 and 138 were present in higher concentrations (40% and 30% respectively). We hypothesise that this is due to their high resistance to metabolic degradation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Raw milk consumption in Italy has increased over the past three years following the enactment of a national law that allows the sale of unpacked and unpasteurized cows' milk via vending machines on the farm and at markets. From 2009 to 2011, a three-part monitoring survey of raw milk sold though vending machines was carried out to investigate for the occurrence of Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli O:157, Campylobacter spp. and Listeria monocytogenes. A total of 618 raw milk samples were collected from 112 dairy herds supplying 131 raw milk vending machines. Of the samples tested, 0.3% were positive for Salmonella spp., 0.2% for E. coli O:157, 1.5% for Campylobacter spp., and 1.6% for Listeria monocytogens. Multivariate analysis showed no effect of seasonality, average daily temperature, herd size, sample collection point or distance between herd and vending machine; however, there was a statistically significant correlation between a previous finding of pathogens and recurrence of contamination. The monitoring survey results confirm that unpasteurized milk can be a vehicle of a variety of microorganisms and an important source of foodborne illness outbreaks. © 2013.},

abstract={Successful transmission of Transmissible Mink Encephalopathy (TME) to cattle supports the bovine hypothesis for the still controversial origin of TME outbreaks. Human and primate susceptibility to classical Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (c-BSE) and the transmissibility of L-type BSE to macaques indicate a low cattle-to-primate species barrier. We therefore evaluated the zoonotic potential of cattle-adapted TME. In less than two years, this strain induced in cynomolgus macaques a neurological disease similar to L-BSE but distinct from c-BSE. TME derived from another donor species (raccoon) induced a similar disease with even shorter incubation periods. L-BSE and cattle-adapted TME were also transmissible to transgenic mice expressing human prion protein (PrP). Secondary transmissions to transgenic mice expressing bovine PrP maintained the features of the three tested bovine strains (cattle TME, c-BSE and L-BSE) regardless of intermediate host. Thus, TME is the third animal prion strain transmissible to both macaques and humanized transgenic mice, suggesting zoonotic potentials that should be considered in the risk analysis of animal prion diseases for human health. Moreover, the similarities between TME and L-BSE are highly suggestive of a link between these strains, and therefore the possible presence of L-BSE for many decades prior to its identification in USA and Europe. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Background and aim: We identified a balanced de novo translocation involving chromosomes Xq25 and 8q24 in an eight year-old girl with a non-progressive form of congenital ataxia, cognitive impairment and cerebellar hypoplasia. Methods and Results: Breakpoint definition showed that the promoter of the Protein Tyrosine Kinase 2 (PTK2, also known as Focal Adhesion Kinase, FAK) gene on chromosome 8q24.3 is translocated 2 kb upstream of the THO complex subunit 2 (THOC2) gene on chromosome Xq25. PTK2 is a well-known non-receptor tyrosine kinase whereas THOC2 encodes a component of the evolutionarily conserved multiprotein THO complex, involved in mRNA export from nucleus. The translocation generated a sterile fusion transcript under the control of the PTK2 promoter, affecting expression of both PTK2 and THOC2 genes. PTK2 is involved in cell adhesion and, in neurons, plays a role in axonal guidance, and neurite growth and attraction. However, PTK2 haploinsufficiency alone is unlikely to be associated with human disease. Therefore, we studied the role of THOC2 in the CNS using three models: 1) THOC2 ortholog knockout in C.elegans which produced functional defects in specific sensory neurons; 2) Thoc2 knockdown in primary rat hippocampal neurons which increased neurite extension; 3) Thoc2 knockdown in neuronal stem cells (LC1) which increased their in vitro growth rate without modifying apoptosis levels. Conclusion: We suggest that THOC2 can play specific roles in neuronal cells and, possibly in combination with PTK2 reduction, may affect normal neural network formation, leading to cognitive impairment and cerebellar congenital hypoplasia.},

abstract={West Nile virus (WNV) was first isolated in Uganda. In Europe WNV was sporadically detected until 1996, since then the virus has been regularly isolated from birds and mosquitoes and caused several outbreaks in horses and humans. Phylogenetic analysis showed two main different WNV lineages. The lineage 1 is widespread and segregates into different subclades (1a-c). WNV-1a includes numerous strains from Africa, America, and Eurasia. The spatio-temporal history of WNV-1a in Europe was recently described, identifying two main routes of dispersion, one in Eastern and the second in Western Europe. The West Nile lineage 2 (WNV-2) is mainly present in sub-Saharan Africa but has been recently emerged in Eastern and Western European countries. In this study we reconstruct the phylogeny of WNV-2 on a spatio-temporal scale in order to estimate the time of origin and patterns of geographical dispersal of the different isolates, particularly in Europe. Phylogeography findings obtained from E and NS5 gene analyses suggest that there were at least two separate introductions of WNV-2 from the African continent dated back approximately to the year 1999 (Central Europe) and 2000 (Russia), respectively. The epidemiological implications and clinical consequences of lineage 1 and 2 cocirculation deserve further investigations. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Aims The misfolding and the aggregation of specific proteins are key features of neurodegenerative diseases, specifically Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs). In TSEs, neuronal loss and inflammation are associated with the accumulation of the misfolded isoform (PrPsc) of the cellular prion protein (PrPc). Therefore we tested the hypothesis that augmenting a natural anti-inflammatory pathway mediated by epoxygenated fatty acids (EpFAs) will delay lethality. EpFAs are highly potent but enzymatically labile molecules produced by the actions of a number of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Stabilization of these bioactive lipids by inhibiting their degradation mediated by the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) results in potent anti-inflammatory effects in multiple disease models. Main methods Mice were infected with the mouse-adapted RML strain of scrapie by intracerebral or intraperitoneal routes. Animals received the sEH inhibitor, by oral route, administrated in drinking water or vehicle (PEG400). Infected mice were euthanized at a standard clinical end point. Histopathological, immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses of brain tissue confirmed the presence of pathology related to prion infection. Key findings Oral administration of the sEHI did not affect the very short survival time of the intracerebral prion infection group. However, mice infected by intraperitoneal route and treated with t-AUCB survived significantly longer than the control group mice (p &lt; 0.001). Significance These findings support the idea that inhibition of sEH or augmentation of the natural EpFA signaling in the brain offers a potential and different route to understand prion diseases and may become a therapeutic strategy for diseases involving neuroinflammation. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={17β-Oestradiol is a steroid hormone banned as a growth promoter in food-producing animals all over Europe because of its carcinogenicity. Despite mandatory monitoring of illegal treatment all over Europe, official analytical methods in use test negative a few days after 17β-oestradiol administration, requiring new sensitive tools to ensure a high level of protection for consumers. The aim of this work was the evaluation of the accuracy of histopathology and immunohistochemistry for progesterone receptor (PR) as a screening method for the detection of low-dosage illegal treatments with 17β-oestradiol. Fresian male calves (153) were farmed under controlled conditions, and 89 of them were treated with 17β-oestradiol (5 mg/animal once a week for 4 weeks). After 15 days of suspension, all animals were slaughtered and sexual accessory glands (prostate and bulbo-urethral glands) were sampled for histological examination and immunohistochemical staining with anti-PR antibody (clone hPRa 2). Microscopically 86 out of 89 bulbo-urethral glands showed mild to severe metaplasia, while mild metaplasia was observed only in 1 control. Eighteen out of 89 samples of prostate did not show metaplastic lesions. Immunopositivity for PR characterised all treated animals, while no signal was detected in controls. These findings show that metaplasia of the sexual accessory glands is a sensitive and specific parameter for illegal 17β-oestradiol treatment in calves at the slaughterhouse, while the appliance of immunohistochemistry for PR can improve to 100% the accuracy of this highly reliable histological approach. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Introduction - Dioxins are a family of organic micro-pollutants, highly toxic to man, able to persist long time in the environment, accumulate in the fat of humans and animals, and thus enter the food chain. The cell bioassay DR-CALUX (Dioxin Responsive Chemically Activated Luciferase Gene Expression), based on the mechanism of uptake of cellular receptor AhR for dioxins and dioxin-like compounds, is a method that has spread in recent years in many countries, as test of choice for screening of food, because of the relatively short run times and reduced costs compared to the confirmatory method, the high resolution gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS). Aim - The purpose of this paper is to assess the applicability of the BDS-DR-CALUX® method as a screening tool for the monitoring of dioxins in milk produced in the Piedmont region, verifying the reliability compared to the data obtained through the official confirmatory method. Materials and method - Thirteen raw milk samples, previously examined by HRGC/HRMS, coming from a contaminated site near a steelworks in the area of Susa Valley, and 30 milk samples coming from the market distribution, were subjected to extraction of fats and subsequent purification into silica columns. For the dioxins determination, genetically modified hepatoma cells were cultured and incubated in 96 well plates and then left in contact for 24 hours with the extracts of the samples. Luminescence was measured with a chemiluminometer, exploiting the interaction mechanism between luciferine and luciferase. Results and discussion - The results obtained showed good infraclass correlation between the traditional method and the BDS-DR-CALUX®, in milk, a common food, especially in childhood nutrition, and used for further transformations. BDS -DR-CALUX® and chemical method can be considered as two valid systems to be used in series and are able to provide comparable results with regard to the relative quantification of dioxins: DR-CALUX gives a biological response of total mixture and allow to discriminate in advance through samples, which don't require an additional method of confirmation, and suspect samples, which will need to be confirmed by HRGC/HRMS, while HRGC/HRMS provides the concentration of specific chemical compounds in the mixture. Conclusions - BDS-DR-CALUX®, therefore, is confirmed as a valid screening method for milk, quick, fast, relatively cheap and able to allow a much broad monitoring of any areas potentially at risk for the population. Therefore the method allows for environmental monitoring and epidemiology of a high number of samples and test the contamination levels of dioxin in the food chain.},

abstract={Kidney diseases as protein-losing nephropathies are predisposing conditions for thrombosis/ thromboembolism in dogs due to increased blood coagulability. The aim of this study was to use thromboelastometry for investigation of changes in haemostasis in dogs affected by renal proteinuria alone or concomitant with azotemia. The study was done at 55 client-owned, healthy (n = 34), proteinuric (n = 14), and proteinuric/azotemic (n = 7) dogs. Blood coagulation was assessed by means of standard coagulation profile and thromboelastometry (in-TEM, ex-TEM, and fib-TEM). In proteinuric dogs only the maximum clot firmness and maximum clot elasticity significantly increased (P < 0.05), whereas in the proteinuric/azotemic dogs the thromboelastometric profiles showed a pronounced increase of blood coagulability, as indicated by significant changes (P < 0.05) of the variables clotting time, clot formation time, α angle, maximum clot firmness and maximum clot elasticity. After correction for group affiliation, the linear regression analysis showed a non significant association between changes in proteinuria and thromboelastometric profiles. In conclusion, thromboelastometric changes indicating hypercoagulabilty were more consistently found in the dogs with proteinuria/azotemia, than in those with proteinuria alone, suggesting that the former dogs can be considered at higher thrombotic risk. This is the first study where thromboelastometry has been applied to the investigation of haemostatic changes in dogs with kidney diseases.},

abstract={Prednisolone is a synthetic corticosteroid acting on both hydrosaline balance and metabolism that is liable to fraudulent administration to meat-producing animals for growth-promoting purposes. Its use outside strict therapeutic control and prescription is banned by the European legislation, but official controls are hampered by its negligible direct excretion into the urinary matrix. Recent studies reported on a potential endogenous origin of prednisolone in animals subjected to stressful conditions, accounting for its occasional detection in control urines. The objective of the present study was the identification and quantification of prednisolone urinary metabolites to be used as illicit treatment biomarkers in place of the parent drug. An LC-MS/MS screening was conducted on urine samples collected from a bullock intramuscularly administered with prednisolone acetate by using a therapeutic protocol (2 × 0.52 mg kg-1 at 48-hour interval). Four prednisolone metabolites were identified: 20β-dihydroprednisolone, 20α-dihydroprednisolone, 6β-hydroxyprednisolone and 20β-dihydroprednisone; the first was detected at relatively high concentrations. An existing quantitative LC-MS/MS method was expanded and revalidated to include these metabolites. The new analytical method proved sensitive (LODs: 0.35-0.42 ng mL-1) and specific and was applied to urine samples collected from eight beef cattle subjected to low-dosage oral administration of prednisolone acetate for a 35-day period, as in standard growth-promoting treatments. 20β-Dihydroprednisolone was detected in all urine samples collected during the treatment, at relatively high concentration (1.2-27 ng mL-1), whereas the prednisolone concentration was virtually negligible (&lt;0.7 ng mL-1). 20β-Dihydroprednisolone was no longer present in almost all samples collected 6 days after the end of the treatment, but trace amounts of this metabolite were found in two urine samples from control animals. 20β-Dihydroprednisolone is proposed as an effective biomarker to test illegal growth-promoting treatments with prednisolone in meat cattle, alternatively to the parent drug. © 2013 Copyright Taylor &amp; Francis.},

abstract={Norovirus (NoV) are increasingly important as etiological agents of gastrointestinal infections. Consumption of bivalve molluscs and ready-to-eat fishery products is one of the most common ways of acquiring NoV foodborne infections, and the rise of outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis represents an important health problem that is also responsible for economic losses. The aim of this work was to define the prevalence of NoV contamination in preserved fishery products and in shellfish commercialized in Italy, taking into account the results obtained during 9 years of survey (2003-2011) and paying special attention to the regions more involved in national production. A total of 4463 samples were examined (2310 mussels, 1517 clams, 510 oysters, 22 other shellfish species, 104 preserved seafood products) and the average positivity rate for NoV presence was 4.1% and ranged from 0.6% in 2007 to 9.8% in 2003 and from 1.9% in preserved seafood products to 4.7% in mussels. Genetic characterization of circulating strains showed a prevalence of genogroup II genotypes, including GII.b and GII.e polymerase types and different GII.4 variants. This information could contribute to the optimization of risk-based sampling strategies for NoV contamination in seafood, taking into account variability in different species and from year to year. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract={In this study, we compared a rapid immunochromatographic test (Speed Leish K; BVT Groupe Virbac, La Seyne sur Mer, France) with an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFAT) and Western blotting (WB) for the detection of Leishmania infantum antibodies in dogs. A total of 250 serum samples were collected from 125 L. infantum-positive and 125 L. infantum-negative dogs. Among the positive samples, 81 were strongly positive at low IFAT dilutions, while 44 were low-reactivity sera (IFAT titers, 1:40 to 1:80). The sensitivity and specificity of the Speed Leish K were 96.3% and 100%, respectively, compared with those of the IFAT. When IFAT low-reactivity sera (titers, 1:40 or 1:80) were tested with the Speed Leish K, using WB results as a reference, the sensitivities were 93.75% for sera with a 1:80 titer and 73.33% for sera with a 1:40 titer, and the specificity was 100%. The Speed Leish Kis easy to use and performs well, so it can be considered a quick and reliable tool for the diagnosis of L. infantum infection in dogs.

abstract={Listeriosis is a disease that causes significant economic losses at the farm level because of high morbidity and mortality in ruminants. This study was performed to investigate the role of ruminants in the epidemiology of listeriosis in northern Italy and the possible association of animal-adapted strains of Listeria monocytogenes with strains associated with human disease. Twenty ruminant rhombencephalitis isolates previously confirmed as L. monocytogenes by bacteriology and PCR were characterized by serotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, multi-virulence-locus sequence typing (MVLST), and multiplex single nucleotide polymorphism (mSNP) typing for the detection of epidemic clones. Subtyping results were subsequently compared with those obtained from human, food, and environmental isolates of L. monocytogenes, including 311 isolates from the University of Turin, Grugliasco, Italy, and 165 isolates representing major human listeriosis outbreaks worldwide, in addition to other unrelated isolates. Both mSNP typing and MVLST showed that 60% of the isolates analyzed belonged to epidemic clone I (ECI), which has been epidemiologically linked to several human outbreaks of listeriosis. In particular, the 1981 Canada outbreak was linked to the use of sheep manure and the 1985 California outbreak was linked to the use of raw cow's milk. In our study, ECI isolates were collected from different ruminant species on geographically and temporally distinct occasions for the last 13 years. Our results support the hypothesis that ruminants represent possible natural reservoirs of L. monocytogenes strains capable of causing epidemics of listeriosis in humans. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.},

abstract={In recent years a significant increase in food supplements consumption has been observed, maybe in the belief that they couldn't be dangerous for consumers health, even if they don't achieved medical effects. However, environmental pollution can cause heavy metals contamination that could exceed maximum levels established by European legislation. Aim of this work was to evaluate arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead and mercury content in 12 food supplements seized in a Piedmont shop by the Italian authority against food adulteration. All metals were analysed after mineralization and dilution steps by ICP-MS, with the exception of mercury, detected by the direct analyser TDA-AAS. Only one sample exceed the European maximum limits for lead (3,00 mg/kg) but warning levels of chromium (over 3,00 mg/Kg) has been detected in three of them. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2013.},

abstract={Salmonella is an important zoonotic pathogen of economic importance. In Europe, salmonellosis is the second food-borne infection, in Italy, Salmonella is still the major cause of food-borne outbreaks. In Europe, there are many Salmonella surveillance plans on farmed animals, while Salmonella survey of wild animals is occasionally performed. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of Salmonella including the antibiotic-resistant strains in wild animals. Between 2002 and 2010, 2,713 wild animals (canids, mustelids, birds, rodents, ungulates), were collected in north-western Italy and tested for Salmonella by classical microbiological culture method followed by serological and biochemical typing. One hundred and seventeen wild animals (63 canids, 25 mustelids, 24 birds, 5 ungulates) were found positive for Salmonella (4.3%). One hundred and thirty strains, belonging to several serotypes were isolated, and S. Typhimurium was the most common serotype found. Antibiotic susceptibility was tested by disk-diffusion test on 88 strains. Almost all the analyzed strains (97.7%) showed resistance/intermediate resistance to at least one class of antibiotics and the highest resistance values were observed for the tetracycline class. In conclusion, zoonotic and antibiotic-resistant serotypes were found in many species of wildlife.},

abstract={Following the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) epidemics across Europe in the early 1990s, the removal of designated BSE specified risk material (SRM) became mandatory to minimize the risk of consumer's exposure to the infectious agent. Despite this preventive measure, cross-contamination of edible meat with SRM can occur during conventional slaughter, primarily by carcass splitting, captive bolt stunning, and head removal. BSE-affected subjects accumulate the pathological feature in the central nervous system (CNS). Currently, there are no markers that can identify the presence of SRM in meat as a whole. Nevertheless, some assays are able to detect traces of CNS, hence this parameter is officially taken as indicative of SRM contamination. In this two-stage study, we carried out a survey to estimate the prevalence of carcass contamination at two slaughterhouses, one large and the other medium-sized; we then compared three different methods (conventional vs. suction vs. water-jet) for spinal cord removal employed at the large slaughterhouse to assess their performance in preventing the spread of central nervous tissue (CNT) over the carcass. The prevalence of carcass contamination was 68.4%. Compared to the other two spinal cord removal techniques (conventional and suction), the water-jet system was associated with less CNS contamination (62 vs. 60 vs. 36%, respectively; P = 0.0047). © 2012.},

abstract={Background: The illegal administration of hormones, steroids, β-agonists and other anabolic agents to productive livestock in the European Union continues, despite the long-term ban on their use and despite the measures provided under the directives to monitor certain substances and residues thereof in the interest of protecting consumer health and animal wellbeing. Often administered in low doses in the form of a drug cocktail, these compounds escape detection by common analytical techniques. The aim of this study was to determine whether low-dose dexamethasone administration (0.4 mg orally per day, for 20 days) in white-meat calves produced variations in blood coagulation, as measured by thromboelastometry. A second aim was to determine whether such variations could be valid in detecting illicit low-dose dexamethasone treatment.Results: The study population was 42 Friesian calves kept under controlled conditions until 6 months of age. The calves were subdivided into 2 groups: a control group (group A, n = 28) and a group treated with dexamethasone (group B, n = 14) for 20 days beginning at 5 months of age. When compared against the age-matched control group, the dexamethasone-treated calves showed a significant increase in alpha angle, maximum clot firmness and a significant decrease in clot formation time on all thromboelastometric profiles (P < 0.05). The clotting time was significantly decreased on the in-TEM® profile but increased on the ex-TEM® and fib-TEM® profiles (P <0.05). The Receiver Operating Characteristic curves, plotted for the Maximum Clot Elasticity (MCE), had a cut-off value ≥488.23 mm for in-TEM® MCE [Se 85.7%, (95% CI 57.2-98.2); Sp 100% 96.43% (95% CI 81.7-99.9] and a cut-off value ≥63.94 mm for fib-TEM® MCE [Se 92.8 (95% CI 66.1-99.8); Sp 89.3% (95% CI 71.8-97.7)]. In order to increase the sensitivity of the test two parameters (in-TEM® and fib-TEM® MCE) were used as two parallel tests; subsequently, the sensitivity rose to a point value of 99% (95% CI 85.4-99.9).Conclusions: Thromboelastometry identified a state of hypercoagulability in the dexamethasone-treated subjects. Furthemore, the results of this preliminary study suggest that TEM may be useful in the detection of illicit low-dose dexamethasone treatment. © 2013 Borrelli et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Caprine herpesvirus 1 (CpHV1) is a member of ruminant alphaherpesviruses antigenically related to the prototype bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV1). Although cross reactivity between the two viruses involves many structural glycoproteins, the use of two competitive BoHV1 ELISAs detecting anti gB and gE antibodies has been proposed for CpHV1 infection, resulting mainly in a gB+/gE- reactivity and leading to suppose that CpHV1 gE may represent an useful target for the development of specific diagnostic test. Since CpHV1 gE gene has been only partially characterized so far, in this study the genome fragment of the short unique unit (Us) encompassing gI and gE gene was amplified and sequenced. Gene fragments encoding the ectodomain of both glycoproteins were subcloned into pSECTag2/Hygro and expressed in HEK293T cells as secreted form in serum free medium. Due to the lack of specific monoclonal antibodies (Mabs), the same recombinant glycoproteins were obtained from BoHV1 and used as positive control with a panel of specific gE and gI Mabs as well as in some ELISA assays. Results clearly indicate that the ectodomain of CpHV1 gE, immobilized on solid face in an indirect ELISA format, represents a sensitive and specific marker of infection, when compared with neutralization test, with absence of very low degree of cross-reactivity with BoHV1 gE counterpart, while the use of CpHV1 gI-ELISA or a combination of gE/gI complex did not significantly improve the sensitivity of the assay. In addition, in the rare event in which cross species barrier occurs for both viruses from their natural host to other species, the use of both BoHV1 and CpHV1 gE in a comparative assay may be proposed. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Between June and September 2010, widespread Italian consumer reports of unusual blue spoilage on fresh dairy products were publicized, resulting in the so-called blue mozzarella event. An inordinately high number of samples from mozzarella and whey cheese products of Italian and German production subsequently tested positive for Pseudomonas fluorescens. The aim of this study was to verify whether a selected P. fluorescens strain was responsible for this apparently unusual event. Molecular characterization of 181 isolated P. fluorescens strains was conducted using a newly optimized pulsed-field gel electrophoresis protocol. Although a high number of pulsotypes was found (132), only four pulsotypes were associated with more than one production plant, and only one German isolate had the same pulsotype as was detected in two Italian plants. This is the only evidence of possible cross-contamination among cheeses from the two countries. The overall results did not support the spread of contamination from German to Italian plants or the presence of one environmental strain that spread in both countries.

abstract={Mercury (Hg) settlements in the Mediterranean Sea determine a potential toxicological relevance of seafood intakes for coastal populations. To assess this possibility, fish, molluscs, and crustaceans of commercial size of 69 different species were sampled and analyzed for total mercury (HgTOT) from georeferenced areas and evaluated for their compliance with the European Union Maximum Residue Limits of 0.5 and 1.0mg/kgwet weight (ww). Accounting for the weekly estimated seafood intake in the Italian coastal population (mean 469-626g/person/week) it was then possible to recover threshold contamination values in seafood. Under a Tolerable Weekly Intake of 1.3μg/kg/bw/week, a threshold seafood contamination &lt;0.10mg/kgww has been derived for sensitive groups. A suitable algorithm based on the parallel MeHg and HgTOT analysis on the most consumed species, helped to refine the uncertainties related to the conservative assumption in seafood all the HgTOT present is in form of MeHg. This work aims to improve the link between the risk management and risk assessment strategies, with the identification of those fish and seafood species, that, when regularly consumed, could determine or prevent potential HgTOT/MeHg overintakes in sensitive groups. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={In order to investigate the prevalence of urinary tract infections (UTI) in sow, lower urinary tract (LUT), kidney and urine samples were collected at slaughterhouse from 65 multiparous culled sows. Histopathology was performed on urethra, urinary bladder and kidney sections. Urine collected by cystocentesis was analysed for physical and biochemical parameters, in addition to microscopic examination of the sediment and quantitative culture (&gt;105 CFU/ml urine). The diagnostic accuracy of urinalysis and urine culture was calculated for the parameters that correlated with histological diagnosis: bilateral chronic lesions were found in 54 per cent of kidney samples and diffuse/ multifocal lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the submucosa in 53 per cent of the bladder and 68 per cent of the urethra samples. In 49 per cent of cases, the co-occurrence of bladder and urethra lesions was statistically significant (P&lt;0.009). Turbid urine (80 per cent sensitivity, 50 per cent specificity), &gt;5 white blood cells per high-power field (34 per cent sensitivity, 90 per cent specificity), intracellular or free bacteria (43 per cent sensitivity, 90 per cent specificity), and urine culture (49 per cent sensitivity, 97 per cent specificity) correlated with a finding of histopathological changes in the bladder. UTI appears to be common in culled sows in northern Italy. Compared with histopathology, urinalysis and urine culture showed low sensitivity but high specificity in detecting UTI.},

abstract={To date control strategies in detecting anabolic agents for promoting growth of food producing animals are mainly related to screening techniques based on immunochemical and physiochemical methods, whose major limit is represented by relative low analytical sensitivity. As a consequence, consumers are currently exposed to molecules with potential carcinogenic effects such as 17Β-estradiol, the most powerful substance with estrogenic effect. Therefore, high analytical sensitivity screening and confirmatory methods are required, coupling easiness of use and efficiency. We here report on the immunodetection of 17Β-estradiol in serum by antibody-immobilized microcantilever resonators, an innovative biosensing platform able to quantify an adsorbed target mass (such as cells, nucleic acids, biomolecules, etc.) thanks to a shift in resonance frequency. Our tool based on microcantilever resonator arrays has shown to be capable of discriminating treated and untreated animals, showing the ability of detecting traces of 17Β-estradiol in serum at concentrations lower than the present accepted physiological serum concentration threshold value (40. ppt) and commercial ELISA tests (25. ppt). The method exhibits a limit of detection of 20. ppt and a limited cross-reactivity with high concentrations (10. ppb) of similar molecules (testosterone). © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The animal presented neurological signs characterized by weakness, incoordination and recumbency. Histopathologic evaluation of brain tissue revealed multifocal microabscesses, perivascular lymphocytic cuffing, vasculitis, oedema and haemorrhages. All lesions extended from the medulla oblongata to the basal nuclei/parietal cortex area. Indirect immunohistochemistry labelled for Listeria sp. in the brain tissue, but not for Listeria monocytogenes, neurotropic Flaviviruses, BVDV, bovine Herpesvirus 1, Chlamydophila spp. and Histophilus somni. PCR was negative for ovine herpesvirus. L. innocua was isolated from brainstem and identified by biochemical tests (Camp and beta-hemolysis negative).

abstract={It has been previously demonstrated that the progesterone receptor gene is up-regulated in the sex accessory glands of pre-pubertal and adult male bovines after 17β-oestradiol treatment. In the present study, a qualitative screening method was optimised to detect 17β-oestradiol treatment using absolute quantification by qPCR of the progesterone receptor gene to determine the amount of gene expression in bulbo-urethral glands. An external standard curve was generated and developed with TaqMan® technology. Based on two in vivo experiments, the decision limit CCα, sensitivity and specificity of this screening method were established. Trial 1 consisted of 32 Friesian veal calves divided into two groups: group A (n = 12), consisting of animals treated with four doses of 17β-oestradiol (5 mg week-1 per animal); and group B (n = 20), consisting of control animals. Trial 2 was performed on 26 Charolaise beef cattle that either received five doses of 17β-oestradiol (group C; 20 mg week-1 per animal; n = 6) or remained untreated (group D; n = 20). Further, progesterone receptor gene expression was evaluated in beef and veal calves for human consumption. A specific CCα on 20 Piedmontese control beef cattle was calculated to include these animals in a field investigation. Five out of 190 beef cattle and 26 out of 177 calves tested expressed the progesterone receptor gene above their respective CCα and they were classified as being suspected of 17β-oestradiol treatment. Additionally, 58% of veal calves that tested suspect via qPCR exhibited histological lesions of the bulbo-urethral gland tissue, which are typical of oestrogen administration and are consistent with hyperplasia and metaplasia of the glandular epithelium. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={As part of the bovine mastitis control program conducted in the Aosta Valley Region (Italy) in the period 2009- 2011, 574 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae and 933 strains of Staphylococcus aureus were isolated. All strains were analyzed for antimicrobial susceptibility by the Kirby-Bauer method, based on the evaluation of the inhibition zones around the following compounds: Amoxicillin, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cephalexin, cephalothin, cefoperazone, cefuroxime, cloxacillin, enrofloxacin, neomycin, cloxacillin, penicillin, spiramycin, streptomycin, tetracycline and thiamphenicol. For Streptococcus agalactiae the most significant resistance (> 10 % of not-sensitive strains) concerned cloxacillin (54.6 %), neomycin (81.4 %) and tetracycline (25.5 %), while for Staphylococcus aureus it concerned amoxicillin (41.7 %), amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (40.2 %), ampicillin (41.8 %), penicillin (41.4 %), cloxacillin (42.6 %), tetracycline (13.9 %) and cefoperazone (15.2 %). Given the high levels of resistance against beta-lactam antibiotics and - Through these - especially natural and semi-synthetic penicillins (or rather the molecules most frequently indicated for the pharmacological treatment of mammary infections), regular monitoring of the susceptibility of udder pathogens bacteria to this category of antimicrobials appears essential for success of a mastitis control program in the geographical area considered by our study.},

abstract={The accumulation of heavy metals in freshwaters has direct consequences to man and ecosystem. Thus, in this study, the concentrations of mercury, cadmium, lead, arsenic and chromium in organs of the predator European catfish (Silurus glanis) were investigated. Samples were collected annually in five sites covering the area of the Po River (North Italy) between 2007 and 2009.Metals were differently distributed in the various organs, the highest concentrations of Hg were found in muscle and liver, Cd in kidney, Pb in gill and liver, as in muscle, and of Cr in gill and liver. Our survey found Hg exceeding the Maximum Levels (MLs) of 0.5. ppm in 18% of samples, while Pb and Cd were lower than the MLs set by European regulations in muscle tissues (1881/2006/EC and 629/2008/EC). Hg concentrations were significantly related to sampling stations studied, according to the presence of many industrial activities in the catchment area of Bormida and Tanaro Rivers. The finding that Hg did not fit food fish legislation limits indicated that S. glanis flesh might not be utilised for human consumption. A close monitoring of metals pollution is strongly recommended especially in piscivorous fish, cause their bioaccumulation capacity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The illicit use of dexamethasone as growth-promoting agent in animal breeding is still practiced within the EU constituting a health risk for meat consumers. An experimental study was developed to assess dexamethasone urinary excretion and tissue distribution (liver, kidney, and muscle) in male calves after therapeutic and growth-promoting administration. Urine and tissue samples collected from treated and untreated bovines were also investigated for the presence of other natural and synthetic corticosteroids (prednisolone, prednisone, hydrocortisone, and cortisone), in order to study a possible correlation with dexamethasone administration and to clarify prednisolone origin. Analyses were performed by a multi-residue LC-MS/MS method developed and validated according to the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. The results confirm the rapid rate of dexamethasone urinary excretion, irrespective of the dosage, the duration and the route of administration, and the disappearance of cortisone and hydrocortisone during the treatment. Dexamethasone was distributed to the tissues where the elimination rate proceeded relatively slower as suggested by the presence of residues one month after the withdrawal of the therapeutic treatment. An increase in the number of positive findings for prednisolone, in association with higher levels of cortisone and hydrocortisone, was observed in urine samples collected from slaughterhouse rather than those collected at the farm. Prednisone residues were found only in one urine sample that showed the highest levels of prednisolone, hydrocortisone, and cortisone. The occurrence of prednisolone residues in urine and even in tissue samples confirms the endogenous nature of this molecule. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Control programs have been implemented in many countries at regional and even at national level. To estimate PTB prevalence in dairy herds in the Piedmont Region a survey was carried out between January 2007 and June 2008. Random samples from 1531 dairy herd representing 63% of the target population were selected and bulk tank milk samples were tested for the presence of PTB antibodies using a commercially available absorbed ELISA test kit, 3 times a year. Estimated seroprevalence in dairy herds corrected for sensitivity and specificity was found to be 21.75% (CI95%: 19.3%-23.3%).. These results underlined the need for a control plan for PTB in the Piedmont Region.},

abstract={Listeria monocytogenes is an important cause of zoonosis (listeriosis) and is responsible for foodrelated illness ranging from gastroenteritis to meningitis. Listeriosis is transmitted to humans through contaminated foods, such as raw milk. In Italy most of the milk consumed daily is heat treated, however since in 2007, the Ministry of Health authorized automatic vending machines delivering unpacked raw cow milk, the consumption of liquid raw milk increased. To date, there are 1032 dairy herds allowed to supply raw milk to vending machines (Integrated National Annual Report of the Italian Ministry of Health), 112 of them (about 10%) are registered in the Piedmont Region.In this study, the presence of Listeria monocytogenes in raw milk from bulk tanks in farms and from raw milk vending machines in North Western Italy (Piedmont Region) was investigated. Between July 2010 and July 2011, 407 samples of raw milk were collected from 112 vending machines or from the 93 farms supplying vending machines and were analyzed. Listeria monocytogenes was isolated from 7 out of 407 milk specimens (1.72%; CI95%:0.7%-3.5%): 3/93 were isolated from farms (3.23%; CI95%: 0.7%- 9.1%) and 4/112 from vending machines (3.6%; CI95%: 0.9%-8.9%). The serotypes most frequently isolated were 1/2 a and 4b/4e. These results outline the importance of the advice « to be boiled before drinking » that Italian Ministry of Health made compulsory on the vending machines to inform consumers. Heat treatment of raw milk still remains the most effective tool to reduce the risk of listeriosis and other food-borne illness.},

A total of 13.533 samples (12.050 samples from domestically slaughtered animals; 1.183 samples from game meat; 300 samples from wild reservoir animals) were analyzed according to the methods described in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2075/2005. Four samples from wild animals (foxes) were found to be positive for Trichinella spp. No samples from domestically slaughtered animals were found to be contaminated by Trichinella spp, confirming that the herd system effectively prevents contact between wild and domestic animals and thus protects herds from the infection.},

A questionnaire survey was carried out involving the local contact points dealing with wildlife diagnostic activity in the Italian Istituti Zooprofilattici Sperimentali (IIZZSS). Data from 20 out of 21 regions were collected in the summer of 2011. Both passive and active surveillance programs are conducted in most regions but planned monitoring in only half of them. Standardized forms for data collection are used in 8 regions only and automated data sharing procedures are available in 14. Large amounts of data are being collected but this activity is regarded as too time-consuming. Moreover the final data are incomplete as not all data sources may be used. A new IS appears desirable.},

abstract={Objective: To assess the effects of in vitro hemodilution of canine blood with a low molecular weight hy-droxyethyl starch (HES 130/0.4) by means of thromboelastometry (TEM). Design: In vitro experimental study. Setting: University Teaching Hospital. Animals: Ten healthy adult staff-owned dogs were sampled for the purposes of the study. Samples were also collected from 45 clinically normal dogs to establish thromboelastometric reference intervals. Interventions: For each dog whole blood was collected by jugular venipuncture and placed into tubes containing 3.8% trisodium citrate and stored at 37°C. Two standard dilutions (1:4 and 1:10) from canine blood specimens were prepared with HES 130/0.4 and saline 0.9%. Measurements and Main Results: The effects of dilution were studied by TEM. No statistically significant differences were observed between the TEM values of the control samples and the samples diluted with saline solution (ratio 1:10 and 1:4). In contrast, hypocoagulability was observed in the samples treated with HES 130/0.4, with more severe effects at 1:4 dilution than at 1:10 dilution. The 1:4 dilution with HES 130/0.4 produced marked alterations: CT (P = 0.035) and CFT (P = 0.0007) on the ex-TEM profile, CT (P = 0.0005) and ML (P = 0.0017) on the fib-TEM profile and CFT (P = 0.0043) on the in-TEM, were all significantly increased (P < 0.05), whereas MCF (P = 0.0042) and alpha angle (P = 0.002) on the in-TEM and MCF (P = 0.011) and alpha angle (P = 0.001) ex-TEM profiles and MCF (P = 0.0001) on the fib-TEM profile were significantly decreased (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Dilution of canine blood with HES 130/0.4 results in a thromboelastometric pattern consistent with hypocoagulation and this effect appears to result from a dose-dependent alteration in fibrinogen concentration and inhibition of platelet function. As this is an in vitro study, further in vivo investigations are necessary to confirm the results. © Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society 2012.},

abstract={Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid widely employed in bovine clinical practice that may also be used illegally as a growth promoter. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies lend support to the hypothesis that prednisolone could be synthesised from cortisol in untreated cattle subjected to stressful events. To verify such a hypothesis, a field survey was conducted on urine samples collected from 131 guaranteed untreated cows and analysed for the presence of prednisolone and prednisone - in some instances also for cortisol and cortisone - with a validated LC/MS-MS method. None of the examined samples exhibited either prednisolone levels higher than the CCα limit (around 0.70 μg l-1) or prednisone, being therefore officially compliant for both analytes. Trace amounts of prednisolone, approximately estimated in the range 0.1-0.3 μg l-1 were found in only seven samples from cows also showing urinary cortisol and cortisone levels higher than those detected in negative specimens, as the result of a probable stress condition. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Abstract. A sudden increase in the incidence of scrapie in Italy in 1997 was subsequently linked to the use of a potentially infected vaccine against contagious agalactia. The relative risk for the exposed farms ranged between 6 and 40. The aim of this study was to assess the long-term impact of exposure to the potentially scrapie-contaminated vaccine on the Italian classical scrapie epidemic. We carried out a retrospective cohort study, fitting mixed-effects Poisson regression models, dividing national geographic areas into exposure categories on the basis of the vaccine circulation levels. We took into account the sensitivity of the surveillance system applied in the different areas. The population attributable fraction (PAF) was used to assess the impact on the total population of farms associated with the effect of circulation of the vaccine. The provinces where the vaccine was more often sold were noted to have a higher level of disease when compared to those provinces where the vaccine was sold less often (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-6.5). The population attributable fraction was high (68.4%). Standardization techniques allowed to account for the potential of geographical variability in the sensitivity of the Italian surveillance system. Although the number of the directly exposed farms was limited, an important long-term impact of the vaccine circulation could be quantified in terms of secondary outbreaks likely due to the exchange of animals from directly exposed flocks. © 2012 Bertolini et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Background: S. aureus is one of the main pathogens responsible for the intra-mammary infection in dairy ruminants. Although much work has been carried out to understand the complex physiological and cellular events that occur in the mammary gland in response to S. aureus, the protective mechanisms are still poorly understood. The objectives of the present study were to investigate gene expression during the early response of the goat mammary gland to an experimental challenge with S. aureus, in order to better understand the local and systemic response and to compare them in two divergent lines of goat selected for high and low milk somatic cell scores.Results: No differences in gene expression were found between high and low SCS (Somatic Cells Score) selection lines. Analysing the two groups together, an expression of 300 genes were found to change from T0 before infection, and T4 at 24 hours and T5 at 30 hours following challenge. In blood derived white blood cells 8 genes showed increased expression between T0 and T5 and 1 gene has reduced expression. The genes showing the greatest increase in expression following challenge (5.65 to 3.16 fold change) play an important role in (i) immune and inflammatory response (NFKB1, TNFAIP6, BASP1, IRF1, PLEK, BATF3); (ii) the regulation of innate resistance to pathogens (PTX3); and (iii) the regulation of cell metabolism (CYTH4, SLC2A6, ARG2). The genes with reduced expression (-1.5 to -2.5 fold) included genes involved in (i) lipid metabolism (ABCG2, FASN), (ii) chemokine, cytokine and intracellular signalling (SPPI), and (iii) cell cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix (KRT19).Conclusions: Analysis of genes with differential expression following infection showed an inverse relationship between immune response and lipid metabolism in the early response of the mammary gland to the S. aureus challenge. PTX3 showed a large change in expression in both milk and blood, and is therefore a candidate for further studies on immune response associated with mastitis. © 2012 Cremonesi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Ovine sera collected from the northern Prefectures of Hokkaido, Iwate and Aomori in Japan, were examined for the presence of antibodies against Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) using the complement fixation test and, against Brucella spp., using both the rapid serum agglutination test and the complement fixation test. None of the sera tested were serologically positive to Brucella spp. A total of 21 animals (8.64%) out of 243 samples tested were seropositive to the C. burnetii antigen. Levels of infection were observed in all of the three Prefectures and in ten flocks of the fourteen sampled. Although no diagnostic measures were in place, the infection could not be linked to losses in sheep production or to the decreased fertility in ewes, a lower lambing rate and mortality in lambs. These data confirmed that Q fever is widespread in the sheep population in the area studied. Considering the zoonotic potential of the disease, further studies to investigate the epidemiology of Q fever in this region are required. © Istituto G. Caporale 2012.},

abstract={We report the genetic and biological characterisation of a novel pantropic canine coronavirus (CCoV), strain 450/07, which caused the death of a 60-day-old miniature pinscher. At the genetic level, this virus was strictly related to the prototype strain CB/05, but displayed some unique features. After experimental infection with the new pantropic isolate, most inoculated dogs showed diarrhoea and acute lymphopenia. Gross lesions and histological changes were mainly evident in the gut and lymphoid tissues, although some animals showed remarkable changed also in parenchymatous organs. The viral RNA was detected in the faeces and/or internal organs of most pups. These findings seem to indicate that strain 450/07 is able to spread to internal organs (mainly lymphoid tissues), causing lymphopenia but inducing a mild disease. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Since 2004 it become clear that atypical bovine spongiform encephalopthies (BSEs) exist in cattle. Whenever their detection has relied on active surveillance plans implemented in Europe since 2001 by rapid tests, the overall and inter-laboratory performance of these diagnostic systems in the detection of the atypical strains has not been studied thoroughly to date. To fill this gap, the present study reports on the analytical sensitivity of the EU-approved rapid tests for atypical L- and H-type and classical BSE in parallel. Each test was challenged with two dilution series, one created from a positive pool of the three BSE forms according to the EURL standard method of homogenate preparation (50% w/v) and the other as per the test kit manufacturer's instructions. Multilevel logistic models and simple logistic models with the rapid test as the only covariate were fitted for each BSE form analyzed as directed by the test manufacturer's dilution protocol. The same schemes, but excluding the BSE type, were then applied to compare test performance under the manufacturer's versus the water protocol. The IDEXX HerdChek ® BSE-scrapie short protocol test showed the highest sensitivity for all BSE forms. The IDEXX® HerdChek BSE-scrapie ultra short protocol, the Prionics® - Check WESTERN and the AJ Roboscreen® BetaPrion tests showed similar sensitivities, followed by the Roche® PrionScreen, the Bio-Rad® TeSeE™ SAP and the Prionics® - Check PrioSTRIP in descending order of analytical sensitivity. Despite these differences, the limit of detection of all seven rapid tests against the different classes of material set within a 2 log10 range of the best-performing test, thus meeting the European Food Safety Authority requirement for BSE surveillance purposes. These findings indicate that not many atypical cases would have been missed surveillance since 2001 which is important for further epidemiological interpretations of the sporadic character of atypical forms. © 2012 Meloni et al.},

abstract={Prion protein (PrP) is encoded by the PRNP gene, which is highly polymorphic in goats, with polymorphisms encoding amino acid substitutions at the protein level. In the current study, the reactivity of monoclonal antibody (mAb) F99/97.6.1 in binding PrP from goats polymorphic at PRNP codon 222 was investigated. Nervous tissue from 30 scrapie-negative goats with 3 different genotypes (222Q/Q, 222Q/K, and 222K/K) was analyzed by Western blot using mAbs P4 and F99/97.6.1. Although PrP was detected in all 30 samples by mAb P4, detection of PrP by mAb F99/97.6.1 was limited to 222Q/Q (12/12). No PrP was detected by mAb F99/97.6.1 in the 222K/K samples (n = 6), and the signal intensity of mAb F99/97.6.1 for PrP was lower for the 222Q/K samples (12/12 samples). To further investigate these results, additional Western blot analyses were performed, and the PrP signals detected by mAbs F99/97.6.1 and SAF84 were then quantified. The mean F99/SAF84 ratio (± standard deviation) calculated for the 222Q/Q group was 0.73 ± 1.26, and the mean for the 222Q/K group was 0.27 ± 1.31. Statistical analysis of these values evidenced statistically significant differences between the 222Q/Q and 222Q/K samples. The results of the study thus revealed an inhibition by lysine at position 222 on the binding of mAb F99/97.6.1 to goat PrP. This has implications for the use of mAb F99/97.6.1 for diagnostic purposes. Because the 222K allele could be a target for genetic selection in goats, the differential reactivity of mAb F99/97.6.1 could be exploited with a genotyping test setup. © 2012 The Author(s).},

abstract={OBJECTIVE: to describe the contamination due to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs of cattle dairy andmeat products in cattle herds fromSusa Valley (Piedmont) since the second half of 2004. DESIGN: descriptive study based on a biomonitoring campaign on bovine bulk milk and muscle. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the official samplings have been carried out between 2004 and 2010: the dataset refers to 99 mass milk samples and 24 muscle samples from 51 cattle herds based in 23 municipalities of the valley. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: counts and frequencies of samples exceeding either the maximum levels or the action levels set by the European legislation; moreover relative distributions of congeners (profiles) were considered. RESULTS: DL-PCBs showed median concentration values double when compared with dioxins values and a couple of congeners (2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF, 118 DL-PCB) were particularly abundant.More than 60% of both the milk samples and herds exceeded the action levels with the involvement of 10 municipalities most of which located nearby a local steel smelter. The DL-PCB values in milk were associated with the distance of each herd from the steel plant. However, the temporal trend highlights a clear decrease of the contamination over the 2004-2010 period, when the plant was renewed and the production levels where negatively impacted by the global economical crisis. CONCLUSION: the findings of the monitoring activity allowed the understanding of the origin and the spatio-temporal evolution of the contamination: this knowledge may be helpful in orienting future controls and the risk mitigation strategies. © 2012 Inferenze Scarl.},

The experiment was founded by the National Ministry of Health, to validate histological test for surveillance and control of growth-promoting hormones in sheep. This study confirmed the strong correlation between clinical and anatomopathological features and growth performances of treated animals. Otherwise, no significant differences were found on in vivo performance of the lambs. Estradiol treatment showed heavier shoulders and necks on treated lambs, while the loins were significantly lighter.

abstract={Selling fish products as fresh when they have actually been frozen and thawed is a common fraudulent practice in seafood retailing. Unlike fish products frozen to protect them against degenerative changes during transportation and to extend the product's storage life, fish intended for raw consumption in European countries must be previously frozen at -207deg;C for at least 24 h to kill parasites. The aim of this study was to use histological analysis to distinguish between fresh and frozen-thawed fish and to evaluate this method for use as a routine screening technique in compliance with the requirements of European Commission Regulation No. 882/2004 on official food and feed controls. Method performance (i.e., accuracy and precision) was evaluated on tissue samples from three common Mediterranean fish species; the evaluation was subsequently extended to include samples from 35 fish species in a second experiment to test for method robustness. Method accuracy was tested by comparing histological results against a "gold standard" obtained from the analysis of frozen and unfrozen fish samples prepared for the study. Method precision was evaluated according to interrater agreement (i.e., three laboratories with expertise in histopathology in the first experiment and three expert analysts in the second experiment) by estimating Cohen's kappa (and corresponding 95% confidence intervals) for each pair of laboratories and experts and the combined Cohen's kappa for all three experts and laboratories. The observed interrater agreement among the three laboratories and the three experts indicated high levels of method accuracy and precision (high sensitivity and specificity) and method reproducibility. Our results suggest that histology is a rapid, simple, and highly accurate method for distinguishing between fresh and frozen-thawed fish, regardless of the fish species analyzed.

abstract={The aim of this study was to analyse the SPRN genes of goats from several scrapie outbreaks in order to detect polymorphisms and to look for association with scrapie occurrence, by an unmatched case-control study. A region of the caprine SPRN gene encompassing the entire ORF and a fragment of the 39UTR revealed a total of 11 mutations: 10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and one indel polymorphism. Only two non-synonymous mutations occurring at very low incidence were identified. A significant association with scrapie positivity in the central nervous system was found for an indel polymorphism (602_606insCTCCC) in the 39UTR. Bioinformatics analyses suggest that this indel may modulate scrapie susceptibility via a microRNA-mediated post-transcriptional mechanism. This is the first study to demonstrate an association between the SPRN gene and goat scrapie. The identified indel may serve as a genetic target other than PRNP to predict disease risk in future genetics-based scrapie-control approaches in goats. © 2012 SGM.},

abstract={The association between bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) has demonstrated that cattle transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) can pose a risk to human health and raises the possibility that other ruminant TSEs may be transmissible to humans. In recent years, several novel TSEs in sheep, cattle and deer have been described and the risk posed to humans by these agents is currently unknown. In this study, we inoculated two forms of atypical BSE (BASE and H-type BSE), a chronic wasting disease (CWD) isolate and seven isolates of atypical scrapie into gene-targeted transgenic (Tg) mice expressing the human prion protein (PrP). Upon challenge with these ruminant TSEs, gene-targeted Tg mice expressing human PrP did not show any signs of disease pathology. These data strongly suggest the presence of a substantial transmission barrier between these recently identified ruminant TSEs and humans.},

abstract={Until recently, transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) disease in cattle was thought to be caused by a single agent strain, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) (classical BSE or BSE-C). However, due to the initiation of a large-scale surveillance programme throughout Europe, two atypical BSE strains, bovine amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy (BASE, also named BSE-L) and BSE-H have since been discovered. These atypical BSE isolates have been previously transmitted to a range of transgenic mouse models overexpressing PrP from different species at different levels, on a variety of genetic backgrounds. To control for genetic background and expression level in the analysis of these isolates, we performed here a comprehensive comparison of the neuropathological and molecular properties of all three BSE agents (BASE, BSE-C and BSE-H) upon transmission into the same gene-targeted transgenic mouse line expressing the bovine prion protein (Bov6) and a wild-type control of the same genetic background. Significantly, upon challenge with these BSE agents, we found that BASE did not produce shorter survival times in these mice compared with BSE-C, contrary to previous studies using overexpressing bovine transgenic mice. Amyloid plaques were only present in mice challenged with atypical BSE and neuropathological features, including intensity of PrP deposition in the brain and severity of vacuolar degeneration were less pronounced in BASE compared with BSE-C-challenged mice. © 2012 SGM.},

abstract={Current carcinogenesis theory states that only a small subset of tumor cells, the cancer stem cells or tumor initiating cells (TICs), are responsible for tumor formation and progression. Human breast cancer-initiating cells have been identified as CD44-expressing cells, which retain tumorigenic activity and display stem cell-like properties. Spontaneous feline mammary carcinoma (FMC) is an aggressive cancer, which shows biological similarities to the human tumor counterpart. We report the isolation and phenotypic characterization of FMC-derived stem/progenitor cells, showing in vitro self-renewal, long-lasting proliferation and in vivo tumorigenicity. Twenty-one FMC samples were collected, histologically classified and characterized for the expression of Ki67, EGFR, ER-α and CD44, by immunohistochemistry. By culture in stem cell permissive conditions, we isolated, from 13 FMCs, a CD44-positive subpopulation able to survive and proliferate in vitro as mammospheres of different sizes and morphologies. When injected in NOD/SCID mice, FMC stem-like cells initiate tumors, generating cell heterogeneity and recapitulating the original histotype. In serum-containing medium, spheroid cells showed differentiation properties as shown by morphological changes, the loss of CD44 expression and tumorigenic potential. These data show that stem-defined culture of FMC enriches for TICs and validate the use of these cells as a suitable model for comparative oncology studies of mammary biology and testing therapeutic strategies aimed at eradicating TICs. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Usutu virus is a mosquito-borne virus first isolated from Culex naevei in South Africa in 1959. The first emergence of Usutu virus outside Africa was recorded in Austria. Here, a phylogenetic analysis targeting the E5 and NS5 genes was carried out on the viral strains circulating in Europe. The NS5 gene tree showed two main clades, one of which included the Italian sequences. In the E gene tree all sequences grouped into the same main clade, with sequences from Austria divided into two separate clusters. Only sites under negative selective pressure were found in E and NS5 proteins. The results suggest that Usutu virus circulating in Europe has a degree of genetic diversity higher than expected and that infection may arise from different sources.},

abstract={The transmission of pestiviruses between domestic and wild ruminants has not been documented in communal alpine pastures shared between wildlife and livestock. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of domestic and wild ungulates species from Varaita Valley (SW Italian Alps) in the epidemiology of Pestivirus infections. Sera from free-ranging alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) were collected from 1994 to 2009 and 2001 to 2009, respectively. Also, sera from cattle and sheep sampled in 2009 were studied. Sera were tested for the presence of antibodies against pestivirus with an ELISA assay. Sera from positive animals were subsequently tested with a comparative virus neutralisation test using the BVDV-NADL and BDV-137/4 strains. Sera were tested for the presence of pestiviral antigen and the presence of viral RNA with a commercial ELISA assay and RT-PCR. Antibodies against Pestivirus were detected in 132 out of 312 (42%) chamois, in 30 out of 175 (17%) cattle and 6 out of 24 (25%) sheep. No antibodies were found in roe deer. No Pestivirus antigen or RNA was detected in any of the samples. Results indicate circulation of pestiviruses among the studied chamois, cattle and sheep populations. However the role of wild ungulates in the dynamics of Pestivirus infection is still unknown and monitoring the presence of these viruses in wild ungulates would be of importance, especially in the chamois population, where pestiviruses seem to circulate extensively. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Susceptibility of sheep to scrapie, a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy of small ruminants, is strongly influenced by polymorphisms of the prion protein gene (PRNP). Breeding programs have been implemented to increase scrapie resistance in sheep populations; though desirable, a similar approach has not yet been applied in goats. European studies have now suggested that several polymorphisms can modulate scrapie susceptibility in goats: in particular, PRNP variant K222 has been associated with resistance in case-control studies in Italy, France and Greece. In this study we investigated the resistance conferred by this variant using a natural Italian goat scrapie isolate to intracerebrally challenge five goats carrying genotype Q/Q 222 (wild type) and five goats carrying genotype Q/K 222. By the end of the study, all five Q/Q 222 goats had died of scrapie after a mean incubation period of 19 months; one of the five Q/K 222 goats died after 24 months, while the other four were alive and apparently healthy up to the end of the study at 4.5 years post-challenge. All five of these animals were found to be scrapie negative. Statistical analysis showed that the probability of survival of the Q/K 222 goats versus the Q/Q 222 goats was significantly higher (p = 0.002). Our study shows that PRNP gene mutation K222 is strongly associated with resistance to classical scrapie also in experimental conditions, making it a potentially positive target for selection in the frame of breeding programs for resistance to classical scrapie in goats. © 2012 Acutis et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Mammary tumours frequently develop in female domestic cats being highly malignant in a large percentage of cases. Chemokines regulate many physiological and pathological processes including organogenesis, chemotaxis of inflammatory cells, as well as tumour progression and metastasization. In particular, the chemokine/receptor pair SDF-1/CXCR4 has been involved in the regulation of metastatic potential of neoplastic cells, including breast cancer. The aim of this study was the immunohistochemical defininition of the expression profile of CXCR4 in primary and metastatic feline mammary carcinomas and the evaluation of the role of SDF-1 in feline mammary tumour cell proliferation.Results: A total of 45 mammary surgical samples, including 33 primary tumours (31 carcinomas and 2 adenomas), 6 metastases, and 4 normal mammary tissues were anlyzed. Tumor samples were collected from a total number of 26 animals, as in some cases concurrent occurrence of neoplasm in more than one mammary gland was observed. Tissues were processed for standard histological examination, and all lesions were classified according to the World Health Organization criteria. CXCR4 expression in neoplastic cells was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The level of CXCR4 immunoreactivity was semi-quantitatively estimated as CXCR4 score evaluating both the number of positive cells and the intensity of staining. Six primary, fibroblast-free primary cultures were obtained from fresh feline mammary carcinomas and characterized by immunofluorescence for CXCR4 and malignant mammary cell marker expression. SDF-1-dependent in vitro proliferative effects were also assayed. CXCR4 expression was observed in 29 out of 31 malignant tissues with a higher CXCR4 score observed in 4 out of 6 metastatic lesions than in the respective primary tumours. In 2 benign lesions analyzed, only the single basaloid adenoma showed a mild positive immunostaining against CXCR4. Normal tissue did not show CXCR4 immunoreactivity. CXCR4 score was statistically significantly associated with the histological features of the samples, showing an increase accordingly with the degree of neoplastic transformation (from normal tissue to metastatic lesions). Finally, in the primary cultures obtained from 6 primary feline mammary carcinomas CXCR4 expression was detected in all cells and its activation by SDF-1 in vitro treatment caused a significant increase in the proliferation rate in 5 out of 6 tumours.Conclusions: These results indicate that malignant feline mammary tumours commonly express CXCR4, with a higher level in malignant tumours, and, in most of the cases analysed, metastatic cells display stronger immunoreactivity for CXCR4 than the corresponding primary tumours. Moreover, CXCR4 activation in primary cultures of feline mammary carcinomas causes increase in the proliferative rate. Thus, SDF-1/CXCR4 system seems to play a tumorigenic in feline mammary gland malignancy and in vitro cultures from these tumour samples may represent an experimental model to investigate the biological and pharmacological role of this chemokinergic axis. © 2012 Ferrari et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Although Morbillivirus and Toxoplasma gondii have emerged as important pathogens for several cetaceans populations over the last 20 years, they have never been identified together in a Mysticete. In particular, morbilliviral infection has been never described in the Mediterranean fin whale population.Case presentation: On January 2011 an adult male of fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) stranded along the Tyrrhenian coastline of Italy. During necropsy, tissue samples from heart, skeletal muscle, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney were collected and subsequently analyzed for Morbillivirus and Toxoplasma gondii by microscopic and molecular methods. Following the detailed necropsy carried out on this whale, molecular analysis revealed, for the first time, the simultaneous presence of a Dolphin Morbillivirus (DMV) and T. gondii infection coexisting with each other, along with high organochlorine pollutant concentrations, with special reference to DDT.Conclusion: This report, besides confirming the possibility for Mysticetes to be infected with DMV, highlights the risk of toxoplasmosis in sea water for mammals, already immunodepressed by concurrent factors as infections and environmental contaminants. © 2012 Mazzariol et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={The amyloidotic form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) termed BASE is caused by a prion strain whose biological properties differ from those of typical BSE, resulting in a clinically and pathologically distinct phenotype. Whether peripheral tissues of BASE-affected cattle contain infectivity is unknown. This is a critical issue since the BASE prion is readily transmissible to a variety of hosts including primates, suggesting that humans may be susceptible. We carried out bioassays in transgenic mice overexpressing bovine PrP (Tgbov XV) and found infectivity in a variety of skeletal muscles from cattle with natural and experimental BASE. Noteworthy, all BASE muscles used for inoculation transmitted disease, although the attack rate differed between experimental and natural cases (~70% versus ~10%, respectively). This difference was likely related to different prion titers, possibly due to different stages of disease in the two conditions, i.e. terminal stage in experimental BASE and pre-symptomatic stage in natural BASE. The neuropathological phenotype and PrP res type were consistent in all affected mice and matched those of Tgbov XV mice infected with brain homogenate from natural BASE. The immunohistochemical analysis of skeletal muscles from cattle with natural and experimental BASE showed the presence of abnormal prion protein deposits within muscle fibers. Conversely, Tgbov XV mice challenged with lymphoid tissue and kidney from natural and experimental BASE did not develop disease. The novel information on the neuromuscular tropism of the BASE strain, efficiently overcoming species barriers, underlines the relevance of maintaining an active surveillance. © 2012 Suardi et al.},

abstract={Recently, atypical bovine pestiviruses (BVDV-3) have been identified in batches of contaminated foetal calf serum (FCS) and in naturally infected cattle. During routine screening of FCS by conventional panpestivirus PCR assay, one batch showed traces of pestivirus nucleic acids, and the contaminating virus was typed as BVDV-3-like. Phylogenetic analysis based on three genome regions (5'UTR, N pro and E2) showed that this strain, named IZSPLV_To, clusters in a separate clade with CH_KaHo/cont, a cell culture contaminant detected in Switzerland. This study is the first report of the detection in Italy of a FCS batch contaminated with BVDV-3 and adds more evidence that atypical pestiviruses represent a serious cause for concern in cell culture laboratories, with potential repercussions on BVD control and vaccine biosafety. Our findings suggest that the BE/B2 primers may be able to detect BVDV-3 in a panpestivirus assay, but testing of a larger number of strains is required. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={An increased incidence of enrofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli associated with septicemic colibacillosis in calves was observed recently in northern Italy. The aim of this study was to investigate this phenomenon. A total of 47 consecutive E. coli isolates exhibiting reduced susceptibility to enrofloxacin (intermediately resistant or resistant) causing septicemic colibacillosis in calves from 45 large-scale farms during 2006-2008, were studied. Phylogenetic group, antimicrobial agents susceptibility, and O serogroup were determined with randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing, providing additional discrimination. All of the microorganisms carried resistance to two or more additional drugs, with the pattern fluoroquinolone-ampicillin-co-trimoxazole- tetracycline-gentamicin-thiamphenicol being the most represented (18/47; 38.3%). Plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum and AmpC β-lactamases and plasmid-mediated fluoroquinolone resistance genetic determinants were not detected. Third-generation cephalosporins emerged as the most active antimicrobial agents tested (97.9% of susceptible strains). Overall, 37 different RAPD profiles and 18 different O serogroups could be distinguished among the typeable strains, indicating a substantial heterogeneity and suggesting the occurrence of several independent selection events. However, approximately one-fourth (11/47) of the strains belonged to serogroup O78, and PFGE revealed that the great majority (7/11) of these were clonally related, indicating the selection of a O78 clonal group. This is the first report investigating the molecular epidemiology of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli in calves and describing the emergence of a fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli clonal group in these animals. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2012.},

Upon optimization of sample treatment conditions, the extraction was performed by diethylether at pH 9, after deconjugation. Extraction yields (R%) proved higher than 70% for 19 analytes, 50<R%<70 for 5 analytes, lower than 50% but reproducible for the remaining six analytes. The analyses were carried out using HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. The method sensitivity proved high enough to largely exceed the CCβ requirements of the Italian residue detection plan, ranging from 1 to 3 ng/mL (20 ng/mL for promazines). The present method allowed the simultaneous analysis of most drugs for which the European legislation prescribes official controls. Its practical applicability was verified on 494 real samples as an alternative to the traditional screening protocols based on multiple immunometric analysis, demonstrating high efficiency and comprehensive investigation capacity, allowing epidemiological assessment of the current trends in cattle breeding drug abuse. Among non-compliant results, nine borderline cases of growth-promoters illegal treatments, making use of long-term low-dosage administrations and typically yielding urine residues below the cut-off value for immunochemical methods, were detected by using the present LC-MS/MS method.

abstract={Objective: To develop a diagnostic diagram for rapid field assessment of acidosis severity in diarrheic calves. Design: Prospective cross-sectional study. Animals: 148 Piedmontese calves (38 calves in preliminary experiments; 83 diarrheic calves and 27 healthy control calves in the primary experiment). Procedures: Physical examination was performed and a standard data collection form was completed for each calf. Blood samples were obtained and submitted for evaluation of acidbase balance, performance of a CBC, and measurement of electrolyte and total protein concentrations. Results: Severe metabolic acidosis (extracellular base excess more negative than -10 mmol/L) was associated with abnormal mental status, delayed or absent suckle reflex, abnormal posture or gait, enophthalmos, and cold oral mucosal membranes. Clinical signs associated with severe metabolic acidosis were arranged into a grid to create a diagnostic diagram. Sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic diagram for the prediction of severe metabolic acidosis were 88% and 79%, respectively. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: Use of the diagnostic diagram may aid differentiation between severe and nonsevere acidosis patterns as determined on the basis of clinical signs.},

abstract={Tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs) are structures that are morphologically and functionally similar to secondary lymphoid organs. TLOs usually arise in a background of chronic inflammation. Several histological patterns of interstitial nephritis have been documented in porcine leptospirosis. Among them the lympho-follicular pattern is characterized by infiltrates of mononuclear cells organized in lymphoid follicle-like structures. Immunohistological analysis of 5 cases of porcine lympho-follicular nephritis associated with Leptospira Pomona infection demonstrated the presence of inflammatory cell populations, including B cells, T cells, macrophages and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), which were compartmentalized as in TLOs. Immunohistochemistry for Leptospira Pomona revealed an intimate association between leptospiral antigen and FDCs. Overexpression of MHCII in different populations of both professional and non-professional antigen presenting cells was also demonstrated. FDCs play role during TLOs induction for their ability to retain non-self antigens in the form of immune complexes, thus causing persistent T cell activation, generation of a complex cytokine network and stimulation of humoral immunity. Sustained bacterial antigen presentation in the context of chronic leptospiral nephritis, may also lead to autoimmune mechanisms involved in the generation of TLOs. Whether lymphoid neogenesis and TLOs play a protective role in porcine leptospiral nephritis is still unclear. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Species substitution is a common commercial fraud, mainly applied to fish species. It is thus important to have analytical methods for species identification. DNA analysis can be a suitable technique: some mitochondrial genes are actually recognized as valuable markers for species discrimination. Aim of this work was thus to evaluate the capability of cytb and COI genes to discriminate the species of fish (n=89) which are commonly substituted. In the last four years of activity on field, the laboratory analysed, using the FINS method (Forensically Informative Nucleotide Sequencing), 146 samples, belonging to several fish species, sent by veterinary officers in the frame of their activities of control: in this work, results about number and kind of fraud are reported. Additionally, samples directly purchased by the lab were examined. The obtained results showed that the genetic markers have a high discriminatory power and that the method is highly suitable. The frequent detection of species substitution in the samples collected on field showed the importance of controlling this kind of frauds in the fish market. © 2016, Page Press Publications.

abstract={In the period 2006-2011 six public catering establishments (3 canteens and 3 cafeterias) were monitored, trough audit and sampling, in order to verify the application of good manufacturing and hygiene practices during food production, handling and serving. The compliance to microbiological food safety criteria (Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp.) and process hygiene criteria were investigated using ISO standards for microbiological analyses. A total of 612 samples were collected: 192 food samples and 288 environmental swab samples from canteens; 33 food samples and 99 swab samples from cafeterias. Regarding food safety, two samples were in disagreement with criteria fixed in EU Regulation as Listeria monocytogenes was isolated from a turkey breast in a canteen and from a sandwich in a cafeteria. Regarding process hygiene criteria, as no microbiological limits are legally defined for catering services, for this study limits were fixed according to the quality standards of tender, scientific literature and laboratory experience. 23.4% foodstuffs and 8.7% swabs resulted non-compliant in canteens; 48.5% foodstuffs and 6.1% swabs resulted non-compliant in cafeterias. The count of coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS) was higher of the fixed limits in raw turkey meat and in cooked spinach: the presence among CPS of S. aureus was confirmed, strains were not able to produce enterotoxins. The most common non-compliance in hygiene criteria was represented by aerobic colony count (60.7% of total non-compliance in canteens and 75.0% in cafeterias) and coliform bacteria (20.3% in canteens and 25.0% in cafeterias). Nine raw foods or raw readyto- eat food samples were non-compliant for both coliform bacteria and aerobic count; one sample (raw turkey meat) was non-compliant for CPS and aerobic count but resulted to be compliant after cooking. Auditing and sampling are the most effective tools to improve food quality standard and to enhance food business operators’ awareness of hygiene procedures. © 2016, Page Press Publications.

abstract={In transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) and Alzheimer disease (AD) both misfolding and aggregation of specific proteins represent key features. Recently, it was observed that PrP C is a mediator of a synaptic dysfunction induced by Aβ oligomers. We tested a novel γ-secretase modulator (CHF5074) in a murine model of prion disease. Groups of female mice were intracerebrally or intraperitoneally infected with the mouse-adapted Rocky Mountain Laboratory prions. Two weeks prior infection, the animals were provided with a CHF5074-medicated diet (375 ppm) or a standard diet (vehicle) until they showed neurological signs and eventually died. In intracerebrally infected mice, oral administration of CHF5074 did not prolong survival of the animals. In intraperitoneally-infected mice, CHF5074-treated animals showed a median survival time of 21 d longer than vehicle-treated mice (p &lt; 0.001). In these animals, immunohistochemistry analyses showed that deposition of PrP Sc in the cerebellum, hippocampus and parietal cortex in CHF5074-treated mice was significantly lower than in vehicle-treated animals. Immunostaining of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in parietal cortex revealed a significantly higher reactive gliosis in CHF5074-treated mice compared with the control group of infected animals. Although the mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of CHF5074 in this murine model of human prion disease is unclear, it could be hypothesized that the drug counteracts PrP Sc toxicity through astrocyte-mediated neuroprotection. CHF5074 shows a pharmacological potential in murine models of both AD and TSEs thus suggesting a link between these degenerative pathologies. © 2012 Landes Bioscience.},

Molecular, phylogenetic and mutation scanning analyses showed the occurrence of Type II and of an atypical Type II T. gondii isolates in one and two dolphins, respectively. In spite of the different molecular patterns characterizing the above T. gondii genotypes, the brain lesions observed in the three animals showed common microscopic features, with no remarkable differences among them.

abstract={The brown hare (Lepus europaeus) is widely distributed throughout Europe where it constitutes an important game species. However, there is concern about its conservation because the number of European hares has drastically declined in Europe since the 1960s and the species is now considered at low risk of extinction. During the last decades, several countries have carried out restocking programs with the introduction of allochtonous individuals. We analyzed 109 blood samples from two brown hare populations captured in two protected areas in northern Italy, where no animals have been released in the last 20 years, to assess genetic variability and inbreeding status for management and conservation purposes. For this study, eight microsatellite markers were selected from those described in the literature and two multiplex PCR reactions were optimised. The number of alleles per locus, allelic frequencies, observed and expected heterozygosity, and inbreeding coefficient were then calculated. Our results revealed good genetic variability in both populations. Analysis of brown hare populations in a larger number of protected areas would be useful for improving their management through wider genetic characterization of populations for restocking programs, more accurate measurement of their genetic distances, evaluation of the reduction in their genetic variability and gene flows among adjacent areas, and perhaps detection of the introduction of allochtonous animals.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of sarcosporidiosis in semi-intensively bred cattle in northwestern Italy. A diagnostic protocol was setup in which infected animals were identified by rapid histological examination of the esophagus, diaphragm, and heart and the detected Sarcocystis spp. were subsequently typed using conventional electron microscopy in combination with molecular techniques. Sarcosporidia cysts were detected in 78.1% of the animals and were seen most often in the esophagus. The cattle is intermediate host for Sarcocystis hominis (final host, humans and some primates), Sarcocystis cruzi (final host, domestic and wild canids), and Sarcocystis hirsuta (final host, wild and domestic cats).All these three species of Sarcocystis were identified, variously associated, with the following prevalence: S. cruzi (74.2%), S. hirsuta (1.8%), and S. hominis (42.7%). Furthermore, a new S. hominis-like (prevalence 18.5%), characterized by hook-like structures of villar protrusion and a different sequence of the 18S rRNA gene, was identified. The cattle sheds testing positive for zoonotic Sarcocystis were assessed for risk factors contributing to the maintenance of the parasite's life cycle. Significant associations emerged between consumption of raw meat by the farm owner, mountain pasturing, and absence of a sewerage system on the farm and cattle breed. Our study demonstrates that sarcosporidiosis may constitute a public health problem in Italy and indicates several issues to be addressed when planning surveillance and prevention actions. The applied diagnostic approach revealed that cattle can harbor a further type of Sarcocystis, of which life cycle and zoonotic potential should be investigated. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={A 9-year-old, male dwarf Angora rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), weighing 1. 1 kg, was presented to the referring veterinarian with a history of abdominal pain, anorexia and poor body condition. On physical examination, a solid mass was detected in the abdominal cavity by palpation. No other physical abnormalities were apparent at that time. A complete blood cell count revealed a marked hypochromic macrocytic regenerative anaemia and leucopenia with marked lymphopaenia. Serum biochemical analysis showed a marked hypoproteinaemia with hypoalbuminaemia and a moderate increased blood ureic nitrogen concentration. Histopathological evaluation of the intestinal lesion showed a proliferation of spindle cells with morphological features of neoplastic smooth muscle cells which resulted positive for smooth muscle actin, vimentin, desmin, c-kit and faintly positive for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3). Based on histomorphological and immunohistochemical evaluation, a diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) was made. The latter is considered a tumour originating from primitive mesenchymal cells of gastrointestinal tract with pluripotential differentiation. GISTs have been reported in humans, and in a few domestic animal species such as dogs, horses and ferrets. To our best knowledge, this is the first report describing a gastrointestinal stromal tumour in an Angora rabbit. The clinical outcome of GISTs is considered to be similar to other indolent tumours and sarcomas. © 2011 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

abstract={Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive chemotherapy- resistant cancer. Up-regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays an important role in MPM development and EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) may represent novel therapeutic options. We tested the effects of the EGFR TKIs gefitinib and erlotinib and TKIs targeted to other growth factors (VEGFR and PDGFR), in comparison to standard antineoplastic agents, in two human MPM cell lines, IST-Mes2 and ZL55. All drugs showed IC 50 values in the micromolar range: TKIs induced cytostatic effects at concentrations up to the IC 50, while conventional drug growth-inhibitory activity was mainly cytotoxic. Moreover, the treatment of IST-Mes2 with TKIs (gefitinib and imatinib mesylate) in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine did not show additivity. Focusing on the molecular mechanisms underlying the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of EGFR-TKIs, we observed that gefitinib induced the formation and stabilization of inactive EGFR homodimers, even in absence of EGF, as demonstrated by EGFR B max and number of sites/cell. The analysis of downstream effectors of EGFR signaling demonstrated that EGF-induced proliferation, reverted by gefitinib, involved ERK1/2 activation, independently from Akt pathway. Gefitinib inhibits MPM cell growth and survival, preventing EGF-dependent activation of ERK1/2 pathway by blocking EGFR-TK phosphorylation and stabilizing inactive EGFR dimers. Along with the molecular definition of TKIs pharmacological efficacy in vitro, these results may contribute to delve deep into the promising but still controversial role for targeted and conventional drugs in the therapy of MPM. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Aims: This study was performed to investigate the microbiological contamination of digestate product (DP) obtained from the anaerobic co-digestion of bovine manure and agricultural by-products. Methods and results: Microbiological analyses were performed on bovine manure, fresh DP, liquid and solid fractions and stored liquid fraction of DP. A statistically significant reduction of faecal bacterial indicator was found after anaerobic digestion except for enterococci. After liquid/solid DP separation, bacteria tend to be concentrated in the solid fraction. Storage does not seem to influence the indicator parameters, except for enterococci. Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Yersinia were not found in any samples analysed. Salmonella was rarely detected in DP samples and its derivates, while Listeria monocytogenes was encountered in many samples. Conclusions: The results obtained indicate that the hygienic quality of DP is for almost all microbiological parameters better than that of the bovine manure (range of reduction 1.6-3.1 log 10) and suggest the need to identify specific pathogen indicators related to the hygienic characteristics of DPs. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study highlights that the anaerobic co-digestion of bovine manure and agricultural by-products in a field-scale biogas plant does not increase human health risk with respect to the use of animal manure for agricultural fertilization. © 2011 The Authors.

abstract={A fast liquid chromatographic/tandem mass spectrometric method was developed for the simultaneous determination in human urine of seventeen benzodiazepines, four relevant metabolites together plus zolpidem and zopiclone. The sample preparation, optimized to take into account the matrix effect, was based on enzymatic hydrolysis and liquid-liquid extraction. The separation of the twenty-three analytes was achieved in less than eight minutes.The whole methodology was fully validated according to UNI EN ISO/IEC 17025:2005 rules and 2006 SOFT/AAFS guidelines. Selectivity, linearity range, identification (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) limits, precision, accuracy and recovery were evaluated. For all the species the signal/concentration linearity was satisfactory in the 50-1000 ng/mL concentration range. The limits of detection ranged from 0.5 to 30 ng/mL and LOQs from 1.7 to 100.0. ng/mL. Precisions were in the ranges 5.0-11.8%, 1.5-11.0% and 1.1-4.4% for low (100 ng/mL), medium (300 ng/mL) and high (1000 ng/mL) concentration, respectively. The accuracy, expressed as bias% was within ±25% for all the analytes. The recovery values, evaluated at 300 ng/mL concentration, ranged from 56.2% to 98.8%. The present method for the determination of several benzodiazepines, zolpidem and zopiclone in human urine proved to be simple, fast, specific and sensitive. The quantification by LC-MS/MS was successfully applied to 329 forensic cases among driving re-licensing, car accidents and alleged sexual violence cases. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of Vibrio vulnificus and potentially pathogenic strains of Vibrio parahaemolyticus in mullets collected from estuarine environment in Italy. Methods and Results: Two hundred and ninety-five mullets were analysed by culture using the selective medium thiosulfate citrate bile salt sucrose agar, during a monitoring period of 2years (2008-2009). Presumptive Vibrio colonies were initially identified by using biochemical tests, and strains identified as V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus were subsequently examined by PCR for the presence of species-specific and virulence genes (toxR, trh, tdh and vvh). V. parahaemolyticus was found in 55% (162/295) of fishes and V. vulnificus in 1% (3/295) with a higher presence in summer months. The trh+/tdh- strains were detected in 16% (47/295) of samples and only one strain resulted trh+/tdh+. One of the V. parahaemolyticus trh+ strains isolated belonged to the O1:KUT (K untypeable), a serotype recently associated to gastroenteritis in Italy. Conclusions: This is the first report demonstrating a high percentage of potential pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus trh+ strains in estuarine fishes of the Mediterranean area. Significance and Impact of the Study: These findings indicate the potential human health risk associated with the presence of pathogenic Vibrio spp. in wild fishes. © 2011 The Authors.

abstract={With this study we evaluated the performance of a histological method for the detection of microscopic lesions in the sexual accessory glands of veal calves administered 17β-estradiol valerate for growth promotion; our goal was to determine whether the method might hold potential as an official screening technique according to the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. The target organs of veal calves treated with low-dose 17β-estradiol valerate and those of control animals were microscopically examined in blinded manner and the histolopathogical features scored by two pathologists. Distinct histopathological differences were seen in the prostate and the bulbo-urethral glands of the treated animals versus the controls. Our findings indicate that, compared with the negative results obtained with the official test, this histopathological method can identify illicit 17β-estradiol valerate treatment up to 15 days after the last drug administration.Based on the preliminary evidence for the method's high specificity and sensitivity, a validation study could be set up according to Decision 2002/657/EC. Confirmation of its performance could support adoption of histopathology as an official screening method in the National Residue Monitoring Program for the detection of illicit estrogenic treatment. © 2011.},

abstract={Ovine sera collected from the northern Prefectures of Hokkaido, Iwate and Aomori in Japan, were examined for the presence of antibodies against visna-maedi virus using the agar gel immunodiffusion test and enzymelinked immunosorbent assays. Three animals (1.12%), out of 267 samples tested, were found to be seropositive to the visna-maedi antigens in both tests. Levels of infection were found in flocks from Hokkaido and Iwate Prefectures, but not in the Aomori Prefecture. Nucleic acid detection by polymerase chain reaction on serum samples did not give positive results. Although no diagnostic measures were in place, the infection could not be related to losses in sheep production or to reduced survival rates.

abstract={Background: Three distinct forms of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), defined as classical (C-), low (L-) or high (H-) type, have been detected through ongoing active and passive surveillance systems for the disease. The aim of the present study was to compare the ability of two sets of immunohistochemical (IHC) and Western blot (WB) BSE confirmatory protocols to detect C- and atypical (L- and H-type) BSE forms. Obex samples from cases of United States and Italian C-type BSE, a U.S. H-type and an Italian L-type BSE case were tested in parallel using the two IHC sets and WB methods. Results: The two IHC techniques proved equivalent in identifying and differentiating between C-type, L-type and H-type BSE. The IHC protocols appeared consistent in the identification of PrPSc distribution and deposition patterns in relation to the BSE type examined. Both IHC methods evidenced three distinct PrPSc phenotypes for each type of BSE: prevailing granular and linear tracts pattern in the C-type; intraglial and intraneuronal deposits in the H-type; plaques in the L-type. Also, the two techniques gave comparable results for PrPSc staining intensity on the C- and L-type BSE samples, whereas a higher amount of intraglial and intraneuronal PrPSc deposition on the H-type BSE case was revealed by the method based on a stronger demasking step. Both WB methods were consistent in identifying classical and atypical BSE forms and in differentiating the specific PrPSc molecular weight and glycoform ratios of each form. Conclusions: The study showed that the IHC and WB BSE confirmatory methods were equally able to recognize C-, L- and H-type BSE forms and to discriminate between their different immunohistochemical and molecular phenotypes. Of note is that for the first time one of the two sets of BSE confirmatory protocols proved effective in identifying the L-type BSE form. This finding helps to validate the suitability of the BSE confirmatory tests for BSE surveillance currently in place. © 2011 Hall et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Dexamethasone is one of a number of synthetic corticosteroids illegally used to promote growth in foodproducing animals. Since these low-level drug cocktails evade detection by currently available chemical methods, simple biological indicators that can aid in laboratory analysis are needed. In an attempt to devise an accurate biological method that could detect illicit drug treatment in food-producing animals, we characterized microscopic morphologic alterations of the thymus in veal calves administered low-dose dexamethasone versus control animals. For this purpose, 122 male calves were farmed for 6 months in controlled condition: 81 animals were orally administered dexamethasone (0.4 mg day 1) for 20 days during the sixth month and the remaining 41 were kept as control. Urine samples were collected systematically during the treatment period, the suspension period and at the slaughterhouse. All animals were slaughtered 10 per day starting from 10 days after the last dexamethasone administration and the thymus was sampled for histological examination. The difference between the two animal groups was evaluated by means of a non-parametric test of hypothesis. No residues were detected in the urines collected since the third day after the last administration, whereas morphometric analysis of the thoracic thymus revealed a significant decrease in the cortex:medulla ratio in the treated animals (p&lt;0.0005). We can conclude that this histological approach offers encouraging prospects as a screening method to overcome current limitations in controlling growth promoter abuse. © 2011 Taylor &amp; Francis.},

abstract={An analytical, pharmacokinetic and histopathologic investigation was conducted by two experimental trials on beef cattle in order to determine fate and effects of dexamethasone and prednisolone, administered to distinct cattle groups at low dosage for long periods of time. In trial 1, eighteen Charolaise beef cattle, male, 17-22-months-old, were divided in three groups: to group A (n=6) dexamethasone-21-sodium-phosphate 0.7mgday-1 per os for 40 days was administered; group B (n=6) was orally treated with prednisolone 15mgday-1 for 30 days, while group C (n=6) served as negative control. Urine was collected at days 0, 7, 15, 25 and 47 from groups A and C, and at days 0, 8, 18 and 42 from group B. In trial 2, sixteen Friesian cattle, male, 10-17-months-old, were randomly divided into two groups: group D (n=8) was administered prednisolone 30mgday-1 per os for 35 days, while group K (n=8) served as control. In both trials, the animals were slaughtered after a 6-days drug withdrawal and thymus and livers were collected and properly stored until the analysis was performed. Quantitative determinations of dexamethasone, prednisolone and its main metabolite, prednisone, in urine and liver samples were conducted by HPLC-MS/MS, after the analytical procedure was optimized and fully validated. The method validation included the assessment of specificity, linearity, precision, trueness, robustness, CCα and CCβ values. By a morphological point of view, severe atrophy of thymus parenchyma was observed in group A, together with a significant (P&lt; 0.005) reduction of the mean thymus weight (217 ± 94. g), while group B (646 ± 215. g) presented normal thymus features and weights (group C, 415 ± 116. g). Accordingly, no differences were found in trial 2 for groups D (727 ± 275. g) and K (642 ± 173. g).Average dexamethasone concentrations in group A urine samples ranged from 1.4 to 3.0μgL-1 during the treatment, while no residue was detected in the urine samples collected 6-7 days after the end of the treatment. Low amounts of dexamethasone (&lt;1μgL-1) were detected in liver samples of group A. All average prednisolone concentrations in group B urine samples (sum of conjugate and free form) turned out to be below 1.0μgL-1 during the treatment, despite the much higher concentration administered (15-30mgday-1) with respect to dexamethasone in group A (0.7mgday-1). No prednisolone residues were found in the urine and liver samples taken at the slaughterhouse. The absence of any prednisolone residue in the urine samples of control group animals supports the theory that the origin of this molecule is fundamentally exogenous, at least for this cattle category maintained under unstressing conditions. Remarkable findings are represented by the absence of thymus atrophy in the prednisolone treated animals and the extremely low residue concentrations found in urine during the treatment. Both findings reveal that the detection of illegal growth-promoting treatments with this drug is difficult. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Gene expression experiments were targeted in order to monitor the ABC efflux transporters, which is potentially involved in cellular detoxification/defense. Changes in expression levels of different ABC genes in kidney of Oncorhynchus mykiss fed with melamine and melamine+cyanuric acid enriched diets were recorded in both treated groups by mRNA ΔΔCT relative quantification method. Expression profiles of eight different ABC genes basically showed low alterations in melamine group and more consistent changes in melamine+cyanuric acid treated fish, compared with own control. In the last group ABCC2 gene over expression was the more evident alteration. These results suggest that ABC efflux system could be involved in mobilization of hydrophilic molecules in the forcing condition of chronic exposure. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Shellfish consumption has always been one of the major risk factors for Norovirus Infection, especially when these products are eaten raw or slightly cooked, because depuration and relaying arc inadequate to remove viruses from live bivalve shellfish. The aim of this work was to detect the presence of Norovirus in purified bivalve molluscs intended for human consumption. A total of 160 samples of purified bivalve molluscs (Mytilas galloproeinciakis) were examined by RT-booster PCR. The results showed the presence of viral RNA in 9,4% (15/160) of samples. These results demonstrated that the shellfish depuration treatments currently used are insufficient for the complete removal of noroviruses, therefore it is essential to improve these systems and the preventive measures.},

abstract={A real-time PCR method to detect fish DNA in feedstuffs was developed and optimised. A combination of primers and a Taqman-MGB probe was used to selectively amplify the fish mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA gene. Qualitative and also quantitative assessments were performed with different protocols: a relative quantification by a standard curve, and a ΔCT method, by total plant DNA as endogenous controls. Method specificity was evaluated analysing 40 different tissues (mammalians, avian, fish) and flour samples. Sensitivity was evaluated by LOD (limit of detection) estimation. The designed probe-primers set showed an increased sensitivity compared to previously published PCR end point method, reaching a limit of detection of 0.2 pg of fish DNA, and showing to be a robust assay for fish DNA detection. The quantification results, based on ΔCT method and the relative standard curve, are well reproducible in our experimental condition but, in lacking of separate pure raw materials of a tested feed, they cannot be applied for reliable and precise quantification on field samples but for now as a semi-quantitative PCR method only. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Downer cow syndrome is a bovine multifactorial disease characterized by the inability to rise to a standing position and to keep a quadrupedal walking with a consequent prolonged or permanent recumbency. Given the complexity of the syndrome and the multiplicity of causes, including the BSE, a systematic analysis of the condition is essential in order to reach a definitive diagnosis and to properly manage animals in the herd. The aim of the present study was to investigate downer cow syndrome in a small area of Piedmont, including Torino and Cuneo, through a precise diagnostic procedure in life and post-mortem. From March 2009 to February 2010, 103 downer cows were reported by 8 veterinarians applying a standard clinical protocol, followed by appropriate laboratory tests. Reported cases refer mainly Friesian cows with metabolic disorders in the peripartum period. A complete necropsy, organ-tissue-CNS sampling for histopathological examination and further investigations were performed on dead or euthanized cattle. Forty-six cows were cured, 20 were slaughtered and 37 died. Thirteen cows, 4 dead naturally and 9 euthanized were further investigated by necropsy, histological examination and bacteriology. All cases showed inflammatory lesions in the main organs and tissues. In 3 cases histopathological lesions (suppurative inflammations) were found in the CNS. The implementation of this surveillance network and the establishment of active partnerships between public authorities and private veterinarians is the goal of a correct management of the problem in the farm in order to provide specialist support to the farmer to safeguard animals' health and welfare as well as public health.},

abstract={Natural and synthetic corticosteroids are widely used in veterinary medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties, but are also illegally used in animal breeding as growth-promoting agents: this latter application in livestock production has been banned within the European Union due to health concerns for the consumer. In this work urine samples collected from bovines experimentally treated with dexamethasone (0.4 mg of dexamethasone 21-disodium phosphate per capita/day for 20 consecutive days) and bovines bred under strictly controlled conditions were investigated for the presence of natural and synthetic corticosteroids, using a simple multi-residue liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method, developed and validated in accordance with the criteria of the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. The aim of this work is to investigate the effect of a low dosage and long term dexamethasone treatment on the levels of endogenous corticosteroids in cattle and to evaluate the possible presence of prednisolone residues in bovines bred under strictly controlled conditions. Our findings confirm the high and rapid rate of dexamethasone urinary excretion. Dexamethasone treatment elicited an early reduction of hydrocortisone and cortisone, suggesting the disappearance of these two hormones as an indirect indicator of corticosteroid treatment in cattle. Prednisolone residues were found (concentration interval 0.4-1.4 ng mL-1) in urine samples collected from control bovines especially at the slaughterhouse, together with high levels of hydrocortisone and cortisone. Further studies are necessary to find out the reason of unexplained excretion of this hormone in urine samples of untreated bovines. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Rapid tests specific for sheep and goats became part of European Union-wide active scrapie surveillance in 2006. Performance of three approved TSE rapid tests for the detection of sheep infected with scrapie in field cases in the pre-clinical stage of the disease was compared. The medulla oblongata of 969 asymptomatic sheep of various genotype and breed aged over 18 months from 23 Italian flocks affected with scrapie, were tested by the Bio-Rad TeSeE Sheep/Goat (A), the IDEXX HerdChek BSE-Scrapie Antigen Test Kit, EIA (B) and the Prionics®-Check Western Small Ruminant (C) rapid tests Of 136 positive samples of classical scrapie, as confirmed by Western blot assay, 132 were positive with test A (Se 97.06%, CI 95% 92.64-99.19); 135 with test B (Se 99.26%, 95% CI 95.97-99.98) and 128 with test C (Se 94.12%, 95% CI 88.74-97.43).Tests A and B showed the best performance on analytical sensitivity. All three systems demonstrated good reproducibility: being the intrarater and interrater kappa coefficients always over 0.83.The one available atypical scrapie sample was positive with tests A and B, negative with test C. Considering the discrepant results in the detection of low PrPsc concentrations and of the atypical case, differences can be expected in the efficacy of an active surveillance system, depending on the test adopted. © 2011.},

abstract={A 7-year-old male German Shepherd dog in poor body condition had a 3-month history of intermittent hematuria. Nonregenerative anemia, mild leukocytosis, marked hypoalbuminemia, and hematuria were observed. Subsequently, marked neutrophilia and moderate monocytosis were noted; anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and hematuria persisted; and the dog developed disseminated intravascular coagulation. Ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen revealed the presence of an enlarged and irregularly shaped right kidney with a large area of cavitation, and a nephrectomy was performed 30 days after initial examination. Cytologic examination of fine-needle aspirates and imprints of the right kidney revealed a neoplastic cell population suggestive of renal carcinoma. The histopathologic diagnosis was chromophobic cystic-papillary renal carcinoma. The tumor cells expressed granulocytic/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), detected by immunohistochemical staining, and elaboration of GM-CSF by the tumor may have mediated the leukocytosis in this dog. Following excision of the tumor, neutrophil and monocyte counts were only mildly increased. The dog died 135 days after initial presentation, and a necropsy was not permitted. Paraneoplastic neutrophilic leukocytosis is an uncommon finding and may be caused by elaboration of CSF by neoplastic cells. ©2011 American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology.},

abstract={TB infection in goats has a virtually worldwide distribution, with reports in several countries, including Italy, Bulgaria, France, Spain, Great Britain, Germany, USA, Africa, India, Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina. According to the latest research, the goat is a highly susceptible host for Mycobacterium bovis and, in rarer cases, for M. caprae, M. tuberculosis and M. avium. The clinical manifestations of infection are quite vague and consist mostly in progressive wasting, shaggy appearance of the coat, decreased milk production, anorexia and intermittent cough. Despite the apparent kindness of symptoms, the pathological lesions are quite severe, with a tendency to generalization and development of open forms, with the possibility of spread of bacteria through saliva, faeces and aerosol. In order to provide a further contribution to knowledge on tuberculosis of the goats, in this paper the Authors describe a case of infection by Mycobacterium bovis within a farm in Valle d'Aosta, consisting of 185 goats and 20 cattle; about the diagnostic investigations carried out during the management of the outbreak, special attention is reserved to the pathological and histological pictures observed in 145 animals necropsied at the local slaughterhouses and the Aosta Section of the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale.},

abstract={The relationship between mortality and stressful weather is not only a complex health, social and environmental issue, but also becomes an economical problem when considering livestock. Future-climate scenarios suggest that higher global mean temperatures could result in marked changes in the frequency of extreme temperatures. The relationship between high temperature and mortality is well known in people living in urban areas, but it has been poorly investigated in livestock such as dairy cows. The aim of this study was to quantify the relationship between heat and mortality from all causes among dairy cows in Italy. We studied 6697 adult (≥24 months) dairy cows that died during the summer in the 5-year period 2002-2006 in three Italian districts (Brescia, Cuneo, Rome) which were selected because of the high livestock production and the availability of weather data for these geographical areas. A case-crossover design was applied using the temperature-humidity index (THI) as exposure of interest. Pooled odds ratio (OR) of mortality at high exposure values versus low exposure values was estimated. An exposure over the THI cut-off increased the risk of mortality by 1.6 times, with a 4% increase in mortality for each THI degree increase above the threshold. We found no effect modification for age-class, herd size or breed, but a certain degree of geographical heterogeneity was identified. The increased dairy cow mortality highlighted in this study should be considered when adopting animal welfare and farm management measures. This phenomenon can be prevented by adopting appropriate interventions to mitigate environmental thermal challenges. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Variability of pathological phenotypes within classical sheep scrapie cases has been reported for some time, but in many instances it has been attributed to differences in the PRNP genotype of the host. To address this issue we have examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blotting (WB) for the disease-associated form of the prion protein (PrPd), the brains of 23 sheep from five European countries, all of which were of the same ARQ/ARQ genotype. As a result of IHC examinations, sheep were distributed into five groups with different phenotypes and the groups were the same regardless of the scoring method used, 'long' or 'short' PrPd profiling. The groups made did not respond to the geographical origin of the cases and did not correlate with the vacuolar lesion profiles, which showed a high individual variability. Discriminatory IHC and WB methods coincided to detect a 'CH1641-like' case but otherwise correlated poorly in the classification of disease phenotypes. No other polymorphisms of the PRNP gene were found that could account for the pathological differences, except perhaps for a sheep from Spain with a mutation at codon 103 and a unique pathological phenotype. Preliminary evidence indicates that those different IHC phenotypes correlate with distinct biological properties on bioassay, suggesting that they are indicative of strain diversity. We therefore conclude that natural scrapie strains exist and that they can be revealed by detailed pathological examinations, which can be harmonized between laboratories to produce comparable results. © 2010 Crown copyright.},

abstract={In accordance with European Union regulations, from 5 February until 15 December 2008, sampling and analysis activities were conducted in Italy to assess the extent of contamination caused by thermotolerant Campylobacter in broiler chickens farmed nationwide. The survey involved 48 poultry slaughterhouses distributed across eleven regions of Italy, where the caeca and carcasses of 393 slaughter batches were sampled. A total of 284 batches (72.3%) gave positive results for Campylobacter spp. as follows: 52.1% were contaminated by C. jejuni, 55.6% by C. coli and 1.1% by C. lari. C. jejuni and C. coli were isolated together in 37 batches (13% of positive results). Campylobacter spp. was isolated only from the caeca in 251 slaughter batches (63.9%) including caecal isolates of C. jejuni (48.2%), C. coli (50.6%), and C. lari (1.2%). Carcasses from 182 batches (46.3%) were contaminated by C. jejuni in 40.7% of cases, C. coli in 57.7% and the absence of C. lari from all batches examined.

abstract={Background. Routine rapid testing for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) has highlighted some problems with BSE rapid test performance, the most significant being the number of initially reactive samples and the false positive results on autolyzed tissue. This point is important for BSE active surveillance in risk populations, because tissue autolysis is often unavoidable in routine cases. A robust test suitable for use on field material is therefore needed. To date, very limited information regarding the effect of autolysis on the robustness of rapid tests has been documented; therefore, the National Reference Centre for Animal Encephalopathies (CEA) rapid test laboratory selected 450 autolyzed and negative brain stem samples from fallen stock bovines older than 24 months to assess the specificity of four tests approved for BSE active surveillance: Biorad TeSeE, Enfer TSE version 2.0, Prionics Check LIA, and IDEXX Herd Check BSE Antigen Kit EIA. The samples were graded according to the degree of autolysis and then dissected into five portions, four of which randomly assigned to processing by rapid tests and one to be available for confirmatory Western blot analysis. Findings. The specificity of the four systems was 100% for all three grades of autolysis, while the percentage of initially reactive results was 0.00 (95%CI 0.00-0.82), 0.22 (95%CI 0.006-1.23), 0.44 (95%CI 0.05-1.60), and 0.89 (95%CI 0.24-2.26) for the Biorad TeSeE, the Prionics Check LIA, the IDEXX Herd Check BSE and the Enfer TSE tests, respectively. No association with the degree of autolysis could be drawn. Conclusions. The present study demonstrates that the four rapid tests can be considered well-running diagnostic tools regardless of tissue quality; nevertheless, the number of initial reactive samples reported for some systems must not be underestimated in routine testing. Furthermore the compliance with the reported performance can be guaranteed only when an ongoing high careful batch quality control system is in place. © 2010 Meloni et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={The possibility to use NIR scanning microscopy for the detection of bone fragments in feedingstuffs has been evaluated analysing sediments derived from commercial feedingstuffs samples spiked with MBM. The method appeared sensitive enough to reveal the presence of bone fragments for MBM concentration in the feedingstuffs as low as 0.05 wt.%. The identification of MBM is done versus vegetable ingredients. The validation test, performed on a series of feedingstuffs spiked at a 0.1 wt.% MBM level (the detection limit reached by the official EU method based on optical microscopy), indicated that sensitivity (100%) and specificity (96.30%) of the investigated method are satisfactory for possible applications in screening procedure. NIR microscopy analyses turned out to be reliable and fast (including a minimal operational time for the analyst) with the additional possibility to obtain a map of the sediment, with indicated the positions of bone fragments, that then could be selectively re-analyzed by NIR spectroscopy for confirmation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={This article reports the results of necropsy, parasitologic, microbiologic, histopathologic, immunohistochemical, indirect immunofluorescence, biomolecular, and serologic investigations on 8 striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) found stranded from August to December 2007 on the Ligurian Sea coast of Italy. Severe, nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis was found in 4 animals, as characterized by prominent perivascular mononuclear cell cuffing and macrophage accumulations in neuropil. These lesions were associated with mild lymphocytic-plasmacytic infiltration of choroid plexuses in 1 dolphin. Toxoplasma gondii cysts and zoites, confirmed by immunohistochemical labeling, were scattered throughout the brain parenchyma of 2 of the 4 dolphins. No viral inclusions were seen in the brain of any animal. Other findings included severe bronchointerstitial pneumonia and pulmonary atelectasis, consolidation, and emphysema. Parasites were identified in a variety of organs, including lung (Halocerchus lagenorhynchi). Microbiologic and serologic examinations for Brucella spp were negative on all 8 dolphins. The 4 animals with meningoencephalitis had serum antibodies against T gondii (titers ranging from 1:80 to 1:320) but not against morbillivirus. In contrast, the other 4 dolphins were seropositive for morbillivirus (with titers ranging from 1:10 to 1:40) but seronegative for T gondii. No morbillivirus antigen or nucleic acid was detected in the tissues of any dolphin. It is concluded that the severe lung and brain lesions were the cause of death and that T gondii was the likely etiologic agent of the cerebral lesions. Morbillivirus infection was not considered to have contributed to death of these animals. © The American College of Veterinary Pathologists 2010.},

To this purpose, we have evaluated the application of an integrated identification protocol by means ol biochemical and biomolecular methods to identity isolates from one hundred sea fish samples. Isolates previously positive to biochemical identification were subjected to species-specific PCR tor the identification of V. vulnificus, V. cholerae and V. parahaemolyticus toxigenic strains. The analyzed samples revealed the presence of 5 strains as V. vulnificus and 5 as V. cholerae, none of these were positive for V. parahaemolyticus. Sequencing confirmed only one sample as V. cholerae, allowing to correctly identify false positive samples. We can conclude that the biochemical tests should always be confirmed by molecular tests to obtain a correct identification.},

abstract={The aim of the present study is the evaluation of the performance of the histological method for the detection of microscopic lesions in sexual accessory glands of veal calves treated with 17β-estradiol for growth promoting purposes; our goal is to verify the possibility of its appliance as an offi official screening technique according to Decision 2002/657/CE. Microscopic examination of target organs of veal calves treated with low-dose 17β-estradiol and of control animals was carried out in blind by two pathologists. Prostate and bulbo-urethral glands from the treated animals distinctly differed from the controls: significant differences in the lesion score were highlighted in both organs with regard to some specific parameters between the two groups. This study shows that histopathology could identify illicit treatment by 17β-estradiol 15 days after the last drug administration, when the official test gave negative results. The preliminary evidence of the high specificity and sensitivity values of this analysis (up to Se = 96,3%, CI95%, 81,03%-99,91%; Sp 86,4%, CI95%, 65,1%-97,1%) suggests to complete its validation according to Decision 2002/657/EC. When these performance will be confirmed histopathology could be adopted as an official screening method in the National residue monitoring plan for the detection of oestrogenic illicit treatments.},

abstract={Listeria monocytogenes can cause severe invasive disease in humans and has been isolated from a variety of foods. This study aimed to investigate type diversity and distribution across sources by subtyping via PFGE a set of 300 L. monocytogenes isolates collected in Italy from foods over a five year period (from 2003 to 2007).The most frequent serotypes were 1/2a (45%), 1/2c (22%), and 4b/4e (16%); 5% of the isolates were untypeable by conventional serotyping. Significant associations were observed between serotype 1/2a with dairy (O.R.= 13.9) and 1/2c with meat (O.R.= 33.3). All isolates were typeable, generating 164 combined PFGE profiles. Of these, 121 were unique, being displayed by only one isolate. The other 43 profiles grouped the remaining isolates and were shared between two (N= 22), three (N= 10), four (N= 3) and five isolates (N= 4). The remaining 4 profiles were shared between 7, 14, 17 and 46 isolates, respectively. Some profiles (N= 7) were retrieved in samples collected in different years, indicating persistency in foods and processing plants. This research may pose the ground for designing a broad typing database which could ease the understanding of L. monocytogenes diversity and could be used for facilitating epidemiological investigations for the identification of listeriosis outbreaks. Data show how large subtype databases may facilitate the identification of common and source-specific types. More comprehensive databases may be needed to fully understand L. monocytogenes diversity and to provide useful data to be considered in epidemiological investigations. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Nor98 is an atypical scrapie strain characterized by a molecular pattern and brain distribution of the pathological prion protein (PrP Sc) different from classical scrapie. In Italy, 69 atypical cases have been identified so far and all were characterized as Nor98 strain. In this paper we report an unusual case in a sheep which showed immunohistochemical and molecular features of PrP Sc different from the other atypical cases. The sheep was from an outbreak where the index and the other four cases were affected by classical scrapie. Histopathological, immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses on the brain of the unusual case revealed the simultaneous presence of pathological features characteristic of Nor98 and classical scrapie. Interestingly, the prevalent disease phenotype in the brainstem was classical scrapie-like, while in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum the Nor98 phenotype was dominant. The sub-mandibular lymph node was positive and showed a PrP Sc molecular pattern referable to classical scrapie. The PrP genotype was AL 141RQ/AF 141RQ. Taken together, the occurrence of classical scrapie in the outbreak, the PrP genotype, the involvement of different cellular targets in the brain and the pathological and molecular PrP Sc features observed suggest that this unusual case may result from the co-existence of Nor98 and classical scrapie. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Spinocerebellar ataxia type15 (SCA15) is a pure ataxia characterized by very slow progression. Only seven families have been identified worldwide, in which partial deletions and a missense mutation of the inositol triphosphate receptor type I gene (ITPR1) have been reported. We examined a four-generation Italian family segregating an autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, in which linkage analysis was positive for the SCA15 locus. We performed a genomic real-time polymerase chain reaction to search for ITPR1 gene deletions in this family and in 60 SCA index cases negative for mutations in the SCA1-3, 6-8, 10, 12, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy genes. The deleted segments were characterized using a custom array comparative genomic hybridization analysis. We have identified two families with an ITPR1 gene deletion: in one, the deletion involved ITPR1 only, while in the other both sulfatase-modifying factor 1 and ITPR1. Clinical data of ten patients and brain MRI (available for six) showed that the phenotype substantially overlapped known SCA15 cases, but we also noted buccolingual dyskinesias, facial myokymias, and pyramidal signs never reported in SCA15. ITPR1 expression analysis of two deleted cases showed a half dose. Our results further support ITPR1 gene as causative of SCA15. The families reported show that SCA15 is present in Italy and has a greater variability in the age at onset and clinical features than previously reported. We propose that the search for ITPR1 deletions is mandatory in the clinical hypothesis of SCA15 and that ITPR1-reduced expression in blood may be a useful marker to identify SCA15 patients harboring genomic deletions and possibly point mutations causing reduction of mRNA level. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Background: During the last decade, active surveillance for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in small ruminants has been intensive in Europe. In many countries this has led to the detection of cases of atypical scrapie which, unlike classical scrapie, might not be contagious. EU legislation requires, that following detection of a scrapie case, control measures including further testing take place in affected flocks, including the culling of genotype susceptible to classical scrapie. This might result in the detection of additional cases. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of additional cases in flocks affected by atypical scrapie using surveillance data collected in Europe in order to ascertain whether atypical scrapie, is contagious.Results: Questionnaires were used to collect, at national level, the results of active surveillance and testing associated with flock outbreaks in 12 European countries. The mean prevalence of atypical scrapie was 5.5 (5.0-6.0) cases per ten thousand in abattoir surveillance and 8.1 (7.3-9.0) cases per ten thousand in fallen stock. By using meta-analysis, on 11 out of the 12 countries, we found that the probability of detecting additional cases of atypical scrapie in positive flocks was similar to the probability observed in animals slaughtered for human consumption (odds ratio, OR = 1.07, CI95%: 0.70-1.63) or among fallen stock (OR = 0.78, CI95%: 0.51-1.2). In contrast, when comparing the two scrapie types, the probability of detecting additional cases in classical scrapie positive flocks was significantly higher than the probability of detecting additional cases in atypical scrapie positive flocks (OR = 32.4, CI95%: 20.7-50.7).Conclusions: These results suggest that atypical scrapie is not contagious or has a very low transmissibility under natural conditions compared with classical scrapie. Furthermore this study stressed the importance of standardised data collection to make good use of the analyses undertaken by European countries in their efforts to control atypical and classical scrapie. © 2010 Fediaevsky et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={The olfactory system (OS) involvement in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies has lately been acknowledged in experimental studies: Prion spread to the nasal mucosa is known to occur in hamsters after intracerebral challenge, and olfactory neurons have been assessed as a route for prion neuroinvasion too. This study investigated whether the OS is involved in naturally occurring prion diseases. Samples of nasal mucosa taken at the level of medial nasal concha, ventral nasal concha and nasal septum from 24 natural scrapie affected sheep were examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence (IF), PET blot and Western Blot (WB) for scrapie prion protein (PrPSc). OS related brain areas of the selected sheep (olfactory bulb, olfactory tract, frontal cortex, pyriform lobe and hippocampus) were analyzed too. Prion spread was assessed both in peripheral and central OS of the examined sheep. Twenty one samples of olfactory mucosa were positive by WB; IHC confirmed WB positive results in 14 cases. PrPSc was mainly localized in the medial nasal concha at the level of the olfactory nerve perineurium, and it was also disclosed in the nasal associated lymphoid tissue. It was never detected in olfactory neurons and fibers. In the brain PrPSc staining intensity was higher in olfactory bulb and frontal cortex, where it appeared as submeningeal, subependymal and perivascular patterns. The finding of PrPSc both in the brain areas directly in contact to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in the olfactory nerve perineurium bounding the subdural space extension that surrounds nerve rootlets might be consistent with the recently discovered PrPSc presence in CSF.},

abstract={Genetic selection has been used to control transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) in sheep populations based on the association between PRNP polymorphisms and resistance to scrapie. In goats even if a protective role has been suggested for several polymorphisms (I142M, H143R, N146D/S, R154H, R211Q, Q222K) by different European studies, a similar, univocal association has not been proved so far. The aim of this paper was to identify target polymorphisms in goats and their potential applicability in a selection plan in Italy. For this purpose, the existing genetic data on modulating resistance to classical and atypical scrapie in goats in this country will be used as starting point. Two Italian case-control studies concluded that the polymorphism at codon 222 (from glutamine to lysine Q/K) is important in influencing the susceptibility of goats to classical scrapie. Moreover, goats are susceptible to an unusual form of scrapie, named Nor98, and the H154 mutation was shown to be statistically associated with this disease in goats in an Italian case-control study. Currently, a strategy based on killing goats carrying the H154 mutation is being applied to manage atypical scrapie outbreaks in Italy. The current situation in Italy bodes well for the applicability of breeding plans based on the K222 mutation; data from independent studies on the role of K222 as a protective or even a resistance factor and its frequency in several Italian breeds are available. In the near future, as new data on K222 will be reported, testing the application of selective culling in classical scrapie goat outbreaks may become feasible. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Directive 2003/126/EC defines the method for the determination of constituents of animal origin for official control of feedingstuffs. One of the hardest problems for microscopist is the differentiation between mammalian and poultry bones on the basis of some characteristics as colour and borders of the fragments, shape and density of osteocyte lacunae. The shape of osteocyte lacuna in poultry and mammals is often described in different way, elliptic or roundish according with the Author(s). The aim of this study was to analyze the characteristics of lacunae in chicken bones of different type. For this purpose, smashed fragments and histological sections of the same bone were compared in order to evaluate the microscopic aspect of lacunae in different breaking and trimming planes. According to the observations carried out, it was possible to infer that chicken osteocyte has a biconvex lens shape; however the different arrangement and some size variation of the osteocytes in the several bone segments influence the microscopic features of corresponding lacunae. Chicken bone is made of a parallel-fibered tissue, without osteons. This structure probably determines the plane fracture of the bone and consequently the different aspect of lacunae (from spindle-shaped to elliptic-roundish) we can see in chicken derived PAP (processed animal protein). For example, in the fragments obtained from smashed diaphysis, the prevalence of spindle-shaped lacunae is depending on the preferential breaking of the bone along longitudinal plane. Likewise, for the epiphysis, being made mostly by bone trabeculae with strange directions, the breaking happens along different planes, creating lacunae of various shape. Performing the official check of animal feedingstuffs, the presence of bone fragments with roundish or elliptic osteocyte lacunae induces the analyst to thinking that the meat and bone meal comes respectively from mammals and poultry or vice versa depending to the reference Author(s); apart from the final evaluation (also based on some other features of the fragments), it is important to consider that the chicken bones could show lacunae of different shapes (spindle, elliptic and roundish), in accordance with the type and the breaking of the involved skeleton segments.},

abstract={Salmonellosis is an important infection both in animals and in human beings. About the spreading of Salmonellosis in Italian cattle herds, the available data are poor and sporadic if we compared them with ones obtained in other countries. If we consider that there aren't any structured national prevalence studies in Italy, a valid contribution for estimating the presence of the infection in bovine was offered by the activity of the Istituti Zooprofilattici Sperimentali network. In this context, it was interesting to describe clinical symptoms, gross lesions and further laboratory results observed in reported outbreaks from 2002 and 2009 in Piedmont Region, in order to show how Salmonella infection is an emerging disease in bovine and to remark that a correct diagnostic approach in abortions, neonatal diarrhoea and sudden death in adult animals must include the detection of this pathogen. Thanks to the simultaneous application of general and specific cultural test for Salmonella spp., infection was observed in 12 herds, totally 16 strains, respectively belonging to four different serovars (typhimurium, veneziana, dublin, derby). Salmonella detection in 11 calves and 3 fetus confirms the correct diagnostic approach in order to control the presence and the diffusion of Salmonellosis in cattle farms.},

abstract={The present study was designed to examine, whether rabbits fed a diet containing High Fat (HF) could develop obesity and be predisposed to developing metabolic syndrome (Mets). The results have shown an increased adipose accumulation with a significant weight gain and an increase in abdominal circumference, periscapolar fat and liver weight in rabbits fed HF diets compared to rabbits fed a Low Fat (LFC) diet, associated with higher levels of plasma glucose, insulin and lower levels of High-Density-Lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in the rabbits fed the HF diets than the rabbits fed the LFC diet. An Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) has been performed to evaluate glucose metabolism; the plasma glucose levels in the rabbits fed the HF diets were constantly higher (statistically significant at 0, 60, 90, 120 and 240 min) than in the rabbits fed the LFC diet. The association between the HF diets and oxidative stress, indicated by the presence of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in plasma, has also been investigated; the rabbits fed the HF diets had higher ROS values than the rabbits fed the LFC diet. In addition, the protective effect of Spirulina platensis (SP), antioxidant of vegetable origin, has also been investigated. The SP supplementation (10 g kg-1 of the diet) did not have any effect on the morphological data or some parameters in plasma, while SP was able to reduce the ROS value in rabbits fed the high fat diet probably due to beneficial effect of the γ-hnolemc acid content in the SP. © Medwell Journals, 2009.},

abstract={Since 2001 in the frame of the passive surveillance for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy 243 clinical suspects were reported in Italy. The purpose of this study was to review the neuropathological diagnoses obtained in the period 2001-2009 in cattle displaying clinical signs consistent with BSE and not confirmed by histological, immunohistochemical and Western Blot investigations. Neuropathological observations were made in 230 animals and the whole Central Nervous System (CNS) of each animals was examined by histology. Moreover, immunohistochemistry for PrPSc at the level of frontal cortex was carried out in 100 animals in order to exclude the occurrence of atypical BSE. Neuropathological findings were detected in 36.9% cases and the differential diagnoses were classified as: non-suppurative meningo/encephalitis, listeriosis, degenerative diseases, suppurative meningo/encephalitis, neoplasia, malfomations. No histological lesions were found in 55.2% of the samples tested and the unsuitable ones were 7.9%. One case of BSE was detected but no case of atypical BSE was observed. This study has identified diseases and lesions that are encountered in the differential diagnosis of BSE and it has demonstrated that the surveillance system is a necessary tool in order to monitor neuropathological diseases and to discover of BSE cases.},

abstract={Somatostatin receptors (SSTR1-5) mediate antiproliferative effects. In C6 rat glioma cells, somatostatin is cytostatic in vitro via phosphotyrosine phosphatase-dependent inhibition of ERK1/2 activity mediated by SSTR1, -2, and -5. Here we analyzed the effects of SSTR activation on C6 glioma growth in vivo and the intracellular mechanisms involved, comparing somatostatin effects with selective agonists for SSTR1, -2, and -5 (BIM-23745, BIM-23120, BIM-23206) or receptor biselective compounds (SSTR1 and -2, BIM-23704; and SSTR2 and -5, BIM-23190). Nude mice subcutaneously xenografted with C6 cells were treated with somatostatin, SSTR agonists (50 μg, twice/day), or vehicle. Tumor growth was evaluated every 3 days for 19 days. The intracellular pathways responsible of SSTR effects in vivo were evaluated measuring Ki-67, phospho-ERK1/2, and p27 kip1 expression by immunohistochemistry in sections from explanted tumors. Somatostatin and SSTR1, -2, and -5 agonists strongly inhibited in vivo C6 tumor growth, intratumoral neovessel formation, Ki-67 expression, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and induced upregulation of p27 Kip1, whereas only a modest activation of caspase-3 was observed. Somatostatin (acting on SSTR1, -2, and -5) displayed the highest efficacy; SSTR5 selective agonist showed a stronger effect than SSTR1 agonist, and SSTR2 agonist was less effective. On the other hand, SSTR1 and -2 agonists maximally reduced tumor neovascularization. The combined activation of SSTR1 and -2 showed a synergistic activity, reaching a higher efficacy than BIM-23206, whereas the simultaneous activation of SSTR2 and -5 resulted in a response resembling SSTR5 effects. Thus the simultaneous activation of different SSTRs inhibits glioma cell proliferation in vivo through both direct cytotostatic and antiangiogenic effects.

abstract={Scrapie, a neurodegenerative disease of sheep and goats and one of several transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) has been subject to mandatory active surveillance in EU through rapid testing since 2002. Regulation EC/999/2001 on TSE surveillance requires that each Member State's National Reference Laboratory for TSE periodically verifies diagnostic standards and methods by comparative testing. In 2007 the Italian Reference Centre carried out the first ring trial for classical scrapie on a set of 21 negative and 9 positive homogenated brainstems, the latter consisting of three replicates of an ARQ/ARQ scrapie positive sample diluted 1:10, 1:20 and 1:50. The purpose of the study was to verify the interlaboratory agreement in term of Cohen's kappa (k) of the rapid systems currently used by the 25 national rapid test laboratories (RTLs) [laboratories: Biorad TeSeE (17 laboratories), Enfer TSE version 2.0 (4 laboratories), Idexx Herd chek BSE-scrapie antigen kit (3 laboratories) and Prionics check LIA SR (1 laboratory)]. Our results show that the agreement among the laboratories using the same rapid test varied between 0.84 and 1, while the estimated overall agreement among the 25 laboratories was very good (k-combined = 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.85-0.89). Nevertheless, as regards differences in analytical sensitivity among the rapid tests in use, under-recognition of pre-clinical scrapie cases by lower performing systems must be expected. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Background: Cancer is a major cause of death in domestic animals. Furthermore, many forms of pet neoplasm resemble that of their human counterparts in biologic behaviour, pathologic expression, and recognised risk factors.In April 2005, a pilot project was activated so as to establish a dog and cat tumour registry living in the Venice and Vicenza provinces (Veneto Region, north-eastern Italy), with the aim of estimating the incidence of spontaneous tumours.Results: Through a telephone survey, the estimates of canine and feline populations of the catchment area turned out to be of 296,318 (CI +/- 30,201) and 214,683 (CI +/- 21,755) subjects, respectively. During the first three years, overall 2,509 canine and 494 feline cases of neoplasia were diagnosed. In dogs, the estimated annual incidence rate (IR) per 100,000 dogs for all tumours was 282 in all the catchment area, whereas in cats the IR was much lower (IR = 77). Malignant and benign tumours were equally distributed in male and female dogs, whereas cats had a 4.6-fold higher incidence of malignant tumours than benign. In both dogs and cats, purebreds had an almost 2-fold higher incidence of malignant tumours than mixed breeds. Tumour incidence increased with age in both dog and cat populations.Conclusion: This study has provided estimates of incidence of spontaneous neoplasm in companion animals. Further attempts will be made to increase the accuracy in the population size assessment and to ascertain the real gap with the official regional canine demographic registry. Veterinary practitioners may also benefit from the tumour registry insofar they may obtain data for specific breeds, age groups or geographical areas. © 2009 Vascellari et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method based on the RNA polymerase alpha subunit (rpoA) gene was developed for the detection of the Vibrio genus. The specific primers were designed aligning the rpoA gene sequences available in GenBank of all Vibrio species. The specificity of the primers was tested against 35 Vibrio species. In addition, 12 species phylogenetically related to the Vibrio genus were used as negative control. Moreover, in order to eliminate any false-negative results, bacterium-specific primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene were introduced in the test as a noncompetitive internal amplification control. The rpoA primers correctly amplified all the Vibrio species considered. No cross-reaction was observed when tested against closely related species. To estimate the applicability of this method, 336 Vibrio wild-type strains isolated from Italian aquaculture products and from imported seafoods were tested. The sensitivity, tested using serial dilutions of different pure cultures of certified strains, resulted to 10 3 colony-forming units per milliliter. The assay proved to be specific, rapid, and reliable. It can be proposed as a routine screening technique for the confirmation of Vibrio genus in isolated colonies. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.},

abstract={Scrapie is a fatal, neurodegenerative disease of sheep and goats. It is also the earliest known member in the family of diseases classified as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) or prion diseases, which includes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), and chronic wasting disease in cervids. The recent revelation of naturally occurring BSE in a goat has brought the issue of TSE in goats to the attention of the public. In contrast to scrapie, BSE presents a proven risk to humans. The risk of goat BSE, however, is difficult to evaluate, as our knowledge of TSE in goats is limited. Natural caprine scrapie has been discovered throughout Europe, with reported cases generally being greatest in countries with the highest goat populations. As with sheep scrapie, susceptibility and incubation period duration of goat scrapie are most likely controlled by the prion protein (PrP) gene (PRNP). Like the PRNP of sheep, the caprine PRNP shows significantly greater variability than that of cattle and humans. Although PRNP variability in goats differs from that observed in sheep, the two species share several identical alleles. Moreover, while the ARR allele associated with enhancing resistance in sheep is not present in the goat PRNP, there is evidence for the existence of other PrP variants related to resistance. This review presents the current knowledge of the epidemiology of caprine scrapie within the major European goat populations, and compiles the current data on genetic variability of PRNP. © 2009 INRA EDP Sciences.},

abstract={Samples of conventional (n = 11) and organic (n = 81) milk, both raw and heat-treated, were analysed for the presence of synthetic antioxidants (butylated hydroxytoluene, butylated hydroxyanisole, dodecyl gallate, propyl gallate and octyl gallate) to verify whether those labelled as "organic" corresponded to EU Regulations on the use of additives in such products. The analysis detected only the antioxidant BHT and its aldehyde BHT-CHO in all 11 conventional milk and in 18 of 81 organic milk samples. The investigation highlights the importance of strict control of organic dairy production, since synthetic antioxidants added to feedstuff to prevent rancidity can be transferred to milk. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={To evaluate further the reactivity of prion-specific monoclonal antibodies containing the 89-112 or 136-158 prion protein (PrP) polypeptides, immunoprecipitations were performed on brain extracts from Italian bovines, sheep and goats with transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. No binding of IgG 89-112 or IgG 136-158 to PrP in normal brain extracts was detected. Conversely, both reagents immunoprecipitated PrP from bovine and bovine amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathies, and from typical and atypical scrapie brain extracts. The immunoprecipitated PrP bands mirrored the Western blot (WB) profile of the different prion strains, indicating universal affinity of two independent PrP regions for disease-associated PrP conformers regardless of species source and strain properties. Immunoprecipitation with motif-grafted antibodies increased the sensitivity of conventional detection methods based on centrifugation followed by WB, which was confirmed by assay of diluted samples using both methods. These reagents or derivative molecules may thus find broad applications in prion detection and research. © 2009 SGM.},

abstract={Currently, hepatitis A virus (HAV) detection is not yet included in the regulation provided for food safety controls. However, the 2073/2005/EC regulation on microbiological criteria applied to food takes into account the sanitary issue as to viral contaminationof food but postpones the definition of specific criteria for pathogenetic virus detection until reliable analytical methods are available. In this study, a PCR-based method for detection of HAV was subjected to a validation process in order to describe its performance and to check its reliability for shellfish monitoring. Shellfish were processed for virus recovery through PEG8000-mediated sedimentation. Viral RNA extraction was carried out with a commercial kit and extracted RNA was then subjected to a reverse transcriptase heminested PCR (rt-heminested PCR). Foetal rhesus monkey kidney (FRhK4) cell culture infected with HAV worked as positive control in the assay: so, also supernatant from infected FRhK4 cells was subjected to a parallel validation process, starting to RNA extraction. The validation process was carried out by establishing qualitative and semi-quantitative parameters concerning accuracy, precision, analytical specificity and sensitivity (limit of detection, LOD), robustness and stability. The HAV detection method for shellfish and supernatant from infected FRhK4 cells showed 100% accuracy and precision. It has proved robust and stable; the LOD of rt-heminested PCR was estimated as nine genomic copies of DNA target. The validation process has objectively demonstrated that the HAV detection method on shellfish has good performance, so it might be applied with enough reliability in food safety official controls. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.},

The prevalence of V. parabaeinolyticus was equal to 4.8%, with relatively low concentration values, close to the limit of detection of the method; none of the isolates showed tossigene property. A simulation of a thermal process used in the industry was set up. The cooking tests proved effective in ensuring the food safety of the shrimp processed, confirming the reduction in the amount of V. parahaemolyticus 104 cells/g.},

abstract={The genetics of the prion protein gene (PRNP) play a crucial role in determining the relative susceptibility to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) in several mammalian species. To determine the PRNP gene variability in European red deer (Cervus elaphus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra), the PRNP open reading frame from 715 samples was analysed to reveal a total of ten single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In red deer, SNPs were found in codons 15, 21, 59, 78, 79, 98, 136, 168 and 226. These polymorphisms give rise to 12 haplotypes, and one of which is identical to the PRNP of American wapiti (Rocky Mountain elk, Cervus elaphus nelsoni). One silent mutation at codon 119 was detected in chamois and no SNPs were found in roe deer. This analysis confirmed that European wild ruminants have a PRNP genetic background that is compatible with TSE susceptibility, including chronic wasting disease.},

abstract={Salmonella is one of the most common causes of human gastroenteritis often associated with pork consumption. The aims of this cross-sectional study were to collect preliminary data on the presence of Salmonella enterica in pigs in Piedmont (Italy), through sampling on farm and at slaughter and to gather pilot data on serotypes and phagetypes present in the sampled area and distribution of anti-microbial resistance among isolated strains. Salmonella was detected through culture and identified with Salmonella spp. and Salmonella Typhimurium PCR; positive samples were serotyped, phagetyped and tested for antibiotic susceptibility. Positive samples (from 9% of faeces up to 29% of tonsils) were found in 64% of the herds. Salmonella spp. was retrieved also from scalding water. Most of the isolates were Salmonella Derby, Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella 4,5,12:i:-. The results of Salmonella Typhimurium specific PCR suggested that Salmonella 4,5,12:i:- might be unrecognized by serotyping. Anti-microbial resistance was recorded in 75-100% of the isolates. Phagetyping allowed the identification of DT104B and DT46A strains. These results set the bases for further research studies that would aim to estimate the real herd prevalence in Piedmont and the diffusion of serotypes and anti-microbial resistant strains within the same region. © 2008 The Authors.},

abstract={The olfactory system (OS) is involved in many infectious and neurodegenerative diseases, both human and animal, and it has recently been investigated in regard to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Previous assessments of nasal mucosa infection by prions following intracerebral challenge suggested a potential centrifugal spread along the olfactory nerve fibers of the pathological prion protein (PrPSc). Whether the nasal cavity may be a route for centripetal prion infection to the brain has also been experimentally studied. With the present study, we wanted to determine whether prion deposition in the OS occurs also under field conditions and what type of anatomical localization PrPSc might display there. We report here on detection by different techniques of PrPSc in the nasal mucosa and in the OS-related brain areas of sheep affected by natural scrapie. PrP Sc was detected in the perineurium of the olfactory nerve bundles in the medial nasal concha and in nasal-associated lymphoid tissue. Olfactory receptor neurons did not show PrPSc immunostaining. PrPSc deposition was found in the brain areas of olfactory fiber projection, chiefly in the olfactory bulb and the olfactory cortex. The prevalent PrPSc deposition patterns were subependymal, perivascular, and submeningeal. This finding, together with the discovery of an intense PrPSc immunostaining in the meningeal layer of the olfactory nerve perineurium, at the border with the subdural space extension surrounding the nerve rootlets, strongly suggests a probable role of cerebrospinal fluid in conveying prion infectivity to the nasal submucosa.

abstract={In 1998 an atypical form of scrapie was first detected in sheep in Norway and nowadays it is described all over Europe; atypical scrapie in goats was instead reported only in France, Spain, Switzerland and Italy. PRNP polymorphisms, already known for their association to susceptibility/resistance to classical scrapie in sheep, are also involved in atypical scrapie. In particular the two alleles AHQ and AF141RQ represent risk factors for atypical scrapie in sheep. The AHQ allele was already described in atypical scrapie affected goats but statistical analysis of the association between Nor98 and goat PRNP polymorphisms has not been reported previously. The aim of this study was to fill this gap carrying out a case-control study on 8 affected goats and 246 negative goats belonging to 8 Italian atypical scrapie Nor98 outbreaks. Results obtained applying chi-square test showed a significant association between AHQ allele and the disease (p-value=0,002). In light of the data reported in this study, the strategy based on the selective culling of susceptible goats could be an effective measure to decrease the risk of atypical scrapie Nor98 inside the outbreaks.},

abstract={Background: Whole gene duplication of the lamin B1 gene (LMNB1), encoding for a protein of the nuclear lamina, causes an adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD). Clinical features of ADLD (onset in adult life, dysautonomic symptoms, followed by pyramidal and cerebellar dysfunctions) partially resemble those of multiple sclerosis (MS), particularly the primary-progressive form. Our aim was to test whether LMNB1 gene mutations were present amongst patients with a diagnosis of MS. Methods: One hundred eighty-two MS patients were screened for copy number variations of the LMNB1 gene using a qPCR assay. Point mutations in the LMNB1 gene were searched by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing in a subgroup of 16 patients with familial MS. Results: No duplication/deletion of the lamin B1 gene was found amongst MS patients, and no point mutation was identified in the familial cases. Conclusion: Our work indicates that lamin B1 defects are probably not responsible for signs and symptoms resembling multiple sclerosis. © 2009 EFNS.},

abstract={Spoligotyping and exact tandem repeat (ETR) analysis of Mycobacterium bovis and M. caprae isolated strains has been routinely carried out in Italy since 2000 to obtain a database of genetic profiles and support traditional epidemiological investigations. In this study, we characterized 1,503 M. bovis and 57 M. caprae isolates obtained from 2000 to 2006 in 747 cattle herds mainly located in northern Italy. We identified 81 spoligotypes and 113 ETR profiles, while the combination of spoligotyping/ETR analysis differentiated 228 genotypes, with genotypic diversity indices of 0.70 (spoligotyping), 0.94 (ETR-A to -E typing), and 0.97 (spoligotyping/ETR-A to -E typing), respectively. Despite the high degree of resolution obtained, the spoligotyping/ ETR methods were not discriminative enough in the case of genotypes characterized by the combination of SB0120, the predominant spoligotype in Italy, with the most common ETR profiles. To obtain a more informative subset of typing loci, 24 mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable-number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) markers were evaluated by analyzing a panel of 100 epidemiologically unrelated SB0120 isolates. The panel was differentiated into 89 profiles with an overall genotypic diversity of 0.987 that could be also achieved by using a minimal group of 13 loci: ETR-A, -B, and -E; MIRU 26 and 40; and VNTR 2163a, 2163b, 3155, 1612, 4052, 1895, 3232, and 3336. The allelic diversity index and the stability of single loci was evaluated to provide the most discriminative genotyping method for locally prevalent strains.

abstract={Dexamethasone is a potent synthetic corticosteroid widely employed as a therapeutic agent in cattle. Besides this legal use, corticosteroids are also administered at low dosages as growth-promoters either alone or in combination with other steroids or with β-agonists. For this reason, appropriate control plans are established to survey corticosteroid misuse, using liver or urine as biological matrices. Since few data are available about the kinetics of dexamethasone excretion in meat cattle, an experimental study was designed to assess the drug residue levels in urines following either a therapeutic (60 μg of dexamethasone sodium phosphate/kg b.w., for three consecutive days) or a growth-promoting schedule (0.7 or 1.4 mg of dexamethasone sodium phosphate per capita/day for 60 days). The urinary elimination of dexamethasone, which was predominantly excreted in the unmodified form, was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry at different time intervals, i.e. during the treatments and after appropriate withdrawal times. Our findings confirm the high and rapid rate of dexamethasone urinary excretion irrespective of the nature of the treatment, and provide useful reference values that can be conveniently employed for forensic purposes. © 2009 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Background and aim: Duplication of the lamin B1 gene (LMNB1) has recently been described in a rare form of autosomal dominant adult-onset leucoencephalopathy. The aim of the study was to evaluate the presence of LMNB1 gene defects in a series of eight patients with diffuse adult-onset hereditary leucoencephalopathy. Methods: Clinical features of tested patients included a variable combination of pyramidal, cerebellar, cognitive and autonomic dysfunction. Neuroradiological data (MRI) showed symmetrical and diffuse white-matter lesions in six cases, and multifocal confluent lesions in two. LMNB1 full gene deletion/duplication and point mutations were searched using a TaqMan real-time PCR assay and direct sequencing of all coding exons. Results: One patient carried a 140-190 kb duplication involving the entire LMNB1 gene, the AX748201 transcript and the 39 end of the MARCH3 gene. Clinical and neuroimaging data of this proband and an affected relative overlapped with the features already described in patients with LMNB1 duplication. Lamin B1 expression was found increased in lymphoblasts. No LMNB1 gene defect was identified in the remaining seven probands. Conclusions: LMNB1 gene duplication appears characteristic of a subset of adult-onset autosomal dominant leucoencephalopathies, sharing autonomic dysfunction at onset, diffuse T2-hyperintensity of supra- and infratentorial white matter, sparing of U-fibres and optic radiations. The variable phenotypes in the remaining cases lacking LMNB1 defects (five with autosomal dominant transmission) suggest that adult-onset leucoencephalopathies are genetically heterogeneous.},

abstract={L. monocytogenes represents a primary concern in the production of Gorgonzola, a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) Italian blue-veined cheese produced only in the Piedmont and Lombardy regions. L. monocytogenes isolates (N = 95) obtained from Gorgonzola rinds, paste, and production/ripening environments were serotyped and then genotyped using Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). The goal of this study was to investigate the variability of L. monocytogenes PFGE-types across different PDO Gorgonzola manufacturers (N = 22). The majority of the strains (88%) were serotyped as 1/2a. PFGE identified 2 major pulse-types grouping 62 strains, detected from different plants and years, suggesting the presence of persistent and niche-adapted L. monocytogenes. In 9 plants, environmental strains shared the same pulse-types with strains from rinds or paste, suggesting a possible transmission pathway. Encouragingly, L. monocytogenes was retrieved from only 1 paste, indicating that production processes were under control in 21 plants. In the remaining plant, un-effective pasteurization or cross-contamination during production processes could be the cause of the contamination. Consequently, it is imperative that producers operate under the total respect of the Good Manufacturing Practices and following the principles of the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point plans, in order to contain contamination throughout the whole processing. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Total red cells did not show statistical differences between groups, while total leucocytes were lower (P≤0.05) for BSh hens Heterophyl/Lymphocyte (H/L) ratio of BSh was lower (P≤0.01) than IBh (0.33 vs. 0.82). IBh α-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP) mean concentrations were affected by time: The values registered after 15 d (T1) and 2 months (T2) of observation were similar (345±132 and 279±58 μg/ml respectively), while AGP value registered after 4 months (T3) were significantly higher (700±487 μg/ml); BSh did not display any AGP statistical variation over time. IBh albumin mean concentration (1.62 g/dL) was statistically lower than BSh values (1.89 g/dL); in both groups no effect of time of sampling was recorded. Acute phase protein (APP) values of BSh suggested a more adaptive attitude to free range conditions and appeared more constant over time. The present findings suggest genetic or adaptive differences affecting egg quality, physiological and immunological parameters.},

abstract={In 2001, antibodies to Brucella spp. were detected in the wild boar (Sus scrofa) population of Regional Park in the Piedmont, northwest Italy. This was the first report of swine brucellosis in Italian wildlife, and in response, we conducted a survey on wild boars culled in the park to evaluate the presence and epidemiologic pattern of Brucella. In total, 2, 267 serum samples and 1, 841 tissue samples were collected and tested from 2001 to 2007. Differences in antibody and infection prevalence among sampling years were statistically significant (x 2 =28.2, P&lt;0.0001 and x 2 =27.8, P&lt;0.0001, respectively).

abstract={Canine mammary tumours are generally treated with surgery alone, despite the fact that 50% of them are malignant and many will eventually lead to recurrence or metastases. A prospective clinical trial in which dogs with aggressive mammary carcinoma of clinical stages IV and V were treated with surgical excision (n = 9) or with surgery and adjuvant weekly gemcitabine (n =10) for at least four cycles was conducted. Gemcitabine was given as an intravenous infusion at the dose of 800 mg m-2. Aim of the study was to explore potential beneficial effects of gemcitabine on time to local recurrence (TTR), time to distant metastases (TTM) and overall survival (OS) in canine patients with operated mammary tumours bearing high risk for locoregional failure and distant metastases. Also, factors associated with OS, including neutering status, body weight, age, clinical stage at presentation, tumour size, histological grade and, in dogs receiving chemotherapy, the number of gemcitabine treatments, were investigated. Finally, acute toxicities related to chemotherapy and quality of life were assessed in dogs receiving gemcitabine. Dogs treated with surgery alone or surgery followed by gemcitabine had no difference in TTR, TTM or OS (P &gt; 0.05). In the group of dogs receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, the number of gemcitabine treatments was positively correlated with OS (P = 0.017). Gemcitabine treatment was well tolerated, with no dogs experiencing clinically relevant haematological or gastrointestinal toxicity. Despite being safe at the present dose, gemcitabine chemotherapy as an adjunct treatment to surgical excision may not be recommended in dogs with aggressive mammary carcinoma. © 2008 The Authors.

abstract={Malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) is a fatal, systemic disease of cattle and other domestic and wild ruminants that, in Europe, is caused by Ovine herpesvirus 2 (OvHV-2). American bison (Bison bison) are highly susceptible to the disease. An adult American bison, housed in a zoo in southern Italy in close cohabitation with a group of domestic sheep (Ovis aries aries) displayed clinical signs that resembled the acute form of MCF. By real-time polymerase chain reaction, OvHV-2 DNA was detected intravitam in blood, in nasal and ocular swabs, and postmortem in tissue samples of the bison. By indirect fluorescent antibody test, high MCF antibody titers were found in the bison serum. Ovine herpesvirus 2 DNA and antibodies were also found in blood samples from the domestic sheep, thus suggesting a potential role of these animals as a source of the infection. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first MCF case in captive ruminants in Italy and the second confirmed case in captive bison of European zoos.},

Sixty dogs belonging to a veterinary clinic were evaluated together with their owners to investigate their alimentary habits. A dietary questionnaire was given to the dog owners to fill in. A logistic regression model was performed to study any association between diet and GERD symptoms. The results showed an endoscopic GERD presence of 20% in dogs similar to that found in humans. A relationship between diet and GERD symptoms and between GERD symptoms in the dogs and owners was also present.

abstract={Somatostatin inhibits cell proliferation through the activation of five receptors (SSTR1-5) expressed in normal and cancer cells. We analyzed the role of individual SSTRs in the antiproliferative activity of somatostatin in C6 rat glioma cells. Somatostatin dose-dependently inhibited C6 proliferation, an effect mimicked, with different efficacy or potency, by BIM-23745, BIM-23120, BIM-23206 (agonists for SSTR1, -2, and -5) and octreotide. The activation of SSTR3 was ineffective, although all SSTRs are functionally active, as demonstrated by the inhibition of cAMP production. All SSTRs induced cytostatic effects through the activation of the phosphotyrosine phosphatase PTPη and the inhibition of ERK1/2. For possible synergism between SSTR subtypes, we tested the effects of the combined treatment with two agonists (SSTR1+2 or SSTR2+5) or bifunctional compounds. The simultaneous activation of SSTR1 and SSTR2 slightly increased the efficacy of the individual compounds with an IC 50 in between the single receptor activation. SSTR2+5 activation displayed a pattern of response superimposable to that of the SSTR5 agonist alone (low potency and higher efficacy, as compared with BIM-23120). The simultaneous activation of SSTR1, -2, and -5 resulted in a response similar to somatostatin. In conclusion, the cytostatic effects of somatostatin in C6 cells are mediated by the SSTR1, -2, and -5 through the same intracellular pathway: activation of PTPη and inhibition of ERK1/2 activity. Somatostatin is more effective than the individual agonists. The combined activation of SSTR1 and -2 shows a partial synergism as far as antiproliferative activity, whereas SSTR2 and -5 activation results in a response resembling the SSTR5 effects.

abstract={Feline spongiform encephalopathy (FSE) is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy associated with the consumption of feedstuffs contaminated with tissue from bovine spongiform encephalopathy-affected cattle and characterized by the accumulation in the central nervous system of an abnormal isoform of the prion protein (PrP sc). Clinically, it presents as a progressive fatal neurologic syndrome that is not easily distinguished from other feline neurologic conditions. Most cases of FSE have been reported in England, where it was first detected in 1990, but a few cases have been reported from other European countries. To identify possible cases of FSE in Italy, the Italian Ministry of Health funded a 2-year surveillance project during which the brains from 110 domestic cats with neurologic signs were evaluated histologically for spongiform encephalopathy and immunohistochemically to detect PrP sc. Although no cases of FSE were found, the study proved useful in monitoring the Italian cat population for other neurologic diseases: neoplasia (21.8%), toxic-metabolic encephalopathy (18.2%), granulomatous encephalitis (15.5%), suppurative encephalitis (4.6%), trauma (3.6%), circulatory disorders (3.6%), degeneration (2.7%), nonsuppurative encephalitis (2.7%), and neuromuscular diseases (1.8%). No histologic lesions were found in 20% of the brains, and samples from 5.5% of the cats were rejected as unsuitable.},

funding_text 1={The aim of this project, as in a previous study, 15 was to search for possible FSE cases in the Italian feline population. However, in our sample of 110 adult cats with neurologic signs, no cases of FSE were found. Even so, this is the first detailed diagnostic evaluation of a large case series of neurologic disease in the Italian cat population. Some of the clinical signs in cats in this study have been described in FSE, 37 which emphasizes the importance of screening cats with neurologic disease for possible cases of FSE. In this study, the most common neurologic lesions were categorized as neoplasia, toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, and granulomatous inflammation. Lymphoma was the most common brain tumor, but has been second to meningioma in most studies. 17 , 20 , 21 , 30 Cats with lymphoma are variably seropositive for FeLV or FIV; 7 , 31 however, all samples from the 8 cats with lymphoma in this study were negative for FIV antibodies and FeLV antigens. In 5 cases, lymphoma involved mainly the meninges of the brain and in 1 case was confined in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus of the obex. Similar localizations of this tumor were described in another study. 2 Thiamine deficiency encephalopathy in cats usually results from a fish diet rich in thiaminase; thiamine deficiency also may develop after consumption of meat preserved with sulfur dioxide. 28 The lesions in our cats were similar to those reported in other cases of thiamine deficiency. 4 As described in a previous report, 8 cats with hippocampal necrosis had bilateral degenerative lesions confined to the hippocampus and the pyriform lobe. The lesions resembled those of feline ischemic encephalopathy (FIE), but FIE was not found in this series. Feline ischemic encephalopathy is characterized by asymmetric cerebral signs and lesions that are attributed to ischemia; in some cases, a parasitic cause has been demonstrated. 34 The pathogenesis of hippocampal necrosis is still unknown. 9 FIP, which comprised the category of granulomatous inflammation, was diagnosed in 15.5% of the samples, but its prevalence in the Italian cat population as a whole was probably underestimated because FIP mainly affects cats less than 1 year old, an age range excluded by the study protocol. All 3 cases of nonsuppurative encephalitis were diagnosed as pseudorabies. This herpesvirus infection occurs in cats after ingestion of contaminated pork; however, in these cases, no consumption of infected meat was reported by the cat owner. The clinical signs in our cases were similar to those in a previous report, 12 except for the lack of pruritus, which has also been absent in some natural and experimental cases. 10 The pathologic findings in the brain were the same as described elsewhere. 6 , 28 Eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions may be found in neurons in pseudorabies but were absent in our cats. Cerebellar abiotrophy has been described in most species, including cats, dogs, cattle, sheep, horses, and swine. A hereditary basis (usually consistent with autosomal recessive transmission) for the disease has been hypothesized. The clinical signs of cerebellar hypoplasia, caused by in utero exposure to the panleukopenia virus, 14 differ from those of cerebellar abiotrophy in that the former are present at birth or in the neonatal period and are nonprogressive. Our cats, in contrast, were normal at birth and acquired signs at around 1 year of age. Histopathologically, the lesions of cerebellar abiotrophy differed from the classic panleukopenia virus lesions, which include failure of normal development of the granular cell layer and disorganization and loss of Purkinje cells. 14 , 29 , 35 Motor neuron disease (MND) is a group of disorders whose principal clinical and pathologic features are related to degeneration and loss of motor neurons. Most MND syndromes predominantly affect the lower motor neurons of the spinal cord and brain stem; however, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most notable MND in humans, may affect the upper motor neurons of the cerebral cortex. 33 To our knowledge, lesions of MND in animals have been restricted to the ventral horns of the spinal cord and the brain stem. However, the lesions observed in the 1 case of MND resembled those in human beings with progressive muscular atrophy, a form of ALS. The prevalence and pathogenesis of MND in cats are unknown. 26 In the cases of diabetic polyneuropathy and ischemic neuromyopathy, lesions were limited to the peripheral nervous system. Diabetic polyneuropathy, which commonly affects diabetic dogs and cats, is caused in part by prolonged hyperglycemia and results in dysfunction of one or both tibial nerves and a plantigrade stance. Clinical signs may resolve with treatment to regulate blood glucose. The pathologic features of this condition closely resemble those of human diabetic neuropathy. 22 Multiple factors, such as vascular, mechanical, and biochemical disturbances, have been proffered as likely causes of axon and Schwann cell derangements in dogs and cats. 3 Ischemic neuromyopathy occurs in cats with cardiomyopathy and is caused by occlusion of the aortic trifurcation with thromboembolic obstruction of the internal and external iliac arteries and the median sacral artery. Ischemia of muscle and peripheral nerve is exacerbated by vasoconstriction of the collateral circulation, induced by platelet substances such as serotonin and thromboxane A2. Histopathologic studies have disclosed that peripheral nerve changes develop at the level of the middle to lower thigh. Proximal to the level of ischemic degeneration of axons, nerve fibers commonly undergo paranodal and segmental demyelination. 27 The lesions in our case were identical to those described in a previous report. 18 Only 2 of the 110 brains had spongiform changes with vacuolation at the obex; however, no evidence of PrP sc deposition was detected by immunohistochemistry, and one fifth (20%) of the samples had no neurologic lesions or pathologic alterations elsewhere. An in-depth neurologic examination in these cases would have facilitated correlation of clinical signs with the neuropathologic changes. However, because this part of our data was incomplete, no such correlation could be established. Nevertheless, this study demonstrated that concerted cooperation between pathologists and clinicians enhances diagnostic accuracy in cases of neurologic disease. Within the framework of the project, the participating study centers set up an archive of feline neurologic diseases. The authors wish to thank C. L. Florio, M. Corsi, P. Gazzuola, and SINVet.

abstract={Background: Human variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) results from foodborne transmission of prions from slaughtered cattle with classical Bovine Spongiform, Encephalopathy (cBSE).forms of B5E, which remain mostly asymptornatic in aging cattle, were recently identified at slaughterhouses throughout Europe and North Americo, raising a question about human susceptibility to these new prion strains. Methodology/Principal Findings: Brain homogenates from cattle with classical BSE and atypical (BASE) infections were inoculated intracerebrally into cynomolgus monkeys (Macacca fascicularis), a non-human primate model previously demonstrated to be susceptible to the original strain of cBSE. The resulting diseases were compared in terms of clinical signs, histology and biochemistry of the abnormal prion protein (PrPres), The single monkey infected with BASE had a shorter survival, and a different clinical evolution, histopathology, and prion protein (PrPres) pattern than was observed for either classical BSE or vCID-inoculated animals. Also, the biochemical signature of PrPres in the BASE-inoculated animal was found to: have a higher proteinase K sensitivity of the octa-repeat region. We found the same biochemical signature in three of four human patients With sporadic CJD and an MM type 2 PrP genotype who lived in the same country as the infected bovine. Conclusion/Significance: Our results point to a possibly higher degree of pathogenicity of BASE than classical BSE in primates and also raise a question about a possible link to one uncommon subset of cases of apparently sporadic CJD. Thus, despite the waning epidemic of classical BSE, the occurrence of atypical strains should temper the urge to relax measures currently in place to protect public health from accidental contamination by BSE-contaminated products. © 2008 Comoy et al.},

abstract={As a result of bovine tuberculosis eradication plans in Europe and Italy, advanced stages of the infection are less often reported at abattoir post mortem inspection, whereas early stages of bovine tuberculosis mainly represented by primary complexes are most commonly observed. Rapid diagnosis and identification of these lesions are pivotal. In this frame the contribution of histopatological ex amination is helpful, but it is necessary to evaluate its sensibility and specificity. This study evaluated the accuracy of histopathological examination by hematoxylin and eosin (HE), ZN and Auramine- Rodamine staining and immunohistochemistry using polyclonal anti-Mycobacterium bovis antibody. For this purpose we analysed samples of 173 bovine lymph nodes belonging to cattle displaying suspected lesions at abattoir post-mortem inspection and with known result at mycobacterial culture. Histopathology sensitivity resulted 97.5% when the inconclusive lesion were considered as negative, and 93.4% when were reviewed as positive. The ZN staining was less sensitive, (33.9%) but high specific too (100%), while IHC and Auramine-Rodamine staining showed sensitivity and specificity respectively of 67.3%% and 94.6% and 44.23% and 97.30%. The results suggest that histopathological examination is a reliable tool for rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis from suspected tubercular lesions and its differentiation from other causes, whereas histochemical and immunohistochemical staining are not useful in eradication plans.},

abstract={Aims: To determine the variability of the prion protein gene (PRNP) in goats from Northern and Southern Italy. Methods and results: Genomic DNA isolated from goat blood was polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified for the coding region of the PRNP gene and then sequenced. In total, 13 polymorphic sites were identified: G37V, T110P, G127S, M137I, I142M, I142T, H143R, R154H, P168Q, T194P, R211Q, Q222K and S240P (substitutions I142T and T194P are novel) giving rise to 14 haplotypes. Clear frequency differences between Northern and Southern breeds were found and confirmed by genetic distance analysis. Conclusions: Differences in allele distribution were found between Northern and Southern goats, in particular regarding the M142 and K222 alleles, possibly associated to scrapie resistance; philogeographical analysis supported the idea that Northern and Southern breeds may be considered as separate clusters. Significance and impact of the study: In Italy only limited studies have been carried out on caprine PRNP genotype distribution; this study is important to fill this lack of information. Moreover the finding of significant differences among allele distributions in Northern and Southern goats, especially if involved in modulating resistance/susceptibility, need to be carefully considered for the feasibility of selection plans for resistance to scrapie. © 2008 The Authors.},

abstract={The disease phenotype of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and the molecular/ biological properties of its prion strain, including the host range and the characteristics of BSE-related disorders, have been extensively studied since its discovery in 1986. In recent years, systematic testing of the brains of cattle coming to slaughter resulted in the identification of at least two atypical forms of BSE. These emerging disorders are characterized by novel conformers of the bovine pathological prion protein (PrPTSE), named high-type (BSE-H) and low-type (BSE-L). We recently reported two Italian atypical cases with a PrPTSE type identical to BSE-L, pathologically characterized by PrP amyloid plaques and known as bovine amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy (BASE). Several lines of evidence suggest that BASE is highly virulent and easily transmissible to a wide host range. Experimental transmission to transgenic mice overexpressing bovine PrP (Tgbov XV) suggested that BASE is caused by a prion strain distinct from the BSE isolate. In the present study, we experimentally infected Friesian and Alpine brown cattle with Italian BSE and BASE isolates via the intracerebral route. BASE-infected cattle developed amyotrophic changes accompanied by mental dullness. The molecular and neuropathological profiles, including PrP deposition pattern, closely matched those observed in the original cases. This study provides clear evidence of BASE as a distinct prion isolate and discloses a novel disease phenotype in cattle. © 2008 Lombardi et al.},

abstract={Rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis in cattle reacting positive in antemortem assays is crucial in countries where eradication programs are operated to confirm the presence of the infection in tuberculosis-free herds. This study evaluated the accuracy of histopathologic examination by hematoxylin and eosin and Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining applied in this framework, when suspected lesions are caused by low infectious doses and are detected in early stages of the disease. For this purpose, histologic methods were compared with mycobacterial culture as reference test on suspected lymph node samples from 173 cattle reacting positive in antemortem tests. Histopathology demonstrated high sensitivity (93.4%) and specificity (92.3%), while ZN sensitivity and specificity were respectively 33.9% and 100%. There was good agreement between histopathology and bacterial culture, suggesting that histopathologic examination is a reliable tool for rapid diagnosis in countries where active tuberculosis eradication programs allow the prompt identification and elimination of reactor cattle. Histopathology permits identification of typical mycobacterial lesions and its differentiation from other causes.},

abstract={A monoclonal antibody (mAb) panel to bovine prion protein (PrP) was studied by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry for scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy. A mAb panel recognized both normal (PrP C ) and abnormal (PrP Sc ) isoforms of PrP in murine, ovine and bovine brain tissues. Interestingly, an anti-bovine PrP mAb, 1D12, prepared by immunizing PrP gene-knockout mice with a synthetic polypeptides corresponding to codons 153-166 of the bovine PrP gene showed novel patterns of reactivity for prion-uninfected neuronal cells. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-mapping of the mAb epitopes resulted in a reaction of monoclonal 1D12 to YEDRY and M corresponding to amino acids 156-160 and 165 of bovine PrP. Several patterns of bovine PrP C distribution in PrP-deficient neuronal cells (HpL3-4) transfected with bovine PrP were observed after different fixation methods. Stained cell surface was observed after formalin fixation by immunofluorescent assay of 1D12 with confocal microscopy, whereas granules in nucleus were stained after acetone fixation. No reactivity in the nucleus was observed to HpL3-4, or HpL3-4mPrP cells expressing mouse PrP. This is the first paper that has reported the detection of the PrP C at both cell surface and nuclei of prion-uninfected cell line. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The importance of Trasmissible Spongiform Encephalopaties in small ruminants increased after the discovery in France of a natural BSE case in a goat. Selection has been used to control TSE in sheep populations because of the association between PRNP polymorphisms and resistance to scrapie. In goats, however, a similar association has not been proved so far. In Italy only limited studies have been carried out on caprine PRNP genotype distribution; the aim of this study was to determine the variability of the PRNP gene in goat populations from two Northern italian regions: Piemonte and Valle d'Aosta. Coding region of PRNP has been sequenced for 364 goats. In total, eight polymorphic sites were identified giving rise to nine alleles. The two analysed caprine populations were different regarding PRNP genetic variability; breeds reared in Piemonte were similar each other, while Valdostana breed seems to be a different population. Differences in allele frequencies, if related to alleles potential candidates for modulating resistance/susceptibility, need to be taken into account for future breeding programs.},

abstract={The coordinated activity of estrogens and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family agonists represents the main determinant of breast cancer cell proliferation. Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) enhances extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) activity via the transactivation of EGFR and 17β-estradiol (E2) induces SDF-1 production to exert autocrine proliferative effects. On this basis, we evaluated whether the inhibition of the tyrosine kinase (TK) activity of EGFR may control different mitogenic stimuli in breast tumors using the EGFR-TK inhibitor gefitinib to antagonize the proliferation induced by E2 in T47D human breast cancer cells. EGF, E2, and SDF-1 induced a dose-dependent T47D cell proliferation, that being nonadditive suggested the activation of common intracellular pathways. Gefitinib treatment inhibited not only the EGF-dependent proliferation and ERK1/2 activation but also the effects of SDF-1 and E2, suggesting that these activities were mediated by EGFR transactivation. Indeed, both SDF-1 and E2 caused EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. The molecular link between E2 and SDF-1 proliferative effects was identified because 1,1′-(1,4-phenylenebis(methylene))-bis-1,4,8,11- tetraazacyclotetradecane octahydrochloride (AMD3100), a CXCR4 antagonist, inhibited SDF-1- and E2-dependent proliferation and EGFR and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. EGFR transactivation was dependent on c-Src activation. E2 treatment caused a powerful SDF-1 release from T47D cells. Finally, in SKBR3, E2-resistant cells, EGFR was constitutively activated, and AMD3100 reduced EGFR phosphorylation and cell proliferation, whereas HER2-neu was transactivated by SDF-1 in SKBR3 but not in T47D cells. In conclusion, we show that activation of CXCR4 transduces proliferative signals from the E2 receptor to EGFR, whose inhibition is able to revert breast cancer cell proliferation induced by multiple receptor activation.

abstract={The bovine spongiform encephalopathy epidemic is thought to have occurred as a consequence of feeding prion-infected material to cattle. To avoid the risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy diffusion, the European Commission (Directive 2003/126/EC) established an official method to detect the presence of animal-derived constituents in feedstuffs, using microscopic examination. This method allows easy identification of bone fragments among other animal constituents. The analysis is based on morphological conformation of the fragments and their characterization (mainly of the shape of lacunae) to discriminate among mammalian, poultry, and fish tissues. The aim of this study was to assess the performances of nine European laboratories through a ring trial of the official microscopic method, and to calculate accuracy and reproducibility of the method. In general the reproducibility of the microscopic method was very good (κ overall = 0.83), with a high sensitivity for all laboratories. Concerning the analysis on the different animal-derived constituents, the results show values of sensitivity with large variability between fish and poultry or mammal. It was generally more difficult to discriminate between mammalian and poultry tissues than fish tissue. Copyright ©, International Association for Food Protection.},

Phylogenetic trees including Italian and reference sequences showed a clear separation of B. lusitaniae OspA strains in two different major clades. North African isolates form a clade with Portuguese POTIB strains, whereas Italian samples are grouped with German strains and a human Portuguese strain. This subdivision was supported by very high posterior probability values in the trees, by both analysis of molecular variance and selective pressure. These results, based on phylogenetic information contained in the OspA gene sequences, show the presence of two different B. lusitaniae strains circulating in the Mediterranean basin area, suggesting two different evolution paths. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Mutations at the tumour suppressor gene TP53 are associated with nearly half of human cancers, but they appear to be rare (∼10%) in feline neoplasms. The reasons for this difference are presently unclear but might be related to evolutionary divergence of p53 functions. To begin exploring this issue, we developed a yeast-based functional assay to measure the transcriptional ability of wild-type (wt) or mutant feline p53 (fe_p53) in comparison with human or murine p53 (hu_p53, mo_p53). fe_p53 cDNA was cloned and expressed in a panel of yeast reporter strains engineered to contain the ADE2 or the luciferase gene under p53 control via different p53 response elements. We established that wt fe_, hu_ and mo_p53 can act as transcription factors in yeast with overlapping DNA sequence specificities. Random mutagenesis and phenotypic evaluation of fe_ and hu_p53 cDNAs was also performed, revealing equal susceptibility to deleterious mutations. Five tumour-associated fe_p53 mutants exhibited a similar impact on the transactivation capacity (partial or complete loss) compared to the corresponding hu_p53 mutants. Given the high conservation of the intrinsic functional properties of fe_p53, further studies will be needed to clarify the role of p53 in feline carcinogenetic pathways. © The Author 2007.

abstract={Noroviruses are increasingly important as aetiological agents of gastrointestinal infections. They belong to the Caliciviridae family, and are composed by small round structured viruses with a plussense, single-stranded RNA genome. Due to their high lev el of genetic diversity, they are divided into five genogroups (GG): genogroups I, II, and IV are pathogen for humans, while genogroups III and V are infective for cows and mice, respectively. Consumption of seafood and ready-to-eat vegetables is the most common way for human infections, and the appearance of outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis represents an important health problem which is also responsible of economic losses. This paper describes the results of six years of monitoring using the RT-Booster-PCR as method of investigation. Sequencing and genotyping of PCR results permitted to characterize and to group the strains revealed for epidemiological investigations.},

abstract={In this paper, data derived from the national database of the Italian surveillance system for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) are used to describe the Italian epidemic of BSE. Two data flows were established to collect the results of active and passive surveillance, and 25 regional laboratories were involved. The National Reference Centre (CEA) was in charge of the data analysis. Crude and age-standardised estimates of the prevalence and incidence of BSE were obtained to describe the distribution of the disease in terms of the main risk factors (age, breed and herd size), year of birth, time of diagnosis and geographical location. The increased risk was calculated in terms of the incidence rate ratio. During the five years since January 2001,128 cases of BSE were identified in domestic cows and four were identified in imported cattle. All but one of the cases were detected through active surveillance. The risk of the disease was highest in dairy stock and in large herds. The northern regions of Italy had an incidence of BSE 2-6 times higher than the southern regions. There was a clear decline in the age-standardised prevalence, from one positive case per 10,000 tests in 2001 to one per 100,000 tests in 2005.},

abstract={Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare platelet concentration in cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS) measured by different methods commonly used in veterinary hospitals and commercial laboratories. Methods: Blood samples obtained from 41 (CKCS) were analysed by impedance cell counter, laser cell counter and microscopic estimation. Quantitative buffy coat analysis was performed only on 17 samples, selected from (CKCS) that had low platelet counts detected by cell counters. Platelet counts, platelet estimations and platelet parameters using these different methods were compared. Results: The median platelet number was lower when estimated using impedance cell counter (1363×109/l) with respect to laser cell counter (1723×109/l), microscopic estimation (2383×10 9/l) or quantitative buffy coat analyser (2923×10 9/l) (P&lt;0·01). Although impedance cell counter, laser cell counter and microscopic estimation were positively correlated, there was no acceptable agreement among methods. (CKCS) with macrothrombocytes in blood smears had significantly lower counts on impedance cell counter, laser cell counter and microscopic estimation. The percentages of (CKCS) with platelet count &lt; 1003×109/l were 34·1 per cent (impedance cell counter), 26·8 per cent (laser cell counter), 22·0 per cent (microscopic estimation) (not statistically different) and 5·8 per cent (quantitative buffy coat analyser) (P&lt;0·05). Clinical Significance: (CKCS) with macrothrombocytosis have low platelet counts on impedance cell counters, laser cell counters and microscopic estimation. (CKCS) with low platelet counts may have a normal platelet crit detected by a quantitative buffy coat analyser and thus a normal circulating platelet mass. © 2007 British Small Animal Veterinary Association.},

abstract={The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of enterovirulent Escherichia coli strains in cheese manufactured in the Italian Alpine Region. Cheese samples obtained from raw and pasteurised milk were collected from cheese-making plants. Enumeration of E. coli and the presence of verocytotoxigenic (VTEC), enteropathogenic (EPEC) and enterotoxic (ETEC) E. coli were carried out. A multiplex-PCR for the amplification of the sequences of VT1, VT2, eae, ehxA, ST, LT genes was used to identify pathogenic E. coli strains. The presence of E. coli O157 was investigated using an immunomagnetic separation technique. E. coli O157 was not recovered in cheese made from raw or pasteurised milk. The multiplex PCR approach detected at least one virulence determinant in only ten cheese samples, in four of them, a verotoxin-producing gene (VT2 and/or VT1) was detected and in the remaining six only the attaching and effacing lesion genes (eae) were found. No ETEC strains were detected. The statistical analyses of the results demonstrated significant associations between the use of raw milk in cheese production and the presence of detectable virulence genes in cheese. Moreover, high E. coli counts were also associated with the use of raw milk in fresh and ripened cheese production. The results revealed the survival and recovery of pathogenic strains even after a 60-day ripening period, highlighting the importance of the hygienic and sanitary requirements for milk used in the production of both fresh and ripened cheese.},

abstract={This study aimed at investigating the extent of accumulation of selenium in the hepatopancreas of the crayfish Procambarus clarkii and its effects on the enzymatic activities of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase. Crayfish were fed for 15 days either a diet enriched in Se, ED (1.21 mg kg-1) or a standard diet, SD (0.30 mg kg-1). Results showed that Se accumulation is higher in the sample subject to ED rather than to SD. A sexual difference was found for the response of the analyzed enzymes in the ED sample only. Catalase activity and glutathione peroxidase activity decreased in females and males, respectively, whereas glutathione reductase activity showed significant reductions in both sexes. These preliminary data might provide information about prooxidant effects of Se on P. clarkii when fed a Se enriched diet.},

abstract={Immunohistochemistry for PrPSc is used widely in scrapie diagnosis. In natural scrapie cases the use of immunohistochemistry (IHC) has revealed the existence of up to 12 different morphological types of immunostained deposits. The significance of this pattern variability in relation to genotype has not been studied extensively in natural disease. In this study we recorded in detail PrPSc patterns at the obex level of the medulla oblongata from 163 animals derived from 55 flocks which presented through passive surveillance in the UK and Italy. A strong association was seen between PrPSc patterns and PrP genotype, particularly in relation to codon 136. In a blind assessment of this association we were able to predict, with over 80% accuracy, the genotype of 151 scrapie cases which were presented through passive surveillance from 13 farms. The genotype of these cases was ARQ/ARQ or VRQ/VRQ. The association of PrPsc patterns with genotype was generally stronger in those farms where all the affected animals belonged to a single genotype compared with farms where both genotypes were identified, with the exception of one farm in which the genotype of all affected sheep was ARQ/ARQ and the PrPSc patterns were of the VRQ/VRQ type. Our observations support the hypothesis that the observed association between specific IHC patterns and genotypes may in fact be strain driven but in natural disease individual scrapie strains may demonstrate a genotypic tropism. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Scrapie in sheep is an infectious disease with genetic susceptibility playing an important role. The European Union applied genetics to control scrapie in the sheep population. In goats no clear association between PrP genotypes and resistance to scrapie has been demonstrated yet. Beside investigating this further, it is important to know the PrP genotype distribution in goat breeds. Actually, to estimate the frequency of interesting alleles in a population is a necessary preliminary step to understand how feasible it could be to select them. Aim of this work is to analyse the variability of the PrP gene in goat breeds from a Northern and a Southern Italian regions. Blood samples were collected from 300 goats of the four most common goat breeds reared in Piedmont region, belonging to 81 herds, and from 178 goats of 7 breeds from Basilicata, belonging to 19 herds. PrP gene polymorphisms were detected by direct DNA sequencing on both strands of the PCR products. In total, thirteen point mutations were identified: G37V, T110P, G127S, M137I, I142M, I142T, H143R, R154H, P168Q, T194P, R211Q, Q222K and S240P (the substitutions I142T and T194P are novel). This variability gave rise to 14 alleles. The allele with S127 mutation and the allele with Q211 mutation were found only in Northern goats while V37, I137, T142, R143 and P194 alleles were detected only in Southern goats. Regarding the alleles that were present in both groups, the M142 allele was statistically associated with Northern goats (χ2=39.84, p-value=&lt;0.001) while K222 and H154 alleles were significantly associated with breeds from the South (χ2=54.75, p-value=&lt;0.001; χ2=5.68, p-value=&lt;0.05, respectively). The substitutions T110P, M137I, I142T, P168Q, and T194P were found at a low rate in both Southern and Northern goats and no statistically significant differences were observed between the groups. The present study revealed a high variability in the caprine PrP gene and clear frequency differences between Northern and Southern breeds, with mutations exclusively or significantly associated with one group or the other. M142 and K222 are known to be related to protection against scrapie in goats. More case-control studies are necessary to confirm the protective role of these variants; in fact if this role is confirmed it will allow the introduction of breeding programme to select for resistance to TSEs also in goats.},

abstract={A reliable ante-mortem test for the detection of scrapie in all genotypes has not yet been developed and clinical diagnosis remains a useful tool for surveillance purposes. This paper describes the results of a three-year study in which clinical signs consistent with scrapie were recorded according to standardized criteria in 245 sheep from 21 outbreaks in Italy in order to identify helpful criteria for the diagnosis of the disease. Thirty-seven sheep were scrapie-positive at post-mortem rapid testing, 23 showed weight loss, 20 had proprioceptive deficits, 17 demonstrated ataxia and nibble reflex, and some sheep had a combination of signs. Six scrapie-positive sheep were asymptomatic. The clinical protocol was easy to handle and appears to be a useful tool for improving passive surveillance. The data suggested that positive clinical history, nibble, and nibble combined with proprioceptive positioning deficit have a quite high negative predictive value. The protocol will be proposed as a tool for field inspection in passive surveillance in Italy. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Implementation in Europe of large-scale testing to detect bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)-infected cattle and prevent the transmission of this prion disease to humans has recently led to the discovery of novel types of bovine prions. We characterized atypical isolates called BSE L-type by analyzing their molecular and neuropathological properties during transmission to several mouse lines transgenic for the prion protein (PrP). Unexpectedly, such isolates acquired strain features closely similar to those of BSE-type agents when propagated in mice expressing ovine PrP, although they retained phenotypic traits distinct from BSE in other lines, including bovine PrP mice. These findings further underline the relationship between the crossing of species barrier and prion strain diversification, and, although the origin of the epidemic BSE agent has only been speculative until now, they provide new insight into the nature of the events that could have led to the appearance of this agent.

abstract={The aim of the study involved evaluation of the presence of aflatoxin M 1 in milk for sale in a specific North West Italian region, Piedmont. The study, conducted from November 2003 to July 2005, was linked to the specific emergency situation which arose due to the climatic conditions during the summer of 2003 which encouraged the development of aflatoxin B 1 in items used for animal feed. This in turn led to the transfer of the metabolite, aflatoxin M 1 , into the milk. In total some 316 milk samples were collected during the commercial phase by the official control bodies and analysed. The analysis involved the use of high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) combined with fluorimetric measurement, and purification of the extracts using immunoaffinity columns. The results indicated only 2 non conforming samples (0.6%), with limits higher than those set out in the regulations (0.05 μg L -1 ). In addition, the analyses revealed, in 5 samples (1.6%), threshold values of 0.05 μg L -1 . From the data obtained it can be seen that the "aflatoxins" problem only marginally affected Piedmont Region though the trend for average monthly values suggests a return to the use of contaminated animal feed as soon as official controls are less intensive. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy strains can be differentiated by their behavior in bioassays and by molecular analyses of the disease-associated prion protein (PrP) in a posttranslationally transformed conformation (PrP Sc). Until recently, isolates from cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) appeared to be very homogeneous. However, a limited number of atypical BSE isolates have recently been identified upon analyses of the disease-associated proteinase K (PK) resistance-associated moiety of PrP Sc (PrPres), suggesting the existence of at least two additional BSE PrPres variants. These are defined here as the H type and the L type, according to the higher and lower positions of the nonglycosylated PrPres band in Western blots, respectively, compared to the position of the band in classical BSE (C-type) isolates. These molecular PrPres variants, which originated from six different European countries, were investigated together. In addition to the migration properties and glycosylation profiles (glycoprofiles), the H- and L-type isolates exhibited enhanced PK sensitivities at pH 8 compared to those of the C-type isolates. Moreover, H-type BSE isolates exhibited differences in the binding of antibodies specific for N- and more C-terminal PrP regions and principally contained two aglycosylated PrPres moieties which can both be glycosylated and which is thus indicative of the existence of two PrPres populations or intermediate cleavage sites. These properties appear to be consistent within each BSE type and independent of the geographical origin, suggesting the existence of different BSE strains in cattle. The choice of three antibodies and the application of two pHs during the digestion of brain homogenates provide practical and diverse tools for the discriminative detection of these three molecular BSE types and might assist with the recognition of other variants.

abstract={The partial PrP gene sequence and the deduced protein of eight cetacean species, seven of which have never been reported so far, have been determined in order to extend knowledge of sequence variability of the PrP genes in different species and to aid in speculation on cetacean susceptibility to prions. Both the nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences have been analysed in comparison with some of the known mammalian PrPs. Cetacean PrPs present typical features of eutherian PrPs. The PrP gene from the species of the family Delphinidae gave identical nucleic acid sequences, while differences in the PrP gene were found in Balaenopteridae and Ziphidae. The phylogenetic tree resulting from analysis of the cetacean PrP gene sequences, together with reported sequences of some ungulates, carnivores and primates, showed that the PrP gene phylogenesis mirrors the species phylogenesis. The PrP gene of cetaceans is very close to species where natural forms of TSEs are known. From an analysis of the sequences and the phylogenesis of the PrP gene, susceptibility to or occurrence of prion diseases in cetaceans can not be excluded. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={After the first report of Brucella melitensis infection from a 7-year-old alpine ibex (Capra ibex) buck living in Gran Paradiso National Park (GPNP), further studies demonstrated the presence of the infection in ibex and chamois. Considering that livestock herds keep on sharing pastures with more than 3,500 ibex and 9,000 chamois in the park, our aim was to demonstrate under controlled conditions the possibility of Brucella infection passing from wild ruminants to livestock. A 7-year-old male alpine ibex with clinical signs of brucellosis and serologically positive was released in a 5,000 m2 enclosure together with five goats and two sheep rams. Due to poor condition, ibex was suppressed at day 40, domestic ruminants stayed into the enclosure potentially contaminated by ibex for further 38 days. During this period, we had monitored our animals taking blood from domestic ruminants every 15 days and tested the serum to Rose Bengal agglutination test and Complement Fixation test. Domestic animals tested negative at serology at all sampling time and at isolation, while B. melitensis biovar 3 was isolated from ibex tissues. Our data show that transmission of infection from ibex to livestock is not easy. After 40 days of strict cohabitation and 38 days of permanence in an area where an infected ibex lives, no one of the domestic animals contracted infection. In spite of the limitation of our field trial, we have demonstrated that long direct and indirect contact between alpine ibex and domestic animals will not easily lead to an infection of the latter. Further investigations are needed to confirm our results and evaluate the effective risk of B. melitensis transmission from alpine ibex to livestock. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) is a cytoplasmic transcription factor that plays a role in the G1 to S phase cell-cycle transition and is induced by cytokines and growth factors. The expression of STAT3 phosphorylated on tyrosine 705 (STAT3-p-tyr705) in normal, hyperplastic and neoplastic feline mammary gland tissue was assessed by immunohistochemistry in 45 cats. The samples included 4 normal mammary non-lactating tissues, 9 hyperplastic tissues (5 fibroepithelial hyperplasia and 4 lobular epithelial hyperplasia), 2 benign tumours (1 complex adenoma, and 1 simple adenoma), and 30 carcinomas (18 simple tubular papillary, 6 simple tubular, 2 simple solid, 3 cribriform, and 1 adenosquamous carcinoma). For immunohistochemistry, tissue sections were incubated with an anti-STAT3-p-tyr705 monoclonal antibody and visualized with EnVision-DAB polymer. STAT3-p-tyr705 positivity was quantified in a semi-quantitative manner. All positive samples showed cytoplasmic and/or nuclear positivity. Normal non-lactating mammary tissue showed a low number of positive cells, similar to hyperplastic tissue. In neoplastic tissues, a high number of positive cells with a moderate to intense reaction was observed. Moreover, a correlation was observed between nuclear positivity for STAT3-p-tyr705 and histologic grade (P = 0.013; r = 0.447), tubular formation (P = 0.043; r = 0.820), and mitotic activity (P < 0.0001; r = 0.689). In contrast, no such correlations were observed for cytoplasmic reactivity of STAT3-p-tyr705. A significant difference was observed between malignant lesions and hyperplasia with regards to expression of STAT3-p-tyr 705 in the cytoplasm (P = 0.008; U = 59.00) and nuclei (P = 0.002; U = 47.00). These results confirm previous our data and reinforce the potential role of STAT3 in malignancy as reported for human breast cancer and other sporadic tumours. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In total sera from 234 dogs were collected: 59 positives and 51 doubtful sera (IFA 1:40-1:80) from an L. infantum endemic area and 124 negative sera from a non-endemic area were tested. To evaluate the Snap® CLATK's performances on whole blood, blood in EDTA and sera from 37 dogs were tested in parallel with Snap® CLATK. Snap® CLATK sensitivity and specificity compared to IFA were 91.1% and 99.2%, while compared to WB were 93.4% and 98.3%, respectively. When IFA doubtful sera (titers of 1:40 or 1:80) were tested Snap® CLATK, using WB as reference, sensitivity and specificity were 90.9% and 100%, respectively. Moreover, a complete concordance was observed when Snap® CLATK rapid assay was carried out on whole blood or sera from 37 dogs. The Snap® CLATK has demonstrated simplicity and performance and can be considered a quick and reliable alternative for the diagnosis of L. infantum infection in dogs. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Atypical neuropathological and molecular phenotypes of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) have recently been identified in different countries. One of these phenotypes, named bovine "amyloidotic" spongiform encephalopathy (BASE), differs from classical BSE for the occurrence of a distinct type of the disease-associated prion protein (PrP), termed PrP Sc, and the presence of PrP amyloid plaques. Here, we show that the agents responsible for BSE and BASE possess different biological properties upon transmission to transgenic mice expressing bovine PrP and inbred lines of nontransgenic mice. Strikingly, serial passages of the BASE strain to nontransgenic mice induced a neuropathological and molecular disease phenotype indistinguishable from that of BSE-infected mice. The existence of more than one agent associated with prion disease in cattle and the ability of the BASE strain to convert into the BSE strain may have important implications with respect to the origin of BSE and spongiform encephalopathies in other species, including humans. © 2007 Capobianco et al.},

abstract={Bovine spongiform encephalopathy is a prion disease of ruminants that was first recognized in 1986 in the United Kingdom. Early in the epidemic, it became obvious that the presence of meat and bone meal in feed rations was a common factor in all bovine spongiform encephalopathy cases. The first ban of derived animal proteins in feed was enforced in Europe in 1994 and implemented by Regulation 999/2001 that prohibited the feeding of animal-derived protein to farm animals. The only official method currently accepted by the European Union Commission for test for the presence of animal-derived proteins in feedstuffs is feed microscopy. In Italy, monitoring of feedstuff safety is provided by both the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture. The quality of official control, usually assessed by verifying the reproducibility and the accuracy of the testing method, is of fundamental importance for all laboratories and institutions using these results for comparative purposes. The aims of this study were to assess the reproducibility of the official method over all the Italian surveillance network and to provide a model for evaluating the performance of the monitoring system. The accuracy of the identification of the animal class of derived protein detected (avian, mammalian, or aquatic organism) was assessed. The interlaboratory agreement within the overall network reached 0.97 (95% confidence interval of 0.95 to 0.98) for determining the presence or absence of animal-derived proteins (e.g., for mammalian, avian, or aquatic species), and specificity of the identification of the animal class indicated that fish proteins are more easily recognized than are avian or mammalian proteins.

abstract={The Maremmana breed is characterised by rusticity, resistance to harsh environments and good growth ability and it could be considered as one of the most suited breeds for extensive rearing in Italy. Moreover, Maremmana presents high fertility and good fostering ability but, on the other hand, the age at first calving appears quite high. This could probably be due to reduced feed availability to which animals are frequently subjected. The aim of this paper was to determine the age at puberty in Maremmana heifers, the repeatability of the reproductive cycles along the seasons and to verify the possibility to anticipate the age at first service. Haematic levels of progesterone and 17-β-estradiol were determined weekly in 6 heifers raised in pens and fed with 0.70 Milk FU/kg DM and 121 g of gross protein/kg d.m, starting from 9 up to 25 months of age. Metabolic profile was determined monthly to highlight possible metabolic unbalances that could affect reproductive activity. Plasma was submitted to RIA analysis in order to measure steroidal hormones. Puberty was considered reached when two subsequent measures of progesterone resulted higher than 1 ng/ml of plasma. This happened in 5 out of 6 heifers at an average age of 17 months. The fluctuation of the hormonal levels throughout the year seems to exclude the seasonality of the oestrous cycle. The results showed that the level of the most important metabolites is within the normal range and it does not seem to interfere with the choice to anticipate the first service by one year. Possible periods of anoestrus noticed in some herds could be linked to the reduced availability of pastures in a few months of the year.},

abstract={IS900 Nested-PCR was applied to milk from asymptomatic sheep and goats known to have a history of Johne's disease in order to detect the presence of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). Experimental animals were from two MAP seropositive flocks (90 heads) in Piedmont, North-western Italy. During a 6-month period, milk samples were collected from 29 lambing and kidding animals (20 sheep and 9 goats, five milk collections per animal). MAP DNA was intermittently recovered in milk samples from 13 out of 29 animals (44.8% prevalence). MAP was particularly found in 9 out of 15 seropositive animals, and in 4 out of 14 seronegative. Sensitivity of Nested-PCR was assessed by analyzing a serial dilution of MAP DNA. Results suggest that sheep and goats' raw milk may represent a potential vehicle for transmitting MAP to off-springs. Control measures could be usefully applied to small ruminants as already used for cattle. Taking into account the possible link between MAP, Crohn's disease and consumption of raw milk products, it is suggested that there should be more careful collaboration in veterinary and public health services, livestock breeders and dairy producers, as well as improved diagnostic tools for routine tests. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The pathogenesis of natural scrapie in Sarda breed sheep was investigated in 1050 asymptomatic and 49 sick sheep from scrapie-affected flocks. Central and peripheral nervous system, along with lymphoreticular system (LRS) tissues, were subjected to immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western-blotting (WB) for detection of pathological isoform of the prion protein (PrPSc). A total of 69 of the 1050 clinically healthy sheep were found to be infected with scrapie, with PrPSc being detected in both the central nervous system (CNS) and enteric nervous system (ENS) plexuses of 60 of the sheep, while IHC and WB yielded evidence of (PrPSc) deposition only in lymphoid tissues of the remaining 9 clinically healthy sheep. PrPSc was also detected in the CNS, as well as in ENS plexuses from all of the 49 clinically affected sheep. Nevertheless, 18 of the 69 clinically healthy animals (26%, 17 ARQ/ARQ and 1 ARQ/AHQ sheep), along with 3 ARQ/ARQ sheep (6%) of the clinically affected group, showed no IHC or WB evidence of PrPSc in lymphoid tissues, but PrPSc could be still detected in their CNS and ENS plexuses. The study demonstrates dual CNS and ENS PrPSc deposition in Sarda sheep with scrapie, in spite of an apparent lack of lymphoid tissue involvement in a number of cases. © Springer-Verlag 2006.},

Heavy metals content in hepatopancreas in males and females of P. clarkii was low and did not vary through the sampling periods and between sexes. On the contrary, crayfish exhibited sex-dependent differences in levels of some enzyme activities and of total glutathione, and no apparent relationship was found between contaminant burdens and antioxidant indexes in hepatopancreas. Because measured metal concentrations were low, other factors, presumably, were involved in antioxidant variations in P. clarkii and these latter seemed to be affected more by biological and environmental factors, other than those related to pollutants body burdens.},

abstract={The continuous monitoring of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) cases is an integral component of European research and surveillance programmes, to ensure that any changes in the presentation of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) in cattle can be detected and defined. Monitoring is generally limited to the brainstem at the level of the obex, for reasons of practicality, safety and cost. Demonstration of disease-specific prion protein (PrPd) by immunohistochemistry is currently the most widely used confirmatory tool for both active and passive surveillance. This study assessed PrPd immunostaining in the brainstems (obex) of cattle with BSE in the UK and Italy. Immunoreactivity 'profiles' were created for each case based on the nature of the immunostaining, its relative intensity and precise neuroanatomical location. This study compares the obex immunostaining patterns of Italian cases (only active surveillance) and two UK groups (both active and passive surveillance). The neuroanatomical distribution and relative intensity of PrPd was highly reproducible in all cases. The overall staining intensity varied widely but was generally stronger in the active than in the passive surveillance populations. The conclusion to be drawn from this comparative study is that the pattern of immunopathology in these routine screening samples for BSE diagnosis and surveillance is the same in the UK and Italy, whether or not the animal was displaying typical, or indeed any, clinical signs at the time of sampling. This indicates that the current confirmatory diagnostic strategy remains appropriate for active surveillance applications. © British Crown 2006.},

abstract={Susceptibility to scrapie in sheep is influenced by polymorphisms of the prion protein (PrP) gene, whereas no strong association between genetics and scrapie has yet been determined in goats due to the limited number of studies on these animals. In this case-control study on 177 goats from six Italian scrapie outbreaks, the association between PrP alleles and the occurrence of scrapie was studied. Three silent mutations and 11 PrP polymorphisms were identified, of which two polymorphisms (L133Q and M137I) and one silent mutation (T202T) have not been reported previously. Twelve alleles were determined by cloning. Statistical analysis suggested a possible protective role against scrapie for the glutamine to lysine mutation at codon 222. © 2006 SGM.},

abstract={The bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) epidemic, along with the related threat to human health posed by the transmission of the BSE agent to humans, has highlighted the importance of prion diseases. These fatal neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by spongiform changes in the CNS, and comprise a wide spectrum of clinicopathological entities in humans and animals, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and its emerging new variant (vCJD) in humans, and BSE and scrapie in animals. This article reviews the geographical distribution and the temporal trends of CJD and vCJD; the major events in the pathogenesis of prion diseases; the risk factors for sporadic CJD and vCJD; and the possible strategies for treating them. Worldwide statistics indicate that sporadic CJD has a stable incidence of one case per million people per year; in contrast, the incidence of vCJD appears to have increased exponentially from its characterisation in 1994 to a peak in 2000. As of December 2005, 183 definite or probable cases of vCJD had been reported worldwide. The crucial event in the pathogenesis of prion diseases is the conversion of the normally occurring cellular prion protein (PrPc) into a pathogenic form, called protease-resistant PrP (PrPres) or scrapie PrP (PrPsc). Pathogenetic studies in rodent models have shown that PrPsc is found in the enteric nervous system and in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue following oral scrapie ingestion. The role of the lymphoreticular system in the pathogenesis of TSE seems to be related to the strains of agents and the host genotype. Therapeutic approaches to vCJD are mainly based on the inhibition or prevention of the pathological change that creates PrPsc. Derivatives of acridine (such as mepacrine [quinacrine]) and the phenothiazine psychotropics have been proposed as possible therapies because of their activity in cellular models; however, neither class was able to affect the protease resistance of preexisting PrP fibrils. More encouragingly, in animal models of prion disease, tetracyclines were found to reduce prion infectivity by direct inactivation of PrPsc. While these findings are promising, the suitability of these compounds for clinical use is still limited by their low efficacy once symptoms are apparent. Treatments based on the vaccination approach have also produced positive results, but further investigations are necessary to establish their clinical application. © 2006 Adis Data Information BV.

abstract={To protect public health from bovine spongiform encephalopathy, European Commission Regulation EC 1139/2003 on monitoring programs and specified risk material requires that as of 1 October 2003, each member state has in place a sampling plan with an appropriate laboratory test to detect central nervous system (CNS) tissue in bovine head meat harvested at slaughterhouses or cutting plants. With this study, we wanted to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of an enzyme immunoassay, the RIDASCREEN Risk Material 10/5, in targeting a CNS-specific marker, the glial fibrillary acidic protein. A receiver operating characteristics curve was plotted to identify the best cutoff of CNS concentration. Reliability was calculated by Cohen's kappa on data from two diagnostic sessions. Test performance showed high sensitivity and specificity (97.9 and 97.4%, respectively) for a cutoff value between positive and negative at a CNS concentration of 0.049%; reliability of test precision was also very good. When these criteria are applied, the RIDASCREEN Risk Material 10/5 test appears to be a reliable tool for monitoring CNS tissue contamination in meat. This diagnostic procedure should therefore be recommended for national application in monitoring programs. Copyright ©, International Association for Food Protection.},

abstract={Listeria monocytogenes strains, isolated from various sources (food, environment, and animals), were used to test different PCR-based methods to investigate their capability to define the strain origin. RAPD-PCR with three primers and the SAU-PCR method, in which the DNA was first digested with the Sau3A restriction endonuclease and then amplified with a primer designed on the restriction site, were carried out, and the profiles obtained were used to perform cluster analysis. Based on the cluster analysis of Listeria spp. strains, obtained from international collections, the coefficient of similarity was selected. The results obtained showed that the methods tested in the study gave different levels of differentiation between the strains tested. The RAPD protocol using the P1254 primer and the SAU-PCR gave appreciable results only for strains isolated from animals and from a food processing plant in two different periods of the year 2003. Better differentiation was observed using the RAPD-PCR with primer D8635. As a matter of fact, it was able to distinguish L. monocytogenes obtained from different species of animals, different food samples and strains from the same production plant isolated in different periods of the year. Also primer M13 gave positive results, but the coefficient of similarity to use had to be increased to 80%. On the basis of the results observed, RAPD-PCR with primers D8635 and M13 should be considered reliable tools for epidemiological investigations focusing on L. monocytogenes. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, vaccination was shown to be effective in mouse models of a particular neurodegenerative conditions: Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we report that vaccination with synthetic oligopeptides homologous to the hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) prion protein augments survival time in animals infected intraperitoneally with 263K scrapie agent. For each hamster included in the study, prion-specific serum antibodies as well as deposition of pathological prion protein (PrPres), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and mRNA expression for cytokines (TNFα, IL-1β, IL-10) in brain tissues were evaluated. In immunized animals, increased survival after challenge was associated with a reduction of cerebral lesion, PrP deposition and GFAP expression; in these animals, anti-prion protein peptide antibody levels were increased, and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα and IL-1β) was reduced. Vaccination could be an effective therapeutic approach to postpone disease onset. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Staphylococcus aureus is a very common organism capable of producing several enterotoxins (SEs) that cause intoxication symptoms of varying intensity in humans when ingested through contaminated food. This paper reports the results of an investigation on the presence of Coagulase-Positive Staphylococci (CPS) and S. aureus in several food products marketed in Italy and on food contact surface swabs sampled from the food industry. A total of 11,384 samples were examined and 1971 of them (17.3%) were found to contain CPS. The assays performed on 541 CPS strains led to the identification of 537 S. aureus strains on which characterization of type A, B, C and D staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEA, SEB, SEC and SED) was performed. A total of 298 S. aureus strains (55.5%) produced one or more SEs: 33.9% of the strains produced SEC, 26.5% SEA, 20.5% SEA+SED, 13.4% SED, 2.7% SEB, 1.7% SEA+SEB, 0.7% SEC+SED and 0.3% produced SEA+SEC and SEB+SEC. The investigation highlighted that these organisms are very common and constitute a potential risk for consumers' health. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The present survey collected and analyzed the results of routine testing for Salmonella enterica and Listeria monocytogenes on foods of animal origin submitted for official controls in Italy during 2001 to 2002. Salmonella was detected in 2.2% of 71,643 food samples examined, and the isolation rates ranged from 9.9% for raw poultry meat to less than 0.1% for dairy products. Isolation rates were also high in raw pork (4.9%) and processed meats (5.3%), which often involved pork. Low rates were observed in seafood (0.5%) and in ready-to-eat foods, such as grocery products (0.7%) and ice creams (0.1%). Serotyping showed that approximately 50% of the isolates belonged to the serotypes most commonly isolated from humans in Italy, thus confirming that most cases of human salmonellosis have a foodborne origin. Levels of L. monocytogenes were higher than what is accepted by the current regulation in 2.4% of 42,300 food samples. The positivity rates ranged from 10.3% in raw pork to none in eggs and egg products. Contamination rates were higher in other meat products (between 2 and 5%) and fish (6.5%) than in cheeses (1.1%) and other dairy products (0.6%). Routine control activities on the microbial contamination of foods can generate data with statistical and epidemiological value. Such data can be used as a basis for estimating the exposure of consumers to foodborne pathogens, following the trends of contamination over time, and evaluating the effects of control measures on the contamination of food.

abstract={Background: Radioisotopes are introduced into the environment following nuclear power plant accidents or nuclear weapons tests. The immobility of these radioactive elements in uppermost soil layers represents a problem for human health, since they can easily be incorporated in the food chain. Preventing their assimilation by plants may be a first step towards the total recovery of contaminated areas. Methods: The possibility of displacing radionuclides from the most superficial soil layers and their subsequent stabilisation at lower levels were investigated in laboratory trials. An experimental system reproducing the environmental conditions of contaminated areas was designed in plastic columns. A radiopolluted soil sample was treated with solutions containing ions normally used in -(fertilisation (NO3 -, NH4 +, PO4 --- and K+. Results: Contaminated soils treated with an acid solution of ions NO 3 -, PO4 --- and K+, undergo a reduction of radioactivity up to 35%, after a series of washes which simulate one year's rainfall. The capacity of the deepest soil layers to immobilize the radionuclides percolated from the superficial layers was also confirmed. Conclusion: The migration of radionuclides towards deeper soil layers, following chemical treatments, and their subsequent stabilization reduces bioavailability in the uppermost soil horizon, preventing at the same time their transfer into the water-bearing stratum.},

abstract={Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae is a malacosporean parasite causing Proliferative Kidney Disease (PKD) of salmonids, which develops in a sac-shaped phase producing infective spores in freshwater bryozoans. From 2001–2003, several samples of bryozoans were collected along the Sile River (Treviso Province, northern Italy) from sites which are in close communication with two trout farms where PKD is enzootic. All the colonies found were observed under a stereomicroscope in search of T. bryosalmonae and to isolate statoblasts. The bryozoans were classified by studying the superficial microarchitecture of the statoblasts using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The following species were identified: Cristatella mucedo, Fredericella sultana, Plumatella casmiana, P. emarginata, P. fungosa, P. repens, P. reticulata, P. rugosa, and P. similirepens. Developmental stages of T. bryosalmonae were never found in the colonies. In 11 out of 40 P. fungosa floatoblasts, treated with KOH for SEM study, vermiform structures of 0.5–8 mm in length were observed. The possibility that these structures could represent the vermiform phase of T. bryosalmonae with a developmental stage similar to those described for Buddenbrockia plumatellae is discussed. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={A geographic information system and K-function analysis were used to evaluate the spatial association of canine serological results for Rickettsia conorii, the causative agent of Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF), and clinical cases of MSF in humans in Piemonte, northwest Italy. The residences of dog owners were clustered in two rural villages in the province of Cuneo, where two human cases of MSF occurred in 1997 and 1998. Eighteen out of 116 dogs examined were positive by indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA+, titre ≥ 1:160) for MSF. K-functions were compared for IFA+ dogs and for all dogs sampled. Monte Carlo and bootstrap simulations demonstrated that clustering of IFA+ dogs was significantly greater than clustering of all dogs, at distances of less than 0. 6 km from human cases of MSF. Logistic regression analysis indicated that the risk of being IFA+ was highest for dogs residing within the first quartile of distance (0.7 km) from human cases of the disease, and for dogs that were not confined. However, year and season of blood collection were not associated with IFA status. It was concluded that a relatively high dog population density along with a rural or semi-rural environment favours the occurrence of emergent foci of MSF in the province of Cuneo. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={An accidental intra- and interspecies transmission of scrapie occurred in Italy in 1997 and 1998 following exposure to a vacine against Mycoplasma agalactiae. PrPSc in affected sheep and goats, collected from a single flock exposed to vaccination 2 years earlier, was molecularly typed. In five animals with iatrogenic scrapie, a PrPSc type with a 20 kDa core fragment was found in all areas of the brain investigated. In three sheep and one goat, this isoform co-occurred with a fully glycosylated isoform that had a protease-resistant backbone of 17 kDa, whereas in two sheep and four goats, the two PrPSc types were detected in different regions of the brain. In sheep with natural field scrapie, a PrPSc type with physico-chemical properties indistinguishable from the 20 kDa isoform was found. The present results suggest the co-presence of two prion strains in mammary gland and brain homogenates used for vaccination.},

abstract={Canine infections with Leishmania infantum are important as a cause of serious disease in the dog and as a reservoir for human visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Accurate diagnosis of canine infections is essential to the veterinary community and for VL surveillance programs. A standardized ELISA using a purified recombinant antigen (rK39) specific to VL was compared to the immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) as the standard. The ELISA was developed, optimized and evaluated using sera from 6368 dogs. The standardized ELISA and IFAT results were highly concordant. The timing and pattern of ELISA and IFAT seroconversion in dogs followed prospectively after natural infections were very similar. Antibodies reacting with rK39 were more common in asymptomatic canine infections than reported for subclinical human VL. The rK39 ELISA is a relatively simple and rapid assay for assessing the infection status of dogs, and is an alternative to IFAT, especially when screening large numbers of samples. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This paper describes a recent outbreak of scrapie in sheep and goats which were exposed to the same vaccine. No ewes or goats had been imported into the herd since 1992, but a vaccine against Mycoplasma agalactiae had been administered twice, in 1995 and 1997. High rates of crude mortality and scrapie incidence were experienced by both species, all birth cohorts were involved and a large proportion of aged animals was affected. A pattern of brain lesions was observed, with slight differences between the sheep and goats, which was very similar to the pattern observed in animals previously exposed to the same vaccine but clearly different from that observed in the brains of sheep with scrapie in a flock not exposed to the vaccine. Regardless of their exposure status, genotype analysis of the sheep showed the presence of polymorphism only at codon 171. The patterns of both incidence and brain lesions provide evidence that the epidemic of scrapie was due to the use of the vaccine.},

abstract={The oxidative metabolism of monensin, an ionophore antibiotic extensively used in veterinary practice as a coccidiostat and a growth promoter, was studied in hepatic microsomal preparations from horses, pigs, broiler chicks, cattle and rats. As assayed by the measurement of the amount of the released formaldehyde, the rate of monensin O-demethylation was nearly of the same order of magnitude in all species, but total monensin metabolism, which was estimated by measuring the rate of substrate disappearance by a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method, was highest in cattle, intermediate in rats, chicks and pigs, and lowest in horses. When expressed as turnover number (nmol of metabolized monensin/min nmol cytochrome P450-1), the catalytic efficiency (chick ≫ cattle ≫ pig ≈ rat &gt; horse) was found to correlate inversely with the well known interspecies differences in the susceptibility to the toxic effects of the ionophore, which is characterized by an oral LD50 of 2-3 mg/kg bodyweight (bw) in horses, 50-80 mg/kg bw in cattle and 200 mg/kg bw in chicks. Chick and cattle microsomes also displayed both the highest catalytic efficiency toward two P450 3A dependent substrates (erythromycin and triacetyloleandomycin) and the highest immunodetectable levels of proteins cross-reacting with anti rat P450 3A1/2. Further studies are required to define the role played by this isoenzyme in the oxidative biotransformation of the drug in food producing species.},

To resolve this problem, we investigated the possibility of using lung-tissue extract in place of blood serum for searching for antibodies against Brucella abortus. Antibodies titres against B. abortus was tested from blood serum and lung-tissue extract from 112 chamois and 99 cattle. Although in complement-fixation-test, lung-tissue extract titres usually were one- to three-fold lower than serum titres, there was a good agreement between serum and lung-tissue extract positivity both in chamois and in cattle.

abstract={Monensin (MON) is an ionophore antibiotic widely used in veterinary practice as a coccidiostatic or a growth promoter. The aims of this study were to characterize the P-450 isoenzyme(s) involved in the biotransformation of the ionophore and to investigate how this process may be affected by tiamulin and other chemotherapeutic agents known to produce toxic interactions with MON when administered concurrently in vivo. In liver microsomes from untreated rats (UT) or from rats pretreated, respectively, with ethanol (ETOH), β-naphthoflavone (βNAF), phenobarbital (PB), pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile (PCN), or dexamethasone (DEX), the rate of MON O-demethylation was the following: DEX &gt; PCN &gt; PB &gt;&gt; UT = ETOH &gt; βNAF; similar results were obtained by measuring total MON metabolism. In addition, the extent of triacetyloleandomycin-mediated P-450 complexes was greatly reduced by the prior addition of 100 μM MON. In DEX-treated microsomes, MON O-demethylation was found to fit monophasic Michaelis- Menten kinetics (K(M) = 67.6 ± 0.01 μM; V(max) = 4.75 ± 0.76 nmol/min/mg protein). Tiamulin markedly inhibited this activity in an apparent competitive manner, with a calculated K(i) (Dixon plot) of 8.2 μM and an IC50 of about 25 μM. At the latter concentration, only ketoconazole or metyrapone, which can bind P-450 3A, inhibited MON O-demethylase to a greater extent than tiamulin, whereas α-naphthoflavone, chloramphenicol, or sulphametasine was less effective. These results suggest that P-450 3A plays an important role in the oxidative metabolism of MON and that compounds capable of binding or inhibiting this isoenzyme could be expected to give rise to toxic interactions with the ionophore.},

abstract={Forty-eight feline mammary carcinomas (FMC) were resected surgically from 48 cats to determine whether the Ki-67 index (Ki-67I) would provide an indication of the post-surgical survival time (PST). Twenty-four cats (50 per cent) were still alive (group A) one year after surgery, whilst 24 (50 per cent) (group B) had died. Formalin-fixed, paraffin wax-embedded histological sections were immunostained with a monoclonal antibody to Ki-67 (MIB-1) and at least 1000 nuclei in eight to 10 representative fields were counted. The Ki-67I was expressed as the percentage of positive nuclei. In FMC, the Ki-67I ranged from 7·5 to 49·7 (24·8±9·5). A statistically significant difference (P = 0-000006) in the Ki-67I was found between group A and group B cats. No other statistically significant differences were found between these groups. The Ki-67I did not correlate with age or different histological type, according to the WHO classification. A Ki-67I cut-off of 25·2 represents a useful tool for identifying FMC with a more aggressive course.},

abstract={The performances of three enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and one radioimmunoassay (RIA) in 17α-19-nortestosterone (17α-19-NT) analysis of bovine urine have been evaluated. Sample preparation was performed by enzymic deconjugation and solid-phase extraction. The main object of the study was the evaluation of the matrix effect, which is generally great in 19-NT inununoassays. Fifty-seven bovine urine samples have been analysed by immunoassay and by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The detection limit of GC-MS analysis was 1 μg l-1. The mean sample blank values in urine analysis were close to 1.5 μg l-1 for one ELISA, and 0.4-0.8 μg l-1 for the other assays (n = 55, samples coming from several breeds in different geographic areas). The detection limits, calculated in compliance to the EEC criteria, were 2.67,1.97, 2.05 and 5.01 μg l -1 for RIA, ELISAs 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The percentage of false positive results adopting this criteria were: 1.8, 3.6, 1.8 and 3.6%. The probability of the occurrence of false negative results was evaluated by adding 2 μg l-1 of 19-NT to a negative sample, was high in each assay. Two samples from experimentally treated animals gave positive results both in GC-MS and in immunoassays. The results obtained confirm that by employing immunoassay and solid-phase extraction as sample clean-up, it is not possible to apply the action level (2 ppb) suggested by the European Union (EU).},
